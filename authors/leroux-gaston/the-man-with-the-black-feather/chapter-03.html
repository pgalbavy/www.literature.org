<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>On leaving the prison, Marceline and Adolphe were, very naturally,
full of curiosity to learn the reasons of Theophrastus' extraordinary
behaviour; and he had the greatest difficulty in getting them
away from the subject. He treated the matter lightly, declaring
that the whim had taken him to visit the cellars of the Conciergerie;
and he had visited them. They were even more impressed by his
attitude to the guide than by his actual plunge into the cellars.
That Theophrastus, the timid Theophrastus, should have browbeaten
not a mere man, but an official, amazed them. Theophrastus admits
that he was as much amazed as they, and felt rather proud of himself.
All the evening they kept recurring to the matter until their
amazement and their interest began to weaken by mere continuance
of expression. But Theophrastus was glad indeed when sleep at
last tied Marceline's tongue.</p>

<p>The next day he shut himself up in his study on the pretext of
straightening out his accounts. Its window looks down on to the
little grass-plot in the middle of Anvers Square; and he leaned
out over the sill, contemplating the prosaic reality of the scene
as if he could not have enough of it. He was above all pleased
by the nurses wheeling along their babies in perambulators and
by the shouting of the children romping about the Square.</p>

<p>His thought was of a great unity and a great simplicity. It was
entirely contained in the phrase: "The World has not changed."</p>

<p>No: the world had not changed. There were the babies in the perambulators;
and as the clock struck two the Signora Petito, wife of the Professor
of Italian who occupied the flat above his, began to play <em>The
Carnival of Venice</em>.</p>

<p>No: nothing in the world had changed; yet when he turned round,
he could see on his desk, among the models of rubber stamps, a
scrap of paper.</p>

<p>Did that scrap of paper <em>really</em> exist? He had passed
a feverish night, almost a night of delirium; and at the end of
it he had decided that his strange adventure must have been a
bad dream. But in the morning he had found the scrap of paper
in a drawer of his desk...</p>

<p>Even now he kept saying to himself, "I shall turn round presently;
and the scrap of paper won't be there." He turned round; and the
scrap of paper was there&mdash;<em>in his own handwriting</em>.</p>

<p>He passed his hand over his perspiring brow and heaved the sigh
of a grieved child. Then he seemed to come to a definite resolve
and carefully put the scrap of paper into his pocket-book. He
had just remembered that Signor Petito had a great reputation
as an expert in handwriting. His friend Adolphe was also an expert
in handwriting, but from the Spiritualistic point of view. He
told the character by it. Theophrastus had no intention of calling
Adolphe into counsel. There was already too much mystery in the
affair to entrust it to the overflowing imagination of a medium
who boasted himself a pupil of a Papus.</p>

<p>He went slowly upstairs and was ushered into Signor Petito's
study.</p>

<p>He found himself in the presence of a man of middle age, whose
chief characteristics were a mass of crinkly black hair, a piercing
glance, and enormous ears. After they had exchanged greetings,
Theophrastus broached the subject of the scrap of paper. He drew
it from his pocket-book and an unsigned letter which he had written
a few days previously.</p>

<p>"Signor Petito," he said, "I understand that you are a first-class
expert in handwriting. I should be much obliged if you would examine
this letter and this document, and inform me of the result of
your examination. I assert myself that there is no connection&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short, as red as a peony, for he was not in the habit
of lying. But Signor Petito had already scanned the letter and
the scrap of paper with the eye of an expert; and with a smile
which showed all his exceedingly white teeth, he said:</p>

<p>"I won't keep you waiting for my answer, M. Longuet. The document
is in a very bad state; but the scraps of handwriting one can
read are in every respect the same as the handwriting of the letter.
Before the Courts, M. Longuet, before God and before men, these
two handwritings were traced <em>by the same hand</em>!" He laid
his hand on his heart with a great air.</p>

<p>He entered into particulars: a child, he declared, could not
make a mistake about it. He became oracular.</p>

<p>"The handwriting in both is equally angular," he said in a very
pompous tone. "By angular, M. Longuet, we describe a handwriting
in which the thin strokes which join the strokes of the letters
and the letters to one another are at an acute angle. You understand?
Look at this hook, and this one, and this thin stroke, and all
these letters which increase progressively in equal proportions.
But what an acute handwriting, M. Longuet! I have never seen handwriting
so acute: <em>it's as sharp as the blade of a knife</em>!"</p>

<p>At these last words Theophrastus turned so pale that Signor Petito
thought that he was going to faint. None the less he took the
letter and the document, thanked Signor Petito, and went out of
the flat.</p>

<p>He walked straight out of the house and wandered about the streets
for a long while. At last he found himself in Saint-Andrew-des-Arts
Place; then he took his way to Suger Street, and opened the latch
of an old-fashioned door. He found himself in a dark and dirty
passage. A man came down it to meet him, and recognising him,
greeted him.</p>

<p>"How are you, Theophrastus? What good wind blows you here?" he
said in affectionate tones.</p>

<p>"How are you, Ambrose?" said Theophrastus gloomily.</p>

<p>Since they had not met for two years, they had a hundred inquiries
to make of one another. Ambrose was an engraver of visiting-cards
by profession. He had been a printer in the Provinces; but having
put all his capital into a new invention in printing, it had not
been long before he found himself a bankrupt. He was a cousin
of Marceline; and Theophrastus, who was a good soul, had come
to his aid in the hour of his gravest trouble.</p>

<p>Theophrastus sat down on a straw-seated chair in a little room
which served as workshop, and was lighted by a large, dusty skylight
in the ceiling.</p>

<p>"You 're a scientific man, Ambrose," he said, still gloomily.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind!" said Ambrose quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes; you are. No one could teach you anything in the matter
of paper."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes: that's true enough. I do know paper."</p>

<p>"You know all papers," said Theophrastus.</p>

<p>"All," said Ambrose with modest pride.</p>

<p>"If one showed you a piece of paper you could tell the age of
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have published a monograph on the water-marks of the
papers used in France during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
The Academy crowned it."</p>

<p>"I know it. And I have the fullest confidence in your knowledge
of papers," said Theophrastus with unrelieved gloom.</p>

<p>"It's well-founded; but really it's a very simple matter. The
oldest papers presented at first, when they were new, a smooth,
glossy surface. But soon wire-marks appeared in them, crossed
at regular intervals by perpendicular lines, both reproducing
the impression of the metal trellis on which the paste was spread.
In the fourteenth century they had the idea of utilising this
reproduction by making it a mark of the source or mill which the
paper came from. With this object in view, they embroidered in
brass wire on the trellis mould, initials, words, and all kinds
of emblems: these are the water-marks. Every water-marked sheet
of paper carries in itself its birth-certificate; but the difficulty
is to decipher it. It requires a little practice: the pot, the
eagle, the bell..."</p>

<p>Theophrastus opened his pocket-book and held out his scrap of
paper with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>"Could you tell me the exact age of this document?" he said.</p>

<p>Ambrose put on his spectacles and held the paper up to the light.</p>

<p>"There's a date," he said. "172... The last figure is missing.
It would be a paper of the eighteenth century then. Given the
date within ten years, our task becomes very simple."</p>

<p>"Oh, I saw the date," said Theophrastus quickly. "But is this
really an eighteenth-century paper? Isn't the date false? That's
what I want to know."</p>

<p>Ambrose pointed to the middle of the scrap.</p>

<p>"Look," he said.</p>

<p>Theophrastus looked; but he saw nothing. Then Ambrose lighted
a little lamp and threw its light on the document. In holding
the scrap of paper between one's eyes and the lamp one distinguished
in the middle of it a kind of crown.</p>

<p>"This paper's extremely rare, Theophrastus!" cried Ambrose in
considerable excitement. "This water-mark is almost unknown, for
very little of it was manufactured. The water-mark is called 'The
Crown of Thorns.' This paper, my dear Theophrastus, is exactly
of the year 1721."</p>

<p>"You are sure of it?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. But how comes it that this document, which is dated
1721, is, in every part of it which is visible, in your handwriting?"
cried Ambrose in a tone of amazement.</p>

<p>Theophrastus rose, put the document back into his pocket-book,
and went out on stumbling feet, without answering.</p>

<p>I reproduce from the medley of documents of which his memoirs
are composed the following passage:</p>

<p>"So now," writes Theophrastus, "I had the proof; I could no longer
doubt; I had no longer the right to doubt. This scrap of paper
which dated from the beginning of the eighteenth century, from
the times of the Regent, this sheet which I had found, or rather
<em>had gone to seek</em> in a prison, was truly in my own handwriting.
I had written on this sheet, I, Theophrastus Longuet, late manufacturer
of rubber stamps, who had only retired the week before, at the
age of forty-one years, I had written on this sheet the still
incomprehensible words which I read on it, in 1721! Besides, I
had not really any need of Signor Petito, or of Ambrose, to assure
me of it. All my being cried, 'It's your paper! It's your paper!'"</p>

<p>"So before being Theophrastus Longuet, the son of Jean Longuet,
market-gardener at Ferté-sous-Jouarre, I had been in the past
someone whom I did not know, but who was re-born in me. Yes: every
now and then I 'foamed at the mouth' at remembering that I lived
two hundred years ago!</p>

<p>"Who was I? What was then my name? I had a strange certainty
that these questions would not remain unanswered for long. Was
it not a fact that already things of which in my present existence
I was ignorant, were rising from my past? What did certain phrases
I had uttered at the Conciergerie mean? Who was Simon the Auvergnat,
whose name had risen twice to my burning lips?</p>

<p>"Yes, yes: the name of long ago, <em>my</em> name, would also
rise to my awakening brain; and knowing who I was, I should recall
the whole of my reviving life in the past, and read the document
at a glance."</p>

<p>Theophrastus Longuet might well be troubled in mind. He was a
simple, rather dense, self-satisfied soul who had never believed
in anything but rubber stamps. A good-natured, strictly honest,
narrow-minded and obstinate tradesman, like the bulk of his class
in France he had considered religion only fit for women; and without
declaring himself an unbeliever, he had been wont to say that
when one died one was dead for a long time.</p>

<p>He had just learned in the most convincing, palpable fashion
that <em>one was never dead</em>.</p>

<p>It was indeed a blow. But he took it very well. From the moment
that he remembered having been alive at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, he began to regret that it was not two thousand years
earlier.</p>

<p>That is the nature of the French tradesman; he is full of common
sense; but when he does exaggerate, he passes all bounds.</p>

<p>In his uncertainty about his previous existence he had two definite
facts to start from: the date 1721, and the Conciergerie prison.
These enabled him to affirm that in 1721 he had been confined
in the Conciergerie as a Prisoner of State: he could not admit
for an instant that even in the wicked times of Louis XV he, Theophrastus
Longuet, could possibly have been in prison for an offence against
the Common Law.</p>

<p>Again the scrap of paper gave grounds for certain inferences.
At some desperate conjuncture, possibly on the eve of his execution,
he had written it and hidden it in the wall, to find it on a passing
visit, two centuries later. There was nothing supernatural about
that; it was merely the logical explanation of the facts of the
case.</p>

<p>He betook himself once more to the consideration of the document.
Two words in it seemed to him, naturally, of paramount importance.
They were the words "Betrayal" and "Treasures."</p>

<p>He hoped from these two words to reconstitute his earlier personality.
In the first place, it was plain that he had been rich and powerful.
Only rich men bury treasures; only powerful men are betrayed.
It seemed to him that it must have been a memorable, perhaps historic
betrayal, of <em>the betrayal of the First of April</em>.</p>

<p>Whatever else was mysterious about the document, it was quite
clear that he had been a great personage and had buried treasures.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he said to himself. "Provided that no one has touched
them, those treasures belong to me! If need were, with this document
in my own handwriting I could establish my claim to them."</p>

<p>Theophrastus was not a rich man. He had retired from business
with a moderate competence: a cottage in the country, with its
little garden, its fountain, and its lawn. It was not much, with
Marceline's occasional fits of extravagance. Decidedly the treasures
would come in very useful.</p>

<p>At the same time we must give him the credit of being far more
interested in the mystery of his personality than in the mystery
of the treasures. He decided to postpone his search for them till
he could definitely give a name to the personage who had been
Theophrastus in 1721. To his mind this discovery, which was of
chief interest to him, would be the key to all the rest.</p>

<p>He was somewhat astonished by the sudden disappearance of what
he called his "historical instinct." It had been lacking during
the earlier part of his life; but it had revealed itself to him
in the cellars of the Conciergerie with the suddenness and emphasis
of a clap of thunder. For a while the Other (in his mind he called
the great personage he had been in the eighteenth century the
"Other") had taken possession of him. The Other had been so completely
master of him that he had acted with the Other's hands and spoken
with his voice. It was the Other who had found the document. It
was the Other who had cried, "<em>Zounds! It's Straw Alley!</em>"
It was the Other who had called <em>Simon the Auvergnat</em> and
then had vanished. Theophrastus did not know what had become of
him. He sought in vain. He sounded himself, plumbing the depths
of his being. Nothing!</p>

<p>Theophrastus would not stand it. He had not been troubled all
his life long by any unhealthy curiosity about the beginning or
end of things; he had wasted no time on the mysteries of philosophy.
He had shrugged his shoulders at their futility. But since the
revelation of the extraordinary fact that a man sold rubber stamps
in 1911 after burying treasures in 1721, he swore to go to the
end of the business. He would know. He would know everything.</p>

<p>His "historical instinct" seemed to have left him for the time
being, he would hunt for it in books. He would assuredly end by
finding out who was the mysterious personage who had been shut
up in the Conciergerie in 1721 after having been betrayed on the
First of April. Which First of April? That remained to discover.</p>

<p>Little as the selling of rubber stamps fits man for historical
research, he betook himself to libraries and hunted for that personage.
He studied the lives of the chief men of the period. Since he
was at it, nothing was too grand for him: Princes, Peers, Statesmen,
and Generals, he studied the lives of all. He paused for a while
at the great financier Law, but found him too dissipated; the
same objection applied to the Comte du Barry; and he was positively
horrified by the thought that he might have been the Comte de
Charolais, renowned for his debaucheries, whose hobby was to shoot
thatchers at work on the house-roofs. For forty-eight hours he
was the Cardinal de Polignac before he was disgusted to learn
that that great Churchman had not been a man of stainless virtue.
Whenever he did find a person whom the historians painted in the
most engaging colours and adorned with the most solid virtues,
that personage invariably disobliged him by not having been shut
up in the Conciergerie or betrayed on the First of April.</p>

<p>However he had just discovered, <em>in the Journal de Barbier</em>,
a favourite of the Regent who, strangely enough, was exactly the
man he was looking for, when there came a development of his case
which plunged him into a profound consternation.</p>

<p>He had sent Marceline down to his country cottage on the banks
of the Marne, to which it was their habit to betake themselves
at the beginning of July; and Adolphe had gone down to the village
inn, to help her get it in order for their stay. Their absence
left him freer to prosecute his researches. Then on the morning
of the anniversary of his wedding-day he went down to join them
at the cottage. He had called it "Azure Waves Villa," in spite
of the remonstrances of Adolphe, who had urged that such a name
was only suitable to a cottage by the sea. Theophrastus had been
firm in the matter because, he declared, he had often been to
Treport, and the sea was always green; whereas, fishing for gudgeon
in the Marne, he had frequently observed that its waves were blue.</p>

<p>He found his wife and friend awaiting him eagerly on its threshold;
and as with the air of a favourite of the Regent, he complimented
Marceline on her charming appearance, he gracefully waved his
green umbrella, from which he seldom allowed himself to be parted,
in the fashion in which he believed the dandies waved their canes
at the beginning of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>He found the household in the stress of the preparations for
the anniversary dinner, to which several of his friends in the
neighbourhood brought their wives to do honour to Theophrastus
and Marceline.</p>

<p>Still the favourite of the Regent, to the astonishment of Marceline
and Adolphe, he found a few gracious words of compliment for each
guest. Neither of them had ever seen him so shine as host before.</p>

<p>They dined in a tent in the garden; and the talk at once turned
on fishing, a sport to which they were all devoted; and they did
their best to be accurate about their exploits. M. Lopard had
caught a three-pound pike; old Mlle. Taburet complained bitterly
that someone had been fishing in her favourite pool; a third declared
that the fish were being overfed; and there was a long discussion
on ground-bait.</p>

<p>Theophrastus said nothing: he suddenly found these good people
too middle-class for him. He would have liked to raise the level
of the conversation; and he would have preferred it to deal with
the matters which filled his fevered imagination.</p>

<p>Towards the end of dinner he found a way to set Adolphe talking
of ghosts. Then Madame Lopard told them of the extraordinary doings
of a somnambulist who lived near; and at once Adolphe explained
the phenomena of somnambulism according to the Spiritualistic
theory, and quoted Allan Kardec. Adolphe was never at a loss to
explain "phenomena." Then, at last, they came to the matter to
which Theophrastus was burning to bring them, the Transmigration
of Souls.</p>

<p>Marceline observed that our reason rejected the hypothesis; and
Adolphe protested vigorously: "Nothing is lost in nature," he
said authoritatively. "Everything is transformed, souls and bodies
alike. The transmigration of souls with a view to their purification
is a belief which goes back to the remotest antiquity; and the
philosophers of all ages have been careful not to deny it."</p>

<p>"But if one came back into a body, one would know it," said Marceline.</p>

<p>"Not always, only sometimes," said Adolphe confidently.</p>

<p>"Sometimes? Is that so?" said Theophrastus quickly; and his heart
began to beat tumultuously.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes: there are instances&mdash;authentic instances," said Adolphe
emphatically. "Ptolemy Cæsarion, Cleopatra's son and King of Egypt
thirty years before Christ, recollected perfectly that he had
been the philosopher Pythagoras who lived six hundred years before
him."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried the ladies; and the men smiled with an air
of superior wisdom.</p>

<p>"It's nothing to laugh at, gentlemen. It's the most serious subject
in the world," said Adolphe sternly. "The actual transformation
of our bodies which is the last word in Science, is in entire
accord with the theory of Reincarnation. What is this theory of
transformation except that living beings <em>transform themselves
into one another</em>? Nature for ever presents herself to us
as a creative flame unceasingly perfecting types, on her way to
the attainment of an ideal which will be the final crown of the
Law of Progress. Since Nature has only one aim, what she does
for bodies, she does also for souls. I can assure you that this
is the case, for I have studied this question, which is the very
foundation of all sound Science."</p>

<p>None of the party understood Adolphe's discourse, a fact which
filled him with quiet pride; but they listened to him in an ecstasy;
and he was pleased to see that Theophrastus, as a rule so restive
under such discussions, was listening with the liveliest interest.
It was an attitude hardly to be wondered at in a man who was hearing
that what seemed a wild imagining of his delirium rested on a
firm scientific basis.</p>

<p>"The transmigration of souls was taught in India, the cradle
of the human race," Adolphe continued in his most professorial
tone, delighted to have caught the ear of the party. "Then it
was taught in Egypt, then in Greece by Pythagoras. Plato took
the doctrine from him; and adduced irrefutable proofs in his Phædo
that souls do not pass into eternal exile but return to animate
new bodies."</p>

<p>"Oh, if we could only have proofs of a fact like that!" cried
Madame Sampic, the wife of the schoolmaster of Pont-aux-Dames,
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"If we had, I shouldn't mind dying one bit," said old Mlle. Taburet,
who was in mortal fear of her approaching end.</p>

<p>"There <em>are</em> proofs&mdash;irrefutable proofs," said Adolphe
solemnly. "There are two: one drawn from the general order of
Nature, one from human consciousness. Firstly, Nature is governed
by the law of contradictions, says Plato, meaning by that that
when we see in her bosom death succeed life we are compelled to
believe that life succeeds death. Is that clear to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," cried several of the guests, without understanding
a word he was saying.</p>

<p>"Moreover, Plato continues, since nothing can be born from nothing,
if the beings we see die were never to return to life, everything
would end by becoming absorbed in death, and Nature would be moving
towards an eternal sleep. Have I made this first proof clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes: the second!" cried his fellow guests, quite untruthfully.</p>

<p>"Secondly," said Adolphe, growing absolutely pontifical, "when,
after having observed the general laws of the Universe, we descend
into the depths of our own being, we find the same dogma confirmed
by the fact of memory. 'To learn,' cries Plato to the Universe,
'To learn is nothing else but to remember.' Since our soul learns,
it is that it remembers. And what does it remember if not that
it has lived before, and that it has lived in another body? 'Why
should we not believe that in quitting the body which it animates
at the moment, it must animate several others in succession?'
I am quoting Plato word for word," said Adolphe in a tone of ringing
triumph.</p>

<p>"And Plato is a person to be reckoned with," said Theophrastus
warmly.</p>

<p>"Charles Fourier says," said Adolphe, moving on to the modern,
"Where is the old man who does not desire not to be certain of
carrying into another life the experience he has acquired in this
one? To assert that this desire can never be realised is to admit
that the Deity would deceive us. We must then recognise that we
have lived already, before being what we are to-day, and that
many more lives await us. All these lives &mdash;Fourier adds
with a precision for which we cannot be sufficiently thankful&mdash;to
the number of a hundred and ten are distributed over five stages
of unequal extent and cover a period of eighty-one thousand years."</p>

<p>"Eighty-one thousand years! That's pretty filling!" interrupted
M. Lopard.</p>

<p>"We spend twenty-seven thousand of them on our planet and the
other fifty-four thousand elsewhere," explained Adolphe.</p>

<p>"And how long is it before we come back into another body?" asked
Madame Bache.</p>

<p>"At least two or three thousand years, if we are to believe Allan
Kardec, always supposing that we have not died a violent death.
Then, especially if one has been executed, one may be reincarnated
at the end of two hundred years," said Adolphe.</p>

<p>"That's it! They must have hanged me," said Theophrastus to himself.
"Or if they didn't hang a man of my quality, they beheaded me.
All the same," he went on to think, with a natural pride, "if
these people here knew that they were sitting with a favourite
of the Regent, or perhaps a Prince of Royal blood, how astonished
and respectful they'd be! But not a bit of it: they are merely
saying to themselves, 'It's Theophrastus Longuet, manufacturer
of rubber stamps'; and that's enough for them."</p>

<p>The advent of the two waiters with the champagne cut short the
dissertation of Adolphe; and though everyone had been deeply impressed
by it, now they only wished to be amused.</p>

<p>It was then that Marceline turned to Theophrastus and begged
him to sing the song with which he was wont to delight their ears
at dessert on each anniversary of their wedding-day. He had sung
it on their wedding-day itself; and thanks to its charm and freshness,
it had been a great success. It was Beranger's <em>Lisette</em>.</p>

<p>But what was the amazement of Marceline and all the guests, when
Theophrastus sprang to his feet, threw his napkin on the table,
and bawled to the mistress of the house:</p>

<p>"As you will, <em>Marie-Antoinette</em>! I can refuse you nothing!"</p>

<p>"Gracious goodness! <em>That voice of his has come back!</em>"
gasped Marceline.</p>

<p>The guests had not recovered from the shock when Theophrastus
bawled to an old French air, in a voice which none of them recognised
as his, his voice of the Conciergerie, bawled to the most select
society from Crécy-en-Brie to Lagny-Thorigny-Pomponne:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Bullies all! In our snug cribs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live like fighting-cocks:<br/>
&nbsp;On dainties rich we splash the dibbs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And booze we never docks.<br/>
&nbsp;Then guzzle, cullies, and booze away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Gabriel's trump on Judgment Day!"

</p>
</div>
<p>In spite of the richness of the rhyme, no applause followed the
stanza. The ladies did not clink their glasses with their knives;
they stared at Theophrastus with their eyes starting out of their
heads; and the eyes of Marceline projected furthest of all.</p>

<p>Theophrastus did not need any applause; like one possessed of
a devil, he bawled on:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Bullies all! In our snug cribs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan Cupid loves to dance.<br/>
&nbsp;He brings to help us splash the dibbs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prettiest silk in France.<br/>
&nbsp;Then guzzle, cullies, and booze away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Gabriel's trump on Judgment Day!"

</p>
</div>
<p>In a final triumphant roar he repeated the last couplet and prolonged
the final note, his eyes on the sun, which was sinking over the
edge of the horizon, laid one hand on his heart, embraced "Nature"
with a sweeping gesture of the other, and bellowed:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Then guzzle, cullies, and booze away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Gabriel's trump on Judgment Day!"

</p>
</div>
<p>He sat down with an air of supreme content, and said proudly:</p>

<p>"<em>What do you think of that, Marie-Antoinette?</em>"</p>

<p>"Why do you call me Marie-Antoinette?" gasped the trembling Marceline.</p>

<p>"Because you're the prettiest of them all!" roared Theophrastus
in that awful voice. "I appeal to Madame la Maréchale de Boufflers,
who's a woman of taste! I appeal to all of you! And there's not
one of you, by the Pope's gullet, who'll dare to deny it! Neither
the big Picard, nor the Bourbonnais, nor the Burgundian, nor Sheep's-head,
nor the Cracksman, nor Parisian, nor the Provincial, nor the little
Breton, nor the Feather, nor Patapon, nor Pint-pot, nor St. James's
Gate, nor Gastelard, nor Iron-arm, nor Black-mug, nor even Fancy
Man!"</p>

<p>Since Theophrastus had on his right old Mlle. Taburet, he prodded
her in the ribs by way of emphasis, an action which nearly made
her faint.</p>

<p>No one dared budge; his flaming eye chained them to their chairs;
and leaning affectionately towards Mlle. Taburet, he pointed to
the gasping Marceline, and said:</p>

<p>"Look, Mlle. Taburet, aren't I right? Who can compare with her?
Pretty-Milkmaid, of Pussycat? Or even Blanche, the Bustler? Or
Belle-Hélène who keeps the Harp tavern?"</p>

<p>He turned towards Adolphe.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;you&mdash;old Easy-Going!" he said with a terrifying energy.
"Let's have your opinion. Look at Marie-Antoinette a moment! By
the Sucking-pig! there's not one to compare with her: not Jenny
Venus, the flower-seller of the Palais-Royal, nor Marie Leroy,
nor mother Salomon, the pretty coffee-house-keeper of the Temple,
nor Jenny Bonnefoy <em>who's just married Veunier who keeps the
Pont-Marie café</em>. Not one of them, I tell you! Not one of
them! The Slapper, Manon de Versailles, Fat-Poulteress, the Lock,
Cow-with-the-Baskets, or the Bastille!"</p>

<p>With a bound Theophrastus was on the table; and the crockery
round him smashed into a thousand pieces. He caught up a glass
and bellowed:</p>

<p>"I drink to the queen of the nymphs! Marie-Antoinette Neron!"</p>

<p>He crushed the glass in his hands, cutting them in twenty places,
and bowed to the company.</p>

<p>But the company had fled.</p>
