<p> The British navy may well have ceased to count its victories. 
It is rich beyond the wildest dreams of success and fame.  It
may well, rather, on a culminating day of its history, cast about
for the memory of some reverses to appease the jealous fates which
attend the prosperity and triumphs of a nation.  It holds, indeed,
the heaviest inheritance that has ever been entrusted to the courage
and fidelity of armed men.</p>

<p>It is too great for mere pride.  It should make the seamen of
to-day humble in the secret of their hearts, and indomitable in
their unspoken resolution.  In all the records of history there
has never been a time when a victorious fortune has been so faithful
to men making war upon the sea.  And it must be confessed that
on their part they knew how to be faithful to their victorious
fortune.  They were exalted.  They were always watching for her
smile; night or day, fair weather or foul, they waited for her
slightest sign with the offering of their stout hearts in their
hands.  And for the inspiration of this high constancy they were
indebted to Lord Nelson alone.  Whatever earthly affection he
abandoned or grasped, the great Admiral was always, before all,
beyond all, a lover of Fame.  He loved her jealously, with an
inextinguishable ardour and an insatiable desire—he loved her
with a masterful devotion and an infinite trustfulness.  In the
plenitude of his passion he was an exacting lover. And she never
betrayed the greatness of his trust!  She attended him to the
end of his life, and he died pressing her last gift (nineteen
prizes) to his heart.  "Anchor, Hardy—anchor!" was as much the
cry of an ardent lover as of a consummate seaman.  Thus he would
hug to his breast the last gift of Fame.</p>

<p>It was this ardour which made him great.  He was a flaming example
to the wooers of glorious fortune.  There have been great officers
before—Lord Hood, for instance, whom he himself regarded as the
greatest sea officer England ever had.  A long succession of great
commanders opened the sea to the vast range of Nelson’s genius. 
His time had come; and, after the great sea officers, the great
naval tradition passed into the keeping of a great man.  Not the
least glory of the navy is that it understood Nelson.  Lord Hood
trusted him.  Admiral Keith told him: "We can’t spare you either
as Captain or Admiral."  Earl St. Vincent put into his hands,
untrammelled by orders, a division of his fleet, and Sir Hyde
Parker gave him two more ships at Copenhagen than he had asked
for.  So much for the chiefs; the rest of the navy surrendered
to him their devoted affection, trust, and admiration.  In return
he gave them no less than his own exalted soul.  He breathed into
them his own ardour and his own ambition. In a few short years
he revolutionized, not the strategy or tactics of sea-warfare,
but the very conception of victory itself.  And this is genius. 
In that alone, through the fidelity of his fortune and the power
of his inspiration, he stands unique amongst the leaders of fleets
and sailors.  He brought heroism into the line of duty.  Verily
he is a terrible ancestor.</p>

<p>And the men of his day loved him.  They loved him not only as
victorious armies have loved great commanders; they loved him
with a more intimate feeling as one of themselves.  In the words
of a contemporary, he had "a most happy way of gaining the affectionate
respect of all who had the felicity to serve under his command."</p>

<p>To be so great and to remain so accessible to the affection of
one’s fellow-men is the mark of exceptional humanity.  Lord Nelson’s
greatness was very human.  It had a moral basis; it needed to
feel itself surrounded by the warm devotion of a band of brothers. 
He was vain and tender.  The love and admiration which the navy
gave him so unreservedly soothed the restlessness of his professional
pride.  He trusted them as much as they trusted him.  He was a
seaman of seamen.  Sir T. B. Martin states that he never conversed
with any officer who had served under Nelson "without hearing
the heartiest expressions of attachment to his person and admiration
of his frank and conciliatory manner to his subordinates."  And
Sir Robert Stopford, who commanded one of the ships with which
Nelson chased to the West Indies a fleet nearly double in number,
says in a letter: "We are half-starved and otherwise inconvenienced
by being so long out of port, but our reward is that we are with
Nelson."</p>

<p>This heroic spirit of daring and endurance, in which all public
and private differences were sunk throughout the whole fleet,
is Lord Nelson’s great legacy, triply sealed by the victorious
impress of the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar.  This is a legacy
whose value the changes of time cannot affect.  The men and the
ships he knew how to lead lovingly to the work of courage and
the reward of glory have passed away, but Nelson’s uplifting touch
remains in the standard of achievement he has set for all time. 
The principles of strategy may be immutable.  It is certain they
have been, and shall be again, disregarded from timidity, from
blindness, through infirmity of purpose.  The tactics of great
captains on land and sea can be infinitely discussed.  The first
object of tactics is to close with the adversary on terms of the
greatest possible advantage; yet no hard-and-fast rules can be
drawn from experience, for this capital reason, amongst others—that
the quality of the adversary is a variable element in the problem. 
The tactics of Lord Nelson have been amply discussed, with much
pride and some profit.  And yet, truly, they are already of but
archaic interest.  A very few years more and the hazardous difficulties
of handling a fleet under canvas shall have passed beyond the
conception of seamen who hold in trust for their country Lord
Nelson’s legacy of heroic spirit.  The change in the character
of the ships is too great and too radical.  It is good and proper
to study the acts of great men with thoughtful reverence, but
already the precise intention of Lord Nelson’s famous memorandum
seems to lie under that veil which Time throws over the clearest
conceptions of every great art.  It must not be forgotten that
this was the first time when Nelson, commanding in chief, had
his opponents under way—the first time and the last.  Had he lived,
had there been other fleets left to oppose him, we would, perhaps,
have learned something more of his greatness as a sea officer. 
Nothing could have been added to his greatness as a leader.  All
that can be affirmed is, that on no other day of his short and
glorious career was Lord Nelson more splendidly true to his genius
and to his country’s fortune.</p>
