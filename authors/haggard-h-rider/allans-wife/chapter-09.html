<p>It is very difficult for me to describe the period of time which elapsed
between my arrival at Babyan’s Peak and my marriage with Stella. When I
look back on it, it seems sweet as with the odour of flowers, and dim
as with the happy dusk of summer eves, while through the sweetness comes
the sound of Stella’s voice, and through the gloom shines the starlight
of her eyes. I think that we loved each other from the first, though for
a while we said no word of love. Day by day I went about the place with
her, accompanied by little Tota and Hendrika only, while she attended
to the thousand and one matters which her father’s ever-growing weakness
had laid upon her; or rather, as time drew on, I attended to the
business, and she accompanied me. All day through we were together. Then
after supper, when the night had fallen, we would walk together in the
garden and come at length to hear her father read aloud sometimes from
the works of a poet, sometimes from history. Or, if he did not feel
well, Stella would read, and when this was done, Mr. Carson would
celebrate a short form of prayer, and we would separate till the morning
once more brought our happy hour of meeting.
</p><p>So the weeks went by, and with every week I grew to know my darling
better. Often, I wonder now, if my fond fancy deceives me, or if indeed
there are women as sweet and dear as she. Was it solitude that had given
such depth and gentleness to her? Was it the long years of communing
with Nature that had endowed her with such peculiar grace, the grace we
find in opening flowers and budding trees? Had she caught that murmuring
voice from the sound of the streams which fall continually about her
rocky home? was it the tenderness of the evening sky beneath which she
loved to walk, that lay like a shadow on her face, and the light of the
evening stars that shone in her quiet eyes? At the least to me she was
the realization of that dream which haunts the sleep of sin-stained men;
so my memory paints her, so I hope to find her when at last the sleep
has rolled away and the fevered dreams are done.
</p><p>At last there came a day--the most blessed of my life, when we told our
love. We had been together all the morning, but after dinner Mr. Carson
was so unwell that Stella stopped in with him. At supper we met again,
and after supper, when she had put little Tota, to whom she had grown
much attached, to bed, we went out, leaving Mr. Carson dozing on the
couch.
</p><p>The night was warm and lovely, and without speaking we walked up the
garden to the orange grove and sat down upon a rock. There was a little
breeze which shook the petals of the orange blooms over us in showers,
and bore their delicate fragrance far and wide. Silence reigned around,
broken only by the sound of the falling waterfalls that now died to a
faint murmur, and now, as the wavering breeze turned, boomed loudly
in our ears. The moon was not yet visible, but already the dark clouds
which floated through the sky above us--for there had been rain--showed
a glow of silver, telling us that she shone brightly behind the peak.
Stella began to talk in her low, gentle voice, speaking to me of her
life in the wilderness, how she had grown to love it, how her mind had
gone on from idea to idea, and how she pictured the great rushing world
that she had never seen as it was reflected to her from the books which
she had read. It was a curious vision of life that she had: things were
out of proportion to it; it was more like a dream than a reality--a
mirage than the actual face of things. The idea of great cities, and
especially of London, had a kind of fascination for her: she could
scarcely realize the rush, the roar and hurry, the hard crowds of men
and women, strangers to each other, feverishly seeking for wealth and
pleasure beneath a murky sky, and treading one another down in the fury
of their competition.
</p><p>“What is it all for?” she asked earnestly. “What do they seek? Having so
few years to live, why do they waste them thus?”
</p><p>I told her that in the majority of instances it was actual hard
necessity that drove them on, but she could barely understand me. Living
as she had done, in the midst of the teeming plenty of a fruitful earth,
she did not seem to be able to grasp the fact that there were millions
who from day to day know not how to stay their hunger.
</p><p>“I never want to go there,” she went on; “I should be bewildered and
frightened to death. It is not natural to live like that. God put Adam
and Eve in a garden, and that is how he meant their children to live--in
peace, and looking always on beautiful things. This is my idea of
perfect life. I want no other.”
</p><p>“I thought you once told me that you found it lonely,” I said.
</p><p>“So I did,” she answered, innocently, “but that was before you came. Now
I am not lonely any more, and it is perfect--perfect as the night.”
</p><p>Just then the full moon rose above the elbow of the peak, and her
rays stole far and wide down the misty valley, gleaming on the water,
brooding on the plain, searching out the hidden places of the rocks,
wrapping the fair form of nature as in a silver bridal veil through
which her beauty shone mysteriously.
</p><p>Stella looked down the terraced valley; she turned and looked up at the
scarred face of the golden moon, and then she looked at me. The beauty
of the night was about her face, the scent of the night was on her hair,
the mystery of the night shone in her shadowed eyes. She looked at me, I
looked on her, and all our hearts’ love blossomed within us. We spoke no
word--we had no words to speak, but slowly we drew near, till lips were
pressed to lips as we kissed our eternal troth.
</p><p>It was she who broke that holy silence, speaking in a changed voice,
in soft deep notes that thrilled me like the lowest chords of a smitten
harp.
</p><p>“Ah, now I understand,” she said, “now I know why we are lonely, and how
we can lose our loneliness. Now I know what it is that stirs us in the
beauty of the sky, in the sound of water and in the scent of flowers.
It is Love who speaks in everything, though till we hear his voice we
understand nothing. But when we hear, then the riddle is answered and
the gates of our heart are opened, and, Allan, we see the way that wends
through death to heaven, and is lost in the glory of which our love is
but a shadow.
</p><p>“Let us go in, Allan. Let us go before the spell breaks, so that
whatever overtakes us, sorrow, death, or separation, we may always have
this perfect memory to save us. Come, dearest, let us go!”
</p><p>I rose like a man in a dream, still holding her by the hand. But as I
rose my eye fell upon something that gleamed white among the foliage
of the orange bush at my side. I said nothing, but looked. The breeze
stirred the orange leaves, the moonlight struck for a moment full upon
the white object.
</p><p>It was the face of Hendrika, the Babyan-woman, as Indaba-zimbi had
called her, and on it was a glare of hate that made me shudder.
</p><p>I said nothing; the face vanished, and just then I heard a baboon bark
in the rocks behind.
</p><p>Then we went down the garden, and Stella passed into the centre hut. I
saw Hendrika standing in the shadow near the door, and went up to her.
</p><p>“Hendrika,” I said, “why were you watching Miss Stella and myself in the
garden?”
</p><p>She drew her lips up till her teeth gleamed in the moonlight.
</p><p>“Have I not watched her these many years, Macumazahn? Shall I cease to
watch because a wandering white man comes to steal her? Why were you
kissing her in the garden, Macumazahn? How dare you kiss her who is a
star?”
</p><p>“I kissed her because I love her, and because she loves me,” I answered.
“What has that to do with you, Hendrika?”
</p><p>“Because you love her,” she hissed in answer; “and do I not love her
also, who saved me from the babyans? I am a woman as she is, and you are
a man, and they say in the kraals that men love women better than women
love women. But it is a lie, though this is true, that if a woman loves
a man she forgets all other love. Have I not seen it? I gather her
flowers--beautiful flowers; I climb the rocks where you would never dare
to go to find them; you pluck a piece of orange bloom in the garden and
give it to her. What does she do?--she takes the orange bloom, she puts
it in her breast, and lets my flowers die. I call to her--she does not
hear me--she is thinking. You whisper to some one far away, and she
hears and smiles. She used to kiss me sometimes; now she kisses that
white brat you brought, because you brought it. Oh, I see it all--all; I
have seen it from the first; you are stealing her from us, stealing her
to yourself, and those who loved her before you came are forgotten. Be
careful, Macumazahn, be careful, lest I am revenged upon you. You, you
hate me; you think me half a monkey; that servant of yours calls me
Baboon-woman. Well, I have lived with baboons, and they are clever--yes,
they can play tricks and know things that you don’t, and I am cleverer
than they, for I have learnt the wisdom of white people also, and I say
to you, Walk softly, Macumazahn, or you will fall into a pit,” and with
one more look of malice she was gone.
</p><p>I stood for a moment reflecting. I was afraid of this strange creature
who seemed to combine the cunning of the great apes that had reared
her with the passions and skill of human kind. I foreboded evil at her
hands. And yet there was something almost touching in the fierceness of
her jealousy. It is generally supposed that this passion only exists in
strength when the object loved is of another sex from the lover, but I
confess that, both in this instance and in some others which I have met
with, this has not been my experience. I have known men, and especially
uncivilized men, who were as jealous of the affection of their friend
or master as any lover could be of that of his mistress; and who has
not seen cases of the same thing where parents and their children are
concerned? But the lower one gets in the scale of humanity, the more
readily this passion thrives; indeed, it may be said to come to its
intensest perfection in brutes. Women are more jealous than men,
small-hearted men are more jealous than those of larger mind and wider
sympathy, and animals are the most jealous of all. Now Hendrika was in
some ways not far removed from animal, which may perhaps account for the
ferocity of her jealousy of her mistress’s affection.
</p><p>Shaking off my presentiments of evil, I entered the centre hut. Mr.
Carson was resting on the sofa, and by him knelt Stella holding his
hand, and her head resting on his breast. I saw at once that she had
been telling him of what had come about between us; nor was I sorry,
for it is a task that a would-be son-in-law is generally glad to do by
deputy.
</p><p>“Come here, Allan Quatermain,” he said, almost sternly, and my heart
gave a jump, for I feared lest he might be about to require me to go
about my business. But I came.
</p><p>“Stella tells me,” he went on, “that you two have entered into a
marriage engagement. She tells me also that she loves you, and that you
say that you love her.”
</p><p>“I do indeed, sir,” I broke in; “I love her truly; if ever a woman was
loved in this world, I love her.”
</p><p>“I thank Heaven for it,” said the old man. “Listen, my children. Many
years ago a great shame and sorrow fell upon me, so great a sorrow that,
as I sometimes think, it affected my brain. At any rate, I determined
to do what most men would have considered the act of a madman, to go far
away into the wilderness with my only child, there to live remote from
civilization and its evils. I did so; I found this place, and here we
have lived for many years, happily enough, and perhaps not without doing
good in our generation, but still in a way unnatural to our race and
status. At first I thought I would let my daughter grow up in a state of
complete ignorance, that she should be Nature’s child. But as time went
on, I saw the folly and the wickedness of my plan. I had no right to
degrade her to the level of the savages around me, for if the fruit
of the tree of knowledge is a bitter fruit, still it teaches good from
evil. So I educated her as well as I was able, till in the end I knew
that in mind, as in body, she was in no way inferior to her sisters, the
children of the civilized world. She grew up and entered into womanhood,
and then it came into my mind that I was doing her a bitter wrong, that
I was separating her from her kind and keeping her in a wilderness where
she could find neither mate nor companion. But though I knew this, I
could not yet make up my mind to return to active life; I had grown to
love this place. I dreaded to return into the world I had abjured. Again
and again I put my resolutions aside. Then at the commencement of this
year I fell ill. For a while I waited, hoping that I might get better,
but at last I realized that I should never get better, that the hand of
Death was upon me.”
</p><p>“Ah, no, father, not that!” Stella said, with a cry.
</p><p>“Yes, love, that, and it is true. Now you will be able to forget our
separation in the happiness of a new meeting,” and he glanced at me
and smiled. “Well, when this knowledge came home to me, I determined to
abandon this place and trek for the coast, though I well knew that
the journey would kill me. I should never live to reach it. But Stella
would, and it would be better than leaving her here alone with savages
in the wilderness. On the very day that I had made up my mind to take
this step Stella found you dying in the Bad Lands, Allan Quatermain, and
brought you here. She brought you, of all men in the world, you, whose
father had been my dear friend, and who once with your baby hands had
saved her life from fire, that she might live to save yours from thirst.
At the time I said little, but I saw the hand of Providence in this, and
I determined to wait and see what came about between you. At the worst,
if nothing came about, I soon learned that I could trust you to see her
safely to the coast after I was gone. But many days ago I knew how it
stood between you, and now things are determined as I prayed they might
be. God bless you both, my children; may you be happy in your love;
may it endure till death and beyond it. God bless you both!” and he
stretched out his hand towards me.
</p><p>I took it, and Stella kissed him.
</p><p>Presently he spoke again--
</p><p>“It is my intention,” he said, “if you two consent, to marry you next
Sunday. I wish to do so soon, for I do not know how much longer will be
allowed to me. I believe that such a ceremony, solemnly celebrated
and entered into before witnesses, will, under the circumstances, be
perfectly legal; but of course you will repeat it with every formality
the first moment it lies in your power so to do. And now, there is
one more thing: when I left England my fortunes were in a shattered
condition; in the course of years they have recovered themselves,
the accumulated rents, as I heard but recently, when the waggons last
returned from Port Natal, have sufficed to pay off all charges, and
there is a considerable balance over. Consequently you will not marry on
nothing, for of course you, Stella, are my heiress, and I wish to make
a stipulation. It is this. That so soon as my death occurs you should
leave this place and take the first opportunity of returning to England.
I do not ask you to live there always; it might prove too much for
people reared in the wilds, as both of you have been; but I do ask you
to make it your permanent home. Do you consent and promise this?”
</p><p>“I do,” I answered.
</p><p>“And so do I,” said Stella.
</p><p>“Very well,” he answered; “and now I am tired out. Again God bless you
both, and good-night.”
