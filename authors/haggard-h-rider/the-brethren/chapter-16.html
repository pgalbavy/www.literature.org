<p>In the third morning Godwin awoke to see the ray of sunrise
streaming through the latticed window.
</p>
<p>They fell upon another bed near-by where Wulf still lay sleeping,
a bandage on his head that had been hurt in the last charge
against the Assassins, and other bandages about his arms and
body, which were much bruised in the fight upon the dreadful
bridge.
</p><p>Wondrous was it to Godwin to watch him lying there sleeping
healthily, notwithstanding his injuries, and to think of what
they had gone through together with so little harm; to think,
also, of how they had rescued Rosamund out of the very mouth of
that earthly hell of which he could see the peaks through the
open window-place--out of the very hands of that fiend, its
ruler. Reckoning the tale day by day, he reflected on their
adventures since they landed at Beirut, and saw how Heaven had
guided their every step.
</p><p>In face of the warnings that were given them, to visit the
Al-je-bal in his stronghold had seemed a madness. Yet there,
where none could have thought that she would be, they had found
Rosamund. There they had been avenged upon the false knight Sir
Hugh Lozelle, who had betrayed her, first to Saladin, then to
Sinan, and sent him down to death and judgment; and thence they
had rescued Rosamund.
</p><p>Oh, how wise they had been to obey the dying words of their
uncle, Sir Andrew, who doubtless was given foresight at the end!
God and His saints had helped them, who could not have helped
themselves, and His minister had been Masouda. But for Masouda,
Rosamund would by now be lost or dead, and they, if their lives
were still left to them, would be wanderers in the great land of
Syria, seeking for one who never could be found.
</p><p>Why had Masouda done these things, again and again putting her
own life upon the hazard to save theirs and the honour of another
woman? As he asked himself the question Godwin felt the red blood
rise to his face. Because she hated Sinan, who had murdered her
parents and degraded her, she said; and doubtless that had to do
with the matter. But it was no longer possible to hide the truth.
She loved him, and had loved him from the first hour when they
met. He had always suspected it--in that wild trial of the horses
upon the mountain side, when she sat with her arms about him and
her face pressed against his face; when she kissed his feet after
he had saved her from the lion, and many another time.
</p><p>But as they followed Wulf and Rosamund up the mountain pass while
the host of the Assassins thundered at their heels, and in broken
gasps she had told him of her sad history, then it was that he
grew sure. Then, too, he had said that he held her not vile, but
noble, as indeed he did; and, thinking their death upon them, she
had answered that she held him dear, and looked on him as a woman
looks upon her only love--a message in her eyes that no man could
fail to read. Yet if this were so, why had Masouda saved
Rosamund, the lady to whom she knew well that he was sworn?
Reared among those cruel folk who could wade to their desire
through blood and think it honour, would she not have left her
rival to her doom, seeing that oaths do not hold beyond the
grave?
</p><p>An answer came into the heart of Godwin, at the very thought of
which he turned pale and trembled. His brother was also sworn to
Rosamund, and she in her soul must be sworn to one of them. Was
it not to Wulf, Wulf who was handsomer and more strong than he,
to Wulf, the conqueror of Lozelle? Had Rosamund told Masouda
this? Nay, surely not.
</p><p>Yet women can read each other's hearts, piercing veils through
which no man may see, and perchance Masouda had read the heart of
Rosamund. She stood behind her during the dreadful duel at the
gate, and watched her face when Wulf's death seemed sure; she
might have heard words that broke in agony from her lips in those
moments of torment.
</p><p>Oh, without doubt it was so, and Masouda had protected Rosamund
because she knew that her love was for Wulf and not for him. The
thought was very bitter, and in its pain Godwin groaned aloud,
while a fierce jealousy of the brave and handsome knight who
slept at his side, dreaming, doubtless, of the fame that he had
won and the reward by which it would be crowned, gripped his
vitals like the icy hand of death. Then Godwin remembered the
oath that they two had sworn far away in the Priory at Stangate,
and the love passing the love of woman which he bore towards this
brother, and the duty of a Christian warrior whereto he was
vowed, and hiding his face in his pillow he prayed for strength.
</p><p>It would seem that it came to him--at least, when he lifted his
head again the jealousy was gone, and only the great grief
remained. Fear remained also--for what of Masouda? How should he
deal with her? He was certain that this was no fancy which would
pass--until her life passed with it, and, beautiful as she was,
and noble as she was, he did not wish her love. He could find no
answer to these questions, save this--that things must go on as
they were decreed. For himself, he, Godwin, would strive to do
his duty, to keep his hands clean, and await the end, whatever
that might be.
</p><p>Wulf woke up, stretched his arms, exclaimed because that action
hurt him, grumbled at the brightness of the light upon his eyes,
and said that he was very hungry. Then he arose, and with the
help of Godwin, dressed himself, but not in his armour. Here,
with the yellow-coated soldiers of Saladin, grave-faced and
watchful, pacing before their door--for night and day they were
trebly guarded lest Assassins should creep in--there was no need
for mail. In the fortress of Masyaf, indeed, where they were also
guarded, it had been otherwise. Wulf heard the step of the
sentries on the cemented pavement without, and shook his great
shoulders as though he shivered.
</p><p>"That sound makes my backbone cold," he said. "For a moment, as
my eyes opened, I thought that we were back again in the guest
chambers of Al-je-bal, where folk crept round us as we slept and
murderers marched to and fro outside the curtains, fingering
their knife-points. Well, whatever there is to come, thank the
Saints, that is done with. I tell you, brother, I have had enough
of mountains, and narrow bridges, and Assassins. Henceforth, I
desire to live upon a flat with never a hill in sight, amidst
honest folk as stupid as their own sheep, who go to church on
Sundays and get drunk, not with hachich, but on brown ale,
brought to them by no white-robed sorceress, but by a
draggle-tailed wench in a tavern, with her musty bedstraw still
sticking in her hair. Give me the Saltings of Essex with the east
winds blowing over them, and the primroses abloom upon the bank,
and the lanes fetlock deep in mud, and for your share you may
take all the scented gardens of Sinan and the cups and jewels of
his ladies, with the fightings and adventures of the golden East
thrown in."
</p><p>"I never sought these things, and we are a long way from Essex,"
answered Godwin shortly.
</p><p>"No," said Wulf, "but they seem to seek you. What news of
Masouda? Have you seen her while I slept, which has been long?"
</p><p>"I have seen no one except the apothecary who tended you, the
slaves who brought us food, and last evening the prince Hassan,
who came to see how we fared. He told me that, like yourself,
Rosamund and Masouda slept."
</p><p>"I am glad to hear it," answered Wulf, "for certainly their rest
was earned. By St. Chad! what a woman is this Masouda! A heart of
fire and nerves of steel! Beautiful, too--most beautiful; and the
best horsewoman that ever sat a steed. Had it not been for
her--By Heaven! when I think of it I feel as though I loved
her--don't you?"
</p><p>"No," said Godwin, still more shortly.
</p><p>"Ah, well, I daresay she can love enough for two who does nothing
by halves, and, all things considered," he added, with one of his
great laughs, "I am glad it is I of whom she thinks so
little--yes, I who adore her as though she were my patron saint.
Hark! the guards challenge," and, forgetting where he was, he
snatched at his sword.
</p><p>Then the door opened, and through it appeared the emir Hassan,
who saluted them in the name of Allah, searching them with his
quiet eyes.
</p><p>"Few would judge, to look at you, Sir Knights," he said with a
smile, "that you have been the guests of the Old Man of the
Mountain, and left his house so hastily by the back door. Three
days more and you will be as lusty as when we met beyond the seas
upon the wharf by a certain creek. Oh, you are brave men, both of
you, though you be infidels, from which error may the Prophet
guide you; brave men, the flower of knighthood. Ay, I, Hassan,
who have known many Frankish knights, say it from my heart," and,
placing his hand to his turban, he bowed before them in
admiration that was not feigned.
</p><p>"We thank you, Prince, for your praise," said Godwin gravely, but
Wulf stepped forward, took his hand, and shook it.
</p><p>"That was an ill trick, Prince, which you played us yonder in
England," he said, "and one that brought as good a warrior as
ever drew a sword--our uncle Sir Andrew D'Arcy--to an end sad as
it was glorious. Still, you obeyed your master, and because of
all that has happened since, I forgive you, and call you friend,
although should we ever meet in battle I still hope to pay you
for that drugged wine."
</p><p>Here Hassan bowed, and said softly:
</p><p>"I admit that the debt is owing; also that none sorrow more for
the death of the noble lord D'Arcy than I, your servant, who, by
the will of God, brought it upon him. When we meet, Sir Wulf, in
war--and that, I think, will be an ill hour for me--strike, and
strike home; I shall not complain. Meanwhile, we are friends, and
in very truth all that I have is yours. But now I come to tell
you that the princess Rose of the World--Allah bless her
footsteps!--is recovered from her fatigues, and desires that you
should breakfast with her in an hour's time. Also the doctor
waits to tend your bruises, and slaves to lead you to the bath
and clothe you. Nay, leave your hauberk; here the faith of
Salah-ed-din and of his servants is your best armour."
</p><p>"Still, I think that we will take them," said Godwin, "for faith
is a poor defence against the daggers of these Assassins, who
dwell not so far away."
</p><p>"True," answered Hassan; "I had forgotten." So thus they
departed.
</p><p>An hour later they were led to the hall, where presently came
Rosamund, and with her Masouda and Hassan.
</p><p>She was dressed in the rich robes of an Eastern lady, but the
gems with which she had been adorned as the bride elect of
Al-je-bal were gone; and when she lifted her veil the brethren
saw that though her face was still somewhat pallid, her strength
had come back to her, and the terror had left her eyes. She
greeted them with sweet and gentle words, thanking first Godwin
and then Wulf for all that they had done, and turning to Masouda,
who stood by, stately, and watchful, thanked her also. Then they
sat down, and ate with light hearts and a good appetite.
</p><p>Before their meal was finished, the guard at the door announced
that messengers had arrived from the Sultan. They entered,
grey-haired men clad in the robes of secretaries, whom Hassan
hastened to greet. When they were seated and had spoken with him
awhile, one of them drew forth a letter, which Hassan, touching
his forehead with it in token of respect, gave to Rosamund. She
broke its seal, and, seeing that it was in Arabic, handed it to
her cousin, saying:
</p><p>"Do you read it, Godwin, who are more learned than I."
</p><p>So he read aloud, translating the letter sentence by sentence.
This was its purport:
</p><p>"Salah-ed-din, Commander of the Faithful, the Strong-to-aid, to
his niece beloved, Rose of the World, princess of Baalbec:--
</p><p>"Our servant, the emir Hassan, has sent us tidings of your rescue
from the power of the accursed lord of the Mountain, Sinan, and
that you are now safe in our city of Emesa, guarded by many
thousands of our soldiers, and with you a woman named Masouda,
and your kinsmen, the two Frankish knights, by whose skill in
arms and courage you were saved. Now this is to command you to
come to our court at Damascus so soon as you may be fit to
travel, knowing that here you will be received with love and
honour. Also I invite your kinsmen to accompany you, since I knew
their father, and would welcome knights who have done such great
deeds, and the woman Masouda with them. Or, if they prefer it,
all three of them may return to their own lands and peoples.
</p><p>"Hasten, my niece, lady Rose of the World, hasten, for my spirit
seeks you, and my eyes desire to look upon you. In the name of
Allah, greeting."
</p><p>"You have heard," said Rosamund, as Godwin finished reading the
scroll. "Now, my cousins, what will you do?"
</p><p>"What else but go with you, whom we have come so far to seek?"
answered Wulf, and Godwin nodded his head in assent.
</p><p>"And you, Masouda?"
</p><p>"I, lady? Oh, I go also, since were I to return yonder," and she
nodded towards the mountains, "my greeting would be one that I do
not wish."
</p><p>"Do you note their words, prince Hassan?" asked Rosamund.
</p><p>"I expected no other," he answered with a bow. "Only, knights,
you must give me a promise, for even in the midst of my army such
is needful from men who can fly like birds out of the fortress of
Masyaf and from the knives of the Assassins--who are mounted,
moreover, on the swiftest horses in Syria that have been trained
to carry a double burden," and he looked at them meaningly. "It
is that upon this journey you will not attempt to escape with the
princess, whom you have followed from over-sea to rescue her out
of the hand of Salah-ed-din."
</p><p>Godwin drew from his tunic the cross which Rosamund had left him
in the hall at Steeple, and saying: "I swear upon this holy
symbol that during our journey to Damascus I will attempt no
escape with or without my cousin Rosamund," he kissed it.
</p><p>"And I swear the same upon my sword," added Wulf, laying his hand
upon the silver hilt of the great blade which had been his
forefather's.
</p><p>"A security that I like better," said Hassan with a smile, "but
in truth, knights, your word is enough for me." Then he looked at
Masouda and went on, still smiling: "Nay it is useless; for women
who have dwelt yonder oaths have no meaning. Lady, we must be
content to watch you, since my lord has bidden you to his city,
which, fair and brave as you are, to be plain, I would not have
done."
</p><p>Then he turned to speak to the secretaries, and Godwin, who was
noting all, saw Masouda's dark eyes follow him and in them a very
strange light.
</p><p>"Good," they seemed to say; "as you have written, so shall you
read."
</p><p>That same afternoon they started for Damascus, a great army of
horsemen. In its midst, guarded by a thousand spears, Rosamund
was borne in a litter. In front of her rode Hassan, with his
yellow-robed bodyguard; at her side, Masouda; and behind--for,
notwithstanding his hurts, Wulf would not be carried--the
brethren, mounted upon ambling palfreys. After them, led by
slaves, came the chargers, Flame and Smoke, recovered now, but
still walking somewhat stiffly, and then rank upon rank of
turbaned Saracens. Through the open curtains of her litter
Rosamund beckoned to the brethren, who pushed alongside of her.
</p><p>"Look," she said, pointing with her hand.
</p><p>They looked, and there, bathed in the glory of the sinking sun,
saw the mountains crowned far, far away with the impregnable city
and fortress of Masyaf, and below it the slopes down which they
had ridden for their lives. Nearer to them flashed the river
bordered by the town of Emesa. Set at intervals along its walls
were spears, looking like filaments against the flaming, sunset
sky, and on each of them a black dot, which was the head of an
Assassin, while from the turrets above, the golden banner of
Saladin fluttered in the evening wind. Remembering all that she
had undergone in that fearful home of devil-worshippers, and the
fate from which she had been snatched, Rosamund shuddered.
</p><p>"It burns like a city in hell," she said, staring at Masyaf,
environed by that lurid evening light and canopied with black,
smoke-like clouds. "Oh! such I think will be its doom."
</p><p>"I trust so," answered Wulf fervently. "At least, in this world
and the next we have done with it."
</p><p>"Yes," added Godwin in his thoughtful voice; "still, out of that
evil place we won good, for there we found Rosamund, and there,
my brother, you conquered in such a fray as you can never hope to
fight again, gaining great glory, and perhaps much more."
</p><p>Then reining in his horse, Godwin fell back behind the litter,
while Wulf wondered, and Rosamund watched him with dreaming eyes.
</p><p>That evening they camped in the desert, and next morning,
surrounded by wandering tribes of Bedouins mounted on their
camels, marched on again, sleeping that night in the ancient
fortress of Baalbec, whereof the garrison and people, having been
warned by runners of the rank and titles of Rosamund came out to
do her homage as their lady.
</p><p>Hearing of it, she left her litter, and mounting a splendid horse
which they had sent her as a present, rode to meet them, the
brethren, in full armour and once more bestriding Flame and
Smoke, beside her, and a guard of Saladin's own Mameluks behind.
Solemn, turbaned men, who had been commanded so to do by
messengers from the Sultan, brought her the keys of the gates on
a cushion, minstrels and soldiers marched before her, whilst
crowding the walls and running alongside came the citizens in
their thousands. Thus she went on, through the open gates, past
the towering columns of ruined temples once a home of the worship
of heathen gods, through courts and vaults to the citadel
surrounded by its gardens that in dead ages had been the
Acropolis of forgotten Roman emperors.
</p><p>Here in the portico Rosamund turned her horse, and received the
salutations of the multitude as though she also were one of the
world's rulers. Indeed, it seemed to the brethren watching her as
she sat upon the great white horse and surveyed the shouting,
bending crowd with flashing eyes, splendid in her bearing and
beautiful to see, a prince at her stirrup and an army at her
back, that none of those who had trod that path before her could
have seemed greater or more glorious in the hour of their pride
than did this English girl, who by the whim of Fate had suddenly
been set so high. Truly by blood and nature she was fitted to be
a queen. Yet as Rosamund sat thus the pride passed from her face,
and her eyes fell.
</p><p>"Of what are you thinking?" asked Godwin at her side.
</p><p>"That I would we were back among the summer fields at Steeple,"
she answered, "for those who are lifted high fall low. Prince
Hassan, give the captains and people my thanks and bid them be
gone. I would rest."
</p><p>Thus for the first and last time did Rosamund behold her ancient
fief of Baalbec, which her grandsire, the great Ayoub, had ruled
before her.
</p><p>That night there was feasting in the mighty, immemorial halls,
and singing and minstrelsy and the dancing of fair women and the
giving of gifts. For Baalbec, where birth and beauty were ever
welcome, did honour to its lady, the favoured niece of the mighty
Salah-ed-din. Yet there were some who murmured that she would
bring no good fortune to the Sultan or this his city, who was not
all of the blood of Ayoub, but half a Frank, and a Cross
worshipper, though even these praised her beauty and her royal
bearing. The brethren they praised also, although these were
unbelievers, and the tale of how Wulf had fought the traitor
knight upon the Narrow Way, and of how they had led their
kinswoman from the haunted fortress of Masyaf, was passed from
mouth to mouth. At dawn the next day, on orders received from
the Sultan, they left Baalbec, escorted by the army and many of
the notables of the town. That afternoon they drew rein upon the
heights which overlook the city of Damascus, Bride of the Earth,
set amidst its seven streams and ringed about with gardens, one
of the most beautiful and perhaps the most ancient city in the
world. Then they rode down to the bounteous plain, and as night
fell, having passed the encircling gardens, were escorted through
the gates of Damascus, outside of which most of the army halted
and encamped.
</p><p>Along the narrow streets, bordered by yellow, flat-roofed houses,
they rode slowly, looking now at the motley, many-coloured
crowds, who watched them with grave interest, and now at the
stately buildings, domed mosques and towering minarets, which
everywhere stood out against the deep blue of the evening sky.
Thus at length they came to an open space planted like a garden,
beyond which was seen a huge and fantastic castle that Hassan
told them was the palace of Salah-ed-din. In its courtyard they
were parted, Rosamund being led away by officers of state, whilst
the brethren were taken to chambers that had been prepared,
where, after they had bathed, they were served with food.
Scarcely had they eaten it when Hassan appeared, and bade them
follow him. Passing down various passages and across a court they
came to some guarded doors, where the soldiers demanded that they
should give up their swords and daggers.
</p><p>"It is not needful," said Hassan, and they let them go by. Next
came more passages and a curtain, beyond which they found
themselves in a small, domed room, lit by hanging silver lamps
and paved in tesselated marbles, strewn with rich rugs and
furnished with cushioned couches.
</p><p>At a sign from Hassan the brethren stood still in the centre of
this room, and looked about them wondering. The place was empty
and very silent; they felt afraid--of what they knew not.
Presently curtains upon its further side opened and through them
came a man turbaned and wrapped in a dark robe, who stood awhile
in the shadow, gazing at them beneath the lamps.
</p><p>The man was not very tall, and slight in build, yet about him was
much majesty, although his garb was such as the humblest might
have worn. He came forward, lifting his head, and they saw that
his features were small and finely cut; that he was bearded, and
beneath his broad brow shone thoughtful yet at times piercing
eyes which were brown in hue. Now the prince Hassan sank to his
knees and touched the marble with his forehead, and, guessing
that they were in the presence of the mighty monarch Saladin, the
brethren saluted in their western fashion. Presently the Sultan
spoke in a low, even voice to Hassan, to whom he motioned that he
should rise, saying:
</p><p>"I can see that you trust these knights, Emir," and he pointed to
their great swords.
</p><p>"Sire," was the answer, "I trust them as I trust myself. They are
brave and honourable men, although they be infidels."
</p><p>The Sultan stroked his beard.
</p><p>"Ay," he said, "infidels. It is a pity, yet doubtless they
worship God after their own fashion. Noble to look on also, like
their father, whom I remember well, and, if all I hear is true,
brave indeed. Sir Knights, do you understand my language?"
</p><p>"Sufficiently to speak it, lord," answered Godwin, "who have
learned it since childhood, yet ill enough."
</p><p>"Good. Then tell me, as soldiers to a soldier, what do you seek
from Salah-ed-din?"
</p><p>"Our cousin, the lady Rosamund, who, by your command, lord, was
stolen from our home in England."
</p><p>"Knights, she is your cousin, that I know, as surely as I know
that she is my niece. Tell me now, is she aught more to you?" and
he searched them with those piercing eyes.
</p><p>Godwin looked at Wulf, who said in English:
</p><p>"Speak the whole truth, brother. From that man nothing can be
hid."
</p><p>Then Godwin answered:
</p><p>"Sire, we love her, and are affianced to her."
</p><p>The Sultan stared at them in surprise.
</p><p>"What! Both of you?" he asked.
</p><p>"Yes, both."
</p><p>"And does she love you both?"
</p><p>"Yes," replied Godwin, "both, or so she says."
</p><p>Saladin stroked his beard and considered them, while Hassan
smiled a little.
</p><p>"Then, knights," he said presently, "tell me, which of you does
she love best?"
</p><p>"That, sire, is known to her alone. When the time comes, she will
say, and not before."
</p><p>"I perceive," said Saladin, "that behind this riddle hides a
story. If it is your good pleasure, be seated, and set it out to
me."
</p><p>So they sat down on the divan and obeyed, keeping nothing back
from the beginning to the end, nor, although the tale was long,
did the Sultan weary of listening.
</p><p>"A great story, truly," he said, when at length they had
finished, "and one in which I seem to see the hand of Allah. Sir
Knights, you will think that I have wronged you--ay, and your
uncle, Sir Andrew, who was once my friend, although an older man
than I, and who, by stealing away my sister, laid the foundations
of this house of love and war and woe, and perchance of happiness
unforeseen.
</p><p>"Now listen. The tale that those two Frankish knaves, the priest
and the false knight Lozelle, told to you was true. As I wrote to
your uncle in my letter, I dreamed a dream. Thrice I dreamed it;
that this niece of mine lived, and that if I could bring her here
to dwell at my side she should save the shedding of much blood by
some noble deed of hers--ay, of the blood of tens of thousands;
and in that dream I saw her face. Therefore I stretched out my
arm and took her from far away. And now, through you--yes,
through you--she has been snatched from the power of the great
Assassin, and is safe in my court, and therefore henceforth I am
your friend."
</p><p>"Sire, have you seen her?" asked Godwin.
</p><p>"Knights, I have seen her, and the face is the face of my dreams,
and therefore I know full surely that in those dreams God spoke.
Listen, Sir Godwin and Sir Wulf," Saladin went on in a changed
voice, a stern, commanding voice. "Ask of me what you will, and,
Franks though you are, it shall be given you for your service's
sake--wealth, lands, titles, all that men desire and I can
grant--but ask not of me my niece, Rose of the World, princess of
Baalbec, whom Allah has brought to me for His own purposes. Know,
moreover, that if you strive to steal her away you shall
certainly die; and that if she escapes from me and I recapture
her, then she shall die. These things I have told her already,
and I swear them in the name of Allah. Here she is, and in my
house she must abide until the vision be fulfilled."
</p><p>Now in their dismay the brethren looked at each other, for they
seemed further from their desire than they had been even in the
castle of Sinan. Then a light broke upon the face of Godwin, and
he stood up and answered:
</p><p>"Dread lord of all the East, we hear you and we know our risk.
You have given us your friendship; we accept it, and are
thankful, and seek no more. God, you say, has brought our lady
Rosamund to you for His own purposes, of which you have no doubt
since her face is the very face of your dreams. Then let His
purposes be accomplished according to His will, which may be in
some way that we little guess. We abide His judgment Who has
guided us in the past, and will guide us in the future."
</p><p>"Well spoken," replied Saladin. "I have warned you, my guests,
therefore blame me not if I keep my word; but I ask no promise
from you who would not tempt noble knights to lie. Yes, Allah has
set this strange riddle; by Allah let it be answered in His
season."
</p><p>Then he waved his hand to show that the audience was ended.
