<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>When Fred Sheldon turned on his heel and saw the outlines of
the tramp in the room behind him he gave a start and exclamation
of fear, as the bravest man might have done under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The intruder chuckled and said in his rasping, creaking voice:</p>

<p>"Don't be skeert, young man; if you keep quiet you won't get
hurt, but if you go to yelping or making any sort of noise I'll
wring your head as if you was a chicken I wanted for dinner."</p>

<p>Fred made no answer to this, when the tramp added, in the same
husky undertone, as he stepped forward in a threatening way:</p>

<p>"Do you hear what I said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I hear you."</p>

<p>"Well, just step back through that door in t'other room and watch
me while I look through this chest for a gold ring I lost last
week."</p>

<p>Poor Fred was in a terrible state of mind, and, passing softly
through the door opening into his bed-room, he paused by the chair
where he had sat so long, and then faced toward the tramp, who
said, by way of amendment:</p>

<p>"I forgot to say that if you try to climb out of the winder onto
the porto rico or to sneak out any way I'll give you a touch of
that."</p>

<p>As he spoke he suddenly held up a bull's-eye lantern, which poured
a strong stream of light toward the boy. It looked as if he must
have lighted it inside the house, and had come into the room with
it under his coat.</p>

<p>While he carried this lantern in one hand he held a pistol, shining
with polished silver, in the other, and behind the two objects
the bearded face loomed up like that of some ogre of darkness.</p>

<p>The scamp did not seem to think this remark required anything
in the way of response, and, kneeling before the huge oaken chest,
he began his evil work.</p>

<p>For a few moments Fred was so interested that he ceased to reproach
himself for having failed to do his duty.</p>

<p>The tramp set the lantern on the floor beside him, so that it
threw its beams directly into the room where the boy stood.</p>

<p>The marauder, it must be said, did not act like a professional.
One of the burglars who infest society to-day would have made
short work with the lock, though it was of the massive and powerful
kind, in use many years ago; but this person fumbled and worked
a good while without getting it open.</p>

<p>He muttered impatiently to himself several times, and then caught
up the bull's-eye, and, bending his head over, carefully examined
it, to learn why it resisted his vigorous efforts.</p>

<p>The action of the man seemed to rouse Fred, who, without a moment's
thought, stepped backward toward the open window at the rear,
the one which had been raised all the time to afford ventilation.</p>

<p>He thought if the dreadful man should object, he could make excuse
on account of the warmth of the night.</p>

<p>But the lad moved so softly, or the wicked fellow was so interested
in his own work that he did not notice him, for he said nothing,
and though Fred could see him no longer he could hear him toiling,
with occasional mutterings of anger at his failure to open the
chest, which was believed to contain so much valuable silverware
and money.</p>

<p>The diverging rays from the dark-lantern still shot through the
open door into the bed-room. They made a well-defined path along
the floor, quite narrow and not very high, and which, striking
the white wall at the opposite side, terminated in one splash
of yellow, in which the specks of the whitewash could be plainly
seen.</p>

<p>It was as if a great wedge of golden light lay on the floor,
with the head against the wall and the tapering point passing
through the door and ending at the chest in the other room.</p>

<p>While Fred Sheldon was looking at the curious sight he noticed
something in the illuminated path. It would be thought that, in
the natural fear of a boy in his situation, he would have felt
no interest in it, but, led on by a curiosity which none but a
lad feels, he stepped softly forward on tip-toe.</p>

<p>Before he stooped over to pick it up he saw that it was a handsome
pocket-knife.</p>

<p>"He has dropped it," was the thought of Fred, who wondered how
he came to do it; "anyway I'll hold on to it for awhile."</p>

<p>He quietly shoved it down into his pocket, where his old Barlow
knife, his jewsharp, eleven marbles, two slate pencils, a couple
of large coppers, some cake crumbs and other trifles nestled,
and then, having succeeded so well, he again went softly to the
open window at the rear.</p>

<p>Just as he reached it he heard an unusual noise in the smaller
apartment where the man was at work, and he was sure the burglar
had discovered what he was doing, and was about to punish him.</p>

<p>But the sound was not repeated, and the boy believed the tramp
had got the chest open. If such were the fact, he was not likely
to think of the youngster in the next room for several minutes
more.</p>

<p>Fred was plucky, and the thought instantly came to him that he
had a chance to leave the room and give an alarm; but to go to
the front and climb out on the roof of the porch would bring him
so close to the tramp that discovery would be certain.</p>

<p>At the rear there was nothing by which he could descend to the
ground. It was a straight wall, invisible in the darkness and
too high for any one to leap. He might hang down from the sill
by his hands and then let go, but he was too unfamiliar with the
surroundings to make such an attempt.</p>

<p>"Maybe there's a tub of water down there," he said to himself,
trying to peer into the gloom; "and I might turn over and strike
on my head into it, or it might be the swill barrel, and I wouldn't
want to get my head and shoulders wedged into that&#11834;"</p>

<p>At that instant something as soft as a feather touched his cheek.
The gentle night wind had moved the rustling limbs, so that one
of them in swaying only a few inches had reached out, as it were,
and kissed the chubby face of the brave little boy.</p>

<p>"Why didn't I think of that?" he asked himself, as he caught
hold of the friendly limb. "I can hold on and swing to the ground."</p>

<p>It looked, indeed, as if such a movement was easy. By reaching
his hand forward he could follow the limb until it was fully an
inch in diameter. That was plenty strong enough to hold his weight.</p>

<p>Glancing around, he saw the same wedge of golden light streaming
into the room, and the sounds were such that he was sure the burglar
had opened the chest and was helping himself to the riches within.</p>

<p>The next minute Fred bent forward, and, griping the limb with
both hands, swung out of the window. All was darkness, and he
shut his eyes and held his breath with that peculiar dizzy feeling
which comes over one when he cowers before an expected blow on
the head.</p>

<p>The sensation was that of rushing into the leaves and undergrowth,
and then, feeling himself stopping rather suddenly, he let go.</p>

<p>He alighted upon his feet, the distance being so short that he
was scarcely jarred, and he drew a sigh of relief when he realized
that his venture had ended so well.</p>

<p>"There," he said to himself, as he adjusted his clothing, "I
ain't afraid of him now, I can outrun him if I only have a fair
chance, and there's plenty of places where a fellow can hide."</p>

<p>Looking up to the house it was all dark; not a ray from the lantern
could be seen, and the sisters were no doubt sleeping as sweetly
as they had slept nearly every night for the past three-score
years and more.</p>

<p>But Fred understood the value of time too well to stay in the
vicinity while the tramp was engaged with his nefarious work above.
If the law-breaker was to be caught, it must be done speedily.</p>

<p>But there were no houses near at hand, and it would take fully
an hour to bring Archie Jackson, the constable, to the spot.</p>

<p>"The nearest house is Mike Heyland's, the hired man, and I'll
go for him."</p>

<p>Filled with this thought, Fred moved softly around to the front,
passed through the gate, entered the short lane, and began walking
between the rows of trees in the direction of the highway.</p>

<p>An active boy of his age finds his most natural gait to be a
trot, and Fred took up that pace.</p>

<p>"It's so dark here under these trees that if there's anything
in the road I'll tumble over it, for I never miss&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Halloo there, you boy!"</p>

<p>As these startling words fell upon young Sheldon's ear, the figure
of a man suddenly stepped out from the denser shadows and halted
in front of the affrighted boy, who stopped short, wondering what
it meant.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the voice and manner of the stranger, however,
which gave confidence to Fred, who quickly rallied, and stepping
closer, caught his hand with the confiding faith of childhood.</p>

<p>"O, I'm so glad to see you! I was afraid I'd have to run clear
to Tottenville to find somebody."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, my little man?"</p>

<p>"Why, there's a robber in the house back there; he's stealing
all the silver and money that belongs to the Misses Perkinpine,
and they're sound asleep&mdash;just think of it&mdash;and he's got a lantern
up there and is at work at the chest now, and said he would shoot
me if I made any noise or tried to get away, but I catched hold
of a limb and swung out the window, and here I am!" exclaimed
Fred, stopping short and panting.</p>

<p>"Well now, that's lucky, for I happen to have a good, loaded
pistol with me. I'm visiting Mr. Spriggins in Tottenville, and
went out fishing this afternoon, but stayed longer than I intended,
and was going home across lots when I struck the lane here without
knowing exactly where I was; but I'm glad I met you."</p>

<p>"So'm I," exclaimed the gratified Fred; "will you help me catch
that tramp?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I will; come on, my little man."</p>

<p>The stranger stepped off briskly, Fred close behind him, and
passed through the gate at the front of the old brick house, which
looked as dark and still as though no living person had been in
it for years.</p>

<p>"Don't make any noise," whispered the elder, turning part way
round and raising his finger.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid of my doing so," replied the boy, who
was sure the caution was unnecessary.</p>

<p>Fred did not notice the fact at the time that the man who had
come along so opportunely seemed to be quite familiar with the
place, but he walked straight to a rear window, which, despite
the care with which it had been fastened down, was found to be
raised.</p>

<p>"There's where he went in," whispered Fred's friend, "and there's
where we're going after him."</p>

<p>"All right," said Fred, who did not hesitate, although he could
not see much prospect of his doing anything. "I'll follow."</p>

<p>The man reached up and catching hold of the sash placed his feet
on the sill and stepped softly into the room. Then turning so
his figure could be seen plainly in the moonlight, he said in
the same guarded voice:</p>

<p>"He may hear me coming, do you, therefore, go round to the front
and if he tries to climb down by way of the porch, run round here
and let me know. We'll make it hot for him."</p>

<p>This seemed a prudent arrangement, for it may be said, it guarded
all points. The man who had just entered would, prevent the thieving
tramp from retreating by the path he used in entering, while the
sharp eyes of the boy would be quick to discover him the moment
he sought to use the front window.</p>

<p>"I guess we've got him," thought Fred, as he took his station
by the front porch and looked steadily upward, like one who is
studying the appearance of a new comet or some constellation in
the heavens; "that man going after him ain't afraid of anything,
and he looks strong and big enough to take him by the collar and
shake him, just as Mr. McCurtis shakes us boys when he wants to
exercise himself."</p>

<p>For several minutes the vigilant Fred was in a flutter of excitement,
expecting to hear the report of firearms and the sound of struggling
on the floor above.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Miss Annie and Lizzie will wake up when the shooting
begins," thought Fred; "I don't suppose they will, for they are
so used to sleeping all night that nothing less than a big thunder-storm
will start them&mdash;but it seems to me it's time that something took
place."</p>

<p>Young Sheldon had the natural impatience of youth, and when ten
minutes passed without stirring up matters, he thought his friend
was too slow in his movements.</p>

<p>Besides, his neck began to ache from looking so steadily upward,
so he walked back in the yard some distance, and leaning against
a tree, shoved his hands down in his pockets and continued the
scrutiny.</p>

<p>This made it more pleasant for a short time only, when he finally
struck the happy expedient of lying down on his side and then
placing his head upon his hand in such an easy position that the
ache vanished at once.</p>

<p>Fifteen more minutes went by, and Fred began to wonder what it
all meant. It seemed to him that fully an hour had gone since
stationing himself as a watcher, and not the slightest sound had
come back to tell him that any living person was in the house.</p>

<p>"There's something wrong about this," he finally exclaimed, springing
to his feet; "maybe the tramp got away before I came back; but
then, if that's so, why didn't the other fellow find it out long
ago?"</p>

<p>Loth to leave his post, Fred moved cautiously among the trees
a while longer, and still failing to detect anything that would
throw light on the mystery, he suddenly formed a determination,
which was a rare one, indeed, for a lad of his years.</p>

<p>"I'll go in and find out for myself!"</p>

<p>Boy-like, having made the resolve, he acted upon it without stopping
to think what the cost might be. He was in his bare feet, and
it was an easy matter for a little fellow like him to climb through
an open window on the first floor without making a noise.</p>

<p>When he got into the room, however, where it was as dark as the
darkest midnight he ever saw, things began to appear different,
that is so far as anything can be said to appear where it is invisible.</p>

<p>He could see nothing at all, and reaching out his hands, he began
shuffling along in that doubting manner which we all use under
such circumstances.</p>

<p>He knew that he was in the dining-room, from which it was necessary
to pass through a door into the broad hall, and up the stairs
to the spare room, where it was expected he would sleep whenever
he favored the twin maiden sisters with a visit.</p>

<p>He could find his way there in the dark, but he was afraid of
the obstructions in his path.</p>

<p>"I 'spose all the chairs have been set out of the way, 'cause
Miss Annie and Lizzie are very particular, and they wouldn't&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then Fred's knee came against a chair, and before he could
stop himself, he fell over it with a racket which he was sure
would awaken the ladies themselves.</p>

<p>"That must have jarred every window in the house," he gasped,
rubbing his knees.</p>

<p>He listened for a minute or two before starting on again, but
the same profound stillness reigned. It followed, as a matter
of course, that the men up-stairs had heard the tumult, but Fred
consoled himself with the belief that it was such a tremendous
noise that they would mistake its meaning altogether.</p>

<p>"Any way, I don't mean to fall over any more chairs," muttered
the lad, shuffling along with more care, and holding his hands
down, so as to detect such an obstruction.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to tell what followed. Let any one undertake
to make his way across a dark room, without crossing his hands
in front and the edge of a door is sure to get between them.</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon received a bump which made him see stars, but after
rubbing his forehead for a moment he moved out into the broad
hall, where there was no more danger of anything of the kind.</p>

<p>The heavy oaken stairs were of such solid structure that when
he placed his foot on the steps they gave back no sound, and he
stepped quite briskly to the top without making any noise that
could betray his approach.</p>

<p>"I wonder what they thought when I tumbled over the chair," pondered
Fred, who began to feel more certain than before that something
was amiss.</p>

<p>Reaching out his hands in the dark he found that the door of
his own room was wide open, and he walked in without trouble.</p>

<p>As he did so a faint light which entered by the rear window gave
him a clear idea of the interior.</p>

<p>With his heart beating very fast Fred tip-toed toward the front
until he could look through the open door into the small room
where the large oaken chest stood.</p>

<p>By this time the moon was so high that he could see the interior
with more distinctness than before.</p>

<p>All was still and deserted; both the men were gone.</p>

<p>"That's queer," muttered the puzzled lad; "if the tramp slipped
away, the other man that I met on the road ought to have found
it out; but what's become of him?"</p>

<p>Running his hand deep down among the treasures in his trousers
pocket, Fred fished out a lucifer match, which he drew on the
wall, and, as the tiny twist of flame expanded, he touched it
to the wick of the candle that he held above his head.</p>

<p>The sight which met his gaze was a curious one indeed, and held
him almost breathless for the time.</p>

<p>The lid of the huge chest was thrown back against the wall, and
all that was within it were rumpled sheets of old brown paper,
which had no doubt been used as wrappings for the pieces of the
silver tea-service.</p>

<p>On the floor beside the chest was a large pocket-book, wrong
side out. This, doubtless, had once held the money belonging to
the old ladies, but it held it no longer.</p>

<p>Money and silverware were gone!</p>

<p>"The tramp got away while we were down the lane," said Fred,
as he stood looking at the signs of ruin about him; "but why didn't
my friend let me know about it, and where is he?"</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon stopped in dismay, for just then the whole truth
came upon him like a flash.</p>

<p>These two men were partners, and the man in the lane was on the
watch to see that no strangers approached without the alarm being
given to the one inside the house.</p>

<p>"Why didn't I think of that?" mentally exclaimed the boy, so
overcome that he dropped into a chair, helpless and weak, holding
the candle in hand.</p>

<p>It is easy to see how natural it was for a lad of his age to
be deceived as was Fred Sheldon, who never in all his life had
been placed in such a trying position.</p>

<p>He sat for several minutes looking at the open chest, which seemed
to speak so eloquently of the wrong it had suffered, and then
he reproached himself for having failed so completely in doing
his duty.</p>

<p>"I can't see anything I've done," he thought, "which could have
been of any good, while there was plenty of chances to make some
use of myself if I had any sense about me."</p>

<p>Indeed there did appear to be some justice in the self-reproach
of the lad, who added in the same vein:</p>

<p>"I knew, the minute he stopped to ask questions at our front
gate, that he meant to come here and rob the house, and I ought
to have started right off for Constable Jackson, without running
to tell the folks. Then they laughed at me and I thought I was
mistaken, even after I had seen him peeping through the window.
When he was eating his supper I was sure of it, and then I should
have slipped away and got somebody else here to help watch, but
we didn't have anything to shoot with, and when I tried to keep
guard I fell asleep, and when I woke up I was simple enough to
think there was only one way of his coming into the house, and,
while I had my eye on that, he walked right in behind me."</p>

<p>Then, as Fred recalled his meeting with the second party in the
lane, he heaved a great sigh.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm the biggest blockhead in the country&mdash;that's all&mdash;and
I hope I won't have to tell anybody the whole story. Halloo!"</p>

<p>Just then he happened to think of the pocket-knife he had picked
up on the floor, and he drew it out of his pocket. Boy-like, his
eyes sparkled with pleasure when they rested on the implement
so indispensable to every youngster, and which was much the finest
one he had ever had in his hand.</p>

<p>The handle was pearl and the two blades were of the finest steel
and almost as keen as a razor.</p>

<p>Fred set the candle on a chair, and leaning over, carefully examined
the knife, which seemed to grow in beauty the more he handled
it.</p>

<p>"The man that dropped that is the one who stole all the silverware
and money, and there's the letters of his name," added the boy.</p>

<p>True enough. On the little piece of brass on the side of the
handle were roughly cut the letters, "N. H. H."</p>
