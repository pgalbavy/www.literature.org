<p>All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men
have been and are either republics or principalities.</p>

<p>Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has
been long established; or they are new.</p>

<p>The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza,
or they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state
of the prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples
to that of the King of Spain.</p>

<p>Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under
a prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the
arms of the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or
by ability.</p>
