<p>Warren Starr was impatient with himself that he had not thought
of the stranger being a white man until it was too late to make
use of the important fact. The sounds of firing ahead ought to
have raised the suspicion in his mind, and the act of his pony
should have confirmed it, for he never would have betrayed himself
to one of his own species had he not known that he belonged to
a friend.</p>

<p>But it was a waste of time to bewail what could not be helped,
and nothing was to be gained by staying where he was. There was
no longer any call to push onward toward the ranch, for that was
not his destination. He was seeking his folks.</p>

<p>Once more the nose of Jack was turned about, and this time he
was headed toward the northwest, his course being such that it
would take him considerably to the west of the second rocky ridge
to which allusion has been made. In short, Warren had now set
out to do that which he would not have attempted but for the receipt
of the message from his father. He was about to flank both elevations
by swerving far from the direct course to his home.</p>

<p>The small tributary of the Big Cheyenne, which it was necessary
to ford in order to reach the ranch, made a sweeping curve southward,
so that the marked change in the course he was following would
take him to it, though at a point far removed from the regular
ford.</p>

<p>The youth was not riding blindly forward. It has been stated
that he was familiar with the country for many miles around his
home, and he was making for a definite point. It was on the bank
of the small stream, and was not only deeply wooded, but abounded
with rocks, bowlders, depressions, ravines, and wild, dangerous
places, where it was certain death for a person to try to make
his way in the darkness, unless he knew every foot of the locality.</p>

<p>This was the locality for which young Starr was aiming. Here
he was confident of finding security against the Sioux, though
they might be near at hand. He knew just where to go, for he had
hunted through it many times with his friend Tim Brophy, for whose
company he longed more than ever before.</p>

<p>Jack wanted food, but it could not be had. He did not need it,
however, to the extent of suffering. At the noon halt, when his
master sat on the ground by a spring of cold water to eat his
lunch, the pony had cropped the succulent grass that grew around,
and he could stand it quite well until the morrow. The animal
needed rest and shelter more than anything else, and it was that
which his young master meant he should have.</p>

<p>As if he understood it all, the horse of his own accord struck
into a brisk gallop, which rendered unnecessary any other protection
from the cold. The snow was still falling, but the temperature
was not low, and there was not enough on the ground to interfere
with the travelling of the animal, who maintained his pace until
the abrupt appearance of the rocky section, with its trees and
bowlders, compelled him to drop to a slow walk, with his nose
thrust forward, as if to scent every step of the way, like an
elephant crossing a doubtful bridge.</p>

<p>"Here we are, my boy!" called out Warren, "and you couldn't have
come more truly if the sun had been shining."</p>

<p>It certainly was a marvellous piece of woodcraft, if such it
may be called, on the part of the pony, that he should have struck
the spot so accurately, and yet it is scarcely less marvellous
that, had he needed direction, his master was competent to give
it, despite the darkness and the snow.</p>

<p>Warren left the saddle for the last time. With no stars or moon
in the sky, and with the snow falling faster than ever, it would
seem that one's eyes were of little use, but they served their
purpose well in the present instance. Paying no heed to the animal,
he bent over, groping his way among the rocks, which began abruptly
on the edge of the prairie, and had not spent five minutes thus
when he came upon that for which he was looking&mdash;an opening between
a mass of bowlders, along which a person or animal could make
his way with little difficulty.</p>

<p>"Here we are, Jack, my boy! Come on; we'll soon reach our house."</p>

<p>With more thrusting forward of the head, and sniffing of the
air, the pony obeyed, though it is hardly to be supposed that
he understood all that was said to him.</p>

<p>On the previous winter, when Warren Starr and Tim Brophy were
hunting in this section, they found game so abundant that they
decided to spend two or three days in the neighborhood. Accordingly
they put up a shelter which afforded good protection at night,
and would do the same against any storm not too violent. A rock
a dozen feet in length formed a half-circle, the upper edge projecting
over to the extent of a yard or more. All that was required was
to lean a number of branches against this, the upper parts supported
by the ledge, while the lower rested on the ground, some eight
or ten feet away from the base.</p>

<p>These branches being numerous and thickly placed, constituted
what might be considered a tepee, with only the broad opening
in front.</p>

<p>It was in this rude shelter that Warren Starr and Tim Brophy
had spent a couple of nights in comparative comfort. The second
one was bitterly cold, and they kindled a fire near the entrance.
The smoke caused some trouble, but wrapped in their thick blankets,
and stretched out back to back, they slept as soundly as if in
their beds at home.</p>

<p>This was the structure which the youth had in mind when he turned
his back on the regular trail and made for the wild solitude through
which he now began threading his way, and it was a striking tribute
to his woodcraft and knowledge that within fifteen minutes he
reached the very spot, with his pony at his heels.</p>

<p>"This is the place," he remarked to his animal, "but there don't
seem to be any lamps lighted, and it's best to look around a little
before retiring for the night."</p>

<p>Drawing a rubber match-safe from his pocket, he ignited one of
the tiny bits of wood, shading the twist of flame from the snowflakes,
though there was no wind stirring.</p>

<p>It was months since he had visited the place, and the elements
were likely to have played havoc with the structure during that
period, for in that part of our Union the blizzard and tempest
raise the mischief at certain seasons.</p>

<p>He was gratified, however, to note the slight change effected.
One or two of the long branches had fallen to the ground and several
others were askew. He was obliged to fling aside the match while
he devoted some minutes to straightening them. This was effected
so well that when he stepped inside and struck another match he
saw not a flake of snow filtering through the crevices, though
there was likely to be considerable before morning.</p>

<p>"Come in!" was the astonishing command the youth gave to his
pony, who stood looking at him, as if wondering what the next
move was to be. The situation was amusing, and not without its
ludicrous side, with Warren holding a match in one hand, his rifle
in the other, and his heavy blanket wrapped about his shoulders,
beckoning and addressing the pony, which hesitated for a minute
at this unexpected invitation to share the couch of his master.</p>

<p>But he was an obedient animal, and with some more sniffing and
poking forward of his nose, he stepped slowly forward until he
was entirely within the rude structure.</p>

<p>"Now lie down," added Warren, lighting another match, and Jack
obeyed with more promptness than before. Then the youth flung
the broad, heavy blanket over the pony so as to envelop as much
of him as possible, lay down close to the front of his body, adjusting
the hoofs as best he could, drew the rest of the covering over
himself, and was excusable for chuckling:</p>

<p>"Now, Jack, old fellow, what's to prevent us from sleeping as
snug as a bug in a rug! Hey, my boy?"</p>

<p>Everything promised well, but before either could fall asleep,
they were startled beyond measure by hearing someone moving outside.
Whispering to the horse to keep still, Warren slipped out from
under the blanket and moved softly to the opening, revolver in
hand. As he did so, he ran squarely against another person who
was in the act of entering the place of shelter.</p>
