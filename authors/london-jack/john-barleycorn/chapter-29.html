After my long sickness my drinking continued to be convivial.  I
drank when others drank and I was with them.  But, imperceptibly,
my need for alcohol took form and began to grow.  It was not a
body need.  I boxed, swam, sailed, rode horses, lived in the open
an arrantly healthful life, and passed life insurance examinations
with flying colours.  In its inception, now that I look back upon
it, this need for alcohol was a mental need, a nerve need, a good-
spirits need.  How can I explain?
<P>
It was something like this.  Physiologically, from the standpoint
of palate and stomach, alcohol was, as it had always been,
repulsive.  It tasted no better than beer did when I was five,
than bitter claret did when I was seven.  When I was alone,
writing or studying, I had no need for it.  But--I was growing
old, or wise, or both, or senile as an alternative.  When I was in
company I was less pleased, less excited, with the things said and
done.  Erstwhile worth-while fun and stunts seemed no longer worth
while; and it was a torment to listen to the insipidities and
stupidities of women, to the pompous, arrogant sayings of the
little half-baked men.  It is the penalty one pays for reading the
books too much, or for being oneself a fool.  In my case it does
not matter which was my trouble.  The trouble itself was the fact. 
The condition of the fact was mine.  For me the life, and light,
and sparkle of human intercourse were dwindling.
<P>
I had climbed too high among the stars, or, maybe, I had slept too
hard.  Yet I was not hysterical nor in any way overwrought.  My
pulse was normal.  My heart was an amazement of excellence to the
insurance doctors.  My lungs threw the said doctors into
ecstasies.  I wrote a thousand words every day.  I was
punctiliously exact in dealing with all the affairs of life that
fell to my lot.  I exercised in joy and gladness.  I slept at
night like a babe.  But--
<P>
Well, as soon as I got out in the company of others I was driven
to melancholy and spiritual tears.  I could neither laugh with nor
at the solemn utterances of men I esteemed ponderous asses; nor
could I laugh, nor engage in my old-time lightsome persiflage,
with the silly superficial chatterings of women, who, underneath
all their silliness and softness, were as primitive, direct, and
deadly in their pursuit of biological destiny as the monkeys women
were before they shed their furry coats and replaced them with the
furs of other animals.
<P>
And I was not pessimistic.  I swear I was not pessimistic.  I was
merely bored.  I had seen the same show too often, listened too
often to the same songs and the same jokes.  I knew too much about
the box office receipts.  I knew the cogs of the machinery behind
the scenes so well that the posing on the stage, and the laughter
and the song, could not drown the creaking of the wheels behind.
<P>
It doesn't pay to go behind the scenes and see the angel-voiced
tenor beat his wife.  Well, I'd been behind, and I was paying for
it.  Or else I was a fool.  It is immaterial which was my
situation.  The situation is what counts, and the situation was
that social intercourse for me was getting painful and difficult. 
On the other hand, it must be stated that on rare occasions, on
very rare occasions, I did meet rare souls, or fools like me, with
whom I could spend magnificent hours among the stars, or in the
paradise of fools.  I was married to a rare soul, or a fool, who
never bored me and who was always a source of new and unending
surprise and delight.  But I could not spend all my hours solely
in her company.
<P>
Nor would it have been fair, nor wise, to compel her to spend all
her hours in my company.  Besides, I had written a string of
successful books, and society demands some portion of the
recreative hours of a fellow that writes books.  And any normal
man, of himself and his needs, demands some hours of his fellow
men.
<P>
And now we begin to come to it.  How to face the social
intercourse game with the glamour gone? John Barleycorn.  The ever
patient one had waited a quarter of a century and more for me to
reach my hand out in need of him.  His thousand tricks had failed,
thanks to my constitution and good luck, but he had more tricks in
his bag.  A cocktail or two, or several, I found, cheered me up
for the foolishness of foolish people.  A cocktail, or several,
before dinner, enabled me to laugh whole-heartedly at things which
had long since ceased being laughable.  The cocktail was a prod, a
spur, a kick, to my jaded mind and bored spirits.  It recrudesced
the laughter and the song, and put a lilt into my own imagination
so that I could laugh and sing and say foolish things with the
liveliest of them, or platitudes with verve and intensity to the
satisfaction of the pompous mediocre ones who knew no other way to
talk.
<P>
A poor companion without a cocktail, I became a very good
companion with one.  I achieved a false exhilaration, drugged
myself to merriment.  And the thing began so imperceptibly that I,
old intimate of John Barleycorn, never dreamed whither it was
leading me.  I was beginning to call for music and wine; soon I
should be calling for madder music and more wine.
<P>
It was at this time I became aware of waiting with expectancy for
the pre-dinner cocktail.  I WANTED it, and I was CONSCIOUS that I
wanted it.  I remember, while war-corresponding in the Far East,
of being irresistibly attracted to a certain home.  Besides
accepting all invitations to dinner, I made a point of dropping in
almost every afternoon.  Now, the hostess was a charming woman,
but it was not for her sake that I was under her roof so
frequently.  It happened that she made by far the finest cocktail
procurable in that large city where drink-mixing on the part of
the foreign population was indeed an art.  Up at the club, down at
the hotels, and in other private houses, no such cocktails were
created.  Her cocktails were subtle.  They were masterpieces. 
They were the least repulsive to the palate and carried the most
"kick." And yet, I desired her cocktails only for sociability's
sake, to key myself to sociable moods.  When I rode away from that
city, across hundreds of miles of rice-fields and mountains, and
through months of campaigning, and on with the victorious Japanese
into Manchuria, I did not drink.  Several bottles of whisky were
always to be found on the backs of my pack-horses.  Yet I never
broached a bottle for myself, never took a drink by myself, and
never knew a desire to take such a drink.  Oh, if a white man came
into my camp, I opened a bottle and we drank together according to
the way of men, just as he would open a bottle and drink with me
if I came into his camp.  I carried that whisky for social
purposes, and I so charged it up in my expense account to the
newspaper for which I worked.
<P>
Only in retrospect can I mark the almost imperceptible growth of
my desire.  There were little hints then that I did not take,
little straws in the wind that I did not see, little incidents the
gravity of which I did not realise.
<P>
For instance, for some years it had been my practice each winter
to cruise for six or eight weeks on San Francisco Bay.  My stout
sloop yacht, the Spray, had a comfortable cabin and a coal stove. 
A Korean boy did the cooking, and I usually took a friend or so
along to share the joys of the cruise.  Also, I took my machine
along and did my thousand words a day.  On the particular trip I
have in mind, Cloudesley and Toddy came along.  This was Toddy's
first trip.  On previous trips Cloudesley had elected to drink
beer; so I had kept the yacht supplied with beer and had drunk
beer with him.
<P>
But on this cruise the situation was different.  Toddy was so
nicknamed because of his diabolical cleverness in concocting
toddies.  So I brought whisky along--a couple of gallons.  Alas!
Many another gallon I bought, for Cloudesley and I got into the
habit of drinking a certain hot toddy that actually tasted
delicious going down and that carried the most exhilarating kick
imaginable.
<P>
I liked those toddies.  I grew to look forward to the making of
them.  We drank them regularly, one before breakfast, one before
dinner, one before supper, and a final one when we went to bed. 
We never got drunk.  But I will say that four times a day we were
very genial.  And when, in the middle of the cruise, Toddy was
called back to San Francisco on business, Cloudesley and I saw to
it that the Korean boy mixed toddies regularly for us according to
formula.
<P>
But that was only on the boat.  Back on the land, in my house, I
took no before breakfast eye-opener, no bed-going nightcap.  And I
haven't drunk hot toddies since, and that was many a year ago. 
But the point is, I LIKED those toddies.  The geniality of which
they were provocative was marvellous.  They were eloquent
proselyters for John Barleycorn in their own small insidious way. 
They were tickles of the something destined to grow into daily and
deadly desire.  And I didn't know, never dreamed--I, who had lived
with John Barleycorn for so many years and laughed at all his
unavailing attempts to win me.
