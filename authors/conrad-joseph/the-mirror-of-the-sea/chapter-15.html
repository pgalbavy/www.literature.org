<p> So seemed to think the new captain, who arrived the day after
we had finished loading, on the very eve of the day of sailing. 
I first beheld him on the quay, a complete stranger to me, obviously
not a Hollander, in a black bowler and a short drab overcoat,
ridiculously out of tone with the winter aspect of the waste-lands,
bordered by the brown fronts of houses with their roofs dripping
with melting snow.</p>

<p>This stranger was walking up and down absorbed in the marked
contemplation of the ship’s fore and aft trim; but when I saw
him squat on his heels in the slush at the very edge of the quay
to peer at the draught of water under her counter, I said to myself,
"This is the captain."  And presently I descried his luggage coming
along—a real sailor’s chest, carried by means of rope-beckets
between two men, with a couple of leather portmanteaus and a roll
of charts sheeted in canvas piled upon the lid.  The sudden, spontaneous
agility with which he bounded aboard right off the rail afforded
me the first glimpse of his real character.  Without further preliminaries
than a friendly nod, he addressed me: "You have got her pretty
well in her fore and aft trim. Now, what about your weights?"</p>

<p>I told him I had managed to keep the weight sufficiently well
up, as I thought, one-third of the whole being in the upper part
"above the beams," as the technical expression has it.  He whistled
"Phew!" scrutinizing me from head to foot.  A sort of smiling
vexation was visible on his ruddy face.</p>

<p>"Well, we shall have a lively time of it this passage, I bet,"
he said.</p>

<p>He knew.  It turned out he had been chief mate of her for the
two preceding voyages; and I was already familiar with his handwriting
in the old log-books I had been perusing in my cabin with a natural
curiosity, looking up the records of my new ship’s luck, of her
behaviour, of the good times she had had, and of the troubles
she had escaped.</p>

<p>He was right in his prophecy.  On our passage from Amsterdam
to Samarang with a general cargo, of which, alas! only one-third
in weight was stowed "above the beams," we had a lively time of
it.  It was lively, but not joyful.  There was not even a single
moment of comfort in it, because no seaman can feel comfortable
in body or mind when he has made his ship uneasy.</p>

<p>To travel along with a cranky ship for ninety days or so is no
doubt a nerve-trying experience; but in this case what was wrong
with our craft was this: that by my system of loading she had
been made much too stable.</p>

<p>Neither before nor since have I felt a ship roll so abruptly,
so violently, so heavily.  Once she began, you felt that she would
never stop, and this hopeless sensation, characterizing the motion
of ships whose centre of gravity is brought down too low in loading,
made everyone on board weary of keeping on his feet.  I remember
once over-hearing one of the hands say: "By Heavens, Jack!  I
feel as if I didn’t mind how soon I let myself go, and let the
blamed hooker knock my brains out if she likes."  The captain
used to remark frequently: "Ah, yes; I dare say one-third weight
above beams would have been quite enough for most ships. But then,
you see, there’s no two of them alike on the seas, and she’s an
uncommonly ticklish jade to load."</p>

<p>Down south, running before the gales of high latitudes, she made
our life a burden to us.  There were days when nothing would keep
even on the swing-tables, when there was no position where you
could fix yourself so as not to feel a constant strain upon all
the muscles of your body.  She rolled and rolled with an awful
dislodging jerk and that dizzily fast sweep of her masts on every
swing.  It was a wonder that the men sent aloft were not flung
off the yards, the yards not flung off the masts, the masts not
flung overboard.  The captain in his armchair, holding on grimly
at the head of the table, with the soup-tureen rolling on one
side of the cabin and the steward sprawling on the other, would
observe, looking at me: "That’s your one-third above the beams. 
The only thing that surprises me is that the sticks have stuck
to her all this time."</p>

<p>Ultimately some of the minor spars did go—nothing important:
spanker-booms and such-like—because at times the frightful impetus
of her rolling would part a fourfold tackle of new three-inch
Manilla line as if it were weaker than pack-thread.</p>

<p>It was only poetic justice that the chief mate who had made a
mistake—perhaps a half-excusable one—about the distribution of
his ship’s cargo should pay the penalty.  A piece of one of the
minor spars that did carry away flew against the chief mate’s
back, and sent him sliding on his face for quite a considerable
distance along the main deck. Thereupon followed various and unpleasant
consequences of a physical order—"queer symptoms," as the captain,
who treated them, used to say; inexplicable periods of powerlessness,
sudden accesses of mysterious pain; and the patient agreed fully
with the regretful mutters of his very attentive captain wishing
that it had been a straightforward broken leg. Even the Dutch
doctor who took the case up in Samarang offered no scientific
explanation.  All he said was: "Ah, friend, you are young yet;
it may be very serious for your whole life.  You must leave your
ship; you must quite silent be for three months—quite silent."</p>

<p>Of course, he meant the chief mate to keep quiet—to lay up, as
a matter of fact.  His manner was impressive enough, if his English
was childishly imperfect when compared with the fluency of Mr.
Hudig, the figure at the other end of that passage, and memorable
enough in its way.  In a great airy ward of a Far Eastern hospital,
lying on my back, I had plenty of leisure to remember the dreadful
cold and snow of Amsterdam, while looking at the fronds of the
palm-trees tossing and rustling at the height of the window. 
I could remember the elated feeling and the soul-gripping cold
of those tramway journeys taken into town to put what in diplomatic
language is called pressure upon the good Hudig, with his warm
fire, his armchair, his big cigar, and the never-failing suggestion
in his good-natured voice: "I suppose in the end it is you they
will appoint captain before the ship sails?"  It may have been
his extreme good-nature, the serious, unsmiling good-nature of
a fat, swarthy man with coal-black moustache and steady eyes;
but he might have been a bit of a diplomatist, too.  His enticing
suggestions I used to repel modestly by the assurance that it
was extremely unlikely, as I had not enough experience.  "You
know very well how to go about business matters," he used to say,
with a sort of affected moodiness clouding his serene round face. 
I wonder whether he ever laughed to himself after I had left the
office.  I dare say he never did, because I understand that diplomatists,
in and out of the career, take themselves and their tricks with
an exemplary seriousness.</p>

<p>But he had nearly persuaded me that I was fit in every way to
be trusted with a command.  There came three months of mental
worry, hard rolling, remorse, and physical pain to drive home
the lesson of insufficient experience.</p>

<p>Yes, your ship wants to be humoured with knowledge.  You must
treat with an understanding consideration the mysteries of her
feminine nature, and then she will stand by you faithfully in
the unceasing struggle with forces wherein defeat is no shame. 
It is a serious relation, that in which a man stands to his ship. 
She has her rights as though she could breathe and speak; and,
indeed, there are ships that, for the right man, will do anything
but speak, as the saying goes.</p>

<p>A ship is not a slave.  You must make her easy in a seaway, you
must never forget that you owe her the fullest share of your thought,
of your skill, of your self-love.  If you remember that obligation,
naturally and without effort, as if it were an instinctive feeling
of your inner life, she will sail, stay, run for you as long as
she is able, or, like a sea-bird going to rest upon the angry
waves, she will lay out the heaviest gale that ever made you doubt
living long enough to see another sunrise.</p>
