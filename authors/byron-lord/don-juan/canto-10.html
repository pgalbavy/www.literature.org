<p>
When Newton saw an apple fall, he found<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In that slight startle from his contemplation&mdash;<br/>
'T is said (for I 'll not answer above ground<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For any sage's creed or calculation)&mdash;<br/>
A mode of proving that the earth turn'd round<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a most natural whirl, called 'gravitation;'<br/>
And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,<br/>
Since Adam, with a fall or with an apple.

</p>
<p>
Man fell with apples, and with apples rose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If this be true; for we must deem the mode<br/>
In which Sir Isaac Newton could disclose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,<br/>
A thing to counterbalance human woes:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever since immortal man hath glow'd<br/>
With all kinds of mechanics, and full soon<br/>
Steam-engines will conduct him to the moon.

</p>
<p>
And wherefore this exordium?<br/>
&mdash;Why, just now,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In taking up this paltry sheet of paper,<br/>
My bosom underwent a glorious glow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my internal spirit cut a caper:<br/>
And though so much inferior, as I know,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who, by the dint of glass and vapour,<br/>
Discover stars and sail in the wind's eye,<br/>
I wish to do as much by poesy.

</p>
<p>
In the wind's eye I have sail'd, and sail; but for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars, I own my telescope is dim:<br/>
But at least I have shunn'd the common shore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaving land far out of sight, would skim<br/>
The ocean of eternity: the roar<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of breakers has not daunted my slight, trim,<br/>
But still sea-worthy skiff; and she may float<br/>
Where ships have founder'd, as doth many a boat.

</p>
<p>
We left our hero, Juan, in the bloom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of favouritism, but not yet in the blush;<br/>
And far be it from my Muses to presume<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(For I have more than one Muse at a push)<br/>
To follow him beyond the drawing-room:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is enough that Fortune found him flush<br/>
Of youth, and vigour, beauty, and those things<br/>
Which for an instant clip enjoyment's wings.

</p>
<p>
But soon they grow again and leave their nest.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Oh!' saith the Psalmist, 'that I had a dove's<br/>
Pinions to flee away, and be at rest!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And who that recollects young years and loves,&mdash;<br/>
Though hoary now, and with a withering breast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And palsied fancy, which no longer roves<br/>
Beyond its dimm'd eye's sphere,&mdash;but would much rather<br/>
Sigh like his son, than cough like his grandfather?

</p>
<p>
But sighs subside, and tears (even widows') shrink,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Arno in the summer, to a shallow,<br/>
So narrow as to shame their wintry brink,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which threatens inundations deep and yellow!<br/>
Such difference doth a few months make. You 'd think<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grief a rich field which never would lie fallow;<br/>
No more it doth, its ploughs but change their boys,<br/>
Who furrow some new soil to sow for joys.

</p>
<p>
But coughs will come when sighs depart&mdash;and now<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then before sighs cease; for oft the one<br/>
Will bring the other, ere the lake-like brow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is ruffled by a wrinkle, or the sun<br/>
Of life reach'd ten o'clock: and while a glow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,<br/>
O'erspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay,<br/>
Thousands blaze, love, hope, die,&mdash;how happy they!

</p>
<p>
But Juan was not meant to die so soon.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We left him in the focus of such glory<br/>
As may be won by favour of the moon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or ladies' fancies&mdash;rather transitory<br/>
Perhaps; but who would scorn the month of June,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because December, with his breath so hoary,<br/>
Must come? Much rather should he court the ray,<br/>
To hoard up warmth against a wintry day.

</p>
<p>
Besides, he had some qualities which fix<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle-aged ladies even more than young:<br/>
The former know what 's what; while new-fledged chicks<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Know little more of love than what is sung<br/>
In rhymes, or dreamt (for fancy will play tricks)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In visions of those skies from whence Love sprung.<br/>
Some reckon women by their suns or years,<br/>
I rather think the moon should date the dears.

</p>
<p>
And why? because she 's changeable and chaste.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I know no other reason, whatsoe'er<br/>
Suspicious people, who find fault in haste,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May choose to tax me with; which is not fair,<br/>
Nor flattering to 'their temper or their taste,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:<br/>
However, I forgive him, and I trust<br/>
He will forgive himself;&mdash;if not, I must.

</p>
<p>
Old enemies who have become new friends<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should so continue&mdash;'t is a point of honour;<br/>
And I know nothing which could make amends<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For a return to hatred: I would shun her<br/>
Like garlic, howsoever she extends<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.<br/>
Old flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes&mdash;<br/>
Converted foes should scorn to join with those.

</p>
<p>
This were the worst desertion:&mdash;renegadoes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even shuffling Southey, that incarnate lie,<br/>
Would scarcely join again the 'reformadoes,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom he forsook to fill the laureate's sty:<br/>
And honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether in Caledon or Italy,<br/>
Should not veer round with every breath, nor seize<br/>
To pain, the moment when you cease to please.

</p>
<p>
The lawyer and the critic but behold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The baser sides of literature and life,<br/>
And nought remains unseen, but much untold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By those who scour those double vales of strife.<br/>
While common men grow ignorantly old,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,<br/>
Dissecting the whole inside of a question,<br/>
And with it all the process of digestion.

</p>
<p>
A legal broom 's a moral chimney-sweeper,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that 's the reason he himself 's so dirty;<br/>
The endless soot bestows a tint far deeper<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than can be hid by altering his shirt; he<br/>
Retains the sable stains of the dark creeper,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,<br/>
In all their habits;&mdash;not so you, I own;<br/>
As Caesar wore his robe you wear your gown.

</p>
<p>
And all our little feuds, at least all mine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Jefferson, once my most redoubted foe<br/>
(As far as rhyme and criticism combine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make such puppets of us things below),<br/>
Are over: Here 's a health to 'Auld Lang Syne!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know you, and may never know<br/>
Your face&mdash;but you have acted on the whole<br/>
Most nobly, and I own it from my soul.

</p>
<p>
And when I use the phrase of 'Auld Lang Syne!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is not address'd to you&mdash;the more 's the pity<br/>
For me, for I would rather take my wine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With you, than aught (save Scott) in your proud city.<br/>
But somehow,&mdash;it may seem a schoolboy's whine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,<br/>
But I am half a Scot by birth, and bred<br/>
A whole one, and my heart flies to my head,&mdash;

</p>
<p>
As 'Auld Lang Syne' brings Scotland, one and all,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scotch plaids, Scotch snoods, the blue hills, and clear streams,<br/>
The Dee, the Don, Balgounie's brig's black wall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All my boy feelings, all my gentler dreams<br/>
Of what I then dreamt, clothed in their own pall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Banquo's offspring;&mdash;floating past me seems<br/>
My childhood in this childishness of mine:<br/>
I care not&mdash;'t is a glimpse of 'Auld Lang Syne.'

</p>
<p>
And though, as you remember, in a fit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wrath and rhyme, when juvenile and curly,<br/>
I rail'd at Scots to show my wrath and wit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which must be own'd was sensitive and surly,<br/>
Yet 't is in vain such sallies to permit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:<br/>
I 'scotch'd not kill'd' the Scotchman in my blood,<br/>
And love the land of 'mountain and of flood.'

</p>
<p>
Don Juan, who was real, or ideal,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For both are much the same, since what men think<br/>
Exists when the once thinkers are less real<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than what they thought, for mind can never sink,<br/>
And 'gainst the body makes a strong appeal;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet 't is very puzzling on the brink<br/>
Of what is call'd eternity, to stare,<br/>
And know no more of what is here, than there;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Don Juan grew a very polish'd Russian&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How we won't mention, why we need not say:<br/>
Few youthful minds can stand the strong concussion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of any slight temptation in their way;<br/>
But his just now were spread as is a cushion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth'd for a monarch's seat of honour; gay<br/>
Damsels, and dances, revels, ready money,<br/>
Made ice seem paradise, and winter sunny.

</p>
<p>
The favour of the empress was agreeable;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And though the duty wax'd a little hard,<br/>
Young people at his time of life should be able<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To come off handsomely in that regard.<br/>
He was now growing up like a green tree, able<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For love, war, or ambition, which reward<br/>
Their luckier votaries, till old age's tedium<br/>
Make some prefer the circulating medium.

</p>
<p>
About this time, as might have been anticipated,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seduced by youth and dangerous examples,<br/>
Don Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is a sad thing, and not only tramples<br/>
On our fresh feelings, but&mdash;as being participated<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all kinds of incorrigible samples<br/>
Of frail humanity&mdash;must make us selfish,<br/>
And shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish.

</p>
<p>
This we pass over. We will also pass<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual progress of intrigues between<br/>
Unequal matches, such as are, alas!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A young lieutenant's with a not old queen,<br/>
But one who is not so youthful as she was<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the royalty of sweet seventeen.<br/>
Sovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,

</p>
<p>
And Death, the sovereign's sovereign, though the great<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gracchus of all mortality, who levels<br/>
With his Agrarian laws the high estate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels,<br/>
To one small grass-grown patch (which must await<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Corruption for its crop) with the poor devils<br/>
Who never had a foot of land till now,&mdash;<br/>
Death 's a reformer, all men must allow.

</p>
<p>
He lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,<br/>
In this gay clime of bear-skins black and furry&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which (though I hate to say a thing that 's bitter)<br/>
Peep out sometimes, when things are in a flurry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the 'purple and fine linen,' fitter<br/>
For Babylon's than Russia's royal harlot&mdash;<br/>
And neutralize her outward show of scarlet.

</p>
<p>
And this same state we won't describe: we would<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps from hearsay, or from recollection;<br/>
But getting nigh grim Dante's 'obscure wood,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That horrid equinox, that hateful section<br/>
Of human years, that half-way house, that rude<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection<br/>
Life's sad post-horses o'er the dreary frontier<br/>
Of age, and looking back to youth, give one tear;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
I won't describe,&mdash;that is, if I can help<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Description; and I won't reflect,&mdash;that is,<br/>
If I can stave off thought, which&mdash;as a whelp<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clings to its teat&mdash;sticks to me through the abyss<br/>
Of this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss<br/>
Drains its first draught of lips:&mdash;but, as I said,<br/>
I won't philosophise, and will be read.

</p>
<p>
Juan, instead of courting courts, was courted,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing which happens rarely: this he owed<br/>
Much to his youth, and much to his reported<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Valour; much also to the blood he show'd,<br/>
Like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which set the beauty off in which he glow'd,<br/>
As purple clouds befringe the sun; but most<br/>
He owed to an old woman and his post.

</p>
<p>
He wrote to Spain:&mdash;and all his near relations,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perceiving fie was in a handsome way<br/>
Of getting on himself, and finding stations<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For cousins also, answer'd the same day.<br/>
Several prepared themselves for emigrations;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And eating ices, were o'erheard to say,<br/>
That with the addition of a slight pelisse,<br/>
Madrid's and Moscow's climes were of a piece.

</p>
<p>
His mother, Donna Inez, finding, too,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That in the lieu of drawing on his banker,<br/>
Where his assets were waxing rather few,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,&mdash;<br/>
Replied, 'that she was glad to see him through<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;<br/>
As the sole sign of man's being in his senses<br/>
Is, learning to reduce his past expenses.

</p>
<p>
'She also recommended him to God,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And no less to God's Son, as well as Mother,<br/>
Warn'd him against Greek worship, which looks odd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Catholic eyes; but told him, too, to smother<br/>
Outward dislike, which don't look well abroad;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Inform'd him that he had a little brother<br/>
Born in a second wedlock; and above<br/>
All, praised the empress's maternal love.

</p>
<p>
'She could not too much give her approbation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto an empress, who preferr'd young men<br/>
Whose age, and what was better still, whose nation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And climate, stopp'd all scandal (now and then):&mdash;<br/>
At home it might have given her some vexation;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But where thermometers sunk down to ten,<br/>
Or five, or one, or zero, she could never<br/>
Believe that virtue thaw'd before the river.'

</p>
<p>
O for a forty-parson power to chant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn<br/>
Loud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not practise! Oh for trumps of cherubim!<br/>
Or the ear-trumpet of my good old aunt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, though her spectacles at last grew dim,<br/>
Drew quiet consolation through its hint,<br/>
When she no more could read the pious print.

</p>
<p>
She was no hypocrite at least, poor soul,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But went to heaven in as sincere a way<br/>
As any body on the elected roll,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which portions out upon the judgment day<br/>
Heaven's freeholds, in a sort of doomsday scroll,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as the conqueror William did repay<br/>
His knights with, lotting others' properties<br/>
Into some sixty thousand new knights' fees.

</p>
<p>
I can't complain, whose ancestors are there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Erneis, Radulphus&mdash;eight-and-forty manors<br/>
(If that my memory doth not greatly err)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were their reward for following Billy's banners:<br/>
And though I can't help thinking 't was scarce fair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To strip the Saxons of their hydes, like tanners;<br/>
Yet as they founded churches with the produce,<br/>
You 'll deem, no doubt, they put it to a good use.

</p>
<p>
The gentle Juan flourish'd, though at times<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt like other plants called sensitive,<br/>
Which shrink from touch, as monarchs do from rhymes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save such as Southey can afford to give.<br/>
Perhaps he long'd in bitter frosts for climes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In which the Neva's ice would cease to live<br/>
Before May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,<br/>
In royalty's vast arms he sigh d for beauty:

</p>
<p>
Perhaps&mdash;but, sans perhaps, we need not seek<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For causes young or old: the canker-worm<br/>
Will feed upon the fairest, freshest cheek,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as further drain the wither'd form:<br/>
Care, like a housekeeper, brings every week<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His bills in, and however we may storm,<br/>
They must be paid: though six days smoothly run,<br/>
The seventh will bring blue devils or a dun.

</p>
<p>
I don't know how it was, but he grew sick:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The empress was alarm'd, and her physician<br/>
(The same who physick'd Peter) found the tick<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his fierce pulse betoken a condition<br/>
Which augur'd of the dead, however quick<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Itself, and show'd a feverish disposition;<br/>
At which the whole court was extremely troubled,<br/>
The sovereign shock'd, and all his medicines doubled.

</p>
<p>
Low were the whispers, manifold the rumours:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some said he had been poison'd by Potemkin;<br/>
Others talk'd learnedly of certain tumours,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;<br/>
Some said 't was a concoction of the humours,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which with the blood too readily will claim kin;<br/>
Others again were ready to maintain,<br/>
''T was only the fatigue of last campaign.'

</p>
<p>
But here is one prescription out of many:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sodae sulphat. 3vj. 3fs. Mannae optim.<br/>
Aq. fervent. f. 3ifs. 3ij. tinct. Sennae<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Haustus' (And here the surgeon came and cupp'd him)<br/>
'Rx Pulv Com gr. iij. Ipecacuanhae'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(With more beside if Juan had not stopp'd 'em).<br/>
'Bolus Potassae Sulphuret. sumendus,<br/>
Et haustus ter in die capiendus.'

</p>
<p>
This is the way physicians mend or end us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Secundum artem: but although we sneer<br/>
In health&mdash;when ill, we call them to attend us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the least propensity to jeer:<br/>
While that 'hiatus maxime deflendus'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fill'd up by spade or mattock's near,<br/>
Instead of gliding graciously down Lethe,<br/>
We tease mild Baillie, or soft Abernethy.

</p>
<p>
Juan demurr'd at this first notice to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Quit; and though death had threaten'd an ejection,<br/>
His youth and constitution bore him through,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sent the doctors in a new direction.<br/>
But still his state was delicate: the hue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of health but flicker'd with a faint reflection<br/>
Along his wasted cheek, and seem'd to gravel<br/>
The faculty&mdash;who said that he must travel.

</p>
<p>
The climate was too cold, they said, for him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Meridian-born, to bloom in. This opinion<br/>
Made the chaste Catherine look a little grim,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who did not like at first to lose her minion:<br/>
But when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,<br/>
She then resolved to send him on a mission,<br/>
But in a style becoming his condition.

</p>
<p>
There was just then a kind of a discussion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sort of treaty or negotiation<br/>
Between the British cabinet and Russian,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain'd with all the due prevarication<br/>
With which great states such things are apt to push on;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Something about the Baltic's navigation,<br/>
Hides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,<br/>
Which Britons deem their 'uti possidetis.'

</p>
<p>
So Catherine, who had a handsome way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fitting out her favourites, conferr'd<br/>
This secret charge on Juan, to display<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At once her royal splendour, and reward<br/>
His services. He kiss'd hands the next day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Received instructions how to play his card,<br/>
Was laden with all kinds of gifts and honours,<br/>
Which show'd what great discernment was the donor's.

</p>
<p>
But she was lucky, and luck 's all. Your queens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are generally prosperous in reigning;<br/>
Which puzzles us to know what Fortune means.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But to continue: though her years were waning<br/>
Her climacteric teased her like her teens;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And though her dignity brook'd no complaining,<br/>
So much did Juan's setting off distress her,<br/>
She could not find at first a fit successor.

</p>
<p>
But time, the comforter, will come at last;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number<br/>
Of candidates requesting to be placed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:&mdash;<br/>
Not that she meant to fix again in haste,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did she find the quantity encumber,<br/>
But always choosing with deliberation,<br/>
Kept the place open for their emulation.

</p>
<p>
While this high post of honour 's in abeyance,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For one or two days, reader, we request<br/>
You 'll mount with our young hero the conveyance<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which wafted him from Petersburgh: the best<br/>
Barouche, which had the glory to display once<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair czarina's autocratic crest,<br/>
When, a new lphigene, she went to Tauris,<br/>
Was given to her favourite, and now bore his.

</p>
<p>
A bull-dog, and a bullfinch, and an ermine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All private favourites of Don Juan;&mdash;for<br/>
(Let deeper sages the true cause determine)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a kind of inclination, or<br/>
Weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Live animals: an old maid of threescore<br/>
For cats and birds more penchant ne'er display'd,<br/>
Although he was not old, nor even a maid;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
The animals aforesaid occupied<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their station: there were valets, secretaries,<br/>
In other vehicles; but at his side<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat little Leila, who survived the parries<br/>
He made 'gainst Cossacque sabres, in the wide<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaughter of Ismail. Though my wild Muse varies<br/>
Her note, she don't forget the infant girl<br/>
Whom he preserved, a pure and living pearl

</p>
<p>
Poor little thing! She was as fair as docile,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that gentle, serious character,<br/>
As rare in living beings as a fossile<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, 'midst thy mouldy mammoths, 'grand Cuvier!'<br/>
Ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With this o'erwhelming world, where all must err:<br/>
But she was yet but ten years old, and therefore<br/>
Was tranquil, though she knew not why or wherefore.

</p>
<p>
Don Juan loved her, and she loved him, as<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor brother, father, sister, daughter love.<br/>
I cannot tell exactly what it was;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not yet quite old enough to prove<br/>
Parental feelings, and the other class,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Call'd brotherly affection, could not move<br/>
His bosom,&mdash;for he never had a sister:<br/>
Ah! if he had, how much he would have miss'd her!

</p>
<p>
And still less was it sensual; for besides<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he was not an ancient debauchee<br/>
(Who like sour fruit, to stir their veins' salt tides,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As acids rouse a dormant alkali),<br/>
Although ('t will happen as our planet guides)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His youth was not the chastest that might be,<br/>
There was the purest Platonism at bottom<br/>
Of all his feelings&mdash;only he forgot 'em.

</p>
<p>
Just now there was no peril of temptation;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved the infant orphan he had saved,<br/>
As patriots (now and then) may love a nation;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved<br/>
Owing to him;&mdash;as also her salvation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through his means and the church's might be paved.<br/>
But one thing 's odd, which here must be inserted,<br/>
The little Turk refused to be converted.

</p>
<p>
'T was strange enough she should retain the impression<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;<br/>
But though three bishops told her the transgression,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She show'd a great dislike to holy water:<br/>
She also had no passion for confession;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps she had nothing to confess:&mdash;no matter,<br/>
Whate'er the cause, the church made little of it&mdash;<br/>
She still held out that Mahomet was a prophet.

</p>
<p>
In fact, the only Christian she could bear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Juan; whom she seem'd to have selected<br/>
In place of what her home and friends once were.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He naturally loved what he protected:<br/>
And thus they form'd a rather curious pair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A guardian green in years, a ward connected<br/>
In neither clime, time, blood, with her defender;<br/>
And yet this want of ties made theirs more tender.

</p>
<p>
They journey'd on through Poland and through Warsaw,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Famous for mines of salt and yokes of iron:<br/>
Through Courland also, which that famous farce saw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which gave her dukes the graceless name of 'Biron.'<br/>
'T is the same landscape which the modern Mars saw,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who march'd to Moscow, led by Fame, the siren!<br/>
To lose by one month's frost some twenty years<br/>
Of conquest, and his guard of grenadiers.

</p>
<p>
Let this not seem an anti-climax:&mdash;'Oh!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My guard! my old guard exclaim'd!' exclaim'd that god of day.<br/>
Think of the Thunderer's falling down below<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Carotid-artery-cutting Castlereagh!<br/>
Alas, that glory should be chill'd by snow!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But should we wish to warm us on our way<br/>
Through Poland, there is Kosciusko's name<br/>
Might scatter fire through ice, like Hecla's flame.

</p>
<p>
From Poland they came on through Prussia Proper,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Konigsberg the capital, whose vaunt,<br/>
Besides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has lately been the great Professor Kant.<br/>
Juan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About philosophy, pursued his jaunt<br/>
To Germany, whose somewhat tardy millions<br/>
Have princes who spur more than their postilions.

</p>
<p>
And thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he reach'd the castellated Rhine:&mdash;<br/>
Ye glorious Gothic scenes! how much ye strike<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All phantasies, not even excepting mine;<br/>
A grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make my soul pass the equinoctial line<br/>
Between the present and past worlds, and hover<br/>
Upon their airy confine, half-seas-over.

</p>
<p>
But Juan posted on through Manheim, Bonn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Drachenfels frowns over like a spectre<br/>
Of the good feudal times forever gone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On which I have not time just now to lecture.<br/>
From thence he was drawn onwards to Cologne,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A city which presents to the inspector<br/>
Eleven thousand maidenheads of bone,<br/>
The greatest number flesh hath ever known.

</p>
<p>
From thence to Holland's Hague and Helvoetsluys,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That water-land of Dutchmen and of ditches,<br/>
Where juniper expresses its best juice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor man's sparkling substitute for riches.<br/>
Senates and sages have condemn'd its use&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But to deny the mob a cordial, which is<br/>
Too often all the clothing, meat, or fuel,<br/>
Good government has left them, seems but cruel.

</p>
<p>
Here he embark'd, and with a flowing sail<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Went bounding for the island of the free,<br/>
Towards which the impatient wind blew half a gale;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;High dash'd the spray, the bows dipp'd in the sea,<br/>
And sea-sick passengers turn'd somewhat pale;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Juan, season'd, as he well might be,<br/>
By former voyages, stood to watch the skiffs<br/>
Which pass'd, or catch the first glimpse of the cliffs.

</p>
<p>
At length they rose, like a white wall along<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue sea's border; and I Don Juan felt&mdash;<br/>
What even young strangers feel a little strong<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first sight of Albion's chalky belt&mdash;<br/>
A kind of pride that he should be among<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt<br/>
Their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,<br/>
And made the very billows pay them toll.

</p>
<p>
I 've no great cause to love that spot of earth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which holds what might have been the noblest nation;<br/>
But though I owe it little but my birth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel a mix'd regret and veneration<br/>
For its decaying fame and former worth.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven years (the usual term of transportation)<br/>
Of absence lay one's old resentments level,<br/>
When a man's country 's going to the devil.

</p>
<p>
Alas! could she but fully, truly, know<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How her great name is now throughout abhorr'd:<br/>
How eager all the earth is for the blow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;<br/>
How all the nations deem her their worst foe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That worse than worst of foes, the once adored<br/>
False friend, who held out freedom to mankind,<br/>
And now would chain them, to the very mind:&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Would she be proud, or boast herself the free,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is but first of slaves? The nations are<br/>
In prison,&mdash;but the gaoler, what is he?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No less a victim to the bolt and bar.<br/>
Is the poor privilege to turn the key<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the captive, freedom? He 's as far<br/>
From the enjoyment of the earth and air<br/>
Who watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.

</p>
<p>
Don Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy cliffs, dear Dover! harbour, and hotel;<br/>
Thy custom-house, with all its delicate duties;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy waiters running mucks at every bell;<br/>
Thy packets, all whose passengers are booties<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who upon land or water dwell;<br/>
And last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,<br/>
Thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted.

</p>
<p>
Juan, though careless, young, and magnifique,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,<br/>
Who did not limit much his bills per week,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet stared at this a little, though he paid it<br/>
(His Maggior Duomo, a smart, subtle Greek,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before him summ'd the awful scroll and read it);<br/>
But doubtless as the air, though seldom sunny,<br/>
Is free, the respiration's worth the money.

</p>
<p>
On with the horses! Off to Canterbury!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tramp, tramp o'er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;<br/>
Hurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not like slow Germany, wherein they muddle<br/>
Along the road, as if they went to bury<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle<br/>
With 'schnapps'&mdash;sad dogs! whom 'Hundsfot,' or 'Verflucter,'<br/>
Affect no more than lightning a conductor.

</p>
<p>
Now there is nothing gives a man such spirits,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,<br/>
As going at full speed&mdash;no matter where its<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Direction be, so 't is but in a hurry,<br/>
And merely for the sake of its own merits;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the less cause there is for all this flurry,<br/>
The greater is the pleasure in arriving<br/>
At the great end of travel&mdash;which is driving.

</p>
<p>
They saw at Canterbury the cathedral;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Edward's helm, and Becket's bloody stone,<br/>
Were pointed out as usual by the bedral,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same quaint, uninterested tone:&mdash;<br/>
There 's glory again for you, gentle reader! All<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ends in a rusty casque and dubious bone,<br/>
Half-solved into these sodas or magnesias;<br/>
Which form that bitter draught, the human species.

</p>
<p>
The effect on Juan was of course sublime:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He breathed a thousand Cressys, as he saw<br/>
That casque, which never stoop'd except to Time.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the bold Churchman's tomb excited awe,<br/>
Who died in the then great attempt to climb<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er kings, who now at least must talk of law<br/>
Before they butcher. Little Leila gazed,<br/>
And ask'd why such a structure had been raised:

</p>
<p>
And being told it was 'God's house,' she said<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He was well lodged, but only wonder'd how<br/>
He suffer'd Infidels in his homestead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The cruel Nazarenes, who had laid low<br/>
His holy temples in the lands which bred<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The True Believers:&mdash;and her infant brow<br/>
Was bent with grief that Mahomet should resign<br/>
A mosque so noble, flung like pearls to swine.

</p>
<p>
O! oh! through meadows managed like a garden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A paradise of hops and high production;<br/>
For after years of travel by a bard in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries of greater heat, but lesser suction,<br/>
A green field is a sight which makes him pardon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence of that more sublime construction,<br/>
Which mixes up vines, olives, precipices,<br/>
Glaciers, volcanos, oranges, and ices.

</p>
<p>
And when I think upon a pot of beer&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I won't weep!&mdash;and so drive on, postilions!<br/>
As the smart boys spurr'd fast in their career,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan admired these highways of free millions;<br/>
A country in all senses the most dear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To foreigner or native, save some silly ones,<br/>
Who 'kick against the pricks' just at this juncture,<br/>
And for their pains get only a fresh puncture.

</p>
<p>
What a delightful thing 's a turnpike road!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving<br/>
The earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.<br/>
Had such been cut in Phaeton's time, the god<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had told his son to satisfy his craving<br/>
With the York mail;&mdash;but onward as we roll,<br/>
'Surgit amari aliquid'&mdash;the toll

</p>
<p>
Alas, how deeply painful is all payment!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take lives, take wives, take aught except men's purses:<br/>
As Machiavel shows those in purple raiment,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the shortest way to general curses.<br/>
They hate a murderer much less than a claimant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On that sweet ore which every body nurses;&mdash;<br/>
Kill a man's family, and he may brook it,<br/>
But keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket.

</p>
<p>
So said the Florentine: ye monarchs, hearken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To your instructor. Juan now was borne,<br/>
Just as the day began to wane and darken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the high hill, which looks with pride or scorn<br/>
Toward the great city.<br/>
&mdash;Ye who have a spark in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your veins of Cockney spirit, smile or mourn<br/>
According as you take things well or ill;&mdash;<br/>
Bold Britons, we are now on Shooter's Hill!

</p>
<p>
The sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-unquench'd volcano, o'er a space<br/>
Which well beseem'd the 'Devil's drawing-room,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As some have qualified that wondrous place:<br/>
But Juan felt, though not approaching home,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who, though he were not of the race,<br/>
Revered the soil, of those true sons the mother,<br/>
Who butcher'd half the earth, and bullied t' other.

</p>
<p>
A mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye<br/>
Could reach, with here and there a sail just skipping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In sight, then lost amidst the forestry<br/>
Of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;<br/>
A huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown<br/>
On a fool's head&mdash;and there is London Town!

</p>
<p>
But Juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Appear'd to him but as the magic vapour<br/>
Of some alchymic furnace, from whence broke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wealth of worlds (a wealth of tax and paper):<br/>
The gloomy clouds, which o'er it as a yoke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are bow'd, and put the sun out like a taper,<br/>
Were nothing but the natural atmosphere,<br/>
Extremely wholesome, though but rarely clear.

</p>
<p>
He paused&mdash;and so will I; as doth a crew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they give their broadside. By and by,<br/>
My gentle countrymen, we will renew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our old acquaintance; and at least I 'll try<br/>
To tell you truths you will not take as true,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are so;&mdash;a male Mrs. Fry,<br/>
With a soft besom will I sweep your halls,<br/>
And brush a web or two from off the walls.

</p>
<p>
O Mrs. Fry! Why go to Newgate? Why<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Preach to poor rogues? And wherefore not begin<br/>
With Carlton, or with other houses? Try<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your head at harden'd and imperial sin.<br/>
To mend the people 's an absurdity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A jargon, a mere philanthropic din,<br/>
Unless you make their betters better:<br/>
&mdash;Fy!<br/>
I thought you had more religion, Mrs. Fry.

</p>
<p>
Teach them the decencies of good threescore;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cure them of tours, hussar and highland dresses;<br/>
Tell them that youth once gone returns no more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That hired huzzas redeem no land's distresses;<br/>
Tell them Sir William Curtis is a bore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Too dull even for the dullest of excesses,<br/>
The witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,<br/>
A fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all.

</p>
<p>
Tell them, though it may be perhaps too late,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated,<br/>
To set up vain pretence of being great,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is not so to be good; and be it stated,<br/>
The worthiest kings have ever loved least state;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell them<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;But you won't, and I have prated<br/>
Just now enough; but by and by I 'll prattle<br/>
Like Roland's horn in Roncesvalles' battle.
