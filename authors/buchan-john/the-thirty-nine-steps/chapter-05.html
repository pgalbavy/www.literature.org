<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I sat down on the very crest of the pass and took stock of my
position.</p>

<p>Behind me was the road climbing through a long cleft in the hills,
which was the upper glen of some notable river. In front was a
flat space of maybe a mile, all pitted with bog-holes and rough
with tussocks, and then beyond it the road fell steeply down another
glen to a plain whose blue dimness melted into the distance. To
left and right were round-shouldered green hills as smooth as
pancakes, but to the south—that is, the left hand—there was a
glimpse of high heathery mountains, which I remembered from the
map as the big knot of hill which I had chosen for my sanctuary.
I was on the central boss of a huge upland country, and could
see everything moving for miles. In the meadows below the road
half a mile back a cottage smoked, but it was the only sign of
human life. Otherwise there was only the calling of plovers and
the tinkling of little streams.</p>

<p>It was now about seven o’clock, and as I waited I heard once
again that ominous beat in the air. Then I realized that my vantage-ground
might be in reality a trap. There was no cover for a tomtit in
those bald green places.</p>

<p>I sat quite still and hopeless while the beat grew louder. Then
I saw an aeroplane coming up from the east. It was flying high,
but as I looked it dropped several hundred feet and began to circle
round the knot of hill in narrowing circles, just as a hawk wheels
before it pounces. Now it was flying very low, and now the observer
on board caught sight of me. I could see one of the two occupants
examining me through glasses.</p>

<p>Suddenly it began to rise in swift whorls, and the next I knew
it was speeding eastward again till it became a speck in the blue
morning.</p>

<p>That made me do some savage thinking. My enemies had located
me, and the next thing would be a cordon round me. I didn’t know
what force they could command, but I was certain it would be sufficient.
The aeroplane had seen my bicycle, and would conclude that I would
try to escape by the road. In that case there might be a chance
on the moors to the right or left. I wheeled the machine a hundred
yards from the highway, and plunged it into a moss-hole, where
it sank among pond-weed and water-buttercups. Then I climbed to
a knoll which gave me a view of the two valleys. Nothing was stirring
on the long white ribbon that threaded them.</p>

<p>I have said there was not cover in the whole place to hide a
rat. As the day advanced it was flooded with soft fresh light
till it had the fragrant sunniness of the South African veld.
At other times I would have liked the place, but now it seemed
to suffocate me. The free moorlands were prison walls, and the
keen hill air was the breath of a dungeon.</p>

<p>I tossed a coin—heads right, tails left—and it fell heads, so
I turned to the north. In a little I came to the brow of the ridge
which was the containing wall of the pass. I saw the highroad
for maybe ten miles, and far down it something that was moving,
and that I took to be a motor-car. Beyond the ridge I looked on
a rolling green moor, which fell away into wooded glens.</p>

<p>Now my life on the veld has given me the eyes of a kite, and
I can see things for which most men need a telescope.... Away
down the slope, a couple of miles away, several men were advancing,
like a row of beaters at a shoot.</p>

<p>I dropped out of sight behind the sky-line. That way was shut
to me, and I must try the bigger hills to the south beyond the
highway. The car I had noticed was getting nearer, but it was
still a long way off with some very steep gradients before it.
I ran hard, crouching low except in the hollows, and as I ran
I kept scanning the brow of the hill before me. Was it imagination,
or did I see figures—one, two, perhaps more—moving in a glen beyond
the stream?</p>

<p>If you are hemmed in on all sides in a patch of land there is
only one chance of escape. You must stay in the patch, and let
your enemies search it and not find you. That was good sense,
but how on earth was I to escape notice in that table-cloth of
a place? I would have buried myself to the neck in mud or lain
below water or climbed the tallest tree. But there was not a stick
of wood, the bog-holes were little puddles, the stream was a slender
trickle. There was nothing but short heather, and bare hill bent,
and the white highway.</p>

<p>Then in a tiny bight of road, beside a heap of stones, I found
the roadman.</p>

<p>He had just arrived, and was wearily flinging down his hammer.
He looked at me with a fishy eye and yawned.</p>

<p>"Confoond the day I ever left the herdin’!" he said, as if to
the world at large. "There I was my ain maister. Now I’m a slave
to the Goavernment, tethered to the roadside, wi’ sair een, and
a back like a suckle."</p>

<p>He took up the hammer, struck a stone, dropped the implement
with an oath, and put both hands to his ears. "Mercy on me! My
heid’s burstin’!" he cried.</p>

<p>He was a wild figure, about my own size but much bent, with a
week’s beard on his chin, and a pair of big horn spectacles.</p>

<p>"I canna dae’t," he cried again. "The Surveyor maun just report
me. I’m for my bed."</p>

<p>I asked him what was the trouble, though indeed that was clear
enough.</p>

<p>"The trouble is that I’m no sober. Last nicht my dochter Merran
was waddit, and they danced till fower in the byre. Me and some
ither chiels sat down to the drinkin’, and here I am. Peety that
I ever lookit on the wine when it was red!"</p>

<p>I agreed with him about bed.</p>

<p>"It’s easy speakin’," he moaned. "But I got a postcard yestreen
sayin’ that the new Road Surveyor would be round the day. He’ll
come and he’ll no find me, or else he’ll find me fou, and either
way I’m a done man. I’ll awa’ back to my bed and say I’m no weel,
but I doot that’ll no help me, for they ken my kind o’ no-weel-ness."</p>

<p>Then I had an inspiration. "Does the new Surveyor know you?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"No him. He’s just been a week at the job. He rins about in a
wee motor-cawr, and wad speir the inside oot o’ a whelk."</p>

<p>"Where’s your house?" I asked, and was directed by a wavering
finger to the cottage by the stream.</p>

<p>"Well, back to your bed," I said, "and sleep in peace. I’ll take
on your job for a bit and see the Surveyor."</p>

<p>He stared at me blankly; then, as the notion dawned on his fuddled
brain, his face broke into the vacant drunkard’s smile.</p>

<p>"You’re the billy," he cried. "It’ll be easy eneuch managed.
I’ve finished that bing o’ stanes, so you needna chap ony mair
this forenoon. Just take the barry, and wheel eneuch metal frae
yon quarry doon the road to mak anither bing the morn. My name’s
Alexander Trummle, and I’ve been seeven year at the trade, and
twenty afore that herdin’ on Leithen Water. My freens ca’ me Ecky,
and whiles Specky, for I wear glesses, being waik i’ the sicht.
Just you speak the Surveyor fair, and ca’ him Sir, and he’ll be
fell pleased. I’ll be back or midday."</p>

<p>I borrowed his spectacles and filthy old hat; stripped off coat,
waistcoat, and collar, and gave him them to carry home; borrowed,
too, the foul stump of a clay pipe as an extra property. He indicated
my simple tasks, and without more ado set off at an amble bedwards.
Bed may have been his chief object, but I think there was also
something left in the foot of a bottle. I prayed that he might
be safe under cover before my friends arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>Then I set to work to dress for the part. I opened the collar
of my shirt—it was a vulgar blue-and-white check such as ploughmen
wear—and revealed a neck as brown as any tinker’s. I rolled up
my sleeves, and there was a forearm which might have been a blacksmith’s,
sunburnt and rough with old scars. I got my boots and trouser-legs
all white from the dust of the road, and hitched up my trousers,
tying them with string below the knee. Then I set to work on my
face. With a handful of dust I made a water-mark round my neck,
the place where Mr Turnbull’s Sunday ablutions might be expected
to stop. I rubbed a good deal of dirt also into the sunburn of
my cheeks. A roadman’s eyes would no doubt be a little inflamed,
so I contrived to get some dust in both of mine, and by dint of
vigorous rubbing produced a bleary effect.</p>

<p>The sandwiches Sir Harry had given me had gone off with my coat,
but the roadman’s lunch, tied up in a red handkerchief, was at
my disposal. I ate with great relish several of the thick slabs
of scone and cheese and drank a little of the cold tea. In the
handkerchief was a local paper tied with string and addressed
to Mr Turnbull—obviously meant to solace his midday leisure. I
did up the bundle again, and put the paper conspicuously beside
it.</p>

<p>My boots did not satisfy me, but by dint of kicking among the
stones I reduced them to the granite-like surface which marks
a roadman’s footgear. Then I bit and scraped my finger-nails till
the edges were all cracked and uneven. The men I was matched against
would miss no detail. I broke one of the bootlaces and retied
it in a clumsy knot, and loosed the other so that my thick grey
socks bulged over the uppers. Still no sign of anything on the
road. The motor I had observed half an hour ago must have gone
home.</p>

<p>My toilet complete, I took up the barrow and began my journeys
to and from the quarry a hundred yards off.</p>

<p>I remember an old scout in Rhodesia, who had done many queer
things in his day, once telling me that the secret of playing
a part was to think yourself into it. You could never keep it
up, he said, unless you could manage to convince yourself that
you were <em>it</em>. So I shut off all other thoughts and switched
them on to the road-mending. I thought of the little white cottage
as my home, I recalled the years I had spent herding on Leithen
Water, I made my mind dwell lovingly on sleep in a box-bed and
a bottle of cheap whisky. Still nothing appeared on that long
white road.</p>

<p>Now and then a sheep wandered off the heather to stare at me.
A heron flopped down to a pool in the stream and started to fish,
taking no more notice of me than if I had been a milestone. On
I went, trundling my loads of stone, with the heavy step of the
professional. Soon I grew warm, and the dust on my face changed
into solid and abiding grit. I was already counting the hours
till evening should put a limit to Mr Turnbull’s monotonous toil.</p>

<p>Suddenly a crisp voice spoke from the road, and looking up I
saw a little Ford two-seater, and a round-faced young man in a
bowler hat.</p>

<p>"Are you Alexander Turnbull?" he asked. "I am the new County
Road Surveyor. You live at Blackhopefoot, and have charge of the
section from Laidlawbyres to the Riggs? Good! A fair bit of road,
Turnbull, and not badly engineered. A little soft about a mile
off, and the edges want cleaning. See you look after that. Good
morning. You’ll know me the next time you see me."</p>

<p>Clearly my get-up was good enough for the dreaded Surveyor. I
went on with my work, and as the morning grew towards noon I was
cheered by a little traffic. A baker’s van breasted the hill,
and sold me a bag of ginger biscuits which I stowed in my trouser-pockets
against emergencies. Then a herd passed with sheep, and disturbed
me somewhat by asking loudly, "What had become o’ Specky?"</p>

<p>"In bed wi’ the colic," I replied, and the herd passed on....</p>

<p>Just about midday a big car stole down the hill, glided past
and drew up a hundred yards beyond. Its three occupants descended
as if to stretch their legs, and sauntered towards me.</p>

<p>Two of the men I had seen before from the window of the Galloway
inn—one lean, sharp, and dark, the other comfortable and smiling.
The third had the look of a countryman—a vet, perhaps, or a small
farmer. He was dressed in ill-cut knickerbockers, and the eye
in his head was as bright and wary as a hen’s.</p>

<p>"Morning," said the last. "That’s a fine easy job o’ yours."</p>

<p>I had not looked up on their approach, and now, when accosted,
I slowly and painfully straightened my back, after the manner
of roadmen; spat vigorously, after the manner of the low Scot;
and regarded them steadily before replying. I confronted three
pairs of eyes that missed nothing.</p>

<p>"There’s waur jobs and there’s better," I said sententiously.
"I wad rather hae yours, sittin’ a’ day on your hinderlands on
thae cushions. It’s you and your muckle cawrs that wreck my roads!
If we a’ had oor richts, ye sud be made to mend what ye break."</p>

<p>The bright-eyed man was looking at the newspaper lying beside
Turnbull’s bundle.</p>

<p>"I see you get your papers in good time," he said.</p>

<p>I glanced at it casually. "Aye, in gude time. Seein’ that that
paper cam’ out last Setterday I’m just sax days late."</p>

<p>He picked it up, glanced at the superscription, and laid it down
again. One of the others had been looking at my boots, and a word
in German called the speaker’s attention to them.</p>

<p>"You’ve a fine taste in boots," he said. "These were never made
by a country shoemaker."</p>

<p>"They were not," I said readily. "They were made in London. I
got them frae the gentleman that was here last year for the shootin’.
What was his name now?" And I scratched a forgetful head. Again
the sleek one spoke in German. "Let us get on," he said. "This
fellow is all right."</p>

<p>They asked one last question.</p>

<p>"Did you see anyone pass early this morning? He might be on a
bicycle or he might be on foot."</p>

<p>I very nearly fell into the trap and told a story of a bicyclist
hurrying past in the grey dawn. But I had the sense to see my
danger. I pretended to consider very deeply.</p>

<p>"I wasna up very early," I said. "Ye see, my dochter was merrit
last nicht, and we keepit it up late. I opened the house door
about seeven and there was naebody on the road then. Since I cam
up here there has just been the baker and the Ruchill herd, besides
you gentlemen."</p>

<p>One of them gave me a cigar, which I smelt gingerly and stuck
in Turnbull’s bundle. They got into their car and were out of
sight in three minutes.</p>

<p>My heart leaped with an enormous relief, but I went on wheeling
my stones. It was as well, for ten minutes later the car returned,
one of the occupants waving a hand to me. Those gentry left nothing
to chance.</p>

<p>I finished Turnbull’s bread and cheese, and pretty soon I had
finished the stones. The next step was what puzzled me. I could
not keep up this roadmaking business for long. A merciful Providence
had kept Mr Turnbull indoors, but if he appeared on the scene
there would be trouble. I had a notion that the cordon was still
tight round the glen, and that if I walked in any direction I
should meet with questioners. But get out I must. No man’s nerve
could stand more than a day of being spied on.</p>

<p>I stayed at my post till five o’clock. By that time I had resolved
to go down to Turnbull’s cottage at nightfall and take my chance
of getting over the hills in the darkness. But suddenly a new
car came up the road, and slowed down a yard or two from me. A
fresh wind had risen, and the occupant wanted to light a cigarette.</p>

<p>It was a touring car, with the tonneau full of an assortment
of baggage. One man sat in it, and by an amazing chance I knew
him. His name was Marmaduke Jopley, and he was an offence to creation.
He was a sort of blood stockbroker, who did his business by toadying
eldest sons and rich young peers and foolish old ladies. "Marmie’
was a familiar figure, I understood, at balls and polo-weeks and
country houses. He was an adroit scandal-monger, and would crawl
a mile on his belly to anything that had a title or a million.
I had a business introduction to his firm when I came to London,
and he was good enough to ask me to dinner at his club. There
he showed off at a great rate, and pattered about his duchesses
till the snobbery of the creature turned me sick. I asked a man
afterwards why nobody kicked him, and was told that Englishmen
reverenced the weaker sex.</p>

<p>Anyhow there he was now, nattily dressed, in a fine new car,
obviously on his way to visit some of his smart friends. A sudden
daftness took me, and in a second I had jumped into the tonneau
and had him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Jopley," I sang out. "Well met, my lad!" He got a horrid
fright. His chin dropped as he stared at me. "Who the devil are
you?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"My name’s Hannay," I said. "From Rhodesia, you remember."</p>

<p>"Good God, the murderer!" he choked.</p>

<p>"Just so. And there’ll be a second murder, my dear, if you don’t
do as I tell you. Give me that coat of yours. That cap, too."</p>

<p>He did as he was bid, for he was blind with terror. Over my dirty
trousers and vulgar shirt I put on his smart driving-coat, which
buttoned high at the top and thereby hid the deficiencies of my
collar. I stuck the cap on my head, and added his gloves to my
get-up. The dusty roadman in a minute was transformed into one
of the neatest motorists in Scotland. On Mr Jopley’s head I clapped
Turnbull’s unspeakable hat, and told him to keep it there.</p>

<p>Then with some difficulty I turned the car. My plan was to go
back the road he had come, for the watchers, having seen it before,
would probably let it pass unremarked, and Marmie’s figure was
in no way like mine.</p>

<p>"Now, my child," I said, "sit quite still and be a good boy.
I mean you no harm. I’m only borrowing your car for an hour or
two. But if you play me any tricks, and above all if you open
your mouth, as sure as there’s a God above me I’ll wring your
neck. <em>Savez?</em>"</p>

<p>I enjoyed that evening’s ride. We ran eight miles down the valley,
through a village or two, and I could not help noticing several
strange-looking folk lounging by the roadside. These were the
watchers who would have had much to say to me if I had come in
other garb or company. As it was, they looked incuriously on.
One touched his cap in salute, and I responded graciously.</p>

<p>As the dark fell I turned up a side glen which, as I remember
from the map, led into an unfrequented corner of the hills. Soon
the villages were left behind, then the farms, and then even the
wayside cottage. Presently we came to a lonely moor where the
night was blackening the sunset gleam in the bog pools. Here we
stopped, and I obligingly reversed the car and restored to Mr
Jopley his belongings.</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks," I said. "There’s more use in you than I
thought. Now be off and find the police."</p>

<p>As I sat on the hillside, watching the tail-light dwindle, I
reflected on the various kinds of crime I had now sampled. Contrary
to general belief, I was not a murderer, but I had become an unholy
liar, a shameless impostor, and a highwayman with a marked taste
for expensive motor-cars.</p>
