<p>It was a dreadful game the hunter with the terrible gun and Lightfoot
the Deer were playing in the Green Forest. It was a matching of
wit against wit, the hunter seeking to take Lightfoot's life,
and Lightfoot seeking to save it. The experience of other years
had taught Lightfoot much of the ways of hunters and not one of
the things he had learned about them was forgotten. But the hunter
in his turn knew much of the ways of Deer. So it was that each
was trying his best to outguess the other.</p>

<p>When the hunter found the hiding-place Lightfoot had left at
the warning of Sammy Jay he followed Lightfoot's tracks for a
short distance. It was slow work, and only one whose eyes had
been trained to notice little things could have done it. You see,
there was no snow, and only now and then, when he had stepped
on a bit of soft ground, had Lightfoot left a footprint. But there
were other signs which the hunter knew how to read,&mdash;a freshly
upturned leaf here, and here, a bit of moss lightly crushed. These
things told the hunter which way Lightfoot had gone.</p>

<p>Slowly, patiently, watchfully, the hunter followed. After a while
he stopped with a satisfied grin. "I thought as much," he muttered.
"He heard that pesky Jay and circled around so as to get my scent.
I'll just cut across to my old trail and unless I am greatly mistaken,
I'll find his tracks there."</p>

<p>So, swiftly but silently, the hunter cut across to his old trail,
and in a few moments he found just what he expected,&mdash;one of Lightfoot's
footprints. Once more he grinned.</p>

<p>"Well, old fellow, I've out-guessed you this time," said he to
himself. "I am behind you and the wind is from you to me, so that
you cannot get my scent. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if you're
back right where you started from, behind that old windfall."
He at once began to move forward silently and cautiously, with
eyes and ears alert and his terrible gun ready for instant use.</p>

<p>Now when Lightfoot, following behind the hunter, had lost the
scent of the latter, he guessed right away that the latter had
found his tracks and had started to follow them. Lightfoot stood
still and listened with all his might for some little sound to
tell him where the hunter was. But there was no sound and after
a little Lightfoot began to move on. He didn't dare remain still,
lest the hunter should creep up within shooting distance. There
was only one direction in which it was safe for Lightfoot to move,
and that was the direction from which the Merry Little Breezes
were blowing. So long as they brought him none of the dreaded
man-smell, he knew that he was safe. The hunter might be behind
him&mdash;probably he was&mdash;but ahead of him, so long as the Merry Little
Breezes were blowing in his face and brought no man-smell, was
safety.</p>
