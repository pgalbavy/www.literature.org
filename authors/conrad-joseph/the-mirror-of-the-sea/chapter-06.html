<p> It is difficult to disconnect the idea of ships’ anchors from
the idea of the ship’s chief mate—the man who sees them go down
clear and come up sometimes foul; because not even the most unremitting
care can always prevent a ship, swinging to winds and tide, from
taking an awkward turn of the cable round stock or fluke.  Then
the business of "getting the anchor" and securing it afterwards
is unduly prolonged, and made a weariness to the chief mate. 
He is the man who watches the growth of the cable—a sailor’s phrase
which has all the force, precision, and imagery of technical language
that, created by simple men with keen eyes for the real aspect
of the things they see in their trade, achieves the just expression
seizing upon the essential, which is the ambition of the artist
in words.  Therefore the sailor will never say, "cast anchor,"
and the ship-master aft will hail his chief mate on the forecastle
in impressionistic phrase: "How does the cable grow?"  Because
"grow" is the right word for the long drift of a cable emerging
aslant under the strain, taut as a bow-string above the water. 
And it is the voice of the keeper of the ship’s anchors that will
answer: "Grows right ahead, sir," or "Broad on the bow," or whatever
concise and deferential shout will fit the case.</p>

<p>There is no order more noisily given or taken up with lustier
shouts on board a homeward-bound merchant ship than the command,
"Man the windlass!"  The rush of expectant men out of the forecastle,
the snatching of hand-spikes, the tramp of feet, the clink of
the pawls, make a stirring accompaniment to a plaintive up-anchor
song with a roaring chorus; and this burst of noisy activity from
a whole ship’s crew seems like a voiceful awakening of the ship
herself, till then, in the picturesque phrase of Dutch seamen,
"lying asleep upon her iron."</p>

<p>For a ship with her sails furled on her squared yards, and reflected
from truck to water-line in the smooth gleaming sheet of a landlocked
harbour, seems, indeed, to a seaman’s eye the most perfect picture
of slumbering repose.  The getting of your anchor was a noisy
operation on board a merchant ship of yesterday—an inspiring,
joyous noise, as if, with the emblem of hope, the ship’s company
expected to drag up out of the depths, each man all his personal
hopes into the reach of a securing hand—the hope of home, the
hope of rest, of liberty, of dissipation, of hard pleasure, following
the hard endurance of many days between sky and water.  And this
noisiness, this exultation at the moment of the ship’s departure,
make a tremendous contrast to the silent moments of her arrival
in a foreign roadstead—the silent moments when, stripped of her
sails, she forges ahead to her chosen berth, the loose canvas
fluttering softly in the gear above the heads of the men standing
still upon her decks, the master gazing intently forward from
the break of the poop. Gradually she loses her way, hardly moving,
with the three figures on her forecastle waiting attentively about
the cat-head for the last order of, perhaps, full ninety days
at sea: "Let go!"</p>

<p>This is the final word of a ship’s ended journey, the closing
word of her toil and of her achievement.  In a life whose worth
is told out in passages from port to port, the splash of the anchor’s
fall and the thunderous rumbling of the chain are like the closing
of a distinct period, of which she seems conscious with a slight
deep shudder of all her frame.  By so much is she nearer to her
appointed death, for neither years nor voyages can go on for ever. 
It is to her like the striking of a clock, and in the pause which
follows she seems to take count of the passing time.</p>

<p>This is the last important order; the others are mere routine
directions. Once more the master is heard: "Give her forty-five
fathom to the water’s edge," and then he, too, is done for a time. 
For days he leaves all the harbour work to his chief mate, the
keeper of the ship’s anchor and of the ship’s routine.  For days
his voice will not be heard raised about the decks, with that
curt, austere accent of the man in charge, till, again, when the
hatches are on, and in a silent and expectant ship, he shall speak
up from aft in commanding tones: "Man the windlass!"</p>
