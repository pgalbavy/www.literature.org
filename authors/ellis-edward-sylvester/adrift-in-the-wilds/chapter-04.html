<p>By this time our friends were a quarter of a mile in the rear
of the burning steamer. The furious pulsations of the engines
had stopped, and from stern to stern the great ship was one mass
of soothing flame. The light threw a glare upon the clouds above,
and made it so bright where our friends were floating in the water
that they could have read the pages of a printed book. The illumination
must have been seen for many and many a mile in every direction
upon the Pacific.</p>

<p>"Yes, the steamer has stopped," said Howard; "the fire has reached
the engines, and now they must do as we have done."</p>

<p>"But they have boats and may escape."</p>

<p>"Not half enough of them; and then what they have got will be
seized by the crew, as they always do at such times."</p>

<p>"Look! you can see them jumping over. The poor wretches hang
fast till they are so scorched that they have to let go."</p>

<p>"It's mighty lucky yees are here," said Tim, "for every mother's
son that can swim will be hugged by a half-dozen that can't, which
would be bad for me."</p>

<p>"Why so; can't you swim?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it."</p>

<p>"And nothing but this bench to keep us from sinking."</p>

<p>"And be the same towken isn't that good enough, if it only kaaps
us afloat? Can't ye be satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Look! how grand!"</p>

<p>It was indeed a fearful sight, the steamer being one pyramid
of roaring, blazing fire, sweeping upward in great fan-like rifts,
then blowing outward, horizontally across the deep, as if greedy
for the poor beings who had sprung in agony from its embrace.
Millions of sparks were floating and drifting overhead and falling
all around. The shrieks of the despairing passengers, as with
their clothes all aflame they sprung blindly into the ocean, could
be heard by our friends, and must indeed have extended a far greater
distance.</p>

<p>For an hour the conflagration raged with apparently unabated
violence, the wreck drifting quite rapidly; but the fire soon
tired of its work, large pieces of burning timber could be seen
floating in the water, and finally the charred hull made a plunge
downward into the sea, and our friends were left alone upon their
frail support.</p>

<p>"Now, it's time to decide what we are going to do," said Howard.</p>

<p>"You are right, and what shall it be? Shall we drift about here
until morning, when some vessel will pick us up? I have no doubt
this fire has drawn a half-dozen toward it."</p>

<p>"No; let's make for shore."</p>

<p>"That is the best plan," said Tim.</p>

<p>"But it is a good way off," remarked Howard; "and I have little
hope of reaching it."</p>

<p>"Never mind; it, will keep us busy, and that will make the time
pass faster than if we do nothing but float."</p>

<p>"We may need our strength; but it is the best plan."</p>

<p>"But do we know the direction?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you that," said Elwood; "for the moon was directly
over the shore; so all we've got to do is to aim for the moon."</p>

<p>"Begorrah! we can walk and talk, as the owld lady said when her
husband stopped on the way to the gallows to bid her good-by.
So paddle away!"</p>

<p>It being a warm summer night, the water was quite pleasant, although
our friends were sure to get enough of it long before they could
hope to place their feet upon the earth. Having now an object,
they began working with a will, the boys swimming as lustily as
possible straight for the shore, while Tim assisted materially
in pushing forward the craft.</p>

<p>The intelligent Newfoundland appeared to comprehend what was
wanted, and contributed not a little to the momentum.</p>

<p>"Do you think we are making any progress&#11834;"</p>

<p>"O, save me! save me! I'm drowning!"</p>

<p>The voice sounded close by them, and caused an involuntary start
from all three.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked Howard, in a terrified whisper.</p>

<p>"There!"</p>

<p>At that moment they caught sight of a man fiercely buffeting
the waves, as he rose on an immense swell, and then sunk down
again in the trough of the sea.</p>

<p>"Can we do anything for him?" asked Elwood. "It's too bad to
see the poor fellow sink when we may save him."</p>

<p>"I'm afeared the owld bench won't bear another hand on it."</p>

<p>But Terror had heard that cry and anticipated the wishes of his
friends. Leaving them with their raft, he struck powerfully out
toward the drowning man, and they both went down in the vast sea
chasm together. When they came in view again upon the crest of
the swell, the Newfoundland had the hair of the man's head in
his teeth and had begun his return. A moment later the gasping
man threw out his hands and caught the settee with such eagerness
that it instantly sunk.</p>

<p>"Be careful!" admonished Howard, "or you'll drown us all. One
of us can't swim!"</p>

<p>"Won't your raft bear us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you keep only your head above water and bear very lightly
upon it. Don't attempt to rise up."</p>

<p>"All right!"</p>

<p>The buoyant raft came to the surface, and was instantly grasped
firmly but carefully by all. Poor Tim O'Rooney had come very near
drowning. A man when suddenly cast into the water for the first
time has been known to swim long and well; and the Irishman, by
the most furious effort, had saved himself from strangling and
sinking, although he had swallowed a good deal of the nauseating
sea-water, and was now ejecting it.</p>

<p>"Worrah! I took an overdose that time, and it wouldn't sthay
on my stomach!" he said. "I'm thinking there'll be no necessity
of me swallowing any salts for some time to coom, be the towken
that I've enough to last me me life-time."</p>

<p>"We are all right now!" said the stranger. "I can swim, but I
was just about used up when your dog took me in tow. May I inquire
who my friends are?"</p>

<p>Howard gave their names and destination, and he instantly said:</p>

<p>"My name is Manuel Yard, and my place of business is next door
to that of your fathers."</p>

<p>"You know them then."</p>

<p>"I have known them both very well for years, and now that you
have given me your names I remember you both."</p>

<p>After a few more words, our friends recognized him as a tall,
pale-looking man, with whom they had exchanged greetings more
than once on their passage from Panama.</p>

<p>"I've been down to the Isthmus," he added, "and was on my way
home when the steamer took fire."</p>

<p>"Where were you when you heard the alarm?"</p>

<p>"Sound asleep in my berth; I had no time even to put on my clothes;
but, thank God, if I can escape in any way."</p>

<p>"Stick to us, and help shove this craft, and I'm in hopes we'll
fetch up somewhere by morning."</p>
