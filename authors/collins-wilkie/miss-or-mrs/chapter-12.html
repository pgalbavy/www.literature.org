<P>
 The scene in the drawing-room represented the ideal of domestic
comfort. The fire of wood and coal mixed burned brightly; the
lamps shed a soft glow of light; the solid shutters and the thick
red curtains kept the cold night air on the outer side of two
long windows, which opened on the back garden. Snug arm-chairs
were placed in every part of the room. In one of them Sir Joseph
reclined, fast asleep; in another, Miss Lavinia sat knitting; a
third chair, apart from the rest, near a round table in one
corner of the room, was occupied by Natalie. Her head was resting
on her hand, an unread book lay open on her lap. She looked pale
and harassed; anxiety and suspense had worn her down to the
shadow of her former self. On entering the room, Turlington
purposely closed the door with a bang. Natalie started. Miss
Lavinia looked up reproachfully. The object was achieved--Sir
Joseph was roused from his sleep.
<P>
"If you are going to the vicar's to-night. Graybrooke," said
Turlington, "it's time you were off, isn't it?"
<P>
Sir Joseph rubbed his eyes, and looked at the clock on the
mantel-piece. "Yes, yes, Richard," he answered, drowsily, "I
suppose I must go. Where is my hat?"
<P>
His sister and his daughter both joined in trying to persuade him
to send an excuse instead of groping his way to the vicarage in
the dark. Sir Joseph hesitated, as usual. He and the vicar had
run up a sudden friendship, on the strength of their common
enthusiasm for the old-fashioned game of backgammon. Victorious
over his opponent on the previous evening at Turlington's house,
Sir Joseph had promised to pass that evening at the vicarage, and
give the vicar his revenge. Observing his indecision, Turlington
cunningly irritated
 him by affecting to believe that he was really unwilling to
venture out in the dark. "I'll see you safe across the
churchyard," he said; "and the vicar's servant will see you safe
back." The tone in which he spoke instantly roused Sir Joseph. "I
am not in my second childhood yet, Richard," he replied, testily.
"I can find my way by myself." He kissed his daughter on the
forehead. "No fear, Natalie. I shall be back in time for the
mulled claret. No, Richard, I won't trouble you." He kissed his
hand to his sister and went out into the hall for his hat:
Turlington following him with a rough apology, and asking as a
favor to be permitted to accompany him part of the way only. The
ladies, left behind in the drawing-room, heard the apology
accepted by kind-hearted Sir Joseph. The two went out together.
<P>
"Have you noticed Richard since his return?" asked Miss Lavinia.
"I fancy he must have heard bad news in London. He looks as if he
had something on his mind."
<P>
"I haven't remarked it, aunt."
<P>
For the time, no more was said. Miss Lavinia went monotonously on
with her knitting. Natalie pursued her own anxious thoughts over
the unread pages of the book in her lap. Suddenly the deep
silence out of doors and in was broken by a shrill whistle,
sounding from the direction of the church-yard. Natalie started
with a faint cry of alarm. Miss Lavinia looked up from her
knitting.
<P>
"My dear child, your nerves must be sadly out of order. What is
there to be frightened at?"
<P>
"I am not very well, aunt. It is so still here at night, the
slightest noises startle me."
<P>
There was another interval of silence. It was past nine o'clock
when they heard the back door opened and closed again. Turlington
came hurriedly into the drawing-room, as if he had some reason
for wishing to rejoin the ladies as soon as possible. To the
surprise of both of them, he sat down abruptly in the corner,
with his face to the wall, and took up the newspaper, without
casting a look at them or uttering a word.
<P>
"Is Joseph safe at the vicarage?" asked Miss Lavinia.
<P>
"All right." He gave the answer in a short, surly tone, still
without looking round.
<P>
Miss Lavinia tried him again. "Did you hear a whistle while you
were out? It quite startled Natalie in the stillness of this
place."
<P>
He turned half-way round. "My shepherd, I suppose," he said after
a pause--"whistling for his dog." He turned back again and
immersed himself in his newspaper.
<P>
Miss Lavinia beckoned to her niece and pointed significantly to
Turlington. After one reluctant look at him, Natalie laid her
head wearily on her aunt's shoulder. "Sleepy, my dear?" whispered
the old lady. "Uneasy, aunt--I don't know why," Natalie whispered
back. "I would give the world to be in London, and to hear the
carriages going by, and the people talking in the street."
<P>
Turlington suddenly dropped his newspaper. "What's the secret
between you two?" he called out roughly. "What are you whispering
about?"
<P>
"We wish not to disturb you over your reading, that is all," said
Miss Lavinia, coldly. "Has anything happened to vex you,
Richard?"
<P>
"What the devil makes you think that?"
<P>
The old lady was offended, and showed it by saying nothing more.
Natalie nestled closer to her aunt. One after another the clock
ticked off the minutes with painful distinctness in the stillness
of the room. Turlington suddenly threw aside the newspaper and
left his corner. "Let's be good friends!" he burst out, with a
clumsy assumption of gayety. "This isn't keeping Christmas-eve.
Let's talk and be sociable. Dearest Natalie!" He threw his arm
roughly round Natalie, and drew her by main force away from her
aunt. She turned deadly pale, and struggled to release herself.
"I am suffering--I am ill--let me go!" He was deaf to her
entreaties. "What! your husband that is to be, treated in this
way? Mustn't I have a kiss?--I will!" He held her closer with one
hand, and, seizing her head with the other, tried to turn her
lips to him. She resisted with the inbred nervous strength which
the weakest woman living has in reserve when she is outraged.
Half indignant, half terrified, at Turlington's roughness, Miss
Lavinia rose to interfere. In a moment more he would have had two
women to overpower instead of one, when a noise outside the
window suddenly suspended the ignoble struggle.
<P>
There was a sound of footsteps on the gravel-walk which ran
between the house wall and the garden lawn. It was followed by a
tap--a single faint tap, no more--on one of the panes of glass.
<P>
They all three stood still. For a moment more nothing was
audible. Then there was a heavy shock, as of something falling
outside. Then a groan, then another interval of silence--a long
silence, interrupted no more.
<P>
Turlington's arm dropped from Natalie. She drew back to her aunt.
Looking at him instinctively, in the natural expectation that he
would take the lead in penetrating the mystery of what had
happened outside the window, the two women were thunderstruck to
see that he was, to all appearance, even more startled and more
helpless than they were. "Richard," said Miss Lavinia, pointing
to the window, "there is something wrong out there. See what it
is." He stood motionless, as if he had not heard her, his eyes
fixed on the window, his face livid with terror.
<P>
The silence outside was broken once more; this time by a call for
help.
<P>
A cry of horror burst from Natalie. The voice outside--rising
wildly, then suddenly dying away again--was not entirely strange
to _her_ ears. She tore aside the curtain. With voice and hand
she roused her aunt to help her. The two lifted the heavy bar
from its socket; they opened the shutters and the window. The
cheerful light of the room flowed out over the body of a
prostrate man, lying on his face. They turned the man over.
Natalie lifted his head.
<P>
Her father!
<P>
His face was bedabbled with blood. A wound, a frightful wound,
was visible on the side of his bare head, high above the ear. He
looked at her, his eyes recognized her, before he fainted again
in her arms. His hands and his clothes were covered with earth
stains. He must have traversed some distance; in that dreadful
condition he must have faltered and fallen more than once before
he reached the house. His sister wiped the blood from his face.
His daughter called on him frantically to forgive her before he
died--the harmless, gentle, kind-hearted father, who had never
said a hard word to her! The father whom she had deceived!
<P>
The terrified servants hurried into the room. Their appearance
roused their master from the extraordinary stupor that had seized
him. He was at the window before the footman could get there. The
two lifted Sir Joseph into the room, and laid him on the sofa.
Natalie knelt by him, supporting his head. Miss Lavinia stanched
the flowing blood with her handkerchief. The women-servants
brought linen and cold water. The man hurried away for the
doctor, who lived on the other side of the village. Left alone
again with Turlington, Natalie noticed that his eyes were fixed
in immovable scrutiny on her father's head. He never said a word.
He looked, looked, looked at the wound.
<P>
The doctor arrived. Before either the daughter or the sister of
the injured man could put the question, Turlington put it--"Will
he live or die?"
<P>
The doctor's careful finger probed the wound.
<P>
"Make your minds easy. A little lower down, or in front, the blow
might have been serious. As it is, there is no harm done. Keep
him quiet, and he will be all right again in two or three days."
<P>
Hearing those welcome words, Natalie and her aunt sank on their
knees in silent gratitude. After dressing the wound, the doctor
looked round for the master of the house. Turlington, who had
been so breathlessly eager but a few minutes since, seemed to
have lost all interest in the case now. He stood apart, at the
window, looking out toward the church-yard, thinking. The
questions which it was the doctor's duty to ask were answered by
the ladies. The servants assisted in examining the injured man's
clothes: they discovered that his watch and purse were both
missing. When it became necessary to carry him upstairs, it was
the footman who assisted the doctor. The foot man's master,
without a word of explanation, walked out bare headed into the
back garden, on the search, as the doctor and the servants
supposed, for some trace of the robber who had attempted Sir
Joseph's life.
<P>
His absence was hardly noticed at the time. The difficulty of
conveying the wounded man to his room absorbed the attention of
all the persons present.
<P>
Sir Joseph partially recovered his senses while they were taking
him up the steep and narrow stairs. Carefully as they carried the
patient, the motion wrung a groan from him before they reached
the top. The bedroom corridor, in the rambling, irregularly built
house rose and fell on different levels. At the door of the first
bedchamber the doctor asked a little anxiously if that was the
room. No; there were three more stairs to go down, and a corner
to turn, before they could reach it. The first room was
Natalie's. She instantly offered it for her father's use. The
doctor (seeing that it was the airiest as well as the nearest
room) accepted the proposal. Sir Joseph had been laid comfortably
in his daughter's bed; the doctor had just left them, with
renewed assurances that they need feel no anxiety, when they
heard a heavy step below stairs. Turlington had re-entered the
house.
<P>
(He had been looking, as they had supposed, for the ruffian who
had attacked Sir Joseph; with a motive, however, for the search
at which it was impossible for other persons to guess. His own
safety was now bound up in the safety of Thomas Wildfang. As soon
as he was out of sight in the darkness, he made straight for the
malt-house. The change of clothes was there untouched; not a
trace of his accomplice was to be seen. Where else to look for
him it was impossible to tell. Turlington had no alternative but
to go back to the house, and ascertain if suspicion had been
aroused in his absence.)
<P>
He had only to ascend the stairs, and to see, through the open
door, that Sir Joseph had been placed in his daughter's room.
<P>
"What does this mean?" he asked, roughly.
<P>
Before it was possible to answer him the footman appeared with a
message. The doctor had come back to the door to say that he
would take on himself the necessary duty of informing the
constable of what had happened, on his return to the village.
Turlington started and changed color. If Wildfang was found by
others, and questioned in his employer's absence, serious
consequences might follow. "The constable is my business," said
Turlington, hurriedly descending the stairs; "I'll go with the
doctor." They heard him open the door below, then close it again
(as if some sudden thought had struck him), and call to the
footman. The house was badly provided with servants' bedrooms.
The women-servants only slept indoors. The footman occupied a
room over the stables. Natalie and her aunt heard Turlington
dismiss the man for the night, an hour earlier than usual at
least. His next proceeding was stranger still. Looking cautiously
over the stairs, Natalie saw him lock all the doors on the
ground-floor and take out the keys. When he went away, she heard
him lock the front door behind him. Incredible as it seemed,
there could be no doubt of the fact--the inmates of the house
were imprisoned till he came back. What did it mean?
<P>
(It meant that Turlington's vengeance still remained to be
wreaked on the woman who had deceived him. It meant that Sir
Joseph's life still stood between the man who had compassed his
death and the money which the man was resolved to have. It meant
that Richard Turlington was driven to bay, and that the horror
and the peril of the night were not at an end yet.)
<P>
Natalie and her aunt looked at each other across the bed on which
Sir Joseph lay. He had fallen into a kind of doze; no
enlightenment could come to them from _him_. They could only ask
each other, with beating hearts and baffled minds, what Richard's
conduct meant--they could only feel instinctively that some
dreadful discovery was hanging over them. The aunt was the calmer
of the two--there was no secret weighing heavily on _her_
conscience. _She_ could feel the consolations of religion. "Our
dear one is spared to us, my love," said the old lady, gently.
"God has been good to us. We are in his hands. If we know that,
we know enough."
<P>
As she spoke there was a loud ring at the doorbell. The
women-servants crowded into the bedroom in alarm. Strong in
numbers, and encouraged by Natalie--who roused herself and led
the way-- they confronted the risk of opening the window and of
venturing out on the balcony which extended along that side of
the house. A man was dimly visible below. He called to them in
thick, unsteady accents. The servants recognized him: he was the
telegraphic messenger from the railway. They went down to speak
to him--and returned with a telegram which had been pushed in
under the door. The distance from the station was considerable;
the messenger had been "keeping Christmas" in more than one beer-
shop on his way to the house; and the delivery of the telegram
had been delayed for some hours. It was addressed to Natalie. She
opened it--looked at it--dropped it--and stood speechless; her
lips parted in horror, her eyes staring vacantly straight before
her.
<P>
Miss Lavinia took the telegram from the floor, and read these
lines:
<P>
"Lady Winwood, Hertford Street, London. To Natalie Graybrooke,
Church Meadows, Baxdale, Somersetshire. Dreadful news. R. T. has
discovered your marriage to Launce. The truth has been kept from
me till to-day (24th). Instant flight with your husband is your
only chance. I would have communicated with Launce, but I do not
know his address. You will receive this, I hope and believe,
before R. T. can return to Somersetshire. Telegraph back, I
entreat you, to say that you are safe. I shall follow my message
if I do not hear from you in reasonable time."
<P>
Miss Lavinia lifted her gray head, and looked at her niece. "Is
this true?" she said--and pointed to the venerable face laid
back, white, on the white pillow of the bed. Natalie sank forward
as her eyes met the eyes of her aunt. Miss Lavinia saved her from
falling insensible on the floor.
<P>
*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
<P>
The confession had been made. The words of penitence and the
words of pardon had been spoken. The peaceful face of the father
still lay hushed in rest. One by one the minutes succeeded each
other uneventfully in the deep tranquillity of the night. It was
almost a relief when the silence was disturbed once more by
another sound outside the house. A pebble was thrown up at the
window, and a voice called out cautiously, "Miss Lavinia!"
<P>
They recognized the voice of the man-servant, and at once opened
the window.
<P>
He had something to say to the ladies in private. How could he
say it? A domestic circumstance which had been marked by Launce,
as favorable to the contemplated elopement, was now noticed by
the servant as lending itself readily to effecting the necessary
communication with the ladies. The lock of the gardener's
tool-house (in the shrubbery close by) was under repair; and the
gardener's ladder was accessible to any one who wanted it. At the
short height of the balcony from the ground, the ladder was more
than long enough for the purpose required. In a few minutes the
servant had mounted to the balcony, and could speak to Natalie
and her aunt at the window.
<P>
"I can't rest quiet," said the man, "I'm off on the sly to see
what's going on down in the village. It's hard on ladies like you
to be locked in here. Is there anything I can do for either of
you?"
<P>
Natalie took up Lady Winwood's telegram. "Launce ought to see
this," she said to her aunt. "He will be here at daybreak," she
added, in a whisper, "if I don't tell him what has happened."
<P>
Miss Lavinia turned pale. "If he and Richard meet--" she began.
"Tell him!" she added, hurriedly--"tell him before it is too
late!"
<P>
Natalie wrote a few lines (addressed to Launce in his assumed
name at his lodgings in the village) inclosing Lady Winwood's
telegram, and entreating him to do nothing rash. When the servant
had disappeared with the letter, there was one hope in her mind
and in her aunt's mind, which each was ashamed to acknowledge to
the other --the hope that Launce would face the very danger that
they dreaded for him, and come to the house.
<P>
They had not been long alone again, when Sir Joseph drowsily
opened his eyes and asked what they were doing in his room. They
told him gently that he was ill. He put his hand up to his head,
and said they were right, and so dropped off again into slumber.
Worn out by the emotions through which they had passed, the two
women silently waited for the march of events. The same stupor of
resignation possessed them both. They had secured the door and
the window. They had prayed together. They had kissed the quiet
face on the pillow. They had said to each other, "We will live
with him or die with him as God pleases." Miss Lavinia sat by the
bedside. Natalie was on a stool at her feet--with her eyes
closed, and her head on her aunt's knee.
<P>
Time went on. The clock in the hall had struck--ten or eleven,
they were not sure which--when they heard the signal which warned
them of the servant's return from the village. He brought news,
and more than news; he brought a letter from Launce.
<P>
Natalie read these lines:
<P>
 "I shall be with you, dearest, almost as soon as you receive
this. The bearer will tell you what has happened in the village--
your note throws a new light on it all. I only remain behind to
go to the vicar (who is also the magistrate here), and declare
myself your husband. All disguise must be at an end now. My place
is with you and yours. It is even worse than your worst fears.
Turlington was at the bottom of the attack on your father. Judge
if you have not need of your husband's protection after
that!--L."
<P>
 Natalie handed the letter to her aunt, and pointed to the
sentence which asserted Turlington's guilty knowledge of the
attempt on Sir Joseph's life. In silent horror the two women
looked at each other, recalling what had happened earlier in the
evening, and understanding it now. The servant roused them to a
sense of present things, by entering on the narrative of his
discoveries in the village.
<P>
The place was all astir when he reached it. An old man--a
stranger in Baxdale--had been found lying in the road, close to
the church, in a fit; and the person who had discovered him had
been no other than Launce himself. He had, literally, stumbled
over the body of Thomas Wildfang in the dark, on his way back to
his lodgings in the village.
<P>
"The gentleman gave the alarm, miss," said the servant,
describing the event, as it had been related to him, "and the
man--a huge, big old man--was carried to the inn. The landlord
identified him; he had taken lodgings at the inn that day, and
the constable found valuable property on him--a purse of money
and a gold watch and chain. There was nothing to show who the
money and the watch belonged to. It was only when my master and
the doctor got to the inn that it was known whom he had robbed
and tried to murder. All he let out in his wanderings before they
came was that some person had set him on to do it. He called the
person 'Captain,' and sometimes 'Captain Goward.' It was
thought--if you could trust the ravings of a madman--that the fit
took him while he was putting his hand on Sir Joseph's heart to
feel if it had stopped beating. A sort of vision (as I understand
it) must have overpowered him at the moment. They tell me he
raved about the sea bursting into the church yard, and a drowning
sailor floating by on a hen-coop; a sailor who dragged him down
to hell by the hair of his head, and such like horrible nonsense,
miss. He was still screeching, at the worst of the fit, when my
master and the doctor came into the room. At sight of one or
other of them--it is thought of Mr. Turlington, seeing that he
came first--he held his peace on a sudden, and then fell back in
convulsions in the arms of the men who were holding him. The
doctor gave it a learned name, signifying drink-madness, and said
the case was hopeless. However, he ordered the room to be cleared
of the crowd to see what be could do. My master was reported to
be still with the doctor, waiting to see whether the man lived or
died, when I left the village, miss, with the gentleman's answer
to your note. I didn't dare stay to hear how it ended, for fear
of Mr. Turlington's finding me out."
<P>
Having reached the end of his narrative, the man looked round
restlessly toward the window. It was impossible to say when his
master might not return, and it might be as much as his life was
worth to be caught in the house after he had been locked out of
it. He begged permission to open the window, and make his escape
back to the stables while there was still time. As he unbarred
the shutter they were startled by a voice hailing them from
below. It was Launce's voice calling to Natalie. The servant
disappeared, and Natalie was in Launce's arms before she could
breathe again.
<P>
For one delicious moment she let her head lie on his breast; then
she suddenly pushed him away from her. "Why do you come here? He
will kill you if he finds you in the house. Where is he?"
<P>
Launce knew even less of Turlington's movements than the servant.
"Wherever he is, thank God, I am here before him!" That was all
the answer he could give.
<P>
Natalie and her aunt heard him in silent dismay. Sir Joseph woke,
and recognized Launce before a word more could be said. "Ah, my
dear boy!" he murmured, faintly. "It's pleasant to see you again.
How do you come here?" He was quite satisfied with the first
excuse that suggested itself. "We'll talk about it to- morrow,"
he said, and composed himself to rest again.
<P>
Natalie made a second attempt to persuade Launce to leave the
house.
<P>
"We don't know what may have happened," she said. "He may have
followed you on your way here. He may have purposely let you
enter his house. Leave us while you have the chance."
<P>
Miss Lavinia added her persuasions. They were useless. Launce
quietly closed the heavy window-shutters, lined with iron, and
put up the bar. Natalie wrung her hands in despair.
<P>
"Have you been to the magistrate?" she asked. "Tell us, at least,
are you here by his advice? Is he coming to help us?"
<P>
Launce hesitated. If he had told the truth, he must have
acknowledged that he was there in direct opposition to the
magistrate's advice. He answered evasively, "If the vicar doesn't
come, the doctor will. I have told him Sir Joseph must he moved.
Cheer up, Natalie! The doctor will be here as soon as
Turlington."
<P>
As the name passed his lips--without a sound outside to prepare
them for what was coming--the voice of Turlington himself
suddenly penetrated into the room, speaking close behind the
window, on the outer side.
<P>
"You have broken into my house in the night," said the voice.
"And you don't escape _this_ way."
<P>
Miss Lavinia sank on her knees. Natalie flew to her father. His
eyes were wide open in terror; he moaned, feebly recognizing the
voice. The next sound that was heard was the sound made by the
removal of the ladder from the balcony. Turlington, having
descended by it, had taken it away. Natalie had but too
accurately guessed what would happen. The death of the villain's
accomplice had freed him from all apprehension in that quarter.
He had deliberately dogged Launce's steps, and had deliberately
allowed him to put himself in the wrong by effecting a secret
entrance into the house.
<P>
There was an interval--a horrible interval--and then they heard
the front door opened. Without stopping (judging by the absence
of sound) to close it again, Turlington rapidly ascended the
stairs and tried the locked door.
<P>
"Come out, and give yourself up!" he called through the door. "I
have got my revolver with me, and I have a right to fire on a man
who has broken into my house. If the door isn't opened before I
count three, your blood be on your own head. One!"
<P>
Launce was armed with nothing but his stick. He advanced, without
an instant's hesitation, to give himself up. Natalie threw her
arms round him and clasped him fast before he could reach the
door.
<P>
"Two!" cried the voice outside, as Launce struggled to force her
from him. At the same moment his eye turned toward the bed. It
was exactly opposite the door--it was straight in the line of
fire! Sir Joseph' s life (as Turlington had deliberately
calculated) was actually in greater danger than Launce's life. He
tore himself free, rushed to the bed, and took the old man in his
arms to lift him out.
<P>
"Three!"
<P>
The crash of the report sounded. The bullet came through the
door, grazed Launce's left arm, and buried itself in the pillow,
at the very place on which Sir Joseph's head had rested the
moment before. Launce had saved his father-in-law's life.
Turlington had fired his first shot for the money, and had not
got it yet.
<P>
They were safe in the corner of the room, on the same side as the
door--Sir Joseph, helpless as a child, in Launce's arms; the
women pale, but admirably calm. They were safe for the moment,
when the second bullet (fired at an angle) tore its way through
the wall on their right hand.
<P>
"I hear you," cried the voice of the miscreant on the other side
of the door. "I'll have you yet--through the wall."
<P>
There was a pause. They heard his hand sounding the wall, to find
out where there was solid wood in the material of which it was
built, and where there was plaster only. At that dreadful moment
Launce's composure never left him. He laid Sir Joseph softly on
the floor, and signed to Natalie and her aunt to lie down by him
in silence. Their lives depended now on neither their voices nor
their movements telling the murderer where to fire. He chose his
place. The barrel of the revolver grated as he laid it against
the wall. He touched the hair trigger. A faint _click_ was the
only sound that followed. The third barrel had missed fire.
<P>
They heard him ask himself, with an oath, "What's wrong with it
now?"
<P>
There was a pause of silence.
<P>
Was he examining the weapon?
<P>
Before they could ask themselves the question, the report of the
exploding charge burst on their ears. It was instantly followed
by a heavy fall. They looked at the opposite wall of the room. No
sign of a bullet there or anywhere.
<P>
Launce signed to them not to move yet. They waited, and listened.
Nothing stirred on the landing outside.
<P>
Suddenly there was a disturbance of the silence in the lower
regions--a clamor of many voices at the open house door. Had the
firing of the revolver been heard at the vicarage? Yes! They
recognized the vicar's voice among the others. A moment more, and
they heard a general exclamation of horror on the stairs. Launce
opened the door of the room. He instantly closed it again before
Natalie could follow him.
<P>
The dead body of Turlington lay on the landing outside. The
charge in the fourth barrel of the revolver had exploded while he
was looking at it. The bullet had entered his mouth and killed
him on the spot.
