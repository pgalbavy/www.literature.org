<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>There was a slight, almost imperceptible jar, a faint grating
noise, a whispering sound of sand&mdash;and the boat, without a splash,
floated.</p>

<p>The earth, slipping as it were away from under the keel, left
us borne upon the waters of the bay, which were as still as the
windless night itself. The pushing off of that boat was like a
launching into space, as a bird opens its wings on the brow of
a cliff, and remains poised in the air. A sense of freedom came
to me, the unreasonable feeling of exultation&mdash;as if I had been
really a bird essaying its flight for the first time. Everything,
sudden and evil and most fortunate, had been arranged for me,
as though I had been a lay figure on which Romance had been wreaking
its bewildering unexpectedness; but with the floating clear of
the boat, I felt somehow that this escape I had to manage myself.</p>

<p>It was dark. Dipping cautiously the blade of the oar, I gave
another push against the shelving shore. Seraphina sat, cloaked
and motionless, and Tomas Castro, in the bows, made no sound.
I didn't even hear him breathe. Everything was left to me. The
boat, impelled afresh, made a slight ripple, and my elation was
replaced in a moment by all the torments of the most acute anxiety.</p>

<p>I gave another push, and then lost the bottom. Success depended
upon my resource, readiness, and courage. And what was this success?
Immediately, it meant getting out of the bay, and into the open
sea in a twelve-foot dinghy looted from some ship years ago by
the Rio Medio pirates, if that miserable population of sordid
and ragged outcasts of the Antilles deserved such a romantic name.
They were sea-thieves.</p>

<p>Already the wooded shoulder of a mountain was thrown out intensely
black by the glow in the sky behind. The moon was about to rise.
A great anguish took my heart as if in a vice. The stillness of
the dark shore struck me as unnatural. I imagined the yell of
the discovery breaking it, and the fancy caused me a greater emotion
than the thing itself, I flatter myself, could possibly have done.
The unusual silence in which, through the open portals, the altar
of the cathedral alone blazed with many flames upon the bay, seemed
to enter my very heart violently, like a sudden access of anguish.
The two in the boat with me were silent, too. I could not bear
it.</p>

<p>"Seraphina," I murmured, and heard a stifled sob.</p>

<p>"It is time to take the oars, Se√±or," whispered Castro suddenly,
as though he had fallen asleep as soon as he had scrambled into
the bows, and only had awaked that instant. "The mists in the
middle of the bay will hide us when the moon rises."</p>

<p>It was time&mdash;if we were to escape. Escape where? Into the open
sea? With that silent, sorrowing girl by my side! In this miserable
cockleshell, and without any refuge open to us? It was not really
a hesitation; she could not be left at the mercy of O'Brien. It
was as though I had for the first time perceived how vast the
world was; how dangerous; how unsafe. And there was no alternative.
There could be no going back.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if I had known what was before us, my heart would have
failed me utterly out of sheer pity. Suddenly my eyes caught sight
of the moon making like the glow of a bush fire on the black slope
of the mountain. In a moment it would flood the bay with light,
and the schooner anchored off the beach before the Casa Riego
was not eighty yards away. I dipped my oar without a splash. Castro
pulled with his one hand.</p>

<p>The mists rising on the lowlands never filled the bay, and I
could see them lying in moonlight across the outlet like a silvery
white ghost of a wall. We penetrated it, and instantly became
lost to view from the shore.</p>

<p>Castro, pulling quickly, turned his head, and grunted at a red
blur very low in the mist. A fire was burning on the low point
of land where Nichols&mdash;the Nova Scotian&mdash;had planted the battery
which had worked such havoc with Admiral Rowley's boats. It was
a mere earthwork and some of the guns had been removed. The fire,
however, warned us that there were some people on the point. We
ceased rowing for a moment, and Castro explained to me that a
fire was always lit when any of these thieves' boats were stirring.
There would be three or four men to keep it up. On this very night
Manuel-del-Popolo was outside with a good many rowboats, waiting
on the <em>Indiaman</em>. The ship had been seen nearing the shore
since noon. She was becalmed now. Perhaps they were looting her
already.</p>

<p>This fact had so far favoured our escape. There had been no strollers
on the beach that night. Since the investment of the Casa Riego,
Castro had lived amongst the besiegers on his prestige of a superior
person, of a <em>caballero</em> skilled in war and diplomacy.
No one knew how much the tubby, saturnine little man was in the
confidence of the Juez O'Brien; and there was no doubt that he
was a good Catholic. He was a very grave, a very silent <em>caballero</em>.
In reality his heart had been broken by the death of Carlos, and
he did not care what happened to him. His action was actuated
by his scorn and hate of the Rio Medio population, rather than
by any friendly feeling towards myself.</p>

<p>On that night Domingo's partisans were watching the Casa Riego,
while Manuel (who was more of a seaman) had taken most of his
personal friends, and all the larger boats that would float, to
do a bit of "outside work," as they called it, upon the becalmed
West Indiaman.</p>

<p>This had facilitated Castro's plan, and it also accounted for
the smallness of the boat, which was the only one of the refuse
lot left on the beach that did not gape at every seam. She was
not tight by any means, though. I could hear the water washing
above the bottom-boards, and I remember how concern about keeping
Seraphina's feet dry mingled with the grave apprehensions of our
enterprise.</p>

<p>We had been paddling an easy stroke. The red blurr of the fire
on the point was growing larger, while the diminished blaze of
lights on the high altar of the cathedral pierced the mist with
an orange ray.</p>

<p>"The boat should be baled out," I remarked in a whisper.</p>

<p>Castro laid his oar in and made his way to the thwart. It shows
how well we were prepared for our flight, that there was not even
a half-cocoanut shell in the boat. A gallon earthenware jar, stoppered
with a bunch of grass, contained all our provision of fresh water.
Castro displaced it, and, bending low, tried to bale with his
big, soft hat. I should imagine that he found it impracticable,
because, suddenly, he tore off one of his square-toed shoes with
a steel buckle. He used it as a scoop, blaspheming at the necessity,
but in a very low mutter, out of respect for Seraphina.</p>

<p>Standing up in the stern-sheets by her side, I kept on sculling
gently. Once before I had gone desperately to sea&mdash;escaping the
gallows, perhaps&mdash;in a very small boat, with the drunken song
of Rangsley's uncle heralding the fascination of the unknown to
a very callow youth. That night had been as dark, but the danger
had been less great. The boat, it is true, had actually sunk under
us, but then it was only the sea that might have swallowed me
who knew nothing of life, and was as much a stranger to fate as
the animals on our farm. But now the world of men stood ready
to devour us, and the Gulf of Mexico was of no more account than
a puddle on a road infested by robbers. What were the dangers
of the sea to the passions amongst which I was launched&mdash;with
my high fortunes in my hand, and, like all those who live and
love, with a sword suspended above my head?</p>

<p>The danger had been less great on that old night, when I had
heard behind me the soft crash of the smugglers' feet on the shingle.
It had been less great, and, if it had had a touch of the sordid,
it had led me to this second and more desperate escape&mdash;in a cockleshell,
carrying off a silent and cloaked figure, which quickened my heart-beats
at each look. I was carrying her off from the evil spells of the
Casa Riego, as a knight a princess from an enchanted castle. But
she was more to me than any princess to any knight.</p>

<p>There was never anything like that in the world. Lovers might
have gone, in their passion, to a certain death; but never, it
seemed to me, in the history of youth, had they gone in such an
atmosphere of cautious stillness upon such a reckless adventure.
Everything depended upon slipping out through the gullet of the
bay without a sound. The men on the point had no means of pursuit,
but, if they heard or saw anything, they could shout a warning
to the boats outside. These were the real dangers&mdash;my first concern.
Afterwards... I did not want to think of afterwards. There were
only the open sea and the perilous coast. Perhaps, if I thought
of them, I should give up.</p>

<p>I thought only of gaining each successive moment and concentrated
all my faculties into an effort of stealthiness. I handled the
boat with a deliberation full of tense prudence, as if the oar
had been a stalk of straw, as if the water of the bay had been
the film of a glass bubble an unguarded movement could have shivered
to atoms. I hardly breathed, for the feeling that a deeper breath
would have blown away the mist that was our sole protection now.</p>

<p>It was not blown away. On the contrary, it clung closer to us,
with the enveloping chill of a cloud wreathing a mountain crag.
The vague shadows and dim outlines that had hung around us began,
at last, to vanish utterly in an impenetrable and luminous whiteness.
And through the jumble of my thoughts darted the sudden knowledge
that there was a sea-fog outside&mdash;a thing quite different from
the nightly mists of the bay. It was rolling into the passage
inexplicably, for no stir of air reached us. It was possible to
watch its endless drift by the glow of the fire on the point,
now much nearer us. Its edges seemed to melt away in the flight
of the water-dust. It was a sea-fog coming in. Was it disastrous
to us, or favourable? It, at least, answered our immediate need
for concealment, and this was enough for me, when all our future
hung upon every passing minute.</p>

<p>The Rio picaroons, when engaged in thieving from some ship becalmed
on the coast, began by towing one of their schooners as far as
the entrance. They left her there as a rallying point for the
boats, and to receive the booty.</p>

<p>One of these schooners, as I knew, was moored opposite the Casa
Riego. The other might be lying at anchor somewhere right in the
fairway ahead, within a few yards. I strained my ears for some
revealing sound from her, if she were there&mdash;a cough, a voice,
the creak of a block, or the fall of something on her deck. Nothing
came. I began to fear lest I should run stem on into her side
without a moment's warning. I could see no further than the length
of our twelve-foot boat.</p>

<p>To make certain of avoiding that danger, I decided to shave close
the spit of sand that tipped the narrow strip of lowland to the
south. I set my teeth, and sheered in resolutely.</p>

<p>Castro remained on the after-thwart, with his elbows on his knees.
His head nearly touched my leg. I could distinguish the woeful,
bent back, the broken swaying of the plume in his hat. Seraphina's
perfect immobility gave me the measure of her courage, and the
silence was so profoundly pellucid that the flutter of the flames
that we were nearing began to come loud out of the blur of the
glow. Then I heard the very crackling of the wood, like a fusillade
from a great distance. Even then Castro did not deign to turn
his head.</p>

<p>Such as he was&mdash;a born vagabond, <em>contrabandista</em>, spy
in armed camps, sutler at the tail of the <em>Grande Arm√©e</em>
(escaped, God only knows how, from the snows of Russia), beggar,
<em>guerrillero</em>, bandit, sceptically murderous, draping his
rags in saturnine dignity&mdash;he had ended by becoming the sinister
and grotesque squire of our quixotic Carlos. There was something
romantically sombre in his devotion. He disdained to turn round
at the danger, because he had left his heart on the coffin as
a lesser affection would have laid a wreath. I looked down at
Seraphina. She too, had left a heart in the vaults of the cathedral.
The edge of the heavy cloak drawn over her head concealed her
face from me, and, with her face, her ignorance, her great doubts,
her great fears.</p>

<p>I heard, above the crackling of dry wood, a husky exclamation
of surprise, and then a startled voice exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Look! <em>Santissima Madre!</em> What is this?"</p>

<p>Sheer instinct altered at once the motion of my hand so as to
incline the bows of the dinghy away from the shore; but a sort
of stupefying amazement seized upon my soul. We had been seen.
It was all over. Was it possible? All over, already?</p>

<p>In my anxiety to keep clear of the schooner which, for all I
know to this day, may not have been there at all, I had come too
close to the sand, so close that I heard soft, rapid footfalls
stop short in the fog. A voice seemed to be asking me in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Where, oh, where?"</p>

<p>Another cried out irresistibly, "I see it."</p>

<p>It was a subdued cry, as if hushed in sudden awe.</p>

<p>My arm swung to and fro; the turn of my wrist went on imparting
the propelling motion of the oar. All the rest of my body was
gripped helplessly in the dead expectation of the end, as if in
the benumbing seconds of a fall from a towering height. And it
was swift, too. I felt a draught at the back of my neck&mdash;a breath
of wind. And instantly, as if a battering-ram had been let swing
past me at many layers of stretched gauze, I beheld, through a
tattered deep hole in the fog, a roaring vision of flames, borne
down and springing up again; a dance of purple gleams on the strip
of unveiled water, and three coal-black figures in the light.</p>

<p>One of them stood high on lank black legs, with long black arms
thrown up stiffly above the black shape of a hat. The two others
crouched low on the very edge of the water, peering as if from
an ambush.</p>

<p>The clearness of this vision was contained by a thick and fiery
atmosphere, into which a soft white rush and swirl of fog fell
like a sudden whirl of snow. It closed down and overwhelmed at
once the tall flutter of the flames, the black figures, the purple
gleams playing round my oar. The hot glare had struck my eyeballs
once, and had melted away again into the old, fiery stain on the
mended fabric of the fog. But the attitudes of the crouching men
left no room for doubt that we had been seen. I expected a sudden
uplifting of voices on the shore, answered by cries from the sea,
and I screamed excitedly at Castro to lay hold of his oar.</p>

<p>He did not stir, and after my shout, which must have fallen on
the scared ears with a weird and unearthly note, a profound silence
attended us&mdash;the silence of a superstitious fear. And, instead
of howls, I heard, before the boat had travelled its own short
length, a voice that seemed to be the voice of fear itself asking,
"Did you hear that?" and a trembling mutter of an invocation to
all the saints. Then a strangled throat trying to pronounce firmly,
"The souls of the dead <em>Inglez</em>. Crying from pain."</p>

<p>Admiral Rowley's seamen, so miserably thrown away in the ill-conceived
attack on the bay, were making a ghostly escort for our escape.
Those dead boats'-crews were supposed to haunt the fatal spot,
after the manner of spectres that linger in remorse, regret, or
revenge, about the gates of departure. I had blundered; the fog,
breaking apart, had betrayed us. But my obscure and vanquished
countrymen held possession of the outlet by the memory of their
courage. In this critical moment it was they, I may say, who stood
by us.</p>

<p>We, on our part, must have been disclosed, dark, indistinct,
utterly inexplicable; completely unexpected; an apparition of
stealthy shades. The painful voice in the fog said:</p>

<p>"Let them be. Answer not. They shall pass on, for none of them
died on the shore&mdash;all in the water. Yes, all in the water."</p>

<p>I suppose the man was trying to reassure himself and his companions.
His meaning, no doubt, was that, being on shore, they were safe
from the ghosts of those <em>Inglez</em> who had never achieved
a landing. From the enlarging and sudden deepening of the glow,
I knew that they were throwing more brushwood on the fire.</p>

<p>I kept on sculling, and gradually the sharp fusillade of dry
twigs grew more distant, more muffled in the fog. At last it ceased
altogether. Then a weakness came over me, and, hauling my oar
in, I sat down by Sera-phina's side. I longed for the sound of
her voice, for some tender word, for the caress of a murmur upon
my perplexed soul. I was sure of her, as of a conquered and rare
treasure, whose possession simplifies life into a sort of adoring
guardianship&mdash;and I felt so much at her mercy that an overwhelming
sense of guilt made me afraid to speak to her. The slight heave
of the open sea swung the boat up and down.</p>

<p>Suddenly Castro let out a sort of lugubrious chuckle, and, in
low tones, I began to upbraid him with his apathy. Even with his
one arm he should have obeyed my call to the oar. It was incomprehensible
to me that we had not been fired at. Castro enlightened me, in
a few moody and scornful words. The Rio Medio people, he commented
upon the incident, were fools, of bestial nature, afraid of they
knew not what.</p>

<p>"Castro, the valour of these dead countrymen of mine was not
wasted; they have stood by us like true friends," I whispered
in the excitement of our escape.</p>

<p>"These insensate English," he grumbled....</p>

<p>"A dead enemy would have served the turn better. If the <em>caballero</em>
had none other than dead friends...."</p>

<p>His harsh, bitter mumble stopped. Then Sera-phina's voice said
softly:</p>

<p>"It is you who are the friend, Tomas Castro. To you shall come
a friend's reward."</p>

<p>"Alas, Se√±orita!" he sighed. "What remains for me in this world&mdash;for
me who have given for two masses for the souls of that illustrious
man, and of your cousin Don Carlos, my last piece of silver?"</p>

<p>"We shall make you very rich, Tomas Castro," she said with decision,
as if there had been bags of gold in the boat.</p>

<p>He returned a high-flown phrase of thanks in a bitter, absent
whisper. I knew well enough that the help he had given me was
not for money, not for love&mdash;not even for loyalty to the Riegos.
It was obedience to the last recommendation of Carlos. He ran
risks for my safety, but gave me none of his allegiance.</p>

<p>He was still the same tubby, murderous little man, with a steel
blade screwed to the wooden stump of his forearm, as when, swelling
his breast, he had stepped on his toes before me like a bloodthirsty
pigeon, in the steerage of the ship that had brought us from home.
I heard him mumble, with almost incredible, sardonic contempt,
that, indeed, the senor would soon have none but dead friends
if he refrained from striking at his enemies. Had the senor taken
the very excellent opportunity afforded by Providence, and that
any sane Christian man would have taken&mdash;to let him stab the Juez
O'Brien&mdash;we should not then be wandering in a little boat. What
folly! What folly! One little thrust of a knife, and we should
all have been now safe in our beds....</p>

<p>His tone was one of weary superiority, and I remained appalled
by that truth, stripped of all chivalrous pretence. It was clear,
in sparing that defenceless life, I had been guilty of cruelty
for the sake of my conscience. There was Seraphina by my side;
it was she who had to suffer. I had let her enemy go free, because
he had happened to be near me, disarmed. Had I acted like an Englishman
and a gentleman, or only like a fool satisfying his sentiment
at other people's expense? Innocent people, too, like the Riego
servants, Castro himself; like Seraphina, on whom my high-minded
forbearance had brought all these dangers, these hardships, and
this uncertain fate.</p>

<p>She gave no sign of having heard Castro's words. The silence
of women is very impenetrable, and it was as if my hold upon the
world&mdash;since she was the whole world for me&mdash;had been weakened
by that shade of decency of feeling which makes a distinction
between killing and murder. But suddenly I felt, without her cloaked
figure having stirred, her small hand slip into mine. Its soft
warmth seemed to go straight to my heart soothing, invigorating&mdash;as
it she had slipped into my palm a weapon of extraordinary and
inspiring potency.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are generous," I whispered close to the edge of the
cloak overshadowing her face.</p>

<p>"You must now think of yourself, Juan," she said.</p>

<p>"Of myself," I echoed sadly. "I have only you to think of, and
you are so far away&mdash;out of my reach. There are your dead&mdash;all
your loss, between you and me."</p>

<p>She touched my arm.</p>

<p>"It is I who must think of my dead," she whispered. "But you,
you must think of yourself, because I have nothing of mine in
this world now."</p>

<p>Her words affected me like the whisper of remorse. It was true.
There were her wealth, her lands, her palaces; but her only refuge
was that little boat. Her father's long aloofness from life had
created such an isolation round his closing years that his daughter
had no one but me to turn to for protection against the plots
of her own Intendente. And, at the thought of our desperate plight,
of the suffering awaiting us in that small boat, with the possibility
of a lingering death for an end, I wavered for a moment. Was it
not my duty to return to the bay and give myself up? In that case,
as Castro expressed it, our throats would be cut for love of the
<em>Juez</em>.</p>

<p>But Seraphina, the rabble would carry to the Casa on the palms
of their hands&mdash;out of veneration for the family, and for fear
of O'Brien.</p>

<p>"So, Se√±or," he mumbled, "if to you to-morrow's sun is as little
as to me let us pull the boat's head, round."</p>

<p>"Let us set our hands to the side and overturn it, rather," Seraphina
said, with an indignation of high command.</p>

<p>I said no more. If I could have taken O'Brien with me into the
other world, I would have died to save her the pain of so much
as a pinprick. But because I could not, she must even go with
me; must suffer because I clung to her as men cling to their hope
of highest good&mdash;with an exalted and selfish devotion.</p>

<p>Castro had moved forward, as if to show his readiness to pull
round. Meantime I heard a click. A feeble gleam fell on his misty
hands under the black halo of the hat rim. Again the flint and
blade clicked, and a large red spark winked rapidly in the bows.
He had lighted a cigarette.</p>
