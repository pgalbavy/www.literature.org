<p>A single cover having been laid at the end of a long table in
the salle for the lieutenant, he had his meal there while the
others sat down to theirs in the kitchen, the usual strangely
assorted company served by the anxious and silent Catherine. Peyrol,
thoughtful and hungry, faced Citizen Scevola in his working clothes
and very much withdrawn within himself. Scevola’s aspect was more
feverish than usual, with the red patches on his cheek-bones very
marked above the thick beard. From time to time the mistress of
the farm would get up from her place by the side of old Peyrol
and go out into the salle to attend to the lieutenant. The other
three people seemed unconscious of her absences. Towards the end
of the meal Peyrol leaned back in his wooden chair and let his
gaze rest on the ex-terrorist who had not finished yet, and was
still busy over his plate with the air of a man who had done a
long morning’s work. The door leading from the kitchen to the
salle stood wide open, but no sound of voices ever came from there.</p>

<p>Till lately Peyrol had not concerned himself very much with the
mental states of the people with whom he lived. Now, however,
he wondered to himself what could be the thoughts of the ex-terrorist
patriot, that sanguinary and extremely poor creature occupying
the position of master of the Escampobar Farm. But when Citizen
Scevola raised his head at last to take a long drink of wine there
was nothing new on that face which in its high colour resembled
so much a painted mask. Their eyes met.</p>

<p>"Sacrebleu!" exclaimed Peyrol at last. "If you never say anything
to anybody like this you will forget how to speak at last."</p>

<p>The patriot smiled from the depths of his beard, a smile which
Peyrol for some reason, mere prejudice perhaps, always thought
resembled the defensive grin of some small wild animal afraid
of being cornered.</p>

<p>"What is there to talk about?" he retorted. "You live with us;
you haven’t budged from here; I suppose you have counted the bunches
of grapes in the enclosure and the figs on the fig-tree on the
west wall many times over...." He paused to lend an ear to the
dead silence in the salle, and then said with a slight rise of
tone, "You and I know everything that is going on here."</p>

<p>Peyrol wrinkled the corners of his eyes in a keen, searching
glance. Catherine clearing the table bore herself as if she had
been completely deaf. Her face, of a walnut colour, with sunken
cheeks and lips, might have been a carving in the marvellous immobility
of its fine wrinkles. Her carriage was upright and her hands swift
in their movements. Peyrol said: "We don’t want to talk about
the farm. Haven’t you heard any news lately?"</p>

<p>The patriot shook his head violently. Of public news he had a
horror. Everything was lost. The country was ruled by perjurers
and renegades. All the patriotic virtues were dead. He struck
the table with his fist and then remained listening as though
the blow could have roused an echo in the silent house. Not the
faintest sound came from anywhere. Citizen Scevola sighed. It
seemed to him that he was the only patriot left, and even in his
retirement his life was not safe.</p>

<p>"I know," said Peyrol. "I saw the whole affair out of the window.
You can run like a hare, citizen."</p>

<p>"Was I to allow myself to be sacrificed by those superstitious
brutes?" argued Citizen Scevola in a high-pitched voice and with
genuine indignation, which Peyrol watched coldly. He could hardly
catch the mutter of "Perhaps it would have been just as well if
I had let those reactionary dogs kill me that time."</p>

<p>The old woman washing up at the sink glanced uneasily towards
the door of the salle.</p>

<p>"No!" shouted the lonely sans-culotte. "It isn’t possible! There
must be plenty of patriots left in France. The sacred fire is
not burnt out yet."</p>

<p>For a short time he presented the appearance of a man who is
sitting with ashes on his head and desolation in his heart. His
almond-shaped eyes looked dull, extinguished. But after a moment
he gave a sidelong look at Peyrol as if to watch the effect and
began declaiming in a low voice and apparently as if rehearsing
a speech to himself: "No, it isn’t possible. Some day tyranny
will stumble and then it will be time to pull it down again. We
will come out in our thousands and&mdash;ça ira!"</p>

<p>Those words, and even the passionate energy of the tone, left
Peyrol unmoved. With his head sustained by his thick brown hand
he was thinking of something else so obviously as to depress again
the feebly struggling spirit of terrorism in the lonely breast
of Citizen Scevola. The glow of reflected sunlight in the kitchen
became darkened by the body of the fisherman of the lagoon, mumbling
a shy greeting to the company from the frame of the doorway. Without
altering his position Peyrol turned his eyes on him curiously.
Catherine, wiping her hands on her apron, remarked: "You come
late for your dinner, Michel." He stepped in then, took from the
old woman’s hand an earthenware pot and a large hunk of bread
and carried it out at once into the yard. Peyrol and the sans-culotte
got up from the table. The latter, after hesitating like somebody
who has lost his way, went brusquely into the passage, while Peyrol,
avoiding Catherine’s anxious stare, made for the backyard. Through
the open door of the salle he obtained a glimpse of Arlette sitting
upright with her hands in her lap gazing at somebody he could
not see, but who could be no other than Lieutenant Réal.</p>

<p>In the blaze and heat of the yard the chickens, broken up into
small groups, were having their siesta in patches of shade. But
Peyrol cared nothing for the sun. Michel, who was eating his dinner
under the pent roof of the cart shed, put the earthenware pot
down on the ground and joined his master at the well encircled
by a low wall of stones and topped by an arch of wrought iron
on which a wild fig-tree had twined a slender offshoot. After
his dog’s death the fisherman had abandoned the salt lagoon, leaving
his rotting punt exposed on the dismal shore and his miserable
nets shut up in the dark hut. He did not care for another dog,
and besides, who was there to give him a dog? He was the last
of men. Somebody must be last. There was no place for him in the
life of the village. So one fine morning he had walked up to the
farm in order to see Peyrol. More correctly perhaps, to let himself
be seen by Peyrol. That was exactly Michel’s only hope. He sat
down on a stone outside the gate with a small bundle, consisting
mainly of an old blanket, and a crooked stick lying on the ground
near him, and looking the most lonely, mild and harmless creature
on this earth. Peyrol had listened gravely to his confused tale
of the dog’s death. He, personally, would not have made a friend
of a dog like Michel’s dog, but he understood perfectly the sudden
breaking up of the establishment on the shore of the lagoon. So
when Michel had concluded with the words, "I thought I would come
up here," Peyrol, without waiting for a plain request, had said:
"Très bien. You will be my crew," and had pointed down the path
leading to the sea-shore. And as Michel, picking up his bundle
and stick, started off, waiting for no further directions, he
had shouted after him: "You will find a loaf of bread and a bottle
of wine in a locker aft, to break your fast on."</p>

<p>These had been the only formalities of Michel’s engagement to
serve as "crew" on board Peyrol’s boat. The rover, indeed, had
tried without loss of time to carry out his purpose of getting
something of his own that would float. It was not so easy to find
anything worthy. The miserable population of Madrague, a tiny
fishing hamlet facing towards Toulon, had nothing to sell. Moreover,
Peyrol looked with contempt on all their possessions. He would
have as soon bought a catamaran of three logs of wood tied together
with rattans as one of their boats; but lonely and prominent on
the beach, lying on her side in weather-beaten melancholy, there
was a two-masted tartane with her sun-whitened cordage hanging
in festoons and her dry masts showing long cracks. No man was
ever seen dozing under the shade of her hull, on which the Mediterranean
gulls made themselves very much at home. She looked a wreck thrown
high up on the land by a disdainful sea. Peyrol, having surveyed
her from a distance, saw that the rudder still hung in its place.
He ran his eye along her body and said to himself that a craft
with such lines would sail well. She was much bigger than anything
he had thought of, but in her size, too, there was a fascination.
It seemed to bring all the shores of the Mediterranean within
his reach, Baleares and Corsica, Barbary and Spain. Peyrol had
sailed over hundreds of leagues of ocean in craft that were no
bigger. At his back, in silent wonder, a knot of fishermen’s wives,
bareheaded and lean, with a swarm of ragged children clinging
to their skirts, watched the first stranger they had seen for
years.</p>

<p>Peyrol borrowed a short ladder in the hamlet (he knew better
than to trust his weight to any of the ropes hanging over the
side) and carried it down to the beach, followed at a respectful
distance by the staring women and children: a phenomenon and a
wonder to the natives, as it had happened to him before on more
than one island in distant seas. He clambered on board the neglected
tartane and stood on the decked fore-part, the centre of all eyes.
A gull flew away with an angry scream. The bottom of the open
hold contained nothing but a little sand, a few broken pieces
of wood, a rusty hook, and some few stalks of straw which the
wind must have carried for miles before they found their rest
in there. The decked after-part had a small skylight and a companion,
and Peyrol’s eyes rested fascinated on an enormous padlock which
secured its sliding door. It was as if there had been secrets
or treasures inside&mdash;and yet most probably it was empty. Peyrol
turned his head away and with the whole strength of his lungs
shouted in the direction of the fishermen’s wives, who had been
joined by two very old men and a hunchbacked cripple swinging
between two crutches.</p>

<p>"Is there anybody looking after this tartane, a caretaker?"</p>

<p>At first the only answer was a movement of recoil. Only the hunchback
held his ground and shouted back in an unexpectedly strong voice.</p>

<p>"You are the first man that has been on board her for years."</p>

<p>The wives of the fishermen admired his boldness, for Peyrol indeed
appeared to them a very formidable being.</p>

<p>"I might have guessed that," thought Peyrol. "She is in a dreadful
mess." The disturbed gull had brought some friends as indignant
as itself and they circled at different levels uttering wild cries
over Peyrol’s head. He shouted again:</p>

<p>"Who does she belong to?"</p>

<p>The being on crutches lifted a finger towards the circling birds
and answered in a deep tone:</p>

<p>"They are the only ones I know." Then, as Peyrol gazed down at
him over the side, he went on: "This craft used to belong to Escampobar.
You know Escampobar? It’s a house in the hollow between the hills
there."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know Escampobar," yelled Peyrol, turning away and leaning
against the mast in a pose which he did not change for a long
time. His immobility tired out the crowd. They moved slowly in
a body towards their hovels, the hunchback bringing up the rear
with long swings between his crutches, and Peyrol remained alone
with the angry gulls. He lingered on board the tragic craft which
had taken Arlette’s parents to their death in the vengeful massacre
of Toulon and had brought the youthful Arlette and Citizen Scevola
back to Escampobar, where old Catherine, left alone at that time,
had waited for days for somebody’s return. Days of anguish and
prayer, while she listened to the booming of guns about Toulon
and with an almost greater but different terror to the dead silence
which ensued.</p>

<p>Peyrol, enjoying the sensation of some sort of craft under his
feet, indulged in no images of horror connected with that desolate
tartane. It was late in the evening before he returned to the
farm, so that he had to have his supper alone. The women had retired,
only the sans-culotte, smoking a short pipe out of doors, had
followed him into the kitchen and asked where he had been and
whether he had lost his way. This question gave Peyrol an opening.
He had been to Madrague and had seen a very fine tartane lying
perishing on the beach.</p>

<p>"They told me down there that she belonged to you, citoyen."</p>

<p>At this the terrorist only blinked.</p>

<p>"What’s the matter? Isn’t she the craft you came here in? Won’t
you sell her to me?" Peyrol waited a little. "What objection can
you have?"</p>

<p>It appeared that the patriot had no positive objections. He mumbled
something about the tartane being very dirty. This caused Peyrol
to look at him with intense astonishment.</p>

<p>"I am ready to take her off your hands as she stands."</p>

<p>"I will be frank with you, citoyen. You see, when she lay at
the quay in Toulon a lot of fugitive traitors, men and women,
and children too, swarmed on board of her, and cut the ropes with
a view of escaping, but the avengers were not far behind and made
short work of them. When we discovered her behind the Arsenal
I and another man, we had to throw a lot of bodies overboard,
out of the hold and the cabin. You will find her very dirty all
over. We had no time to clear up." Peyrol felt inclined to laugh.
He had seen decks swimming in blood and had himself helped to
throw dead bodies overboard after a fight; but he eyed the citizen
with an unfriendly eye. He thought to himself: "He had a hand
in that massacre, no doubt," but he made no audible remark. He
only thought of the enormous padlock securing that emptied charnel-house
at the stern. The terrorist insisted. "We really had not a moment
to clean her up. The circumstances were such that it was necessary
for me to get away quickly lest some of the false patriots should
do me some carmagnole or other. There had been bitter quarrelling
in my section. I was not alone in getting away, you know."</p>

<p>Peyrol waved his arm to cut short the explanation. But before
he and the terrorist had parted for the night Peyrol could regard
himself as the owner of the tragic tartane.</p>

<p>Next day he returned to the hamlet and took up his quarters there
for a time. The awe he had inspired wore off, though no one cared
to come very near the tartane. Peyrol did not want any help. He
wrenched off the enormous padlock himself with a bar of iron and
let the light of day into the little cabin which did indeed bear
the traces of the massacre in the stains of blood on its woodwork,
but contained nothing else except a wisp of long hair and a woman’s
ear-ring, a cheap thing which Peyrol picked up and looked at for
a long time. The associations of such finds were not foreign to
his past. He could without very strong emotion figure to himself
the little place choked with corpses. He sat down and looked about
at the stains and splashes which had been untouched by sunlight
for years. The cheap little ear-ring lay before him on the rough-hewn
table between the lockers, and he shook his head at it weightily.
He, at any rate, had never been a butcher.</p>

<p>Peyrol, unassisted, did all the cleaning. Then he turned con
amore to the fitting out of the tartane. The habits of activity
still clung to him. He welcomed something to do; this congenial
task had all the air of preparation for a voyage, which was a
pleasing dream, and it brought every evening the satisfaction
of something achieved to that illusory end. He rove new gear,
scraped the masts himself, did all the sweeping, scrubbing and
painting single-handed, working steadily and hopefully as though
he had been preparing his escape from a desert island; and directly
he had cleaned and renovated the dark little hole of a cabin he
took to sleeping on board. Once only he went up on a visit to
the farm for a couple of days, as if to give himself a holiday.
He passed them mostly in observing Arlette. She was perhaps the
first problematic human being he had ever been in contact with.
Peyrol had no contempt for women. He had seen them love, suffer,
endure, riot, and even fight for their own hand, very much like
men. Generally with men and women you had to be on your guard,
but in some ways women were more to be trusted. As a matter of
fact, his country-women were to him less known than any other
kind. From his experience of many different races, however, he
had a vague idea that women were very much alike everywhere. This
one was a lovable creature. She produced on him the effect of
a child, aroused a kind of intimate emotion which he had not known
before to exist by itself in a man. He was startled by its detached
character. "Is it that I am getting old?" he asked himself suddenly
one evening, as he sat on the bench against the wall looking straight
before him, after she had crossed his line of sight.</p>

<p>He felt himself an object of observation to Catherine, whom he
used to detect peeping at him round the corners or through half-opened
doors. On his part he would stare at her openly, aware of the
impression he produced on her: mingled curiosity and awe. He had
the idea she did not disapprove of his presence at the farm, where,
it was plain to him, she had a far from easy life. This had no
relation to the fact that she did all the household work. She
was a woman of about his own age, straight as a dart but with
a wrinkled face. One evening as they were sitting alone in the
kitchen Peyrol said to her: "You must have been a handsome girl
in your day, Catherine. It’s strange you never got married."</p>

<p>She turned to him under the high mantel of the fireplace and
seemed struck all of a heap, unbelieving, amazed, so that Peyrol
was quite provoked. "What’s the matter? If the old moke in the
yard had spoken you could not look more surprised. You can’t deny
that you were a handsome girl."</p>

<p>She recovered from her scare to say: "I was born here, grew up
here, and early in my life I made up my mind to die here."</p>

<p>"A strange notion," said Peyrol, "for a young girl to take into
her head."</p>

<p>"It’s not a thing to talk about," said the old woman, stooping
to get a pot out of the warm ashes. "I did not think, then," she
went on, with her back to Peyrol, "that I would live long. When
I was eighteen I fell in love with a priest."</p>

<p>"Ah, bah!" exclaimed Peyrol under his breath.</p>

<p>"That was the time when I prayed for death," she pursued in a
quiet voice. "I spent nights on my knees upstairs in that room
where you sleep now. I shunned everybody. People began to say
I was crazy. We have always been hated by the rabble about here.
They have poisonous tongues. I got the nickname of ‘la fiancée
du prêtre.’ Yes, I was handsome, but who would have looked at
me if I had wanted to be looked at? My only luck was to have a
fine man for a brother. He understood. No word passed his lips,
but sometimes when we were alone, and not even his wife was by,
he would lay his hand on my shoulder gently. From that time to
this I have not been to church, and I never will go. But I have
no quarrel with God now."</p>

<p>There were no signs of watchfulness and care in her bearing now.
She stood straight as an arrow before Peyrol and looked at him
with a confident air. The rover was not yet ready to speak. He
only nodded twice, and Catherine turned away to put the pot to
cool in the sink. "Yes, I wished to die. But I did not, and now
I have got something to do," she said, sitting down near the fireplace
and taking her chin in her hand. "And I dare say you know what
that is," she added.</p>

<p>Peyrol got up deliberately.</p>

<p>"Well! bonsoir," he said. "I am off to Madrague. I want to begin
work again on the tartane at daylight."</p>

<p>"Don’t talk to me about the tartane! She took my brother away
for ever. I stood on the shore watching her sails growing smaller
and smaller. Then I came up alone to this farmhouse."</p>

<p>Moving calmly her faded lips which no lover or child had ever
kissed, old Catherine told Peyrol of the days and nights of waiting,
with the distant growl of the big guns in her ears. She used to
sit outside on the bench longing for news, watching the flickers
in the sky and listening to heavy bursts of gunfire coming over
the water. Then came a night as if the world were coming to an
end. All the sky was lighted up, the earth shook to its foundations,
and she felt the house rock, so that jumping up from the bench
she screamed with fear. That night she never went to bed. Next
morning she saw the sea covered with sails, while a black and
yellow cloud of smoke hung over Toulon. A man coming up from Madrague
told her that he believed that the whole town had been blown up.
She gave him a bottle of wine and he helped her to feed the stock
that evening. Before going home he expressed the opinion that
there could not be a soul left alive in Toulon, because the few
that survived would have gone away in the English ships. Nearly
a week later she was dozing by the fire when voices outside woke
her up, and she beheld standing in the middle of the salle, pale
like a corpse out of a grave, with a blood-soaked blanket over
her shoulders and a red cap on her head, a ghastly-looking young
girl in whom she suddenly recognized her niece. She screamed in
her terror: "François, François!" This was her brother’s name,
and she thought he was outside. Her scream scared the girl, who
ran out of the door. All was still outside. Once more she screamed
"François!" and, tottering as far as the door, she saw her niece
clinging to a strange man in a red cap and with a sabre by his
side, who yelled excitedly: "You won’t see François again. Vive
la République!"</p>

<p>"I recognized the son Bron," went on Catherine. "I knew his parents.
When the troubles began he left his home to follow the Revolution.
I walked straight up to him and took the girl away from his side.
She didn’t want much coaxing. The child always loved me," she
continued, getting up from the stool and moving a little closer
to Peyrol. "She remembered her Aunt Catherine. I tore the horrid
blanket off her shoulders. Her hair was clotted with blood and
her clothes all stained with it. I took her upstairs. She was
as helpless as a little child. I undressed her and examined her
all over. She had no hurt anywhere. I was sure of that&mdash;but of
what more could I be sure? I couldn’t make sense of the things
she babbled at me. Her very voice distracted me. She fell asleep
directly I had put her into my bed, and I stood there looking
down at her, nearly going out of my mind with the thought of what
that child may have been dragged through. When I went downstairs
I found that good-for-nothing inside the house. He was ranting
up and down the salle, vapouring and boasting till I thought all
this must be an awful dream. My head was in a whirl. He laid claim
to her, and God knows what. I seemed to understand things that
made my hair stir on my head. I stood there clasping my hands
with all the strength I had, for fear I should go out of my senses."</p>

<p>"He frightened you," said Peyrol, looking at her steadily. Catherine
moved a step nearer to him.</p>

<p>"What? The son Bron, frighten me! He was the butt of all the
girls, mooning about amongst the people outside the church on
feast days in the time of the King. All the countryside knew about
him. No. What I said to myself was that I musn’t let him kill
me. There upstairs was the child I had just got away from him,
and there was I, all alone with that man with the sabre and unable
to get hold of a kitchen knife even."</p>

<p>"And so he remained," said Peyrol.</p>

<p>"What would you have had me to do?" asked Catherine steadily.
"He had brought the child back out of those shambles. It was a
long time before I got an idea of what had happened. I don’t know
everything even yet, and I suppose I will never know. In a very
few days my mind was more at ease about Arlette, but it was a
long time before she would speak and then it was never anything
to the purpose. And what could I have done single-handed? There
was nobody I would condescend to call to my help. We of the Escampobar
have never been in favour with the peasants here," she said proudly.
"And that is all I can tell you."</p>

<p>Her voice faltered, she sat down on the stool again and took
her chin in the palm of her hand. As Peyrol left the house to
go to the hamlet he saw Arlette and the patron come round the
corner of the yard wall walking side by side but as if unconscious
of each other.</p>

<p>That night he slept on board the renovated tartane and the rising
sun found him at work about the hull. By that time he had ceased
to be the object of awed contemplation to the inhabitants of the
hamlet, who still, however, kept up a mistrustful attitude. His
only intermediary for communicating with them was the miserable
cripple. He was Peyrol’s only company, in fact, during his period
of work on the tartane. He had more activity, audacity, and intelligence,
it seemed to Peyrol, than all the rest of the inhabitants put
together. Early in the morning he could be seen making his way
on his crutches with a pendulum motion towards the hull on which
Peyrol would have been already an hour or so at work. Peyrol then
would throw him over a sound rope’s end and the cripple, leaning
his crutches against the side of the tartane, would pull his wretched
little carcass, all withered below the waist, up the rope, hand
over hand, with extreme ease. There, sitting on the small foredeck
with his back against the mast and his thin, twisted legs folded
in front of him, he would keep Peyrol company, talking to him
along the whole length of the tartane in a strained voice and
sharing his midday meal, as of right, since it was he generally
who brought the provisions slung round his neck in a quaint flat
basket. Thus were the hours of labour shortened for Peyrol by
shrewd remarks and bits of local gossip. How the cripple got hold
of it it was difficult to imagine, and the rover had not enough
knowledge of European superstitions to suspect him of flying through
the night on a broomstick like a sort of male witch&mdash;for there
was a manliness in that twisted scrap of humanity which struck
Peyrol from the first. His very voice was manly and the character
of his gossip was not feminine. He did indeed mention to Peyrol
that people used to take him about the neighbourhood in carts
for the purpose of playing a fiddle at weddings and other festive
occasions; but this seemed hardly adequate, and even he himself
confessed that there was not much of that sort of thing going
on during the Revolution, when people didn’t like to attract attention
and everything was done in a hole-and-corner manner. There were
no priests to officiate at weddings, and if there were no ceremonies
how could there be rejoicings. Of course children were born as
before, but there were no christenings&mdash;and people got to look
funny somehow or other. Their countenances got changed somehow;
the very boys and girls seemed to have something on their minds.</p>

<p>Peyrol, busy about one thing and another, listened without appearing
to pay much attention to the story of the Revolution, as if to
the tale of an intelligent islander on the other side of the world
talking of bloody rites and amazing hopes of some religion unknown
to the rest of mankind. But there was something biting in the
speech of that cripple which confused his thoughts a little. Sarcasm
was a mystery which he could not understand. On one occasion he
remarked to his friend the cripple as they sat together on the
foredeck munching the bread and figs of their midday meal:</p>

<p>"There must have been something in it. But it doesn’t seem to
have done much for you people here."</p>

<p>"To be sure," retorted the scrap of man vivaciously, "it hasn’t
straightened my back or given me a pair of legs like yours."</p>

<p>Peyrol, whose trousers were rolled up above the knee because
he had been washing the hold, looked at his calves complacently.
"You could hardly have expected that," he remarked with simplicity.</p>

<p>"Ah, but you don’t know what people with properly made bodies
expected or pretended to," said the cripple. "Everything was going
to be changed. Everybody was going to tie up his dog with a string
of sausages for the sake of principles." His long face, which,
in repose, had an expression of suffering peculiar to cripples,
was lighted up by an enormous grin. "They must feel jolly well
sold by this time," he added. "And of course that vexes them,
but I am not vexed. I was never vexed with my father and mother.
While the poor things were alive I never went hungry&mdash;not very
hungry. They couldn’t have been very proud of me." He paused and
seemed to contemplate himself mentally. "I don’t know what I would
have done in their place. Something very different. But then,
don’t you see, I know what it means to be like I am. Of course
they couldn’t know, and I don’t suppose the poor people had very
much sense. A priest from Almanarre &mdash;Almanarre is a sort
of village up there where there is a church...."</p>

<p>Peyrol interrupted him by remarking that he knew all about Almanarre.
This, on his part, was a simple delusion because in reality he
knew much less of Almanarre than of Zanzibar or any pirate village
from there up to Cape Guardafui. And the cripple contemplated
him with his brown eyes, which had an upward cast naturally.</p>

<p>"You know ...! For me," he went on, in a tone of quiet decision,
"you are a man fallen from the sky. Well, a priest from Almanarre
came to bury them. A fine man with a stern face. The finest man
I have seen from that time till you dropped on us here. There
was a story of a girl having fallen in love with him some years
before. I was old enough then to have heard something of it, but
that’s neither here nor there. Moreover, many people wouldn’t
believe the tale."</p>

<p>Peyrol, without looking at the cripple, tried to imagine what
sort of child he might have been&mdash;what sort of youth? The rover
had seen staggering deformities, dreadful mutilations which were
the cruel work of man: but it was amongst people with dusky skins.
And that made a great difference. But what he had heard and seen
since he had come back to his native land, the tales, the facts,
and also the faces, reached his sensibility with a particular
force, because of that feeling that came to him so suddenly after
a whole lifetime spent amongst Indians, Malagashes, Arabs, blackamoors
of all sorts, that he belonged there, to this land, and had escaped
all those things by a mere hair’s breadth. His companion completed
his significant silence, which seemed to have been occupied with
thoughts very much like his own, by saying:</p>

<p>"All this was in the King’s time. They didn’t cut off his head
till several years afterwards. It didn’t make my life any easier
for me, but since those Republicans had deposed God and flung
Him out of all the churches I have forgiven Him all my troubles."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a man," said Peyrol. Only the misshapen character
of the cripple’s back prevented Peyrol from giving him a hearty
slap. He got up to begin his afternoon’s work. It was a bit of
inside painting, and from the foredeck the cripple watched him
at it with dreamy eyes and something ironic on his lips.</p>

<p>It was not till the sun had travelled over Cape Cicié, which
could be seen across the water like dark mist in the glare, that
he opened his lips to ask: "And what do you propose to do with
this tartane, citoyen?"</p>

<p>Peyrol answered simply that the tartane was fit to go anywhere
now, the very moment she took the water.</p>

<p>"You could go as far as Genoa and Naples and even further," suggested
the cripple.</p>

<p>"Much further," said Peyrol.</p>

<p>"And you have been fitting her out like this for a voyage?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Peyrol, using his brush steadily.</p>

<p>"Somehow I fancy it will not be a long one."</p>

<p>Peyrol never checked the to-and-fro movement of his brush, but
it was with an effort. The fact was that he had discovered in
himself a distinct reluctance to go away from the Escampobar Farm.
His desire to have something of his own that could float was no
longer associated with any desire to wander. The cripple was right.
The voyage of the renovated tartane would not take her very far.
What was surprising was the fellow being so very positive about
it. He seemed able to read people’s thoughts.</p>

<p>The dragging of the renovated tartane into the water was a great
affair. Everybody in the hamlet, including the women, did a full
day’s work and there was never so much coin passed from hand to
hand in the hamlet in all the days of its obscure history. Swinging
between his crutches on a low sand-ridge the cripple surveyed
the whole of the beach. It was he that had persuaded the villagers
to lend a hand and had arranged the terms for their assistance.
It was he also who, through a very miserable-looking pedlar (the
only one who frequented the peninsula), had got in touch with
some rich persons in Fréjus who had changed for Peyrol a few of
his gold pieces for current money. He had expedited the course
of the most exciting and interesting experience of his life, and
now planted on the sand on his two sticks in the manner of a beacon
he watched the last operation. The rover, as if about to launch
himself upon a track of a thousand miles, walked up to shake hands
with him and look once more at the soft eyes and the ironic smile.</p>

<p>"There is no denying it&mdash;you are a man."</p>

<p>"Don’t talk like this to me, citoyen," said the cripple in a
trembling voice. Till then, suspended between his two sticks and
with his shoulders as high as his ears, he had not looked towards
the approaching Peyrol. "This is too much of a compliment!"</p>

<p>"I tell you," insisted the rover roughly, and as if the insignificance
of mortal envelopes had presented itself to him for the first
time at the end of his roving life, "I tell you that there is
that in you which would make a chum one would like to have alongside
one in a tight place."</p>

<p>As he went away from the cripple towards the tartane, while the
whole population of the hamlet disposed around her waited for
his word, some on land and some waist-deep in the water holding
ropes in their hands, Peyrol had a slight shudder at the thought:
"Suppose I had been born like that." Ever since he had put his
foot on his native land such thoughts had haunted him. They would
have been impossible anywhere else. He could not have been like
any blackamoor, good, bad or indifferent, hale or crippled, king
or slave; but here, on this Southern shore that had called to
him irresistibly as he had approached the Straits of Gibraltar
on what he had felt to be his last voyage, any woman, lean and
old enough, might have been his mother; he might have been any
Frenchman of them all, even one of those he pitied, even one of
those he despised. He felt the grip of his origins from the crown
of his head to the soles of his feet while he clambered on board
the tartane as if for a long and distant voyage. As a matter of
fact he knew very well that with a bit of luck it would be over
in about an hour. When the tartane took the water the feeling
of being afloat plucked at his very heart. Some Madrague fishermen
had been persuaded by the cripple to help old Peyrol to sail the
tartane round to the cove below the Escampobar Farm. A glorious
sun shone upon that short passage and the cove itself was full
of sparkling light when they arrived. The few Escampobar goats
wandering on the hillside pretending to feed where no grass was
visible to the naked eye never even raised their heads. A gentle
breeze drove the tartane, as fresh as paint could make her, opposite
a narrow crack in the cliff which gave admittance to a tiny basin,
no bigger than a village pond, concealed at the foot of the southern
hill. It was there that old Peyrol, aided by the Madrague men,
who had their boat with them, towed his ship, the first really
that he ever owned.</p>

<p>Once in, the tartane nearly filled the little basin, and the
fishermen, getting into their boat, rowed away for home. Peyrol,
by spending the afternoon in dragging ropes ashore and fastening
them to various boulders and dwarf trees, moored her to his complete
satisfaction. She was as safe from the tempests there as a house
ashore.</p>

<p>After he had made everything fast on board and had furled the
sails neatly, a matter of some time for one man, Peyrol contemplated
his arrangements, which savoured of rest much more than of wandering,
and found them good. Though he never meant to abandon his room
at the farmhouse, he felt that his true home was in the tartane,
and he rejoiced at the idea that it was concealed from all eyes
except perhaps the eyes of the goats when their arduous feeding
took them on the southern slope. He lingered on board, he even
threw open the sliding door of the little cabin, which now smelt
of fresh paint, not of stale blood. Before he started for the
farm the sun had travelled far beyond Spain and all the sky to
the west was yellow, while on the side of Italy it presented a
sombre canopy pierced here and there with the light of stars.
Catherine put a plate on the table, but nobody asked him any questions.</p>

<p>He spent a lot of his time on board, going down early, coming
up at midday "pour manger la soupe," and sleeping on board almost
every night. He did not like to leave the tartane alone for so
many hours. Often, having climbed a little way up to the house,
he would turn round for a last look at her in the gathering dusk,
and actually would go back again. After Michel had been enlisted
for a crew and had taken his abode on board for good, Peyrol found
it a much easier matter to spend his nights in the lantern-like
room at the top of the farmhouse.</p>

<p>Often waking up at night he would get up to look at the starry
sky out of all his three windows in succession, and think: "Now
there is nothing in the world to prevent me getting out to sea
in less than an hour." As a matter of fact it was possible for
two men to manage the tartane. Thus Peyrol’s thought was comfortingly
true in every way, for he loved to feel himself free, and Michel
of the lagoon, after the death of his depressed dog, had no tie
on earth. It was a fine thought which somehow made it quite easy
for Peyrol to go back to his four-poster and resume his slumbers.</p>
