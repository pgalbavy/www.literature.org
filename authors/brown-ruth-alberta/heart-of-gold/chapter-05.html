<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Mercifully, Peace slept long the next morning, and it was not
until the sun was high in the sky that she opened her eyes to
her surroundings. Then it was with a heavy sense of something
wrong, and she stared uneasily about her, trying to remember what
was the trouble.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I'd done something bad," she said half aloud, "but
I can't think of a thing."</p>

<p>The sound of Allee's footsteps creeping softly along the hall
and a glimpse of an awed, tear-stained face peering at her from
the doorway suddenly recalled to her mind the scene of yesterday,
and the bitter truth rushed over her with agonizing keenness.
She could never walk again! All her days must be spent in a wheel-chair,
a helpless prisoner! The Lilac Lady was right,&mdash;she wanted to
turn her face to the wall, to say good-bye to her friends and
hide,&mdash;hide from the world and everything!</p>

<p>"Peace," whispered a timid voice from the doorway, where Allee
had paused, uncertain whether to stay or to depart.</p>

<p>The invalid stiffened.</p>

<p>"Peace, are you awake?" persisted the pleading voice, for the
brown eyes stared unblinkingly straight ahead of her, and not
a muscle of her tense body moved. "May I come in and sit beside
you?"</p>

<p>"No!" screamed Peace in sudden frenzy, almost paralyzing the
little petitioner on the threshold. "<em>Go away!</em> You can
walk and run and jump, and I never can again. You've got two whole
legs to amuse yourself with and mine are no good. Get out of here!
I don't want to see anyone with legs today&mdash;or tomorrow&mdash;or ever
again!" Jerking the pillow slip over her eyes she sobbed convulsively,
and Allee, with one terrified look at the quivering heap under
the bed-clothes, rushed pellmell from the room, blinded by scalding
tears.</p>

<p>Peace had sent her away! Peace did not want her,&mdash;would not have
her any more! It was the greatest catastrophe of her short life
to be banished by Peace; and stumbling with unseeing eyes down
the hall, she ran headlong into the arms of someone just coming
up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;" began a husky, rumbling voice, and Allee, thinking it
was the President on his way to the sick-room, sobbed out, "O,
Grandpa, she sent me away! She says she never wants to see a pair
of good legs again. You better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's not Grandpa, little one," interrupted the other voice.
"It's I, &mdash;St. John. Do you think she will let me in? Because
I have come especially to see her."</p>

<p>But a sharp, imperative voice from the Flag Room answered them.
"Come back, Allee, I'm sorry I don't like the looks of legs today,
but I want you just the same,&mdash;legs and all."</p>

<p>For an instant Allee looked unbelievingly up into Mr. Strong's
eyes, as if doubtful that she had heard aright; then as the minister
gave her a gentle push toward the door, she bounded lightly away,
and when the Hill Street pastor reached the threshold the two
sisters were locked fast in each other's arms.</p>

<p>All at once, through the tangle of Allee's curls, the brown eyes
spied the form of her beloved friend hesitating in the doorway;
but instead of looking surprised at his presence, Peace pushed
the little sister from her and demanded fiercely, as if his being
there were the most natural thing in the world, "Make faces at
me, St. John,&mdash;the very worst you know how."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear&mdash;" stammered the young minister, as much amazed
at his reception as he could have been had she dashed a cup of
water in his face. "Why, Peace, I don't believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course you know how to make faces!" she interrupted scornfully.
"Do you s'pose I've forgotten that day in Parker down by the barn?
Make some now,&mdash;the most <em>hijious</em> ones you can think of."</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to comply with her strange whim;
so, rumpling up his thick, shining black hair, he proceeded to
distort his comely features into the most surprising contortions
imaginable. But with the heavy ache in his heart and a growing
lump in his throat at the pitifulness of her plight, he was not
real successful in diverting her unhappy thoughts, and with a
mournful wail of woe she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"My child!" he cried contritely, and in an instant his strong
arms closed about the huddled figure, and he held her fast, crooning
softly in her ear as a mother might over her babe, until at length
the convulsive gasps eased, grew less frequent, and finally ceased.</p>

<p>There was a long-drawn, quivering sigh, a last gulp or two and
Peace hiccoughed, "It's no use, St. John. I can't coax up a ghost
of a smile from anywhere. I've <em>thunk</em> of all the funniest
things that ever happened to me or anyone else; I've scratched
my brains to 'member the funny stories I s'lected for Sadie Wenzell's
bunch of scrapbooks; I've even pretended the funniest things I
could imagine, but it won't work. I knew if there was a sign of
a laugh left inside of me, your horrible faces would bring it
out. It did in Parker, when I thought I never could smile again.
But this time&mdash;get your legs out of sight,&mdash;under the bed,&mdash;anywhere
so's I can't see them. I don't like their looks!"</p>

<p>Had the situation been less tragic, he could not have refrained
from laughing at the ludicrous way she bristled up and snapped
out her command; but mindful only of the great trouble which had
suddenly overshadowed the young life, he hastily tucked his long
limbs out of sight under the edge of the bed, slumped as far down
in his chair as he possibly could, and fell to energetically stroking
the brown curls tumbled about the hot, flushed face, as he vainly
tried to think of some comforting words with which to soothe the
rebellious, sorrowful child.</p>

<p>From below came the sound of a voice singing softly, and though
the words were indistinguishable, the three occupants of the Flag
Room caught snatches of the tune Peace loved so well, the Gleaners'
Motto Song. Recalling the days when the brown-eyed child had made
the little Hill Street parsonage ring with this very melody, the
preacher unconsciously began to chant,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'When the days are gloomy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing some happy song,<br/>
Meet the world's repining<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a courage strong;<br/>
Go with faith undaunted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the ills of life,<br/>
Scatter smiles and sunshine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er its toil and strife.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>"Well, don't it beat all?" exclaimed Peace wearily.</p>

<p>"Doesn't what beat all?" mildly inquired the pastor, as she made
no effort to explain her words.</p>

<p>"How some folks will wear a tune to a frazzle," was the disconcerting
reply. "There's Faith, now, she hasn't played anything for days
'xcept '<em>Carve-a-leery-rusty-canner</em>!' And when it ain't
that it's '<em>Nose-arts Snorter</em>,' or those wretched <em>archipelagoes</em>.
I'm so sick of 'em all that I could shout when she touches the
piano. As for that song you were just droning,&mdash;why, everyone
in this house seems to think it's the only thing going. There
is nothing left of it now but tatters."</p>

<p>The preacher had abruptly ceased his humming, and as Allee crept
quietly from the room to hush the singer below, he suddenly remembered
a commission given him by his wife; and fumbling in his pocket,
he drew out a small book, daintily bound in white and gold. "Elspeth
sent you this booklet, dear," he ventured, somewhat timidly, for
after two such rebuffs as he had received in his endeavor to cheer
the sufferer, he was at a loss to know what to say or do next.
"She could not come today herself, but she thought this little
story might please you."</p>

<p>"Thanks," replied Peace, dropping the volume on the pillow without
a spark of interest in face or voice. "I'd rather have seen her.
She has got some sense. Books haven't. I've been stuffed so full
of stories, I am ready to bu'st." Then, as if fearing that she
had been rude to this dearest of friends, she added hastily, "But
I s'pose there is room for one more. It must be good or Elspeth
wouldn't have sent it. What is it about?"</p>

<p>"It's the story of a little girl named Gwen, who fell from&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peace stopped him with a peremptory wave of her hand. "That will
do for the present," she said coldly, in such exact imitation
of Miss Phelps that no one who had ever met the teacher could
possibly mistake her tone. "I don't like the name. It sounds like
'grin'."</p>

<p>The minister rubbed his head in perplexity. Never in all his
acquaintance with Peace had he seen her in such a mood. Was this
child among the pillows really Peace, the sunbeam of this home,
the sunbeam of every home she chanced to enter? Poor little girl!
What a pity such a terrible misfortune should have befallen her!
She stirred uneasily, and he hurriedly asked, "Would you rather
I should go away and leave you alone?"</p>

<p>"No! O, no!" She clutched one big hand closer with both of hers,
and a look of alarm leaped into her eyes, so heavy with weeping.
"It's easier&mdash;the pain here," laying one thin hand over her heart,
"it's easier with you here. I wish you had brought Elspeth."</p>

<p>"She will come some other day," he answered gently, glad to see
a more natural expression creep over the white face, though his
heart ached at the sorrowful tone of her voice. "What would you
like to have me do? Talk?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you've anything int'resting to say," she murmured drowsily.</p>

<p>"And if not?" For he saw that it would be only a matter of minutes
before she would be in the Land of Nod again.</p>

<p>"Then just hold me. I'm tired," she answered wearily.</p>

<p>So he sat and held her on her pillows until her regular breathing
told him that she was fast asleep, when, laying her back upon
the bed, he left her with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>"I never dreamed that a child so young could take it so hard,"
he confided to his wife in troubled tones when he had told her
the whole sad story. "She seems to have grown old in a night."</p>

<p>"Poor little birdie," Elizabeth tenderly murmured, stroking the
dark hair from her sleeping son's forehead as she laid him in
his crib for his nap. "Why did they tell her so soon? The family
themselves haven't grown accustomed to the meaning of it yet."</p>

<p>"No one knows how she learned it, Elspeth. She was asleep under
the trees when the President came home with the sad news. He had
been to consult that famous specialist about the child's condition
when the surgeon told him that the case was hopeless, so far as
her walking again is concerned. He was so unmanned by the verdict
that he blurted it out to Mrs. Campbell immediately upon his return
home, and the girls overheard it. But Peace was out-of-doors all
the while. She didn't waken for dinner; but when everyone was
in bed, Mrs. Campbell heard her crying, and went to discover what
was the matter. They are terribly broken up about the whole affair.
It seems wicked to say so, but had the accident happened to any
other of the sisters, it would not have seemed so dreadful. What
is <em>Peace</em> ever going to do without those nimble, dancing
feet?"</p>

<p>"Our Peace will surprise us yet," prophesied the little wife
hopefully. "This experience won't down her, hard as it seems now,
if she is made of the stuff I think she is."</p>

<p>But as the days rolled by in that afflicted household, it really
seemed as if they had lost their engaging, winsome little Peace
for all time, so changed did the invalid grow. Nothing suited
her, everything annoyed. The girls talked too much or were too
silent; the servants were too noisy or too obviously quiet; the
President's shoes clumped and his slippers squeaked; Mrs. Campbell
always pulled the curtains too low or not low enough. The dogs'
barking fretted her, the singing of the canary made her peevish,
even the cat's purring brought forth a protest; but as soon as
the unreasonable patient discovered that all the pets had been
banished on her account, she demanded them back. However, the
long-suffering members of the family could not find it in their
hearts to chide, and they redoubled their efforts to make their
little favorite forget. Those were gloomy days in the Campbell
household, for they sadly missed the merry laughter, the gay whistle,
the unexpected pranks and frank speeches of this child of the
sunshine and out-of-doors. At first they had tried to be cheerful
and full of fun in the sick-room, hoping to win back the merry
smile to the white lips; but Peace resented this attitude, and
straightway they ceased their songs and laughter, only to have
her demand them again. Unhappy, capricious Peace!</p>

<p>"Why don't you play on the piano any more?" she inquired of Faith
one afternoon, when it was that sister's turn to amuse the invalid
for an hour or two.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to?" cried Faith eagerly, for her fingers were
just itching to glide over the ivory keys.</p>

<p>"Of course,&mdash;s'posing you play something pretty."</p>

<p>So Faith took her place at her beloved instrument and dashed
into a brilliant, rattling jig which had always been a favorite
of the brown-haired sister.</p>

<p>But she had played scarcely a dozen measures when a shrill, imperious
voice from above shrieked, "Don't play that! O, stop, stop! Can't
you see it's got <em>legs</em>?"</p>

<p>"Legs?" wondered Faith, her hands poised in mid air, so abruptly
had she ceased her playing.</p>

<p>"There's a million pair of legs to that tune and every one of
'em can dance. Play something without legs."</p>

<p>The utter ridiculousness of the complaint did not occur to Faith,
but with an unusual display of patience, she tried air after air,
hoping to find something which might satisfy the childish whim
of the lame sister, only to be rewarded at last by a peevish call,
"You may as well give it up, Faith. They've <em>all</em> got legs."</p>

<p>The entire family was at their wits' end. No one had a sane suggestion
to offer, and their hosts of friends were in the same predicament.
When it seemed as if something must surely give way under the
strain, Peace suddenly subsided into a state of utter indifference
to her surroundings, more alarming to her loved ones than had
been her peevish, unreasonable demands. Nothing interested her,
books she loathed, conversation bored her, neighborly calls from
her dearest friends wearied her, she no longer yearned for the
sunshine and flowers of the garden; indeed, she showed no desire
to be out-of-doors at all, but lay day after day in the wheel-chair
by the balcony window, staring with somber, unseeing eyes out
over the river. Nothing family or friends could do roused her
from her apathy, and despair descended upon the household. Must
this little life which they loved so dearly fade away before their
eyes, and they helpless to prevent?</p>

<p>"O, Donald," sobbed Mrs. Campbell, clinging desperately to her
husband's strong arm, "I cannot bear it, I cannot bear it! She
takes it so hard! It is torture to watch her suffer so. Our precious
Peace!"</p>

<p>"If only her St. Elizabeth could come to her!" sighed the baffled
President.</p>

<p>But it was not her beloved saint of the parsonage who saved the
day. It was her Lilac Lady, now sleeping under the sod of the
wind-kissed hillside, and Aunt Pen was her messenger.</p>

<p>It was a breathless, sultry afternoon in late summer when the
sweet-faced matron of Oak Knoll turned in at the President's gate
and sought out the invalid lying motionless under the oak trees
where the fierce heat had driven her. The little face among the
pillows was no longer rosy and round; blue veins showed at the
temples, the lips were colorless, the eyes hollow; the hands,
once so brown and strong, were thin and waxy-white; the whole
body lay inert,&mdash;lifeless, it seemed; and a pang of fear gripped
the gentle heart brooding so tenderly over the poor wrecked life.</p>

<p>"Are you asleep, darling?" she whispered softly, touching with
light fingers the clustering rings of dark brown which covered
the shapely head.</p>

<p>The mournful eyes opened dully, and Peace murmured parrot fashion,
"Good afternoon, Aunt Pen. I hope you keep well these hot days.
You must take care of yourself, you know."</p>

<p>Secretly amazed, the woman merely stooped and kissed the white
face, as she settled herself comfortably in a nearby chair and
cheerily answered, "Yes, I am well, dear, and all the little birdlings
are, too. I intended to bring Giuseppe and his violin this afternoon,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's just as well you didn't," interrupted the other voice in
lifeless tones. "Prob'ly <em>his</em> music has legs, too, and
I haven't any use for such things these days."</p>

<p>"But he had promised to play for a dear old lady at the Home,"
continued Aunt Pen, as if she had not noticed the interruption.
"So I brought you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Some more magazines," again broke in Peace, perceiving the gay
covers in the woman's hand.</p>

<p>"That was very kind of you I'm sure, but I have a whole libr'y
at my&mdash;at my <em>de</em>-mand. So you put yourself to a lot of
trouble all for nothing."</p>

<p>"This is a different kind of magazine from any you have," replied
the woman soberly, though sorely tempted to smile at the stilted,
unnatural tones of her little favorite.</p>

<p>"Is it?" Just a spark of interest flickered in the somber eyes.
"Why, I thought I had the whole c'lection already. Folks seem
to think I don't want to do anything but read, and they keep the
house pretty well filled up with magazines, old and new. Last
week I had Allee telephone to the Salvation Army to come and get
them. But it didn't do any good,&mdash;we've had as many more brought
in since."</p>

<p>"This is the one your Lilac Lady was reading when she&mdash;fell asleep,"
said Aunt Pen gently, a little catch in her voice as she thought
of Peace, doomed to spend the rest of her days in a wheel-chair,
just as that other girl, the Lilac Lady, had done.</p>

<p>"Oh! And you brought it to me! I sh'd think you would want to
keep it yourself."</p>

<p>"I did, dearie. I laid it away among my treasures, but today
I chanced upon it, and in turning the pages, I caught a glimpse
of a slip of paper written on, in her handwriting. I had not examined
the book since the day I picked it up from the floor beside her
chair; but this morning I drew out the scrap she had written and
found a little message for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For me?" Incredulous surprise animated the white face.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. Some verses she had written that last hour,&mdash;not
even complete. I know she intended them for you. Perhaps she felt
that she would be&mdash;asleep&mdash;before you came, so she wrote a little
message for you, Peace, but I never found it until today. Would
you care to have me read it to you?"</p>

<p>"Let me read it, please." Peace snatched the paper eagerly and
with jealous eyes scanned the simple stanzas penned so many months
ago for just that very moment.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Up the garden pathway,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Light as the morning air,<br/>
Singing and laughing gayly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A child with face so fair<br/>
Dances with arms outreaching,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes ashine with glee,<br/>
Nor pauses until she reaches<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The chair 'neath the old oak tree,<br/>
Where, chained by mortal weaknesses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I lie from day to day<br/>
Waiting my darling's coming.&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! could I keep her alway!&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Child of flowers and sunshine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Child of laughter and love,<br/>
Peace,&mdash;a God-given blessing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight from the heavens above,<br/>
Bringing the breath of the woodland,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfume of sun-kissed flowers,<br/>
The freshness of vagrant breezes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweetness of cooling showers;<br/>
Bringing the thrilling music<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of skylarks and forest birds,<br/>
Heart-healing, soul-cheering measures,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wondrous songs without words.

</p>
<p>
Peace,&mdash;oh, how can I tell it?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The marvelous peace you have brought,<br/>
The wonderful lessons of living<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your generous spirit has taught,<br/>
Easing the burden of sorrow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Soothing the sharp sting of pain,<br/>
Bringing fresh aspirations,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My Peace gives me <em>hope</em> again!"

</p>
</div>
<p>Once, twice, three times she read the lines. Then turning puzzled,
wondering eyes upon Aunt Pen, she whispered eagerly, "What does
it all mean, please? Did she really feel that way, Aunt Pen? Did
I scatter sunshine after all? Was she happier when I was with
her? O, did <em>I&mdash;</em>make her&mdash;forget?"</p>

<p>"More than you will ever know," answered the woman warmly, squeezing
the thin fingers lying across her knee. "You brought back the
sunshine she thought had gone out of her life forever. You gave
her something to live for, something to do, made life seem worth
while. O, my little Peace, it is just as the poem tells you,&mdash;you
gave her <em>hope</em>!"</p>

<p>For a long time the child lay lost in thought, and only the faint
rustling of the leaves overhead broke the stillness. Then she
said sadly, glancing down at the useless feet in their gay slippers,
"But I had my legs <em>then</em>."</p>

<p>"You have your smile now. A happy heart is worth more than a
dozen pair of legs, dear. It was your merry voice, your gay laughter,
your joyous nature that cheered your Lilac Lady. Surely you didn't
lose all those when you lost the use of your feet!"</p>

<p>Peace smiled ruefully. "You'd have thought so if you had lived
with me since I got hurt," she confessed.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," Aunt Pen vigorously contradicted. "Our
real Peace, our little sunbeam has just been hiding under a dark
cloud all this while. She is coming back to us her own gay self
some day,&mdash;soon, we hope."</p>

<p>"Do you b'lieve that?" Peace eagerly demanded.</p>

<p>"I know it," the woman answered with conviction.</p>

<p>"But s'posing I have really forgotten how to laugh and&mdash;and whistle,
and be nice?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! As if you could have forgotten all that, dear! But even
then, it is never too late to learn, you know."</p>

<p>"That's so. And maybe after a bit it would be easier. <em>I&mdash;</em>guess
I'll&mdash;try to learn&mdash;again, Aunt Pen. May I keep this little poem
so's I won't forget any more? It's really mine, for she wrote
it for me, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, darling. That's your message. You helped your Lilac
Lady, and now she is going to help you."</p>
