<p>SEVERAL days passed before Mr. Blackbird returned to Farmer Green's
garden. And when at last he flew across the meadow one morning and
perched on the garden fence, to take a look around before beginning his
breakfast, he saw that Mrs. Jolly Robin was making countless trips
between the garden and her home. Early as it was she was hard at work
feeding her nestlings.
</p>
<p>"How are the pickings this morning?" Mr. Blackbird called to her.
</p><p>"I'm finding plenty for my children to eat--if that's what you mean,"
Mrs. Robin replied somewhat haughtily. Mr. Blackbird laughed in the
sleeve of his black coat. The rascal delighted in using language that
did not please Mrs. Robin.
</p><p>"If the pickings are good, then there must be fewer pickers," he
remarked with a grin. "I suppose Grandfather Mole has taken my advice
and turned over a new leaf."
</p><p>"I don't know about that," said Mrs. Robin. "Anyhow, there are plenty of
good crawling things stirring after last night's shower. Everything
seems to be coming up out of the garden this morning."
</p><p>She had scarcely finished speaking when Grandfather Mole poked his head
from beneath a head of lettuce. Mr. Blackbird was just about to begin
his breakfast. But he paused when he saw Grandfather Mole.
</p><p>"Hello!" he cried. "What brings you to the surface?"
</p><p>Grandfather Mole knew Mr. Blackbird's voice at once.
</p><p>"I'm glad you're here!" he exclaimed. "I want you to tell Farmer Green
the news. For I know he'll be delighted to hear it."
</p><p>Then Mr. Blackbird did an ungentlemanly thing. He winked at Jolly
Robin's wife. But he was a rowdy. So what could you expect of him?
</p><p>"You've turned over a new leaf, have you?" he asked Grandfather Mole.
</p><p>"Yes!" said Grandfather Mole. "And not only one! I've turned over a new
one every day since I last saw you."
</p><p>Mr. Blackbird replied that he was glad to know it.

</p><p>"At least," Grandfather Mole continued, "I've turned over the newest
leaves I could. Of course you can't turn over a leaf unless it's big
enough to turn over. When a leaf is so young that it wraps itself around
the main stalk it's useless to try to turn it over. And it's a great
waste of time waiting for it to grow.... But it's easy to turn over a
big one." Suiting his action to his words, Grandfather Mole stepped up
to a loose-growing head of lettuce, and thrusting his long nose under a
drooping leaf he lifted it up and pushed it over.
</p><p>As soon as he moved aside a little the leaf promptly righted itself.
Grandfather Mole felt it brush his back as it swept into place again.
</p><p>"Of course," he remarked, "you can't expect a leaf to stay turned over,
unless you want to stand and hold it in place. And that would be a great
waste of time--especially for one as hungry as I am." And poking his
drill-like snout into the earth, he drew forth a huge angleworm, which
quickly disappeared down his throat.
</p><p>Mr. Blackbird choked; and not over anything he was eating, either. He
choked because he was angry.
</p><p>"It's no use," he said gloomily to Mrs. Robin, as soon as he could
speak. "It's no use trying to get Grandfather Mole to stop eating
angleworms. In my opinion, he's too old to turn over a new leaf--the way
I meant.
</p><p>"You can't teach an old Mole new tricks," said Mr. Blackbird.
