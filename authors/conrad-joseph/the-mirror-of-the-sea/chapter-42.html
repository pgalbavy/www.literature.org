<p> It was not <em>Tremolino’s</em> fault that the syndicate depended
so much on the wit and wisdom and the information of Doña Rita. 
She had taken a little furnished house on the Prado for the good
of the cause—<em>Por el Rey</em>!  She was always taking little
houses for somebody’s good, for the sick or the sorry, for broken-down
artists, cleaned-out gamblers, temporarily unlucky speculators—<em>vieux
amis</em>—old friends, as she used to explain apologetically,
with a shrug of her fine shoulders.</p>

<p>Whether Don Carlos was one of the "old friends," too, it’s hard
to say. More unlikely things have been heard of in smoking-rooms. 
All I know is that one evening, entering incautiously the salon
of the little house just after the news of a considerable Carlist
success had reached the faithful, I was seized round the neck
and waist and whirled recklessly three times round the room, to
the crash of upsetting furniture and the humming of a valse tune
in a warm contralto voice.</p>

<p>When released from the dizzy embrace, I sat down on the carpet—suddenly,
without affectation.  In this unpretentious attitude I became
aware that J. M. K. B. had followed me into the room, elegant,
fatal, correct and severe in a white tie and large shirt-front. 
In answer to his politely sinister, prolonged glance of inquiry,
I overheard Doña Rita murmuring, with some confusion and annoyance,
"<em>Vous êtes bête mon cher</em>.  <em>Voyons</em>! <em>Ça n’a
aucune conséquence</em>."  Well content in this case to be of
no particular consequence, I had already about me the elements
of some worldly sense.</p>

<p>Rearranging my collar, which, truth to say, ought to have been
a round one above a short jacket, but was not, I observed felicitously
that I had come to say good-bye, being ready to go off to sea
that very night with the <em>Tremolino</em>.  Our hostess, slightly
panting yet, and just a shade dishevelled, turned tartly upon
J. M. K. B., desiring to know when <em>he</em> would be ready
to go off by the <em>Tremolino</em>, or in any other way, in order
to join the royal headquarters.  Did he intend, she asked ironically,
to wait for the very eve of the entry into Madrid?  Thus by a
judicious exercise of tact and asperity we re-established the
atmospheric equilibrium of the room long before I left them a
little before midnight, now tenderly reconciled, to walk down
to the harbour and hail the <em>Tremolino</em> by the usual soft
whistle from the edge of the quay.  It was our signal, invariably
heard by the ever-watchful Dominic, the <em>padrone</em>.</p>

<p>He would raise a lantern silently to light my steps along the
narrow, springy plank of our primitive gangway.  "And so we are
going off," he would murmur directly my foot touched the deck. 
I was the harbinger of sudden departures, but there was nothing
in the world sudden enough to take Dominic unawares.  His thick
black moustaches, curled every morning with hot tongs by the barber
at the corner of the quay, seemed to hide a perpetual smile. 
But nobody, I believe, had ever seen the true shape of his lips. 
From the slow, imperturbable gravity of that broad-chested man
you would think he had never smiled in his life.  In his eyes
lurked a look of perfectly remorseless irony, as though he had
been provided with an extremely experienced soul; and the slightest
distension of his nostrils would give to his bronzed face a look
of extraordinary boldness. This was the only play of feature of
which he seemed capable, being a Southerner of a concentrated,
deliberate type.  His ebony hair curled slightly on the temples. 
He may have been forty years old, and he was a great voyager on
the inland sea.</p>

<p>Astute and ruthless, he could have rivalled in resource the unfortunate
son of Laertes and Anticlea.  If he did not pit his craft and
audacity against the very gods, it is only because the Olympian
gods are dead. Certainly no woman could frighten him.  A one-eyed
giant would not have had the ghost of a chance against Dominic
Cervoni, of Corsica, not Ithaca; and no king, son of kings, but
of very respectable family—authentic Caporali, he affirmed.  But
that is as it may be.  The Caporali families date back to the
twelfth century.</p>

<p>For want of more exalted adversaries Dominic turned his audacity
fertile in impious stratagems against the powers of the earth,
as represented by the institution of Custom-houses and every mortal
belonging thereto—scribes, officers, and guardacostas afloat and
ashore.  He was the very man for us, this modern and unlawful
wanderer with his own legend of loves, dangers, and bloodshed. 
He told us bits of it sometimes in measured, ironic tones.  He
spoke Catalonian, the Italian of Corsica and the French of Provençe
with the same easy naturalness.  Dressed in shore-togs, a white
starched shirt, black jacket, and round hat, as I took him once
to see Doña Rita, he was extremely presentable.  He could make
himself interesting by a tactful and rugged reserve set off by
a grim, almost imperceptible, playfulness of tone and manner.</p>

<p>He had the physical assurance of strong-hearted men.  After half
an hour’s interview in the dining-room, during which they got
in touch with each other in an amazing way, Rita told us in her
best <em>grande dame</em> manner: "<em>Mais il esi parfait</em>,
<em>cet homme</em>."  He was perfect.  On board the <em>Tremolino</em>,
wrapped up in a black <em>caban</em>, the picturesque cloak of
Mediterranean seamen, with those massive moustaches and his remorseless
eyes set off by the shadow of the deep hood, he looked piratical
and monkish and darkly initiated into the most awful mysteries
of the sea.</p>
