<p>It was a wise proceeding on the part of the rancher. The opportunity
to make a substantial repast was theirs, and as he had remarked,
there was no certainty when it would come again.</p>

<p>The bag in which the provisions were placed was taken from the
back of Jerry, and the father helped his child and wife, who ate
until they were fully satisfied. He dipped up water with Dot's
small tin cup from the stream in front, and with it their thirst
was slaked.</p>

<p>"Molly," he suggested, "you can carry one or two of the sandwiches
without inconvenience."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Let us both do so; we may lose Jerry, and if so, they will come
in handy."</p>

<p>"I have a couple, too," said Dot.</p>

<p>"It isn't best that you should burden yourself with them."</p>

<p>"But I can't help it, papa."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"They're inside of me," and the parents, even in their great
dread, smiled at the odd conceit of the little one, who chuckled
softly to think how she had "fooled" her papa.</p>

<p>The delay was brief. The rancher knew that it was impossible
to reach Fort Meade without crossing the stream before them, with
the probability that still others awaited them at no great distance.
It can be understood with what depth of dread he contemplated
swimming the animals over, with the certainty of the saturation
of all their garments, on this winter night, and the cold steadily
increasing.</p>

<p>In short, it meant perishing, unless a fire was kindled, in which
case, a delay would be necessitated that would throw away all
the advantage secured by flight. He was determined not to do it,
unless actually driven to it as a last resource.</p>

<p>He did not forget that he was now where there was an abundance
of material with which a raft could be constructed that would
obviate this exposure, but the building of such a rude craft,
under the circumstances, was next to impossible. He had no implement
except his pocket knife, and might grope about in the darkness
for hours without getting together enough timber to float them
to the other side.</p>

<p>Obviously one of two things must be done&mdash;try to cross where
they were or follow the bank down until a fording place could
be found, and repeated trials were likely to be necessary before
success was obtainable.</p>

<p>Singular it is that so often out of the mouths of babes are heard
the words of wisdom.</p>

<p>The rancher had risen to his feet, and was in the act of mounting
his pony to enter the water, when Dot spoke:</p>

<p>"Why don't you let Dick go ahead and you ride behind on Sally?"</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" exclaimed the father admiringly; "I begin
to believe that if we reach the fort, it will be through your
guidance, my precious little one," and, stooping over, he kissed
her cheek.</p>

<p>"Strange that we did not think of that," remarked the mother.
"Dot is wise beyond her years."</p>

<p>The plan was adopted at once.</p>

<p>The mare ridden by the mother and child, and the horse of the
father, were so intelligent that no risk was involved in the essay,
which insured against the immersion held in such natural dread.</p>

<p>The saddle and trappings were removed from Dick, while the rancher
mounted upon the side-saddle belonging to his wife. Then the horse
was ordered to enter the water, and, with some hesitation, he
obeyed, his owner being but a step or two behind on the mare.</p>

<p>The gloom was so deep that the hearing, and not the sight, must
be depended upon. That, however, was reliable when nothing was
likely to occur to divert it from its duty.</p>

<p>The stream was no more than fairly entered when the rancher made
two unwelcome discoveries: The current was much stronger than
he had anticipated, and the water deepened rapidly. Ten feet from
shore it touched the body of the mare.</p>

<p>Inasmuch, however, as Dick was still walking, there was hope
that the depth might increase no more, or, at most, not to a dangerous
extent.</p>

<p>Mr. Starr could not see his own horse, but he plainly heard him
as he advanced cautiously, feeling his way, and showing by his
sniffing that the task was anything but pleasant to him. Not knowing
the width of the stream, it was impossible to tell in what portion
of it they were: but he was already listening for the sounds which
would show that his animal was climbing out on the other side,
when the very thing he feared took place.</p>

<p>A loud splash, followed by a peculiar rustling noise, showed
that Dick was swimming.</p>

<p>At the same moment the mare sank so deeply that, had not the
rider thrown his feet backward along her spine, with his body
extended over the saddle and her neck, he would have been saturated
to the knees. As it was, Sally was within a hair of being carried
off her feet by the force of the current.</p>

<p>The rancher drew her head around, and, after a sharp struggle,
she held her own, and began laboring back to the shore she had
left; putting forth such vigor that it was plain the task was
far more agreeable than the one upon which she first ventured.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dick was swimming powerfully for the farther bank,
and before his owner could think of calling to him, owing to his
own flurry, he heard his hoofs stamp the hard earth. True, he
had landed, but that brief space of deep water was as bad as if
its width were ten times as great; it could not be passed without
the saturation of the garments of all, and that, as has been said,
was not to be endured.</p>

<p>Before the mare could return Mr. Starr called to his pony, and
the animal promptly obeyed, emerging only a minute after the mare
from the point where he had entered.</p>

<p>"It's no use," he said to his waiting wife and little one; "there
is one place where the horses must swim."</p>

<p>"Did you get wet, papa?" enquired Dot, solicitous for his welfare.</p>

<p>"No; but I came mighty near it."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose we must follow down the stream, and try it elsewhere,"
said the wife.</p>

<p>"Yes, with the discouraging fact that we are likely to pass a
dozen fordable points, and strike a place that is deeper than
anywhere else."</p>

<p>The saddles were readjusted, and the move made without delay.
Since it was hard to thread their way through the wood, which
lined the stream only a short distance from the water, they withdrew
from it to the prairie, where travelling was easier.</p>

<p>Reaching the open plain, but keeping close to the margin of the
timber, from which, fortunately, they had emerged at a point considerably
removed from that of the entrance, the rancher repeated the precaution
he had used before.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>Once more the snow was brushed aside at his feet and the ear
pressed against the ground.</p>

<p>To his dismay he heard the tramp of horses' hoofs on the hard
earth.</p>

<p>"They are near at hand!" he said, in a startled whisper; "we
must get away as quickly as we can."</p>

<p>He hastily helped his wife and little one on the back of the
mare, mounted his own animal, and, with the pack-horse at the
rear, moved along the timber on a rapid walk, continually peering
off in the gloom, as though it was possible for him to see the
Sioux, who certainly were at no great distance.</p>

<p>One fear troubled him: Suppose they should resort to the same
artifice as he, and one of them appeal to the earth for evidence.
He would be equally quick to discover the proximity of the fugitives,
and with his sense of hearing trained to the finest point by many
years' exercise, would locate the whites with unerring precision.</p>
