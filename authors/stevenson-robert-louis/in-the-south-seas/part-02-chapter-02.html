<p>By a little before noon we were running down the coast of our
destination, Fakarava: the air very light, the sea near smooth; though
still we were accompanied by a continuous murmur from the beach, like the
sound of a distant train.  The isle is of a huge longitude, the enclosed
lagoon thirty miles by ten or twelve, and the coral tow-path, which they
call the land, some eighty or ninety miles by (possibly) one furlong.
That part by which we sailed was all raised; the underwood excellently
green, the topping wood of coco-palms continuous—a mark, if I had known
it, of man’s intervention.  For once more, and once more unconsciously,
we were within hail of fellow-creatures, and that vacant beach was but a
pistol-shot from the capital city of the archipelago.  But the life of an
atoll, unless it be enclosed, passes wholly on the shores of the lagoon;
it is there the villages are seated, there the canoes ply and are drawn
up; and the beach of the ocean is a place accursed and deserted, the fit
scene only for wizardry and shipwreck, and in the native belief a
haunting ground of murderous spectres.
</p>
<p>By and by we might perceive a breach in the low barrier; the woods
ceased; a glittering point ran into the sea, tipped with an emerald shoal
the mark of entrance.  As we drew near we met a little run of sea—the
private sea of the lagoon having there its origin and end, and here, in
the jaws of the gateway, trying vain conclusions with the more majestic
heave of the Pacific.  The <u>Casco</u> scarce avowed a shock; but there are
times and circumstances when these harbour mouths of inland basins vomit
floods, deflecting, burying, and dismasting ships.  For, conceive a
lagoon perfectly sealed but in the one point, and that of merely
navigable width; conceive the tide and wind to have heaped for hours
together in that coral fold a superfluity of waters, and the tide to
change and the wind fall—the open sluice of some great reservoirs at home
will give an image of the unstemmable effluxion.
</p><p>We were scarce well headed for the pass before all heads were craned over
the rail.  For the water, shoaling under our board, became changed in a
moment to surprising hues of blue and grey; and in its transparency the
coral branched and blossomed, and the fish of the inland sea cruised
visibly below us, stained and striped, and even beaked like parrots.  I
have paid in my time to view many curiosities; never one so curious as
that first sight over the ship’s rail in the lagoon of Fakarava.  But let
not the reader be deceived with hope.  I have since entered, I suppose,
some dozen atolls in different parts of the Pacific, and the experience
has never been repeated.  That exquisite hue and transparency of
submarine day, and these shoals of rainbow fish, have not enraptured me
again.
</p><p>Before we could raise our eyes from that engaging spectacle the schooner
had slipped betwixt the pierheads of the reef, and was already quite
committed to the sea within.  The containing shores are so little
erected, and the lagoon itself is so great, that, for the more part, it
seemed to extend without a check to the horizon.  Here and there, indeed,
where the reef carried an inlet, like a signet-ring upon a finger, there
would be a pencilling of palms; here and there, the green wall of wood
ran solid for a length of miles; and on the port hand, under the highest
grove of trees, a few houses sparkled white—Rotoava, the metropolitan
settlement of the Paumotus.  Hither we beat in three tacks, and came to
an anchor close in shore, in the first smooth water since we had left San
Francisco, five fathoms deep, where a man might look overboard all day at
the vanishing cable, the coral patches, and the many-coloured fish.
</p><p>Fakarava was chosen to be the seat of Government from nautical
considerations only.  It is eccentrically situate; the productions, even
for a low island, poor; the population neither many nor—for Low
Islanders—industrious.  But the lagoon has two good passages, one to
leeward, one to windward, so that in all states of the wind it can be
left and entered, and this advantage, for a government of scattered
islands, was decisive.  A pier of coral, landing-stairs, a harbour light
upon a staff and pillar, and two spacious Government bungalows in a
handsome fence, give to the northern end of Rotoava a great air of
consequence.  This is confirmed on the one hand by an empty prison, on
the other by a gendarmerie pasted over with hand-bills in Tahitian,
land-law notices from Papeete, and republican sentiments from Paris,
signed (a little after date) ‘Jules Grévy, <u>Perihidente</u>.’  Quite at the
far end a belfried Catholic chapel concludes the town; and between, on a
smooth floor of white coral sand and under the breezy canopy of
coco-palms, the houses of the natives stand irregularly scattered, now
close on the lagoon for the sake of the breeze, now back under the palms
for love of shadow.
</p><p>Not a soul was to be seen.  But for the thunder of the surf on the far
side, it seemed you might have heard a pin drop anywhere about that
capital city.  There was something thrilling in the unexpected silence,
something yet more so in the unexpected sound.  Here before us a sea
reached to the horizon, rippling like an inland mere; and behold! close
at our back another sea assaulted with assiduous fury the reverse of the
position.  At night the lantern was run up and lit a vacant pier.  In one
house lights were seen and voices heard, where the population (I was
told) sat playing cards.  A little beyond, from deep in the darkness of
the palm-grove, we saw the glow and smelt the aromatic odour of a coal of
cocoa-nut husk, a relic of the evening kitchen.  Crickets sang; some
shrill thing whistled in a tuft of weeds; and the mosquito hummed and
stung.  There was no other trace that night of man, bird, or insect in
the isle.  The moon, now three days old, and as yet but a silver crescent
on a still visible sphere, shone through the palm canopy with vigorous
and scattered lights.  The alleys where we walked were smoothed and
weeded like a boulevard; here and there were plants set out; here and
there dusky cottages clustered in the shadow, some with verandahs.  A
public garden by night, a rich and fashionable watering-place in a
by-season, offer sights and vistas not dissimilar.  And still, on the one
side, stretched the lapping mere, and from the other the deep sea still
growled in the night.  But it was most of all on board, in the dead
hours, when I had been better sleeping, that the spell of Fakarava seized
and held me.  The moon was down.  The harbour lantern and two of the
greater planets drew vari-coloured wakes on the lagoon.  From shore the
cheerful watch-cry of cocks rang out at intervals above the organ-point
of surf.  And the thought of this depopulated capital, this protracted
thread of annular island with its crest of coco-palms and fringe of
breakers, and that tranquil inland sea that stretched before me till it
touched the stars, ran in my head for hours with delight.
</p><p>So long as I stayed upon that isle these thoughts were constant.  I lay
down to sleep, and woke again with an unblunted sense of my surroundings.
I was never weary of calling up the image of that narrow causeway, on
which I had my dwelling, lying coiled like a serpent, tail to mouth, in
the outrageous ocean, and I was never weary of passing—a mere
quarter-deck parade—from the one side to the other, from the shady,
habitable shores of the lagoon to the blinding desert and uproarious
breakers of the opposite beach.  The sense of insecurity in such a thread
of residence is more than fanciful.  Hurricanes and tidal waves over-leap
these humble obstacles; Oceanus remembers his strength, and, where houses
stood and palms flourished, shakes his white beard again over the barren
coral.  Fakarava itself has suffered; the trees immediately beyond my
house were all of recent replantation; and Anaa is only now recovered
from a heavier stroke.  I knew one who was then dwelling in the isle.  He
told me that he and two ship captains walked to the sea beach.  There for
a while they viewed the oncoming breakers, till one of the captains
clapped suddenly his hand before his eyes and cried aloud that he could
endure no longer to behold them.  This was in the afternoon; in the dark
hours of the night the sea burst upon the island like a flood; the
settlement was razed all but the church and presbytery; and, when day
returned, the survivors saw themselves clinging in an abattis of uprooted
coco-palms and ruined houses.
</p><p>Danger is but a small consideration.  But men are more nicely sensible of
a discomfort; and the atoll is a discomfortable home.  There are some,
and these probably ancient, where a deep soil has formed and the most
valuable fruit-trees prosper.  I have walked in one, with equal
admiration and surprise, through a forest of huge breadfruits, eating
bananas and stumbling among taro as I went.  This was in the atoll of
Namorik in the Marshall group, and stands alone in my experience.  To
give the opposite extreme, which is yet far more near the average, I will
describe the soil and productions of Fakarava.  The surface of that
narrow strip is for the more part of broken coral lime-stone, like
volcanic clinkers, and excruciating to the naked foot; in some atolls, I
believe, not in Fakarava, it gives a fine metallic ring when struck.
Here and there you come upon a bank of sand, exceeding fine and white,
and these parts are the least productive.  The plants (such as they are)
spring from and love the broken coral, whence they grow with that
wonderful verdancy that makes the beauty of the atoll from the sea.  The
coco-palm in particular luxuriates in that stern <u>solum</u>, striking down
his roots to the brackish, percolated water, and bearing his green head
in the wind with every evidence of health and pleasure.  And yet even the
coco-palm must be helped in infancy with some extraneous nutriment, and
through much of the low archipelago there is planted with each nut a
piece of ship’s biscuit and a rusty nail.  The pandanus comes next in
importance, being also a food tree; and he, too, does bravely.  A green
bush called <u>miki</u> runs everywhere; occasionally a purao is seen; and
there are several useless weeds.  According to M. Cuzent, the whole
number of plants on an atoll such as Fakarava will scarce exceed, even if
it reaches to, one score.  Not a blade of grass appears; not a grain of
humus, save when a sack or two has been imported to make the semblance of
a garden; such gardens as bloom in cities on the window-sill.  Insect
life is sometimes dense; a cloud o’ mosquitoes, and, what is far worse, a
plague of flies blackening our food, has sometimes driven us from a meal
on Apemama; and even in Fakarava the mosquitoes were a pest.  The land
crab may be seen scuttling to his hole, and at night the rats besiege the
houses and the artificial gardens.  The crab is good eating; possibly so
is the rat; I have not tried.  Pandanus fruit is made, in the Gilberts,
into an agreeable sweetmeat, such as a man may trifle with at the end of
a long dinner; for a substantial meal I have no use for it.  The rest of
the food-supply, in a destitute atoll such as Fakarava, can be summed up
in the favourite jest of the archipelago—cocoa-nut beefsteak.  Cocoa-nut
green, cocoa-nut ripe, cocoa-nut germinated; cocoa-nut to eat and
cocoa-nut to drink; cocoa-nut raw and cooked, cocoa-nut hot and cold—such
is the bill of fare.  And some of the entrées are no doubt delicious.
The germinated nut, cooked in the shell and eaten with a spoon, forms a
good pudding; cocoa-nut milk—the expressed juice of a ripe nut, not the
water of a green one—goes well in coffee, and is a valuable adjunct in
cookery through the South Seas; and cocoa-nut salad, if you be a
millionaire, and can afford to eat the value of a field of corn for your
dessert, is a dish to be remembered with affection.  But when all is done
there is a sameness, and the Israelites of the low islands murmur at
their manna.
</p><p>The reader may think I have forgot the sea.  The two beaches do certainly
abound in life, and they are strangely different.  In the lagoon the
water shallows slowly on a bottom of the fine slimy sand, dotted with
clumps of growing coral.  Then comes a strip of tidal beach on which the
ripples lap.  In the coral clumps the great holy-water clam (<u>Tridacna</u>)
grows plentifully; a little deeper lie the beds of the pearl-oyster and
sail the resplendent fish that charmed us at our entrance; and these are
all more or less vigorously coloured.  But the other shells are white
like lime, or faintly tinted with a little pink, the palest possible
display; many of them dead besides, and badly rolled.  On the ocean side,
on the mounds of the steep beach, over all the width of the reef right
out to where the surf is bursting, in every cranny, under every scattered
fragment of the coral, an incredible plenty of marine life displays the
most wonderful variety and brilliancy of hues.  The reef itself has no
passage of colour but is imitated by some shell.  Purple and red and
white, and green and yellow, pied and striped and clouded, the living
shells wear in every combination the livery of the dead reef—if the reef
be dead—so that the eye is continually baffled and the collector
continually deceived.  I have taken shells for stones and stones for
shells, the one as often as the other.  A prevailing character of the
coral is to be dotted with small spots of red, and it is wonderful how
many varieties of shell have adopted the same fashion and donned the
disguise of the red spot.  A shell I had found in plenty in the Marquesas
I found here also unchanged in all things else, but there were the red
spots.  A lively little crab wore the same markings.  The case of the
hermit or soldier crab was more conclusive, being the result of conscious
choice.  This nasty little wrecker, scavenger, and squatter has learned
the value of a spotted house; so it be of the right colour he will choose
the smallest shard, tuck himself in a mere corner of a broken whorl, and
go about the world half naked; but I never found him in this imperfect
armour unless it was marked with the red spot.
</p><p>Some two hundred yards distant is the beach of the lagoon.  Collect the
shells from each, set them side by side, and you would suppose they came
from different hemispheres; the one so pale, the other so brilliant; the
one prevalently white, the other of a score of hues, and infected with
the scarlet spot like a disease.  This seems the more strange, since the
hermit crabs pass and repass the island, and I have met them by the
Residency well, which is about central, journeying either way.  Without
doubt many of the shells in the lagoon are dead.  But why are they dead?
Without doubt the living shells have a very different background set for
imitation.  But why are these so different?  We are only on the threshold
of the mysteries.
</p><p>Either beach, I have said, abounds with life.  On the sea-side and in
certain atolls this profusion of vitality is even shocking: the rock
under foot is mined with it.  I have broken off—notably in Funafuti and
Arorai {156}—great lumps of ancient weathered rock that rang under my
blows like iron, and the fracture has been full of pendent worms as long
as my hand, as thick as a child’s finger, of a slightly pinkish white,
and set as close as three or even four to the square inch.  Even in the
lagoon, where certain shell-fish seem to sicken, others (it is notorious)
prosper exceedingly and make the riches of these islands.  Fish, too,
abound; the lagoon is a closed fish-pond, such as might rejoice the fancy
of an abbot; sharks swarm there, and chiefly round the passages, to feast
upon this plenty, and you would suppose that man had only to prepare his
angle.  Alas! it is not so.  Of these painted fish that came in hordes
about the entering <u>Casco</u>, some bore poisonous spines, and others were
poisonous if eaten.  The stranger must refrain, or take his chance of
painful and dangerous sickness.  The native, on his own isle, is a safe
guide; transplant him to the next, and he is helpless as yourself.  For
it is a question both of time and place.  A fish caught in a lagoon may
be deadly; the same fish caught the same day at sea, and only a few
hundred yards without the passage, will be wholesome eating: in a
neighbouring isle perhaps the case will be reversed; and perhaps a
fortnight later you shall be able to eat of them indifferently from
within and from without.  According to the natives, these bewildering
vicissitudes are ruled by the movement of the heavenly bodies.  The
beautiful planet Venus plays a great part in all island tales and
customs; and among other functions, some of them more awful, she
regulates the season of good fish.  With Venus in one phase, as we had
her, certain fish were poisonous in the lagoon: with Venus in another,
the same fish was harmless and a valued article of diet.  White men
explain these changes by the phases of the coral.
</p><p>It adds a last touch of horror to the thought of this precarious annular
gangway in the sea, that even what there is of it is not of honest rock,
but organic, part alive, part putrescent; even the clean sea and the
bright fish about it poisoned, the most stubborn boulder burrowed in by
worms, the lightest dust venomous as an apothecary’s drugs.
