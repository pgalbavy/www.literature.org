</p><p><strong>LATEST NEWS</strong>
</p><p><strong>DOCTOR DELATTRE KIDNAPPED A MAD PIECE OF CRIMINAL DARING</strong>
</p><p>At the moment of going to press, we have received an item of news which
we dare not guarantee as authentic, because of its very improbable
character. We print it, therefore, with all reserve.
</p><p>Yesterday evening, Dr. Delattre, the well-known surgeon, was present,
with his wife and daughter, at the performance of Hernani at the
Comedie Francaise. At the commencement of the third act, that is to
say, at about ten o'clock, the door of his box opened and a gentleman,
accompanied by two others, leaned over to the doctor and said to him,
in a low voice, but loud enough for Mme. Delattre to hear:
</p><p>"Doctor, I have a very painful task to fulfil and I shall be very
grateful to you if you will make it as easy for me as you can."
</p><p>"Who are you, sir?"
</p><p>"M. Thezard, commissary of police of the first district; and my
instructions are to take you to M. Dudouis, at the prefecture."
</p><p>"But--"
</p><p>"Not a word, doctor, I entreat you, not a movement--There is some
regrettable mistake; and that is why we must act in silence and not
attract anybody's attention. You will be back, I have no doubt, before
the end of the performance."
</p><p>The doctor rose and went with the commissary. At the end of the
performance, he had not returned. Mme. Delattre, greatly alarmed, drove
to the office of the commissary of police. There she found the real M.
Thezard and discovered, to her great terror, that the individual who
had carried off her husband was an impostor.
</p><p>Inquiries made so far have revealed the fact that the doctor stepped
into a motor car and that the car drove off in the direction of the
Concorde.
</p><p>Readers will find further details of this incredible adventure in our
second edition.
</p><hr/>
<p>Incredible though it might be, the adventure was perfectly true.
Besides, the issue was not long delayed and the Grand Journal, while
confirming the story in its midday edition, described in a few lines
the dramatic ending with which it concluded:
</p><p><strong>THE STORY ENDS</strong>
</p><p><strong>AND</strong>
</p><p><strong>GUESS-WORK BEGINS</strong>
</p><p>Dr. Delattre was brought back to 78, Rue Duret, at nine o'clock this
morning, in a motor car which drove away immediately at full speed.
</p><p>No. 78, Rue Duret, is the address of Dr. Delattre's clinical surgery,
at which he arrives every morning at the same hour. When we sent in our
card, the doctor, though closeted with the chief of the detective
service, was good enough to consent to receive us.
</p><p>"All that I can tell you," he said, in reply to our questions, "is that
I was treated with the greatest consideration. My three companions were
the most charming people I have ever met, exquisitely well-mannered and
bright and witty talkers: a quality not to be despised, in view of the
length of the journey."
</p><p>"How long did it take?"
</p><p>"About four hours and as long returning."
</p><p>"And what was the object of the journey?"
</p><p>"I was taken to see a patient whose condition rendered an immediate
operation necessary."
</p><p>"And was the operation successful?"
</p><p>"Yes, but the consequences may be dangerous. I would answer for the
patient here. Down there--under his present conditions--"
</p><p>"Bad conditions?"
</p><p>"Execrable!--A room in an inn--and the practically absolute
impossibility of being attended to."
</p><p>"Then what can save him?"
</p><p>"A miracle--and his constitution, which is an exceptionally strong one."
</p><p>"And can you say nothing more about this strange patient?"
</p><p>"No. In the first place, I have taken an oath; and, secondly, I have
received a present of ten thousand francs for my free surgery. If I do
not keep silence, this sum will be taken from me."
</p><p>"You are joking! Do you believe that?"
</p><p>"Indeed I do. The men all struck me as being very much in earnest."
</p><p>This is the statement made to us by Dr. Delattre. And we know, on the
other hand, that the head of the detective service, in spite of all his
insisting, has not yet succeeded in extracting any more precise
particulars from him as to the operation which he performed, the
patient whom he attended or the district traversed by the car. It is
difficult, therefore, to arrive at the truth.
</p><hr/>
<p>This truth, which the writer of the interview confessed himself unable
to discover, was guessed by the more or less clear-sighted minds that
perceived a connection with the facts which had occurred the day before
at the Chateau d'Ambrumesy, and which were reported, down to the
smallest detail, in all the newspapers of that day. There was evidently
a coincidence to be reckoned with in the disappearance of a wounded
burglar and the kidnapping of a famous surgeon.
</p><p>The judicial inquiry, moreover, proved the correctness of the
hypothesis. By following the track of the sham flyman, who had fled on
a bicycle, they were able to show that he had reached the forest of
Arques, at some ten miles' distance, and that from there, after
throwing his bicycle into a ditch, he had gone to the village of
Saint-Nicolas, whence he had dispatched the following telegram:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>L. N., Post-office 45, Paris.</li></ol>
<p>  Situation desperate. Operation urgently necessary.
  Send celebrity by national road fourteen.
</p>
<p>The evidence was undeniable. Once apprised the accomplices in Paris
hastened to make their arrangements. At ten o'clock in the evening they
sent their celebrity by National Road No. 14, which skirts the forest
of Arques and ends at Dieppe. During this time, under cover of the fire
which they themselves had caused, the gang of burglars carried off
their leader and moved him to an inn, where the operation took place on
the arrival of the surgeon, at two o'clock in the morning.
</p><p>About that there was no doubt. At Pontoise, at Gournay, at Forges,
Chief-inspector Ganimard, who was sent specially from Paris, with
Inspector Folenfant, as his assistant, ascertained that a motor car had
passed in the course of the previous night. The same on the road from
Dieppe to Ambrumesy. And, though the traces of the car were lost at
about a mile and a half from the chateau, at least a number of
footmarks were seen between the little door in the park wall and the
abbey ruins. Besides, Ganimard remarked that the lock of the little
door had been forced.
</p><p>So all was explained. It remained to decide which inn the doctor had
spoken of: an easy piece of work for a Ganimard, a professional ferret,
a patient old stager of the police. The number of inns is limited and
this one, given the condition of the wounded man, could only be one
quite close to Ambrumesy. Ganimard and Sergeant Quevillon set to work.
Within a circle of five hundred yards, of a thousand yards, of fifteen
hundred yards, they visited and ransacked everything that could pass
for an inn. But, against all expectation, the dying man persisted in
remaining invisible.
</p><p>Ganimard became more resolved than ever. He came back to sleep at the
chateau, on the Saturday night, with the intention of making his
personal inquiry on the Sunday. On Sunday morning, he learned that,
during the night, a posse of gendarmes had seen a figure gliding along
the sunk road, outside the wall. Was it an accomplice who had come back
to investigate? Were they to suppose that the leader of the gang had
not left the cloisters or the neighborhood of the cloisters?
</p><p>That night, Ganimard openly sent the squad of gendarmes to the farm and
posted himself and Folenfant outside the walls, near the little door.
</p><p>A little before midnight, a person passed out of the wood, slipped
between them, went through the door and entered the park. For three
hours, they saw him wander from side to side across the ruins,
stooping, climbing up the old pillars, sometimes remaining for long
minutes without moving. Then he went back to the door and again passed
between the two inspectors.
</p><p>Ganimard caught him by the collar, while Folenfant seized him round the
body. He made no resistance of any kind and, with the greatest
docility, allowed them to bind his wrists and take him to the house.
But, when they attempted to question him, he replied simply that he
owed them no account of his doings and that he would wait for the
arrival of the examining magistrate. Thereupon, they fastened him
firmly to the foot of a bed, in one of the two adjoining rooms which
they occupied.
</p><p>At nine o'clock on Monday morning, as soon as M. Filleul had arrived,
Ganimard announced the capture which he had made. The prisoner was
brought downstairs. It was Isidore Beautrelet.
</p><p>"M. Isidore Beautrelet!" exclaimed M. Filleul with an air of rapture,
holding out both his hands to the newcomer. "What a delightful
surprise! Our excellent amateur detective here! And at our disposal
too! Why, it's a windfall!--M. Chief-inspector, allow me to introduce
to you M. Isidore Beautrelet, a sixth-form pupil at the Lycee
Janson-de-Sailly."
</p><p>Ganimard seemed a little nonplussed. Isidore made him a very low bow,
as though he were greeting a colleague whom he knew how to esteem at
his true value, and, turning to M. Filleul:
</p><p>"It appears, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, that you have received a
satisfactory account of me?"
</p><p>"Perfectly satisfactory! To begin with, you were really at
Veules-les-Roses at the time when Mlle. de Saint-Veran thought she saw
you in the sunk road. I dare say we shall discover the identity of your
double. In the second place, you are in very deed Isidore Beautrelet, a
sixth-form pupil and, what is more, an excellent pupil, industrious at
your work and of exemplary behavior. As your father lives in the
country, you go out once a month to his correspondent, M. Bernod, who
is lavish in his praises of you."
</p><p>"So that--"
</p><p>"So that you are free, M. Isidore Beautrelet."
</p><p>"Absolutely free?"
</p><p>"Absolutely. Oh, I must make just one little condition, all the same.
You can understand that I can't release a gentleman who administers
sleeping-draughts, who escapes by the window and who is afterward
caught in the act of trespassing upon private property. I can't release
him without a compensation of some kind."
</p><p>"I await your pleasure."
</p><p>"Well, we will resume our interrupted conversation and you shall tell
me how far you have advanced with your investigations. In two days of
liberty, you must have carried them pretty far?" And, as Ganimard was
preparing to go, with an affectation of contempt for that sort of
practice, the magistrate cried, "Not at all, M. Inspector, your place
is here--I assure you that M. Isidore Beautrelet is worth listening to.
M. Isidore Beautrelet, according to my information, has made a great
reputation at the Lycee Janson-de-Sailly as an observer whom nothing
escapes; and his schoolfellows, I hear, look upon him as your
competitor and a rival of Holmlock Shears!"
</p><p>"Indeed!" said Ganimard, ironically.
</p><p>"Just so. One of them wrote to me, 'If Beautrelet declares that he
knows, you must believe him; and, whatever he says, you may be sure
that it is the exact expression of the truth.' M. Isidore Beautrelet,
now or never is the time to vindicate the confidence of your friends. I
beseech you, give us the exact expression of the truth."
</p><p>Isidore listened with a smile and replied:
</p><p>"Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, you are very cruel. You make fun of
poor schoolboys who amuse themselves as best they can. You are quite
right, however, and I will give you no further reason to laugh at me."
</p><p>"The fact is that you know nothing, M. Isidore Beautrelet."
</p><p>"Yes, I confess in all humility that I know nothing. For I do not call
it 'knowing anything' that I happen to have hit upon two or three more
precise points which, I am sure, cannot have escaped you."
</p><p>"For instance?"
</p><p>"For instance, the object of the theft."
</p><p>"Ah, of course, you know the object of the theft?"
</p><p>"As you do, I have no doubt. In fact, it was the first thing I studied,
because the task struck me as easier."
</p><p>"Easier, really?"
</p><p>"Why, of course. At the most, it's a question of reasoning."
</p><p>"Nothing more than that?"
</p><p>"Nothing more."
</p><p>"And what is your reasoning?"
</p><p>"It is just this, stripped of all extraneous comment: on the one hand,
THERE HAS BEEN A THEFT, because the two young ladies are agreed and
because they really saw two men running away and carrying things with
them."
</p><p>"There has been a theft."
</p><p>"On the other hand, NOTHING HAS DISAPPEARED, because M. de Gesvres says
so and he is in a better position than anybody to know."
</p><p>"Nothing has disappeared."
</p><p>"From those two premises I arrive at this inevitable result: granted
that there has been a theft and that nothing has disappeared, it is
because the object carried off has been replaced by an exactly similar
object. Let me hasten to add that possibly my argument may not be
confirmed by the facts. But I maintain that it is the first argument
that ought to occur to us and that we are not entitled to waive it
until we have made a serious examination."
</p><p>"That's true--that's true," muttered the magistrate, who was obviously
interested.
</p><p>"Now," continued Isidore, "what was there in this room that could
arouse the covetousness of the burglars? Two things. The tapestry
first. It can't have been that. Old tapestry cannot be imitated: the
fraud would have been palpable at once. There remain the four Rubens
pictures."
</p><p>"What's that you say?"
</p><p>"I say that the four Rubenses on that wall are false."
</p><p>"Impossible!"
</p><p>"They are false a priori, inevitably and without a doubt."
</p><p>"I tell you, it's impossible."
</p><p>"It is very nearly a year ago, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, since a
young man, who gave his name as Charpenais, came to the Chateau
d'Ambrumesy and asked permission to copy the Rubens pictures. M. de
Gesvres gave him permission. Every day for five months Charpenais
worked in this room from morning till dusk. The copies which he made,
canvases and frames, have taken the place of the four original pictures
bequeathed to M. de Gesvres by his uncle, the Marques de Bobadilla."
</p><p>"Prove it!"
</p><p>"I have no proof to give. A picture is false because it is false; and I
consider that it is not even necessary to examine these four."
</p><p>M. Filleul and Ganimard exchanged glances of unconcealed astonishment.
The inspector no longer thought of withdrawing. At last, the magistrate
muttered:
</p><p>"We must have M. de Gesvres's opinion."
</p><p>And Ganimard agreed:
</p><p>"Yes, we must have his opinion."
</p><p>And they sent to beg the count to come to the drawing room.
</p><p>The young sixth-form pupil had won a real victory. To compel two
experts, two professionals like M. Filleul and Ganimard to take account
of his surmises implied a testimony of respect of which any other would
have been proud. But Beautrelet seemed not to feel those little
satisfactions of self-conceit and, still smiling without the least
trace of irony, he placidly waited.
</p><p>M. de Gesvres entered the room.
</p><p>"Monsieur le Comte," said the magistrate, "the result of our inquiry
has brought us face to face with an utterly unexpected contingency,
which we submit to you with all reserve. It is possible--I say that it
is possible--that the burglars, when breaking into the house, had it as
their object to steal your four pictures by Rubens--or, at least, to
replace them by four copies--copies which are said to have been made
last year by a painter called Charpenais. Would you be so good as to
examine the pictures and to tell us if you recognize them as genuine?"
</p><p>The count appeared to suppress a movement of annoyance, looked at
Isidore Beautrelet and at M. Filleul and replied, without even
troubling to go near the pictures:
</p><p>"I hoped, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, that the truth might have
remained unknown. As this is not so, I have no hesitation in declaring
that the four pictures are false."
</p><p>"You knew it, then?"
</p><p>"From the beginning."
</p><p>"Why didn't you say so?"
</p><p>"The owner of a work is never in a hurry to declare that that work is
not--or, rather, is no longer genuine."
</p><p>"Still, it was the only means of recovering them."
</p><p>"I consider that there was another and a better."
</p><p>"Which was that?"
</p><p>"Not to make the secret known, not to frighten my burglars and to offer
to buy back the pictures, which they must find more or less difficult
to dispose of."
</p><p>"How would you communicate with them?"
</p><p>As the count did not reply, Isidore answered for him:
</p><p>"By means of an advertisement in the papers. The paragraph inserted in
the agony column of the Journal, the Echo de Paris and the Matin runs,
'Am prepared to buy back the pictures.'"
</p><p>The count agreed with a nod. Once again, the young man was teaching his
elders. M. Filleul showed himself a good sportsman.
</p><p>"There's no doubt about it, my dear sir," he exclaimed. "I'm beginning
to think your school-fellows were not quite wrong. By Jove, what an
eye! What intuition! If this goes on, there will be nothing left for M.
Ganimard and me to do."
</p><p>"Oh, none of this part was so very complicated!"
</p><p>"You mean to say that the rest was more so I remember, in fact, that,
when we first met you seemed to know all about it. Let me see, a far as
I recollect, you said that you knew the name of the murderer."
</p><p>"So I do."
</p><p>"Well, then, who killed Jean Daval? Is the man alive? Where is he
hiding?"
</p><p>"There is a misunderstanding between us, Monsieur le Juge
d'Instruction, or, rather, you have misunderstood the facts from the
beginning The murderer and the runaway are two distinct persons."
</p><p>"What's that?" exclaimed M. Filleul. "The man whom M. de Gesvres saw in
the boudoir and struggled with, the man whom the young ladies saw in
the drawing-room and whom Mlle. de Saint-Veran shot at, the man who
fell in the park and whom we are looking for: do you suggest that he is
not the man who killed Jean Daval?"
</p><p>"I do."
</p><p>"Have you discovered the traces of a third accomplice who disappeared
before the arrival of the young ladies?"
</p><p>"I have not."
</p><p>"In that case, I don't understand.--Well, who is the murderer of Jean
Daval?"
</p><p>"Jean Daval was killed by--"
</p><p>Beautrelet interrupted himself, thought for a moment and continued:
</p><p>"But I must first show you the road which I followed to arrive at the
certainty and the very reasons of the murder--without which my
accusation would seem monstrous to you.--And it is not--no, it is not
monstrous at all.--There is one detail which has passed unobserved and
which, nevertheless, is of the greatest importance; and that is that
Jean Daval, at the moment when he was stabbed, had all his clothes on,
including his walking boots, was dressed, in short, as a man is dressed
in the middle of the day, with a waistcoat, collar, tie and braces. Now
the crime was committed at four o'clock in the morning."
</p><p>"I reflected on that strange fact," said the magistrate, "and M. de
Gesvres replied that Jean Daval spent a part of his nights in working."
</p><p>"The servants say, on the contrary, that he went to bed regularly at a
very early hour. But, admitting that he was up, why did he disarrange
his bedclothes, to make believe that he had gone to bed? And, if he was
in bed, why, when he heard a noise, did he take the trouble to dress
himself from head to foot, instead of slipping on anything that came to
hand? I went to his room on the first day, while you were at lunch: his
slippers were at the foot of the bed. What prevented him from putting
them on rather than his heavy nailed boots?"
</p><p>"So far, I do not see--"
</p><p>"So far, in fact, you cannot see anything, except anomalies. They
appeared much more suspicious to me, however, when I learned that
Charpenais the painter, the man who copied the Rubens pictures, had
been introduced and recommended to the Comte de Gesvres by Jean Daval
himself."
</p><p>"Well?"
</p><p>"Well, from that to the conclusion that Jean Daval and Charpenais were
accomplices required but a step. I took that step at the time of our
conversation."
</p><p>"A little quickly, I think."
</p><p>"As a matter of fact, a material proof was wanted. Now I had discovered
in Daval's room, on one of the sheets of the blotting-pad on which he
used to write, this address: 'Monsieur A.L.N., Post-office 45, Paris.'
You will find it there still, traced the reverse way on the
blotting-paper. The next day, it was discovered that the telegram sent
by the sham flyman from Saint-Nicolas bore the same address: 'A.L.N.,
Post-office 45.' The material proof existed: Jean Daval was in
correspondence with the gang which arranged the robbery of the
pictures."
</p><p>M. Filleul raised no objection.
</p><p>"Agreed. The complicity is established. And what conclusion do you
draw?"
</p><p>"This, first of all, that it was not the runaway who killed Jean Daval,
because Jean Daval was his accomplice."
</p><p>"And after that?"
</p><p>"Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, I will ask you to remember the first
sentence uttered by Monsieur le Comte when he recovered from fainting.
The sentence forms part of Mlle. de Gesvres' evidence and is in the
official report: 'I am not wounded.--Daval?--Is he alive?--The knife?'
And I will ask you to compare it with that part of his story, also in
the report, in which Monsieur le Comte describes the assault: 'The man
leaped at me and felled me with a blow on the temple!' How could M. de
Gesvres, who had fainted, know, on waking, that Daval had been stabbed
with a knife?"
</p><p>Isidore Beautrelet did not wait for an answer to his question. It
seemed as though he were in a hurry to give the answer himself and to
avoid all comment. He continued straightway:
</p><p>"Therefore it was Jean Daval who brought the three burglars to the
drawing room. While he was there with the one whom they call their
chief, a noise was heard in the boudoir. Daval opened the door.
Recognizing M. de Gesvres, he rushed at him, armed with the knife. M.
de Gesvres succeeded in snatching the knife from him, struck him with
it and himself fell, on receiving a blow from the man whom the two
girls were to see a few minutes after."
</p><p>Once again, M. Filleul and the inspector exchanged glances. Ganimard
tossed his head in a disconcerted way. The magistrate said:
</p><p>"Monsieur le Comte, am I to believe that this version is correct?"
</p><p>M. de Gesvres made no answer.
</p><p>"Come, Monsieur le Comte, your silence would allow us to suppose--I beg you
to speak."
</p><p>Replying in a very clear voice, M. de Gesvres said:
</p><p>"The version is correct in every particular."
</p><p>The magistrate gave a start.
</p><p>"Then I cannot understand why you misled the police. Why conceal an act
which you were lawfully entitled to commit in defense of your life?"
</p><p>"For twenty years," said M. de Gesvres, "Daval worked by my side. I
trusted him. If he betrayed me, as the result of some temptation or
other, I was, at least, unwilling, for the sake of the past, that his
treachery should become known."
</p><p>"You were unwilling, I agree, but you had no right to be."
</p><p>"I am not of your opinion, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction. As long as
no innocent person was accused of the crime, I was absolutely entitled
to refrain from accusing the man who was at the same time the culprit
and the victim. He is dead. I consider death a sufficient punishment."
</p><p>"But now, Monsieur le Comte, now that the truth is known, you can
speak."
</p><p>"Yes. Here are two rough drafts of letters written by him to his
accomplices. I took them from his pocket-book, a few minutes after his
death."
</p><p>"And the motive of his theft?"
</p><p>"Go to 18, Rue de la Barre, at Dieppe, which is the address of a
certain Mme. Verdier. It was for this woman, whom he got to know two
years ago, and to supply her constant need of money that Daval turned
thief."
</p><p>So everything was cleared up. The tragedy rose out of the darkness and
gradually appeared in its true light.
</p><p>"Let us go on," said M. Filluel after the count had withdrawn.
</p><p>"Upon my word," said Beautrelet, gaily, "I have said almost all that I
had to say."
</p><p>"But the runaway, the wounded man?"
</p><p>"As to that, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, you know as much as I do.
You have followed his tracks in the grass by the cloisters--you have--"
</p><p>"Yes, yes, I know. But, since then, his friends have removed him and
what I want is a clue or two as regards that inn--"
</p><p>Isidore Beautrelet burst out laughing:
</p><p>"The inn! The inn does not exist! It's an invention, a trick to put the
police on the wrong scent, an ingenious trick, too, for it seems to
have succeeded."
</p><p>"But Dr. Delattre declares--"
</p><p>"Ah, that's just it!" cried Beautrelet, in a tone of conviction. "It is
just because Dr. Delattre declares that we mustn't believe him. Why,
Dr. Delattre refused to give any but the vaguest details concerning his
adventure! He refused to say anything that might compromise his
patient's safety!--And suddenly he calls attention to an inn!--You may
be sure that he talked about that inn because he was told to. You may
be sure that the whole story which he dished up to us was dictated to
him under the threat of terrible reprisals. The doctor has a wife. The
doctor has a daughter. He is too fond of them to disobey people of
whose formidable power he has seen proofs. And that is why he has
assisted your efforts by supplying the most precise clues."
</p><p>"So precise that the inn is nowhere to be found."
</p><p>"So precise that you have never ceased looking for it, in the face of
all probability, and that your eyes have been turned away from the only
spot where the man can be, the mysterious spot which he has not left,
which he has been unable to leave ever since the moment when, wounded
by Mlle. de Saint-Veran, he succeeded in dragging himself to it, like a
beast to its lair."
</p><p>"But where, confound it all?--In what corner of Hades--?"
</p><p>"In the ruins of the old abbey."
</p><p>"But there are no ruins left!--A few bits of wall!--A few broken
columns!"
</p><p>"That's where he's gone to earth. Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction!"
shouted Beautrelet. "That's where you will have to look for him! It's
there and nowhere else that you will find Arsene Lupin!"
</p><p>"Arsene Lupin!" yelled M. Filleul, springing to his feet.
</p><p>There was a rather solemn pause, amid which the syllables of the famous
name seemed to prolong their sound. Was it possible that the vanquished
and yet invisible adversary, whom they had been hunting in vain for
several days, could really be Arsene Lupin? Arsene Lupin, caught in a
trap, arrested, meant immediate promotion, fortune, glory to any
examining magistrate!
</p><p>Ganimard had not moved a limb. Isidore said to him:
</p><p>"You agree with me, do you not, M. Inspector?"
</p><p>"Of course I do!"
</p><p>"You have not doubted either, for a moment have you, that he managed
this business?"
</p><p>"Not for a second! The thing bears his signature. A move of Arsene
Lupin's is as different from a move made by another man as one face is
from another. You have only to open your eyes."
</p><p>"Do you think so? Do you think so?" said M. Filleul.
</p><p>"Think so!" cried the young man. "Look, here's one little fact: what
are the initials under which those men correspond among themselves? 'A.
L. N.,' that is to say, the first letter of the name Arsene and the
first and last letters of the name Lupin."
</p><p>"Ah," said Ganimard, "nothing escapes you! Upon my word, you're a fine
fellow and old Ganimard lays down his arms before you!"
</p><p>Beautrelet flushed with pleasure and pressed the hand which the
chief-inspector held out to him. The three men had drawn near the
balcony and their eyes now took in the extent of the ruins. M. Filleul
muttered:
</p><p>"So he ought to be there."
</p><p>"HE IS THERE," said Beautrelet, in a hollow voice. "He has been there
ever since the moment when he fell. Logically and practically, he could
not escape without being seen by Mlle. de Saint-Veran and the two
servants."
</p><p>"What proof have you?"
</p><p>"His accomplices have furnished the proof. On the very morning, one of
them disguised himself as a flyman and drove you here--"
</p><p>"To recover the cap, which would serve to identify him."
</p><p>"Very well, but also and more particularly to examine the spot, find
out and see for himself what had become of the 'governor.'"
</p><p>"And did he find out?"
</p><p>"I presume so, as he knew the hiding-place. And I presume that he
became aware of the desperate condition of his chief, because, under
the impulse of his alarm, he committed the imprudence to write that
threat: 'Woe betide the young lady, if she has killed the governor!'"
</p><p>"But his friends were able to take him away afterward?"
</p><p>"When? Your men have never left the ruins. And where could they have
moved him to? At most, a few hundred yards away, for one doesn't let a
dying man travel--and then you would have found him. No, I tell you, he
is there. His friends would never have removed him from the safest of
hiding-places. It was there that they brought the doctor, while the
gendarmes were running to the fire like children."
</p><p>"But how is he living? How will he keep alive? To keep alive you need
food and drink."
</p><p>"I can't say. I don't know. But he is there, I will swear it. He is
there, because he can't help being there. I am as sure of it as if I
saw as if I touched him. He is there."
</p><p>With his finger outstretched toward the ruins, he traced in the air a
little circle which became smaller and smaller until it was only a
point. And that point his two companions sought desperately, both
leaning into space, both moved by the same faith in Beautrelet and
quivering with the ardent conviction which he had forced upon them.
Yes, Arsene Lupin was there. In theory and in fact, he was there:
neither of them was now able to doubt it.
</p><p>And there was something impressive and tragic in knowing that the
famous adventurer was lying in some dark shelter, below the ground,
helpless, feverish and exhausted.
</p><p>"And if he dies?" asked M. Filleul, in a low voice.
</p><p>"If he dies," said Beautrelet, "and if his accomplices are sure of it,
then see to the safety of Mlle. de Saint-Veran. Monsieur le Juge
d'Instruction, for the vengeance will be terrible."
</p><hr/>
<p>A few minutes later and in spite of the entreaties of M. Filleul, who
would gladly have made further use of this fascinating auxiliary,
Isidore Beautrelet, whose holidays ended that day, went off by the
Dieppe Road. He stepped from the train in Paris at five o'clock and, at
eight o'clock, returned to the Lycee Janson together with his
schoolfellows.
</p><p>Ganimard, after a minute, but utterly useless exploration of the ruins
of Ambrumesy, returned to Paris by the fast night-train. On reaching
his apartment in the Rue Pergolese, he found an express letter awaiting
him:
</p><hr/>
<p>Monsieur l'Inspecteur Principal:
</p><p>Finding that I had a little time to spare at the end of the day, I have
succeeded in collecting a few additional particulars which are sure to
interest you.
</p><p>Arsene Lupin has been living in Paris for twelve months under the name
of Etienne de Vaudreix. It is a name which you will often come across
in the society notes or the sporting columns of the newspapers. He is a
great traveler and is absent for long periods, during which, by his own
account, he goes hunting tigers in Bengal or blue foxes in Siberia. He
is supposed to be in business of some kind, although nobody is able to
say for certain what his business is.
</p><p>His present address is 38, Rue Marbeuf; and I will call your attention
to the fact that the Rue Marbeuf is close to Post-office Number 45.
Since Thursday the twenty-third of April, the day before the burglary
at Ambrumesy, there has been no news at all of Etienne de Vaudreix.
</p><p>With very many thanks for the kindness which you have shown me, believe
me to be,
</p><p>   Monsieur l'Inspecteur Principal,
</p><pre>
       Yours sincerely,
         ISIDORE BEAUTRELET.</pre>
<p>P.S.--Please on no account think that it cost me any great trouble to
obtain this information. On the very morning of the crime, while M.
Filleul was pursuing his examination before a few privileged persons, I
had the fortunate inspiration to glance at the runaway's cap, before
the sham flyman came to change it. The hatter's name was enough, as you
may imagine, to enable me to find the clue that led to the
identification of the purchaser and his address.
</p><hr/>
<p>The next morning, Ganimard called at 36, Rue Marbeuf. After questioning
the concierge, he made him open the door of the ground-floor flat on
the right, a very comfortable apartment, elegantly furnished, in which,
however, he discovered nothing beyond some cinders in the fireplace.
Two friends had come, four days earlier, to burn all compromising
papers.
</p><p>But, just as he was leaving, Ganimard passed the postman, who was
bringing a letter for M. de Vaudreix. That afternoon, the public
prosecutor was informed of the case and ordered the letter to be given
up. It bore an American postmark and contained the following lines, in
English:
</p><hr/>
<p><strong>DEAR SIR:</strong>
</p><p>I write to confirm the answer which I gave your representative. As soon
as you have M. de Gesvres's four pictures in your possession, you can
forward them as arranged.
</p><p>You may add the rest, if you are able to succeed, which I doubt.
</p><p>An unexpected business requires my presence in Europe and I shall reach
Paris at the same time as this letter. You will find me at the Grand
Hotel.
</p><p>Yours faithfully,
</p><p><strong>EPHRAIM B. HARLINGTON.</strong>
</p><hr/>
<p>That same day, Ganimard applied for a warrant and took Mr. E. B.
Harlington, an American citizen, to the police-station, on a charge of
receiving and conspiracy.
</p><hr/>
<p>Thus, within the space of twenty-four hours, all the threads of the
plot had been unraveled, thanks to the really unforeseen clues supplied
by a schoolboy of seventeen. In twenty-four hours, what had seemed
inexplicable became simple and clear. In twenty-four hours, the scheme
devised by the accomplices to save their leader was baffled; the
capture of Arsene Lupin, wounded and dying, was no longer in doubt, his
gang was disorganized, the address of his establishment in Paris and
the name which he assumed were known and, for the first time, one of
his cleverest and most carefully elaborated feats was seen through
before he had been able to ensure its complete execution.
</p><p>An immense clamor of astonishment, admiration and curiosity arose among
the public. Already, the Rouen journalist, in a very able article, had
described the first examination of the sixth-form pupil, laying stress
upon his personal charm, his simplicity of manner and his quiet
assurance. The indiscretions of Ganimard and M. Filleul, indiscretions
to which they yielded in spite of themselves, under an impulse that
proved stronger than their professional pride, suddenly enlightened the
public as to the part played by Isidore Beautrelet in recent events. He
alone had done everything. To him alone the merit of the victory was
due.
</p><p>The excitement was intense. Isidore Beautrelet awoke to find himself a
hero; and the crowd, suddenly infatuated, insisted upon the fullest
information regarding its new favorite. The reporters were there to
supply it. They rushed to the assault of the Lycee Janson-de-Sailly,
waited for the day-boarders to come out after schoolhours and picked up
all that related, however remotely, to Beautrelet. It was in this way
that they learned the reputation which he enjoyed among his
schoolfellows, who called him the rival of Holmlock Shears. Thanks to
his powers of logical reasoning, with no further data than those which
he was able to gather from the papers, he had, time after time,
proclaimed the solution of very complicated cases long before they were
cleared up by the police.
</p><p>It had become a game at the Lycee Janson to put difficult questions and
intricate problems to Beautrelet; and it was astonishing to see with
what unhesitating and analytical power and by means of what ingenious
deductions he made his way through the thickest darkness. Ten days
before the arrest of Jorisse, the grocer, he showed what could be done
with the famous umbrella. In the same way, he declared from the
beginning, in the matter of the Saint-Cloud mystery, that the concierge
was the only possible murderer.
</p><p>But most curious of all was the pamphlet which was found circulating
among the boys at the school, a typewritten pamphlet signed by
Beautrelet and manifolded to the number of ten copies. It was entitled,
<strong>ARSENE LUPIN AND HIS METHOD, SHOWING IN HOW FAR THE LATTER IS BASED</strong>
<strong>UPON TRADITION AND IN HOW FAR ORIGINAL. FOLLOWED BY A COMPARISON</strong>
<strong>BETWEEN ENGLISH HUMOR AND FRENCH IRONY.</strong>
</p><p>It contained a profound study of each of the exploits of Arsene Lupin,
throwing the illustrious burglar's operations into extraordinary
relief, showing the very mechanism of his way of setting to work, his
special tactics, his letters to the press, his threats, the
announcement of his thefts, in short, the whole bag of tricks which he
employed to bamboozle his selected victim and throw him into such a
state of mind that the victim almost offered himself to the plot
contrived against him and that everything took place, as it were, with
his own consent.
</p><p>And the work was so just, regarded as a piece of criticism, so
penetrating, so lively and marked by a wit so clever and, at the same
time, so cruel that the lawyers at once passed over to his side, that
the sympathy of the crowd was summarily transferred from Lupin to
Beautrelet and that, in the struggle engaged upon between the two, the
schoolboy's victory was loudly proclaimed in advance.
</p><p>Be this as it may, both M. Filleul and the Paris public prosecutor
seemed jealously to reserve the possibility of this victory for him. On
the one hand, they failed to establish Mr. Harlington's identity or to
furnish a definite proof of his connection with Lupin's gang.
Confederate or not, he preserved an obstinate silence. Nay, more, after
examining his handwriting, it was impossible to declare that he was the
author of the intercepted letter. A Mr. Harlington, carrying a small
portmanteau and a pocket-book stuffed with bank-notes, had taken up his
abode at the Grand Hotel: that was all that could be stated with
certainty.
</p><p>On the other hand, at Dieppe, M. Filleul lay down on the positions
which Beautrelet had won for him. He did not move a step forward.
Around the individual whom Mlle. de Saint-Veran had taken for
Beautrelet, on the eve of the crime, the same mystery reigned as
heretofore. The same obscurity also surrounded everything connected
with the removal of the four Rubens pictures. What had become of them?
And what road had been taken by the motor car in which they were
carried off during the night?
</p><p>Evidence of its passing was obtained at Luneray at Yerville, at Yvetot
and at Caudebec-en-Caux, where it must have crossed the Seine at
daybreak in the steam-ferry. But, when the matter came to be inquired
into more thoroughly, it was stated that the motor car was an uncovered
one and that it would have been impossible to pack four large pictures
into it unobserved by the ferryman.
</p><p>It was very probably the same car; but then the question cropped up
again: what had become of the four Rubenses?
</p><p>These were so many problems which M. Filleul unanswered. Every day, his
subordinates searched the quadrilateral of the ruins. Almost every day,
he came to direct the explorations. But between that and discovering
the refuge in which Lupin lay dying--if it were true that Beautrelet's
opinion was correct--there was a gulf fixed which the worthy magistrate
did not seem likely to cross.
</p><p>And so it was natural that they should turn once more to Isidore
Beautrelet, as he alone had succeeded in dispelling shadows which, in
his absence, gathered thicker and more impenetrable than ever. Why did
he not go on with the case? Seeing how far he had carried it, he
required but an effort to succeed.
</p><p>The question was put to him by a member of the staff of the Grand
Journal, who had obtained admission to the Lycee Janson by assuming the
name of Bernod, the friend of Beautrelet's father. And Isidore very
sensibly replied:
</p><p>"My dear sir, there are other things besides Lupin in this world, other
things besides stories about burglars and detectives. There is, for
instance, the thing which is known as taking one's degree. Now I am
going up for my examination in July. This is May. And I don't want to
be plucked. What would my worthy parent say?"
</p><p>"But what would he say if you delivered Arsene Lupin into the hands of
the police?"
</p><p>"Tut! There's a time for everything. In the next holidays--"
</p><p>"Whitsuntide?"
</p><p>"Yes--I shall go down on Saturday the sixth of June by the first train."
</p><p>"And, on the evening of that Saturday, Lupin will be taken."
</p><p>"Will you give me until the Sunday?" asked Beautrelet, laughing.
</p><p>"Why delay?" replied the journalist, quite seriously.
</p><p>This inexplicable confidence, born of yesterday and already so strong,
was felt with regard to the young man by one and all, even though, in
reality, events had justified it only up to a certain point. No matter,
people believed in him! Nothing seemed difficult to him. They expected
from him what they were entitled to expect at most from some phenomenon
of penetration and intuition, of experience and skill. That day of the
sixth of June was made to sprawl over all the papers. On the sixth of
June, Isidore Beautrelet would take the fast train to Dieppe: and Lupin
would be arrested on the same evening.
</p><p>"Unless he escapes between this and then," objected the last remaining
partisans of the adventurer.
</p><p>"Impossible! Every outlet is watched."
</p><p>"Unless he has succumbed to his wounds, then," said the partisans, who
would have preferred their hero's death to his capture.
</p><p>And the retort was immediate:
</p><p>"Nonsense! If Lupin were dead, his confederates would know it by now,
and Lupin would be revenged. Beautrelet said so!"
</p><hr/>
<p>And the sixth of June came. Half a dozen journalists were looking out
for Isidore at the Gare Saint-Lazare. Two of them wanted to accompany
him on his journey. He begged them to refrain.
</p><p>He started alone, therefore, in a compartment to himself. He was tired,
thanks to a series of nights devoted to study, and soon fell asleep. He
slept heavily. In his dreams, he had an impression that the train
stopped at different stations and that people got in and out. When he
awoke, within sight of Rouen, he was still alone. But, on the back of
the opposite seat, was a large sheet of paper, fastened with a pin to
the gray cloth. It bore these words:
</p><p>  "Every man should mind his own business. Do you mind yours.
  If not, you must take the consequences."
</p><p>"Capital!" he exclaimed, rubbing his hands with delight. "Things are
going badly in the adversary's camp. That threat is as stupid and
vulgar as the sham flyman's. What a style! One can see that it wasn't
composed by Lupin."
</p><p>The train threaded the tunnel that precedes the old Norman city. On
reaching the station, Isidore took a few turns on the platform to
stretch his legs. He was about to re-enter his compartment, when a cry
escaped him. As he passed the bookstall, he had read, in an
absent-minded way, the following lines on the front page of a special
edition of the Journal de Rouen; and their alarming sense suddenly
burst upon him:
</p><hr/>
<p><strong>STOP-PRESS NEWS</strong>
</p><p>We hear by telephone from Dieppe that the Chateau d'Ambrumesy was
broken into last night by criminals, who bound and gagged Mlle. de
Gesvres and carried off Mlle. de Saint-Veran. Traces of blood have been
seen at a distance of five hundred yards from the house and a scarf has
been found close by, which is also stained with blood. There is every
reason to fear that the poor young girl has been murdered.
</p><hr/>
<p>Isidore Beautrelet completed his journey to Dieppe without moving a
limb. Bent in two, with his elbows on his knees and his hands plastered
against his face, he sat thinking.
</p><p>At Dieppe, he took a fly. At the door of Ambrumesy, he met the
examining magistrate, who confirmed the horrible news.
</p><p>"You know nothing more?" asked Beautrelet.
</p><p>"Nothing. I have only just arrived."
</p><p>At that moment, the sergeant of gendarmes came up to M. Filleul and
handed him a crumpled, torn and discolored piece of paper, which he had
picked up not far from the place where the scarf was found. M. Filleul
looked at it and gave it to Beautrelet, saying:
</p><p>"I don't suppose this will help us much in our investigations."
</p><p>Isidore turned the paper over and over. It was covered with figures,
dots and signs and presented the exact appearance reproduced below:
