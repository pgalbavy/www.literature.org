<p>All this has taken a long time to set down, but there was little
time in the acting. Scarce half an hour had passed from my waking
by the black fire till I found myself up to the waist in the stream.
I made no further delay, but, as soon as the air was quiet, led
Saladin out as stilly as I could on the far side of the willows,
clambered on his back (for I was too sore in body to mount in
any other fashion), and was riding for dear life along the moor
road in the contrary direction to that from which I had come on
the night before. The horse had plainly been well fed, since,
doubtless, the ruffians had marked him for their own plunder.
He covered the ground in gallant fashion, driving up jets and
splashes of rain water from the pools in the way. Mile after mile
was passed with no sound of pursuers; one hill gave place to another;
the stream grew wider and more orderly; but still I kept up the
breakneck pace, fearing to slacken rein. Fifteen miles were covered,
as I judged, before I saw the first light of dawn in the sky,
a red streak in a gray desert; and brought my horse down to a
trot, thanking God that at last I was beyond danger.</p>

<p>I was sore in body, with clammy garments sticking to my skin,
aching in back and neck, unslept, well-nigh as miserable as a
man could be. But great as was my bodily discomfort, 'twas not
one tittle to compare with the sickness of my heart. I had been
driven to escape from a hostel by a window like a common thief;
compelled to ride,&mdash;nay, there was no use in disguising it,&mdash;to
flee, before a pack of ill-bred villains; I, a gentleman of France,
who had ruffled it with the best of them in my fit of prosperity.
Again and again I questioned with myself whether I had not done
better to die in that place, fighting as long as the breath was
in my body. Of this I am sure, at any rate, that it would have
been the way more soothing to my pride. I argued the matter with
myself, according to the most approved logic, but could come no
nearer to the solution. For while I thought the picture of myself
dying with my back to the wall the more heroical and gentleman-like,
it yet went sore against me to think of myself, with all my skill
of the sword and the polite arts, perishing in a desert place
at the hand of common cutthroats. 'Twas no fear of death, I give
my word of honor; that was a weakness never found in our race.
Courage is a virtue I take no credit for; 'tis but a matter of
upbringing. But a man loves to make some noise in the earth ere
he leaves it, or at least to pass with blowings of the trumpet
and some manner of show. To this day I cannot think of any way
by which I could have mended my conduct. I can but set it down
as a mischance of Providence, which meets all men in their career,
but of which no man of spirit cares to think.</p>

<p>The sun rose clear, but had scarce shone for an hour, when, as
is the way in this land, a fresh deluge of rain came on, and the
dawn, which had begun in crimson, ended in a dull level of gray.
I had never been used with much foul weather of this sort, so
I bore it ill. 'Twas about nine of the morning when I rode into
the village of Drumlanrig, a jumble of houses in the lee of a
great wood, which runs up to meet the descending moorlands. Some
ragged brats, heedless of the weather, played in the street, if
one may call it by so fine a name; but for the most part the houses
seemed quite deserted. A woman looked incuriously at me; a man
who was carrying sacks scarce raised his head to view me; the
whole place was like a dwelling of the dead. I have since learned
the reason, which was no other than the accursed butchery on which
I had quarreled with Quentin Kennedy, and so fallen upon misfortune.
The young and manly were all gone; some to the hills for hiding,
some to the town prisons, some across the seas to work in the
plantations, and some on that long journey from which no man returns.
My heart boils within me to this day to think of it&mdash;but there!
it is long since past, and I have little need to be groaning over
it now.</p>

<p>There was no inn in the place, but I bought bread from the folk
of a little farm-steading at one end of the village street. They
would scarce give it to me at first, and 'twas not till they beheld
my woebegone plight that their hearts relented. Doubtless they
took me for one of the soldiers who had harried them and theirs,
little guessing that 'twas all for their sake that I was in such
evil case. I did not tarry to ask the road, for Leith was too
far distant for the people in that place to know it. Of this much
I was sure, that it lay to the northeast, so I took my way in
that direction, shaping my course by the sun. There was a little
patch of green fields, a clump of trees, and a quiet stream beside
the village; but I had scarce ridden half a mile beyond it when
once more the moor swallowed me up in its desert of moss and wet
heather.</p>

<p>I was now doubly dispirited. My short exhilaration of escape
had gone, and all the pangs of wounded pride and despair seized
upon me, mingled with a sort of horror of the place I had come
through. Whenever I saw a turn of hill which brought the <em>Angel's
Ladder</em> to my mind, I shivered in spite of myself, and could
have found it in my heart to turn and flee. In addition, I would
have you remember, I was soaked to the very skin, my eyes weary
with lack of sleep, and my legs cramped with much riding.</p>

<p>The place in the main was moorland, with steep, desolate hills
on my left. On the right to the south I had glimpses of a fairer
country, woods and distant fields, seen for an instant through
the driving mist. In a trice France was back in my mind, for I
could not see an acre of green land without coming nigh to tears.
Yet, and perhaps 'twas fortunate for me, such glimpses were all
too rare. For the most part, the way was along succession of sloughs
and mires, with here a piece of dry, heathy ground, and there
an impetuous water coming down from the highlands. Saladin soon
fell tired, and, indeed, small wonder, since he had come many
miles, and his fare had been of the scantiest. He would put his
foot in a bog-hole and stumble so sharply that I would all but
lose my seat. Then, poor beast, he would take shame to himself,
and pick his way as well as his weary legs would suffer him. 'Twas
an evil plight for man and steed, and I knew not which to pity
the more.</p>

<p>At noon, I came to the skirts of a long hill, whose top was hidden
with fog, but which I judged to be high and lonesome. I met a
man&mdash;the first I had seen since Drumlanrig&mdash;and asked him my whereabouts.
I learned that the hill was called Queen's Berry, and that in
some dozen miles I would strike the high road to Edinburgh. I
could get not another word out of him, but must needs content
myself with this crumb of knowledge. The road in front was no
road, nothing but a heathery moor, with walls of broken stones
seaming it like the lines of sewing in an old coat. Gray broken
hills came up for a minute, as a stray wind blew the mist aside,
only to disappear the next instant in a ruin of cloud.</p>

<p>From this place I mark the beginning of the most wretched journey
in my memory. Till now I had had some measure of bodily strength
to support me. Now it failed, and a cold shivering fit seized
on my vitals, and more than once I was like to have fallen from
my horse. A great stupidity came over my brain; I could call up
no remembrance to cheer me, but must plod on in a horror of darkness.
The cause was not far distant&mdash;cold, wet, and despair. I tried
to swallow some of the rain-soaked bread in my pouch, but my mouth
was as dry as a skin. I dismounted to drink at a stream, but the
water could hardly trickle down my throat so much did it ache.
'Twas as if I were on the eve of an ague, and in such a place
it were like to be the end of me.</p>

<p>Had there been a house, I should have craved shelter. But one
effect of my sickness was, that I soon strayed woefully from my
path, such as it was, and found myself in an evil case with bogs
and steep hillsides. I had much to do in keeping Saladin from
danger; and had I not felt the obligation to behave like a man,
I should have flung the reins on his neck and let him bear himself
and his master to destruction. Again and again I drove the wish
from my mind&mdash;"As well die in a bog-hole or break your neck over
a crag as dwine away with ague in the cold heather, as you are
like to do," said the tempter. But I steeled my heart, and made
a great resolve to keep one thing, though I should lose all else&mdash;some
shreds of my manhood.</p>

<p>Toward evening I grew so ill that I was fain, when we came to
a level place, to lay my head on Saladin's neck, and let him stumble
forward. My head swam, and my back ached so terribly that I guessed
feverishly that someone had stabbed me unawares. The weather cleared
just about even, and the light of day flickered out in a watery
sunset. 'Twas like the close of my life, I thought, a gray ill
day and a poor ending. The notion depressed me miserably. I felt
a kinship with that feeble evening light, a kinship begotten of
equality in weakness. However, all would soon end; my day must
presently have its evening; and then, if all tales were true,
and my prayers had any efficacy, I should be in a better place.</p>

<p>But when once the night in its blackness had set in, I longed
for the light again, however dismal it might be. A ghoulish song,
one which I had heard long before, was ever coming to my memory:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"La pluye nous a debuez et lavez,<br/>
Et le soleil dessechez et noirciz;<br/>
Pies, corbeaux&#11834;"

</p>
</div>
<p>With a sort of horror I tried to drive it from my mind. A dreadful
heaviness oppressed me. Fears which I am ashamed to set down thronged
my brain. The way had grown easier, or I make no doubt my horse
had fallen. 'Twas a track we were on, I could tell by the greater
freedom with which Saladin stepped. God send, I prayed, that we
be near to folk, and that they be kindly; this prayer I said many
times to the accompaniment of the whistling of the doleful wind.
Every gust pained me. I was the sport of the weather, a broken
puppet tossed about by circumstance.</p>

<p>Now an answer was sent to me, and that a speedy one. I came of
a sudden to a clump of shrubbery beside a wall. Then at a turn
of the way a light shone through, as from a broad window among
trees. A few steps more and I stumbled on a gate, and turned Saladin's
head up a pathway. The rain dripped heavily from the bushes, a
branch slashed me in the face, and my weariness grew tenfold with
every second. I dropped like a log before the door, scarce looking
to see whether the house was great or little; and, ere I could
knock or make any call, swooned away dead on the threshold.</p>
