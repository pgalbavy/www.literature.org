<p> <em>GENERAL SANTIERRA </em>was right in his surmise. Such was
the exact nature of the assistance which Gaspar Ruiz, peasant
son of peasants, received from the Royalist family whose daughter
had opened the door&mdash;of their miserable refuge to his extreme
distress. Her sombre resolution ruled the madness of her father
and the trembling bewilderment of her mother.</p>

<p>She had asked the strange man on the door-step, "Who wounded
you?"</p>

<p>"The soldiers, senora," Gaspar Ruiz had answered, in a faint
voice.</p>

<p>"Patriots?"</p>

<p>"Si."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Deserter," he gasped, leaning against the wall under the scrutiny
of her black eyes. "I was left for dead over there."</p>

<p>She led him through the house out to a small hut of clay and
reeds, lost in the long grass of the overgrown orchard. He sank
on a heap of maize straw in a corner, and sighed profoundly.</p>

<p>"No one will look for you here," she said, looking down at him.
"Nobody comes near us. We too have been left for dead&mdash;here."</p>

<p>He stirred uneasily on his heap of dirty straw, and the pain
in his neck made him groan deliriously.</p>

<p>"I shall show Estaban some day that I am alive yet," he mumbled.</p>

<p>He accepted her assistance in silence, and the many days of pain
went by. Her appearances in the hut brought him relief and became
connected with the feverish dreams of angels which visited his
couch; for Gaspar Ruiz was instructed in the mysteries of his
religion, and had even been taught to read and write a little
by the priest of his village. He waited for her with impatience,
and saw her pass out of the dark hut and disappear in the brilliant
sunshine with poignant regret. He discovered that, while he lay
there feeling so very weak, he could, by closing his eyes, evoke
her face with considerable distinctness. And this discovered faculty
charmed the long solitary hours of his convalescence. Later, when
he began to regain his strength, he would creep at dusk from his
hut to the house and sit on the step of the garden door.</p>

<p>In one of the rooms the mad father paced to and fro, muttering
to himself with short abrupt laughs. In the passage, sitting on
a stool, the mother sighed and moaned. The daughter, in rough
threadbare clothing, and her white haggard face half hidden by
a coarse manta, stood leaning against the lintel of the door.
Gaspar Ruiz, with his elbows propped on his knees and his head
resting in his hands, talked to the two women in an undertone.</p>

<p>The common misery of destitution would have made a bitter mockery
of a marked insistence on social differences. Gaspar Ruiz understood
this in his simplicity. From his captivity amongst the Royalists
he could give them news of people they knew. He described their
appearance; and when he related the story of the battle in which
he was recaptured the two women lamented the blow to their cause
and the ruin of their secret hopes.</p>

<p>He had no feeling either way. But he felt a great devotion for
that young girl. In his desire to appear worthy of her condescension,
he boasted a little of his bodily strength. He had nothing else
to boast of. Because of that quality his comrades treated him
with as great a deference, he explained, as though he had been
a sergeant, both in camp and in battle.</p>

<p>"I could always get as many as I wanted to follow me anywhere,
senorita. I ought to have been made an officer, because I can
read and write."</p>

<p>Behind him the silent old lady fetched a moaning sigh from time
to time; the distracted father muttered to himself, pacing the
sala; and Gaspar Ruiz would raise his eyes now and then to look
at the daughter of these people.</p>

<p>He would look at her with curiosity because she was alive, and
also with that feeling of familiarity and awe with which he had
contemplated in churches the inanimate and powerful statues of
the saints, whose protection is invoked in dangers and difficulties.
His difficulty was very great.</p>

<p>He could not remain hiding in an orchard for ever and ever. He
knew also very well that before he had gone half a day’s journey
in any direction, he would be picked up by one of the cavalry
patrols scouring the country, and brought into one or another
of the camps where the patriot army destined for the liberation
of Peru was collected. There he would in the end be recognised
as Gaspar Ruiz&mdash;the deserter to the Royalists&mdash;and no doubt shot
very effectually this time. There did not seem any place in the
world for the innocent Gaspar Ruiz anywhere. And at this thought
his simple soul surrendered itself to gloom and resentment as
black as night.</p>

<p>They had made him a soldier forcibly. He did not mind being a
soldier. And he had been a good soldier as he had been a good
son, because of his docility and his strength. But now there was
no use for either. They had taken him from his parents, and he
could no longer be a soldier&mdash;not a good soldier at any rate.
Nobody would listen to his explanations. What injustice it was!
What injustice!</p>

<p>And in a mournful murmur he would go over the story of his capture
and recapture for the twentieth time. Then, raising his eyes to
the silent girl in the doorway, "Si, senorita," he would say with
a deep sigh, "injustice has made this poor breath in my body quite
worthless to me and to anybody else. And I do not care who robs
me of it."</p>

<p>One evening, as he exhaled thus the plaint of his wounded soul,
she condescended to say that, if she were a man, she would consider
no life worthless which held the possibility of revenge.</p>

<p>She seemed to be speaking to herself. Her voice was low. He drank
in the gentle, as if dreamy sound, with a consciousness of peculiar
delight, of something warming his breast like a draught of generous
wine.</p>

<p>"True, senorita," he said, raising his face up to hers slowly:
"there is Estaban, who must be shown that I am not dead after
all."</p>

<p>The mutterings of the mad father had ceased long before; the
sighing mother had withdrawn somewhere into one of the empty rooms.
All was still within as well as without, in the moonlight bright
as day on the wild orchard full of inky shadows. Gaspar Ruiz saw
the dark eyes of Doña Erminia look down at him.</p>

<p>"Ala! The sergeant," she muttered disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Why! He has wounded me with his sword," he protested, bewildered
by the contempt that seemed to shine livid on her pale face.</p>

<p>She crushed him with her glance. The power of her will to be
understood was so strong that it kindled in him the intelligence
of unexpressed things.</p>

<p>"What else did you expect me to do?" he cried, as if suddenly
driven to despair. "Have I the power to do more? Am I a general
with an army at my back?&mdash;miserable sinner that I am to be despised
by you at last."</p>
