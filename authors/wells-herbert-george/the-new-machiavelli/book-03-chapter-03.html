At last, out of a vast accumulation of impressions, decision 
distilled quite suddenly.  I succumbed to Evesham and that dream of 
the right thing triumphant through expression.  I determined I would 
go over to the Conservatives, and use my every gift and power on the 
side of such forces on that side as made for educational 
reorganisation, scientific research, literature, criticism, and 
intellectual development.  That was in 1909.  I judged the Tories 
were driving straight at a conflict with the country, and I thought 
them bound to incur an electoral defeat.  I under-estimated their 
strength in the counties.  There would follow, I calculated, a 
period of profound reconstruction in method and policy alike.  I was 
entirely at one with Crupp in perceiving in this an immense 
opportunity for the things we desired.  An aristocracy quickened by 
conflict and on the defensive, and full of the idea of justification 
by reconstruction, might prove altogether more apt for thought and 
high professions than Mrs. Redmondson's spoilt children.  Behind the 
now inevitable struggle for a reform of the House of Lords, there 
would be great heart searchings and educational endeavour.  On that 
we reckoned. . . .
<P>
At last we talked it out to the practical pitch, and Crupp and 
Shoesmith, and I and Gane, made our definite agreement together. . . .
<P>
I emerged from enormous silences upon Margaret one evening.
<P>
She was just back from the display of some new musicians at the 
Hartsteins.  I remember she wore a dress of golden satin, very rich-
looking and splendid.  About her slender neck there was a rope of 
gold-set amber beads.  Her hair caught up and echoed and returned 
these golden notes.  I, too, was in evening dress, but where I had 
been escapes me,--some forgotten dinner, I suppose.  I went into her 
room.  I remember I didn't speak for some moments.  I went across to 
the window and pulled the blind aside, and looked out upon the 
railed garden of the square, with its shrubs and shadowed turf 
gleaming pallidly and irregularly in the light of the big electric 
standard in the corner.
<P>
"Margaret," I said, "I think I shall break with the party."
<P>
She made no answer.  I turned presently, a movement of enquiry.
<P>
"I was afraid you meant to do that," she said.
<P>
"I'm out of touch," I explained.  "Altogether."
<P>
"Oh! I know."
<P>
"It places me in a difficult position," I said.
<P>
Margaret stood at her dressing-table, looking steadfastly at herself 
in the glass, and with her fingers playing with a litter of 
stoppered bottles of tinted glass.  "I was afraid it was coming to 
this," she said.
<P>
"In a way," I said, "we've been allies.  I owe my seat to you.  I 
couldn't have gone into Parliament. . . ."
<P>
"I don't want considerations like that to affect us," she 
interrupted.
<P>
There was a pause.  She sat down in a chair by her dressing-table, 
lifted an ivory hand-glass, and put it down again.
<P>
"I wish," she said, with something like a sob in her voice, "it were 
possible that you shouldn't do this."  She stopped abruptly, and I 
did not look at her, because I could feel the effort she was making 
to control herself.
<P>
"I thought," she began again, "when you came into Parliament--"
<P>
There came another silence.  "It's all gone so differently," she 
said.  "Everything has gone so differently."
<P>
I had a sudden memory of her, shining triumphant after the 
Kinghampstead election, and for the first time I realised just how 
perplexing and disappointing my subsequent career must have been to 
her.
<P>
"I'm not doing this without consideration," I said.
<P>
"I know," she said, in a voice of despair, "I've seen it coming.  
But--I still don't understand it.  I don't understand how you can go 
over."
<P>
"My ideas have changed and developed," I said.
<P>
I walked across to her bearskin hearthrug, and stood by the mantel.
<P>
"To think that you," she said; "you who might have been leader--"  
She could not finish it.  "All the forces of reaction," she threw 
out.
<P>
"I don't think they are the forces of reaction," I said.  "I think I 
can find work to do--better work on that side."
<P>
"Against us!" she said.  "As if progress wasn't hard enough!  As if 
it didn't call upon every able man!"
<P>
"I don't think Liberalism has a monopoly of progress."
<P>
She did not answer that.  She sat quite still looking in front of 
her.  "WHY have you gone over?" she asked abruptly as though I had 
said nothing.
<P>
There came a silence that I was impelled to end.  I began a stiff 
dissertation from the hearthrug.  "I am going over, because I think 
I may join in an intellectual renascence on the Conservative side.  
I think that in the coming struggle there will be a partial and 
altogether confused and demoralising victory for democracy, that 
will stir the classes which now dominate the Conservative party into 
an energetic revival.  They will set out to win back, and win back.  
Even if my estimate of con-temporary forces is wrong and they win, 
they will still be forced to reconstruct their outlook.  A war 
abroad will supply the chastening if home politics fail.  The effort 
at renascence is bound to come by either alternative.  I believe I 
can do more in relation to that effort than in any other connexion 
in the world of politics at the present time.  That's my case, 
Margaret."
<P>
She certainly did not grasp what I said.  "And so you will throw 
aside all the beginnings, all the beliefs and pledges--" Again her 
sentence remained incomplete.  "I doubt if even, once you have gone 
over, they will welcome you."
<P>
"That hardly matters."
<P>
I made an effort to resume my speech.
<P>
"I came into Parliament, Margaret," I said, "a little prematurely.  
Still--I suppose it was only by coming into Parliament that I could 
see things as I do now in terms of personality and imaginative 
range. . . ." I stopped.  Her stiff, unhappy, unlistening silence 
broke up my disquisition.
<P>
"After all," I remarked, "most of this has been implicit in my 
writings."
<P>
She made no sign of admission.
<P>
"What are you going to do?" she asked.
<P>
"Keep my seat for a time and make the reasons of my breach clear.  
Then either I must resign or--probably this new Budget will lead to 
a General Election.  It's evidently meant to strain the Lords and 
provoke a quarrel."
<P>
"You might, I think, have stayed to fight for the Budget."
<P>
"I'm not," I said, "so keen against the Lords."
<P>
On that we halted.
<P>
"But what are you going to do?" she asked.
<P>
"I shall make my quarrel over some points in the Budget.  I can't 
quite tell you yet where my chance will come.  Then I shall either 
resign my seat--or if things drift to dissolution I shall stand 
again."
<P>
"It's political suicide."
<P>
"Not altogether."
<P>
"I can't imagine you out of Parliament again.  It's just like--like 
undoing all we have done.  What will you do?"
<P>
"Write.  Make a new, more definite place for myself.  You know, of 
course, there's already a sort of group about Crupp and Gane."
<P>
Margaret seemed lost for a time in painful thought.
<P>
"For me," she said at last, "our political work has been a religion--
it has been more than a religion."
<P>
I heard in silence.  I had no form of protest available against the 
implications of that.
<P>
"And then I find you turning against all we aimed to do--talking of 
going over, almost lightly--to those others." . . .
<P>
She was white-lipped as she spoke.  In the most curious way she had 
captured the moral values of the situation.  I found myself 
protesting ineffectually against her fixed conviction.  "It's 
because I think my duty lies in this change that I make it," I said.
<P>
"I don't see how you can say that," she replied quietly.
<P>
There was another pause between us.
<P>
"Oh!" she said and clenched her hand upon the table.  "That it 
should have come to this!"
<P>
She was extraordinarily dignified and extraordinarily absurd.  She 
was hurt and thwarted beyond measure.  She had no place in her 
ideas, I thought, for me.  I could see how it appeared to her, but I 
could not make her see anything of the intricate process that had 
brought me to this divergence.  The opposition of our intellectual 
temperaments was like a gag in my mouth.  What was there for me to 
say?  A flash of intuition told me that behind her white dignity was 
a passionate disappointment, a shattering of dreams that needed 
before everything else the relief of weeping.
<P>
"I've told you," I said awkwardly, "as soon as I could."
<P>
There was another long silence.  "So that is how we stand," I said 
with an air of having things defined.  I walked slowly to the door.
<P>
She had risen and stood now staring in front of her.
<P>
"Good-night," I said, making no movement towards our habitual kiss.
<P>
"Good-night," she answered in a tragic note. . . .
<P>
I closed the door softly.  I remained for a moment or so on the big 
landing, hesitating between my bedroom and my study.  As I did so I 
heard the soft rustle of her movement and the click of the key in 
her bedroom door.  Then everything was still. . . .
<P>
She hid her tears from me.  Something gripped my heart at the 
thought.
<P>
"Damnation!" I said wincing.  "Why the devil can't people at least 
THINK in the same manner?"
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
And that insufficient colloquy was the beginning of a prolonged 
estrangement between us.  It was characteristic of our relations 
that we never reopened the discussion.  The thing had been in the 
air for some time; we had recognised it now; the widening breach 
between us was confessed.  My own feelings were curiously divided.  
It is remarkable that my very real affection for Margaret only 
became evident to me with this quarrel.  The changes of the heart 
are very subtle changes.  I am quite unaware how or when my early 
romantic love for her purity and beauty and high-principled devotion 
evaporated from my life; but I do know that quite early in my 
parliamentary days there had come a vague, unconfessed resentment at 
the tie that seemed to hold me in servitude to her standards of 
private living and public act.  I felt I was caught, and none the 
less so because it had been my own act to rivet on my shackles.  So 
long as I still held myself bound to her that resentment grew.  Now, 
since I had broken my bonds and taken my line it withered again, and 
I could think of Margaret with a returning kindliness.
<P>
But I still felt embarrassment with her.  I felt myself dependent 
upon her for house room and food and social support, as it were 
under false pretences.  I would have liked to have separated our 
financial affairs altogether.  But I knew that to raise the issue 
would have seemed a last brutal indelicacy.  So I tried almost 
furtively to keep my personal expenditure within the scope of the 
private income I made by writing, and we went out together in her 
motor brougham, dined and made appearances, met politely at 
breakfast--parted at night with a kiss upon her cheek.  The locking 
of her door upon me, which at that time I quite understood, which I 
understand now, became for a time in my mind, through some obscure 
process of the soul, an offence.  I never crossed the landing to her 
room again.
<P>
In all this matter, and, indeed, in all my relations with Margaret, 
I perceive now I behaved badly and foolishly.  My manifest blunder 
is that I, who was several years older than she, much subtler and in 
many ways wiser, never in any measure sought to guide and control 
her.  After our marriage I treated her always as an equal, and let 
her go her way; held her responsible for all the weak and 
ineffective and unfortunate things she said and did to me.  She 
wasn't clever enough to justify that.  It wasn't fair to expect her 
to sympathise, anticipate, and understand.  I ought to have taken 
care of her, roped her to me when it came to crossing the difficult 
places.  If I had loved her more, and wiselier and more tenderly, if 
there had not been the consciousness of my financial dependence on 
her always stiffening my pride, I think she would have moved with me 
from the outset, and left the Liberals with me.  But she did not get 
any inkling of the ends I sought in my change of sides.  It must 
have seemed to her inexplicable perversity.  She had, I knew--for 
surely I knew it then--an immense capacity for loyalty and devotion.  
There she was with these treasures untouched, neglected and 
perplexed.  A woman who loves wants to give.  It is the duty and 
business of the man she has married for love to help her to help and 
give.  But I was stupid.  My eyes had never been opened.  I was 
stiff with her and difficult to her, because even on my wedding 
morning there had been, deep down in my soul, voiceless though 
present, something weakly protesting, a faint perception of wrong-
doing, the infinitesimally small, slow-multiplying germs of shame.
<P>

<P>
<P>
I made my breach with the party on the Budget.
<P>
In many ways I was disposed to regard the 1909 Budget as a fine 
piece of statecraft.  Its production was certainly a very unexpected 
display of vigour on the Liberal side.  But, on the whole, this 
movement towards collectivist organisation on the part of the 
Liberals rather strengthened than weakened my resolve to cross the 
floor of the house.  It made it more necessary, I thought, to leaven 
the purely obstructive and reactionary elements that were at once 
manifest in the opposition.  I assailed the land taxation proposals 
in one main speech, and a series of minor speeches in committee.  
The line of attack I chose was that the land was a great public 
service that needed to be controlled on broad and far-sighted lines.  
I had no objection to its nationalisation, but I did object most 
strenuously to the idea of leaving it in private hands, and 
attempting to produce beneficial social results through the pressure 
of taxation upon the land-owning class.  That might break it up in 
an utterly disastrous way.  The drift of the government proposals 
was all in the direction of sweating the landowner to get immediate 
values from his property, and such a course of action was bound to 
give us an irritated and vindictive land-owning class, the class 
upon which we had hitherto relied--not unjustifiably--for certain 
broad, patriotic services and an influence upon our collective 
judgments that no other class seemed prepared to exercise.  Abolish 
landlordism if you will, I said, buy it out, but do not drive it to 
a defensive fight, and leave it still sufficiently strong and 
wealthy to become a malcontent element in your state.  You have 
taxed and controlled the brewer and the publican until the outraged 
Liquor Interest has become a national danger.  You now propose to do 
the same thing on a larger scale.  You turn a class which has many 
fine and truly aristocratic traditions towards revolt, and there is 
nothing in these or any other of your proposals that shows any sense 
of the need for leadership to replace these traditional leaders you 
are ousting.  This was the substance of my case, and I hammered at 
it not only in the House, but in the press. . . .
<P>
The Kinghampstead division remained for some time insensitive to my 
defection.
<P>
Then it woke up suddenly, and began, in the columns of the 
KINGSHAMPSTEAD GUARDIAN, an indignant, confused outcry.  I was 
treated to an open letter, signed Junius Secundus," and I replied in 
provocative terms.  There were two thinly attended public meetings 
at different ends of the constituency, and then I had a 
correspondence with my old friend Parvill, the photographer, which 
ended in my seeing a deputation.
<P>
My impression is that it consisted of about eighteen or twenty 
people.  They had had to come upstairs to me and they were 
manifestly full of indignation and a little short of breath.  There 
was Parvill himself, J.P., dressed wholly in black--I think to mark 
his sense of the occasion--and curiously suggestive in his respect 
for my character and his concern for the honourableness of the 
KINGHAMPSTEAD GUARDIAN editor, of Mark Antony at the funeral of 
Cesar.  There was Mrs. Bulger, also in mourning; she had never 
abandoned the widow's streamers since the death of her husband ten 
years ago, and her loyalty to Liberalism of the severest type was 
part as it were of her weeds.  There was a nephew of Sir Roderick 
Newton, a bright young Hebrew of the graver type, and a couple of 
dissenting ministers in high collars and hats that stopped halfway 
between the bowler of this world and the shovel-hat of heaven.  
There was also a young solicitor from Lurky done in the horsey 
style, and there was a very little nervous man with a high brow and 
a face contracting below as though the jawbones and teeth had been 
taken out and the features compressed.  The rest of the deputation, 
which included two other public-spirited ladies and several 
ministers of religion, might have been raked out of any omnibus 
going Strandward during the May meetings.  They thrust Parvill 
forward as spokesman, and manifested a strong disposition to say 
"Hear, hear!" to his more strenuous protests provided my eye wasn't 
upon them at the time.
<P>
I regarded this appalling deputation as Parvill's apologetic but 
quite definite utterances drew to an end.  I had a moment of vision.  
Behind them I saw the wonderful array of skeleton forces that stand 
for public opinion, that are as much public opinion as exists indeed 
at the present time.  The whole process of politics which bulks so 
solidly in history seemed for that clairvoyant instant but a froth 
of petty motives above abysms of indifference. . . .
<P>
Some one had finished.  I perceived I had to speak.
<P>
"Very well," I said, "I won't keep you long in replying.  I'll 
resign if there isn't a dissolution before next February, and if 
there is I shan't stand again.  You don't want the bother and 
expense of a bye-election (approving murmurs) if it can be avoided.  
But I may tell you plainly now that I don't think it will be 
necessary for me to resign, and the sooner you find my successor the 
better for the party.  The Lords are in a corner; they've got to 
fight now or never, and I think they will throw out the Budget.  
Then they will go on fighting.  It is a fight that will last for 
years.  They have a sort of social discipline, and you haven't.  You 
Liberals will find yourselves with a country behind you, vaguely 
indignant perhaps, but totally unprepared with any ideas whatever in 
the matter, face to face with the problem of bringing the British 
constitution up-to-date.  Anything may happen, provided only that it 
is sufficiently absurd.  If the King backs the Lords--and I don't 
see why he shouldn't--you have no Republican movement whatever to 
fall back upon.  You lost it during the Era of Good Taste.  The 
country, I say, is destitute of ideas, and you have no ideas to give 
it.  I don't see what you will do. . . .  For my own part, I mean to 
spend a year or so between a window and my writingdesk."
<P>
I paused.  "I think, gentlemen," began Parvill, "that we hear all 
this with very great regret. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
My estrangement from Margaret stands in my memory now as something 
that played itself out within the four walls of our house in Radnor 
Square, which was, indeed, confined to those limits.  I went to and 
fro between my house and the House of Commons, and the dining-rooms 
and clubs and offices in which we were preparing our new 
developments, in a state of aggressive and energetic dissociation, 
in the nascent state, as a chemist would say.  I was free now, and 
greedy for fresh combination.  I had a tremendous sense of released 
energies.  I had got back to the sort of thing I could do, and to 
the work that had been shaping itself for so long in my imagination.  
Our purpose now was plain, bold, and extraordinarily congenial.  We 
meant no less than to organise a new movement in English thought and 
life, to resuscitate a Public Opinion and prepare the ground for a 
revised and renovated ruling culture.
<P>
For a time I seemed quite wonderfully able to do whatever I wanted 
to do.  Shoesmith responded to my first advances.  We decided to 
create a weekly paper as our nucleus, and Crupp and I set to work 
forthwith to collect a group of writers and speakers, including 
Esmeer, Britten, Lord Gane, Neal, and one or two younger men, which 
should constitute a more or less definite editorial council about 
me, and meet at a weekly lunch on Tuesday to sustain our general co-
operations.  We marked our claim upon Toryism even in the colour of 
our wrapper, and spoke of ourselves collectively as the Blue 
Weeklies.  But our lunches were open to all sorts of guests, and our 
deliberations were never of a character to control me effectively in 
my editorial decisions.  My only influential councillor at first was 
old Britten, who became my sub-editor.  It was curious how we two 
had picked up our ancient intimacy again and resumed the easy give 
and take of our speculative dreaming schoolboy days.
<P>
For a time my life centred altogether upon this journalistic work.  
Britten was an experienced journalist, and I had most of the 
necessary instincts for the business.  We meant to make the paper 
right and good down to the smallest detail, and we set ourselves at 
this with extraordinary zeal.  It wasn't our intention to show our 
political motives too markedly at first, and through all the dust 
storm and tumult and stress of the political struggle of 1910, we 
made a little intellectual oasis of good art criticism and good 
writing.  It was the firm belief of nearly all of us that the Lords 
were destined to be beaten badly in 1910, and our game was the 
longer game of reconstruction that would begin when the shouting and 
tumult of that immediate conflict were over.  Meanwhile we had to 
get into touch with just as many good minds as possible.
<P>
As we felt our feet, I developed slowly and carefully a broadly 
conceived and consistent political attitude.  As I will explain 
later, we were feminist from the outset, though that caused 
Shoesmith and Gane great searching of heart; we developed Esmeer's 
House of Lords reform scheme into a general cult of the aristocratic 
virtues, and we did much to humanise and liberalise the narrow 
excellencies of that Break-up of the Poor Law agitation, which had 
been organised originally by Beatrice and Sidney Webb.  In addition, 
without any very definite explanation to any one but Esmeer and 
Isabel Rivers, and as if it was quite a small matter, I set myself 
to secure a uniform philosophical quality in our columns.
<P>
That, indeed, was the peculiar virtue and characteristic of the BLUE 
WEEKLY.  I was now very definitely convinced that much of the 
confusion and futility of contemporary thought was due to the 
general need of metaphysical training. . . .  The great mass of 
people--and not simply common people, but people active and 
influential in intellectual things--are still quite untrained in the 
methods of thought and absolutely innocent of any criticism of 
method; it is scarcely a caricature to call their thinking a crazy 
patchwork, discontinuous and chaotic.  They arrive at conclusions by 
a kind of accident, and do not suspect any other way may be found to 
their attainment.  A stage above this general condition stands that 
minority of people who have at some time or other discovered general 
terms and a certain use for generalisations.  They are--to fall back 
on the ancient technicality--Realists of a crude sort.  When I say 
Realist of course I mean Realist as opposed to Nominalist, and not 
Realist in the almost diametrically different sense of opposition to 
Idealist.  Such are the Baileys; such, to take their great 
prototype, was Herbert Spencer (who couldn't read Kant); such are 
whole regiments of prominent and entirely self-satisfied 
contemporaries.  They go through queer little processes of 
definition and generalisation and deduction with the completest 
belief in the validity of the intellectual instrument they are 
using.  They are Realists--Cocksurists--in matter of fact; 
sentimentalists in behaviour.  The Baileys having got to this 
glorious stage in mental development--it is glorious because it has 
no doubts--were always talking about training "Experts" to apply the 
same simple process to all the affairs of mankind.  Well, Realism 
isn't the last word of human wisdom.  Modest-minded people, doubtful 
people, subtle people, and the like--the kind of people William 
James writes of as "tough-minded," go on beyond this methodical 
happiness, and are forever after critical of premises and terms.  
They are truer--and less confident.  They have reached scepticism 
and the artistic method.  They have emerged into the new Nominalism.
<P>
Both Isabel and I believe firmly that these differences of 
intellectual method matter profoundly in the affairs of mankind, 
that the collective mind of this intricate complex modern state can 
only function properly upon neo-Nominalist lines.  This has always 
been her side of our mental co-operation rather than mine.  Her mind 
has the light movement that goes so often with natural mental power; 
she has a wonderful art in illustration, and, as the reader probably 
knows already, she writes of metaphysical matters with a rare charm 
and vividness.  So far there has been no collection of her papers 
published, but they are to be found not only in the BLUE WEEKLY 
columns but scattered about the monthlies; many people must be 
familiar with her style.  It was an intention we did much to realise 
before our private downfall, that we would use the BLUE WEEKLY to 
maintain a stream of suggestion against crude thinking, and at last 
scarcely a week passed but some popular distinction, some large 
imposing generalisation, was touched to flaccidity by her pen or 
mine. . . .
<P>
I was at great pains to give my philosophical, political, and social 
matter the best literary and critical backing we could get in 
London.  I hunted sedulously for good descriptive writing and good 
criticism; I was indefatigable in my readiness to hear and consider, 
if not to accept advice; I watched every corner of the paper, and 
had a dozen men alert to get me special matter of the sort that 
draws in the unattached reader.  The chief danger on the literary 
side of a weekly is that it should fall into the hands of some 
particular school, and this I watched for closely.  It seems 
impossible to get vividness of apprehension and breadth of view 
together in the same critic.  So it falls to the wise editor to 
secure the first and impose the second.  Directly I detected the 
shrill partisan note in our criticism, the attempt to puff a poor 
thing because it was "in the right direction," or damn a vigorous 
piece of work because it wasn't, I tackled the man and had it out 
with him.  Our pay was good enough for that to matter a good deal. . . .
<P>
Our distinctive little blue and white poster kept up its neat 
persistent appeal to the public eye, and before 1911 was out, the 
BLUE WEEKLY was printing twenty pages of publishers' advertisements, 
and went into all the clubs in London and three-quarters of the 
country houses where week-end parties gather together.  Its sale by 
newsagents and bookstalls grew steadily.  One got more and more the 
reassuring sense of being discussed, and influencing discussion.

Our office was at the very top of a big building near the end of 
Adelphi Terrace; the main window beside my desk, a big undivided 
window of plate glass, looked out upon Cleopatra's Needle, the 
corner of the Hotel Cecil, the fine arches of Waterloo Bridge, and 
the long sweep of south bank with its shot towers and chimneys, past 
Bankside to the dimly seen piers of the great bridge below the 
Tower.  The dome of St. Paul's just floated into view on the left 
against the hotel facade.  By night and day, in every light and 
atmosphere, it was a beautiful and various view, alive as a 
throbbing heart; a perpetual flow of traffic ploughed and splashed 
the streaming silver of the river, and by night the shapes of things 
became velvet black and grey, and the water a shining mirror of 
steel, wearing coruscating gems of light.  In the foreground the 
Embankment trams sailed glowing by, across the water advertisements 
flashed and flickered, trains went and came and a rolling drift of 
smoke reflected unseen fires.  By day that spectacle was sometimes a 
marvel of shining wet and wind-cleared atmosphere, sometimes a 
mystery of drifting fog, sometimes a miracle of crowded details, 
minutely fine.
<P>
As I think of that view, so variously spacious in effect, I am back 
there, and this sunlit paper might be lamp-lit and lying on my old 
desk.  I see it all again, feel it all again.  In the foreground is 
a green shaded lamp and crumpled galley slips and paged proofs and 
letters, two or three papers in manuscript, and so forth.  In the 
shadows are chairs and another table bearing papers and books, a 
rotating bookcase dimly seen, a long window seat black in the 
darkness, and then the cool unbroken spectacle of the window.  How 
often I would watch some tram-car, some string of barges go from me 
slowly out of sight.  The people were black animalculae by day, 
clustering, collecting, dispersing, by night, they were phantom 
face-specks coming, vanishing, stirring obscurely between light and 
shade.

I recall many hours at my desk in that room before the crisis came, 
hours full of the peculiar happiness of effective strenuous work.  
Once some piece of writing went on, holding me intent and forgetful 
of time until I looked up from the warm circle of my electric lamp 
to see the eastward sky above the pale silhouette of the Tower 
Bridge, flushed and banded brightly with the dawn.
