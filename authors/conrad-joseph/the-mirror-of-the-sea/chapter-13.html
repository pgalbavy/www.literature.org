<p> <em>THERE </em>has been a time when a ship’s chief mate, pocket-book
in hand and pencil behind his ear, kept one eye aloft upon his
riggers and the other down the hatchway on the stevedores, and
watched the disposition of his ship’s cargo, knowing that even
before she started he was already doing his best to secure for
her an easy and quick passage.</p>

<p>The hurry of the times, the loading and discharging organization
of the docks, the use of hoisting machinery which works quickly
and will not wait, the cry for prompt despatch, the very size
of his ship, stand nowadays between the modern seaman and the
thorough knowledge of his craft.</p>

<p>There are profitable ships and unprofitable ships.  The profitable
ship will carry a large load through all the hazards of the weather,
and, when at rest, will stand up in dock and shift from berth
to berth without ballast.  There is a point of perfection in a
ship as a worker when she is spoken of as being able to <em>sail</em>
without ballast.  I have never met that sort of paragon myself,
but I have seen these paragons advertised amongst ships for sale. 
Such excess of virtue and good-nature on the part of a ship always
provoked my mistrust.  It is open to any man to say that his ship
will sail without ballast; and he will say it, too, with every
mark of profound conviction, especially if he is not going to
sail in her himself.  The risk of advertising her as able to sail
without ballast is not great, since the statement does not imply
a warranty of her arriving anywhere.  Moreover, it is strictly
true that most ships will sail without ballast for some little
time before they turn turtle upon the crew.</p>

<p>A shipowner loves a profitable ship; the seaman is proud of her;
a doubt of her good looks seldom exists in his mind; but if he
can boast of her more useful qualities it is an added satisfaction
for his self-love.</p>

<p>The loading of ships was once a matter of skill, judgment, and
knowledge. Thick books have been written about it.  "Stevens on
Stowage" is a portly volume with the renown and weight (in its
own world) of Coke on Littleton.  Stevens is an agreeable writer,
and, as is the case with men of talent, his gifts adorn his sterling
soundness.  He gives you the official teaching on the whole subject,
is precise as to rules, mentions illustrative events, quotes law
cases where verdicts turned upon a point of stowage.  He is never
pedantic, and, for all his close adherence to broad principles,
he is ready to admit that no two ships can be treated exactly
alike.</p>

<p>Stevedoring, which had been a skilled labour, is fast becoming
a labour without the skill.  The modern steamship with her many
holds is not loaded within the sailor-like meaning of the word. 
She is filled up. Her cargo is not stowed in any sense; it is
simply dumped into her through six hatchways, more or less, by
twelve winches or so, with clatter and hurry and racket and heat,
in a cloud of steam and a mess of coal-dust.  As long as you keep
her propeller under water and take care, say, not to fling down
barrels of oil on top of bales of silk, or deposit an iron bridge-girder
of five ton or so upon a bed of coffee-bags, you have done about
all in the way of duty that the cry for prompt despatch will allow
you to do.</p>
