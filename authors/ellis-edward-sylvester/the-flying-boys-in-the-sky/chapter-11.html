<p>Bohunkus Johnson was never so angry in his life and the resentment
of Harvey Hamilton was equally intense. That a man should deliberately
shoot at their machine without provocation more than a bit of
harmless mischief, was beyond bearing. The colored youth stood
up and shouted to his friend:</p>

<p>"I’m gwine to jump! I’ll teach him sumfin!"</p>

<p>"Wait one moment," replied Harvey, as he shut off power and hastily
dropped to earth. His momentum carried him several rods beyond
the young man, who was still busy reloading his gun. Fortunately
for our friends it was of the old-fashioned muzzle pattern, and
required more time than the modern weapon. He roared with an oath:</p>

<p>"I’ll larn you better than to go skyugling over the country and
trying to scare folks to death. Jes’ wait till I git my gun loaded
agin!"</p>

<p>But neither Harvey nor Bohunkus had any intention of waiting.
Before the machine came to a rest, the colored youth leaped to
the ground and broke into a run for the man, who held his position.</p>

<p>"Yo’s gwine to larn me something, am yo’? Wal, dis am de time
to begin!"</p>

<p>"Sail into him, Bunk!" shouted Harvey, "and if you need any help,
I’ll give it!"</p>

<p>"All yo’ got to do am to keep out ob dis bus’ness; I’m running
dis funeral," replied the African, without shifting his gaze from
the young farmer, who could not have been much older than Bohunkus.
Not once did the latter check his pace, but dashed at full speed
at the man. The instant he was within reach, he landed a blow
that sent the other spinning backward, with his feet pointing
upward and the weapon hurled from his grasp.</p>

<p>It was not a knockout, however, and the fellow was game. He bounded
up again as if made of rubber, and charged in turn upon his assailant.
Bohunkus had little "science," but he had been in many bouts,
and was as strong as a bull. He braced himself to receive the
attack, which came the next instant. A clenched fist landed on
his jaw with a force that nearly carried him off his feet, and
then the two went at it hammer and tongs, with no apparent advantage
at first on either side.</p>

<p>Harvey, seeing that his machine was unharmed, watched the fight.
Nothing would have suited him better than to take Bunk’s place,
for he had been taught boxing by a professional and he knew, though
he might not have been so big or strong as his comrade, that he
could readily vanquish the awkward but powerful fighter. Coolness,
straight hitting and skilful parrying would do the business. He
did not mean to stand idly by and see Bunk maltreated, but it
would not be sportsmanlike to break in unless to stop the struggle.</p>

<p>The countryman was tough and wiry, and it is doubtful how the
fight would have ended had it depended upon fists alone, but in
one respect Bunk was much the other’s superior. He was known as
the best wrestler in the neighborhood of his home. When nearly
a score of blows had been exchanged, the negro rushed in, grasped
his antagonist about the waist, lifted him clear of the ground,
and flung him on his back with a violence that it seemed must
have jarred his teeth. Before he could spring to his feet again,
Bunk was across his chest and evening up things in the most impressive
style that can be imagined.</p>

<p>Suddenly the victim shouted at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Bill! Sam! Dick! Tom! Hurry up and part us afore we kill each
other!"</p>

<p>This was a strange appeal and puzzled Harvey, who was disposed
to think it was simply a bluff. The victim was too proud to beg
for mercy, and tried to scare off his assailant. Harvey stepped
forward, picked up the partially loaded gun from the ground, and
with several quick stamps of his shoe so broke the two hammers
that the weapon became useless for the time.</p>

<p>"That will prevent his using it against us," was the thought
of our young friend, who again turned his attention to the combatants
on the ground.</p>

<p>"Don’t be too hard on him, Bunk; I guess he’s had enough."</p>

<p>"Why doan’ he holler ‘<em>’nough</em>!’ den? dat’s what I’m waitin’
fur."</p>

<p>The victim had ceased his outcries, and was desperately trying
to writhe free and roll off the burden, but his master couldn’t
be shaken from his perch.</p>

<p>"Why doan’ yo’ holler like a gemman oughter do when he’s had
’nough? Holloa!"</p>

<p>When Harvey Hamilton thought the fellow was merely bluffing by
his calls for help, he made a mistake. From out of the wood came
running a man larger and older than any one of the three, and
he was followed by a second, third and fourth,—all full grown,
massive, muscular and each with fire in his eye. They had heard
the cry of their comrade in extremity and made haste to come to
his help.</p>

<p>Their arrival caused a change of program. Much as I like Bohunkus
Johnson (and I trust that you, too, share the feeling), I am obliged
to confess that like many of his race he had a tinge of yellow
in his composition. So long as he held the upper hand, or so long
as the fight was in doubt, he displayed courage, but the arrival
of reinforcements threw him into a panic. He whisked off the prostrate
figure, leaped to his feet and dashed at his highest speed into
the woods. He ran like a person whose life was in danger, and
the young man who had suffered at his hands sped after him, breathing
threatenings and slaughter.</p>

<p>The new arrivals, who had been referred to as Bill, Sam, Dick
and Tom, were evidently young farmers, none more than twenty-five
years old. They had sturdy frames and could have given a good
account of themselves in a physical struggle. They must have been
mystified by what they saw, for the one who had dashed off in
pursuit of Bohunkus had not paused to make explanation.</p>

<p>One fact was a vast relief to Harvey Hamilton: none of them carried
a weapon, though it may be thought the quartet did not need anything
of the kind in order to work their will with the slim active youth.
The latter, with a quickness of resource which would have done
credit to one older than himself, picked up the discarded shotgun
at his feet, covering the lock as he did so with one hand in order
to hide the harm it had suffered. So long as the others believed
it sound and loaded, he could command the situation.</p>

<p>"Say, you," said the tallest of the quartette in a loud voice,
"what’s the meaning of this row? We don’t exactly git the hang
of things."</p>

<p>Facing the group and with his back toward the biplane, Harvey
answered:</p>

<p>"Your friend had a misunderstanding with my friend, and it doesn’t
seem to be settled yet, though it looks as if yours had the advantage."</p>

<p>"What was the quarrel about?"</p>

<p>"Your friend—"</p>

<p>"That’s Herb," interrupted the other speaker.</p>

<p>"Herb fired his gun at us without any cause."</p>

<p>"Yes; we heerd it; if he didn’t have any cause, what was the
reason he took a shot at you?"</p>

<p>"Pure cussedness is all I can think of."</p>

<p>"Didn’t he hit either of you?"</p>

<p>"He grazed my face; we came down to ask an explanation, and my
colored companion was giving him a good pummeling, when you came
up and scared him away."</p>

<p>"I take it, stranger, that that contraption over there is one
of them infarnal flying machines."</p>

<p>"It is a flying machine, but there’s nothing infernal about it."</p>

<p>"Folks hain’t no bus’ness to cavort round the country in them."</p>

<p>"I don’t see why they haven’t; we are not injuring you or any
one else."</p>

<p>"Boys," said the speaker, turning to his companions who were
standing near and listening to the conversation; "the best thing
we can do is to rip the blamed thing to slathers. What do you
say?"</p>

<p>"Them’s our sentiments," replied one while the three nodded.</p>

<p>"Come on then; it won’t take us long to make kindling wood of
it."</p>

<p>He took a step forward, and then stopped. Harvey had leveled
the gun.</p>

<p>"The first one that lays a hand on my aeroplane must be prepared
to have daylight let through him."</p>

<p>It was a staggering threat, but in the trying moment, Harvey
Hamilton could not help reflecting that the weapon was not only
injured, but unloaded. He would be in a sorry situation should
they learn the truth.</p>

<p>The strained situation could not last, and he slowly backed toward
the machine, holding the weapon in front, ready to be raised again
to a level should it become necessary.</p>

<p>"Four of you are rather too much for me," he said with a grim
smile.</p>

<p>"Hooh! One of us could lay you out as easy as rolling off a log."</p>

<p>"I am willing to take you one at a time, but I know that as soon
as I get the best of him the rest of you will pitch in and do
me up."</p>

<p>It was "Bill" who was talking for the four. He grinned and with
a snort replied:</p>

<p>"I’d ax nothing better than one crack at you, but there ain’t
no show with that loaded gun in your hands; nobody but a coward
would use that."</p>

<p>"Then you may consider me a coward, for I am on to your tricks."</p>

<p>By this time Harvey had reached his machine, but the problem
remained as to how he could seat himself and start the motor without
inviting an attack that must overwhelm him and wreck his property.
He stood for a minute undecided, while his enemies, less than
a dozen paces away, were on the alert for a chance to seize any
advantage that offered.</p>

<p>Suddenly the young aviator stepped into his seat, but, standing
upright, faced about and confronted them still with gun in hand.
They showed an ugly disposition at the prospect of his eluding
them, but seemingly there was no way to prevent it.</p>

<p>"If you would like a closer view," Harvey said, "I have no objection,
but you must come one at a time. You may do so first."</p>

<p>He indicated Bill, who hesitated:</p>

<p>"No shenanigan!"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, I promise you."</p>

<p>After a moment’s pause, he gingerly approached, but showed he
was not wholly free from misgiving.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that big wheel?" asked Harvey.</p>

<p>"Hooh! seems to be made of black walnut," replied the other,
laying a hand on one of the propeller blades.</p>

<p>"So it is; have you enough muscle to turn it round?"</p>

<p>"That’s dead easy," replied Bill, grasping one of the arms and
whirling it about with double the force that was necessary. </p>
