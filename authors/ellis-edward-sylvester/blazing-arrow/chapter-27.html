<p>The boys kept such a close watch on the Shawanoe that the moment
he signalled them to stop they obeyed. Although he assumed his
favorite attitude while doing so, he instantly faced about so
that his back was toward them. There could be no doubt that he
had made some important discovery.</p>

<p>The youths stood still in the trail, Wharton slightly in advance;
but Larry was near enough to his side to note every movement of
the singular being who had been acting as their guide ever since
the rise of the sun.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he means us to stand right here or to dodge
behind the trees, as we did before?" remarked Larry.</p>

<p>"We shall know, for he will tell us. There it is!"</p>

<p>Arqu-wao at this moment made a peculiar sweep of the hand holding
the bow, which was interpreted as an order for them to screen
themselves from sight. They did so with the cleverness of a short
time before. Nothing to explain the cause for this caution appeared,
and the lads kept their eyes on the Indian in whose hands they
had placed their lives before this critical moment.</p>

<p>The tree trunks which sheltered them were not more rigid and
motionless for the next five minutes than he. Then he was seen
to take a single step forward, when he again paused. A second
followed with the same deliberation as before, and the advance
continued, foot by foot, until the intervening trees and the turn
in the trail shut the guide from sight.</p>

<p>"We're near the clearing where I had my race with Blazing Arrow,"
remarked Wharton, in a guarded voice.</p>

<p>"Ye may have anither one with him."</p>

<p>"It isn't likely, but I believe he isn't far off."</p>

<p>"And the others are with him."</p>

<p>"Of course, and more than likely father and mother are near.
Oh, I do hope that they will find out their danger soon enough
to save themselves; but I fear the worst."</p>

<p>"Do ye hear that?"</p>

<p>The faces of the youths blanched, for at that moment the sharp
crack of a rifle rang out in the stillness. It was near at hand,
and was followed by a wild cry, which, echoing through the forest
arches, left the silence more oppressive than before.</p>

<p>"Somebody is killed!" whispered the frightened Wharton.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt ye; but that yell wasn't a white man's."</p>

<p>"Then the shot must have been."</p>

<p>"I don't know the same; mebbe Blazing Arrow has found out what
Arqu-wao has been doing and shot him."</p>

<p>"I believe that is what has happened; they had a quarrel when
they met in the trail; why didn't Blazing Arrow kill him then?"</p>

<p>"He didn't know as much then as he does now; he has seen the
thracks of oursilves along the path after the two parted, and
then the whole thruth come upon him."</p>

<p>"I wish we could have the chance to save the poor crazy fellow,
for he has given his life for us&mdash;that is, if he has been shot
by any of his people."</p>

<p>"We don't know that he is dead yit; mebbe he managed to use his
bow and arrow, and didn't miss, while the other chap as used his
gun did, so the yell was the other fellow's."</p>

<p>"We ought to have given him back his knife and tomahawk; I didn't
think of it, or we would have done so."</p>

<p>"It couldn't have done him any good in this sort of rumpus."</p>

<p>Some tragedy had been enacted so near them that the youths might
well shudder for themselves as well as for their friends.</p>

<p>The sultry summer day was well along. The sun, high in the sky,
penetrated the woods with its warmth, and in the broad open plain
the heat must have been oppressive. Here and there a tiny bird
fluttered among the trees, and suddenly a noble buck came striding
along as if he meant to follow the trail to the falls for a drink,
but, catching sight of the two young men standing beside the trees
weapon in hand, he wheeled and was off in a twinkling, though
not before either one of the lads could have gained the best kind
of a shot had he dared to fire.</p>

<p>Minute after minute passed, and still there was no sign of the
returning guide. The young friends would have been glad to believe
he had escaped, but the fleeting minutes caused their hope to
sink lower and lower, until at last it was gone.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Wharton, "that we are throwing away time
by standing here; we shall never see Arqu-wao again."</p>

<p>"I agree with ye; the rest of 'em are miles off, and we might
stay here till the sun went down and that's all the good it would
do us."</p>

<p>Thump! and the startled boys, turning their heads, saw a stone,
weighing fully a pound, that must have been thrown by some person
at them. This was a curious proceeding by whomsoever done; but
the explanation came the next moment, when a tall, finely formed
figure, clad in the costume of the border ranger, stepped from
behind a tree and motioned to them to make no noise.</p>

<p>The astonished and delighted boys recognized the individual as
Simon Kenton, the most famous scout, not excepting Daniel Boone,
known in Ohio and Kentucky. He had approached them from the rear,
and announced his coming in this characteristic manner.</p>

<p>"Yer needn't be afeared, younkers," he said, as he came up, "provided
yer don't speak too loud. The varmints are powerful plenty yerabouts.
Howdy?"</p>

<p>He shook the hand of each in turn, and Wharton asked:</p>

<p>"Where did you come from, Kenton?"</p>

<p>"The block-house."</p>

<p>"How long ago did you leave?"</p>

<p>"Shortly after sun-up; it isn't very fur, and I've travelled
powerful fast."</p>

<p>Wharton yearned to ask the question that was on the tip of his
tongue, but an awful fear held it back.</p>

<p>"We heard a rifle awhile ago; do you know anything about it?"</p>

<p>"I reckon," replied the ranger with a significant grin, "bein'
as I was the chap that touched her off."</p>

<p>"At whom did you fire?"</p>

<p>"Why don't ye ask who did I hit, for when that piece speaks I
reckon some one is hit. Did you hear him yell?"</p>

<p>"We might have heard the chap a mile off," replied Larry. "Was
the same Blazing Arrow."</p>

<p>"No; I am sorry to say he kept out of the way, and I picked off
the one that was nearest to him."</p>

<p>"Did you see anything of an Indian with a bow and arrow?"</p>

<p>"You mean Arqu-wao, or, as we call him, Red Crow."</p>

<p>"That must be the one. Why does he have such a strange name?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a red crow, younkers?"</p>

<p>"No; and I never saw a person that has seen one."</p>

<p>"And you never will; such a thing would be powerful qu'ar, but
he wouldn't be any qu'arer than the varmint that Boone, M'Cleland,
the Wetzel boys and some of the others have given the name to.
He's a bit off, ain't 'zactly right here," added the scout, tapping
his forehead. "Have you had anything to do with him?"</p>

<p>Wharton related in as few words as possible their experience
with the strange creature, and asked:</p>

<p>"Has he always been that way?"</p>

<p>"No; his brother and him had a big fight when they were on the
warpath. His brother was older and stronger, and threw him down
among the rocks in such a way that his head was hurt and he was
never right afterwards. He has lived by himself along that lake
over yender for ten or a dozen years. He won't have anybody with
him; you know how the Injuns look on such a person; they think
he's a little different and better than other folks and none of
'em will harm him. Of course none of the boys would hurt a hair
of his head, though he's quick enough with his bow and arrer to
shoot any one that comes pokin' round his place. It's powerful
qu'ar that he acted the part of a friend toward you, but thar's
no sayin' what crank may come into the head of such a person."</p>

<p>"But he had a quarrel with Blazing Arrow, who seemed on the point
of striking him."</p>

<p>"That's nateral, for you know you hate anyone that you've already
done an injury to."</p>

<p>"Has Blazing Arrow ever injured him?"</p>

<p>"Why, he's the one that throwed him over the rock; him and Blazing
Arrow are full brothers."</p>

<p>This was surprising news to both, and Larry said:</p>

<p>"He once mentioned the name of that chap as his brother, but
I didn't think that was what he meant."</p>

<p>"I don't think the Red Crow loves his brother any more than his
brother loves him. Some time thar'll be the biggest kind of a
fight between 'em. They don't often meet, but when they do they
allers strike fire."</p>

<p>"How was it, Kenton, that you came to shoot awhile ago?"</p>

<p>"One of the varmints got in my way, and if you know of any better
plan for heavin' him out, let me hear it."</p>

<p>"But you don't explain; did you see anything of Red Crow?"</p>

<p>"You asked me awhile ago, and I beg pardon for not answerin'.
No, I haven't seen him lately, that is, for the last few weeks;
but while I was out yender, just on t'other side of the ravine,
whar the trail makes a sharp turn, I catched sight of one of the
varmints stealin' along as though he was lookin' for somethin'.
He catched sight of me at the same time. We had not time to dodge
behind anything, and it was a question which could aim and fire
the quickest. Wal," added Kenton, with a sigh of complacency,
"mebbe thar's a varmint somewhar that can do that thing quicker'n
me, but I haven't met him yet."</p>

<p>"But you say you saw Blazing Arrow?"</p>

<p>"Yas, and another of the redskins; they war some way ahead, and
the trees war so plenty that we couldn't draw bead. I waited for
'em to come nigher, but they didn't seem to be lookin' for that
sort of thing just then, and they scooted t'other way. I 'spect
I'll meet 'em agin purty soon, and I'm ready."</p>
