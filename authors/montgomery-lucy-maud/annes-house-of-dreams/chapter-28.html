"I've been reading obituary notices," said Miss
Cornelia, laying down the Daily Enterprise and taking
up her sewing.
<P>
The harbor was lying black and sullen under a dour
November sky; the wet, dead leaves clung drenched and
sodden to the window sills; but the little house was
gay with firelight and spring-like with Anne's ferns
and geraniums.
<P>
"It's always summer here, Anne," Leslie had said one
day; and all who were the guests of that house of
dreams felt the same.
<P>
"The Enterprise seems to run to obituaries these
days," quoth Miss Cornelia.  "It always has a couple
of columns of them, and I read every line.  It's one of
my forms of recreation, especially when there's some
original poetry attached to them.  Here's a choice
sample for you:
<P>
    She's gone to be with her Maker,     Never more to
roam.     She used to play and sing with joy     The
song of Home, Sweet Home.
<P>
Who says we haven't any poetical talent on the Island! 
Have you ever noticed what heaps of good people die,
Anne, dearie?  It's kind of pitiful.  Here's ten
obituaries, and every one of them saints and models,
even the men.  Here's old Peter Stimson, who has `left
a large circle of friends to mourn his untimely loss.' 
Lord, Anne, dearie, that man was eighty, and everybody
who knew him had been wishing him dead these thirty
years.  Read obituaries when you're blue, Anne,
dearie--especially the ones of folks you know.  If
you've any sense of humor at all they'll cheer you up,
believe ME.  I just wish _I_ had the writing of the
obituaries of some people.  Isn't `obituary' an awful
ugly word?  This very Peter I've been speaking of had a
face exactly like one.  I never saw it but I thought of
the word OBITUARY then and there.  There's only one
uglier word that I know of, and that's RELICT.  Lord,
Anne, dearie, I may be an old maid, but there's this
comfort in it--I'll never be any man's `relict.'"
<P>
"It IS an ugly word," said Anne, laughing.  "Avonlea
graveyard was full of old tombstones `sacred to the
memory of So-and-So, RELICT of the late So-and-So.'  It
always made me think of something worn out and moth
eaten.  Why is it that so many of the words connected
with death are so disagreeable?  I do wish that the
custom of calling a dead body `the remains' could be
abolished.  I positively shiver when I hear the
undertaker say at a funeral, `All who wish to see the
remains please step this way.'  It always gives me the
horrible impression that I am about to view the scene
of a cannibal feast."
<P>
"Well, all I hope," said Miss Cornelia calmly, "is
that when I'm dead nobody will call me `our departed
sister.'  I took a scunner at this
sister-and-brothering business five years ago when
there was a travelling evangelist holding meetings at
the Glen.  I hadn't any use for him from the start.  I
felt in my bones that there was something wrong with
him.  And there was.  Mind you, he was pretending to be
a Presbyterian--PresbyTARian, HE called it--and all the
time he was a Methodist.  He brothered and sistered
everybody.  He had a large circle of relations, that
man had.  He clutched my hand fervently one night, and
said imploringly, `My DEAR sister Bryant, are you a
Christian?'  I just looked him over a bit, and then I
said calmly, `The only brother I ever had, MR. Fiske,
was buried fifteen years ago, and I haven't adopted any
since.  As for being a Christian, I was that, I hope
and believe, when you were crawling about the floor in
petticoats.'  THAT squelched him, believe ME.  Mind
you, Anne dearie, I'm not down on all evangelists. 
We've had some real fine, earnest men, who did a lot of
good and made the old sinners squirm.  But this
Fiske-man wasn't one of them.  I had a good laugh all
to myself one evening.  Fiske had asked all who were
Christians to stand up.  _I_ didn't, believe me!  I
never had any use for that sort of thing.  But most of
them did, and then he asked all who wanted to be
Christians to stand up.  Nobody stirred for a spell, so
Fiske started up a hymn at the top of his voice.  Just
in front of me poor little Ikey Baker was sitting in
the Millison pew.  He was a home boy, ten years old,
and Millison just about worked him to death.  The poor
little creature was always so tired he fell asleep
right off whenever he went to church or anywhere he
could sit still for a few minutes.  He'd been sleeping
all through the meeting, and I was thankful to see the
poor child getting a rest, believe ME.  Well, when
Fiske's voice went soaring skyward and the rest joined
in, poor Ikey wakened with a start.  He thought it was
just an ordinary singing and that everybody ought to
stand up, so he scrambled to his feet mighty quick,
knowing he'd get a combing down from Maria Millison for
sleeping in meeting.  Fiske saw him, stopped and
shouted, `Another soul saved!  Glory Hallelujah!'  And
there was poor, frightened Ikey, only half awake and
yawning, never thinking about his soul at all.  Poor
child, he never had time to think of anything but his
tired, overworked little body.
<P>
"Leslie went one night and the Fiske-man got right
after her--oh, he was especially anxious about the
souls of the nice-looking girls, believe me!--and he
hurt her feelings so she never went again.  And then he
prayed every night after that, right in public, that
the Lord would soften her hard heart.  Finally I went
to Mr. Leavitt, our minister then, and told him if he
didn't make Fiske stop that I'd just rise up the next
night and throw my hymn book at him when he mentioned
that `beautiful but unrepentant young woman.'  I'd have
done it too, believe ME.  Mr. Leavitt did put a stop to
it, but Fiske kept on with his meetings until Charley
Douglas put an end to his career in the Glen.  Mrs.
Charley had been out in California all winter.  She'd
been real melancholy in the fall--religious
melancholy--it ran in her family.  Her father worried
so much over believing that he had committed the
unpardonable sin that he died in the asylum.  So when
Rose Douglas got that way Charley packed her off to
visit her sister in Los Angeles.  She got perfectly
well and came home just when the Fiske revival was in
full swing.  She stepped off the train at the Glen,
real smiling and chipper, and the first thing she saw
staring her in the face on the black, gable-end of the
freight shed, was the question, in big white letters,
two feet high, `Whither goest thou--to heaven or hell?' 
That had been one of Fiske's ideas, and he had got
Henry Hammond to paint it.  Rose just gave a shriek and
fainted; and when they got her home she was worse than
ever.  Charley Douglas went to Mr. Leavitt and told him
that every Douglas would leave the church if Fiske was
kept there any longer.  Mr. Leavitt had to give in, for
the Douglases paid half his salary, so Fiske departed,
and we had to depend on our Bibles once more for
instructions on how to get to heaven.  After he was
gone Mr. Leavitt found out he was just a masquerading
Methodist, and he felt pretty sick, believe ME.  Mr.
Leavitt fell short in some ways, but he was a good,
sound Presbyterian."
<P>
"By the way, I had a letter from Mr. Ford yesterday,"
said Anne.  "He asked me to remember him kindly to
you."
<P>
"I don't want his remembrances," said Miss Cornelia,
curtly.
<P>
"Why?" said Anne, in astonishment.  "I thought you
liked him."
<P>
"Well, so I did, in a kind of way.  But I'll never
forgive him for what he done to Leslie.  There's that
poor child eating her heart out about him--as if she
hadn't had trouble enough--and him ranting round
Toronto, I've no doubt, enjoying himself same as ever. 
Just like a man."
<P>
"Oh, Miss Cornelia, how did you find out?"
<P>
"Lord, Anne, dearie, I've got eyes, haven't I?  And
I've known Leslie since she was a baby .  There's been
a new kind of heartbreak in her eyes all the fall, and
I know that writer-man was behind it somehow.  I'll
never forgive myself for being the means of bringing
him here.  But I never expected he'd be like he was.  I
thought he'd just be like the other men Leslie had
boarded--conceited young asses, every one of them, that
she never had any use for.  One of them did try to
flirt with her once and she froze him out--so bad, I
feel sure he's never got himself thawed since.  So I
never thought of any danger."
<P>
"Don't let Leslie suspect you know her secret," said
Anne hurriedly.  "I think it would hurt her."
<P>
"Trust me, Anne, dearie.  _I_ wasn't born yesterday. 
Oh, a plague on all the men!  One of them ruined
Leslie's life to begin with, and now another of the
tribe comes and makes her still more wretched.  Anne,
this world is an awful place, believe me."
<P>
    "There's something in the world amiss     Will be
unriddled by and by,"
<P>
quoted Anne dreamily.
<P>
"If it is, it'll be in a world where there aren't any
men," said Miss Cornelia gloomily.
<P>
"What have the men been doing now?" asked Gilbert,
entering.
<P>
"Mischief--mischief!  What else did they ever do?"
<P>
"It was Eve ate the apple, Miss Cornelia."
<P>
" 'Twas a he-creature tempted her," retorted Miss
Cornelia triumphantly.
<P>
Leslie, after her first anguish was over, found it
possible to go on with life after all, as most of us
do, no matter what our particular form of torment has
been.  It is even possible that she enjoyed moments of
it, when she was one of the gay circle in the little
house of dreams.  But if Anne ever hoped that she was
forgetting Owen Ford she would have been undeceived by
the furtive hunger in Leslie's eyes whenever his name
was mentioned.  Pitiful to that hunger, Anne always
contrived to tell Captain Jim or Gilbert bits of news
from Owen's letters when Leslie was with them.  The
girl's flush and pallor at such moments spoke all too
eloquently of the emotion that filled her being.  But
she never spoke of him to Anne, or mentioned that night
on the sand-bar.
<P>
One day her old dog died and she grieved bitterly over
him.
<P>
"He's been my friend so long," she said sorrowfully to
Anne.  "He was Dick's old dog, you know--Dick had him
for a year or so before we were married.  He left him
with me when he sailed on the Four Sisters.  Carlo got
very fond of me--and his dog-love helped me through
that first dreadful year after mother died, when I was
alone.  When I heard that Dick was coming back I was
afraid Carlo wouldn't be so much mine.  But he never
seemed to care for Dick, though he had been so fond of
him once.  He would snap and growl at him as if he were
a stranger.  I was glad.  It was nice to have one thing
whose love was all mine.  That old dog has been such a
comfort to me, Anne.  He got so feeble in the fall that
I was afraid he couldn't live long--but I hoped I could
nurse him through the winter.  He seemed pretty well
this morning.  He was lying on the rug before the fire;
then, all at once, he got up and crept over to me; he
put his head on my lap and gave me one loving look out
of his big, soft, dog eyes--and then he just shivered
and died.  I shall miss him so."
<P>
"Let me give you another dog, Leslie," said Anne . 
"I'm getting a lovely Gordon setter for a Christmas
present for Gilbert.  Let me give you one too."
<P>
Leslie shook her head.
<P>
"Not just now, thank you, Anne.  I don't feel like
having another dog yet.  I don't seem to have any
affection left for another.  Perhaps--in time--I'll let
you give me one.  I really need one as a kind of
protection.  But there was something almost human about
Carlo-- it wouldn't be DECENT to fill his place too
hurriedly, dear old fellow ."
<P>
Anne went to Avonlea a week before Christmas and stayed
until after the holidays.  Gilbert came up for her, and
there was a glad New Year celebration at Green Gables,
when Barrys and Blythes and Wrights assembled to devour
a dinner which had cost Mrs. Rachel and Marilla much
careful thought and preparation.  When they went back
to Four Winds the little house was almost drifted over,
for the third storm of a winter that was to prove
phenomenally stormy had whirled up the harbor and
heaped huge snow mountains about everything it
encountered.  But Captain Jim had shovelled out doors
and paths, and Miss Cornelia had come down and kindled
the hearth-fire.
<P>
"It's good to see you back, Anne, dearie!  But did you
ever see such drifts?  You can't see the Moore place at
all unless you go upstairs.  Leslie'll be so glad
you're back.  She's almost buried alive over there. 
Fortunately Dick can shovel snow, and thinks it's great
fun.  Susan sent me word to tell you she would be on
hand tomorrow.  Where are you off to now, Captain?"
<P>
"I reckon I'll plough up to the Glen and sit a bit with
old Martin Strong.  He's not far from his end and he's
lonesome.  He hasn't many friends--been too busy all
his life to make any.  He's made heaps of money,
though."
<P>
"Well, he thought that since he couldn't serve God and
Mammon he'd better stick to Mammon," said Miss
Cornelia crisply.  "So he shouldn't complain if he
doesn't find Mammon very good company now."
<P>
Captain Jim went out, but remembered something in the
yard and turned back for a moment.
<P>
"I'd a letter from Mr. Ford, Mistress Blythe, and he
says the life-book is accepted and is going to be
published next fall.  I felt fair uplifted when I got
the news.  To think that I'm to see it in print at
last."
<P>
"That man is clean crazy on the subject of his
life-book," said Miss Cornelia compassionately.  "For
my part, I think there's far too many books in the
world now."
