<p>He was not unhappy in the pit.  He was admired by the men, and well
enough liked.  It was only he himself who felt the difference
between himself and the others.  He seemed to hide his own stigma.
But he was never sure that the others did not really despise him
for a ninny, as being less a man than they were.  Only he pretended
to be more manly, and was surprised by the ease with which they
were deceived.  And, being naturally cheerful, he was happy at his
work.  He was sure of himself there.  Naked to the waist, hot and
grimy with labour, they squatted on their heels for a few minutes
and talked, seeing each other dimly by the light of the safety
lamps, while the black coal rose jutting round them, and the props
of wood stood like little pillars in the low, black, very dark
temple.  Then the pony came and the gang-lad with a message from
Number 7, or with a bottle of water from the horse-trough or some
news of the world above.  The day passed pleasantly enough.  There
was an ease, a go-as-you-please about the day underground, a
delightful camaraderie of men shut off alone from the rest of the
world, in a dangerous place, and a variety of labour, holing,
loading, timbering, and a glamour of mystery and adventure in the
atmosphere, that made the pit not unattractive to him when he had
again got over his anguish of desire for the open air and the sea.</p>

<p>This day there was much to do and Durant was not in humour to talk.
He went on working in silence through the afternoon.</p>

<p>&quot;Loose-all&quot; came, and they tramped to the bottom.  The whitewashed
underground office shone brightly.  Men were putting out their
lamps.  They sat in dozens round the bottom of the shaft, down
which black, heavy drops of water fell continuously into the sump.
The electric lights shone away down the main underground road.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it raining?&quot; asked Durant.</p>

<p>&quot;Snowing,&quot; said an old man, and the younger was pleased.  He liked
to go up when it was snowing.</p>

<p>&quot;It'll just come right for Christmas,&quot; said the old man.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; replied Durant.</p>

<p>&quot;A green Christmas, a fat churchyard,&quot; said the other
sententiously.</p>

<p>Durant laughed, showing his small, rather pointed teeth.</p>

<p>The cage came down, a dozen men lined on.  Durant noticed tufts of
snow on the perforated, arched roof of the chain, and he was
pleased.</p>

<p>He wondered how it liked its excursion underground.  But already it
was getting soppy with black water.</p>

<p>He liked things about him.  There was a little smile on his face.
But underlying it was the curious consciousness he felt in himself.</p>

<p>The upper world came almost with a flash, because of the glimmer of
snow.  Hurrying along the bank, giving up his lamp at the office,
he smiled to feel the open about him again, all glimmering round
him with snow.  The hills on either side were pale blue in the
dusk, and the hedges looked savage and dark.  The snow was trampled
between the railway lines.  But far ahead, beyond the black figures
of miners moving home, it became smooth again, spreading right up
to the dark wall of the coppice.</p>

<p>To the west there was a pinkness, and a big star hovered half
revealed.  Below, the lights of the pit came out crisp and yellow
among the darkness of the buildings, and the lights of Old
Aldecross twinkled in rows down the bluish twilight.</p>

<p>Durant walked glad with life among the miners, who were all talking
animatedly because of the snow.  He liked their company, he liked
the white dusky world.  It gave him a little thrill to stop at the
garden gate and see the light of home down below, shining on the
silent blue snow.</p>
