<p>'We shan't be able to go anywhere on the carpet for a whole week,
though,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'And I'm glad of it,' said Jane, unexpectedly.</p>

<p>'Glad?' said Cyril; 'GLAD?'</p>

<p>It was breakfast-time, and mother's letter, telling them how they
were all going for Christmas to their aunt's at Lyndhurst, and how
father and mother would meet them there, having been read by every
one, lay on the table, drinking hot bacon-fat with one corner and
eating marmalade with the other.</p>

<p>'Yes, glad,' said Jane.  'I don't want any more things to happen
just now.  I feel like you do when you've been to three parties in
a week - like we did at granny's once - and extras in between, toys
and chocs and things like that.  I want everything to be just real,
and no fancy things happening at all.'
'I don't like being obliged to keep things from mother,' said
Anthea.  'I don't know why, but it makes me feel selfish and mean.'</p>

<p>'If we could only get the mater to believe it, we might take her to
the jolliest places,' said Cyril, thoughtfully.  'As it is, we've
just got to be selfish and mean - if it is that - but I don't feel it
is.'</p>

<p>'I KNOW it isn't, but I FEEL it is,' said Anthea, 'and that's just
as bad.'</p>

<p>'It's worse,' said Robert; 'if you knew it and didn't feel it, it
wouldn't matter so much.'</p>

<p>'That's being a hardened criminal, father says,' put in Cyril, and
he picked up mother's letter and wiped its corners with his
handkerchief, to whose colour a trifle of bacon-fat and marmalade
made but little difference.</p>

<p>'We're going to-morrow, anyhow,' said Robert.  'Don't,' he added,
with a good-boy expression on his face - 'don't let's be ungrateful
for our blessings; don't let's waste the day in saying how horrid
it is to keep secrets from mother, when we all know Anthea tried
all she knew to give her the secret, and she wouldn't take it. 
Let's get on the carpet and have a jolly good wish.  You'll have
time enough to repent of things all next week.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Cyril, 'let's.  It's not really wrong.'</p>

<p>'Well, look here,' said Anthea.  'You know there's something about
Christmas that makes you want to be good - however little you wish
it at other times.  Couldn't we wish the carpet to take us
somewhere where we should have the chance to do some good and kind
action?  It would be an adventure just the same,' she pleaded.</p>

<p>'I don't mind,' said Cyril.  'We shan't know where we're going, and
that'll be exciting.  No one knows what'll happen.  We'd best put
on our outers in case - '</p>

<p>'We might rescue a traveller buried in the snow, like St Bernard
dogs, with barrels round our necks,' said Jane, beginning to be
interested.</p>

<p>'Or we might arrive just in time to witness a will being
signed - more tea, please,' said Robert, 'and we should see the old
man hide it away in the secret cupboard; and then, after long
years, when the rightful heir was in despair, we should lead him to
the hidden panel and - '</p>

<p>'Yes,' interrupted Anthea; 'or we might be taken to some freezing
garret in a German town, where a poor little pale, sick child - '</p>

<p>'We haven't any German money,' interrupted Cyril, 'so THAT'S no go.
What I should like would be getting into the middle of a war and
getting hold of secret intelligence and taking it to the general,
and he would make me a lieutenant or a scout, or a hussar.'</p>

<p>When breakfast was cleared away, Anthea swept the carpet, and the
children sat down on it, together with the Phoenix, who had been
especially invited, as a Christmas treat, to come with them and
witness the good and kind action they were about to do.</p>

<p>Four children and one bird were ready, and the wish was wished.</p>

<p>Every one closed its eyes, so as to feel the topsy-turvy swirl of
the carpet's movement as little as possible.</p>

<p>When the eyes were opened again the children found themselves on
the carpet, and the carpet was in its proper place on the floor of
their own nursery at Camden Town.</p>

<p>'I say,' said Cyril, 'here's a go!'</p>

<p>'Do you think it's worn out?  The wishing part of it, I mean?'
Robert anxiously asked the Phoenix.</p>

<p>'It's not that,' said the Phoenix; 'but - well - what did you
wish - ?'</p>

<p>'Oh! I see what it means,' said Robert, with deep disgust; 'it's
like the end of a fairy story in a Sunday magazine.  How perfectly
beastly!'</p>

<p>'You mean it means we can do kind and good actions where we are? 
I see.  I suppose it wants us to carry coals for the cook or make
clothes for the bare heathens.  Well, I simply won't.  And the last
day and everything.  Look here!' Cyril spoke loudly and firmly. 
'We want to go somewhere really interesting, where we have a chance
of doing something good and kind; we don't want to do it here, but
somewhere else.  See?  Now, then.'</p>

<p>The obedient carpet started instantly, and the four children and
one bird fell in a heap together, and as they fell were plunged in
perfect darkness.</p>

<p>'Are you all there?' said Anthea, breathlessly, through the black
dark.  Every one owned that it was there.</p>

<p>'Where are we?  Oh! how shivery and wet it is!  Ugh! - oh! - I've put
my hand in a puddle!'</p>

<p>'Has any one got any matches?' said Anthea, hopelessly.  She felt
sure that no one would have any.</p>

<p>It was then that Robert, with a radiant smile of triumph that was
quite wasted in the darkness, where, of course, no one could see
anything, drew out of his pocket a box of matches, struck a match
and lighted a candle - two candles.  And every one, with its mouth
open, blinked at the sudden light.</p>

<p>'Well done Bobs,' said his sisters, and even Cyril's natural
brotherly feelings could not check his admiration of Robert's
foresight.</p>

<p>'I've always carried them about ever since the lone tower day,'
said Robert, with modest pride.  'I knew we should want them some
day.  I kept the secret well, didn't I?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' said Cyril, with fine scorn.  'I found them the Sunday
after, when I was feeling in your Norfolks for the knife you
borrowed off me.  But I thought you'd only sneaked them for Chinese
lanterns, or reading in bed by.'</p>

<p>'Bobs,' said Anthea, suddenly, 'do you know where we are?  This is
the underground passage, and look there - there's the money and the
money-bags, and everything.'</p>

<p>By this time the ten eyes had got used to the light of the candles,
and no one could help seeing that Anthea spoke the truth.</p>

<p>'It seems an odd place to do good and kind acts in, though,' said
Jane.  'There's no one to do them to.'</p>

<p>'Don't you be too sure,' said Cyril; 'just round the next turning
we might find a prisoner who has languished here for years and
years, and we could take him out on our carpet and restore him to
his sorrowing friends.'</p>

<p>'Of course we could,' said Robert, standing up and holding the
candle above his head to see further off; 'or we might find the
bones of a poor prisoner and take them to his friends to be buried
properly - that's always a kind action in books, though I never
could see what bones matter.'</p>

<p>'I wish you wouldn't,' said Jane.</p>

<p>'I know exactly where we shall find the bones, too,' Robert went
on.  'You see that dark arch just along the passage?  Well, just
inside there - '</p>

<p>'If you don't stop going on like that,' said Jane, firmly, 'I shall
scream, and then I'll faint - so now then!'</p>

<p>'And <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> will, too,' said Anthea.</p>

<p>Robert was not pleased at being checked in his flight of fancy.</p>

<p>'You girls will never be great writers,' he said bitterly.  'They
just love to think of things in dungeons, and chains, and knobbly
bare human bones, and - '</p>

<p>Jane had opened her mouth to scream, but before she could decide
how you began when you wanted to faint, the golden voice of the
Phoenix spoke through the gloom.</p>

<p>'Peace!' it said; 'there are no bones here except the small but
useful sets that you have inside you.  And you did not invite me to
come out with you to hear you talk about bones, but to see you do
some good and kind action.'</p>

<p>'We can't do it here,' said Robert, sulkily.</p>

<p>'No,' rejoined the bird.  'The only thing we can do here, it seems,
is to try to frighten our little sisters.'</p>

<p>'He didn't, really, and I'm not so VERY little,' said Jane, rather
ungratefully.</p>

<p>Robert was silent.  It was Cyril who suggested that perhaps they
had better take the money and go.</p>

<p>'That wouldn't be a kind act, except to ourselves; and it wouldn't
be good, whatever way you look at it,' said Anthea, 'to take money
that's not ours.'</p>

<p>'We might take it and spend it all on benefits to the poor and
aged,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'That wouldn't make it right to steal,' said Anthea, stoutly.</p>

<p>'I don't know,' said Cyril.  They were all standing up now. 
'Stealing is taking things that belong to some one else, and
there's no one else.'</p>

<p>'It can't be stealing if - '</p>

<p>'That's right,' said Robert, with ironical approval; 'stand here
all day arguing while the candles burn out.  You'll like it awfully
when it's all dark again - and bony.'</p>

<p>'Let's get out, then,' said Anthea.  'We can argue as we go.'  So
they rolled up the carpet and went.  But when they had crept along
to the place where the passage led into the topless tower they
found the way blocked by a great stone, which they could not move.</p>

<p>'There!' said Robert.  'I hope you're satisfied!'</p>

<p>'Everything has two ends,' said the Phoenix, softly; 'even a
quarrel or a secret passage.'</p>

<p>So they turned round and went back, and Robert was made to go first
with one of the candles, because he was the one who had begun to
talk about bones.  And Cyril carried the carpet.</p>

<p>'I wish you hadn't put bones into our heads,' said Jane, as they
went along.</p>

<p>'I didn't; you always had them.  More bones than brains,' said
Robert.</p>

<p>The passage was long, and there were arches and steps and turnings
and dark alcoves that the girls did not much like passing.  The
passage ended in a flight of steps.  Robert went up them.</p>

<p>Suddenly he staggered heavily back on to the following feet of
Jane, and everybody screamed, 'Oh! what is it?'</p>

<p>'I've only bashed my head in,' said Robert, when he had groaned for
some time; 'that's all.  Don't mention it; I like it.  The stairs
just go right slap into the ceiling, and it's a stone ceiling.  You
can't do good and kind actions underneath a paving-stone.'</p>

<p>'Stairs aren't made to lead just to paving-stones as a general
rule,' said the Phoenix.  'Put your shoulder to the wheel.'</p>

<p>'There isn't any wheel,' said the injured Robert, still rubbing his
head.</p>

<p>But Cyril had pushed past him to the top stair, and was already
shoving his hardest against the stone above.  Of course, it did not
give in the least.</p>

<p>'If it's a trap-door - ' said Cyril.  And he stopped shoving and
began to feel about with his hands.</p>

<p>'Yes, there is a bolt.  I can't move it.'</p>

<p>By a happy chance Cyril had in his pocket the oil-can of his
father's bicycle; he put the carpet down at the foot of the stairs,
and he lay on his back, with his head on the top step and his feet
straggling down among his young relations, and he oiled the bolt
till the drops of rust and oil fell down on his face.  One even
went into his mouth - open, as he panted with the exertion of
keeping up this unnatural position.  Then he tried again, but still
the bolt would not move.  So now he tied his handkerchief - the one
with the bacon-fat and marmalade on it - to the bolt, and Robert's
handkerchief to that, in a reef knot, which cannot come undone
however much you pull, and, indeed, gets tighter and tighter the
more you pull it.  This must not be confused with a granny knot,
which comes undone if you look at it.  And then he and Robert
pulled, and the girls put their arms round their brothers and
pulled too, and suddenly the bolt gave way with a rusty scrunch,
and they all rolled together to the bottom of the stairs - all but
the Phoenix, which had taken to its wings when the pulling began.</p>

<p>Nobody was hurt much, because the rolled-up carpet broke their
fall; and now, indeed, the shoulders of the boys were used to some
purpose, for the stone allowed them to heave it up.  They felt it
give; dust fell freely on them.</p>

<p>'Now, then,' cried Robert, forgetting his head and his temper,
'push all together.  One, two, three!'</p>

<p>The stone was heaved up.  It swung up on a creaking, unwilling
hinge, and showed a growing oblong of dazzling daylight; and it
fell back with a bang against something that kept it upright. 
Every one climbed out, but there was not room for every one to
stand comfortably in the little paved house where they found
themselves, so when the Phoenix had fluttered up from the darkness
they let the stone down, and it closed like a trap-door, as indeed
it was.</p>

<p>You can have no idea how dusty and dirty the children were. 
Fortunately there was no one to see them but each other.  The place
they were in was a little shrine, built on the side of a road that
went winding up through yellow-green fields to the topless tower. 
Below them were fields and orchards, all bare boughs and brown
furrows, and little houses and gardens.  The shrine was a kind of
tiny chapel with no front wall - just a place for people to stop and
rest in and wish to be good.  So the Phoenix told them.  There was
an image that had once been brightly coloured, but the rain and
snow had beaten in through the open front of the shrine, and the
poor image was dull and weather-stained.  Under it was written: 'St
Jean de Luz.  Priez pour nous.'  It was a sad little place, very
neglected and lonely, and yet it was nice, Anthea thought, that
poor travellers should come to this little rest-house in the hurry
and worry of their journeyings and be quiet for a few minutes, and
think about being good.  The thought of St Jean de Luz - who had, no
doubt, in his time, been very good and kind - made Anthea want more
than ever to do something kind and good.</p>

<p>'Tell us,' she said to the Phoenix, 'what is the good and kind
action the carpet brought us here to do?'</p>

<p>'I think it would be kind to find the owners of the treasure and
tell them about it,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'And give it them ALL?' said Jane.</p>

<p>'Yes.  But whose is it?'</p>

<p>'I should go to the first house and ask the name of the owner of
the castle,' said the golden bird, and really the idea seemed a
good one.</p>

<p>They dusted each other as well as they could and went down the
road.  A little way on they found a tiny spring, bubbling out of
the hillside and falling into a rough stone basin surrounded by
draggled hart's-tongue ferns, now hardly green at all.  Here the
children washed their hands and faces and dried them on their
pocket-handkerchiefs, which always, on these occasions, seem
unnaturally small.  Cyril's and Robert's handkerchiefs, indeed,
rather undid the effects of the wash.  But in spite of this the
party certainly looked cleaner than before.</p>

<p>The first house they came to was a little white house with green
shutters and a slate roof.  It stood in a prim little garden, and
down each side of the neat path were large stone vases for flowers
to grow in; but all the flowers were dead now.</p>

<p>Along one side of the house was a sort of wide veranda, built of
poles and trellis-work, and a vine crawled all over it.  It was
wider than our English verandas, and Anthea thought it must look
lovely when the green leaves and the grapes were there; but now
there were only dry, reddish-brown stalks and stems, with a few
withered leaves caught in them.</p>

<p>The children walked up to the front door.  It was green and narrow.
A chain with a handle hung beside it, and joined itself quite
openly to a rusty bell that hung under the porch.  Cyril had pulled
the bell and its noisy clang was dying away before the terrible
thought came to all.  Cyril spoke it.</p>

<p>'My hat!' he breathed.  'We don't know any French!'</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened.  A very tall, lean lady, with pale
ringlets like whitey-brown paper or oak shavings, stood before
them.  She had an ugly grey dress and a black silk apron.  Her eyes
were small and grey and not pretty, and the rims were red, as
though she had been crying.</p>

<p>She addressed the party in something that sounded like a foreign
language, and ended with something which they were sure was a
question.  Of course, no one could answer it.</p>

<p>'What does she say?' Robert asked, looking down into the hollow of
his jacket, where the Phoenix was nestling.  But before the Phoenix
could answer, the whitey-brown lady's face was lighted up by a most
charming smile.</p>

<p>'You - you ar-r-re fr-r-rom the England!' she cried.  'I love so
much the England.  Mais entrez - entrez donc tous!  Enter,
then - enter all.  One essuyes his feet on the carpet.'  She pointed
to the mat.</p>

<p>'We only wanted to ask - '</p>

<p>'I shall say you all that what you wish,' said the lady.  'Enter
only!'</p>

<p>So they all went in, wiping their feet on a very clean mat, and
putting the carpet in a safe corner of the veranda.</p>

<p>'The most beautiful days of my life,' said the lady, as she shut
the door, 'did pass themselves in England.  And since long time I
have not heard an English voice to repeal me the past.'</p>

<p>This warm welcome embarrassed every one, but most the boys, for the
floor of the hall was of such very clean red and white tiles, and
the floor of the sitting-room so very shiny - like a black
looking-glass - that each felt as though he had on far more boots
than usual, and far noisier.</p>

<p>There was a wood fire, very small and very bright, on the
hearth - neat little logs laid on brass fire-dogs.  Some portraits
of powdered ladies and gentlemen hung in oval frames on the pale
walls.  There were silver candlesticks on the mantelpiece, and
there were chairs and a table, very slim and polite, with slender
legs.  The room was extremely bare, but with a bright foreign
bareness that was very cheerful, in an odd way of its own.
At the end of the polished table a very un-English little boy sat
on a footstool in a high-backed, uncomfortable-looking chair.  He
wore black velvet, and the kind of collar - all frills and lacey - 
that Robert would rather have died than wear; but then the little
French boy was much younger than Robert.</p>

<p>'Oh, how pretty!' said every one.  But no one meant the little
French boy, with the velvety short knickerbockers and the velvety
short hair.</p>

<p>What every one admired was a little, little Christmas-tree, very
green, and standing in a very red little flower-pot, and hung round
with very bright little things made of tinsel and coloured paper. 
There were tiny candles on the tree, but they were not lighted yet.</p>

<p>'But yes - is it not that it is genteel?' said the lady.  'Sit down
you then, and let us see.'</p>

<p>The children sat down in a row on the stiff chairs against the
wall, and the lady lighted a long, slim red taper at the wood
flame, and then she drew the curtains and lit the little candles,
and when they were all lighted the little French boy suddenly
shouted, 'Bravo, ma tante!  Oh, que c'est gentil,' and the English
children shouted 'Hooray!'</p>

<p>Then there was a struggle in the breast of Robert, and out
fluttered the Phoenix - spread his gold wings, flew to the top of
the Christmas-tree, and perched there.</p>

<p>'Ah! catch it, then,' cried the lady; 'it will itself burn - your
genteel parrakeet!'</p>

<p>'It won't,' said Robert, 'thank you.'</p>

<p>And the little French boy clapped his clean and tidy hands; but the
lady was so anxious that the Phoenix fluttered down and walked up
and down on the shiny walnut-wood table.  </p>

<p>'Is it that it talks?' asked the lady.</p>

<p>And the Phoenix replied in excellent French.  It said,
'Parfaitement, madame!'</p>

<p>'Oh, the pretty parrakeet,' said the lady.  'Can it say still of
other things?'</p>

<p>And the Phoenix replied, this time in English, 'Why are you sad so
near Christmas-time?'</p>

<p>The children looked at it with one gasp of horror and surprise, for
the youngest of them knew that it is far from manners to notice
that strangers have been crying, and much worse to ask them the
reason of their tears.  And, of course, the lady began to cry
again, very much indeed, after calling the Phoenix a bird without
a heart; and she could not find her handkerchief, so Anthea offered
hers, which was still very damp and no use at all.  She also hugged
the lady, and this seemed to be of more use than the handkerchief,
so that presently the lady stopped crying, and found her own
handkerchief and dried her eyes, and called Anthea a cherished angel.</p>

<p>'I am sorry we came just when you were so sad,' said Anthea, 'but
we really only wanted to ask you whose that castle is on the hill.'</p>

<p>'Oh, my little angel,' said the poor lady, sniffing, 'to-day and for
hundreds of years the castle is to us, to our family.  To-morrow it
must that I sell it to some strangers - and my little Henri, who
ignores all, he will not have never the lands paternal.  But what
will you?  His father, my brother - Mr the Marquis - has spent much
of money, and it the must, despite the sentiments of familial
respect, that I admit that my sainted father he also - '</p>

<p>'How would you feel if you found a lot of money - hundreds and
thousands of gold pieces?' asked Cyril.</p>

<p>The lady smiled sadly.</p>

<p>'Ah! one has already recounted to you the legend?' she said.  'It
is true that one says that it is long time; oh! but long time, one
of our ancestors has hid a treasure - of gold, and of gold, and of
gold - enough to enrich my little Henri for the life.  But all that,
my children, it is but the accounts of fays - '</p>

<p>'She means fairy stories,' whispered the Phoenix to Robert.  'Tell
her what you have found.'</p>

<p>So Robert told, while Anthea and Jane hugged the lady for fear she
should faint for joy, like people in books, and they hugged her
with the earnest, joyous hugs of unselfish delight.</p>

<p>'It's no use explaining how we got in,' said Robert, when he had
told of the finding of the treasure, 'because you would find it a
little difficult to understand, and much more difficult to believe.
But we can show you where the gold is and help you to fetch it
away.'</p>

<p>The lady looked doubtfully at Robert as she absently returned the
hugs of the girls.</p>

<p>'No, he's not making it up,' said Anthea; 'it's true, TRUE,
TRUE! - and we are so glad.'</p>

<p>'You would not be capable to torment an old woman?' she said; 'and
it is not possible that it be a dream.'</p>

<p>'It really IS true,' said Cyril; 'and I congratulate you very
much.'</p>

<p>His tone of studied politeness seemed to convince more than the
raptures of the others.</p>

<p>'If I do not dream,' she said, 'Henri come to Manon - and you - you
shall come all with me to Mr the Curate.  Is it not?'</p>

<p>Manon was a wrinkled old woman with a red and yellow handkerchief
twisted round her head.  She took Henri, who was already sleepy
with the excitement of his Christmas-tree and his visitors, and
when the lady had put on a stiff black cape and a wonderful black
silk bonnet and a pair of black wooden clogs over her black
cashmere house-boots, the whole party went down the road to a
little white house - very like the one they had left - where an old
priest, with a good face, welcomed them with a politeness so great
that it hid his astonishment.</p>

<p>The lady, with her French waving hands and her shrugging French
shoulders and her trembling French speech, told the story.  And now
the priest, who knew no English, shrugged HIS shoulders and waved
HIS hands and spoke also in French.</p>

<p>'He thinks,' whispered the Phoenix, 'that her troubles have turned
her brain.  What a pity you know no French!'</p>

<p>'I do know a lot of French,' whispered Robert, indignantly; 'but
it's all about the pencil of the gardener's son and the penknife of
the baker's niece - nothing that anyone ever wants to say.'</p>

<p>'If <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> speak,' the bird whispered, 'he'll think HE'S mad, too.'</p>

<p>'Tell me what to say.'</p>

<p>'Say &quot;C'est vrai, monsieur.  Venez donc voir,&quot;' said the Phoenix;
and then Robert earned the undying respect of everybody by suddenly
saying, very loudly and distinctly - </p>

<p>'Say vray, mossoo; venny dong vwaw.'</p>

<p>The priest was disappointed when he found that Robert's French
began and ended with these useful words; but, at any rate, he saw
that if the lady was mad she was not the only one, and he put on a
big beavery hat, and got a candle and matches and a spade, and they
all went up the hill to the wayside shrine of St John of Luz.</p>

<p>'Now,' said Robert, 'I will go first and show you where it is.'</p>

<p>So they prised the stone up with a corner of the spade, and Robert
did go first, and they all followed and found the golden treasure
exactly as they had left it.  And every one was flushed with the
joy of performing such a wonderfully kind action.</p>

<p>Then the lady and the priest clasped hands and wept for joy, as
French people do, and knelt down and touched the money, and talked
very fast and both together, and the lady embraced all the children
three times each, and called them 'little garden angels,' and then
she and the priest shook each other by both hands again, and
talked, and talked, and talked, faster and more Frenchy than you
would have believed possible.  And the children were struck dumb
with joy and pleasure.</p>

<p>'Get away NOW,' said the Phoenix softly, breaking in on the radiant
dream.</p>

<p>So the children crept away, and out through the little shrine, and
the lady and the priest were so tearfully, talkatively happy that
they never noticed that the guardian angels had gone.</p>

<p>The 'garden angels' ran down the hill to the lady's little house,
where they had left the carpet on the veranda, and they spread it
out and said 'Home,' and no one saw them disappear, except little
Henri, who had flattened his nose into a white button against the
window-glass, and when he tried to tell his aunt she thought he had
been dreaming.  So that was all right.</p>

<p>'It is much the best thing we've done,' said Anthea, when they
talked it over at tea-time.  'In the future we'll only do kind
actions with the carpet.'</p>

<p>'Ahem!' said the Phoenix.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon?' said Anthea.</p>

<p>'Oh, nothing,' said the bird.  'I was only thinking!'</p>
