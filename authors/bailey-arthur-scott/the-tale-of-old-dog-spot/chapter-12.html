<p>Poor Spot! He felt so mournful that he lifted up his muzzle and howled.
Farmer Green's wife had just ordered him out of the kitchen. She thought
he had been teasing Miss Kitty Cat. And instead he had kept Miss Kitty
from tasting the leg of mutton that lay on the kitchen table.
</p>
<p>"It's a sad, sad world!" he howled. "I thought Mrs. Green would praise
me. But she didn't. She scolded me!"
</p><p>"Sakes alive!" cried Henrietta Hen as she rushed up to him in the
farmyard. "What's the matter with you? Are you trying to bay the moon in
the daytime?"
</p><p>Turkey Proudfoot gobbled at Spot and bade him be still. Turkey Proudfoot
was very pompous, for he had an idea that he ruled the farmyard.
</p><p>Old dog Spot felt so meek, after the scolding that Mrs. Green gave him,
that he couldn't find a word to say to anybody that spoke to him.
</p><p>"I've expected this for some time," the Rooster told Henrietta Hen.
"Mrs. Green has put old Spot out of the farmhouse. And Farmer Green
intends to put him off the farm. Everyone agrees that he's a nuisance.
It's a wonder the folks in the Green family have kept him all these
years."
</p><p>Well, old dog Spot couldn't help hearing what the Rooster said. And he
hadn't even heart enough to answer that impertinent boaster.
</p><p>"Maybe he knows what he's talking about," Spot groaned. "I wish Johnnie
Green would come home. <u>He'd</u> stand up for me, if nobody else will."
</p><p>Then something happened all at once that helped Spot's spirits
amazingly. The woodshed door flew open and Miss Kitty Cat all but flew
out of it. Farmer Green's wife appeared in the doorway with a broom in
her hand. And with it she helped Miss Kitty into the yard. She helped
her so much that Miss Kitty never touched the broad stone doorstep at
all.
</p><p>"Scat!" cried Mrs. Green. "I don't want any thieves in my kitchen."
</p><p>It was quite plain that something had displeased Mrs. Green--something
in which Miss Kitty Cat had had a part. And old dog Spot thought he knew
what that something was.
</p><p>"Ha!" he barked at Miss Kitty. "So Mrs. Green found you out!" And he
ran at Miss Kitty and chased her into a tree. She sat herself down upon
a limb and glared at him.
</p><p>"Wow!" he yelped. "You must have sampled that leg of mutton when you
thought Mrs. Green's back was turned. And she must have caught you in
the act."
</p><p>Though that was exactly what had happened, Miss Kitty Cat wouldn't say a
word. But she <u>looked</u> whole sentences at him.
</p><p>Soon Farmer Green's wife came to the door again and called, "Come, Spot!
Come, Spot!"
</p><p>He hurried up to her and caught the piece of meat that she tossed to
him.
</p><p>It was mutton.
