<p>Before she thus set matters right with Noble he had been unhappy
and his condition had been bad; now he was happy, but his condition
was worse. In truth, he was much, much too happy; nothing rational
remained in his mind. No elfin orchestra seemed to buzz in his
ears as he went down the street, but a loud, triumphing brass
band. His unathletic chest was inflated; he heaved up with joy;
and a little child, playing on the next corner, turned and followed
him for some distance, trying to imitate his proud, singular walk.
Restored to too much pride, Noble became also much too humane;
he thought of Mr. Atwater's dream, and felt almost a motherly
need to cherish and protect him, to be indeed his friend. There
was a warm spot in Noble's chest, produced in part by a yearning
toward that splendid old man. Noble had a good home, sixty-six
dollars in the bank and a dollar and forty cents in his pockets;
he would have given all for a chance to show Mr. Atwater how well
he understood him now, at last, and how deeply he appreciated
his favour.</p>

<p>Students of alcoholic intoxication have observed that in their
cups commonplace people, and not geniuses, do the most unusual
things. So with all other intoxications. Noble Dill was indeed
no genius, and some friend should have kept an eye upon him to-day;
he was not himself. All afternoon in a mood of tropic sunrise
he collected rents, or with glad vagueness consented instantly
to their postponement. "I've come about the rent again," he said
beamingly to one delinquent tenant of his father's best client;
and turned and walked away, humming a waltz-song, while the man
was still coughing as a preliminary to argument.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, as the entranced collector sat musing
alone near a window in his father's office, his exalted mood was
not affected by the falling of a preternatural darkness over the
town, nor was he roused to action by any perception of the fact
that the other clerks and the members of the firm had gone home
an hour ago; that the clock showed him his own duty to lock up
the office and not keep his mother "waiting dinner"; and that
he would be caught in a most outrageous thunderstorm if he didn't
hurry. No; he sat, smiling fondly, by the open window, and at
times made a fragmentary gesture as of some heroic or benevolent
impulse in rehearsal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, paunchy with wind and wetness, unmannerly clouds came
smoking out of the blackened west. Rumbling, they drew on. Then
from cloud to cloud dizzy amazements of white fire staggered,
crackled and boomed on to the assault; the doors of the winds
were opened; the tanks of deluge were unbottomed; and the storm
took the town. So, presently, Noble noticed that it was raining
and decided to go home.</p>

<p>With an idea that he was fulfilling his customary duties, he
locked the doors of the two inner rooms, dropped the keys gently
into a wastebasket, and passing by an umbrella which stood in
a corner, went out to the corridor, and thence stepped into the
street of whooping rain.</p>

<p>Here he became so practical as to turn up his collar; and, substantially
aided by the wind at his back, he was not long in leaving the
purlieus of commerce behind him for Julia's Street. Other people
lived on this street&mdash;he did, himself, for that matter; and, in
fact, it was the longest street in the town; moreover, it had
an official name with which the word "Julia" was entirely unconnected;
but for Noble Dill (and probably for Newland Sanders and for some
others in age from nineteen to sixty) it was "Julia's Street"
and no other.</p>

<p>It was a tumultuous street as Noble splashed along the sidewalk.
Incredibly elastic, the shade-trees were practising calisthenics,
though now and then one outdid itself and lost a branch; thunder
and lightning romped like loosed scandal; rain hissed upon the
pavement and capered ankle-high. It was a storm that asked to
be left to itself for a time, after giving fair warning that the
request would be made; and Noble and the only other pedestrian
in sight had themselves to blame for getting caught.</p>

<p>This other pedestrian was some forty or fifty yards in advance
of Noble and moved in the same direction at about the same gait.
He wore an old overcoat, running with water; the brim of his straw
hat sagged about his head, so that he appeared to be wearing a
bucket; he was a sodden and pathetic figure. Noble himself was
as sodden; his hands were wet in his very pockets; his elbows
seemed to spout; yet he spared a generous pity for the desolate
figure struggling on before him.</p>

<p>All at once Noble's heart did something queer within his wet
bosom. He recognized that figure, and he was not mistaken. Except
the One figure, and those of his own father and mother and three
sisters, this was the shape that Noble would most infallibly recognize
anywhere in the world and under any conditions. In spite of the
dusk and the riot of the storm, Noble knew that none other than
Mr. Atwater splashed before him.</p>

<p>He dismissed a project for seizing upon a fallen branch and running
forward to walk beside Mr. Atwater and hold the branch over his
venerated head. All the branches were too wet; and Noble feared
that Mr. Atwater might think the picture odd and decline to be
thus protected. Yet he felt that something ought to be done to
shelter Julia's father and perhaps save him from pneumonia; surely
there was some simple, helpful, dashing thing that ordinary people
couldn't think of, but that Noble could. He would do it and not
stay to be thanked. And then, to-morrow evening, not sooner, he
would go to Julia and smile and say; "Your father didn't get too
wet, I hope, after all?" And Julia: "Oh, Noble, he's talked of
you all day long as his 'new Sir Walter Raleigh'!"</p>

<p>Suddenly will-o'-the-wisp opportunity flickered before him, and
in his high mood he paused not at all to consider it, but insanely
chased it. He had just reached a crossing, and down the cross
street, walking away from Noble, was the dim figure of a man carrying
an umbrella. It was just perceptible that he was a fat man, struggling
with seeming feebleness in the wind and making poor progress.
Mr. Atwater, moving up Julia's Street, was out of sight from the
cross street where struggled the fat man.</p>

<p>Noble ran swiftly down the cross street, jerked the umbrella
from the fat man's grasp; ran back, with hoarse sounds dying out
behind him in the riotous dusk; turned the corner, sped after
Mr. Atwater, overtook him, and thrust the umbrella upon him. Then,
not pausing the shortest instant for thanks or even recognition,
the impulsive boy sped onward, proud and joyous in the storm,
leaving his beneficiary far behind him.</p>

<p>In his young enthusiasm he had indeed done something for Mr.
Atwater. In fact, Noble's kindness had done as much for Mr. Atwater
as Julia's gentleness had done for Noble, but how much both Julia
and Noble had done was not revealed in full until the next evening.</p>

<p>That was a warm and moonshiny night of air unusually dry, and
yet Florence sneezed frequently as she sat upon the "side porch"
at the house of her Great-Aunt Carrie and her Great-Uncle Joseph.
Florence had a cold in the head, though how it got to her head
was a process involved in the mysterious ways of colds, since
Florence's was easily to be connected with Herbert's remark that
he wouldn't ever be caught takin' his death o' cold sittin' on
the damp grass in the night air just to listen to a lot o' tooty-tooty.
It appeared from Florence's narrative to those interested listeners,
Aunt Carrie and Uncle Joseph, that she had been sitting on the
grass in the night air when both air and grass were extraordinarily
damp. In brief, she had been at her post soon after the storm
cleared on the preceding evening, but she had heard no tooty-tooty;
her overhearings were of sterner stuff.</p>

<p>"Well, what did Julia say <em>then</em>?" Aunt Carrie asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"She said she'd go up and lock herself in her room and stuff
cushions over her ears if grandpa didn't quit makin' such a fuss."</p>

<p>"And what did he say?"</p>

<p>"He made more rumpus than ever," said Florence. "He went on and
on, and told the whole thing over and over again; he seemed like
he couldn't tell it enough, and every time he told it his voice
got higher and higher till it was kind of squealy. He said he'd
had his raincoat on and he didn't want an umberella anyhow, and
hadn't ever carried one a single time in fourteen years! And he
took on about Noble Dill and all this and that about how you <em>bet</em>
he knew who it was! He said he could tell Noble Dill in the dark
any time by his cigarette smell, and, anyway, it wasn't too dark
so's he couldn't see his skimpy little shoulders, and anyway he
saw his face. And he said Noble didn't <em>hand</em> him the umberella;
he stuck it all down over him like he was somep'n on fire he wanted
to put out; and before he could get out of it and throw it away
this ole fat man that it belonged to and was chasin' Noble, he
ran up to grandpa from behind and took hold of him, or somep'n,
and they slipped, and got to fussin' against each other; and then
after a while they got up and grandpa saw it was somebody he knew
and told him for Heaven's sake why didn't he take his ole umberella
and go on home; and so he did, because it was raining, and I guess
he proba'ly had to give up; he couldn't out-talk grandpa."</p>

<p>"No," said Uncle Joe. "He couldn't, whoever he was. But what
happened about Noble Dill?"</p>

<p>Florence paused to accumulate and explode a sneeze, then responded
pleasantly: "He said he was goin' to kill him. He said he often
and often wanted to, and now he <em>was</em>. That's the reason
I guess Aunt Julia wrote that note this morning."</p>

<p>"What note?" Aunt Carrie inquired. "You haven't told us of that."</p>

<p>"I was over there before noon," said Florence, "and Aunt Julia
gave me a quarter and said she'd write a note for me to take to
Noble Dill's house when he came home for lunch, and give it to
him. She kind of slipped it to me, because grandpa came in there,
pokin' around, while she was just finishin' writin' it. She didn't
put any envelope on it even, and she never said a single thing
to <em>me</em> about its bein' private or my not readin' it if
I wanted to, or anything."</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't," said Aunt Carrie. "You didn't, did you,
Florence?"</p>

<p>"Why, she didn't <em>say</em> not to," Florence protested, surprised.
"It wasn't even in an envelope."</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Atwater coughed. "I hardly think we ought to ask what
the note said, even if Florence was&mdash;well, indiscreet enough to
read it."</p>

<p>"No," said his wife. "I hardly think so either. It didn't say
anything important anyhow, probably."</p>

<p>"It began, 'Dear Noble,'" said Florence promptly. "Dear Noble';
that's the way it began. It said how grandpa was just all upset
to think he'd accepted an umberella from him when Noble didn't
have another one for himself like that, and grandpa was so embarrassed
to think he'd let Noble do so much for him, and everything, he
just didn't know <em>what</em> to do, and proba'ly it would be
tactful if he wouldn't come to the house till grandpa got over
being embarrassed and everything. She said not to come till she
let him know."</p>

<p>"Did you notice Noble when he read it?" asked Aunt Carrie.</p>

<p>"Yessir! And would you believe it; he just looked <em>too</em>
happy!" Florence made answer, not wholly comprehending with what
truth.</p>

<p>"I'll bet," said Uncle Joseph;&mdash;"I'll bet a thousand dollars
that if Julia told Noble Dill he was six feet tall, Noble would
go and order his next suit of clothes to fit a six-foot man."</p>

<p>And his wife complemented this with a generalization, simple,
yet of a significance too little recognized. "They don't see a
thing!" she said. "The young men that buzz around a girl's house
don't see a <em>thing</em> of what goes on there! Inside, I mean."</p>

<p>Yet at that very moment a young man was seeing something inside
a girl's house a little way down that same street. That same street
was Julia's Street and the house was Julia's. Inside the house,
in the library, sat Mr. Atwater, trying to read a work by Thomas
Carlyle, while a rhythmic murmur came annoyingly from the veranda.
The young man, watching him attentively, saw him lift his head
and sniff the air with suspicion, but the watcher took this pantomime
to be an expression of distaste for certain versifyings, and sharing
that distaste, approved. Mr. Atwater sniffed again, threw down
his book and strode out to the veranda. There sat dark-haired
Julia in a silver dress, and near by, Newland Sanders read a long
young poem from the manuscript.</p>

<p>"Who is smoking out here?" Mr. Atwater inquired in a dead voice.</p>

<p>"Nobody, sir," said Newland with eagerness. "<em>I</em> don't
smoke. I have never touched tobacco in any form in my life."</p>

<p>Mr. Atwater sniffed once more, found purity; and returned to
the library. But here the air seemed faintly impregnated with
Orduma cigarettes. "Curious!" he said as he composed himself once
more to read&mdash;and presently the odour seemed to wear away and
vanish. Mr. Atwater was relieved; the last thing he could have
wished was to be haunted by Noble Dill.</p>

<p>Yet for that while he was. Too honourable to follow such an example
as Florence's, Noble, of course, would not spy or eavesdrop near
the veranda where Julia sat, but he thought there could be no
harm in watching Mr. Atwater read. Looking at Mr. Atwater was
at least the next thing to looking at Julia. And so, out in the
night, Noble was seated upon the top of the side fence, looking
through the library window at Mr. Atwater.</p>

<p>After a while Noble lit another Orduma cigarette and puffed strongly
to start it. The smoke was almost invisible in the moonlight,
but the night breeze, stirring gently, wafted it toward the house,
where the open window made an inward draft and carried it heartily
about the library.</p>

<p>Noble was surprised to see Mr. Atwater rise suddenly to his feet.
He smote his brow, put out the light, and stamped upstairs to
his own room.</p>

<p>His purpose to retire was understood when the watcher saw a light
in the bedroom window overhead. Noble thought of the good, peculiar
old man now disrobing there, and he smiled to himself at a whimsical
thought: What form would Mr. Atwater's embarrassment take, what
would be his feeling, and what would he do, if he knew that Noble
was there now, beneath his window and thinking of him?</p>

<p>In the moonlight Noble sat upon the fence, and smoked Orduma
cigarettes, and looked up with affection at the bright window
of Mr. Atwater's bedchamber. Abruptly the light in that window
went out.</p>

<p>"Saying his prayers now," said Noble. "I wonder if&#11834;" But,
not to be vain, he laughed at himself and left the thought unfinished.</p>
