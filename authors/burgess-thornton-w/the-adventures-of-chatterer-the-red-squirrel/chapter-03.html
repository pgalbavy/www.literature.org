<p>Chatterer hurried through the Green Forest. He didn't know just
where he was going. He had but one thought, and that was to get
as far away from Shadow the Weasel as he could. It made him have
cold shivers all over every time he thought of Shadow.</p>

<p>"Seems to me you are in a great hurry," said a voice from a pine-tree
he was passing.</p>

<p>Chatterer knew that voice without looking to see who was speaking.
Everybody in the Green Forest knows that voice. It was the voice
of Sammy Jay.</p>

<p>"It looks to me as if you were running away from some one," jeered
Sammy.</p>

<p>Chatterer wanted to stop and pick a quarrel with Sammy, as he
usually did when they met, but the fear of Shadow the Weasel was
still upon him.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>am," he said in a very low voice.</p>

<p>Sammy looked as if he thought he hadn't heard right. Never before
had he known Chatterer to admit that he was afraid, for you know
Chatterer is a great boaster. It must be something very serious
to frighten Chatterer like that.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Sammy asked sharply. "I always knew you to be
a coward, but this is the first time I have ever known you to
admit it. Who are you running away from?"</p>

<p>Illustration: "What's that?" Sammy asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Shadow the Weasel," replied Chatterer, still in a very low voice,
as if he were afraid of being overheard. "Shadow the Weasel is
back in the Green Forest, and I have just had such a narrow escape!"</p>

<p>"Ho!" cried Sammy, "this is important. I thought Shadow was up
in the Old Pasture. If he has come back to the Green Forest, folks
ought to know it. Where is he now?"</p>

<p>Chatterer stopped and told Sammy all about his narrow escape
and how he had left Shadow the Weasel in a hollow of a chestnut-tree
with Redtail the Hawk watching for him to come out. Sammy's eyes
sparkled when Chatterer told how he had pulled the tail of old
Redtail. "And he doesn't know now who did it; he thinks it was
Shadow," concluded Chatterer, with a weak little grin.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Sammy Jay. "I wish I had been
there to see it."</p>

<p>Then he suddenly grew grave. "Other folks certainly ought to
know that Shadow is back in the Green Forest," said he, "so that
they may be on their guard. Then if they get caught, it is their
own fault. I think I'll go spread the news." You see, for all
his mean ways, Sammy Jay does have some good in him, just as everybody
does, and he dearly loves to tell important news.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I wish you would go first of all and tell my cousin,
Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel," said Chatterer, speaking in a hesitating
way.</p>

<p>Sammy Jay leaned over and looked at Chatterer sharply. "I thought
you and Happy Jack were not friends," said he. "You always seem
to be quarreling."</p>

<p>Chatterer looked a little confused, but he is very quick with
his tongue, is Chatterer. "That's just it," he replied quickly.
"That's just it! If anything should happen to Happy Jack, I wouldn't
have him to quarrel with, and it is such fun to see him get mad!"</p>

<p>Now of course the real reason why Chatterer wanted Happy Jack
warned was because down inside he was ashamed of a dreadful thought
that had come to him of leading Shadow the Weasel to Happy Jack's
house, so that he himself might escape. It had been a dreadful
thought, a cowardly thought, and Chatterer had been really ashamed
that he should have ever had such a thought. He thought now that
if he could do something for Happy Jack, he would feel better
about it.</p>

<p>Sammy Jay promised to go straight to Happy Jack and warn him
that Shadow the Weasel was back in the Green Forest, and off he
started, screaming the news as he flew, so that all the little
people in the Green Forest might know. Chatterer listened a few
minutes and then started on.</p>

<p>"Where shall I go?" he muttered. "Where shall I go? I don't dare
stay in the Green Forest, for now Shadow will never rest until
he catches me."</p>
