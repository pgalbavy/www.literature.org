<p>Our three friends&mdash;although it seems equally proper to speak
of four, as Terror was a most important member of the party&mdash;walked
away from the sea-shore and began making their way back into the
country. As we have hinted in another place, they found this section
wild and desolate. Little else than huge rocks, bowlders and stunted
trees met the eye, while there was no appearance of vegetation,
nor was the slightest vestige of a human habitation visible, let
them look in whatever direction they chose.</p>

<p>The air was clear, the sky decked by a few fleecy clouds over
the Pacific, and there was little doubt that the day would be
a fine, warm one. The climate of California is mild, except when
the winds from the Pacific bring chilling fogs along the coast.
The view in the east was particularly grand, the peaks of the
gigantic Coast mountains and of the smaller range rising and swelling
in vast peaks, appearing as if the Pacific when tossed and driven
by some hurricane had suddenly congealed with the foam upon the
tops of its mountainous billows. Looking northward, the last object
that met the eye was these mountains gradually blending with the
brilliant sky, while to the southward the prospect was repeated.</p>

<p>They wandered along, springing up the sides of rocks, jumping
quite a distance to the ground, again passing around those that
were too high to climb, Terror all the time frolicking at their
sides, certainly as happy as any of them, while they chatted and
laughed, their hearts buoyant in the beautiful summer and the
pleasing retrospect of a thrilling adventure already safely passed
through and the prospect of a few others close at hand.</p>

<p>In this wandering manner they at last found themselves fully
a mile from shore, and in a wild, rocky place where they felt
secure from observation. Here all removed their clothes, subjected
their bodies to a vigorous rubbing that made the surface glow
with warmth and reaction, and then spread their garments out to
dry. Their extended walk before reaching this place had partially
done the latter for them, so that in the course of an hour or
so they found them free from all moisture, and as they donned
them they once more felt like themselves.</p>

<p>"Now," said Elwood, "I am very tired and sleepy; is not this
a good place to lie down and rest?"</p>

<p>"I was going to suggest the same thing," added Howard. "I do
not see in what better manner we can spend a few hours."</p>

<p>"And it's the same idaa that has been strhiking me ever since
we sot foot in this qua'r looking place. It's meself that is so
sleapy that at ivery wink I makes I has to lift the eyelids up
with my fingers, and me eyes feels as though the wind has been
blowing sand in 'em all day."</p>

<p>The proposal thus being satisfactory to all, they proceeded to
carry it out at once. The day was so mild that the only precaution
necessary was to secure themselves against the rays of the sun.
This was easily done, and stretching out beneath the shelter of
a projecting ledge of rocks they had scarcely laid down when all
were sound asleep.</p>

<p>And leaving them here for the time being, we give our attention
for a few moments to the survivors of the steamer.</p>

<p>Some thirty odd of the passengers succeeded in reaching the shore,
while about a dozen were saved with the crew, who, as is generally
the case at such times, acted upon the idea that it was their
duty to take charge of the boats and prevent the passengers from
risking themselves in such frail structures. After all, no doubt
their lives were as valuable as were those of the hundreds they
carried, and their conduct, when viewed in an unprejudiced manner,
perhaps was not so criminal.</p>

<p>The destruction of so large a steamer along the California coast,
in the regular track of the vessels going to and coming from Panama,
could not occur without the knowledge of many upon the ocean.
Indeed, the glare upon the heavens was seen far up the coast,
and in San Luis Obispo, to the south, was pronounced by all to
be caused by the burning of some large vessel at sea.</p>

<p>It so came about that there were but two vessels near enough
to go to the relief of the unfortunate steamer; but these were
controlled by rival captains, each of whom hoped to enter the
Golden Gate an hour or so in advance of the other; and therefore
they had not time to slacken sail and lay to, but pressed forward
with an expression of regret that the necessities of the case
compelled them thus to refuse all succor to the needy ones.</p>

<p>But there were others at a greater distance who bore down upon
the fiery scene at once; but they were miles away when the last
vestige of the steamer disappeared, and it was only a matter of
conjecture as to where a few of the survivors might be struggling
with the waves. Not until the sun had been up over an hour did
the man at the mast-head of the nearest vessel call out that he
saw several boats pulling up the coast, while a few persons could
be seen on the shore making signals to attract their attention.</p>

<p>Some time after, the Relief&mdash;happily named&mdash;cast anchor a half-mile
from land and two boats put off from her side. The survivors were
quickly within them, and they were about putting off again when
the mate of the Relief said:</p>

<p>"Are you all here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," was the impatient reply of Mr. Tiflings, the man
who had sold the suit of clothes to Mr. Yard, "don't wait any
longer. I shall lose $500 by not being in San Francisco to-day."</p>

<p>"But they are not all here," interrupted Mr. Yard, in some excitement.
"There are two boys in charge of an Irishman that are missing."</p>

<p>"Where are they?" asked the mate.</p>

<p>"They went back from the shore some time ago. I do not think
they can be at any great distance."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if you called to them they might hear you."</p>

<p>Mr. Yard sprung out upon the beach, ran to and mounted a goodly-sized
rock, and shouted at the top of his voice. He called again and
again, and listened intently, but there was no response.</p>

<p>All this time Mr. Tiflings sat leaning his head forward and nervously
beating a tattoo upon the side of the boat with his long, thin
fingers. Occasionally he glanced at the "foolish" Mr. Yard, and
muttered:</p>

<p>"What nonsense! What valuable time we are losing by his childishness!
Time is too precious to fritter away in this manner!"</p>

<p>While the kind-hearted merchant was shouting himself hoarse,
our friends were heavily and sweetly slumbering, totally oblivious
to external things, as indeed they would have been were he within
a few rods of them, instead of over a mile away. Finally he was
compelled to give up the task and reluctantly return to the boat.</p>

<p>"This is too bad," said he, "to leave them in this manner. What
will become of them?"</p>

<p>"They will be picked up by some of the passing vessels."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," assented Mr. Tiflings, "don't wait any
longer; it will be a week before we get into San Francisco."</p>

<p>"We will row away," said the mate, "and if we see anything of
them before we reach the vessel we will put back and take them
aboard."</p>

<p>This was reasonable, and Mr. Yard could not object to it. The
sailors plied their oars, and the passengers were borne swiftly
toward the friendly Relief. Mr. Yard kept his eyes fixed upon
the bleak coast which they were so rapidly leaving behind them.
He saw nothing of his friends; but, after reaching the ship's
deck, he took the spy-glass from the captain and discovered a
party of a dozen Indians wandering up and down the beach as if
in quest of plunder. Finally, sail was hoisted, the Relief bore
away to the northward, and the scene of the rescue dwindled away
and vanished in the distance.</p>
