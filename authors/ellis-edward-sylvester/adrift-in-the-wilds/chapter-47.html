<p>Tim O'Rooney and Howard Lawrence, after making their way out
of the range of hills to the river-side, where their canoe lay,
waited until dark, in accordance with their agreement, before
venturing out upon the river. They were quite uneasy, and to prevent
their trail revealing them they dropped a few hundred yards down
the shore, where they awaited the coming of darkness.</p>

<p>"Worrah! worrah!" said Tim with an immense sigh, "this is a bad
day when we came to leave the youngster with the rid gintleman.
A fine youngster was the same&mdash;bowld and presumin'. It's a qua'ar
failin', Masther Howard, that comes to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sad enough, too."</p>

<p>"Ah! but it is not exactly that be the towken of another faaling
intirely."</p>

<p>"What is it then?"</p>

<p>"Whin it's yourself that is lost and awandtherin' off by yourself
all alone, and nobody with yees, then I thinks it's yees that
I loves more nor him that stays with me. But now, whin it's Elwood
&mdash;God bless him!&mdash;that's gone, he's dearer to me than all
the rest of the world, not exceptin' yourself. But," and Tim scratched
his head in great perplexity, "it's the same that puzzles me sorely.
Could yees be afther accounting for it?"</p>

<p>"Elwood and I both know that you think a great deal of us, and
no doubt it is because your affection is so equally divided."</p>

<p>"That's it. Yees have made it all plain. I likes each of yees
more than the other, and both of yees a great deal the most, whither
be the towken of takin' yees apart or together, or takin' both
of yees separate, and also wid each other."</p>

<p>Tim nodded his head again and again, as if to signify that it
was clear to his mind. Perhaps it was; but if so, one may doubt
whether it was as clearly expressed.</p>

<p>"There's another thing that troubles me," added the Irishman,
with one of those great inhalations of breath which seem to fill
the entire being.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Me pipe has gone out, and I hasn't the maans convanient to relight
it."</p>

<p>"That is a small infliction which you can well afford to bear.
I am only anxious for the night, that we may speed on our way
home to get assistance for poor Elwood."</p>

<p>"Yis, if it's bist."</p>

<p>And just in that exclamation Tim O'Rooney echoed the sentiments
of his companion. Ever since leaving the range of hills, with
the resolve to hurry away in search of help, the question had
been constantly rising in his mind: "Is it best to do so?"</p>

<p>He tried to put it out of hearing, with the determination that
he had already decided; but, as if it were the pleadings of conscience,
it would not be stifled, and it came again and again, until when
Tim spoke it seemed almost as loud as his.</p>

<p>"I can't make up my mind about that," said he. "When we left
the hills I had not a moment's doubt but that he was in the hands
of the Indians, where there was great danger of our getting ourselves;
but then we are not sure of it, and suppose we go away and leave
him wandering through the woods until he is captured or is obliged
to give himself up to keep from starving. I imagine him following
along the shore of the river looking for us&#11834;"</p>

<p>"There! there! do yez shtop! No more for me; I've plenty," and
the Irishman drew his sleeve across his eyes, as if he were wiping
an undue accumulation of moisture, while Howard Brandon was scarcely
less affected at the touching picture which he had drawn, and
which he felt might be realized from his own remissness.</p>

<p>"I am sure I cannot tell which is for the best," he added in
great perplexity. "If a prisoner, he may be able to get away."</p>

<p>"Yis, yees are right; some dark night he can give the owld haythen
the slip, and make thracks for the river."</p>

<p>"And who knows but he has been able to elude them, and is only
waiting until dark to hunt us up?"</p>

<p>"Yez are right agin; I was about to obsarve the same myself."</p>

<p>There was one view of the case, which if it did occasionally
force itself upon the attention of Howard, he resolutely refused
to utter a reference to it. It was that Elwood had been killed
accidentally, or by the savages. That was too terrible a contingency
to take definite shape until there was no escaping it, and as
all of us know better we won't refer to it again.</p>

<p>"Then he may be in the power of these wandering Indians that
took such an interest in the antelope we left lying down among
the rocks."</p>

<p>"Yis; yez are correct sure."</p>

<p>"How is it, Tim, that you agree with every supposition I make,
no matter bow different they are from each other?"</p>

<p>"Wal, you saas me mind is a little foggy, be the towken that
I hasn't had the pipe atween me lips since yesterday. When I'm
deprived of that pleasure I finds meself unable to reason clearly."</p>

<p>"That is the first time I have heard that smoke makes a thing
clearer."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's the trouble," added Tim, with a desponding shake
of his head. "If this bad state of things continyees fur a few
days longer, yees'll have to laad me around wid a string, or else
taach Terror to do the same, as yez have saan a poor blind man
and his dog do."</p>

<p>"You draw rather a woeful picture of yourself. But I suppose
you can hold out for a few hours longer, and when it becomes dark,
we can make a fire, light your pipe and get far away from it before
any of the Indians could reach the spot."</p>

<p>"I think yez are right, but me intellect is working so faably
this afternoon, that I faars to tax it too hard lest it topples
over and gits upsit intirely. Yis, yez are right."</p>

<p>"Somehow or other I think Shasta is in this neighborhood&#11834;"</p>

<p>"So does meself," interrupted Tim, in his anxiety to give assent.</p>

<p>"If he is, he will not forget the kindness of Elwood."</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"And whether we wait here or not he will attend to his safety
all the same."</p>

<p>"That he will&mdash;you may depend on it."</p>

<p>"Then shall we wait here or hurry down the river for help?"</p>

<p>"Both, or aither as yez plaise."</p>

<p>"But, Tim, we must do one or the other."</p>

<p>"Let us slaap and draam over it."</p>

<p>This struck Howard as a good suggestion, as they both needed
slumber sorely, and adjusting themselves in the canoe, with the
Newfoundland as ever maintaining guard, they were quickly wrapped
in deep slumber.</p>

<p>When they awoke it was broad day, and the whining of the dog
told them at once that he had detected something suspicious.</p>
