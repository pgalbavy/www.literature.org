<p>Derry Duck having vouchsafed his protection to the young stranger,
for a time sought no further intimacy with him. He might be seen
occasionally among the groups who were won to hear a song or a
story from Blair, but he was apt to leave these scenes suddenly,
as if for some call of duty or stirred by some quick and painful
thrust of feeling.</p>

<p>Captain Knox was a stern, moody man, who had very little direct
intercourse with his crew. Derry Duck was made his medium of communication
on every ordinary occasion. The captain was the only person on
board who kept a stock of writing materials, and from him, through
Derry, Blair and the other sailors obtained such articles on the
rare occasions when they were in demand. There was not much taste
or time for literary efforts on board the Molly.</p>

<p>A pleasant evening had collected all the sailors on deck, and
Blair had taken the opportunity to retire below to spend some
time in recalling Scripture to his mind, which was now his substitute
for reading in the holy book. He was roused from his meditations
by the entrance of Derry Duck, with an inkstand in one hand and
a sheet of paper in the other. Blair rose as the mate came towards
him, supposing the writing materials were to be left in his charge
for some shipmate.</p>

<p>"Sit down, boy," said Derry in his quick way, "sit down; I want
you to do something for me."</p>

<p>"I should be right glad to do any thing I could for you. You
have been a real friend to me," said Blair warmly. "You can't
think how much I thank you for it."</p>

<p>Derry sat down and laid the paper on the table before him. Then
the two were for a moment silent. Blair and his "friend" formed
a strange contrast to each other.</p>

<p>The slender stripling, tall for his years, was yet in the blossom
of his youth. His face, which was so like his loving mother's,
would have been effeminate, but for the savor of old Joe Robertson
the pilot, which told in the marked nose and strong chin of the
boy, but had no part in his great, clear, soul-lit eyes, or the
flexible lines of his changing mouth. That mouth was now parted
as if he would say more, but waited for some word or sign from
his companion.</p>

<p>Deny Duck was a very bundle of time-worn, storm-tried muscles
and sinews. The knots on his bare arms were like knobs of oak;
and his great brawny hand that lay there on the white paper, looked
like a powerful living thing, having almost an identity and will
of its own.</p>

<p>Derry's body and whole development to his thighs were those of
a tall, stalwart man; but his lower limbs were short and sturdy,
ending in great flat feet which were as much at home in the water
as on the rolling deck, or amid the dizzy rigging. These peculiarities
had given him the name by which he was known&mdash;originally "Daring
Duck," but by degrees contracted into the "Derry Duck" which Blair
had caught from the sailors.</p>

<p>It was hard to realize that the mate of the Molly had ever been
an infant, whose tender cheek had been pressed to that of a loving
mother. And yet it was true that a Christian mother had once hailed
that hardened man as a gift from God to nurse for him. His lips
had been taught to pray, and his young footsteps guided to the
house of God.</p>

<p>Time had made sad changes in him since then. His skin was now
as tough and well-tanned as his leathern belt, in which hung many
a curious implement of war and peace, a perfect tool-shop for
the boarder's wild work, or the seaman's craft. In that strong,
hard face there was a tale of a life of exposure, a lawless life,
which had well-nigh given over to the evil one the soul which
God meant for himself.</p>

<p>"I want you to write a letter for me," said Derry, looking cautiously
about him and then going on, "a letter to my little daughter.
Hush; not a word of this to any of the men. When it is done, you
must put it inside of one of your love-letters to your mother.
They mustn't get wind of it. They are not fit even to know I have
such a child, much less to see her. Be secret! Can I trust you,
my boy?"</p>

<p>"I'll write for you with all my heart," said Blair in astonishment;
"and of course I wont name it if you don't wish me to; no, not
to a soul on board. But I shall have to tell my mother, or she
wont know what to do with the letter."</p>

<p>"Just ask her to mail it for one of your shipmates. That will
be enough," said Derry quickly. "'Least said, soonest mended.'
I have my reasons. I know which way the wind blows, and how to
ward off a sou'-wester."</p>

<p>"What shall I say?" said Blair, taking up the pen, and reaching
for the paper. Derry's hand lay on it, a "paperweight" that did
not move itself off at Blair's motion.</p>

<p>"You see," began the sailor, "you see I've got a little daughter,
not so old as you are by a year or two. I dare say you think she's
made of coarse stuff like me, fit for the rough and tumble of
life. No such thing. Her hand is white as a sail on a summer sea,
and her little round cheek is so soft, Oh, so soft, that when
it snugs up to mine it seems as if an angel was touching me, and
I feel as if I wasn't fit for such as her to love and fondle.
Yet she loves me; she loves her old dad. She don't call me Derry
Duck, not she. She don't know any thing about Derry Duck, and
what he does when he 's off on the sea. I don't mean she ever
shall. I'd rather die first, gnawed to pieces by a hungry shark.
Her mother left her to me, a little two-year-old thing, a clinging
little creature that would snug in my arms and go to sleep, whether
I was drunk or sober. I killed her mother&mdash;sent her to the better
country before her time. I didn't lay my hand to her; I wasn't
bad enough for that. But my ways took the pink out of her cheeks,
and made her pine away and just go out of my sight like the wake
of a passing ship. Where she had been, there she was not. I loved
her, boy, and these eyes cried; these great hands would have willingly
been worn to the bone with hard work, if that could have restored
her life. I don't drink any more. I've quit that. I haven't touched
a drop since she died. I took to the sea. I made up my mind I
wouldn't kill the little tender thing she left me. <em>She</em>
should never die for knowing how bad her father was. I took the
little money I had, and bought a real gentleman's suit of clothes.
Then I went to a minister I knew about, in a far away town, where
my&mdash;never mind where the child's mother came from&mdash;and I asked
him and his wife to take care of the little thing, for a sorrowful
man that was going off on the sea, and would pay well for what
they did. I knew it wasn't the money that would make them lay
their hand to the work; but they had nothing to spare, and I didn't
mean to leave her to charity. I wanted her brought up to be like
her mother, in ways that wouldn't end where I'm going. They took
her, and there she is. Nobody can see her without loving her,
such a little, dainty, winning, clinging, pretty thing, nine years
have made out of the toddlin' creature I put out of my arms, that
ached after her till I was clear out of sight of land. Don't think
I miss seeing her when I'm ashore. Don't I leave Derry Duck aboard
ship, and put on my landsman's clothes, and ride up to the door
where she is, with my pocket full of money. She don't lack for
any thing, I warrant you. She's dressed like a rose, all in pink
and green, with little ribbons fluttering like her little heart
when she sees me coming. She's learning too. Why, she knows most
enough to teach the queen, the child does. And then she's so modest
and asks me questions, as if I could tell her every thing. I always
have a cold or a headache or something, and can't say much when
I'm there. I keep still, and take my fill of looking at her, and
hugging her close to this old tough heart. I wouldn't let out
an oath before her. I'd rather see the Molly go to the bottom
in fair weather. I'm scant of my talk, lest I should let out that
my way of thinking is different from hers. I wouldn't have her
pretty blue eyes turn away from me, so sorrowful, yet so loving,
just as her mother's used to. I couldn't bear that. She loves
me, that little pure thing, that says its prayers night and morning,
and asks God to bless its father on the sea. She's my angel. Mayhap
those little prayers will get heard some day, and a blessing will
come to me and make me a different man. Only the Almighty could
turn Derry Duck into a father fit for that child's eyes to look
on. My heart yearns after her when I'm far away, but I don't let
her write to me. I wouldn't have such men as I live with know
where my flower hides its little head. I wouldn't have her run
a chance of seeing any body who knows Derry Duck, and might tell
her of his wild ways. It would break her little heart, it would.
I can't write to her; not but what I was scholard somewhat, long
ago; but these hands have had other work to do than holding a
pen and making letters that a wise little girl like her would
think all right. I couldn't either put into words just what I
want to say. It a'n't much that I would say, neither, but a kind
of letting out how I set all the world by her, and want her to
be just so much better than other folks as I am worse. Something
would slip in that shouldn't, if I was to try; I know there would.
But you can write for me. You would know just how to put it. She
says she yearns after me when I'm gone, and would be so full of
joy if she could once have a letter from me, all her own, to read
over and over when she can't throw her arms round my neck and
put her little loving face close up to mine. Will you write for
me, boy, something for the dear girl to read over, and think the
right kind of a father is talking to her, a man she wouldn't be
ashamed of before the company her mother keeps <em>up there</em>?"</p>

<p>The last words were spoken reverently, and formed a strange contrast
to much that had gone before. We have omitted the oaths and rough
expletives with which Derry interlarded his speech. There is the
taint of sin even in the repetition of such language.</p>

<p>Blair Robertson had listened with a throbbing heart and tearful
eye to the sailor's story. It seemed to him that God had not quite
cast off one who had such a tender care for the happiness and
purity of his child. Blair gently laid his slender hand on Derry's
brawny fingers, and looked up earnestly into his face as he said,
"Why can't you be just such a father, Derry?"</p>

<p>Derry laughed a sorrowful, derisive laugh, and then said almost
fiercely, "You don't know me, lad. It would chill your very blood
to know what I've done, and where I've been. There are spots on
me that nothing can wash out. I've grown into it, boy. It's my
life. I'm hard and tough, soul and body. There's no making me
over. I'm spoiled in the grain. I tell you it's too late. I a'n't
a father for her to know. I can't be made into one. That a'n't
what I came here to talk about. Will you write my letter, that's
the question?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I will write for you in the way that seems to me the
best. But, Derry, 'there is a fountain opened for sin and all
uncleanness.' 'The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all
sin.' 'If any man be in Christ Jesus, he is a <em>new creature</em>;
old things have passed away.' 'With God all things are possible.'
'Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.' 'Though your
sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they be
red like crimson, they shall be as wool.'"</p>

<p>As Blair spoke these words, he fixed his earnest eyes on the
sailor's face, and seemed pleading for his very soul.</p>

<p>"There is a look about you like her, like her <em>up there</em>,"
said Derry, almost trembling. "I see her face in the dark night
when I'm on the watch, and her eyes speak to me just as yours
do &mdash;Oh, so pleading. Hush! There's some one coming. Write
the letter as if it was one of your own. They wont hector you
now. I've taught 'em better manners. Let me see 'em touch a hair
of your head, and I'll finish 'em quick."</p>

<p>As Derry spoke, he gave a thrust with his clenched fist as at
an imaginary enemy. The eyes that had lately been softened into
tenderness had their old fierce twinkle, and his hard features
settled into their fixed expression of determined daring.</p>

<p>The men gave place as he forced his way up the hatchway. On he
went, stamping along the deck as if he ground an enemy beneath
his heel at every step.</p>
