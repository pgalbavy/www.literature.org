A PHILOSOPHER witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a vessel,
of which the crew and passengers were all drowned.  He inveighed
against the injustice of Providence, which would for the sake of
one criminal perchance sailing in the ship allow so many innocent
persons to perish.  As he was indulging in these reflections, he
found himself surrounded by a whole army of Ants, near whose nest
he was standing.  One of them climbed up and stung him, and he
immediately trampled them all to death with his foot.  Mercury
presented himself, and striking the Philosopher with his wand,
said, "And are you indeed to make yourself a judge of the
dealings of Providence, who hast thyself in a similar manner
treated these poor Ants?'
