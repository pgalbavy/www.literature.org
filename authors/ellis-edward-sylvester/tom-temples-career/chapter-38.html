<p><em>TOM WAS </em>up and about early the next morning. But there
was one who was earlier than he. On leaving the robbers he saw
the captain pacing to and fro, apparently engrossed by his reflections.
When he saw Tom he beckoned to him.</p>

<p>"Take a walk with me," he said abruptly. "I want to speak to
you."</p>

<p>Tom, of course, joined him promptly.</p>

<p>"Let us go further away," said the robber, looking about him
cautiously. "What I have to say is for your ears alone."</p>

<p>"I shall take care to keep it secret," said Tom in a low voice.</p>

<p>"You must, for I am about to say what will compromise my safety.
But, in the first place, can you guarantee that I shall receive
ten thousand dollars on the delivery of these papers?"</p>

<p>"I can," said Tom promptly. "Mr. Armstrong has authorized me
to make such an offer."</p>

<p>"Is he a man to be relied upon? You know my position. I am an
outlaw. I cannot appeal to the law in my own behalf."</p>

<p>"I understand your position fully," said Tom. "As to your being
an outlaw, I have nothing to do with that, nor has Mr. Armstrong.
You have in your possession the papers which we need. It is worth
our while to pay ten thousand dollars. You may be sure the money
will be paid, and that no trap will be set for you. Should you
be recognized, it will not be through any information obtained
from me or Mr. Armstrong."</p>

<p>"That is enough," said the captain. "Though you are only a boy,
there is something about you that I can trust. You understand
business. You have gone to the root of the matter without any
unnecessary words. I will confide in you, and in so confiding
I put my life in your hands."</p>

<p>Tom listened with surprise. He could not understand what was
coming.</p>

<p>The captain proceeded:</p>

<p>"You know me as the captain of a band of robbers, but you do
not understand that I have in a manner been forced into my position.
I don’t like the life I am leading. I want to leave it, and I
think I see the way. With the money you promise me, I will change
my name, go to some obscure place, and lead a respectable life,
entering upon some business of which I shall not be ashamed."</p>

<p>"Do so," said Tom earnestly. "I am glad to hear you say this,
and I will do what I can to help you."</p>

<p>The captain appeared pleased with his prompt sympathy and proceeded:</p>

<p>"Of course my plan must be a profound secret. If the band were
to learn what I propose I should never live to leave California.
They would regard me as a traitor and a renegade, and would feel
that they were entitled to a share in the money obtained for these
bonds."</p>

<p>"How, then, will you manage to leave?" asked Tom, interested.</p>

<p>"I will tell you. I shall say that I am going to San Francisco
in disguise to negotiate these securities, and will bring back
the proceeds. I hope this will deceive them. But the one whom
I dread the most is Alonzo."</p>

<p>"The lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he is my second in command. Our relations have not always
been cordial. He is in the habit of exceeding his proper authority,
and more than once I have been compelled to reprimand him publicly.
Though he has taken it quietly, I have reason to believe that
he never forgave me—that, in fact, he cherishes a secret grudge
against me, and that he would willingly undermine my authority
with the band. He has not as yet had an opportunity."</p>

<p>"I should think, then, that he would be glad to have you leave,
in order that he might succeed to your authority."</p>

<p>"That would not satisfy him. He would not be willing to have
me better myself in so doing. He would prefer that I should be
cast adrift in disgrace."</p>

<p>"Have you decided upon your plan?" asked our hero.</p>

<p>"Yes; after breakfast I will dismiss you and the other prisoners.
They will go on to the mines, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>"You will not."</p>

<p>"No; I shall return to San Francisco."</p>

<p>"Good. I shall follow you. It would create suspicion if we should
go together. You shall give me your address there, and I will
join you. Then we will take the first steamer to New York."</p>

<p>Tom nodded. He felt that the plan was a good one, and that he
was now in a fair way to accomplish successfully the object which
had brought him so far from home.</p>

<p>"Agreed," he said, "Call for me at Burton’s clothing store, ——
Street, Even if I am not staying there, you will learn where I
am."</p>

<p>The captain repeated the name two or three times.</p>

<p>"I will not forget it," he said. "Of one thing I will apprise
you. You must not expect to know me at first meeting."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I shall be cleverly disguised. It is necessary, for unfortunately
I am not altogether unknown to the authorities. Once let me get
away from California, and I shall feel comparatively safe. I may
as well tell you by what name I prefer to be known. I shall call
myself James Davenport. Under that name, if fortune favors me,
I hope to build up a respectable future, far from the scene of
my lawless proceedings."</p>

<p>Tom knew little of the man who was walking beside him, except
what he had chosen to communicate. He knew not in what ways he
had violated the laws, nor did he now take this into consideration.
He pictured him as a man who wanted to forsake the evil of his
ways, and become a respectable and law-abiding citizen, and with
the instinct of a generous nature, he felt like doing all in his
power to help him, apart from any selfish interest of his own.
Instinctively he held out his hand, and the captain grasped it
in his own.</p>

<p>"Whatever may happen," said the robber, "I shall have full confidence
in your word. You have it in your power to denounce me to the
authorities in San Francisco, but I am sure you will not do it."</p>

<p>"You only do me justice," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Or you could reveal my purpose to these men under my command,
and this would insure my death, provided they had confidence in
your word."</p>

<p>"You are not afraid of that?" asked Tom, looking him full in
the face.</p>

<p>"No," said the captain. "As I said in the first place, there
is something about you that enlists my confidence. I would trust
you as myself."</p>

<p>"You may," said Tom.</p>

<p>They had turned back, and were again near the building occupied
by the band. Only one was stirring. This was Alonzo, who watched
their approach.</p>

<p>"You are up early, captain," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," returned the captain carelessly; "I have been taking a
walk. I did not sleep well."</p>

<p>"What is on his mind?" thought the lieutenant. "Something is
up. I can see it in his manner. I must watch him."</p>

<p>"I don’t like his looks," thought Tom. "He is a dangerous man.
The captain does right in suspecting him."</p>
