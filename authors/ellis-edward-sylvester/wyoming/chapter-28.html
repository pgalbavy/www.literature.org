<p>Meanwhile, Fred Godfrey was making the most of his opportunities,
and the grass did not grow under his feet.</p>

<p>The distance passed over by himself and friends was so slight,
that he was back beneath the cavern within a couple of minutes
after bidding them such a hasty good-bye.</p>

<p>No one could have been more alive to the situation than he, who
halted directly under the place that had sheltered him and his
friends for a brief while, and looked and listened.</p>

<p>"Can it be that they really know nothing of our flight?" he asked
himself. "It seems impossible that, after following us and guarding
the approaches so closely, such can be the truth."</p>

<p>So it appeared, indeed, and Fred was not without a pang of apprehension
that Jake Golcher and his Indians were playing a game, in which
they were sure to win.</p>

<p>But it was too late to speculate now, and pausing only a moment,
he leaped forward, caught the end of the vine and climbed it hand
over hand. His activity and strength enabled him to ascend like
a sailor, and a moment later he stood within the cavern that he
had left but a short time before.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be gained there, and grasping the support he went
on upward.</p>

<p>Such a method of ascent is exhausting, and he was tired, when,
at last, he stood on the level ground above.</p>

<p>As circumstances forbade the use of the vine by which he had
come up, and by which he must descend again, he began hunting
as best he could for another, which he speedily found. This was
carefully cut and trimmed, and then he dropped it over the ravine,
and in the stillness he plainly heard the rustling as it struck
the bottom.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, the rifle was fired from the rocks across
the gorge, Fred seeing the flash, so that he knew the point it
came from. At first he was sure he was the target, but concluded
that such was not the case.</p>

<p>Filled with misgivings, he crept a few steps in the direction
of the head of the path that came up from below, and listened.
He was afraid to go any closer, but he was as certain as if he
saw them, that several of the Indians were clustered there, awaiting
the occurrence of some expected event.</p>

<p>"There's some mystery in this business that I fail to grasp,"
added Fred, as he caught the sound of guns and the faint whoops
of the Indians and Tories on the other side the river. "It is
possible that most of them have withdrawn, unwilling to linger
when there are so many victims awaiting them in other places,
but I can hardly believe it, since Jake Golcher leads them."</p>

<p>Moved by an anxiety that forbade him to keep still, he once more
swung himself from the rocks, supported by the thick, strong vine
that had served them all so well, and it required only a brief
time to reach the bottom.</p>

<p>Everything, so far as he could judge, was in proper form, and
he hastened up the ravine, rejoining his friends, who naturally
were in a fever of anxiety over what seemed his prolonged absence.</p>

<p>"Now that you have got the vine," said his father, "I have been
puzzling myself ever since you left, to understand how you are
going to use it."</p>

<p>"It doubtless strikes you as absurd as the idea of using the
one by which I had to climb up the rocks and come down again,
but I am hopeful there is a way."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to learn it."</p>

<p>"But that shot&mdash;who fired it?"</p>

<p>"One of the Indians, I presume."</p>

<p>"Was it not aimed at you?"</p>

<p>"I think not; but, if it was, you see it missed me, so it is
a question to which we need give no thought."</p>

<p>All drew a breath of relief when Fred made known that no trouble
had been experienced from the red men, who were believed to be
in the immediate vicinity of the upper end of the path.</p>

<p>The lieutenant now explained that his plan was to mount the shoulders
of Habakkuk McEwen, and thus reach a projection on the rocks,
by the help of which he hoped to attain a still higher point,
or rather shelf, from which it would be an easy matter to climb
to the level ground above, and push their way toward the distant
Delaware River.</p>

<p>The feat was too difficult for the rest of the party to accomplish,
which explains why the grape-vine became so necessary. With the
aid of that, and with Fred tugging above, there was reason to
hope that the ascent would be made with little trouble.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Habakkuk McEwen, without any protest, stood up against
the wall, and Fred, with gun and vine secured, so as to leave
his limbs free, mounted to his shoulders with the ease of an acrobat.</p>

<p>Then, straightening himself, he groped about with his hands,
and was fortunate in finding a broad ledge within easy grasp.
It was a difficult matter, even with such help, to draw himself
up, but by great care he managed to do so, and then found that
by a similar maneuver he could reach the ground above, where the
way was clear to the woods.</p>

<p>This was gratifying, and, dropping the end of the vine to his
friends, he whispered for Mr. Brainerd to seize it and to begin
to climb.</p>

<p>It was a hard task, and, had the support given way, doubtless
the old gentleman would have been killed or grievously hurt, but
he struggled and was pushed up by Habakkuk, and the vine was tugged
at by Fred above, until at last the panting father reached the
ledge and stood beside his son.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "It was a hard task."]</p>

<p>As there were now two to use their strength in lifting, Aunt
Peggy, Eva, and Maggie had but to grasp the support, when they
were drawn up without any effort on their own part. Habakkuk came
last, and he tried so hard to assist, that it may be said he went
up feet first, sawing the air so vigorously with his legs that
they appeared on the ledge before his body reached it.</p>

<p>But the fugitives were all there at last, and something like
genuine hope began to stir every member of the company.</p>

<p>"Now," said Fred, "we have the same experience to go through,
and we shall reach solid ground above. I will go up as before."</p>

<p>Only a small part of the moonlight found its way to the spot
where they were crouching, and they felt it would not do to stay
longer.</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully Fred went up the rocks, and all saw him
safely reach the level ground, where he vanished.</p>

<p>At the instant he did so they caught a peculiar sound, as though
a slight struggle was going on, but it instantly ceased, and,
though the friends were alarmed, they said nothing, thinking that
perhaps Fred had stumbled over some obstruction in the dark.</p>

<p>"<em>St, st!</em>"</p>

<p>The signal which he made before reassured all, and drove the
thought of danger from their minds.</p>

<p>The same order was repeated; Mr. Brainerd grasped the vine, and,
helped both above and below, gradually surged upward until he,
too, went over the edge of the ravine, as it may be called, and
vanished.</p>

<p>Maggie started, when she again heard a curious movement above,
as if made by a scuffle, and her heart throbbed with the suspicion
that something was wrong.</p>

<p>"I tell you," she whispered, "there's trouble up there."</p>

<p>"No, there isn't," replied Aunt Peggy, "I suppose&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>The same sibilant call as before was repeated, and the elderly
lady showed her faith in her own assertion by catching hold of
the vine, and allowing herself to be pulled up as her predecessor
had been.</p>

<p>Maggie and Eva were left with Habakkuk, who was plainly nervous,
though it might be hard for him to explain why.</p>

<p>"Do you feel skeart?" he asked, in an undertone, as the rope
of natural growth came dangling about their heads.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the elder sister; "didn't you notice a strange noise
after Fred and father got up?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but there is something queer; they don't seem
to show themselves after they reach the top; it looks to me as
if they tumbled over into some hole&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>As the signal was heard the three looked up and caught the dim
outlines of a head. There was not enough light to identify it,
but had the moonlight fallen upon it, those who stood below would
have observed that the face did not belong to any one of their
three friends.</p>

<p>With misgiving, Maggie grasped the support and went up; then
Eva followed, and, last of all. Habakkuk McEwen stood alone.</p>

<p>He paused in doubt a minute or so, but when the vine swung within
his reach, he seized it, muttering:</p>

<p>"I may as well follow the crowd."</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>The instant he arrived at the top he was seized by several Seneca
Indians, and the astounding truth then dawned upon him that not
only he, but every one of the party, had climbed squarely into
the trap set for them, and, without a single exception, were prisoners
in the hands of the very red men they were trying with so much
skill to avoid.</p>
