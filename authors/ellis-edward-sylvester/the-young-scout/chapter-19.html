<p>When Mendez, the White Mountain Apache, who was acting as guide
for Lieutenant Decker and his men, pointed across the Gila, it
was not at the fugitives, for they had disappeared from view several
minutes before, but at a point some distance to the right of the
route taken by Maroz and Ceballos.</p>

<p>From a spot among the foothills of the Apache range, that was
several hundred feet higher than the river, and where the rocks,
boulders and pines offered secure shelter, a wavy column of smoke
was ascending. It was so thin that, as it climbed slowly upward,
with the towering mountains beyond serving as a background, it
was perceptible only to the keenest vision. It was fully dissipated
before reaching a point that would bring it in relief against
the clear sky, above the mountain crest. More than likely that
but for the searching scrutiny of Mendez the others would not
have discovered it at all.</p>

<p>Beyond question the column of smoke was intended as a signal
for the hostiles who had crossed the river but a short time previous.
It proved that they had allies already among the mountains, and
that between them and themselves a perfect understanding existed.
No doubt could remain that the outbreak was more serious than
at first supposed, and instead of having three or four renegades
to run down, there was likely to be double or triple that number,
with the prospect of another of those long, exhausting campaigns
under the sun of Arizona, in which the innocent would suffer tenfold
more than the guilty.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker was so well convinced of the serious task before
him that he adopted a radical change of plan. Even though he should
succeed in tracing the hostiles to their hiding place in the mountains,
his force was too small to strike them an effective blow. He decided
to return to camp and report to the colonel, that no time might
be lost in organizing a movement that would bring the Indians
to terms, always provided the opportunity could be secured for
doing so.</p>

<p>This meant a long halt in the pursuit, which to the father was
unbearable. He could not remain idle during the long, sultry hours,
when his child was in the possession of the band, who certainly
meant him no good. He must keep moving or he would lose his self-control.</p>

<p>Declining, therefore, the invitation of the officer to accompany
them on their return to the post, and thanking him for what he
had already done, he turned the head of his mustang toward home,
and struck an easy, swinging gait, while they rode westward to
Fort Reno.</p>

<p>But Freeman had no purpose of returning to his desolate wife
and child until he could gather decisive tidings of his boy, whether
good or bad. After reaching a point where the intervening undulations
of land were likely to shut him from the sight of any watchful
Apaches, he changed his course, making it parallel with the river,
spurred his pony to greater speed, and finally returned to the
stream at a point more than a mile east of where he had parted
from the lieutenant and his little company.</p>

<p>He was familiar with that part of the country, and without losing
any time he rode into the water and headed for the southern shore.
The river was narrower than below, but it was deep, and his mustang
was forced to swim most of the way; but the bath was as welcome
to him as to his rider. Though both emerged dripping wet, it mattered
naught under the smiting rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Once across, Freeman felt that he had fairly entered upon his
important task. Disquieted as he was by his grief, he was too
old a campaigner to lose his head, no matter how critical the
emergency. He had set out to locate the Apaches who held his boy,
and then, if no possible means of rescuing him presented itself,
he would give his knowledge to friends who would be only too ready
to help him.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the difficulty of the work thus
laid out for himself. It brought him in direct conflict with the
subtlety of the worst of all American tribes, and upon what may
be called their own ground. His chances of success were hardly
one in a hundred.</p>

<p>But, despite the discouraging outlook, the parent was buoyed
up by a fact, and by a theory which he had persuaded himself to
believe was also a fact. During his two years in Southern Arizona
he had become familiar with much of the Apache Range, and especially
with that portion he now meant to visit. He was quite confident
that he knew where the little company would make their first halt
of any duration; and instead, therefore, of attempting to follow
their trail, he proposed to make directly for the rendezvous.</p>

<p>There was more than one advantage in adopting this course, chief
of which was that it involved far less risk to himself. The fugitives
would watch their own trail and be prepared to ambuscade any of
their pursuers who tried to follow it, while, by taking another
route to the rendezvous, he was sure to escape that peril. This,
however, as will be seen, hinged on the question whether or not
he had made a mistake in locating Maroz, Ceballos, and such of
their companions as they might have gathered round them. That
remained to be proved by actual test.</p>

<p>The theory that did much to buoy up Freeman was the rather fanciful
one that the Apaches were holding his child as a hostage for certain
unlawful deeds not yet committed. They had been offered immunity
for the crimes of the morning, and had scoffed at the offer. With
the opportunity of striking their enemies hard, they could not
surrender before doing so. They must give full vent to their viciousness
as preliminary to settling down to become good Indians. When the
time came, and they were ready to yield, they would have the advantage
of giving the authorities the alternative of accepting their submission,
with the restoration of the child unharmed, or of consenting to
its death by refusing their terms.</p>

<p>This was the theory, and as I have said, it was a fanciful one,
which Freeman did not mention to the lieutenant, through fear
that he would shake his head and declare it could have no possible
existence in fact. He had managed to make himself believe it,
and it nerved his arm to the attempt that otherwise would have
been the height of folly.</p>

<p>The solitary pursuer had not penetrated far among the foothills,
when, as he anticipated, a point was reached where his pony could
be of no further use to him. Accordingly he dismounted, removed
the saddle and bridle and turned him loose, to wander at will,
until he should come back to claim him.</p>

<p>From the point where he left his animal to where he believed
the Apaches were gathered was hardly a mile, but the distance
was traversed with such extreme care, that the long, hot afternoon
was drawing to a close before he was near his destination. Well
aware that the slightest mistake on his part would be fatal, he
determined to make none, if patience, caution and circumspection
could prevent it.</p>

<p>That stealthy advance among the stunted vegetation, over and
around vast rocks, down declivities, gullies and gorges, through
hollows and ravines and up abrupt slopes, was enough to try the
endurance and nerve of the bravest man. His vision was so circumscribed
that he often failed to see a dozen feet in advance, and he never
caught sight of a boulder or rock, that he did not ask himself
whether one or more of his enemies was not kneeling behind it,
with leveled Winchester, awaiting just such an opportunity to
bring him down.</p>

<p>He could no longer detect anything of the signal fire that was
the means of bringing him thither, and he believed it had been
extinguished; but when he was congratulating himself on his success,
he was startled to find that, without any thought on his part,
he had struck the trail of Maroz and Ceballos. There were the
hoofprints of their unshod ponies, distinctly marked, where they
had borne their riders up the steep slope, and probably for a
goodly distance beyond, before they were discarded.</p>

<p>The path showed so plainly that it would have been easy to follow
it; but, instead of doing so, he hastily crossed it and made his
own course to the supposed rendezvous more circuitous than before.</p>

<p>But if this discovery was alarming, it was not to be compared
to that which followed within the next fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>The settler had crossed another of those narrow gorges that were
continually interposing, and was guardedly picking his way up
the opposite side when, without the first warning, he observed
an Apache warrior less than fifty feet distant.</p>

<p>He was seated on the ground, with his back against a dwarfed
pine, his position such that his side was turned toward the white
man, whom he did not see. This was the more remarkable, since,
with all the care the latter might use, he could not avoid a slight
noise in his movements which ought to have reached the ears of
an enemy at double the distance.</p>

<p>Hardly repressing a gasp of amazement, Freeman brought his Winchester
to his shoulder, and covered the warrior in the twinkling of an
eye. No matter how catlike the fellow might be in his actions,
he was now at a fatal disadvantage; the white man had the drop
on him.</p>

<p>Freeman, however, did not pull trigger. He feared the consequences
when the report should ring through the solitude, for of necessity
it must reach the ears of others near at hand.</p>

<p>Still the Apache did not stir, even though the settler purposely
made a noise with one of his feet.</p>

<p>"He is either asleep or is sunk in a deeper reverie than I ever
knew an Indian to be."</p>

<p>Neither of these suppositions was satisfactory. Freeman now coughed
quite loudly, but with no more effect upon the warrior than before.
Then the settler lowered his rifle, for he knew the truth.</p>

<p>Glancing around to make sure that no one was in sight, Freeman
walked forward, holding his gun ready for instant use. The Apache’s
head was bowed on his breast as if asleep, but his continued quiescence
could be accounted for only in one way; he was dead.</p>

<p>Such was the fact. The weapon in the grasp of Maurice Freeman
was the one that had brought him low, but it was aimed and fired
by the wife when defending her home against the marauders. This
was the warrior whose body had been carried among the foothills
by his friends, until, believing it was beyond danger of being
found by the whites, they had left it behind.</p>

<p>"Ah, if Molly had only used two more cartridges with equal effect
what a blessed thing it would have been!" mused the settler, as
he glanced at the figure, "it would have saved Captain Murray
and his family, and it would have saved, too, my little boy."</p>

<p>This discovery was significant. The other Apaches had been there
at some time during the day, and probably were still in the neighborhood.
The spot fixed upon by Freeman as the one likely to be the rendezvous
was not far off, and he felt more certain than before that he
was right in the belief that led him to make this venture.</p>

<p>But with every rod’s advance the situation grew more critical.
No matter where the Apaches might have grouped themselves, they
were on the alert for the pursuit that they knew would be quickly
made by the soldiers. Indeed, so vigilant are these dusky miscreants
that it may be said there is only one brief period out of the
whole twenty-four hours when there is a possibility of surprising
them. That is a short time before daylight. They are wide awake
through the day and most of the night, but if the most careful
reconnoitering shows them no sign of their enemies, they are apt
to succumb to drowsiness as daybreak approaches.</p>

<p>By what has been said is not meant that an Apache camp is unapproachable
except at the period named, but I know of no instance in which
a large band has been surprised by pursuing cavalry, except in
the dismal hours between three o’clock and the morning.</p>

<p>Should Freeman succeed in locating Maroz and Ceballos, and possibly
several others, it might well be asked in what way he would be
better situated than when on the northern shore of the river?
What could a single man hope to do against several warriors who
held his child captive?</p>

<p>Nothing in a direct way. But, having located them, and learned
that his boy was alive, he would hasten to Lieutenant Decker and
leave him to decide upon the plan to follow.</p>

<p>Although but a comparatively slight distance from the river,
he was in one of the wildest portions of the foothills of the
Apache Mountains. But for this the Indians would not have dared
to halt before penetrating further. As it was they felt as secure
as if in the very heart of the range, for nothing was to prevent
them from withdrawing still more whenever they chose.</p>

<p>Freeman had not gone far when the conviction forced itself upon
him that he was dangerously near the Apache camp. True he had
not seen nor heard anything to show this, but it may be said "it
was in the air." He felt no doubt of it.</p>

<p>The ground sloped in its irregular way at an angle of almost
forty-five degrees. The dwarf pine was abundant, wherever its
hardy roots could find room to draw nourishment from the ground,
which had been baked under the sun’s rays; the rocks and boulders
were as numerous as ever, and, as Freeman came to a halt and glanced
around, he thought:</p>

<p>"They must have abandoned their ponies before reaching this camp.
A mountain goat could hardly keep his footing."</p>

<p>While the settler stood motionless, debating whether to venture
any further before darkness, he was startled by a faint, tremulous
whistle which came from some point in advance. It was so soft
and musical that he would not have noticed it at any other time.</p>

<p>"That’s an Apache," was his thought; "and I would give much to
know what it means. He isn’t far off either."</p>

<p>If the call was a signal, it was likely to bring a reply, but,
though he listened intently, he heard none.</p>

<p>"It might have been a bird; I would believe so if I were anywhere
else, or this was another time, but things are becoming too ticklish
for comfort."</p>

<p>He took several steps forward, not with the intention of searching
further for the camp, but to utilize a gray, massive rock which
bulged a dozen feet above the ground. He would not be quite so
conspicuous under its shadow as when standing in the more open
space.</p>

<p>It was a proof of the power of the sun in that latitude that,
when Freeman placed his hand against the mass of stone, he quickly
drew it back, because of the heat still in the rock. He had noticed
the same thing on his way thither when he came in contact with
other solid substances, but this was a little more pronounced.
However, it was a small matter and he gave it no thought.</p>

<p>The slight additional sense of security was quickly dissipated
by again hearing the signal that he had noticed a few minutes
before. The trained ear could not have detected any variation,
and he would have been certain that it issued from the same dusky
lips, but for the change in the direction of the point whence
it came.</p>

<p>At first it sounded exactly in front, as he faced the mountains,
but the second time it was well round to his right. True, an Indian
could have readily shifted his position from one point to the
other during the interval, but Freeman believed more than one
was concerned in the business.</p>

<p>Whether or not such was the fact, the conclusion was inevitable
that he had placed himself in a most perilous situation. The Apaches
could outmaneuver him, and, if they once suspected his presence,
there was no possibility of extricating himself.</p>

<p>His shuddering dread was that, despite the care he had exercised,
Maroz and Ceballos had already learned the truth and were seeking
at that moment to shut off all chance of his eluding them. He
believed that those soft, birdlike calls referred to <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>No one could question the bravery of Maurice Freeman, but he
would have given a good deal, just then, could he have been whisked
to any point, a half mile distant, no matter in what direction.
He knew he had essayed a task beyond his power and utter overthrow
and disaster were near at hand.</p>

<p>While the Apaches might try to use the child as a hostage, it
was not to be expected that they would attempt anything of that
nature with the parent. He would be served as was poor Captain
Murray, and his enemies would hold the same coign of advantage
as before.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, it was self-evident that he must lose no time
in falling back and wait for darkness before venturing nearer
to the camp. Without any delay, therefore, he assumed a crouching
position and turned to retrace the steps that he never should
have taken.</p>

<p>Before he had gone a rod, the signal again sounded. This time
it was directly behind him as he had stood, when hiding behind
the rock: in other words, he was advancing straight toward it.
One Apache, if not more, was in his path.</p>

<p>Freeman stopped short, and, without straightening up, glanced
searchingly ahead. As he did so, he plainly saw the red man who
had emitted the signal step from behind another rock in full view
and but a few rods away.</p>
