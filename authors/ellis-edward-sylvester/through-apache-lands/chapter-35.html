<p>Ned then understood why the two scouts had taken pains to fill
their canteens at the brook during the day, and why, also, they
so religiously preserved the little lunch still remaining in their
possession. It was to guard against just such a contingency.</p>

<p>As the sun approached the horizon, the lad seated himself upon
a rocky protuberance and looked off over the surrounding country.
To the west, the blue, misty outlines of a moderately high range
of mountains shut off all further view.</p>

<p>"Just beyond that," he said to himself, as he fixed his eyes
upon the elevation, "Tom tells me is Fort Havens, where father
is waiting for me. If he only knew we were here, he might come
to our relief. Wouldn't he scatter the redskins down there? But
I don't know how he will find it out. Oh! if we were only among
those mountains, it wouldn't take us long to go the rest of the
way. I suppose the fort can be seen from their top."</p>

<p>To the south, a stratum of yellow vapor stretched for forty degrees
along the horizon. There were no buffaloes there, but there had
been, and it was the evidence of their passage. To the north,
the view was broken by ridges, patches of wood, and curious irregularities
of surface, but there was no sign of life among all, nor could
it be detected except by peering over the edge of Hurricane Hill
down upon the assembled besiegers below. He noticed that Tom Hardynge,
shading his eyes with his hand, was gazing off with a fixed intensity
in the direction of the mountains which intervened between them
and Fort Havens. He said nothing, but there was a significance
in his persistency which aroused the curiosity of the lad in no
small degree. Could it be that his keen vision detected something
tangible toward the setting sun, which was hidden from view by
the mountain range? Or was it the mere searching for something
upon which to hang his hopes?</p>

<p>Dick Morris was very differently occupied, acting, indeed, as
if unaware that anyone else was upon the hill-top besides himself.
Crawling to the edge, he was stretched out flat upon his face,
his hat removed, while he peered stealthily downward upon the
crowd below. Probably, he, too, was searching for something or
somebody. There was so much meaning in his actions that the interest
of the lad centered upon him, and he watched every motion.</p>

<p>The hunter fidgeted around for a few minutes, as if his posture
was not exactly comfortable, and then hastily projecting his gun
over the margin, he took a quick aim and fired, and then flinging
the weapon aside, looked down again to see the result. All at
once, he sprang to his feet, and stamped back toward the center
of the plateau, in a terrific rage.</p>

<p>"Ain't it awful!" he exclaimed, adding a forcible expletive.
"Did I ever make a bigger mistake?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Hit the wrong skunk."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Tom, turning toward him.</p>

<p>"I've been figuring around for half an hour so as to draw a bead
on Lone Wolf, and just as I pulled the trigger, I found I'd hit
the wrong one. It's trying to one's feelings to be disappointed
that way."</p>

<p>"I don't b'leve you'll get a chance at him," said Tom, as he
seated himself and resumed his patient scrutiny of the western
horizon.</p>

<p>However the scout was not quite in despair, and, reloading his
piece, he returned to his position and resumed his watch. But
the mistake he had made operated against him in every way. It
apprised the Apaches of their danger from this sort of sharp-shooting,
and the whole force fell back, while Lone Wolf, who was shrewd
enough to know that his life was in special demand, made sure
that he was out of range of those fatal rifles. Besides this,
it was rapidly growing dark, and before Dick could gain any kind
of a chance at all, the light was too dim to afford him the indispensable
aim.</p>

<p>The hunters showed a business-like manner of doing things. As
soon as it was fairly dark, Dick Morris gave up his hunt for Lone
Wolf, and, remarking that there would be no fun until the morrow,
rolled over and away from the margin, and was sound asleep within
ten minutes.</p>

<p>"You'd better do the same," said Tom to the lad, as he left him
alone, and moved down the incline to the position he intended
to occupy while acting as sentinel during the first portion of
the night.</p>

<p>Ned remained up a considerable time, when, as there seemed to
be nothing going on of an alarming nature, he concluded to step
out and do the same, if he could control his nerves enough to
do so. He was both hungry and thirsty, but not to a very great
degree, and as his companions said nothing about eating or drinking,
he made up his mind to wait until the morrow. It was about an
hour before he became entirely unconscious, but when he shut his
eyes they were not opened until morning.</p>

<p>Before that time, however, Tom Hardynge became involved in a
little difficulty. The point where he located was about half way
between the base and top of Hurricane Hill. Here the path made
such an abrupt bend that it was easy to conceal himself, and still
keep a sharp watch upon any one coming from below. It was the
hunter's belief that an attempt would be made by the Apaches to
steal upon them before morning; for, while their enemies were
ready to wait three or four days, or as long as was necessary,
yet it was to be expected that they would prefer to force matters
to a conclusion as speedily as possible. If they could crowd up
to the top of the hill and overwhelm the fugitives, they were
willing to incur the risk of losing several lives that they might
do so. Accordingly, when he assumed his position it was with the
expectation that there would be something on the carpet before
long.</p>

<p>Nor was he disappointed. For two hours not the slightest sound
reached his ears, and then a pebble softly rattled down the incline
below him. There might have been no human agency in this slight
occurrence, as the loose <em>d√©bris</em> was likely to do the
same thing at any moment, but Tom believed that it was caused
by the moccasin of an Apache stealing upward. He stealthily peeped
around the edge of the rock, but nothing was to be seen. There
was a moon in the sky, but its position was such that the path
was thrown in shadow, and he could not have detected a man a dozen
feet distant.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes more passed and then the scout became certain
that an Indian was stealing up the path toward him. It was a wonder
how the thing could be done, without sending streams of gravel
and pebbles rattling to the bottom. Hardynge straightened up,
still peering around in the gloom.</p>

<p>The moments wore away and still he was able to detect that soft,
faint gliding, as if a rattlesnake were getting into a position
to strike its prey. By and by&mdash;yes, he could now make out the
crouching figure approaching through the darkness and he drew
back lest he should be seen. Nearer and nearer it drew, while
he remained as motionless as the solid rock beside him. Finally,
after great delay it stood opposite.</p>

<p>At the very instant it was passing the hand of Tom Hardynge shot
straight out with lightning-like quickness and force, and the
knife clutched in his iron-like grasp did its duty well. No outcry
proclaimed the deed. There was only a gasp and all was over. The
moment it was done the hunter straightened up and listened.</p>

<p>"Mebbe there's another behind him."</p>

<p>But the most patient, careful listening failed to detect anything,
and, leaving the body lying where it had fallen, he went noiselessly
to the top where Dick was sleeping. A gentle touch aroused the
latter and he instantly rose to his feet. A few words told him
all that had happened and then the two hurriedly discussed the
scheme which had occurred to Hardynge a short time before. Two
minutes only were needed for them to reach a conclusion.</p>

<p>"I'll do it," muttered Tom, as they arose and began picking their
way down the path.</p>
