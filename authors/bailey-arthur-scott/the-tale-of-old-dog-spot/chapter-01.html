<p>Nobody ever spoke of old Spot's master as "old Johnnie Green." Yet the
two--boy and dog--were almost exactly the same age. Somehow Spot grew up
faster than Johnnie. He had stopped being a puppy by the time his young
master learned to walk. And when Johnnie was big enough to play around
the farm buildings his parents felt sure that he was safe so long as
"old Spot," as they called the dog, was with him.
</p>
<p>Spot thought himself years older than the small boy; or at least he
always acted so. If a goose hissed at little, toddling Johnnie Green,
old Spot would drive the goose away, barking in a loud voice, "Don't you
frighten this child!" If Johnnie went into the stable and wandered
within reach of the horses' heels Spot would take hold of his clothes
and draw him gently back out of danger. And if Johnnie strayed to the
duck pond the old dog wouldn't leave him even to chase the cat, but
stayed right there by the pond, ready to pull his young charge out of
the water in case he happened to fall in.
</p><p>Spot seemed to enjoy his task of taking care of Johnnie Green. It wasn't
all work. A great deal of pleasure went with his duties, for Johnnie
Green never wanted to do anything but play. And Spot wasn't so grown up
that he couldn't enjoy a lively romp. For that matter, he never did get
over his liking for boisterous fun.
</p><p>Still, there were some kinds of sport that he didn't care for. He wasn't
fond of having such things as tin cans tied to his tail. He disliked to
be harnessed to a toy wagon. He hated to have his ears pulled. Yet there
was only one offense that ever made him growl. When Johnnie Green took a
bone away from him Spot couldn't help warning him, with a deep, rumbling
grumbling, that he was going too far, even between friends. But he never
snapped at Johnnie. That growling was only Spot's way of teaching
Johnnie Green manners.
</p><p>Fond as he was of his young master, Spot did not care to spend all his
time playing childish games. There were grown-up things that he liked
to do--things in which a toddler like Johnnie Green couldn't take part.
Around the farmhouse there were always the cat to be teased and
squirrels to be chased into trees. In the pasture there were woodchucks
to be hunted; and even if he couldn't catch them it was fun to see those
fat fellows tumble into their holes.
</p><p>Then there were the cows. Spot loved to help Farmer Green drive them
home late in the afternoon. He acted very important when he went for the
cows, always pretending that it was hard work, though he really thought
it great sport.
</p><p>Sometimes when Johnnie Green wanted to play with Spot the old dog
couldn't be found anywhere. He might be over the hill, visiting a
neighbor's dog. He might be in the woods, looking for birds. He might
even have followed a wagon to the village.
</p><p>As Johnnie Green grew older he roamed through the woods with Spot. And
when Johnnie's father at last let him own a gun, old Spot was as pleased
as Johnnie was.
</p><p>"I've been waiting for this event for several years," Spot told the
Muley Cow.
</p><p>She did not share his delight.
</p><p>"For pity's sake, keep that boy and his gun out of the pasture!" she
bellowed. "It frightens me to have him come near me with his
blunderbuss."
</p><p>Old Spot gave her a pitying look.
</p><p>"It's plain," he said, "that you don't come from a sporting family, as I
do, or you'd never speak in that fashion of a nice new shotgun. You know
I'm a sporting dog. I'm a pointer. I point out the game for the
hunters."
</p><p>The Muley Cow gave a sort of snort and tossed her head.
</p><p>"It's lucky for Johnnie Green," she sniffed, "that I'm not a sporting
cow, or he might not have any butter on his bread."
