<p>For a brief while after the descent of the mate of the <em>Coral</em>,
incased in his new diving armor, the four men above did nothing
more than merely wait for his coming up. But all the time the
parties were watching each other, for Captain Bergen was convinced
that the crisis was at hand. The mutineers had learned where the
oyster-bed was, and therefore could be no longer restrained by
that consideration. They could get on without the diving-armor,
though they saw how convenient it might be to have it; but, since
it was connected with the shore, it could be drawn in and recovered
if they should need it.</p>

<p>The mate was down in the ocean, and the captain was standing
on terra firma. What more favorable separation was likely to present
itself? Here were three men against one, and the three had gained
the secret which had restrained them so long.</p>

<p>"I say," said Hyde Brazzier, "does the mate down there find things
as he expected?"</p>

<p>"We can tell that better after he comes up," was the reply of
the captain, who kept his hand at his hip, where it could rest
on the butt of his revolver. "But there is reason to believe that
he isn't disappointed."</p>

<p>"And he breathes through these pipes that lie here?" pursued
Brazzier, while the expression on the face of Pomp and Redvignez
convinced Skipper Bergen that serious mischief was coming.</p>

<p>"You can see that without asking me," replied he, stepping back
a pace or two so as to keep the men before him.</p>

<p>"Well, if a man can't get what air he wants, what is likely to
happen?" continued Brazzier, with an insolent swagger that was
exasperating, following upon his fawning sycophancy.</p>

<p>"Any fool would know that he would die."</p>

<p>"Well, now that we've landed, I don't see as there is any need
of a mate or a captain neither, with this crew&mdash;do you, boys?"</p>

<p>And he turned toward his companions with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Of course not. The best place for him is in Davy Jones' locker!"
said Redvignez.</p>

<p>"Now you is talkin' right!" was the characteristic comment of
the negro, Pomp, who seemed the most eager of the three, when
the mutiny had come to a head.</p>

<p>It was evident that Brazzier had determined to drown the mate
while he was below the surface.</p>

<p>"The first man who interferes with those pipes I will shoot dead!"</p>

<p>Captain Bergen spoke the words in a low voice, but there could
be no mistaking his deadly earnestness. Feeling that the crisis
had come, the captain determined to give the signal agreed upon
with Abe Storms, which was a sudden jerk of the rope fastened
to the one around the waist of the mate. The latter would understand
that his presence above was needed at once.</p>

<p>The captain was in the act of stooping over, when Redvignez sprang
behind him with the stealth and agility of a cat, and struck his
arm a violent blow. His purpose was to knock the revolver out
of the captain's hand, so that he and his friends could secure
the use of it. But he overdid the matter, for the revolver went
spinning out of the captain's hand and dropped into the water,
where it sank out of sight. Startled and shocked, he straightened
up without giving the signal to Abe Storms below the surface.</p>

<p>None of the party had any firearms, but Captain Bergen saw it
would be madness for him to make any resistance. Without a moment's
hesitation, therefore, he wheeled about and ran with all the speed
of which he was capable.</p>

<p>His flight was not altogether an aimless one, for he hoped to
reach the schooner, lying an eighth of a mile away, far enough
in advance of his pursuers to seize one of the rifles carefully
concealed there, and to make defense against his foes. The instant
he broke into a run, his pursuers did the same, uttering loud
shouts, as if they were American Indians who were certain of their
prey.</p>

<p>For the time, it was a question of speed between pursuers and
pursued. If the latter could reach the craft considerably ahead
of the others, there was a chance of his making a successful defense
against the three who were seeking his life. If he failed to attain
the goal, he felt it would be all over with him, for they were
not the men to show any mercy.</p>

<p>Darting among the palm-trees, therefore, he strained every nerve
to draw away from his enemies, while they strove, with equal desperation,
to overtake him.</p>

<p>It was a straight run, and comparatively an unobstructed one,
for the palm-trees were far enough apart to give him a pretty
fair course, which was of equal advantage to all parties. Perhaps
it is possible, therefore, to imagine the anxiety with which,
after running a short distance, Captain Bergen glanced over his
shoulder to see how his pursuers were making out. But it is not
possible to appreciate his consternation when he saw that two
of them were outrunning him, and, as he had striven to his very
utmost, the frightful truth was manifest that he was sure to be
overtaken before he could reach the <em>Coral</em>.</p>

<p>Those who were gaining upon him were Pomp, the negro, and Brazzier
himself. But the fact that they were gaining upon him was no cause
for the fugitive falling down and yielding without a struggle.
He still had his sheath-knife, which he grasped with a despairing
feeling as he realized, during those awful seconds, that complete,
disastrous failure, instead of the brilliant success he had counted
upon, had overtaken him at last.</p>

<p>The pursuers gained rapidly, and not one-half the distance was
passed, when all three of the men were almost within striking
distance, for Redvignez was at the elbow of his companions. Captain
Bergen looked over his shoulder, and was about to throw his back
against a palm-tree, with the view of turning at bay and fighting
to the last, when, like the historical John Smith of our own earlier
times, his lack of attention to his feet precipitated the very
fate against which he was struggling. His feet struck some obstruction,
and being exhausted from his extraordinary exertion, he pitched
forward and fell on his face. As he went down he was conscious
of hearing two widely different sounds&mdash;one the exultant cries
of the pursuers, and the other the terrified scream of a little
girl.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen attempted to rise, but Redvignez and Brazzier
were upon him, and the knife of the latter was upraised with the
purpose of ending the matter then and there forever, when the
cry of the child was heard the second time, and little Inez sprang,
like Pocahontas, between the uplifted arm and the intended victim.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't hurt him! Please don't hurt him! Please, please don't
hurt him, 'cause I love him!" pleaded the agonized child, with
all the earnestness of her nature.</p>

<p>The position of the prostrate captain attempting to rise, and
the little one interceding for him, was such that the mutineer
hesitated for the moment, for he could not strike without endangering
her life. Seeing this, with the wonderful quickness which sometimes
comes over the youngest child in such a crisis, Inez persistently
forced her body with amazing quickness in the way of the poised
knife as it started to descend more than once&mdash;the other two holding
back for their leader to finish the work.</p>

<p>Brazzier was a man of tigerish temper, and he became infuriated
in a few seconds at this repeated baffling of his purpose.</p>

<p>"Confound you!" he suddenly exclaimed, with a fierce execration.
"If you will keep in the way, then you must take it!"</p>

<p>The arm was drawn still further back, with the intention of carrying
out this dreadful threat, when the wrist was seized in the iron
grip of Black Pomp, who said:</p>

<p>"Hold on, dere! None ob dat! De man dat hurts a ha'r ob dat little
gal's head will got sot down on by me, an' mashed so flat dat
he'll neber rose ag'in. Does you hear me, sah?"</p>
