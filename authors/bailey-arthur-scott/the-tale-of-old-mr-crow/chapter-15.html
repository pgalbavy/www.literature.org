<p>When Mr. Crow decided, one fall, that he would stay in Pleasant Valley
during the winter, instead of going South, he remembered at once that he
would need a thick overcoat.
</p>
<p>That was when he went to Mr. Frog's tailor's shop, for Mr. Frog, you
know, was a tailor.
</p><p>"I want you to make me a warm overcoat." Mr. Crow told him. "Can you do
it?"
</p><p>"Certainly!" said Mr. Frog. "You've come to the right place. Everybody
says that I'm the best tailor in Pleasant Valley." And that was quite
true--because he was the <u>only</u> one. "What'll you have--stripes, checks,
or spots?" Mr. Frog asked briskly.
</p><p>"What do you suggest?" Mr. Crow replied. He had not thought much about
his new coat--except that he wanted it to be warm.
</p><p>"Spots, by all means!" said Mr. Frog. "I always wear 'em myself. They're
the best, to my mind. For if you happen to get a spot on your coat,
what's one spot more?"
</p><p>"That's a good idea," Mr. Crow said. "And how much will you ask to make
me a spotted coat?"
</p><p>"I charge by the spot," said Mr. Frog. "The more spots, the more the coat
will cost. So I'd advise you to take a coat with large spots, because
there'll be fewer of 'em and the price will be less."
</p><p>"That's a good idea, too," said old Mr. Crow. "You may make my coat of
this!" He pointed to a piece of blue cloth with yellow spots about the
size of a dollar and a quarter.
</p><p>"Good!" said Mr. Frog. Then he measured Mr. Crow. And then he measured
the cloth. And then he scratched some figures on a flat stone. "There'll
be thirteen spots on your coat and that'll make just thirteen that you'll
owe me."
</p><p>"Thirteen what?" asked Mr. Crow.
</p><p>"Ah! That's the question!" said Mr. Frog, mysteriously. "I'll tell you
when your coat's finished. And you can pay me then. It's what is known as
'spot cash,'" he added.
</p><p>"Very well!" Mr. Crow answered. "And I'll come back--"
</p><p>"To-morrow!" said the tailor.
</p><p>When to-morrow came, Mr. Crow flew over to the pond where Mr. Frog had
his tailor's shop. And that spry gentleman slipped Mr. Crow's new coat
upon him. While Mr. Crow stood stiffly in the middle of the floor Mr.
Frog pulled the coat here and patted it there. He backed away and looked
at it, with his head on one side; and then he stood on his head and
looked at it, with his legs dangling in the air.
</p><p>"It's a perfect fit," he assured Mr. Crow, finally. And then he caught up
a needle and thread and busied himself behind Mr. Crow's back for a long
time.
</p><p>"What are you doing?" Mr. Crow inquired at last. "I'm getting tired of
standing still."
</p><p>"Just fixing it!" answered Mr. Frog. "It'll be finished in a minute."
</p><p>And it was. He stuck his needle into Mr. Crow, to let him know it was
done.
</p><p>Mr. Crow jumped half way across the room. "Why did you do that?" he asked
hotly.
</p><p>"I wanted to break my thread," Mr. Frog explained pleasantly. "It's the
quickest way of breaking a thread that I know of."
</p><p>"You look out, or I'll break something else for you," Mr. Crow squawked,
for he was thoroughly enraged. "And now," he added, "I'll pay you what I
owe before leaving. I owe thirteen of something."
</p><p>Then Mr. Frog surprised him.
</p><p>"I've decided not to take any pay," he announced. "I hear that thirteen
is an unlucky number."
</p><p>"Is that so?" Mr. Frog exclaimed. "Perhaps it is. If you had stuck your
needle into me thirteen times it certainly would have been unlucky for
you."
</p><p>On the whole Mr. Crow was well pleased with his bargain. He was glad
that he had asked Mr. Frog to make a coat for him. Indeed, if only the
tailor had not stabbed him with his needle, he would have returned to the
shop at once and ordered Mr. Frog to make him a pair of trousers--with
thirteen spots on them.
