<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>On the evening succeeding the departure of Jack Carleton and
Otto Relstaub from the little settlement of Martinsville, the
widowed mother of Jack was seated by her fireside engaged in knitting.
The night was cold, and the huge sticks of wood were roaring and
crackling in the broad fireplace, and throwing a cheerful glow
and warmth through the room. The tallow candle on the mantel had
not been lit, for there was no need of it, and, despite the loneliness
and poverty of the sad-faced woman, there was an air of neatness
and comfort about her home which would have tempted any one who
could look through the narrow window into the homely, old-fashioned
apartment.</p>

<p>The deft fingers flew back and forth as regularly as the most
delicate machinery, until all at once the lady stopped and allowed
her hands to rest in her lap. At the same moment a sigh escaped
her, and she looked into the glowing embers.</p>

<p>It was not hard to guess where her thoughts were; they were with
that only child who had gone forth in the woods to help the German
lad look for the missing horse. Mrs. Carleton smiled as she reflected
upon a certain absurdity which marked the whole business, for,
look at it as she chose, there was something grotesque in the
project of two youths setting out to hunt for a horse that had
been wandering for days in a limitless wood. But the smile quickly
gave way to the serious expression which not often left the face
of the mother since that awful night when her husband was stricken
down by the fierce red men of Kentucky.</p>

<p>"I trust God will not forget my boy," were the almost inaudible
words that came to her lips. "He has wonderfully preserved him
through many perils, and my heart misgives me now that I allowed
him to go from under my roof."</p>

<p>Just then the latch-string was spitefully pulled, the door was
pushed inward, and Jacob Relstaub entered. The angry man was short
of stature, clumsily dressed, and the only weapon he carried was
a heavy, knotted cane, if that may be termed such, which was his
companion when moving about the sparse settlement. It has already
been said that he was parsimonious, cross-grained, and cruel-hearted,
and he had been in specially ill-temper since the return of his
boy without the horse upon which so much value was set.</p>

<p>The door swung to of itself, and the German, stopping short in
the middle of the room, banged his cane upon the floor, and, looking
savagely at the quiet lady who had nodded and bidden him good
evening, demanded:</p>

<p>"Vere is mine poy, Otto?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" asked the widow in return, with a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"No, I does not; he says he goes off mit your poy, but dey both
lies&mdash;don't it?"</p>

<p>"My boy never tells a falsehood," was the quiet response of Mrs.
Carleton, whose pale cheek slightly flushed. "Your Otto told the
truth as you well know. Not only that, but he only obeyed you
when he went out in the woods to run into all kinds of danger
in search of an animal which I do not believe can possibly be
found."</p>

<p>"All poys ish bad," said the visitor with an impatient sniff,
as he took off his cap and slouched to a chair on the opposite
side of the fire. "Your poy ish badder dan any oder poy; mine
Otto is lazy, and if he doesn't pring pack dot horse I vill pounds
him till he don't live."</p>

<p>"He may <em>never</em> come back," said the lady in a low, impressive
voice which would have moved anyone else, but it was lost on the
boorish visitor.</p>

<p>"Hoof! No fear of dot; he alvays comes back ven ve doesn't vant
him to come back."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Carleton with a sigh, "I am sorry I let Jack
go, for if he had insisted on staying home your boy would have
done the same, though if I was in Otto's place I would consider
the woods, with all their dangers and sufferings, preferable to
living with a parent who is as unfeeling as you."</p>

<p>Jacob Relstaub had both of his horny hands folded over the top
of his heavy cane, which rested on the floor between his large
shoes, while his cap, somewhat resembling the peaked head-gear
of his boy, lay beside him. His broad, ill-favored countenance
was darkened by a frown, and it was easy for the lady to see that
the fellow still doubted her word. His manner of looking about
the large room, and a habit of listening intently, as though he
expected to bear approaching footsteps, showed that he suspected
Otto was hiding somewhere in the cabin. Mrs. Carleton understood
his feelings and she was annoyed to anger, for her sensitive nature
felt the insult keenly. Beside, she despised the coarse nature
of the man who seemed so totally lacking in humanity.</p>

<p>The lady was on the point of reproving him with sharp words,
when both were astonished by a gentle knock on the door, such
a hail being contrary to all the rules of the frontier, when the
latch-string is not drawn in. Both looked quickly toward the entrance,
and the lady raised her voice and said:</p>

<p>"The latch-string is out!"</p>

<p>The words were yet on her lips when it was pulled, and the door
swung inward.</p>

<p>The firelight fell upon the figure of an Indian warrior, who
stopped on the threshold as if he doubted whether he would be
welcome when those within saw him. As he stood with the blank
darkness behind him and the crimson glow from the burning logs
lighting up the front of his body, he formed a most striking picture.</p>

<p>He was the ideal of symmetry and manly beauty&mdash;one of those productions
of the American race which are very rare, but which, when seen,
are the nearest approach to physical and mental perfection that
is ever attained in this world. He was about five feet ten inches
in height, and with body and limbs in as perfect proportion as
the chisel of Phidias ever carved from marble. Even his long,
black hair, which hung luxuriantly and loosely about his shoulders,
was of softer texture than is the rule with his people. Several
stained eagle feathers slanted upward and outward from the crown,
and a double row of brilliant beads encircled his neck. A fine
gold bracelet clasped his left wrist, and the deer-skin hunting
shirt and leggings were clean, and of the finest possible make.
They retained their dull, yellow hue, but the girdle which clasped
his body at the waist was of a red color, so bright that it seemed
likely to attract dangerous attention in the forest. The leggings
were fringed, and the delicate moccasins were also ornamented
with colored beads. The heavy blanket which he carried during
severe weather was lacking, for it would have been only an encumbrance
when the climate was mild.</p>

<p>Into the girdle were thrust a tomahawk and hunting knife, while
a long bow was carried in his right hand, and a quiver full of
arrows rested behind his right shoulder, where they could be snatched
forth on the instant. The youthful warrior carried no firearms,
for he depended alone on the primitive weapons which his people
had used for centuries.</p>

<p>Splendid as were the frame and limbs of the youth, the greatest
attraction lay in his countenance. His features were classical
in their regularity, excepting the nose, which was just enough
aquiline to give character to his face, and take away the femininity
which otherwise might cling to it.</p>

<p>When he smiled in his faint, shadowy fashion, his teeth were
seen to be small, white, regular, and without the slightest defect,
while the lustrous black eyes glowed with light and feeling. Having
closed the door behind him, he still hesitated to advance until
assured he was welcome.</p>

<p>Although Mrs. Carleton had never seen him before, she was certain
of his identity, and, rising from her seat, she asked:</p>

<p>"Are you Deerfoot the Shawanoe?"</p>

<p>He smiled and inclined his head.</p>

<p>"You are the friend of my boy, and of Otto, the son of Mr. Relstaub.
There is no one in the world who could be more welcome than you.
Come forward and take a seat nearer the fire."</p>

<p>The dusky countenance flushed with pleasure, for the words were
warmer than he was accustomed to hear.</p>

<p>Deerfoot advanced a couple of steps, and, reaching over, drew
the rude stool to him. His diffidence would not allow him to go
very near the blaze.</p>

<p>When Jacob Relstaub heard the name pronounced, he uttered an
angry sniff and banged his cane upon the floor. He said nothing;
but he detested the handsome Indian youth, whom he had driven
from his door when he asked for shelter, and he knew he had been
the companion of his boy on the stirring journey from Kentucky
to Louisiana. It mattered not that the masterful woodcraft of
the dusky friend had saved the life of Otto Relstaub; all that
the German remembered was that the valuable horse was lost, and
he blamed this Indian for it, as he censured Jack Carleton for
the same misfortune. The man, however, said nothing for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>It was manifest from the manner of Deerfoot that he was disappointed
because he did not meet Jack Carleton. He cast but a single glance
around the apartment, which showed him his young friend was not
present; then, as he gently seated himself, he looked into the
pale face of the widow and said:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot sees not his brother."</p>

<p>"No; Jack and Otto set out on a long hunt this morning. They
may be back in a few days and perhaps not for a fortnight."</p>

<p>"Have they gone to look for the horse that was lost?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the lady, with a smile; "I am ashamed to say
they have; but I ask your pardon; have you had supper? Will you
not permit me to give you to eat?"</p>

<p>She was about to rise when Deerfoot, who was resting his bow
on the floor, while he grasped the center as though it was a cane,
motioned with his left hand for her to retain her seat.</p>

<p>"The mother of my friend is good and kind, but Deerfoot cannot
eat."</p>

<p>He appeared to be on the point of saying something more, but
restrained himself. The mother was quick to perceive it, and a
pang of dread stirred her heart.</p>

<p>"What were you about to say?" she asked, in her abrupt fashion,
suspending the knitting which she was in the very act of resuming.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was too truthful to deceive her outright; but it is
fair to presume he did not say all that was in his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is sorry his brothers have gone to look for the horse."</p>

<p>"Why?" quickly asked the mother.</p>

<p>"They cannot find him."</p>

<p>"Vy don't they finds him?" asked Jacob Relstaub, banging his
cane again and glaring fiercely at the youth, as though ready
to spring upon him.</p>

<p>Deerfoot looked calmly in the forbidding countenance, and asked,
more directly than was his custom:</p>

<p>"Are you the father of my brother, Otto?"</p>

<p>"Yaw; of course I ish. He is one pad poy, as you ish de wust
Injin dot effer vasn't."</p>

<p>Without the least visible excitement, and in the same deliberate
monotone, Deerfoot still looking him straight in the face:</p>

<p>"The father of Otto is a dog; he has no heart. The Great Spirit
hides his face with shame when he looks upon him."</p>

<p>"<em>VAT!" </em>roared Jacob, half rising to his chair and grasping
his knobby cane with both hands, while he trembled with rage.
"You don't speak dot vays to me and I breaks your head."</p>

<p>He suddenly straightened up, and all aglow with fury advanced
upon Deerfoot, who placed his left hand on his knife, quietly
arose and faced him, without speaking.</p>
