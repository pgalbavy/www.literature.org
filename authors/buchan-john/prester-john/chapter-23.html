<p>We got at the treasure by blowing open the turnstile.  It was
easy enough to trace the spot in the rock where it stood, but
the most patient search did not reveal its secret.  Accordingly
we had recourse to dynamite, and soon laid bare the stone steps,
and ascended to the gallery.  The chasm was bridged with planks,
and Arcoll and I crossed alone.  The cave was as I had left it. 
The bloodstains on the floor had grown dark with time, but the
ashes of the sacramental fire were still there to remind me of
the drama I had borne a part in.  When I looked at the way I had
escaped my brain grew dizzy at the thought of it.  I do not think
that all the gold on earth would have driven me a second time
to that awful escalade.  As for Arcoll, he could not see its possibility
at all.</p>

<p>'Only a madman could have done it,' he said, blinking his eyes
at the green linn.  'Indeed, Davie, I think for about four days
you were as mad as they make.  It was a fortunate thing, for your
madness saved the country.'</p>

<p>With some labour we got the treasure down to the path, and took
it under a strong guard to Pietersdorp.  The Government were busy
with the settling up after the war, and it took many weeks to
have our business disposed of.  At first things looked badly for
me.  The Attorney-General set up a claim to the whole as spoils
of war, since, he argued, it was the war-chest of the enemy we
had conquered.  I do not know how the matter would have gone on
legal grounds, though I was advised by my lawyers that the claim
was a bad one.  But the part I had played in the whole business,
more especially in the visit to Inanda's Kraal, had made me a
kind of popular hero, and the Government thought better of their
first attitude.  Besides, Arcoll had great influence, and the
whole story of my doings, which was told privately by him to some
of the members of the Government, disposed them to be generous.
Accordingly they agreed to treat the contents of the cave as ordinary
treasure trove, of which, by the law, one half went to the discoverer
and one half to the Crown.</p>

<p>This was well enough so far as the gold was concerned, but another
difficulty arose about the diamonds; for a large part of these
had obviously been stolen by labourers from the mines, and the
mining people laid claim to them as stolen goods.  I was advised
not to dispute this claim, and consequently we had a great sorting-out
of the stones in the presence of the experts of the different
mines.  In the end it turned out that identification was not an
easy matter, for the experts quarrelled furiously among themselves. 
A compromise was at last come to, and a division made; and then
the diamond companies behaved very handsomely, voting me a substantial
sum in recognition of my services in recovering their property. 
What with this and with my half share of the gold and my share
of the unclaimed stones, I found that I had a very considerable
fortune.  The whole of my stones I sold to De Beers, for if I
had placed them on the open market I should have upset the delicate
equipoise of diamond values.  When I came finally to cast up my
accounts, I found that I had secured a fortune of a trifle over
a quarter of a million pounds.</p>

<p>The wealth did not dazzle so much as it solemnized me.  I had
no impulse to spend any part of it in a riot of folly.  It had
come to me like fairy gold out of the void; it had been bought
with men's blood, almost with my own.  I wanted to get away to
a quiet place and think, for of late my life had been too crowded
with drama, and there comes a satiety of action as well as of
idleness.  Above all things I wanted to get home. They gave me
a great send-off, and sang songs, and good fellows shook my hand
till it ached.  The papers were full of me, and there was a banquet
and speeches.  But I could not relish this glory as I ought, for
I was like a boy thrown violently out of his bearings. Not till
I was in the train nearing Cape Town did I recover my equanimity.
The burden of the past seemed to slip from me suddenly as on the
morning when I had climbed the linn. I saw my life all lying before
me; and already I had won success.  I thought of my return to
my own country, my first sight of the grey shores of Fife, my
visit to Kirkcaple, my meeting with my mother.  I was a rich man
now who could choose his career, and my mother need never again
want for comfort.  My money seemed pleasant to me, for if men
won theirs by brains or industry, I had won mine by sterner methods,
for I had staked against it my life.  I sat alone in the railway
carriage and cried with pure thankfulness.  These were comforting
tears, for they brought me back to my old common-place self.</p>

<p>My last memory of Africa is my meeting with Tam Dyke.  I caught
sight of him in the streets of Cape Town, and running after him,
clapped him on the shoulder.  He stared at me as if he had seen
a ghost.</p>

<p>'Is it yourself, Davie?' he cried.  'I never looked to see you
again in this world.  I do nothing but read about you in the papers. 
What for did ye not send for me?  Here have I been knocking about
inside a ship and you have been getting famous.  They tell me
you're a millionaire, too.'</p>

<p>I had Tam to dinner at my hotel, and later, sitting smoking on
the terrace and watching the flying-ants among the aloes, I told
him the better part of the story I have here written down.</p>

<p>'Man, Davie,' he said at the end, 'you've had a tremendous time. 
Here are you not eighteen months away from home, and you're going
back with a fortune.  What will you do with it?' I told him that
I proposed, to begin with, to finish my education at Edinburgh
College.  At this he roared with laughter.</p>

<p>'That's a dull ending, anyway.  It's me that should have the
money, for I'm full of imagination.  You were aye a prosaic body,
Davie.'</p>

<p>'Maybe I am,' I said; 'but I am very sure of one thing.  If I
hadn't been a prosaic body, I wouldn't be sitting here to-night.'</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Two years later Aitken found the diamond pipe, which he had always
believed lay in the mountains.  Some of the stones in the cave,
being unlike any ordinary African diamonds, confirmed his suspicions
and set him on the track.  A Kaffir tribe to the north-east of
the Rooirand had known of it, but they had never worked it, but
only collected the overspill.  The closing down of one of the
chief existing mines had created a shortage of diamonds in the
world's markets, and once again the position was the same as when
Kimberley began.  Accordingly he made a great fortune, and to-day
the Aitken Proprietary Mine is one of the most famous in the country. 
But Aitken did more than mine diamonds, for he had not forgotten
the lesson we had learned together in the work of resettlement. 
He laid down a big fund for the education and amelioration of
the native races, and the first fruit of it was the establishment
at Blaauwildebeestefontein itself of a great native training college. 
It was no factory for making missionaries and black teachers,
but an institution for giving the Kaffirs the kind of training
which fits them to be good citizens of the state.  There you will
find every kind of technical workshop, and the finest experimental
farms, where the blacks are taught modern agriculture.  They have
proved themselves apt pupils, and to-day you will see in the glens
of the Berg and in the plains Kaffir tillage which is as scientific
as any in Africa.  They have created a huge export trade in tobacco
and fruit; the cotton promises well; and there is talk of a new
fibre which will do wonders.  Also along the river bottoms the
india-rubber business is prospering.</p>

<p>There are playing-fields and baths and reading-rooms and libraries
just as in a school at home.  In front of the great hall of the
college a statue stands, the figure of a black man shading his
eyes with his hands and looking far over the plains to the Rooirand. 
On the pedestal it is lettered 'Prester John,' but the face is
the face of Laputa.  So the last of the kings of Africa does not
lack his monument.</p>

<p>Of this institution Mr Wardlaw is the head.  He writes to me
weekly, for I am one of the governors, as well as an old friend,
and from a recent letter I take this passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I often cast my mind back to the afternoon when you and I sat
on the stoep of the schoolhouse, and talked of the Kaffirs and
our future.  I had about a dozen pupils then, and now I have nearly
three thousand; and in place of a tin-roofed shanty and a yard,
I have a whole countryside.  You laughed at me for my keenness,
Davie, but I've seen it justified.  I was never a man of war like
you, and so I had to bide at home while you and your like were
straightening out the troubles. But when it was all over my job
began, for I could do what you couldn't do &mdash;I was the physician
to heal wounds.  You mind how nervous I was when I heard the drums
beat.  I hear them every evening now, for we have made a rule
that all the Kaffir farms on the Berg sound a kind of curfew. 
It reminds me of old times, and tells me that though it is peace
nowadays we mean to keep all the manhood in them that they used
to exercise in war.  It would do your eyes good to see the garden
we have made out of the Klein Labongo glen.  The place is one
big orchard with every kind of tropical fruit in it, and the irrigation
dam is as full of fish as it will hold.  Out at Umvelos' there
is a tobacco-factory, and all round Sikitola's we have square
miles of mealie and cotton fields.  The loch on the Rooirand is
stocked with Lochleven trout, and we have made a bridle-path up
to it in a gully east of the one you climbed.  You ask about Machudi's. 
The last time I was there the place was white with sheep, for
we have got the edge of the plateau grazed down, and sheep can
get the short bite there.  We have cleaned up all the kraals,
and the chiefs are members of our county council, and are as fond
of hearing their own voices as an Aberdeen bailie.  It's a queer
transformation we have wrought, and when I sit and smoke my pipe
in the evening, and look over the plains and then at the big black
statue you and Aitken set up, I thank the Providence that has
guided me so far.  I hope and trust that, in the Bible words,
"the wilderness and the solitary place are glad for us." At any
rate it will not be my fault if they don't "blossom as the rose". 
Come out and visit us soon, man, and see the work you had a hand
in starting....'</p>

<p>I am thinking seriously of taking Wardlaw's advice.</p>
