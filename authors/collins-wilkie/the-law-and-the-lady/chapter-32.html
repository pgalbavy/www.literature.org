 THE scene must follow my erratic movements--the scene must close
on London for a while, and open in Edinburgh. Two days had passed
since Major Fitz-David's dinner-party. I was able to breathe
again freely, after the utter destruction of all my plans for the
future, and of all the hopes that I had founded on them. I could
now see that I had been trebly in the wrong--wrong in hastily and
cruelly suspecting an innocent woman; wrong in communicating my
suspicions (without an attempt to verify them previously) to
another person; wrong in accepting the flighty inferences and
conclusions of Miserrimus Dexter as if they had been solid
truths. I was so ashamed of my folly, when I thought of the
past--so completely discouraged, so rudely shaken in my
confidence in myself, when I thought of the future, that, for
once in a way, I accepted sensible advice when it was offered to
me. "My dear," said good old Benjamin, after we had thoroughly
talked over my discomfiture on our return from the dinner-party,
"judging by what you tell me of him, I don't fancy Mr. Dexter.
Promise me that you will not go back to him until you have first
consulted some person who is fitter to guide you through this
dangerous business than I am.
<P>
I gave him my promise, on one condition. "If I fail to find the
person," I said, "will you undertake to help me?"
<P>
Benjamin pledged himself to help me, cheerfully.
<P>
The next morning, when I was brushing my hair, and thinking over
my affairs, I called to mind a forgotten resolution of mine at
the time I first read the Report of my husband's Trial. I mean
the resolution--if Miserrimus Dexter failed me--to apply to one
of the two agents (or solicitors, as we should term them) who had
prepared Eustace's defense--namely, Mr. Playmore. This gentleman,
it may be remembered, had especially recommended himself to my
confidence by his friendly interference when the sheriff's
officers were in search of my husband's papers. Referring back to
the evidence Of "Isaiah Schoolcraft," I found that Mr. Playmore
had been called in to assist and advise Eustace by Miserrimus
Dexter. He was therefore not only a friend on whom I might rely,
but a friend who was personally acquainted with Dexter as well.
Could there be a fitter man to apply to for enlightenment in the
darkness that had now gathered around me? Benjamin, when I put
the question to him, acknowledged that I had made a sensible
choice on this occasion, and at once exerted himself to help me.
He discovered (through his own lawyer) the address of Mr.
Playmore's London agents; and from these gentlemen he obtained
for me a letter of introduction to Mr. Playmore himself. I had
nothing to conceal from my new adviser; and I was properly
described in the letter as Eustace Macallan's second wife.
<P>
The same evening we two set forth (Benjamin refused to let me
travel alone) by the night mail for Edinburgh.
<P>
I had previously written to Miserrimus Dexter (by my old friend's
advice), merely saying that I had been unexpectedly called away
from London for a few days, and that I would report to him the
result of my interview with Lady Clarinda on my return. A
characteristic answer was brought back to the cottage by Ariel:
"Mrs. Valeria, I happen to be a man of quick perceptions; and I
can read the _unwritten_ part of your letter. Lady Clarinda has
shaken your confidence in me. Very good. I pledge myself to shake
your confidence in Lady Clarinda. In the meantime I am not
offended. In serene composure I await the honor and the happiness
of your visit. Send me word by telegraph whether you would like
Truffles again, or whether you would prefer something simpler and
lighter--say that incomparable French dish, Pig's Eyelids and
Tamarinds. Believe me always your ally and admirer, your poet and
cook--DEXTER."
<P>
Arrived in Edinburgh, Benjamin and I had a little discussion. The
question in dispute between us was whether I should go with hi m,
or go alone, to Mr. Playmore. I was all for going alone.
<P>
"My experience of the world is not a very large one," I said.
"But I have observed that, in nine cases out of ten, a man will
make concessions to a woman, if she approaches him by her self,
which he would hesitate even to consider if another man was
within hearing. I don't know how it is--I only know that it is
so; If I find that I get on badly with Mr. Playmore, I will ask
him for a second appointment, and, in that case, you shall
accompany me. Don't think me self-willed. Let me try my luck
alone, and let us see what comes of it."
<P>
Benjamin yielded, with his customary consideration for me. I sent
my letter of introduction to Mr. Playmore's office--his private
house being in the neighborhood of Gleninch. My messenger brought
back a polite answer, inviting me to visit him at an early hour
in the afternoon. At the appointed time, to the moment, I rang
the bell at the office door.
