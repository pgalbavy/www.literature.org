<p>IT did not take the boys long to become acquainted with Strubell
and Lattin. The former showed by his conversation that he possessed
a fair education, though Lattin was barely able to write his name.
They were frank, outspoken, courageous, ready of resource, familiar
with all the dangers they were likely to meet on the long ride
toward the northwest, and the finest horsemen the boys had ever
seen.</p>

<p>Through the help of the Texans, Nick and Herbert secured three
excellent animals, two of them possessing great speed and endurance,
while the third was the equal of the best burro or mule for carrying
a heavy burden. The Winchesters were the best, too, of their kind,
the men being similarly armed. Nick and Herbert took care to provide
themselves with an excellent field-glass apiece, for nothing was
more likely than that they would find abundant call for their
use. The rest of the supplies were bought on the advice of the
cowboys.</p>

<p>They passed near a number of towns and settlements during the
first week, in one of which they generally stayed overnight. So
long as they were able to secure the comforts of ordinary travel
through a settled section, they would have been foolish to decline
it.</p>

<p>It had been so long since the boys had ridden far on horseback,
that they were stiffened for the first few days, so that, when
they dismounted, they were hardly able to walk. This, however,
soon wore off until they were able to stand a ride of forty or
fifty miles without any ill effects.</p>

<p>No physician could have watched a patient with greater care than
Nick watched Herbert. He tried to keep it from the knowledge of
his friend, and thought he succeeded, though Herbert told him
afterward that he knew all the time what he was doing.</p>

<p>The elder youth felt bad when they reached St. Louis, and was
still worse on their arrival in San Antonio. The long ride in
the cars made him feverish, and he had little appetite, but the
new scenes and surroundings, the cheerful company of Nick, and
his own ambition did wonders in the way of keeping him up.</p>

<p>He showed an improvement within twenty-four hours after arriving
in the City of the Alamo, and this continued steadily, until the
second day out, when the beautiful weather, that they had been
having for weeks, was broken by a norther which, however, was
not severe, though it brought so much rain and dismal weather
that they were compelled to lie by at one of the straggling frontier
towns for several days.</p>

<p>They rode through the hills and highlands between Fredericksburg
and Fort Clark, fording a tributary of the Llano River, and pushing
almost due northwest toward New Mexico, whose southeast corner
they were aiming to strike at the point of intersection between
the twenty-sixth meridian and thirty-second parallel.</p>

<p>The country now began to assume a wilder appearance. The weather
was like a dream, and Nick could well understand how it is that
more than twenty thousand people in Texas never sleep under a
roof from one year’s end to another. He could appreciate, too,
the reason why the immigrant, no matter how homesick, who braves
it out for six months, never leaves Texas unless for a brief visit
to his northern home, returning to die in the Lone Star State,
which has become the land of his adoption.</p>

<p>The appearance showed the country, or rather that portion of
it, to contain a great many more people than the boys supposed
before entering Texas. The settlements were generally miserable
collections of shanties, with the inevitable gambling and drinking
saloon and the quota of "bad men," on the lookout for tenderfeet,
or those of their own class that were ready to mingle in a row
off-hand. Everyone rode on horseback, and carried his revolver
and rifle, the latter generally a Winchester of the repeating
pattern.</p>

<p>The cattlemen were numerous, some of them nearly always in sight
among the hills, or on the broad, rolling prairie. Occasionally
an Indian was met, but he was far from being the romantic individual
that boys generally have in mind, when reading about the noble
red man. He was untidy and sullen looking, with an appetite for
whiskey that was never sated, and the odor of rank tobacco around
him.</p>

<p>It was about a week after the departure from San Antonio that
the youths noticed a marked change in things. The country became
more broken, the settlements disappeared, and during the middle
of the afternoon, when Herbert swept the horizon with his field
glass, he made known, with an expression of surprise, that there
was not a living person, so far as he knew, in sight.</p>

<p>"We’ve put a good piece of country behind us," said Strubell,
"and if nothing goes wrong, we ought to strike New Mexico in the
course of the next ten days."</p>

<p>Nick laughed.</p>

<p>"I fancied we would make it in less time than that."</p>

<p>"So we mought," remarked Lattin, "if there was any call to hurry;
but, as I understand this business, we aint runnin’ the pony express
for Santa Fé or Rincon."</p>

<p>That night their camp was in a section which charmed the boys,
for there was an air of loneliness, and the danger that seemed
to be brooding over the vicinity was of a kind not yet encountered
since entering Texas.</p>

<p>In some respects, the camp reminded them of their moose hunt
in Maine, though the contrast in the season was marked. There
were the hills, rising almost to the dignity of mountains, the
bowlders and rocks, the stream of water, not more than a few inches
in width and depth, and the beautiful blue sky overhead.</p>

<p>The weather was cooler than it had been, and the hunters shook
their heads, and hinted about a norther that was liable to break
over them before many hours. There were no signs of Indians, and
had there been, the aborigines would have been held in no greater
dread than those of their own race. The party were so far westward
that the arm of the law was weak, and everyone must depend on
his own vigilance and alertness.</p>

<p>When the wood, which was not over abundant in those parts, was
collected for the fire by which they intended to cook the meat
obtained from a maverick earlier in the day, the horses were turned
loose, and the four friends gathered around the blaze, which was
kindled in an open space, where the light was visible for a long
way in nearly every direction. Around this they sat, and, while
the men smoked their pipes, they recalled many a thrilling encounter
with the red men in the Pan Handle, in Arizona, and in New Mexico.
Strubell and Lattin were equally interested in the story which
Nick told of their hunt for the king of moose in Maine. That species
of game was unfamiliar to them, and when they learned of the gallant
style in which Herbert brought down the big fellow at the moment
he was charging upon his companion, they looked upon the tall
youth with something like wonder and admiration. They had no idea
of having such a hero "in their midst."</p>

<p>Since it was necessary that everyone should bear a hand in guarding
against the perils on which they were entering, the hunters arranged
that the youths should regularly take part in standing watch each
night. Their method made it easy and safe for all, since the watches
were four in number, each about two hours long. Everyone was able
to keep awake for that length of time, even while sitting on the
ground, and the turns alternated, so as to equalize the task all
round. Had the watches been longer, the youths, as was the case
while down East, would have been likely to slumber on their posts.</p>

<p>Arden Strubell was stretched out on the further side of the fire,
flat on his back, his head resting on a stone, which was softened
somewhat by his hands that were clasped between it and the back
of his head, with the elbows projecting like wings from each side.
One leg was partly drawn up, with the other crossed over it, his
position being the picture of indolence and ease. The pipe, whose
stem was in the corner of his mouth, was only gently puffed at
long intervals, for it was Arden’s turn to sleep until eleven
o’clock. He was, therefore, taking no share in the conversation
which went on in such gentle, murmuring tones that it tended more
to drowsiness than wakefulness on his part.</p>

<p>Matters were in this form, and the night was progressing, when
Lattin, who was sitting directly opposite his friend, raised his
hand for silence, and said in a frightened whisper:</p>

<p>"Arden, don’t move or you’re a dead man!"</p>

<p>"I know it," was the quiet reply from the Texan, who did not
stir a muscle, "but what can I do? I’m a dead man anyway."</p>
