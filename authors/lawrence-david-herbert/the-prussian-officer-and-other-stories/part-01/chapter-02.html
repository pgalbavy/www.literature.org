<p>He was getting used even to his parched throat.  That the snowy
peaks were radiant among the sky, that the whity-green glacier-
river twisted through its pale shoals, in the valley below, seemed
almost supernatural.  But he was going mad with fever and thirst.
He plodded on uncomplaining.  He did not want to speak, not to
anybody.  There were two gulls, like flakes of water and snow, over
the river.  The scent of green rye soaked in sunshine came like a
sickness.  And the march continued, monotonously, almost like a bad
sleep.</p>

<p>At the next farm-house, which stood low and broad near the high
road, tubs of water had been put out.  The soldiers clustered round
to drink.  They took off their helmets, and the steam mounted from
their wet hair.  The Captain sat on horseback, watching.  He needed
to see his orderly.  His helmet threw a dark shadow over his light,
fierce eyes, but his moustache and mouth and chin were distinct in
the sunshine.  The orderly must move under the presence of the
figure of the horseman.  It was not that he was afraid, or cowed.
It was as if he was disembowelled, made empty, like an empty shell.
He felt himself as nothing, a shadow creeping under the sunshine.
And, thirsty as he was, he could scarcely drink, feeling the
Captain near him.  He would not take off his helmet to wipe his wet
hair.  He wanted to stay in shadow, not to be forced into
consciousness.  Starting, he saw the light heel of the officer
prick the belly of the horse; the Captain cantered away, and he
himself could relapse into vacancy.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, could give him back his living place in the hot,
bright morning.  He felt like a gap among it all.  Whereas the
Captain was prouder, overriding.  A hot flash went through the
young servant's body.  The Captain was firmer and prouder with
life, he himself was empty as a shadow.  Again the flash went
through him, dazing him out.  But his heart ran a little firmer.</p>

<p>The company turned up the hill, to make a loop for the return.
Below, from among the trees, the farm-bell clanged.  He saw the
labourers, mowing barefoot at the thick grass, leave off their work
and go downhill, their scythes hanging over their shoulders, like
long, bright claws curving down behind them.  They seemed like
dream-people, as if they had no relation to himself.  He felt as in
a blackish dream: as if all the other things were there and had
form, but he himself was only a consciousness, a gap that could
think and perceive.</p>

<p>The soldiers were tramping silently up the glaring hillside.
Gradually his head began to revolve, slowly, rhythmically.
Sometimes it was dark before his eyes, as if he saw this world
through a smoked glass, frail shadows and unreal.  It gave him a
pain in his head to walk.</p>

<p>The air was too scented, it gave no breath.  All the lush
greenstuff seemed to be issuing its sap, till the air was deathly,
sickly with the smell of greenness.  There was the perfume of
clover, like pure honey and bees.  Then there grew a faint acrid
tang - they were near the beeches; and then a queer clattering
noise, and a suffocating, hideous smell; they were passing a flock
of sheep, a shepherd in a black smock, holding his crook.  Why
should the sheep huddle together under this fierce sun?  He felt
that the shepherd would not see him, though he could see the
shepherd.</p>

<p>At last there was the halt.  They stacked rifles in a conical
stack, put down their kit in a scattered circle around it, and
dispersed a little, sitting on a small knoll high on the hillside.
The chatter began.  The soldiers were steaming with heat, but were
lively.  He sat still, seeing the blue mountains rising upon the
land, twenty kilometres away.  There was a blue fold in the ranges,
then out of that, at the foot, the broad, pale bed of the river,
stretches of whity-green water between pinkish-grey shoals among
the dark pine woods.  There it was, spread out a long way off.  And
it seemed to come downhill, the river.  There was a raft being
steered, a mile away.  It was a strange country.  Nearer, a red-
roofed, broad farm with white base and square dots of windows
crouched beside the wall of beech foliage on the wood's edge.
There were long strips of rye and clover and pale green corn.  And
just at his feet, below the knoll, was a darkish bog, where globe
flowers stood breathless still on their slim stalks.  And some of
the pale gold bubbles were burst, and a broken fragment hung in the
air.  He thought he was going to sleep.</p>

<p>Suddenly something moved into this coloured mirage before his eyes.
The Captain, a small, light-blue and scarlet figure, was trotting
evenly between the strips of corn, along the level brow of the
hill.  And the man making flag-signals was coming on.  Proud and
sure moved the horseman's figure, the quick, bright thing, in which
was concentrated all the light of this morning, which for the rest
lay a fragile, shining shadow.  Submissive, apathetic, the young
soldier sat and stared.  But as the horse slowed to a walk, coming
up the last steep path, the great flash flared over the body and
soul of the orderly.  He sat waiting.  The back of his head felt as
if it were weighted with a heavy piece of fire.  He did not want to
eat.  His hands trembled slightly as he moved them.  Meanwhile the
officer on horseback was approaching slowly and proudly.  The
tension grew in the orderly's soul.  Then again, seeing the Captain
ease himself on the saddle, the flash blazed through him.</p>

<p>The Captain looked at the patch of light blue and scarlet, and dark
heads, scattered closely on the hillside.  It pleased him.  The
command pleased him.  And he was feeling proud.  His orderly was
among them in common subjection.  The officer rose a little on his
stirrups to look.  The young soldier sat with averted, dumb face.
The Captain relaxed on his seat.  His slim-legged, beautiful horse,
brown as a beech nut, walked proudly uphill.  The Captain passed
into the zone of the company's atmosphere: a hot smell of men, of
sweat, of leather.  He knew it very well.  After a word with the
lieutenant, he went a few paces higher, and sat there, a dominant
figure, his sweat-marked horse swishing its tail, while he looked
down on his men, on his orderly, a nonentity among the crowd.</p>

<p>The young soldier's heart was like fire in his chest, and he
breathed with difficulty.  The officer, looking downhill, saw three
of the young soldiers, two pails of water between them, staggering
across a sunny green field.  A table had been set up under a tree,
and there the slim lieutenant stood, importantly busy.  Then the
Captain summoned himself to an act of courage.  He called his
orderly.</p>

<p>The flame leapt into the young soldier's throat as he heard the
command, and he rose blindly, stifled.  He saluted, standing below
the officer.  He did not look up.  But there was the flicker in the
Captain's voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Go to the inn and fetch me . . .&quot; the officer gave his commands.
&quot;Quick!&quot; he added.</p>

<p>At the last word, the heart of the servant leapt with a flash, and
he felt the strength come over his body.  But he turned in
mechanical obedience, and set off at a heavy run downhill, looking
almost like a bear, his trousers bagging over his military boots.
And the officer watched this blind, plunging run all the way.</p>

<p>But it was only the outside of the orderly's body that was obeying
so humbly and mechanically.  Inside had gradually accumulated a
core into which all the energy of that young life was compact and
concentrated.  He executed his commission, and plodded quickly back
uphill.  There was a pain in his head, as he walked, that made him
twist his features unknowingly.  But hard there in the centre of
his chest was himself, himself, firm, and not to be plucked to
pieces.</p>

<p>The Captain had gone up into the wood.  The orderly plodded through
the hot, powerfully smelling zone of the company's atmosphere.  He
had a curious mass of energy inside him now.  The Captain was less
real than himself.  He approached the green entrance to the wood.
There, in the half-shade, he saw the horse standing, the sunshine
and the flickering shadow of leaves dancing over his brown body.
There was a clearing where timber had lately been felled.  Here, in
the gold-green shade beside the brilliant cup of sunshine, stood
two figures, blue and pink, the bits of pink showing out plainly.
The Captain was talking to his lieutenant.</p>

<p>The orderly stood on the edge of the bright clearing, where great
trunks of trees, stripped and glistening, lay stretched like naked,
brown-skinned bodies.  Chips of wood littered the trampled floor,
like splashed light, and the bases of the felled trees stood here
and there, with their raw, level tops.  Beyond was the brilliant,
sunlit green of a beech.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I will ride forward,&quot; the orderly heard his Captain say.  The
lieutenant saluted and strode away.  He himself went forward.  A
hot flash passed through his belly, as he tramped towards his
officer.</p>

<p>The Captain watched the rather heavy figure of the young soldier
stumble forward, and his veins, too, ran hot.  This was to be man
to man between them.  He yielded before the solid, stumbling figure
with bent head.  The orderly stooped and put the food on a level-
sawn tree-base.  The Captain watched the glistening, sun-inflamed,
naked hands.  He wanted to speak to the young soldier, but could
not.  The servant propped a bottle against his thigh, pressed open
the cork, and poured out the beer into the mug.  He kept his head
bent.  The Captain accepted the mug.</p>

<p>&quot;Hot!&quot; he said, as if amiably.</p>

<p>The flame sprang out of the orderly's heart, nearly suffocating
him.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; he replied, between shut teeth.</p>

<p>And he heard the sound of the Captain's drinking, and he clenched
his fists, such a strong torment came into his wrists.  Then came
the faint clang of the closing pot-lid.  He looked up.  The Captain
was watching him.  He glanced swiftly away.  Then he saw the
officer stoop and take a piece of bread from the tree-base.  Again
the flash of flame went through the young soldier, seeing the stiff
body stoop beneath him, and his hands jerked.  He looked away.  He
could feel the officer was nervous.  The bread fell as it was being
broken.  The officer ate the other piece.  The two men stood tense
and still, the master laboriously chewing his bread, the servant
staring with averted face, his fist clenched.</p>

<p>Then the young soldier started.  The officer had pressed open the
lid of the mug again.  The orderly watched the lid of the mug, and
the white hand that clenched the handle, as if he were fascinated.
It was raised.  The youth followed it with his eyes.  And then he
saw the thin, strong throat of the elder man moving up and down as
he drank, the strong jaw working.  And the instinct which had been
jerking at the young man's wrists suddenly jerked free.  He jumped,
feeling as if it were rent in two by a strong flame.</p>

<p>The spur of the officer caught in a tree-root, he went down
backwards with a crash, the middle of his back thudding sickeningly
against a sharp-edged tree-base, the pot flying away.  And in a
second the orderly, with serious, earnest young face, and underlip
between his teeth, had got his knee in the officer's chest and was
pressing the chin backward over the farther edge of the tree-stump,
pressing, with all his heart behind in a passion of relief, the
tension of his wrists exquisite with relief.  And with the base of
his palms he shoved at the chin, with all his might.  And it was
pleasant, too, to have that chin, that hard jaw already slightly
rough with beard, in his hands.  He did not relax one hair's
breadth, but, all the force of all his blood exulting in his
thrust, he shoved back the head of the other man, till there was a
little &quot;cluck&quot; and a crunching sensation.  Then he felt as if his
head went to vapour.  Heavy convulsions shook the body of the
officer, frightening and horrifying the young soldier.  Yet it
pleased him, too, to repress them.  It pleased him to keep his
hands pressing back the chin, to feel the chest of the other man
yield in expiration to the weight of his strong, young knees, to
feel the hard twitchings of the prostrate body jerking his own
whole frame, which was pressed down on it.</p>

<p>But it went still.  He could look into the nostrils of the other
man, the eyes he could scarcely see.  How curiously the mouth was
pushed out, exaggerating the full lips, and the moustache bristling
up from them.  Then, with a start, he noticed the nostrils
gradually filled with blood.  The red brimmed, hesitated, ran over,
and went in a thin trickle down the face to the eyes.</p>

<p>It shocked and distressed him.  Slowly, he got up.  The body
twitched and sprawled there, inert.  He stood and looked at it in
silence.  It was a pity IT was broken.  It represented more than
the thing which had kicked and bullied him.  He was afraid to look
at the eyes.  They were hideous now, only the whites showing, and
the blood running to them.  The face of the orderly was drawn with
horror at the sight.  Well, it was so.  In his heart he was
satisfied.  He had hated the face of the Captain.  It was
extinguished now.  There was a heavy relief in the orderly's soul.
That was as it should be.  But he could not bear to see the long,
military body lying broken over the tree-base, the fine fingers
crisped.  He wanted to hide it away.</p>

<p>Quickly, busily, he gathered it up and pushed it under the felled
tree-trunks, which rested their beautiful, smooth length either end
on logs.  The face was horrible with blood.  He covered it with the
helmet.  Then he pushed the limbs straight and decent, and brushed
the dead leaves off the fine cloth of the uniform.  So, it lay
quite still in the shadow under there.  A little strip of sunshine
ran along the breast, from a chink between the logs.  The orderly
sat by it for a few moments.  Here his own life also ended.</p>

<p>Then, through his daze, he heard the lieutenant, in a loud voice,
explaining to the men outside the wood, that they were to suppose
the bridge on the river below was held by the enemy.  Now they were
to march to the attack in such and such a manner.  The lieutenant
had no gift of expression.  The orderly, listening from habit, got
muddled.  And when the lieutenant began it all again he ceased to
hear.</p>

<p>He knew he must go.  He stood up.  It surprised him that the leaves
were glittering in the sun, and the chips of wood reflecting white
from the ground.  For him a change had come over the world.  But
for the rest it had not - all seemed the same.  Only he had left it.
And he could not go back.  It was his duty to return with the beer-
pot and the bottle.  He could not.  He had left all that.  The
lieutenant was still hoarsely explaining.  He must go, or they
would overtake him.  And he could not bear contact with anyone now.</p>

<p>He drew his fingers over his eyes, trying to find out where he was.
Then he turned away.  He saw the horse standing in the path.  He
went up to it and mounted.  It hurt him to sit in the saddle.  The
pain of keeping his seat occupied him as they cantered through the
wood.  He would not have minded anything, but he could not get away
from the sense of being divided from the others.  The path led out
of the trees.  On the edge of the wood he pulled up and stood
watching.  There in the spacious sunshine of the valley soldiers
were moving in a little swarm.  Every now and then, a man harrowing
on a strip of fallow shouted to his oxen, at the turn.  The village
and the white-towered church was small in the sunshine.  And he no
longer belonged to it - he sat there, beyond, like a man outside in
the dark.  He had gone out from everyday life into the unknown, and
he could not, he even did not want to go back.</p>

<p>Turning from the sun-blazing valley, he rode deep into the wood.
Tree-trunks, like people standing grey and still, took no notice as
he went.  A doe, herself a moving bit of sunshine and shadow, went
running through the flecked shade.  There were bright green rents
in the foliage.  Then it was all pine wood, dark and cool.  And he
was sick with pain, he had an intolerable great pulse in his head,
and he was sick.  He had never been ill in his life.  He felt lost,
quite dazed with all this.</p>

<p>Trying to get down from the horse, he fell, astonished at the pain
and his lack of balance.  The horse shifted uneasily.  He jerked
its bridle and sent it cantering jerkily away.  It was his last
connection with the rest of things.</p>

<p>But he only wanted to lie down and not be disturbed.  Stumbling
through the trees, he came on a quiet place where beeches and pine
trees grew on a slope.  Immediately he had lain down and closed his
eyes, his consciousness went racing on without him.  A big pulse of
sickness beat in him as if it throbbed through the whole earth.  He
was burning with dry heat.  But he was too busy, too tearingly
active in the incoherent race of delirium to observe.</p>
