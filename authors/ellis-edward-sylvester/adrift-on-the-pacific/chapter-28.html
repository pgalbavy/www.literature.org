<p>"Poor Jack!" murmured Abe Storms, hastening after him. "I have
been fearing this very thing. He has taken the matter more to
heart than I, and there has been a look in his eye in the last
few weeks which showed he was not right; but I thought, when he
found he was going back to his home again, he would almost instantly
regain his mental equipoise.</p>

<p>"But it has operated the other way, and I shouldn't wonder if
he is as wild as a loon. When we get him away, dress him up, change
his food, and give him a sight of a Boston vessel, he will be
sure to come around; but, he has said too much already.</p>

<p>"I wonder what sort of a fellow that Fred Sanders is?" added
Storms, whose intellect seemed to be sharpened by the same cause
which overturned that of the captain. "I would be glad to trust
him fully, but somehow, I can't. While he is courteous and kind&mdash;and,
no doubt, means to carry us all to the inhabited island, where
we shall be able to take care of ourselves&mdash;there is something
about him that awakens distrust. The fact of his having been five
years, as he says, in these South Sea Islands, shows that all
is not right, which is confirmed by his dislike of saying anything
about his earlier history.</p>

<p>"The best thing in his favor is his youth, and yet," continued
Storms, thoughtfully, "that, after all, may be the worst. It would
seem that he is too young to have done a great deal of evil; and
yet, if he has committed many transgressions, it is a woful record
for such a lad. It was too bad that the captain hinted that we
have so much means, and he wouldn't have done it had he been in
his right mind; but it has produced an effect upon Sanders, as
I could see by the flash of his eyes, and the apparently indifferent
questions he asked afterwards.</p>

<p>"But we have saved our ammunition," muttered Storms, a minute
later, compressing his lips; "and I know how to use my revolver,
and it is only for a short time that I shall have to maintain
watch."</p>

<p>While Abe Storms was talking to himself in this fashion, he had
his eye on the captain, who was walking slowly toward that portion
of the island where the pearls had been concealed so carefully,
and there could be no doubt of his errand. He did not hear the
soft footstep behind him, which was so regulated that it came
up with him just as the latter paused at the all-important spot.</p>

<p>The captain first looked out to sea, and then behind him, catching
sight, as he did so, of the smiling countenance of his mate&mdash;so
far as his countenance could be seen through the wealth of beard.</p>

<p>"Hello! What are you doing here?" asked the captain, in a voice
which showed some perplexity, if not displeasure.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" asked Storms, in turn, slapping him
familiarly on the shoulder. "I suppose we came upon the same errand,
as we are so soon to leave for home. The pearls are buried here,
and we must carry them away with us."</p>

<p>"How do you know that's what I came for, Abe?"</p>

<p>"I'm only saying I suspect it's your business. I know it's mine."</p>

<p>Captain Bergen was a little bewildered by the sharp manner in
which the good-natured mate caught him up, and, while he seemed
to be debating with himself what to say, Storms took his arm and
led him a short distance off, and, seating him on the beach, said:</p>

<p>"There's no hurry about the business, Jack, for we won't start
until to-morrow morning at daylight, so as to have as few nights
on the voyage as possible, and we had better decide on the proper
course for us to take."</p>

<p>"That is correct," replied the captain, assenting so quietly
that his friend hoped he would remain easily manageable.</p>

<p>"You remember, Jack, that when we buried the pearls there, we
divided them&mdash;your half is in a strong canvas bag, so packed that
they won't rub together, or make any noise; and mine are in another
sack. The single pearl which belongs to Inez is also carefully
covered; and now we must manage to get away with them, without
letting Sanders know they are in our possession."</p>

<p>"What do you want to do that for?" demanded the captain, turning
fiercely upon the mate. "I like that fellow. He's going to put
me on a ship and send me back to Boston; and any one who does
that does me a service worth more than all the pearls in the world.
I am going to give him all mine, and I hope Inez will do the same.
I shall do my best to persuade her, and if you don't, Abe, you
and I are deadly enemies, and I'll kill you the first chance!"</p>

<p>Storms showed his shrewdness by the manner in which he managed
the poor fellow.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Jack," he replied, assuming a look and expression
of anger, as he glared upon the lunatic, well aware that he must
make him afraid of him. "If it's any fun for you to talk in that
style, I'll let you do it once, but don't you try it again. Did
I ever tell you about those sixteen persons that I killed up in
New Hampshire before we started out with the <em>Coral?</em>"</p>

<p>"No!" gasped the captain, looking at him with awe.</p>

<p>"Well, I won't tell you now," said the mate, with the same frightful
earnestness, "for it would make you feel too bad. If they hadn't
made me mad, I wouldn't have killed them, and I'll let up on you
if you do not say anything of the kind again. If you do, I'll
get mad, Jack."</p>

<p>"By the great horn spoon!" exclaimed the alarmed captain, "I'll
let the matter drop, if you will."</p>

<p>"All right," said the mate, relenting somewhat. "And, mind you,
don't you go to talking to Sanders about it. Don't you tell him
another thing, and never mention the word pearls."</p>

<p>"I won't &mdash;I won't!" was the meek rejoinder of poor Captain
Bergen, who had been completely cowed by the fierceness of his
mate.</p>

<p>"I'm an awful man when my wrath is roused!" Abe Storms thought
it best to add; "and it was just rising to the boiling-point when
you were lucky enough to take back your foolish expression."</p>

<p>"What are we going to do now?" asked the captain, apparently
anxious to turn the current of conversation into a more agreeable
channel.</p>

<p>"We'll go back and make ready to leave on the proa. We have considerable
to do before we depart. There are a number of things in the cabin
that we must carry with us."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so; I forgot that. But, Abe&mdash;don't you get mad!&mdash;what
about them?"</p>

<p>"Just never you mind," replied the mate with an important wave
of the hand. "I'll attend to them."</p>

<p>"All right. I was afraid you would forget 'em!"</p>

<p>It pained Storms to tyrannize over his superior officer in this
fashion, but stern necessity compelled him to become the real
captain. The intention of the mate when he first followed his
friend was to dig up the pearls and give him his share, but he
saw that that would never do. It would precipitate a tragedy to
allow the lunatic any option in the matter. So, without any further
reference to the pearls, the two rose to their feet and walked
slowly back in the direction of the proa, talking on no particular
subject, since the mate was desirous of diverting the mind of
the captain as much as possible.</p>

<p>The discoveries of the next few minutes did not serve to lighten
the apprehension of Storms, for when he reached the proa the two
islanders seemed to be enjoying a siesta, while neither Fred Sanders
nor Inez was in sight.</p>

<p>Suspecting what was wanted, one of the natives roused up and
pointed toward the sea, jabbering some odd words, which could
not be understood, but which Storms concluded were meant to indicate
the direction taken by the couple.</p>

<p>"That's almost the path to the spot where we were," he thought,
as he turned and walked away, holding the arm of the captain within
his own.</p>

<p>Sure enough, they had not gone far when they caught sight of
Fred and Inez sitting on the beach, just as if they were at some
fashionable seaside resort in summer time, and were chattering
no particular sense at all. Storms noticed that the place was
such as to command a view of that where he and the captain had
held their conversation, and where their precious possessions
were buried.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether that was done on purpose?" he thought. "It
may be he meant nothing, but I fear he took Inez along merely
to hide the fact that he was playing the spy upon us."</p>

<p>It was not pleasant to believe this, and yet the suspicion was
rooted pretty firmly in the mind of the mate, who, perhaps, was
becoming over-suspicious.</p>

<p>"Ah, how are you?" asked Sanders, with a laugh, changing his
lounging to the sitting position. "I conducted Miss Inez over
the proa, so as to make her acquainted with the craft, as you
may say, and since that didn't take long, we thought we would
try a little stroll down here, where we could have a talk without
those natives staring at us. How is your friend?" asked the young
man, suddenly lowering his voice to such a sympathetic key that
Storms felt guilty for the moment for ever having suspected him
capable of wrong.</p>

<p>"I'm a little uneasy about him," was the reply, as both glanced
at the captain, who sat down beside Inez and began talking to
her, "for he seems to have broken up all at once. He was such
a strong man, just in the prime of vigorous manhood, that it would
hardly be supposed he would give away so suddenly."</p>

<p>"I think he will soon recover, for the change will be so radical,
and the awakened hope so strong, that he will be sure to rally
in the course of a few days."</p>

<p>"I hope so," was the response, "but he must be watched very carefully."</p>
