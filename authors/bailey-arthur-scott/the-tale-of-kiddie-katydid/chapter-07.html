<p>As soon as Kiddie Katydid mentioned the word <u>music</u>, Freddie Firefly
began to dance and shout.
</p>
<p>"There!" he cried. "You've just the same as told me that I was right. If
you <u>sang</u> your <u>Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did</u>, you would call
it <u>singing</u>. But since you make that ditty by rubbing your wing covers
together, it is <u>music</u>. And you just referred to it as such!"
</p><p>Well, Kiddie Katydid couldn't say a single word. Freddie Firefly was
right. They both knew it. And the secret was hopelessly "out." In fact,
it was a secret no longer--unless Kiddie Katydid could persuade Freddie
Firefly to keep the news to himself.
</p><p>"You won't say anything about this little matter, I hope," Kiddie began.
</p><p>"Won't I?" said Freddie Firefly. "Why, I just couldn't help telling
people what I've learned! It's the biggest bit of news that I've known
since I've lived in Pleasant Valley. And I must get word of it to old
Mr. Crow somehow."
</p><p>"Why Mr. Crow?" Kiddie Katydid inquired anxiously. He knew that the old
gentleman was a great gossip. "You might as well put this in a newspaper
as tell Mr. Crow about it."
</p><p>"Ah! That's just the point!" cried Freddie. "Mr. Crow <u>is</u> a newspaper.
Perhaps you didn't know it; but every Saturday he flies over Blue
Mountain to the pond where Brownie Beaver lives and tells Brownie all
the news of the past week."
</p><p>"Then for pity's sake, don't let <u>him</u> hear of this!" Kiddie begged.
</p><p>But nothing could have stopped Freddie Firefly.
</p><p>"You're too modest," he said. "It's a shame to be able to make music the
way you do and not let the neighbors know it. Why, the first thing you
know you'll be one of the most famous people in this whole valley."
</p><p>"But I don't want to be!" Kiddie Katydid cried. "I'm not like you. You
go dancing about every night, flashing your light so everyone can see
you. But I stay among the trees and shrubs. And I even wear a green
suit--which matches the color of the leaves--so people won't notice me.
Of course," Kiddie added, "I don't mind if the public hears my music.
But I don't care to be seen, as a rule. And I don't like callers a
bit!"
</p><p>"You don't, eh?" remarked Freddie Firefly. "Then it's time for me to be
moving along. For I never stay where I'm not welcome." And he flitted
away, feeling somewhat peevish--and all the more determined to get the
news of the discovered secret to Mr. Crow at the earliest possible
moment.
</p><p>How he was going to do that he didn't quite know.
</p><p>There was little chance of his seeing Mr. Crow, for the old gentleman
only waked up at the time Freddie Firefly was ready to go to bed--about
dawn.
</p><p>He was pondering over his difficulty, which bothered him not a little,
when a terrific croaking from the direction of the swamp reached his
ears. It was the final chorus of the Frog family's nightly singing
party. And it promptly put an idea into Freddie Firefly's head.
</p><p>"I'll hurry right over there and speak to Mr. Frog, the well-known
tailor," he said to himself. "He knows old Mr. Crow. He sees him almost
every day. And he'll be glad to give the old gentleman a message."
