<p>The enfranchisement of the Seagrave twins proceeded too slowly
to satisfy their increasing desire for personal liberty and their
fast-growing impatience of restraint.</p>

<p>Occasionally, a few carefully selected and assorted children
were permitted to visit them in relays, and play in the nursery
for limited periods without the personal supervision of Kathleen
or the nurses; but no serious innovation was attempted, no radical
step taken without authority from old Remsen Tappan, the trust
officer of the great Half Moon Trust Company.</p>

<p>There could be no arguing with Mr. Tappan.</p>

<p>Shortly before Anthony Seagrave died he had written to his old
friend Tappan:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"If I live, I shall see to it that my grandchildren know nothing of<br/>
the fortune awaiting them until they become of age&mdash;which will be<br/>
after I am ended. Meanwhile, plain food and clothing, wholesome home<br/>
seclusion from the promiscuity of modern child life, and an<br/>
exhaustive education in every grace, fashion, and accomplishment of<br/>
body and intellect is the training I propose for the development in<br/>
them of the only thing in the world worth cultivating&mdash;unterrified<br/>
individualism.

</p>
<p>
"The ignorance which characterises the conduct of modern institutes<br/>
of education reduces us all to one mindless level, reproducing <em>ad<br/>
nauseam</em> what is known as 'average citizens.' This nation is<br/>
already crawling with them; art, religion, letters, government,<br/>
business, human ideals remain embryonic because the 'average<br/>
citizen' can conceive nothing higher, can comprehend nothing loftier<br/>
even when the few who have escaped the deadly levelling grind of<br/>
modern methods of education attempt to teach the masses to think for<br/>
themselves.

</p>
<p>
"That is bad enough in itself&mdash;but add to cut-and-dried pedagogy the<br/>
outrageous liberty which modern pupils are permitted in school and<br/>
college, and add to that the unheard-of luxury in which they<br/>
live&mdash;and the result is stupidity and utter ruin.

</p>
<p>
"My babies must have discipline, system, frugality, and leisure for<br/>
individual development drilled into them. I do not wish them to be<br/>
ignorant of one single modern grace and accomplishment; mind and<br/>
body must be trained together like a pair of Morgan colts.

</p>
<p>
"But I will not have them victims of pedagogy; I will not have them<br/>
masters of their time and money until they are of age; I will not<br/>
permit them to choose companions or pursuits for their leisure until<br/>
they are fitted to do so.

</p>
<p>
"If there is in them, latent, any propensity toward viciousness&mdash;any<br/>
unawakened desire for that which has been my failing&mdash;hard work from<br/>
dawn till dark is the antidote. An exhausted child is beyond<br/>
temptation.

</p>
<p>
"If I pass forward, Tappan, before you&mdash;and it is likely because I<br/>
am twenty years older and I have lived unwisely<br/>
&mdash;I shall arrange<br/>
matters in such shape that you can carry out something of what I<br/>
have tried to begin, far better than I, old friend; for I am strong<br/>
in theory and very weak in practice; they are such dear little<br/>
things! And when they cry to be taken up&mdash;and a modern trained<br/>
nurse says 'No! let them cry!' good God! Remsen, I sometimes sneak<br/>
into their thoroughly modern and scientifically arranged nursery,<br/>
which resembles an operating room in a brand-new hospital, and I<br/>
take up my babies and rock them in my arms, terrified lest that<br/>
modern and highly trained nurse discover my infraction of sanitary<br/>
rule and precept.

</p>
<p>
"I don't know; babies were born, and survived cradles and mothers'<br/>
arms and kisses long before sterilised milk and bacilli were<br/>
invented.

</p>
<p>
"You see I <em>am</em> weak in more ways than one. But I do mean to give<br/>
them every chance. It isn't that these old arms ache for them, that<br/>
this rather tired heart weakens when they cry for God knows what,<br/>
and modern science says let them <em>cry</em>!&mdash;it is that, deep in me,<br/>
Tappan, a heathenish idea persists that what they need more than<br/>
hygienics and scientific discipline is some of that old-fashioned<br/>
love&mdash;love which rocks them when it is not good for them&mdash;love which<br/>
overfeeds them sometimes so that they yell with old-fashioned<br/>
colic&mdash;love which ventures a bacilli-laden kiss. Friend, friend<br/>
&mdash;I<br/>
am very unfit! It will be well for them when I move on. Only try to<br/>
love them, Tappan. And if you ever doubt, kill them with indulgence,<br/>
rather than with hygiene!"

</p>
</div>
<p>He died of pneumonia a few weeks later. He had no chance. Remsen
Tappan picked up the torch from the fallen hand and, blowing it
into a brisk blaze, shuffled forward to light a path through life
for the highly sterilised twins.</p>

<p>So the Half Moon Trust became father and mother to the Seagrave
children; and Mr. Tappan as dry nurse prescribed the brand of
intellectual pap for them and decided in what manner it should
be administered.</p>

<p>Now home tuition and the "culture of the indiwidool" was a personal
hobby of Mr. Tappan, and promiscuous schools his abomination.
Had not his own son, Peter Stuyvesant Tappan, been reared upon
unsteady legs to magnificent physical and intellectual manhood
under this theory?</p>

<p>So there was to be no outside education for the youthful Seagraves;
from the nursery schoolroom no chance of escape remained. As they
grew older they became wild to go to school; stories of schoolrooms
and playgrounds and studies and teachers and jolly fellowship
and vacations, brought to them from outside by happier children,
almost crazed them with the longing for it.</p>

<p>It was hard for them when their little friends the Malletts were
sent abroad to school; Naïda, now aged twelve, to a convent, and
Duane, who was now fifteen, three years older than the Seagrave
twins, accompanied his mother and a tutor, later to enter some
school of art in Paris and develop whatever was in him. For like
all parents, Duane's had been terribly excited over his infantile
efforts at picture-making&mdash;one of the commonest and earliest developed
of talents, but which never fails to amaze and delight less gifted
parents and which continues to overstock the world with mediocre
artists.</p>

<p>So it was arranged that Colonel Mallett should spend every summer
abroad with his wife to watch the incubation of Duane's Titianesque
genius and Naïda's unbelievable talent for music; and when the
children came to bid good-bye to the Seagrave twins, they seized
each other with frantic embraces, vowing lifelong fidelity. Alas!
it is those who depart who forget first; and at the end of a year,
Geraldine's and Scott's letters remained unanswered.</p>

<p>At the age of thirteen, after an extraordinary meeting of the
directors of the Half Moon Trust Company, it was formally decided
that a series of special tutors should now be engaged to carry
on to the bitter end the Tappan-Seagrave system of home culture;
and the road to college was definitely closed.</p>

<p>"I want my views understood," said Mr. Tappan, addressing the
board of solemn-visaged directors assembled in session to determine
upon the fate of two motherless little children. "Indiwidoolism
is nurtured in excloosion; the elimination of the extraneous is
necessary for the dewelopment of indiwidoolism. I regard the human
indiwidool as sacred. Like a pearl"&mdash;he pronounced it "poil"&mdash;"it
can grow in beauty and symmetry and purity and polish only when
nourished in seclusion. Indiwidoolism is a poil without price;
and the natal mansion, gentlemen&mdash;if I may be permitted the simulcritude&mdash;is
its oyster.</p>

<p>"My old friend, Anthony Seagrave, shared with me this unalterable
conwiction. I remember in the autumn of 1859&#11834;"</p>

<p>The directors settled themselves in their wadded arm-chairs;
several yawned; some folded their hands over their ample stomachs.
The June atmosphere was pleasantly conducive to the sort of after-luncheon
introspection which is easily soothed by monotones of the human
voice.</p>

<p>And while Mr. Tappan droned on and on, some of the directors
watched him with one eye half open, thinking of other things,
and some listened, both eyes half closed, thinking of nothing
at all.</p>

<p>Many considered Mr. Tappan a very terrible old man, though why
terrible, unless the most rigid honesty and bigoted devotion to
duty terrifies, nobody seemed to know.</p>

<p>Long Island Dutch&mdash;with all that it implies&mdash;was the dull stock
he rooted in. Born a poor farmer's son, with a savage passion
for learning, he almost destroyed his eyesight in lonely study
under the flicker of tallow dips. All that had ever come to him
of knowledge came in these solitary vigils. Miry and sweating
from the plough he mastered the classics, law, chemistry, engineering;
and finally emerging heavily from the reek of Long Island fertiliser,
struck with a heavy surety at Fortune and brought her to her knees
amidst a shower of gold. And all alone he gathered it in.</p>

<p>On Coenties Slip his warehouse still bore the legend: "R. Tappan:
Iron." All that he had ever done he had done alone. He knew of
no other way; believed in no other way.</p>

<p>Plain living, plainer clothing, tireless thinking undisturbed&mdash;that
had been his childhood; and it had suited him.</p>

<p>Never but once had he made any concession to custom and nature,
and that was only when, desiring an heir, he was obliged to enter
into human partnership to realise the wish.</p>

<p>His son was what his father had made him under the iron cult
of solitary development; and now, the father, loyal in his own
way to the memory of his old friend Anthony Seagrave, meant to
do his full duty toward the orphaned grandchildren.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that tutors and specialists replaced Kathleen
in the schoolroom; and these ministered to the twin "poils," who
were now fretting through their thirteenth year, mad with desire
for boarding-school.</p>

<p>Four languages besides their own were adroitly stuffed into them;
nor were letters, arts, and sciences neglected, nor the mundane
and social patter, accomplishments, and refinements, including
poise, pose, and deportment.</p>

<p>Specialists continued to guide them indoors and out; they rode
every morning at eight with a specialist; they drove in the Park
between four and five with the most noted of four-in-hand specialists;
fencing, sparring, wrestling, swimming, gymnastics, were all supervised
by specialists in those several very important and scientific
arts; and specialists also taught them hygiene: how to walk, sit,
breathe; how to masticate; how to relax after the manner of the
domestic cat.</p>

<p>They had memory lessons; lessons in personal physiology, and
in first aid to themselves.</p>

<p>Specialists cared for their teeth, their eyes, their hair, their
skin, their hands and feet.</p>

<p>Everything that was taught them, done for them, indirectly educated
them in the science of self-consideration and deepened an unavoidably
natural belief in their own overwhelming importance. They had
not been born so.</p>

<p>But in the house of Seagrave everything revolved around and centred
in them; everything began for them and ended for them alone. They
had no chance.</p>

<p>True, they were also instructed in theology and religion; they
became well grounded in the elements of both,&mdash;laws, by-laws,
theory, legends, proverbs, truisms, and even a few abstract truths.
But there was no meaning in either to these little prisoners of
self. Seclusion is an enemy to youth; solitude its destruction.</p>

<p>When the twins were fifteen they went to their first party. A
week of superficial self-restraint and inward delirium was their
preparation, a brief hour of passive bewilderment the realisation.
Dazed by the sight and touch and clamor of the throng, they moved
and spoke as in a vision. The presence of their own kind in such
numbers confused them; overwhelmed, they found no voices to answer
the call of happiness. Their capacity to respond was too limited.</p>

<p>As in a dream they were removed earlier than anybody else&mdash;taken
away by a footman and a maid with decorous pomp and circumstance,
carefully muffled in motor robes, and embedded in a limousine.</p>

<p>The daily papers, with that lofty purpose which always characterises
them, recorded next morning the important fact that the famous
Seagrave twins had appeared at their first party.</p>

</div>
<p>Between the ages of fifteen and sixteen the twins might have
entered Harvard, for the entrance examinations were tried on both
children, and both passed brilliantly.</p>

<p>For a year or two they found a substitute for happiness in pretending
that they were really at college; they simulated, day by day,
the life that they supposed was led there; they became devoted
to their new game. Excited through tales told by tutor and friend,
they developed a passionate loyalty for their college and class;
they were solemnly elected to coveted societies, they witnessed
Harvard victories, they strove fiercely for honours; their ideals
were lofty, their courage clean and high.</p>

<p>So completely absorbed in the pretence did they become that their
own tutors ventured to suggest to Mr. Tappan that such fiercely
realistic mimicry deserved to be rewarded. Unfortunately, the
children heard of this; but the Trust Officer's short answer killed
their interest in playing at happiness, and their junior year
began listlessly and continued without ambition. There was no
heart in the pretence. Their interest had died. They studied mechanically
because they were obliged to; they no longer cared.</p>

<p>That winter they went to a few more parties&mdash;not many. However,
they were gingerly permitted to witness their first play, and
later, the same year, were taken to "Lohengrin" at the opera.</p>

<p>During the play, which was a highly moral one, they sat watching,
listening, wide-eyed as children.</p>

<p>At the opera Geraldine's impetuous soul soared straight up to
paradise with the first heavenly strains, and remained there far
above the rigid, breathless little body, bolt upright in its golden
sarcophagus of the grand tier.</p>

<p>Her physical consciousness really seemed to have fled. Until
the end she sat unaware of the throngs, of Scott and Kathleen
whispering behind her, of several tall, broad-shouldered, shy
young fellows who came into their box between the acts and tried
to discuss anything at all with her, only to find her blind, deaf,
and dumb.</p>

<p>These were the only memories of her first opera&mdash;confused, chaotic
brilliancy, paradise revealed: and long, long afterward, the carriage
flying up Fifth Avenue through darkness all gray with whirling
snow.</p>

</div>
<p>Their eighteenth year dragged, beginning in physical and intellectual
indifference, but promised stormily as they became more accustomed
to glimpses of an outside world&mdash;a world teeming with restless
young people in unbelievable quantities.</p>

<p>Scott had begun to develop two traits: laziness and a tendency
to sullen, unspoken wrath. He took more liberty than was officially
granted him&mdash;more than Geraldine dared take&mdash;and came into collision
with Kathleen more often now. He boldly overstayed his leave in
visiting his few boy friends for an afternoon; he returned home
alone on foot after dusk, telling the chauffeur to go to the devil.
Again and again he remained out to dinner without permission,
and, finally, one afternoon quietly and stealthily cut his studies,
slipped out of the house, and reappeared about dinner-time, excited,
inclined to be boisterously defiant, admitting that he had borrowed
enough money from a friend to go to a matinée with some other
boys, and that he would do it again if he chose.</p>

<p>Also, to Kathleen's horror, he swore deliberately at table when
Mr. Tappan's name was mentioned; and Geraldine looked up with
startled brown eyes, divining in her brother something new&mdash;something
that unconsciously they both had long, long waited for&mdash;the revolt
of youth ere youth had been crushed for ever from the body which
encased it.</p>

<p>"Damn him," repeated Scott, a little frightened at his own words
and attitude; "I've had enough of this baby business; I'm eighteen
and I want two things: some friends to go about with freely, and
some money to do what other boys do. And you can tell Mr. Tappan,
for all I care."</p>

<p>"What would you buy with money that is not already provided for,
Scott?" asked Kathleen, gently ignoring his excited profanity.</p>

<p>"I don't know; there is no pleasure in using things which that
fool of a Trust Company votes to let you have. Anyway, what I
want is liberty and money."</p>

<p>"What would you do with what you call liberty, dear?"</p>

<p>"Do? I'd &mdash;I'd&mdash;well, I'd go shooting if I wanted to. I'd
buy a gun and go off somewhere after ducks."</p>

<p>"But your father's old club on the Chesapeake is open to you.
Shall I ask Mr. Tappan?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes: I know," he sneered, "and Mr. Tappan would send some
chump of a tutor there to teach me. I don't want to be taught
how to hit ducks. I want to find out for myself. I don't care
for that sort of thing," he repeated savagely; "I just ache to
go off somewhere with a boy of my own age where there's no club
and no preserve and no tutor; and where I can knock about and
get whatever there is to get without anybody's help."</p>

<p>Geraldine said: "You have more liberty now than I have, Scott.
What are you howling for?"</p>

<p>"The only real liberty I have I take! Anyway, you have enough
for a girl of your age. And you'd better shut up."</p>

<p>"I won't shut up," she retorted irritably. "I want liberty as
much as you do. If I had any, I'd go to every play and opera in
New York. And I'd go about with my friends and I'd have gowns
fitted, and I'd have tea at Sherry's, and I'd shop and go to matinees
and to the Exchange, and I'd be elected a member of the Commonwealth
Club and play basket-ball there, and swim, and lunch and&mdash;and
then have another fitting&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Is that what you'd do with your liberty?" he sneered. "Well,
I don't wonder old Tappan doesn't give you any money."</p>

<p>"I do need money and decent gowns. I'm sick of the frumpy prunes-and-prisms
frocks that Kathleen makes me wear&#11834;"</p>

<p>Kathleen's troubled laugh interrupted her:</p>

<p>"Dearest, I do the best I can on the allowance made you by Mr.
Tappan. His ideas on modern feminine apparel are perhaps not yours
or mine."</p>

<p>"I should say not!" returned Geraldine angrily. "There isn't
a girl of my age who dresses as horridly as I do. I tell you,
Mr. Tappan has got to let me have money enough to dress decently.
If he doesn't, I &mdash;I'll begin to give him as much trouble
as Scott does&mdash;more, too!"</p>

<p>She set her teeth and stared at her glass of water.</p>

<p>"What about my coming-out gown?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I have written him about your début," said Kathleen soothingly.</p>

<p>"Oh! What did the old beast say?"</p>

<p>"He writes," began Kathleen pleasantly, "that he considers eighteen
an unsuitable age for a young girl to make her bow to New York
society."</p>

<p>"Did he say that?" exclaimed Geraldine, furious. "Very well;
I shall write to Colonel Mallett and tell him I simply will not
endure it any longer. I've had enough education; I'm suffocated
with it! Besides, I dislike it. I want a dinner-gown and a ball-gown
and my hair waved and dressed on top of my head instead of bunched
half way! I want to have an engagement pad &mdash;I want to have
places to go to&mdash;people expecting me; I want silk stockings and
pretty underclothes! Doesn't that old fool understand what a girl
wants and needs?"</p>

<p>She half rose from her seat at the table, pushing away the fruit
which a servant offered; and, laying her hands flat on the cloth,
leaned forward, eyes flashing ominously.</p>

<p>"I'm getting tired of this," she said. "If it goes on, I'll probably
run away."</p>

<p>"So will I," said Scott, "but I've good reasons. They haven't
done anything to you. You're making a terrible row about nothing."</p>

<p>"Yes, they have! They've suppressed me, stifled me, bottled me
up, tinkered at me, overgroomed me, dressed me ridiculously, and
stuffed my mind. And I'm starved all the time! O Kathleen, I'm
hungry! hungry! Can't you understand?</p>

<p>"They've made me into something I was not. I've never yet had
a chance to be myself. Why couldn't they let me be it? I know
&mdash;I <em>know</em> that when at last they set me free because
they have to&mdash;I &mdash;I'll act like a fool; I'll not know what
to do with my liberty &mdash;I'll not know how to use it&mdash;how
to understand or be understood.... Tell Mr. Tappan that! Tell
him that it is all silly and wrong! Tell him that a young girl
never forgets when other girls laugh at her because she never
had any money, and dresses like a frump, and wears her hair like
a baby!... And if he doesn't listen to us, some day Scott and
I will show him and the others how we feel about it! I can make
as much trouble as Scott can; I'll do it, too&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Geraldine!"</p>

<p>"Very well. I'm boiling inside when I think of&mdash;some things.
The injustice of a lot of hateful, snuffy old men deciding on
what sort of underclothes a young girl shall wear!... And I <em>will</em>
make my début! I will! I will!"</p>

<p>"Dearest&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will! I'll write to them and complain of Mr. Tappan's
stingy, unjust treatment of us both&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Let me do the writing, dear," said Kathleen quietly. And she
rose from the table and left the dining-room, both arms around
the necks of the Seagrave twins, drawing them close to her sides&mdash;closer
when her sidelong glance caught the sullen bitterness on the darkening
features of the boy, and when on the girl's fair face she saw
the flushed, wide-eyed, questioning stare.</p>

<p>When the young, seeking reasons, gaze questioningly at nothing,
it is well to divine and find the truthful answer, lest their
<em>other</em> selves, evoked, stir in darkness, counselling folly.</p>

<p>The answer to such questions Kathleen knew; who should know better
than she? But it was not for her to reply. All she could do was
to summon out of the vasty deep the powers that ruled her wards
and herself; and these, convoked in solemn assembly because of
conflict with their Trust Officer, might decide in becoming gravity
such questions as what shall be the proper quality and cost of
a young girl's corsets; and whether or not real lace and silk
are necessary for attire more intimate still.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>During the next two years the steadily increasing friction between
Remsen Tappan and his wards began seriously to disturb the directors
of the Half Moon Trust. That worthy old line company viewed with
uneasiness the revolutionary tendencies of the Seagrave twins
as expressed in periodical and passionate letters to Colonel Mallett.
The increasing frequency of these appeals for justice and for
intervention fore-shadowed the desirability of a conference. Besides,
there was a graver matter to consider, which implicated Scott.</p>

<p>When Kathleen wrote, suggesting a down-town conference to decide
delicate questions concerning Geraldine's undergarments and Scott's
new gun, Colonel Mallett found it more convenient to appoint the
Seagrave house as rendezvous.</p>

<p>And so it came to pass one pleasant Saturday afternoon in late
October that, in twos and threes, a number of solemn old gentlemen,
faultlessly attired, entered the red drawing-room of the Seagrave
house and seated themselves in an impressive semicircle upon the
damask chairs.</p>

<p>They were Colonel Stuart Mallett, president of the institution,
just returned from Paris with his entire family; Calvin McDermott,
Joshua Hogg, Carl Gumble, Friedrich Gumble; the two vice-presidents,
James Cray and Daniel Montross; Myndert Beekman, treasurer; Augustus
Varick, secretary; the Hon. John D. Ellis; Magnelius Grandcourt
2d, and Remsen Tappan, Trust Officer.</p>

<p>If the pillars of the house of Seagrave had been founded upon
millions, the damask and rosewood chairs in the red drawing-room
now groaned under the weight of millions. Power, authority, respectability,
and legitimate affluence sat there majestically enthroned in the
mansion of the late Anthony Seagrave, awaiting in serious tribunal
the appearance of the last of that old New York family.</p>

<p>Mrs. Severn came in first; the directors rose as one man, urbane,
sprightly, and gallant. She was exceedingly pretty; they recognised
it. They could afford to.</p>

<p>Compositely they were a smooth, soft-stepping, soft-voiced, company.
An exception or two, like Mr. Tappan, merely accented the composite
impression of rosy-cheeked, neatly shaven, carefully dressed prosperity.
They all were cautious of voice, moderate of speech, chary of
gesture. There was always an impressive pause before a director
of the Half Moon Trust answered even the most harmless question
addressed to him. Some among them made it a conservative rule
to swallow nothing several times before speaking at all. It was
a safe habit to acquire. <em>Aut prudens aut nullus.</em></p>

<p>Geraldine's starched skirts rustled on the stairway. When she
came into the room the directors of the Half Moon Trust were slightly
astonished. During the youth of the twins, the wives of several
gentlemen present had called at intervals to inspect the growth
of Anthony Seagrave's grandchildren, particularly those worthy
and acquisitive ladies who had children themselves. The far-sighted
reap rewards. Some day these baby twins would be old enough to
marry. It was prudent to remember such details. A position as
an old family friend might one day prove of thrifty advantage
in this miserably mercenary world where dog eats dog, and dividends
are sometimes passed. God knows and pities the sorrows of the
rich.</p>

<p>Geraldine, her slim hand in Colonel Mallett's, courtesied with
old-time quaintness, then her lifted eyes swept the rosy, rotund
countenances before her. To each she courtesied and spoke, offering
the questioning hand of amity.</p>

<p>The thing that seemed to surprise them was that she had grown
since they had seen her. Time flies when hunting safe investments.
The manners she retained, like her fashion of wearing her hair,
and the cut and length of her apparel were clearly too childish
to suit the tall, slender, prettily rounded figure&mdash;the mature
oval of the face, the delicately firm modelling of the features.</p>

<p>This was no child before them; here stood adorable adolescence,
a hint of the awakening in the velvet-brown eyes which were long
and slightly slanting at the corners; hints, too, in the vivid
lips, in the finer outline of the profile, in faint bluish shadows
under the eyes, edging the curved cheeks' bloom.</p>

<p>They had not seen her in two years or more, and she had grown
up. They had merely stepped down-town for a hasty two years' glance
at the market, and, behind their backs, the child had turned into
a woman.</p>

<p>Hitherto they had addressed her as "Geraldine" and "child," when
a rare interview had been considered necessary. Now, two years
later, unconsciously, it was "Miss Seagrave," and considerable
embarrassment when the subject of intimate attire could no longer
be avoided.</p>

<p>But Geraldine, unconscious of such things, broached the question
with all the directness characteristic of her.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I was rude in my last letter," she said gravely,
turning to Mr. Tappan. "Will you please forgive me?... I am glad
you came. I do not think you understand that I am no longer a
little girl, and that things necessary for a woman are necessary
for me. I want a quarterly allowance. I need what a young woman
needs. Will you give these things to me, Mr. Tappan?"</p>

<p>Mr. Tappan's dry lips cracked apart; he swallowed grimly several
times, then his long bony fingers sought the meagre ends of his
black string tie:</p>

<p>"In the cultiwation of the indiwidool," he began harshly, and
checked himself, when Geraldine flushed to her ear tips and stamped
her foot. Self-control had gone at last.</p>

<p>"I won't listen to that!" she said, breathless; "I've listened
to it for ten years&mdash;as long as I can remember. Answer me honestly,
Mr. Tappan! Can I have what other women have&mdash;silk underwear and
stockings&mdash;real lace on my night dresses&mdash;and plenty of it? Can
I have suitable gowns and furs, and have my hair dressed properly?
I want you to answer; can I make my début this winter and have
the gowns I require&mdash;and the liberty that girls of my age have?"
She turned on Colonel Mallett: "The liberty that Naïda has had
is all I want; the sort of things you let her have all I ask for."
And appealing to Magnelius Grandcourt, who stood pursing his thick
lips, puffed out like a surprised pouter pigeon: "Your daughter
Catherine has more than I ask; why do you let her have what you
consider bad for me? <em>Why</em>?"</p>

<p>Mr. Grandcourt swallowed several times, and spoke in an undertone
to Joshua Hogg. But he did not reply to Geraldine.</p>

<p>Remsen Tappan turned his iron visage toward Colonel Mallett&mdash;ignoring
Geraldine's questions.</p>

<p>"In the cultiwation of the indiwidool," he began again dauntlessly&#11834;</p>

<p>"Isn't there anybody to answer me?" asked Geraldine, turning
from one to another.</p>

<p>"Concerning the cultiwation&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Answer me!" she flashed back. There were tears in her voice,
but her eyes blazed.</p>

<p>"Miss Seagrave," interposed old Mr. Montross gravely, "I beg
of you to remember&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Let him answer me first! I asked him a perfectly plain question.
It&mdash;it is silly to ignore me as though I were a foolish child&mdash;as
though I didn't know my mind."</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Tappan, perhaps if you could give Miss Seagrave
a qualified answer to her questions&mdash;make some preliminary statement&mdash;"
began Mr. Cray cautiously.</p>

<p>"Concerning what?" snapped Tappan with a grim stare.</p>

<p>"Concerning my stockings and my underwear," said Geraldine fiercely.
"I'm tired of dressing like a servant!"</p>

<p>Mr. Tappan's rugged jaw opened and shut with another snap.</p>

<p>"I'm opposed to any such innowation," he said.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;my coming out this winter? And my quarterly allowance?
Answer me!"</p>

<p>"Time enough when you turn twenty-one, Miss Seagrave. Cultiwation
of mind concerns you now, not cultiwation of raiment."</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that&mdash;" stammered Geraldine, "is s-su-premely s-silly."
The tears reached her eyes; she brushed them away angrily.</p>

<p>Mallett coughed and glanced at Myndert Beekman, then past the
secretary, Mr. Varick, directly at Mr. Tappan.</p>

<p>"If you could see your way to&mdash;ah&mdash;accede to some&mdash;a number&mdash;perhaps,
in a measure, to all of Miss Seagrave's not unreasonable requests,
Mr. Tappan&#11834;"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Can I have what other women have&mdash;silk underwear
and stockings?'"]</p>

<p>He hesitated, looked dubiously at Mr. Montross, who nodded. Mr.
Cray, also, made an almost imperceptible sign of concurrence.
Magnelius Grandcourt, the sixty-year <em>enfant terrible</em>
of the company, dreaded for his impulsive outbursts&mdash;though the
effect of these outbursts was always very carefully considered
before-hand&mdash;stepped jauntily across the floor, and lifting Geraldine's
hand to his rather purplish lips, saluted it with a flourish.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Tappan, let Miss Seagrave have what she wants!" he
exclaimed with a hearty disregard of caution, which outwardly
disturbed but inwardly deceived nobody except Geraldine and Mrs.
Severn.</p>

<p>Colonel Mallett thought: "The acquisitive beast is striking attitudes
on his fool of a son's account."</p>

<p>Mr. Tappan's small iron-gray eyes bored two holes through the
inward motives of Mr. Grandcourt, and his mouth tightened till
the seamed lips were merely a line.</p>

<p>"I think, Magnelius," said Colonel Mallett coldly, "that it is,
perhaps, the sense of our committee that the time has practically
arrived for some change&mdash;perhaps radical change&mdash;in the&mdash;in the&mdash;ah&mdash;the
hitherto exceedingly wise regulations&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>May</em> I have real lace?" cried Geraldine&mdash;"Oh, I <em>beg</em>
your pardon, Colonel Mallett, for interrupting, but I was perfectly
crazy to know what you were going to say."</p>

<p>Other people have been crazier and endured more to learn what
hope the verdict of ponderous authority might hold for them.</p>

<p>Colonel Mallett, a trifle ruffled at the interruption, swallowed
several times and then continued without haste to rid himself
of a weighty opinion concerning the début and the petticoats of
the Half Moon's ward. He might have made the child happy in one
word. It took him twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Concurring opinions were then solemnly delivered by every director
in turn except Mr. Tappan, who spoke for half an hour, doggedly
dissenting on every point.</p>

<p>But the days of the old régime were evidently numbered. He understood
it. He looked across at the crackled portrait of his old friend
Anthony Seagrave; the faded, painted features were obliterated
in a bar of slanting sunlight.</p>

<p>So, concluding his dissenting opinion, and having done his duty,
he sat down, drawing the skirts of his frock-coat close around
his bony thighs. He had done his best; his reward was this child's
hatred&mdash;which she already forgot in the confused delight of her
sudden liberation.</p>

<p>Dazed with happiness, to one after another Geraldine courtesied
and extended the narrow childlike hand of amity&mdash;even to him.
Then, as though treading on invisible pink clouds, she floated
out and away up-stairs, scarcely conscious of passing her brother
on the stairway, who was now descending for his turn before the
altar of authority.</p>

<p>When Scott returned he appeared to be unusually red in the face.
Geraldine seized him ecstatically:</p>

<p>"Oh, Scott! I <em>am</em> to come out, after all&mdash;and I'm to
have my quarterly, and gowns, and everything. I could have hugged
Mr. Grandcourt&mdash;the dear! I was so frightened&mdash;frightened into
rudeness&mdash;and then that beast of a Tappan scared me terribly.
But it is all right now&mdash;and <em>what</em> did they promise you,
poor dear?"</p>

<p>Scott's face still remained flushed as he stood, hands in his
pockets, head slightly bent, tracing with the toe of his shoe
the carpet pattern.</p>

<p>"You want to know what they promised me?" he asked, looking up
at his sister with an unpleasant laugh. She poured a few drops
of cologne onto a lump of sugar, placed it between her lips, and
nodded:</p>

<p>"They <em>did</em> promise you something&mdash;didn't they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly. They promised to make it hot for me if I ever
again borrowed money on notes."</p>

<p>"Scott! did you do that?"</p>

<p>"Give my note? Certainly. I needed money &mdash;I've told old
tabby Tappan so again and again. In a year I'll have all the money
I need&mdash;so what's the harm if I borrow a little and promise to
pay when I'm of age?"</p>

<p>Geraldine considered a moment: "It's curious," she reflected,
"but do you know, Scott, I never thought of doing that. It never
occurred to me to do it! Why didn't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Because," said her brother with an embarrassed laugh, "it's
not exactly a proper thing to do, I believe. Anyway, they raised
a terrible row about it. Probably that's why they have at last
given me a decent quarterly allowance; they think it's safer,
I suppose&mdash;and they're right. The stingy old fossils."</p>

<p>The boyish boast, the veiled hint of revolt and reprisal vaguely
disturbed Geraldine's sense of justice.</p>

<p>"After all," she said, "they have meant to be kind. They didn't
know how, that's all. And, Scott, do let us try to be better now.
I'm ashamed of my rudeness to them. And I'm going to be very,
very good to Kathleen and not do one single thing to make her
unhappy or even to bother Mr. Tappan.... And, oh, Scott! my silks
and laces! my darling clothes! All is coming true! Do you hear?
And, Scott! Naïda and Duane are back and I'm dying to see them.
Duane is twenty-three, think of it!"</p>

<p>She seized him and spun him around.</p>

<p>"If you don't hug me and tell me you're fond of me, I shall go
mad. Tell me you're fond of me, Scott! You do love me, don't you?"</p>

<p>He kissed his sister with preoccupied toleration: "Whew!" he
said, "your breath reeks of cologne!</p>

<p>"As for me," he added, half sullenly, "I'm going to have a few
things I want, now.... And do a few things, too."</p>

<p>But what these things were he did not specify. Nor did Geraldine
have time to speculate, so occupied was she now with preparations
for the wonderful winter which was to come true at last&mdash;which
was already beginning to come true with exciting visits to that
magic country of brilliant show-windows which, like an enchanted
city by itself, sparkles from Madison Square to the Plaza between
Fourth Avenue and Broadway.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Into this sparkling metropolitan zone she hastened with Kathleen;
all day long, week after week, she flitted from shop to shop,
never satisfied, always eager to see, to explore. Yet two things
Kathleen noticed: Geraldine seemed perfectly happy and contented
to view the glitter of vanity fair without thought of acquiring
its treasures for herself; and, when reminded that she was there
to buy, she appeared to be utterly ignorant of the value of money,
though a childhood without it was supposed to have taught her
its rarity and preciousness.</p>

<p>The girl's personal tastes were expensive; she could linger in
ecstasy all the morning over piles of wonderful furs without envy,
without even thinking of them for herself; but when Kathleen mentioned
the reason of their shopping, Geraldine always indicated sables
as her choice, any single piece of which would have required half
her yearly allowance to pay for.</p>

<p>And she was for ever wishing to present things to Kathleen; silks
that were chosen, model gowns that they examined together, laces,
velvets, jewels, always her first thought seemed to be that Kathleen
should have what they both enjoyed looking at so ardently; and
many a laughing contest they had as to whether her first quarterly
allowance should be spent upon herself or her friends.</p>

<p>On the surface it would appear that unselfishness was the key
to her character. That was impossible; she had lived too long
alone. Yet Geraldine was clearly not acquisitive; though, when
she did buy, her careless extravagance worried Kathleen. Spendthrift&mdash;in
that she cared nothing for the money value of anything&mdash;her bright,
piquant, eager face was a welcome sight to the thrifty metropolitan
shopkeeper at Christmas-tide. A delicate madness for giving obsessed
her; she bought a pair of guns for Scott, laces and silks for
Kathleen, and for the servants everything she could think of.
Nobody was forgotten, not even Mr. Tappan, who awoke Christmas
morning to gaze grimly upon an antique jewelled fob all dangling
with pencils and seals. In the first flush of independence it
gave her more pleasure to give than to acquire.</p>

<p>Also, for the first time in her life, she superintended the distribution
of her own charities, flying in the motor with Kathleen from church
to mission, eager, curious, pitiful, appalled, by turns. Sentiment
overwhelmed her; it was a new kind of pleasure.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>One night she arose shivering from her warm bed, and with ink
and paper sat figuring till nearly dawn how best to distribute
what fortune she might one day possess, and live an exalted life
on ten dollars a week.</p>

<p>Kathleen found her there asleep, head buried in the scattered
papers, limbs icy to the knees; and there ensued an interim of
bronchitis which threatened at one time to postpone her début.</p>

<p>But the medical profession of Manhattan came to the rescue in
battalions, and Geraldine was soon afoot, once more drifting ecstatically
among the splendours of the shops, thrilling with the nearness
of the day that should set her free among unnumbered hosts of
unknown friends.</p>

<p>Who would these unknown people turn out to be? What hearts were
at that very moment destined to respond in friendship to her own?</p>

<p>Often lying awake, nibbling her scented lump of sugar, the darkness
reddening, at intervals, as embers of her bedroom fire dropped
glowing to the hearth, she pictured to herself this vast, brilliant
throng awaiting to welcome her as one of them. And her imagination
catching fire, through closed lids she seemed to see heavenly
vistas of youthful faces&mdash;a thousand arms outstretched in welcome;
and she, advancing, eyes dim with happiness, giving herself to
this world of youth and friendship&mdash;crossing the threshold&mdash;leaving
for ever behind her the past with its loneliness and isolation.</p>

<p>It was of friendships she dreamed, and the blessed nearness of
others, and the liberty to seek them. She promised herself she
would never, never again permit herself to be alone. She had no
definite plans, except that. Life henceforth must be filled with
the bright shapes of comrades. Life must be only pleasure. Never
again must sadness come near her. A miraculous capacity for happiness
seemed to fill her breast, expanding with the fierce desire for
it, until under the closed lids tears stole out, and there, in
the darkness, she held out her bare arms to the world&mdash;the kind,
good, generous, warm-hearted world, which was waiting, just beyond
her threshold, to welcome her and love her and companion her for
ever.</p>
