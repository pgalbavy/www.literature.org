<p>The brethren and Rosamund looked at each other, for having so
much to say it seemed that they could not speak at all. Then with
a low cry Rosamund said:
</p>
<p>"Oh! let us thank God, Who, after all these black months of
travel and of danger, has thus brought us together again," and,
kneeling down there together in the guest-hall of the lord of
Death, they gave thanks earnestly. Then, moving to the centre of
the chamber where they thought that none would hear them, they
began to speak in low voices and in English.
</p><p>"Tell you your tale first, Rosamund," said Godwin.
</p><p>She told it as shortly as she could, they listening without a
word.
</p><p>Then Godwin spoke and told her theirs. Rosamund heard it, and
asked a question almost in a whisper.
</p><p>"Why does that beautiful dark-eyed woman befriend you?"
</p><p>"I do not know," answered Godwin, "unless it is because of the
accident of my having saved her from the lion."
</p><p>Rosamund looked at him and smiled a little, and Wulf smiled also.
Then she said:
</p><p>"Blessings be on that lion and all its tribe! I pray that she may
not soon forget the deed, for it seems that our lives hang upon
her favour. How strange is this story, and how desperate our
case! How strange also that you should have come on hither
against her counsel, which, seeing what we have, I think was
honest?"
</p><p>"We were led," answered Godwin. "Your father had wisdom at his
death, and saw what we could not see."
</p><p>"Ay," added Wulf, "but I would that it had been into some other
place, for I fear this lord Al-je-bal at whose nod men hurl
themselves to death."
</p><p>"He is hateful," answered Rosamund, with a shudder; "worse even
than the knight Lozelle; and when he fixes his eyes on me, my
heart grows sick. Oh! that we could escape this place!"
</p><p>"An eel in an osier trap has more chance of freedom," said Wulf
gloomily. "Let us at least be thankful that we are caged
together--for how long, I wonder?"
</p><p>As he spoke Masouda appeared, attended by waiting women, and,
bowing to Rosamund, said:
</p><p>"It is the will of the Master, lady, that I lead you to the
chambers that have been made ready for you, there to rest until
the hour of the feast. Fear not; you shall meet your brethren
then. You knights have leave, if it so pleases you, to exercise
your horses in the gardens. They stand saddled in the courtyard,
to which this woman will bring you," and she pointed to one of
those two maids who had cleaned the armour, "and with them are
guides and an escort."
</p><p>"She means that we must go," muttered Godwin, adding aloud,
"farewell, sister, until tonight."
</p><p>So they parted, unwillingly enough. In the courtyard they found
the horses, Flame and Smoke, as they had been told, also a
mounted escort of four fierce-looking fedais and an officer. When
they were in the saddle, this man, motioning to them to follow
him, passed by an archway out of the courtyard into the gardens.
Hence ran a broad road strewn with sand, along which he began to
gallop. This road followed the gulf which encircled the citadel
and inner town of Masyaf, that was, as it were, an island on a
mountain top with a circumference of over three miles.
</p><p>As they went, the gulf always on their right hand, holding in
their horses to prevent their passing that of their guide, swift
as it was, they saw another troop approaching them. This was also
preceded by an officer of the Assassins, as these servants of
Al-je-bal were called by the Franks, and behind him, mounted on a
splendid coalblack steed and followed by guards, rode a mail-clad
Frankish knight.
</p><p>"It is Lozelle," said Wulf, "upon the horse that Sinan promised
him."
</p><p>At the sight of the man a fury took hold of Godwin. With a shout
of warning he drew his sword. Lozelle saw, and out leapt his
blade in answer. Then sweeping past the officers who were with
them and reining up their steeds, in a second they were face to
face. Lozelle struck first and Godwin caught the stroke upon his
buckler, but before he could return it the fedais of either party
rushed between them and thrust them asunder.
</p><p>"A pity," said Godwin, as they dragged his horse away. "Had they
left us alone I think, brother, I might have saved you a
moonlight duel."
</p><p>"That I do not want to miss, but the chance at his head was good
if those fellows would have let you take it," answered Wulf
reflectively.
</p><p>Then the horses began to gallop again, and they saw no more of
Lozelle. Now, skirting the edge of the town, they came to the
narrow, wall-less bridge that spanned the gulf between it and the
outer gate and city. Here the officer wheeled his horse, and,
beckoning to them to follow, charged it at full gallop. After him
went the brethren--Godwin first, then Wulf. In the deep gateway
on the further side they reined up. The captain turned, and began
to gallop back faster than he had come--as fast, indeed, as his
good beast would travel.
</p><p>"Pass him!" cried Godwin, and shaking the reins loose upon the
neck of Flame he called to it aloud.
</p><p>Forward it sprang, with Smoke at its heels. Now they had
overtaken the captain, and now even on that narrow way they had
swept past him. Not an inch was there to spare between them and
the abyss, and the man, brave as he was, expecting to be thrust
to death, clung to his horse's mane with terror in his eyes. On
the city side the brethren pulled up laughing among the
astonished fedais who had waited for them there.
</p><p>"By the Signet," cried the officer, thinking that the knights
could not understand, "these are not men; they are devils, and
their horses are goats of the mountains. I thought to frighten
them, but it is I who was frightened, for they swept past me like
eagles of the air."
</p><p>"Gallant riders and swift, well-trained steeds," answered one of
the fedais, with admiration in his voice. "The fight at the full
moon will be worth our seeing."
</p><p>Then once more they took the sand-strewn road and galloped on.
Thrice they passed round the city thus, the last time by
themselves, for the captain and the fedais were far outstripped.
Indeed it was not until they had unsaddled Flame and Smoke in
their stalls that these appeared, spurring their foaming horses.
Taking no heed of them, the brethren thrust aside the grooms,
dressed their steeds down, fed and watered them.
</p><p>Then having seen them eat, there being no more to do, they walked
back to the guest-house, hoping to find Rosamund. But they found
no Rosamund, so sat down together and talked of the wonderful
things that had befallen them, and of what might befall them in
the future; of the mercy of Heaven also which had brought them
all three together safe and sound, although it was in this house
of hell. So the time passed on, till about the hour of sunset the
women servants came and led them to the bath, where the black
slaves washed and perfumed them, clothing them in fresh robes
above their armour.
</p><p>When they came out the sun was down, and the women, bearing
torches in their hands, conducted them to a great and gorgeous
hall which they had not seen before, built of fretted stone and
having a carved and painted roof. Along one side of this hall,
that was lit with cressets, were a number of round-headed open
arches supported by elegant white columns, and beyond these a
marble terrace with flights of steps which led to the gardens
beneath. On the floor of this hall, each seated upon his cushion
beside low tables inlaid with pearl sat the guests, a hundred or
more, all dressed in white robes on which the red dagger was
blazoned, and all as silent as though they were asleep.
</p><p>When the brethren reached the place the women left them, and
servants with gold chains round their necks escorted them to a
dais in the middle of the hall where were many cushions, as yet
unoccupied, arranged in a semicircle, of which the centre was a
divan higher and more gorgeous than the rest.
</p><p>Here places were pointed out to them opposite the divan, and they
took their stand by them. They had not long to wait, for
presently there was a sound of music, and, heralded by troops of
singing women, the lord Sinan approached, walking slowly down the
length of the great hall. It was a strange procession, for after
the women came the aged, white robed dais, then the lord
Al-je-bal himself, clad now in his blood-red, festal robe, and
wearing jewels on his turban.
</p><p>Around him marched four slaves, black as ebony, each of whom held
a flaming torch on high, while behind followed the two gigantic
guards who had stood sentry over him when he sat under the canopy
of justice. As he advanced down the hall every man in it rose
and prostrated himself, and so remained until their lord was
seated, save only the two brethren, who stood erect like the
survivors among the slain of a battle. Settling himself among the
cushions at one end of the divan, he waved his hand, whereon the
feasters, and with them Godwin and Wulf, sat themselves down.
</p><p>Now there was a pause, while Sinan glanced along the hall
impatiently. Soon the brethren saw why, since at the end opposite
to that by which he had entered appeared more singing women, and
after them, also escorted by four black torch-bearers, only these
were women, walked Rosamund and, behind her, Masouda.
</p><p>Rosamund it was without doubt, but Rosamund transformed, for now
she seemed an Eastern queen. Round her head was a coronet of gems
from which hung a veil, but not so as to hide her face. Jewelled,
too, were her heavy plaits of hair, jewelled the rose-silk
garments that she wore, the girdle at her waist, her naked, ivory
arms and even the slippers on her feet. As she approached in her
royal-looking beauty all the guests at that strange feast stared
first at her and next at each other. Then as though by a single
impulse they rose and bowed.
</p><p>"What can this mean?" muttered Wulf to Godwin as they did
likewise. But Godwin made no answer.
</p><p>On came Rosamund, and now, behold! the lord Al-je-bal rose also
and, giving her his hand, seated her by him on the divan.
</p><p>"Show no surprise, Wulf," muttered Godwin, who had caught a
warning look in the eyes of Masouda as she took up her position
behind Rosamund.
</p><p>Now the feast began. Slaves running to and fro, set dish after
dish filled with strange and savoury meats, upon the little
inlaid tables, those that were served to Sinan and his guests
fashioned, all of them, of silver or of gold.
</p><p>Godwin and Wulf ate, though not for hunger's sake, but of what
they ate they remembered nothing who were watching Sinan and
straining their ears to catch all he said without seeming to take
note or listen. Although she strove to hide it and to appear
indifferent, it was plain to them that Rosamund was much afraid.
Again and again Sinan presented to her choice morsels of food,
sometimes on the dishes and sometimes with his fingers, and these
she was obliged to take. All the while also he devoured her with
his fierce eyes so that she shrank away from him to the furthest
limit of the divan.
</p><p>Then wine, perfumed and spiced, was brought in golden cups, of
which, having drunk, he offered to Rosamund. But she shook her
head and asked Masouda for water, saying that she touched nothing
stronger, and it was given her, cooled with snow. The brethren
asked for water also, whereon Sinan looked at them suspiciously
and demanded the reason. Godwin replied through Masouda that they
were under an oath to touch no wine till they returned to their
own country, having fulfilled their mission. To this he answered
meaningly that it was good and right to keep oaths, but he feared
that theirs would make them water-drinkers for the rest of their
lives, a saying at which their hearts sank.
</p><p>Now the wine that he had drunk took hold of Sinan, and he began
to talk who without it was so silent.
</p><p>"You met the Frank Lozelle to-day," he said to Godwin, through
Masouda, "when riding in my gardens, and drew your sword on him.
Why did you not kill him? Is he the better man?"
</p><p>"It seems not, as once before I worsted him and I sit here
unhurt, lord," answered Godwin. "Your servants thrust between and
separated us."
</p><p>"Ay," replied Sinan, "I remember; they had orders. Still, I would
that you had killed him, the unbelieving dog, who has dared to
lift his eyes to this Rose of Roses, your sister. Fear not," he
went on, addressing Rosamund, "he shall offer you no more insult,
who are henceforth under the protection of the Signet," and
stretching out his thin, cruel-looking hand, on which gleamed the
ring of power, he patted her on the arm.
</p><p>All of these things Masouda translated, while Rosamund dropped
her head to hide her face, though on it were not the blushes that
he thought, but loathing and alarm.
</p><p>Wulf glared at the Al-je-bal, whose head by good fortune was
turned away, and so fierce was the rage swelling in his heart
that a mist seemed to gather before his eyes, and through it this
devilish chief of a people of murderers, clothed in his robe of
flaming red, looked like a man steeped in blood. The thought came
to him suddenly that he would make him what he looked, and his
hand passed to his sword-hilt. But Godwin saw the terror in
Masouda's eyes, saw Wulf's hand also, and guessed what was about
to chance. With a swift movement of his arm he struck a golden
dish from the table to the marble floor, then said, in a clear
voice in French:
</p><p>"Brother, be not so awkward; pick up that dish and answer the
lord Sinan as is your right--I mean, touching the matter of
Lozelle."
</p><p>Wulf stooped to obey, and his mind cleared which had been so near
to madness.
</p><p>"I wish it not, lord," he said, "who, if I can, have your good
leave to slay this fellow on the third night from now. If I fail,
then let my brother take my place, but not before."
</p><p>"Yes, I forgot," said Sinan. "So I decreed, and that will be a
fight I wish to see. If he kills you then your brother shall meet
him. And if he kills you both, then perhaps I, Sinan, will meet
him--in my own fashion. Sweet lady, knowing where the course is
laid, say, do you fear to see this fray?"
</p><p>Rosamund's face paled, but she answered proudly:
</p><p>"Why should I fear what my brethren do not fear? They are brave
knights, bred to arms, and God, in Whose hand are all our
destinies--even yours, O Lord of Death--He will guard the
right."
</p><p>When this speech was translated to him Sinan quailed a little.
Then he answered:
</p><p>"Lady, know that I am the Voice and Prophet of Allah--ay, and his
sword to punish evil-doers and those who do not believe. Well, if
what I hear is true, your brethren are skilled horsemen who even
dared to pass my servant on the narrow bridge, so victory may
rest with them. Tell me which of them do you love the least, for
he shall first face the sword of Lozelle."
</p><p>Now as Rosamund prepared herself to answer Masouda scanned her
face through her half-closed eyes. But whatever she may have felt
within, it remained calm and cold as though it were cut in stone.
</p><p>"To me they are as one man," she said. "When one speaks, both
speak. I love them equally."
</p><p>"Then, Guest of my heart, it shall go as I have said. Brother
Blue-eyes shall fight first, and if he falls then Brother
Grey-eyes. The feast is ended, and it is my hour for prayer.
Slaves, bid the people fill their cups. Lady, I pray of you,
stand forward on the dais."
</p><p>She obeyed, and at a sign the black slave-women gathered behind
her with their flaming torches. Then Sinan rose also, and cried
with a loud voice:
</p><p>"Servants of Al-je-bal, pledge, I command you, this Flower of
flowers, the high-born Princess of Baalbec, the niece of the
Sultan, Salah-ed-din, whom men call the Great," and he sneered,
"though he be not so great as I, this Queen of maids who soon--"
Then, checking himself, he drank off his wine, and with a low bow
presented the empty, jewelled cup to Rosamund. All the company
drank also, and shouted till the hall rang, for her loveliness as
she stood thus in the fierce light of the torches, aflame as
these men were with the vision-breeding wine of Al-je-bal, moved
them to madness.
</p><p>"Queen! Queen!" they shouted. "Queen of our Master and of us
all!"
</p><p>Sinan heard and smiled. Then, motioning for silence, he took the
hand of Rosamund, kissed it, and turning, passed from the hall
preceded by his singing women and surrounded by the dais and
guards.
</p><p>Godwin and Wulf stepped forward to speak with Rosamund, but
Masouda interposed herself between them, saying in a cold, clear
voice:
</p><p>"It is not permitted. Go, knights, and cool your brows in yonder
garden, where sweet water runs. Your sister is my charge. Fear
not, for she is guarded."
</p><p>"Come," said Godwin to Wulf; "we had best obey."
</p><p>So together they walked through the crowd of those feasters that
remained, for most of them had already left the hall, who made
way, not without reverence, for the brethren of this new star of
beauty, on to the terrace, and from the terrace into the gardens.
Here they stood awhile in the sweet freshness of the night, which
was very grateful after the heated, perfume-laden air of the
banquet; then began to wander up and down among the scented trees
and flowers. The moon, floating in a cloudless sky, was almost at
its full, and by her light they saw a wondrous scene. Under many
of the trees and in tents set about here and there, rugs were
spread, and to them came men who had drunk of the wine of the
feast, and cast themselves down to sleep.
</p><p>"Are they drunk?" asked Wulf.
</p><p>"It would seem so," answered Godwin.
</p><p>Yet these men appeared to be mad rather than drunk, for they
walked steadily enough, but with wide-set, dreamy eyes; nor did
they seem to sleep upon the rugs, but lay there staring at the
sky and muttering with their lips, their faces steeped in a
strange, unholy rapture. Sometimes they would rise and walk a few
paces with outstretched arms, till the arms closed as though they
clasped something invisible, to which they bent their heads to
babble awhile. Then they walked back to their rugs again, where
they remained silent.
</p><p>As they lay thus, white-veiled women appeared, who crouched by
the heads of these sleepers, murmuring into their ears, and when
from time to time they sat up, gave them to drink from cups they
carried, after partaking of which they lay down again and became
quite senseless.
</p><p>Only the women would move on to others and serve them likewise.
Some of them approached the brethren with a slow, gliding motion,
and offered them the cup; but they walked forward, taking no
notice, whereupon the girls left them, laughing softly, and
saying such things as "Tomorrow we shall meet," or "Soon you will
be glad to drink and enter into Paradise."
</p><p>"When the time comes doubtless we shall be glad, who have dwelt
here," answered Godwin gravely, but as he spoke in French they
did not understand him.
</p><p>"Step out, brother," said Wulf, "for at the very sight of those
rugs I grow sleepy, and the wine in the cups sparkles as bright
as their bearers' eyes."
</p><p>So they walked on towards the sound of a waterfall, and, when
they came to it, drank, and bathed their faces and heads.
</p><p>"This is better than their wine," said Wulf. Then, catching sight
of more women flitting round them, looking like ghosts amid the
moonlit glades, they pressed forward till they reached an open
sward where there were no rugs, no sleepers, and no cupbearers.
</p><p>"Now," said Wulf, halting, "tell me what does all this mean?"
</p><p>"Are you deaf and blind?" asked Godwin. "Cannot you see that
yonder fiend is in love with Rosamund, and means to take her, as
he well may do?"
</p><p>Wulf groaned aloud, then answered: "I swear that first I will
send his soul to hell, even though our own must keep it
company."
</p><p>"Ay," answered Godwin, "I saw; you went near to it tonight. But
remember, that is the end for all of us. Let us wait then to
strike until we must--to save her from worse things."
</p><p>"Who knows that we may find another chance? Meanwhile,
meanwhile--" and again he groaned.
</p><p>"Among those ornaments that hung about the waist of Rosamund I
saw a jewelled knife," answered Godwin, sadly. "She can be
trusted to use it if need be, and after that we can be trusted to
do our worst. At least, I think that we should die in a fashion
that would be remembered in this mountain."
</p><p>As they spoke they had loitered towards the edge of the glade,
and halting there stood silent, till presently from under the
shadow of a cedar tree appeared a solitary, white robed woman.
</p><p>"Let us be going," said Wulf; "here is another of them with her
accursed cup."
</p><p>But before they could turn the woman glided up to them and
suddenly unveiled. It was Masouda.
</p><p>"Follow me, brothers Peter and John," she said in a laughing
whisper. "I have words to say to you. What! you will not drink?
Well, it is wisest." And emptying the cup upon the ground she
flitted ahead of them.
</p><p>Silently as a wraith she went, now appearing in the open spaces,
now vanishing, beneath the dense gloom of cedar boughs, till she
reached a naked, lonely rock which stood almost upon the edge of
the gulf. Opposite to this rock was a great mound such as ancient
peoples reared over the bodies of their dead, and in the mound,
cunningly hidden by growing shrubs, a massive door.
</p><p>Masouda took a key from her girdle, and, having looked around to
see that they were alone, unlocked it.
</p><p>"Enter," she said, pushing them before her. They obeyed, and
through the darkness within heard her close the door.
</p><p>"Now we are safe awhile," she said with a sigh, "or, at least, so
I think. But I will lead you to where there is more light."
</p><p>Then, taking each of them by the hand, she went forward along a
smooth incline, till presently they saw the moonlight, and by it
discovered that they stood at the mouth of a cave which was
fringed with bushes. Running up from the depths of the gulf
below to this opening was a ridge or shoulder of rock, very steep
and narrow.
</p><p>"See the only road that leads from the citadel of Masyaf save
that across the bridge," said Masouda.
</p><p>"A bad one," answered Wulf, staring downward.
</p><p>"Ay, yet horses trained to rocks can follow it. At its foot is
the bottom of the gulf, and a mile or more away to the left a
deep cleft which leads to the top of the mountain and to freedom.
Will you not take it now? By tomorrow's dawn you might be far
away."
</p><p>"And where would the lady Rosamund be?" asked Wulf.
</p><p>"In the harem of the lord Sinan--that is, very soon," she
answered, coolly.
</p><p>"Oh, say it not!" he exclaimed, clasping her arm, while Godwin
leaned back against the wall of the cave.
</p><p>"Why should I hide the truth? Have you no eyes to see that he is
enamoured of her loveliness--like others? Listen; a while ago my
master Sinan chanced to lose his queen--how, we need not ask, but
it is said that she wearied him. Now, as he must by law, he
mourns for her a month, from full moon to full moon. But on the
day after the full moon--that is, the third morning from now--he
may wed again, and I think there will be a marriage. Till then,
however, your sister is as safe as though she yet sat at home in
England before Salah-ed-din dreamed his dream."
</p><p>"Therefore," said Godwin, "within that time she must either
escape or die."
</p><p>"There is a third way," answered Masouda, shrugging her
shoulders. "She might stay and become the wife of Sinan."
</p><p>Wulf muttered something between his teeth, then stepped towards
her threateningly, saying:
</p><p>"Rescue her, or--"
</p><p>"Stand back, pilgrim John," she said, with a laugh. "If I rescue
her, which indeed would be hard, it will not be for fear of your
great sword."
</p><p>"What, then, will avail, Masouda?" asked Godwin in a sad voice.
"To promise you money would be useless, even if we could."
</p><p>"I am glad that you spared me that insult," she replied with
flashing eyes, "for then there had been an end. Yet," she added
more humbly, "seeing my home and business, and what I appear to
be," and she glanced at her dress and the empty cup in her hand,
"it had not been strange. Now hear me, and forget no word. At
present you are in favour with Sinan, who believes you to be the
brothers of the lady Rosamund, not her lovers; but from the
moment he learns the truth your doom is sealed. Now what the
Frank Lozelle knows, that the Al-je-bal may know at any time--and
will know, if these should meet.
</p><p>"Meanwhile, you are free; so to-morrow, while you ride about the
garden, as you will do, take note of the tall rock that stands
without, and how to reach it from any point, even in the dark.
To-morrow, also, when the moon is up, they will lead you to the
narrow bridge, to ride your horses to and fro there, that they
may learn not to fear it in that light. When you have stabled
them go into the gardens and come hither unobserved, as the place
being so far away you can do. The guards will let you pass,
thinking only that you desire to drink a cup of wine with some
fair friend, as is the custom of our guests. Enter this
cave--here is the key," and she handed it to Wulf, "and if I be
not there, await me. Then I will tell you my plan, if I have any,
but until then I must scheme and think. Now it grows late--go."
</p><p>"And you, Masouda," said Godwin, doubtfully; "how will you escape
this place?"
</p><p>"By a road you do not know of, for I am mistress of the secrets
of this city. Still, I thank you for your thought of me. Go, I
say, and lock the door behind you."
</p><p>So they went in silence, doing as she bade them, and walked back
through the gardens, that now seemed empty enough, to the
stable-entrance of the guest-house, where the guards admitted
them without question.
</p><p>That night the brethren slept together in one bed, fearing that
if they lay separate they might be searched in their sleep and
not awake. Indeed, it seemed to them that, as before, they heard
footsteps and voices in the darkness.
</p><p>Next morning, when they had breakfasted, they loitered awhile,
hoping to win speech with Rosamund, or sight of her, or at the
least that Masouda would come to them; but they saw no Rosamund,
and no Masouda came. At length an officer appeared, and beckoned
to them to follow him. So they followed, and were led through the
halls and passages to the terrace of justice, where Sinan, clad
in his black robe, sat as before beneath a canopy in the midst of
the sun-lit marble floor. There, too, beside him, also beneath
the canopy and gorgeously apparelled, sat Rosamund. They strove
to advance and speak with her, but guards came between them,
pointing out a place where they must stand a few yards away. Only
Wulf said in a loud voice, in English:
</p><p>"Tell us, Rosamund, is it well with you?" Lifting her pale face,
she smiled and nodded.
</p><p>Then, at the bidding of Sinan, Masouda commanded them to be
silent, saying that it was not lawful for them to speak to the
Lord of the Mountain, or his Companion, unless they were first
bidden so to do. So, having learnt what they wished to know, they
were silent.
</p><p>Now some of the dais drew near the canopy, and consulted with
their master on what seemed to be a great matter, for their faces
were troubled. Presently he gave an order, whereon they resumed
their seats and messengers left the terrace. When they appeared
again, in their company were three noble-looking Saracens, who
were accompanied by a retinue of servants and wore green turbans,
showing that they were descendants of the Prophet. These men, who
seemed weary with long travel, marched up the terrace with a
proud mien, not looking at the dais or any one until they saw the
brethren standing side by side, at whom they stared a little.
Next they caught sight of Rosamund sitting in the shadow of the
canopy, and bowed to her, but of the Al-je-bal they took no
notice.
</p><p>"Who are you, and what is your pleasure?" asked Sinan, after he
had eyed them awhile. "I am the ruler of this country. These are
my ministers," and he pointed to the dais, "and here is my
sceptre," and he touched the bloodred dagger broidered on his
robe of black.
</p><p>Now that Sinan had declared himself the embassy bowed to him,
courteously enough. Then their spokesman answered him.
</p><p>"That sceptre we know; it has been seen afar. Twice already we
have cut down its bearers even in the tent of our master. Lord
of Murder, we acknowledge the emblem of murder, and we bow to
you whose title is the Great Murderer. As for our mission, it is
this. We are the ambassadors of Salah-ed-din, Commander of the
Faithful, Sultan of the East; in these papers signed with his
signet are our credentials, if you would read them."
</p><p>"So," answered Sinan, "I have heard of that chief. What is his
will with me?"
</p><p>"This, Al-je-bal. A Frank in your pay, and a traitor, has
betrayed to you a certain lady, niece of Salah-ed-din, the
princess of Baalbec, whose father was a Frankish noble named
D'Arcy, and who herself is named Rose of the World. The Sultan,
Salah-ed-din, having been informed of this matter by his servant,
the prince Hassan, who escaped from your soldiers, demands that
this lady, his niece, be delivered to him forthwith, and with her
the head of the Frank Lozelle."
</p><p>"The head of the Frank Lozelle he may have if he will after
to-morrow night. The lady I keep," snarled Sinan.
</p><p>"What then?"
</p><p>"Then, Al-je-bal, in the name of Salah-ed-din, we declare war on
you--war till this high place of yours is pulled stone from
stone; war till your tribe be dead, till the last man, woman, and
child be slain, until your carcass is tossed to the crows to feed
on."
</p><p>Now Sinan rose in fury and rent at his beard.
</p><p>"Go back," he said, "and tell that dog you name a sultan, that
low as he is, the humble-born son of Ayoub, I, Al-je-bal, do him
an honour that he does not observe. My queen is dead, and two
days from now, when my month of mourning is expired, I shall take
to wife his niece, the princess of Baalbec, who sits here beside
me, my bride-elect."
</p><p>At these words Rosamund, who had been listening intently, started
like one who has been stung by a snake, put her hands before her
face and groaned.
</p><p>"Princess," said the ambassador, who was watching her, "you seem
to understand our language; is this your will, to mate your noble
blood with that of the heretic chief of the Assassins ?"
</p><p>"Nay, nay!" she cried. "It is no will of mine, who am a helpless
prisoner and by faith a Christian. If my uncle Salah-ed-din is
indeed as great as I have heard, then let him show his power and
deliver me, and with me these my brethren, the knights Sir Godwin
and Sir Wulf."
</p><p>"So you speak Arabic," said Sinan. "Good; our loving converse
will be easier, and for the rest--well, the whims of women
change. Now, you messengers of Salah-ed-din, begone, lest I send
you on a longer journey, and tell your master that if he dares to
lift his standards against my walls my fedais shall speak with
him. By day and by night, not for one moment shall he be safe.
Poison shall lurk in his cup and a dagger in his bed. Let him
kill a hundred of them, and another hundred shall appear. His
most trusted guards shall be his executioners. The women in his
harem shall bring him to his doom--ay, death shall be in the very
air he breathes. If he would escape it, therefore, let him hide
himself within the walls of his city of Damascus, or amuse
himself with wars against the mad Cross-worshippers, and leave me
to live in peace with this lady whom I have chosen."
</p><p>"Great words, worthy of the Great Assassin," said the ambassador.
</p><p>"Great words in truth, which shall be followed by great deeds.
What chance has this lord of yours against a nation sworn to obey
to the death? You smile? Then come hither you--and you." And he
summoned two of his dais by name.
</p><p>They rose and bowed before him.
</p><p>"Now, my worthy servants," he said, "show these heretic dogs how
you obey, that their master may learn the power of your master.
You are old and weary of life. Begone, and await me in Paradise."
</p><p>The old men bowed again, trembling a little. Then, straightening
themselves, without a word they ran side by side and leapt into
the abyss.
</p><p>"Has Salah-ed-din servants such as these?" asked Sinan in the
silence that followed. "Well, what they have done, all would do,
if I bid them slay him. Back, now; and, if you will, take these
Franks with you, who are my guests, that they may bear witness of
what you have seen, and of the state in which you left their
sister. Translate to the knights, woman."
</p><p>So Masouda translated. Then Godwin answered through her.
</p><p>"We understand little of this matter, who are ignorant of your
tongue, but, O Al-je-bal, ere we leave your sheltering roof we
have a quarrel to settle with the man Lozelle. After that, with
your permission, we will go, but not before."
</p><p>Now Rosamund sighed as if in relief, and Sinan answered:
</p><p>"As you will; so be it," adding, "Give these envoys food and
drink before they go."
</p><p>But their spokesman answered: "We partake not of the bread and
salt of murderers, lest we should become of their fellowship.
Al-je-bal, we depart, but within a week we appear again in the
company of ten thousand spears, and on one of them shall your
head be set. Your safe-conduct guards us till the sunset. After
that, do your worst, as we do ours. High Princess, our counsel to
you is that you slay yourself and so gain immortal honour."
</p><p>Then, bowing to her one by one, they turned and marched down the
terrace followed by their servants.
</p><p>Now Sinan waved his hand and the court broke up, Rosamund leaving
it first, accompanied by Masouda and escorted by guards, after
which the brethren were commanded to depart also.
</p><p>So they went, talking earnestly of all these things, but save in
God finding no hope at all.
