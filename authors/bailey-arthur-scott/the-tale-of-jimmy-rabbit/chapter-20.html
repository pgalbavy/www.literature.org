<p>When that famous doctor, Aunt Polly Woodchuck, reached Mrs. Rabbit's
house, she said:
</p>
<p>"Is Jimmy worse? He ought to be almost well by this time; for mumps
don't last long, as a rule."
</p><p>"It isn't Jimmy," Mrs. Rabbit told her. "It's the hot-water bottle! I
find that it's full of holes; and I can't think how they came there."
</p><p>Aunt Polly put on another pair of spectacles.
</p><p>"Let me see it!" she said. "Aha!" she exclaimed, as she looked at the
hot-water bottle closely. "I thought so!" she said.
</p><p>"What is it?" Mrs. Rabbit inquired. "I hope it's nothing catching. For
just think what a fix we'd be in if all the children should have that
same trouble!"
</p><p>Aunt Polly told her not to worry.
</p><p>"You'd better get a new bottle," she said, "for this one can't be cured.
But I'll show you what to do to prevent the new hot-water bottle from
getting full of holes like this one.... Get me a piece of string!" said
Aunt Polly.
</p><p>Now, for some reason or other, Jimmy Rabbit began to feel very
uncomfortable. He was no longer in bed. And when he heard Aunt Polly ask
for a piece of string he started to sneak out of the room.
</p><p>But Aunt Polly saw him.
</p><p>"Come back here!" she said. "I want you!" And she made Jimmy sit at her
feet and wait until his mother returned.
</p><p>"Here!" Mrs. Rabbit said when she came back at last. "Is this string
what you need? It's a very strong piece."
</p><p>"Just the thing!" Aunt Polly told her. And she took hold of Jimmy
Rabbit.
</p><p>He began to howl. And he squirmed. And he would have kicked, if he had
dared.
</p><p>Aunt Polly Woodchuck did a strange thing then. She hung the hot-water
bottle from Jimmy's neck.
</p><p>"There!" she said. "Just let him wear that for a few days! I don't think
you'll have any more trouble with holes in hot-water bottles."
</p><p>"Have you known cases like this before?" Mrs. Rabbit asked her.
</p><p>"A few!" said Aunt Polly. "And this is by far the best way to treat
them. I've never known it to fail."
</p><p>"It seems to me it's rather hard on Jimmy," Mrs. Rabbit said.
</p><p>"Don't you worry about him!" Aunt Polly told her. "It will do him a
world of good."
</p><p>Jimmy Rabbit hung his head. He hated to have that hot-water bottle
dangling from his neck. And he made up his mind that he would never
prick another pin-hole in anything else so long as he lived.
</p><p>But he was glad of one thing. He was glad Aunt Polly hadn't told his
mother what he had done.
