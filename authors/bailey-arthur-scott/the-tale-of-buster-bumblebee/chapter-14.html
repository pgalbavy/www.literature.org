<p>It is not surprising that the Carpenter's answer failed to satisfy Buster
Bumblebee.
</p>
<p>"I really must know when my house will be ready!" he cried at last. "I've
invited all my friends to a house-warming. And how can I have one unless
I have a house to warm?"
</p><p>The Carpenter slowly shook his head.
</p><p>"Don't ask me!" he said wearily. "I've enough to trouble me right here at
home without answering any riddles for strangers."
</p><p>"I suppose you'll get your house finished sometime," Buster ventured.
</p><p>"I hope to," said the Carpenter, "though it certainly won't be to-morrow,
on account of all the interruptions I'm having to-day."
</p><p>Now, that honest workman meant his remark to be a hint. But the idea
never occurred to Buster that the Carpenter had <u>him</u> in mind, when he
mentioned interruptions. And Buster went right on talking.
</p><p>"I'd suggest that you work nights as well as in the daytime," he said.
</p><p>"I'll think about it," the Carpenter promised. "And now," he added, "now
I must go back to my carpentering--if you'll excuse me."
</p><p>And before Buster could say another word the Carpenter slipped through
his doorway and vanished.
</p><p>"I hope he'll do as I suggested," Buster Bumblebee said to himself, as he
moved aimlessly away from the big poplar where the Carpenter lived. "If I
shouldn't get my house until cold weather comes I don't see how I could
have a house-warming; and then all my friends would be disappointed."
</p><p>The more he thought about the matter the more disturbed he became, until
at last (on the following day) he felt that he simply <u>must</u> go back and
speak to the Carpenter again.
</p><p>Buster noticed, as he drew near to the Carpenter's house once more, that
there was a crowd in the Carpenter's dooryard. Everybody looked so
sorrowful that Buster was sure something dreadful had happened.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" he asked little Mrs. Ladybug, who was wiping her
eyes with a lace pocket-handkerchief.
</p><p>"It's the Carpenter," she answered, as soon as she could speak. "He's
disappeared. And now we've just heard what's become of him. Johnnie Green
caught him yesterday and has made him a prisoner!"
</p><p>That was bad news indeed--for Buster Bumblebee. He was so sorry that he
swallowed hard three or four times before he could say a word. And then
he began to groan.
</p><p>"This is terrible!" he moaned at last. And all the Carpenter's neighbors
gathered around him and said what a kind-hearted young gentleman he was,
but that it was no more than you might expect of a queen's son.
</p><p>"The Carpenter must have been a dear friend of yours," quavered old Daddy
Longlegs, tottering up to Buster and peering into his face.
</p><p>"Oh, no!" said Buster Bumblebee. "But he promised to build a house for me
as soon as he had finished working on his own. So his being a prisoner is
pretty hard on me. For I've invited all my friends to a house-warming and
I don't know what to do."
