<p>You shall seek in vain upon the map of Europe for the bygone state of
Grünewald.  An independent principality, an infinitesimal member of the
German Empire, she played, for several centuries, her part in the discord
of Europe; and, at last, in the ripeness of time and at the spiriting of
several bald diplomatists, vanished like a morning ghost.  Less fortunate
than Poland, she left not a regret behind her; and the very memory of her
boundaries has faded.
</p>
<p>It was a patch of hilly country covered with thick wood.  Many streams
took their beginning in the glens of Grünewald, turning mills for the
inhabitants.  There was one town, Mittwalden, and many brown, wooden
hamlets, climbing roof above roof, along the steep bottom of dells, and
communicating by covered bridges over the larger of the torrents.  The
hum of watermills, the splash of running water, the clean odour of pine
sawdust, the sound and smell of the pleasant wind among the innumerable
army of the mountain pines, the dropping fire of huntsmen, the dull
stroke of the wood-axe, intolerable roads, fresh trout for supper in the
clean bare chamber of an inn, and the song of birds and the music of the
village-bells—these were the recollections of the Grünewald tourist.
</p><p>North and east the foothills of Grünewald sank with varying profile into
a vast plain.  On these sides many small states bordered with the
principality, Gerolstein, an extinct grand duchy, among the number.  On
the south it marched with the comparatively powerful kingdom of Seaboard
Bohemia, celebrated for its flowers and mountain bears, and inhabited by
a people of singular simplicity and tenderness of heart.  Several
intermarriages had, in the course of centuries, united the crowned
families of Grünewald and Maritime Bohemia; and the last Prince of
Grünewald, whose history I purpose to relate, drew his descent through
Perdita, the only daughter of King Florizel the First of Bohemia.  That
these intermarriages had in some degree mitigated the rough, manly stock
of the first Grünewalds, was an opinion widely held within the borders of
the principality.  The charcoal burner, the mountain sawyer, the wielder
of the broad axe among the congregated pines of Grünewald, proud of their
hard hands, proud of their shrewd ignorance and almost savage lore,
looked with an unfeigned contempt on the soft character and manners of
the sovereign race.
</p><p>The precise year of grace in which this tale begins shall be left to the
conjecture of the reader.  But for the season of the year (which, in such
a story, is the more important of the two) it was already so far forward
in the spring, that when mountain people heard horns echoing all day
about the north-west corner of the principality, they told themselves
that Prince Otto and his hunt were up and out for the last time till the
return of autumn.
</p><p>At this point the borders of Grünewald descend somewhat steeply, here and
there breaking into crags; and this shaggy and trackless country stands
in a bold contrast to the cultivated plain below.  It was traversed at
that period by two roads alone; one, the imperial highway, bound to
Brandenau in Gerolstein, descended the slope obliquely and by the easiest
gradients.  The other ran like a fillet across the very forehead of the
hills, dipping into savage gorges, and wetted by the spray of tiny
waterfalls.  Once it passed beside a certain tower or castle, built sheer
upon the margin of a formidable cliff, and commanding a vast prospect of
the skirts of Grünewald and the busy plains of Gerolstein.  The
Felsenburg (so this tower was called) served now as a prison, now as a
hunting-seat; and for all it stood so lonesome to the naked eye, with the
aid of a good glass the burghers of Brandenau could count its windows
from the lime-tree terrace where they walked at night.
</p><p>In the wedge of forest hillside enclosed between the roads, the horns
continued all day long to scatter tumult; and at length, as the sun began
to draw near to the horizon of the plain, a rousing triumph announced the
slaughter of the quarry.  The first and second huntsman had drawn
somewhat aside, and from the summit of a knoll gazed down before them on
the drooping shoulders of the hill and across the expanse of plain.  They
covered their eyes, for the sun was in their faces.  The glory of its
going down was somewhat pale.  Through the confused tracery of many
thousands of naked poplars, the smoke of so many houses, and the evening
steam ascending from the fields, the sails of a windmill on a gentle
eminence moved very conspicuously, like a donkey’s ears.  And hard by,
like an open gash, the imperial high-road ran straight sun-ward, an
artery of travel.
</p><p>There is one of nature’s spiritual ditties, that has not yet been set to
words or human music: ‘The Invitation to the Road’; an air continually
sounding in the ears of gipsies, and to whose inspiration our nomadic
fathers journeyed all their days.  The hour, the season, and the scene,
all were in delicate accordance.  The air was full of birds of passage,
steering westward and northward over Grünewald, an army of specks to the
up-looking eye.  And below, the great practicable road was bound for the
same quarter.
</p><p>But to the two horsemen on the knoll this spiritual ditty was unheard.
They were, indeed, in some concern of mind, scanning every fold of the
subjacent forest, and betraying both anger and dismay in their impatient
gestures.
</p><p>‘I do not see him, Kuno,’ said the first huntsman, ‘nowhere—not a trace,
not a hair of the mare’s tail!  No, sir, he’s off; broke cover and got
away.  Why, for twopence I would hunt him with the dogs!’
</p><p>‘Mayhap, he’s gone home,’ said Kuno, but without conviction.
</p><p>‘Home!’ sneered the other.  ‘I give him twelve days to get home.  No,
it’s begun again; it’s as it was three years ago, before he married; a
disgrace!  Hereditary prince, hereditary fool!  There goes the government
over the borders on a grey mare.  What’s that?  No, nothing—no, I tell
you, on my word, I set more store by a good gelding or an English dog.
That for your Otto!’
</p><p>‘He’s not my Otto,’ growled Kuno.
</p><p>‘Then I don’t know whose he is,’ was the retort.
</p><p>‘You would put your hand in the fire for him to-morrow,’ said Kuno,
facing round.
</p><p>‘Me!’ cried the huntsman.  ‘I would see him hanged!  I’m a Grünewald
patriot—enrolled, and have my medal, too; and I would help a prince!  I’m
for liberty and Gondremark.’
</p><p>‘Well, it’s all one,’ said Kuno.  ‘If anybody said what you said, you
would have his blood, and you know it.’
</p><p>‘You have him on the brain,’ retorted his companion.  ‘There he goes!’ he
cried, the next moment.
</p><p>And sure enough, about a mile down the mountain, a rider on a white horse
was seen to flit rapidly across a heathy open and vanish among the trees
on the farther side.
</p><p>‘In ten minutes he’ll be over the border into Gerolstein,’ said Kuno.
‘It’s past cure.’
</p><p>‘Well, if he founders that mare, I’ll never forgive him,’ added the
other, gathering his reins.
</p><p>And as they turned down from the knoll to rejoin their comrades, the sun
dipped and disappeared, and the woods fell instantly into the gravity and
greyness of the early night.
