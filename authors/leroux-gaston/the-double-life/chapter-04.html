<p><em>LET </em>us leave Paris awhile and return to the little
estate on the banks of the Marne, which Théophraste generally
moved to with the first rays of the July sun. This year he was
to go there before Marceline and his friend, Adolphe, who had
been commissioned to survey the timbers on some lands elsewhere.
Thus these last few days he could spend alone in security and
peace to attend to this unusual treatise which his new position
in the world had given him.</p>

<p>The name of the house was "Villa Flots d’Azure." Théophraste
had given it this name against the wishes of Adolphe, who protested
that the name was for a villa near the sea. He had replied with
logic that he had often gone to the Preport, and that he had always
seen the sea green; that he knew the Marne, and that on account
of the reflected blue sky the water seemed blue. Do they not say
"the beautiful blue Danube"? It was not only the ocean that had
blue waves, so he did not see why he should not call his villa
on the Marne "Villa Flots d’Azure."</p>

<p>That day was the anniversary of their marriage. Théophraste was
very fond of Marceline, and these anniversaries were always the
occasion for much merry-making. Marceline also loved Théophraste,
and saw no reason why she should not like Adolphe equally as well,
whereas, on the other side, Adolphe adored Marceline and would
have died for Théophraste. On reflection, the name "Villa Flots
d’Amour" would have been more appropriate than "Villa Flots d’Azure,"
such harmony existed therein.</p>

<p>Théophraste shook Adolphe’s hand effusively. He complimented
his wife on her beauty. He had his green umbrella that day, and
in making his congratulations twirled it in a fashion, as he thought,
resembling the manner in which they used canes in the beginning
of the eighteenth century. He was not a vain person, but he knew
by this scientific miracle that he had been a great man two hundred
years ago, and he felt that he should convey the impression that
he had moved among great people and affairs.</p>

<p>It was their custom upon their return to their country house
to invite a few friends to a party to celebrate the occasion.
Upon this occasion Théophraste was at his best. He was in high
spirits, and while passing the good word to the gentlemen, made
flattering speeches to the ladies. The table was set in the garden
under a tent where the guests assembled. After a while the conversation
turned to the latest doings in angling. M. Lopard had caught a
trout of three pounds; old M. Tartoush had cast his line on Sunday—having
caught nothing, complained that people made too much noise shooting
during the week, and drove the fish from these waters. All joined
in the conversation and gave their experiences except M. Théophraste.</p>

<p>He kept silent. He found the topic too commonplace and felt a
desire to raise its level. He wanted it to drift into some subject
related to that preoccupying his mind. After awhile he was able
to get Adolphe interested in the subject of ghosts. From ghosts
the conversation led on to spiritualism. One lady knew a somnambulist
and related some strange stories which were calculated to work
upon the imagination of the company. Adolphe, upon this, explained
the spiritualistic point of view of the phenomena of somnambulism,
and cited well-known authorities. He seemed quite in his element,
and finally reached the point desired by Théophraste, the transmigration
of souls and reincarnation.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," said Marceline, "that a soul comes back to
live in its body? You have often told me so, Adolphe, but it seems
to me that one’s reason strongly repulses such an hypothesis."
"Nothing is lost in Nature," replied Adolphe, positively. "Neither
the soul nor the body. All is transformed, the soul as well as
the body. The reincarnation of souls at the end of a century is
a doctrine which goes back to such great antiquity that the ancient
philosophers do not deny it."</p>

<p>"If one’s soul returned to a body," said Marceline, "one would
surely know it."</p>

<p>"Not always," said Adolphe, "but sometimes." "Ah, sometimes?"
asked Théophraste, who was by this time becoming intensely interested.</p>

<p>"Yes, there are cases. For instance: Ptolemy Caesar, son of Caesar
and Cleopatra, who was king of Egypt before Christ, remembered
well to have been Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher, who lived 600
years before."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried the ladies, and the gentlemen smiled skeptically.</p>

<p>"You need not laugh, gentlemen. It is impossible to be more serious.
Our actual transformation, which is the final word in science,
is in full accord with the theory of reincarnation. What is transformation
except the idea that living things transform themselves, progressing
one into another? Nature presents herself to us under the aspect
of a spark, elaborately perfecting without ceasing to create,
to attain an ideal which will be the millennium. Whatever Nature
does for the body she does for the soul. It can be proved, for
I have studied this side a great deal, and it is the original
of all sciences.</p>

<p>Monsieur Adolphe was not understood by the company, a fact of
which he was inwardly proud. He liked to feel a superiority of
intellect, and often he would raise the conversation above the
level of his audience just to gratify his vanity. He touched on
many points which only need be referred to lightly here in order
to convince skeptics that the extraordinary history of Théophraste
is founded on a most scientific basis.</p>

<p>"The transmigration of souls was taught in India," said Adolphe;
"the cradle of the genus human, then in Egypt, then in Greece.
They chanted its mysteries in the name of Orpheus. Pythagoras,
who continued the teaching, did not admit with the philosophers
on the banks of the Ganges that the soul traveled over the cycle
of all animal existence. He made it come back, for example, into
a pig."</p>

<p>"There are some men," said Madame Beulie, "who still have the
souls of pigs."</p>

<p>"Without doubt," said Adolphe, smiling; "but what Pythagoras
says is that we must not conclude from that, that pigs have the
souls of men. Plato also adopts this doctrine. It is the first
which gave in the Phidon the proof that souls do not exile themselves
forever and that they come back to animate bodies anew."</p>

<p>"Oh, if we could only get proof of that it would be nothing for
me to die," declared old Mlle. Tabouret, who had a mortal terror
of dying.</p>

<p>"Here are the proofs," continued Adolphe. "They are two in number.
One is taken from the general law of Nature, the other from human
nature. First, Nature is governed by the laws of contraries, and
from that we see that while death succeeds life, all would end
by being absorbed in death, and Nature would one day come to an
end like Endymion. Therefore I say that we exist after death.</p>

<p>"Secondly, if after consulting the general laws of Nature we
turn to our own minds, we will find there the same dogma attested
by the fact of resemblance. ‘To learn,’ said Plato, ‘is nothing
but to recollect. Since our souls learn, they must have a resemblance.
What does it recollect except to have lived, and to have lived
in another body? Why can we not believe that in leaving the body
while it is animate at this time it can animate several others
in succession?’ I quote Plato literally," remarked Adolphe.</p>

<p>Then he passed from Plato to a modern authority. "Charles Fournier
has said: ‘Where is the old man who has not truly wished to be
born again, and to use in another life the experience he has acquired
in this?’ To pretend that that desire ought not to be realized
is to admit that God can deceive us. We ought then to recognize
that we have lived previous to being what we are, and that several
other lives await us. All these lives, to the number of eight
hundred and ten, are distributed between five periods and embrace
a span of eighty-one thousand years. Allan Hardai reckons that
the soul returns to another body after two or three thousand years
unless we die a violent death. Then it is quite possible one can
be reincarnated after two hundred years."</p>

<p>Adolphe had by this time drawn all around him and became the
center of attraction by his entertaining remarks. Théophraste
had sat open-eyed, listening intently, and upon hearing the last
remark thought "That is well. They may have hung me; so if I did
not die that way, they may have got rid of me by some other death
more in keeping with my station in life. Nevertheless," he thought,
"if all these people here could only realize that they had a prince
of the royal blood among them, they would be very much astonished,
and be filled with respect. But no, he will still be Théophraste
Longuet, manufacturer of rubber stamps."</p>

<p>Champagne was brought, and soon the air rang merrily with general
chatter and the explosion of corks. It was then that Marceline
turned around to Théophraste and begged him to sing the song which
he was accustomed to sing on the anniversary of their marriage.
He had sung it the day of their wedding, and on account of its
beauty they had adopted it as their wedding song. It was Lissette
de Baranger.</p>

<p>However, to the consternation of Marceline and all the guests,
instead of singing the song, he rose, threw his napkin on the
table and said to her in that strange voice which they heard at
the Conciergerie:</p>

<p>"As thou wishest, Marie Antoinette, I can refuse thee nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, my God," cried Marceline. "Hear what he called me in that
strange voice!"</p>

<p>The guests were obviously uncomfortable, and did not know what
to make of his peculiar behavior. The song was a vulgar song of
the Regency period, and certainly not for such a gathering as
was at this party. He sang it with the old French air:=</p>

<p>````Tou joli belle mimiere&mdash;</p>

<p>````Tou joli, moulin.=</p>
