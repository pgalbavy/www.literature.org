<p>A few minutes later, Ziffak came through the door of the king's
residence and greeted the explorers.</p>

<p>His dusky countenance showed unmistakable traces of emotion,
but like a true warrior, he knew how to govern his feelings. 
When he spoke, there was no agitation perceptible in his voice.</p>

<p>He motioned to his friends to enter the adjoining hut, where
Bippo and Pedros had been left.  The Professor showing a natural
timidity, he stepped forward and led the way.</p>

<p>Immediately, the party found themselves within a structure, which
while no larger than the others, still, in view of the royal prerogatives
of the occupant perhaps, possessed more conveniences.  The lower
apartment, or rather floor, was separated into three divisions,
the front being that in which the cooking was done, while serving
also for a sitting and general reception room.</p>

<p>The mother of Ziffak and King Haffgo was a tall, muscular widow
of threescore and ten, much wrinkled, but strong and active on
her feet. Her countenance was darker if possible than that of
the head chieftain, making it the more wonderful that Haffgo should
be the reverse in that respect of both.</p>

<p>The royal mother paid little heed to her visitors, probably believing
they were able to take care of themselves without help from her.
Indeed, shortly after the white men entered, she took her departure,
and was not seen again until dark, when she came in to help provide
them with their evening meal.</p>

<p>Bippo and Pedros finding themselves safe at last were doing what
they could to make up for the sleepless nights and hard labor
they had undergone on their way thither.  They were stretched
upon some skins in one corner, sleeping heavily and refreshingly.</p>

<p>Ziffak sat on the floor with the whites.  It was apparent from
his manner that he was on the point of making a communication
of importance, but he seemed to change his mind suddenly, and,
for a time, spoke upon matters of such trivial account that his
listeners were surprised.</p>

<p>The next astonishing thing which he did was to declare that the
stories he gave to Ashman the night before, when made a prisoner
by him were fables.  There was no enchanted lake in the neighborhood,
and his account of the burning mountain was a myth, as were his
yarns about the diamonds obtained from the same mountain.</p>

<p>The Professor nodded his head, laughed and said he was glad to
be told that; for, while he wished to believe their good friend,
when he was in earnest, he found it hard to swallow those marvellous
narratives which exceeded anything that had ever come to their
ears.</p>

<p>Long and Ashman also expressed great relief at the na√Øve confession
of the head chieftain.  All the same, however, not one of them
was deceived by the fellow's subterfuge.</p>

<p>They knew that the stories which Ziffak related on the shore
of the Xingu were true.  Seized at that time by a burst of confidence,
he had unburdened himself to the young man for whom he formed
such deep admiration.</p>

<p>Since that time, and especially since his angry interview with
his royal brother, he appreciated the grievous mistake he made
and was now anxious to recall it.  He, therefore, declared the
accounts to be of the Munchausen order.  His listeners read his
purpose and it suited them to let him think they accepted every
word of his remarkable recantation.</p>

<p>He impressed upon them that the king was angry because of their
coming to his village.  Indeed Ziffak was afraid that he would
recall his permission to allow them to stay the two days, and
might compel them to leave that night.</p>

<p>This was startling news, and, when Ziffak was pressed, he admitted
that during his absence on the Xingu to meet them, Waggaman and
Burkhardt had returned and secured an audience with His Majesty. 
This explained the new phase of matters and was anything but welcome
information, but there was no help for it.</p>

<p>The Professor asked Ziffak whether he could not bring the two
white men to his home, in order that an interview might be had. 
If that could be done, Grimcke was hopeful that a better understanding
could be established, but the head chieftain replied that he had
not seen either of the white men since he returned, nor did he
know where to find them. They occupied a building on the opposite
side of the king's home, but he was told they were not there. 
No doubt they were purposely keeping out of the way of the new-comers.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ashman asked their friend whether there was any objection
to his taking a stroll around the village and whether he was likely
to be molested.  Ziffak promptly replied that there could be no
earthly objection to anything of that nature, and springing to
his feet, gun in hand, he bade his friends good-bye, saying he
expected to be back with them at the end of an hour or so.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Ashman had any special errand in view,
when he formed this resolution, which was explainable upon the
well known laws governing the human mind.</p>

<p>He was tired of idleness.  The prospect of sitting for hours
in the darkening apartment, talking with Ziffak, who, instead
of being willing to give information, was doing his most to withhold
it, was not inviting, but beyond this, he was restless because
he was haunted by those marvellous eyes, peeping from behind the
curtain in the king's room, and that smile of recognition when
the gaze of the two met, thrilled him with a new and strange emotion.</p>

<p>It was this feeling which drove him forth.  He wanted to escape
the prying scrutiny of his friends, who, he fancied, suspected
his secret. He wanted to walk in the open air and think and revel
in the bliss of his new delight.</p>

<p>It was growing dark, when he stepped outside of the building. 
There was no light visible in any direction, though there would
be plenty of it later on.  The natives appeared to be moving aimlessly
about, and one or two near at hand scrutinized him curiously,
but they neither spoke nor made any movement to annoy him.  They
had not yet forgotten the lesson given by Ziffak some hours before.</p>

<p>To escape attention, he walked toward the river, passing down
the long sloping bank, until he reached the open, cleared space
which has been referred to as caused by the overflow of the water. 
Here the walking was easy, and, turning his face up stream, he
walked slowly as a man does who is in deep thought.</p>

<p>A man who is revelling in the first dream of love is not the
one to pay close attention to his surroundings.  He is so apt
to be rapt in his own sweet meditations, that he fails in the
most ordinary observation.</p>

<p>Reaching the bottom of the slope, Ashman glanced behind and on
his right.  He caught glimpses of several figures moving about
like shadows, but so far as he could judge, none of them was interested
in him.  Dismissing them from his mind, he moved on.</p>

<p>He had walked less than one-third of the length of the village
front, when the form of a man slipped softly down the incline,
following in his footsteps and moving as silently as a Murhapa
warrior tracking his foe through the forest.</p>

<p>He was dressed similarly to the American, having the same style
of Panama hat, shirt and boots, and he carried a rifle in his
hand.  Being of the same race, he ought to have been a friend,
but when the bright moonlight fell upon his face, it showed the
countenance of a demon.</p>

<p>He was Burkhardt, an escaped convict, who had lived for five
years among the Murhapas, and he was seeking the life of Fred
Ashman, who, in his enchanting visions of love, never dreamed
of the awful shadow stealing upon him.</p>
