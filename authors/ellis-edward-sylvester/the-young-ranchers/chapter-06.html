<p>At first thought, the abrupt departure of Tim Brophy may seem
an imprudent thing, since it left only one man to look after the
safety of Mrs. Starr and their little one; but it will be remembered
that the hope of safety lay not in fighting, but in flight; and
the presence or absence of the young Irishman could not affect
that one way or the other.</p>

<p>Accordingly, with a pause only long enough to draw a substantial
lunch from the provision bag and to bid his friends good-by, Tim
wheeled his horse and was off like a shot. He took good care to
avoid the neighborhood of the bucks, and soon left the ranch far
behind, speeding along the trail over which Warren Starr was at
that moment galloping toward him.</p>

<p>The youth drove his task through with all the impetuosity of
his nature. He was devotedly attached to the son of his employer,
and was ready at any time, as he had always been, to risk his
life for him. Believing as he did that he was in more imminent
peril than anyone else, he bent every energy toward reaching and
turning him aside before it was too late.</p>

<p>In this essay, Tim committed a mistake which Warren Starr narrowly
avoided. He acted on the theory that the only real danger was
in the immediate neighborhood of the ranch, and that none existed
near the ridges between which the trail led. The consequence was
that, when he was not dreaming of any such thing, he suddenly
became the target for a fusillade from Sioux rifles that were
waiting to receive young Starr, and therefore were not fully prepared
for him. By desperate work and good fortune he and his pony ran
the gauntlet unscathed, and continued their flight southward.
The whinny of his friend's pony, he supposed, came from one of
the horses of his enemies, and therefore he galloped on without
paying any heed to it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as will be remembered, young Starr had pushed through
the falling snow and gathering darkness until he and his horse
reached the primitive shelter among the rocks, bowlders, and trees
which he had used when on previous hunting expeditions. After
he and Jack had disposed themselves for the night they were disturbed
by the approach of someone. Rising to his feet, Warren hurried
stealthily to the door, where he ran directly against the intruder,
whom he was unable to recognize in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked, holding his revolver ready for instant
use, but unwilling to fire until sure he was facing an enemy.</p>

<p>"Timothy Brophy, Esq., at your service," replied his friend,
identifying the other by his voice.</p>

<p>"Why, Tim, I can't tell you how glad I am to see you," exclaimed
the delighted Warren: "I have thought a score of times, when on
the way, how pleasant it would be to meet you. What brought you
here?"</p>

<p>"My horse, and I presume that yours did the same for yersilf."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Outside, near by, wid the bist shelter I could give him: I didn't
saa your own."</p>

<p>"He's inside, sharing my couch with me, or, rather, was doing
so when you disturbed us."</p>

<p>Tim broke into laughter.</p>

<p>"That's a good idaa; I niver heerd of anything like it before.
Is there room for Billy, too?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we would be crowded; but come inside till I strike
a match and show you how things are fixed."</p>

<p>The two entered, and Warren ignited another lucifer. Jack was
evidently puzzled, raising his head and looking at them in a way
which suggested that he would like to come to his feet.</p>

<p>"Lie down, old fellow!" commanded his master; "there's nothing
to be disturbed about; you couldn't have better quarters, and
you will be wise to stay where you are; you're better off than
Billy."</p>

<p>Now that Tim had arrived with his blanket, it was decided that
the pony should be left where he was, while the youths lay down
on the other covering, which was wrapped about them.</p>

<p>Then they curled up and made themselves as comfortable as on
their previous stay in the rude shelter.</p>

<p>Lying thus, they naturally talked over what had taken place since
their last meeting. Warren's voice trembled when he told the story
of Bruno, who gave his life for him and his friends, and Tim related
what had befallen the others during the day.</p>

<p>Young Starr was filled with alarm for his parents and little
sister, but Tim was hopeful that everything would come out right,
and that, by the time the sun rose, they would be so far advanced
on their way to Fort Meade that the danger would be virtually
over.</p>

<p>"Ye knows," he continued, "that yer fayther is acquainted wid
the way as well as yerself; the horses are frish and strong, and
he'll not spare thim; the road, too, is not as long as by the
rig'lar route that we've follyed so often."</p>

<p>"That is true, but it must be all of thirty miles, and is really
much greater because of the ridges, hills, streams, and difficult
places in the path, which will compel many detours."</p>

<p>"And the same will have to be observed by the spalpeens that
may be thrying to overtake thim."</p>

<p>"But they understand the business better."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sartin of that," sturdily replied Tim; "yer fayther
is no green hand."</p>

<p>"That isn't what I mean; I'm thinking of mother and Dot; he will
have to accommodate himself to them, and in case the Indians do
come up with them&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Arrah, now, what are ye thinking of?" demanded Tim impatiently;
"if ye want to go to specylatin' and 'ifing,' ye may refar to
oursilves and say that if the spalpeens come down here wid Sitting
Bull laading the same, and they sit fire to this ilegant risidence,
what will become of us?"</p>

<p>"That is very well, Tim, and you mean right, but I shall not
rest a minute until I know they have reached the fort. It's strange,
too, about Plummer."</p>

<p>"It's my opinion," remarked the Irishman, lowering his voice,
as though afraid of being overheard, "that he's in throuble."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Because he did not show up before we lift; he hadn't any farther
to go than mesilf, and it was nearly an hour after I got back
before we come away, but there was no sign of him."</p>

<p>"Did you hear no firing?"</p>

<p>"Not that I remimber; which reminds me that it was also quaar
that the Sioux could have shot down the cattle as they did, so
near the house, widout any of us noting the noise of their guns."</p>

<p>"It was singular, but perhaps you were all inside at the time,
busy at something. At any rate, instead of our hurrying back to
the fort, we will do our best to find father and mother, and stick
by them to the end."</p>

<p>"I'm wid ye there," was the hearty response of Tim; "I'd like
to give Plummer a helping hand, but see no way to do the same,
and it is likely that he can get along better widout us than wid
us."</p>

<p>The two talked a long time, for their hearts were full. It was
not until midnight that a feeling of drowsiness began creeping
over them. Tim's remarks began to grow slower and more disconnected,
until finally he failed to answer at all. Finding that he was
asleep, Warren composed himself as comfortably as he could, and
soon joined him in the land of dreams.</p>

<p>The snow continued sifting softly downward, and rattled against
the branches and leaves which composed a portion of their house.
The temperature sank as the night progressed, and the situation
of the couple, no less than that of their friends, became anything
but hopeful.</p>

<p>They were still a long way from the post, where they could feel
secure, and the Indians were certain to press them hard. They
were so much more numerous than the little band of fugitives that
the advantage lay wholly with them.</p>

<p>But the night passed without disturbance. Then the pony and the
two youths awoke simultaneously, for they were aroused by one
of the most startling causes that can be conceived: It was the
screaming whinny of Tim Brophy's horse&mdash;a cry rarely heard from
the animal, and only when in the very extremity of mortal terror.</p>
