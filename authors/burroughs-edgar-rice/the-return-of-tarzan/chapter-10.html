As Tarzan walked down the wild canon beneath the brilliant
African moon the call of the jungle was strong upon him.
The solitude and the savage freedom filled his heart with
life and buoyancy.  Again he was Tarzan of the Apes--every
sense alert against the chance of surprise by some jungle
enemy--yet treading lightly and with head erect, in proud
consciousness of his might.
<P>
The nocturnal sounds of the mountains were new to him,
yet they fell upon his ears like the soft voice of a half-
forgotten love.  Many he intuitively sensed--ah, there was one
that was familiar indeed; the distant coughing of Sheeta, the
leopard; but there was a strange note in the final wail which
made him doubt.  It was a panther he heard.
<P>
Presently a new sound--a soft, stealthy sound--obtruded
itself among the others.  No human ears other than the ape-
man's would have detected it.  At first he did not translate it,
but finally he realized that it came from the bare feet of a
number of human beings.  They were behind him, and they
were coming toward him quietly.  He was being stalked.
<P>
In a flash he knew why he had been left in that little
valley by Gernois; but there had been a hitch in the
arrangements--the men had come too late.  Closer and closer came
the footsteps.  Tarzan halted and faced them, his rifle ready in
his hand.  Now he caught a fleeting glimpse of a white burnoose.
He called aloud in French, asking what they would of him.
His reply was the flash of a long gun, and with the sound of
the shot Tarzan of the Apes plunged forward upon his face.
<P>
The Arabs did not rush out immediately; instead, they
waited to be sure that their victim did not rise.  Then they
came rapidly from their concealment, and bent over him.
It was soon apparent that he was not dead.  One of the men put
the muzzle of his gun to the back of Tarzan's head to finish
him, but another waved him aside.  "If we bring him alive
the reward is to be greater," explained the latter.
So they bound his hands and feet, and, picking him up,
placed him on the shoulders of four of their number.
Then the march was resumed toward the desert.  When they had
come out of the mountains they turned toward the south, and
about daylight came to the spot where their horses stood
in care of two of their number.
<P>
From here on their progress was more rapid.  Tarzan, who
had regained consciousness, was tied to a spare horse, which
they evidently had brought for the purpose.  His wound was but
a slight scratch, which had furrowed the flesh across his temple.
It had stopped bleeding, but the dried and clotted
blood smeared his face and clothing.  He had said no word
since he had fallen into the hands of these Arabs, nor had
they addressed him other than to issue a few brief commands
to him when the horses had been reached.
<P>
For six hours they rode rapidly across the burning desert,
avoiding the oases near which their way led.  About noon
they came to a DOUAR of about twenty tents.  Here they
halted, and as one of the Arabs was releasing the alfa-grass
ropes which bound him to his mount they were surrounded
by a mob of men, women, and children.  Many of the tribe,
and more especially the women, appeared to take delight in
heaping insults upon the prisoner, and some had even gone
so far as to throw stones at him and strike him with
sticks, when an old sheik appeared and drove them away.
<P>
"Ali-ben-Ahmed tells me," he said, "that this man sat alone
in the mountains and slew EL ADREA.  What the business of
the stranger who sent us after him may be, I know not, and what
he may do with this man when we turn him over to him, I
care not; but the prisoner is a brave man, and while he is in
our hands he shall be treated with the respect that be due
one who hunts THE LORD WITH THE LARGE HEAD alone and by
night--and slays him."
<P>
Tarzan had heard of the respect in which Arabs held a
lion-killer, and he was not sorry that chance had played into
his hands thus favorably to relieve him of the petty tortures
of the tribe.  Shortly after this he was taken to a goat-
skin tent upon the upper side of the DOUAR.  There he was
fed, and then, securely bound, was left lying on a piece of
native carpet, alone in the tent.
<P>
He could see a guard sitting before the door of his frail
prison, but when he attempted to force the stout bonds that
held him he realized that any extra precaution on the part
of his captors was quite unnecessary; not even his giant
muscles could part those numerous strands.
<P>
Just before dusk several men approached the tent where
he lay, and entered it.  All were in Arab dress, but presently
one of the number advanced to Tarzan's side, and as he let
the folds of cloth that had hidden the lower half of his face
fall away the ape-man saw the malevolent features of
Nikolas Rokoff.  There was a nasty smile on the bearded lips.
"Ah, Monsieur Tarzan," he said, "this is indeed a pleasure.
But why do you not rise and greet your guest?"  Then, with
an ugly oath, "Get up, you dog!" and, drawing back his
booted foot, he kicked Tarzan heavily in the side.  "And here
is another, and another, and another," he continued, as he
kicked Tarzan about the face and side.  "One for each of the
injuries you have done me."
<P>
The ape-man made no reply--he did not even deign to look
upon the Russian again after the first glance of recognition.
Finally the sheik, who had been standing a mute and frowning
witness of the cowardly attack, intervened.
<P>
"Stop!" he commanded.  "Kill him if you will, but I will
see no brave man subjected to such indignities in my presence.
I have half a mind to turn him loose, that I may see how
long you would kick him then."
<P>
This threat put a sudden end to Rokoff's brutality, for he
had no craving to see Tarzan loosed from his bonds while
he was within reach of those powerful hands.
<P>
"Very well," he replied to the Arab; "I shall kill him presently."
<P>
"Not within the precincts of my DOUAR," returned the
sheik.  "When he leaves here he leaves alive.  What you do
with him in the desert is none of my concern, but I shall
not have the blood of a Frenchman on the hands of my tribe
on account of another man's quarrel--they would send
soldiers here and kill many of my people, and burn our tents
and drive away our flocks."
<P>
"As you say," growled Rokoff.  "I'll take him out into the
desert below the DOUAR, and dispatch him."
<P>
"You will take him a day's ride from my country," said
the sheik, firmly, "and some of my children shall follow you
to see that you do not disobey me--otherwise there may be
two dead Frenchmen in the desert."
<P>
Rokoff shrugged.  "Then I shall have to wait until the
morrow--it is already dark."
<P>
"As you will," said the sheik.  "But by an hour after dawn
you must be gone from my DOUAR.  I have little liking for
unbelievers, and none at all for a coward."
<P>
Rokoff would have made some kind of retort, but he
checked himself, for he realized that it would require
but little excuse for the old man to turn upon him.
Together they left the tent.  At the door Rokoff could not
resist the temptation to turn and fling a parting taunt at Tarzan.
"Sleep well, monsieur," he said, "and do not forget to pray well,
for when you die tomorrow it will be in such agony that you will
be unable to pray for blaspheming."
<P>
No one had bothered to bring Tarzan either food or water since
noon, and consequently he suffered considerably from thirst.
He wondered if it would be worth while to ask his
guard for water, but after making two or three requests
without receiving any response, he decided that it would not.
<P>
Far up in the mountains he heard a lion roar.  How much
safer one was, he soliloquized, in the haunts of wild beasts
than in the haunts of men.  Never in all his jungle life had he
been more relentlessly tracked down than in the past few
months of his experience among civilized men.  Never had he
been any nearer death.
<P>
Again the lion roared.  It sounded a little nearer.  Tarzan felt
the old, wild impulse to reply with the challenge of his kind.
His kind?  He had almost forgotten that he was a man and not an ape.
He tugged at his bonds.  God, if he could but get them near
those strong teeth of his.  He felt a wild wave of madness sweep
over him as his efforts to regain his liberty met with failure.
<P>
Numa was roaring almost continually now.  It was quite
evident that he was coming down into the desert to hunt.
It was the roar of a hungry lion.  Tarzan envied him, for he
was free.  No one would tie him with ropes and slaughter
him like a sheep.  It was that which galled the ape-man.
He did not fear to die, no--it was the humiliation of defeat
before death, without even a chance to battle for his life.
<P>
It must be near midnight, thought Tarzan.  He had several
hours to live.  Possibly he would yet find a way to take
Rokoff with him on the long journey.  He could hear the savage
lord of the desert quite close by now.  Possibly he sought
his meat from among the penned animals within the DOUAR.
<P>
For a long time silence reigned, then Tarzan's trained ears
caught the sound of a stealthily moving body.  It came
from the side of the tent nearest the mountains--the back.
Nearer and nearer it came.  He waited, listening intently, for
it to pass.  For a time there was silence without, such a terrible
silence that Tarzan was surprised that he did not hear the
breathing of the animal he felt sure must be crouching close
to the back wall of his tent.
<P>
There!  It is moving again.  Closer it creeps.  Tarzan turns his
head in the direction of the sound.  It is very dark within the tent.
Slowly the back rises from the ground, forced up by the head and
shoulders of a body that looks all black in the semi-darkness.
Beyond is a faint glimpse of the dimly starlit desert.
A grim smile plays about Tarzan's lips.  At least Rokoff will
be cheated.  How mad he will be!  And death will be more
merciful than he could have hoped for at the hands of the Russian.
<P>
Now the back of the tent drops into place, and all is darkness
again--whatever it is is inside the tent with him.  He hears
it creeping close to him--now it is beside him.  He closes
his eyes and waits for the mighty paw.  Upon his upturned
face falls the gentle touch of a soft hand groping in the dark,
and then a girl's voice in a scarcely audible whisper
pronounces his name.
<P>
"Yes, it is I," he whispers in reply.  "But in the name of
Heaven who are you?"
<P>
"The Ouled-Nail of Sisi Aissa," came the answer.  While she
spoke Tarzan could feel her working about his bonds.
Occasionally the cold steel of a knife touched his flesh.
A moment later he was free.
<P>
"Come!" she whispered.
<P>
On hands and knees he followed her out of the tent by the way
she had come.  She continued crawling thus flat to the ground
until she reached a little patch of shrub.  There she halted
until he gained her side.  For a moment he looked at her
before he spoke.
<P>
"I cannot understand," he said at last.  "Why are you here?
How did you know that I was a prisoner in that tent?
How does it happen that it is you who have saved me?"
<P>
She smiled.  "I have come a long way tonight," she said,
"and we have a long way to go before we shall be out of danger.
Come; I shall tell you all about as we go."
<P>
Together they rose and set off across the desert in the
direction of the mountains.
<P>
"I was not quite sure that I should ever reach you," she
said at last.  "EL ADREA is abroad tonight, and after
I left the horses I think he winded me and was following--I
was terribly frightened."
<P>
"What a brave girl," he said.  "And you ran all that risk
for a stranger--an alien--an unbeliever?"
<P>
She drew herself up very proudly.
<P>
"I am the daughter of the Sheik Kabour ben Saden," she answered.
"I should be no fit daughter of his if I would not risk my
life to save that of the man who saved mine while he yet
thought that I was but a common Ouled-Nail."
<P>
"Nevertheless," he insisted, "you are a very brave girl.
But how did you know that I was a prisoner back there?"
<P>
"Achmet-din-Taieb, who is my cousin on my father's side, was
visiting some friends who belong to the tribe that captured you.
He was at the DOUAR when you were brought in.  When he reached
home he was telling us about the big Frenchman who had been
captured by Ali-ben-Ahmed for another Frenchman who wished
to kill him.  From the description I knew that it must be you.
My father was away.  I tried to persuade some of the men to
come and save you, but they would not do it, saying:  `Let the
unbelievers kill one another if they wish.  It is none of our
affair, and if we go and interfere with Ali-ben-Ahmed's plans
we shall only stir up a fight with our own people.'
<P>
"So when it was dark I came alone, riding one horse and
leading another for you.  They are tethered not far from here.
By morning we shall be within my father's DOUAR.
He should be there himself by now--then let them come and
try to take Kadour ben Saden's friend."
<P>
For a few moments they walked on in silence.
<P>
"We should be near the horses," she said.  "It is strange
that I do not see them here."
<P>
Then a moment later she stopped, with a little cry of consternation.
<P>
"They are gone!" she exclaimed.  "It is here that I tethered them."
<P>
Tarzan stooped to examine the ground.  He found that a
large shrub had been torn up by the roots.  Then he found
something else.  There was a wry smile on his face as he rose
and turned toward the girl.
<P>
"EL ADREA has been here.  From the signs, though, I rather
think that his prey escaped him.  With a little start they
would be safe enough from him in the open."
<P>
There was nothing to do but continue on foot.  The way
led them across a low spur of the mountains, but the girl
knew the trail as well as she did her mother's face.
They walked in easy, swinging strides, Tarzan keeping a hand's
breadth behind the girl's shoulder, that she might set the
pace, and thus be less fatigued.  As they walked they talked,
occasionally stopping to listen for sounds of pursuit.
<P>
It was now a beautiful, moonlit night.  The air was crisp
and invigorating.  Behind them lay the interminable vista of
the desert, dotted here and there with an occasional oasis.
The date palms of the little fertile spot they had just left,
and the circle of goatskin tents, stood out in sharp relief
against the yellow sand--a phantom paradise upon a phantom sea.
Before them rose the grim and silent mountains.  Tarzan's blood
leaped in his veins.  This was life!  He looked down upon the
girl beside him--a daughter of the desert walking across the
face of a dead world with a son of the jungle.  He smiled at
the thought.  He wished that he had had a sister, and that she
had been like this girl.  What a bully chum she would have been!
<P>
They had entered the mountains now, and were progressing
more slowly, for the trail was steeper and very rocky.
<P>
For a few minutes they had been silent.  The girl was
wondering if they would reach her father's DOUAR before the
pursuit had overtaken them.  Tarzan was wishing that they
might walk on thus forever.  If the girl were only a man
they might.  He longed for a friend who loved the same wild
life that he loved.  He had learned to crave companionship,
but it was his misfortune that most of the men he knew
preferred immaculate linen and their clubs to nakedness and
the jungle.  It was, of course, difficult to understand,
yet it was very evident that they did.
<P>
The two had just turned a projecting rock around which
the trail ran when they were brought to a sudden stop.
There, before them, directly in the middle of the path, stood
Numa, EL ADREA, the black lion.  His green eyes looked very
wicked, and he bared his teeth, and lashed his bay-black sides
with his angry tail.  Then he roared--the fearsome, terror-
inspiring roar of the hungry lion which is also angry.
<P>
"Your knife," said Tarzan to the girl, extending his hand.
She slipped the hilt of the weapon into his waiting palm.
As his fingers closed upon it he drew her back and pushed her
behind him.  "Walk back to the desert as rapidly as you can.
If you hear me call you will know that all is well, and
you may return."
<P>
"It is useless," she replied, resignedly.  "This is the end."
<P>
"Do as I tell you," he commanded.  "Quickly!  He is about
to charge."  The girl dropped back a few paces, where she
stood watching for the terrible sight that she knew she
should soon witness.
<P>
The lion was advancing slowly toward Tarzan, his nose to
the ground, like a challenging bull, his tail extended now
and quivering as though with intense excitement.
<P>
The ape-man stood, half crouching, the long Arab knife
glistening in the moonlight.  Behind him the tense figure of
the girl, motionless as a carven statue.  She leaned slightly
forward, her lips parted, her eyes wide.  Her only conscious
thought was wonder at the bravery of the man who dared
face with a puny knife the lord with the large head.  A man
of her own blood would have knelt in prayer and gone down
beneath those awful fangs without resistance.  In either case
the result would be the same--it was inevitable; but she could
not repress a thrill of admiration as her eyes rested upon
the heroic figure before her.  Not a tremor in the whole
giant frame--his attitude as menacing and defiant as that of
EL ADREA himself.
<P>
The lion was quite close to him now--but a few paces
intervened--he crouched, and then, with a deafening
roar, he sprang.
