<p>At this moment the Texan heard something.</p>

<p>The noise could not have been any more distinct than that which
had apprised the Comanche of his peril just in time to save himself.
It was so faint, indeed, that it was not until he had listened
a few seconds longer that he could decide the precise point whence
it came.</p>

<p>It was at the same end of the cabin, but on the corner opposite
to that where he had detected the warrior. The captain, therefore,
was forced to peep over the edge of the peak, in order to hold
his gaze on the point. This was easy enough, and, as he stealthily
peered through the gloom, he levelled his weapon, in whose use
he was as skilful as that of the Winchester.</p>

<p>He had decided in his mind the precise point where the head of
the Indian would rise to view, and he was resolved not to throw
away his chance this time. The moment he could make sure of his
target, he would perforate it with several bullets, in order to
prevent any possible mistake.</p>

<p>But, though the sound was repeated, the object itself failed
to materialize. It was there, but he could not see it clearly
enough to risk a shot.</p>

<p>Strange that, with all the Texan's experience, this fact did
not lead him to suspect the real cause of the warrior's continued
absence!</p>

<p>But at the moment he began speculating, he became convinced that
his enemy was moving. He was there and had betrayed himself.</p>

<p>Everyone knows the extreme difficulty of seeing an object distinctly
when the light is poor, and we concentrate our gaze upon it. That
which is clear at first grows dim and perhaps vanishes altogether
from sight.</p>

<p>Something of the kind is noticeable when we try to count the
seven stars of the Pleiades. It is easy enough to fix upon six,
but if we gaze too intently, the seventh modestly withdraws from
view.</p>

<p>This was the case for a minute or two with Captain Shirril. The
first glance at the suspicious point showed him the outlines of
a head, but while gazing at it, he began to doubt whether it was
there at all. Aware of the peculiarity named, he turned his eyes
toward a spot several feet removed, and then glanced back to the
original point.</p>

<p>The Comanche was there!</p>

<p>The Texan sighted his pistol as best he could in the obscurity,
but, while doing so with all care, the target began to grow dim,
until he was afraid that, if he pressed the trigger, a miss would
result, and surely he could not afford that.</p>

<p>"I'll wait," was his decision; "he can't know that I'm on the
watch, and there will be more of him in sight before long."</p>

<p>It was remarkable indeed that the sagacious captain still failed
to suspect the object of this strange proceeding.</p>

<p>There came the moment when there was no cause for longer delay.
The shoulders were in sight, and the skilful marksman was certain
of bringing the warrior down with his first bullet.</p>

<p>But at the moment of firing, he was restrained by a strange suspicion,
or rather a strange occurrence.</p>

<p>The head of the Comanche made an abrupt flirt to one side&mdash;then
straightened up, flopped still more in the other direction, and
then became upright again.</p>

<p>This was not only extraordinary, but it was something which a
genuine Indian would never do, whether he belonged to the Comanche
or some other tribe.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha&mdash;that's your game, is it?" muttered the Texan, catching
on to the truth.</p>

<p>The cunning red men were making use of a dummy instead of one
of their own number, and, astounding as the statement may seem,
this dummy was the very warrior that had fallen by the shot of
Oscar Gleeson.</p>

<p>Instead of trusting the success of their scheme to an image made
by mounting a blanket over the end of a stick, and which might
well deceive where there was so little light, they had picked
up the inanimate body, lifted it upon the back of one of their
mustangs, and slowly elevated it above the eaves, imitating the
natural action as closely as they could.</p>

<p>However, they ought to have practiced the trick before risking
so much on its success. Everything was going right, until the
head reached a point where it was not advisable to support it
further, since the hands thus employed were likely to receive
some of the bullets they expected to be fired after it.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the support caused it to tip to one side, and
the too prompt effort to retrieve the mistake sent it in the opposite
direction. This mishap was quickly repaired, but not until the
deception had become manifest to the watchful Texan, who smiled
grimly, without suspecting the deeper meaning of the performance.</p>

<p>"I don't think I will throw away any shots on <em>you</em>" he
said to himself; "for there will be plenty of other chances where
more good may be done."</p>

<p>A thoughtful man might have concluded that the Comanches were
taking a good deal of unnecessary pains. Suppose the white man
did send several bullets into the dummy, there was no hope of
his exhausting his supply or of the Comanche finding him wholly
unprepared.</p>

<p>They probably believed that, after such a discharge on his part,
he would not expect an instant renewal of the attempt, and would,
therefore, be off his guard for a few seconds, during which they
could make their rush.</p>

<p>This was drawing it exceedingly fine, and the Texan did not attempt
to explain that which must always remain a partial mystery.</p>

<p>"I wonder now whether that can be a little plan to hold my attention,
while they try something in another direction," was his next thought,
which proved that Captain Shirril was at last approaching the
right trail.</p>

<p>The image, or rather body, having been raised far enough above
the eaves to show the head and shoulders, remained as stationary
as if carved in wood. It was unsafe for its projectors to trust
it further without support. It was now ready to receive the fire
of the gentleman, and the Comanches might well ask why it was
he delayed opening business.</p>

<p>He kept it under scrutiny a few seconds longer, fearful that
there might be some hidden design which he did not understand;
and then, in obedience to his suspicion, he turned his head to
look over the roof behind him.</p>

<p>At the moment of doing so, he heard a stealthy but rapid step.
The first glance showed him a sinewy warrior, moving softly across
the planking from the other end of the cabin and coming directly
toward him.</p>

<p>The Comanche was in a crouching posture, with his rifle in his
left hand, while his right rested on his hip, as if grasping the
handle of his knife.</p>

<p>Supposing the dusky foe was coming for him, Captain Shirril rose
to a half-sitting position, and held his revolver ready. He meant
to wait until his enemy was so near that there could be no possibility
of missing him.</p>

<p>Before that point was reached, the Comanche would have to pass
directly by the open scuttle. The Texan awaited his coming with
the same coolness he had shown from the first, when to his inexpressible
amazement the Indian dropped directly through the open door and
drew it shut after him, with a suddenness like that of the snapping
of a knife-blade.</p>

<p>And then it was that Captain Shirril read the meaning of that
strange manoeuvring at the corner of the roof, and awoke to the
fact that he had been completely outwitted.</p>
