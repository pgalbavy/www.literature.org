<p>At the southern part of Ohio, where the river of that name swerves
from its south-western course, and makes a sweeping bend toward
the north-west, many years ago stood a large and imposing dwelling.
Its character, so different and superior to others found here
and there along the Ohio, showed that its owner must have been
a man both of superior taste and abundant means. It had been built
by Sir William Leland, who had emigrated from Europe with his
young wife, and erected a home in the western wilderness. Here
they lived a goodly number of days; and when, at last, they took
their departure within a year of each other, they left behind
them a son and daughter to cherish and inherit their home.</p>

<p>George Leland, at the time of which we speak, was but twenty,
while his sister Rosalind was three years his junior. Yet both,
with the assistance of a faithful negro servant, managed to live
quite comfortably. The soil was exceedingly rich, and, with a
little pains, yielded abundantly every thing that could be wished,
while the river and wood were unfailing resources. Three years
had elapsed since the elder Leland's death, and during that time,
although living in a country swarming with Indians, nothing had
occurred to alarm the fears of our friends, or even to give them
the slightest suspicion that danger threatened them.</p>

<p>[Illustration: George and Rosalind.]</p>

<p>When Sir William settled in this section, he followed the example
of the great founder of Pennsylvania, and purchased every foot
of his land from those who claimed it; and, in addition to the
liberal remuneration which each received, they were given some
charming present by their pale-faced brother. This secured their
friendship; and, although many miles intervened between the whites
and their nearest kindred, yet they had nothing to fear from the
savages who surrounded them. Thus matters stood when George and
Rosalind were left orphans, some years before the opening of our
story.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant day in early summer that George and his sister
were seated in front of their house. The sun was just setting,
and they had remained thus a long time. Zeb, the negro, was absent
for the time, and they were thus undisturbed.</p>

<p>"Do you really think," pursued the sister, "it can be true that
the Indians have perpetrated the outrages which have been reported?"</p>

<p>"I should be glad to think differently, could I have reason for
doing so; but these reports certainly have foundation; and what
is more alarming, the suspicion that we are <em>not</em> safe,
which was awakened some time ago, is now confirmed. For two or
three days I have detected suspicious appearances, and Zeb informed
me that he discovered a couple of savages lurking around the edge
of the forest. I fear there is strong reason to apprehend danger."</p>

<p>"But, brother, will not the kindness which our parents showed
them while living be a guaranty of our protection?"</p>

<p>"It may, to some extent; but you must remember that there are
hundreds of Indians who have never seen or heard of them, who
would not hesitate to kill or take us prisoners at the first opportunity."</p>

<p>"Can it be possible?"</p>

<p>"It is not only possible but true. You remember Roland Leslie,
who was here last summer? Yesterday I saw him up the river, and
he gave me the information that I have repeated. At first I deferred
mentioning it to you, for the reason that I did not wish to alarm
you until it could not be avoided."</p>

<p>"Why did he not come here?" asked the sister.</p>

<p>"He said that he should shortly visit us. He had heard rumors
of another massacre some miles up the river, and wished to satisfy
himself in regard to it before calling here. Leslie, although
young, is an experienced hunter and backwoodsman, and I have not
much fear for his personal safety. He assured me that, should
he find the Indians above ravaging the country as fearfully as
reported, he would immediately return to us."</p>

<p>"I hope so," earnestly replied Rosalind.</p>

<p>"Still," continued George, "what can we do, even then? He intends
to bring a hunter back with him, and that will make only three
of us against perhaps a thousand savages."</p>

<p>"But have we not the house to protect us?"</p>

<p>"And have they not the forest? Can they not lurk around until
we die of hunger, or until they fire the building? There are a
hundred contingencies that will bar an escape, while I confess
no prospect of getting safely away presents itself."</p>

<p>"We have arms and ammunition," said Rosalind. "Of course Leslie
and his friend are good marksmen, and why can we not do enough
to deter and intimidate the savages? Finding us well prepared,
they will doubtless retreat and not disturb us again. I hope the
trouble will soon be over."</p>

<p>"I <em>hope</em> so too; but it is hoping against hope. This
war will be a long and bloody one, and when it is over the country
will present a different appearance. Many lives must be lost ere
it is done, and perhaps ours are among that number."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, brother; but do not be so depressed. Let us hope
and pray for the best. It is not such a sad thing to die, and
the country which has given us birth has certainly a strong claim
upon us."</p>

<p>"Noble girl," exclaimed George, "it is so, and we have no cause
for murmuring."</p>

<p>At this moment Zeb appeared. He was a short, dumpy, thick-set
negro, with a most luxuriant head of wool, a portion of which
hung around his head in small, close braids, resembling bits of
decayed rope. His eyes were large and protruding, and his face
glistened like a mirror. He was a genuine African. Some of their
qualities in him were carried to the extreme. Instead of being
a coward, as is often the case with his nation, he seemed never
to know when there really was danger. He always was reckless and
careless, and seemed to escape by accident.</p>

<p>"Heigh! massa George, what's up?" he exclaimed, observing the
solemn appearance of the two before him.</p>

<p>"Nothing but what is known to you, Zeb. We were just speaking
of the danger which you are aware is threatening us. Have you
seen anything lately to excite suspicion?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' worth speakin' of," replied he, seating himself in front
of George and Rosalind.</p>

<p>"What was it, Zeb?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>"When I's out tendin' to things, I t'ought as how I'd sit down
and rest, and 'cordin'ly I squats on a big stone. Purty soon de
stone begin to move, and come to look, 'twas a big Injin.</p>

<p>"'Heigh!' says I, 'what you doin' here?'</p>

<p>"'Ugh!' he grunted.</p>

<p>"'Yes, I'll "ugh!" you,' says I, 'if I cotches you here ag'in.'
With dat I pitches him two, free rods off, and tells him to make
tracks fur home."</p>

<p>"Heavens! if you would only tell the truth, Zeb. Did you really
see an Indian, though?"</p>

<p>"'Deed I did, and he run when he see'd me in arnist."</p>

<p>"And you saw others yesterday, did you?" remarked Rosalind.</p>

<p>"Two or free, down toward de woods. I spied 'em crawlin' and
smellin' down dar, and axes dem dar business. Dey said as how
dey's lookin' for a jack-knife dat dey lost dar last summer. I
told 'em dat dey oughter be 'shamed demselves to be smellin' round
dat way; and to provide against dar doin's in future, I give dem
each a good kick and sent dem away."</p>

<p>"Do not exaggerate your story so much," said Rosalind. "Give
the truth and nothing else."</p>

<p>"Qua'r, folks won't believe all dis pusson observes," said he,
with an offended air.</p>

<p>"Tell the truth and they will in all cases; but should you deceive
once, you will always be suspected afterward."</p>

<p>"Dat's it," commenced the negro, spreading out his broad hand
like an orator to illustrate the point. "If I tells de truf dey're
sure to t'ink I's lyin', and what's de use?"</p>

<p>"Zeb," commenced George, not regarding the last remark, "you,
as well as we, are aware that we are encompassed by peril. You
have seen that the Indians are constantly prowling around, and
evidently for no good purpose. What would you advise us to do
under the circumstances?"</p>

<p>"Give 'em all a good floggin' and set 'em to work," he replied.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Zeb, we want no jesting," interrupted Rosalind.</p>

<p>"Dar 'tis ag'in. Who war jestin'? Dat's what I t'ink is de best.
Give 'em a good lickin', and set 'em to work clearin' off de wood
till dar spunk is gone."</p>

<p>"Fudge!" said George, impatiently, turning his back toward Zeb,
whose head ducked down with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Rosalind," said George, "the best plan is certainly to wait
until Leslie returns, which will be either to-morrow or the next
day. We will then determine upon what course to pursue. Perhaps
we shall be undisturbed until that time. If not, it cannot be
helped."</p>

<p>"Wished dis pusson warn't so hungry," remarked Zeb, picking up
a stick and whittling it.</p>

<p>Rosalind smiled as she arose and remarked:</p>

<p>"It is getting late, George, and it perhaps is best to have supper."</p>

<p>He made no answer and turned toward the negro.</p>

<p>"Zeb," said he, "in all probability we shall be obliged to leave
this place in a few days for a safer location. Of course you will
accompany us, and I wish it to be understood that you are to lay
aside this levity and carelessness. Remember that you are in danger,
as much as ourselves. Your scalp may be the first taken."</p>

<p>"What, dis yere wool of mine? Yah! yah! yah! Lord bless you,
dey'd have a handful!"</p>

<p>"How would you relish being roasted at the stake?" asked George,
hoping to terrify him.</p>

<p>"Yah! yah! Dey'd be some sizzlin', I guess."</p>

<p>"You will think soberly about the matter, perhaps sooner than
you suspect."</p>

<p>"Yas," said Zeb, and his face straightened out in an instant,
while he slowly and thoughtfully continued whittling.</p>

<p>"Zeb," continued George, leaning toward him and speaking in an
undertone, "I think we shall be attacked in two days at the latest."</p>

<p>"Jest keep de whip in good order, and I'll put it into 'em and
teach 'em manners."</p>

<p>"I fear you will learn wisdom only by experience, even if you
do then," returned George. "It would be a good thing for you,
should you meet with something that would impress you with a sense
of your peril. I can only wonder at your stupidity."</p>

<p>"Gorra mighty! do you s'pose dere's anything that'd make <em>me</em>
afeard of dem Injins? Why, bless you, forty of 'em wouldn't dare
to frow a stone at me. I've licked free, four dozen of 'em, and
dey all respect me awful."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," rejoined young Leland, with mock seriousness.</p>

<p>"Last summer," pursued Zeb, "when you's down de river fishin',
dere's thirteen of 'em come up one day to borrer de wood-box.
I s'pose dey wanted to keep dar dogs and pappooses in it, and
I 'cluded as how dey warn't gwine to get it. So I told 'em I's
very sorry dat I couldn't 'commodate 'em, but de fact war we wanted
to put de wood in it ourselves. When I said dat, one of de niggers
begin to got sassy. I just informed 'em dat dey'd better make
demselves scarce mighty quick, if dey didn't want dis pusson in
dar wool. Dey didn't mind what was said, howsumever, and purty
soon I cotched 'em runnin' off wid de wood-box. Dat raised my
dander, and I grabbed de box and frowed it right over dar heads
and cotched 'em fast. Den I put a big stone on it, and kept 'em
dere free weeks, and afore I let 'em out I made 'em promise to
behave 'emselves. Now I considers dat we'd better serve 'em some
sich trick. Tie two, free hundred to de fence, and leave 'em dere
for a few months."</p>

<p>"You are welcome to try it," returned George, rather disgusted
at the negro's propensity for big story telling. He arose and
passed within, where the ample table was laid. Yet he could not
eat the plain, sweet food which Rosalind's own hands had prepared.
The dreadful sense of danger was too real a guest for any rest
or peace of mind.</p>
