<p>It was not long before Frisky Squirrel began to see that he had got
himself into something very like a fix. It had been fairly easy to
dodge Mr. Hawk alone. But things were quite different now. Mr. Hawk
would come hurtling down upon him from one direction; and Mrs. Hawk
would swoop down upon him from another. It was all very confusing,
because Frisky could not watch both of them at once.
</p>
<p>He called to his mother, because he began to be frightened. But Mrs.
Squirrel was not at home. Frisky did not know what to do. He tried to
reach his home in the big hickory tree near-by; but Mr. and Mrs. Hawk
wouldn't let him go near it. And when he felt one of Mr. Hawk's sharp
talons dig into his back Frisky thought that his end had come. But he
escaped that time, though Mrs. Hawk nearly caught him just two seconds
later.
</p><p>I am afraid <u>The Tale of Frisky Squirrel</u> would have ended right here,
if somebody had not come to Frisky's help. Fortunately, there was a
small, olive-green bird who lived with his wife not far from Frisky
Squirrel's home. Mr. Kinglet was his name. And though he was a tiny
fellow he had a heart like a lion's. I suppose that in all the country
around Blue Mountain there was no braver fellow than he. And his wife
was brave too. Although they both wore very dull-colored clothes, if
you took a good look at Mr. Kinglet you could see that he always wore
a bright red crown. He was very modest about his crown, and generally
wore it so that only a little of it showed. But whenever he went out
to fight, as the forest-people are often obliged to, that beautiful
red crown might be seen as plain as could be.
</p><p>Now, it happened that Mrs. Kinglet heard Mr. and Mrs. Hawk talking to
each other, as they tried to capture Frisky Squirrel, and she heard
the other forest-people shouting, too. So she called to Mr. Kinglet
that somebody seemed to be in trouble; and he came hurrying up at
once.
</p><p>When the little frightened wren screamed, Mr. Kinglet made up his mind
that it was time for him to do something. And he pushed his red crown
up on the top of his head where it would show better and he flew
straight toward Mr. Hawk.
</p><p>Mr. Kinglet flew up over Mr. Hawk's head, and then he darted down and
lighted right in the middle of Mr. Hawk's broad back, and began
pecking him as hard as he could with his sharp little bill.
</p><p>Mr. Hawk stopped trying to catch Frisky. He had all he wanted to do to
shake that bold little fellow off his back. And though Mrs. Hawk still
swooped down at Frisky Squirrel, brave Mr. Kinglet's brave little wife
began to fly at <u>her</u> so fiercely that Mrs. Hawk couldn't keep Frisky
from reaching the tree where he lived.
</p><p>He was very glad to get home, you may be sure. And he dived in through
the door and was out of sight in no time. But pretty soon he stuck his
head out again to see what was happening. Mr. and Mrs. Hawk had
vanished. And all the forest-people were thanking Mr. and Mrs. Kinglet
for driving them away. Frisky Squirrel thanked them, too. And when he
remembered how he had sometimes teased Mrs. Kinglet by visiting her
nest he felt very much ashamed, and he promised himself that he would
never trouble her again.
