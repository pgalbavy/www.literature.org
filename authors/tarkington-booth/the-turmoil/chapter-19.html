<p>He emerged only upon a second summons to dinner, two hours later,
and came to the table so white and silent that his wife made her
anxiety manifest and was but partially reassured by his explanation
that his lunch had "disagreed" with him a little.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he spoke effectively. Bibbs, whose appetite
had become hearty, was helping himself to a second breast of capon
from white-jacket's salver. "Here's another difference between
Midas and chicken," Sheridan remarked, grimly. "Midas can eat
rooster, but rooster can't eat Midas. I reckon you overlooked
that. Midas looks to me like he had the advantage there."</p>

<p>Bibbs retained enough presence of mind to transfer the capon
breast to his plate without dropping it and to respond, "Yes&mdash;he
crows over it."</p>

<p>Having returned his antagonists's fire in this fashion, he blushed&mdash;for
he could blush distinctly now&mdash;and his mother looked upon him
with pleasure, thought the reference to Midas and roosters was
of course jargon to her. "Did you ever see anybody improve the
way that child has!" she exclaimed. "I declare, Bibbs, sometimes
lately you look right handsome!"</p>

<p>"He's got to be such a gadabout," Edith giggled.</p>

<p>"I found something of his on the floor up-stairs this morning,
before anybody was up," said Sheridan. "I reckon if people lose
things in this house and expect to get 'em back, they better get
up as soon as I do."</p>

<p>"What was it he lost?" asked Edith.</p>

<p>"He knows!" her father returned. "Seems to me like I forgot to
bring it home with me. I looked it over&mdash;thought probably it was
something pretty important, belongin' to a busy man like him."
He affected to search his pockets. "What <em>DID I </em>do with
it, now? Oh yes! Seems to me like I remember leavin' it down at
the office&mdash;in the waste-basket."</p>

<p>"Good place for it," Bibbs murmured, still red.</p>

<p>Sheridan gave him a grin. "Perhaps pretty soon you'll be gettin'
up early enough to find things before I do!"</p>

<p>It was a threat, and Bibbs repeated the substance of it, later
in the evening, to Mary Vertrees&mdash;they had come to know each other
that well.</p>

<p>"My time's here at last," he said, as they sat together in the
melancholy gas-light of the room which had been denuded of its
piano. That removal had left an emptiness so distressing to Mr.
and Mrs. Vertrees that neither of them had crossed the threshold
since the dark day; but the gas-light, though from a single jet,
shed no melancholy upon Bibbs, nor could any room seem bare that
knew the glowing presence of Mary. He spoke lightly, not sadly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's come. I've shirked and put off, but I can't shirk
and put off any longer. It's really my part to go to him&mdash;at least
it would save my face. He means what he says, and the time's come
to serve my sentence. Hard labor for life, I think."</p>

<p>Mary shook her head. "I don't think so. He's too kind."</p>

<p>"You think my father's <em>KIND?" </em>And Bibbs stared at her.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm sure of it. I've felt that he has a great, brave heart.
It's only that he has to be kind in his own way&mdash;because he can't
understand any other way."</p>

<p>"Ah yes," said Bibbs. "If that's what you mean by 'kind'!"</p>

<p>She looked at him gravely, earnest concern in her friendly eyes.
"It's going to be pretty hard for you, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;self-pity!" he returned, smiling. "This has been just the
last flicker of revolt. Nobody minds work if he likes the kind
of work. There'd be no loafers in the world if each man found
the thing that he could do best; but the only work I happen to
want to do is useless&mdash;so I have to give it up. To-morrow I'll
be a day-laborer."</p>

<p>"What is it like&mdash;exactly?"</p>

<p>"I get up at six," he said. "I have a lunch-basket to carry with
me, which is aristocratic and no advantage. The other workmen
have tin buckets, and tin buckets are better. I leave the house
at six-thirty, and I'm at work in my overalls at seven. I have
an hour off at noon, and work again from one till five."</p>

<p>"But the work itself?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't muscularly exhausting&mdash;not at all. They couldn't give
me a heavier job because I wasn't good enough."</p>

<p>"But what will you do? I want to know."</p>

<p>"When I left," said Bibbs, "I was 'on' what they call over there
a 'clipping-machine,' in one of the 'by-products' departments,
and that's what I'll be sent back to."</p>

<p>"But what is it?" she insisted.</p>

<p>Bibbs explained. "It's very simple and very easy. I feed long
strips of zinc into a pair of steel jaws, and the jaws bite the
zinc into little circles. All I have to do is to see that the
strip goes into the jaws at a certain angle&mdash;and yet I was a very
bad hand at it."</p>

<p>He had kept his voice cheerful as he spoke, but he had grown
a shade paler, and there was a latent anguish deep in his eyes.
He may have known it and wished her not to see it, for he turned
away.</p>

<p>"You do that all day long?" she asked, and as he nodded, "It
seems incredible!" she exclaimed. "<em>YOU </em>feeding a strip
of zinc into a machine nine hours a day! No wonder&mdash;" She broke
off, and then, after a keen glance at his face, she said: "I should
think you <em>WOULD </em>have been a 'bad hand at it'!"</p>

<p>He laughed ruefully. "I think it's the noise, though I'm ashamed
to say it. You see, it's a very powerful machine, and there's
a sort of rhythmical crashing&mdash;a crash every time the jaws bite
off a circle."</p>

<p>"How often is that?"</p>

<p>"The thing should make about sixty-eight disks a minute&mdash;a little
more than one a second."</p>

<p>"And you're close to it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the workman has to sit in its lap," he said, turning to
her more gaily. "The others don't mind. You see, it's something
wrong with me. I have an idiotic way of flinching from the confounded
thing &mdash;I flinch and duck a little every time the crash comes,
and I couldn't get over it. I was a treat to the other workmen
in that room; they'll be glad to see me back. They used to laugh
at me all day long."</p>

<p>Mary's gaze was averted from Bibbs now; she sat with her elbow
resting on the arm of the chair, her lifted hand pressed against
her cheek. She was staring at the wall, and her eyes had a burning
brightness in them.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem possible any one could do that to you," she
said, in a low voice. "No. He's not kind. He ought to be proud
to help you to the leisure to write books; it should be his greatest
privilege to have them published for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't you <em>SEE </em>him?" Bibbs interrupted, a faint ripple
of hilarity in his voice. "If he could understand what you're
saying&mdash;and if you can imagine his taking such a notion, he'd
have had R. T. Bloss put up posters all over the country: 'Read
B. Sheridan. Read the Poet with a Punch!' No. It's just as well
he never got the &mdash;But what's the use? I've never written
anything worth printing, and I never shall."</p>

<p>"You could!" she said.</p>

<p>"That's because you've never seen the poor little things I've
tried to do."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't let me, but I <em>KNOW </em>you could! Ah, it's
a pity!"</p>

<p>"It isn't," said <em>BIBBS, </em>honestly. "I never could&mdash;but
you're the kindest lady in this world, Miss Vertrees."</p>

<p>She gave him a flashing glance, and it was as kind as he said
she was. "That sounds wrong," she said, impulsively. "I mean 'Miss
Vertrees.' I've thought of you by your first name ever since I
met you. Wouldn't you rather call me 'Mary'?"</p>

<p>Bibbs was dazzled; he drew a long, deep breath and did not speak.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you?" she asked, without a trace of coquetry.</p>

<p>"If I <em>CAN!" </em>he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's very pretty!" she laughed. "You're such an honest
person, it's pleasant to have you gallant sometimes, by way of
variety." She became grave again immediately. "I hear myself laughing
as if it were some one else. It sounds like laughter on the eve
of a great calamity."  She got up restlessly, crossed the room
and leaned against the wall, facing him. "You've <em>GOT </em>to
go back to that place?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"And the other time you did it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just over it," said Bibbs. "Two years. But I don't mind the
prospect of a repetition so much as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So much as what?" she prompted, as he stopped.</p>

<p>Bibbs looked up at her shyly. "I want to say it, but&mdash;but I come
to a dead balk when I try. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on. Say it, whatever it is," she bade him. "You wouldn't
know how to say anything I shouldn't like."</p>

<p>"I doubt if you'd either like or dislike what I want to say,"
he returned, moving uncomfortably in his chair and looking at
his feet&mdash;he seemed to feel awkward, thoroughly. "You see, all
my life&mdash;until I met you&mdash;if I ever felt like saying anything,
I wrote it instead. Saying things is a new trick for me, and this&mdash;well,
it's just this: I used to feel as if I hadn't ever had any sort
of a life at all. I'd never been of use to anything or anybody,
and I'd never had anything, myself, except a kind of haphazard
thinking. But now it's different &mdash;I'm still of no use to
anybody, and I don't see any prospect of being useful, but I have
had something for myself. I've had a beautiful and happy experience,
and it makes my life seem to be &mdash;I mean I'm glad I've lived
it! That's all; it's your letting me be near you sometimes, as
you have, this strange, beautiful, happy little while!"</p>

<p>He did not once look up, and reached silence, at the end of what
he had to say, with his eyes still awkwardly regarding his feet.
She did not speak, but a soft rustling of her garments let him
know that she had gone back to her chair again. The house was
still; the shabby old room was so quiet that the sound of a creaking
in the wall seemed sharp and loud.</p>

<p>And yet, when Mary spoke at last, her voice was barely audible.
"If you think it has been&mdash;happy&mdash;to be friends with me&mdash;you'd
want to&mdash;to make it last."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bibbs, as faintly.</p>

<p>"You'd want to go on being my friend as long as we live, wouldn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he gulped.</p>

<p>"But you make that kind of speech to me because you think it's
over."</p>

<p>He tried to evade her. "Oh, a day-laborer can't come in his overalls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," she interrupted, with a sudden sharpness. "You said what
you did because you think the shop's going to kill you."</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you do think that!" She rose to her feet again and came
and stood before him. "Or you think it's going to send you back
to the sanitarium. Don't deny it, Bibbs. There! See how easily
I call you that! You see I'm a friend, or I couldn't do it. Well,
if you meant what you said&mdash;and you did mean it, I know it!&mdash;you're
not going to go back to the sanitarium. The shop sha'n't hurt
you. It sha'n't!"</p>

<p>And now Bibbs looked up. She stood before him, straight and tall,
splendid in generous strength, her eyes shining and wet.</p>

<p>"If I mean <em>THAT </em>much to you," she cried, "they can't
harm you! Go back to the shop&mdash;but come to me when your day's
work is done. Let the machines crash their sixty-eight times a
minute, but remember each crash that deafens you is that much
nearer the evening and me!"</p>

<p>He stumbled to his feet. "You say&mdash;" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Every evening, dear Bibbs!"</p>

<p>He could only stare, bewildered.</p>

<p>"<em>EVERY </em>evening. I want you. They sha'n't hurt you again!"
And she held out her hand to him; it was strong and warm in his
tremulous clasp. "If I could, I'd go and feed the strips of zinc
to the machine with you,"  she said. "But all day long I'll send
my thoughts to you. You must keep remembering that your friend
stands beside you. And when the work is done&mdash;won't the night
make up for the day?"</p>

<p>Light seemed to glow from her; he was blinded by that radiance
of kindness. But all he could say was, huskily, "To think you're
there&mdash;with me&mdash;standing beside the old zinc-eater&mdash;"</p>

<p>And they laughed and looked at each other, and at last Bibbs
found what it meant not to be alone in the world. He had a friend.</p>
