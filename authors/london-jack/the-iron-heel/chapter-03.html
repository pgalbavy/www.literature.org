Little did I dream the fateful part Jackson's arm was to play in my
life.  Jackson himself did not impress me when I hunted him out.  I
found him in a crazy, ramshackle* house down near the bay on the
edge of the marsh.  Pools of stagnant water stood around the house,
their surfaces covered with a green and putrid-looking scum, while
the stench that arose from them was intolerable.
<P>
<P>
* An adjective descriptive of ruined and dilapidated houses in
which great numbers of the working people found shelter in those
days.  They invariably paid rent, and, considering the value of
such houses, enormous rent, to the landlords.
<P>
<P>
I found Jackson the meek and lowly man he had been described.  He
was making some sort of rattan-work, and he toiled on stolidly
while I talked with him.  But in spite of his meekness and
lowliness, I fancied I caught the first note of a nascent
bitterness in him when he said:
<P>
"They might a-given me a job as watchman,* anyway."
<P>
<P>
* In those days thievery was incredibly prevalent.  Everybody stole
property from everybody else.  The lords of society stole legally
or else legalized their stealing, while the poorer classes stole
illegally.  Nothing was safe unless guarded.  Enormous numbers of
men were employed as watchmen to protect property.  The houses of
the well-to-do were a combination of safe deposit vault and
fortress.  The appropriation of the personal belongings of others
by our own children of to-day is looked upon as a rudimentary
survival of the theft-characteristic that in those early times was
universal.
<P>
<P>
I got little out of him.  He struck me as stupid, and yet the
deftness with which he worked with his one hand seemed to belie his
stupidity.  This suggested an idea to me.
<P>
"How did you happen to get your arm caught in the machine?" I
asked.
<P>
He looked at me in a slow and pondering way, and shook his head.
"I don't know.  It just happened."
<P>
"Carelessness?" I prompted.
<P>
"No," he answered, "I ain't for callin' it that.  I was workin'
overtime, an' I guess I was tired out some.  I worked seventeen
years in them mills, an' I've took notice that most of the
accidents happens just before whistle-blow.*  I'm willin' to bet
that more accidents happens in the hour before whistle-blow than in
all the rest of the day.  A man ain't so quick after workin' steady
for hours.  I've seen too many of 'em cut up an' gouged an' chawed
not to know."
<P>
<P>
* The laborers were called to work and dismissed by savage,
screaming, nerve-racking steam-whistles.
<P>
<P>
"Many of them?" I queried.
<P>
"Hundreds an' hundreds, an' children, too."
<P>
With the exception of the terrible details, Jackson's story of his
accident was the same as that I had already heard.  When I asked
him if he had broken some rule of working the machinery, he shook
his head.
<P>
"I chucked off the belt with my right hand," he said, "an' made a
reach for the flint with my left.  I didn't stop to see if the belt
was off.  I thought my right hand had done it--only it didn't.  I
reached quick, and the belt wasn't all the way off.  And then my
arm was chewed off."
<P>
"It must have been painful," I said sympathetically.
<P>
"The crunchin' of the bones wasn't nice," was his answer.
<P>
His mind was rather hazy concerning the damage suit.  Only one
thing was clear to him, and that was that he had not got any
damages.  He had a feeling that the testimony of the foremen and
the superintendent had brought about the adverse decision of the
court.  Their testimony, as he put it, "wasn't what it ought to
have ben."  And to them I resolved to go.
<P>
One thing was plain, Jackson's situation was wretched.  His wife
was in ill health, and he was unable to earn, by his rattan-work
and peddling, sufficient food for the family.  He was back in his
rent, and the oldest boy, a lad of eleven, had started to work in
the mills.
<P>
"They might a-given me that watchman's job," were his last words as
I went away.
<P>
By the time I had seen the lawyer who had handled Jackson's case,
and the two foremen and the superintendent at the mills who had
testified, I began to feel that there was something after all in
Ernest's contention.
<P>
He was a weak and inefficient-looking man, the lawyer, and at sight
of him I did not wonder that Jackson's case had been lost.  My
first thought was that it had served Jackson right for getting such
a lawyer.  But the next moment two of Ernest's statements came
flashing into my consciousness: "The company employs very efficient
lawyers" and "Colonel Ingram is a shrewd lawyer."  I did some rapid
thinking.  It dawned upon me that of course the company could
afford finer legal talent than could a workingman like Jackson.
But this was merely a minor detail.  There was some very good
reason, I was sure, why Jackson's case had gone against him.
<P>
"Why did you lose the case?" I asked.
<P>
The lawyer was perplexed and worried for a moment, and I found it
in my heart to pity the wretched little creature.  Then he began to
whine.  I do believe his whine was congenital.  He was a man beaten
at birth.  He whined about the testimony.  The witnesses had given
only the evidence that helped the other side.  Not one word could
he get out of them that would have helped Jackson.  They knew which
side their bread was buttered on.  Jackson was a fool.  He had been
brow-beaten and confused by Colonel Ingram.  Colonel Ingram was
brilliant at cross-examination.  He had made Jackson answer
damaging questions.
<P>
"How could his answers be damaging if he had the right on his
side?" I demanded.
<P>
"What's right got to do with it?" he demanded back.  "You see all
those books."  He moved his hand over the array of volumes on the
walls of his tiny office.  "All my reading and studying of them has
taught me that law is one thing and right is another thing.  Ask
any lawyer.  You go to Sunday-school to learn what is right.  But
you go to those books to learn . . . law."
<P>
"Do you mean to tell me that Jackson had the right on his side and
yet was beaten?" I queried tentatively.  "Do you mean to tell me
that there is no justice in Judge Caldwell's court?"
<P>
The little lawyer glared at me a moment, and then the belligerence
faded out of his face.
<P>
"I hadn't a fair chance," he began whining again.  "They made a
fool out of Jackson and out of me, too.  What chance had I?
Colonel Ingram is a great lawyer.  If he wasn't great, would he
have charge of the law business of the Sierra Mills, of the Erston
Land Syndicate, of the Berkeley Consolidated, of the Oakland, San
Leandro, and Pleasanton Electric?  He's a corporation lawyer, and
corporation lawyers are not paid for being fools.*  What do you
think the Sierra Mills alone give him twenty thousand dollars a
year for?  Because he's worth twenty thousand dollars a year to
them, that's what for.  I'm not worth that much.  If I was, I
wouldn't be on the outside, starving and taking cases like
Jackson's.  What do you think I'd have got if I'd won Jackson's
case?"
<P>
<P>
* The function of the corporation lawyer was to serve, by corrupt
methods, the money-grabbing propensities of the corporations.  It
is on record that Theodore Roosevelt, at that time President of the
United States, said in 1905 A.D., in his address at Harvard
Commencement: "We all know that, as things actually are, many of
the most influential and most highly remunerated members of the Bar
in every centre of wealth, make it their special task to work out
bold and ingenious schemes by which their wealthy clients,
individual or corporate, can evade the laws which were made to
regulate, in the interests of the public, the uses of great
wealth."
<P>
<P>
"You'd have robbed him, most probably," I answered.
<P>
"Of course I would," he cried angrily.  "I've got to live, haven't
I?"*
<P>
<P>
* A typical illustration of the internecine strife that permeated
all society.  Men preyed upon one another like ravening wolves.
The big wolves ate the little wolves, and in the social pack
Jackson was one of the least of the little wolves.
<P>
<P>
"He has a wife and children," I chided.
<P>
"So have I a wife and children," he retorted.  "And there's not a
soul in this world except myself that cares whether they starve or
not."
<P>
His face suddenly softened, and he opened his watch and showed me a
small photograph of a woman and two little girls pasted inside the
case.
<P>
"There they are.  Look at them.  We've had a hard time, a hard
time.  I had hoped to send them away to the country if I'd won
Jackson's case.  They're not healthy here, but I can't afford to
send them away."
<P>
When I started to leave, he dropped back into his whine.
<P>
"I hadn't the ghost of a chance.  Colonel Ingram and Judge Caldwell
are pretty friendly.  I'm not saying that if I'd got the right kind
of testimony out of their witnesses on cross-examination, that
friendship would have decided the case.  And yet I must say that
Judge Caldwell did a whole lot to prevent my getting that very
testimony.  Why, Judge Caldwell and Colonel Ingram belong to the
same lodge and the same club.  They live in the same neighborhood--
one I can't afford.  And their wives are always in and out of each
other's houses.  They're always having whist parties and such
things back and forth."
<P>
"And yet you think Jackson had the right of it?" I asked, pausing
for the moment on the threshold.
<P>
"I don't think; I know it," was his answer.  "And at first I
thought he had some show, too.  But I didn't tell my wife.  I
didn't want to disappoint her.  She had her heart set on a trip to
the country hard enough as it was."
<P>
"Why did you not call attention to the fact that Jackson was trying
to save the machinery from being injured?" I asked Peter Donnelly,
one of the foremen who had testified at the trial.
<P>
He pondered a long time before replying.  Then he cast an anxious
look about him and said:
<P>
"Because I've a good wife an' three of the sweetest children ye
ever laid eyes on, that's why."
<P>
"I do not understand," I said.
<P>
"In other words, because it wouldn't a-ben healthy," he answered.
<P>
"You mean--" I began.
<P>
But he interrupted passionately.
<P>
"I mean what I said.  It's long years I've worked in the mills.
I began as a little lad on the spindles.  I worked up ever since.
It's by hard work I got to my present exalted position.  I'm a
foreman, if you please.  An' I doubt me if there's a man in the
mills that'd put out a hand to drag me from drownin'.  I used to
belong to the union.  But I've stayed by the company through two
strikes.  They called me 'scab.'  There's not a man among 'em to-
day to take a drink with me if I asked him.  D'ye see the scars on
me head where I was struck with flying bricks?  There ain't a child
at the spindles but what would curse me name.  Me only friend is
the company.  It's not me duty, but me bread an' butter an' the
life of me children to stand by the mills.  That's why."
<P>
"Was Jackson to blame?" I asked.
<P>
"He should a-got the damages.  He was a good worker an' never made
trouble."
<P>
"Then you were not at liberty to tell the whole truth, as you had
sworn to do?"
<P>
He shook his head.
<P>
"The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?" I said
solemnly.
<P>
Again his face became impassioned, and he lifted it, not to me, but
to heaven.
<P>
"I'd let me soul an' body burn in everlastin' hell for them
children of mine," was his answer.
<P>
Henry Dallas, the superintendent, was a vulpine-faced creature who
regarded me insolently and refused to talk.  Not a word could I get
from him concerning the trial and his testimony.  But with the
other foreman I had better luck.  James Smith was a hard-faced man,
and my heart sank as I encountered him.  He, too, gave me the
impression that he was not a free agent, as we talked I began to
see that he was mentally superior to the average of his kind.  He
agreed with Peter Donnelly that Jackson should have got damages,
and he went farther and called the action heartless and cold-
blooded that had turned the worker adrift after he had been made
helpless by the accident.  Also, he explained that there were many
accidents in the mills, and that the company's policy was to fight
to the bitter end all consequent damage suits.
<P>
"It means hundreds of thousands a year to the stockholders," he
said; and as he spoke I remembered the last dividend that had been
paid my father, and the pretty gown for me and the books for him
that had been bought out of that dividend.  I remembered Ernest's
charge that my gown was stained with blood, and my flesh began to
crawl underneath my garments.
<P>
"When you testified at the trial, you didn't point out that Jackson
received his accident through trying to save the machinery from
damage?" I said.
<P>
"No, I did not," was the answer, and his mouth set bitterly.  "I
testified to the effect that Jackson injured himself by neglect and
carelessness, and that the company was not in any way to blame or
liable."
<P>
"Was it carelessness?" I asked.
<P>
"Call it that, or anything you want to call it.  The fact is, a man
gets tired after he's been working for hours."
<P>
I was becoming interested in the man.  He certainly was of a
superior kind.
<P>
"You are better educated than most workingmen," I said.
<P>
"I went through high school," he replied.  "I worked my way through
doing janitor-work.  I wanted to go through the university.  But my
father died, and I came to work in the mills.
<P>
"I wanted to become a naturalist," he explained shyly, as though
confessing a weakness.  "I love animals.  But I came to work in the
mills.  When I was promoted to foreman I got married, then the
family came, and . . . well, I wasn't my own boss any more."
<P>
"What do you mean by that?" I asked.
<P>
"I was explaining why I testified at the trial the way I did--why I
followed instructions."
<P>
"Whose instructions?"
<P>
"Colonel Ingram.  He outlined the evidence I was to give."
<P>
"And it lost Jackson's case for him."
<P>
He nodded, and the blood began to rise darkly in his face.
<P>
"And Jackson had a wife and two children dependent on him."
<P>
"I know," he said quietly, though his face was growing darker.
<P>
"Tell me," I went on, "was it easy to make yourself over from what
you were, say in high school, to the man you must have become to do
such a thing at the trial?"
<P>
The suddenness of his outburst startled and frightened me.  He
ripped* out a savage oath, and clenched his fist as though about to
strike me.
<P>
<P>
* It is interesting to note the virilities of language that were
common speech in that day, as indicative of the life, 'red of claw
and fang,' that was then lived.  Reference is here made, of course,
not to the oath of Smith, but to the verb ripped used by Avis
Everhard.
<P>
<P>
"I beg your pardon," he said the next moment.  "No, it was not
easy.  And now I guess you can go away.  You've got all you wanted
out of me.  But let me tell you this before you go.  It won't do
you any good to repeat anything I've said.  I'll deny it, and there
are no witnesses.  I'll deny every word of it; and if I have to,
I'll do it under oath on the witness stand."
<P>
After my interview with Smith I went to my father's office in the
Chemistry Building and there encountered Ernest.  It was quite
unexpected, but he met me with his bold eyes and firm hand-clasp,
and with that curious blend of his awkwardness and ease.  It was as
though our last stormy meeting was forgotten; but I was not in the
mood to have it forgotten.
<P>
"I have been looking up Jackson's case," I said abruptly.
<P>
He was all interested attention, and waited for me to go on, though
I could see in his eyes the certitude that my convictions had been
shaken.
<P>
"He seems to have been badly treated," I confessed.  "I--I--think
some of his blood is dripping from our roof-beams."
<P>
"Of course," he answered.  "If Jackson and all his fellows were
treated mercifully, the dividends would not be so large."
<P>
"I shall never be able to take pleasure in pretty gowns again," I
added.
<P>
I felt humble and contrite, and was aware of a sweet feeling that
Ernest was a sort of father confessor.  Then, as ever after, his
strength appealed to me.  It seemed to radiate a promise of peace
and protection.
<P>
"Nor will you be able to take pleasure in sackcloth," he said
gravely.  "There are the jute mills, you know, and the same thing
goes on there.  It goes on everywhere.  Our boasted civilization is
based upon blood, soaked in blood, and neither you nor I nor any of
us can escape the scarlet stain.  The men you talked with--who were
they?"
<P>
I told him all that had taken place.
<P>
"And not one of them was a free agent," he said.  "They were all
tied to the merciless industrial machine.  And the pathos of it and
the tragedy is that they are tied by their heartstrings.  Their
children--always the young life that it is their instinct to
protect.  This instinct is stronger than any ethic they possess.
My father!  He lied, he stole, he did all sorts of dishonorable
things to put bread into my mouth and into the mouths of my
brothers and sisters.  He was a slave to the industrial machine,
and it stamped his life out, worked him to death."
<P>
"But you," I interjected.  "You are surely a free agent."
<P>
"Not wholly," he replied.  "I am not tied by my heartstrings.  I am
often thankful that I have no children, and I dearly love children.
Yet if I married I should not dare to have any."
<P>
"That surely is bad doctrine," I cried.
<P>
"I know it is," he said sadly.  "But it is expedient doctrine.  I
am a revolutionist, and it is a perilous vocation."
<P>
I laughed incredulously.
<P>
"If I tried to enter your father's house at night to steal his
dividends from the Sierra Mills, what would he do?"
<P>
"He sleeps with a revolver on the stand by the bed," I answered.
"He would most probably shoot you."
<P>
"And if I and a few others should lead a million and a half of men*
into the houses of all the well-to-do, there would be a great deal
of shooting, wouldn't there?"
<P>
<P>
* This reference is to the socialist vote cast in the United States
in 1910.  The rise of this vote clearly indicates the swift growth
of the party of revolution.  Its voting strength in the United
States in 1888 was 2068; in 1902, 127,713; in 1904, 435,040; in
1908, 1,108,427; and in 1910, 1,688,211.
<P>
<P>
"Yes, but you are not doing that," I objected.
<P>
"It is precisely what I am doing.  And we intend to take, not the
mere wealth in the houses, but all the sources of that wealth, all
the mines, and railroads, and factories, and banks, and stores.
That is the revolution.  It is truly perilous.  There will be more
shooting, I am afraid, than even I dream of.  But as I was saying,
no one to-day is a free agent.  We are all caught up in the wheels
and cogs of the industrial machine.  You found that you were, and
that the men you talked with were.  Talk with more of them.  Go and
see Colonel Ingram.  Look up the reporters that kept Jackson's case
out of the papers, and the editors that run the papers.  You will
find them all slaves of the machine."
<P>
A little later in our conversation I asked him a simple little
question about the liability of workingmen to accidents, and
received a statistical lecture in return.
<P>
"It is all in the books," he said.  "The figures have been
gathered, and it has been proved conclusively that accidents rarely
occur in the first hours of the morning work, but that they
increase rapidly in the succeeding hours as the workers grow tired
and slower in both their muscular and mental processes.
<P>
"Why, do you know that your father has three times as many chances
for safety of life and limb than has a working-man?  He has.  The
insurance* companies know.  They will charge him four dollars and
twenty cents a year on a thousand-dollar accident policy, and for
the same policy they will charge a laborer fifteen dollars."
<P>
<P>
* In the terrible wolf-struggle of those centuries, no man was
permanently safe, no matter how much wealth he amassed.  Out of
fear for the welfare of their families, men devised the scheme of
insurance.  To us, in this intelligent age, such a device is
laughably absurd and primitive.  But in that age insurance was a
very serious matter.  The amusing part of it is that the funds of
the insurance companies were frequently plundered and wasted by the
very officials who were intrusted with the management of them.
<P>
<P>
"And you?" I asked; and in the moment of asking I was aware of a
solicitude that was something more than slight.
<P>
"Oh, as a revolutionist, I have about eight chances to the
workingman's one of being injured or killed," he answered
carelessly.  "The insurance companies charge the highly trained
chemists that handle explosives eight times what they charge the
workingmen.  I don't think they'd insure me at all.  Why did you
ask?"
<P>
My eyes fluttered, and I could feel the blood warm in my face.  It
was not that he had caught me in my solicitude, but that I had
caught myself, and in his presence.
<P>
Just then my father came in and began making preparations to depart
with me.  Ernest returned some books he had borrowed, and went away
first.  But just as he was going, he turned and said:
<P>
"Oh, by the way, while you are ruining your own peace of mind and I
am ruining the Bishop's, you'd better look up Mrs. Wickson and Mrs.
Pertonwaithe.  Their husbands, you know, are the two principal
stockholders in the Mills.  Like all the rest of humanity, those
two women are tied to the machine, but they are so tied that they
sit on top of it."
