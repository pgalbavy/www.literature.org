<p>Mr. Dickson McCunn completed the polishing of his smooth cheeks
with the towel, glanced appreciatively at their reflection in
the looking-glass, and then permitted his eyes to stray out of
the window. In the little garden lilacs were budding, and there
was a gold line of daffodils beside the tiny greenhouse. Beyond
the sooty wall a birch flaunted its new tassels, and the jackdaws
were circling about the steeple of the Guthrie Memorial Kirk.
A blackbird whistled from a thorn-bush, and Mr. McCunn was inspired
to follow its example. He began a tolerable version of "Roy's
Wife of Aldivalloch."</p>

<p>He felt singularly light-hearted, and the immediate cause was
his safety razor. A week ago he had bought the thing in a sudden
fit of enterprise, and now he shaved in five minutes, where before
he had taken twenty, and no longer confronted his fellows, at
least one day in three, with a countenance ludicrously mottled
by sticking-plaster. Calculation revealed to him the fact that
in his fifty-five years, having begun to shave at eighteen, he
had wasted three thousand three hundred and seventy hours&mdash;or
one hundred and forty days&mdash;or between four and five months&mdash;by
his neglect of this admirable invention. Now he felt that he had
stolen a march on Time. He had fallen heir, thus late, to a fortune
in unpurchasable leisure.</p>

<p>He began to dress himself in the sombre clothes in which he had
been accustomed for thirty-five years and more to go down to the
shop in Mearns Street. And then a thought came to him which made
him discard the grey-striped trousers, sit down on the edge of
his bed, and muse.</p>

<p>Since Saturday the shop was a thing of the past. On Saturday
at half-past eleven, to the accompaniment of a glass of dubious
sherry, he had completed the arrangements by which the provision
shop in Mearns Street, which had borne so long the legend of D.
McCunn, together with the branches in Crossmyloof and the Shaws,
became the property of a company, yclept the United Supply Stores,
Limited. He had received in payment cash, debentures and preference
shares, and his lawyers and his own acumen had acclaimed the bargain.
But all the week-end he had been a little sad. It was the end
of so old a song, and he knew no other tune to sing. He was comfortably
off, healthy, free from any particular cares in life, but free
too from any particular duties. "Will I be going to turn into
a useless old man?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>But he had woke up this Monday to the sound of the blackbird,
and the world, which had seemed rather empty twelve hours before,
was now brisk and alluring. His prowess in quick shaving assured
him of his youth. "I'm no' that dead old," he observed, as he
sat on the edge of the bed, to his reflection in the big looking-glass.</p>

<p>It was not an old face. The sandy hair was a little thin on the
top and a little grey at the temples, the figure was perhaps a
little too full for youthful elegance, and an athlete would have
censured the neck as too fleshy for perfect health. But the cheeks
were rosy, the skin clear, and the pale eyes singularly childlike.
They were a little weak, those eyes, and had some difficulty in
looking for long at the same object, so that Mr. McCunn did not
stare people in the face, and had, in consequence, at one time
in his career acquired a perfectly undeserved reputation for cunning.
He shaved clean, and looked uncommonly like a wise, plump schoolboy.
As he gazed at his simulacrum he stopped whistling "Roy's Wife"
and let his countenance harden into a noble sternness. Then he
laughed, and observed in the language of his youth that "There
was life in the auld dowg yet." In that moment the soul of Mr.
McCunn conceived the Great Plan.</p>

<p>The first sign of it was that he swept all his business garments
unceremoniously on to the floor. The next that he rootled at the
bottom of a deep drawer and extracted a most disreputable tweed
suit. It had once been what I believe is called a Lovat mixture,
but was now a nondescript sub-fusc, with bright patches of colour
like moss on whinstone. He regarded it lovingly, for it had been
for twenty years his holiday wear, emerging annually for a hallowed
month to be stained with salt and bleached with sun. He put it
on, and stood shrouded in an odour of camphor. A pair of thick
nailed boots and a flannel shirt and collar completed the equipment
of the sportsman. He had another long look at himself in the glass,
and then descended whistling to breakfast. This time the tune
was "Macgregor's Gathering," and the sound of it stirred the grimy
lips of a man outside who was delivering coals&mdash;himself a Macgregor&mdash;to
follow suit. Mr. McCunn was a very fountain of music that morning.</p>

<p>Tibby, the aged maid, had his newspaper and letters waiting by
his plate, and a dish of ham and eggs frizzling near the fire.
He fell to ravenously but still musingly, and he had reached the
stage of scones and jam before he glanced at his correspondence.
There was a letter from his wife now holidaying at the Neuk Hydropathic.
She reported that her health was improving, and that she had met
various people who had known somebody who had known somebody else
whom she had once known herself. Mr. McCunn read the dutiful pages
and smiled. "Mamma's enjoying herself fine," he observed to the
teapot. He knew that for his wife the earthly paradise was a hydropathic,
where she put on her afternoon dress and every jewel she possessed
when she rose in the morning, ate large meals of which the novelty
atoned for the nastiness, and collected an immense casual acquaintance
with whom she discussed ailments, ministers, sudden deaths, and
the intricate genealogies of her class. For his part he rancorously
hated hydropathics, having once spent a black week under the roof
of one in his wife's company. He detested the food, the Turkish
baths (he had a passionate aversion to baring his body before
strangers), the inability to find anything to do and the compulsion
to endless small talk. A thought flitted over his mind which he
was too loyal to formulate. Once he and his wife had had similar
likings, but they had taken different roads since their child
died. Janet! He saw again&mdash;he was never quite free from the sight&mdash;the
solemn little white-frocked girl who had died long ago in the
spring.</p>

<p>It may have been the thought of the Neuk Hydropathic, or more
likely the thin clean scent of the daffodils with which Tibby
had decked the table, but long ere breakfast was finished the
Great Plan had ceased to be an airy vision and become a sober
well-masoned structure. Mr. McCunn &mdash;I may confess it at
the start&mdash;was an incurable romantic.</p>

<p>He had had a humdrum life since the day when he had first entered
his uncle's shop with the hope of some day succeeding that honest
grocer; and his feet had never strayed a yard from his sober rut.
But his mind, like the Dying Gladiator's, had been far away. As
a boy he had voyaged among books, and they had given him a world
where he could shape his career according to his whimsical fancy.
Not that Mr. McCunn was what is known as a great reader. He read
slowly and fastidiously, and sought in literature for one thing
alone. Sir Walter Scott had been his first guide, but he read
the novels not for their insight into human character or for their
historical pageantry, but because they gave him material wherewith
to construct fantastic journeys. It was the same with Dickens.
A lit tavern, a stage-coach, post-horses, the clack of hoofs on
a frosty road, went to his head like wine. He was a Jacobite not
because he had any views on Divine Right, but because he had always
before his eyes a picture of a knot of adventurers in cloaks,
new landed from France, among the western heather.</p>

<p>On this select basis he had built up his small library &mdash;Defoe,
Hakluyt, Hazlitt and the essayists, Boswell, some indifferent
romances and a shelf of spirited poetry. His tastes became known,
and he acquired a reputation for a scholarly habit. He was president
of the Literary Society of the Guthrie Memorial Kirk, and read
to its members a variety of papers full of a gusto which rarely
became critical. He had been three times chairman at Burns Anniversary
dinners, and had delivered orations in eulogy of the national
Bard; not because he greatly admired him&mdash;he thought him rather
vulgar&mdash;but because he took Burns as an emblem of the un-Burns-like
literature which he loved. Mr. McCunn was no scholar and was sublimely
unconscious of background. He grew his flowers in his small garden-plot
oblivious of their origin so long as they gave him the colour
and scent he sought. Scent, I say, for he appreciated more than
the mere picturesque. He had a passion for words and cadences,
and would be haunted for weeks by a cunning phrase, savouring
it as a connoisseur savours a vintage. Wherefore long ago, when
he could ill afford it, he had purchased the Edinburgh <em>Stevenson</em>.
They were the only large books on his shelves, for he had a liking
for small volumes&mdash;things he could stuff into his pocket in that
sudden journey which he loved to contemplate.</p>

<p>Only he had never taken it. The shop had tied him up for eleven
months in the year, and the twelfth had always found him settled
decorously with his wife in some seaside villa. He had not fretted,
for he was content with dreams. He was always a little tired,
too, when the holidays came, and his wife told him he was growing
old. He consoled himself with tags from the more philosophic of
his authors, but he scarcely needed consolation. For he had large
stores of modest contentment.</p>

<p>But now something had happened. A spring morning and a safety
razor had convinced him that he was still young. Since yesterday
he was a man of a large leisure. Providence had done for him what
he would never have done for himself. The rut in which he had
travelled so long had given place to open country. He repeated
to himself one of the quotations with which he had been wont to
stir the literary young men at the Guthrie Memorial Kirk:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"What's a man's age? He must hurry more, that's all;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cram in a day, what his youth took a year to hold:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we mind labour, then only, we're too old&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;What age had Methusalem when he begat Saul?"

</p>
</div>
<p>He would go journeying&mdash;who but he?&mdash;pleasantly.</p>

<p>It sounds a trivial resolve, but it quickened Mr. McCunn to the
depths of his being. A holiday, and alone! On foot, of course,
for he must travel light. He would buckle on a pack after the
approved fashion. He had the very thing in a drawer upstairs,
which he had bought some years ago at a sale. That and a waterproof
and a stick, and his outfit was complete. A book, too, and, as
he lit his first pipe, he considered what it should be. Poetry,
clearly, for it was the Spring, and besides poetry could be got
in pleasantly small bulk. He stood before his bookshelves trying
to select a volume, rejecting one after another as inapposite.
Browning &mdash;Keats, Shelley&mdash;they seemed more suited for the
hearth than for the roadside. He did not want anything Scots,
for he was of opinion that Spring came more richly in England
and that English people had a better notion of it. He was tempted
by the Oxford Anthology, but was deterred by its thickness, for
he did not possess the thin-paper edition. Finally he selected
Izaak Walton. He had never fished in his life, but <em>The Compleat
Angler</em> seemed to fit his mood. It was old and curious and
learned and fragrant with the youth of things. He remembered its
falling cadences, its country songs and wise meditations. Decidedly
it was the right scrip for his pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Characteristically he thought last of where he was to go. Every
bit of the world beyond his front door had its charms to the seeing
eye. There seemed nothing common or unclean that fresh morning.
Even a walk among coal-pits had its attractions.... But since
he had the right to choose, he lingered over it like an epicure.
Not the Highlands, for Spring came late among their sour mosses.
Some place where there were fields and woods and inns, somewhere,
too, within call of the sea. It must not be too remote, for he
had no time to waste on train journeys; nor too near, for he wanted
a countryside untainted. Presently he thought of Carrick. A good
green land, as he remembered it, with purposeful white roads and
public-houses sacred to the memory of Burns; near the hills but
yet lowland, and with a bright sea chafing on its shores. He decided
on Carrick, found a map and planned his journey.</p>

<p>Then he routed out his knapsack, packed it with a modest change
of raiment, and sent out Tibby to buy chocolate and tobacco and
to cash a cheque at the Strathclyde Bank. Till Tibby returned
he occupied himself with delicious dreams.... He saw himself daily
growing browner and leaner, swinging along broad highways or wandering
in bypaths. He pictured his seasons of ease, when he unslung his
pack and smoked in some clump of lilacs by a burnside&mdash;he remembered
a phrase of Stevenson's somewhat like that. He would meet and
talk with all sorts of folk; an exhilarating prospect, for Mr.
McCunn loved his kind. There would be the evening hour before
he reached his inn, when, pleasantly tired, he would top some
ridge and see the welcoming lights of a little town. There would
be the lamp-lit after-supper time when he would read and reflect,
and the start in the gay morning, when tobacco tastes sweetest
and even fifty-five seems young. It would be holiday of the purest,
for no business now tugged at his coat-tails. He was beginning
a new life, he told himself, when he could cultivate the seedling
interests which had withered beneath the far-reaching shade of
the shop. Was ever a man more fortunate or more free?</p>

<p>Tibby was told that he was going off for a week or two. No letters
need be forwarded, for he would be constantly moving, but Mrs.
McCunn at the Neuk Hydropathic would be kept informed of his whereabouts.
Presently he stood on his doorstep, a stocky figure in ancient
tweeds, with a bulging pack slung on his arm, and a stout hazel
stick in his hand. A passer-by would have remarked an elderly
shopkeeper bent apparently on a day in the country, a common little
man on a prosaic errand. But the passer-by would have been wrong,
for he could not see into the heart. The plump citizen was the
eternal pilgrim; he was Jason, Ulysses, Eric the Red, Albuquerque,
Cortez&mdash;starting out to discover new worlds.</p>

<p>Before he left Mr. McCunn had given Tibby a letter to post. That
morning he had received an epistle from a benevolent acquaintance,
one Mackintosh, regarding a group of urchins who called themselves
the "Gorbals Die-Hards." Behind the premises in Mearns Street
lay a tract of slums, full of mischievous boys with whom his staff
waged truceless war. But lately there had started among them a
kind of unauthorised and unofficial Boy Scouts, who, without uniform
or badge or any kind of paraphernalia, followed the banner of
Sir Robert Baden-Powell and subjected themselves to a rude discipline.
They were far too poor to join an orthodox troop, but they faithfully
copied what they believed to be the practices of more fortunate
boys. Mr. McCunn had witnessed their pathetic parades, and had
even passed the time of day with their leader, a red-haired savage
called Dougal. The philanthropic Mackintosh had taken an interest
in the gang and now desired subscriptions to send them to camp
in the country.</p>

<p>Mr. McCunn, in his new exhilaration, felt that he could not deny
to others what he proposed for himself. His last act before leaving
was to send Mackintosh ten pounds.</p>
