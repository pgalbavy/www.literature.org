<p>In the meantime, Ben Mayberry underwent an experience more peculiar
than mine.</p>

<p>I cannot speak of the mental problems with which he wrestled,
but, as he explained to me afterward, he had settled down to the
belief that the Mechanics' Bank was the one against which the
burglars were perfecting their plans. He was hopeful that the
only outcome of the conspiracy would be the capture of the criminals,
though he felt more than one pang when he reflected that the principal
one was a relative of Dolly Willard, who was the personification
of innocence and goodness to him.</p>

<p>Ben had acquired the excellent habit of always being wide awake,
excepting, of course, when he lay down for real slumber. Thus
it was that he had gone but a little distance on his way home
when he became aware that someone was following him.</p>

<p>I doubt whether there is a more uncomfortable feeling than that
caused by such a discovery. The certainty that some unknown person,
with no motive but a sinister one, is dodging at your heels, as
the mountain wolf slinks along behind the belated traveler, awaiting
the moment when he can spring upon him unawares, is enough to
cause the bravest man to shiver with dread.</p>

<p>The night was very dark. The day had been cloudy, and there was
no moon; but Ben was in a large city, with an efficient police
system (that is, equal to the average), there were street lamps,
the hour was not unusually late, and there were other persons
beside himself abroad. And yet, in the heart of the metropolis,
at the same hour, crimes have been perpetrated whose mystery has
never been unraveled to this day.</p>

<p>Ben Mayberry may have felt somewhat uneasy, but there was not
so much fear as there was curiosity to know what earthly reason
any living man could have for following him in that stealthy fashion.</p>

<p>Surely no one could suspect him of being burdened with wealth.
The only article of any account about his person was a silver
watch, which had cost him sixteen dollars. He never carried a
pistol, for he saw no necessity for doing so. If he should find
himself beset by enemies who were too strong to be resisted, he
could run as rapidly as any person in the city, and a short run
in Damietta was enough to take him to a place of safety inaccessible
to his assailants.</p>

<p>When he turned into the narrow street which led across the bridge
where he had his affray with Rutherford Richmond and his companion,
he reflected that it was perhaps the most dangerous spot in the
neighborhood. There was a single lamp just before stepping on
the bridge, where one might run against another before seeing
him.</p>

<p>He hesitated a minute as he made the turn. It was easy enough
to reach his home by a different route, which was somewhat longer,
but which was well lighted all the way, and there could be little
risk in taking it.</p>

<p>"I'll stick to the usual way," muttered Ben, striding resolutely
forward; "I don't believe anything like murder is contemplated."</p>

<p>At that moment he would have felt much more comfortable had he
possessed a pistol, or some kind of weapon, but he did not hesitate,
now that he had "put his hand to the plow."</p>

<p>A minute later he stepped on the bridge, where the gas lamp shone
upon him, and, with his usual deliberate tread, passed off in
the gloom of the other side. The instant he believed himself beyond
sight of his pursuer, he quickened his gait but continually looked
back in the hope of gaining a view of the man, for the boy was
naturally eager to learn who it was that was playing such a sinister
trick on him.</p>

<p>Just beyond, on the limit of his field of vision, Ben saw a shadowy
figure cross quickly, to the other side of the street. The stranger
did this before coming within the glare of the lamp, which would
have revealed him too plainly to those who might be curious to
secure a glimpse of his features.</p>

<p>An instant later his footfall was heard on the bridge, and he
was walking rapidly toward Ben, crossing again to the same side
of the street, as soon as over the stream. The boy stepped lightly
but briskly forward until he reached Carter's Alley, into which
he entered a couple of yards, and then came to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>At the moment of doing so, his foot struck something hard. He
knew what it was, and, stooping down, picked up a large stone,
which he held tightly grasped in his hand. Such a weapon was very
formidable in the grip of a vigorous boy, who could throw with
the skill and accuracy of Ben Mayberry.</p>

<p>The lad had scarcely halted when he caught the tip, tip of his
pursuer, who was evidently determined to overtake him before he
reached the lighted regions beyond. Ben was astonished just then,
to note that a second person was just approaching from the opposite
direction in the same guarded fashion.</p>

<p>"It must be there are two of them," was the sensible conclusion
of the boy; "they have agreed to meet here, where I wouldn't have
much show against them."</p>

<p>It followed that the party of the second part was waiting for
the coming of young Mayberry, doubtless with the understanding
that his partner in crime should follow him to a certain point
near at hand, when the two would close in on him.</p>

<p>Ben had never suspected any such conspiracy as this, and, had
he gone a little further, he would have walked directly into the
arms of the second ruffian, while peering behind him at the shadowy
villain who "still pursued him."</p>

<p>But the lad had stopped short and disconcerted the plans of the
conspirators by so doing. The one who was lying in wait was quick
to miss the boy whom he had seen cross the bridge, and, suspecting
something was wrong, he hastened stealthily toward the creek to
learn the explanation.</p>
