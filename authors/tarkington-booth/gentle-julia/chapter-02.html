<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was a pretty room, lightly scented with the pink geraniums
and blue lobelia and coral fuchsias that poised, urgent with colour,
in the window-boxes at the open windows. Sunshine paused delicately
just inside, where forms of pale-blue birds and lavender flowers
curled up and down the cretonne curtains; and a tempered, respectful
light fell upon a cushioned <em>chaise longue</em>; for there
fluffily reclined, in garments of tender fabric and gentle colours,
the prettiest twenty-year-old girl in that creditably supplied
town.</p>

<p>It must be said that no stranger would have taken Florence at
first glance to be her niece, though everybody admitted that Florence's
hair was pretty. ("I'll say <em>that</em> for her," was the family
way of putting it.). Florence did not care for her hair herself;
it was dark and thick and long, like her Aunt Julia's; but Florence&mdash;even
in the realistic presence of a mirror&mdash;preferred to think of herself
as an ashen blonde, and also as about a foot taller than she was.
Persistence kept this picture habitually in her mind, which, of
course, helps to explain her feeling that she was justified in
wearing that manner of superciliousness deplored by her mother.
More middle-aged gentlemen than are suspected believe that they
look like the waspen youths in the magazine advertisements of
clothes; and this impression of theirs accounts (as with Florence)
for much that is seemingly inexplicable in their behaviour.</p>

<p>Florence's Aunt Julia was reading an exquisitely made little
book, which bore her initials stamped in gold upon the cover;
and it had evidently reached her by a recent delivery of the mail,
for wrappings bearing cancelled stamps lay upon the floor beside
the <em>chaise longue</em>. It was a special sort of book, since
its interior was not printed, but all laboriously written with
pen and ink&mdash;poems, in truth, containing more references to a
lady named Julia than have appeared in any other poems since Herrick's.
So warmly interested in the reading as to be rather pink, though
not always with entire approval, this Julia nevertheless, at the
sound of footsteps, closed the book and placed it beneath one
of the cushions assisting the <em>chaise longue</em> to make her
position a comfortable one. Her greeting was not enthusiastic.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Florence?"</p>

<p>"I was going to ask you if Herbert and me &mdash;I mean: Was
it Noble Dill gave you Fifi and Mimi, Aunt Julia?"</p>

<p>"Noble Dill? No."</p>

<p>"I wish it was," Florence said. "I'd like these cats better if
they were from Noble Dill."</p>

<p>"Why?" Julia inquired. "Why are you so partial to Mr. Noble Dill?"</p>

<p>"I think he's <em>so</em> much the most inter'sting looking of
all that come to see you. Are you <em>sure</em> it wasn't Noble
Dill gave you these cats, Aunt Julia?"</p>

<p>A look of weariness became plainly visible upon Miss Julia Atwater's
charming face. "I do wish you'd hurry and grow up, Florence,"
she said.</p>

<p>"I do, too! What for, Aunt Julia?"</p>

<p>"So there'd be somebody else in the family of an eligible age.
I really think it's an outrageous position to be in," Julia continued,
with languid vehemence&mdash;"to be the only girl between thirteen
and forty-one in a large connection of near relatives, including
children, who all seem to think they haven't anything to think
of but Who comes to see her, and Who came to see her yesterday,
and Who was here the day before, and Who's coming to-morrow, and
Who's she going to marry! You really ought to grow up and help
me out, because I'm getting tired of it. No. It wasn't Noble Dill
but Mr. Newland Sanders that sent me Fifi and Mimi&mdash;and I want
you to keep away from 'em."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Florence.</p>

<p>"Because they're very rare cats, and you aren't ordinarily a
very careful sort of person, Florence, if you don't mind my saying
so. Besides, if I let you go near them, the next thing Herbert
would be over here mussing around, and he can't go near <em>anything</em>
without ruining it! It's just in him; he can't help it."</p>

<p>Florence looked thoughtful for a brief moment; then she asked:
"Did Newland Sanders send 'em with the names already to them?"</p>

<p>"No," said Julia, emphasizing the patience of her tone somewhat.
"I named them after they got here. Mr. Sanders hasn't seen them
yet. He had them shipped to me. He's coming this evening. Anything
more to-day, Florence?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was thinking," said Florence. "What do you think grandpa'll
think about these cats?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe there'll be any more outrages," Julia returned,
and her dark eyes showed a moment's animation. "I told him at
breakfast that the Reign of Terror was ended, and he and everybody
else had to keep away from Fifi and Mimi. Is that about all, Florence?"</p>

<p>"You let Kitty Silver go near 'em, though. She says she's fixing
to wash 'em."</p>

<p>Julia smiled faintly. "I thought she would! I had to go so far
as to tell her that as long as I'm housekeeper in my father's
house she'd do what I say or find some other place. She behaved
outrageously and pretended to believe the natural colour of Fifi
and Mimi is gray!"</p>

<p>"I expect," said Florence, after pondering seriously for a little
while&mdash;"I expect it would take quite some time to dry them."</p>

<p>"No doubt. But I'd rather you didn't assist. I'd rather you weren't
even around looking on, Florence."</p>

<p>A shade fell upon her niece's face at this. "Why, Aunt Julia,
I couldn't do any harm to Fifi and Mimi just <em>lookin'</em>
at 'em, could I?"</p>

<p>Julia laughed. "That's the trouble; you never do 'just look'
at anything you're interested in, and, if you don't mind my saying
so, you've got rather a record, dear! Now, don't you care: you
can find lots of other pleasant things to do at home&mdash;or over
at Herbert's, or Aunt Fanny's. You run along now and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well&#11834;" Florence said, moving as if to depart.</p>

<p>"You might as well go out by the front door, child," Julia suggested,
with a little watchful urgency. "You come over some day when Fifi
and Mimi have got used to the place, and you can look at them
all you want to."</p>

<p>"Well, I just&#11834;"</p>

<p>But as Florence seemed disposed still to linger, her aunt's manner
became more severe, and she half rose from her reclining position.</p>

<p>"No, I really mean it! Fifi and Mimi are royal-bred Persian cats
with a wonderful pedigree, and I don't know how much trouble and
expense it cost Mr. Sanders to get them for me. They're entirely
different from ordinary cats; they're very fine and queer, and
if anything happens to them, after all the trouble papa's made
over other presents I've had, I'll go straight to a sanitarium!
No, Florence, you keep away from the kitchen to-day, and I'd like
to hear the front door as you go out."</p>

<p>"Well," said Florence; "I do wish if these cats are as fine as
all that, it was Noble Dill that gave 'em to you. I'd like these
cats lots better if <em>he</em> gave 'em to you, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Well&#11834;" Florence said again, and departed.</p>

<p>Twenty is an unsuspicious age, except when it fears that its
dignity or grace may be threatened from without; and it might
have been a "bad sign" in revelation of Julia Atwater's character
if she had failed to accept the muffled metallic clash of the
front door's closing as a token that her niece had taken a complete
departure for home. A supplemental confirmation came a moment
later, fainter but no less conclusive: the distant slamming of
the front gate; and it made a clear picture of an obedient Florence
on her homeward way. Peace came upon Julia: she read in her book,
while at times she dropped a languid, graceful arm, and, with
the pretty hand at the slimmer end of it, groped in a dark shelter
beneath her couch to make a selection, merely by her well-experienced
sense of touch, from a frilled white box that lay in concealment
there. Then, bringing forth a crystalline violet become scented
sugar, or a bit of fruit translucent in hardened sirup, she would
delicately set it on the way to that attractive dissolution hoped
for it by the wistful donor&mdash;and all without removing her shadowy
eyes from the little volume and its patient struggle for dignified
rhymes with "Julia." Florence was no longer in her beautiful relative's
thoughts.</p>

<p>Florence was idly in the thoughts, however, of Mrs. Balche, the
next-door neighbour to the south. Happening to glance from a bay-window,
she negligently marked how the child walked to the front gate,
opened it, paused for a moment's meditation, then hurled the gate
to a vigorous closure, herself remaining within its protection.
"Odd!" Mrs. Balche murmured.</p>

<p>Having thus eloquently closed the gate, Florence slowly turned
and moved toward the rear of the house, quickening her steps as
she went, until at a run she disappeared from the scope of Mrs.
Balche's gaze, cut off by the intervening foliage of Mr. Atwater's
small orchard. Mrs. Balche felt no great interest; nevertheless,
she paused at the sound of a boy's voice, half husky, half shrill,
in an early stage of change. "What she say, Flor'nce? D'she say
we could?" But there came a warning "<em>Hush up</em>!" from Florence,
and then, in a lowered tone, the boy's voice said: "Look here;
these are mighty funny-actin' cats. I think they're kind of crazy
or somep'n. Kitty Silver's fixed a washtub full o' suds for us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Balche was reminded of her own cat, and went to give it
a little cream. Mrs. Balche was a retired widow, without children,
and too timid to like dogs; but after a suitable interval, following
the loss of her husband, she accepted from a friend the gift of
a white kitten, and named it Violet. It may be said that Mrs.
Balche, having few interests in life, and being of a sequestering
nature, lived for Violet, and that so much devotion was not good
for the latter's health. In his youth, after having shown sufficient
spirit to lose an eye during a sporting absence of three nights
and days, Violet was not again permitted enough freedom of action
to repeat this disloyalty; though, now, in his advanced middle-age,
he had been fed to such a state that he seldom cared to move,
other than by a slow, sneering wavement of the tail when friendly
words were addressed to him; and consequently, as he seemed beyond
all capacity or desire to run away, or to run at all, Mrs. Balche
allowed him complete liberty of action.</p>

<p>She found him asleep upon her "back porch," and placed beside
him a saucer of cream, the second since his luncheon. Then she
watched him affectionately as he opened his eye, turned toward
the saucer his noble Henry-the-Eighth head with its great furred
jowls, and began the process of rising for more food, which was
all that ever seemed even feebly to rouse his mind. When he had
risen, there was little space between him anywhere and the floor.</p>

<p>Violet took his cream without enthusiasm, pausing at times and
turning his head away. In fact, he persisted only out of an incorrigible
sensuality, and finally withdrew a pace or two, leaving creamy
traces still upon the saucer. With a multitude of fond words his
kind mistress drew his attention to these, whereupon, making a
visible effort, he returned and disposed of them.</p>

<p>"Dat's de 'itty darlin'," she said, stooping to stroke him. "Eat
um all up nice clean. Dood for ole sweet sin!" She continued to
stroke him, and Violet half closed his eye, but not with love
or serenity, for he simultaneously gestured with his tail, meaning
to say: "Oh, do take your hands off o' me!" Then he opened the
eye and paid a little attention to sounds from the neighbouring
yard. A high fence, shrubberies, and foliage concealed that yard
from the view of Violet, but the sounds were eloquent to him,
since they were those made by members of his own general species
when threatening atrocities. The accent may have been foreign,
but Violet caught perfectly the sense of what was being said,
and instinctively he muttered reciprocal curses within himself.</p>

<p>"What a matta, honey?" his companion inquired sympathetically.
"Ess, bad people f'ighten poor Violet!"</p>

<p>From beyond the fence came the murmurings of a boy and a girl
in hushed but urgent conversation; and with these sounds there
mingled watery agitations, splashings and the like, as well as
those low vocalizings that Violet had recognized; but suddenly
there were muffled explosions, like fireworks choked in feather
beds; and the human voices grew uncontrollably somewhat louder,
so that their import was distinguishable. "<em>Ow!</em>" "Hush
up, can't you? You want to bring the whole town to&mdash;<em>ow!</em>"
"Hush up yourself!" "Oh, <em>goodness</em>!" "Look out! Don't
let her&#11834;" "Well, look what she's <em>doin'</em> to me, can't
you?" "For Heavenses' sakes, catch holt and&#11834;<em>Ow!</em>"</p>

<p>Then came a husky voice, inevitably that of a horrified coloured
person hastening from a distance: "Oh, my soul!" There was a scurrying,
and the girl was heard in furious yet hoarsely guarded vehemence:
"Bring the clo'es prop! Bring the clo'es prop! We can poke that
one down from the garage, anyway. <em>Oh, my goodness, look at
'er go!</em>"</p>

<p>Mrs. Balche shook her head. "Naughty children!" she said, as
she picked up the saucer and went to the kitchen door, which she
held open for Violet to enter. "Want to come with mamma?"</p>

<p>But Violet had lost even the faint interest in life he had shown
a few moments earlier. He settled himself to another stupor in
the sun.</p>

<p>"Well, well," Mrs. Balche said indulgently. "Afterwhile shall
have some more nice keem."</p>

<p>Sunset was beginning to be hinted, two hours later, when, in
another quarter of the town, a little girl of seven or eight,
at play on the domestic side of an alley gate, became aware of
an older girl regarding her fixedly over the top of the gate.
The little girl felt embarrassed and paused in her gayeties, enfolding
in her arms her pet and playmate. "Howdy' do," said the stranger,
in a serious tone. "What'll you take for that cat?"</p>

<p>The little girl made no reply, and the stranger, opening the
gate, came into the yard. She looked weary, rather bedraggled,
yet hurried: her air was predominantly one of anxiety. "I'll give
you a quarter for that cat," she said. "I want an all-white cat,
but this one's only got that one gray spot over its eye, and I
don't believe there's an all-white cat left in town, leastways
that anybody's willing to part with. I'll give you twenty-five
cents for it. I haven't got it with me, but I'll promise to give
it to you day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>The little girl still made no reply, but continued to stare,
her eyes widening, and the caller spoke with desperation.</p>

<p>"See here," she said, "I <em>got</em> to have a whitish cat!
That'n isn't worth more'n a quarter, but I'll give you thirty-five
cents for her, money down, day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>At this, the frightened child set the cat upon the ground and
fled into the house. Florence Atwater was left alone; that is
to say, she was the only human being in the yard, or in sight.
Nevertheless, a human voice spoke, not far behind her. It came
through a knot-hole in the fence, and it was a voice almost of
passion.</p>

<p>"<em>You grab it!</em>"</p>

<p>Florence stood in silence, motionless; there was a solemnity
about her. The voice exhorted. "My goodness!" it said. "She didn't
say she <em>wouldn't</em> sell it, did she? You can bring her
the money like you said you would, can't you? I got <em>mine</em>,
didn't I, almost without any trouble at all! My Heavens! Ain't
Kitty Silver pretty near crazy? Just think of the position we've
put her into! I tell you, you <em>got</em> to!"</p>

<p>But now Florence moved. She moved slowly at first: then with
more decision and rapidity.</p>

<p>That evening's dusk had deepened into blue night when the two
cousins, each with a scant, uneasy dinner eaten, met by appointment
in the alley behind their mutual grandfather's place of residence,
and, having climbed the back fence, approached the kitchen. Suddenly
Florence lifted her right hand, and took between thumb and forefinger
a lock of hair upon the back of Herbert's head.</p>

<p>"Well, for Heavenses' sakes!" he burst out, justifiably protesting.</p>

<p>"Hush!" Florence warned him. "Kitty Silver's talkin' to somebody
in there. It might be Aunt Julia! C'm'ere!"</p>

<p>She led him to a position beneath an open window of the kitchen.
Here they sat upon the ground, with their backs against the stone
foundation of the house, and listened to voices and the clink
of dishes being washed.</p>

<p>"She's got another ole coloured darky woman in there with her,"
said Florence. "It's a woman belongs to her church and comes to
see her 'most every evening. Listen; she's telling her about it.
I bet we could get the real truth of it maybe better this way
than if we went in and asked her right out. Anyway, it isn't eavesdropping
if you listen when people are talkin' about you, yourself. It's
only wrong when it isn't any of your own bus&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For Heavenses' sakes hush <em>up</em>!" her cousin remonstrated.
"Listen!"</p>

<p>"'No'm, Miss Julia, ma'am,' I say"&mdash;thus came the voice of Mrs.
Silver&mdash;"'no'm, Miss Julia, ma'am. Them the same two cats you
han' me, Miss Julia, ma'am,' I say. 'Leas'wise,' I say, 'them
the two same cats whut was in nat closed-up brown basket when
I open it up an' take an' fix to wash 'em. Somebody might 'a'
took an' change 'em 'fo' they got to <em>me</em>,' I say, 'Miss
Julia, ma'am, but all the change happen to 'em sence they been
in charge of <em>me</em>, that's the gray whut come off 'em whiles
I washin' 'em an' dryin' 'em in corn meal and flannel. I dunno
how much <em>washin'</em> 'em change 'em, Miss Julia, ma'am,'
I say, ''cause how much they change or ain't change, that's fer
you to say and me not to jedge,' I say."</p>

<p>"Lan' o' misery!" cried the visitor, chuckling delightedly. "I
wonder how you done kep' you face, Miss Kitty. What Miss Julia
say?"</p>

<p>A loud, irresponsible outburst of mirth on the part of Mrs. Silver
followed. When she could again control herself, she replied more
definitely. "Miss Julia say, she say she ain't never hear no sech
outragelous sto'y in her life! She <em>tuck</em> on! Hallelujah!
An' all time, Miz Johnson, I give you my word, I stannin' there
holdin' nat basket, carryin' on up hill an' down dale how them
the same two Berjum cats Mista Sammerses sen' her: an' trouble
enough dess ten'in' to that basket, lemme say to you, Miz Johnson,
as anybody kin tell you whutever tried to take care o' two cats
whut ain't yoosta each other in the same basket. An' every blessed
minute I stannin' there, can't I hear that ole Miz Blatch nex'
do', out in her back yod an' her front yod, an' plum out in the
street, hollerin': 'Kitty? Kitty? Kitty?' '<em>Yes!</em>' Miss
Julia say, she say, 'Fine sto'y!' she say. 'Them two cats you
claim my Berjum cats, they got short hair, an' they ain't the
same age an' they ain't even nowheres near the same <em>size</em>,'
she say. 'One of 'em's as fat as <em>bofe</em> them Berjum cats,'
she say: 'an' it's on'y got one eye,' she say. 'Well, Miss Julia,
ma'am,' I say&mdash;'<em>one</em> thing; they come out white, all 'cept
dess around that there skinnier one's eye,' I say: 'dess the same
you tell me they goin' to,' I say. 'You right about <em>that</em>
much, ma'am!' I say."</p>

<p>"Oh, me!" Mrs. Johnson moaned, worn with applausive laughter.
"What she respon' then?"</p>

<p>"I set that basket down," said Kitty Silver, "an' I start fer
the do', whiles she unfasten the lid fer to take one mo' look
at 'em, I reckon: but open window mighty close by, an' nat skinny
white cat make one jump, an' after li'l while I lookin' out thishere
window an' see that ole fat Miz Blatch's tom, waddlin' crost the
yod todes home."</p>

<p>"What she doin' now?" Mrs. Johnson inquired.</p>

<p>"Who? Miss Julia? She settin' out on the front po'che talkin'
to Mista Sammerses."</p>

<p>"My name! How she goin' fix it with <em>him</em>, after all thishere
dishcumaraddle?"</p>

<p>"Who? Miss Julia? Leave her alone, honey! She take an' begin
talk so fas' an' talk so sweet, no young man ain't goin' to ricklect
he ever give her no cats, not till he's gone an' halfway home!
But I ain't tole you the en' of it, Miz Johnson, an' the en' of
it's the bes' part whut happen."</p>

<p>"What's that, Miss Kitty?"</p>

<p>"Look!" said Mrs. Silver. "Mista Atwater gone in yonder, after
I come out, an' ast whut all them goin's-on about. Well suh, an'
di'n' he come walkin' out in my kitchen an' slip me two bright
spang new silbuh dolluhs right in my han'?"</p>

<p>"My name!"</p>

<p>"Yessuh!" said Mrs. Silver triumphantly. And in the darkness
outside the window Florence drew a deep breath. "I'd of felt just
awful about this," she said, "if Noble Dill had given Aunt Julia
those Persian cats."</p>

<p>"Why?" Herbert inquired, puzzled by her way of looking at things.
"I don't see why it would make it any worse <em>who</em> gave
'em to her."</p>

<p>"Well, it would," Florence said. "But anyway, I think we did
rather wrong. Did you notice what Kitty Silver said about what
grandpa did?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I think we ought to tell him our share of it," Florence returned
thoughtfully. "I don't want to go to bed to-night with all this
on my mind, and I'm going to find grandpa right now and confess
every bit of it to him."</p>

<p>Herbert hopefully decided to go with her.</p>
