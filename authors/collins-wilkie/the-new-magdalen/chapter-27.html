<P>
"MR. JULIAN GRAY has asked me to tell him, and to tell you, Mr.
Holmcroft, how my troubles began. They began before my
recollection. They began with my birth.
<P>
"My mother (as I have heard her say) ruined her prospects, when
she was quite a young girl, by a marriage with one of her
father's servants--the groom who rode out with her. She suffered,
poor creature, the usual penalty of such conduct as hers. After a
short time she and her husband were separated--on the condition
of her sacrificing to the man whom she had married the whole of
the little fortune that she possessed in her right.
<P>
"Gaining her freedom, my mother had to gain her daily bread next.
Her family refused to take her back. She attached herself to a
company of strolling players.
<P>
"She was earning a bare living in this way, when my father
accidentally met with her. He was a man of high rank, proud of
his position, and well known in the society of that time for his
many accomplishments and his refined tastes. My mother's beauty
fascinated him. He took her from the strolling players, and
surrounded her with every luxury that a woman could desire in a
house of her own.
<P>
"I don't know how long they lived together. I only know that my
father, at the time of my first recollections, had abandoned her.
She had excited his suspicions of her fidelity--suspicions which
cruelly wronged her, as she declared to her dying day. I believed
her, because she was my mother. But I cannot expect others to do
as I did--I can only repeat what she said. My father left her
absolutely penniless. He never saw her again; and he refused to
go to her when she sent to him in her last moments on earth.
<P>
"She was back again among the strolling players when I first
remember her. It was not an unhappy time for me. I was the
favorite pet and plaything of the poor actors. They taught me to
sing and to dance at an age when other children are just
beginning to learn to read. At five years old I was in what is
called 'the profession,' and had made my poor little reputation
in booths at country fairs. As early as that, Mr. Holmcroft, I
had begun to live under an assumed name--the prettiest name they
could invent for me 'to look well in the bills.' It was sometimes
a hard struggle for us, in bad seasons, to keep body and soul
together. Learning to sing and dance in public often meant
learning to bear hunger and cold in private, when I was
apprenticed to the stage. And yet I have lived to look back on my
days with the strolling players as the happiest days of my life!
<P>
"I was ten years old when the first serious misfortune that I can
remember fell upon me. My mother died, worn out in the prime of
her life. And not long afterward the strolling company, brought
to the end of its resources by a succession of bad seasons, was
broken up.
<P>
"I was left on the world, a nameless, penniless outcast, with one
fatal inheritance--God knows, I can speak of it without vanity,
after what I have gone through!--the inheritance of my mother's
beauty.
<P>
"My only friends were the poor starved-out players. Two of them
(husband and wife) obtained engagements in another company, and I
was included in the bargain The new manager by whom I was
employed was a drunkard and a brute. One night I made a trifling
mistake in the course of the performances--and I was savagely
beaten for it. Perhaps I had inherited some of my father's
spirit--without, I hope, also inheriting my father's pitiless
nature. However that may be, I resolved (no matter what became of
me) never again to serve the man who had beaten me. I unlocked
the door of our miserable lodging at daybreak the next morning;
and, at ten years old, with my little bundle in my hand, I faced
the world alone.
<P>
"My mother had confided to me, in her last moments, my father's
name and the address of his house in London. 'He may feel some
compassion for you' (she said), 'though he feels none for me: try
him.' I had a few shillings, the last pitiful remains of my
wages, in my pocket; and I was not far from London. But I never
went near my father: child as I was, I would have starved and
died rather than go to him. I had loved my mother dearly; and I
hated the man who had turned his back on her when she lay on her
deathbed. It made no difference to Me that he happened to be my
father.
<P>
"Does this confession revolt you? You look at me, Mr. Holmcroft,
as if it did.
<P>
"Think a little, sir. Does what I have just said condemn me as a
heartless creature, even in my earliest years? What is a father
to a child--when the child has never sat on his knee, and never
had a kiss or a present from him? If we had met in the street, we
should not have known each other. Perhaps in after-days, when I
was starving in London, I may have begged of my father without
knowing it; and he may have thrown his daughter a penny to get
rid of her, without knowing it either! What is there sacred in
the relations between father and child, when they are such
relations as these? Even the flowers of the field cannot grow
without light and air to help them! How is a child's love to
grow, with nothing to help it?
<P>
"My small savings would have been soon exhausted, even if I had
been old enough and strong enough to protect them myself. As
things were, my few shillings were taken from me by gypsies. I
had no reason to complain. They gave me food and the shelter of
their tents, and they made me of use to them in various ways.
After a while hard times came to the gypsies, as they had come to
the strolling players. Some of them were imprisoned; the rest
were dispersed. It was the season for hop-gathering at the time.
I got employment among the hop-pickers next; and that done, I
went to London with my new friends.
<P>
"I have no wish to weary and pain you by dwelling on this part of
my childhood in detail. It will be enough if I tell you that I
sank lower and lower until I ended in selling matches in the
street. My mother's legacy got me many a sixpence which my
matches would never have charmed out of the pockets of strangers
if I had been an ugly child. My face. which was destined to be my
greatest misfortune in after-years, was my best friend in those
days.
<P>
"Is there anything, Mr. Holmcroft, in the life I am now trying to
describe which reminds you of a day when we were out walking
together not long since?
<P>
"I surprised and offended you, I remember; and it was not
possible for me to explain my conduct at the time. Do you
recollect the little wandering girl, with the miserable faded
nosegay in her hand, who ran after us, and begged for a
half-penny? I shocked you by bursting out crying when the child
asked us to buy her a bit of bread. Now you know why I was so
sorry for her. Now you know why I offended you the next day by
breaking an engagement with your mother and sisters, and going to
see that child in her wretched home. After what I have confessed,
you will admit that my poor little sister in adversity had the
first claim on me.
<P>
"Let me go on. I am sorry if I have distressed you. Let me go on.
<P>
"The forlorn wanderers of the streets have (as I found it) one
way always open to them of presenting their sufferings to the
notice of their rich and charitable fellow-creatures. They have
only to break the law--and they make a public appearance in a
court of justice. If the circumstances connected with their
offense are of an interesting kind, they gain a second advantage:
they are advertised all over England by a report in the
newspapers.
<P>
"Yes! even _I_ have my knowledge of the law. I know that it
completely overlooked me as long as I respected it. But on  two
different occasions it became my best frie nd when I set it at
defiance! My first fortunate offense was committed when I was
just twelve years old.
<P>
"It was evening time. I was half dead with starvation; the rain
was falling; the night was coming on. I begged--openly, loudly,
as only a hungry child can beg. An old lady in a carriage at a
shop door complained of my importunity. The policeman did his
duty. The law gave me a supper and shelter at the station-house
that night. I appeared at the police court, and, questioned by
the magistrate, I told my story truly. It was the every-day story
of thousands of children like me; but it had one element of
interest in it. I confessed to having had a father (he was then
dead) who had been a man of rank; and I owned (just as openly as
I owned everything else) that I had never applied to him for
help, in resentment of his treatment of my mother. This incident
was new, I suppose; it led to the appearance of my 'case' in the
newspapers. The reporters further served my interests by
describing me as 'pretty and interesting.' Subscriptions were
sent to the court. A benevolent married couple, in a respectable
sphere of life, visited the workhouse to see me. I produced a
favorable impression on them--especially on the wife. I was
literally friendless; I had no unwelcome relatives to follow me
and claim me. The wife was childless; the husband was a
good-natured man. It ended in their taking me away with them to
try me in service.
<P>
"I have always felt the aspiration, no matter how low I may have
fallen, to struggle upward to a position above me; to rise, in
spite of fortune, superior to my lot in life. Perhaps some of my
father's pride may be at the root of this restless feeling in me.
It seems to be a part of my nature. It brought me into this
house--and it will go with me out of this house. Is it my curse
or my blessing? I am not able to decide.
<P>
"On the first night when I slept in my new home I said to myself,
'They have taken me to be their servant: I will be something more
than that--they shall end in taking me for their child.' Before I
had been a week in the house I was the wife's favorite companion
in the absence of her husband at his place of business. She was a
highly accomplished woman, greatly her husband's superior in
cultivation, and, unfortunately for herself, also his superior in
years. The love was all on her side. Excepting certain occasions
on which he roused her jealousy, they lived together on
sufficiently friendly terms. She was one of the many wives who
resign themselves to be disappointed in their husbands--and he
was one of the many husbands who never know what their wives
really think of them. Her one great happiness was in teaching me.
I was eager to learn; I made rapid progress. At my pliant age I
soon acquired the refinements of language and manner which
characterized my mistress. It is only the truth to say that the
cultivation which has made me capable of personating a lady was
her work.
<P>
"For three happy years I lived under that friendly roof. I was
between fifteen and sixteen years of age, when the fatal
inheritance from my mother cast its first shadow on my life. One
miserable day the wife's motherly love for me changed in an
instant to the jealous hatred that never forgives. Can you guess
the reason? The husband fell in love with me.
<P>
"I was innocent; I was blameless. He owned it himself to the
clergyman who was with him at his death. By that time years had
passed. It was too late to justify me.
<P>
"He was at an age (when I was under his care) when men are
usually supposed to regard women with tranquillity, if not with
indifference. It had been the habit of years with me to look on
him as my second father. In my innocent ignorance of the feeling
which really inspired him, I permitted him to indulge in little
paternal familiarities with me, which inflamed his guilty
passion. His wife discovered him--not I. No words can describe my
astonishment and my horror when the first outbreak of her
indignation forced on me the knowledge of the truth. On my knees
I declared myself guiltless. On my knees I implored her to do
justice to my purity and my youth. At other times the sweetest
and the most considerate of women, jealousy had now transformed
her to a perfect fury. She accused me of deliberately encouraging
him; she declared she would turn me out of the house with her own
hands. Like other easy-tempered men, her husband had reserves of
anger in him which it was dangerous to provoke. When his wife
lifted her hand against me, he lost all self-control, on his
side. He openly told her that life was worth nothing to him
without me. He openly avowed his resolution to go with me when I
left the house. The maddened woman seized him by the arm--I saw
that, and saw no more. I ran out into the street, panic-stricken.
A cab was passing. I got into it before he could open the house
door, and drove to the only place of refuge I could think of--a
small shop, kept by the widowed sister of one of our servants.
Here I obtained shelter for the night. The next day he discovered
me. He made his vile proposals; he offered me the whole of his
fortune; he declared his resolution, say what I might, to return
the next day. That night, by help of the good woman who had taken
care of me-- under cover of the darkness, as if _I_ had been to
blame!--I was secretly removed to the East End of London, and
placed under the charge of a trustworthy person who lived, in a
very humble way, by letting lodgings.
<P>
"Here, in a little back garret at the top of the house, I was
thrown again on the world-- an age when it was doubly perilous
for me to be left to my own resources to earn the bread I ate and
the roof that covered me.
<P>
"I claim no credit to myself--young as I was, placed as I was
between the easy life of Vice and the hard life of Virtue--for
acting as I did. The man simply horrified me: my natural impulse
was to escape from him. But let it be remembered, before I
approach the saddest part of my sad story, that I was an innocent
girl, and that I was at least not to blame.
<P>
"Forgive me for dwelling as I have done on my early years. I
shrink from speaking of the events that are still to come.
<P>
"In losing the esteem of my first benefactress, I had, in my
friendless position, lost all hold on an honest life--except the
one frail hold of needle-work. The only reference of which I
could now dispose was the recommendation of me by my landlady to
a place of business which largely employed expert needle-women.
It is needless for me to tell you how miserably work of that sort
is remunerated: you have read about it in the newspapers. As long
as my health lasted I contrived to live and to keep out of debt.
Few girls could have resisted as long as I did the
slowly-poisoning influences of crowded work-room, insufficient
nourishment, and almost total privation of exercise. My life as a
child had been a life in the open air: it had helped to
strengthen a constitution naturally hardy, naturally free from
all taint of hereditary disease. But my time came at last. Under
the cruel stress laid on it my health gave way. I was struck down
by low fever, and sentence was pronounced on me by my
fellow-lodgers: 'Ah, poor thing, _her_ troubles will soon be at
an end!'
<P>
"The prediction might have proved true--I might never have
committed the errors and endured the sufferings of after
years--if I had fallen ill in another house.
<P>
"But it was my good, or my evil, fortune--I dare not say
which--to have interested in myself and my sorrows an actress at
a suburban theatre, who occupied the room under mine. Except when
her stage duties took her away for two or three hours in the
evening, this noble creature never left my bedside. Ill as she
could afford it, her purse paid my inevitable expenses while I
lay helpless. The landlady, moved by her example, accepted half
the weekly rent of my room. The doctor, with the Christian
kindness of his profession, would take no fees. All that the
tenderest care could accomplish was lavished on me; my youth and
my constitution did the rest. I struggled back to life--and then
I took up my needle again.
<P>
"It may  surprise you that I should have failed (having an actress
for my dearest friend) to use the means of introduction thus
offered to me to try the stage--especially as my childish
training had given me, in some small degree, a familiarity with
the Art.
<P>
"I had only one motive for shrinking from an appearance at the
theatre--but it was strong enough to induce me to submit to any
alternative that remained, no matter how hopeless it might be. If
I showed myself on the public stage, my discovery by the man from
whom I had escaped would be only a question of time. I knew him
to be habitually a play-goer and a subscriber to a theatrical
newspaper. I had even heard him speak of the theatre to which my
friend was attached, and compare it advantageously with places of
amusement of far higher pretensions. Sooner or later, if I joined
the company he would be certain to go and see 'the new actress.'
The bare thought of it reconciled me to returning to my needle.
Before I was strong enough to endure the atmosphere of the
crowded workroom I obtained permission, as a favor, to resume my
occupation at home.
<P>
"Surely my choice was the choice of a virtuous girl? And yet the
day when I returned to my needle was the fatal day of my life.
<P>
"I had now not only to provide for the wants of the passing
hour--I had my debts to pay. It was only to be done by toiling
harder than ever, and by living more poorly than ever. I soon
paid the penalty, in my weakened state, of leading such a life as
this. One evening my head turned suddenly giddy; my heart
throbbed frightfully. I managed to open the window, and to let
the fresh air into the room, and I felt better. But I was not
sufficiently recovered to be able to thread my needle. I thought
to myself, 'If I go out for half an hour, a little exercise may
put me right again.' I had not, as I suppose, been out more than
ten minutes when the attack from which I had suffered in my room
was renewed. There was no shop near in which I could take refuge.
I tried to ring the bell of the nearest house door. Before I
could reach it I fainted in the street.
<P>
"How long hunger and weakness left me at the mercy of the first
stranger who might pass by, it is impossible for me to say.
<P>
"When I partially recovered my senses I was conscious of being
under shelter somewhere, and of having a wine-glass containing
some cordial drink held to my lips by a man. I managed to
swallow--I don't know how little, or how much. The stimulant had
a very strange effect on me. Reviving me at first, it ended in
stupefying me. I lost my senses once more.
<P>
"When I next recovered myself, the day was breaking. I was in a
bed in a strange room. A nameless terror seized me. I called out.
Three or four women came in, whose faces betrayed, even to my
inexperienced eyes, the shameless infamy of their lives. I
started up in the bed. I implored them to tell me where I was,
and what had happened--
<P>
"Spare me! I can say no more. Not long since you heard Miss
Roseberry call me an outcast from the streets. Now you know--as
God is my judge I am speaking the truth!--now you know what made
me an outcast, and in what measure I deserved my disgrace."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Her voice faltered, her resolution failed her, for the first
time.
<P>
"Give me a few minutes," she said, in low, pleading tones. "If I
try to go on now, I am afraid I shall cry."
<P>
She took the chair which Julian had placed for her, turning her
face aside so that neither of the men could see it. One of her
hands was pressed over her bosom, the other hung listlessly at
her side.
<P>
Julian rose from the place that he had occupied. Horace neither
moved nor spoke. His head was on his breast: the traces of tears
on his cheeks owned mutely that she had touched his heart. Would
he forgive her? Julian passed on, and approached Mercy's chair.
<P>
In silence he took the hand which hung at her side. In silence he
lifted it to his lips and kissed it, as her brother might have
kissed it. She started, but she never looked up. Some strange
fear of discovery seemed to possess her. "Horace?" she whispered,
timidly. Julian made no reply. He went back to his place, and
allowed her to think it was Horace.
<P>
The sacrifice was immense enough--feeling toward her as he
felt--to be worthy of the man who made it.
<P>
A few minutes had been all she asked for. In a few minutes she
turned toward them again. Her sweet voice was steady once more;
her eyes rested softly on Horace as she went on.
<P>
"What was it possible for a friendless girl in my position to do,
when the full knowledge of the outrage had been revealed to me?
<P>
"If I had possessed near and dear relatives to protect and advise
me, the wretches into whose hands I had fallen might have felt
the penalty of the law. I knew no more of the formalities which
set the law in motion than a child. But I had another alternative
(you will say). Charitable societies would have received me and
helped me, if I had stated my case to them. I knew no more of the
charitable societies than I knew of the law. At least, then, I
might have gone back to the honest people among whom I had lived?
When I received my freedom, after the interval of some days, I
was ashamed to go back to the honest people. Helplessly and
hopelessly, without sin or choice of mine, I drifted, as
thousands of other women have drifted, into the life which set a
mark on me for the rest of my days.
<P>
"Are you surprised at the ignorance which this confession
reveals?
<P>
"You, who have your solicitors to inform you of legal remedies
and your newspapers, circulars, and active friends to sound the
praises of charitable institutions continually in your ears--you,
who possess these advantages, have no idea of the outer world of
ignorance in which your lost fellow-creatures live. They know
nothing (unless they are rogues accustomed to prey on society) of
your benevolent schemes to help them. The purpose of public
charities, and the way to discover and apply to them, ought to be
posted at the corner of every street. What do we know of public
dinners and eloquent sermons and neatly printed circulars? Every
now and then the ease of some forlorn creature (generally of a
woman) who has committed suicide, within five minutes' walk,
perhaps, of an institution which would have opened its doors to
her, appears in the newspapers, shocks you dreadfully, and is
then forgotten again. Take as much pains to make charities and
asylums known among the people without money as are taken to make
a new play, a new journal, or a new medicine known among the
people with money and you will save many a lost creature who is
perishing now.
<P>
"You will forgive and understand me if I say no more of this
period of my life. Let me pass to the new incident in my career
which brought me for the second time before the public notice in
a court of law.
<P>
"Sad as my experience has been, it has not taught me to think ill
of human nature. I had found kind hearts to feel for me in my
former troubles; and I had friends--faithful, self-denying,
generous friends--among my sisters in adversity now. One of these
poor women (she has gone, I am glad to think, from the world that
used her so hardly) especially attracted my sympathies. She was
the gentlest, the most unselfish creature I have ever met with.
We lived together like sisters. More than once in the dark hours
when the thought of self-destruction comes to a desperate woman,
the image of my poor devoted friend, left to suffer alone, rose
in my mind and restrained me. You will hardly understand it, but
even we had our happy days. When she or I had a few shillings to
spare, we used to offer one another little presents, and enjoy
our simple pleasure in giving and receiving as keenly as if we
had been the most reputable women living.
<P>
"One day I took my friend into a shop to buy her a ribbon--only a
bow for her dress. She was to choose it, and I was to pay for it,
and it was to be the prettiest ribbon that money could buy.
<P>
"The shop was full; we had to wait a little before we could be
served.
<P>
"Next to me, as I stood at the counter with my companion, was a
gaudily-dressed woman, looking at some handkerchiefs. The
handkerchiefs were finely embroidered, but the smart lady was
hard to please. She tumbled them up dis dainfully in a heap, and
asked for other specimens from the stock in the shop. The man, in
clearing the handkerchiefs out of the way, suddenly missed one.
He was quite sure of it, from a peculiarity in the embroidery
which made the handkerchief especially noticeable. I was poorly
dressed, and I was close to the handkerchiefs. After one look at
me he shouted to the superintendent: 'Shut the door! There is a
thief in the shop!'
<P>
"The door was closed; the lost handkerchief was vainly sought for
on the counter and on the floor. A robbery had been committed;
and I was accused of being the thief.
<P>
"I will say nothing of what I felt--I will only tell you what
happened.
<P>
"I was searched, and the handkerchief was discovered on me. The
woman who had stood next to me, on finding herself threatened
with discovery, had no doubt contrived to slip the stolen
handkerchief into my pocket. Only an accomplished thief could
have escaped detection in that way without my knowledge. It was
useless, in the face of the facts, to declare my innocence. I had
no character to appeal to. My friend tried to speak for me; but
what was she? Only a lost woman like myself. My landlady's
evidence in favor of my honesty produced no effect; it was
against her that she let lodgings to people in my position. I was
prosecuted, and found guilty. The tale of my disgrace is now
complete, Mr. Holmcroft. No matter whether I was innocent or not,
the shame of it remains--I have been imprisoned for theft.
<P>
"The matron of the prison was the next person who took an
interest in me. She reported favorably of my behavior to the
authorities and when I had served my time (as the phrase was
among us) she gave me a letter to the kind friend and guardian of
my later years--to the lady who is coming here to take me back
with her to the Refuge.
<P>
"From this time the story of my life is little more than the
story of a woman's vain efforts to recover her lost place in the
world.
<P>
"The matron, on receiving me into the Refuge, frankly
acknowledged that there were terrible obstacles in my way. But
she saw that I was sincere, and she felt a good woman's sympathy
and compassion for me. On my side, I did not shrink from
beginning the slow and weary journey back again to a reputable
life from the humblest starting-point--from domestic service.
After first earning my new character in the Refuge, I obtained a
trial in a respectable house. I worked hard, and worked
uncomplainingly; but my mother's fatal legacy was against me from
the first. My personal appearance excited remark; my manners and
habits were not the manners and habits of the women among whom my
lot was cast. I tried one place after another--always with the
same results. Suspicion and jealousy I could endure; but I was
defenseless when curiosity assailed me in its turn. Sooner or
later inquiry led to discovery. Sometimes the servants threatened
to give warning in a body--and I was obliged to go. Sometimes,
where there was a young man in the family, scandal pointed at me
and at him--and again I was obliged to go. If you care to know
it, Miss Roseberry can tell you the story of those sad days. I
confided it to her on the memorable night when we met in the
French cottage; I have no heart repeat it now. After a while I
wearied of the hopeless struggle. Despair laid its hold on me--I
lost all hope in the mercy of God. More than once I walked to one
or other of the bridges, and looked over the parapet at the
river, and said to myself 'Other women have done it: why
shouldn't I?'
<P>
"You saved me at that time, Mr. Gray--as you have saved me since.
I was one of your congregation when you preached in the chapel of
the Refuge You reconciled others besides me to our hard
pilgrimage. In their name and in mine, sir, I thank you.
<P>
"I forget how long it was after the bright day when you comforted
and sustained us that the war broke out between France and
Germany. But I can never forget the evening when the matron sent
for me into her own room and said, 'My dear, your life here is a
wasted life. If you have courage enough left to try it, I can
give you another chance.'
<P>
"I passed through a month of probation in a London hospital. A
week after that I wore the red cross of the Geneva Convention--I
was appointed nurse in a French ambulance. When you first saw me,
Mr. Holmcroft, I still had my nurse's dress on, hidden from you
and from everybody under a gray cloak.
<P>
"You know what the next event was; you know how I entered this
house.
<P>
"I have not tried to make the worst of my trials and troubles in
telling you what my life has been. I have honestly described it
for what it was when I met with Miss Roseberry--a life without
hope. May you never know the temptation that tried me when the
shell struck its victim in the French cottage! There she
lay--dead! _Her_ name was untainted. _Her_ future promised me the
reward which had been denied to the honest efforts of a penitent
woman. My lost place in the world was offered back to me on the
one condition that I stooped to win it by a fraud. I had no
prospect to look forward to; I had no friend near to advise me
and to save me; the fairest years of my womanhood had been wasted
in the vain struggle to recover my good name. Such was my
position when the possibility of personating Miss Roseberry first
forced itself on my mind. Impulsively, recklessly-- wickedly, if
you like--I seized the opportunity, and let you pass me through
the German lines under Miss Roseberry's name. Arrived in England,
having had time to reflect, I made my first and last effort to
draw back before it was too late. I went to the Refuge, and
stopped on the opposite side of the street, looking at it. The
old hopeless life of irretrievable disgrace confronted me as I
fixed my eyes on the familiar door; the horror of returning to
that life was more than I could force myself to endure. An empty
cab passed me at the moment. The driver held up his hand. In
sheer despair I stopped him, and when he said 'Where to?' in
sheer despair again I answered, 'Mablethorpe House.'
