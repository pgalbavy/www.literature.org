<p>Sunday proved the most dismal day during the outing of the Boy
Scouts in the woods of Southern Maine. The rain which set in on
the previous evening continued, with only an occasional let-up,
until late at night. So dense a fog overhung the lake that not
once was the party able to detect the opposite shore, where Doctor
Spellman and his family passed the dreary hours as best they could.
The Sabbath was always observed by the Boy Scouts. Had the weather
been good, they would have refrained from making excursions through
the forest, fishing or anything in the nature of amusement. While
Scout Master Hall might be regarded by some as puritanical in
a few of his ideas, he was broad minded and held a wholesome broadness
of views, with a full sympathy for boyhood which explained his
popularity among his younger associates.</p>

<p>As has been intimated, the troop contained lads of the Jewish,
the Catholic and the Protestant faith, but all were bound together
by a generous charity that could never wound the feelings of the
most sensitive. There may have been some chaffing over the work
of the national political conventions at Chicago and Baltimore,
but it was good natured and left no sting behind. If, as once
or twice occurred, the discussion threatened to become too warm,
the Scout Master interposed with a few words which made all serene
again.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the leader to give his boys a talk every
Sunday evening. Of course it was appropriate for the day and beneficial
to every one, for no counsel could be sounder and no appeal more
persuasive and in accordance with the great Teacher of all.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that when the long day had worn away, the
last meal had been eaten, the dishes put by and nothing further
remained to be done, the party gathered in the spacious sitting
room of the bungalow, where most of them took easy positions on
the floor, while a few, including the Scout Master, were seated
in chairs. The air continued so chilly that the big fire on the
hearth was kept ablaze, and diffused a genial, welcome warmth.
The hanging lamp was not lighted, for the flame gave abundant
illumination in which every one could recognize the faces of his
comrades.</p>

<p>"Boys," said the leader, "my thoughts this afternoon have been
drawn toward the greatest tragedy of the sea in all history,—the
sinking of the <em>Titanic</em> one April by collision with an
iceberg in the northern Atlantic. None of you can forget the terrifying
calamity, the like of which, as I have said, the world has never
known. There are many features of the catastrophe of which I shall
not speak more than to refer to the criminal neglect to provide
enough life boats, the reckless driving ahead when it was known
icebergs were near, the foolish belief that the <em>Titanic</em>
was unsinkable.</p>

<p>"But there are other facts connected with the tragedy upon which
it is well to dwell for a few minutes. In the first place, few
persons comprehend the stupendous bulk of the <em>Titanic</em>
and her sister ship the <em>Olympic</em>. I ask you for a moment
to fix in your minds a clear idea of the distance of a sixth of
a mile. You can readily do so. Starting from this bungalow, picture
how far such a walk along shore would take you."</p>

<p>The Scout Master paused for a moment and resumed:</p>

<p>"Such was the length of the <em>Titanic</em>, whose sides towered
more than seventy feet above the surface of the ocean. One of
our biggest express railway trains would look like a toy placed
alongside of her. Viewed from a brief distance, the steamer gave
you no idea of its overwhelming proportions. You must stand close
beside such a craft, walk the deck, and compare it with other
vessels near at hand.</p>

<p>"Such is the leviathan which is plunging westward at almost express
train speed through the night, with nearly three thousand human
beings on board. Then comes the crash with the ice mountain, which
inflicts a mortal wound, and this supposed unsinkable monster
begins settling where she shall dive for two miles before finding
her eternal grave at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>"Who can forget the thrilling heroism displayed by men and women
when they knew they had but a few more minutes to live. It has
been said, and doubtless it is true, that many of those who stood
by and helped the women into the few life boats, believed they
were safer on the steamer than in the small craft. One of the
survivors told me he was ashamed to leave and would not have done
so, except for the urgency of his wife. Even then he was sure
of soon returning and being laughed at by those who had not left
the steamer at all.</p>

<p>"It is probable, I say, that this was true to a greater or less
extent, but the fact remains that, when the awful doom became
certain, the highest heroism was displayed by women and men from
many of whom the world expected no such sublime sacrifice. The
men helped the women to places in the hurriedly launched boats,
husbands literally forced their wives to leave, embraced and kissed
them good-bye, fearing they would never meet again in this world,
and still spoke cheering words.</p>

<p>"I cannot express my emotions when I read of the last scene of
all. Think of the eight musicians, who at first in the hope of
infusing courage into the hearts of the doomed multitude, played
inspiriting airs, but when the grim shadow settled over them and
the merciless tread of Death was heard hurrying over the deck,
shifted to the hymn ‘Nearer, my God, to Thee,’ and continued playing
with exquisite, unfaltering skill until the inrushing sweep of
waves palsied each hand and tongue and huddled all into eternity.</p>

<p>"I have been told that while they were playing, scores of passengers
gathered round and joined in singing the hymn. They were led by
a man with a rich tenor voice, who calmly beat time with one upraised
hand as he looked unwaveringly into the white faces of his doomed
companions. He sang without the tremor of a note to the end.</p>

<p>"Michael, will you please sing those words for us?"</p>

<p>Mike was sitting on the floor, beside Isaac Rothstein near the
fireplace, absorbed as was every one in the vivid picture which
Scout Master Hall drew of the tragedy of the centuries. All held
their breath, and they seemed to see the plunge of the <em>Titanic</em>
to her grave at the bottom of the tempestuous Atlantic.</p>

<p>The call upon Mike was so unexpected by him that he did not stir
for a moment. Then he slowly rose to his feet, cleared his throat
and sang in that marvelous voice, whose sweetness surpassed anything
that Scout Master or Boy Scout had ever heard:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Nearer, my God, to thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer to thee!<br/>
E’en though it be a cross<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That raiseth me!<br/>
Still all my song shall be,<br/>
Nearer, my God, to thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer to thee!

</p>
<p>
"Though like a wanderer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun gone down,<br/>
Darkness be over me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My rest a stone,<br/>
Yet in my dreams I’d be<br/>
Nearer, my God, to thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer to thee!"

</p>
</div>
<p>Before the singer had finished the first verse there was not
a dry eye in the room. Several boys swallowed hard and tried to
hide their emotion, but it was useless.</p>

<p>It was all Mike could do to keep to his task, for the spell of
the Scout Master’s words was upon him and he could not wholly
resist the enthralment of his own voice. At the moment of finishing
the second verse, Isaac Rothstein hurriedly covered his face with
his hands and sobbed as if his heart was breaking. His grief was
so deep that the others looked pityingly toward him, and the singer
himself was overcome for the moment. He started on the third stanza,
but his voice broke, and he stood trying bravely to pull himself
together.</p>

<p>Young Rothstein, with one hand over his face reached up the other
and seized the fingers of Mike. Amid his sobs he faltered:</p>

<p>"That man who led the singing was my father!"</p>

<p>Mike placed one arm over the shoulder of the stricken lad and
sat down beside him.</p>

<p>"Can ye forgive me?" he tenderly asked; "I didn’t draam of anything
of the kind?"</p>

<p>"Go on!—sing the rest," moaned the Jewish youth.</p>

<p>Mike rose to his feet, and with tears streaming down his cheeks
tried hard to comply with the request. But he could not; he dropped
down more hastily than before and covering his own face shook
with sympathetic grief and the same may be said of every one in
the room.</p>

<p>Sunshine and storm commingle and strive for mastery; tears bedew
the cheek of laughter; the peal of the wedding bells changes to
tolling for the dead; grief treads on the heels of rejoicing,
and Life and Death with hands forever clasped wander up and down
the earth, and may God pity us all! </p>
