<p>For an hour or more I sat waiting (Umslopogaas having meanwhile gone to
sleep also) till at length the east turned grey, and huge misty shapes
moved over the surface of the water like ghosts of long-forgotten dawns.
They were the vapours rising from their watery bed to greet the sun.
Then the grey turned to primrose, and the primrose grew to red. Next,
glorious bars of light sprang up across the eastern sky, and through
them the radiant messengers of the dawn came speeding upon their arrowy
way, scattering the ghostly vapours and awaking the mountains with
a kiss, as they flew from range to range and longitude to longitude.
Another moment, and the golden gates were open and the sun himself
came forth as a bridegroom from his chamber, with pomp and glory and a
flashing as of ten million spears, and embraced the night and covered
her with brightness, and it was day.
</p>
<p>But as yet I could see nothing save the beautiful blue sky above, for
over the water was a thick layer of mist exactly as though the whole
surface had been covered with billows of cotton wool. By degrees,
however, the sun sucked up the mists, and then I saw that we were afloat
upon a glorious sheet of blue water of which I could not make out the
shore. Some eight or ten miles behind us, however, there stretched as
far as the eye could reach a range of precipitous hills that formed a
retaining wall of the lake, and I have no doubt but that it was through
some entrance in these hills that the subterranean river found its way
into the open water. Indeed, I afterwards ascertained this to be the
fact, and it will be some indication of the extraordinary strength and
directness of the current of the mysterious river that the canoe, even
at this distance, was still answering to it. Presently, too, I,
or rather Umslopogaas, who woke up just then, discovered another
indication, and a very unpleasant one it was. Perceiving some whitish
object upon the water, Umslopogaas called my attention to it, and with
a few strokes of the paddle brought the canoe to the spot, whereupon
we discovered that the object was the body of a man floating face
downwards. This was bad enough, but imagine my horror when Umslopogaas
having turned him on to his back with the paddle, we recognized in the
sunken features the lineaments of--whom do you suppose? None other than
our poor servant who had been sucked down two days before in the waters
of the subterranean river. It quite frightened me. I thought that we had
left him behind for ever, and behold! borne by the current, he had
made the awful journey with us, and with us had reached the end. His
appearance also was dreadful, for he bore traces of having touched the
pillar of fire--one arm being completely shrivelled up and all his hair
being burnt off. The features were, as I have said, sunken, and yet they
preserved upon them that awful look of despair that I had seen upon
his living face as the poor fellow was sucked down. Really the sight
unnerved me, weary and shaken as I felt with all that we had gone
through, and I was heartily glad when suddenly and without any warning
the body began to sink just as though it had had a mission, which having
been accomplished, it retired; the real reason no doubt being that
turning it on its back allowed a free passage to the gas. Down it went
to the transparent depths--fathom after fathom we could trace its course
till at last a long line of bright air-bubbles, swiftly chasing each
other to the surface, alone remained where it had passed. At length
these, too, were gone, and that was an end of our poor servant.
Umslopogaas thoughtfully watched the body vanish.
</p><p>‘What did he follow us for?’ he asked. ‘’Tis an ill omen for thee and
me, Macumazahn.’ And he laughed.
</p><p>I turned on him angrily, for I dislike these unpleasant suggestions.
If people have such ideas, they ought in common decency to keep them
to themselves. I detest individuals who make on the subject of their
disagreeable presentiments, or who, when they dream that they saw one
hanged as a common felon, or some such horror, will insist upon telling
one all about it at breakfast, even if they have to get up early to do
it.
</p><p>Just then, however, the others woke up and began to rejoice exceedingly
at finding that we were out of that dreadful river and once more beneath
the blue sky. Then followed a babel of talk and suggestions as to what
we were to do next, the upshot of all of which was that, as we were
excessively hungry, and had nothing whatsoever left to eat except a few
scraps of biltong (dried game-flesh), having abandoned all that remained
of our provisions to those horrible freshwater crabs, we determined to
make for the shore. But a new difficulty arose. We did not know where
the shore was, and, with the exception of the cliffs through which the
subterranean river made its entry, could see nothing but a wide expanse
of sparkling blue water. Observing, however, that the long flights of
aquatic birds kept flying from our left, we concluded that they were
advancing from their feeding-grounds on shore to pass the day in the
lake, and accordingly headed the boat towards the quarter whence they
came, and began to paddle. Before long, however, a stiffish breeze
sprang up, blowing directly in the direction we wanted, so we improvized
a sail with a blanket and the pole, which took us along merrily. This
done, we devoured the remnants of our biltong, washed down with the
sweet lake water, and then lit our pipes and awaited whatever might turn
up.
</p><p>When we had been sailing for an hour, Good, who was searching the
horizon with the spy-glass, suddenly announced joyfully that he saw
land, and pointed out that, from the change in the colour of the water,
he thought we must be approaching the mouth of a river. In another
minute we perceived a great golden dome, not unlike that of St Paul’s,
piercing the morning mists, and while we were wondering what in the
world it could be, Good reported another and still more important
discovery, namely, that a small sailing-boat was advancing towards us.
This bit of news, which we were very shortly able to verify with our
own eyes, threw us into a considerable flutter. That the natives of this
unknown lake should understand the art of sailing seemed to suggest that
they possessed some degree of civilization. In a few more minutes it
became evident that the occupant or occupants of the advancing boat
had made us out. For a moment or two she hung in the wind as though in
doubt, and then came tacking towards us with great swiftness. In ten
more minutes she was within a hundred yards, and we saw that she was a
neat little boat--not a canoe ‘dug out’, but built more or less in the
European fashion with planks, and carrying a singularly large sail for
her size. But our attention was soon diverted from the boat to her crew,
which consisted of a man and a woman, <u>nearly as white as ourselves</u>.
</p><p>We stared at each other in amazement, thinking that we must be mistaken;
but no, there was no doubt about it. They were not fair, but the two
people in the boat were decidedly of a white as distinguished from a
black race, as white, for instance, as Spaniards or Italians. It was a
patent fact. So it was true, after all; and, mysteriously led by a Power
beyond our own, we had discovered this wonderful people. I could have
shouted for joy when I thought of the glory and the wonder of the thing;
and as it was, we all shook hands and congratulated each other on the
unexpected success of our wild search. All my life had I heard rumours
of a white race that existed in the highlands of this vast continent,
and longed to put them to the proof, and now here I saw it with my own
eyes, and was dumbfounded. Truly, as Sir Henry said, the old Roman was
right when he wrote ‘Ex Africa semper aliquid novi’, which he tells me
means that out of Africa there always comes some new thing.
</p><p>The man in the boat was of a good but not particularly fine physique,
and possessed straight black hair, regular aquiline features, and an
intelligent face. He was dressed in a brown cloth garment, something
like a flannel shirt without the sleeves, and in an unmistakable kilt of
the same material. The legs and feet were bare. Round the right arm and
left leg he wore thick rings of yellow metal that I judged to be gold.
The woman had a sweet face, wild and shy, with large eyes and curling
brown hair. Her dress was made of the same material as the man’s, and
consisted, as we afterwards discovered, first of a linen under-garment
that hung down to her knee, and then of a single long strip of cloth,
about four feet wide by fifteen long, which was wound round the body in
graceful folds and finally flung over the left shoulder so that the end,
which was dyed blue or purple or some other colour, according to the
social standing of the wearer, hung down in front, the right arm
and breast being, however, left quite bare. A more becoming dress,
especially when, as in the present case, the wearer was young and
pretty, it is quite impossible to conceive. Good (who has an eye for
such things) was greatly struck with it, and so indeed was I. It was so
simple and yet so effective.
</p><p>Meanwhile, if we had been astonished at the appearance of the man and
woman, it was clear that they were far more astonished at us. As for the
man, he appeared to be overcome with fear and wonder, and for a while
hovered round our canoe, but would not approach. At last, however,
he came within hailing distance, and called to us in a language that
sounded soft and pleasing enough, but of which we could not understand
one word. So we hailed back in English, French, Latin, Greek, German,
Zulu, Dutch, Sisutu, Kukuana, and a few other native dialects that I
am acquainted with, but our visitor did not understand any of these
tongues; indeed, they appeared to bewilder him. As for the lady, she
was busily employed in taking stock of us, and Good was returning the
compliment by staring at her hard through his eyeglass, a proceeding
that she seemed rather to enjoy than otherwise. At length, the man,
being unable to make anything of us, suddenly turned his boat round and
began to head off for the shore, his little boat skimming away before
the wind like a swallow. As she passed across our bows the man turned to
attend to the large sail, and Good promptly took the opportunity to kiss
his hand to the young lady. I was horrified at this proceeding, both on
general grounds and because I feared that she might take offence, but
to my delight she did not, for, first glancing round and seeing that her
husband, or brother, or whoever he was, was engaged, she promptly kissed
hers back.
</p><p>‘Ah!’ said I. ‘It seems that we have at last found a language that the
people of this country understand.’
</p><p>‘In which case,’ said Sir Henry, ‘Good will prove an invaluable
interpreter.’
</p><p>I frowned, for I do not approve of Good’s frivolities, and he knows
it, and I turned the conversation to more serious subjects. ‘It is very
clear to me,’ I said, ‘that the man will be back before long with a host
of his fellows, so we had best make up our minds as to how we are going
to receive them.’
</p><p>‘The question is how will they receive us?’ said Sir Henry.
</p><p>As for Good he made no remark, but began to extract a small square tin
case that had accompanied us in all our wanderings from under a pile of
baggage. Now we had often remonstrated with Good about this tin case,
inasmuch as it had been an awkward thing to carry, and he had never
given any very explicit account as to its contents; but he had insisted
on keeping it, saying mysteriously that it might come in very useful one
day.
</p><p>‘What on earth are you going to do, Good?’ asked Sir Henry.
</p><p>‘Do--why dress, of course! You don’t expect me to appear in a new
country in these things, do you?’ and he pointed to his soiled and worn
garments, which were however, like all Good’s things, very tidy, and
with every tear neatly mended.
</p><p>We said no more, but watched his proceedings with breathless interest.
His first step was to get Alphonse, who was thoroughly competent in
such matters, to trim his hair and beard in the most approved fashion.
I think that if he had had some hot water and a cake of soap at hand
he would have shaved off the latter; but he had not. This done, he
suggested that we should lower the sail of the canoe and all take a
bath, which we did, greatly to the horror and astonishment of Alphonse,
who lifted his hands and ejaculated that these English were indeed a
wonderful people. Umslopogaas, who, though he was, like most high-bred
Zulus, scrupulously cleanly in his person, did not see the fun of
swimming about in a lake, also regarded the proceeding with mild
amusement. We got back into the canoe much refreshed by the cold water,
and sat to dry in the sun, whilst Good undid his tin box, and produced
first a beautiful clean white shirt, just as it had left a London steam
laundry, and then some garments wrapped first in brown, then in white,
and finally in silver paper. We watched this undoing with the tenderest
interest and much speculation. One by one Good removed the dull husks
that hid their splendours, carefully folding and replacing each piece
of paper as he did so; and there at last lay, in all the majesty of its
golden epaulettes, lace, and buttons, a Commander of the Royal Navy’s
full-dress uniform--dress sword, cocked hat, shiny patent leather boots
and all. We literally gasped.
</p><p>‘_What!_’ we said, ‘_what!_ Are you going to put those things on?’
</p><p>‘Certainly,’ he answered composedly; ‘you see so much depends upon a
first impression, especially,’ he added, ‘as I observe that there are
ladies about. One at least of us ought to be decently dressed.’
</p><p>We said no more; we were simply dumbfounded, especially when we
considered the artful way in which Good had concealed the contents of
that box for all these months. Only one suggestion did we make--namely,
that he should wear his mail shirt next his skin. He replied that he
feared it would spoil the set of his coat, now carefully spread in the
sun to take the creases out, but finally consented to this precautionary
measure. The most amusing part of the affair, however, was to see
old Umslopogaas’s astonishment and Alphonse’s delight at Good’s
transformation. When at last he stood up in all his glory, even down to
the medals on his breast, and contemplated himself in the still waters
of the lake, after the fashion of the young gentleman in ancient
history, whose name I cannot remember, but who fell in love with his own
shadow, the old Zulu could no longer restrain his feelings.
</p><p>‘Oh, Bougwan!’ he said. ‘Oh, Bougwan! I always thought thee an ugly
little man, and fat--fat as the cows at calving time; and now thou art
like a blue jay when he spreads his tail out. Surely, Bougwan, it hurts
my eyes to look at thee.’
</p><p>Good did not much like this allusion to his fat, which, to tell the
truth, was not very well deserved, for hard exercise had brought him
down three inches; but on the whole he was pleased at Umslopogaas’s
admiration. As for Alphonse, he was quite delighted.
</p><p>‘Ah! but Monsieur has the beautiful air--the air of the warrior. It
is the ladies who will say so when we come to get ashore. Monsieur is
complete; he puts me in mind of my heroic grand--’
</p><p>Here we stopped Alphonse.
</p><p>As we gazed upon the beauties thus revealed by Good, a spirit of
emulation filled our breasts, and we set to work to get ourselves up
as well as we could. The most, however, that we were able to do was to
array ourselves in our spare suits of shooting clothes, of which we
each had several, all the fine clothes in the world could never make it
otherwise than scrubby and insignificant; but Sir Henry looked what he
is, a magnificent man in his nearly new tweed suit, gaiters, and boots.
Alphonse also got himself up to kill, giving an extra turn to his
enormous moustaches. Even old Umslopogaas, who was not in a general way
given to the vain adorning of his body, took some oil out of the lantern
and a bit of tow, and polished up his head-ring with it till it shone
like Good’s patent leather boots. Then he put on the mail shirt Sir
Henry had given him and his ‘moocha’, and, having cleaned up Inkosi-kaas
a little, stood forth complete.
</p><p>All this while, having hoisted the sail again as soon as we had finished
bathing, we had been progressing steadily for the land, or, rather, for
the mouth of a great river. Presently--in all about an hour and a half
after the little boat had left us--we saw emerging from the river
or harbour a large number of boats, ranging up to ten or twelve tons
burden. One of these was propelled by twenty-four oars, and most of
the rest sailed. Looking through the glass we soon made out that the
row-boat was an official vessel, her crew being all dressed in a sort of
uniform, whilst on the half-deck forward stood an old man of venerable
appearance, and with a flowing white beard, and a sword strapped to his
side, who was evidently the commander of the craft. The other boats were
apparently occupied by people brought out by curiosity, and were rowing
or sailing towards us as quickly as they could.
</p><p>‘Now for it,’ said I. ‘What is the betting? Are they going to be
friendly or to put an end to us?’
</p><p>Nobody could answer this question, and, not liking the warlike
appearance of the old gentleman and his sword, we felt a little anxious.
</p><p>Just then Good spied a school of hippopotami on the water about two
hundred yards off us, and suggested that it would not be a bad plan to
impress the natives with a sense of our power by shooting some of them
if possible. This, unluckily enough, struck us as a good idea, and
accordingly we at once got out our eight-bore rifles, for which we still
had a few cartridges left, and prepared for action. There were four
of the animals, a big bull, a cow, and two young ones, one three
parts grown. We got up to them without difficulty, the great animals
contenting themselves with sinking down into the water and rising again
a few yards farther on; indeed, their excessive tameness struck me as
being peculiar. When the advancing boats were about five hundred yards
away, Sir Henry opened the ball by firing at the three parts grown young
one. The heavy bullet struck it fair between the eyes, and, crashing
through the skull, killed it, and it sank, leaving a long train of blood
behind it. At the same moment I fired at the cow, and Good at the
old bull. My shot took effect, but not fatally, and down went the
hippopotamus with a prodigious splashing, only to rise again presently
blowing and grunting furiously, dyeing all the water round her crimson,
when I killed her with the left barrel. Good, who is an execrable shot,
missed the head of the bull altogether, the bullet merely cutting the
side of his face as it passed. On glancing up, after I had fired my
second shot, I perceived that the people we had fallen among were
evidently ignorant of the nature of firearms, for the consternation
caused by our shots and their effect upon the animals was prodigious.
Some of the parties in the boats began to cry out in fear; others turned
and made off as hard as they could; and even the old gentleman with the
sword looked greatly puzzled and alarmed, and halted his big row-boat.
We had, however, but little time for observation, for just then the old
bull, rendered furious by the wound he had received, rose fair within
forty yards of us, glaring savagely. We all fired, and hit him in
various places, and down he went, badly wounded. Curiosity now began to
overcome the fear of the onlookers, and some of them sailed on up close
to us, amongst these being the man and woman whom we had first seen a
couple of hours or so before, who drew up almost alongside. Just then
the great brute rose again within ten yards of their base, and instantly
with a roar of fury made at it open-mouthed. The woman shrieked, and the
man tried to give the boat way, but without success. In another second
I saw the huge red jaws and gleaming ivories close with a crunch on the
frail craft, taking an enormous mouthful out of its side and capsizing
it. Down went the boat, leaving its occupants struggling in the water.
Next moment, before we could do anything towards saving them, the huge
and furious creature was up again and making open-mouthed at the poor
girl, who was struggling in the water. Lifting my rifle just as the
grinding jaws were about to close on her, I fired over her head right
down the hippopotamus’s throat. Over he went, and commenced turning
round and round, snorting, and blowing red streams of blood through his
nostrils. Before he could recover himself, however, I let him have the
other barrel in the side of the throat, and that finished him. He
never moved or struggled again, but instantly sank. Our next effort
was directed towards saving the girl, the man having swum off towards
another boat; and in this we were fortunately successful, pulling
her into the canoe (amidst the shouts of the spectators) considerably
exhausted and frightened, but otherwise unhurt.
</p><p>Meanwhile the boats had gathered together at a distance, and we could
see that the occupants, who were evidently much frightened,
were consulting what to do. Without giving them time for further
consideration, which we thought might result unfavourably to ourselves,
we instantly took our paddles and advanced towards them, Good standing
in the bow and taking off his cocked hat politely in every direction,
his amiable features suffused by a bland but intelligent smile. Most of
the craft retreated as we advanced, but a few held their ground, while
the big row-boat came on to meet us. Presently we were alongside, and
I could see that our appearance--and especially Good’s and
Umslopogaas’s--filled the venerable-looking commander with astonishment,
not unmixed with awe. He was dressed after the same fashion as the man
we first met, except that his shirt was not made of brown cloth, but of
pure white linen hemmed with purple. The kilt, however, was identical,
and so were the thick rings of gold around the arm and beneath the
left knee. The rowers wore only a kilt, their bodies being naked to
the waist. Good took off his hat to the old gentleman with an extra
flourish, and inquired after his health in the purest English, to
which he replied by laying the first two fingers of his right hand
horizontally across his lips and holding them there for a moment, which
we took as his method of salutation. Then he also addressed some
remarks to us in the same soft accents that had distinguished our first
interviewer, which we were forced to indicate we did not understand by
shaking our heads and shrugging our shoulders. This last Alphonse,
being to the manner born, did to perfection, and in so polite a way that
nobody could take any offence. Then we came a standstill, till I, being
exceedingly hungry, thought I might as well call attention to the fact,
and did so first by opening my mouth and pointing down it, and then
rubbing my stomach. These signals the old gentleman clearly understood,
for he nodded his head vigorously, and pointed towards the harbour; and
at the same time one of the men on his boat threw us a line and motioned
to us to make it fast, which we did. The row-boat then took us in tow,
and went with great rapidity towards the mouth of the river, accompanied
by all the other boats. In about twenty minutes more we reached the
entrance to the harbour, which was crowded with boats full of people who
had come out to see us. We observed that all the occupants were more or
less of the same type, though some were fairer than others. Indeed, we
noticed certain ladies whose skin was of a most dazzling whiteness;
and the darkest shade of colour which we saw was about that of a rather
swarthy Spaniard. Presently the wide river gave a sweep, and when it did
so an exclamation of astonishment and delight burst from our lips as we
caught our first view of the place that we afterwards knew as Milosis,
or the Frowning City (from mi, which means city, and losis, a frown).
</p><p>At a distance of some five hundred yards from the river’s bank rose a
sheer precipice of granite, two hundred feet or so in height, which had
no doubt once formed the bank itself--the intermediate space of land
now utilized as docks and roadways having been gained by draining, and
deepening and embanking the stream.
</p><p>On the brow of this precipice stood a great building of the same granite
that formed the cliff, built on three sides of a square, the fourth
side being open, save for a kind of battlement pierced at its base by a
little door. This imposing place we afterwards discovered was the palace
of the queen, or rather of the queens. At the back of the palace the
town sloped gently upwards to a flashing building of white marble,
crowned by the golden dome which we had already observed. The city was,
with the exception of this one building, entirely built of red granite,
and laid out in regular blocks with splendid roadways between. So far
as we could see also the houses were all one-storied and detached, with
gardens round them, which gave some relief to the eye wearied with the
vista of red granite. At the back of the palace a road of extraordinary
width stretched away up the hill for a distance of a mile and a half or
so, and appeared to terminate at an open space surrounding the gleaming
building that crowned the hill. But right in front of us was the
wonder and glory of Milosis--the great staircase of the palace, the
magnificence of which took our breath away. Let the reader imagine,
if he can, a splendid stairway, sixty-five feet from balustrade to
balustrade, consisting of two vast flights, each of one hundred and
twenty-five steps of eight inches in height by three feet broad,
connected by a flat resting-place sixty feet in length, and running from
the palace wall on the edge of the precipice down to meet a waterway
or canal cut to its foot from the river. This marvellous staircase
was supported upon a single enormous granite arch, of which the
resting-place between the two flights formed the crown; that is, the
connecting open space lay upon it. From this archway sprang a subsidiary
flying arch, or rather something that resembled a flying arch in shape,
such as none of us had seen in any other country, and of which the
beauty and wonder surpassed all that we had ever imagined. Three hundred
feet from point to point, and no less than five hundred and fifty round
the curve, that half-arc soared touching the bridge it supported for a
space of fifty feet only, one end resting on and built into the parent
archway, and the other embedded in the solid granite of the side of the
precipice.
</p><p>This staircase with its supports was, indeed, a work of which any living
man might have been proud, both on account of its magnitude and its
surpassing beauty. Four times, as we afterwards learnt, did the work,
which was commenced in remote antiquity, fail, and was then abandoned
for three centuries when half-finished, till at last there rose a
youthful engineer named Rademas, who said that he would complete it
successfully, and staked his life upon it. If he failed he was to be
hurled from the precipice he had undertaken to scale; if he succeeded,
he was to be rewarded by the hand of the king’s daughter. Five years was
given to him to complete the work, and an unlimited supply of labour and
material. Three times did his arch fall, till at last, seeing failure
to be inevitable, he determined to commit suicide on the morrow of the
third collapse. That night, however, a beautiful woman came to him in a
dream and touched his forehead, and of a sudden he saw a vision of the
completed work, and saw too through the masonry and how the difficulties
connected with the flying arch that had hitherto baffled his genius were
to be overcome. Then he awoke and once more commenced the work, but on
a different plan, and behold! he achieved it, and on the last day of
the five years he led the princess his bride up the stair and into
the palace. And in due course he became king by right of his wife, and
founded the present Zu-Vendi dynasty, which is to this day called the
‘House of the Stairway’, thus proving once more how energy and talent
are the natural stepping-stones to grandeur. And to commemorate his
triumph he fashioned a statue of himself dreaming, and of the fair woman
who touched him on the forehead, and placed it in the great hall of the
palace, and there it stands to this day.
</p><p>Such was the great stair of Milosis, and such the city beyond. No wonder
they named it the ‘Frowning City’, for certainly those mighty works in
solid granite did seem to frown down upon our littleness in their sombre
splendour. This was so even in the sunshine, but when the storm-clouds
gathered on her imperial brow Milosis looked more like a supernatural
dwelling-place, or some imagining of a poet’s brain, than what she is--a
mortal city, carven by the patient genius of generations out of the red
silence of the mountain side.
