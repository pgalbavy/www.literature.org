<p>The autumn afternoon was fading into evening. It had been cloudy
weather, but the clouds had softened and broken up. Now they were lost
in slowly darkening blue. The sea was perfectly and utterly still. It
seemed to sleep, but in its sleep it still waxed with the rising tide.
The eye could not mark its slow increase, but Beatrice, standing upon
the farthest point of the Dog Rocks, idly noted that the long brown
weeds which clung about their sides began to lift as the water took
their weight, till at last the delicate pattern floated out and lay like
a woman’s hair upon the green depth of sea. Meanwhile a mist was growing
dense and soft upon the quiet waters. It was not blown up from the west,
it simply grew like the twilight, making the silence yet more silent and
blotting away the outlines of the land. Beatrice gave up studying the
seaweed and watched the gathering of these fleecy hosts.
</p><p>“What a curious evening,” she said aloud to herself, speaking in a low
full voice. “I have not seen one like it since mother died, and that
is seven years ago. I’ve grown since then, grown every way,” and she
laughed somewhat sadly, and looked at her own reflection in the quiet
water.
</p><p>She could not have looked at anything more charming, for it would have
been hard to find a girl of nobler mien than Beatrice Granger as on this
her twenty-second birthday, she stood and gazed into that misty sea.
</p><p>Of rather more than middle height, and modelled like a statue, strength
and health seemed to radiate from her form. But it was her face with the
stamp of intellect and power shadowing its woman’s loveliness that must
have made her remarkable among women even more beautiful than herself.
There are many girls who have rich brown hair, like some autumn leaf
here and there just yellowing into gold, girls whose deep grey eyes can
grow tender as a dove’s, or flash like the stirred waters of a northern
sea, and whose bloom can bear comparison with the wilding rose. But few
can show a face like that which upon this day first dawned on Geoffrey
Bingham to his sorrow and his hope. It was strong and pure and sweet as
the keen sea breath, and looking on it one must know that beneath this
fair cloak lay a wit as fair. And yet it was all womanly; here was not
the hard sexless stamp of the “cultured” female. She who owned it was
capable of many things. She could love and she could suffer, and if need
be, she could dare or die. It was to be read upon that lovely brow and
face, and in the depths of those grey eyes--that is, by those to whom
the book of character is open, and who wish to study it.
</p><p>But Beatrice was not thinking of her loveliness as she gazed into the
water. She knew that she was beautiful of course; her beauty was too
obvious to be overlooked, and besides it had been brought home to her in
several more or less disagreeable ways.
</p><p>“Seven years,” she was thinking, “since the night of the ‘death fog;’
that was what old Edward called it, and so it was. I was only so high
then,” and following her thoughts she touched herself upon the breast.
“And I was happy too in my own way. Why can’t one always be fifteen,
and believe everything one is told?” and she sighed. “Seven years and
nothing done yet. Work, work, and nothing coming out of the work, and
everything fading away. I think that life is very dreary when one has
lost everything, and found nothing, and loves nobody. I wonder what it
will be like in another seven years.”
</p><p>She covered her eyes with her hands, and then taking them away, once
more looked at the water. Such light as struggled through the fog
was behind her, and the mist was thickening. At first she had some
difficulty in tracing her own likeness upon the glassy surface, but
gradually she marked its outline. It stretched away from her, and its
appearance was as though she herself were lying on her back in the water
wrapped about with the fleecy mist. “How curious it seems,” she thought;
“what is it that reflection reminds me of with the white all round it?”
</p><p>Next instant she gave a little cry and turned sharply away. She knew
now. It recalled her mother as she had last seen her seven years ago.
