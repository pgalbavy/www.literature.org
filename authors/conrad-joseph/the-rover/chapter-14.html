<p>The midnight meeting of Lieutenant Réal and Peyrol was perfectly
silent. Peyrol, sitting on the bench outside the salle, had heard
the footsteps coming up the Madrague track long before the lieutenant
became visible. But he did not move. He did not even look at him.
The lieutenant, unbuckling his sword-belt, sat down without uttering
a word. The moon, the only witness of the meeting, seemed to shine
on two friends so identical in thought and feeling that they could
commune with each other without words. It was Peyrol who spoke
first.</p>

<p>"You are up to time."</p>

<p>"I had the deuce of a job to hunt up the people and get the certificate
stamped. Everything was shut up. The Port-Admiral was giving a
dinner-party, but he came out to speak to me when I sent in my
name. And all the time, do you know, gunner, I was wondering whether
I would ever see you again in my life. Even after I had the certificate,
such as it is, in my pocket, I wondered whether I would."</p>

<p>"What the devil did you think was going to happen to me?" growled
Peyrol, perfunctorily. He had thrown the incomprehensible stable
fork under the narrow bench, and with his feet drawn in he could
feel it there, lying against the wall.</p>

<p>"No, the question with me was whether I would ever come here
again."</p>

<p>Réal drew a folded paper from his pocket and dropped it on the
bench. Peyrol picked it up carelessly. That thing was meant only
to throw dust into Englishmen’s eyes. The lieutenant, after a
moment’s silence, went on with the sincerity of a man who suffered
too much to keep his trouble to himself.</p>

<p>"I had a hard struggle."</p>

<p>"That was too late," said Peyrol, very positively. "You had to
come back here for very shame; and now you have come, you don’t
look very happy."</p>

<p>"Never mind my looks, gunner. I have made up my mind."</p>

<p>A ferocious, not unpleasing thought flashed through Peyrol’s
mind. It was that this intruder on the Escampobar sinister solitude
in which he, Peyrol, kept order, was under a delusion. Mind! Pah!
His mind had nothing to do with his return. He had returned because,
in Catherine’s words, "death had made a sign to him." Meantime,
Lieutenant Réal raised his hat to wipe his moist brow.</p>

<p>"I made up my mind to play the part of dispatch-bearer. As you
have said yourself, Peyrol, one could not bribe a man &mdash;I
mean an honest man&mdash;so you will have to find the vessel and leave
the rest to me. In two or three days.... You are under a moral
obligation to let me have your tartane."</p>

<p>Peyrol did not answer. He was thinking that Réal had got his
sign, but whether it meant death from starvation or disease on
board an English prison hulk, or in some other way, it was impossible
to say. This naval officer was not a man he could trust; to whom
he could, for instance, tell the story of his prisoner and what
he had done with him. Indeed, the story was altogether incredible.
The Englishman commanding that corvette had no visible, conceivable
or probable reason for sending a boat ashore to the cove of all
places in the world. Peyrol himself could hardly believe that
it had happened. And he thought: "If I were to tell that lieutenant
he would only think that I was an old scoundrel who had been in
treasonable communication with the English for God knows how long.
No words of mine could persuade him that this was as unforeseen
to me as the moon falling from the sky."</p>

<p>"I wonder," he burst out, but not very loud, "what made you keep
on coming back here time after time!" Réal leaned his back against
the wall and folded his arms in the familiar attitude of their
leisurely talks.</p>

<p>"Ennui, Peyrol," he said in a far-away tone. "Confounded boredom."</p>

<p>Peyrol also, as if unable to resist the force of example, assumed
the same attitude, and said:</p>

<p>"You seem to be a man that makes no friends."</p>

<p>"True, Peyrol. I think I am that sort of man."</p>

<p>"What, no friends at all? Not even a little friend of any sort?"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Réal leaned the back of his head against the wall
and made no answer. Peyrol got on his legs.</p>

<p>"Oh then, it wouldn’t matter to anybody if you were to disappear
for years in an English hulk. And so if I were to give you my
tartane you would go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would go this moment."</p>

<p>Peyrol laughed quite loud, tilting his head back. All at once
the laugh stopped short and the lieutenant was amazed to see him
reel as though he had been hit in the chest. While giving way
to his bitter mirth, the rover had caught sight of Arlette’s face
at the open window of the lieutenant’s room. He sat heavily on
the bench and was unable to make a sound. The lieutenant was startled
enough to detach the back of his head from the wall to look at
him. Peyrol stooped low suddenly and began to drag the stable
fork from its concealment. Then he got on his feet and stood leaning
on it, glaring down at Réal, who gazed upwards with languid surprise.
Peyrol was asking himself, "Shall I pick him up on that pair of
prongs, carry him down and fling him in the sea?" He felt suddenly
overcome by a heaviness of arms and a heaviness of heart that
made all movement impossible. His stiffened and powerless limbs
refused all service.... Let Catherine look after her niece. He
was sure that the old woman was not very far away. The lieutenant
saw him absorbed in examining the points of the prongs carefully.
There was something queer about all this.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Peyrol! What’s the matter?" he couldn’t help asking.</p>

<p>"I was just looking," said Peyrol. "One prong is chipped a little.
I found this thing in a most unlikely place."</p>

<p>The lieutenant still gazed at him curiously.</p>

<p>"I know! It was under the bench."</p>

<p>"H’m," said Peyrol, who had recovered some self-control. "It
belongs to Scevola."</p>

<p>"Does it?" said the lieutenant, falling back again.</p>

<p>His interest seemed exhausted, but Peyrol didn’t move.</p>

<p>"You go about with a face fit for a funeral," he remarked suddenly
in a deep voice. "Hang it all, lieutenant, I have heard you laugh
once or twice, but the devil take me if I ever saw you smile.
It is as if you had been bewitched in your cradle."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Réal got up as if moved by a spring. "Bewitched,"
he repeated, standing very stiff: "in my cradle, eh?... No, I
don’t think it was so early as that."</p>

<p>He walked forward with a tense still face straight at Peyrol
as though he had been blind. Startled, the rover stepped out of
the way and, turning on his heels, followed him with his eyes.
The lieutenant paced on, as if drawn by a magnet, in the direction
of the door of the house. Peyrol, his eyes fastened on Réal’s
back, let him nearly reach it before he called out tentatively:
"I say, lieutenant!" To his extreme surprise, Réal swung round
as if to a touch.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," he answered, also in an undertone. "We will have to
discuss that matter to-morrow."</p>

<p>Peyrol, who had approached him close, said in a whisper which
sounded quite fierce: "Discuss? No! We will have to carry it out
to-morrow. I have been waiting half the night just to tell you
that."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Réal nodded. The expression on his face was so stony
that Peyrol doubted whether he had understood. He added:</p>

<p>"It isn’t going to be child’s play." The lieutenant was about
to open the door when Peyrol said: "A moment," and again the lieutenant
turned about silently.</p>

<p>"Michel is sleeping somewhere on the stairs. Will you just stir
him up and tell him I am waiting outside. We two will have to
finish our night on board the tartane, and start work at break
of day to get her ready for sea. Yes, lieutenant, by noon. In
twelve hours’ time you will be saying good-bye to la belle France."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Réal’s eyes, staring over his shoulder, seemed glazed
and motionless in the moonlight like the eyes of a dead man. But
he went in. Peyrol heard presently sounds within of somebody staggering
in the passage and Michel projected himself outside headlong,
but after a stumble or two pulled up scratching his head and looking
on every side in the moonlight without perceiving Peyrol, who
was regarding him from a distance of five feet. At last Peyrol
said:</p>

<p>"Come, wake up! Michel! Michel!"</p>

<p>"Voilà, notre maître."</p>

<p>"Look at what I have picked up," said Peyrol. "Take it and put
it away."</p>

<p>Michel didn’t offer to touch the stable fork extended to him
by Peyrol.</p>

<p>"What’s the matter with you?" asked Peyrol.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing! Only last time I saw it, it was on Scevola’s
shoulder." He glanced up at the sky. "A little better than an
hour ago."</p>

<p>"What was he doing?"</p>

<p>"Going into the yard to put it away."</p>

<p>"Well, now <em>you</em> go into the yard to put it away," said
Peyrol, "and don’t be long about it." He waited with his hand
over his chin till his henchman reappeared before him. But Michel
had not got over his surprise.</p>

<p>"He was going to bed, you know," he said.</p>

<p>"Eh, what? He was going.... He hasn’t gone to sleep in the stable,
perchance? He does sometimes, you know."</p>

<p>"I know. I looked. He isn’t there," said Michel, very awake and
round-eyed.</p>

<p>Peyrol started towards the cove. After three or four steps he
turned round and found Michel motionless where he had left him.</p>

<p>"Come on," he cried, "we will have to fit the tartane for sea
directly the day breaks."</p>

<p>Standing in the lieutenant’s room just clear of the open window,
Arlette listened to their voices and to the sound of their footsteps
diminishing down the slope. Before they had quite died out she
became aware of a light tread approaching the door of the room.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Réal had spoken the truth. While in Toulon he had
more than once said to himself that he could never go back to
that fatal farmhouse. His mental state was quite pitiable. Honour,
decency, every principle, forbade him to trifle with the feelings
of a poor creature with her mind darkened by a very terrifying,
atrocious and, as it were, guilty experience. And suddenly he
had given way to a base impulse and had betrayed himself by kissing
her hand! He recognized with despair that this was no trifling,
but that the impulse had come from the very depths of his being.
It was an awful discovery for a man who on emerging from boyhood
had laid for himself a rigidly straight line of conduct amongst
the unbridled passions and the clamouring falsehoods of revolution
which seemed to have destroyed in him all capacity for the softer
emotions. Taciturn and guarded, he had formed no intimacies. Relations
he had none. He had kept clear of social connections. It was in
his character. At first he visited Escampobar because when he
took his leave he had no place in the world to go to, and a few
days there were a complete change from the odious town. He enjoyed
the sense of remoteness from ordinary mankind. He had developed
a liking for old Peyrol, the only man who had nothing to do with
the Revolution&mdash;who had not even seen it at work. The sincere
lawlessness of the ex-Brother of the Coast was refreshing. That
one was neither a hypocrite nor a fool. When he robbed or killed,
it was not in the name of the sacred revolutionary principles
or for the love of humanity.</p>

<p>Of course Réal had remarked at once Arlette’s black, profound
and unquiet eyes and the persistent dim smile on her lips, her
mysterious silences and the rare sound of her voice which made
a caress of every word. He heard something of her story from the
reluctant Peyrol who did not care to talk about it. It awakened
in Réal more bitter indignation than pity. But it stimulated his
imagination, confirmed him in that scorn and angry loathing for
the Revolution he had felt as a boy and had nursed secretly ever
since. She attracted him by her unapproachable aspect. Later he
tried not to notice that, in common parlance, she was inclined
to hang about him. He used to catch her gazing at him stealthily.
But he was free from masculine vanity. It was one day in Toulon
that it suddenly dawned on him what her mute interest in his person
might mean. He was then sitting outside a café sipping some drink
or other with three or four officers, and not listening to their
uninteresting conversation. He marvelled that this sort of illumination
should come to him like this, under these circumstances; that
he should have thought of her while seated in the street with
these men round him, in the midst of more or less professional
talk! And then it suddenly dawned on him that he had been thinking
of nothing but that woman for days.</p>

<p>He got up brusquely, flung the money for his drink on the table,
and without a word left his companions. But he had the reputation
of an eccentric man and they did not even comment on his abrupt
departure. It was a clear evening. He walked straight out of town,
and that night wandered beyond the fortifications, not noticing
the direction he took. All the countryside was asleep. There was
not a human being stirring, and his progress in that desolate
part of the country between the forts could have been traced only
by the barking of dogs in the rare hamlets and scattered habitations.</p>

<p>"What has become of my rectitude, of my self-respect, of the
firmness of my mind?" he asked himself pedantically. "I have let
myself be mastered by an unworthy passion for a mere mortal envelope
stained with crime and without a mind!"</p>

<p>His despair at this awful discovery was so profound that if he
had not been in uniform he would have tried to commit suicide
with the small pistol he had in his pocket. He shrank from the
act, and the thought of the sensation it would produce, from the
gossip and comments it would raise, the dishonouring suspicions
it would provoke. "No," he said to himself, "what I will have
to do is to unmark my linen, put on civilian clothes and walk
out much farther away, miles beyond the forts, hide myself in
some wood or in an overgrown hollow and put an end to my life
there. The gendarmes or a garde-champêtre discovering my body
after a few days, a complete stranger without marks of identity,
and being unable to find out anything about me, will give me an
obscure burial in some village churchyard."</p>

<p>On that resolution he turned back abruptly and at daybreak found
himself outside the gate of the town. He had to wait till it was
opened, and then the morning was so far advanced that he had to
go straight to work at his office at the Toulon Admiralty. Nobody
noticed anything peculiar about him that day. He went through
his routine tasks with outward composure, but all the same he
never ceased arguing with himself. By the time he returned to
his quarters he had come to the conclusion that as an officer
in war-time he had no right to take his own life. His principles
would not permit him to do that. In this reasoning he was perfectly
sincere. During a deadly struggle against an irreconcilable enemy
his life belonged to his country. But there were moments when
his loneliness, haunted by the forbidden vision of Escampobar
with the figure of that distracted girl, mysterious, awful, pale,
irresistible in her strangeness, passing along the walls, appearing
on the hill-paths, looking out of the window, became unbearable.
He spent hours of solitary anguish shut up in his quarters, and
the opinion amongst his comrades was that Réal’s misanthropy was
getting beyond all bounds.</p>

<p>One day it dawned upon him clearly that he could not stand this.
It affected his power of thinking. "I shall begin to talk nonsense
to people," he said to himself. "Hasn’t there been once a poor
devil who fell in love with a picture or a statue? He used to
go and contemplate it. His misfortune cannot be compared with
mine! Well, I will go to look at her as at a picture too; a picture
as untouchable as if it had been under glass." And he went on
a visit to Escampobar at the very first opportunity. He made up
for himself a repellent face, he clung to Peyrol for society,
out there on the bench, both with their arms folded and gazing
into space. But whenever Arlette crossed his line of sight it
was as if something had moved in his breast. Yet these visits
made life just bearable; they enabled him to attend to his work
without beginning to talk nonsense to people. He said to himself
that he was strong enough to rise above temptation, that he would
never overstep the line; but it had happened to him upstairs in
his room at the farm, to weep tears of sheer tenderness while
thinking of his fate. These tears would put out for a while the
gnawing fire of his passion. He assumed austerity like an armour
and in his prudence he, as a matter of fact, looked very seldom
at Arlette for fear of being caught in the act.</p>

<p>The discovery that she had taken to wandering at night had upset
him all the same, because that sort of thing was unaccountable.
It gave him a shock which unsettled, not his resolution, but his
fortitude. That morning he had allowed himself, while she was
waiting on him, to be caught looking at her, and then, losing
his self-control, had given her that kiss on the hand. Directly
he had done it he was appalled. He had overstepped the line. Under
the circumstances this was an absolute moral disaster. The full
consciousness of it came to him slowly. In fact, this moment of
fatal weakness was one of the reasons why he had let himself be
sent off so unceremoniously by Peyrol to Toulon. Even while crossing
over he thought the only thing was not to come back any more.
Yet while battling with himself he went on with the execution
of the plan. A bitter irony presided over his dual state. Before
leaving the Admiral, who had received him in full uniform in a
room lighted by a single candle, he was suddenly moved to say:
"I suppose if there is no other way I am authorized to go myself,"
and the Admiral had answered: "I didn’t contemplate that, but
if you are willing I don’t see any objection. I would only advise
you to go in uniform in the character of an officer entrusted
with dispatches. No doubt in time the Government would arrange
for your exchange. But bear in mind that it would be a long captivity,
and you must understand it might affect your promotion."</p>

<p>At the foot of the grand staircase in the lighted hall of the
official building Réal suddenly thought: "And now I must go back
to Escampobar." Indeed he had to go to Escampobar because the
false dispatches were there in the valise he had left behind.
He couldn’t go back to the Admiral and explain that he had lost
them. They would look on him as an unutterable idiot or a man
gone mad. While walking to the quay where the naval boat was waiting
for him he said to himself: "This, in truth, is my last visit
for years&mdash;perhaps for life."</p>

<p>Going back in the boat, notwithstanding that the breeze was very
light, he would not let the men take to the oars. He didn’t want
to return before the women had gone to bed. He said to himself
that the proper and honest thing to do was not to see Arlette
again. He even managed to persuade himself that his uncontrolled
impulse had had no meaning for that witless and unhappy creature.
She had neither started, nor exclaimed; she had made no sign.
She had remained passive and then she had backed away and sat
down quietly. He could not even remember that she had coloured
at all. As to himself, he had enough self-control to rise from
the table and go out without looking at her again. Neither did
she make a sign. What could startle that body without mind? She
had made nothing of it, he thought with self-contempt. "Body without
mind! Body without mind!" he repeated with angry derision directed
at himself. And all at once he thought: "No. It isn’t that. All
in her is mystery, seduction, enchantment. And then&mdash;what do I
care for her mind!"</p>

<p>This thought wrung from him a faint groan, so that the coxswain
asked respectfully: "Are you in pain, mon lieutenant?" "It’s nothing,"
he muttered and set his teeth with the desperation of a man under
torture.</p>

<p>While talking with Peyrol outside the house, the words "I won’t
see her again," and "body without mind," rang through his head.
By the time he had left Peyrol and walked up the stairs his endurance
was absolutely at an end. All he wanted was to be alone. Going
along the dark passage he noticed that the door of Catherine’s
room was standing ajar. But that did not arrest his attention.
He was approaching a state of insensibility. As he put his hand
on the door handle of his room he said to himself: "It will soon
be over!"</p>

<p>He was so tired out that he was almost unable to hold up his
head, and on going in he didn’t see Arlette, who stood against
the wall on one side of the window, out of the moonlight and in
the darkest corner of the room. He only became aware of somebody’s
presence in the room as she flitted past him with the faintest
possible rustle, when he staggered back two paces and heard behind
him the key being turned in the lock. If the whole house had fallen
into ruins, bringing him to the ground, he could not have been
more overwhelmed and, in a manner, more utterly bereft of all
his senses. The first that came back to him was the sense of touch
when Arlette seized his hand. He regained his hearing next. She
was whispering to him: "At last! At last! But you are careless.
If it had been Scevola instead of me in this room you would have
been dead now. I have seen him at work." He felt a significant
pressure on his hand, but he couldn’t see her properly yet, though
he was aware of her nearness with every fibre of his body. "It
wasn’t yesterday though," she added in a low tone. Then suddenly:
"Come to the window so that I may look at you."</p>

<p>A great square of moonlight lay on the floor. He obeyed the tug
like a little child. She caught hold of his other hand as it hung
by his side. He was rigid all over, without joints, and it did
not seem to him that he was breathing. With her face a little
below his, she stared at him closely, whispering gently: "Eugène,
Eugène," and suddenly the livid immobility of his face frightened
her. "You say nothing. You look ill. What is the matter? Are you
hurt?" She let go his insensitive hands and began to feel him
all over for evidence of some injury. She even snatched off his
hat and flung it away in her haste to discover that his head was
unharmed; but finding no sign of bodily damage, she calmed down
like a sensible, practical person. With her hands clasped round
his neck she hung back a little. Her little even teeth gleamed,
her black eyes, immensely profound, looked into his, not with
a transport of passion or fear, but with a sort of reposeful satisfaction,
with a searching and appropriating expression. He came back to
life with a low and reckless exclamation, felt horribly insecure
at once as if he were standing on a lofty pinnacle above a noise
as of breaking waves in his ears, in fear lest her fingers should
part and she would fall off and be lost to him for ever. He flung
his arms round her waist and hugged her close to his breast. In
the great silence, in the bright moonlight falling through the
window, they stood like that for a long, long time. He looked
at her head resting on his shoulder. Her eyes were closed, and
the expression of her unsmiling face was that of a delightful
dream, something infinitely ethereal, peaceful and, as it were,
eternal. Its appeal pierced his heart with a pointed sweetness.
"She is exquisite. It’s a miracle," he thought with a sort of
terror. "It’s impossible."</p>

<p>She made a movement to disengage herself, and instinctively he
resisted, pressing her closer to his breast. She yielded for a
moment and then tried again. He let her go. She stood at arm’s
length, her hands on his shoulders, and her charm struck him suddenly
as funny in the seriousness of expression as of a very capable,
practical woman.</p>

<p>"All this is very well," she said in a business-like undertone.
"We will have to think how to get away from here. I don’t mean
now, this moment," she added, feeling his slight start. "Scevola
is thirsting for your blood." She detached one hand to point a
finger at the inner wall of the room, and lowered her voice. "He’s
there, you know. Don’t trust Peyrol either. I was looking at you
two out there. He has changed. I can trust him no longer." Her
murmur vibrated. "He and Catherine behave strangely. I don’t know
what came to them. He doesn’t talk to me. When I sit down near
him he turns his shoulder to me...."</p>

<p>She felt Réal sway under her hands, paused in concern and said:
"You are tired." But as he didn’t move, she actually led him to
a chair, pushed him into it, and sat on the floor at his feet.
She rested her head against his knees and kept possession of one
of his hands. A sigh escaped her. "I knew this was going to be,"
she said very low. "But I was taken by surprise."</p>

<p>"Oh, you knew it was going to be," he repeated faintly.</p>

<p>"Yes! I had prayed for it. Have you ever been prayed for, Eugène?"
she asked, lingering on his name with delight.</p>

<p>"Not since I was a child," answered Réal in a sombre tone.</p>

<p>"Oh yes! You have been prayed for to-day. I went down to the
church...." Réal could hardly believe his ears.... "The abbé let
me in by the sacristy door. He told me to renounce the world.
I was ready to renounce anything for you." Réal, turning his face
to the darkest part of the room, seemed to see the spectre of
fatality awaiting its time to move forward and crush that calm,
confident joy. He shook off the dreadful illusion, raised her
hand to his lips for a lingering kiss, and then asked:</p>

<p>"So you knew that it was going to be? Everything? Yes! And of
me, what did you think?"</p>

<p>She pressed strongly the hand to which she had been clinging
all the time. "I thought this."</p>

<p>"But what did you think of my conduct at times? You see, I did
not know what was going to be. I ... I was afraid," he added under
his breath.</p>

<p>"Conduct? What conduct? You came, you went. When you were not
here I thought of you, and when you were here I could look my
fill at you. I tell you I knew how it was going to be. I was not
afraid then."</p>

<p>"You went about with a little smile," he whispered, as one would
mention an inconceivable marvel.</p>

<p>"I was warm and quiet," murmured Arlette, as if on the borders
of dreamland. Tender murmurs flowed from her lips describing a
state of blissful tranquillity in phrases that sounded like the
veriest nonsense, incredible, convincing and soothing to Réal’s
conscience.</p>

<p>"You were perfect," it went on. "Whenever you came near me everything
seemed different."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? How different?"</p>

<p>"Altogether. The light, the very stones of the house, the hills,
the little flowers amongst the rocks! Even Nanette was different."</p>

<p>Nanette was a white Angora with long silken hair, a pet that
lived mostly in the yard.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nanette was different too," said Réal, whom delight in the
modulations of that voice had cut off from all reality, and even
from a consciousness of himself, while he sat stooping over that
head resting against his knee, the soft grip of her hand being
his only contact with the world.</p>

<p>"Yes. Prettier. It’s only the people...." She ceased on an uncertain
note. The crested wave of enchantment seemed to have passed over
his head, ebbing out faster than the sea, leaving the dreary expanses
of the sand. He felt a chill at the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>"What people?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They are so changed. Listen, to-night while you were away&mdash;why
did you go away? &mdash;I caught those two in the kitchen, saying
nothing to each other. That Peyrol&mdash;he is terrible."</p>

<p>He was struck by the tone of awe, by its profound conviction.
He could not know that Peyrol, unforeseen, unexpected, inexplicable,
had given by his mere appearance at Escampobar a moral and even
a physical jolt to all her being, that he was to her an immense
figure, like a messenger from the unknown entering the solitude
of Escampobar; something immensely strong, with inexhaustible
power, unaffected by familiarity and remaining invincible.</p>

<p>"He will say nothing, he will listen to nothing. He can do what
he likes."</p>

<p>"Can he?" muttered Réal.</p>

<p>She sat up on the floor, moved her head up and down several times
as if to say that there could be no doubt about that.</p>

<p>"Is he, too, thirsting for my blood?" asked Réal bitterly.</p>

<p>"No, no. It isn’t that. You could defend yourself. I could watch
over you. I have been watching over you. Only two nights ago I
thought I heard noises outside and I went downstairs, fearing
for you; your window was open but I could see nobody, and yet
I felt.... No, it isn’t that! It’s worse. I don’t know what he
wants to do. I can’t help being fond of him, but I begin to fear
him now. When he first came here and I saw him he was just the
same&mdash;only his hair was not so white&mdash;big, quiet. It seemed to
me that something moved in my head. He was gentle, you know. I
had to smile at him. It was as if I had recognized him. I said
to myself: ‘That’s he, the man himself.’"</p>

<p>"And when I came?" asked Réal with a feeling of dismay.</p>

<p>"You! You were expected," she said in a low tone, with a slight
tinge of surprise at the question, but still evidently thinking
of the Peyrol mystery. "Yes, I caught them at it last evening,
he and Catherine, in the kitchen, looking at each other and as
quiet as mice. I told him he couldn’t order me about. Oh, mon
chéri, mon chéri, don’t you listen to Peyrol&mdash;don’t let him...."</p>

<p>With only a slight touch on his knee she sprang to her feet.
Réal stood up too.</p>

<p>"He can do nothing to me," he mumbled.</p>

<p>"Don’t tell him anything. Nobody can guess what he thinks, and
now even I cannot tell what he means when he speaks. It was as
if he knew a secret." She put an accent into those words which
made Réal feel moved almost to tears. He repeated that Peyrol
could have no influence over him, and he felt that he was speaking
the truth. He was in the power of his own word. Ever since he
had left the Admiral in a gold-embroidered uniform, impatient
to return to his guests, he was on a service for which he had
volunteered. For a moment he had the sensation of an iron hoop
very tight round his chest. She peered at his face closely, and
it was more than he could bear.</p>

<p>"All right. I’ll be careful," he said. "And Catherine, is she
also dangerous?"</p>

<p>In the sheen of the moonlight Arlette, her neck and head above
the gleams of the fichu, visible and elusive, smiled at him and
moved a step closer.</p>

<p>"Poor Aunt Catherine," she said.... "Put your arm round me, Eugène....
She can do nothing. She used to follow me with her eyes always.
She thought I didn’t notice, but I did. And now she seems unable
to look me in the face. Peyrol too, for that matter. He used to
follow me with his eyes. Often I wondered what made them look
at me like that. Can you tell, Eugène? But it’s all changed now."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is all changed," said Réal in a tone which he tried
to make as light as possible. "Does Catherine know you are here?"</p>

<p>"When we went upstairs this evening I lay down all dressed on
my bed and she sat on hers. The candle was out, but in the moonlight
I could see her quite plainly with her hands on her lap. When
I could lie still no longer I simply got up and went out of the
room. She was still sitting at the foot of her bed. All I did
was to put my finger on my lips and then she dropped her head.
I don’t think I quite closed the door.... Hold me tighter, Eugène,
I am tired.... Strange, you know! Formerly, a long time ago, before
I ever saw you, I never rested and never felt tired." She stopped
her murmur suddenly and lifted a finger recommending silence.
She listened and Réal listened too, he did not know for what;
and in this sudden concentration on a point, all that had happened
since he had entered the room seemed to him a dream in its improbability
and in the more than lifelike force dreams have in their inconsequence.
Even the woman letting herself go on his arm seemed to have no
weight as it might have happened in a dream.</p>

<p>"She is there," breathed Arlette suddenly, rising on tiptoe to
reach up to his ear. "She must have heard you go past."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" asked Réal with the same intense secrecy.</p>

<p>"Outside the door. She must have been listening to the murmur
of our voices...." Arlette breathed into his ear as if relating
an enormity. "She told me one day that I was one of those who
are fit for no man’s arms."</p>

<p>At this he flung his other arm round her and looked into her
enlarged as if frightened eyes, while she clasped him with all
her strength and they stood like that a long time, lips pressed
on lips without a kiss and breathless in the closeness of their
contact. To him the stillness seemed to extend to the limits of
the universe. The thought "Am I going to die?" flashed through
that stillness and lost itself in it like a spark flying in an
everlasting night. The only result of it was the tightening of
his hold on Arlette.</p>

<p>An aged and uncertain voice was heard uttering the word "Arlette."
Catherine, who had been listening to their murmurs, could not
bear the long silence. They heard her trembling tones as distinctly
as though she had been in the room. Réal felt as if it had saved
his life. They separated silently.</p>

<p>"Go away," called out Arlette.</p>

<p>"Arl...."</p>

<p>"Be quiet," she cried louder. "You can do nothing."</p>

<p>"Arlette," came through the door, tremulous and commanding.</p>

<p>"She will wake up Scevola," remarked Arlette to Réal in a conversational
tone. And they both waited for sounds that did not come. Arlette
pointed her finger at the wall. "He is there, you know."</p>

<p>"He is asleep," muttered Réal. But the thought "I am lost" which
he formulated in his mind had no reference to Scevola.</p>

<p>"He is afraid," said Arlette contemptuously in an undertone.
"But that means little. He would quake with fright one moment
and rush out to do murder the next."</p>

<p>Slowly, as if drawn by the irresistible authority of the old
woman, they had been moving towards the door. Réal thought with
the sudden enlightenment of passion: "If she does not go now I
won’t have the strength to part from her in the morning." He had
no image of death before his eyes but of a long and intolerable
separation. A sigh verging upon a moan reached them from the other
side of the door and made the air around them heavy with sorrow
against which locks and keys will not avail.</p>

<p>"You had better go to her," he whispered in a penetrating tone.</p>

<p>"Of course I will," said Arlette with some feeling. "Poor old
thing. She and I have only each other in the world, but I am the
daughter here, she must do what I tell her." With one of her hands
on Réal’s shoulder she put her mouth close to the door and said
distinctly:</p>

<p>"I am coming directly. Go back to your room and wait for me,"
as if she had no doubt of being obeyed.</p>

<p>A profound silence ensued. Perhaps Catherine had gone already.
Réal and Arlette stood still for a whole minute as if both had
been changed into stone.</p>

<p>"Go now," said Réal in a hoarse, hardly audible voice.</p>

<p>She gave him a quick kiss on the lips, and again they stood like
a pair of enchanted lovers bewitched into immobility.</p>

<p>"If she stays on," thought Réal, "I shall never have the courage
to tear myself away, and then I shall have to blow my brains out."
But when at last she moved he seized her again and held her as
if she had been his very life. When he let her go he was appalled
by hearing a very faint laugh of her secret joy.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh?" he asked in a scared tone.</p>

<p>She stopped to answer him over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I laughed because I thought of all the days to come. Days and
days and days. Have you thought of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Réal faltered, like a man stabbed to the heart, holding
the door half open. And he was glad to have something to hold
on to.</p>

<p>She slipped out with a soft rustle of her silk skirt, but before
he had time to close the door behind her she put back her arm
for an instant. He had just time to press the palm of her hand
to his lips. It was cool. She snatched it away and he had the
strength of mind to shut the door after her. He felt like a man
chained to the wall and dying of thirst, from whom a cold drink
is snatched away. The room became dark suddenly. He thought, "A
cloud over the moon, a cloud over the moon, an enormous cloud,"
while he walked rigidly to the window, insecure and swaying as
if on a tight rope. After a moment he perceived the moon in a
sky on which there was no sign of the smallest cloud anywhere.
He said to himself: "I suppose I nearly died just now. But no,"
he went on thinking with deliberate cruelty, "oh no, I shall not
die. I shall only suffer, suffer, suffer...."</p>

<p>"Suffer, suffer." Only by stumbling against the side of the bed
did he discover that he had gone away from the window. At once
he flung himself on it violently with his face buried in the pillow,
which he bit to restrain the cry of distress about to burst through
his lips. Natures schooled into insensibility, when once overcome
by a mastering passion are, like vanquished giants, ready for
despair. He, a man on service, felt himself shrinking from death
and that doubt contained in itself all possible doubts of his
own fortitude. The only thing he knew was that he would be gone
to-morrow morning. He shuddered along his whole extended length,
then lay still gripping a handful of bedclothes in each hand to
prevent himself from leaping up in panicky restlessness. He was
saying to himself pedantically, "I must lie down and rest, I must
rest to have strength for to-morrow, I must rest," while the tremendous
struggle to keep still broke out in waves of perspiration on his
forehead. At last sudden oblivion must have descended on him because
he turned over and sat up suddenly with the sound of the word
"Ecoutez" in his ears.</p>

<p>A strange, dim, cold light filled the room; a light he did not
recognize for anything he had known before, and at the foot of
his bed stood a figure in dark garments with a dark shawl over
its head, with a fleshless predatory face and dark hollows for
its eyes, silent, expectant, implacable.... "Is this death?" he
asked himself, staring at it terrified. It resembled Catherine.
It said again: "Ecoutez." He took away his eyes from it, and glancing
down noticed that his clothes were torn open on his chest. He
would not look up at that thing, whatever it was, spectre or old
woman, and said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I hear you."</p>

<p>"You are an honest man." It was Catherine’s unemotional voice.
"The day has broken. You will go away."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said without raising his head.</p>

<p>"She is asleep," went on Catherine or whoever it was, "exhausted,
and you would have to shake her hard before she would wake. You
will go. You know," the voice continued inflexibly, "she is my
niece, and you know that there is death in the folds of her skirt
and blood about her feet. She is for no man."</p>

<p>Réal felt all the anguish of an unearthly experience. This thing
that looked like Catherine and spoke like a cruel fate had to
be faced. He raised his head in this light that seemed to him
appalling and not of this world.</p>

<p>"Listen well to me, you too," he said. "If she had all the madness
of the world and the sin of all the murders of the Revolution
on her shoulders I would still hug her to my breast. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>The apparition which resembled Catherine lowered and raised its
hooded head slowly. "There was a time when I could have hugged
l’enfer même to my breast. He went away. He had his vow. You have
only your honesty. You will go."</p>

<p>"I have my duty," said Lieutenant Réal in measured tones, as
if calmed by the excess of horror that old woman inspired him
with.</p>

<p>"Go without disturbing her, without looking at her."</p>

<p>"I will carry my shoes in my hand," he said. He sighed deeply
and felt as if sleepy. "It is very early," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Peyrol is already down at the well," announced Catherine. "What
can he be doing there all this time?" she added in a troubled
voice. Réal, with his feet now on the ground, gave her a side
glance; but she was already gliding away, and when he looked again
she had vanished from the room and the door was shut.</p>
