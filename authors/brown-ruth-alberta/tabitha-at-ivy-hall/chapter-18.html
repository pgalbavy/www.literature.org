<p>Christmas Day dawned bright and clear and with the first peep
of dawn Tabitha was out of bed, shaking Chrystobel vigorously
and calling, "Merry Christmas, lazybones! Wake up; it's day! The
rising bell has rung. Didn't you hear it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are dreaming," drowsily murmured the weary girl in the
other bed. "This is vacation time."</p>

<p>"But we have to get up just the same," laughed Tabitha. "I am
going to wake Carrie and the others."</p>

<p>She bounced across the room, flung open the door and stopped
abruptly, for suspended to the transom above her head hung two
immense tarlatan stockings, stuffed to the very brim with bundles
of all sorts and sizes. Across the hall from Carrie's transom
swung two more similar socks, and dangling against Bertha's door
was a third set.</p>

<p>Tabitha's wild shriek of surprise and delight brought the other
five girls standing in their beds, and Carrie chattered anxiously,
"Oh, what is the matter? Is the building on fire?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. Merry Christmas!" shouted the black-eyed girl, tugging
at the stocking marked with her name. "Open the door and see what
you find. Santa Claus surely has been here while we slept."</p>

<p>There was the sound of pattering feet in the three rooms, and
Chrystobel, now thoroughly awake, reached Tabitha's side just
as the door across the hall and the one next to theirs burst open
and four excited girls tumbled out. "Oh-h-h!" came a chorus of
long-drawn-out, rapturous sighs, as five pair of eager arms clasped
the bulky socks and jerked them loose.</p>

<p>"Ow!" shrieked Grace. "There is something awfully hard in mine.
It nearly knocked a hole in my head. It's a handkerchief box,
as sure as I am alive! Isn't it a dear? That is from Esther. Well,
Kitty, what are you doing down there?"</p>

<p>Tabitha, in nightgown and slippers, sat in the middle of the
floor, her huge stocking up-side down in her lap, and gifts scattered
all about her, as with shining eyes and trembling hands she unwrapped
each package in turn and gloated over its contents.</p>

<p>"A bunch of violets from Miss Pomeroy&mdash;she never forgets one
of us. There is Bertha's scarf that Cassandra tattled about&mdash;thank
you, Bertha! You must have worked like a Trojan on that. I never
could embroider silk. Here is a lovely handkerchief from Edith,
a book from June, a calendar from Estelle, a&mdash;a silk waist from
Carrie! You darling! Look at this lovely photo of Jessie and Julia,
and isn't the frame cute! A book of poems from Cassandra&mdash;she
said her gift ought to make me the happiest of all because it
would give me something new to recite&mdash;queer little, dear little
midget! A set of Shakespeare from the Leonard twins, a bonbon
dish from Vera. Here is a kiss in return. An apron from Grace,
three ties, a pair of gloves, chocolates, handkerchiefs,&mdash;oh,
did ever anyone see so many pretty things belonging to one person!
I am perfectly crazy with happiness. Here is one weenty package
more in the very tiptoe of my stocking&mdash;from Chrystobel&mdash;a ring
with a real ruby in it. If there were another thing to open, I
should be bawling in earnest. That is the first ring I ever owned,
girls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, there goes the first bell for breakfast," interrupted Bertha,
whisking up her stocking full of packages. "Ten minutes to dress
in! Run, scuttle, hustle! We mustn't be late</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'On Christmas morn, on Christmas morn'."

</p>
</div>
<p>She vanished abruptly, humming the beautiful carol; and three
of her companions, following her example, swept up their numerous
packages and flew away to dress.</p>

<p>Oh, that was a merry Christmas indeed for Tabitha! So bewildered,
so delighted, so happy was she, that teachers and scholars were
kept in a perfect gale of laughter during the breakfast hour,
for the spirit of the day was upon her, the love of her new friends,
manifested even in this material way, had touched her more deeply
than anyone could guess, and the effervescent gladness in her
heart had to bubble over. So they lingered long over the breakfast
table, loath to bring to a close such a happy hour; but at length
Miss Pomeroy rose, and smiling down into the expectant fares of
her six holiday charges, she said,</p>

<p>"I think the first thing on our morning's program is a long walk,
say to the park, and back. It is such a glorious day we mustn't
waste a moment of it, and we have all laughed so much we certainly
need some exercise. Miss Summers looks positively worn out with
mirth. By the time we get back, the postman and expressman may
have visited us again, and I am sure the minutes will pass more
quickly for each of us impatient children if we are busy doing
something. My box from home isn't here yet, and I am as eager
as you are to see what my nieces and nephews have sent me."</p>

<p>"A walk is just what I need to work off my surplus energy," declared
Tabitha enthusiastically. "May we take some crackers to feed the
swans?"</p>

<p>"And oh, may I take my kodak, my spandy new Christmas kodak,
for some pictures?" asked Grace eagerly. "I will snap you the
very first one if you will say yes."</p>

<p>"That is quite an inducement," laughed Miss Pomeroy. "Of course
you may take all the crackers you wish and as many kodaks as you
possess."</p>

<p>So thus armed, a merry eight left Ivy Hall a few moments later
and tramped gayly away to the park.</p>

<p>Upon their return, as the principal had predicted, they found
the reception hall table loaded down with letters and parcels
from the mail, while several express packages lay piled in a heap
on the floor.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Pomeroy," shouted Carrie, reaching the bundles first
and eagerly scanning the addresses. "Here is yours all right,
and it is heavy as lead. This one is addressed to Grace; here
is mine from Grandma; that is for Bertha; the big box is Pussy's,
and so is this little fellow, and the other box is addressed to
you and me together from papa. Here's a heap of letters. You can
distribute them, Vera; I am too excited. Where is the hammer?"</p>

<p>"Not so fast, not so fast!" laughed Miss Pomeroy. "John will
open these boxes and carry them up to your rooms where you can
unpack them all by yourselves. Take your mail and scamper!" She
shooed the capering girls up the wide stairway, where they were
followed very shortly by the smiling John, bearing their new cargo
of gifts.</p>

<p>"Oh, John, hurry, hurry!" coaxed Carrie, skipping about in a
fever of impatience. "I can't wait. Who is yours from, Puss? Tom?"</p>

<p>"No; it isn't his writing, anyway. There is a little package
from him and a letter&mdash;but&mdash;the big box is&mdash;from Reno, too."</p>

<p>"Why don't you open it and see who sent it?" asked Chrystobel,
busy herself with a big home box.</p>

<p>"I will as soon as I investigate the things Mrs. Vane sent me.
Aren't they pretty? A glove box with two pair of gloves in it.
The hair-ribbons are from Mrs. McKittrick; but this package, I
can't make out where it came from, either. It's a kodak! Grace,
a kodak like yours!"</p>

<p>"You will need a detective," said Grace, dropping her own treasures
to examine the mysterious packages of her companion. "What does
the tag say?"</p>

<p>"Just, 'A brand from the burning'. Isn't that queer?"</p>

<p>Carrie paused in her excited unpacking of goodies from home,
studied the little card for a moment and then said, "What will
you bet that isn't from the hermit?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't I think of that before?" murmured Tabitha, dropping
back on the floor, suddenly lost in thought.</p>

<p>"Well, Kitty, if you aren't the craziest!" exclaimed Vera at
length. "Here you sit mooning over that camera when you haven't
opened your brother's packages, or that big box I am dying to
see, or even looked at the things Carrie has dumped into your
lap from her folks."</p>

<p>Tabitha roused with a start and immediately tore off the coverings
of the second mysterious box, saying with a smile, "I am keeping
the best for dessert. I like to guess at what is inside each parcel
before I open it. Oh, what a pretty hat!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it a darling! And look at that pretty dress goods! That
is all the rage now."</p>

<p>"Chrystie, see Kitty's new shoes. Aren't they fine?"</p>

<p>"A whole outfit," murmured Grace, half enviously.</p>

<p>"Yes, and here is an envelope, Puss," added Carrie. "That ought
to tell who sent it."</p>

<p>Tabitha mechanically broke the seal of the envelope bearing her
name in the same writing as that on the outside of the box, and
a twenty dollar bill dropped into her lap. "That is all there
is in it," she said, shaking the paper again. "No, it isn't. Here
is a little scrap which reads, 'For dressmaker's bills'. Now isn't
that provoking!"</p>

<p>"Provoking!" echoed Chrystobel. "I should call it luck!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean the money and things. Those are splendid.
But isn't it a shame not to know where they came from?"</p>

<p>"Why, didn't your brother send them?" asked Bertha in surprise,
for she had been so deeply engrossed with her own gifts that only
snatches of her companions' conversation had reached her.</p>

<p>"No, that isn't a bit like his writing, you see; and besides,
he couldn't afford such things."</p>

<p>"Maybe Tom's letter tells," Carrie ventured. "Why don't you read
it and see?"</p>

<p>"I had forgotten," laughed Tabitha, looking foolish, and hastily
tearing open the letter in her lap. Then the rosy color in her
cheeks paled, her eyes grew big with amazement, and her breath
came in quick gasps. "Dad sent them," was all she said, and as
if doubting the truth of her own statement, she read again the
last paragraph of the busy brother's brief note:</p>

<p>"This is a poor apology for a letter, Puss, but if I get it off
in this next mail I haven't time for anything lengthy. I suppose
by this time you have received the book I mailed you yesterday,
and I hope the <em>big surprise</em> arrives in season to help
you enjoy Christmas Day. What do you think! Dad stopped at Reno
on his way back from another trip East, and he called on me to
go shopping with him this morning. He himself selected the dress,
but deferred to my notions in regard to the other frills, so if
they don't suit, blame me. I noticed that most of the girls in
Reno were wearing those fuzzy hats, so at my suggestion Dad got
one to match your dress. I thought you would prefer a brown suit,
but he wanted blue, and blue it is. I showed him around town and
took him through the college buildings, and when he was gone I
found fifty dollars in greenbacks on my dresser&mdash;my Christmas
gift from him."</p>

<p>Tabitha slowly folded the paper, dropped it down into the box
with its precious gifts, and lifting her shining eyes to the faces
of her curious mates, she whispered softly, "I think I am perfectly
happy!"</p>

<p>"And so are we," cried Chrystobel impulsively. "This has been
the loveliest Christmas vacation I can remember. I wouldn't have
missed staying here for anything."</p>

<p>"Nor I!" echoed Grace and Vera in the same breath, while Carrie
and Bertha smiled their happiness.</p>

<p>Then came the grand dinner, and after that the games. They danced,
they sang, they played everything they could think of, they messed
in the kitchen, bribing the cook to surrender her domains to them
for a candy pull, they inveigled the stately principal and shy
Miss Summers into their romps, and how they did enjoy every minute
of the gala day! But like all other days, it came to an end at
last, and as the laughing group of weary merrymakers climbed the
wide stairway at the bedtime hour, Carrie, who had lingered a
moment behind the others in the hall below, bounded up the steps,
calling excitedly, "Oh, girls, Miss Pomeroy says we don't have
to sleep in our own rooms tonight, but can pair off any way we
want to, and sleep wherever we choose. Isn't that great fun? Whom
will you take, Puss?"</p>

<p>Tabitha stopped abruptly on the stairs. "Oh, I can have Carrie
all to myself tonight," she thought to herself, but as she opened
her lips to speak, she saw Chrystobel's eyes fixed wistfully upon
her own, and suddenly there rose before her a vision of her room-mate's
self-sacrifice in electing to spend the holidays at school when
she knew what pleasures would have been hers at her own beautiful
home. She hesitated, looked at Carrie's eager face, read the longing
in Bertha's eyes, saw its reflection in Grace and Vera, and answered,
"I choose all of you. What are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"Draw lots, you dear little Christmas queen!" cried Bertha promptly.
"You are the most popular girl in school, Kitty Catt. Just see
how we fight over you! Here are some slips of paper from our guessing
game. Take your turn. The two longest, the two middle and the
two shortest are mates."</p>

<p>There on the stairs they drew their fate &mdash;Tabitha and Chrystobel,
Grace and Bertha, Carrie and Vera. Then with a merry laugh over
the result, they linked arms and marched up to bed, with one exception
a little disappointed, perhaps, but happy nevertheless.</p>

<p>The lights went out, five pair of sleepy eyes closed in slumber,
the great city grew still, but Tabitha lay awake in her narrow
bed looking up into the star-lit sky with bright, sparkling, happy
eyes which held no trace of sorrow or longing, as she whispered
reverently:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"O little town of Bethlehem,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How still we see thee lie!<br/>
&nbsp;Above thy deep and dreamless sleep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent hours go by."

</p>
</div>
<p>She thought of all the joys the day had brought her, such unexpected
pleasures that it seemed as if her heart would burst with gladness;
she thought of the girls who had done so much to give her this
beautiful holiday; she thought of the scene on the stairs, and
of Bertha's words, which, without a particle of conceit, she felt
were the truth; she thought of Tom away at college, and wondered
if his holiday had been as delightful as hers; she thought of
the friends at Silver Bow, of Aunt Maria in the East, of the stern
father keeping lonely vigil on the desert, and here her thoughts
lingered. Had he received the calendar she sent him, and was he
glad? What had prompted him to buy her the lovely gifts the express
box had contained? Was he, after all, growing to be like jolly
Mr. Carson? His remembrance had been the crowning touch of the
day. How could she ever thank him? An idea suddenly popped into
her mind as if in answer to her question, but she frowned at it,
shook her head, protested that she could never do such a thing,
and then&mdash;she did it.</p>

<p>Creeping carefully, noiselessly out of bed, she threw a kimono
over her nightgown, turned on the electric light, drew out writing
materials and began her first letter to the father whom she did
not know or understand.</p>

<p>"Dear Father," she wrote, "I take my pen in hand to try to express
in a feeble measure my deep and sincere gratitude for the many
beautiful gifts you have sent me&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, rats!" The pen stopped its deliberate movements, the paper
was roughly crumpled and flung into the waste basket. "That would
make him sick with disgust. What in the world shall I say?</p>

<p>"Dear Father, &mdash;The Christmas box arrived this morning and
its contents are greatly appreciated, I can assure you. How am
I ever to thank you enough!&mdash;</p>

<p>"Certainly not by such a stilted scribble as that. Sounds as
if I might be addressing the president of the Associated Charities.
Oh, dear, it is such a piece of work to write to one's father!
Carrie never has half the fuss; but then I don't suppose I would
either if Dad was like Mr. Carson&mdash;or Tom. That's it. I will just
pretend I am writing to Tom; I can say anything to him. Here goes!</p>

<p>"Dear Dad, &mdash;The things arrived this morning, and they are&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shall I say 'bully'? Tom would, but that is a boy's word, and
it is slang besides. Miss Pomeroy says a lady doesn't use slang.
I will use 'great'. No, that isn't much better. Well, 'splendid'
will do."</p>

<p>The busy pen went on scratching until the page was filled, then
a second, a third, and still she had not finished. The clock struck
midnight, then one; and with a flourish, Tabitha wrote at the
bottom of the tenth closely scribbled page, "With love, Tabitha,"
sighed with weary satisfaction, folded the sheets neatly, and
slipped them into an envelope just as Chrystobel's eyes opened
and the surprised girl inquired sleepily, "Whatever are you doing,
Kitty, up at this time of night?"</p>

<p>"Writing a letter."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you wait until morning?"</p>

<p>"No, dear, I have waited too long already," answered Tabitha,
turning out the light and scrambling back into bed. "I <em>had</em>
to tell him how good everyone is to me, and how good he is, too."</p>
