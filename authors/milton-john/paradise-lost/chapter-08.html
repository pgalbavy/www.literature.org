 <BR>
No more of talk where God or Angel Guest <BR>
With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us'd <BR>
To sit indulgent, and with him partake <BR>
Rural repast, permitting him the while <BR>
Venial discourse unblam'd: I now must change <BR>
Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach <BR>
Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt <BR>
And disobedience: On the part of Heav'n <BR>
Now alienated, distance and distaste, <BR>
Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv'n, <BR>
That brought into this World a world of woe, <BR>
Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie <BR>
Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument <BR>
Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth <BR>
Of stern ACHILLES on his Foe pursu'd <BR>
Thrice Fugitive about TROY Wall; or rage <BR>
Of TURNUS for LAVINIA disespous'd, <BR>
Or NEPTUN'S ire or JUNO'S, that so long <BR>
Perplex'd the GREEK and CYTHEREA'S Son; <BR>
If answerable style I can obtaine <BR>
Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes <BR>
Her nightly visitation unimplor'd, <BR>
And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires <BR>
Easie my unpremeditated Verse: <BR>
Since first this subject for Heroic Song <BR>
Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late; <BR>
Not sedulous by Nature to indite <BR>
Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument <BR>
Heroic deem'd, chief maistrie to dissect <BR>
With long and tedious havoc fabl'd Knights <BR>
In Battels feign'd; the better fortitude <BR>
Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom <BR>
Unsung; or to describe Races and Games, <BR>
Or tilting Furniture, emblazon'd Shields, <BR>
Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds; <BR>
Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights <BR>
At Joust and Torneament; then marshal'd Feast <BR>
Serv'd up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals; <BR>
The skill of Artifice or Office mean, <BR>
Not that which justly gives Heroic name <BR>
To Person or to Poem.  Mee of these <BR>
Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument <BR>
Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise <BR>
That name, unless an age too late, or cold <BR>
Climat, or Years damp my intended wing <BR>
Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine, <BR>
Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear. <BR>
<BR>
  The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr <BR>
Of HESPERUS, whose Office is to bring <BR>
Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter <BR>
Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end <BR>
Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round: <BR>
When SATAN who late fled before the threats <BR>
Of GABRIEL out of EDEN, now improv'd <BR>
In meditated fraud and malice, bent <BR>
On mans destruction, maugre what might hap <BR>
Of heavier on himself, fearless return'd. <BR>
By Night he fled, and at Midnight return'd <BR>
From compassing the Earth, cautious of day, <BR>
Since URIEL Regent of the Sun descri'd <BR>
His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim <BR>
That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv'n, <BR>
The space of seven continu'd Nights he rode <BR>
With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line <BR>
He circl'd, four times cross'd the Carr of Night <BR>
From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure; <BR>
On the eighth return'd, and on the Coast averse <BR>
From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth <BR>
Found unsuspected way.  There was a place, <BR>
Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change, <BR>
Where TIGRIS at the foot of Paradise <BR>
Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part <BR>
Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life; <BR>
In with the River sunk, and with it rose <BR>
Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought <BR>
Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land <BR>
From EDEN over PONTUS, and the Poole <BR>
MAEOTIS, up beyond the River OB; <BR>
Downward as farr Antartic; and in length <BR>
West from ORANTES to the Ocean barr'd <BR>
At DARIEN, thence to the Land where flowes <BR>
GANGES and INDUS: thus the Orb he roam'd <BR>
With narrow search; and with inspection deep <BR>
Consider'd every Creature, which of all <BR>
Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found <BR>
The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field. <BR>
Him after long debate, irresolute <BR>
Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose <BR>
Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom <BR>
To enter, and his dark suggestions hide <BR>
From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake, <BR>
Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark, <BR>
As from his wit and native suttletie <BR>
Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd <BR>
Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r <BR>
Active within beyond the sense of brute. <BR>
Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe <BR>
His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd: <BR>
<BR>
  O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferrd <BR>
More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built <BR>
With second thoughts, reforming what was old! <BR>
For what God after better worse would build? <BR>
Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns <BR>
That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps, <BR>
Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems, <BR>
In thee concentring all thir precious beams <BR>
Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n <BR>
Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou <BR>
Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee, <BR>
Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers <BR>
Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth <BR>
Of Creatures animate with gradual life <BR>
Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man. <BR>
With what delight could I have walkt thee round <BR>
If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange <BR>
Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines, <BR>
Now Land, now Sea, &amp; Shores with Forrest crownd, <BR>
Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these <BR>
Find place or refuge; and the more I see <BR>
Pleasures about me, so much more I feel <BR>
Torment within me, as from the hateful siege <BR>
Of contraries; all good to me becomes <BR>
Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state. <BR>
But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n <BR>
To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame; <BR>
Nor hope to be my self less miserable <BR>
By what I seek, but others to make such <BR>
As I though thereby worse to me redound: <BR>
For onely in destroying I finde ease <BR>
To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd, <BR>
Or won to what may work his utter loss, <BR>
For whom all this was made, all this will soon <BR>
Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe, <BR>
In wo then; that destruction wide may range: <BR>
To mee shall be the glorie sole among <BR>
The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd <BR>
What he ALMIGHTIE styl'd, six Nights and Days <BR>
Continu'd making, and who knows how long <BR>
Before had bin contriving, though perhaps <BR>
Not longer then since I in one Night freed <BR>
From servitude inglorious welnigh half <BR>
Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng <BR>
Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd, <BR>
And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd, <BR>
Whether such vertue spent of old now faild <BR>
More Angels to Create, if they at least <BR>
Are his Created or to spite us more, <BR>
Determin'd to advance into our room <BR>
A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow, <BR>
Exalted from so base original, <BR>
With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed <BR>
He effected; Man he made, and for him built <BR>
Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat, <BR>
Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie! <BR>
Subjected to his service Angel wings, <BR>
And flaming Ministers to watch and tend <BR>
Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance <BR>
I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist <BR>
Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie <BR>
In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde <BR>
The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds <BR>
To hide me, and the dark intent I bring. <BR>
O foul descent! that I who erst contended <BR>
With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind <BR>
Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime, <BR>
This essence to incarnate and imbrute, <BR>
That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd; <BR>
But what will not Ambition and Revenge <BR>
Descend to? who aspires must down as low <BR>
As high he soard, obnoxious first or last <BR>
To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet, <BR>
Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles; <BR>
Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd, <BR>
Since higher I fall short, on him who next <BR>
Provokes my envie, this new Favorite <BR>
Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite, <BR>
Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd <BR>
From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid. <BR>
<BR>
  So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie, <BR>
Like a black mist low creeping, he held on <BR>
His midnight search, where soonest he might finde <BR>
The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found <BR>
In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl'd, <BR>
His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles: <BR>
Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den, <BR>
Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe <BR>
Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth <BR>
The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense, <BR>
In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd <BR>
With act intelligential; but his sleep <BR>
Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn. <BR>
Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne <BR>
In EDEN on the humid Flours, that breathd <BR>
Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath, <BR>
From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise <BR>
To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill <BR>
With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair <BR>
And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire <BR>
Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake <BR>
The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires: <BR>
Then commune how that day they best may ply <BR>
Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew <BR>
The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide. <BR>
And EVE first to her Husband thus began. <BR>
<BR>
  ADAM, well may we labour still to dress <BR>
This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour. <BR>
Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands <BR>
Aid us, the work under our labour grows, <BR>
Luxurious by restraint; what we by day <BR>
Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, <BR>
One night or two with wanton growth derides <BR>
Tending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise <BR>
Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present, <BR>
Let us divide our labours, thou where choice <BR>
Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind <BR>
The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct <BR>
The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I <BR>
In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt <BR>
With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon: <BR>
For while so near each other thus all day <BR>
Our task we choose, what wonder if no near <BR>
Looks intervene and smiles, or object new <BR>
Casual discourse draw on, which intermits <BR>
Our dayes work brought to little, though begun <BR>
Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom mild answer ADAM thus return'd. <BR>
Sole EVE, Associate sole, to me beyond <BR>
Compare above all living Creatures deare, <BR>
Well hast thou motion'd, wel thy thoughts imployd <BR>
How we might best fulfill the work which here <BR>
God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass <BR>
Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found <BR>
In woman, then to studie houshold good, <BR>
And good workes in her Husband to promote. <BR>
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd <BR>
Labour, as to debarr us when we need <BR>
Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, <BR>
Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse <BR>
Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow, <BR>
To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food, <BR>
Love not the lowest end of human life. <BR>
For not to irksom toile, but to delight <BR>
He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd. <BR>
These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt <BR>
Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide <BR>
As we need walk, till younger hands ere long <BR>
Assist us: But if much converse perhaps <BR>
Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild. <BR>
For solitude somtimes is best societie, <BR>
And short retirement urges sweet returne. <BR>
But other doubt possesses me, least harm <BR>
Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst <BR>
What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe <BR>
Envying our happiness, and of his own <BR>
Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame <BR>
By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand <BR>
Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find <BR>
His wish and best advantage, us asunder, <BR>
Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each <BR>
To other speedie aide might lend at need; <BR>
Whether his first design be to withdraw <BR>
Our fealtie from God, or to disturb <BR>
Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss <BR>
Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more; <BR>
Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side <BR>
That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects. <BR>
The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, <BR>
Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, <BR>
Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Virgin Majestie of EVE, <BR>
As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, <BR>
With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, <BR>
That such an enemie we have, who seeks <BR>
Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, <BR>
And from the parting Angel over-heard <BR>
As in a shadie nook I stood behind, <BR>
Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. <BR>
But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt <BR>
To God or thee, because we have a foe <BR>
May tempt it, I expected not to hear. <BR>
His violence thou fearst not, being such, <BR>
As wee, not capable of death or paine, <BR>
Can either not receave, or can repell. <BR>
His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs <BR>
Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love <BR>
Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; <BR>
Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest, <BR>
ADAM, misthought of her to thee so dear? <BR>
<BR>
  To whom with healing words ADAM reply'd. <BR>
Daughter of God and Man, immortal EVE, <BR>
For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: <BR>
Not diffident of thee do I dissuade <BR>
Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid <BR>
Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe. <BR>
For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses <BR>
The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd <BR>
Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff <BR>
Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne <BR>
And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, <BR>
Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, <BR>
If such affront I labour to avert <BR>
From thee alone, which on us both at once <BR>
The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, <BR>
Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. <BR>
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; <BR>
Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce <BR>
Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. <BR>
I from the influence of thy looks receave <BR>
Access in every Vertue, in thy sight <BR>
More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were <BR>
Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, <BR>
Shame to be overcome or over-reacht <BR>
Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. <BR>
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel <BR>
When I am present, and thy trial choose <BR>
With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake domestick ADAM in his care <BR>
And Matrimonial Love, but EVE, who thought <BR>
Less attributed to her Faith sincere, <BR>
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. <BR>
<BR>
  If this be our condition, thus to dwell <BR>
In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe, <BR>
Suttle or violent, we not endu'd <BR>
Single with like defence, wherever met, <BR>
How are we happie, still in fear of harm? <BR>
But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe <BR>
Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem <BR>
Of our integritie: his foul esteeme <BR>
Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns <BR>
Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard <BR>
By us? who rather double honour gaine <BR>
From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within, <BR>
Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event. <BR>
And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid <BR>
Alone, without exterior help sustaind? <BR>
Let us not then suspect our happie State <BR>
Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, <BR>
As not secure to single or combin'd. <BR>
Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, <BR>
And EDEN were no EDEN thus expos'd. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus ADAM fervently repli'd. <BR>
O Woman, best are all things as the will <BR>
Of God ordaind them, his creating hand <BR>
Nothing imperfet or deficient left <BR>
Of all that he Created, much less Man, <BR>
Or ought that might his happie State secure, <BR>
Secure from outward force; within himself <BR>
The danger lies, yet lies within his power: <BR>
Against his will he can receave no harme. <BR>
But God left free the Will, for what obeyes <BR>
Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, <BR>
But bid her well beware, and still erect, <BR>
Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd <BR>
She dictate false, and missinforme the Will <BR>
To do what God expresly hath forbid. <BR>
Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, <BR>
That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. <BR>
Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, <BR>
Since Reason not impossibly may meet <BR>
Some specious object by the Foe subornd, <BR>
And fall into deception unaware, <BR>
Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. <BR>
Seek not temptation then, which to avoide <BR>
Were better, and most likelie if from mee <BR>
Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought. <BR>
Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve <BR>
First thy obedience; th' other who can know, <BR>
Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? <BR>
But if thou think, trial unsought may finde <BR>
Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, <BR>
Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; <BR>
Go in thy native innocence, relie <BR>
On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, <BR>
For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but EVE <BR>
Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. <BR>
<BR>
  With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd <BR>
Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words <BR>
Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, <BR>
May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, <BR>
The willinger I goe, nor much expect <BR>
A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; <BR>
So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. <BR>
Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand <BR>
Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light <BR>
OREAD or DRYAD, or of DELIA's Traine, <BR>
Betook her to the Groves, but DELIA's self <BR>
In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport, <BR>
Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, <BR>
But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude, <BR>
Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought, <BR>
To PALES, or POMONA, thus adornd, <BR>
Likest she seemd, POMONA when she fled <BR>
VERTUMNUS, or to CERES in her Prime, <BR>
Yet Virgin of PROSERPINA from JOVE. <BR>
Her long with ardent look his EYE pursu'd <BR>
Delighted, but desiring more her stay. <BR>
Oft he to her his charge of quick returne, <BR>
Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd <BR>
To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, <BR>
And all things in best order to invite <BR>
Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. <BR>
O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless EVE, <BR>
Of thy presum'd return! event perverse! <BR>
Thou never from that houre in Paradise <BR>
Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; <BR>
Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades <BR>
Waited with hellish rancor imminent <BR>
To intercept thy way, or send thee back <BR>
Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. <BR>
For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, <BR>
Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, <BR>
And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde <BR>
The onely two of Mankinde, but in them <BR>
The whole included Race, his purposd prey. <BR>
In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft <BR>
Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, <BR>
Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, <BR>
By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet <BR>
He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find <BR>
EVE separate, he wish'd, but not with hope <BR>
Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, <BR>
Beyond his hope, EVE separate he spies, <BR>
Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, <BR>
Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round <BR>
About her glowd, oft stooping to support <BR>
Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay <BR>
Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, <BR>
Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies <BR>
Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, <BR>
Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, <BR>
From her best prop so farr, and storn so nigh. <BR>
Neererhe drew, and many a walk travers'd <BR>
Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, <BR>
Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen <BR>
Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours <BR>
Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of EVE: <BR>
Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd <BR>
Or of reviv'd ADONIS, or renownd <BR>
ALCINOUS, host of old LAERTES Son, <BR>
Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King <BR>
Held dalliance with his faire EGYPTIAN Spouse. <BR>
Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more. <BR>
As one who long in populous City pent, <BR>
Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, <BR>
Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe <BR>
Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes <BR>
Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, <BR>
The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, <BR>
Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; <BR>
If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, <BR>
What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, <BR>
She most, and in her look summs all Delight. <BR>
Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold <BR>
This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of EVE <BR>
Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme <BR>
Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, <BR>
Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire <BR>
Of gesture or lest action overawd <BR>
His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd <BR>
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: <BR>
That space the Evil one abstracted stood <BR>
From his own evil, and for the time remaind <BR>
Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, <BR>
Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; <BR>
But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, <BR>
Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight, <BR>
And tortures him now more, the more he sees <BR>
Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon <BR>
Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts <BR>
Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. <BR>
<BR>
  Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet <BR>
Compulsion thus transported to forget <BR>
What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope <BR>
Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste <BR>
Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, <BR>
Save what is in destroying, other joy <BR>
To me is lost.  Then let me not let pass <BR>
Occasion which now smiles, behold alone <BR>
The Woman, opportune to all attempts, <BR>
Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, <BR>
Whose higher intellectual more I shun, <BR>
And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb <BR>
Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, <BR>
Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, <BR>
I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine <BR>
Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n. <BR>
Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, <BR>
Not terrible, though terrour be in Love <BR>
And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, <BR>
Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd, <BR>
The way which to her ruin now I tend. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd <BR>
In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward EVE <BR>
Address'd his way, not with indented wave, <BR>
Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, <BR>
Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd <BR>
Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head <BR>
Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; <BR>
With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect <BR>
Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass <BR>
Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, <BR>
And lovely, never since of Serpent kind <BR>
Lovelier, not those that in ILLYRIA chang'd <BR>
HERMIONE and CADMUS, or the God <BR>
In EPIDAURUS; nor to which transformd <BR>
AMMONIAN JOVE, or CAPITOLINE was seen, <BR>
Hee with OLYMPIAS, this with her who bore <BR>
SCIPIO the highth of ROME.  With tract oblique <BR>
At first, as one who sought access, but feard <BR>
To interrupt, side-long he works his way. <BR>
As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought <BR>
Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind <BR>
Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; <BR>
So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine <BR>
Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of EVE, <BR>
To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound <BR>
Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd <BR>
To such disport before her through the Field, <BR>
From every Beast, more duteous at her call, <BR>
Then at CIRCEAN call the Herd disguis'd. <BR>
Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; <BR>
But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd <BR>
His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck, <BR>
Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. <BR>
His gentle dumb expression turnd at length <BR>
The Eye of EVE to mark his play; he glad <BR>
Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue <BR>
Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, <BR>
His fraudulent temptation thus began. <BR>
<BR>
  Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps <BR>
Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm <BR>
Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain, <BR>
Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze <BR>
Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard <BR>
Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. <BR>
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, <BR>
Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine <BR>
By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore <BR>
With ravishment beheld, there best beheld <BR>
Where universally admir'd; but here <BR>
In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, <BR>
Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne <BR>
Half what in thee is fair, one man except, <BR>
Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen <BR>
A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd <BR>
By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. <BR>
<BR>
  So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd; <BR>
Into the Heart of EVE his words made way, <BR>
Though at the voice much marveling; at length <BR>
Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. <BR>
What may this mean?  Language of Man pronounc't <BR>
By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? <BR>
The first at lest of these I thought deni'd <BR>
To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day <BR>
Created mute to all articulat sound; <BR>
The latter I demurre, for in thir looks <BR>
Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. <BR>
Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field <BR>
I knew, but not with human voice endu'd; <BR>
Redouble then this miracle, and say, <BR>
How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how <BR>
To me so friendly grown above the rest <BR>
Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? <BR>
Say, for such wonder claims attention due. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd. <BR>
Empress of this fair World, resplendent EVE, <BR>
Easie to mee it is to tell thee all <BR>
What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: <BR>
I was at first as other Beasts that graze <BR>
The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, <BR>
As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd <BR>
Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: <BR>
Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd <BR>
A goodly Tree farr distant to behold <BR>
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, <BR>
Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; <BR>
When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, <BR>
Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense <BR>
Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats <BR>
Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, <BR>
Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. <BR>
To satisfie the sharp desire I had <BR>
Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd <BR>
Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, <BR>
Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent <BR>
Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. <BR>
About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon, <BR>
For high from ground the branches would require <BR>
Thy utmost reach or ADAMS: Round the Tree <BR>
All other Beasts that saw, with like desire <BR>
Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. <BR>
Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung <BR>
Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill <BR>
I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour <BR>
At Feed or Fountain never had I found. <BR>
Sated at length, ere long I might perceave <BR>
Strange alteration in me, to degree <BR>
Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech <BR>
Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind. <BR>
Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep <BR>
I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind <BR>
Considerd all things visible in Heav'n, <BR>
Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; <BR>
But all that fair and good in thy Divine <BR>
Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray <BR>
United I beheld; no Fair to thine <BR>
Equivalent or second, which compel'd <BR>
Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come <BR>
And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd <BR>
Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. <BR>
<BR>
  So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and EVE <BR>
Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt <BR>
The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd: <BR>
But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? <BR>
For many are the Trees of God that grow <BR>
In Paradise, and various, yet unknown <BR>
To us, in such abundance lies our choice, <BR>
As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, <BR>
Still hanging incorruptible, till men <BR>
Grow up to thir provision, and more hands <BR>
Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad. <BR>
Empress, the way is readie, and not long, <BR>
Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, <BR>
Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past <BR>
Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept <BR>
My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. <BR>
<BR>
  Lead then, said EVE.  Hee leading swiftly rowld <BR>
In tangles, and make intricate seem strait, <BR>
To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy <BR>
Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire <BR>
Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night <BR>
Condenses, and the cold invirons round, <BR>
Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame, <BR>
Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, <BR>
Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, <BR>
Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way <BR>
To Boggs and Mires, &amp; oft through Pond or Poole, <BR>
There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr. <BR>
So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud <BR>
Led EVE our credulous Mother, to the Tree <BR>
Of prohibition, root of all our woe; <BR>
Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. <BR>
<BR>
  Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, <BR>
Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess, <BR>
The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, <BR>
Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. <BR>
But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; <BR>
God so commanded, and left that Command <BR>
Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live <BR>
Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd. <BR>
Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit <BR>
Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, <BR>
Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus EVE yet sinless.  Of the Fruit <BR>
Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, <BR>
But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst <BR>
The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate <BR>
Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. <BR>
<BR>
  She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold <BR>
The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love <BR>
To Man, and indignation at his wrong, <BR>
New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd, <BR>
Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act <BR>
Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin. <BR>
As when of old som Orator renound <BR>
In ATHENS or free ROME, where Eloquence <BR>
Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, <BR>
Stood in himself collected, while each part, <BR>
Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, <BR>
Somtimes in highth began, as no delay <BR>
Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. <BR>
So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown <BR>
The Tempter all impassiond thus began. <BR>
<BR>
  O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, <BR>
Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power <BR>
Within me cleere, not onely to discerne <BR>
Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes <BR>
Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. <BR>
Queen of this Universe, doe not believe <BR>
Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: <BR>
How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life <BR>
To Knowledge?  By the Threatner, look on mee, <BR>
Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, <BR>
And life more perfet have attaind then Fate <BR>
Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. <BR>
Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast <BR>
Is open? or will God incense his ire <BR>
For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise <BR>
Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain <BR>
Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be, <BR>
Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade <BR>
To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; <BR>
Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil <BR>
Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? <BR>
God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; <BR>
Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid: <BR>
Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. <BR>
Why then was this forbid?  Why but to awe, <BR>
Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, <BR>
His worshippers; he knows that in the day <BR>
Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, <BR>
Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then <BR>
Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, <BR>
Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. <BR>
That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, <BR>
Internal Man, is but proportion meet, <BR>
I of brute human, yee of human Gods. <BR>
So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off <BR>
Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, <BR>
Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring <BR>
And what are Gods that Man may not become <BR>
As they, participating God-like food? <BR>
The Gods are first, and that advantage use <BR>
On our belief, that all from them proceeds, <BR>
I question it, for this fair Earth I see, <BR>
Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind, <BR>
Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd <BR>
Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, <BR>
That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains <BR>
Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies <BR>
Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know? <BR>
What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree <BR>
Impart against his will if all be his? <BR>
Or is it envie, and can envie dwell <BR>
In heav'nly brests? these, these and many more <BR>
Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. <BR>
Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. <BR>
<BR>
  He ended, and his words replete with guile <BR>
Into her heart too easie entrance won: <BR>
Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold <BR>
Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound <BR>
Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd <BR>
With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; <BR>
Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd <BR>
An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell <BR>
So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, <BR>
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, <BR>
Sollicited her longing eye; yet first <BR>
Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, <BR>
Though kept from Man, &amp; worthy to be admir'd, <BR>
Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay <BR>
Gave elocution to the mute, and taught <BR>
The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: <BR>
Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, <BR>
Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree <BR>
Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; <BR>
Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding <BR>
Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good <BR>
By thee communicated, and our want: <BR>
For good unknown, sure is not had, or had <BR>
And yet unknown, is as not had at all. <BR>
In plain then, what forbids he but to know, <BR>
Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? <BR>
Such prohibitions binde not.  But if Death <BR>
Bind us with after-bands, what profits then <BR>
Our inward freedom?  In the day we eate <BR>
Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. <BR>
How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives, <BR>
And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes, <BR>
Irrational till then.  For us alone <BR>
Was death invented? or to us deni'd <BR>
This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd? <BR>
For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first <BR>
Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy <BR>
The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect, <BR>
Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. <BR>
What fear I then, rather what know to feare <BR>
Under this ignorance of Good and Evil, <BR>
Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? <BR>
Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, <BR>
Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, <BR>
Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then <BR>
To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? <BR>
<BR>
  So saying, her rash hand in evil hour <BR>
Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: <BR>
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat <BR>
Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, <BR>
That all was lost.  Back to the Thicket slunk <BR>
The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for EVE <BR>
Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else <BR>
Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, <BR>
In Fruit she never tasted, whether true <BR>
Or fansied so, through expectation high <BR>
Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. <BR>
Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint, <BR>
And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, <BR>
And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, <BR>
Thus to her self she pleasingly began. <BR>
<BR>
  O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees <BR>
In Paradise, of operation blest <BR>
To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, <BR>
And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end <BR>
Created; but henceforth my early care, <BR>
Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise <BR>
Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease <BR>
Of thy full branches offer'd free to all; <BR>
Till dieted by thee I grow mature <BR>
In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; <BR>
Though others envie what they cannot give; <BR>
For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here <BR>
Thus grown.  Experience, next to thee I owe, <BR>
Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind <BR>
In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way, <BR>
And giv'st access, though secret she retire. <BR>
And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high, <BR>
High and remote to see from thence distinct <BR>
Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps <BR>
May have diverted from continual watch <BR>
Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies <BR>
About him.  But to ADAM in what sort <BR>
Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known <BR>
As yet my change, and give him to partake <BR>
Full happiness with mee, or rather not, <BR>
But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power <BR>
Without Copartner? so to add what wants <BR>
In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, <BR>
And render me more equal, and perhaps <BR>
A thing not undesireable, somtime <BR>
Superior; for inferior who is free? <BR>
This may be well: but what if God have seen, <BR>
And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, <BR>
And ADAM wedded to another EVE, <BR>
Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; <BR>
A death to think.  Confirm'd then I resolve, <BR>
ADAM shall share with me in bliss or woe: <BR>
So dear I love him, that with him all deaths <BR>
I could endure; without him live no life. <BR>
<BR>
  So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, <BR>
But first low Reverence don, as to the power <BR>
That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd <BR>
Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd <BR>
From Nectar, drink of Gods.  ADAM the while <BR>
Waiting desirous her return, had wove <BR>
Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne <BR>
Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown <BR>
As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. <BR>
Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new <BR>
Solace in her return, so long delay'd; <BR>
Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, <BR>
Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; <BR>
And forth to meet her went, the way she took <BR>
That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree <BR>
Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, <BR>
Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand <BR>
A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd, <BR>
New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd. <BR>
To him she hasted, in her face excuse <BR>
Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, <BR>
Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. <BR>
<BR>
  Hast thou not wonderd, ADAM, at my stay? <BR>
Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd <BR>
Thy presence, agonie of love till now <BR>
Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more <BR>
Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought, <BR>
The paine of absence from thy sight.  But strange <BR>
Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: <BR>
This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree <BR>
Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown <BR>
Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect <BR>
To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; <BR>
And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise, <BR>
Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, <BR>
Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, <BR>
Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth <BR>
Endu'd with human voice and human sense, <BR>
Reasoning to admiration, and with mee <BR>
Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I <BR>
Have also tasted, and have also found <BR>
Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, <BR>
Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, <BR>
And growing up to Godhead; which for thee <BR>
Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. <BR>
For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, <BR>
Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. <BR>
Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot <BR>
May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love; <BR>
Least thou not tasting, different degree <BR>
Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce <BR>
Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus EVE with Countnance blithe her storie told; <BR>
But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. <BR>
On th' other side, ADAM, soon as he heard <BR>
The fatal Trespass don by EVE, amaz'd, <BR>
Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill <BR>
Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; <BR>
From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for EVE <BR>
Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed: <BR>
Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length <BR>
First to himself he inward silence broke. <BR>
<BR>
  O fairest of Creation, last and best <BR>
Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd <BR>
Whatever can to fight or thought be found, <BR>
Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! <BR>
How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, <BR>
Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote? <BR>
Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress <BR>
The strict forbiddance, how to violate <BR>
The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud <BR>
Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, <BR>
And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee <BR>
Certain my resolution is to Die; <BR>
How can I live without thee, how forgoe <BR>
Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd, <BR>
To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? <BR>
Should God create another EVE, and I <BR>
Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee <BR>
Would never from my heart; no no, I feel <BR>
The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, <BR>
Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State <BR>
Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. <BR>
<BR>
  So having said, as one from sad dismay <BR>
Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd <BR>
Submitting to what seemd remediless, <BR>
Thus in calme mood his Words to EVE he turnd. <BR>
<BR>
  Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous EVE, <BR>
And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd <BR>
Had it bin onely coveting to Eye <BR>
That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, <BR>
Much more to taste it under banne to touch. <BR>
But past who can recall, or don undoe? <BR>
Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so <BR>
Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact <BR>
Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, <BR>
Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first <BR>
Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes; <BR>
Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives, <BR>
Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man <BR>
Higher degree of Life, inducement strong <BR>
To us, as likely tasting to attaine <BR>
Proportional ascent, which cannot be <BR>
But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. <BR>
Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, <BR>
Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy <BR>
Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high, <BR>
Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, <BR>
For us created, needs with us must faile, <BR>
Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, <BR>
Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, <BR>
Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power <BR>
Creation could repeate, yet would be loath <BR>
Us to abolish, least the Adversary <BR>
Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God <BR>
Most Favors, who can please him long?  Mee first <BR>
He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? <BR>
Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe. <BR>
However I with thee have fixt my Lot, <BR>
Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death <BR>
Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; <BR>
So forcible within my heart I feel <BR>
The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, <BR>
My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; <BR>
Our State cannot be severd, we are one, <BR>
One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. <BR>
<BR>
  So ADAM, and thus EVE to him repli'd. <BR>
O glorious trial of exceeding Love, <BR>
Illustrious evidence, example high! <BR>
Ingaging me to emulate, but short <BR>
Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, <BR>
ADAM, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, <BR>
And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, <BR>
One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff <BR>
This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, <BR>
Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread <BR>
Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, <BR>
To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, <BR>
If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, <BR>
Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, <BR>
Direct, or by occasion hath presented <BR>
This happie trial of thy Love, which else <BR>
So eminently never had bin known. <BR>
Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue <BR>
This my attempt, I would sustain alone <BR>
The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die <BR>
Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact <BR>
Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd <BR>
Remarkably so late of thy so true, <BR>
So faithful Love unequald; but I feel <BR>
Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life <BR>
Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, <BR>
Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before <BR>
Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. <BR>
On my experience, ADAM, freely taste, <BR>
And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. <BR>
<BR>
  So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy <BR>
Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love <BR>
Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr <BR>
Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. <BR>
In recompence (for such compliance bad <BR>
Such recompence best merits) from the bough <BR>
She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit <BR>
With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat <BR>
Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, <BR>
But fondly overcome with Femal charm. <BR>
Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again <BR>
In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, <BR>
Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops <BR>
Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin <BR>
Original; while ADAM took no thought, <BR>
Eating his fill, nor EVE to iterate <BR>
Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe <BR>
Him with her lov'd societie, that now <BR>
As with new Wine intoxicated both <BR>
They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel <BR>
Divinitie within them breeding wings <BR>
Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit <BR>
Farr other operation first displaid, <BR>
Carnal desire enflaming, hee on EVE <BR>
Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him <BR>
As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: <BR>
Till ADAM thus 'gan EVE to dalliance move. <BR>
<BR>
  EVE, now I see thou art exact of taste, <BR>
And elegant, of Sapience no small part, <BR>
Since to each meaning savour we apply, <BR>
And Palate call judicious; I the praise <BR>
Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. <BR>
Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd <BR>
From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now <BR>
True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be <BR>
In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd, <BR>
For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. <BR>
But come, so well refresh't, now let us play, <BR>
As meet is, after such delicious Fare; <BR>
For never did thy Beautie since the day <BR>
I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd <BR>
With all perfections, so enflame my sense <BR>
With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now <BR>
Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. <BR>
<BR>
  So said he, and forbore not glance or toy <BR>
Of amorous intent, well understood <BR>
Of EVE, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. <BR>
Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank, <BR>
Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd <BR>
He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, <BR>
Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, <BR>
And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. <BR>
There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport <BR>
Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, <BR>
The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep <BR>
Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play. <BR>
Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, <BR>
That with exhilerating vapour bland <BR>
About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers <BR>
Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep <BR>
Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams <BR>
Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose <BR>
As from unrest, and each the other viewing, <BR>
Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds <BR>
How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile <BR>
Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon, <BR>
Just confidence, and native righteousness, <BR>
And honour from about them, naked left <BR>
To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe <BR>
Uncover'd more.  So rose the DANITE strong <BR>
HERCULEAN SAMSON from the Harlot-lap <BR>
Of PHILISTEAN DALILAH, and wak'd <BR>
Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare <BR>
Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face <BR>
Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute, <BR>
Till ADAM, though not less then EVE abasht, <BR>
At length gave utterance to these words constraind. <BR>
<BR>
  O EVE, in evil hour thou didst give care <BR>
To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught <BR>
To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, <BR>
False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes <BR>
Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know <BR>
Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got, <BR>
Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, <BR>
Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, <BR>
Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie, <BR>
Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, <BR>
And in our Faces evident the signes <BR>
Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; <BR>
Even shame, the last of evils; of the first <BR>
Be sure then.  How shall I behold the face <BR>
Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy <BR>
And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes <BR>
Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze <BR>
Insufferably bright.  O might I here <BR>
In solitude live savage, in some glad <BR>
Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable <BR>
To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad, <BR>
And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, <BR>
Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs <BR>
Hide me, where I may never see them more. <BR>
But let us now, as in bad plight, devise <BR>
What best may for the present serve to hide <BR>
The Parts of each from other, that seem most <BR>
To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, <BR>
Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, <BR>
And girded on our loyns, may cover round <BR>
Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, <BR>
There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. <BR>
<BR>
  So counsel'd hee, and both together went <BR>
Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose <BR>
The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd, <BR>
But such as at this day to INDIANS known <BR>
In MALABAR or DECAN spreds her Armes <BR>
Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground <BR>
The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow <BR>
About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade <BR>
High overarch't, and echoing Walks between; <BR>
There oft the INDIAN Herdsman shunning heate <BR>
Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds <BR>
At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves <BR>
They gatherd, broad as AMAZONIAN Targe, <BR>
And with what skill they had, together sowd, <BR>
To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide <BR>
Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike <BR>
To that first naked Glorie.  Such of late <BR>
COLUMBUS found th' AMERICAN to girt <BR>
With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde <BR>
Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. <BR>
Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part <BR>
Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, <BR>
They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares <BR>
Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within <BR>
Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, <BR>
Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore <BR>
Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once <BR>
And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent: <BR>
For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will <BR>
Heard not her lore, both in subjection now <BR>
To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe <BR>
Usurping over sovran Reason claimd <BR>
Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest, <BR>
ADAM, estrang'd in look and alterd stile, <BR>
Speech intermitted thus to EVE renewd. <BR>
<BR>
  Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, &amp; stai'd <BR>
With me, as I besought thee, when that strange <BR>
Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn, <BR>
I know not whence possessd thee; we had then <BR>
Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild <BR>
Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable. <BR>
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve <BR>
The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek <BR>
Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus EVE. <BR>
What words have past thy Lips, ADAM severe, <BR>
Imput'st thou that to my default, or will <BR>
Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows <BR>
But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by, <BR>
Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there, <BR>
Or bere th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd <BR>
Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; <BR>
No ground of enmitie between us known, <BR>
Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme. <BR>
Was I to have never parted from thy side? <BR>
As good have grown there still a liveless Rib. <BR>
Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head <BR>
Command me absolutely not to go, <BR>
Going into such danger as thou saidst? <BR>
Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, <BR>
Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. <BR>
Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, <BR>
Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom then first incenst ADAM repli'd. <BR>
Is this the Love, is the recompence <BR>
Of mine to thee, ingrateful EVE, exprest <BR>
Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, <BR>
Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss, <BR>
Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: <BR>
And am I now upbraided, as the cause <BR>
Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, <BR>
It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? <BR>
I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold <BR>
The danger, and the lurking Enemie <BR>
That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, <BR>
And force upon free Will hath here no place. <BR>
But confidence then bore thee on, secure <BR>
Either to meet no danger, or to finde <BR>
Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps <BR>
I also err'd in overmuch admiring <BR>
What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought <BR>
No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue <BR>
That errour now, which is become my crime, <BR>
And thou th' accuser.  Thus it shall befall <BR>
Him who to worth in Women overtrusting <BR>
Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook, <BR>
And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, <BR>
Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus they in mutual accusation spent <BR>
The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning <BR>
And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end. <BR>
<BR>
     THE END OF THE EIGHTH BOOK. <BR>
