But behold! As soon as I went out on the adventure-path I met John
Barleycorn again.  I moved through a world of strangers, and the
act of drinking together made one acquainted with men and opened
the way to adventures.  It might be in a saloon with jingled
townsmen, or with a genial railroad man well lighted up and armed
with pocket flasks, or with a bunch of alki stiffs in a hang-out. 
Yes; and it might be in a prohibition state, such as Iowa was in
1894, when I wandered up the main street of Des Moines and was
variously invited by strangers into various blind pigs--I remember
drinking in barber-shops, plumbing establishments, and furniture
stores.
<P>
Always it was John Barleycorn.  Even a tramp, in those halcyon
days, could get most frequently drunk.  I remember, inside the
prison at Buffalo, how some of us got magnificently jingled, and
how, on the streets of Buffalo after our release, another jingle
was financed with pennies begged on the main-drag.
<P>
I had no call for alcohol, but when I was with those who drank, I
drank with them.  I insisted on travelling or loafing with the
livest, keenest men, and it was just these live, keen ones that
did most of the drinking.  They were the more comradely men, the
more venturous, the more individual.  Perhaps it was too much
temperament that made them turn from the commonplace and humdrum
to find relief in the lying and fantastic sureties of John
Barleycorn.  Be that as it may, the men I liked best, desired most
to be with, were invariably to be found in John Barleycorn's
company.
<P>
In the course of my tramping over the United States I achieved a
new concept.  As a tramp, I was behind the scenes of society--aye,
and down in the cellar.  I could watch the machinery work.  I saw
the wheels of the social machine go around, and I learned that the
dignity of manual labour wasn't what I had been told it was by the
teachers, preachers, and politicians.  The men without trades were
helpless cattle.  If one learned a trade, he was compelled to
belong to a union in order to work at his trade.  And his union
was compelled to bully and slug the employers' unions in order to
hold up wages or hold down hours.  The employers' unions like-wise
bullied and slugged.  I couldn't see any dignity at all.  And when
a workman got old, or had an accident, he was thrown into the
scrap-heap like any worn-out machine.  I saw too many of this sort
who were making anything but dignified ends of life.
<P>
So my new concept was that manual labour was undignified, and that
it didn't pay.  No trade for me, was my decision, and no
superintendent's daughters.  And no criminality, I also decided. 
That would be almost as disastrous as to be a labourer.  Brains
paid, not brawn, and I resolved never again to offer my muscles
for sale in the brawn market.  Brain, and brain only, would I
sell.
<P>
I returned to California with the firm intention of developing my
brain.  This meant school education.  I had gone through the
grammar school long ago, so I entered the Oakland High School.  To
pay my way I worked as a janitor.  My sister helped me, too; and I
was not above mowing anybody's lawn or taking up and beating
carpets when I had half a day to spare.  I was working to get away
from work, and I buckled down to it with a grim realisation of the
paradox.
<P>
Boy and girl love was left behind, and, along with it, Haydee and
Louis Shattuck, and the early evening strolls.  I hadn't the time. 
I joined the Henry Clay Debating Society.  I was received into the
homes of some of the members, where I met nice girls whose skirts
reached the ground.  I dallied with little home clubs wherein we
discussed poetry and art and the nuances of grammar.  I joined the
socialist local where we studied and orated political economy,
philosophy, and politics.  I kept half a dozen membership cards
working in the free library and did an immense amount of
collateral reading.
<P>
And for a year and a half on end I never took a drink, nor thought
of taking a drink.  I hadn't the time, and I certainly did not
have the inclination.  Between my janitor-work, my studies, and
innocent amusements such as chess, I hadn't a moment to spare.  I
was discovering a new world, and such was the passion of my
exploration that the old world of John Barleycorn held no
inducements for me.
<P>
Come to think of it, I did enter a saloon.  I went to see Johnny
Heinhold in the Last Chance, and I went to borrow money.  And
right here is another phase of John Barleycorn.  Saloon-keepers
are notoriously good fellows.  On an average they perform vastly
greater generosities than do business men.  When I simply had to
have ten dollars, desperate, with no place to turn, I went to
Johnny Heinhold.  Several years had passed since I had been in his
place or spent a cent across his bar.  And when I went to borrow
the ten dollars I didn't buy a drink, either.  And Johnny Heinhold
let me have the ten dollars without security or interest.
<P>
More than once, in the brief days of my struggle for an education,
I went to Johnny Heinhold to borrow money.  When I entered the
university, I borrowed forty dollars from him, without interest,
without security, without buying a drink.  And yet--and here is
the point, the custom, and the code--in the days of my prosperity,
after the lapse of years, I have gone out of my way by many a long
block to spend across Johnny Heinhold's bar deferred interest on
the various loans.  Not that Johnny Heinhold asked me to do it, or
expected me to do it.  I did it, as I have said, in obedience to
the code I had learned along with all the other things connected
with John Barleycorn.  In distress, when a man has no other place
to turn, when he hasn't the slightest bit of security which a
savage-hearted pawn-broker would consider, he can go to some
saloon-keeper he knows.  Gratitude is inherently human.  When the
man so helped has money again, depend upon it that a portion will
be spent across the bar of the saloon-keeper who befriended him.
<P>
Why, I recollect the early days of my writing career, when the
small sums of money I earned from the magazines came with tragic
irregularity, while at the same time I was staggering along with a
growing family--a wife, children, a mother, a nephew, and my Mammy
Jennie and her old husband fallen on evil days.  There were two
places at which I could borrow money; a barber shop and a saloon. 
The barber charged me five per cent. per month in advance.  That
is to say, when I borrowed one hundred dollars, he handed me
ninety-five.  The other five dollars he retained as advance
interest for the first month.  And on the second month I paid him
five dollars more, and continued so to do each month until I made
a ten strike with the editors and lifted the loan.
<P>
The other place to which I came in trouble was the saloon.  This
saloon-keeper I had known by sight for a couple of years.  I had
never spent my money in his saloon, and even when I borrowed from
him I didn't spend any money.  Yet never did he refuse me any sum
I asked of him.  Unfortunately, before I became prosperous, he
moved away to another city.  And to this day I regret that he is
gone.  It is the code I have learned.  The right thing to do, and
the thing I'd do right now did I know where he is, would be to
drop in on occasion and spend a few dollars across his bar for old
sake's sake and gratitude.
<P>
This is not to exalt saloon-keepers.  I have written it to exalt
the power of John Barleycorn and to illustrate one more of the
myriad ways by which a man is brought in contact with John
Barleycorn until in the end he finds he cannot get along without
him.
<P>
But to return to the run of my narrative.  Away from the
adventure-path, up to my ears in study, every moment occupied, I
lived oblivious to John Barleycorn's existence.  Nobody about me
drank.  If any had drunk, and had they offered it to me, I surely
would have drunk.  As it was, when I had spare moments I spent
them playing chess, or going with nice girls who were themselves
students, or in riding a bicycle whenever I was fortunate enough
to have it out of the pawnbroker's possession.
<P>
What I am insisting upon all the time is this: in me was not the
slightest trace of alcoholic desire, and this despite the long and
severe apprenticeship I had served under John Barleycorn.  I had
come back from the other side of life to be delighted with this
Arcadian simplicity of student youths and student maidens.  Also,
I had found my way into the realm of the mind, and I was
intellectually intoxicated.  (Alas! as I was to learn at a later
period, intellectual intoxication too.  has its katzenjammer.)
