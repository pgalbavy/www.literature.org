<p>Herbert Watrous, when he separated from his companions on that
balmy afternoon in Indian summer, assumed a loftiness of bearing
which was far from genuine.</p>

<p>The fact was, he felt dissatisfied with himself, or rather with
the rifle which his indulgent father had presented to him only
a few weeks before.</p>

<p>"I don't like the way the thing behaves," he said, as he stopped
to examine it; "father paid one hundred and twenty-five dollars
for it, and it was warranted the best. It's pretty hard to hit
a deer a quarter of a mile off, but I ought to have brought down
that squirrel which was only a hundred feet distant."</p>

<p>He turned the weapon over and over in his hand, looked down the
barrel, tried the hammer and trigger, carefully examined the wind-gauge
and vernier rear-sights, but could not see that anything was out
of order.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it was my fault," he said, with a sigh, "but it will
never do to let the boys know it. I'll insist that I struck the
buck, though I'm afraid I didn't."</p>

<p>After going a little ways he noticed he was walking over a path
which was not marked very distinctly; it was, in fact, the route
which Mr. Fred Fowler, the industrious dweller in the log cabin,
had worn for himself in going to and from his work.</p>

<p>"That's lucky," said the lad, "for it's much easier traveling
over a path like that than tramping among the trees, where you
have to walk twice as far as there is any need of&mdash;confound it!"</p>

<p>This impatient remark was caused by a protruding branch, which
just then caught Herbert under the chin and almost lifted him
off his feet.</p>

<p>The boy was sensible enough to understand that his failure to
display any good marksmanship was due to his own want of practice
rather than to any fault of his piece.</p>

<p>"That Nick Ribsam can beat me out of my boots; I never heard
of such a thing as 'barking' a squirrel till he showed me how
it is done, and he used a gun that is older than himself. Well,
Nick was always smarter than other boys; he is younger than I,
and I have taken sparring lessons of the best teachers in the
country, while he never heard of such a thing as science in using
his fists; but he just sailed into me that day, and the first
thing I knew he had me down, and was banging himself on me so
hard that I have never got over the flattening out&mdash;hallo!"</p>

<p>A gray squirrel, flirting its bushy tail, whisked across the
path in front of him that moment, scampered up a hickory and perched
itself near the top, where it offered the best chance for a shot
that one could wish.</p>

<p>"Now I'll see what I can do," muttered Herbert, sighting at the
saucy little fellow, who seemed to be ridiculing his purpose of
reaching it with a bullet at such a height.</p>

<p>The young hunter aimed with great care, pressed the trigger,
and, as the sharp report rang through the woods, the squirrel
came tumbling to the ground, with its skull shattered.</p>

<p>Herbert Watrous was surprised and delighted, scarcely believing
in his own success. He picked up the slain rodent and saw that
its destruction had been caused by the bullet he fired.</p>

<p>"That's business," he exclaimed, with a thrill of pride; "but
why couldn't I shoot that way when Nick and Sam were looking at
me? I know how the thing is done now, and when we get together
I'll give them some lessons in marksmanship."</p>

<p>He left the squirrel on the ground, but had not gone far when
a new idea struck him and he came back, picked it up, and put
it in his game-bag.</p>

<p>"If I show them a squirrel, they can't help believing that I
shot him."</p>

<p>The serious question which Herbert had been discussing with himself,
ever since being alone, was what he would do if he should happen
to come upon the bear. He had not quite so much confidence in
his gun as he had when he started out, though the shooting of
the squirrel brought back considerable of his natural assurance.</p>

<p>The conclusion he reached was that it would be just as well if
he and bruin did not meet. Excellent as was his Remington, it
was not a repeating rifle, and he was afraid that one shot, even
if well aimed, would not be enough.</p>

<p>"If I had a Henry, which shoots sixteen shots in sixteen seconds,
I could fill him so full of lead that he couldn't run fast enough
to overtake me if I didn't happen to kill him."</p>

<p>But the Henry, which he desired so much, was beyond his reach,
and it was idle to wish for it.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he slung his gun over his shoulder in true sportsman
style, and strode along the path until the greater part of the
distance was passed, when, like his friends, he found a fallen
tree at a convenient spot and sat down for a rest.</p>

<p>Herbert, in his luxurious home in the city, had become accustomed
to irregular hours, so that it was now the most natural thing
in the world for him to fall asleep and not open his eyes until
he shivered with cold and it was growing dark around him.</p>

<p>He started up in no little surprise, and, recalling where he
was, hastened along the path toward the camp.</p>

<p>"They'll be worried almost to death about me," was his thought,
"and I shouldn't wonder if they start out to hunt me up. Ah!"</p>

<p>The reverberating report of a rifle came from the direction of
the limestone rock, and he felt no doubt that it was meant as
a signal to direct him.</p>

<p>Herbert replied by firing his own gun in the air and shouting
that he was coming. He did not forget to place another cartridge
in his rifle, for, truth to tell, he was a little nervous over
this lonely tramp through the woods at such a late hour.</p>

<p>He listened, and heard the answering shout of Sam Harper, and,
communication being thus established, Herbert held his peace and
hastened forward as best he could in the faint moonlight.</p>

<p>"I hope I won't meet any sort of game now," was the wish of the
lad, "for I am in a hurry to join the boys&mdash;"</p>

<p>Could he believe his eyes!</p>

<p>He had hardly given expression to the wish, when a dark mass
loomed up to sight directly ahead of him, and he plainly saw the
gleam and glow of a pair of frightful eyes fixed upon him. He
was sure, too, that he had heard the threatening growl of the
monster, which might well believe he had the youngster in his
power.</p>

<p>"It's the bear, as sure as I'm alive!" gasped Herbert. "There's
no getting away from him! Heaven save me from missing, for if
my gun fails me now, it is all over! He won't give me time to
climb a tree, and I <em>must</em> shoot!"</p>
