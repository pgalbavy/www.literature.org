<p>I really think that if Jack Gedney had not known of the present
his father meant to make him he would have been too delighted
to act like a sensible boy. As it was, he could hardly keep from
hugging the handsome little gun when his father placed it in his
hands, and told him that it was his so long as he proved that
he knew how to use it, and that he had enough sense to be trusted
alone in the woods.</p>

<p>Unwilling to accept Jack’s promises, his father took down his
own weapon from the deer’s antlers over the broad fireplace, and
went a short distance with him to test the new piece.  On the
edge of the clearing he paused until the lad loaded the weapon
with powder and ball (for, of course, the cow’s horn and bullet
pouch went with the present), and then, looking among the branches
overhead, where several grey squirrels were whisking along the
limbs, he told Jack he might take his choice. During the few seconds
that the boy was darting his quick glances at the lively creatures
his father quietly cut a piece of hickory as thick as his thumb,
and three or four feet long.  Jack looked askance at him; he knew
well what it meant.</p>

<p>Since the youth had not yet fired his new gun, he decided to
make his task as light as he could.  He raised his piece and sighted
at a squirrel less than a hundred feet away, but before he could
make his aim sure his father spoke sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take the black one on the tree beyond."</p>

<p>It was a long and difficult shot, but Jack’s nerves were steady,
and a few seconds after he raised his rifle he pressed the trigger. 
The gun "hung fire" scarcely a moment, when a jet of flame shot
from the muzzle, and Mr. Gedney, who had his eyes fixed on the
squirrel, saw it vanish over the limb, and then come tumbling
and overturning through the branches to the ground.</p>

<p>"Fetch it here," commanded his father.</p>

<p>Without moving a step, Jack deliberately began re-loading his
piece, never pausing until the powder was poured in the pan and
the hammer let down in place.  The father half smiled, for he
had expected his boy to forget in his natural excitement the rule
about re-charging his gun.</p>

<p>Having finished, Jack walked forward to the foot of the tree,
picked up the small furry body where it lay among the leaves,
and brought it to his parent.  The latter took it from his hand,
glanced down, and then flung it aside, tossing the hickory after
it.</p>

<p>Shall I tell you why he cut that stick just before his boy fired
at the squirrel?  When he looked at the little animal he saw that
its head had been shot off. Had the bullet missed the head and
struck any other part of the body he would have plied that stick
about the legs and back of his boy until he yelled for mercy.
He had done it more than once, and he, like many another Kentuckian,
considered that that was the right way to train his child how
to shoot.</p>

<p>"Bark that one up there," said Mr. Gedney, pointing at another
of the creatures that was skurrying along one of the upper limbs,
its bushy tail spread out like an angry cat.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>As the sharp report rang out among the trees the squirrel at
which the boy fired flew up nearly a foot above the limb along
which it was running, as though thrown aloft by a steel spring,
and then it dropped through limbs and leaves to the ground, where
it lay stone dead.</p>

<p>An examination showed no wound upon it.  The bullet had been
sent directly beneath the body so as to chip off some of the bark,
which flew against the squirrel with such force as to knock the
life out of it. This is called "barking," and is sometimes practised
for the fun of the thing by skilful marksmen.</p>

<p>Having viewed the work of his boy, Mr. Gedney could find no fault.
Indeed, he did not expect him to do so well, knowing his agitation
over his present. He did not seem to think it worth while to praise
Jack, but, with a twinkle of his eye, he merely said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You’ll do; off with you!"</p>

<p>And without another word, Mr. Gedney, with his heavy rifle slung
over his shoulder, strode off to his cabin, leaving his boy to
spend the day as he chose, well knowing how he would pass it.</p>

<p>As I have told you, the nearest neighbours to Mr. Gedney were
the Burton family, who lived about a mile to the eastward.  Mr.
Burton was more fortunate than Mr. Gedney in the way of children,
for he had two boys, William and George, the one a year younger
and the other a year older than Jack, while Ruth, the daughter,
was a sweet girl of seven years.</p>

<p>It was natural that the two families should become fond of each
other, and that there should be much visiting on the part of the
parents as well as by the children.  There was hardly a night
that Jack was not at the Burton cabin, or his friends were not
at his own home.  They did a good deal of hunting together, and
the Burton boys were skilful with their guns, each one owning
a weapon light enough to be handled by its youthful owner.  I
must add, however, that neither of them was the equal of Jack,
as was proven in many contests between them.</p>

<p>Now Will and George Burton had known for several weeks of the
present that was to be made to Jack, and they were as pleased
as they could be over his coming good fortune.  What could be
more natural, therefore, than that Jack should set out for the
home of his young friends, that they might rejoice with him over
the prize that had fallen to his lot?</p>

<p>It was a bright sunshiny day in October when the proud boy set
out over the winding but well-worn path that led to the cabin
of the Burtons a mile away. The leaves on the trees were beginning
to turn yellow and red before, aflame with the beauties of autumn,
they fluttered to the ground.  It was a royal time for hunting,
for the deer, bears, buffaloes, and indeed all kinds of game,
were in prime condition.  The heart of the boy beat high with
the thought that many of these prizes must fall before that splendid
weapon of which he had just become the owner.</p>

<p>I am sure you would have said that Jack Gedney was a fine fellow,
could you have seen him as he strode along the path through the
Kentucky forest a hundred years ago.  In the first place, he was
rather large for his years, and erect, sturdy, and strong.  His
brown eyes sparkled with high health, and his round cheeks glowed
like the pulpy fulness of a red apple. The life that the young
pioneers led was one that was sure to make them strong, rugged,
and vigorous.</p>

<p>If you had met Jack in the streets of London or New York you
would have been struck by his dress. His cap was formed by the
deft fingers of his mother. It was of brown thick cloth, without
any forepiece, soft, warm, and able to stand a great deal of wear. 
Its make and pattern were such that no matter how it was put on
its head, it was in place.</p>

<p>His coat was of the same material, and it was intended to last
a good long time.  In some respects it resembled the suits often
worn by bicyclists of the present day, having a band that enclosed
the body just below the waist, while the skirt was only a few
inches in length.  The coat was buttoned down the front, and contained
several pockets within. Underneath the coat was the homespun shirt,
made by the spinning-wheel, under the guidance of his mother.</p>

<p>The resemblance of the dress to the bicycle suit of to-day was
made more striking by the trousers ending at the knee, below which
were the thick woollen stockings and heavy shoes.  During very
cold weather the stockings were protected by leggings, reaching
from the knee to the shoes.  I suppose you know that the fashion
of the trousers worn by you was altogether unknown during the
days of your great-parents.</p>

<p>Now, I am sure that none of us can blame Jack if, on this beautiful
October morning, when he slung his pretty rifle over his shoulder,
he threw his head a little farther back than usual, and stepped
off with a prouder step than he had ever shown when carrying the
heavy gun of his father.</p>

<p>"Ain’t she a beauty?" he asked himself, stopping short and bringing
the weapon round in front, so that he could admire it.  "Father
thought when I aimed at that first squirrel that I couldn’t knock
his head off; and," he added, with a smile, "I had some doubt
myself, but I noticed that he cut a bigger stick than usual, and
I didn’t want it swinging round my legs. I never clipped off a
squirrel’s head more neatly, though I barked the next one just
as well.  I wouldn’t mind now if I should meet a bear or a deer."</p>

<p>He had resumed his walk, and he looked sharply to the right and
left among the trees, but no game worthy of drawing his fire was
to be seen, and he kept on along the path, as alert and vigilant
as ever.</p>

<p>About half-way between Jack’s home and the cabin of his friends
the path descended into a slight hollow, through the bottom of
which wound a brook or small creek.  It was some ten feet in width,
and hardly half as deep.  For a short time after a violent rainfall
this stream was swollen to three or four times its ordinary volume,
but for a number of years it had not risen high enough to carry
away the bridge by which people crossed the stream.</p>

<p>This bridge was simply the trunk of a tree which had been felled
so as to lie with the stump across the stream.  While this could
not give as secure a footing as you would like in passing over
it, yet it was all that was wanted by those who had to use it. 
Had the means and all the necessary materials been at their command,
they would probably not have taken the trouble to put up a better
one. </p>
