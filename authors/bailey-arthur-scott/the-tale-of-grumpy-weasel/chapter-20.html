<p>Inside the jug, where he had hidden to escape Henry Hawk, Grumpy Weasel
yawned widely and licked his chops. He was having a dull time, waiting
until he was sure that Henry Hawk had given up the chase and gone away.
</p>
<p>In a little while Grumpy believed he could venture out in safety. But
suddenly, to his great disgust, a wagon came clattering in from the road
and pulled up right beside the pile of empty barrels near him.
</p><p>It was Farmer Brown, driving his old horse Ebenezer. And of course
Grumpy Weasel didn't care to show himself just then, especially with
old dog Spot nosing around. He had already heard Spot give several sharp
yelps.
</p><p>"That old dog knows I'm here somewhere but he can't tell exactly where,"
Grumpy said to himself. "He can yelp his head off, for all I care."
</p><p>And then Spot began to whine, and run in and out among the barrels,
until he all but tripped Farmer Green, who was loading the barrels into
the wagon.
</p><p>"Let him whine!" said Grumpy Weasel softly. "His yelping and whining
don't scare me. He can't get inside this jug of mine. And I certainly
shan't leave it so long as he stays here."
</p><p>Meanwhile he could hear Farmer Green talking to old Spot, telling him
not to be silly.
</p><p>"From the way you're acting anybody might think there was a bear around
here," he told Spot.
</p><p>Old dog Spot explained to Farmer Green in no uncertain fashion that it
was no bear--but a weasel--that he was looking for. His nose told him
that. And there was no mistake about it. But somehow Farmer Green
couldn't understand a word he said. So after putting the last barrel on
the load Farmer Green climbed up himself and started to drive off.
</p><p>But old dog Spot wouldn't budge an inch. He hovered about the jug where
Grumpy Weasel was hiding and made such a fuss that Farmer Green looked
back at him.
</p><p>"Well! well!" he exclaimed. And he stopped the horse Ebenezer and jumped
down and walked back again.
</p><p>"I declare I'd have forgotten to take this jug if you hadn't reminded me
of it," he told Spot. And thereupon he picked up the jug and set it in
the back of the wagon.
</p><p>This time Spot followed. This time he was in the wagon before Farmer
Green was. And all the way down the road, until they reached the
farmyard, he acted (or so Farmer Green told him!) like a simpleton.
</p><p>The whole affair made Grumpy Weasel terribly angry. He thought it was an
outrage for Farmer Green to kidnap him like that. And he was so enraged
that he would have taken a bite out of anything handy. But there wasn't
a thing in the jug except himself.
</p><p>At last the strange party drew up in front of the barn and stopped.
Farmer Green led Ebenezer into his stall. And then he took the jug, with
Grumpy Weasel still inside in, and in spite of Spot's protests set it
high up on a shelf in the barn.
</p><p>It was easy for Grumpy, after that, to crawl out of the jug. He scurried
along the shelf, climbed up the wall, and glided through a crack in the
ceiling, to hide himself in the haymow above.
</p><p>"Old Spot didn't get me this time!" he said gleefully. "Not by a jugful,
he didn't!"
