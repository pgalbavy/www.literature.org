<p>When Deerfoot, the Shawanoe, first saw the recovered hat of Otto
Relstaub, and tried hard to guess how it came to be left where
Jack Carleton found it, he recalled the words of Lone Bear to
the effect that it was placed over the face of the boy who was
deserted three days' journey away in the woods. The conclusion
was natural that the hat had been carried the intervening distance
by the boy himself, who must have recovered from the severe illness
that brought him low.</p>

<p>At the very moment the young warrior was beginning to suspect
the truth about the youth's illness, the faint report of a rifle
came to his ears. Necessarily there could be nothing in the sound
of the gun which could identify it, but Deerfoot was sure it was
fired by Otto, who was either defending himself against some danger
or was after his dinner.</p>

<p>Whatever the immediate cause, the Shawanoe felt that haste was
necessary to reach the fugitive, who was likely to be sought by
the Pawnees, who also must have heard the report of his rifle.
He therefore started on the pursuit, as it may be called, with
the Sauk and Jack Carleton at his heels.</p>

<p>That marvelous delicacy of hearing, which was one of the characteristics
of Deerfoot, enabled him not only to assure himself of the precise
direction of the sound, but to fix the point whence it came. Gaining
sight of the ridge, he was convinced that the lad who fired it
was in that vicinity. He therefore pointed out the portion which
was to be examined by the Sauk, while he reserved a similar area
to be gone over by himself&mdash;the difference being that he was confident
of finding Otto, provided he had not moved far from the spot where
he stood when he discharged his gun.</p>

<p>On the way thither, the Shawanoe glanced right and left in search
of the trail, but as an intervening storm had obliterated it,
and Deerfoot went in a direct line, he of course failed to find
it.</p>

<p>Otto Relstaub's woodcraft enabled him to travel intelligently
through the wilderness. The second storm overtook him just before
reaching the rocky ridge, and he was fortunate to find shelter
in a slight cave from the driving rain. Despite the peril from
which he had just escaped, he determined to stay where he was
until, so to speak, he could recruit. The wild turkeys, of which
I have spoken, were abundant in the neighborhood, and he had no
difficulty in killing one when he wanted it. He did so, on first
reaching the vicinity, and the last one was brought down at the
moment Deerfoot was studying the vexing problem as to what had
become of their young German friend.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was approaching the truth when, as I have said,
the report solved the mystery, and, while hurrying through the
woods with Jack and the Sauk, he was almost positive that they
would find the lad for whom they had sought so long in vain. He
did not believe, of course, that Otto had entirely feigned the
sickness which was the means of saving his life, for the story
of Lone Bear forbade that. He did suspect, however, that the captive
had been taken ill and probably made it appear worse than was
the case, and that, when left alone, he rapidly recovered and
took advantage of the surprising chance thus given him in perfect
innocence by the Pawnees. What struck Deerfoot as singular was
that the Indians should have been so deceived, and that none of
them returned afterward&mdash;excepting Red Wolf and Lone Bear&mdash;to
learn whether he had perished. Most likely they went over their
trail once more on their homeward journey. That of necessity must
have been so long after the abandonment of the lad, that (leaving
out of account the doing of Otto's friends) the Pawnees would
not make the effort to hunt again for the fugitive whose long
start put him beyond danger of recapture.</p>

<p>When Otto Relstaub had finished his story, Jack's eyes sparkled
and he again grasped the hand of his friend.</p>

<p>"It is the most wonderful experience of which I have ever heard.
I thought my escape from the Sauks was remarkable, and so it was,
but it can't compare with yours. I never knew of the Indians being
fooled in that manner; but show me where you have spent the last
day or two."</p>

<p>"It ishn't as fine as your cabin dot is home in Martinsville,
but it ish de best dot I can find."</p>

<p>"You're mighty lucky to find anything," was the remark of Jack
Carleton, following his young friend toward the rocky ridge which
had attracted the notice of the Shawanoe some time before.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether Deerfoot will find it?" said he, musing over
the strange experience of his friend; "I suppose you have left
plenty of footprints which he is likely to see and which will
guide him to the right spot."</p>

<p>"I vos going to leave dis place to-nights or to-morrow mornings,"
said Otto, quite proud of the part he was acting as guide of his
old friend, "but dinks dot I stays till I feels like being better."</p>

<p>Before Otto Relstaub could finish his remark, the crack of two
rifles cut short his words. At the same moment the whistling bullets
and the war whoops left no doubt of the explanation. Several Pawnees
had been prowling along their trail, when the sight of the boys
moving away led them to believe they had taken the alarm and were
trying to escape. Firing hastily, they broke into a run, with
less than a hundred yards separating pursuer and pursued.</p>

<p>"Fly, Otto!" called his companion; "if you can run, now is the
time; they're on our heels!"</p>

<p>As the German lad knew the right course, he was obliged to take
the lead, while Jack Carleton was behind him. The latter was much
the fleeter of foot, and it made him desperate to observe what
seemed the sluggish movements of his guide.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" he added, pushing him forward; "they will be on us in
a minute and then it's all up!"</p>

<p>"Yaw; I ish doing petter as nefer I couldn't does," replied Otto,
who in his excitement dropped back into his crooked words and
sentences.</p>

<p>"You ain't half trying, I've seen you do twice as well."</p>

<p>"Yaw; but I dinks&mdash;"</p>

<p>The catastrophe came. Like the immortal John Smith, Otto was
so busy with his eyes that he had no opportunity to watch where
his feet led him. He sprawled forward on his hands and knees,
and Jack Carleton narrowly missed going headlong over him. The
situation was too critical to laugh, and Otto, thoroughly scared,
was up again in an instant, plunging forward with unabated ardor.</p>

<p>The Pawnees lost no time, and the peril was of the most imminent
nature. But having regained his feet, Otto dashed forward with
the utmost speed he could command, so that the frightened Jack
could not find fault with his tardiness.</p>

<p>The leader was following no beaten path or clearly marked trail,
but was heading toward a point half way up the ridge, where a
mass of rocks rose higher than any others near them, and among
which the boy had found a refuge from the storm that drove him
thither&mdash;a storm which it may be necessary to say, was so local
in its character, that Deerfoot and his friends, who were not
far off, saw nothing of the elemental disturbance.</p>

<p>The Pawnees, who were seeking to surround the boys at the moment
they started, came from different points, all converging so as
to shut in the fugitives, as they would have done had a little
more time been given them. As it was, when Jack and Otto faced
the rocks, their enemies in their rear, one or two were uncomfortably
close.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was one fierce warrior nigh enough to interpose
across the path of the fugitives. Otto had taken a dozen steps
or so after climbing to his feet, when the savage, brandishing
his tomahawk in one hand while he grasped his gun in the other,
shouted continually some exclamation which was clearly a command
to halt, but which, it need not be said, was disobeyed.</p>

<p>Quick to see that he was wasting his breath, the red man, with
a couple of bounds, placed himself so directly in front of Otto
that the latter could not pass him without turning to one side.</p>

<p>"There's no use of fooling with that fellow," was the conclusion
of Jack Carleton, raising the hammer of his gun, without slackening
his speed; but before he could bring the weapon to his shoulder,
Otto stopped short, throwing up his gun at the same moment, and
let drive at the warrior, who could not have had any suspicion
that he was in danger until the red tongue shot from the muzzle
almost in his face, and then scarce time was given him to know
what was coming when his interest in earthly things ceased.</p>

<p>With an ear-splitting screech, he flung up both arms, the gun
and tomahawk flying several feet in the air from the spasmodic
movement, and he went forward on his face, head and shoulders
being thrown so far back that his chest struck the ground first,
chin and forehead following like the rockers of a chair.</p>

<p>"Well done!" called out Jack. "Push ahead and we shall be safe."</p>

<p>Suddenly Otto slackened and turned about with a blanched face.</p>

<p>"Mein gracious! I dinks I hef got de wrong road!"</p>

<p>Jack was in despair; then he was angered.</p>

<p>"Go on; go <em>somewhere</em>; don't stop here!" he said.</p>

<p>And he almost shoved him off his feet in his desperate impatience.</p>

<p>"Vosn't dot fooney?" said Otto, breaking into another desperate
run; "it is the road arter all."</p>

<p>Not only at that moment, but for some time previous, it must
have been in the power of the Pawnees to bring down both boys
by shots from their guns. The intervening space was so brief,
that all could not have missed, and when Otto made his last dash
for safety, Jack Carleton was in such a direct line behind him,
that a single well-aimed bullet would have laid both low; but
the Indians, confident there was no escape for the boys, determined
to make both prisoners.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, the Shawanoe, always referred to the action of the
red men at that time as almost unexplainable. They must have known
that the youths had friends close by, and that one of them was
the young warrior whom they believed to be in league with the
Evil One. The footprints which had guided them through the forest
told that fact. There were only four Pawnees (one of whom was
the warrior whom Deerfoot and Hay-uta held a prisoner the night
before, and then allowed to go), and as the number of fugitives,
if such they may be called, was the same, the advantage certainly
could not be claimed by the hostiles. What common sense directed
was for them to shoot the boys, and then withdraw, at least until
re-enforcements arrived. Their failure to do so was a piece of
shortsightedness which neither the Shawanoe nor Sauk understood.</p>

<p>The respite gained by the quick shot of Otto Relstaub was provident;
it threw every one of their pursuers behind them, and the redoubled
efforts of the lads carried them swiftly over the remaining space.</p>

<p>"Here we ish!" exclaimed the panting Otto, almost falling again.</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded the terrified friend; "I don't see anything
like the cave you told me about."</p>

<p>"It ish de pest dot we have," replied the German lad, noticing
the disappointment of his companion.</p>
