<p>As Mrs. Hardesty guessed, Rimrock was hurrying away in order to follow
Mary Fortune; and as Rimrock guessed, she had invited him in to keep
him from doing just that.  She failed, for once, and it hurt her pride;
but Rimrock failed as well.  After a swift spin through the streets he
returned to his hotel and called up his detective in a rage.
</p><p>"Say, what kind of an agency are you running, anyhow?" he demanded when
he got his man.  "Ain't you been working ten months to find Mary
Fortune?  Well, I met her to-night, on the street.  What's that you
say?  There's three million people!  Well, I don't care if there's
six--I want you to find that girl!  No, stop her nothing!  You lay a
hand on her and I'll come down to your office and kill you.  Just tell
me where she is and keep an eye on her and I don't care what you
charge.  And paste this in your hat--if you don't find that girl you'll
have to sue for your pay!"
</p><p>The agency had to sue, for ten days later, Rimrock received a letter
from her hand.  It was mailed from Gunsight, Arizona, and was strictly
business throughout.  It was, in fact, the legal thirty days' notice of
the annual meeting of the Company
</p>
<p>"in the town of Gunsight, county of Geronimo, Territory of Arizona, on
Tuesday, the 22nd day of December, to transact the following business,
viz:
</p><p>"1--to elect a Board of Directors
</p><p>"2--to transact any other business that may properly come before the
meeting."
</p>
<p>Rimrock read it over and his courage failed him--after all he was
afraid to face her.  He did not flatter himself that she hated him; she
despised him, and on account of Mrs. Hardesty.  How then could he
hasten back to Gunsight and beg for a chance to explain?  She had fled
from his presence ten months before, on the day after Mrs. Hardesty
came; and ten months later, when she met him by accident, he was with
Mrs. Hardesty again.  As far as he knew Mrs. Hardesty was a perfect
lady.  She went out everywhere and was received even by millionaires on
terms of perfect equality--and yet Mary Fortune scorned her.  She
scorned her on sight, at a single glance, and would not even argue the
matter.  Rimrock decided to use "the enclosed proxy."
</p><p>He made it out in the name of L. W. Lockhart and returned it by the
following mail, and then he called up the detective agency and told
them to go ahead and sue.  He told them further that he was willing to
bet that Stoddard knew where she was all the time; and if they were
still working for him, as he strongly suspected, they could tell him
she was back in Gunsight.  Rimrock hung up there and fell to pacing the
floor and for the first time the busy city looked gray.  It looked drab
and dirty and he thought longingly of the desert with its miles and
miles of clean sand.  He thought of his mine and how he had fought for
it, and of all his friends in the straggling town; of Old Juan and L.
W. and hearty Old Hassayamp with his laugh and his Texas yupe.  And of
Mary Fortune, the typist, as he had known her at first--but now she was
sending letters like this:
</p>
<p><strong>"DEAR SIR:</strong>
</p><p>You are hereby notified that the regular Annual Meeting of the
Stockholders of the Tecolote Mining Company will be held at the offices
of the Company, in the Tecolote Hotel," etc., etc.
</p>
<p>Rimrock threw down the letter and cursed himself heartily for a fool, a
chump and a blackguard.  With a girl like that, and standing all she
had from him, to lose her over Mrs. Hardesty!  Who was Mrs. Hardesty?
And why had she gone to Gunsight and fetched him back to New York?  Was
it because he was crazy that he had the idea that she was an agent,
somehow, of Stoddard?  That two thousand shares of Tecolote stock that
she had assured him Stoddard had sold her, wasn't it part of their
scheme to lure him away and break up his friendship with Mary?  Because
if Mrs. Hardesty had it she had never produced it, and there was no
record of the transfer on the books.  Rimrock brought down his fist and
swore a great oath never to see the woman again.  From the day he met
her his troubles had begun--and now she claimed she loved him!
</p><p>Rimrock curled his lip at the very thought of any New York woman in
love.  There was only one woman who knew what the word meant and she
was in Gunsight, Arizona.  He picked up her letter and scanned it
again, but his eyes had not learned to look for love.  Even the driest
formula, sent from one to another, may spell out that magic word; may
spell it unconsciously and against the will, if the heart but rules the
hand.  Mary Fortune had told him in that briefest of messages that she
was back in Gunsight again; and furthermore, if he wished to see her,
he could do so in thirty days.  It told him, in fact, that while their
personal relations had been terminated by his own unconsidered acts; as
fellow stockholders, perhaps even as partners, they might meet and work
together again.  But Rimrock was dense, his keen eyes could not see it,
nor his torn heart find the peace that he sought.  Like a wounded
animal he turned on his enemy and fought Stoddard to keep down the
pain.  And back at Gunsight, trying to forget her hate, Mary Fortune
fought her battle alone.
</p><p>There was great excitement--it amounted almost to a panic--when Mary
Fortune stepped in on Jepson.  During her unexplained absence he had
naturally taken charge of things, with L. W. of course, to advise; and
to facilitate business he had moved into the main office where he could
work with the records at hand.  Then, as months went by and neither she
nor Rimrock came back to assert their authority, he had rearranged the
offices and moved her records away.  Behind the main office, with its
plate-glass windows and imposing furniture and front, there were two
smaller rooms; the Directors' meeting place and another, now filled
with Mary's records.  A clerk, who did not even know who she was, sat
at his ease behind her fine desk; and back in the Directors' room, with
its convenient table, L. W. and Jepson were in conference.  She could
see them plainly through the half-opened door, leaning back and smoking
their cigars, and in that first brief interval before they caught sight
of her she sensed that something was wrong.
</p><p>Of course there were apologies, and Jepson insisted upon moving out or
giving her any room she chose, but Mary assured him she had not come
back permanently and the smaller room would do just as well.  Then she
set about writing the notices of the annual meeting, which had to be
sent out by her hand, and Jepson recovered from his fright.  Perhaps he
recovered too much; for Mary Fortune had intuitions, and she remembered
that first glimpse of L. W.  As the agent of Rimrock and his legal
representative it was desirable, of course, to be friends; but Jepson,
it was well known, was the agent of Stoddard and Stoddard was after
their mine.  Therefore it ill became Lockhart, with one treachery
against him, to be found smoking so comfortably with Jepson.
</p><p>So astonished and stunned had she been by the changes and the sudden
suspicions that arose that Mary at first had stood startled and silent,
and Jepson had raised his voice.  At this he remembered that she had
gone East for an operation to help restore her hearing and, seeing her
now so unresponsive, he immediately assumed the worst.  So he shouted
his explanations and Mary, flushing, informed him that she could hear
very well.
</p><p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," he apologized abjectly; but she noticed that
he kept on shouting.  And then in a flash of sudden resentment she bit
her lips and let him shout.  If he still wished to think that she was
deaf as a post she would not correct him again.  Perhaps if her
suspicions should prove to be justified it would help her to discover
his plans.
</p><p>In her room that evening Mary brought from her trunk the ear-'phone she
had cast aside.  She had packed it away with a sigh of relief and yet a
lingering fear for the future, and already she was putting it on.  At
the back of the transmitter there was a mechanical device which
regulated the intensity of the sound.  When she settled the clasp
across her head and hung the 'phone over her ear she set it at normal
and then advanced the dial until she could hear the faintest noise.
The roar of the lobby, drifting in through the transom, became
separated into its various sounds.  She could hear men talking and
outbursts of laughter and the scrape of moving chairs.  The murmur of
conversation in the adjoining room became a spat between husband and
wife and, ashamed of her eavesdropping, she put down the instrument and
looked about, half afraid.
</p><p>As the doctor through his stethoscope can hear the inrush of air as it
is drawn into the patient's lungs, or the surge of blood as it is
pumped through the heart with every telltale gurgle of the valves; so
with that powerful instrument she could hear through walls and know
what was being said.  It was a wonderful advantage to have over these
men if she discovered that there was treachery afoot and the following
morning, to test it out, she wore her 'phone to the office.
</p><p>"Mr. Jepson," she said as he rose nervously to meet her, "I'd like to
bring my books down to date.  Of course it is mostly a matter of form,
or I couldn't have been gone for so long, but I want to look over the
records of the office and make out my annual report."
</p><p>"Why, certainly," responded Jepson, still speaking very clearly, and
assuming his most placating smile, "I'd be glad to have you check up.
With Mr. Jones away I've been so pressed by work I hardly know where we
are.  Just make yourself at home and anything I can do for you, please
feel free to let me know."
</p><p>She thanked him politely and then, as she ran through the files, she
absently removed her ear-'phone.
</p><p>"Just hold out that report of the mining experts," she heard Jepson
remark to his clerk; and in an instant her suspicions were confirmed.
He had had experts at work, making a report on their property, but he
wished to withhold it from her.  That report was doubtless for Whitney
H. Stoddard, the only man that Jepson really served, the man who
actually controlled their mine.  But she worked on unheeding and
presently, from across the room, she heard him speak again.  His voice
was low, but the painful operations, the tedious treatments she had
endured, had sharpened her hearing until she caught every word except
the mumbled assent of the clerk.
</p><p>"And tell Mr. Lockhart I'll arrange about that rebate.  The check will
go directly to him."
</p><p>He went on then with some hurried directions about the different
accounts to be changed and then, without troubling to shout at her
again, he turned and slipped away.  She had found him out, then, the
very first day--Mr. Jepson had an understanding with L. W.!  She
retired to her room to think it over and then went systematically to
work on the books, but these seemed scrupulously correct.  The
influence of Stoddard, that apostle of thoroughness, was apparent
throughout the office; for Jepson well knew that the day was coming
when he must render an account to his master.  The books were correct,
yet she could hardly believe the marvellous production they recorded.
Her share alone--a poor one per cent. of all that enormous
profit--would keep her in comfort for the rest of her life; she need
never work again.
</p><p>But as the days went by and the yearly profit was reduced to dollars
and cents; as she looked over the statement from L. W.'s bank and saw
the money piling up to their credit; the first thrill of joy gave way
to fear--of Stoddard, and what he might do.  With interests so vast
lying unprotected what could restrain his ruthless hand?  And yet there
was Rimrock, wrecking his life in New York and letting her watch their
mine alone!  A wave of resentment rose up at the thought--it was the
old hatred that she tried to fight down--and she clasped her hands and
gazed straight ahead as she beheld in a vision, the woman!  A lank rag
of a woman, a Kipling's vampire, who lived by the blood of strong men!
And to think that she should have fastened on Rimrock, who was once so
faithful and true!
</p><p>For the thousandth time there rose up in her mind the old Rimrock as
she had seen him first--a lean, sunburned man on a buckskin horse with
a pistol slung at his hip; a desert miner, clean, laughing, eager,
following on after his dream of riches.  But now, soft and fat, in top
hat and diamonds, swaggering past with that woman on his arm!  It would
be a blessing for them both if Stoddard should jump the mine and put
them back where they were before--he a hardy prospector; and she a poor
typist, with a dream!  But the dream was gone, destroyed forever, and
all she could do was to fight on.
</p><p>As she waited for his letter from day to day, Mary Fortune thought
incessantly of Rimrock.  She went out to the mine and gazed at the
great workings where men appeared no larger than ants.  She watched the
ore being scooped up with steam shovels and dropped load by load into
cars; she saw it crushed and pulverized and washed and the concentrates
dumped into more cars; and then the endless chain of copper going out
and the trainloads of supplies coming in.  It was his, if he would come
to it; every man would obey him; his orders would tear down a mountain;
and yet he chose to grow fat and sordid, he preferred that woman to her!
</p><p>She fought against it, but the anger still raged that had driven her
fleeing from New York.  How could she endure it, to meet him again?
And yet she hoped he would come.  She hated him, but still she waited
and at last his letter came.  She tore it open and drew out his proxy;
and then in the quiet of her office she sat silent, while the letter
lay trembling in her hands.  This was his answer to her, who had
endured so much for him, his answer to her invitation to come.  He
enclosed his proxy for L. W.
</p><p>She began on a letter, full of passionate reproaches, and tore it up in
a rage.  Then she wrote another, and tore it up, and burst into a storm
of tears.  She rose up at last and, dry-eyed and quiet, typed a note
and sent it away.  It was a formal receipt for his proxy for Lockhart
and was signed: Mary R. Fortune, Secretary.
