<P>
 THE calling of the new witness provoked a burst of laughter
among the audience due partly, no doubt, to the strange name by
which he had been summoned; partly, also, to the instinctive
desire of all crowded assemblies, when their interest is
painfully excited, to seize on any relief in the shape of the
first subject of merriment which may present itself. A severe
rebuke from the Bench restored order among the audience. The Lord
Justice Clerk declared that he would "clear the Court" if the
interruption to the proceedings were renewed.
<P>
During the silence which followed this announcement the new
witness appeared.
<P>
Gliding, self-propelled in his chair on wheels, through the
opening made for him among the crowd, a strange and startling
creature--literally the half of a man--revealed himself to the
general view. A coverlet which had been thrown over his chair had
fallen off during his progress through the throng. The loss of it
exposed to the public curiosity the head, the arms, and the trunk
of a living human being: absolutely deprived of the lower limbs.
To make this deformity all the more striking and all the more
terrible, the victim of it was--as to his face and his body--an
unusually handsome and an unusually well-made man. His long silky
hair, of a bright and beautiful chestnut color, fell over
shoulders that were the perfection of strength and grace. His
face was bright with vivacity and intelligence. His large clear
blue eyes and his long delicate white hands were like the eyes
and hands of a beautiful woman. He would have looked effeminate
but for the manly proportions of his throat and chest, aided in
their effect by his flowing beard and long mustache, of a lighter
chestnut shade than the color of his hair. Never had a
magnificent head and body been more hopelessly ill-bestowed than
in this instance! Never had Nature committed a more careless or a
more cruel mistake than in the making of this man!
<P>
He was sworn, seated, of course, in his chair. Having given his
name, he bowed to the Judges and requested their permission to
preface his evidence with a word of explanation.
<P>
"People generally laugh when they first hear my strange Christian
name," he said, in a low, clear, resonant voice which penetrated
to the remotest corners of the Court. "I may inform the good
people here that many names, still common among us, have their
significations, and that mine is one of them. 'Alexander,' for
instance, means, in the Greek, 'a helper of men.' 'David' means,
in Hebrew, 'well-beloved.' 'Francis' means, in German, 'free.' My
name, 'Miserrimus,' means, in Latin, 'most unhappy.' It was given
to me by my father, in allusion to the deformity which you all
see--the deformity with which it was my misfortune to be born.
You won't laugh at 'Miserrimus' again, will you?" He turned to
the Dean of Faculty, waiting to examine him for the defense. "Mr.
Dean. I am at your service. I apologize for delaying, even for a
moment, the proceedings of the Court."
<P>
He delivered his little address with perfect grace and
good-humor. Examined by the Dean, he gave his evidence clearly,
without the slightest appearance of hesitation or reserve.
<P>
"I was staying at Gleninch as a guest in the house at the time of
Mrs. Eustace Macallan's death," he began. "Doctor Jerome and Mr.
Gale desired to see me at a private interview--the prisoner being
then in a state of prostration which made it impossible for him
to attend to his duties as master of the house. At this interview
the two doctors astonished and horrified me by declaring that
Mrs. Eustace Macallan had died poisoned. They left it to me to
communicate the dreadful news to her husband, and they warned me
that a post-mortem examination must be held on the body.
<P>
"If the Fiscal had seen my old friend when I communicated the
doctors' message, I doubt if he would have ventured to charge the
prisoner with the murder of his wife. To my mind the charge was
nothing less than an outrage. I resisted the seizure of the
prisoner's Diary and letters, animated by that feeling. Now that
the Diary has been produced, I agree with the prisoner's mother
in denying that it is fair evidence to bring against him. A Diary
(when it extends beyond a bare record of facts and dates) is
nothing but an expression of the poorest and weakest side in the
character of the person who keeps it. It is, in nine cases out of
ten, the more or less contemptible outpouring of vanity and
conceit which the writer dare not exhibit to any mortal but
himself. I am the prisoner's oldest friend. I solemnly declare
that I never knew he could write downright nonsense until I heard
his Diary read in this Court!
<P>
"_He_ kill his wife! _He_ treat his wife with neglect and
cruelty! I venture to say, from twenty years' experience of him,
that there is no man in this assembly who is constitutionally
more incapable of crime and more incapable of cruelty than the
man who stands at the Bar. While I am about it, I go further
still. I even doubt whether a man capable of crime and capable of
cruelty could have found it in his heart to do evil to the woman
whose untimely death is the subject of this inquiry.
<P>
"I have heard what the ignorant and prejudiced nurse, Christina
Ormsay, has said of the deceased lady. From my own personal
observation, I contradict every word of it. Mrs. Eustace
Macallan--granting her personal defects--was nevertheless one of
the most charming women I ever met with. She was highly bred, in
the best sense of the word. I never saw in any other person so
sweet a smile as hers, or such grace and beauty of movement as
hers. If you liked music, she sang beautifully; and few professed
musicians had such a touch on the piano as hers. If you preferred
talking, I never yet met with the man (or even the woman, which
is saying a great deal more) whom her conversation could not
charm. To say that such a wife as this could be first cruelly
neglected, and then barbarously murdered, by the man--no! by the
martyr--who stands there, is to tell me that the sun never shines
at noonday, or that the heaven is not above the earth.
<P>
"Oh yes! I know that the letters of her friends show that she
wrote to them in bitter complaint of her husband's conduct to
her. But remember what one of those friends (the wisest and the
best of them) says in reply. 'I own to thinking,' she writes,
'that your sensitive nature exaggerates
 or misinterprets the neglect that you experience at the hands of
your husband.' There, in that one sentence, is the whole truth!
Mrs. Eustace Macallan's nature was the imaginative,
self-tormenting nature of a poet. No mortal love could ever have
been refined enough for _her._ Trifles which women of a coarser
moral fiber would have passed over without notice, were causes of
downright agony to that exquisitely sensitive temperament. There
are persons born to be unhappy. That poor lady was one of them.
When I have said this, I have said all.
<P>
"No! There is one word more still to be added.
<P>
"It may be as well to remind the prosecution that Mrs. Eustace
Macallan's death was in the pecuniary sense a serious loss to her
husband. He had insisted on having the whole of her fortune
settled on herself, and on her relatives after her, when he
married. Her income from that fortune helped to keep in splendor
the house and grounds at Gleninch. The prisoner's own resources
(aided even by his mother's jointure) were quite inadequate fitly
to defray the expenses of living at his splendid country-seat.
Knowing all the circumstances, I can positively assert that the
wife's death has deprived the husband of two-thirds of his
income. And the prosecution, viewing him as the basest and
cruelest of men, declares that he deliberately killed her--with
all his pecuniary interests pointing to the preservation of her
life!
<P>
"It is useless to ask me whether I noticed anything in the
conduct of the prisoner and Mrs. Beauly which might justify a
wife's jealousy. I never observed Mrs. Beauly with any attention,
and I never encouraged the prisoner in talking to me about her.
He was a general admirer of pretty women--so far as I know, in a
perfectly innocent way. That he could prefer Mrs. Beauly to his
wife is inconceivable to me, unless he were out of his senses. I
never had any reason to believe that he was out of his senses.
<P>
"As to the question of the arsenic--I mean the question of
tracing that poison to the possession of Mrs. Eustace Macallan--I
am able to give evidence which may, perhaps, be worthy of the
attention of the Court.
<P>
"I was present in the Fiscal's office during the examination of
the papers, and of the other objects discovered at Gleninch. The
dressing-case belonging to the deceased lady was shown to me
after its contents had been officially investigated by the Fiscal
himself. I happen to have a very sensitive sense of touch. In
handling the lid of the dressing-case, on the inner side I felt
something at a certain place which induced me to examine the
whole structure of the lid very carefully. The result was the
discovery of a private repository concealed in the space between
the outer wood and the lining. In that repository I found the
bottle which I now produce."
<P>
The further examination of the witness was suspended while the
hidden bottle was compared with the bottles properly belonging to
the dressing-case.
<P>
These last were of the finest cut glass, and of a very elegant
form--entirely unlike the bottle found in the private repository,
which was of the commonest manufacture, and of the shape
ordinarily in use among chemists. Not a drop of liquid, not the
smallest atom of any solid substance, remained in it. No smell
exhaled from it--and, more unfortunately still for the interests
of the defense, no label was found attached to the bottle when it
had been discovered.
<P>
The chemist who had sold the second supply of arsenic to the
prisoner was recalled and examined. He declared that the bottle
was exactly like the bottle in which he had placed the arsenic.
It was, however, equally like hundreds of other bottles in his
shop. In the absence of the label (on which he had himself
written the word "Poison"), it was impossible for him to identify
the bottle. The dressing-case and the deceased lady's bedroom had
been vainly searched for the chemist's missing label--on the
chance that it might have become accidentally detached from the
mysterious empty bottle. In both instances the search had been
without result. Morally, it was a fair conclusion that this might
be really the bottle which had contained the poison. Legally,
there was not the slightest proof of it.
<P>
Thus ended the last effort of the defense to trace the arsenic
purchased by the prisoner to the possession of his wife. The book
relating the practices of the Styrian peasantry (found in the
deceased lady's room) had been produced But could the book prove
that she had asked her husband to buy arsenic for her? The
crumpled paper, with the grains of powder left in it, had been
identified by the chemist, and had been declared to contain
grains of arsenic. But where was the proof that Mrs. Eustace
Macallan's hand had placed the packet in the cabinet, and had
emptied it of its contents? No direct evidence anywhere! Nothing
but conjecture!
<P>
The renewed examination of Miserrimus Dexter touched on matters
of no general interest. The cross-examination resolved itself, in
substance, into a mental trial of strength between the witness
and the Lord Advocate; the struggle terminating (according to the
general opinion) in favor of the witness. One question and one
answer only I will repeat here. They appeared to me to be of
serious importance to the object that I had in view in reading
the Trial.
<P>
"I believe, Mr. Dexter," the Lord Advocate remarked, in his most
ironical manner, "that you have a theory of your own, which makes
the death of Mrs. Eustace Macallan no mystery to _you?_"
<P>
"I may have my own ideas on that subject, as on other subjects,"
the witness replied. "But let me ask their lordships, the Judges:
Am I here to declare theories or to state facts?"
<P>
I made a note of that answer. Mr. Dexter's "ideas" were the ideas
of a true friend to my husband, and of a man of far more than
average ability. They might be of inestimable value to me in the
coming time--if I could prevail on him to communicate them.
<P>
I may mention, while I am writing on the subject, that I added to
this first note a second, containing an observation of my own. In
alluding to Mrs. Beauly, while he was giving his evidence, Mr.
Dexter had spoken of her so slightingly--so rudely, I might
almost say--as to suggest he had some strong private reasons for
disliking (perhaps for distrusting) this lady. Here, again, it
might be of vital importance to me to see Mr. Dexter, and to
clear up, if I could, what the dignity of the Court had passed
over without notice.
<P>
 The last witness had been now examined. The chair on wheels
glided away with the half-man in it, and was lost in a distant
corner of the Court. The Lord Advocate rose to address the Jury
for the prosecution.
<P>
I do not scruple to say that I never read anything so infamous as
this great lawyer's speech. He was not ashamed to declare, at
starting, that he firmly believed the prisoner to be guilty. What
right had he to say anything of the sort? Was it for _him_ to
decide? Was he the Judge and Jury both, I should like to know?
Having begun by condemning the prisoner on his own authority, the
Lord Advocate proceeded to pervert the most innocent actions of
that unhappy man so as to give them as vile an aspect as
possible. Thus: When Eustace kissed his poor wife's forehead on
her death-bed, he did it to create a favorable impression in the
minds of the doctor and the nurse! Again, when his grief under
his bereavement completely overwhelmed him, he was triumphing in
secret, and acting a part! If you looked into his heart, you
would see there a diabolical hatred for his wife and an
infatuated passion for Mrs. Beauly! In everything he had said he
had lied; in everything he had done he had acted like a crafty
and heartless wretch! So the chief counsel for the prosecution
spoke of the prisoner, standing helpless before him at the Bar.
In my husband's place, if I could have done nothing more, I would
have thrown something at his head. As it was, I tore the pages
which contained the speech for the prosecution out of the Report
and trampled them under my feet--and felt all the better too for
having done it. At the same time I feel a little ashamed of
having revenged myself on the harmless printed leaves n ow.
<P>
The fifth day of the Trial opened with the speech for the
defense. Ah, what a contrast to the infamies uttered by the Lord
Advocate was the grand burst of eloquence by the Dean of Faculty,
speaking on my husband's side!
<P>
This illustrious lawyer struck the right note at starting.
<P>
"I yield to no one," he began, "in the pity I feel for the wife.
But I say, the martyr in this case, from first to last, is the
husband. Whatever the poor woman may have endured, that unhappy
man at the Bar has suffered, and is now suffering, more. If he
had not been the kindest of men, the most docile and most devoted
of husbands, he would never have occupied his present dreadful
situation. A man of a meaner and harder nature would have felt
suspicions of his wife's motives when she asked him to buy
poison--would have seen through the wretchedly commonplace
excuses she made for wanting it--and would have wisely and
cruelly said, 'No.' The prisoner is not that sort of man. He is
too good to his wife, too innocent of any evil thought toward
her, or toward any one, to foresee the inconveniences and the
dangers to which his fatal compliance may expose him. And what is
the result? He stands there, branded as a murderer, because he
was too high-minded and too honorable to suspect his wife."
<P>
Speaking thus of the husband, the Dean was just as eloquent and
just as unanswerable when he came to speak of the wife.
<P>
"The Lord Advocate," he said, "has asked, with the bitter irony
for which he is celebrated at the Scottish Bar, why we have
failed entirely to prove that the prisoner placed the two packets
of poison in the possession of his wife. I say, in answer, we
have proved, first, that the wife was passionately attached to
the husband; secondly, that she felt bitterly the defects in her
personal appearance, and especially the defects in her
complexion; and, thirdly, that she was informed of arsenic as a
supposed remedy for those defects, taken internally. To men who
know anything of human nature, there is proof enough. Does my
learned friend actually suppose that women are in the habit of
mentioning the secret artifices and applications by which they
improve their personal appearance? Is it in his experience of the
sex that a woman who is eagerly bent on making herself attractive
to a man would tell that man, or tell anybody else who might
communicate with him, that the charm by which she hoped to win
his heart--say the charm of a pretty complexion--had been
artificially acquired by the perilous use of a deadly poison? The
bare idea of such a thing is absurd. Of course nobody ever heard
Mrs. Eustace Macallan speak of arsenic. Of course nobody ever
surprised her in the act of taking arsenic. It is in the evidence
that she would not even confide her intention to try the poison
to the friends who had told her of it as a remedy, and who had
got her the book. She actually begged them to consider their
brief conversation on the subject as strictly private. From first
to last, poor creature, she kept her secret; just as she would
have kept her secret if she had worn false hair, or if she had
been indebted to the dentist for her teeth. And there you see her
husband, in peril of his life, because a woman acted _like_ a
woman--as your wives, gentlemen of the Jury, would, in a similar
position, act toward You."
<P>
After such glorious oratory as this (I wish I had room to quote
more of it!), the next, and last, speech delivered at the
Trial--that is to say, the Charge of the Judge to the Jury--is
dreary reading indeed.
<P>
His lordship first told the Jury that they could not expect to
have direct evidence of the poisoning. Such evidence hardly ever
occurred in cases of poisoning. They must be satisfied with the
best circumstantial evidence. All quite true, I dare say. But,
having told the Jury they might accept circumstantial evidence,
he turned back again on his own words, and warned them against
being too ready to trust it! "You must have evidence satisfactory
and convincing to your own minds," he said, "in which you find no
conjectures--but only irresistible and just inferences." Who is
to decide what is a just inference? And what is circumstantial
evidence _but_ conjecture?
<P>
After this specimen, I need give no further extracts from the
summing up. The Jury, thoroughly bewildered no doubt, took refuge
in a compromise. They occupied an hour in considering and
debating among themselves in their own room. (A jury of women
would not have taken a minute!) Then they returned into Court,
and gave their timid and trimming Scotch Verdict in these words:
<P>
"Not Proven."
<P>
Some slight applause followed among the audience, which was
instantly checked. The prisoner was dismissed from the Bar. He
slowly retired, like a man in deep grief: his head sunk on his
breast--not looking at any one, and not replying when his friends
spoke to him. He knew, poor fellow, the slur that the Verdict
left on him. "We don't say you are innocent of the crime charged
against you; we only say there is not evidence enough to convict
you." In that lame and impotent conclusion the proceedings ended
at the time. And there they would have remained for all time--but
for Me.
