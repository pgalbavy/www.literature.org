<p>Harvey Hamilton was anything but pleased over the actions of
Detective Pendar in dashing off as he did without a word of explanation.
He expected to accompany him, and would have followed but through
fear of offending his friend. The youth could not forget that
he possessed nothing in the nature of a weapon and was more likely
to prove a hindrance rather than a help to the officer.</p>

<p>"He is a brave man,—a reckless one," he reflected, "thus to rush
upon a desperate gang who are armed and will stop at no crime.
Hello! what does that mean?"</p>

<p>He had stepped down from his seat and glanced over his machine,
when chancing to look up in the sky he recognized the monoplane
of Professor Morgan, already near the spot where the young aviator
had seen the ruined shanty not long before, with the little girl
playing in front of it.</p>

<p>The discovery that the odd character had not wrecked his first
machine, but had been the means of his securing a second with
remarkable promptness, changed the resentment of the youth to
the kindliest feelings toward the man. He watched the actions
with fascinated interest, for the distance was so slight that
everything was visible. It has been said that one of the achievements
of Professor Morgan was the knack of running his monoplane with
scarcely any perceptible noise. A misty, whirring object under
his perch showed that the "uplifter" was doing its effective work
and holding the machine motionless over the place desired.</p>

<p>It was far enough for the intervening forest to muffle the voices
of the airman and the detective, who tried desperately to prevent
his dropping the bomb which wrought such frightful havoc. In the
flurry of the occasion, Harvey had not recovered his field glass
from his friend, an oversight which he regretted, for it would
have helped greatly in learning precisely what the Professor was
doing. But his unaided eyes told him enough to suggest a shrewd
guess.</p>

<p>"He is going to launch a bomb, and if he does, it won’t be a
giant cracker, which gave those young men such a big scare the
other day."</p>

<p>A minute later came the tremendous report, and Harvey felt the
ground tremble. A mass of smoke and flying fragments rose over
the spot where the shanty had stood.</p>

<p>"He has blown up the building and every one in it!" gasped the
startled youth. "I wonder whether the child has been hurt; Pendar
can take care of himself."</p>

<p>Harvey hesitated whether to run to the spot, and had made up
his mind to do so, when he was checked by an incident that in
its way was as startling as the explosion.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that he had brought his aeroplane to rest
in the large clearing in front of the humble home of Uncle Tommy
Waters, the weather prophet. Had the circumstances been different,
he would have given attention to the house and its occupants,
but the thrilling incidents in course of happening elsewhere kept
his eyes turned in the opposite direction, and the cabin might
as well have been a hundred miles distant for all he knew of it
for the time.</p>

<p>That which caught his attention with the suddenness of a snap
of a whip in his ear and caused him to whirl the other way was
a childish voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, isn’t that a funny thing?"</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton was struck speechless for a moment by the sight
that greeted his eyes. Two little girls, one freckled, homely,
and poorly dressed, the other pretty, with clustering curls and
in fine clothes, stood side by side, no more than a dozen paces
distant, staring wonderingly at him and the aeroplane. The third
member of the group was an immense shaggy dog as black as midnight,
which stood wagging his tail as if pleased with what he saw. In
the door of the cabin behind them was the pudgy wife of Uncle
Tommy, also staring and seemingly at a loss to comprehend the
strange doings and sights. Uncle Tommy was not visible, having
gone to Chesterton earlier in the day, with the time of his return
uncertain.</p>

<p>Harvey beckoned the children to draw near. With some timidity
they did so, the dog following as if to see that no harm befell
either. The two halted a few steps away and smiled, the homely
one with her forefinger between her lips and her head to one side.
Her companion showed no embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Your name is Grace Hastings, isn’t it?" asked the young aviator,
in a kindly voice and with a rapidly beating heart.</p>

<p>"Yes,—what’s your name?" she asked with winsome confidence.</p>

<p>"Harvey Hamilton; wouldn’t you like to go home to mamma?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes indeed; won’t you——"</p>

<p>She suddenly broke down and sobbed.</p>

<p>"There, my dear; you mustn’t cry, for we are going to take you
home just as soon as we can; your papa and mamma want to see you
badly and they shall not be kept waiting; won’t you come closer?"</p>

<p>"May Peggy come too?" she asked with a smile, though the tears
still wetted her plump cheeks.</p>

<p>"Certainly, for I know Peggy is a good girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is, and we love each other, don’t we, Peggy?"</p>

<p>Grace looked at her companion for reply, and she nodded her head
six or seven times but did not speak. The two advanced and Harvey
took each by the hand.</p>

<p>"How long have you and Peggy known each other?" asked Harvey
of Grace.</p>

<p>"This is the first time the bad folks would let me go to see
her," was the reply.</p>

<p>The youth read the full meaning of these words. The kidnappers
had kept the little one a close prisoner from the first. For the
sake of her health, they probably allowed her to play at times
near the shanty, as she was doing when he first saw her, but as
the time of her captivity, as they viewed it, was shortened to
a few hours, they yielded to her wish to walk the little way through
the woods to her neighbor. She would be within quick reach, and
besides, had promised to come back after a brief absence. What
she might reveal while playing with Peggy Waters could not bring
any risk of her loss to her captors. These facts, which became
known afterward, showed that the flight of Harvey Hamilton’s aeroplane
on its first sweep over the ramshackle structure had not roused
any distrust on the part of the two abductors there, who kept
out of sight while the biplane was near.</p>

<p>The young man was stirred by the sight of the child standing
before him, and chattering in her innocent way. Despite what had
just occurred and the certainty that Professor Morgan had played
havoc with the miscreants, the youth was uneasy. Some of the gang
might have escaped and started upon other mischief. Grace was
too much exposed to their evil intentions.</p>

<p>"Let us go into the house," said Harvey, taking each child by
the hand and walking toward the dumpy woman who still filled the
door of the cabin, staring as if she failed to understand what
had taken place.</p>

<p>"Good morning," saluted Harvey; "if you don’t mind we will go
inside and sit down for a little while."</p>

<p>"I’m sure you’re welcome," replied the housewife, stepping back
to give room. "It seems to me there’s been queer goings on around
here. What made that awful noise I heerd a little while ago?"</p>

<p>"A friend of mine blew up the shanty where several villains were
holding this little girl a prisoner."</p>

<p>"La sakes! You don’t say so; did you ever hear of sich carryings
on?"</p>

<p>She stood with her arms akimbo and stared at her caller, who
had seated himself near the open door, where he could see his
aeroplane and whatever might appear in the clearing. Grace and
Peggy sat farther back, whispering and chuckling together, as
new acquaintances do who have no idea of the fearful meaning of
what is going on around them.</p>

<p>"Where is Uncle Tommy?" asked Harvey of the wife.</p>

<p>"He went to town two hours ago. You know," she added with natural
pride, "that all the folks depends on him to know what kind of
weather we’re going to have, and he’s gone to Chesterton to tell
’em."</p>

<p>"I have heard of his reputation as a weather prophet."</p>

<p>At this juncture, Grace rose abruptly from her chair and asked
Harvey:</p>

<p>"How long have I been here?"</p>

<p>"Not knowing when you came I can’t tell exactly, Grace, but I
am sure it is only a short time."</p>

<p>"I promised Alessandro I wouldn’t stay long and I must be going."</p>

<p>"Wait a little while; he won’t care—."</p>

<p>"There he comes for me now! He will be angry and beat me," she
exclaimed, standing beside her young friend and looking out of
the door in a tremor of alarm.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the miscreant had come into plain sight. He was
walking with bowed head and his hands behind him, as if the wrists
were fastened together, and only one or two paces to the rear
strode Detective Simmons Pendar, with a revolver ready for instant
use. The picture told its own story.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," said Harvey, laying a gentle hand on the
shoulder of Grace Hastings; "Alessandro sha’n’t hurt you."</p>

<p>With this assurance, the youth went down the few steps and advanced
to meet his friend.</p>

<p>"I don’t admire his looks," he remarked with a smile as he glanced
at the swarthy, scowling face.</p>

<p>"He’s as ugly as he looks," replied the detective.</p>

<p>"Is he the only one?"</p>

<p>"Professor Morgan’s bomb sent one flying among the trees, where
he will stay until carried away. And that is Grace Hastings?"
said the officer, with a radiant face, as he looked at the winsome
countenance in the doorway.</p>

<p>"She told me that that is her name, and I think she ought to
know; but what do you mean to do with this fellow?"</p>

<p>"I have been thinking. You know there were three of them; I exchanged
shots with Catozzi when we were starting with your aeroplane.
I am anxious to capture him, but he was left at Chesterton, where
he will probably wait till he receives more news."</p>

<p>"You can march this one ahead of you to the town and have him
locked up."</p>

<p>The face of the detective became grave. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that if I do that, and the truth becomes known,
as it surely will be, the people will lynch him."</p>

<p>"Who cares if they do?" asked Harvey; "it will serve him right."</p>

<p>"He and the others deserve it, but the law should deal with them.
I have a better plan." </p>
