<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The fact that she would be late in keeping her engagement with
William was not the only reason which sent Katharine almost at
racing speed along the Strand in the direction of his rooms. Punctuality
might have been achieved by taking a cab, had she not wished the
open air to fan into flame the glow kindled by Mary’s words. For
among all the impressions of the evening’s talk one was of the
nature of a revelation and subdued the rest to insignificance.
Thus one looked; thus one spoke; such was love.</p>

<p>"She sat up straight and looked at me, and then she said, ‘I’m
in love,’" Katharine mused, trying to set the whole scene in motion.
It was a scene to dwell on with so much wonder that not a grain
of pity occurred to her; it was a flame blazing suddenly in the
dark; by its light Katharine perceived far too vividly for her
comfort the mediocrity, indeed the entirely fictitious character
of her own feelings so far as they pretended to correspond with
Mary’s feelings. She made up her mind to act instantly upon the
knowledge thus gained, and cast her mind in amazement back to
the scene upon the heath, when she had yielded, heaven knows why,
for reasons which seemed now imperceptible. So in broad daylight
one might revisit the place where one has groped and turned and
succumbed to utter bewilderment in a fog.</p>

<p>"It’s all so simple," she said to herself. "There can’t be any
doubt. I’ve only got to speak now. I’ve only got to speak," she
went on saying, in time to her own footsteps, and completely forgot
Mary Datchet.</p>

<p>William Rodney, having come back earlier from the office than
he expected, sat down to pick out the melodies in "The Magic Flute"
upon the piano. Katharine was late, but that was nothing new,
and, as she had no particular liking for music, and he felt in
the mood for it, perhaps it was as well. This defect in Katharine
was the more strange, William reflected, because, as a rule, the
women of her family were unusually musical. Her cousin, Cassandra
Otway, for example, had a very fine taste in music, and he had
charming recollections of her in a light fantastic attitude, playing
the flute in the morning-room at Stogdon House. He recalled with
pleasure the amusing way in which her nose, long like all the
Otway noses, seemed to extend itself into the flute, as if she
were some inimitably graceful species of musical mole. The little
picture suggested very happily her melodious and whimsical temperament.
The enthusiasms of a young girl of distinguished upbringing appealed
to William, and suggested a thousand ways in which, with his training
and accomplishments, he could be of service to her. She ought
to be given the chance of hearing good music, as it is played
by those who have inherited the great tradition. Moreover, from
one or two remarks let fall in the course of conversation, he
thought it possible that she had what Katharine professed to lack,
a passionate, if untaught, appreciation of literature. He had
lent her his play. Meanwhile, as Katharine was certain to be late,
and "The Magic Flute" is nothing without a voice, he felt inclined
to spend the time of waiting in writing a letter to Cassandra,
exhorting her to read Pope in preference to Dostoevsky, until
her feeling for form was more highly developed. He set himself
down to compose this piece of advice in a shape which was light
and playful, and yet did no injury to a cause which he had near
at heart, when he heard Katharine upon the stairs. A moment later
it was plain that he had been mistaken, it was not Katharine;
but he could not settle himself to his letter. His temper had
changed from one of urbane contentment&mdash;indeed of delicious expansion&mdash;to
one of uneasiness and expectation. The dinner was brought in,
and had to be set by the fire to keep hot. It was now a quarter
of an hour beyond the specified time. He bethought him of a piece
of news which had depressed him in the earlier part of the day.
Owing to the illness of one of his fellow-clerks, it was likely
that he would get no holiday until later in the year, which would
mean the postponement of their marriage. But this possibility,
after all, was not so disagreeable as the probability which forced
itself upon him with every tick of the clock that Katharine had
completely forgotten her engagement. Such things had happened
less frequently since Christmas, but what if they were going to
begin to happen again? What if their marriage should turn out,
as she had said, a farce? He acquitted her of any wish to hurt
him wantonly, but there was something in her character which made
it impossible for her to help hurting people. Was she cold? Was
she self-absorbed? He tried to fit her with each of these descriptions,
but he had to own that she puzzled him.</p>

<p>"There are so many things that she doesn’t understand," he reflected,
glancing at the letter to Cassandra which he had begun and laid
aside. What prevented him from finishing the letter which he had
so much enjoyed beginning? The reason was that Katharine might,
at any moment, enter the room. The thought, implying his bondage
to her, irritated him acutely. It occurred to him that he would
leave the letter lying open for her to see, and he would take
the opportunity of telling her that he had sent his play to Cassandra
for her to criticize. Possibly, but not by any means certainly,
this would annoy her&mdash;and as he reached the doubtful comfort of
this conclusion, there was a knock on the door and Katharine came
in. They kissed each other coldly and she made no apology for
being late. Nevertheless, her mere presence moved him strangely;
but he was determined that this should not weaken his resolution
to make some kind of stand against her; to get at the truth about
her. He let her make her own disposition of clothes and busied
himself with the plates.</p>

<p>"I’ve got a piece of news for you, Katharine," he said directly
they sat down to table; "I shan’t get my holiday in April. We
shall have to put off our marriage."</p>

<p>He rapped the words out with a certain degree of briskness. Katharine
started a little, as if the announcement disturbed her thoughts.</p>

<p>"That won’t make any difference, will it? I mean the lease isn’t
signed," she replied. "But why? What has happened?"</p>

<p>He told her, in an off-hand way, how one of his fellow-clerks
had broken down, and might have to be away for months, six months
even, in which case they would have to think over their position.
He said it in a way which struck her, at last, as oddly casual.
She looked at him. There was no outward sign that he was annoyed
with her. Was she well dressed? She thought sufficiently so. Perhaps
she was late? She looked for a clock.</p>

<p>"It’s a good thing we didn’t take the house then," she repeated
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It’ll mean, too, I’m afraid, that I shan’t be as free for a
considerable time as I have been," he continued. She had time
to reflect that she gained something by all this, though it was
too soon to determine what. But the light which had been burning
with such intensity as she came along was suddenly overclouded,
as much by his manner as by his news. She had been prepared to
meet opposition, which is simple to encounter compared with&mdash;she
did not know what it was that she had to encounter. The meal passed
in quiet, well-controlled talk about indifferent things. Music
was not a subject about which she knew anything, but she liked
him to tell her things; and could, she mused, as he talked, fancy
the evenings of married life spent thus, over the fire; spent
thus, or with a book, perhaps, for then she would have time to
read her books, and to grasp firmly with every muscle of her unused
mind what she longed to know. The atmosphere was very free. Suddenly
William broke off. She looked up apprehensively, brushing aside
these thoughts with annoyance.</p>

<p>"Where should I address a letter to Cassandra?" he asked her.
It was obvious again that William had some meaning or other to-night,
or was in some mood. "We’ve struck up a friendship," he added.</p>

<p>"She’s at home, I think," Katharine replied.</p>

<p>"They keep her too much at home," said William. "Why don’t you
ask her to stay with you, and let her hear a little good music?
I’ll just finish what I was saying, if you don’t mind, because
I’m particularly anxious that she should hear to-morrow."</p>

<p>Katharine sank back in her chair, and Rodney took the paper on
his knees, and went on with his sentence. "Style, you know, is
what we tend to neglect&mdash;"; but he was far more conscious of Katharine’s
eye upon him than of what he was saying about style. He knew that
she was looking at him, but whether with irritation or indifference
he could not guess.</p>

<p>In truth, she had fallen sufficiently into his trap to feel uncomfortably
roused and disturbed and unable to proceed on the lines laid down
for herself. This indifferent, if not hostile, attitude on William’s
part made it impossible to break off without animosity, largely
and completely. Infinitely preferable was Mary’s state, she thought,
where there was a simple thing to do and one did it. In fact,
she could not help supposing that some littleness of nature had
a part in all the refinements, reserves, and subtleties of feeling
for which her friends and family were so distinguished. For example,
although she liked Cassandra well enough, her fantastic method
of life struck her as purely frivolous; now it was socialism,
now it was silkworms, now it was music&mdash;which last she supposed
was the cause of William’s sudden interest in her. Never before
had William wasted the minutes of her presence in writing his
letters. With a curious sense of light opening where all, hitherto,
had been opaque, it dawned upon her that, after all, possibly,
yes, probably, nay, certainly, the devotion which she had almost
wearily taken for granted existed in a much slighter degree than
she had suspected, or existed no longer. She looked at him attentively
as if this discovery of hers must show traces in his face. Never
had she seen so much to respect in his appearance, so much that
attracted her by its sensitiveness and intelligence, although
she saw these qualities as if they were those one responds to,
dumbly, in the face of a stranger. The head bent over the paper,
thoughtful as usual, had now a composure which seemed somehow
to place it at a distance, like a face seen talking to some one
else behind glass.</p>

<p>He wrote on, without raising his eyes. She would have spoken,
but could not bring herself to ask him for signs of affection
which she had no right to claim. The conviction that he was thus
strange to her filled her with despondency, and illustrated quite
beyond doubt the infinite loneliness of human beings. She had
never felt the truth of this so strongly before. She looked away
into the fire; it seemed to her that even physically they were
now scarcely within speaking distance; and spiritually there was
certainly no human being with whom she could claim comradeship;
no dream that satisfied her as she was used to be satisfied; nothing
remained in whose reality she could believe, save those abstract
ideas&mdash;figures, laws, stars, facts, which she could hardly hold
to for lack of knowledge and a kind of shame.</p>

<p>When Rodney owned to himself the folly of this prolonged silence,
and the meanness of such devices, and looked up ready to seek
some excuse for a good laugh, or opening for a confession, he
was disconcerted by what he saw. Katharine seemed equally oblivious
of what was bad or of what was good in him. Her expression suggested
concentration upon something entirely remote from her surroundings.
The carelessness of her attitude seemed to him rather masculine
than feminine. His impulse to break up the constraint was chilled,
and once more the exasperating sense of his own impotency returned
to him. He could not help contrasting Katharine with his vision
of the engaging, whimsical Cassandra; Katharine undemonstrative,
inconsiderate, silent, and yet so notable that he could never
do without her good opinion.</p>

<p>She veered round upon him a moment later, as if, when her train
of thought was ended, she became aware of his presence.</p>

<p>"Have you finished your letter?" she asked. He thought he heard
faint amusement in her tone, but not a trace of jealousy.</p>

<p>"No, I’m not going to write any more to-night," he said. "I’m
not in the mood for it for some reason. I can’t say what I want
to say."</p>

<p>"Cassandra won’t know if it’s well written or badly written,"
Katharine remarked.</p>

<p>"I’m not so sure about that. I should say she has a good deal
of literary feeling."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Katharine indifferently. "You’ve been neglecting
my education lately, by the way. I wish you’d read something.
Let me choose a book." So speaking, she went across to his bookshelves
and began looking in a desultory way among his books. Anything,
she thought, was better than bickering or the strange silence
which drove home to her the distance between them. As she pulled
one book forward and then another she thought ironically of her
own certainty not an hour ago; how it had vanished in a moment,
how she was merely marking time as best she could, not knowing
in the least where they stood, what they felt, or whether William
loved her or not. More and more the condition of Mary’s mind seemed
to her wonderful and enviable&mdash;if, indeed, it could be quite as
she figured it&mdash;if, indeed, simplicity existed for any one of
the daughters of women.</p>

<p>"Swift," she said, at last, taking out a volume at haphazard
to settle this question at least. "Let us have some Swift."</p>

<p>Rodney took the book, held it in front of him, inserted one finger
between the pages, but said nothing. His face wore a queer expression
of deliberation, as if he were weighing one thing with another,
and would not say anything until his mind were made up.</p>

<p>Katharine, taking her chair beside him, noted his silence and
looked at him with sudden apprehension. What she hoped or feared,
she could not have said; a most irrational and indefensible desire
for some assurance of his affection was, perhaps, uppermost in
her mind. Peevishness, complaints, exacting cross-examination
she was used to, but this attitude of composed quiet, which seemed
to come from the consciousness of power within, puzzled her. She
did not know what was going to happen next.</p>

<p>At last William spoke.</p>

<p>"I think it’s a little odd, don’t you?" he said, in a voice of
detached reflection. "Most people, I mean, would be seriously
upset if their marriage was put off for six months or so. But
we aren’t; now how do you account for that?"</p>

<p>She looked at him and observed his judicial attitude as of one
holding far aloof from emotion.</p>

<p>"I attribute it," he went on, without waiting for her to answer,
"to the fact that neither of us is in the least romantic about
the other. That may be partly, no doubt, because we’ve known each
other so long; but I’m inclined to think there’s more in it than
that. There’s something temperamental. I think you’re a trifle
cold, and I suspect I’m a trifle self-absorbed. If that were so
it goes a long way to explaining our odd lack of illusion about
each other. I’m not saying that the most satisfactory marriages
aren’t founded upon this sort of understanding. But certainly
it struck me as odd this morning, when Wilson told me, how little
upset I felt. By the way, you’re sure we haven’t committed ourselves
to that house?"</p>

<p>"I’ve kept the letters, and I’ll go through them to-morrow; but
I’m certain we’re on the safe side."</p>

<p>"Thanks. As to the psychological problem," he continued, as if
the question interested him in a detached way, "there’s no doubt,
I think, that either of us is capable of feeling what, for reasons
of simplicity, I call romance for a third person&mdash;at least, I’ve
little doubt in my own case."</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, the first time in all her knowledge of him that
Katharine had known William enter thus deliberately and without
sign of emotion upon a statement of his own feelings. He was wont
to discourage such intimate discussions by a little laugh or turn
of the conversation, as much as to say that men, or men of the
world, find such topics a little silly, or in doubtful taste.
His obvious wish to explain something puzzled her, interested
her, and neutralized the wound to her vanity. For some reason,
too, she felt more at ease with him than usual; or her ease was
more the ease of equality&mdash;she could not stop to think of that
at the moment though. His remarks interested her too much for
the light that they threw upon certain problems of her own.</p>

<p>"What is this romance?" she mused.</p>

<p>"Ah, that’s the question. I’ve never come across a definition
that satisfied me, though there are some very good ones"&mdash;he glanced
in the direction of his books.</p>

<p>"It’s not altogether knowing the other person, perhaps&mdash;it’s
ignorance,"  she hazarded.</p>

<p>"Some authorities say it’s a question of distance&mdash;romance in
literature, that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Possibly, in the case of art. But in the case of people it may
be&mdash;"  she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Have you no personal experience of it?" he asked, letting his
eyes rest upon her swiftly for a moment.</p>

<p>"I believe it’s influenced me enormously," she said, in the tone
of one absorbed by the possibilities of some view just presented
to them; "but in my life there’s so little scope for it," she
added. She reviewed her daily task, the perpetual demands upon
her for good sense, self-control, and accuracy in a house containing
a romantic mother. Ah, but her romance wasn’t <em>THAT </em>romance.
It was a desire, an echo, a sound; she could drape it in color,
see it in form, hear it in music, but not in words; no, never
in words. She sighed, teased by desires so incoherent, so incommunicable.</p>

<p>"But isn’t it curious," William resumed, "that you should neither
feel it for me, nor I for you?"</p>

<p>Katharine agreed that it was curious&mdash;very; but even more curious
to her was the fact that she was discussing the question with
William. It revealed possibilities which opened a prospect of
a new relationship altogether. Somehow it seemed to her that he
was helping her to understand what she had never understood; and
in her gratitude she was conscious of a most sisterly desire to
help him, too&mdash;sisterly, save for one pang, not quite to be subdued,
that for him she was without romance.</p>

<p>"I think you might be very happy with some one you loved in that
way,"  she said.</p>

<p>"You assume that romance survives a closer knowledge of the person
one loves?"</p>

<p>He asked the question formally, to protect himself from the sort
of personality which he dreaded. The whole situation needed the
most careful management lest it should degenerate into some degrading
and disturbing exhibition such as the scene, which he could never
think of without shame, upon the heath among the dead leaves.
And yet each sentence brought him relief. He was coming to understand
something or other about his own desires hitherto undefined by
him, the source of his difficulty with Katharine. The wish to
hurt her, which had urged him to begin, had completely left him,
and he felt that it was only Katharine now who could help him
to be sure. He must take his time. There were so many things that
he could not say without the greatest difficulty&mdash;that name, for
example, Cassandra. Nor could he move his eyes from a certain
spot, a fiery glen surrounded by high mountains, in the heart
of the coals. He waited in suspense for Katharine to continue.
She had said that he might be very happy with some one he loved
in that way.</p>

<p>"I don’t see why it shouldn’t last with you," she resumed. "I
can imagine a certain sort of person&mdash;" she paused; she was aware
that he was listening with the greatest intentness, and that his
formality was merely the cover for an extreme anxiety of some
sort. There was some person then&mdash;some woman&mdash;who could it be?
Cassandra? Ah, possibly&mdash;</p>

<p>"A person," she added, speaking in the most matter-of-fact tone
she could command, "like Cassandra Otway, for instance. Cassandra
is the most interesting of the Otways&mdash;with the exception of Henry.
Even so, I like Cassandra better. She has more than mere cleverness.
She is a character&mdash;a person by herself."</p>

<p>"Those dreadful insects!" burst from William, with a nervous
laugh, and a little spasm went through him as Katharine noticed.
It <em>WAS </em>Cassandra then. Automatically and dully she replied,
"You could insist that she confined herself to&mdash;to&mdash;something
else.... But she cares for music; I believe she writes poetry;
and there can be no doubt that she has a peculiar charm&mdash;"</p>

<p>She ceased, as if defining to herself this peculiar charm. After
a moment’s silence William jerked out:</p>

<p>"I thought her affectionate?"</p>

<p>"Extremely affectionate. She worships Henry. When you think what
a house that is &mdash;Uncle Francis always in one mood or another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, dear," William muttered.</p>

<p>"And you have so much in common."</p>

<p>"My dear Katharine!" William exclaimed, flinging himself back
in his chair, and uprooting his eyes from the spot in the fire.
"I really don’t know what we’re talking about.... I assure you...."</p>

<p>He was covered with an extreme confusion.</p>

<p>He withdrew the finger that was still thrust between the pages
of Gulliver, opened the book, and ran his eye down the list of
chapters, as though he were about to select the one most suitable
for reading aloud. As Katharine watched him, she was seized with
preliminary symptoms of his own panic. At the same time she was
convinced that, should he find the right page, take out his spectacles,
clear his throat, and open his lips, a chance that would never
come again in all their lives would be lost to them both.</p>

<p>"We’re talking about things that interest us both very much,"
she said. "Shan’t we go on talking, and leave Swift for another
time? I don’t feel in the mood for Swift, and it’s a pity to read
any one when that’s the case&mdash;particularly Swift."</p>

<p>The presence of wise literary speculation, as she calculated,
restored William’s confidence in his security, and he replaced
the book in the bookcase, keeping his back turned to her as he
did so, and taking advantage of this circumstance to summon his
thoughts together.</p>

<p>But a second of introspection had the alarming result of showing
him that his mind, when looked at from within, was no longer familiar
ground. He felt, that is to say, what he had never consciously
felt before; he was revealed to himself as other than he was wont
to think him; he was afloat upon a sea of unknown and tumultuous
possibilities. He paced once up and down the room, and then flung
himself impetuously into the chair by Katharine’s side. He had
never felt anything like this before; he put himself entirely
into her hands; he cast off all responsibility. He very nearly
exclaimed aloud:</p>

<p>"You’ve stirred up all these odious and violent emotions, and
now you must do the best you can with them."</p>

<p>Her near presence, however, had a calming and reassuring effect
upon his agitation, and he was conscious only of an implicit trust
that, somehow, he was safe with her, that she would see him through,
find out what it was that he wanted, and procure it for him.</p>

<p>"I wish to do whatever you tell me to do," he said. "I put myself
entirely in your hands, Katharine."</p>

<p>"You must try to tell me what you feel," she said.</p>

<p>"My dear, I feel a thousand things every second. I don’t know,
I’m sure, what I feel. That afternoon on the heath&mdash;it was then&mdash;then&mdash;"
He broke off; he did not tell her what had happened then. "Your
ghastly good sense, as usual, has convinced me&mdash;for the moment&mdash;but
what the truth is, Heaven only knows!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Isn’t it the truth that you are, or might be, in love with Cassandra?" 
she said gently.</p>

<p>William bowed his head. After a moment’s silence he murmured:</p>

<p>"I believe you’re right, Katharine."</p>

<p>She sighed, involuntarily. She had been hoping all this time,
with an intensity that increased second by second against the
current of her words, that it would not in the end come to this.
After a moment of surprising anguish, she summoned her courage
to tell him how she wished only that she might help him, and had
framed the first words of her speech when a knock, terrific and
startling to people in their overwrought condition, sounded upon
the door.</p>

<p>"Katharine, I worship you," he urged, half in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, withdrawing with a little shiver, "but you
must open the door."</p>
