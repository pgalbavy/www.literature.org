The Ruler of the Southern Ocean was Sh没 (Heedless), the Ruler of<br/>
the Northern Ocean was H没 (Sudden), and the Ruler of the Centre<br/>
was Chaos. Sh没 and H没 were continually meeting in the land of<br/>
Chaos, who treated them very well. They consulted together how<br/>
they might repay his kindness, and said, "Men all have seven<br/>
orifices for the purpose of seeing, hearing, eating, and<br/>
breathing, while this poor Ruler alone has not one. Let us try<br/>
and make them for him." Accordingly they dug one orifice in him<br/>
every day; and at the end of seven days Chaos died.&mdash;[<em>Chuang<br/>
Tze</em>, Legge's translation.]</p>
