<p>The weather was mild, for the short, oppressive Northwest summer
was rapidly approaching. During the middle of the day the sun
was hot, and the boys perspired freely. By and by would come the
billions of mosquitoes to render life unbearable. Those pests
often kill bears and wolves by blinding them, and the man who
does not wear some protection is driven frantic, unable to eat,
sleep, or live, except in smothering smoke. Jeff had said that
he meant to complete the work, if possible, and start down the
Yukon before that time of torment arrived.</p>

<p>For two days the boys wrought incessantly. They had learned how
to wash and purify the gold in the crude way taught them by the
old miner, and the rich reward for their labor continued. Jeff
had brought back on his previous visit to Dawson City an abundant
supply of strong canvas bags, in which the gold was placed, with
the tops securely tied. These were regularly deposited in the
cavern where the party made their home, until a row of them lined
one side of the place. It was a striking proof of the wonderful
richness of their find, that one of these bags was filled wholly
with nuggets, which must have been worth fifteen or twenty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>Early on the afternoon of the third day another thought struck
Frank Mansley, and he ceased shovelling gravel into the rocker
for his companion.</p>

<p>"What is it now?" asked Roswell with a smile.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember that on the first day we arrived here, while
we were prospecting up the little stream, we saw that friend of
Ike Hardman?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"Well, we never told Jeff about it."</p>

<p>"I declare!" exclaimed Roswell. "How came we to forget it?"</p>

<p>"This gold drove it out of our minds. I never thought of it until
this minute. I tell you, Roswell, I believe something has gone
wrong."</p>

<p>And Frank sat down, removed his cap, and wiped his moist forehead
with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"What could have gone wrong?" asked the other lad, who, despite
his jauntiness, shared in a degree the anxiety of his friend.</p>

<p>"All the gold we have gathered is in the cavern. I believe Hardman
and those fellows are in the neighborhood and mean to steal it."</p>

<p>"It's a pity we didn't think of this before," said Roswell, laying
down his shovel. "Let's go back to the cavern and keep watch till
Jeff comes back."</p>

<p>Inspired by their new dread, they hastily gathered up what gold
had been washed out, stowed it into another canvas bag, and then
Frank slung it half filled over his shoulder and started for the
cavern, something more than an eighth of a mile away.</p>

<p>They walked fast and in silence, for the thought in the mind
of both was the same. From the first the most imprudent carelessness
had been shown, and they could not understand how Jeff ever allowed
the valuable store to remain unguarded. It is true, as has already
been stated, that the section, despite the rush of lawless characters
that have flocked thither, is one of the best governed in the
world, and no officers could be more watchful and effective than
the mounted police of the Northwest; but the course of our friends
had much the appearance of a man leaving his pocketbook in the
middle of the street and expecting to find it again the next day.</p>

<p>A bitter reflection of the boys was that this never would have
been the case had they told Jeff of the presence of the suspicious
individual in the neighborhood. If anything went amiss, they felt
that the blame must rest with them If matters were found right,
they would not leave the cavern until one or both of their friends
returned.</p>

<p>When half the distance was passed, Roswell, who was in the load,
broke into a lope, with Frank instantly doing the same. A minute
later they had to slacken their pace because of the need to climb
some bowlders and make their way through an avenue between massive
rocks, but the instant it was possible they were trotting again.</p>

<p>It had been the custom for the gold-seekers to take a lunch with
them to the diggings. This saved time, and their real meal was
eaten in the evening after their return home.</p>

<p>The moment Roswell caught sight of the round, irregular opening
which served as the door of their dwelling, he anxiously scanned
it and the pile of wood and embers on the outside, where the fire
was kindled for cooking purposes. The fact that he saw nothing
amiss gave him hope, but did not remove the singular distrust
that had brought both in such haste from the diggings.</p>

<p>He ran faster, while Frank, discommoded by the heavy, bouncing
bag over his shoulder, stumbled, and his hat fell off. With an
impatient exclamation he caught it up, recovered himself, and
was off again.</p>

<p>As he looked ahead he saw Roswell duck his head and plunge through
the opening.</p>

<p>"Is everything right?" shouted Frank, whose dread intensified
with each passing second.</p>

<p>Before he could reach the door out came his cousin, as if fired
by a catapult. His eyes were staring and his face as white as
death.</p>

<p>"Right!" he gasped; "we have been robbed! All the gold is gone!"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "WE <em>HAVE BEEN ROBBED! ALL THE GOLD IS GONE</em>."]</p>

<p>And overcome by the shock the poor fellow collapsed and sank
to the ground as weak as a kitten. Frank let the bag fall and
straightened up.</p>

<p>"No; it cannot be," he said in a husky voice.</p>

<p>"Look for yourself," replied Roswell, swallowing a lump in his
throat and turning his eyes pitifully toward his comrade.</p>

<p>A strange fear held Frank motionless for several seconds. Despite
the startling declaration of his cousin, a faint hope thrilled
him that he was mistaken, and yet he dared not peer into the interior
through dread of finding he was not.</p>

<p>Reflecting, however, upon the childish part he was playing, he
pulled himself together, and with the deliberation of Jeff Graham
himself bent his head and passed through the door.</p>

<p>Enough sunlight penetrated the cavern to reveal the whole interior
in the faint illumination. When they left that morning the row
of canvas bags was neatly arranged along the farther wall, where
they stood like so many corpulent little brownies.</p>

<p>Every one had vanished.</p>

<p>Frank Mansley stared for a moment in silence. Then he stepped
forward and called in a strong, firm voice:</p>

<p>"Come, Roswell, quick!"</p>

<p>The other roused himself and hastily advanced.</p>

<p>"Take your revolver," said Frank, as he shoved his own into his
hip-pocket, and begun strapping Jeff's cartridge belt around his
waist. As Roswell obeyed, his cousin took the Winchester from
where it leaned in one corner.</p>

<p>"Now for those thieves, and we don't come back till we find them."</p>
