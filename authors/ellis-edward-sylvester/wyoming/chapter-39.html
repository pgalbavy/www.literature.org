<p>Aunt Peggy Carey "builded better than she knew."</p>

<p>In her fierce attack on the Tory she administered well-merited
punishment, leaving him in a demoralized condition, so thoroughly
whipped, indeed, that for several minutes he was dazed and not
himself.</p>

<p>Her friends trembled to think of the vengeance he would visit
upon her for the act, but the good lady herself seemed to have
no apprehensions, and, turning about, she carefully arranged her
hair and bonnet, and resumed cooking slices from the carcass of
the pig, intending now to wait upon the Senecas, who had been
kind enough not to interfere while she attended to the other important
duty.</p>

<p>What the next step would have been was hard to guess, but for
the sudden discovery which we have made known.</p>

<p>One of the captives was found to be missing, and he was the most
important of all, being no less a personage than Lieutenant Fred
Godfrey.</p>

<p>The instant Aunt Peggy assailed Golcher the youth saw that the
opportunity for which he was waiting had come, and he took advantage
of it.</p>

<p>The uproar for the moment was great. The captives on the log
sprang to their feet, and the Senecas fixed their attention on
the couple, seeing which, Mr. Brainerd said to his son:</p>

<p>"<em>Now's your time, Fred!</em>"</p>

<p>He turned as he spoke, and saw the lieutenant vanishing like
a shot in the gloom. When the warriors noted his absence, he was
at a safe distance in the wood.</p>

<p>Fully a half-dozen Senecas sprang off in the darkness, using
every effort to recapture the prisoner, who could be at no great
distance, no matter how fast he had traveled.</p>

<p>Had Fred given away to the excitement of the occasion, and lost
that coolness that had stood him so well more than once on that
dreadful afternoon and evening, he hardly would have escaped recapture
before he went a hundred yards; for the Iroquois were so accustomed
to the ways of the woods, they would have seized such advantage
and come upon him while he was in the immediate neighborhood.</p>

<p>They believed he would continue running and stumbling in the
darkness, and thus betray his whereabouts.</p>

<p>And that is precisely what Fred Godfrey did not do.</p>

<p>He ran with all speed through the woods, tripping and picking
himself up, and struggling forward, until he was far beyond the
reach of the light of the camp-fire, when all at once he caught
the signal whoops of the Indians, and he knew they were after
him.</p>

<p>Then, instead of keeping on in his flight, he straightened up
and stepped along with extreme caution, literally feeling every
foot of the way.</p>

<p>Thus it was he avoided betraying his situation to the cunning
warriors, who, in their apparently aimless pursuit, used their
ears, and indeed every sense at their command.</p>

<p>It was because Fred himself did the same that he eluded those
on his track. Listening, he heard the approach of one of the Iroquois.
Instead of hurrying away he stopped, and backing against a tree,
stood as motionless as the trunk itself.</p>

<p>The dense summer vegetation overhead prevented a single beam
of moonlight reaching him, so that he was secure from observation,
so long as he retained his self-possession and made no blunder.</p>

<p>His nerves were under a fearful strain within the next three
minutes, for, as if guided by fate, not one but two of the Senecas
dashed through the wood, and instead of going by, halted not more
than six feet from where he stood.</p>

<p>Why they should have stopped thus was more than he could conjecture,
unless they really knew where he was and were sure they could
place their hands on him when they wished.</p>

<p>It was hard to understand how this could be, and Fred refused
to believe it, though the actions of the Indians were certainly
remarkable.</p>

<p>What more trying situation could there be? It was like some nightmare
in which the victim sees the foe swiftly approaching and is without
the power to move so much as a finger.</p>

<p>But Fred did not lose heart. If they had learned where he was,
he meant to use his feet and not to yield so long as he could
resist.</p>

<p>He tugged at his bonds, but they were fastened so securely that
he could not start them. To loosen them so as to free his hands
must necessarily be the work of some time, and he knew how it
could be done, when he should be free of his enemies.</p>

<p>But the bonds, when two of the Senecas were at his elbow, were
torture, and but for his strength of will he could not have avoided
an outcry.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the suspense lasted but a few minutes. The Indians
stood silent as if listening, and during that ordeal Fred scarcely
drew his breath.</p>

<p>Then they exchanged some words in the gruff, exclamatory style
peculiar to the red men, and again they paused and listened.</p>

<p>The other pursuers could be heard at different points, for most
of them uttered several cautions but well-understood signals,
some of which were answered by the two at Fred's elbow.</p>

<p>"Why should they stop here," thought he, "when they have every
reason to think I am threshing through the wood and getting farther
away each minute?"</p>

<p>Just then they began moving off, and immediately after, he caught
the dim outlines of their figures as they crossed an open space
and vanished in the woods beyond.</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey did not stir for several minutes, but at the end
of that time he became satisfied that his whereabouts were unknown
to the Senecas ranging through the wilderness in search of him,
and he ventured to leave the tree.</p>
