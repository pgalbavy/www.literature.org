<p>ON THE FIRST OR second day of August I got a horse and cart and set out
for the high country, to visit the Widow Steavens. The wheat harvest was
over, and here and there along the horizon I could see black puffs of
smoke from the steam threshing-machines. The old pasture land was now
being broken up into wheatfields and cornfields, the red grass was
disappearing, and the whole face of the country was changing. There
were wooden houses where the old sod dwellings used to be, and little
orchards, and big red barns; all this meant happy children, contented
women, and men who saw their lives coming to a fortunate issue. The
windy springs and the blazing summers, one after another, had enriched
and mellowed that flat tableland; all the human effort that had gone
into it was coming back in long, sweeping lines of fertility. The
changes seemed beautiful and harmonious to me; it was like watching the
growth of a great man or of a great idea. I recognized every tree and
sandbank and rugged draw. I found that I remembered the conformation of
the land as one remembers the modelling of human faces.
</p><p>When I drew up to our old windmill, the Widow Steavens came out to meet
me. She was brown as an Indian woman, tall, and very strong. When I was
little, her massive head had always seemed to me like a Roman senator’s.
I told her at once why I had come.
</p><p>‘You’ll stay the night with us, Jimmy? I’ll talk to you after supper. I
can take more interest when my work is off my mind. You’ve no prejudice
against hot biscuit for supper? Some have, these days.’
</p><p>While I was putting my horse away, I heard a rooster squawking. I looked
at my watch and sighed; it was three o’clock, and I knew that I must eat
him at six.
</p><p>After supper Mrs. Steavens and I went upstairs to the old sitting-room,
while her grave, silent brother remained in the basement to read his
farm papers. All the windows were open. The white summer moon was
shining outside, the windmill was pumping lazily in the light breeze. My
hostess put the lamp on a stand in the corner, and turned it low because
of the heat. She sat down in her favourite rocking-chair and settled
a little stool comfortably under her tired feet. ‘I’m troubled with
calluses, Jim; getting old,’ she sighed cheerfully. She crossed her
hands in her lap and sat as if she were at a meeting of some kind.
</p><p>‘Now, it’s about that dear Antonia you want to know? Well, you’ve come
to the right person. I’ve watched her like she’d been my own daughter.
</p><p>‘When she came home to do her sewing that summer before she was to
be married, she was over here about every day. They’ve never had a
sewing-machine at the Shimerdas’, and she made all her things here. I
taught her hemstitching, and I helped her to cut and fit. She used
to sit there at that machine by the window, pedalling the life out of
it--she was so strong--and always singing them queer Bohemian songs,
like she was the happiest thing in the world.
</p><p>‘“Antonia,” I used to say, “don’t run that machine so fast. You won’t
hasten the day none that way.”
</p><p>‘Then she’d laugh and slow down for a little, but she’d soon forget and
begin to pedal and sing again. I never saw a girl work harder to go to
housekeeping right and well-prepared. Lovely table-linen the Harlings
had given her, and Lena Lingard had sent her nice things from Lincoln.
We hemstitched all the tablecloths and pillow-cases, and some of
the sheets. Old Mrs. Shimerda knit yards and yards of lace for her
underclothes. Tony told me just how she meant to have everything in her
house. She’d even bought silver spoons and forks, and kept them in her
trunk. She was always coaxing brother to go to the post-office. Her
young man did write her real often, from the different towns along his
run.
</p><p>‘The first thing that troubled her was when he wrote that his run had
been changed, and they would likely have to live in Denver. “I’m a
country girl,” she said, “and I doubt if I’ll be able to manage so well
for him in a city. I was counting on keeping chickens, and maybe a cow.”
 She soon cheered up, though.
</p><p>‘At last she got the letter telling her when to come. She was shaken by
it; she broke the seal and read it in this room. I suspected then that
she’d begun to get faint-hearted, waiting; though she’d never let me see
it.
</p><p>‘Then there was a great time of packing. It was in March, if I remember
rightly, and a terrible muddy, raw spell, with the roads bad for hauling
her things to town. And here let me say, Ambrosch did the right thing.
He went to Black Hawk and bought her a set of plated silver in a purple
velvet box, good enough for her station. He gave her three hundred
dollars in money; I saw the cheque. He’d collected her wages all those
first years she worked out, and it was but right. I shook him by the
hand in this room. “You’re behaving like a man, Ambrosch,” I said, “and
I’m glad to see it, son.”
</p><p>‘’Twas a cold, raw day he drove her and her three trunks into Black Hawk
to take the night train for Denver--the boxes had been shipped before.
He stopped the wagon here, and she ran in to tell me good-bye. She threw
her arms around me and kissed me, and thanked me for all I’d done for
her. She was so happy she was crying and laughing at the same time, and
her red cheeks was all wet with rain.
</p><p>‘“You’re surely handsome enough for any man,” I said, looking her over.
</p><p>‘She laughed kind of flighty like, and whispered, “Good-bye, dear
house!” and then ran out to the wagon. I expect she meant that for you
and your grandmother, as much as for me, so I’m particular to tell you.
This house had always been a refuge to her.
</p><p>‘Well, in a few days we had a letter saying she got to Denver safe, and
he was there to meet her. They were to be married in a few days. He was
trying to get his promotion before he married, she said. I didn’t like
that, but I said nothing. The next week Yulka got a postal card, saying
she was “well and happy.” After that we heard nothing. A month went by,
and old Mrs. Shimerda began to get fretful. Ambrosch was as sulky with
me as if I’d picked out the man and arranged the match.
</p><p>‘One night brother William came in and said that on his way back from
the fields he had passed a livery team from town, driving fast out the
west road. There was a trunk on the front seat with the driver, and
another behind. In the back seat there was a woman all bundled up;
but for all her veils, he thought ‘twas Antonia Shimerda, or Antonia
Donovan, as her name ought now to be.
</p><p>‘The next morning I got brother to drive me over. I can walk still, but
my feet ain’t what they used to be, and I try to save myself. The lines
outside the Shimerdas’ house was full of washing, though it was the
middle of the week. As we got nearer, I saw a sight that made my
heart sink--all those underclothes we’d put so much work on, out there
swinging in the wind. Yulka came bringing a dishpanful of wrung clothes,
but she darted back into the house like she was loath to see us. When
I went in, Antonia was standing over the tubs, just finishing up a big
washing. Mrs. Shimerda was going about her work, talking and scolding
to herself. She didn’t so much as raise her eyes. Tony wiped her hand on
her apron and held it out to me, looking at me steady but mournful. When
I took her in my arms she drew away. “Don’t, Mrs. Steavens,” she says,
“you’ll make me cry, and I don’t want to.”
</p><p>‘I whispered and asked her to come out-of-doors with me. I knew she
couldn’t talk free before her mother. She went out with me, bareheaded,
and we walked up toward the garden.
</p><p>‘“I’m not married, Mrs. Steavens,” she says to me very quiet and
natural-like, “and I ought to be.”
</p><p>‘“Oh, my child,” says I, “what’s happened to you? Don’t be afraid to
tell me!”
</p><p>‘She sat down on the drawside, out of sight of the house. “He’s run away
from me,” she said. “I don’t know if he ever meant to marry me.”
</p><p>‘“You mean he’s thrown up his job and quit the country?” says I.
</p><p>‘“He didn’t have any job. He’d been fired; blacklisted for knocking down
fares. I didn’t know. I thought he hadn’t been treated right. He was
sick when I got there. He’d just come out of the hospital. He lived with
me till my money gave out, and afterward I found he hadn’t really been
hunting work at all. Then he just didn’t come back. One nice fellow at
the station told me, when I kept going to look for him, to give it up.
He said he was afraid Larry’d gone bad and wouldn’t come back any more.
I guess he’s gone to Old Mexico. The conductors get rich down there,
collecting half-fares off the natives and robbing the company. He was
always talking about fellows who had got ahead that way.”
</p><p>‘I asked her, of course, why she didn’t insist on a civil marriage at
once--that would have given her some hold on him. She leaned her head
on her hands, poor child, and said, “I just don’t know, Mrs. Steavens. I
guess my patience was wore out, waiting so long. I thought if he saw how
well I could do for him, he’d want to stay with me.”
</p><p>‘Jimmy, I sat right down on that bank beside her and made lament.
I cried like a young thing. I couldn’t help it. I was just about
heart-broke. It was one of them lovely warm May days, and the wind was
blowing and the colts jumping around in the pastures; but I felt bowed
with despair. My Antonia, that had so much good in her, had come home
disgraced. And that Lena Lingard, that was always a bad one, say what
you will, had turned out so well, and was coming home here every summer
in her silks and her satins, and doing so much for her mother. I give
credit where credit is due, but you know well enough, Jim Burden, there
is a great difference in the principles of those two girls. And here it
was the good one that had come to grief! I was poor comfort to her. I
marvelled at her calm. As we went back to the house, she stopped to feel
of her clothes to see if they was drying well, and seemed to take pride
in their whiteness--she said she’d been living in a brick block, where
she didn’t have proper conveniences to wash them.
</p><p>‘The next time I saw Antonia, she was out in the fields ploughing corn.
All that spring and summer she did the work of a man on the farm; it
seemed to be an understood thing. Ambrosch didn’t get any other hand
to help him. Poor Marek had got violent and been sent away to an
institution a good while back. We never even saw any of Tony’s pretty
dresses. She didn’t take them out of her trunks. She was quiet and
steady. Folks respected her industry and tried to treat her as if
nothing had happened. They talked, to be sure; but not like they would
if she’d put on airs. She was so crushed and quiet that nobody seemed to
want to humble her. She never went anywhere. All that summer she never
once came to see me. At first I was hurt, but I got to feel that it was
because this house reminded her of too much. I went over there when I
could, but the times when she was in from the fields were the times when
I was busiest here. She talked about the grain and the weather as if
she’d never had another interest, and if I went over at night she always
looked dead weary. She was afflicted with toothache; one tooth after
another ulcerated, and she went about with her face swollen half the
time. She wouldn’t go to Black Hawk to a dentist for fear of meeting
people she knew. Ambrosch had got over his good spell long ago, and was
always surly. Once I told him he ought not to let Antonia work so hard
and pull herself down. He said, “If you put that in her head, you better
stay home.” And after that I did.
</p><p>‘Antonia worked on through harvest and threshing, though she was too
modest to go out threshing for the neighbours, like when she was young
and free. I didn’t see much of her until late that fall when she begun
to herd Ambrosch’s cattle in the open ground north of here, up toward
the big dog-town. Sometimes she used to bring them over the west hill,
there, and I would run to meet her and walk north a piece with her. She
had thirty cattle in her bunch; it had been dry, and the pasture was
short, or she wouldn’t have brought them so far.
</p><p>‘It was a fine open fall, and she liked to be alone. While the steers
grazed, she used to sit on them grassy banks along the draws and sun
herself for hours. Sometimes I slipped up to visit with her, when she
hadn’t gone too far.
</p><p>‘“It does seem like I ought to make lace, or knit like Lena used to,”
 she said one day, “but if I start to work, I look around and forget
to go on. It seems such a little while ago when Jim Burden and I was
playing all over this country. Up here I can pick out the very places
where my father used to stand. Sometimes I feel like I’m not going to
live very long, so I’m just enjoying every day of this fall.”
</p><p>‘After the winter begun she wore a man’s long overcoat and boots, and a
man’s felt hat with a wide brim. I used to watch her coming and
going, and I could see that her steps were getting heavier. One day in
December, the snow began to fall. Late in the afternoon I saw Antonia
driving her cattle homeward across the hill. The snow was flying round
her and she bent to face it, looking more lonesome-like to me than
usual. “Deary me,” I says to myself, “the girl’s stayed out too late.
It’ll be dark before she gets them cattle put into the corral.” I seemed
to sense she’d been feeling too miserable to get up and drive them.
</p><p>‘That very night, it happened. She got her cattle home, turned them into
the corral, and went into the house, into her room behind the kitchen,
and shut the door. There, without calling to anybody, without a groan,
she lay down on the bed and bore her child.
</p><p>‘I was lifting supper when old Mrs. Shimerda came running down the
basement stairs, out of breath and screeching:
</p><p>‘“Baby come, baby come!” she says. “Ambrosch much like devil!”
</p><p>‘Brother William is surely a patient man. He was just ready to sit down
to a hot supper after a long day in the fields. Without a word he rose
and went down to the barn and hooked up his team. He got us over there
as quick as it was humanly possible. I went right in, and began to do
for Antonia; but she laid there with her eyes shut and took no account
of me. The old woman got a tubful of warm water to wash the baby. I
overlooked what she was doing and I said out loud: “Mrs. Shimerda,
don’t you put that strong yellow soap near that baby. You’ll blister its
little skin.” I was indignant.
</p><p>‘“Mrs. Steavens,” Antonia said from the bed, “if you’ll look in the top
tray of my trunk, you’ll see some fine soap.” That was the first word
she spoke.
</p><p>‘After I’d dressed the baby, I took it out to show it to Ambrosch. He
was muttering behind the stove and wouldn’t look at it.
</p><p>‘“You’d better put it out in the rain-barrel,” he says.
</p><p>‘“Now, see here, Ambrosch,” says I, “there’s a law in this land, don’t
forget that. I stand here a witness that this baby has come into the
world sound and strong, and I intend to keep an eye on what befalls it.”
 I pride myself I cowed him.
</p><p>‘Well I expect you’re not much interested in babies, but Antonia’s got
on fine. She loved it from the first as dearly as if she’d had a ring
on her finger, and was never ashamed of it. It’s a year and eight
months old now, and no baby was ever better cared-for. Antonia is a
natural-born mother. I wish she could marry and raise a family, but I
don’t know as there’s much chance now.’
</p>
<p>I slept that night in the room I used to have when I was a little boy,
with the summer wind blowing in at the windows, bringing the smell of
the ripe fields. I lay awake and watched the moonlight shining over the
barn and the stacks and the pond, and the windmill making its old dark
shadow against the blue sky.
