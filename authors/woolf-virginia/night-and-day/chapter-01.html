<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was a Sunday evening in October, and in common with many other
young ladies of her class, Katharine Hilbery was pouring out tea.
Perhaps a fifth part of her mind was thus occupied, and the remaining
parts leapt over the little barrier of day which interposed between
Monday morning and this rather subdued moment, and played with
the things one does voluntarily and normally in the daylight.
But although she was silent, she was evidently mistress of a situation
which was familiar enough to her, and inclined to let it take
its way for the six hundredth time, perhaps, without bringing
into play any of her unoccupied faculties. A single glance was
enough to show that Mrs. Hilbery was so rich in the gifts which
make tea-parties of elderly distinguished people successful, that
she scarcely needed any help from her daughter, provided that
the tiresome business of teacups and bread and butter was discharged
for her.</p>

<p>Considering that the little party had been seated round the tea-table
for less than twenty minutes, the animation observable on their
faces, and the amount of sound they were producing collectively,
were very creditable to the hostess. It suddenly came into Katharine’s
mind that if some one opened the door at this moment he would
think that they were enjoying themselves; he would think, "What
an extremely nice house to come into!" and instinctively she laughed,
and said something to increase the noise, for the credit of the
house presumably, since she herself had not been feeling exhilarated.
At the very same moment, rather to her amusement, the door was
flung open, and a young man entered the room. Katharine, as she
shook hands with him, asked him, in her own mind, "Now, do you
think we’re enjoying ourselves enormously?"... "Mr. Denham, mother,"
she said aloud, for she saw that her mother had forgotten his
name.</p>

<p>That fact was perceptible to Mr. Denham also, and increased the
awkwardness which inevitably attends the entrance of a stranger
into a room full of people much at their ease, and all launched
upon sentences. At the same time, it seemed to Mr. Denham as if
a thousand softly padded doors had closed between him and the
street outside. A fine mist, the etherealized essence of the fog,
hung visibly in the wide and rather empty space of the drawing-room,
all silver where the candles were grouped on the tea-table, and
ruddy again in the firelight. With the omnibuses and cabs still
running in his head, and his body still tingling with his quick
walk along the streets and in and out of traffic and foot-passengers,
this drawing-room seemed very remote and still; and the faces
of the elderly people were mellowed, at some distance from each
other, and had a bloom on them owing to the fact that the air
in the drawing-room was thickened by blue grains of mist. Mr.
Denham had come in as Mr. Fortescue, the eminent novelist, reached
the middle of a very long sentence. He kept this suspended while
the newcomer sat down, and Mrs. Hilbery deftly joined the severed
parts by leaning towards him and remarking:</p>

<p>"Now, what would you do if you were married to an engineer, and
had to live in Manchester, Mr. Denham?"</p>

<p>"Surely she could learn Persian," broke in a thin, elderly gentleman.
"Is there no retired schoolmaster or man of letters in Manchester
with whom she could read Persian?"</p>

<p>"A cousin of ours has married and gone to live in Manchester,"
Katharine explained. Mr. Denham muttered something, which was
indeed all that was required of him, and the novelist went on
where he had left off. Privately, Mr. Denham cursed himself very
sharply for having exchanged the freedom of the street for this
sophisticated drawing-room, where, among other disagreeables,
he certainly would not appear at his best. He glanced round him,
and saw that, save for Katharine, they were all over forty, the
only consolation being that Mr. Fortescue was a considerable celebrity,
so that to-morrow one might be glad to have met him.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been to Manchester?" he asked Katharine.</p>

<p>"Never," she replied.</p>

<p>"Why do you object to it, then?"</p>

<p>Katharine stirred her tea, and seemed to speculate, so Denham
thought, upon the duty of filling somebody else’s cup, but she
was really wondering how she was going to keep this strange young
man in harmony with the rest. She observed that he was compressing
his teacup, so that there was danger lest the thin china might
cave inwards. She could see that he was nervous; one would expect
a bony young man with his face slightly reddened by the wind,
and his hair not altogether smooth, to be nervous in such a party.
Further, he probably disliked this kind of thing, and had come
out of curiosity, or because her father had invited him&mdash;anyhow,
he would not be easily combined with the rest.</p>

<p>"I should think there would be no one to talk to in Manchester,"
she replied at random. Mr. Fortescue had been observing her for
a moment or two, as novelists are inclined to observe, and at
this remark he smiled, and made it the text for a little further
speculation.</p>

<p>"In spite of a slight tendency to exaggeration, Katharine decidedly
hits the mark," he said, and lying back in his chair, with his
opaque contemplative eyes fixed on the ceiling, and the tips of
his fingers pressed together, he depicted, first the horrors of
the streets of Manchester, and then the bare, immense moors on
the outskirts of the town, and then the scrubby little house in
which the girl would live, and then the professors and the miserable
young students devoted to the more strenuous works of our younger
dramatists, who would visit her, and how her appearance would
change by degrees, and how she would fly to London, and how Katharine
would have to lead her about, as one leads an eager dog on a chain,
past rows of clamorous butchers’ shops, poor dear creature.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Fortescue," exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, as he finished,
"I had just written to say how I envied her! I was thinking of
the big gardens and the dear old ladies in mittens, who read nothing
but the "Spectator,"  and snuff the candles. Have they <em>ALL
</em>disappeared? I told her she would find the nice things of
London without the horrid streets that depress one so."</p>

<p>"There is the University," said the thin gentleman, who had previously
insisted upon the existence of people knowing Persian.</p>

<p>"I know there are moors there, because I read about them in a
book the other day," said Katharine.</p>

<p>"I am grieved and amazed at the ignorance of my family," Mr.
Hilbery remarked. He was an elderly man, with a pair of oval,
hazel eyes which were rather bright for his time of life, and
relieved the heaviness of his face. He played constantly with
a little green stone attached to his watch-chain, thus displaying
long and very sensitive fingers, and had a habit of moving his
head hither and thither very quickly without altering the position
of his large and rather corpulent body, so that he seemed to be
providing himself incessantly with food for amusement and reflection
with the least possible expenditure of energy. One might suppose
that he had passed the time of life when his ambitions were personal,
or that he had gratified them as far as he was likely to do, and
now employed his considerable acuteness rather to observe and
reflect than to attain any result.</p>

<p>Katharine, so Denham decided, while Mr. Fortescue built up another
rounded structure of words, had a likeness to each of her parents,
but these elements were rather oddly blended. She had the quick,
impulsive movements of her mother, the lips parting often to speak,
and closing again; and the dark oval eyes of her father brimming
with light upon a basis of sadness, or, since she was too young
to have acquired a sorrowful point of view, one might say that
the basis was not sadness so much as a spirit given to contemplation
and self-control. Judging by her hair, her coloring, and the shape
of her features, she was striking, if not actually beautiful.
Decision and composure stamped her, a combination of qualities
that produced a very marked character, and one that was not calculated
to put a young man, who scarcely knew her, at his ease. For the
rest, she was tall; her dress was of some quiet color, with old
yellow-tinted lace for ornament, to which the spark of an ancient
jewel gave its one red gleam. Denham noticed that, although silent,
she kept sufficient control of the situation to answer immediately
her mother appealed to her for help, and yet it was obvious to
him that she attended only with the surface skin of her mind.
It struck him that her position at the tea-table, among all these
elderly people, was not without its difficulties, and he checked
his inclination to find her, or her attitude, generally antipathetic
to him. The talk had passed over Manchester, after dealing with
it very generously.</p>

<p>"Would it be the Battle of Trafalgar or the Spanish Armada, Katharine?" 
her mother demanded.</p>

<p>"Trafalgar, mother."</p>

<p>"Trafalgar, of course! How stupid of me! Another cup of tea,
with a thin slice of lemon in it, and then, dear Mr. Fortescue,
please explain my absurd little puzzle. One can’t help believing
gentlemen with Roman noses, even if one meets them in omnibuses."</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery here interposed so far as Denham was concerned, and
talked a great deal of sense about the solicitors’ profession,
and the changes which he had seen in his lifetime. Indeed, Denham
properly fell to his lot, owing to the fact that an article by
Denham upon some legal matter, published by Mr. Hilbery in his
Review, had brought them acquainted. But when a moment later Mrs.
Sutton Bailey was announced, he turned to her, and Mr. Denham
found himself sitting silent, rejecting possible things to say,
beside Katharine, who was silent too. Being much about the same
age and both under thirty, they were prohibited from the use of
a great many convenient phrases which launch conversation into
smooth waters. They were further silenced by Katharine’s rather
malicious determination not to help this young man, in whose upright
and resolute bearing she detected something hostile to her surroundings,
by any of the usual feminine amenities. They therefore sat silent,
Denham controlling his desire to say something abrupt and explosive,
which should shock her into life. But Mrs. Hilbery was immediately
sensitive to any silence in the drawing-room, as of a dumb note
in a sonorous scale, and leaning across the table she observed,
in the curiously tentative detached manner which always gave her
phrases the likeness of butterflies flaunting from one sunny spot
to another, "D’you know, Mr. Denham, you remind me so much of
dear Mr. Ruskin.... Is it his tie, Katharine, or his hair, or
the way he sits in his chair? Do tell me, Mr. Denham, are you
an admirer of Ruskin? Some one, the other day, said to me, ‘Oh,
no, we don’t read Ruskin, Mrs. Hilbery.’ What DO you read, I wonder?&mdash;for
you can’t spend all your time going up in aeroplanes and burrowing
into the bowels of the earth."</p>

<p>She looked benevolently at Denham, who said nothing articulate,
and then at Katharine, who smiled but said nothing either, upon
which Mrs. Hilbery seemed possessed by a brilliant idea, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I’m sure Mr. Denham would like to see our things, Katharine.
I’m sure he’s not like that dreadful young man, Mr. Ponting, who
told me that he considered it our duty to live exclusively in
the present. After all, what IS the present? Half of it’s the
past, and the better half, too, I should say," she added, turning
to Mr. Fortescue.</p>

<p>Denham rose, half meaning to go, and thinking that he had seen
all that there was to see, but Katharine rose at the same moment,
and saying, "Perhaps you would like to see the pictures," led
the way across the drawing-room to a smaller room opening out
of it.</p>

<p>The smaller room was something like a chapel in a cathedral,
or a grotto in a cave, for the booming sound of the traffic in
the distance suggested the soft surge of waters, and the oval
mirrors, with their silver surface, were like deep pools trembling
beneath starlight. But the comparison to a religious temple of
some kind was the more apt of the two, for the little room was
crowded with relics.</p>

<p>As Katharine touched different spots, lights sprang here and
there, and revealed a square mass of red-and-gold books, and then
a long skirt in blue-and-white paint lustrous behind glass, and
then a mahogany writing-table, with its orderly equipment, and,
finally, a picture above the table, to which special illumination
was accorded. When Katharine had touched these last lights, she
stood back, as much as to say, "There!" Denham found himself looked
down upon by the eyes of the great poet, Richard Alardyce, and
suffered a little shock which would have led him, had he been
wearing a hat, to remove it. The eyes looked at him out of the
mellow pinks and yellows of the paint with divine friendliness,
which embraced him, and passed on to contemplate the entire world.
The paint had so faded that very little but the beautiful large
eyes were left, dark in the surrounding dimness.</p>

<p>Katharine waited as though for him to receive a full impression,
and then she said:</p>

<p>"This is his writing-table. He used this pen," and she lifted
a quill pen and laid it down again. The writing-table was splashed
with old ink, and the pen disheveled in service. There lay the
gigantic gold-rimmed spectacles, ready to his hand, and beneath
the table was a pair of large, worn slippers, one of which Katharine
picked up, remarking:</p>

<p>"I think my grandfather must have been at least twice as large
as any one is nowadays. This," she went on, as if she knew what
she had to say by heart, "is the original manuscript of the ‘Ode
to Winter.’ The early poems are far less corrected than the later.
Would you like to look at it?"</p>

<p>While Mr. Denham examined the manuscript, she glanced up at her
grandfather, and, for the thousandth time, fell into a pleasant
dreamy state in which she seemed to be the companion of those
giant men, of their own lineage, at any rate, and the insignificant
present moment was put to shame. That magnificent ghostly head
on the canvas, surely, never beheld all the trivialities of a
Sunday afternoon, and it did not seem to matter what she and this
young man said to each other, for they were only small people.</p>

<p>"This is a copy of the first edition of the poems," she continued,
without considering the fact that Mr. Denham was still occupied
with the manuscript, "which contains several poems that have not
been reprinted, as well as corrections." She paused for a minute,
and then went on, as if these spaces had all been calculated.</p>

<p>"That lady in blue is my great-grandmother, by Millington. Here
is my uncle’s walking-stick&mdash;he was Sir Richard Warburton, you
know, and rode with Havelock to the Relief of Lucknow. And then,
let me see&mdash;oh, that’s the original Alardyce, 1697, the founder
of the family fortunes, with his wife. Some one gave us this bowl
the other day because it has their crest and initials. We think
it must have been given them to celebrate their silver wedding-day."</p>

<p>Here she stopped for a moment, wondering why it was that Mr.
Denham said nothing. Her feeling that he was antagonistic to her,
which had lapsed while she thought of her family possessions,
returned so keenly that she stopped in the middle of her catalog
and looked at him. Her mother, wishing to connect him reputably
with the great dead, had compared him with Mr. Ruskin; and the
comparison was in Katharine’s mind, and led her to be more critical
of the young man than was fair, for a young man paying a call
in a tail-coat is in a different element altogether from a head
seized at its climax of expressiveness, gazing immutably from
behind a sheet of glass, which was all that remained to her of
Mr. Ruskin. He had a singular face&mdash;a face built for swiftness
and decision rather than for massive contemplation; the forehead
broad, the nose long and formidable, the lips clean-shaven and
at once dogged and sensitive, the cheeks lean, with a deeply running
tide of red blood in them. His eyes, expressive now of the usual
masculine impersonality and authority, might reveal more subtle
emotions under favorable circumstances, for they were large, and
of a clear, brown color; they seemed unexpectedly to hesitate
and speculate; but Katharine only looked at him to wonder whether
his face would not have come nearer the standard of her dead heroes
if it had been adorned with side-whiskers. In his spare build
and thin, though healthy, cheeks, she saw tokens of an angular
and acrid soul. His voice, she noticed, had a slight vibrating
or creaking sound in it, as he laid down the manuscript and said:</p>

<p>"You must be very proud of your family, Miss Hilbery."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," Katharine answered, and she added, "Do you think
there’s anything wrong in that?"</p>

<p>"Wrong? How should it be wrong? It must be a bore, though, showing
your things to visitors," he added reflectively.</p>

<p>"Not if the visitors like them."</p>

<p>"Isn’t it difficult to live up to your ancestors?" he proceeded.</p>

<p>"I dare say I shouldn’t try to write poetry," Katharine replied.</p>

<p>"No. And that’s what I should hate. I couldn’t bear my grandfather
to cut me out. And, after all," Denham went on, glancing round
him satirically, as Katharine thought, "it’s not your grandfather
only. You’re cut out all the way round. I suppose you come of
one of the most distinguished families in England. There are the
Warburtons and the Mannings&mdash;and you’re related to the Otways,
aren’t you? I read it all in some magazine," he added.</p>

<p>"The Otways are my cousins," Katharine replied.</p>

<p>"Well," said Denham, in a final tone of voice, as if his argument
were proved.</p>

<p>"Well," said Katharine, "I don’t see that you’ve proved anything."</p>

<p>Denham smiled, in a peculiarly provoking way. He was amused and
gratified to find that he had the power to annoy his oblivious,
supercilious hostess, if he could not impress her; though he would
have preferred to impress her.</p>

<p>He sat silent, holding the precious little book of poems unopened
in his hands, and Katharine watched him, the melancholy or contemplative
expression deepening in her eyes as her annoyance faded. She appeared
to be considering many things. She had forgotten her duties.</p>

<p>"Well," said Denham again, suddenly opening the little book of
poems, as though he had said all that he meant to say or could,
with propriety, say. He turned over the pages with great decision,
as if he were judging the book in its entirety, the printing and
paper and binding, as well as the poetry, and then, having satisfied
himself of its good or bad quality, he placed it on the writing-table,
and examined the malacca cane with the gold knob which had belonged
to the soldier.</p>

<p>"But aren’t you proud of your family?" Katharine demanded.</p>

<p>"No," said Denham. "We’ve never done anything to be proud of&mdash;unless
you count paying one’s bills a matter for pride."</p>

<p>"That sounds rather dull," Katharine remarked.</p>

<p>"You would think us horribly dull," Denham agreed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I might find you dull, but I don’t think I should find
you ridiculous," Katharine added, as if Denham had actually brought
that charge against her family.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;because we’re not in the least ridiculous. We’re a respectable
middle-class family, living at Highgate."</p>

<p>"We don’t live at Highgate, but we’re middle class too, I suppose."</p>

<p>Denham merely smiled, and replacing the malacca cane on the rack,
he drew a sword from its ornamental sheath.</p>

<p>"That belonged to Clive, so we say," said Katharine, taking up
her duties as hostess again automatically.</p>

<p>"Is it a lie?" Denham inquired.</p>

<p>"It’s a family tradition. I don’t know that we can prove it."</p>

<p>"You see, we don’t have traditions in our family," said Denham.</p>

<p>"You sound very dull," Katharine remarked, for the second time.</p>

<p>"Merely middle class," Denham replied.</p>

<p>"You pay your bills, and you speak the truth. I don’t see why
you should despise us."</p>

<p>Mr. Denham carefully sheathed the sword which the Hilberys said
belonged to Clive.</p>

<p>"I shouldn’t like to be you; that’s all I said," he replied,
as if he were saying what he thought as accurately as he could.</p>

<p>"No, but one never would like to be any one else."</p>

<p>"I should. I should like to be lots of other people."</p>

<p>"Then why not us?" Katharine asked.</p>

<p>Denham looked at her as she sat in her grandfather’s arm-chair,
drawing her great-uncle’s malacca cane smoothly through her fingers,
while her background was made up equally of lustrous blue-and-white
paint, and crimson books with gilt lines on them. The vitality
and composure of her attitude, as of a bright-plumed bird poised
easily before further flights, roused him to show her the limitations
of her lot. So soon, so easily, would he be forgotten.</p>

<p>"You’ll never know anything at first hand," he began, almost
savagely. "It’s all been done for you. You’ll never know the pleasure
of buying things after saving up for them, or reading books for
the first time, or making discoveries."</p>

<p>"Go on," Katharine observed, as he paused, suddenly doubtful,
when he heard his voice proclaiming aloud these facts, whether
there was any truth in them.</p>

<p>"Of course, I don’t know how you spend your time," he continued,
a little stiffly, "but I suppose you have to show people round.
You are writing a life of your grandfather, aren’t you? And this
kind of thing"&mdash;he nodded towards the other room, where they could
hear bursts of cultivated laughter&mdash;"must take up a lot of time."</p>

<p>She looked at him expectantly, as if between them they were decorating
a small figure of herself, and she saw him hesitating in the disposition
of some bow or sash.</p>

<p>"You’ve got it very nearly right," she said, "but I only help
my mother. I don’t write myself."</p>

<p>"Do you do anything yourself?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked. "I don’t leave the house at ten
and come back at six."</p>

<p>"I don’t mean that."</p>

<p>Mr. Denham had recovered his self-control; he spoke with a quietness
which made Katharine rather anxious that he should explain himself,
but at the same time she wished to annoy him, to waft him away
from her on some light current of ridicule or satire, as she was
wont to do with these intermittent young men of her father’s.</p>

<p>"Nobody ever does do anything worth doing nowadays," she remarked.
"You see"&mdash;she tapped the volume of her grandfather’s poems&mdash;"we
don’t even print as well as they did, and as for poets or painters
or novelists&mdash;there are none; so, at any rate, I’m not singular."</p>

<p>"No, we haven’t any great men," Denham replied. "I’m very glad
that we haven’t. I hate great men. The worship of greatness in
the nineteenth century seems to me to explain the worthlessness
of that generation."</p>

<p>Katharine opened her lips and drew in her breath, as if to reply
with equal vigor, when the shutting of a door in the next room
withdrew her attention, and they both became conscious that the
voices, which had been rising and falling round the tea-table,
had fallen silent; the light, even, seemed to have sunk lower.
A moment later Mrs. Hilbery appeared in the doorway of the ante-room.
She stood looking at them with a smile of expectancy on her face,
as if a scene from the drama of the younger generation were being
played for her benefit. She was a remarkable-looking woman, well
advanced in the sixties, but owing to the lightness of her frame
and the brightness of her eyes she seemed to have been wafted
over the surface of the years without taking much harm in the
passage. Her face was shrunken and aquiline, but any hint of sharpness
was dispelled by the large blue eyes, at once sagacious and innocent,
which seemed to regard the world with an enormous desire that
it should behave itself nobly, and an entire confidence that it
could do so, if it would only take the pains.</p>

<p>Certain lines on the broad forehead and about the lips might
be taken to suggest that she had known moments of some difficulty
and perplexity in the course of her career, but these had not
destroyed her trustfulness, and she was clearly still prepared
to give every one any number of fresh chances and the whole system
the benefit of the doubt. She wore a great resemblance to her
father, and suggested, as he did, the fresh airs and open spaces
of a younger world.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "how do you like our things, Mr. Denham?"</p>

<p>Mr. Denham rose, put his book down, opened his mouth, but said
nothing, as Katharine observed, with some amusement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hilbery handled the book he had laid down.</p>

<p>"There are some books that <em>LIVE," </em>she mused. "They are
young with us, and they grow old with us. Are you fond of poetry,
Mr. Denham? But what an absurd question to ask! The truth is,
dear Mr. Fortescue has almost tired me out. He is so eloquent
and so witty, so searching and so profound that, after half an
hour or so, I feel inclined to turn out all the lights. But perhaps
he’d be more wonderful than ever in the dark. What d’you think,
Katharine? Shall we give a little party in complete darkness?
There’d have to be bright rooms for the bores...."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Denham held out his hand.</p>

<p>"But we’ve any number of things to show you!" Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed,
taking no notice of it. "Books, pictures, china, manuscripts,
and the very chair that Mary Queen of Scots sat in when she heard
of Darnley’s murder. I must lie down for a little, and Katharine
must change her dress (though she’s wearing a very pretty one),
but if you don’t mind being left alone, supper will be at eight.
I dare say you’ll write a poem of your own while you’re waiting.
Ah, how I love the firelight! Doesn’t our room look charming?"</p>

<p>She stepped back and bade them contemplate the empty drawing-room,
with its rich, irregular lights, as the flames leapt and wavered.</p>

<p>"Dear things!" she exclaimed. "Dear chairs and tables! How like
old friends they are&mdash;faithful, silent friends. Which reminds
me, Katharine, little Mr. Anning is coming to-night, and Tite
Street, and Cadogan Square.... Do remember to get that drawing
of your great-uncle glazed. Aunt Millicent remarked it last time
she was here, and I know how it would hurt me to see MY father
in a broken glass."</p>

<p>It was like tearing through a maze of diamond-glittering spiders’
webs to say good-bye and escape, for at each movement Mrs. Hilbery
remembered something further about the villainies of picture-framers
or the delights of poetry, and at one time it seemed to the young
man that he would be hypnotized into doing what she pretended
to want him to do, for he could not suppose that she attached
any value whatever to his presence. Katharine, however, made an
opportunity for him to leave, and for that he was grateful to
her, as one young person is grateful for the understanding of
another.</p>
