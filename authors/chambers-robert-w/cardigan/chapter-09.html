<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>My first three weeks in the woods were weeks of heaven. Never
had I seen the forest so beautiful, never had the soft velvet
lights clothed the wilderness with such exquisite mystery. Along
the stony beds of lost ravines I passed and saw the frosty bowlders
lie like silver mounds in the dawn, glimmering through steaming
waters. I passed at eventide when the sunset turned the cliffs
to crumbling crags of gold, and I saw massed mountain peaks reflected
in pools where the shadows of great fish moved like clouds.</p>

<p>I ate and drank and slept in the dim wood stillness undisturbed;
I waked when my guide, the sun, flamed through the forest, and
I followed in his lead, resting when he hung circling in the noonday
heavens, following again when he resumed the sky-trail towards
the west, seeking my couch when he lay down below the world's
blue edge to fold him in the blanket of the night.</p>

<p>Twice came the rain, delicately perfumed showers shaking down
through a million leaves, leaving frail trails of vapour errant
through the trees, and powdered jewels on every leaf.</p>

<p>And I lived well on that swift trail where the gray grouse scuttled
through the saplings, and in every mossy streamlet the cold, dusky
troutlings fought for the knot of scarlet yarn on my short hand-line.
Once I saw bronzed turkeys, all huddled in a brood at twilight,
craning and peering from their tree-perch; but let them go, as
I had meat to spare. Once, too, at dawn, I heard a bull-moose
lipping tree-buds, and lay still in my blanket while the huge
beast wandered past, crack! crash! and slop! slop! through the
creek, his hide all smeared with clay and a swarm of forest flies
whirling over him. Lord, how rank he did smell, but for all that
I was glad the wind set not the other way, for it is sometimes
the toss of a coin what your bull-moose will do, run or fight
at sight; nor is it even doubtful in September, when the moose-cow
wallows and bawls across the marshes for her antlered gallant
on the ridge.</p>

<p>I saw but one moose, for there are not many in our forests, though
they say the Canadas do swarm with them, and also with elks and
caribous.</p>

<p>There were few birds to be seen except near rivers: a blue-gray
meat-bird here and there whining in the hemlocks, a great owl
huddled on a limb, and sometimes a troop of black-cheeked chickadees
that came cheerfully to hand for a crumb of corn. Squirrels were
everywhere&mdash;that is, everywhere except through the pine belts,
and there I had to make out with the bitter flesh of those villain
partridges which feed on spruce-tips. I'd as soon eat a hawk in
winter or dine on slices of fried spruce-gum, for truly there
is more nourishment in a moccasin than in these ignoble birds
dressed up like toothsome partridges.</p>

<p>I had not met a soul on the trail, nor had I found any fresh
signs save once, and that was the print of a white man's moccasin
on the edge of a sandy strip near the head-waters of the Ohio,
which is called the Alleghany, north of Fort Pitt.</p>

<p>This foot-mark disturbed me, although it was three days old and
pointing north. But that signified nothing, for the man who made
it had come in a canoe, yet I could find no sign that a canoe
had been beached there, nor, indeed, any further marks of moccasins,
and I made moderate haste to get under cover, as I am timid about
things I cannot account for.</p>

<p>Reason enough, moreover, for if there were no signs except that
single imprint, it was clear that the man who left that mark was
wading the river because he wished to leave no trail. And who
is not suspicious of those who appear to be at pains to conceal
their tracks?</p>

<p>There is something terrifying in the sudden apparition of a fellow-creature
in the woods. When one has been living alone in the forest solitude,
day after day, perhaps even craving company, I know nothing so
shocking as the unexpected sight of another man in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Why this is so, why fear, caution, and anger are invariably the
primal instincts, I do not fully understand.</p>

<p>Sometimes, lying perdu, I have seen the tasselled ears of a wild-cat
flatten at first sight of a stranger cat; I have seen the wolverine
snarl hideously as he winded a strange comrade; I have seen the
solitary timber-wolf halt, hair on end and every hot fang bared,
where a brother wolf had crossed his trail an hour before.</p>

<p>So I; for as I slunk away from that foot-mark in the sand-willows,
I found myself priming my rifle and looking behind me with all
the horror of a Robinson Crusoe, though I had miles of country
to avoid the unknown man withal.</p>

<p>Early that morning, having crossed, as nearly as I could make
out, the boundary between our Province of New York and the Province
of Pennsylvania, I had approached, somewhat nearer than I meant
to, the carrying-place on the Alleghany, which lies directly in
the Fort Pitt trail.</p>

<p>Now, at mid-day, the sun heating the forest, I found my pack
very heavy and my shirt wet with exertion, but dared not halt
until I had circled around that carrying-place. So I toiled on,
the very rifle in my hand heavy as lead, and my eyes nearly blinded
with the sweat that poured from my hair and neck, bathing me in
a sort of stinging coolness. My stomach, too, was asking the hour,
and the green-eyed deer-flies whirled over me, fierce for blood,
for I durst not lag even to wash my face in oil of pennyroyal.</p>

<p>It was only when at last above the trees in the east I perceived
the blue peak of a mountain that I knew I was safe enough; for
the peak in the east belonged to the Alleghany range, and I had
steered a fine circle without losing a mile.</p>

<p>However, I jogged on along a runway made hard by the hoof of
countless deer herds, until I came to a thread of water curving
through the moss like a sword-blade on green velvet. Here I knelt,
let go my pack, and rolled over on the moss, dog-tired.</p>

<p>Hands clasped on my empty stomach I lay looking up at the sky
through the matted leaves that thatched my forest roof, too tired
even to drink. But the accursed deer-flies drove me to water as
they drive the deer, and I drank my fill and smeared me with pennyroyal
and tallow, face and wrists.</p>

<p>For the first time since I had entered the wilderness I made
no fire, but munched a cold breast of partridge and drove it into
my stomach with bits of ash-cake, drinking a mouthful between
bites to moisten the dry cheer. I ate very slowly, my eyes making
their mechanical circuit of the silent trees, my ears ever flattened
for a noise behind me.</p>

<p>Silence breeds silence; man's movements in the woods are soft
and cat-like where caution is an instinct. I speak of true woodsmen&mdash;those
who know the solitary life&mdash;not of loud and careless men who swagger
into God's woodland mysteries as to a tavern tap-room.</p>

<p>Now, as I sat there, crumbs on my knees yet unbrushed, a sudden
instinct arose in me that I had been followed; nay, not so sudden,
either, for the vague idea had been slowly taking shape since
I had seen that sign in the river-bed among the willows.</p>

<p>I had absolutely no reason for believing this; the foot-print
was three days old and it pointed north. Yet, at the mere thought,
the skin on my neck began to roughen and my nose gave little twitches.
Unconsciously I had already risen, priming my rifle, and for a
moment, I stood there, ankle deep in moss. Then, moved by no impulse
of my own, I swear, I lifted my pack and passed swiftly along
the little brook towards the main trail. Presently, through the
willows to the right, I caught a glimpse of a shallow stream rushing
noiselessly over a sand bottom, and on the other side of the stream
I saw a notched tree, the Fort Pitt trail!</p>

<p>Now I deliberately made a string of plain foot-tracks along the
sandy stream, pointing towards the shallowest spot. Here I forded,
and made more tracks in the mud, entering the Fort Pitt trail.
I ran down this trail till I came to a brier, and on the thorns
of a spray which crossed the broad, hard trail, I left a few strings
from my fringed hunting-shirt. Then I began to walk backward till
I reached the spot where I had entered the trail from the sandy
stream. I backed down this bank, forded the shallows, then, instead
of coming out on the sand, I waded up stream to my little thread
of a brook, and up that brook till I found a great log choking
it. And behind this log I squatted, panting, and astonished at
my own performance.</p>

<p>Yet, even now, I could not find reason to blush at my timid precautions,
for that feeling of being followed still haunted me. It was neither
a coward's panic nor a cool man's alarm; it was something that
drove me to cover my tracks. The white hare does it when unpursued
by hounds; the grouse do it when no pointer follows&mdash;why? I know
no more than the white hare or the grouse.</p>

<p>From my form among the ferns, rabbit-like I huddled with palpitating
flanks and nose atwitch in the wind. Nothing stirred save those
sad, deformed leaves that drift earthward, dead ere spring is
fled. Bubble! bubble! dripped the stream, its tiny waterfall full
of voices, now clear, now indistinct, but always calling sweetly,
"Michael! Michael! Michael!" And if your name be not Michael,
nevertheless it will call you by your name. And the voice is ever
the voice of the best beloved.</p>

<p>Alert, sniffing the air, I still could hear the voice of Silver
Heels, down under the waterfall, and sometimes she called through
laughter, "Michael!" and sometimes far away like a wind-blown
cry, and sometimes like a whisper close to my face.</p>

<p>So rang her voice as an old song in my ears, the while my eyes
scanned the dappled tree-trunks of a silvery beechwood, east and
west, and through a long vista where, across a sunny streak of
water, the Fort Pitt trail ran southwest.</p>

<p>The sun had spanned an hour's length on the blue dial of the
sky, yet nothing moved in the woods. Still, strangely, I felt
no impatience, no desire to chide myself for good time lost in
groundless watchfulness. One by one the tall trees shed young
leaves too early dead; the voices in the waterfall made low melody;
the white sun-spots waned and glowed, mottling the silvered tree-trunks,
lacing the water with a paler fretwork.</p>

<p>I sat now with my cheek on the cool, moist log, my rifle in my
lap, watching the trees along the Fort Pitt trail. And, as I watched,
I saw a man come out on the sandy bank of the stream and kneel
down where my tracks crossed to the water's edge.</p>

<p>I was not astonished, but all over me my flesh moved, and without
a sound I sank down behind my log into a soft ball of buckskin.</p>

<p>The man was Walter Butler. I knew him, though God alone knows
how I could, for he wore the shirt of a Mohawk and beaded leggings
to the hips, and at that distance might have been an Indian. He
bore a rifle, and there was a hatchet in his beaded belt, and
on his head he wore a round cap of moleskin under which his black,
coarse hair, freed from the queue, fell to his chin.</p>

<p>He crouched there, examining my tracks with closest attention
for full a minute, then rose gracefully and followed, tracing
them up to the Fort Pitt trail.</p>

<p>Here I saw two other men come swiftly through the trees to meet
him, but, though they gesticulated violently and pointed down
the stream, they spoke too low for me to hear a single whisper.</p>

<p>Suddenly, to my horror, a canoe shot across my line of sight
and stopped as suddenly, held by the setting-pole in midstream.
It contained a white man, who leaned on the setting-pole, silently
awaiting the result of the conference on the bank above.</p>

<p>The conference ended abruptly; I saw two of the men start south
towards Fort Pitt, while Butler came hastily down to the water's
edge and waded out to the canoe.</p>

<p>He boarded the frail craft from the bow, straddling it skilfully
and working his way to his place. Then the two setting-poles flashed
in the sunshine and the canoe shot out of sight.</p>

<p>My mind was working rapidly now, but, at first, anger succeeded
blank perplexity. What did Captain Butler mean by following me
through the forests? The answer came ere the question had been
fully formed, and I knew he hated me and meant to kill me.</p>

<p>How he had learned of my mission, whether he had actually learned
of it, or only suspected it from my disappearance, concerned me
little. These things were certain: he was Lord Dunmore's emissary
as I was the emissary of Sir William; he was bound for Cresap's
camp as was I; and he intended to intercept me and kill me if
that meant the winning of the race. Ay, he meant to kill me, anyhow,
for how could he ever again appear in Johnstown if I lived to
bear witness to his treachery?</p>

<p>I must give up my visit to the Cayugas for the present. It was
to be a race now to Cresap's camp, and, though they had their
canoe to speed withal, the advantage lay on my side; for I was
seeking no man's life, whereas they must soon find that they had
over-run their scent and would spend precious time in ambushes.
Besides, they doubtless believed that somewhere I had a canoe
hid, and that would keep them hanging around the carry-trails
while I made time by circling them.</p>

<p>One thing disturbed me: two of them had gone by water and two
by the Fort Pitt trail, and this threw me hopelessly into the
wilderness without the ease of a trodden way.</p>

<p>Slowly I resumed my pack, reprimed my rifle, and turned my nose
southward, bearing far enough west to keep out of earshot from
the river and the trail.</p>

<p>At first I had looked upon Fort Pitt as a hospitable wayside
refuge, marking nine-tenths of my journey towards Cresap's camp.
But now I dared not present myself there, with Walter Butler hot
on my trail, armed not only with hatchet and rifle, but also doubtless
with some order of Lord Dunmore which might compel the officers
at Fort Pitt to hand me over to Butler on his mere demand.</p>

<p>For, although Fort Pitt was rightfully on Pennsylvania soil,
it had long been claimed by Virginia, and it was a Virginia garrison
that now held it. Thus, should I stop there, I should be under
the laws of Virginia and under the claw-thumb of Dunmore or anybody
who might claim authority to represent him.</p>

<p>There is, I have been told, a vast region which lies between
the Alleghany Mountains and the Mississippi, a desolate wilderness
save for a few British garrisons at Natchez, at Vincennes, and
at Detroit. These troops are placed there in order to establish
the claim of our King to the region lately wrested from the French.
Fort Pitt commanded the gateway to this wilderness, and the Ohio
flowed through it; and for years Virginia and Pennsylvania had
disputed for the right to control this gateway. Virginia held
it by might, not right. Through it Daniel Boone had gone some
years before; now Cresap had followed; and who could doubt that
the Governor of Virginia had urged him on?</p>

<p>But the march of Cresap not only disturbed Sir William in his
stewardship; it angered all Pennsylvania, and this is the reason:</p>

<p>The Virginians under Cresap went to settle, and to keep the Indians
at a distance; the Pennsylvanians, on the other hand, went only
to trade with the Cayugas, and they were furious to see Cresap's
men spoil their trade. This I learned from Sir William on our
evening walks about Quider's hut; and I learned, too, that Fort
Pitt was a Virginia fortress on Pennsylvania soil, guarded not
only against the savages, but also against the Pennsylvanians,
who traded powder and shot and rifles with the Cayugas, and thus,
according to my Lord Dunmore practically incited the savages to
resist such philanthropists as himself.</p>

<p>Clearly then, no emissary of Sir William would be welcomed at
Pittsburg fortress or town; and I saw nothing for it but to push
on through the gateway of the west, avoiding Butler's men as best
I could, and seeking the silly, deluded Cresap under the very
nose of my Lord Dunmore.</p>

<p>My progress was slow; at times I sank between tree-roots, up
to the thighs in moss; at times the little maidens of the flowering
briers bade me tarry in their sharp, perfumed embrace. Now it
was a wiry moose-bush snare that enlaced my ankles and sent me
sprawling, pack and all; now the tough laurel bound me to the
shoulders in slender ropes of blossoms which only my knife could
sever. Tired out while yet the sun sent its reddening western
rays deep into the forest, I knelt again, dropped my pack under
a hemlock thicket, and crawled out to a heap of rocks which overhung
a ravine.</p>

<p>The sunlight fell full in my face and warmed my body as I crept
through a mat of blueberry bushes and peered over the edge of
the crag down into the ravine.</p>

<p>A hundred feet below the Alleghany flowed, a glassy stream tinted
with gold, reflecting forest and cliff and a tiny triangle of
cobalt sky. Its surface was a mirror without a flaw, save where
a solitary wild-duck floated, trailing a rippled wake, or steered
hither and thither, craning its green neck after water-flies and
gnats.</p>

<p>How still it was below; how quiet the whole world was&mdash;quieter
for the hushed rumour of the winds on some far mountain spur.</p>

<p>The little blue caps which every baby peak had worn all day were
now changed for night-caps of palest rose; the wild plum's bloom
dusted every velvet mountain flank, the forest was robed in flowing
purple to its roots, which the still river washed in sands of
gold.</p>

<p>Below me a brown hawk wheeled, rising in narrowing spirals like
a wind-blown leaf, higher, higher, till of a sudden its bright
eye flashed level with mine and it sheered westward with a rush
of whistling feathers. I watched it drifting away under the clouds
into the sunset, with a silly prayer that wings might be fastened
to my tired feet, as Minnomonedo, leaning out from the centre
of heaven, dipped the first bird in Mon-o-ma, the Spirit Water,
which was also I-ós-co, the Water of Light. "<em>Te-i-o! Te-i-o!</em>"
I murmured, "<em>On-ti-o</em>&mdash;<em>I-é nia</em>, oh, <em>Mon-a-kee</em>!"</p>

<p>For God knows&mdash;and forgives&mdash;that, at sixteen, I was but an Algonquin
in superstition, fearing Minnomonedo and seeking refuge in that
God whom I did not dread.</p>

<p>In towns and cities the savage legends which I had imbibed with
my first milk vanished from my mind completely, leaving no barriers
to a calm worship of the Most High. But in the woods it was different;
every leaf, every blossom represented links in those interminable
chains of legends with which I had been nourished, and from which
nothing but death can entirely wean me.</p>

<p>To me, the birds that passed, the shy, furry creatures that slipped
back into the demi-light, the insects, the rocks, water, clouds,
sun, moon, and stars were comrades with names and histories and
purposes, exercising influences on each other and on me, and calling
for an individual and intimate recognition which I cared not to
disregard in the forest, though I might safely forget them amid
the crowded wastes of civilization.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that I credited the existence of such creatures
as the wampum bird, nor did I believe that the first belt was
made of a quill dropped to earth from the fearsome thing. This
was nonsense; even at night I dared mock at it. But still every
human being knows that, in the midnight wilderness, strange things
do pass which no man can explain&mdash;strange beasts move, strange
shapes dance by elf-fires, and trees talk aloud, one to another.
If this be witchcraft, or if it be but part of a life which our
vast black forests hide forever from the sun, I know not. Sir
William holds that there are no witches, yet I once heard him
curse a Huron hag for drying up his Devon cattle with a charm.
We Christians know that a red belt lies ever between God and Satan.
And I, as a woodsman, also know that, <em>if</em> there be demons
in Biskoona, a thousand bloody belts lie for all time twixt <em>Minno</em>
and <em>Mudjee</em>, call them what you will, and their voices
are in the passing thunder and in the noises of the eight great
winds.</p>

<p>Sprawling there on the warm rocks like a young panther in the
sun, ears attuned to the faintest whisper of danger, I gnawed
a strip of dried squirrel's flesh and sucked up the water from
a dripping mossy cleft, sweet cheer to an empty belly.</p>

<p>As for fire, that was denied me by my sense, though I knew that
the coming night would stiffen me. But I cared little for that:
what occupied my thoughts was how to obtain food when a single
shot might bring Butler and his trackers hot on the scent ere
the rifle smoke had blown clear of the trees.</p>

<p>It was not always that one might knock down a stupid partridge
with a stick, nor yet were there trout in every water-crack. I
looked down at the darkening river, where the wild mallard still
circled and darted its neck after unseen midges; and my mouth
watered, for he was passing plump, this Southern lingerer, fresh
from the great gulf.</p>

<p>"If he be there in the morning," thought I, "perhaps I may risk
a shot and take to my heels." For had I not thrown Butler and
his crew from my trail as easily as I brush a bunch of deer-flies
from my hunting-shirt? And if I could do it once, I could repeat
the trick in a dozen pretty ways of my own knowledge and of Thayendanegea's
invention. Still I knew he was no forest blunderer, this Butler
man; he had proved that in the Canadas; and I did not mean to
be over-confident nor to rock caution to sleep in my first triumph.</p>

<p>And Lord!&mdash;how I hated him and wished him evil, waking, sleeping,
in sickness and in health, ay, living or dead, I wished him evil
and black mischance on his dark soul's flight to the last accounting.
So, with thoughts of hatred and revenge, I saw the cinders of
the sun go out behind the forest and the web of night settling
over the world. Wrapped in my blanket, curled up in a bed of blueberry,
I folded my hands over my body like a chipmunk and said a prayer
to the God whom I did not fear. After that I reprimed my rifle,
covering flint and pan to keep out the dew, settled the stock
in a crevice near my head, and lay down again to watch for the
full moon, whose yellow light was already soaring up behind a
black peak in the east. And all night long I lay on that borderland
of sleep which men in danger dare not traverse lest a sound find
them unready. Slumbering, again and again I saw the moon through
slitted lids, yet I rested and slept a sweet wholesome sleep which
renewed my vigour by its very lightness.</p>

<p>Long before the sun had done painting the sky-scenes for his
royal entry, I had brushed the dew from cap and blanket, primed
my rifle afresh, and cautiously crawled to the cliff's brink.</p>

<p>Mist covered the river; I could not have seen a canoe had it
been floating under my own crag; neither could I see my wild duck,
though at times I heard his drowsy quack somewhere below, and
the answering quack of his mate, now rejoining her lord and master.
Perhaps a whole flock had come in by night.</p>

<p>Now, the intense stillness of early morn did not reassure me,
nor did the careless quacking of the ducks convince me that the
river and shore were untenanted save for them. Many a drowsing
mallard has been caught by a lean fox or knocked on the head with
a paddle. I had no mind to creep down and risk a shot at a shadow
on the misty water, not knowing what else that mist might conceal.
However, I was fiercely hungry, and I meant to have a duck. So,
shivering, I undressed, and, stark naked, I picked my way down
the clefts to the base of the cliff and slipped into the water
like a mink.</p>

<p>The water was warmer than the air; I swam without a splash, straight
towards the quacking sound, seeing nothing but the blank fog as
yet, but meaning to seize the first duck by the legs if he were
asleep, or by his neck if he dived.</p>

<p>Now, although I made no sound in the water, all around me I felt
the presence of live creatures stirring, and soon there began
a peevish sound of half-awakened water-fowl, so that I knew I
was near to a flock of them.</p>

<p>Suddenly, right in my face, a duck squawked and flapped; I grasped
at the bird, but held only a fistful o' feathers. In an instant
the mist around me rang with strong wings beating the water, and
with a whistling roar the flock drove past, dashing me with spray
till I, smothered and choked, flung up my arm towards a floating
tree-trunk. To my horror the log rolled completely over, and out
of it two men fell, shrieking, on top of me, for the log I had
grasped was a bark canoe, and I had spilled out my enemies on
my own head.</p>

<p>We all went down, but I sank clear of the unseen men and rose
again to swim for my life. They came to the surface behind me;
I could see their shadowy heads over my shoulder, for the mist
was lifting.</p>

<p>They were shouting now, evidently to others on the opposite bank,
but my way led not thither, and I swam swiftly for the foot of
my cliff, missing it again and again in the fog, until I found
it at last, and ran panting and dripping up the cleft.</p>

<p>When I reached my rifle I leaned over the crag to look, but the
river gorge remained choked with vapour, though here above all
was bright gray dawn. The shouting below came clearly to my ears,
also the splashing. I judged that the two men had thrown their
arms over the capsized canoe, and thus, hands clasped, were making
out to keep afloat; for in this manner only can a capsized canoe
serve two men.</p>

<p>Drying my bruised feet and dripping skin in my blanket, I hastened
to dress and strap on my pack, keeping a restless eye on the gulf
below. When I was prepared, the sun, pushing up behind the peaks
in the east, was already scattering the mist into long, thin clouds,
and at intervals I made out the canoe floating bottom up, close
inshore, and I heard the wrecked men paddling with their hands.</p>

<p>Presently Walter Butler's voice sounded from the bank, cautioning
the swimming men to proceed slowly, and inquiring what was the
cause for their upsetting.</p>

<p>They replied that a deer, swimming the river, had planted one
foot in their bow while they slept, and so overturned the canoe.
But I knew that Walter Butler would not be long in discovering
the tracks of my naked feet in the shore-sands where I had landed
while searching for my cliff, so I prepared to leave without further
ado, though angrily tempted to make a target of the phantom group
below.</p>

<p>So, with a stomach stayed with a mouthful of corn and water,
I started silently westward, meaning to make a circle, and, hiding
my tracks, recross the river to take advantage of their sure pursuit
by travelling on the Fort Pitt trail until again hunted into the
forest.</p>

<p>Munching my corn as I plodded on, I still kept a keen lookout
behind, though in the forest one can seldom see but a rod or two,
and sometimes not even a yard except down the vista of some woodland
stream.</p>

<p>It was useless to attempt to cover my tracks, for I could neither
avoid breaking branches in the tangle, nor keep from leaving foot-prints
on the soft moss which even a Boston schoolmaster might read a-running.
But I could trot along the tops of fallen logs like a partridge,
and use every watercourse that wound my way, so breaking my trail
for all save a hound or an Indian. And this I did to check the
pursuit which I knew must begin sooner or later.</p>

<p>It began even sooner than I expected, and almost caught me napping,
for, resting a moment to scrutinize a broad stretch of barren
ground, around which I had just circled in order to keep cover,
I saw a man creeping among the rocks and berry-scrub, doubtless
nosing about for my trail. A moment later another man moved on
the eastern edge of the mountain flank, and at the same time,
far up the river, I saw the canoe floating.</p>

<p>That was enough for me, and I started on a dog-trot down the
slope and along the river-bed, plunging through willows and alders
till I came to a bend from which the naked shoulder of the mountain
could not be seen.</p>

<p>Thayendanegea had taught me to do what people thought I would
be likely to do, but to accomplish it so craftily that they would
presently think I had done something else.</p>

<p>When at length those who pursued me should find my trail on the
southern border of the open scrub-land, they would have no difficulty
in following me down the long incline to the river where I now
stood, ankle-deep in icy water. I had halted exactly opposite
to the mouth of a rocky stream, and it was natural that I should
ford the rapids here and continue, on the other bank, up that
stream to hide my trail. They would expect me to do it, so this
I did, and ran up the bed of the stream for a few rods, carelessly
leaving a tiny dust line of corn-meal on the rocks as though in
my headlong flight my sack had started a seam.</p>

<p>Then I turned around and waded down the brook again to the river,
out to the shallow rapids, and so, knee-deep, hastened southward
again to put the next bend between me and the canoe.</p>

<p>I was making but slow progress, for my sack galled me, the slippery,
wet buckskin leggings chafed knee and ankle raw, and my soaked
hunting-shirt glued its skirts to my thighs, impeding me at every
stride. My drenched moccasins also left wet tracks on the Fort
Pitt trail, which I knew the sun could not dry out for hours yet;
but I did not believe that Butler and his crew would come up in
time to see them.</p>

<p>I was mistaken; scarcely half an hour had passed ere their accursed
canoe appeared bobbing down the rapids, paddles flashing in the
sun; and I took to the forest again at a lively gait, somewhat
disturbed, though my self-confidence permitted no actual anxiety
to assail me.</p>

<p>I now played them one of Brant's tricks, which was to change
moccasins for a brand-new pair of larger size, and soled with
ridged bear-hide. I also reversed them, toe pointing to the rear,
and they made a fine mark on the moss.</p>

<p>Every twenty paces I stooped to brush up the pile of the velvet
moss and so obliterate my tracks for the next twenty paces.</p>

<p>In this manner I travelled for three hours without sign of pursuit,
and had it not been for my pack I could have jogged on till night.
But my galled shoulders creaked for mercy, and I struggled out
once more into the Fort Pitt trail and stood panting and alert,
drenched with sweat.</p>

<p>The trail had been trodden within the hour; I saw fresh sign
of two different moccasins, and of a coarse boot of foreign style,
all pointing southward. The moccasins were like one pair I had
in my pack, of Albany make; the wearer of the boots toed in. These
things I noticed quicker than I could relate them, and instinctively
I changed my moccasins for the third time, and ran on, stepping
carefully in the tracks of him who wore the Albany moccasins,
and keeping a sharp eye ahead.</p>

<p>I had run nearly half a mile, and was beginning to look about
for a vantage spot to rest on, when a turn in the trail brought
me out along the river.</p>

<p>I scanned the stream thoroughly, and discovered nothing to balk
at, but I could not see the opposite bank very plainly because
the forest rose from the water's edge, and all was dusky where
the low-arched branches screened the shore.</p>

<p>Under this a canoe might lie, or might not; there was no means
of telling. I sniffed at the dusky screen of leaves, but had my
sniffing for my trouble, as nothing moved there.</p>

<p>It was clear I could not remain in the Fort Pitt trail with at
least two of the Butler crew behind me. Should I take to the tangled
forest again? My shoulders begged me not to, but my senses jogged
me to the prudent course. However, at certain times in men's careers,
when body and mind clamour for different answers, a moment comes,
even to the most cautious, when a risk smacks as sweet as a banquet.</p>

<p>One of those moments was coming now; I knew the risk of traversing
that open bit of trail, but the hazard had a winy flavour withal,
and besides it was such a few feet to safety&mdash;such a little risk.
And I trotted out on the open trail.</p>

<p>Instantly a shot echoed in the gorge, and the pack on my back
jerked. I never made such a jump in all my life before, for I
had cleared the open like a scared fawn, and now stood glued to
a tree, peering at the blue cloud of smoke which trailed along
the opposite shore.</p>

<p>There it was!&mdash;there came their accursed canoe like a live creature
poking its painted snout out of the leafy screen, and I cocked
and primed my rifle and waited.</p>

<p>There were two men in the canoe; one paddled gingerly, the other
had reloaded his rifle and was now squatting in the bow. But what
astonished and enraged me was that I knew the men, Wraxall the
barber, and Toby Tice, perfectly well. They were, moreover, tenants
of Sir William, living with their families in Johnstown, and their
murderous treachery horrified me.</p>

<p>I had never shot at a man; I raised my rifle and held them on
the sights for a moment, but there was no fever of the chase in
me now, only a heart-sick horror of taking a neighbour's life.</p>

<p>In a choked and shaky voice I hailed them, warning them back;
my voice gave them a start, for I believe they thought me hard
hit.</p>

<p>"Go back, you clowns!" I called. "Shame on you, Toby Tice! Shame
on you, Wraxall! What devil's work is this? Are you turned Huron
then with your knives and hatchets and your Seneca belts? Swing
that canoe, I say! Au large! Au large!&mdash;or, by God, I'll drill
you both with one ball!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Wraxall fired. Through the blue cloud I saw Tice sweep
au large, and I stepped out to the shore and shot a ripping hole
through their canoe as it heeled.</p>

<p>Wraxall was reloading desperately; Tice started to send the canoe
towards me once more, but suddenly catching sight of the leaking
bottom, dropped on his knees and tried to draw the ripped flaps
together.</p>

<p>Behind my tree I tore a cartridge open, rammed in a palmful of
buckshot, primed, and fired, tearing the whole bow out of their
flimsy bark craft. The canoe stood up like a post, stern in the
air, and Wraxall lay floundering, while Tice shrieked and fell
sprawling into the river, head first, like a plunging frog, paddles,
poles, and rifle following.</p>

<p>They were swimming my way now, but I shouted to them to sheer
off, and at rifle point warned them across the river to land where
they might and thank God I had not driven them to the bottom with
an ounce of buck.</p>

<p>I was still watching them to see they landed safely, and had
half turned to take the trail again, when, almost under my feet,
a human hand shot up above the river-bank and seized my ankle,
tripping me flat. The next moment a man leaped up from the shore
where he had been crouching, but as I lay on my back I gave him
a violent kick in the face and rolled over out of reach. Before
I could grasp my rifle, his hatchet flew, pinning one flap of
my hunting-shirt to the ground; and I wrenched the hatchet free
and hurled it back at him, so that the flat of the blade smacked
his face, and he dropped into the water with a scream.</p>

<p>Shaking all over, I rose and lifted my rifle, instinctively repriming.
But the sight of the man in the mud, crawling about, gasping and
blowing bloody bubbles, made me sick, and the next moment I turned
tail and ran like a rabbit.</p>

<p>As I sped down the trail, over my shoulder I saw Walter Butler,
planted out in the shoals of the river, taking steady aim at me,
and I seized a tree and checked my course as his bullet sang past
my face. Then I ran on, setting my teeth and vowing to repay that
shot when my life was my own to risk again.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when I turned once more from the
trail and limped into the forest; and I was now close enough to
exhaustion to feel for the first time in my life a touch of that
desperation which makes a fury out of a cornered creature, be
it panther or mouse.</p>

<p>For I had not been able to shake off pursuit, double and twist
as I might. They were distant, it is true, but they plodded tirelessly,
unerringly. Again and again I saw them on the rocks, on the vast
arid reaches of the mountains, heads down to the trail, jogging
along with horrid patience.</p>

<p>Once I doubled on them so close that I could see one of the band
with his face tied up in a rag, doubtless the fellow who had tasted
of his own toothsome hatchet. Walter Butler I could also distinguish,
ever in the lead, rifle trailing. Only one among the others bore
a rifle. I had certainly upset their canoe to good advantage.
But now I began to repent me that I had not shot them in the water
when I had the chance; for truly I was in a sorry condition to
proceed farther, through forest or on trail; my limbs at times
refused their service, and a twig tripped me when I needs must
leap a log.</p>

<p>I fired my first long shot at them as they were entering a ravine
below me, and I missed, for my hands were unsteady from my labouring
breath. Yet I should have marked a deer where I pleased at that
range.</p>

<p>This shot, however, delayed them, and they now advanced more
slowly and cautiously, alert for another ambush. An hour later
I gave them a second shot. My aim was wavering; my bullet only
made one man duck his head.</p>

<p>I was fighting for time now. If I could keep on until dark I
had no fear for the morrow. To tell the truth, I had no actual
fear then; it seemed so impossible that these Johnstown yokels
really meant to take my life, even if they caught me&mdash;this ass
of a Toby Tice whom I had tipped for holding my stirrup more than
once. And Wraxall, the red-headed barber sot, who had shaved me
in the guard-house! How many times had he snatched off his greasy
cap to me, as he loafed in tavern doors, sweating malt like a
hop-vat!</p>

<p>But the nearness of Walter Butler was a very different affair.
Even when I was but a toddling child at Mistress Molly's knee
the sight of Walter Butler ever sent me fearfully hiding behind
the first apron I could snatch at. Year by year my distrust and
aversion deepened, until I had come to look forward serenely to
that mortal struggle between us which I knew must come. But I
had never expected it to come like this.</p>

<p>As I crept once more into the forest my hatred for this man gave
me new strength, and I staggered on, searching for a vantage coign
where I might take another shot at the grotesque crew. Up and
up I crawled, faintly alarmed at my increasing weakness, for now,
when a vine tripped me, I could scarce make out to rise again.
In vain I whipped and spurred my lagging strength with stinging
memories of all the scores I should wipe out with one clean bullet
through Butler's head; it was nigh useless; I could barely move,
and how was I to shoot with my brier-torn hands shaking so I could
neither hold them still nor close my swollen fingers on the trigger?
I needed rest; an hour would have sufficed to steady the palsy
of exhaustion. If only the night would come quickly! But there
were two hours of daylight yet, two long hours of light in which
to track my every step.</p>

<p>I caught a distant glimpse of them far below me, searching the
ravine and river-bank. How they had been lured off to the river
I know not, but it gave me a brief chance for breath, though not
for a shot; and I rested my face on my rifle-stock and closed
my eyes.</p>

<p>I had been kneeling behind a granite rock in a bare waste of
blueberry-scrub, close to the edge of the woods; and presently
as I attempted to rise I fell down, and began to claw around like
a blind kitten. Stand up I could not, and worst of all, I had
little inclination to attempt it, the bed of rough bushes was
so soothing, and the granite rock invited my heavy head. All over
me a sweet numbness tingled; I tried to think, I strove to rouse.
In vain I heard a sing-song drowsing in my ears: "They will kill
you! They will kill you!" but there was no terror in it. What
would it be, I wondered&mdash;a hatchet?&mdash;a knife at the throat like
the deer's coup-de-grâce? Maybe a blow with a rifle-stock. What
did I care? Sleep was sweet.</p>

<p>Then a quiver swept through me like an icy wind; with a pang
I remembered my mission and the wampum pledges, the boast and
the vow to Sir William. Darkness crowded me down; my head reeled,
yet I rose again to my knees, swaying and clutching at the rock
which I could barely see. All around a thick night seemed to hem
me in; I groped through a chilly void for my rifle; it was gone.
Panic-stricken I staggered up, drenched with dew, and I saw the
moon staring at me over a mountain's ghostly wall.</p>

<p>Slowly I realized that I had slept; that death had passed me
where I lay unconscious in the open moorland. But how far had
death gone?&mdash;and would he not return by moonlight, stealthily,
casting no shadow? Ay, what was that under the tree there, that
shape watching me?&mdash;moving, too,&mdash;a man!</p>

<p>As I shrank back my heel struck my rifle. In an instant I was
down behind the rock to prime with dry powder, but to my horror
I found flint missing, charge drawn, pan raised, and ramrod sticking
helplessly out of the barrel. The shock stunned me for a moment;
then I snatched at knife and hatchet only to find an empty belt
dangling to my ankles.</p>

<p>In the impulse of fury and despair, I crouched flat with clinched
fists, trembling for a spring; and at the same instant a tall
figure rose from the bushes at my elbow, laughing coolly.</p>

<p>"Greeting, friend," he said; "God save our country!"</p>

<p>Speechless and dazed, I turned to face him, but he only leaned
quietly on a long rifle and pinched his chin and chuckled.</p>

<p>"There are some gentlemen yonder looking for you, young man,"
he said. "I sent them south, for somehow I thought you might not
be looking for them."</p>

<p>Weakness had dulled my wits, but I found speech presently to
ask for my knife and hatchet.</p>

<p>He laid his head on one side and contemplated me in mock admiration.</p>

<p>"Now! Now! Let us go slow, friend," he said. "Let us converse
on several subjects before you begin bawling for your playthings.
In the first place your manners need polish. I said to you, 'Greeting,
friend; God save our country!' and you make me no polite reply."</p>

<p>Something in the big fellow's impudence and careless good-humour
struck me as familiar. I had heard that voice before, and under
pleasant circumstances, it seemed to me; somewhere I had seen
him standing as he was standing now, in his stringy buckskins
and his coon-skin cap, with the fluffy tail falling like a queue.</p>

<p>"If you please," I said, weakly, "give me my hatchet and knife
and receive my thanks. Come, my good fellow, you detain me, and
I have far to travel."</p>

<p>"Well, of all impudence!" he sneered. "Wait a bit, my young cock
o' the woods. I don't know you yet, but I mean to ere you go out
strutting o' moonlight nights."</p>

<p>"Will you give me my hatchet?" I asked, sharply, edging towards
him.</p>

<p>Before the words left my lips he snatched my rifle from me and
stepped back, putting the rock between us.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, grimly, "you come into camp and take supper with
me, or I'll knock your head off and drag you in by the heels!"</p>

<p>Aching with fatigue and mortification, I stood there so perfectly
helpless that the great oaf fell a-laughing again, and, with a
shrug of good-humoured contempt, handed me back my rifle as though
I were an infant.</p>

<p>"Don't grind your teeth at me," he chuckled. "Come to the camp,
lad. I mean no harm to you. If I did, there's men yonder who'd
slit your pipes for the pleasure, I warrant."</p>

<p>He took a step up the slope, looked around in the moonlight encouragingly,
then abruptly returned to my side and passed his great arm around
me.</p>

<p>"I'm dog-tired," I said, weakly, making an effort to walk; but
my knees had no strength in them, and I must have fallen except
for his support.</p>

<p>Up, up, up we passed through the foggy moonlight, he almost dragging
me, and my feet a-trail behind. However, when we reached the plateau,
I made out to stumble along with his aid, though I let him relieve
me of my rifle, which he shouldered with his own.</p>

<p>After a minute or two I smelled the camp-fire, but could not
see it. Even in the darkest night a fire amid great trees is not
visible at any considerable distance.</p>

<p>My big companion, striding along beside me, had been constantly
muttering under his breath, and presently I distinguished the
words he was singing:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
&mdash;"One shoe off, one shoe on,<br/>
Diddle diddle dumpling, my son John&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>"I know you," I said, abruptly.</p>

<p>He dropped his song and glanced around at me.</p>

<p>"Oh, you do, eh? Well, I mean to know you, too, so don't worry,
young man."</p>

<p>"I won't," said I, scarcely able to speak.</p>

<p>Presently I saw a single tree in the darkness, all gleaming red,
and in a moment we entered a ruddy ring of light, in the centre
of which great logs burned and crackled in a little sea of whistling
flames.</p>

<p>I was prepared to encounter the other coureur-de-bois, and there
he was, ferret-face peering and sniffing at us as we approached.
However, beyond a grunt, he paid me no attention, and presently
fell to stirring something in a camp-pot which hung from cross-sticks
over a separate bed of coals.</p>

<p>There was a third figure there, seated at the base of a gigantic
pine tree; a little Hebrew man, gathering his knees in his arms
and peeping up at me with watery, red-rimmed eyes; Saul Shemuel!&mdash;though
I was too weary to bother my head as to how he came there. As
I passed him he looked up, but he did not appear to know me, though
he came every spring to Sir William for his peddling license,
and sometimes sold us children gaffs and ferret-muzzles and gilt
chains for pet dogs.</p>

<p>He bade me good-evening in an uncertain voice, and peered up
at me continually; and although I doubted that even Sir William
could have recognized me now, I feared this Jew.</p>

<p>The big man brought me a bowl of broth and spread a blanket for
me close to the blaze. I do not recollect drinking the broth,
but I must have done so, for shortly a delicious warmth enveloped
me within and without, and that is the last I remembered that
night.</p>
