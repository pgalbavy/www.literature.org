<p>I will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in
another place I have written of them at length, and will address
myself only to principalities. In doing so I will keep to the
order indicated above, and discuss how such principalities are
to be ruled and preserved.</p>

<p>I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary
states, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince,
than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the
customs of his ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances
as they arise, for a prince of average powers to maintain himself
in his state, unless he be deprived of it by some extraordinary
and excessive force; and if he should be so deprived of it, whenever
anything sinister happens to the usurper, he will regain it.</p>

<p>We have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could
not have withstood the attacks of the Venetians in ’84, nor those
of Pope Julius in ’10, unless he had been long established in
his dominions. For the hereditary prince has less cause and less
necessity to offend; hence it happens that he will be more loved;
and unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable
to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards
him; and in the antiquity and duration of his rule the memories
and motives that make for change are lost, for one change always
leaves the toothing for another.</p>
