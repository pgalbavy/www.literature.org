<p>Tarzan of the Apes was led directly from the Royal Dome to the quarries
of Veltopismakus, which lie a quarter of a mile from the nearer of
the eight domes which constitute the city. A ninth dome was in course
of construction and it was toward this that the line of burdened
slaves wound from the entrance to the quarry to which the ape-man was
conducted. Just below the surface, in a well-lighted chamber, he was
turned over to the officer in charge of the quarry guard, to whom the
king's instructions concerning him were communicated.
</p>
<p>"Your name?" demanded the officer, opening a large book that lay upon
the table at which he was seated.
</p><p>"He is as dumb as the Zertalacolols," explained the commander of the
escort that had brought him to the quarry. "Therefore he has no name."
</p><p>"We will call him The Giant, then," said the officer, "for as such
has he been known since his capture," and he wrote in his book,
<u>Zuanthrol</u>, with Zoanthrohago as the owner, and Trohanadalmakus as the
city of his origin, and then he turned to one of the warriors lolling
upon a nearby bench. "Take him to the timbering crew in the extension
of tunnel thirteen at the thirty-sixth level and tell the Vental in
charge to give him light work and see that no harm befalls him, for
such are the commands of the thagosto--go! But wait! here is his
number. Fasten it upon his shoulder."
</p><p>The warrior took the circular piece of fabric with black hieroglyphics
stamped upon it and affixed it with a metal clasp to the left shoulder
of Tarzan's green tunic and then, motioning the ape-man to precede him,
quit the chamber.
</p><p>Tarzan now found himself in a short, dark corridor which presently
opened into a wider and lighter one along which innumerable, unladen
slaves were moving in the same direction that his guard now escorted
him. He noticed that the floor of the corridor had a constant downward
gradient and that it turned ever to the right, forming a great spiral
leading downward into the earth. The walls and ceiling were timbered
and the floor paved with flat stones, worn smooth by the millions of
sandaled feet that had passed over them. At sufficiently frequent
intervals candles were set in niches in the left-hand wall, and, also
at regular intervals, other corridors opened out of it. Over each
of these openings were more of the strange hieroglyphics of Minuni.
As Tarzan was to learn later, these designated the levels at which
the tunnels lay and led to circular corridors which surrounded the
main spiral runway. From these circular corridors ran the numerous
horizontal tunnels leading to the workings at each level. Shafts
for ventilation and emergency exit pierced these tunnels at varying
distances, running from the surface to the lowest levels of the quarry.
</p><p>At almost every level a few slaves turned off into these lateral
tunnels which were well lighted, though not quite as brilliantly as
the spiral. Shortly after they had commenced the descent, Tarzan,
accustomed from infancy to keen observation, had taken note of the
numbers of tunnel entrances they passed, but he could only conjecture
at the difference in the depths of the levels into which they opened.
A rough guess placed them at fifteen feet, but before they reached the
thirty-sixth, into which they turned, Tarzan felt that there must be an
error in his calculations, for he was sure that they could not be five
hundred and forty feet below the earth's surface with open flames and
no forced ventilation.
</p><p>The horizontal corridor they now entered after leaving the spiral
curved sharply to the right and then back to the left. Shortly
afterward it crossed a wide, circular corridor in which were both laden
and unladen slaves, beyond which were two lines, those laden with rock
moving back in the direction from which Tarzan had come, while others,
bearing lumber moved in the same direction that he did. With both
lines there were unladen slaves.
</p><p>After traversing the horizontal tunnel for a considerable distance they
came at last upon the working party, and here Tarzan was turned over
to the Vental, a warrior who, in the military organizations of the
Minunians, commands ten men.
</p><p>"So this is the giant!" exclaimed the Vental. "And we are not to work
him too hard." His tone was sneering and disagreeable. "Such a giant!"
he cried. "Why, he is no larger than I and they are afraid to let him
do any work into the bargain. Mark you, he will work here or get the
lash. Kalfastoban permits no sluggards," and the fellow struck his
chest vauntingly.
</p><p>He who had brought Tarzan appeared disgusted. "You will do well,
Kalfastoban," he said, as he turned away to retrace his steps to the
guard-room, "to heed the king's commands. I should hate to be wearing
your harness if aught befell this speechless slave that has set every
tongue in Veltopismakus going and made Elkomoelhago so jealous of
Zoanthrohago that he would slip steel between his ribs were it not that
he could then no longer steal the great wizard's applause."
</p><p>"Kalfastoban fears no king," blustered the Vental, "least of all the
sorry specimen that befouls the throne of Veltopishago. He fools no
one but himself. We all know that Zoanthrohago is his brain and Gefasto
his sword."
</p><p>"However," warned the other, "be careful of Zuanthrol," and he departed.
</p><p>Kalfastoban Vental set the new slave to work upon the timbering of
the tunnel as it was excavated from the great moraine that formed the
quarry, the line of slaves coming from the surface empty handed passed
down one side of the tunnel to the end, loosened each a rock, or if
heavy a rock to two men, and turned back up the tunnel's opposite side,
carrying their burdens back to the spiral runway used by those leaving
the workings and so up and out to the new dome. The earth, a light
clay, that filled the interstices between the rocks in the moraine
was tamped into the opening behind the wall timbers, the tunnel being
purposely made sufficiently large to permit of this. Certain slaves
were detailed for this work, others carried timbers cut to the right
dimensions down to the timbering crew, of which Tarzan was one. It
was only necessary for this crew of three to scoop a narrow, shallow
trench in which to place the foot of each wall board, set them in place
and slip the ceiling board on top of them. At each end of the ceiling
boards was a cleat, previously attached at the surface, which kept the
wall boards from falling in after being set in place. The dirt tamped
behind them fastened them solidly in their places, the whole making a
quickly erected and substantial shoring.
</p><p>The work was light for the ape-man, though he still was weak from the
effects of his wounds, and he had opportunities constantly to observe
all that went on around him and to gather new information relative to
the people in whose power he found himself. Kalfastoban he soon set
down as a loud-mouthed braggart, from whom one need have nothing to
fear during the routine of their everyday work, but who would bear
watching if ever opportunity came for him to make a show of authority
or physical prowess before the eyes of his superiors.
</p><p>The slaves about him worked steadily, but seemed not to be overtaxed,
while the guards, which accompanied them constantly, in the ratio
of about one warrior to every fifty slaves, gave no indications of
brutality in the treatment they accorded their charges, insofar as
Tarzan was able to observe.
</p><p>The fact that puzzled him most now as it had since the moment of his
first return to consciousness, was the stature of these people. They
were no pygmies, but men fully as large as the usual run of Europeans.
There was none quite as tall as the ape-man, but there were many who
missed it by but the scantiest fraction of an inch. He knew that they
were Veltopismakusians, the same people he had seen battling with the
Trohanadalmakusians; they spoke of having captured him in the battle
that he had seen waged; and they called him Zuanthrol, The Giant, yet
they were as large as he, and as he had passed from the Royal Dome to
the quarry he had seen their gigantic dome dwellings rising fully four
hundred feet above his head. It was all preposterous and impossible,
yet he had the testimony of all his faculties that it was true.
Contemplation of it but tended to confuse him more and so he gave over
all attempts to solve the mystery and set himself to the gathering of
information concerning his captors and his prison against that time
which he well knew must some day come when the means of escape should
offer itself to the alert and cunning instincts of the wild beast that,
at heart, he always considered himself.
</p><p>Wherever he had been in Veltopismakus, whoever he had heard refer to
the subject, he had had it borne in upon him that the people were
generally dissatisfied with their king and his government, and he
knew that among a discontented people efficiency would be at low ebb
and discipline demoralized to such an extent that, should he watch
carefully, he must eventually discover the opportunity he sought,
through the laxity of those responsible for his safe-keeping. He did
not expect it today or tomorrow, but today and tomorrow were the days
upon which to lay the foundation of observation that would eventually
reveal an avenue of escape.
</p><p>When the long working day at last drew to a close the slaves were
conducted to their quarters, which, as Tarzan discovered, were always
on levels near to those in which they labored. He, with several other
slaves, was conducted to the thirty-fifth level and into a tunnel
the far end of which had been widened to the proportions of a large
chamber, the narrow entrance to which had been walled up with stone
except for a small aperture through which the slaves were forced to
pass in and out of their chamber upon all fours, and when the last of
them was within, this was closed and secured by a heavy door outside
which two warriors watched throughout the night.
</p><p>Once inside and standing upon his feet the ape-man looked about him
to discover himself within a chamber so large that it seemed easy to
accommodate the great throng of slaves that must have numbered fully
five thousand souls of both sexes. The women were preparing food over
small fires the smoke of which found its way from the chamber through
openings in the ceiling. For the great number of fires the amount of
smoke was noticeably little, a fact which was, however, accounted
for by the nature of the fuel, a clean, hard charcoal; but why the
liberated gases did not asphyxiate them all was quite beyond the
ape-man, as was still the riddle of the open flames and the pure air at
the depth where the workings lay. Candles burned in niches all about
the walls and there were at least half-a-dozen large ones standing
upon the floor.
</p><p>The slaves were of all ages from infancy to middle-age, but there were
no aged venerables among them. The skins of the women and children
were the whitest Tarzan had ever seen and he marveled at them until he
came to know that some of the former and all of the latter had never
seen daylight since birth. The children who were born here would go up
into the daylight some time, when they were of an age that warranted
beginning the training for the vocations their masters had chosen for
them, but the women who had been captured from other cities would
remain here until death claimed them, unless that rarest of miracles
occurred--they should be chosen by a Veltopismakusian warrior as his
mate; but that was scarce even a remote possibility, since the warriors
almost invariably chose their mates from the slaves of the white tunic
with whom they came in daily contact in the domes above-ground.
</p><p>The faces of the women bore the imprint of a sadness that brought a
spontaneous surge of sympathy to the breast of the savage ape-man.
Never in his life had he seen such abject hopelessness depicted upon
any face.
</p><p>As he crossed the room many were the glances that were cast upon him,
for it was obvious from his deep tan that he was a newcomer, and,
too, there was that about him that marked him of different clay from
them, and soon there were whispers running through the throng, for the
slaves who had entered with him had passed the word of his identity to
the others, and who, even in the bowels of the earth, had not heard of
the wondrous giant captured by Zoanthrohago during the battle with the
Trohanadalmakusians?
</p><p>Presently a young girl, kneeling above a brazier over which she was
grilling a cut of flesh, caught his eye and motioned him to her. As he
came he saw that she was very beautiful, with a pale, translucent skin
the whiteness of which was accentuated by the blue-black of a wealth of
lustrous hair.
</p><p>"You are the giant?" she asked.
</p><p>"I am Zuanthrol," he replied.
</p><p>"He has told me about you," said the girl. "I will cook for you, too. I
cook for him. Unless," she added with a trace of embarrassment, "there
is another you would rather have cook for you."
</p><p>"There is no one I would rather have cook for me," Tarzan told her;
"but who are you and who is <u>he</u>?"
</p><p>"I am Talaskar," she replied; "but I know him only by his number. He
says that while he remains a slave he has no name, but will go always
by his number, which is Eight Hundred Cubed, Plus Nineteen. I see that
you are Eight Hundred Cubed, Plus Twenty-one." She was looking at the
hieroglyphics that had been fastened upon his shoulder. "Have you a
name?"
</p><p>"They call me Zuanthrol."
</p><p>"Ah," she said, "you are a large man, but I should scarcely call you a
giant. He, too, is from Trohanadalmakus and he is about your height. I
never heard that there were any giants in Minuni except the people they
call Zertalacolols."
</p><p>"I thought you were a Zertalacolol," said a man's voice at Tarzan's ear.
</p><p>The ape-man turned to see one of the slaves with whom he had been
working eyeing him quizzically, and smiled.
</p><p>"I am a Zertalacolol to my masters," he replied.
</p><p>The other raised his brows. "I see," he said. "Perhaps you are wise. I
shall not be the one to betray you," and passed on about his business.
</p><p>"What did he mean?" asked the girl.
</p><p>"I have never spoken, until now, since they took me prisoner," he
explained, "and they think I am speechless, though I am sure that I do
not look like a Zertalacolol, yet some of them insist that I am one."
</p><p>"I have never seen one," said the girl.
</p><p>"You are fortunate," Tarzan told her. "They are neither pleasant to see
nor to meet."
</p><p>"But I should like to see them," she insisted. "I should like to see
anything that was different from these slaves whom I see all day and
every day."
</p><p>"Do not lose hope," he encouraged her, "for who knows but that it may
be very soon that you will return to the surface."
</p><p>"'Return'," she repeated. "I have never been there."
</p><p>"Never been to the surface! You mean since you were captured."
</p><p>"I was born in this chamber," she told him, "and never have I been out
of it."
</p><p>"You are a slave of the second generation and are still confined to the
quarries--I do not understand it. In all Minunian cities, I have been
told, slaves of the second generation are given the white tunic and
comparative freedom above ground."
</p><p>"It was not for me. My mother would not permit it. She would rather I
had died than mated with a Veltopismakusian or another slave, as I must
do if I go into the city above."
</p><p>"But how do you avoid it? Your masters certainly do not leave such
things to the discretion of their slaves."
</p><p>"Where there are so many one or two may go unaccounted for
indefinitely, and women, if they be ill-favored, cause no comment
upon the part of our masters. My birth was never reported and so they
have no record of me. My mother took a number for me from the tunic
of one who died, and in this way I attract no attention upon the few
occasions that our masters or the warriors enter our chamber."
</p><p>"But you are not ill-favored--your face would surely attract attention
anywhere," Tarzan reminded her.
</p><p>For just an instant she turned her back upon him, putting her hands to
her face and to her hair, and then she faced him again and the ape-man
saw before him a hideous and wrinkled hag upon whose crooked features
no man would look a second time.
</p><p>"God!" ejaculated Tarzan.
</p><p>Slowly the girl's face relaxed, assuming its normal lines of beauty,
and with quick, deft touches she arranged her disheveled hair. An
expression that was almost a smile haunted her lips.
</p><p>"My mother taught me this," she said, "so that when they came and
looked upon me they would not want me."
</p><p>"But would it not be better to be mated with one of them and live a
life of comfort above ground than to eke out a terrible existence below
ground?" he demanded. "The warriors of Veltopismakus are, doubtless,
but little different from those of your own country."
</p><p>She shook her head. "It cannot be, for me," she said. "My father is
of far Mandalamakus. My mother was stolen from him but a couple of
moons before I was born in this horrid chamber, far from the air and
sunlight that my mother never tired of telling me about.
</p><p>"And your mother?" asked Tarzan. "Is she here?"
</p><p>The girl shook her head sadly. "They came for her over twenty moons
since and took her away. I do not know what became of her."
</p><p>"And these others, they never betray you?" he inquired.
</p><p>"Never! Whatever slave betrayed another would be torn to pieces by his
fellows. But come, you must be hungry," and she offered him of the
flesh she had been cooking.
</p><p>Tarzan would have preferred his meat raw, but he did not wish to offend
her and so he thanked her and ate that which she offered him, squatting
on his haunches across the brazier from her.
</p><p>"It is strange that Aoponato does not come," she remarked, using the
Minunian form of Eight Hundred Cubed, Plus Nineteen. "Never before has
he been so late."
</p><p>A brawny slave, who had approached from behind her, had halted and was
looking scowlingly at Tarzan.
</p><p>"Perhaps this is he," said Tarzan to the girl, indicating the man with
a gesture.
</p><p>Talaskar turned quickly, an almost happy light in her eyes, but when
she saw who it was that stood behind her she rose quickly and stepped
back, her expression altered to one of disgust.
</p><p>"No," she said, "it is not he."
</p><p>"You are cooking for him?" demanded the fellow, pointing at Tarzan.
"But you would not cook for me," he accused, not waiting for a reply to
his question, the answer to which was all too obvious. "Who is he that
you should cook for him? Is he better than I? You will cook for me,
also."
</p><p>"There are plenty to cook for you, Caraftap," replied Talaskar, "and I
do not wish to. Go to some other woman. Until there are too many men we
are permitted to choose those whom we shall cook for. I do not choose
to cook for you."
</p><p>"If you know what is well for you, you will cook for me," growled the
man. "You will be my mate, too. I have a right to you, because I have
asked you many times before these others came. Rather than let them
have you I will tell the vental tomorrow the truth about you and he
will take you away. Have you ever seen Kalfastoban?"
</p><p>The girl shuddered.
</p><p>"I will see that Kalfastoban gets you," continued Caraftap. "They will
not permit you to remain here when they find that you refuse to produce
more slaves."
</p><p>"I should prefer Kalfastoban to you," sneered the girl, "but neither
one nor the other shall have me."
</p><p>"Do not be too sure of that," he cried, and stepping forward, quickly,
seized her by the arm before she could elude him. Dragging her toward
him the man attempted to kiss her--but he did not succeed. Steel
fingers closed upon his shoulder, he was torn roughly from his prey and
hurled ruthlessly a dozen paces, stumbling and falling to the floor.
Between him and the girl stood the gray-eyed stranger with the shock of
black hair.
</p><p>Almost roaring in his rage, Caraftap scrambled to his feet and charged
Tarzan--charged as a mad bull charges, with lowered head and bloodshot
eyes.
</p><p>"For this you shall die," he screamed.
