<p>Elwood fell about twenty feet, striking the solid earth, without
losing his own perpendicular position. He was considerably pained,
but not seriously hurt. His rifle had fallen from his hand, and
was not found again until daybreak, as not knowing where he stood,
whether upon the edge of some precipice or ravine, he scarcely
dared move a limb.</p>

<p>Ah! if the night was so weary to the watchers by the river shore,
it was much more so to him for whom they thus lay awake. Utter
midnight blackness all around, the profound and impressive stillness
made more profound and impressive by the trickling of some current
near, the occasional glimpse of some tiny star twinkling among
the dark, straggling clouds overhead; such was Elwood Brandon's
situation and surroundings.</p>

<p>His only resource was thought, and the direction which this took
for a time was anything but a relief. He saw that he himself was
to blame for the disaster of the day. It was he who proposed this
ramble, and he who insisted so strenuously upon separating from
Howard in the journey around the hills. And then his present situation
resulted wholly from his own foolishness&mdash;to call it no milder
term&mdash;in entering an unknown path with the simple hope of reaching
a designated point a few minutes in advance of his friend, whom
he knew well enough had carried out to the letter their agreement,
and was waiting his coming.</p>

<p>Had Howard found Tim O'Rooney? That was the next question. Or
was he still lingering on the other side of the hills, waiting
for the morning to renew his hunt for himself before he sought
out his companion? The latter seemed the most probable supposition
to Elwood, and the odd whim took him that his cousin was close
at hand and listening for the familiar signal. So he placed his
fingers to his mouth and repeated the whistle which they had used
so many times between them.</p>

<p>He did this again and again, but there was no response, and he
finally concluded that it was rather a monotonous manner of passing
the time and ceased, and again gave himself up to thought.</p>

<p>If he ever lived to see his friends at home what an experience
would be his to tell! The burning steamer, the hours spent in
drifting ashore, the wanderings through the wilds of California,
this adventure among the hills&mdash;surely they were enough to last
a life-time.</p>

<p>Now and then a cold draft of wind swept by him, as though the
temperature of the air was changing. It was in fact the premonition
of the gathering storm to which we have referred in another place.</p>

<p>Elwood had been in his constrained position a couple of hours
when he was subjected to a terrible fright. Suddenly some dirt
and stones commenced moving near him and he felt it strike his
feet. He was fearful that a landslide was about to take place,
but did not dare attempt to get out of the way. He could only
shrink closer against the rocks, pray to Heaven for protection,
and await the issue.</p>

<p>The pebbles rattled around him for a long time, and when they
had nearly ceased he learned that the whole tumult was caused
by some wild animal. This dissipated all fear of being engulfed
by a landslide, but scarcely relieved him. It was simply a change
of species in the danger.</p>

<p>He could hear the footsteps of the animal as it walked back and
forth. They sounded above his head, but he could not judge with
certainty. Several times it gave a low growl, from which he was
sure that it was dangerous, and if it knew of his presence and
could reach him would speedily end his reckless conduct forever.</p>

<p>The animal was still for a while and the boy was indulging in
the belief that it had gone, when he heard its footsteps so near
that his hair fairly rose with terror. He stooped down and felt
around in the darkness for his gun, but it was not within reach.
He caught a huge stone and held it in reserve for defense.</p>

<p>Straining his eyes through the darkness, he fancied he could
see a dark object above him; but it was only fancy, for to his
excited imagination the most extraordinary phantoms were flitting
before him&mdash;floating in the air, around and above him, like the
wonderful visions that visit us in delirium&mdash;until he closed his
eyes to shut out the tormenting figures.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, the presence of the wild animal was the means
of saving him, for it kept his mind down to the hard, practical
fact that imminent danger was close at hand, and all his thoughts
were needed to meet it. He stood a long time grasping the stone
and expecting the assault; but the tumult finally ceased and all
became still.</p>

<p>When Elwood looked up again he saw that it was growing light,
and day was indeed breaking.</p>
