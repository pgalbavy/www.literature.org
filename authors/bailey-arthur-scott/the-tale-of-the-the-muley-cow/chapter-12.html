<p>Some of the Muley Cow's friends were very sorry for her, when Farmer
Green put the poke around her neck to keep her from jumping the pasture
fence. It was a heavy, clumsy thing to carry about all day. Sometimes,
if she was not careful, the Muley Cow knocked her knees against it.
</p>
<p>Of course, there were others in the herd, like the little red cow and
the big white one, that made disagreeable remarks. When they said unkind
things to her the Muley Cow pretended that the poke didn't trouble her.
</p><p>"Don't you know," she said to them one day, "that it's an honor to wear
a poke? It shows that I'm the most valuable animal in the herd. Farmer
Green doesn't intend to lose me, if he can help it."
</p><p>"Nonsense!" the little red cow cried. "Farmer Green makes you wear the
poke because he doesn't want you to teach the young cattle bad habits.
If he hadn't stopped you from jumping you'd soon have had all the
youngsters at it."
</p><p>It was now the Muley Cow's turn to cry, "Nonsense!" But somehow she
couldn't quite say the word. She had a queer, guilty feeling. And she
walked away looking quite glum. She didn't want to talk with anybody.
</p><p>After her there followed a small flock of cowbirds.
</p><p>"We aren't intruding, I hope," one plump cowbird remarked with a smirk
as he settled himself near the Muley Cow's forelegs, when she stopped
to graze.
</p><p>"You can always count on us as being good friends of yours," a dull gray
dame told the Muley Cow.
</p><p>"When you're feeling sad you can depend on us to cheer you up," a
glossy, greenish black gentleman chimed in with a chuckle.
</p><p>The Muley Cow couldn't help thinking how pleasant it was to be among
such kind companions.
</p><p>"If you'll take care not to step on us we'll catch these flies that are
biting you," another offered.
</p><p>"Thank you!" said the Muley Cow. "You're very good to do that for an old
lady like me."
</p><p>The cowbirds all laughed harshly at that. Though the Muley Cow didn't
see any joke, she smiled in spite of herself. At least, the cowbirds
had said nothing about her poke. And that was certainly worth a smile.
</p><p>In the past the Muley Cow had known plenty of cowbirds. But she had paid
little heed to them, unless it was to tell them to fly away, for they
were always hovering around a body's feet.
</p><p>It wasn't long before the flock had caught every one of the flies that
had been following the Muley Cow. And when the last one had been gobbled
up--after a slight dispute as to who should have it--the cowbirds left
the Muley Cow abruptly. And they seemed to have lost all their
politeness before they went.
</p><p>"They're shy--that's all," the Muley Cow thought. "They hurried away
before I could thank them."
