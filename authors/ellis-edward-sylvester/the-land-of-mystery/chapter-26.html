<p>Never had Ziffak shown such fearful excitement.  He swung his
arms, and in his wild agitation uttered some of his words in Murhapa,
but his meaning was caught by Ashman, who was infected by his
overwhelming emotion.  He was distraught for the moment, and stood
undecided what to do.</p>

<p>It was the lovely Ariel who showed the most self-command.</p>

<p>"Whither shall we go, Ziffak?" she asked in English.</p>

<p>"To the enchanted lake; to the burning mountain!  You know the
way! Nothing else will save you, and you are lost if you wait
another minute!"</p>

<p>And laying hands on the young man, he whirled him about and gave
him a shove which nearly threw him off his feet.  Then he reached
to catch her, but she eluded him and slipped like a bird to the
side of her lover.</p>

<p>"We will go!" said she; "leave us alone!"</p>

<p>Ashman turned his head and seizing the hand of his companion,
said,</p>

<p>"You are my guide now!  Lead on, and I will follow you to the
death!"</p>

<p>She made no answer, but moved rapidly through the wood until
they came to the open space along the river.  Here, since there
were no obstructions, they increased their pace almost to a run. 
He sought to maintain his place beside her, but she moved so fast,
with little apparent effort that it was hard to do so.</p>

<p>He had his Winchester and revolver, and he glanced behind to
learn whether they were followed.  Ziffak had vanished, and no
one was in sight.  It was well that such was the fact; for he
would not have hesitated to shoot down any that might appear.</p>

<p>The extraordinary flight continued for a furlong, and then Ariel
paused on the edge of the Xingu.  Her lover saw the reason: a
small canoe lay against the shore.</p>

<p>"Is this to be used?" he asked, glancing in her pale face.</p>

<p>She nodded her head, and, lifting her skirts, stepped daintily
within, and sat down near the stern.  He shoved the boat clear,
sprang in and sat down near the middle, as he seized the broad
thin paddle.</p>

<p>Although considerably above the rapids, which had been the cause
of all his difficulty, Ashman noticed that the current was not
so swift as that encountered at many places leagues below; and,
since the width was no greater, it followed that that portion
of the Upper Xingu was of unusual depth.</p>

<p>In the strange excitement of the occasion, the lovers spoke few
words. They had said much, and, when the opportunity should again
come, they would say a great deal more; but they were fleeing
for their lives, and any distraction of their whole interest and
effort was likely to be fatal.</p>

<p>Ariel realized this as fully as did Ashman.  She continually
glanced in every direction, especially toward the village which
was fast receding behind them.  Fred swung the paddle powerfully,
but with as little noise as possible.</p>

<p>In such crises of a man's life he thinks rapidly.  While the
young man's heart was aglow with the ecstacy of a promised fulfillment
of his love&mdash;a more glorious fulfillment than he had dared to
dream of&mdash;he saw that a desperate struggle was not only certain
but close at hand.</p>

<p>Very soon the flight of Ariel must be discovered, and her infuriated
father would stop at nothing to punish the elopers.  He could
command hundreds of the most valiant warriors of the Matto Grosso,
and any one, except such a lover as Fred Ashman, would have shrunk
from the prodigious task before him.</p>

<p>When the flight of the canoe had continued for several minutes,
and he could breathe a little more freely, he asked of his companion,
whether she was familiar with the region they expected to visit.</p>

<p>The reply was singular.  King Haffgo was accustomed to make regular
excursions to the wonderful place, and he rarely did so without
Ariel as his companion.  He had guards stationed night and day
to watch for the approach of strangers, for there was wealth enough
to awaken the avarice even of the Emperor of Brazil himself.</p>

<p>Leaving his warriors at the entrance to the lake, with instructions
to prevent any one following him, Haffgo would paddle the frail
craft out upon the lake, with his daughter as his only companion.</p>

<p>They explored much of the strange locality, visiting places unknown,
so far as they were aware, to every one else.</p>

<p>Ashman reflected that this was extremely fortunate so far as
Ariel was concerned, for it gave her the very knowledge that was
so necessary in their flight; but, unfortunately, their bitterest
and most unrelenting enemy possessed the same knowledge.</p>

<p>Now the Xingu broadened, and the flow became still more moderate.
Ashman held his paddle suspended and looked around.</p>

<p>"Are we entering the lake?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," she replied with a shake of her lovely head.</p>

<p>The oar was dipped again, and the light boat shot forward like
a water fowl over the smooth surface.</p>

<p>He had noticed that the boat was similar to that used by Ziffak,
being composed of a species of bark, the seams of which were skilfully
joined with tendons, and the outside covered with a gum which
rendered it close enough to exclude even air itself.</p>

<p>What seemed to be a creek a hundred feet wide, suddenly opened
on the right, winding through an exuberant forest whose branches
overhung the water.  She motioned with her hand for him to guide
the boat into this, adding that it was the entrance to the enchanted
lake of which he had heard such glowing accounts, and whose existence,
he remembered, had been denied by Ziffak, though it had been admitted
by him only a brief while before.</p>

<p>The course of the canoe was changed, and Ashman involuntarily
slackened the pace, while he gazed around with increasing wonder.</p>

<p>The distance was not far, when a towering rock was observed jutting
out from the bank.  It was fully twenty feet high, rough, jagged
and massive and obtruded half-way across the stream.</p>

<p>She whispered to him to proceed as cautiously as he could, for
on the rock was stationed one of the lookouts of King Haffgo,
whose duty it was to challenge every one on his way to the enchanted
lake.  Ashman was told to keep his lips mute, in case they were
hailed, as they were likely to be, and to leave to her any explanation
it might be necessary to make.</p>

<p>In the bright moonlight, the sentinel was sure to notice the
presence of a white man in the boat, but would be likely to believe
he was either Waggaman or Burkhardt, while he would not dare to
question the daughter of the king, however much he might be astonished
at her presence at this time.</p>

<p>Ashman saw the figure of a Murhapa, but instead of being erect,
he was seated on a ledge of the rock, his body half prone and
in a motionless posture.  The paddle was dipped more softly than
ever as the craft came opposite him, but he did not speak, or
stir.</p>

<p>"He's asleep?" whispered Ashman, looking inquiringly at her.</p>

<p>She nodded her head, and he did not require to be told of the
great gain that would be secured, if they could pass without awaking
him.</p>

<p>With that view, he used the utmost care, causing only the faintest
ripple, as he propelled the light craft over the mirror-like surface.</p>

<p>In a few seconds, the massive rock was passed, and still the
sentinel remained as motionless, as if he were a part of the solid
stone, on which he was seated.  He surely was a negligent servant
to lose his consciousness thus early in the night.</p>

<p>A few more strokes, and a turn in the creek left him out of sight.
<em>That</em> danger was safely passed, and Fred Ashman drew a
sigh of relief, accepting it as a good omen of their future.</p>

<p>He now dipped the paddle deeper, and, within the following five
minutes, the canoe and its occupants debouched upon the waters
of the wonderful enchanted lake.</p>
