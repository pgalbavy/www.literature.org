<P>
It was late summer-time, and the perfume of flowers stole into the
darkened room through the half-opened window.   The sunlight forced
its way through a chink in the blind, and stretched across the floor
in strange zigzag fashion.  From without came the pleasant murmur
of bees and many lazier insects floating over the gorgeous flower
beds, resting for a while on the clematis which had made the piazza
a blaze of purple splendour.  And inside, in a high-backed chair,
there sat a man, his arms folded, his eyes fixed steadily upon
vacancy.  As he sat then, so had he sat for a whole day and a whole
night.  The faint sweet chorus of glad living things, which alone
broke the deep silence of the house, seemed neither to disturb nor
interest him.  He sat there like a man turned to stone, his
forehead riven by one deep line, his straight firm mouth set close
and hard.  His servant, the only living being who had approached
him, had set food by his side, which now and then he had
mechanically taken.  Changeless as a sphinx, he had sat there in
darkness and in light, whilst sunlight had changed to moonlight,
and the songs of the birds had given place to the low murmuring
of frogs from a lake below the lawns.
<P>
At last it seemed that his unnatural fit had passed away.  He
stretched out his hand and struck a silver gong which had been left
within his reach.  Almost immediately a man, pale-faced, with full
dark eyes and olive complexion, dressed in the sombre garb of an
indoor servant, stood at his elbow.
<P>
"Duson."
<P>
"Your Grace!"
<P>
"Bring wine-Burgundy."
<P>
It was before him, served with almost incredible despatch - a small
cobwebbed bottle and a glass of quaint shape, on which were
beautifully emblazoned a coronet and fleur-de-lis.  He drank slowly
and deliberately.  When he set the glass down it was empty.
<P>
"Duson!"
<P>
"Your Grace!"
<P>
"You will pack my things and your own.  We shall leave for New York
this evening.  Telegraph to the Holland House for rooms."
<P>
"For how many days, your Grace?"
<P>
"We shall not return here.  Pay off all the servants save two of
the most trustworthy, who will remain as caretakers."
<P>
The man's face was as immovable as his master's.
<P>
"And Madame?"
<P>
"Madame will not be returning.  She will have no further use for
her maid.  See, however, that her clothes and all her personal
belongings remain absolutely undisturbed."
<P>
"Has your Grace any further orders?"
<P>
"Take pencil and paper.  Send this cablegram. Are you ready?"
<P>
The man's head moved in respectful assent.
<P>
     "To Felix,
       "No 27, Rue de St.  Pierre,
         "Avenue de L'Opera, Paris.
"Meet me at Sherry's Restaurant, New York, one month to-day, eleven
p.m. - V.  S."
<P>
"It shall be sent immediately, your Grace.  The train for New York
leaves at seven-ten.  A carriage will be here in one hour and five
minutes."
<P>
The man moved towards the door.  His master looked up.
<P>
"Duson!"
<P>
"Your Grace!"
<P>
"The Duc de Souspennier remains here - or at the bottom of the
lake - what matters!   It is Mr. Sabin who travels to New York,
and for whom you engage rooms at the Holland House.  Mr. Sabin is
a cosmopolitan of English proclivities."
<P>
"Very good, sir!"
<P>
"Lock this door.  Bring my coat and hat five minutes before the
carriage starts.  Let the servants be well paid.  Let none of them
attempt to see me."
<P>
The man bowed and disappeared.  Left to himself, Mr. Sabin rose from
his chair, and pushing open the windows, stood upon the verandah.
He leaned heavily upon his stick with both hands, holding it before
him.  Slowly his eyes traveled over the landscape.
<P>
It was a very beautiful home which he was leaving.  Before him
stretched the gardens - Italian in design, brilliant with flowers,
with here and there a dark cedar-tree drooping low upon the lawn.
A yew hedge bordered the rose-garden, a fountain was playing in
the middle of a lake.  A wooden fence encircled the grounds, and
beyond was a smooth rolling park, with little belts of pine
plantations and a few larger trees here and there.  In the far
distance the red flag was waving on one of the putting greens.
Archie Green was strolling up the hillside, - his pipe in his mouth,
and his driver under his arm.  Mr. Sabin watched, and the lines in
his face grew deeper and deeper.
  
"I am an old man," he said softly, "but I will live to see them
suffer who have done this evil thing." 
<P>
He turned slowly back into the room, and limping rather more than
was usual with him, he pushed aside a portiere and passed into a
charmingly furnished country drawing-room.  Only the flowers hung
dead in their vases; everything else was fresh and sweet and dainty.
Slowly he threaded his way amongst the elegant Louis Quinze
furniture, examining as though for the first time the beautiful old
tapestry, the Sevres china, the Chippendale table, which was
priceless, the exquisite portraits painted by Greuze, and the
mysterious green twilights and grey dawns of Corot.  Everywhere
treasures of art, yet everywhere the restraining hand of the artist.
The faint smell of dead rose leaves hung about the room.  Already
one seemed conscious of a certain emptiness as though the genius of
the place had gone.  Mr. Sabin leaned heavily upon his stick, and
his head drooped lower and lower.    A soft, respectful voice came
to him from the other room.
<P>
"In five minutes, sir, the carriage will be at the door.  I have
your coat and hat here."
<P>
Mr. Sabin looked up.
<P>
"I am quite ready, Duson!" he said.
<P>
      *           *           *           *           *
<P>
The servants in the hall stood respectfully aside to let him pass.
On the way to the depot he saw nothing of those who saluted him.
In the car he sat with folded arms in the most retired seat, looking
steadfastly out of the window at the dying day.  There were
mountains away westwards, touched with golden light; sometimes for
long minutes together the train was rushing through forests whose
darkness was like that of a tunnel.  Mr. Sabin seemed indifferent
to these changes.  The coming of night did not disturb him.  His
brain was at work, and the things which he saw were hidden from
other men.
<P>
Duson, with a murmur of apology, broke in upon his meditations.
<P>
"You will pardon me, sir, but the second dinner is now being served.
The restaurant car will be detached at the next stop."
<P>
"What of it?" Mr. Sabin asked calmly.
<P>
"I have taken the liberty of ordering dinner for you, sir.  It is
thirty hours since you ate anything save biscuits."
<P>
Mr. Sabin rose to his feet.
<P>
"You are quite right, Duson," he said.  "I will dine."
<P>
In half-an-hour he was back again.  Duson placed before him silently
a box of cigarettes and matches.  Mr. Sabin smoked.
<P>
Soon the lights of the great city flared in the sky, the train
stopped more frequently, the express men and newspaper boys came
into evidence.  Mr. Sabin awoke from his long spell of thought.  He
bought a newspaper, and glanced through the list of steamers which
had sailed during the week.  When the train glided into the depot
he was on his feet and ready to leave it.
<P>
"You will reserve our rooms, Duson, for one month," he said on the
way to the hotel.  We shall probably leave for Europe a month
to-morrow."
<P>
"Very good, sir."
<P>
"You were Mrs. Peterson's servant, Duson, before you were mine!"
<P>
"Yes, sir."
<P>
"You have been with her, I believe, for many years.  You are
doubtless much attached to her!"
<P>
"Indeed I am, sir!"
<P>
"You may have surmised, Duson, that she has left me.  I desire to
ensure your absolute fidelity, so I take you into my confidence to
this extent.  Your mistress is in the hands of those who have some
power over her.  Her absence is involuntary so far as she is
concerned.  It has been a great blow to me.  I am prepared to
run all risks to discover her whereabouts.  It is late in my life
for adventures, but it is very certain that adventures and dangers
are before us.  In accompanying me you will associate yourself with
many risks.  Therefore - "
<P>
Duson held up his hand.
<P>
"I beg, sir," he exclaimed, "that you will not suggest for a moment
my leaving your service on that account.  I beg most humbly, sir,
that you will not do me that injustice."
<P>
Mr. Sabin paused.  His eyes, like lightning, read the other's face.
<P>
"It is settled then, Duson," he said.  "Kindly pay this cabman, and
follow me as quickly as possible."
<P>
Mr. Sabin passed across the marble hall, leaning heavily upon his
stick.  Yet for all his slow movements there was a new alertness
in his eyes and bearing.  He was once more taking keen note of
everybody and everything about him.  Only a few days ago she had
been here.
<P>
He claimed his rooms at the office, and handed the keys to Duson,
who by this time had rejoined him.  At the moment of turning away
he addressed an inquiry to the clerk behind the counter.
<P>
"Can you tell me if the Duchess of Souspennier is staying here?"
he inquired.
<P>
The young man glanced up.
<P>
"Been here, I guess.  Left on Tuesday."
<P>
Mr. Sabin turned away.  He did not speak again until Duson and he
were alone in the sitting-room.  Then he drew out a five dollar bill.
<P>
"Duson," he said, "take this to the head luggage porter.  Tell him
to bring his departure book up here at once, and there is another
waiting for him.  You understand?"
<P>
"Certainly, sir!"
<P>
Mr. Sabin turned to enter his bed-chamber.  His attention was
attracted, however, by a letter lying flat upon the table.  He took
it up.  It was addressed to Mr. Sabin.
<P>
"This is very clever," he mused, hesitating for a moment before
opening it.  "I wired for rooms only a few hours ago - and I find
a letter.  It is the commencement."
<P>
He tore open the envelope, and drew out a single half-sheet of
note-paper.  Across it was scrawled a single sentence only.
<P>
"Go back to Lenox."
<P>
There was no signature, nor any date.  The only noticeable thing
about this brief communication was that it was written in yellow
pencil of a peculiar shade.  Mr. Sabin's eyes glittered as he read.
<P>
"The yellow crayon!" he muttered.
<P>
Duson knocked softly at the door.  Mr. Sabin thrust the letter and
envelope into his breast coat pocket.
