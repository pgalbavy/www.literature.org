<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Siward, at his desk, over which the May sunshine streamed, his
crutches laid against his chair, sat poring over the piles of
papers left there by Beverly Plank some days before with a curt
recommendation that he master their contents.</p>

<p>Some of the papers were typewritten, some appeared to be engraved
certificates of stock, a few were in Plank's heavy, squat handwriting.
There were several packages tied in pink tape, evidently legal
papers of some sort; and also a pile of scrap-books containing
newspaper clippings to which Siward referred occasionally, or
read them at length, resting his thin, fatigued face between two
bony hands.</p>

<p>The curious persistence of youth in his features seemed unaccountable
in view of the heavy marks imprinted there; but they were marks,
not lines; bluish hollows under eyes still young, marred contours
of the cheek-bone; a hardness about the hollow temples above which
his short, bright hair clustered with all its soft, youthful allure
undimmed; and in every movement, every turn of his head, there
still remained much of that indefinable attractiveness which had
always characterised his race&mdash;much of the unconscious charm usually
known as breeding.</p>

<p>In men of Mortimer's fibre, dissipation produced coarser symptoms&mdash;distended
veins, and sagging flesh&mdash;where in Siward it seemed to bruise
and harden, driving the colour of blood out of him and leaving
the pallor of marble, and the bluish shadows of it staining the
hollows. Only the eyes had begun to change radically; something
in them had been quenched.</p>

<p>That he could never hope to become immune he had learned at last
when he had returned, physically wholesome, from his long course
of training under the famous Irish specialist on the Hudson. He
had expected to be immune, spite of the blunt and forcible language
of Mulqueen when he turned him out into the world again:</p>

<p>"Ye'll be afther notin'," said Mr. Mulqueen, "that a poonch in
the plexis putts a man out; but it don't kill him. That's you!
Whin a man mixes it up wid the booze, l'ave him come here an'
I'll tache him a thrick. But it's not murther I tache; it's the
hook on the jaw that shtops, an' the poonch in the plexis that
putts the booze-divil on the bum! L'ave him take the count; he'll
niver rise to the chune o' the bell av ye l'ave him lie. But he
ain't dead, Misther Sayward; mark that, me son! An' don't ye be
afther sayin', 'Th' inimy is down an' out fur good! Pore lad!
Sure, I'll shake hands over a dhrink wid him, for he can do me
no hurrt anny more!' No, sorr! L'ave him lie, an' l'ave the years
av ver life count him out; fur the day you die, he dies, an' not
wan shake o' the mixer sooner! G'wan, now, fur the rub-down. Ye've
faught yer lasht round, if ye ain't a fool!"</p>

<p>He had been a fool. He had imagined that he could control himself,
and practise the moderation that other men practised when they
chose. The puerile restraint annoyed him; his implied inability
to master himself humiliated him, the more so because, secretly,
he was horribly afraid in the remote depths of his heart.</p>

<p>Exactly how it happened he did not remember, except that he had
gone down town on business and had lunched with several men. There
was claret. Later he remembered another café, farther up town,
and another, more brilliantly lighted. After that there were vague
hours&mdash;the fierce fever of debauch wrapping night and day in flame
through which he moved, unseeing, unheeding, deafened, drenched
soul and body in the living fire; or dreaming, feeling the subsiding
fury of desire pulse and ebb and flow, rocking him to unconsciousness.</p>

<p>His father's old servants had found him again, this time in the
area; and this time the same ankle, not yet strong, had been broken.</p>

<p>Through the waning winter days, as he lay brooding in bitterness,
realising that it was all to do over again, Plank's shy visits
became gradually part of the routine. But it was many days before
Siward perceived in the big, lumbering, pink-fisted man anything
to attract him beyond the faintly amused curiosity of one man
for another who is in process of establishing himself as the first
of a race.</p>

<p>As for reciprocation in other forms except the most superficial,
or of permitting a personal note to sound ever so discreetly,
Siward tolerated no such idea. Even the tentative advances of
Plank hinting on willingness, and perhaps ability, to help Siward
in the Amalgamated tangle were pleasantly ignored. Unpaid services
rendered by men like Plank were impossible; any obligation to
Plank was utterly out of the question. Meanwhile they began to
like one another&mdash;at least Siward often found himself looking
forward with pleasure to a visit from Plank. There had never been
any question of the latter's attitude toward Siward.</p>

<p>Plank began to frequent the house, but never informally. It is
doubtful whether he could have practised informality in that house
even at Siward's invitation. Something of the attitude of a college
lower classman for a man in a class above seemed to typify their
relations; and that feeling is never entirely eradicated between
men, no matter how close their relationship in after-life.</p>

<p>One very bad night Plank came to the house and was admitted by
Gumble. Wands, the second man, stood behind the aged butler; both
were apparently frightened.</p>

<p>That something was amiss appeared plainly enough; and Plank,
instinctively producing a card, dropped it on a table and turned
to go. It may have been that the old butler recognised the innate
delicacy of the motive, or it may have been a sudden confidence
born of the necessities of the case, for he asked Plank to see
his young master.</p>

<p>And Plank, looking him in the eyes, considered, until his courage
began to fail. Then he went up-stairs.</p>

<p>It was a bad night outside, and it was a bad night for Siward.
The master-vice had him by the throat. He sat there, clutching
the arms of his chair, his broken leg, in its plaster casing,
extended in front of him; and when he saw Plank enter he glared
at him.</p>

<p>Hour after hour the two men sat there, the one white with rage,
but helpless; the other, stolid, inert, deaf to demands for intercession
with the arch-vice, dumb under pleadings for a compromise. He
refused to interfere with the butler, and Siward insulted him.
He refused to go and find the decanters himself, and Siward deliberately
cursed him.</p>

<p>Outside the storm raged all night. Inside that house Plank faced
a more awful tempest. There was a sedative on the mantel and he
offered it to Siward, who struck it from his hand.</p>

<p>Once, toward morning, Siward feigned sleep, and Plank, heavy
head on his breast, feigned it, too. Then Siward bent over stealthily
and opened a drawer in his desk; and Plank was on his feet like
a flash, jerking the morphine from Siward's fingers.</p>

<p>The doctor arrived at daylight, responding to Plank's summons
by telephone, and Plank went away with the morphine and Siward's
revolver bulging in the side-pockets of his dinner coat.</p>

<p>He did not come again for a week. A short note from Siward started
him toward lower Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>There was little said when he came into the room:</p>

<p>"Hello, Plank! Glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Hello! Are you all right?"</p>

<p>"All right. … Much obliged for pulling me through. Wish you'd
pull me through this Amalgamated Electric knot-hole, too&mdash;some
day!"</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;do you mean it?" ventured Plank, turning red with delight.</p>

<p>"Mean it? Indeed I do&mdash;if you do. Sit here; ring for whatever
you want&mdash;or perhaps you'd better go down to the sideboard. I'm
not to be trusted with the odour in the room just yet."</p>

<p>"I don't care for anything," said Plank.</p>

<p>"Whenever you please, then. You know the house, and you don't
mind my being unceremonious, do you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Plank.</p>

<p>"Good!" rejoined Siward, laughing. "I expect the same friendly
lack of ceremony from you."</p>

<p>But that, for Plank, was impossible. All he could do was to care
the more for Siward without crossing the border line so suddenly
made free; all he could do was to sit there rolling and unrolling
his gloves into wads with his clumsy, highly coloured hands, and
gaze consciously at everything in the room except Siward.</p>

<p>On that day, at Plank's shy suggestion, they talked over Siward's
business affairs for the first time. After that day, and for many
days, the subject became the key-note to their intercourse; and
Siward at last understood that this man desired to do him a service
absolutely and purely from a disinterested liking for him, and
as an expression of that liking. Also he was unexpectedly made
aware of Plank's serenely unerring business sagacity.</p>

<p>That surface cynicism which all must learn, sooner or later,
or remain the victims of naive credulity, was, in Siward, nothing
but an outer skin, as it is in all who acquire wisdom with their
cynicism. It was not long proof against Plank's simple attitude
and undisguised pleasure in doing something for a man he liked.
Under that simplicity no motive, no self-interest could skulk;
and Siward knew it.</p>

<p>As for the quid pro quo, Siward had insisted from the first on
a business arrangement. The treachery of Major Belwether through
sheer fright had knocked the key-stone from the syndicate, and
the dam which made the golden pool possible collapsed, showering
Plank's brokers who worked patiently with buckets and mops.</p>

<p>The double treachery of Quarrier was now perfectly apparent to
Plank. Siward, true to his word, held his stock in the face of
ruin. Kemp Ferrall, furious with the major, and beginning to suspect
Quarrier, came to Plank for consultation.</p>

<p>Then the defence formed under Plank. Legal machinery was set
in motion, meeting followed meeting, until Harrington cynically
showed his hand and Quarrier smiled his rare smile; and the fight
against Inter-County was on in the open, preceded by a furious
clamour of charge and counter-charge in the columns of the daily
press.</p>

<p>That Quarrier had been guilty of something or other was the vague
impression of that great news-reading public which, stunned by
the reiteration of figures in the millions, turns to the simpler
pleasures of a murder trial. Besides, whatever Quarrier had done
was no doubt done within the chalk-marked courts of the game,
though probably his shoes may have become a little dusty.</p>

<p>But who could hope to bring players like Quarrier before the
ordinary umpire, or to investigate his methods with the everyday
investigations reserved for everyday folk, whose road through
business life lay always between State's prison and the penitentiary
and whose guide-posts were policemen?</p>

<p>Let the great syndicates join in battle; they could only slay
each other. Let the millions bury their millions; the public,
though poorer, could never be the wiser.</p>

<p>Siward, at his desk, the May sunshine pouring over him, sat conning
the heaps of typewritten sheets, striving to see between the lines
some sign of fortune for his investments, some promise of release
from the increasing financial stringency, some chance of justice
being done on those high priests who had been performing marvellous
tricks upon their altar so that by miracle, mine and thine spelled
"ours," and all the tablets of the law were lettered upside down
and hind-side before, like the Black Mass.</p>

<p>Gumble knocked presently. Siward raised his perplexed eyes.</p>

<p>"Miss Page, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Siward doubtfully; then, "Ask Miss Page to come up."</p>

<p>Marion strolled in a moment later, exchanged a vigorous hand
shake with Siward, pulled up a chair and dropped into it. She
was in riding-habit and boots, faultlessly groomed as usual, her
smooth, pale hair sleek in its thick knot, collar and tie immaculate
as her gloves.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "any news of your ankle, Stephen?"</p>

<p>"I inquired about my ankle," said Siward, amused, "and they tell
me it is better, thank you."</p>

<p>"Sit a horse pretty soon?" she asked, dropping one leg over the
other and balancing the riding-crop across her knee.</p>

<p>"Not for awhile. You have a fine day for a gallop, Marion," looking
askance at the sunshine filtering through the first green leaves
of the tree outside his window.</p>

<p>"It's all right&mdash;the day. I'm trying Tom O'Hara's new mare. They
say she's a little devil. I never saw a devil of a horse&mdash;did
you? There may be some out West."</p>

<p>"Don't break that pretty neck of yours, Marion," he said.</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes; then, briefly, "No fear."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is," he said. "There's no use looking for trouble
in a horse. Women who hunt as you hunt take all that's legitimately
coming to them. Why doesn't Tom ride his own mare?"</p>

<p>"She rolled on him," said Marion simply.</p>

<p>"Oh. Is he hurt?"</p>

<p>"Ribs."</p>

<p>"Well, he's lucky."</p>

<p>"Isn't he! He'll miss a few drills with his precious squadron,
that's all."</p>

<p>She was looking about her, preoccupied. "Where are your cigarettes,
Stephen? Oh, I see. Don't try to move&mdash;don't be silly."</p>

<p>She leaned over the desk, her fresh young face close to his,
and reached for the cigarettes. The clean-cut head, the sweetness
of her youth and femininity, boyish in its allure, were very attractive
to him&mdash;more so, perhaps, because of his isolation from the atmosphere
of women.</p>

<p>"It's all very well, Marion, your coming here&mdash;and it's very
sweet of you, and I enjoy it immensely," he said: "but it's a
deuced imprudent thing for you to do, and I feel bound to say
so for your sake every time you come."</p>

<p>She leaned back in her chair and coolly blew a wreath of smoke
at him.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, unconvinced.</p>

<p>"Certainly it's all right. I've done what suited me all my life.
This suits me."</p>

<p>"It suits me, too," he said, "only I wish you'd tell your mother
before somebody around this neighbourhood informs her first."</p>

<p>"Let 'em. You'll be out by that time. Do you think I'm going
to tell my mother now and have her stop it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Marion, you know perfectly well that it won't do for a girl
to ignore first principles. I'm horribly afraid somebody will
talk about you."</p>

<p>"What would you do, then?"</p>

<p>"I?" he asked, disturbed. "What could I do?"</p>

<p>"Why, I suppose," she said slowly, "you'd have to marry me."</p>

<p>"Then," he rejoined with a laugh, "I should think you'd be scared
into prudence by the prospect."</p>

<p>"I am not easily&mdash;scared," she said, looking down.</p>

<p>"Not at that prospect?" he said jestingly.</p>

<p>She looked up at him; and he remembered afterward the poise of
her small head, and the slow, clear colour mounting; remembered
that it conveyed to him, somehow, a hint of courage and sincerity.</p>

<p>"I am not frightened," she said gravely.</p>

<p>Gravity fell upon him, too. In this young girl's eyes there was
no evasion. For a long while he had felt vaguely that matters
were not perfectly balanced between them. At moments, even, he
had felt an indefinable uneasiness in her presence. The situation
troubled him, too; and though he had known her from childhood
and had long ago learned to discount her vagaries of informality,
her manners sans façon, her careless ignoring of convention, and
the unembarrassed terms of her speech, his common-sense could
not countenance this defiance of social usage, sure to involve
even such a privileged girl as she in some unpleasantness.</p>

<p>This troubled him; and now, partly sceptical, yet partly conscious,
too, of her very frank liking for himself, he looked at her, perplexed,
apprehensive, unwilling to credit her with any deeper meaning
than her words expressed.</p>

<p>She had grown pink and restless under his gaze, using her cigarette
frequently, and continually flicking the ashes to the floor, until
the little finger of her glove was blackened.</p>

<p>But courage characterised her race. It had required more than
he knew for her to come into his house; and now that she was there
loyalty to her professed principles&mdash;that a man and a woman were
by right endowed with equal privileges&mdash;forced her to face the
consequences of her theory in the practise.</p>

<p>She had, with calm face and quivering heart, given him an opening.
That was a concession to her essential womanhood and a cowardice
on her part; and, lest she turn utterly traitor to herself, she
faced him again, cool, quiet, and terror in her heart:</p>

<p>"I'd be very glad to marry you&mdash;if you c-cared to," she said.</p>

<p>"Marion!"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Oh &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>it is&mdash;of course it's a joke."</p>

<p>"No; I'm serious."</p>

<p>"Serious! Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Please don't say that."</p>

<p>He looked at her, appalled.</p>

<p>"But <em>I&mdash;</em>but you don't love&mdash;can't be in love with me!"
he stammered.</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>Gloved hands tightening on either end of her riding-crop, she
bent her knee against it, balancing there, looking straight at
him.</p>

<p>"I meant to tell you so," she said, "if you didn't tell me first.
So &mdash;I was rather&mdash;tired waiting. So I've told you."</p>

<p>"It is only a fancy," he said, scarcely knowing what he was saying.</p>

<p>"I don't think so, Stephen."</p>

<p>But he could not meet her candour, and he sat, silent, miserable,
staring at the papers on his desk.</p>

<p>After a while she drew a deep, even breath, and rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said simply.</p>

<p>"Marion &mdash;I never dreamed that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You should dream truer," she said. There was a suspicion of
mist in her clear eyes; she turned abruptly to the window and
stood there for a few moments, looking down at her brougham waiting
in front of the house. "It can't be helped, can it!" she said,
turning suddenly.</p>

<p>He found no answer to her question.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said, walking to him with outstretched hand;
"it's all in a lifetime, Steve, and that's too short for a good,
clean friendship like ours to die in. I don't think I'd better
come again. Look me up for a gallop when you're fit. And you might
drop me a line to say how you're getting on. Is it all right,
Stephen?"</p>

<p>"All right," he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>Their hands tightened in a crushing clasp; then she swung on
her spurred heel and walked out, leaving him haggard, motionless.
He heard the front door close, and he swayed forward, dropping
his face in his hands, arms half buried among the papers on his
desk.</p>

<p>Plank found him there, an hour later, fumbling among the papers,
and at first feared that he read in Siward's drawn and sullen
face a premonition of the ever-dreaded symptoms.</p>

<p>"Quarrier has telephoned asking for a conference at last," he
said abruptly, sitting down beside Siward.</p>

<p>"Well," inquired Siward, "how do you interpret that&mdash;favourably?"</p>

<p>"I am inclined to think he is a bit uneasy," said Plank cautiously.
"Harrington made a secret trip to Albany last week. You didn't
know that."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, he did. It looks to me as though there were going to be
a ghost of a chance for an investigation. That is how I am inclined
to consider Harrington's trip and Quarrier's flag of truce. But
&mdash;I don't know. There's nothing definite, of course. You
are as conversant with the situation as I am."</p>

<p>"No, I am not. That is like you, Plank, to ascribe to me the
same business sense that you possess, but I haven't got it. It's
very nice and considerate of you, but I haven't it, and you know
it."</p>

<p>"I think you have."</p>

<p>"You think so because you think generously. That doesn't alter
the facts. Now tell me what you have concluded that we ought to
do and I'll say 'Amen,' as usual."</p>

<p>Plank laughed, and looked over several sheets of the typewritten
matter on the desk beside him.</p>

<p>"Suppose I meet Quarrier?" he said.</p>

<p>"All right. Did he suggest a date?"</p>

<p>"At four, this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Do you think you had better go?"</p>

<p>"I think it might do no harm," said Plank.</p>

<p>"Amen!" observed Siward, laughing, and touched the electric button
for the early tea, which Plank adored at any hour.</p>

<p>For a while they dropped business and discussed their tea, chatting
very comfortably together. Long ago Siward had found out something
of the mental breadth of the man beside him, and that he was worth
listening to as well as talking to. For Plank had formed opinions
upon a great many subjects; and whatever culture he possessed
was from sheer desire for self-cultivation.</p>

<p>"You know, Siward," he was accustomed to say with a smile, "you
inherit what I am qualifying myself to transmit."</p>

<p>"It will be all one in a thousand years," was Siward's usual
rejoinder.</p>

<p>"That is not going to prevent my efforts to become a good ancestor
to my descendants," Plank would say laughingly. "They shall have
a chance, every one of them. And it will be up to them if they
don't make good."</p>

<p>Sipping their tea in the pleasant, sunny room, they discussed
matters of common interest &mdash;Plank's recent fishing trip
on Long Island and the degeneracy of liver-fed trout; the North
Side Club's Experiments with European partridges; Billy Fleetwood's
new stables; forestry, and the chance of national legislation
concerning it&mdash;a subject of which Plank was very fond, and on
which he had exceedingly sound ideas.</p>

<p>Drifting from one topic to another through the haze of their
cigars, silent when it pleased them to be so, there could be no
doubt of their liking for each other upon a basis at least superficially
informal; and if Plank's manner retained at times a shade of quaint
reserve, Siward's was perhaps the more frankly direct for that
reason.</p>

<p>"I think," observed Plank, laying his half-consumed cigar on
the silver tray, "that I'd better go down town and see what our
pre-glacial friend Quarrier wants. I may be able to furnish him
with a new sensation."</p>

<p>"I wonder if Quarrier ever experienced a genuine sensation,"
mused Siward, arranging the papers before him into divisional
piles.</p>

<p>"Plenty," said Plank drily.</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Plenty," repeated Plank. "It's your thin-lipped, thin-nosed,
pasty-pale, symmetrical brother who is closer to the animal under
his mask than any of us imagine. <em>I&mdash;" </em>He hesitated. "Do
you want to know my opinion of Quarrier? I've never told you.
I don't usually talk about my&mdash;dislikes. Do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Siward curiously.</p>

<p>"Then, first of all, he is a sentimentalist."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" jeered Siward.</p>

<p>"A sentimentalist of the weakest type," continued Plank obstinately;
"because he sentimentalises over himself. Siward, look out for
the man with elaborate whiskers! Look out for a pallid man with
eccentric hair and a silky beard! He's a sentimentalist of the
sort I told you, and is usually utterly remorseless in his dealings
with women. I suppose you think me a fool."</p>

<p>"I think Quarrier is indifferent concerning women," said Siward.</p>

<p>"You are wrong. He is a sensualist," insisted Plank.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Plank&mdash;not that!"</p>

<p>"A sensualist. His sentimental vanity he lavishes upon himself&mdash;the
animal in him on women. His caution, born of self-consideration,
is the caution of a beast. Such men as he believe they live in
the focus of a million eyes. Part of his vanity is to deceive
those eyes and be what he is under the mask he wears; and to do
that one must be the very master of caution. That is Quarrier's
vanity. To conceal, is his monomania."</p>

<p>"I cannot see how you draw that conclusion."</p>

<p>"Siward, he is a bad man, and crafty&mdash;every inch of him."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, now! Only characters in fiction have no saving qualities.
You never heard of anybody in real life being entirely bad."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't; and Quarrier isn't. For example, he is kind to
valuable animals &mdash;I mean, his own."</p>

<p>"Good to animals! The bad man's invariable characteristic!" laughed
Siward. "I'm kind to 'em, too. What else is he good to?"</p>

<p>"Everybody knows that he hasn't a poor relation left; not one.
He is loyal to them in a rare way; he filled one subsidiary company
full of them. It is known down town as the 'Home for Destitute
Nephews.'"</p>

<p>"Seriously, Plank, the man must have something good in him."</p>

<p>"Because of your theory?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I believe that nobody is entirely bad. So do the great
masters of fiction."</p>

<p>Plank said gravely: "He is a good son to his father. That is
perfectly true&mdash;kind, considerate, dutiful, loyal. The financial
world is perfectly aware that Stanley Quarrier is to-day the most
unscrupulous old scoundrel who ever crushed a refinery or debauched
a railroad! and his son no more believes it than he credits the
scandalous history of the Red Woman of Wall Street. Why, when
I was making arrangements for that chapel Quarrier came to me,
very much perturbed, because he understood that all the memorial
chapels for the cathedral had been arranged for, and he had desired
to build one to the memory of his father! His father! Isn't it
awful to think of!&mdash;a chapel to the memory of the briber of judges
and of legislatures, the cynical defier of law!&mdash;this hoary old
thief, who beggared the widow and stripped the orphan, and whose
only match, as a great unpunished criminal, was that sinister
little predecessor of his, who dreamed even of debauching the
executive of these United States!"</p>

<p>Siward had never before seen Plank aroused, and he said so, smiling.</p>

<p>"That is true," said Plank earnestly; "I waste little temper
over my likes and dislikes. But what I know, and what I legitimately
infer concerning the younger Quarrier is enough to rouse any man's
anger. I won't tell you what I know. I can't. It has nothing to
do with his financial methods, nothing to do with this business;
but it is bad&mdash;bad all through! The blow his father struck at
the integrity of the bench the son strikes at the very key-stone
of all social safeguard. It isn't my business; I cannot interfere;
but Siward, I'm a damned restless witness, and the old, primitive
longing comes back on me to strike&mdash;to take a stick and use it
to splinters on that man whom I am going down town to politely
confer with! … And I must go now. Good-bye. … Take care of that
ankle. Any books I can send you&mdash;anything you want? No? All right.
And don't worry over Amalgamated Electric, for I really believe
we are beginning to frighten them badly."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Siward. "Don't forget that I'm always at home."</p>

<p>"You must get out," muttered Plank; "you must get well, and get
out into the sunshine." And he went ponderously down-stairs to
the square hall, where Gumble held his hat and gloves ready for
him.</p>

<p>He had come in a big yellow and black touring-car; and now, with
a brief word to his mechanic, he climbed into the tonneau, and
away they sped down town&mdash;a glitter of bull's-eye, brass, and
varnish, with the mellow, horn notes floating far in their wake.</p>

<p>It was exactly four o'clock when he was ushered into Quarrier's
private suite in the great marble Algonquin Loan and Trust Building,
the upper stories of which were all golden in the sun against
a sky of sapphire.</p>

<p>Quarrier was alone, gloved and hatted, as though on the point
of leaving. He showed a slight surprise at seeing Plank, as if
he had not been expecting him; and the manner of offering his
hand subtly emphasised it as he came forward with a trace of inquiry
in his greeting.</p>

<p>"You said four o'clock, I believe," observed Plank bluntly.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. It was about that&mdash;ah&mdash;matter&mdash;ah &mdash;I beg your
pardon; can you recollect?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is you want. You requested this meeting,"
said Plank, yawning.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I recollect it perfectly now. Will you sit here,
Mr. Plank&mdash;for a moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If it concerns Inter-County, it will take longer than a moment&mdash;unless
you cannot spare the time now," said Plank. "Shall we call it
off?"</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact I am rather short of time just now."</p>

<p>"Then let us postpone it. I shall probably be at my office if
you are anxious to see me."</p>

<p>Quarrier looked at him, then laid aside his hat and sat down.
There was little to be done in diplomacy with an oaf like that.</p>

<p>"Mr. Plank," he said, without any emphasis at all, "there should
be some way for us to come together. Have you considered it?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't," replied Plank.</p>

<p>"I mean, for you and me to try to understand each other."</p>

<p>"For us?" asked Plank, raising his blond eyebrows. "Do you mean
Amalgamated Electric and Inter-County, impersonally?"</p>

<p>"I mean for us, personally."</p>

<p>"There is no way," said Plank, with conviction.</p>

<p>"I think there is."</p>

<p>"You are wasting time thinking it, Mr. Quarrier."</p>

<p>Quarrier's velvet-fringed eyes began to narrow, but his calm
voice remained unchanged: "We are merely wasting energy in this
duel," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I don't feel wasted."</p>

<p>"We are also wasting opportunities," continued Quarrier slowly.
"This whole matter is involving us in a tangle of litigation requiring
our constant effort, constant attention."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Quarrier, but you take it too seriously.
I have found, in this affair, nothing except a rather agreeable
mental exhilaration."</p>

<p>"Mr. Plank, if you are not inclined to be serious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am," said Plank so savagely that Quarrier, startled, could
not doubt him. "I like this sort of thing, Mr. Quarrier. Anything
that is hard to overcome, I like to overcome. The pleasure in
life, to me, is to win out. I am fighting you with the greatest
possible satisfaction to myself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you see victory ahead," said Quarrier calmly.</p>

<p>"I do, Mr. Quarrier, I do. But not in the manner you fear I may
hope for it."</p>

<p>"Do you mind saying in what manner you are already discounting
your victory, Mr Plank?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't mind telling you. I have no batteries to mask. I
don't care how much you know about my resources; so I'll tell
you what I see, Mr. Quarrier. I see a parody of the popular battle
between razor-back and rattler. The rattler only strives to strike
and kill, not to swallow. Mr. Quarrier, that old razor-back isn't
going home hungry; but&mdash;he's going home."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am not familiar enough with the natural history
you quote to follow you," said Quarrier with a sneer, his long
fingers busy with the silky point of his beard.</p>

<p>"No, you won't follow me home; you'll come with me, when it's
all over. Now is it very plain to you, Mr. Quarrier?"</p>

<p>Quarrier said, without emotion: "I repeat that it would be easy
for you and me to merge our differences on a basis absolutely
satisfactory to you and to me&mdash;and to Harrington."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," said Plank, rising. "Good afternoon."</p>

<p>Quarrier rose, too. "You decline to discuss the matter?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It has been discussed sufficiently."</p>

<p>"Then why did you come here?"</p>

<p>"To see for myself how afraid of me you really are," said Plank.
"Now I know, and so do you."</p>

<p>"You desire to make it a personal matter?" inquired Quarrier,
in a low voice, his face dead white in the late sunlight which
illuminated the room.</p>

<p>"Personal? No&mdash;impersonal; because there could be absolutely
nothing personal between us, Mr. Quarrier; and the only thing
in the world that there ought to be between us are a few stout,
steel bars. Beg pardon for talking shop. I'm a shopkeeper, and
I'm in the steel business, and I lack opportunities for cultivation.
Good day."</p>

<p>"Mr. Plank&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Quarrier, I want to tell you something. Never before, in
business differences, has private indignation against any individual
interfered or modified my course of action. It does now; but it
does not dictate my policy toward you; it merely, as I say, modifies
it. I am perfectly aware of what I am doing; what social disaster
I am inviting by this attitude toward you personally; what financial
destruction I am courting in arousing the wrath of the Algonquin
Trust Company and of the powerful interests intrenched behind
Inter-County Electric. I know what the lobby is; I know what judge
cannot be counted on; I know my peril and my chances, every one;
and I take them&mdash;every one. For it is a good fight, Mr. Quarrier;
it will be talked of for years to come, wonderingly; not because
of your effrontery, not because of my obstinacy, but because such
monstrous immorality could ever have existed in this land of ours.
Your name, Harrington's, mine, will have become utterly forgotten
long, long before the horror of these present conditions shall
cease to be remembered."</p>

<p>He stretched out one ponderous arm, pointing full between Quarrier's
unwinking eyes.</p>

<p>"Take your fighting chance&mdash;it is the cleanest thing you ever
touched; and use it cleanly, or there'll be no mercy shown you
when your time comes. Let the courts alone&mdash;do you hear me? Let
the legislature alone. Keep your manicured hands off the ermine.
And tell Harrington to shove his own cold, splay fingers into
his own pockets for a change. They'll be warmer than his feet
by this time next year."</p>

<p>For a moment he towered there, powerful, bulky, menacing; then
his arm dropped heavily&mdash;the old stolid expression came back into
his face, leaving it calm, bovine, almost stupid again. And he
turned, moving slowly toward the door, holding his hat carefully
in his gloved hand.</p>

<p>Stepping out of the elevator on the ground floor he encountered
Mortimer, and halted instinctively. He had not seen Mortimer for
weeks; neither had Leila; and now he looked at him inquiringly,
disturbed at his battered and bloodshot appearance.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mortimer, "you down here?"</p>

<p>"Have you been out of town?" asked Plank cautiously.</p>

<p>Mortimer nodded, and started to pass on toward the bronze cage
of the elevator, but something seemed to occur to him suddenly;
he checked his pace, turned, and waddled after Plank, rejoining
him on the marble steps of the rotunda.</p>

<p>"See here," he panted, holding Plank by the elbow and breathing
heavily even after the short chase across the lobby, "I meant
to tell you something. Come over here and sit down a moment."</p>

<p>Still grasping Plank's elbow in his puffy fingers, he directed
him toward a velvet seat in a corner of the lobby; and here they
sat down, while Mortimer mopped his fat neck with his handkerchief,
swearing at the heat under his breath.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said; "I promised you something once, didn't
I?"</p>

<p>"Did you?" said Plank, with his bland, expressionless stare of
an overgrown baby.</p>

<p>"Oh, cut that out! You know damn well I did; and when I say a
thing I make good. D'ye see?"</p>

<p>"I don't see," said Plank, "what you are talking about."</p>

<p>"I'm talking about what I said I'd do for you. Haven't I made
good? Haven't I put you into everything I said I would? Don't
you go everywhere? Don't people ask you everywhere?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in a way," said Plank wearily. "I am very grateful; I always
will be. … Can I do anything for you, Leroy?"</p>

<p>Mortimer became indignant at the implied distrust of the purity
of his motives; and Plank, failing to stem the maudlin tirade,
relapsed into patient silence, speculating within himself as to
what it could be that Mortimer wanted.</p>

<p>It came out presently. Mortimer had attended a "killing" at Desmond's,
and, as usual, had provided the pièce de résistance for his soft-voiced
host. All he wanted was a temporary deposit to tide over matters.
He had never approached Plank in vain, and he did not do so now,
for Plank had a pocket cheque-book and a stylograph.</p>

<p>"It's damn little to ask, isn't it?" he muttered resentfully.
"That will only square matters with Desmond; it doesn't leave
me anything to go on with," and he pocketed his cheque with a
scowl.</p>

<p>Plank was discreetly silent.</p>

<p>"And that is not what I chased you for, either," continued Mortimer.
"I didn't intend to say anything about Desmond; I was going to
fix it in another way!" He cast an involuntary and sinister glance
at the elevators gliding ceaselessly up and down at the end of
the vast marble rotunda; then his protruding eyes sought Plank's
again:</p>

<p>"Beverly, old boy, I've got a certain mealy-faced hypocrite where
any decent man would like to have him&mdash;by the scruff of his neck.
He's fit only to kick; and I'm going to kick him good and plenty;
and in the process he's going to let go of several things." Mortimer
leered, pleased with his own similes, then added rather hastily:
"I mean, he's going to drop several things that don't belong to
him. Leave it to me to shake him down; he'll drop them all right.
… One of 'em's yours."</p>

<p>Plank looked at him.</p>

<p>"I told you once that I'd let you know when to step up and say
'Good evening' didn't I?"</p>

<p>Plank continued to stare.</p>

<p>"Didn't I?" repeated Mortimer peevishly, beginning to lose countenance.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said Plank, "and I don't think I want
to understand you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Mortimer thickly; "don't you want
to marry that girl!" but he shrank dismayed under the slow blaze
that lighted Plank's blue eyes.</p>

<p>"All right," he stammered, struggling to his fat legs and instinctively
backing away; "I thought you meant business. <em>I&mdash;</em>what
the devil do I care who you marry! It's the last time I try to
do anything for you, or for anybody else! Mark that, my friend.
I've plenty to worry over; I've a lot to keep me busy without
lying awake to figure out how to do kindnesses to old friends.
Damn this ingratitude, anyway!"</p>

<p>Plank gazed at him for a moment; the anger in his face had died
out.</p>

<p>"I am not ungrateful," he said. "You may say almost anything
except that, Leroy. I am not disloyal, no matter what else I may
be. But you have made a bad mistake. You made it that day at Black
Fells when you offered to interfere. I supposed you understood
then that I could never tolerate from anybody anything of such
a nature. It appears that you didn't. However, you understand
it now. So let us forget the matter."</p>

<p>But Mortimer, keenly appreciative of the pleasures of being misunderstood,
squeezed some moisture out of his distended eyes, and sat down,
a martyr to his emotions. "To think," he gulped, "that you, of
all men, should turn on me like this!"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to. Can't you understand, Leroy, that you hurt
me?"</p>

<p>"Hurt hell!" retorted Mortimer vindictively. "You've had sensation
battered out of you by this time. I guess society has landed you
a few while I was boosting you over the outworks. Don't play that
old con game on me! You tried to get her and you couldn't. Now
I come along and offer to put you next and you yell about your
hurt feelings! Oh, splash! There's another lady, that's all."</p>

<p>"Let it go at that, then," said Plank, reddening.</p>

<p>"But I tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drop it!" snapped Plank.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well! if you're going to take it that way again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am. Cut it! And now let me ask you a question: Where were
you going when I met you?"</p>

<p>"What do you want to know for?" asked Mortimer sullenly.</p>

<p>"Why, I'll tell you, Leroy. If you have any idea of identifying
yourself with Quarrier's people, of seeking him at this juncture
with the expectation of investing any money in his schemes, you
had better not do so."</p>

<p>"Investing!" sneered Mortimer. "Well, no, not exactly, having
nothing to invest, thanks to my being swindled into joining his
Amalgamated Electric gang. Don't worry. If there's any shaking
down to be done, I'll do it, my friend," and he rose, and started
toward the elevators.</p>

<p>"Wait," said Plank. "Why, man, you can't frighten Quarrier! What
did you sell your holdings for? Why didn't you come to us&mdash;to
me? What's the use of going to Quarrier now, and scolding? You
can't scare a man like that."</p>

<p>Mortimer fairly grinned in his face.</p>

<p>"Your big mistake," he sneered, "is in undervaluing others. You
don't think I amount to very much, do you, Beverly? But I'm going
to try to take care of myself all the same." He laughed, showing
his big teeth, and the vanity in him began to drug him. "No, you
think I don't know much. But men like you and Quarrier will damn
soon find out! I want you to understand," he went on excitedly,
forgetting the instinctive caution which in saner moments he was
only too certain that his present business required&mdash;"I want you
to understand a few things, my friend, and one of them is that
I'm not afraid of Quarrier, and another is, I'm not afraid of
you!"</p>

<p>"Leroy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, not afraid of you, either!" repeated Mortimer with an ugly
stare. "Don't try any of your smug, aint-it-a-shame-he-drinks
ways on me, Beverly! I'm getting tired of it; I'm tired of it
now, by God! You keep a civil tongue in your head after this&mdash;do
you understand?&mdash;and we'll get on all right. If you don't, I've
the means to make you!"</p>

<p>"Are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! Too damn sane for you and Leila to hoodwink!"</p>

<p>"You are crazy!" repeated Plank, aghast.</p>

<p>"Am I? You and Leila can take the matter into court, if you want
to&mdash;unless I do. And"&mdash;here he leaned forward, showing his teeth
again&mdash;"the next time you kiss her, close the door!"</p>

<p>Then he went away up the marble steps and entered an elevator;
and Plank, grave and pale, went out into the street and entered
his big touring-car. But the drive up town and through the sunlit
park gave him no pleasure, and he entered his great house with
a heavy, lifeless step, head bent, as though counting every crevice
in the stones under his lagging feet. For the first time in all
his life he was afraid of a man.</p>

<p>The man he was afraid of had gone directly to Quarrier's office,
missing the gentleman he was seeking by such a small fraction
of a minute that he realised they must have passed each other
in the elevators, he ascending while Quarrier was descending.</p>

<p>Mortimer turned and hurried to the elevator, hoping to come up
with Quarrier in the rotunda, or possibly in the street outside;
but he was too late, and, furious to think of the time he had
wasted with Plank, he crawled into a hansom and bade the driver
take him to a number he gave, designating one of the new limestone
basement houses on the upper west side.</p>

<p>All the way up town, as he jolted about in his seat, he angrily
regretted the meeting with Plank, even in spite of the cheque.
What demon had possessed him to boast&mdash;to display his hand when
there had been no necessity? Plank was still ready to give him
aid at a crisis&mdash;had always been ready. Time enough when Plank
turned stingy to use persuasion; time enough when Plank attempted
to dodge him to employ a club. And now, for no earthly reason,
intoxicated with his own vanity, catering to his own long-smouldering
resentment, he had used his club on a willing horse&mdash;deliberately
threatened a man whose gratitude had been good for many a cheque
yet.</p>

<p>"Ass that I am!" fumed Mortimer; "now when I'm stuck I'll have
to go at him with the club, if I want any money out of him. Confound
him, he's putting me in a false position! He's trying to make
it look like extortion! I won't do it! I'm no blackmailer! I'll
starve, before I go to him again! No blundering, clumsy Dutchman
can make a blackmailer out of me by holding hands with that scoundrelly
wife of mine! That's the reason he did it, too! Between them they
are trying to make my loans from Plank look like blackmail! It
would serve them right if I took them up&mdash;if I called their bluff,
and stuck Plank up in earnest! But I won't, to please them! I
won't do any dirty thing like that, to humour them! Not much!"</p>

<p>He lay back, rolling about in the jouncing cab, scowling at space.</p>

<p>"Not much!" he repeated. "I'll shake down Quarrier, though! I'll
make him pay for his treachery&mdash;scaring me out of Amalgamated!
That will be restitution, not extortion!"</p>

<p>He was the angrier because he had been for days screwing up his
courage to the point of seeking Quarrier face to face. He had
not wished to do it; the scene, and his own attitude in it, could
only be repugnant to him, although he continually explained to
himself that it was restitution, not extortion.</p>

<p>But whatever it was, he didn't like to figure in it, and he had
hung back as long as circumstances permitted. But his new lodgings
and his new friends were expensive; and Plank, he supposed, was
off somewhere fishing; so he hung on as long as it was possible;
then, exasperated by necessity, started for Quarrier's office,
only to miss him by a few seconds because he was fool enough to
waste his temper and his opportunity in making an enemy out of
a friend!</p>

<p>"Oh," he groaned, "what an ass I am!" And he got out of his cab
in front of a very new limestone basement house with red geraniums
blooming on the window-sills, and let himself in with a latch-key.</p>

<p>The interior of the house was attractive in a rather bright,
new, clean fashion. There seemed to be a great deal of white wood-work
about, a wilderness of slender white spindles supporting the dark,
rich mahogany handrail of the stairway; elaborate white grilles
between snowy, Corinthian pillars separating the hall from the
drawing-room, where a pale gilt mirror over a white, colonial
mantel reflected a glass chandelier and panelled walls hung with
pale blue silk.</p>

<p>All was new, very clean, very quiet; the maid, too, who appeared
at the sound of the closing door and took his hat and gloves was
as newly groomed as the floors and wood-work, and so noiseless
as to be conspicuous in her swift, silent movements.</p>

<p>Yet there was something about it all&mdash;about the bluish silvery
half-light, the spotless floors and walls, the abnormally noiseless
maid in her flamboyant cap and apron&mdash;that arrested attention
and fixed it. The soundless brightness of the house was as conspicuous
as the contrast between the maid's black gown and her snow-white
cuffs. There was nothing subdued about anything, although the
long, silvery blue curtains were drawn over the lace window hangings;
no shadows anywhere, no half-lights. The very stillness was gay
with suspense, like a pretty woman's suppressed laughter glimmering
in her eyes.</p>

<p>And into this tinted light, framed in palest blue and white,
waddled Mortimer, appropriate as a June-bug scrambling in a Sèvres
teacup.</p>

<p>"Anybody here?" he growled, leering into the drawing-room at
a tiny grand piano cased in unvarnished Circassian walnut.</p>

<p>"There is nobody at home, sir," said the maid.</p>

<p>"Music lesson over?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, at three."</p>

<p>He began to ascend the stairway, breathing heavily, thud, thud
over the deep velvet strip, his fat hand grasping the banister
rail.</p>

<p>Somewhere on the second floor a small dog barked, and Mortimer
traversed the ball and opened the door into a room hung with gold
Spanish leather and pale green curtains.</p>

<p>"Hello, Tinto!" he said affably as a tiny Japanese spaniel hurled
herself at him, barking furiously, then began writhing and weaving
herself about him, gurgling recognition and welcome.</p>

<p>He sat down heavily in a padded easy-chair. The spaniel sprang
into his lap, wheezing, sniffling, goggling its protruding eyes.
Mortimer liked the dog, but he didn't like what the owner of the
dog said about the resemblance between his own and Tinto's eyes.</p>

<p>"Get down!" he said; "you're shedding black and white hairs all
over me." But the dog didn't want to get down, and Mortimer's
good nature permitted her to curl up on his fat knees and sleep
that nervous, twitching sleep peculiar to overpampered toy canines.</p>

<p>The southern sun was warm in the room; the windows open, but
not a silken hanging stirred.</p>

<p>Presently another maid entered, with an apple cut into thin wafers
and a decanter of port; and Mortimer lay back in his chair, sopping
his apple in the thick, crimson wine, and feeding morsels of the
combination to himself and to Tinto at intervals until the apple
was all gone and the decanter three-fourths empty.</p>

<p>It was very still in the room&mdash;so still, that Mortimer, opening
his eyes at longer and longer intervals to peer at the door, finally
opened them no more.</p>

<p>The droning gurgle that he made kept Tinto awake. When his lower
jaw sagged, and he began to really show what snoring could be,
Tinto, very nervous, got up and hopped down.</p>

<p>It was still daylight when Mortimer awoke, conscious of people
about him. As he opened his eyes, a man laughed; several people
seated by the windows joined in. Then, straightening up with an
effort, something tumbled from his head to the floor and he started
to rise.</p>

<p>"Oh, look out, Leroy! Don't step on my hat!" cried a girl's voice;
and he sank back in his chair, gazing stupidly around.</p>

<p>"Hello! you people!" he said, amused; "I guess I've been asleep.
Oh, is that you Millbank? Whose hat was that&mdash;yours, Lydia?"</p>

<p>He yawned, laughed, turning his heavy eyes from one to another,
recognising a couple of young girls at the window. He didn't want
to get up; but there is, in the society he now adorned, a stringency
of etiquette known as "re-finement," and which, to ignore, is
to become unpopular.</p>

<p>So he got onto his massive legs and went over to shake hands
with a gravity becoming the ceremony.</p>

<p>"How d'ye do, Miss Hutchinson? Thought you were at Asbury Park.
How de do, Miss Del Garcia. Have you been out in Millbank's motor
yet?"</p>

<p>"We broke down at McGowan's Pass," said Miss Del Garcia, laughing
the laugh that had made her so attractive in "A Word to the Wise."</p>

<p>"Muddy gasoline," nodded Millbank tersely&mdash;an iron-jawed, over-groomed
man of forty, with a florid face shaved blue.</p>

<p>"We passed Mr. Plank's big touring-car," observed Lydia Vyse,
shifting Tinto to the couch and brushing the black and white hairs
from her automobile coat. "How much does a car like that cost,
Leroy?"</p>

<p>"About twenty-five thousand," he said gloomily. Then, looking
up, "Hold on, Millbank, don't be going! Why can't you all dine
with us? Never mind your car; ours is all right, and we'll run
out into the country for dinner. How about it, Miss Del Garcia?"</p>

<p>But both Miss Del Garcia and Miss Hutchinson had accepted another
invitation, in which Millbank was also included.</p>

<p>They stood about, veils floating, leather decorated coats thrown
back, lingering for awhile to talk the garage talk which fascinates
people of their type; then Millbank looked at the clock, made
his adieux to Lydia, nodded significantly to Mortimer, and followed
the others down-stairs.</p>

<p>There was something amiss with his motor, for it made a startling
racket in the street, finally plunging forward with a kick.</p>

<p>Lydia laughed as the two young girls in the tonneau turned to
nod to her in mock despair; then she came running back up-stairs,
holding her skirt free from her hurrying little feet.</p>

<p>"Well?" she inquired, as Mortimer turned back from the window
to confront her.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, little girl," he said with a sombre smile.</p>

<p>She looked at him, slowly divesting herself of her light leather-trimmed
coat.</p>

<p>"I missed him," said Mortimer.</p>

<p>She flung the coat over a chair, stood a moment, her fingers
busy with her hair-pegs, then sat down on the couch, taking Tinto
into her lap. She was very pretty, dark, slim, marvellously graceful
in her every movement.</p>

<p>"I missed him," repeated Mortimer.</p>

<p>"Can't you see him to-morrow?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Mortimer slowly. "Oh, Lord! how I hate this
business!"</p>

<p>"Hasn't he misused your confidence? Hasn't he taken your money?"
she asked. "It may be unpleasant for you to make him unbelt, but
you're a coward if you don't!"</p>

<p>"Easy! easy, now!" muttered Mortimer; "I'm going to shake it
out of him. I said I would, and I will."</p>

<p>"I should hope so; it's yours."</p>

<p>"Certainly it's mine. I wish I'd held fast now. I never supposed
Plank would take hold. It was that drivelling old Belwether who
scared me stiff! The minute I saw him scurrying to cover like
a singed cat I was fool enough to climb the first tree. I've had
my lesson, little girl."</p>

<p>"I hope you'll give Howard his. Somebody ought to," she said
quietly.</p>

<p>Then gathering up her hat and coat she went into her own apartments.
Mortimer picked up a cheap magazine, looked over the portraits
of the actresses, then, hunching up into a comfortable position,
settled himself to read the theatrical comment.</p>

<p>Later, Lydia not appearing, and his own valet arriving to turn
on the electricity, bring him his White Rock and Irish and the
Evening Telegraph, he hoisted his legs into another chair and
sprawled there luxuriously over his paper until it was time to
dress.</p>

<p>About half past eight they dined in a white and pink dining-room
furnished in dull gray walnut, and served by a stealthy, white-haired,
pink-skinned butler, chiefly remarkable because it seemed utterly
impossible to get a glimpse of his eyes. Nobody could tell whether
there was anything the matter with them or not&mdash;and whether they
were only very deep set or were weak, like an albino's, or were
slightly crossed, the guests of the house never knew. Lydia herself
didn't know, and had given up trying to find out.</p>

<p>They had planned to go for a spin in Mortimer's motor after dinner,
but in view of the Quarrier fiasco neither was in the mood for
anything.</p>

<p>Mortimer, as usual, ate and drank heavily. He was a carnivorous
man, and liked plenty of thick, fat, underdone meat. As for Lydia,
her appetite was as erratic as her own impulses. Her table, always
wastefully elaborate, no doubt furnished subsistence for all the
relatives of her household below stairs, and left sufficient for
any ambitious butler to make a decent profit on.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Leroy," she observed, as they left the table and
sauntered back into the pale blue drawing-room, "do you know that
the servants haven't been paid for three months?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for Heaven's sake," he expostulated, "don't begin that sort
of thing! I get enough of that at home; I get it every time I
show my nose!"</p>

<p>"I only mentioned it," she said carelessly.</p>

<p>"I heard you all right. It isn't any pleasanter for me than for
you. In fact, I'm sick of it; I'm dead tired of being up against
it every day of my life. When a man has anything somebody gets
it before he can sidestep. When a man's dead broke there's nobody
in sight to touch."</p>

<p>"You had an opportunity to make Howard pay you back."</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you I missed him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Do?"</p>

<p>"Of course. You are going to do something, I suppose."</p>

<p>They had reached the gold and green room above. Lydia began pacing
the length of a beautiful Kermanshah rug&mdash;a pale, delicate marvel
of rose and green on a ground of ivory&mdash;lovely, but doomed to
fade sooner than the pretty woman who trod it with restless, silk-shod
feet.</p>

<p>Mortimer had not responded to her last question. She said presently:
"You have never told me how you intend to make him pay you back."</p>

<p>"What?" inquired Mortimer, turning very red.</p>

<p>"I said that you haven't yet told me how you intend to make Howard
return the money you lost through his juggling with your stock."</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know myself," admitted Mortimer, still overflushed.
"I mean to put it to him squarely, as a debt of honour that he
owes. I asked him whether to invest. Damn him! he never warned
me not to. He is morally responsible. Any man who would sit there
and nod monotonously like a mandarin, knowing all the while what
he was doing to wreck the company, and let a friend put into a
rotten concern all the cash he could scrape together, is a swindler!"</p>

<p>"I think so too," she said, studying the rose arabesques in the
rug.</p>

<p>There was a little click of her teeth when she ended her inspection
and looked across at Mortimer. Something in her expressionless
gaze seemed to reassure him, and give him a confidence he may
have lacked.</p>

<p>"I want him to understand that I won't swallow that sort of contemptible
treatment," asserted Mortimer, lighting a thick, dark cigar.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll make him understand," she said, seating herself
and resting her clasped, brilliantly ringed hands in her lap.</p>

<p>"Oh, I will&mdash;never fear! He has abused my confidence abominably;
he has practically swindled me, Lydia. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I'll tell him so, too," blustered Mortimer, shaking himself
into an upright posture, and laying a pudgy, clinched fist on
the table. "I'm not afraid of him! He'll find that out, too. I
know enough to stagger him. Not that I mean to use it. I'm not
going to have him think that my demands on him for my own property
resemble extortion."</p>

<p>"Extortion?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes. I don't want him to think I'm trying to intimidate him.
I won't have him think I'm a grafter; but I've half a mind to
shake that money out of him, in one way or another."</p>

<p>He struck the table and looked at her for further sign of approval.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of him," he repeated. "I wish to God he were
here, and I'd tell him so!"</p>

<p>She said coolly: "I was wishing that too."</p>

<p>For a while they sat silent, preoccupied, avoiding each other's
direct gaze. When she rose he started, watching her in a dazed
way as she walked to the telephone.</p>

<p>"Shall I?" she asked quietly, turning to him, her hand on the
receiver.</p>

<p>"Wait. W-what are you going to do?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Call him up. Shall I?"</p>

<p>A dull throb of fright pulsed through him.</p>

<p>"You say you are not afraid of him, Leroy."</p>

<p>"No!" he said with an oath, "I am not. Go ahead!"</p>

<p>She unhooked the receiver. After a second or two her low, even
voice sounded. There came a pause. She rested one elbow on the
walnut shelf, the receiver tight to her ear. Then:</p>

<p>"Mr. Quarrier, please. … Yes, Mr. Howard Quarrier. … No, no name.
Say it is on business of immediate importance. … Very well, then;
you may say that Miss Vyse insists on speaking to him. … Yes,
I'll hold the wire."</p>

<p>She turned, the receiver at her ear, and looked narrowly at Mortimer.</p>

<p>"Won't he speak to you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I'm going to find out. Hush a moment!" and in the same calm,
almost childish voice: "Oh, Howard, is that you? Yes, I know I
promised not to do this, but that was before things happened!
… Well, what am I to do when it is necessary to talk to you? …
Yes, it is necessary! … I tell you it is necessary! … I am sorry
it is not convenient for you to talk to me, but I really must
ask you to listen! … No, I shall not write. I want to talk to
you to-night&mdash;now! Yes, you may come here, if you care to! … I
think you had better come, Howard. … Because I am liable to continue
ringing your telephone until you are willing to listen. … No,
there is nobody here. I am alone. What time? … Very well; I shall
expect you. Good-bye."</p>

<p>She hung up the receiver and turned to Mortimer:</p>

<p>"He's coming up at once. Did I say anything to scare him particularly?"</p>

<p>"One thing's sure as preaching," said Mortimer; "he's a coward,
and I'm dammed glad of it," he added naively, relighting his cigar,
which had gone out.</p>

<p>"If he comes up in his motor he'll be here in a few minutes,"
she said. "Suppose you take your hat and go out. I don't want
him to think what he will think if he walks into the room and
finds you waiting. You have your key, Leroy. Walk down the block;
and when you see him come in, give him five minutes."</p>

<p>Her voice had become a little breathless, and her colour was
high. Mortimer, too, seemed apprehensive. Things had suddenly
begun to work themselves out too swiftly.</p>

<p>"Do you think that's best?" he faltered, looking about for his
hat. "Tell Merkle that nobody has been here, if Quarrier should
ask him. Do you think we're doing it in the best way, Lydia? By
God, it smells of a put-up job to me! But I guess it's all right.
It's better for me to just happen in, isn't it? Don't forget to
put Merkle wise."</p>

<p>He descended the stairs hastily. Merkle, of the invisible eyes,
held his hat and gloves and opened the door for him.</p>

<p>Once on the dark street, his impulse was to flee&mdash;get out, get
away from the whole business. A sullen shame was pumping the hot
blood up into his neck and cheeks. He strove to find an inoffensive
name for what he was proposing to do, but ugly terms, synonym
after synonym, crowded in to characterise the impending procedure,
and he walked on angrily, half frightened, looking back from moment
to moment at the house he had just left.</p>

<p>On the corner he halted, breathing spasmodically, for he had
struck a smarter pace than he had been aware of.</p>

<p>Few people passed him. Once he caught a glimmer of a policeman's
buttons along the park wall, and an unpleasant shiver passed over
him. At the same moment an electric hansom flew noiselessly past
him. He shrank back into the shadow of a porte-cochere. The hansom
halted before the limestone basement house. A tall figure left
it, stood a moment in the middle of the sidewalk, then walked
quickly to the front door. It opened, and the man vanished.</p>

<p>The hansom still waited at the door. Mortimer, his hands shaking,
looked at his watch by the light of the electric bulbs flanking
the gateway under which he stood.</p>

<p>There was not much time in which to make up his mind, yet his
fright was increasing to a pitch which began to enrage him with
that coward's courage which it is impossible to reckon with.</p>

<p>He had missed Quarrier once to-day when he had been keyed to
the encounter. Was he going to miss him again through sheer terror?
Besides, was not Quarrier a coward? Besides, was it not his own
money? Had he not been vilely swindled by a pretended friend?
Urging, lashing himself into a heavy, shuffling motion, he emerged
from the porte-cochere and lurched off down the street. No time
to think now, no time for second thought, for hesitation, for
weakness. He had waited too long already. He had waited ten minutes,
instead of five. Was Quarrier going to escape again? Was he going
to get out of the house before&mdash;</p>

<p>Fumbling with his latch-key, but with sense enough left to make
no noise, he let himself in, passed silently through the reception-hall
and up to the drawing-room floor, where for a second he stood
listening. Then something of the perverted sportsman sent the
blood quivering into his veins. He had him! He had run him down!
The game was at bay.</p>

<p>An inrush of exhilaration steadied him. He laid his hand on the
banister and mounted, gloves and hat-brim crushed in the other
hand. When he entered the room he pretended to see only Lydia.</p>

<p>"Hello, little girl!" he said, laughing, "are you surprised to&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment he caught sight of Quarrier, and the start he
gave was genuine enough. Never had he seen in a man's visage such
white concentration of anger.</p>

<p>"Quarrier!" he stammered, for his acting was becoming real enough
to supplant art.</p>

<p>Quarrier had risen; his narrowing eyes moved from Mortimer to
Lydia, then reverted to the man in the combination.</p>

<p>"Rather unexpected, isn't it?" said Mortimer, staring at Quarrier.</p>

<p>"Is it?" returned Quarrier in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," sneered Mortimer. "Did you expect to find me
here?"</p>

<p>"No. Did you expect to find me?" asked the other, with emphasis
unmistakable.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Mortimer hoarsely. "What the devil
do you mean by asking me if I expected to find you here? If I
had, I'd not have travelled down to your office to-day to see
you; I'd have come here for you. Naturally people suppose that
an engaged man is likely to give up this sort of thing."</p>

<p>Quarrier, motionless, white to the lips, turned his eyes from
one to the other.</p>

<p>"It doesn't look very well, does it?" asked Mortimer; and he
stood there, smiling, danger written all over him. "It's beginning
rather early," he continued, with a sneer. "Most engaged men with
a conscience wait until they're married before they return to
the gay and frivolous. But here you are, it seems, handsome, jolly,
and irresistible as ever!"</p>

<p>Quarrier looked at Lydia, and his lips moved: "You asked me to
come," he said.</p>

<p>"No; you offered to. I wished to talk to you over the wire, but
"&mdash;her lip curled, and she shrugged her shoulders&mdash;"you seemed
to be afraid of something or other."</p>

<p>"I couldn't talk to you in my own house, with guests in the room."</p>

<p>"Why not? Did I say anything your fashionable guests might take
exception to? Am I likely to do anything of that kind?&mdash;you coward!"</p>

<p>Quarrier stood very still, then noiselessly turned and made one
step toward the door.</p>

<p>"One moment," interposed Mortimer blandly. "As long as I travelled
down town to see you, and find you here so unexpectedly, I may
as well take advantage of this opportunity to regulate a little
matter. You don't mind our talking shop for a moment, Lydia? Thank
you. It's just a little business matter between Mr. Quarrier and
myself&mdash;a matter concerning a few shares of stock which I once
held in one of his companies, bought at par, and tumbled to ten
and &mdash;What is the fraction, Quarrier? I forget."</p>

<p>Quarrier thought deeply for a moment; then he raised his head,
looking full at Mortimer, and under his silky beard an edge of
teeth glimmered. "Did you wish me to take back those shares at
par?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Exactly! I knew you would! I knew you'd see it in that way!"
cried Mortimer heartily. "Confound it all, Quarrier, I've always
said you were that sort of man&mdash;that you'd never let a friend
in on the top floor, and kick him clear to the cellar! As a matter
of fact, I sold out at ten and three-eighths. Wait! Here's a pencil.
Lydia, give me that pad on your desk. Here you are, Quarrier.
It's easy enough to figure out how much you owe me."</p>

<p>And as Quarrier slowly began tracing figures on the pad, Mortimer
rambled on, growing more demonstrative and boisterous every moment.
"It's white of you, Quarrier &mdash;I'll say that! Legally, of
course, you could laugh at me; but I've always said your business
conscience would never let you stand for this sort of thing. 'You
can talk and talk,' I've told people, many a time, 'but you'll
never convince me that Howard Quarrier hasn't a heart.' No, by
jinks! they couldn't make me believe it. And here's my proof&mdash;here's
my vindication! Lydia, would you mind hunting up that cheque-book
I left here before dinn&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had made a mistake. The girl flushed. He choked up, and cast
a startled glance at Quarrier. But Quarrier, if he heard, made
no motion of understanding. Perhaps it had not been necessary
to convince him of the conspiracy.</p>

<p>When he had finished his figures he reviewed them, tracing each
total with his pencil's point; then quietly handed the pad to
Mortimer who went over it, and nodded that it was correct.</p>

<p>Lydia rose. Quarrier said, without looking at her: "I have a
blank cheque with me. May I use one of these pens?"</p>

<p>So he had brought a cheque! Had he supposed that a cheque might
be necessary when Lydia called him up? Was he prepared to meet
any demand of hers, too, even before Mortimer appeared on the
scene?</p>

<p>"As long as you have a cheque with you, Howard," said Lydia quietly,
"suppose you simply add to Mr. Mortimer's amount what you had
intended to offer me?"</p>

<p>He stared at her without answering.</p>

<p>"That little remembrance for old time's sake. Don't you recollect?"</p>

<p>"No," said Quarrier.</p>

<p>"Why, Howard! Didn't you promise me all sorts of things when
I wanted to go to your friend Mr. Siward, and explain that it
was not his fault I got into the Patroons Club? Don't you remember
I felt dreadfully that he was expelled&mdash;that I was simply wild
to write to the governors and tell them how I took Merkle's clothes
and drove to the club and waited until I saw a lot of men go in,
and then crowded in with the push?"</p>

<p>Mortimer was staring at Quarrier out of his protruding eyes.
The girl leaned forward, deliberate, self-possessed, the red lips
edged with growing scorn.</p>

<p>"That was a dirty trick!" said Mortimer heavily. He took the
pad, added a figure, passed it to Lydia, and she coolly wrote
a total, underscoring it heavily.</p>

<p>"That is the amount," she said.</p>

<p>Quarrier looked at the pad which she had tossed upon the desk.
Then he slowly wetted his pen with ink, and, laying the loose
cheque flat, began to fill it in. Afterward he dried it, and,
reading it carefully, pushed it aside and rose.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be advisable for you to stop payment, you know,"
observed Mortimer insolently, lying back in his chair and stretching
his legs.</p>

<p>"I know," said Quarrier, pausing to turn on them a deathly stare.
Then he went away. After awhile they heard the door close. But
there was no sound from the electric hansom, and Mortimer rose
and walked to the window.</p>

<p>"He's gone," he said.</p>

<p>Lydia stood at the desk, examining the cheque.</p>

<p>"We ought to afford a decent touring-car now," she suggested&mdash;"like
that yellow and black Serin-Chanteur car of Mr. Plank's."</p>
