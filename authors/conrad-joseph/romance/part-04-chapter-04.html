<p>They did not suspect how close I was to them. And their temper
struck me at once as unsafe. They seemed very much on the alert,
and, as I imagined, disposed to precipitate action. I called out,
deadening my voice warily:</p>

<p>"I am an Englishman, escaping from the pirates here. We want
your help."</p>

<p>To this no answer was made, but by that time the captain had
come on deck. The dinghy must have drifted in a little closer,
for I made out behind the shadowy rail one, two, three figures
in a row, looming bulkily above my head, as men appear enlarged
in mist.</p>

<p>"'Englishman,' he says." "That's very likely," pronounced a new
voice. They held a hurried consultation up there, of which I caught
only detached sentences, and the general tone of concern. "It's
perfectly well known that there <em>is</em> an Englishman here....
Aye, a runaway second mate.... Killed a man in a Bristol ship....
What was his name, now?"</p>

<p>"Won't you answer me?" I called out.</p>

<p>"Aye, we will answer you as soon as we see you.... Keep your
eyes skinned fore and aft on deck there.... Ready, boys?"</p>

<p>"All ready, sir"; voices came from further off.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," I entreated.</p>

<p>Someone called out briskly, "This is a bad place for pretty tales
of Englishmen in distress. We know very well where we are."</p>

<p>"You are off Rio Medio," I began anxiously; "and I<hr>"</p>

<p>"Speaks the truth like a Briton, anyhow," commented a lazy drawl.</p>

<p>"I would send another man to the pump," a reflective voice suggested.
"To make sure of the force, Mr. Sebright, you know."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir.... Another hand to the brakes, bo'sun."</p>

<p>"I have been held captive on shore," I said. "I escaped this
evening, three hours ago."</p>

<p>"And found this ship in the fog? You made a good shot at it,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"It's no time for trifling, I swear to you," I continued. "They
are out looking for you, in force. I've heard them. I was with
them when they started."</p>

<p>"I believe you."</p>

<p>"They seem to have missed the ship."</p>

<p>"So you came to have a friendly chat meantime. That's kind. Beastly
weather, aint it?"</p>

<p>"I want to come aboard," I shouted. "You must be crazy not to
believe me."</p>

<p>"But we do believe every single word you say," bantered the Sebright
voice with serenity.</p>

<p>Suddenly another struck in, "Nichols, I call to mind, sir."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course. This is the man."</p>

<p>"My name's not Nichols," I protested.</p>

<p>"Now, now. You mustn't begin to lie," remonstrated Sebright.
Somebody laughed discreetly.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, on my honour," I said. "Nichols left Rio Medio
some time ago."</p>

<p>"About three hours, eh?" came the drawl of insufferable folly
in these precious minutes.</p>

<p>It was clear that Manuel had gone astray, but I feared not for
long. They would spread out in search. And now I had found this
hopeless ship, it seemed impossible that anybody else could miss
her.</p>

<p>"You may be boarded any moment by more than a dozen boats. I
warn you solemnly. Will you let me come?"</p>

<p>A low whistle was heard on board. They were impressed, "Why should
he tell us this?" an undertone inquired.</p>

<p>"Why the devil shouldn't he? It's no great news, is it? Some
scoundrelly trick. This man's up to any dodge. Why, the '<em>Jane</em>'
was taken in broad day by two boats that pretended they were going
to sell vegetables."</p>

<p>"Look out, or by heavens you'll be taken by surprise. There's
a lot of them," I said as impressively as I could.</p>

<p>"Look out, look out. There's a lot of them," someone yelled in
a sort of panic.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's your game," Sebright's voice said to me. "Frighten
us, eh? Never you mind what this skunk says, men. Stand fast.
We shall take a lot of killing." He was answered by a sort of
pugnacious uproar, a clash of cutlasses and laughter, as if at
some joke.</p>

<p>"That's right, boys; mind and send them away with clean faces,
you gunners. Jack, you keep a good lookout for that poor distressed
Englishman. What's that? a noise in the fog? Stand by. Now then,
cook!..."</p>

<p>"All ready to dish up, sir," a voice answered him.</p>

<p>It was like a sort of madness. Were they thinking of eating?
Even at that the English talk made my heart expand&mdash;the homeliness
of it. I seemed to know all their voices, as if I had talked to
each man before. It brought back memories, like the voices of
friends.</p>

<p>But there was the strange irrelevancy, levity, the enmity&mdash;the
irrational, baffling nature of the anguishing conversation, as
if with the unapproachable men we meet in nightmares.</p>

<p>We in the dinghy, as well as those on board, were listening anxiously.
A profound silence reigned for a time.</p>

<p>"I don't care for myself," I tried once more, speaking distinctly.
"But a lady in the boat here is in great danger, too. Won't you
do something for a woman?"</p>

<p>I perceived, from the sort of stir on board, that this caused
some sensation.</p>

<p>"Or is the whole ship's company afraid to let one little boat
come alongside?" I added, after waiting for an answer.</p>

<p>A throat was cleared on board mildly, "Hem... you see, we don't
know who you are."</p>

<p>"I've told you who I am. The lady is Spanish."</p>

<p>"Just so. But there are Englishmen and Englishmen in these days.
Some of them keep very bad company ashore, and others afloat.
I couldn't think of taking you on board, unless I know something
more of you."</p>

<p>I seemed to detect an intention of malice in the mild voice.
The more so that I overheard a rapid interchange of mutterings
up there. "See him yet?" "Not a thing, sir." "Wait, I say."</p>

<p>Nothing could overcome the fixed idea of these men, who seemed
to enjoy so much the cleverness of their suspicions. It was the
most dangerous of tempers to deal with. It made them as untrustworthy
as so many lunatics. They were capable of anything, of decoying
us alongside, and stoving the bottom out of the boat, and drowning
us before they discovered their mistake, if they ever did. Even
as it was, there was danger; and yet I was extremely loath to
give her up. It was impossible to give her up. But what were we
to do? What to say? How to act?</p>

<p>"Castro, this is horrible," I said blankly. That he was beginning
to chafe, to fret, and shuffle his feet only added to my dismay.
He might begin at any moment to swear in Spanish, and that was
sure to bring a shower of lead, blind, fired blindly. "We have
nothing to expect from the people of that ship. We cannot even
get on board."</p>

<p>"Not without Manuel's help, it seems," he said bitterly. "Strange,
is it not, Señor? Your countrymen&mdash;your excellent and virtuous
countrymen. Generous and courageous and perspicacious."</p>

<p>Seraphina said suddenly, "They have reason. It is well for them
to be suspicious of us in this place." She had a tone of calm
reproof, and of faith.</p>

<p>"They shall be of more use when they are dead," Castro muttered.
"The senor's other dead countrymen served us well."</p>

<p>"I shall give you great, very great sums of money," Seraphina
suddenly cried towards the ship. "I am the Señorita Seraphina
Riego."</p>

<p>"There is a woman&mdash;that's a woman's voice, I'll swear," I heard
them exclaim on board, and I cried again:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. There is a woman."</p>

<p>"I dare say. But where do you come in? You are a distressed Englishman,
aren't you?" a voice came back.</p>

<p>"You shall let us come up on your ship," Seraphina said. "I shall
come myself, alone &mdash;Seraphina Riego."</p>

<p>"Eh, what?" the voice asked.</p>

<p>I felt a little wind on the back of my head. There was desperate
hurry.</p>

<p>"We are escaping to get married," I called out. They were beginning
to shout orders on the ship. "Oh, you've come to the wrong shop.
A church is what you want for <em>that</em> trouble," the voice
called back brutally, through the other cries of orders to square
the yards.</p>

<p>I shouted again, but my voice must have been drowned in the creaking
of blocks and yards. They were alert enough for every chance of
getting away&mdash;for every flaw of wind. Already the ship was less
distinct, as if my eyes had grown dim. By the time a voice on
board her cried, "Belay,"  faintly, she had gone from my sight.
Then the puff of wind passed away, too, and left us more alone
than ever, with only the small disk of the moon poised vertically
above the mists.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Tomas Castro, after what seemed an eternity of
crestfallen silence.</p>

<p>He need not have spoken; there could be no doubt that Manuel
had lost himself, and my belief is that the ship had sailed right
into the midst of the flotilla. There was an unmistakable character
of surprise in the distant tumult that arose suddenly, and as
suddenly ceased for a space of a breath or two. "Now, Castro,"
I shouted. "Ha! <em>bueno!</em>"</p>

<p>We gave way with a vigour that seemed to lift the dinghy out
of the water. The uproar gathered volume and fierceness.</p>

<p>From the first it was a hand-to-hand contest, engaged in suddenly,
as if the assailants had at once managed to board in a body, and,
as it were, in one unanimous spring. No shots had been fired.
Too far to hear the blows, and seeing nothing as yet of the ship,
we seemed to be hastening towards a deadly struggle of voices,
of shadows with leathern throats; every cry heard in battle was
there&mdash;rage, encouragement, fury, hate, and pain. And those of
pain were amazingly distinct. They were yells; they were howls.
And suddenly, as we approached the ship, but before we could make
out any sign of her, we came upon a boat. We had to swerve to
clear her. She seemed to have dropped out of the fight in utter
disarray; she lay with no oars out, and full of men who writhed
and tumbled over each other, shrieking as if they had been flayed.
Above the writhing figures in the middle of the boat, a tall man,
upright in the stern-sheets, raved awful imprecations and shook
his fists above his head.</p>

<p>The blunt dinghy foamed past that vision within an oar's length,
no more, making straight for the clamour of the fight. The last
puff of wind must have thinned the fog in the ship's track; for,
standing up, face forward to pull stroke, I saw her come out,
stern-on to us, from truck to water-line, mistily tall and motionless,
but resounding with the most fierce and desperate noises. A cluster
of empty boats clung low to her port side, raft-like and vague
on the water.</p>

<p>We heard now, mingled with the fury and hate of shouts reverberating
from the placid sails, mighty thuds and crashes, as though it
had been a combat with clubs and battle-axes.</p>

<p>Evidently, in the surprise and haste of the unexpected coming
together, they had been obliged to board all on the same side.
As I headed for the other a big boat, full of men, with many oars,
shot across our bows, and vanished round the ship's counter in
the twinkling of an eye. The defenders, engaged on the port side,
were going to be taken in the rear. We were then so close to the
counter that the cries of "Death, death,"  rang over our heads.
A voice on the poop said furiously in English, "Stand fast, men."
Next moment, we, too, rounded the quarter only twenty feet behind
the big boat, but with a slightly wider sweep.</p>

<p>I said, "Have the pistols ready, Seraphina." And she answered
quite steadily:</p>

<p>"They are ready, Juan."</p>

<p>I could not have believed that any handiwork of man afloat could
have got so much way through the water. To this very day I am
not rid of the absurd impression that, at that particular moment,
the dinghy was travelling with us as fast as a cannon-ball. No
sooner round than we were upon them. We were upon them so fast
that I had barely the time to fling away my oar, and close my
grip on the butt of the pistols Seraphina pressed into my hand
from behind. Castro, too, had dropped his oar, and, turning as
swift as a cat, crouched in the bows. I saw his good arm darting
out towards their boat.</p>

<p>They had cast a grapnel cleverly, and, swung abreast of the main
chains, were grimly busied in boarding the undefended side in
silence. One had already his leg over the ship's rail, and below
him three more were clambering resolutely, one above the other.
The rest of them, standing up in a body with their faces to the
ship, were so oblivious of everything in their purpose, that they
staggered all together to the shock of the dinghy, heavily, as
if the earth had reeled under them.</p>

<p>Castro knew what he was doing. I saw his only hand hop along
the gunwale, dragging our cockle-shell forward very swiftly. The
tottering Spaniards turned their heads, and for a moment we looked
at each other in silence.</p>

<p>I was too excited to shout; the surprise seemed to have deprived
them of their senses, and they all had the same grin of teeth
closed upon the naked blades of their knives, the same stupid
stare fastened upon my eyes. I pulled the trigger in the nearest
face, and the terrific din of the fight going on above us was
overpowered by the report of the pistol, as if by a clap of thunder.
The man's gaping mouth dropped the knife, and he stood stiffly
long enough for the thought, "I've missed him," to flash through
my mind before he tumbled clean out of the boat without touching
anything, like a wooden dummy tipped by the heels. His headlong
fall sent the water flying high over the stern of the dinghy.
With the second barrel I took a long shot at the man sitting amazed,
astride of the rail above. I saw him double up suddenly, and fall
inboard sideways, but the fellow following him made a convulsive
effort, and leapt out of sight on to the deck of the ship. I dropped
the discharged weapon, and fired the first barrel of the other
at the upper of the two men clinging halfway up the ship's side.
To that one shot they both vanished as if by enchantment, the
fellow I had hit knocking off his friend below. The crash of their
fall was followed by a great yell.</p>

<p>These had been all nearly point-blank shots, and, anyhow, I had
had a good deal of pistol practice. Macdonald had a little gallery
at Horton Pen. The <em>Lugareños</em>, huddled together in the
boat, were only able to moan with terror. They made soft, pitiful,
complaining noises. Two or three took headers overboard, like
so many frogs, and then one began to squeak exactly like a rat.</p>

<p>By that time, Castro, with his fixed blade, had cut their grapnel
rope close to the ring. As the ship kept forging ahead all the
time, the boat of the pirate bumped away lightly from between
the vessel and our dinghy, and we remained alongside, holding
to the end of the severed line. I sent my fourth shot after them
and got in exchange a scream and a howl of "Mercy! mercy! we surrender!"
She swung clear of the quarter, all hushed, and faded into the
mist and moonlight, with the head and arms of a motionless man
hanging grotesquely over the bows.</p>

<p>Leaving Seraphina with Castro, and sticking the remaining pair
of pistols in my belt, I swarmed up the rope. The moon, the lights
of several lanthorns, the glare from the open doors, mingled violently
in the steamy fog between the high bulwarks of the ship. But the
character of the contest was changing, even as I paused on the
rail to get my bearings. The fellow who had leapt on board to
escape my shot had bolted across the deck to his friends on the
other side, yelling:</p>

<p>"Fly, fly! The heretics are coming, shooting from the sea. All
is lost. Fly, oh fly!"</p>

<p>He had jumped straight overboard, but the infection of his panic
was already visible. The cries of "<em>Muerte, muerte!</em> Death,
death!" had ceased, and the Englishmen were cheering ferociously.
In a moment, under my eyes, the seamen, who had been holding their
own with difficulty in a shower of defensive blows, began to dart
forward, striking out with their fists, catching with their hands.
I jumped upon the main hatch, and found myself in the skirt ef
the final rush.</p>

<p>A tall <em>Lugareño</em> had possessed himself of one of the
ship's capstan bars, and, less craven than the others, was flourishing
it on high, aiming at the head of a sailor engaged in throttling
a negro whom he held at the full length of his immense arms. I
fired, and the <em>Lugareño</em> tumbled down with all the appearance
of having knocked himself over with the bar he had that moment
uplifted. It rested across his neck as he lay stretched at my
feet.</p>

<p>I was not able to effect anything more after this, because the
sailor, after rushing his limp antagonist overboard with terrific
force, turned raging for more, caught sight of me&mdash;an evident
stranger&mdash;and flew at my throat. He was English, but as he squeezed
my windpipe so hard that I couldn't utter a word I brought the
butt of my pistol upon his thick skull without the slightest compunction,
for, indeed, I had to deal with a powerful man, well able to strangle
me with his bare hands, and very determined to achieve the feat.
He grunted under the blow, reeled away a few steps, then, charging
back at once, gripped me round the body, and tried to lift me
off my feet. We fell together into a warm puddle.</p>

<p>I had no idea spilt blood kept its warmth so much. And the quantity
of it was appalling; the deck seemed to swim with gore, and we
simply weltered in it. We rolled rapidly along the reeking scuppers,
amongst the feet of a lot of men who were hopping about us in
the greatest excitement, the hearty thuds of blows, aimed with
all sorts of weapons, just missing my head. The pistol was kicked
out of my hand.</p>

<p>The horror of my position was very great. Must I kill the man?
must I die myself in this miserable and senseless manner? I tried
to shout, "Drag this maniac off me."</p>

<p>He was pinning my arms to my body. I saw the furious faces bending
over me, the many hands murderously uplifted. They, of course,
couldn't tell that I wasn't one of the men who had boarded them,
and my life had never been in such jeopardy. I felt all the fury
of rage and mortification. Was I to die like this, villainously
trodden underfoot, on the threshold of safety, of liberty, of
love? And, in those moments of violent struggle I saw, as one
sees in moments of wisdom and meditation, my soul&mdash;all life, lying
under the shadow of a perfidious destiny. And Seraphina was there
in the boat, waiting for me. The sea! The boat! They were in another
land, and I, I should no more.... never any more.... A sharp voice
called, "Back there, men. Steady. Take him alive." They dragged
me up.</p>

<p>I needn't relate by what steps, from being terribly handled as
a captive, I was promoted to having my arms shaken off in the
character of a saviour. But I got any amount of praise at last,
though I was terribly out of breath&mdash;at the very last gasp, as
you might say. A man, smooth-faced, well-knit, very elated and
buoyant, began talking to me endlessly. He was mighty happy, and
anyhow he could talk to me, because I was past doing anything
but taking a moment's rest. He said I had come in the nick of
time, and was quite the best of fellows.</p>

<p>"If you had a fancy to be called the Archbishop of Canterbury,
we'd 'your Grace' you. I am the mate, Sebright. The captain's
gone in to show himself to the missus; she wouldn't like to have
him too much chipped.... Wonderful is the love of woman. She sat
up a bit later to-night with her fancy-sewing to see what might
turn up. I told her at tea-time she had better go in early and
shut her stateroom door, because if any of the Dagos chanced to
come aboard, I couldn't be responsible for the language of my
crowd. We are supposed to keep clear of profanity this trip, she
being a niece of Mr. Perkins of Bristol, our owner, and a Methodist.
But, hang it all, there's reason in all things. You can't have
a ship like a chapel&mdash;though <em>she</em> would. Oh, bless you,
she would, even when we're beating off these picaroons."</p>

<p>I was sitting on the afterhatch, and leaning my head on my arms.</p>

<p>"Feel bad? Do you? Handled you like a bag of shavings. Well,
the boys got their monkey up, hammering the Dagos. Here you, Mike,
go look along the deck, for a double-barrelled pistol. Move yourself
a bit. Feel along under the spars."</p>

<p>There was something authoritative and knowing in his personality;
boyishly elated and full of business.</p>

<p>"We must put the ship to rights. You don't think they'd come
back for another taste? The blessed old deck's afloat. That's
my little dodge, boiling water for these Dagos, if they come.
So I got the cook to fire up, and we put the suction-hose of the
fire pump into the boiler, and we filled the coppers and the kettles.
Not a bad notion, eh? But ten times as much wouldn't have been
enough, and the hose burst at the third stroke, so that only one
boat got anything to speak of. But Lord, <em>she</em> dropped
out of the ruck as if she'd been swept with langridge. Squealed
like a litter of pigs, didn't they?"</p>

<p>What I had taken for blood had been the water from the burst
hose. I must say I was relieved. My new friend babbled any amount
of joyous information into me before I quite got my wind back.
He rubbed his hands and clapped me on the shoulder. But his heart
was kind, and he became concerned at my collapsed state.</p>

<p>"I say, you don't think my chaps broke some of your ribs, do
you? Let me feel."</p>

<p>And then I managed to tell him something of Seraphina that he
would listen to.</p>

<p>"What, what?" he said. "Oh, heavens and earth! there's your girl.
Of course.... Hey, bo'sun, rig a whip and chair on the yardarm
to take a lady on board. Bear a hand. A lady! yes, a lady. Confound
it, don't lose your wits, man. Look over the starboard rail, and
you will see a lady alongside with a Dago in a small boat. Let
the Dago come on board, too; the gentleman here says he's a good
sort. Now, do you understand?"</p>

<p>He talked to me a good deal more; told me that they had made
a prisoner&mdash;"a tall, comical chap; wears his hair like an old
aunt of mine, a bunch of curls flapping on each side of his face"&mdash;and
then said that he must go and report to Captain Williams, who
had gone into his wife's stateroom. The name struck me. I said:</p>

<p>"Is this ship the <em>Lion?</em>"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye. That's her. She is," several seamen answered together,
casting curious glances from their work.</p>

<p>"Tell your captain my name is Kemp," I shouted after Sebright
with what strength of lung I had.</p>

<p>What luck! Williams was the jolly little ship's captain I was
to have dined with on the day of execution on Kingston Point&mdash;the
day I had been kidnapped. It seemed ages ago. I wanted to get
to the side to look after Seraphina, but I simply couldn't remember
how to stand. I sat on the hatch, looking at the seamen.</p>

<p>They were clearing the ropes, collecting the lamps, picking up
knives, handspikes, crowbars, swabbing the decks with squashy
flaps. A bare-footed, bare-armed fellow, holding a bundle of brass-hilted
cutlasses under his arm, had lost himself in the contemplation
of my person.</p>

<p>"Where are you bound to?" I inquired at large, and everybody
showed a friendly alacrity in answer.</p>

<p>"Havana." "Havana, sir." "Havana's our next port. Aye, Havana."</p>

<p>The deck rang with modulations of the name.</p>

<p>I heard a loud, "Alas," sighed out behind me. A distracted, stricken
voice repeated twice in Spanish, "Oh, my greatness; oh, my greatness." 
Then, shiveringly, in a tone of profound self-communion, "I have
a greatly parched throat," it said. Harshly jovial voices answered:</p>

<p>"Stow your lingo and come before the captain. Step along."</p>

<p>A prisoner, conducted aft, stalked reluctantly into the light
between two short, bustling sailors. Dishevelled black hair like
a damaged peruke, mournful, yellow face, enormous stag's eyes
straining down on me. I recognized Manuel-del-Popolo. At the same
moment he sprang back, shrieking, "This is a miracle of the devil&mdash;of
the devil."</p>

<p>The sailors fell to tugging at his arms savagely, asking, "What's
come to you?" and, after a short struggle that shook his tatters
and his raven locks tempestuously like a gust of wind, he submitted
to be walked up repeating:</p>

<p>"Is it you, Señor? Is it you? Is it <em>you?</em>"</p>

<p>One of his shoulders was bare from neck to elbow; at every step
one of his knees and part of a lean thigh protruded their nakedness
through a large rent; a strip of grimy, blood-stained linen, torn
right down to the waist, dangled solemnly in front of his legs.
There was a horrible raw patch amongst the roots of his hair just
above his temple; there was blood in his nostrils, the stamp of
excessive anguish on his features, a sort of guarded despair in
his eye. His voice sank while he said again, twice:</p>

<p>"Is it you? Is it you?" And then, for the last time, "Is it you?"
he repeated in a whisper.</p>

<p>The seamen formed a wide ring, and, looking at me, he talked
to himself confidentially.</p>

<p>"Escaped&mdash;the <em>Inglez!</em> Then thou art doomed, Domingo.
Domingo, thou art doomed. Dom... Señor!"</p>

<p>The change of tone, his effort to extend his hands towards me,
surprised us all. I looked away.</p>

<p>"Hold hard! Hold him, mate!"</p>

<p>"Señor, condescend to behold my downfall. I am led here to the
slaughter, Señor! To the slaughter, Señor! Pity! Grace! Mercy!
And only a short while ago&mdash;behold. Slaughter... <em>I... </em>Manuel.
Señor, I am universally admired&mdash;with a parched throat, Señor.
I could compose a song that would make a priest weep.... A greatly
parched throat, Señor," he added piteously.</p>

<p>I could not help turning my head. I had not been used half as
hard as he. It was enough to look at him to believe in the dryness
of his throat. Under the matted mass of his hair, he was grinning
in amiable agony, and his globular eyes yearned upon me with a
motionless and glassy lustre.</p>

<p>"You have not forgotten me, Señor? Forget Manuel! Impossible!
Manuel, Señor. For the love of God. Manuel. Manuel-del-Popolo.
I did sing, deign to remember. I offered you my fidelity, Señor.
As you are a <em>caballero</em>, I charge you to remember. Save
me, Señor. Speak to those men.... For the sake of your honour,
Señor."</p>

<p>His voice was extraordinarily harsh&mdash;not his own. Apparently,
he believed that he was going to be cut to pieces there and then
by the sailors. He seemed to read it in their faces, shuddering
and shrinking whenever he raised his eyes. But all these faces
gaped with good-natured wonder, except the faces of his two guardians,
and these expressed a state of conscientious worry. They were
ridiculously anxious to suppress his sudden contortions, as one
would some gross indecency. In the scuffle they hissed and swore
under their breath. They were scandalized and made unhappy by
his behaviour.</p>

<p>"Are you ready down there?" roared the bo'sun in the waist.</p>

<p>"Olla raight! Olla raight! Waita a leetle," I heard Castro's
voice coming, as if from under the ship. I said coldly a few words
about the certain punishment awaiting a pirate in Havana, and
got on to my feet stiffly. But Manuel was too terrified to understand
what I meant. He attempted to snatch at me with his imprisoned
hands, and got for his pains a severe jerking, which made his
head roll about his shoulders weirdly.</p>

<p>"Pity, Señor!" he screamed. And then, with low fervour, "Don't
go away. Listen! I am profound. Perhaps the Señor did not know
that? Mercy! I am a man of intrigue. A <em>politico</em>. You
have escaped, and I rejoice at it."... He bared his fangs, and
frothed like a mad dog.... "Señor, I am made happy because of
the love I bore you from the first&mdash;and Domingo, who let you slip
out of the Casa, is doomed. He is doomed. Thou art doomed, Domingo!
But the excessive affection for your noble person inspires my
intellect with a salutary combination. Wait, Señor! A moment!
An instant!... A combination!..."</p>

<p>He gasped as though his heart had burst. The seamen, open-mouthed,
were slowly narrowing their circle.</p>

<p>"Can't he gabble!" remarked someone patiently.</p>

<p>His eyes were starting out of his head. He spoke with fearful
rapidity.</p>

<p>"... There's no refuge from the anger of the <em>Juez</em> but
the grave&mdash;the grave&mdash;the grave!... Ha! ha! Go into thy grave,
Domingo. But you, Señor&mdash;listen to my supplications&mdash;where will
you go? To Havana. The <em>Juez</em> is there, and I call the
malediction of the priests on my head if you, too, are not doomed.
Life! Liberty! Señor, let me go, and I shall run&mdash;I shall ride,
Señor &mdash;I shall throw myself at the feet of the <em>Juez</em>,
and say... I shall say I killed you. I am greatly trusted by the
reason of my superior intelligence. I shall say, 'Domingo let
him go&mdash;but he is dead. Think of him no more&mdash;of that <em>Inglez</em>
who escaped&mdash;from Domingo. Do not look for him. I, your own Manuel,
have killed him.' Give me my life for yours, Señor. I shall swear
I had killed you with this right hand! Ah!"</p>

<p>He hung on my lips breathless, with a face so distorted that,
though it might have been death alone he hated, he looked, indeed,
as if impatient to set to and tear me to pieces with his long
teeth. Men clutching at straws must have faces thus convulsed
by an eager and despairing hope. His silence removed the spell&mdash;the
spell of his incredible loquacity. I heard the boatswain's hoarse
tones:</p>

<p>"Hold on well, ma'am. Right! Walk away steady with that whip!"</p>

<p>I ran limping forward.</p>

<p>"High enough," he rumbled; and I received Seraphina into my arms.</p>
