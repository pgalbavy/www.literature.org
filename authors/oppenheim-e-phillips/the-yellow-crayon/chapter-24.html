<P>
A barely furnished man's room, comfortable, austere, scholarly.
The refuge of a busy man, to judge by the piles of books and papers
which littered the large open writing-table.  There were despatch
boxes turned upside down, a sea of parchment and foolscap.  In the
midst of it all a man deep in thought.
<P>
A visitor, entering with the freedom of an old acquaintance, laid
his hand upon his shoulder and greeted him with an air of suppressed enthusiasm.
<P>
"Planning the campaign, eh, Brott?  Or is that a handbook to Court
etiquette?  You will need it within the week.  There are all sorts
of rumours at the clubs."
<P>
Brott shook himself free from his fit of apathetic reflection.  He
would not have dared to tell his visitor where his thoughts had
been for the last half hour.
<P>
"Somehow," he said, "I do not think that little trip to Windsor
will come just yet.  The King will never send for me unless he is
compelled."
<P>
His visitor, an ex-Cabinet Minister, a pronounced Radical and a
lifelong friend of Brott's, shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"That time," he said, "is very close at hand.  He will send for
Letheringham first, of course, and great pressure will be brought
to bear upon him to form a ministry.  But without you he will be
helpless.  He has not the confidence of the people."
<P>
"Without me," Brott repeated slowly.  "You think then that I should
not accept office with Letheringham?"
<P>
His visitor regarded him steadily for a moment, open-mouthed,
obviously taken aback.
<P>
"Brott, are you in your right senses?" he asked incredulously.  "Do
you know what you are saying?"
<P>
Brott laughed a little nervously.
<P>
"This is a great issue, Grahame," he said.  "I will confess that I
am in an undecided state.  I am not sure that the country is in a
sufficiently advanced state for our propaganda.  Is this really our
opportunity, or is it only the shadow of what is to come thrown
before?  If we show our hand too soon all is lost for this
generation.  Don't look at me as though I were insane, Grahame.
Remember that the country is only just free from a long era of
Conservative rule."
<P>
"The better our opportunity," Grahame answered vigorously.  "Two
decades of puppet government are enervating, I admit, but they
only pave the way more surely to the inevitable reaction.  What is
the matter with you, Brott?  Are you ill?  This is the great moment
of our lives.  You must speak at Manchester and Birmingham within
this week.  Glasgow is already preparing for you.  Everything and
everybody waits for your judgment.  Good God, man, it's magnificent!
Where's your enthusiasm?  Within a month you must be Prime Minister,
and we will show the world the way to a new era."
<P>
Brott sat quite still.  His friend's words had stirred him for the
moment.  Yet he seemed the victim of a curious indecision.  Grahame
leaned over towards him.
<P>
"Brott, old friend," he said, "you are not ill?"
<P>
Brott shook his head.
<P>
"I am perfectly well," he said.
<P>
Grahame hesitated.
<P>
"It is a delicate thing to mention," he said.  "Perhaps I shall
pass even the bounds of our old comradeship.  But you have changed.
Something is wrong with you.  What is it?"
<P>
"There is nothing," Brott answered, looking up.  "It is your fancy.
I am well enough."
<P>
Grahame's face was dark with anxiety.
<P>
"This is no idle curiosity of mine," he said.  "You know me better
than that.  But the cause which is nearer my heart than life itself
is at stake.  Brott, you are the people's man, their promised
redeemer.  Think of them, the toilers, the oppressed, God's
children, groaning under the iniquitous laws of generations of evil
statesmanship.  It is the dawn of their new day, their faces are
turned to you.  Man, can't you hear them crying?  You can't fail
them.  You mustn't.  I don't know what is the matter with you,
Brott, but away with it.  Free yourself, man."
<P>
Brott sighed wearily, but already there was a change in him.  His
face was hardening - the lines in his face deepened.  Grahame
continued hastily - eagerly.
<P>
"Public men," he said, "are always at the mercy of the halfpenny
press, but you know, Brott, your appearance so often in Society
lately has set men's tongues wagging.  There is no harm done, but
it is time to stop them.  You are right to want to understand these
people.  You must go down amongst them.  It has been slumming in
Mayfair for you, I know.  But have done with it now.  It is these
people we are going to fight.  Let it be open war.  Let them hear
your programme at Glasgow.  We don't want another French Revolution,
but it is going to be war against the drones, fierce, merciless war!
You must break with them, Brott, once and for ever.  And the time
is now."
<P>
Brott held out his hand across the table.  No one but this one man
could have read the struggle in his face.
<P>
"You are right, Grahame.  I thank you.  I thank you as much for
what you have left unsaid as for what you have said.  I was a fool
to think of compromising.  Letheringham is a nerveless leader.  We
should have gone pottering on for another seven years.  Thank God
that you came when you did.  See here!"
<P>
He tossed him over a letter.  Grahame's cheek paled as he read.
<P>
"Already!" he murmured.
<P>
Brott nodded.
<P>
"Read it!"
<P>
Grahame devoured every word.  His eyes lit up with excitement.
<P>
"My prophecy exactly," he exclaimed, laying it down.  "It is as I
said.  He cannot form the ministry without you.  His letter is
abject.  He gives himself away.  It is an entreaty.  And your
answer?"
<P>
"Has not yet gone," Brott said.  "You shall write it yourself if
you like.  I am thankful that you came when you did."
<P>
"You were hesitating?" Grahame exclaimed.
<P>
"I was."
<P>
Grahame looked at him in wonder, and Brott faced him sturdily.
<P>
"It seems like treason to you, Grahame!" he said.  "So it does to
me now.  I want nothing in the future to come between us," he
continued more slowly, "and I should like if I can to expunge the
memory of this interview.  And so I am going to tell you the truth."
Grahame held out his hand.
<P>
"Don't!" he said.  "I can forget without."
<P>
I3rott shook his head.
<P>
"No," he said.  "You had better understand everything.  The
halfpenny press told the truth.  Yet only half the truth.  I have
been to all these places, wasted my time, wasted their time, from
a purely selfish reason - to be near the only woman I have ever
cared for, the woman, Grahame!"
<P>
"I knew it," Grahame murmured.  "I fought against the belief, I
thought that I had stifled it.  But I knew it all the time."
<P>
"If I have seemed lukewarm sometimes of late," Brott said, "there
is the cause.  She is an aristocrat, and my politics are hateful
to her.  She has told me so seriously, playfully, angrily.  She
has let me feel it in a hundred ways.  She has drawn me into
discussions and shown the utmost horror of my views.  I have cared
for her all my life, and she knows it.  And I think, Grahame, that
lately she has been trying constantly, persistently, to tone down
my opinions.  She has let me understand that they are a bar between
us.  And it is a horrible confession, Grahame, but I believe that
I was wavering.  This invitation from Letheringham seemed such a
wonderful opportunity for compromise."
<P>
"This must never go out of the room," Grahame said hoarsely.  "It
would ruin your popularity.  They would never trust you again.
<P>
"I shall tell no one else," Brott said.
<P>
"And it is over?" Grahame demanded eagerly.
<P>
"It is over."
<P>

<P>
The Duke of Dorset, who entertained for his party, gave a great
dinner that night at Dorset House, and towards its close the
Prince of Saxe Leinitzer, who was almost the only non-political
guest, moved up to his host in response to an eager summons.  The
Duke was perturbed.
<P>
"You have heard the news, Saxe Leinitzer?"
<P>
"I did not know of any news," the Prince answered.  "What is it?"
<P>
"Brott has refused to join with Letheringham in forming a ministry.
It is rumoured even that a coalition was proposed, and that Brott
would have nothing to do with it."
<P>
The Prince looked into his wineglass.
<P>
"Ah!" he said.
<P>
"This is disturbing news," the Duke continued.  You do not seem to
appreciate its significance."
<P>
The Prince looked up again.
<P>
"Perhaps not," he said.  "You shall explain to me."
<P>
"Brott refuses to compromise," the Duke said.  "He stands for a
ministry of his own selection.  Heaven only knows what mischief
this may mean.  His doctrines are thoroughly revolutionary.  He is
an iconoclast with a genius for destruction.  But he has the ear of
the people.  He is to-day their Rienzi."
<P>
The Prince nodded.
<P>
"And Lucille?" he remarked.  "What does she say?"
<P>
"I have not spoken to her," the Duke answered.  "The news has only
just come."
<P>
"We will speak to her," the Prince said, "together."
<P>
Afterwards in the library there was a sort of informal meeting, and
their opportunity came.  
<P>
"So you have failed, Countess," her host said, knitting his grey
brows at her.
<P>
She smilingly acknowledged defeat.
<P>
"But I can assure you," she said, "that I was very near success.
Only on Monday he had virtually made up his mind to abandon the
extreme party and cast in his lot with Letheringham.  What has
happened to change him I do not know."
<P>
The Prince curled his fair moustache.
<P>
"It is a pity," he said, "that he changed his mind.  For one thing
is very certain.  The Duke and I are agreed upon it.  A Brott
ministry must never be formed."
<P>
She looked up quickly.
<P>
"What do you mean?"
<P>
The Prince answered her without hesitation.
<P>
"If one course fails," he said, "another must be adopted.  I regret
having to make use of means which are somewhat clumsy and obvious.
But our pronouncement on this one point is final.  Brott must not
be allowed to form a ministry."
<P>
She looked at him with something like horror in her soft full eyes.
<P>
"What would you do?" she murmured.
<P>
The Prince shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"Well," he said, "we are not quite medieval enough to adopt the
only really sensible method and remove Mr. Brott permanently from
the face of the earth.  We should stop a little short of that, but
I can assure you that Mr. Brott's health for the next few months is
a matter for grave uncertainty.  It is a pity for his sake that you
failed."
<P>
She bit her lip.
<P>
"Do you know if he is still in London?" she asked.
<P>
"He must be on the point of leaving for Scotland," the Duke answered.
"If he once mounts the platform at Glasgow there will be no further
chance of any compromise.  He will be committed irretrievably to
his campaign of anarchy."
<P>
"And to his own disaster," the Prince murmured.
<P>
Lucille remained for a moment deep in thought.  Then she looked up.
<P>
"If I can find him before he starts," she said hurriedly, "I will
make one last effort."
