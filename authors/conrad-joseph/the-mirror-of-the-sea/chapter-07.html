<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p> <em>THE </em>other year, looking through a newspaper of sound
principles, but whose staff <em>will</em> persist in "casting"
anchors and going to sea "on" a ship (ough!), I came across an
article upon the season’s yachting.  And, behold! it was a good
article.  To a man who had but little to do with pleasure sailing
(though all sailing is a pleasure), and certainly nothing whatever
with racing in open waters, the writer’s strictures upon the handicapping
of yachts were just intelligible and no more.  And I do not pretend
to any interest in the enumeration of the great races of that
year.  As to the 52-foot linear raters, praised so much by the
writer, I am warmed up by his approval of their performances;
but, as far as any clear conception goes, the descriptive phrase,
so precise to the comprehension of a yachtsman, evokes no definite
image in my mind.</p>

<p>The writer praises that class of pleasure vessels, and I am willing
to endorse his words, as any man who loves every craft afloat
would be ready to do.  I am disposed to admire and respect the
52-foot linear raters on the word of a man who regrets in such
a sympathetic and understanding spirit the threatened decay of
yachting seamanship.</p>

<p>Of course, yacht racing is an organized pastime, a function of
social idleness ministering to the vanity of certain wealthy inhabitants
of these isles nearly as much as to their inborn love of the sea. 
But the writer of the article in question goes on to point out,
with insight and justice, that for a great number of people (20,000,
I think he says) it is a means of livelihood—that it is, in his
own words, an industry.  Now, the moral side of an industry, productive
or unproductive, the redeeming and ideal aspect of this bread-winning,
is the attainment and preservation of the highest possible skill
on the part of the craftsmen. Such skill, the skill of technique,
is more than honesty; it is something wider, embracing honesty
and grace and rule in an elevated and clear sentiment, not altogether
utilitarian, which may be called the honour of labour.  It is
made up of accumulated tradition, kept alive by individual pride,
rendered exact by professional opinion, and, like the higher arts,
it spurred on and sustained by discriminating praise.</p>

<p>This is why the attainment of proficiency, the pushing of your
skill with attention to the most delicate shades of excellence,
is a matter of vital concern.  Efficiency of a practically flawless
kind may be reached naturally in the struggle for bread.  But
there is something beyond—a higher point, a subtle and unmistakable
touch of love and pride beyond mere skill; almost an inspiration
which gives to all work that finish which is almost art—which
<em>is</em> art.</p>

<p>As men of scrupulous honour set up a high standard of public
conscience above the dead-level of an honest community, so men
of that skill which passes into art by ceaseless striving raise
the dead-level of correct practice in the crafts of land and sea. 
The conditions fostering the growth of that supreme, alive excellence,
as well in work as in play, ought to be preserved with a most
careful regard lest the industry or the game should perish of
an insidious and inward decay.  Therefore I have read with profound
regret, in that article upon the yachting season of a certain
year, that the seamanship on board racing yachts is not now what
it used to be only a few, very few, years ago.</p>

<p>For that was the gist of that article, written evidently by a
man who not only knows but <em>understands</em>—a thing (let me
remark in passing) much rarer than one would expect, because the
sort of understanding I mean is inspired by love; and love, though
in a sense it may be admitted to be stronger than death, is by
no means so universal and so sure.  In fact, love is rare—the
love of men, of things, of ideas, the love of perfected skill. 
For love is the enemy of haste; it takes count of passing days,
of men who pass away, of a fine art matured slowly in the course
of years and doomed in a short time to pass away too, and be no
more.  Love and regret go hand in hand in this world of changes
swifter than the shifting of the clouds reflected in the mirror
of the sea.</p>

<p>To penalize a yacht in proportion to the fineness of her performance
is unfair to the craft and to her men.  It is unfair to the perfection
of her form and to the skill of her servants.  For we men are,
in fact, the servants of our creations.  We remain in everlasting
bondage to the productions of our brain and to the work of our
hands.  A man is born to serve his time on this earth, and there
is something fine in the service being given on other grounds
than that of utility.  The bondage of art is very exacting.  And,
as the writer of the article which started this train of thought
says with lovable warmth, the sailing of yachts is a fine art.</p>

<p>His contention is that racing, without time allowances for anything
else but tonnage—that is, for size—has fostered the fine art of
sailing to the pitch of perfection.  Every sort of demand is made
upon the master of a sailing-yacht, and to be penalized in proportion
to your success may be of advantage to the sport itself, but it
has an obviously deteriorating effect upon the seamanship.  The
fine art is being lost.</p>
