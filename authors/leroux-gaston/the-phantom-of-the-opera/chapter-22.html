<p><em>THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE CONTINUED</em></p>

<p>We were in the middle of a little six-cornered room, the sides
of which were covered with mirrors from top to bottom.  In the
corners, we could clearly see the "joins" in the glasses, the
segments intended to turn on their gear; yes, I recognized them
and I recognized the iron tree in the corner, at the bottom of
one of those segments ... the iron tree, with its iron branch,
for the hanged men.</p>

<p>I seized my companion's arm:  the Vicomte de Chagny was all a-quiver,
eager to shout to his betrothed that he was bringing her help. 
I feared that he would not be able to contain himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly, we heard a noise on our left.  It sounded at first
like a door opening and shutting in the next room; and then there
was a dull moan.  I clutched M. de Chagny's arm more firmly still;
and then we distinctly heard these words:</p>

<p>"You must make your choice!  The wedding mass or the requiem
mass!" I recognized the voice of the monster.</p>

<p>There was another moan, followed by a long silence.</p>

<p>I was persuaded by now that the monster was unaware of our presence
in his house, for otherwise he would certainly have managed not
to let us hear him.  He would only have had to close the little
invisible window through which the torture-lovers look down into
the torture-chamber. Besides, I was certain that, if he had known
of our presence, the tortures would have begun at once.</p>

<p>The important thing was not to let him know; and I dreaded nothing
so much as the impulsiveness of the Vicomte de Chagny, who wanted
to rush through the walls to Christine Daae, whose moans we continued
to hear at intervals.</p>

<p>"The requiem mass is not at all gay," Erik's voice resumed, "whereas
the wedding mass&mdash;you can take my word for it&mdash;is magnificent! 
You must take a resolution and know your own mind!  I can't go
on living like this, like a mole in a burrow!  Don Juan Triumphant
is finished; and now I want to live like everybody else.  I want
to have a wife like everybody else and to take her out on Sundays. 
I have invented a mask that makes me look like anybody.  People
will not even turn round in the streets.  You will be the happiest
of women.  And we will sing, all by ourselves, till we swoon away
with delight.  You are crying!  You are afraid of me!  And yet
I am not really wicked.  Love me and you shall see!  All I wanted
was to be loved for myself.  If you loved me I should be as gentle
as a lamb; and you could do anything with me that you pleased."</p>

<p>Soon the moans that accompanied this sort of love's litany increased
and increased.  I have never heard anything more despairing; and
M. de Chagny and I recognized that this terrible lamentation came
from Erik himself.  Christine seemed to be standing dumb with
horror, without the strength to cry out, while the monster was
on his knees before her.</p>

<p>Three times over, Erik fiercely bewailed his fate:</p>

<p>"You don't love me!  You don't love me!  You don't love me!"</p>

<p>And then, more gently:</p>

<p>"Why do you cry?  You know it gives me pain to see you cry!"</p>

<p>A silence.</p>

<p>Each silence gave us fresh hope.  We said to ourselves:</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has left Christine behind the wall."</p>

<p>And we thought only of the possibility of warning Christine Daae
of our presence, unknown to the monster.  We were unable to leave
the torture-chamber now, unless Christine opened the door to us;
and it was only on this condition that we could hope to help her,
for we did not even know where the door might be.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the silence in the next room was disturbed by the ringing
of an electric bell.  There was a bound on the other side of the
wall and Erik's voice of thunder:</p>

<p>"Somebody ringing!  Walk in, please!"</p>

<p>A sinister chuckle.</p>

<p>"Who has come bothering now?  Wait for me here ...  I AM <em>GOING
TO TELL THE SIREN TO OPEN THE DOOR</em>."</p>

<p>Steps moved away, a door closed.  I had no time to think of the
fresh horror that was preparing; I forgot that the monster was
only going out perhaps to perpetrate a fresh crime; I understood
but one thing: Christine was alone behind the wall!</p>

<p>The Vicomte de Chagny was already calling to her:</p>

<p>"Christine!  Christine!"</p>

<p>As we could hear what was said in the next room, there was no
reason why my companion should not be heard in his turn.  Nevertheless,
the viscount had to repeat his cry time after time.</p>

<p>At last, a faint voice reached us.</p>

<p>"I am dreaming!" it said.</p>

<p>"Christine, Christine, it is I, Raoul!"</p>

<p>A silence.</p>

<p>"But answer me, Christine! ... In Heaven's name, if you are alone,
answer me!"</p>

<p>Then Christine's voice whispered Raoul's name.</p>

<p>"Yes!  Yes!  It is I!  It is not a dream! ... Christine, trust
me! ... We are here to save you ... but be prudent!  When you
hear the monster, warn us!"</p>

<p>Then Christine gave way to fear.  She trembled lest Erik should
discover where Raoul was hidden; she told us in a few hurried
words that Erik had gone quite mad with love and that he had decided
TO <em>KILL EVERYBODY AND HIMSELF WITH EVERYBODY </em>if she did
not consent to become his wife.  He had given her till eleven
o'clock the next evening for reflection.  It was the last respite. 
She must choose, as he said, between the wedding mass and the
requiem.</p>

<p>And Erik had then uttered a phrase which Christine did not quite
understand:</p>

<p>"Yes or no!  If your answer is no, everybody will be dead <em>AND
BURIED</em>!"</p>

<p>But I understood the sentence perfectly, for it corresponded
in a terrible manner with my own dreadful thought.</p>

<p>"Can you tell us where Erik is?"  I asked.</p>

<p>She replied that he must have left the house.</p>

<p>"Could you make sure?"</p>

<p>"No. I am fastened.  I can not stir a limb."</p>

<p>When we heard this, M. de Chagny and I gave a yell of fury. 
Our safety, the safety of all three of us, depended on the girl's
liberty of movement.</p>

<p>"But where are you?" asked Christine.  "There are only two doors
in my room, the Louis-Philippe room of which I told you, Raoul;
a door through which Erik comes and goes, and another which he
has never opened before me and which he has forbidden me ever
to go through, because he says it is the most dangerous of the
doors, the door of the torture-chamber!"</p>

<p>"Christine, that is where we are!"</p>

<p>"You are in the torture-chamber?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but we can not see the door."</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could only drag myself so far!  I would knock at the
door and that would tell you where it is."</p>

<p>"Is it a door with a lock to it?"  I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, with a lock."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," I said, "it is absolutely necessary, that you
should open that door to us!"</p>

<p>"But how?" asked the poor girl tearfully.</p>

<p>We heard her straining, trying to free herself from the bonds
that held her.</p>

<p>"I know where the key is," she said, in a voice that seemed exhausted
by the effort she had made.  "But I am fastened so tight ... 
Oh, the wretch!"</p>

<p>And she gave a sob.</p>

<p>"Where is the key?"  I asked, signing to M. de Chagny not to
speak and to leave the business to me, for we had not a moment
to lose.</p>

<p>"In the next room, near the organ, with another little bronze
key, which he also forbade me to touch.  They are both in a little
leather bag which he calls the bag of life and death...  Raoul! 
Raoul!  Fly! Everything is mysterious and terrible here, and Erik
will soon have gone quite mad, and you are in the torture-chamber!
... Go back by the way you came.  There must be a reason why the
room is called by that name!"</p>

<p>"Christine," said the young man.  "We will go from here together
or die together!"</p>

<p>"We must keep cool," I whispered.  "Why has he fastened you,
mademoiselle?  You can't escape from his house; and he knows it!"</p>

<p>"I tried to commit suicide!  The monster went out last night,
after carrying me here fainting and half chloroformed.  He was
going TO <em>HIS BANKER, </em>so he said! ... When he returned
he found me with my face covered with blood ...  I had tried to
kill myself by striking my forehead against the walls."</p>

<p>"Christine!" groaned Raoul; and he began to sob.</p>

<p>"Then he bound me ...  I am not allowed to die until eleven o'clock
to-morrow evening."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," I declared, "the monster bound you ... and he
shall unbind you.  You have only to play the necessary part! 
Remember that he loves you!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" we heard.  "Am I likely to forget it!"</p>

<p>"Remember it and smile to him ... entreat him ... tell him that
your bonds hurt you."</p>

<p>But Christine Daae said:</p>

<p>"Hush! ... I hear something in the wall on the lake! ... It is
he! ... Go away!  Go away!  Go away!"</p>

<p>"We could not go away, even if we wanted to," I said, as impressively
as I could.  "We can not leave this!  And we are in the torture-chamber!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Christine again.</p>

<p>Heavy steps sounded slowly behind the wall, then stopped and
made the floor creak once more.  Next came a tremendous sigh,
followed by a cry of horror from Christine, and we heard Erik's
voice:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for letting you see a face like this!  What
a state I am in, am I not?  It's <em>THE OTHER ONE'S FAULT!  </em>Why
did he ring?  Do I ask people who pass to tell me the time?  He
will never ask anybody the time again!  It is the siren's fault."</p>

<p>[Illustration: two page color illustration]</p>

<p>Another sigh, deeper, more tremendous still, came from the abysmal
depths of a soul.</p>

<p>"Why did you cry out, Christine?"</p>

<p>"Because I am in pain, Erik."</p>

<p>"I thought I had frightened you."</p>

<p>"Erik, unloose my bonds ...  Am I not your prisoner?"</p>

<p>"You will try to kill yourself again."</p>

<p>"You have given me till eleven o'clock to-morrow evening, Erik."</p>

<p>The footsteps dragged along the floor again.</p>

<p>"After all, as we are to die together ... and I am just as eager
as you ... yes, I have had enough of this life, you know...  Wait,
don't move, I will release you ...  You have only one word to
say:  'NO!' And it will at once be over <em>WITH EVERYBODY!  ...
</em>You are right, you are right; why wait till eleven o'clock
to-morrow evening?  True, it would have been grander, finer ... 
But that is childish nonsense ...  We should only think of ourselves
in this life, of our own death ... the rest doesn't matter... 
<em>YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME BECAUSE I AM ALL WET? ...  </em>Oh, my
dear, it's raining cats and dogs outside! ... Apart from that,
Christine, I think I am subject to hallucinations ...  You know,
the man who rang at the siren's door just now&mdash;go and look if
he's ringing at the bottom of the lake-well, he was rather like... 
There, turn round ... are you glad?  You're free now...  Oh, my
poor Christine, look at your wrists:  tell me, have I hurt them?
... That alone deserves death ...  Talking of death, I <em>MUST
SING HIS REQUIEM</em>!"</p>

<p>Hearing these terrible remarks, I received an awful presentiment
... I too had once rung at the monster's door ... and, without
knowing it, must have set some warning current in motion.</p>

<p>And I remembered the two arms that had emerged from the inky
waters... What poor wretch had strayed to that shore this time? 
Who was 'the other one,' the one whose requiem we now heard sung?</p>

<p>Erik sang like the god of thunder, sang a <em>DIES IRAE </em>that
enveloped us as in a storm.  The elements seemed to rage around
us.  Suddenly, the organ and the voice ceased so suddenly that
M. de Chagny sprang back, on the other side of the wall, with
emotion.  And the voice, changed and transformed, distinctly grated
out these metallic syllables: "<em>WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY
BAG</em>?"</p>
