<p>Brown, squatting cross-legged among the alpine roses, squinted
along his level rifle.</p>

<p>"Halt!" he said with a pleasant, rising inflection in his quiet
voice. "Stand very still, gentlemen," he added in German.</p>

<p>"Drop your rifles. Drop ’em quick!" he repeated more sharply.
"Up with your hands&mdash;hold them up high! Higher, if you please!&mdash;quickly.
Now, then, what are you doing on this alp?"</p>

<p>What they were doing seemed apparent enough&mdash;two gentlemen of
Teutonic persuasion, out stalking game&mdash;deer, rehbok or chamois&mdash;one
a tall, dark, nice-looking young fellow wearing the usual rough
gray jacket with stag-horn buttons, green felt hat with feather,
and leather breeches of the alpine hunter. His knees and aristocratic
ankles were bare and bronzed. He laughed a little as he held up
his arms.</p>

<p>The other man was stout and stocky rather than fat. He had the
square red face and bushy beard of a beer-nourished Teuton and
the spectacles of a Herr Professor. He held up his blunt hands
with all ten stubby fingers spread out wide. They seemed rather
soiled.</p>

<p>From his <em>rücksack</em> stuck out a butterfly net in two sections
and the deeply scalloped, silver-trimmed butt of a sporting rifle.
Edelweiss adorned his green felt hat; a green tin box punched
full of holes was slung from his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>Brown, lowering his rifle cautiously, was already getting to
his feet from the trampled bracken, when, behind him, he heard
Stent’s astonished voice break forth in pedantic German:</p>

<p>"Siurd! Is it <em>thou</em> then?"</p>

<p>"Harry Stent!" returned the dark, nice-looking young fellow amiably.
And, in a delightful voice and charming English:</p>

<p>"Pray, am I to offer you a shake hands," he inquired smilingly;
"or shall I continue to invoke the Olympian gods with classically
uplifted and imploring arms?"</p>

<p>Brown let Stent pass forward. Then, stepping back, he watched
the greeting between these two old classmates. His rifle, grasped
between stock and barrel, hung loosely between both hands. His
expression became vacantly good humoured; but his brain was working
like lightning.</p>

<p>Stent’s firm hand encountered Von Glahn’s and held it in questioning
astonishment. Looking him in the eyes he said slowly: "Siurd,
it is good to see you again. It is amazing to meet you this way.
I am glad. I have never forgotten you.... Only a moment ago I
was speaking to Brown about you&mdash;of our wonderful ibex hunt! I
was telling Brown&mdash;my comrade&mdash;" he turned his head slightly and
presented the two young men&mdash;"Mr. Brown, an American&#11834;"</p>

<p>"American?" repeated Von Glahn in his gentle, well-bred voice,
offering his hand. And, in turn, becoming sponsor, he presented
his stocky companion as Dr. von Dresslin; and the ceremony instantly
stiffened to a more rigid etiquette.</p>

<p>Then, in his always gentle, graceful way, Von Glahn rested his
hand lightly on Stent’s shoulder:</p>

<p>"You made us jump&mdash;you two Americans&mdash;as though you had been
British. Of what could two Americans be afraid in the Carnic Alps
to challenge a pair of wandering ibex stalkers?"</p>

<p>"You forget that I am Canadian," replied Stent, forcing a laugh.</p>

<p>"At that, you are practically American and civilian&mdash;" He glanced
smilingly over their equipment, carelessly it seemed to Stent,
as though verifying all absence of military insignia. "Besides,"
he added with his gentle humour, "there are no British in Italy.
And no Italians in these mountains, I fancy; they have their own
affairs to occupy them on the Isonzo I understand. Also, there
is no war between Italy and Germany."</p>

<p>Stent smiled, perfectly conscious of Brown’s telepathic support
in whatever was now to pass between them and these two Germans.
He knew, and Brown knew, that these Germans must be taken back
as prisoners; that, suspicious or not, they could not be permitted
to depart again with a story of having met an American and a Canadian
after ibex among the Carnic Alps.</p>

<p>These two Germans were already their prisoners; but there was
no hurry about telling them so.</p>

<p>"How do you happen to be here, Siurd?" asked Stent, frankly curious.</p>

<p>Von Glahn lifted his delicately formed eyebrows, then, amused:</p>

<p>"Count von Plessis invites me; and"&mdash;he laughed outright&mdash;"he
must have invited you, Harry, unless you are poaching!"</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed Stent, for a brief second believing in
the part he was playing; "I supposed this to be a free alp."</p>

<p>He and Von Glahn laughed; and the latter said, still frankly
amused: "<em>Soyez tranquille</em>, Messieurs; Count von Plessis
permits my friends&mdash;in my company&mdash;to shoot the Queen’s alm."</p>

<p>With a lithe movement, wholly graceful, he slipped the <em>rücksack</em>
from his shoulders, let it fall among the <em>alpenrosen</em>
beside his sporting rifle.</p>

<p>"We have a long day and a longer night ahead of us," he said
pleasantly, looking from Stent to Brown. "The snow limit lies
just above us; the ibex should pass here at dawn on their way
back to the peak. Shall we consolidate our front, gentlemen&mdash;and
make it a Quadruple Entente?"</p>

<p>Stent replied instantly: "We join you with thanks, Siurd. My
one ibex hunt is no experience at all compared to your record
of a veteran&mdash;" He looked full and significantly at Brown; continuing:
"As you say, we have all day and&mdash;a long night before us. Let
us make ourselves comfortable here in the sun before we take&mdash;our
final stations."</p>

<p>And they seated themselves in the lee of the crag, foregathering
fraternally in the warm alpine sunshine.</p>

<p>The Herr Professor von Dresslin grunted as he sat down. After
he had lighted his pipe he grunted again, screwed together his
butterfly net and gazed hard through thick-lensed spectacles at
Brown.</p>

<p>"Does it interest you, sir, the pursuit of the diurnal Lepidoptera?"
he inquired, still staring intently at the American.</p>

<p>"I don’t know anything about them," explained Brown. "What are
Lepidoptera?"</p>

<p>"The <em>schmetterling</em>&mdash;the butterfly. In Amerika, sir,
you have many fine species, notably Parnassus clodius and the
Parnassus smintheus of the four varietal forms." His prominent
eyes shifted from one detail of Brown’s costume to another&mdash;not
apparently an intelligent examination, but a sort of protruding
and indifferent stare.</p>

<p>His gaze, however, was arrested for a moment where the lump under
Brown’s tunic indicated something concealed&mdash;a hunting knife,
for example. Brown’s automatic was strapped there. But the bulging
eyes, expressionless still, remained fixed for a second only,
then travelled on toward the Ross rifle&mdash;the Athabasca Regiment
having been permitted to exchange this beloved weapon for the
British regulation piece recently issued to the Canadians. From
behind the thick lenses of his spectacles the Herr Professor examined
the rifle while his monotonously dreary voice continued an entomological
monologue for Brown’s edification. And all the while Von Glahn
and Stent, reclining nearby among the ferns, were exchanging what
appeared to be the frankest of confidences and the happiest of
youthful reminiscences.</p>

<p>"Of the Parnassians," rumbled on Professor von Dresslin, "here
in the Alps we possess one notable example&mdash;namely, the Parnassus
Apollo. It is for the capture of this never-to-be-sufficiently
studied butterfly that I have, upon this ibex-hunting expedition,
myself equipped with net and suitable paraphernalia."</p>

<p>"I see," nodded Brown, eyeing the green tin box and the net.
The Herr Professor’s pop-eyed attention was now occupied with
the service puttees worn by Brown. A sportsman also might have
worn them, of course.</p>

<p>"The Apollo butterfly," droned on Professor Dresslin, "iss a
butterfly of the larger magnitude among European Lepidoptera,
yet not of the largest. The Parnassians, allied to the Papilionidæ,
all live only in high altitudes, and are, by the thinly scaled
and always-to-be-remembered red and plack ge-spotted wings, to
be readily recognized. I haf already two specimens captured this
morning. I haff the honour, sir, to exhibit them for your inspection&#11834;"</p>

<p>He fished out a flat green box from his pocket, opened it under
Brown’s nose, leaning close enough to touch Brown with an exploring
and furtive elbow&mdash;and felt the contour of the automatic.</p>

<p>Amid a smell of carbolic and camphor cones Brown beheld, pinned
side by side upon the cork-lined interior of the box, two curiously
pretty butterflies.</p>

<p>Their drooping and still pliable wings seemed as thin as white
tissue paper; their bodies were covered with furry hairs. Brick-red
and black spots decorated the frail membrane of the wings in a
curiously pleasing harmony of pattern and of colour.</p>

<p>"Very unusual," he said, with a vague idea he was saying the
wrong thing.</p>

<p>Monotonously, paying no attention, Professor von Dresslin continued:
"I, the life history of the Parnassus Apollo, haff from my early
youth investigated with minuteness, diligence, and patience."
&mdash;His protuberant eyes were now fixed on Brown’s rifle again.&mdash;"For
many years I haff bred this Apollo butterfly from the egg, from
the caterpillar, from the chrysalis. I have the negroid forms,
the albino forms, the dwarf forms, the hybrid forms investigated
under effery climatic condition. Notes sufficient for three volumes
of quarto already exist as a residuum of my investigations&#11834;"</p>

<p>He looked up suddenly into the American’s face&mdash;which was the
first sudden movement the Herr Professor had made&#11834;</p>

<p>"Ach wass! Three volumes! It is nothing. Here iss material for
thirty! &mdash;A lifetime iss too short to know all the secrets
of a single species.... If I may inquire, sir, of what pattern
is your most interesting and admirable rifle?"</p>

<p>"A &mdash;Ross," said Brown, startled into a second’s hesitation.</p>

<p>"So? And, if I may inquire, of what nationality iss it, a R-r-ross?"</p>

<p>"It’s a Canadian weapon. We Americans use it a great deal for
big game."</p>

<p>"So?... And it iss also by the Canadian military employed perhaps,
sir?"</p>

<p>"I believe," said Brown, carelessly, "that the British Government
has taken away the Ross rifle from the Canadians and given them
the regulation weapon."</p>

<p>"So? Permit&mdash;that I examine, sir?"</p>

<p>Brown did not seem to hear him or notice the extended hand&mdash;blunt-fingered,
hairy, persistent.</p>

<p>The Professor, not discouraged, repeated: "Sir, <em>bitte darf
ich</em>, may I be permitted?" And Brown’s eyes flashed back a
lightning shaft of inquiry. Then, carelessly smiling, he passed
the Ross rifle over to the Herr Professor; and, at the same time,
drew toward him that gentleman’s silver-mounted weapon, and carelessly
cocked it.</p>

<p>"Permit me," he murmured, balancing it innocently in the hollow
of his left arm, apparently preoccupied with admiration at the
florid workmanship of stock and guard. No movement that the Herr
Professor made escaped him; but presently he thought to himself&mdash;"The
old dodo is absolutely unsuspicious. My nerves are out of order....
What odd eyes that Fritz has!"</p>

<p>When Herr Professor von Dresslin passed back the weapon Brown
laid the German sporting piece beside it with murmured complimentary
comment.</p>

<p>"Yess," said the German, "such rifles kill when properly handled.
We Germans may cordially recommend them for our American&mdash;friends&mdash;"
Here was the slightest hesitation&mdash;"Pardon! I mean that we may
safely guarantee this rifle <em>to</em> our friends."</p>

<p>Brown looked thoughtfully at the thick lenses of the spectacles.
The popeyes remained expressionless, utterly, Teutonically inscrutable.
A big heather bee came buzzing among the <em>alpenrosen</em>.
Its droning hum resembled the monotone of the Herr Professor.</p>

<p>Behind them Brown heard Stent saying: "Do you remember our ambition
to wear the laurels of Parnassus, Siurd? Do you remember our notes
at the lectures on the poets? And our ambition to write at least
one deathless poem apiece before we died?"</p>

<p>Von Glahn’s dark eyes narrowed with merriment and his gentle
laugh and attractive voice sounded pleasantly in Brown’s ears.</p>

<p>"You wrote at least <em>one</em> famous poem to Rosa," he said,
still laughing.</p>

<p>"To Rosa? Oh! Rosa of the Café Luitpold! By Jove I did, didn’t
I, Siurd? How on earth did you ever remember that?"</p>

<p>"I thought it very pretty." He began to repeat aloud:</p>

<p>  "Rosa with the winsome eyes,   When my beer you bring to me;  
I can see through your disguise!   I my goddess recognize-  Hebe,
young immortally,   Sweet nepenthe pouring me!"</p>

<p>Stent laughed outright:</p>

<p>"How funny to think of it now&mdash;and to think of Rosa!... And you,
Siurd, do you forget that you also composed a most wonderful war-poem&mdash;to
the metre of ’Fly, Eagle, Fly!’ Do you remember how it began?</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Slay, Eagle, Slay!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They die who dare decry us!<br/>
Red dawns ’The Day.’<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The western cliffs defy us!<br/>
Turn their grey flood<br/>
To seas of blood!<br/>
And, as they flee, Slay, Eagle! Slay!<br/>
For God has willed this German ’Day’!"

</p>
</div>
<p>"Enough," said Siurd Von Glahn, still laughing, but turning very
red. "What a terrible memory you have, Harry! For heaven’s sake
spare my modesty such accurate reminiscences."</p>

<p>"I thought it fine poetry&mdash;then," insisted Stent with a forced
smile. But his voice had subtly altered.</p>

<p>They looked at each other in silence, the reminiscent smile still
stamped upon their stiffening lips.</p>

<p>For a brief moment the years had seemed to fade&mdash;time was not&mdash;the
sunshine of that careless golden age had seemed to warm them once
again there where they sat amid the <em>alpenrosen</em> below
the snow line on the Col de la Reine.</p>

<p>But it did not endure; everything concerning earth and heaven
and life and death had so far remained unsaid between these two.
And never would be said. Both understood that, perhaps.</p>

<p>Then Von Glahn’s sidelong and preoccupied glance fell on Stent’s
field glasses slung short around his neck. His rigid smile died
out. Soldiers wore field glasses that way; hunters, when they
carried them instead of spyglasses, wore them <em>en bandoulière</em>.</p>

<p>He spoke, however, of other matters in his gentle, thoughtful
voice&mdash;avoiding always any mention of politics and war&mdash;chatted
on pleasantly with the familiarity and insouciance of old acquaintance.
Once he turned slowly and looked at Brown&mdash;addressed him politely&mdash;while
his dark eyes wandered over the American, noting every detail
of dress and equipment, and the slight bulge at his belt line
beneath the tunic.</p>

<p>Twice he found pretext to pick up his rifle, but discarded it
carelessly, apparently not noticing that Stent and Brown always
resumed their own weapons when he touched his.</p>

<p>Brown said to Von Glahn:</p>

<p>"Ibex stalking is a new game to me. My friend Stent tells me
that you are old at it."</p>

<p>"I have followed some few ibex, Mr. Brown," replied the young
man modestly. "And&mdash;other game," he added with a shrug.</p>

<p>"I know how it’s done in theory," continued the American; "and
I am wondering whether we are to lie in this spot until dawn tomorrow
or whether we climb higher and lie in the snow up there."</p>

<p>"In the snow, perhaps. God knows exactly where we shall lie tonight
&mdash;Mr. Brown."</p>

<p>There was an odd look in Siurd’s soft brown eyes; he turned and
spoke to Herr Professor von Dresslin, using dialect&mdash;and instantly
appearing to recollect himself he asked pardon of Stent and Brown
in his very perfect English.</p>

<p>"I said to the Herr Professor in the Traun dialect: ’Ibex may
be stirring, as it is already late afternoon. We ought now to
use our glasses.’ My family," he added apologetically, "come from
the Traunwald; I forget and employ the vernacular at times."</p>

<p>The Herr Professor unslung his telescope, set his rifle upright
on the moss, and, kneeling, balanced the long spyglass alongside
of the blued-steel barrel, resting it on his hand as an archer
fits the arrow he is drawing on the bowstring.</p>

<p>Instantly both Brown and Stent thought of the same thing: the
chance that these Germans might spy others of the Athabasca regiment
prowling among the ferns and rocks of neighbouring slopes. The
game was nearly at an end, anyway.</p>

<p>They exchanged a glance; both picked up their rifles; Brown nodded
almost imperceptibly. The tragic comedy was approaching its close.</p>

<p>"<em>Hirsch</em>" grunted the Herr Professor&mdash;"<em>und stück</em>&mdash;on
the north alm"&mdash;staring through his telescope intently.</p>

<p>"Accorded," said Siurd Von Glahn, balancing his spyglass and
sweeping the distant crags. "<em>Stück</em> on the western shoulder,"
he added&mdash;"and a stag royal among them."</p>

<p>"Of ten?"</p>

<p>"Of twelve."</p>

<p>After a silence: "Why are they galloping &mdash;I wonder&mdash;the
herd-stag and <em>stück</em>?"</p>

<p>Brown very quietly laid one hand on Stent’s arm.</p>

<p>"A <em>geier</em>, perhaps," suggested Siurd, his eye glued to
his spyglass.</p>

<p>"No ibex?" asked Stent in a voice a little forced.</p>

<p>"<em>Noch nicht, mon ami. Tiens! A gemsbok</em>&mdash;high on the
third peak&mdash;feeding."</p>

<p>"Accorded," grunted the Herr Professor after an interval of search;
and he closed his spyglass and placed his rifle on the moss.</p>

<p>His staring, protuberant eyes fell casually upon Brown, who was
laying aside his own rifle again&mdash;and the German’s expression
did not alter.</p>

<p>"Ibex!" exclaimed Von Glahn softly.</p>

<p>Stent, rising impulsively to his feet, bracketted his field glasses
on the third peak, and stood there, poised, slim and upright against
the sky on the chasm’s mossy edge.</p>

<p>"I don’t see your ibex, Siurd," he said, still searching.</p>

<p>"On the third peak, <em>mon ami</em>"&mdash;drawing Stent familiarly
to his side&mdash;the lightest caressing contact&mdash;merely enough to
verify the existence of the automatic under his old classmate’s
tunic.</p>

<p>If Stent did not notice the impalpable touch, neither did Brown
notice it, watching them. Perhaps the Herr Professor did, but
it is not at all certain, because at that moment there came flopping
along over the bracken and <em>alpenrosen</em> a loppy winged
butterfly&mdash;a large, whitish creature, seeming uncertain in its
irresolute flight whether to alight at Brown’s feet or go flapping
aimlessly on over Brown’s head.</p>

<p>The Herr Professor snatched up his net&mdash;struck heavily toward
the winged thing&mdash;a silent, terrible, sweeping blow with net and
rifle clutched together. Brown went down with a crash.</p>

<p>At the shocking sound of the impact Stent wheeled from the abyss,
then staggered back under the powerful shove from Von Glahn’s
nervous arm. Swaying, fighting frantically for foothold, there
on the chasm’s awful edge, he balanced for an instant; fought
for equilibrium. Von Glahn, rigid, watched him. Then, deathly
white, his young eyes looking straight into the eyes of his old
classmate &mdash;Stent lost the fight, fell outward, wider, dropping
back into mid-air, down through sheer, tremendous depths&mdash;down
there where the broad river seemed only a silver thread and the
forests looked like beds of tender, velvet moss.</p>

<p>After him, fluttering irresolutely, flitted Parnassus Apollo,
still winging its erratic way where God willed it&mdash;a frail, dainty,
translucent, wind-blown fleck of white above the gulf&mdash;symbol,
perhaps of the soul already soaring up out of the terrific deeps
below.</p>

<p>The Herr Professor sweated and panted as he tugged at the silk
handkerchief with which he was busily knotting the arms of the
unconscious American behind his back.</p>

<p>"Pouf! Ugh! Pig-dog!" he grunted&mdash;"mit his pockets full of automatic
clips. A Yankee, eh? What I tell you, Siurd? &mdash;English and
Yankee they are one in blood and one at heart&mdash;pig-dogs effery
one. Hey, Siurd, what I told you already <em>gesternabend</em>?
The British <em>schwein</em> are in Italy already. Hola! Siurd!
Take his feet and we turn him over <em>mal</em>!"</p>

<p>But Von Glahn remained motionless, leaning heavily against the
crag, his back to the abyss, his blond head buried in both arms.</p>

<p>So the Herr Professor, who was a major, too, began, with his
powerful, stubby hands, to pull the unconscious man over on his
back. And, as he worked, he hummed monotonously but contentedly
in his bushy beard something about <em>something</em> being "<em>über
alles</em>" &mdash;God, perhaps, perhaps the blue sky overhead
which covered him and his sickened friend alike, and the hurt
enemy whose closed lids shut out the sky above&mdash;and the dead man
lying very, very far below them&mdash;where river and forest and moss
and Parnassus were now alike to him.</p>
