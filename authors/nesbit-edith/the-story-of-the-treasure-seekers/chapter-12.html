<p>
The part about his nobleness only comes at the end, but you would not
understand it unless you knew how it began.  It began, like nearly
everything about that time, with treasure-seeking.</p>

<p>Of course as soon as we had promised to consult my Father about business
matters we all gave up wanting to go into business.  I don't know how it
is, but having to consult about a thing with grown-up people, even the
bravest and the best, seems to make the thing not worth doing
afterwards.</p>

<p>We don't mind Albert's uncle chipping in sometimes when the thing's
going on, but we are glad he never asked us to promise to consult him
about anything.  Yet Oswald saw that my Father was quite right; and I
daresay if we had had that hundred pounds we should have spent it on the
share in that lucrative business for the sale of useful patent, and then
found out afterwards that we should have done better to spend the money
in some other way.  My Father says so, and he ought to know.  We had
several ideas about that time, but having so little chink always stood
in the way.</p>

<p>This was the case with H. O.'s idea of setting up a coconut-shy on this
side of the Heath, where there are none generally.  We had no sticks or
wooden balls, and the greengrocer said he could not book so many as
twelve dozen coconuts without Mr Bastable's written order.  And as we
did not wish to consult my Father it was decided to drop it.  And when
Alice dressed up Pincher in some of the dolls' clothes and we made up
our minds to take him round with an organ as soon as we had taught him
to dance, we were stopped at once by Dicky's remembering how he had once
heard that an organ cost seven hundred pounds.  Of course this was the
big church kind, but even the ones on three legs can't be got for one-
and-sevenpence, which was all we had when we first thought of it. So we
gave that up too.</p>

<p>It was a wet day, I remember, and mutton hash for dinner - very tough
with pale gravy with lumps in it.  I think the others would have left a
good deal on the sides of their plates, although they know better, only
Oswald said it was a savoury stew made of the red deer that Edward shot.
So then we were the Children of the New Forest, and the mutton tasted
much better.  No one in the New Forest minds venison being tough and the
gravy pale.</p>

<p>Then after dinner we let the girls have a dolls' tea-party, on condition
they didn't expect us boys to wash up; and it was when we were drinking
the last of the liquorice water out of the little cups that Dicky said - </p>

<p>'This reminds me.'</p>

<p>So we said, 'What of?'</p>

<p>Dicky answered us at once, though his mouth was full of bread with
liquorice stuck in it to look like cake.  You should not speak with your
mouth full, even to your own relations, and you shouldn't wipe your
mouth on the back of your hand, but on your handkerchief, if you have
one.  Dicky did not do this.  He said - </p>

<p>'Why, you remember when we first began about treasure-seeking, I said I
had thought of something, only I could not tell you because I hadn't
finished thinking about it.'</p>

<p>We said 'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Well, this liquorice water - '</p>

<p>'Tea,' said Alice softly.</p>

<p>'Well, tea then - made me think.'  He was going on to say what it made
him think, but Noel interrupted and cried out, 'I say; let's finish off
this old tea-party and have a council of war.'</p>

<p>So we got out the flags and the wooden sword and the drum, and Oswald
beat it while the girls washed up, till Eliza came up to say she had the
jumping toothache, and the noise went through her like a knife.  So of
course Oswald left off at once.  When you are polite to Oswald he never
refuses to grant your requests.</p>

<p>When we were all dressed up we sat down round the camp fire, and Dicky
began again.</p>

<p>'Every one in the world wants money.  Some people get it.  The people
who get it are the ones who see things.  I have seen one thing.'</p>

<p>Dicky stopped and smoked the pipe of peace.  It is the pipe we did
bubbles with in the summer, and somehow it has not got broken yet.  We
put tea-leaves in it for the pipe of peace, but the girls are not
allowed to have any.  It is not right to let girls smoke.  They get to
think too much of themselves if you let them do everything the same as
men.  Oswald said, 'Out with it.'</p>

<p>'I see that glass bottles only cost a penny.  H. O., if you dare to
snigger I'll send you round selling old bottles, and you shan't have any
sweets except out of the money you get for them.  And the same with you,
Noel.'</p>

<p>'Noel wasn't sniggering,' said Alice in a hurry; 'it is only his taking
so much interest in what you were saying makes him look like that.  Be
quiet, H. O., and don't you make faces, either. Do go on, Dicky dear.'</p>

<p>So Dicky went on.</p>

<p>'There must be hundreds of millions of bottles of medicines sold every
year. Because all the different medicines say, &quot;Thousands of cures
daily,&quot; and if you only take that as two thousand, which it must be, at
least, it mounts up.  And the people who sell them must make a great
deal of money by them because they are nearly always two-and-ninepence
the bottle, and three-and-six for one nearly double the size.  Now the
bottles, as I was saying, don't cost anything like that.'</p>

<p>'It's the medicine costs the money,' said Dora; 'look how expensive
jujubes are at the chemist's, and peppermints too.'</p>

<p>'That's only because they're nice,' Dicky explained; 'nasty things are
not so dear.  Look what a lot of brimstone you get for a penny, and the
same with alum. We would not put the nice kinds of chemist's things in
our medicine.'</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell us that when we had invented our medicine we
would write and tell the editor about it, and he would put it in the
paper, and then people would send their two-and-ninepence and three-and-
six for the bottle nearly double the size, and then when the medicine
had cured them they would write to the paper and their letters would be
printed, saying how they had been suffering for years, and never thought
to get about again, but thanks to the blessing of our ointment - '</p>

<p>Dora interrupted and said, 'Not ointment - it's so messy.'  And Alice
thought so too.  And Dicky said he did not mean it, he was quite decided
to let it be in bottles.  So now it was all settled, and we did not see
at the time that this would be a sort of going into business, but
afterwards when Albert's uncle showed us we saw it, and we were sorry.
We only had to invent the medicine. You might think that was easy,
because of the number of them you see every day in the paper, but it is
much harder than you think.  First we had to decide what sort of illness
we should like to cure, and a 'heated discussion ensued', like in
Parliament.</p>

<p>Dora wanted it to be something to make the complexion of dazzling
fairness, but we remembered how her face came all red and rough when she
used the Rosabella soap that was advertised to make the darkest
complexion fair as the lily, and she agreed that perhaps it was better
not.  Noel wanted to make the medicine first and then find out what it
would cure, but Dicky thought not, because there are so many more
medicines than there are things the matter with us, so it would be
easier to choose the disease first. Oswald would have liked wounds.  I
still think it was a good idea, but Dicky said, 'Who has wounds,
especially now there aren't any wars?  We shouldn't sell a bottle a
day!'  So Oswald gave in because he knows what manners are, and it was
Dicky's idea.  H. O. wanted a cure for the uncomfortable feeling that
they give you powders for, but we explained to him that grown-up people
do not have this feeling, however much they eat, and he agreed.  Dicky
said he did not care a straw what the loathsome disease was, as long as
we hurried up and settled on something.  Then Alice said - </p>

<p>'It ought to be something very common, and only one thing.  Not the
pains in the back and all the hundreds of things the people have in
somebody's syrup.  What's the commonest thing of all?'</p>

<p>And at once we said, 'Colds.'</p>

<p>So that was settled.</p>

<p>Then we wrote a label to go on the bottle.  When it was written it would
not go on the vinegar bottle that we had got, but we knew it would go
small when it was printed.  It was like this:</p>

<p>                 BASTABLE'S
           CERTAIN CURE FOR COLDS
Coughs, Asthma, Shortness of Breath, and all infections of the
Chest</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>  One dose gives immediate relief<br />
It will cure your cold in one bottle<br />
  Especially the larger size at 3s. 6d.<br />
    Order at once of the Makers<br />

</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>Makers:<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>D., O., R., A., N., and H. O. BASTABLE<br />

</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>(A halfpenny for all bottles returned)<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div> -  -  -  -  -  - <br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Of course the next thing was for one of us to catch a cold and try what
cured it; we all wanted to be the one, but it was Dicky's idea, and he
said he was not going to be done out of it, so we let him.  It was only
fair.  He left off his undershirt that very day, and next morning he
stood in a draught in his nightgown for quite a long time.  And we
damped his day-shirt with the nail-brush before he put it on.  But all
was vain.  They always tell you that these things will give you cold,
but we found it was not so.</p>

<p>So then we all went over to the Park, and Dicky went right into the
water with his boots on, and stood there as long as he could bear it,
for it was rather cold, and we stood and cheered him on. He walked home
in his wet clothes, which they say is a sure thing, but it was no go,
though his boots were quite spoiled. And three days after Noel began to
cough and sneeze.</p>

<p>So then Dicky said it was not fair.</p>

<p>'I can't help it,' Noel said.  'You should have caught it yourself, then
it wouldn't have come to me.'</p>

<p>And Alice said she had known all along Noel oughtn't to have stood about
on the bank cheering in the cold.</p>

<p>Noel had to go to bed, and then we began to make the medicines; we were
sorry he was out of it, but he had the fun of taking the things.</p>

<p>We made a great many medicines.  Alice made herb tea.  She got sage and
thyme and savory and marjoram and boiled them all up together with salt
and water, but she <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">would</span> put parsley in too. Oswald is sure parsley is
not a herb.  It is only put on the cold meat and you are not supposed to
eat it.  It kills parrots to eat parsley, I believe.  I expect it was
the parsley that disagreed so with Noel.  The medicine did not seem to
do the cough any good.</p>

<p>Oswald got a pennyworth of alum, because it is so cheap, and some
turpentine which every one knows is good for colds, and a little sugar
and an aniseed ball. These were mixed in a bottle with water, but Eliza
threw it away and said it was nasty rubbish, and I hadn't any money to
get more things with.</p>

<p>Dora made him some gruel, and he said it did his chest good; but of
course that was no use, because you cannot put gruel in bottles and say
it is medicine.  It would not be honest, and besides nobody would
believe you.</p>

<p>Dick mixed up lemon-juice and sugar and a little of the juice of the red
flannel that Noel's throat was done up in.  It comes out beautifully in
hot water.  Noel took this and he liked it. Noel's own idea was
liquorice-water, and we let him have it, but it is too plain and black
to sell in bottles at the proper price.</p>

<p>Noel liked H. O.'s medicine the best, which was silly of him, because it
was only peppermints melted in hot water, and a little cobalt to make it
look blue. It was all right, because H. O.'s paint-box is the French
kind, with Couleurs non Veneneuses on it. This means you may suck your
brushes if you want to, or even your paints if you are a very little
boy.</p>

<p>It was rather jolly while Noel had that cold.  He had a fire in his
bedroom which opens out of Dicky's and Oswald's, and the girls used to
read aloud to Noel all day; they will not read aloud to you when you are
well.  Father was away at Liverpool on business, and Albert's uncle was
at Hastings.  We were rather glad of this, because we wished to give all
the medicines a fair trial, and grown-ups are but too fond of
interfering.  As if we should have given him anything poisonous!</p>

<p>His cold went on - it was bad in his head, but it was not one of the kind
when he has to have poultices and can't sit up in bed. But when it had
been in his head nearly a week, Oswald happened to tumble over Alice on
the stairs.  When we got up she was crying.</p>

<p>'Don't cry silly!' said Oswald; 'you know I didn't hurt you.'  I was
very sorry if I had hurt her, but you ought not to sit on the stairs in
the dark and let other people tumble over you.  You ought to remember
how beastly it is for them if they do hurt you.</p>

<p>'Oh, it's not that, Oswald,' Alice said.  'Don't be a pig!  I am so
miserable. Do be kind to me.'</p>

<p>So Oswald thumped her on the back and told her to shut up.</p>

<p>'It's about Noel,' she said.  'I'm sure he's very ill; and playing about
with medicines is all very well, but I know he's ill, and Eliza won't
send for the doctor: she says it's only a cold.  And I know the
doctor's bills are awful.  I heard Father telling Aunt Emily so in the
summer.  But he <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> ill, and perhaps he'll die or something.'</p>

<p>Then she began to cry again.  Oswald thumped her again, because he knows
how a good brother ought to behave, and said, 'Cheer up.'  If we had
been in a book Oswald would have embraced his little sister tenderly,
and mingled his tears with hers.</p>

<p>Then Oswald said, 'Why not write to Father?'</p>

<p>And she cried more and said, 'I've lost the paper with the address.  H.
O. had it to draw on the back of, and I can't find it now; I've looked
everywhere. I'll tell you what I'm going to do.  No I won't.  But I'm
going out.  Don't tell the others.  And I say, Oswald, do pretend I'm in
if Eliza asks.  Promise.'</p>

<p>'Tell me what you're going to do,' I said.  But she said 'No'; and there
was a good reason why not.  So I said I wouldn't promise if it came to
that.  Of course I meant to all right.  But it did seem mean of her not
to tell me.</p>

<p>So Alice went out by the side door while Eliza was setting tea, and she
was a long time gone; she was not in to tea.  When Eliza asked Oswald
where she was he said he did not know, but perhaps she was tidying her
corner drawer.  Girls often do this, and it takes a long time.  Noel
coughed a good bit after tea, and asked for Alice.</p>

<p>Oswald told him she was doing something and it was a secret. Oswald did
not tell any lies even to save his sister.  When Alice came back she was
very quiet, but she whispered to Oswald that it was all right.  When it
was rather late Eliza said she was going out to post a letter.  This
always takes her an hour, because she <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">will</span> go to the post-office across
the Heath instead of the pillar-box, because once a boy dropped fusees
in our pillar-box and burnt the letters.  It was not any of us; Eliza
told us about it. And when there was a knock at the door a long time
after we thought it was Eliza come back, and that she had forgotten the
back-door key.  We made H. O. go down to open the door, because it is
his place to run about: his legs are younger than ours.  And we heard
boots on the stairs besides H. O.'s, and we listened spellbound till the
door opened, and it was Albert's uncle.  He looked very tired.</p>

<p>'I am glad you've come,' Oswald said.  'Alice began to think Noel - '</p>

<p>Alice stopped me, and her face was very red, her nose was shiny too,
with having cried so much before tea.</p>

<p>She said, 'I only said I thought Noel ought to have the doctor. Don't
you think he ought?'  She got hold of Albert's uncle and held on to him.</p>

<p>'Let's have a look at you, young man,' said Albert's uncle, and he sat
down on the edge of the bed.  It is a rather shaky bed, the bar that
keeps it steady underneath got broken when we were playing burglars last
winter.  It was our crowbar.  He began to feel Noel's pulse, and went on
talking.</p>

<p>'It was revealed to the Arab physician as he made merry in his tents on
the wild plains of Hastings that the Presence had a cold in its head.
So he immediately seated himself on the magic carpet, and bade it bear
him hither, only pausing in the flight to purchase a few sweetmeats in
the bazaar.'</p>

<p>He pulled out a jolly lot of chocolate and some butterscotch, and grapes
for Noel.  When we had all said thank you, he went on.</p>

<p>'The physician's are the words of wisdom: it's high time this kid was
asleep. I have spoken.  Ye have my leave to depart.'</p>

<p>So we bunked, and Dora and Albert's uncle made Noel comfortable for the
night.</p>

<p>Then they came to the nursery which we had gone down to, and he sat down
in the Guy Fawkes chair and said, 'Now then.'</p>

<p>Alice said, 'You may tell them what I did.  I daresay they'll all be in
a wax, but I don't care.'</p>

<p>'I think you were very wise,' said Albert's uncle, pulling her close to
him to sit on his knee.  'I am very glad you telegraphed.'</p>

<p>So then Oswald understood what Alice's secret was.  She had gone out and
sent a telegram to Albert's uncle at Hastings.  But Oswald thought she
might have told him.  Afterwards she told me what she had put in the
telegram.  It was, 'Come home.  We have given Noel a cold, and I think
we are killing him.'  With the address it came to tenpence-halfpenny.</p>

<p>Then Albert's uncle began to ask questions, and it all came out, how
Dicky had tried to catch the cold, but the cold had gone to Noel
instead, and about the medicines and all.  Albert's uncle looked very
serious.</p>

<p>'Look here,' he said, 'You're old enough not to play the fool like this.
Health is the best thing you've got; you ought to know better than to
risk it.  You might have killed your little brother with your precious
medicines.  You've had a lucky escape, certainly.  But poor Noel!'</p>

<p>'Oh, do you think he's going to die?' Alice asked that, and she was
crying again.</p>

<p>'No, no,' said Albert's uncle; 'but look here.  Do you see how silly
you've been?  And I thought you promised your Father - ' And then he gave
us a long talking-to.  He can make you feel most awfully small.  At last
he stopped, and we said we were very sorry, and he said, 'You know I
promised to take you all to the pantomime?'</p>

<p>So we said, 'Yes,' and knew but too well that now he wasn't going to.
Then he went on - </p>

<p>'Well, I will take you if you like, or I will take Noel to the sea for a
week to cure his cold.  Which is it to be?'</p>

<p>Of course he knew we should say, 'Take Noel' and we did; but Dicky told
me afterwards he thought it was hard on H. O.</p>

<p>Albert's uncle stayed till Eliza came in, and then he said good night in
a way that showed us that all was forgiven and forgotten.</p>

<p>And we went to bed.  It must have been the middle of the night when
Oswald woke up suddenly, and there was Alice with her teeth chattering,
shaking him to wake him.</p>

<p>'Oh, Oswald!' she said, 'I am so unhappy.  Suppose I should die in the
night!'</p>

<p>Oswald told her to go to bed and not gas.  But she said, 'I must tell
you; I wish I'd told Albert's uncle.  I'm a thief, and if I die to-night
I know where thieves go to.'  So Oswald saw it was no good and he sat up
in bed and said - 'Go ahead.'  So Alice stood shivering and said - 'I
hadn't enough money for the telegram, so I took the bad sixpence out of
the exchequer.  And I paid for it with that and the fivepence I had.
And I wouldn't tell you, because if you'd stopped me doing it I couldn't
have borne it; and if you'd helped me you'd have been a thief too. Oh,
what shall I do?'</p>

<p>Oswald thought a minute, and then he said - </p>

<p>'You'd better have told me.  But I think it will be all right if we pay
it back. Go to bed.  Cross with you?  No, stupid!  Only another time
you'd better not keep secrets.'</p>

<p>So she kissed Oswald, and he let her, and she went back to bed.</p>

<p>The next day Albert's uncle took Noel away, before Oswald had time to
persuade Alice that we ought to tell him about the sixpence.  Alice was
very unhappy, but not so much as in the night: you can be very
miserable in the night if you have done anything wrong and you happen to
be awake.  I know this for a fact.</p>

<p>None of us had any money except Eliza, and she wouldn't give us any
unless we said what for; and of course we could not do that because of
the honour of the family.  And Oswald was anxious to get the sixpence to
give to the telegraph people because he feared that the badness of that
sixpence might have been found out, and that the police might come for
Alice at any moment.  I don't think I ever had such an unhappy day.  Of
course we could have written to Albert's uncle, but it would have taken
a long time, and every moment of delay added to Alice's danger.  We
thought and thought, but we couldn't think of any way to get that
sixpence.  It seems a small sum, but you see Alice's liberty depended on
it.  It was quite late in the afternoon when I met Mrs Leslie on the
Parade. She had a brown fur coat and a lot of yellow flowers in her
hands.  She stopped to speak to me, and asked me how the Poet was.  I
told her he had a cold, and I wondered whether she would lend me
sixpence if I asked her, but I could not make up my mind how to begin to
say it.  It is a hard thing to say - much harder than you would think.
She talked to me for a bit, and then she suddenly got into a cab, and
said - </p>

<p>'I'd no idea it was so late,' and told the man where to go.  And just as
she started she shoved the yellow flowers through the window and said,
'For the sick poet, with my love,' and was driven off.</p>

<p>Gentle reader, I will not conceal from you what Oswald did.  He knew all
about not disgracing the family, and he did not like doing what I am
going to say: and they were really Noel's flowers, only he could not
have sent them to Hastings, and Oswald knew he would say 'Yes' if Oswald
asked him.  Oswald sacrificed his family pride because of his little
sister's danger.  I do not say he was a noble boy - I just tell you what
he did, and you can decide for yourself about the nobleness.</p>

<p>He put on his oldest clothes - they're much older than any you would
think he had if you saw him when he was tidy - and he took those yellow
chrysanthemums and he walked with them to Greenwich Station and waited
for the trains bringing people from London. He sold those flowers in
penny bunches and got tenpence.  Then he went to the telegraph office at
Lewisham, and said to the lady there:</p>

<p>'A little girl gave you a bad sixpence yesterday.  Here are six good
pennies.'</p>

<p>The lady said she had not noticed it, and never mind, but Oswald knew
that 'Honesty is the best Policy', and he refused to take back the
pennies.  So at last she said she should put them in the plate on
Sunday.  She is a very nice lady.  I like the way she does her hair.</p>

<p>Then Oswald went home to Alice and told her, and she hugged him, and
said he was a dear, good, kind boy, and he said 'Oh, it's all right.'</p>

<p>We bought peppermint bullseyes with the fourpence I had over, and the
others wanted to know where we got the money, but we would not tell.</p>

<p>Only afterwards when Noel came home we told him, because they were his
flowers, and he said it was quite right.  He made some poetry about it.
I only remember one bit of it.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>The noble youth of high degree<br />
Consents to play a menial part,<br />
All for his sister Alice's sake,<br />
Who was so dear to his faithful heart.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>But Oswald himself has never bragged about it.  We got no treasure out
of this, unless you count the peppermint bullseyes.</p>
