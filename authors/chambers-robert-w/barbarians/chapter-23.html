<p>There was no reply, because the young man was hanging out over
his window sill in the darkness trying to switch away, from her
closed window below, the big, clattering Death’s Head moth which
obstinately and persistently fluttered there.</p>

<p>What possessed the moth to continue battering its wings at the
window of the room below? Had the other moths which he released
done so, too? They had darted out of his room into the night,
each garnished with a tissue robe. He supposed they had flown
north; he had not looked out to see.</p>

<p>What had gone wrong with this moth, then?</p>

<p>He took his emaciated blond head between his bony fingers and
pondered, probing for reason with German thoroughness&mdash;that celebrated
thoroughness which is invariably riddled with flaws.</p>

<p>Of all contingencies he had thought&mdash;or so it seemed to him.
He could not recollect any precaution neglected. He had come to
Sainte Lesse for a clearly defined object and to make certain
reports concerning matters of interest to the German military
authorities north of Nivelle.</p>

<p>The idea, inspired by the experiments of Henri Fabre, was original
with him. Patiently, during the previous year, he had worked it
out&mdash;had proved his theory by a series of experiments with moths
of this species.</p>

<p>He had arranged with his staff comrade, Dr. Glück, for a forced
hatching of the pupæ which the latter had patiently bred from
the enormous green and violet-banded caterpillars.</p>

<p>At least one female Death’s Head must be ready, caged in the
trenches beyond Nivelle. Hundreds of pupæ could not have died.
Where, then, was his error&mdash;if, indeed, he had made any?</p>

<p>Leaning from the window, he looked down at the frantic moth,
perplexed, a little uneasy now.</p>

<p>"Swine!" he muttered. "What, then, ails you that you do not fly
to the mistress awaiting you over yonder?"</p>

<p>He could see the cylinder of white tissue shining on the creature’s
body, where it fluttered against the pane, illuminated by the
rays of the candle from within the young girl’s room.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that the candle-light was proving the greater
attraction?</p>

<p>Even as the possibility entered his mind, he saw another Death’s
Head dart at the window below and join the first one. But this
newcomer wore no tissue jacket.</p>

<p>Then, out of the darkness the Death’s Heads began to come to
the window below, swarms of them, startling him with the racket
of their wings.</p>

<p>From where did they arrive? They could not be the moths he liberated.
But.... <em>Were they?</em> Had some accident robbed their bodies
of the tissue missives? Had they blundered into somebody’s room
and been robbed?</p>

<p>Mystified, uneasy, he hung over his window sill, staring with
sickening eyes at the winged tumult below.</p>

<p>With patient, plodding logic he began to seek for the solution.
What attracted these moths to the room below? Was it the candle-light?
That alone could not be sufficient&mdash;could not contend with the
more imperious attraction, the subtle effluvia stealing out of
the north and appealing to the ruling passion which animated the
frantic winged things below him.</p>

<p>Patiently, methodically in his mind he probed about for some
clue to the solution. The ruling passion animating the feathery
whirlwind below was the necessity for mating and perpetuating
the species.</p>

<p>That was the dominant passion; the lure of candle-light a secondary
attraction.... Then, if this were so&mdash;and it had been proven to
be a fact&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;<em>what</em> was in that young girl’s
bedroom just below him?</p>

<p>Even as the question flashed in his mind he left the window,
went to his door, listened, noiselessly unlocked it.</p>

<p>A low murmur of voices came from the café.</p>

<p>He drew off both shoes, descended the stairs on the flat pads
of his large, bony feet, listening all the while.</p>

<p>Candle-light streamed out into the corridor from her open bedroom
door; and he crept to the sill and peered in, searching the place
with small, pale eyes.</p>

<p>At first he noticed nothing to interest him, then, all in an
instant, his gaze fell upon Madam Death under her prison of glass.</p>

<p>There she sat, her great bulging abdomen distended with eggs,
her lambent eyes shining with the terrible passion of anticipation.
For one thing only she had been created. That accomplished she
died. And there she crouched awaiting the fulfillment of her life’s
cycle with the blazing eyes of a demon.</p>

<p>From the café below came the cautious murmur of voices. The young
man already knew what they were whispering about; or, if he did
not know he no longer cared.</p>

<p>The patches of bright colour in his sunken cheeks had died out
in an ashen pallor. As far as he was concerned the world was now
ended. And he knew it.</p>

<p>He went into the bedroom and sat down on the bed’s edge. His
little, pale eyes wandered about the white room; the murmur of
voices below was audible all the while.</p>

<p>After a few moments’ patient waiting, his gaze rested again on
Madam Death, squatting there with wings sloped, and the skull
and bones staring at him from her head and distended abdomen.</p>

<p>After all there was an odd resemblance between himself and Madam
Death. He had been born to fulfill one function, it appeared.
So had she. And now, in his case as in hers, death was immediately
to follow. This was sentiment, not science&mdash;the blind lobe of
the German brain balancing grotesquely the reasoning lobe.</p>

<p>The voices below had ceased. Presently he heard a cautious step
on the stair.</p>

<p>He had a little pill-box in his pocket. Methodically, without
haste, he drew it out, chose one white pellet, and, holding it
between his bony thumb and forefinger, listened.</p>

<p>Yes, somebody was coming up the stairs, very careful to make
no sound.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;there were various ways for a Death’s Head Hussar to die
for his War Lord. All were equally laudable. God&mdash;the God of Germany&mdash;the
celestial friend and comrade of his War Lord&mdash;would presently
correct him if he was transgressing military discipline or the
etiquette of Kultur. As for the levelled rifles of the execution
squad, he preferred another way.... <em>This</em> way!...</p>

<p>His eyes were already glazing when the burly form of Sticky Smith
filled the doorway.</p>

<p>He looked down at Madam Death under the tumbler beside him, then
lifted his head and gazed at Smith with blinded eyes.</p>

<p>"Swine!" he said complacently, swaying gently forward and striking
the floor with his face.</p>
