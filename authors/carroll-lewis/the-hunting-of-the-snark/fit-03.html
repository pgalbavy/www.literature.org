<p>
They roused him with muffins&mdash;they roused him with ice&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They roused him with mustard and cress&mdash;<br/>
They roused him with jam and judicious advice&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They set him conundrums to guess.

</p>
<p>
When at length he sat up and was able to speak,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sad story he offered to tell;<br/>
And the Bellman cried "Silence!  Not even a shriek!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And excitedly tingled his bell.

</p>
<p>
There was silence supreme!  Not a shriek, not a scream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely even a howl or a groan,<br/>
As the man they called "Ho!" told his story of woe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an antediluvian tone.

</p>
<p>
"My father and mother were honest, though poor&mdash;"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Skip all that!" cried the Bellman in haste.<br/>
"If it once becomes dark, there’s no chance of a Snark&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have hardly a minute to waste!"

</p>
<p>
"I skip forty years," said the Baker, in tears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And proceed without further remark<br/>
To the day when you took me aboard of your ship<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help you in hunting the Snark.

</p>
<p>
"A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remarked, when I bade him farewell&mdash;"<br/>
&nbsp;"Oh, skip your dear uncle!" the Bellman exclaimed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he angrily tingled his bell.

</p>
<p>
"He remarked to me then," said that mildest of men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"‘If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:<br/>
Fetch it home by all means&mdash;you may serve it with greens,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it’s handy for striking a light.

</p>
<p>
"‘You may seek it with thimbles&mdash;and seek it with care;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may hunt it with forks and hope;<br/>
You may threaten its life with a railway-share;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may charm it with smiles and soap&mdash;’"

</p>
<p>
("That’s exactly the method," the Bellman bold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a hasty parenthesis cried,<br/>
"That’s exactly the way I have always been told<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the capture of Snarks should be tried!")

</p>
<p>
"‘But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your Snark be a Boojum!  For then<br/>
You will softly and suddenly vanish away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never be met with again!’

</p>
<p>
"It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think of my uncle’s last words:<br/>
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brimming over with quivering curds!

</p>
<p>
"It is this, it is this&mdash;" "We have had that before!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bellman indignantly said.<br/>
And the Baker replied "Let me say it once more.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this, it is this that I dread!

</p>
<p>
"I engage with the Snark&mdash;every night after dark&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dreamy delirious fight:<br/>
I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I use it for striking a light:

</p>
<p>
"But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment (of this I am sure),<br/>
I shall softly and suddenly vanish away&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the notion I cannot endure!"<br/>
