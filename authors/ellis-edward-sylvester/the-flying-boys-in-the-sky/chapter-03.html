<p>The barograph showed that the aeroplane was more than nine hundred
feet above the earth and the anemometer, or small wind wheel,
indicated that the speed was forty-odd miles an hour, with the
propeller making a thousand revolutions a minute. It was capable
of increasing that rate by twenty per cent. and the aviator was
gradually forcing it to do so.</p>

<p>The youth who sat in front, with the long control lever in his
right hand, was our friend Harvey Hamilton, who, under the instruction
of Professor Ostrom Sperbeck, the German aviator, had become so
expert that he felt equal to any emergency that was likely to
occur during his aerial excursions. The small levers on his left,
governed as we remember the spark and throttle, while the vertical
rudders were operated by the feet. So long as the heavens remained
calm or only moderate breezes were encountered, everything would
go as smoothly as if he were treading firm ground, but there was
no saying what troubles were likely to arise,—some of them with
the suddenness of a bolt from the blue.</p>

<p>Harvey had his back to the tank, which held ten gallons of gasoline,
or petrol as it is called on the other side of the ocean, and
two gallons of oil, one being as indispensable as the other.</p>

<p>In the aluminum seat just in front of the tank was Harvey’s passenger,
the support being adjustable and capable of carrying two persons
without threatening the center of gravity, provided care was used.
This passenger has already been introduced to you under the name
of Bohunkus Johnson, who was the bound boy of a neighboring farmer,
Mr. Cecil Hartley. He was a favorite with his easy-going master,
who sent him to the district school during winter and let him
do about as he pleased at other times. He had picked up the simplest
rudiments of a primary education and with the expenditure of a
good deal of labor could write, though he scorned to pay any attention
to so unimportant a matter as spelling.</p>

<p>Bunk and Harvey being of the same age, were playmates from earliest
childhood. The fact that they were of different races had no effect
upon their mutual regard. Being the son of a wealthy merchant,
the white youth was able to do many favors for his dusky comrade,
who, bigger and stronger, would have risked his life at any time
for him.</p>

<p>Although this particular flight was made on a sultry summer afternoon,
each lad wore thick clothing and a cap specially made for aviators,
as a protection against wind and cold. The first intention of
Harvey was to climb high enough in the sky to establish a record
for himself that would make all other rivals green with envy.</p>

<p>But not yet. There was too much fascination in coddling to the
earth, where the wonderful varied panorama was ever changing,
and always of entrancing novelty and beauty.</p>

<p>Bohunkus having little to do except use his eyes enjoyed the
visual feast to the full. At the beginning he studied the action
of Harvey, seated at his feet, having in view that thrilling hour
when he would be permitted to handle the levers and guide the
airship through space himself.</p>

<p>"I can do it as well as him," he said to himself; "de machine
sets on its three little wheels wid dere rubber tires, and de
propeller am started so fast dat yo’ can’t see de paddles spin
round; den dem dat am holding de same lets go and it runs ’bout
fifty yards, like lightnin’; den Harvey pulls de big lever back
and dat flat rudder out front am turned upward and de ting springs
into de air like a scared bird and dere yo’ am!"</p>

<p>As Bohunkus sat he grasped a bit of the framework on his right
and a corresponding support on his left. This was not always necessary,
for it was smooth sailing, but, as has been intimated, there was
no saying when a sudden squall or invisible pocket or hole in
the wind would shake things up, and force one to hold on for dear
life. He leaned slightly forward and looked down at the world
sweeping under him. They were skimming over a village, numbering
barely a score of buildings, the only noticeable one being the
white church with its tapering spire pointing toward the realm
to which erring men were directed. Just beyond the dusty winding
road disappeared into a wood a mile in extent, emerging on the
other side and weaving through the open country until it could
no longer be traced.</p>

<p>The river far to the left suggested a ribbon of silver, so small
that several tiny sails creeping over it appeared to be standing
still. To the right and front a large city was coming into clearer
view. The spires, skyscrapers and tall buildings were a vast jumble
in which he could identify nothing. He did not attempt even to
guess the name of the place.</p>

<p>A railway train was just leaving the village below them on its
way to the city in the distance. The youths saw the white puff
of steam from the whistle, which signalled its starting, and the
black belchings of smoke came faster and faster as the engine
rapidly gained headway. Harvey slightly advanced the lever and
the aeroplane began descending a little way in front of the train.
The contestants in this novel race should be nearer each other
to prevent any mistake and make the contest more exhilarating.</p>

<p>Two hundred feet from the ground, Harvey pulled back the lever
and the flat rudder on the front outrigger became horizontal.
The downward dip of the machine ceased and with a graceful curve
glided forward on a level course. No professional could have executed
the maneuver with more precision. Harvey during these few moments
decreased the revolutions of the propeller so as not to draw away
from the locomotive. The race should be a fair one, even if the
result was not in doubt.</p>

<p>This lagging caused the biplane to fall somewhat to the rear
and gave the train time to hit up its pace. The engineer and fireman
had caught sight of the machine some minutes before, and eagerly
accepted the challenge. Both were leaning out of the cab windows
and the engineer waved his hand at the contestant aloft. The fireman
swung his greasy cap and shouted something which of course the
youths were unable to catch. The passengers had learned what was
in the wind, and crowded the platforms and thrust their heads
from the windows, all saluting the aviator and intensely interested
in the struggle for mastery.</p>

<p>Harvey was too occupied with the machine to give much attention
to anything else. He knew he could rely upon Bohunkus for all
that was due in that line. The dusky youth was so wrought up that
he came startlingly near unseating himself more than once. He
leaned far over, circled his cap about his head and shouted and
whooped and kicked out his feet with delight. The laughing passengers
who stared into the sky, saw the black face with its dancing eyes,
bisected by an enormous grin, which displayed the rows of perfect
even teeth, and all learned what a perfectly happy African looks
like.</p>

<p>Jim Halpine, the engineer, said grimly to his fireman:</p>

<p>"I’ve heard about their flying faster than anything can travel
over the ground, but I’ll teach that fellow a lesson. Old 39 can
make a mile a minute as easy as rolling off a log; watch me walk
away from him."</p>

<p>He "linked her up" by drawing the reversing lever back until
it stood nearly on the center and dropped the catch in place.
Then the puffs came faster and faster, and not so loud, and 39
rapidly rose to her best pace. Having done all he could in that
direction, Jim kept his left hand on the throttle lever, and divided
his attention between peering out at the track in front and glancing
upward at the curious contrivance that was coursing through the
air just above him. The fact that it was creeping up caused no
misgiving, for that was manifestly due to the fact that he himself
had not yet acquired full headway.</p>

<p>Harvey meant to get all the fun possible out of the race. He
was certain he could beat the engine, but to do so "off the reel"
would spoil the enjoyment. He would dally for a time and when
defeat seemed impending, would dart ahead—always provided he should
be able to do so.</p>

<p>The locomotive had a straight away run of seven or eight miles,
when it would have to slow down for the city it was approaching.
The race therefore must be decided within the next ten minutes.</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton played his part well. The engine and train being
directly under him, his view of them was perfect without detracting
from the necessary attention to his biplane. He was just behind
the last car when he knew from the appearance of things that the
engineer had struck his highest pace. The youth speeded up the
motor so as slightly to add to the propeller’s revolutions, but
he showed no gain in swiftness. He was only holding his place.</p>

<p>The shouting passengers shouted still more, if that could be
possible, and called all sorts of tantalizing cries:</p>

<p>"Throw down your rope and we’ll give you a tow." "Get out and
run alongside of us!" "You ain’t racing with a cow." "We’re going
some!"</p>

<p>Such and similar were the good-natured taunts, which produced
no effect upon the aviators for they did not hear them. The most
exasperating gesture was that of Jim Halpine the engineer, who
leaned far out of his cab and gently beckoned to the youths to
come forward and keep him company. The fireman stood between the
cab and tender and imitated his chief.</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton seemed to see and hear them not. Bending far
over with the lever grasped, he acted as if trying to add to his
speed by the pose, as a person in his situation will sometimes
do unconsciously. His face was drawn, as if with tense anxiety,
and there was not the shadow of a smile upon it. All the same
he was chuckling inwardly.</p>

<p>Bohunkus Johnson was almost beside himself. At first he did not
doubt that a crushing triumph would speedily come to him and his
companion, but as the seconds flew by and there was no gain upon
the train thundering over the rails, a pang of doubt crept over
him.</p>

<p>"Go it, Harv! Put on more steam! What’s de matter wid yo’?" he
shouted, swinging his arms and hitching forward as if to add an
impulse to their progress. "If yo’ lose dis race I’ll jump overboard
and swim to land. Dem folks see me blushing now!"</p>

<p>Less than a minute later, the African shouted to unhearing ears:</p>

<p>"Glory be! Dat’s de talk! Now we’ve got ’em!"</p>

<p>The aeroplane was overtaking the train. Though the gain was slow
it was unmistakable. </p>
