<p>At this point I leave the report of the Commissary of Police,
M. Mifroid. The conclusion of it indeed is filled with the most
profound and philosophic reflections on the effect of companionship
in misfortune on the human heart; but they are not relevant to
the story of Theophrastus.</p>

<p>When the noise of the flying feet of M. Mifroid no longer came
echoing down the empty street, the heart of that unfortunate man
filled with the deepest melancholy. Here was that accursed Black
Feather again! Behold him in the flickering light of a street
lamp. He shakes his head. Ah! with what a lamentable air does
he shake his miserable and dolorous head! Of what is he dreaming,
unhappy wretch, that again and again he shakes his luckless head?
Doubtless the idea he had had of going back to disturb the peace
of his dear Marceline no longer appears to him reasonable. Plainly
he rejects it, for his heavy, lagging feet do not carry him towards
the heights of Gerando Street.</p>

<p>Some minutes later, he finds himself in Saint-Andrew-des-Arts
Place, and plunges into the dark passage of Suger Street. He rings
at a door. The door opens. In the passage a man in a blouse, with
a paper cap on his head and a lantern in his hand, asks him what
he wants.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Ambrose. You are still awake, are you&mdash;as late
as this?" said Theophrastus. "It's me. Oh, a lot of things have
happened since I last saw you!"</p>

<p>It was true. A lot of things had happened to M. Longuet since
he had last seen Ambrose, for he had not seen him since the day
on which he had learned from him the date of the water-mark on
the document found in the cellars of the Conciergerie.</p>

<p>"Come in, and make yourself at home," said Ambrose.</p>

<p>"I will tell you all about it to-morrow," said Theophrastus.
"But to-night I want to sleep."</p>

<p>Ambrose took him up to bed, and he slept the dreamless sleep
of a little child.</p>

<p>During the next few days Ambrose tried to induce Theophrastus
to speak; but, oddly enough, he preserved a complete silence.
He spent his time writing and writing. Once or twice he went out
at night. Once Ambrose asked him where he was going.</p>

<p>"A Commissary of Police, M. Mifroid, is writing an account of
a journey we took together," said Theophrastus. "And I am going
to ask him for a copy of it."</p>

<p>I am inclined to believe that one of these nights he must also
have returned to the flat in Gerando Street, by his favourite
chimney, and taken away from it the report, which M. Lecamus had
written for the Pneumatic Club, of the operation of M. Eliphas
de Saint-Elme de Taillebourg de la Nox. Also on one of those nights
he must have acquired the sandalwood box inlaid with steel; and
since Ambrose believes that he had but little money, it is not
improbable that when he acquired it he had his Black Feather.</p>

<p>One evening he came downstairs carrying a box, the sandalwood
box, under his arm; and with an air of gloomy satisfaction, he
said to Ambrose, "I have finished my literary labours; and I think
I will go and see my wife."</p>

<p>"I did not like to speak to you about her," said Ambrose quickly.
"Your gloom and your inexplicable behaviour made me afraid that
you had some domestic difficulties."</p>

<p>"She is as fond of me as ever!" cried Theophrastus with some
heat.</p>

<p>As he left the house, Ambrose said to him, "Be sure you remember
me very kindly to Marceline."</p>

<p>Theophrastus said that he would; but to himself he said:</p>

<p>"Marceline will never see me; she must never see me. Not even
the Catacombs have torn out my fatal Black Feather. I must not
trouble her peace. She <em>shall</em> never see me. But I &mdash;I
wish to see her once again, from afar, <em>to see if she is happy</em>."</p>

<p>He sobbed in the street.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>It is nine o'clock at night, a dark winter's night. Theophrastus
mounts the slope at the top of which rise the walls of Azure Waves
Villa. With a trembling hand he draws back the bolt of the little
door of the garden behind the house. He crosses the garden gently,
noiselessly, one hand pressed against his heart, which is beating
even more furiously than on the night of the purring of the little
violet cat&mdash;his good heart, his great heart, still overflowing
with love for the wife he wishes to see happy.</p>

<p>There is a light in the drawing-room; and the window is a few
inches open, for the night is muggy. You advance slowly, noiselessly
to a screening shrub, set down the sandalwood box, and peer through
the leafless branches into the cosy drawing-room.</p>

<p>Ah! what have you seen in the drawing-room?... Why that deep
groan? Why do you tear the white locks from your brow?... What
have you seen?... After all, does it matter what you have seen,
<em>since you are dead</em>? Did you not wish to see your wife
happy? Well, you see her happy!</p>

<p>She and M. Lecamus are sitting on the sofa. They are holding
one another's hand; they are gazing at one another with the eyes
of lovers. He kisses her, with respect but with devotion. He is
consoling her for the loss of you. You wished it. How can he better
console her than by replacing you?</p>

<p>Theophrastus, the gentle, kind-hearted manufacturer of rubber
stamps, perceives this. He drops on his knees on the cold, wet
grass, weeping tears of bitter resignation. He is reconciling
himself to the necessity of the cruel fact that they are sitting
in his comfortable drawing-room, and he is kneeling on his cold,
wet grass. He is almost reconciled to it; but not quite. What
is that that is thrusting, thrusting forth? <em>The upward thrust
of the Past</em>&mdash;<em>the Black Feather</em>!</p>

<p>The tears are drying in the eyes of Theophrastus. His eyes are
gleaming through the dim winter night with an evil gleam. He springs
to his feet; he grinds his teeth; he cries hoarsely:</p>

<p>"<em>By the throttle of Madame Phalaris!</em>"</p>

<p>The Past has him in its grip; he is racked by the pangs of the
old-time jealousy, and the pangs of the new. In three seconds
he is through the window and in the drawing-room. Wild screams
of terror greet his entrance; but in ten seconds more M. Lecamus
lies senseless in the big easy-chair, bound hand and foot with
the bell-rope. When he recovers his senses, the hand of the clock
has moved on ten minutes. Torn by fears and suspense, he listens
with all his ears. He hears faint movements on the floor above.
The minutes pass; twenty minutes pass. Then there is a sound of
heavy footsteps on the stairs. Theophrastus enters, once more
a changed Theophrastus: his eyes no longer gleam with an evil
light; they are full of unshed tears. His face is working with
intense emotion; and on his shoulder is a portmanteau.</p>

<p><em>What does that portmanteau contain?</em></p>

<p>Theophrastus, his face working with intense emotion, crosses
the room to his old friend. He wrings his hand, wrings it for
the last time; and in a broken voice, a voice full of tears, he
says:</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Adolphe! Good-bye, dear friend, for ever! I am going
to the <em>Seine near the Town Hall Bridge. I have to leave this
portmanteau.</em> And then I go into eternal exile!"</p>

<p>He loosed his grip of his friend's hand and, his face still working
with intense emotion, he went through the window, bearing the
portmanteau with astonishing ease.</p>

<p>M. Lecamus has never seen him again; he has never seen Marceline
again; he has never seen the portmanteau again. Does the unhappy
Theophrastus, luckless exile from the Paris he loves, wander through
the far East or the far West? Does he in the old eighteenth-century
fashion police Bagdad, or does he build up a rubber stamp business
in Chicago?</p>

<p>A new novel by the author of "Happy Hawkins"</p>

<p><em>THE KNIGHT-ERRANT</em></p>

<p>By <em>ROBERT ALEXANDER WASON</em></p>

<p>Author of "Happy Hawkins," etc., etc.</p>

<p>Illustrated by <em>HANSON BOOTH</em></p>

<p>$1.25 net; by mail, $1.37</p>

<p>A modern, city-bred "Happy Hawkins," one Philip Lytton by name,
a young man with ample fortune and excellent ideas about enjoying
the good things in life, takes to heart the taunts of his lady
love and engages entertainingly in business. Making a failure
of it in his simple, blundering way he leaves New York to seek
his fortunes in the Far West. Here Mr. Wason takes us over familiar
ground in that country that he knows so well and has already written
about so engagingly in <em>Happy Hawkins</em>, the country which
Dr. Crothers so well names "the land of the large and charitable
air."</p>

<p>Mr. Wason knows men and women, their strength and weakness, their
vices and virtues, and packed to the covers though it is with
incident, with suspense, with the essence of story interest, his
new book yet carries a strong moral. His fresh, spontaneous humor,
which the Nation has called "American humor in its best estate,"
flashes everywhere.</p>

<p>Someone has compared a Wason book to the wildwood, with its lights
and shadows, its lilting melodies, its sudden storms, its joyous
freedom. Editors, publishers, his friends, his critics, have all
objected to an apparent lack of technique in Mr. Wason's writing;
but he continues to mingle humor and pathos, the dramatic and
the argumentative, the tender and the cynical, with all the prodigality
and originality of old Nature herself. Of stories there is no
end; but in addition to a real story, a Wason book gives the reader
the rare privilege of intimate association with a broad, sympathetic
and discriminating personality. It is not necessary to agree with
him&mdash;he fattens on controversy&mdash;and the reader who enters into
the spirit of it can find much of what Stevenson calls the joy
of mental wrestling.</p>

<p>AN <em>UNUSUALLY POWERFUL NOVEL</em></p>

<p><em>HER HUSBAND</em></p>

<p>The Mystery of a Man</p>

<p>By <em>JULIA MAGRUDER</em></p>

<p>Author of "Princess Sonia," "A Heaven-Kissing Hill," etc., etc.</p>

<p>Illustrated by <em>LUCIUS WOLCOTT HITCHCOCK</em></p>

<p>$1.35 net; by mail $1.48</p>

<p>This is Miss Magruder's most powerful novel; in fact, it is the
novel on which, in her own opinion, her literary reputation will
rest. In it she displays to the full her command of the arts of
the storyteller, her ability to lead the reader breathlessly from
climax to climax, her power as a delineator of character, her
broad acquaintance with human nature and her knowledge of how
to express human emotions to their last, tingling vibrations.</p>

<p>The story centres around the puzzling character of Egbert Lothian.
And here indeed is a man who is a mystery from the very beginning
of the novel&mdash;in his wooing, in his courtship, in his marriage
to the remarkable heroine of the story,&mdash;the charming young American
girl whom this interesting, distinguished Scotchman so captivates&mdash;in
his married life&mdash;and who grows more and more remarkable and mystifying,
even to his wife, as the romance goes on, until near the close
of the story the wife and the reader are amazed and held breathless
at a disclosure of which neither she nor any one else had the
slightest hint or conception. Through the whole gamut of human
emotions the girl in this novel passes, and the reader follows
her and the man at her side with wonder and fascination.</p>

<p>During its publication in the columns of a current popular magazine
this novel created a storm of discussion. For serial purposes
the story was condensed to about half its length. In book form
it is now for the first time presented in its entirety.</p>

<p>AN <em>IMPORTANT AMERICAN NOVEL</em></p>

<p><em>THE MARRIAGE PORTION</em></p>

<p>By H. A. <em>MITCHELL KEAYS</em></p>

<p>Author of "The Road to Damascus," "He That Eateth Bread With
Me," etc.</p>

<p>$1.35 net; by mail, $1.48</p>

<p>In her new book, which is by far her most important, Mrs. Keays
discusses her favorite theme&mdash;marriage. She lays the scene of
her story in a modern university city which many readers will
recognize, and she portrays the life there with an unsparing,
but just, understanding. As usual, she develops her characters
with unerring skill. In fact, she depicts all her people, both
admirable and otherwise, so naturally, so truly, indeed so perfectly,
that the delighted reader will be inclined to believe that she
writes of real living, breathing, human beings, existing in the
flesh in the shadow of a great American university.</p>

<p>The story centers around Adela Cleave, a charming woman who,
after a brief marriage and an early widowhood, has won a considerable
reputation as an artist in Paris. Returning to her native land
to be with her father, an old and honored professor, she is at
first inclined to wonder whether life will offer in her new environment
so wide a scope for her interest in humanity as had been offered
to her delighted senses in Paris. But she early discovers that
almost without her knowing it her life is seemingly inextricably
entangled with the lives of a homogeneous yet strangely diverse
social structure. Her father, "Daddy Mark," as she calls him,
or Professor Kay, as he is known to his colleagues, is a most
lovable character, and it is many years since we have had in fiction
so keenly diverting a person as Mrs. Heming, Adela Cleave's aunt,
and a woman with an infinite capacity for martyrdom. The interplay
of interests in a university community is alertly realized in
the development of the absorbing plot, which shows the gradual
growth of as sweet, and tender a love-story as has been told by
any American novelist.</p>

<p>A <em>BULLY GOOD STORY</em>!</p>

<p><em>THE INCORRIGIBLE DUKANE</em></p>

<p>By <em>GEORGE C. SHEDD</em></p>

<p>Author of "The Princess of Forge," etc.</p>

<p>Illustrated by <em>STANLEY L. WOOD</em></p>

<p>$1.25 net; by mail, $1.37</p>

<p>If Jimmy Dukane hadn't been a "good fellow," he wouldn't have
got into so much trouble and if he <em>hadn't</em> been a good
fellow he wouldn't have&mdash;but that's the story!</p>

<p>He had been easily acquiring the record as Perpetual Holiday-Maker
for Broadway, when&mdash;well, "James A. Dukane, Sr., had, so to speak,
brought down his fist on the table with a bang. James A. Dukane,
<em>Jr.</em>, had been under the fist and his eyes popped open
very wide indeed." Dukane and Company were in the concrete construction
business and they were erecting a big dam clear out in Nevada.
The elder Dukane decided that the way to solve the problem of
what to do with Jimmy was to set him to work, so he sent him out
to "make a report" on the dam. He &mdash;Dukane, Sr.,&mdash;then vamoosed
for Europe and left young Jimmy to work out his own salvation.</p>

<p>"The green tail-lights of the train flickered, faded, then with
a sudden mischievous wink altogether disappeared; the last puffing
of the engine was like a hoarse chuckle.</p>

<p>"'Dumped in a puddle at eleven o'clock at night', Jimmy Dukane
vociferated resentfully.</p>

<p>"In the caravan just departed there was everything to comfort
the soul, to cheer the mind and moisten the palate&mdash;bright lights,
snug chairs, jolly companions, a well-stocked buffet. Here?&mdash;what
the deuce was here anyway except water? He faced about. A few
miserable beams of light escaped through the dingy depot window
out upon the wet platform and gleamed glassily along the rails;
some distance away in front of him glowed half a dozen misty,
luminous balls like swamp-lanterns, which he surmised to be windows.</p>

<p>"'The governor stung his son and heir this time', he remarked
in immense disgust."</p>

<p>That was only the beginning of it. Things started to happen at
once and when Jimmy woke up in the morning in this little sage-brush
town of Meldon and found his clothes and money gone and a tramp's
raiment in their place&mdash;with no money&mdash;he was naturally indignant.
But his indignation fell on deaf ears. Nobody knew him; he knew
nobody. He began to get hungry. What should he do?</p>

<p>What would <em>you</em> do?</p>

<p>The story of what he <em>did</em>&mdash;and incidentally of how he
met a charming girl by the name of Enid&mdash;is one of the most delightful
that have fallen to the lot of the novel-reader in many a day.
Youth&mdash;exuberant, unconquerable, "incorrigible" Youth&mdash;is in,
around and over it all.</p>

<p><em>ADVENTURE-HEROISM-LOVE</em></p>

<p><em>THE LOSER PAYS</em></p>

<p>A Story of the French Revolution</p>

<p>By <em>MARY OPENSHAW</em></p>

<p>Author of "The Cross of Honour"</p>

<p>$1.25 net; by mail, $1.37</p>

<p>In this, her second novel to be given to American readers, the
author of "The Cross of Honour" tells a fine, brave story that
will still further enhance the reputation won by her previous
book. "The Loser Pays" is the story of the devotion to love and
duty of no less a personage than Rouget de Lisle, the author of
the "Marseillaise." Many other writers have already taken the
French Revolution as their theme but Miss Openshaw is one of the
few who have made it vivid and human. In fact, it is not too much
to say that no one else, since Felix Gras wrote "The Reds of the
Midi," has given us a story of the French Revolution of so fine
a quality.</p>

<p>"A stirring tale, capitally recounted."&mdash;<em>London Times.</em></p>

<p>"The possibilities of the Revolution in France as a subject of
fiction are almost infinite, but they have seldom been used with
so keen a dramatic perception and at the same time so just a regard
for the main outlines of history as in Miss Openshaw's book."&mdash;<em>Glasgow
Herald.</em></p>

<p>"The story is so fascinating that the reader closes the book
only when he has reached the last page. 'The Loser Pays' will
be successful because the author has a good story to tell. It
may be recommended to all who like a dashing, romantic story full
of incident."&mdash;<em>Glasgow Citizen.</em></p>

<p>"There is really fine description of the September massacres.
The story deserves more than a transient place among recent fiction
of the Great Revolution."&mdash;<em>The Outlook (London).</em></p>

<p>AN <em>AMERICAN AND AN ENGLISH NOVEL OF PERMANENT IMPORTANCE</em></p>

<p><em>THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS</em></p>

<p>By H. A. <em>MITCHELL KEAYS</em></p>

<p>Author of "He That Eateth Bread with Me," etc.</p>

<p>$1.50 postpaid</p>

<p>The story of a young wife who, when it is proved to her that
another woman's boy should call her own husband father, adopts
the boy without ever letting her husband know. From, this basic
theme Mrs. Keays develops a dramatic and powerful story, "the
finest novel of social import," says Mr. Percival Pollard, in
his critical volume, "Their Day in Court," "written by an American
woman in recent times; one of those rare books proving that all
is not hopelessly chaff in the field of American fiction. 'The
Road to Damascus' is a book, and contains a character, worthy
of long life. The character of <em>Richarda</em> in this book
is one of the finest ever drawn by an American woman; the book
itself has perhaps the broadest view of life that has been shown
on our side of the water."</p>

<p>"A novel of remarkable power. It grips the attention like an
Ibsen drama."&mdash;<em>New York Times.</em></p>

<p>"It is all true," says Dean Hodges, "true to human nature and
the laws of God."</p>

<p>"I took up the 'Road to Damascus' after dinner," says Ida M.
Tarbell, "and did not lay it down until the end. It is a fascinating
handling of a difficult problem&mdash;a most successful handling, too."</p>

<p>By J. C. <em>SNAITH</em></p>

<p>Author of "Araminta," "Fortune," "Mistress Dorothy Marvin," etc.</p>

<p>$1.50 postpaid</p>

<p>A remarkable novel, that makes ordinary fiction pale in comparison.
Mr. Snaith has produced a book that holds its own among those
of Meredith, Dickens, and Thackeray. It is the story of an English
country family of the present day. "There is no living writer
in England or this country to whom it would not be a credit."&mdash;<em>Springfield
Republican.</em> "Almost alone of recent English fiction, it plays
with equal mastery on all the stops of human emotion."&mdash;<em>New
York Times.</em> "From the first moment Mr. Snaith makes your
attention his willing slave, you read with that rare vacillation
which urges you to hurry forward for the story and to linger for
the detail."&mdash;<em>Atlantic Monthly.</em> "An exceedingly lively
and diverting tragic comedy of men and old, acres. Mr. Snaith
has invention, energy, and ideas of his own. He has courage and
sympathy and the sovereign faculty of interesting his readers
in the fortunes of most of his dramatis personae. The author has
given us a delightful heroine, a wholly original hero, and a great
deal of entertainment, for which we offer him our hearty thanks."&mdash;<em>London

<p>"A really notable brief for democracy that everybody ought to
read."&mdash;<em>Nation.</em></p>

<p><em>ONE WAY OUT</em></p>

<p>A Middle-Class New-Englander Emigrates to America</p>

<p>By <em>WILLIAM CARLETON</em></p>

<p>$1.20 net; by mail, $1.32</p>

<p>In this remarkable narrative a man tells simply but with dynamic
power how at thirty-eight he lost his position in the office of
a big corporation; how he learned that the special training of
his own office was of no value in getting him a position in any
other office; how at thirty-eight he was already "too old" to
get such a position as he had found easily enough at eighteen;
how he and his wife and boy in their trim little suburban home
were actually confronted with the fundamental problem of how to
exist; how he met and solved that problem in a way unexpected
and dramatic, though to him and his wonderful wife, Ruth, obvious
and natural, by "emigrating" to America; and how in all their
struggle they found their lives enriched and inspired by the old
adventurous, pioneer spirit of their forefathers.</p>

<p>Once in a while a book appears which so profoundly impresses
the public mind that it wins its place as a force in public opinion.
Such a book <em>One Way Out</em> has proved itself to be.</p>

<p>"It is a simple story of a simple life, one of the most convincing
and interesting of its kind that I have seen in many a long day,
and, in my opinion, the book is one that is bound to be widely
read and thoughtfully discussed." &mdash;<em>JAMES L. FORD </em>in
The <em>New York Herald</em>.</p>

<p>"A rare volume: it has inspiration for the doubter, the man who
fears he cannot strike out for himself."&mdash;<em>Boston Advertiser.</em></p>

<p>"You have done more good in publishing <em>One Way Out</em> than
you will ever know," writes Dr. A. E. <em>WINSHIP, </em>editor
of the <em>Journal of Education</em>. "Will not some of the noble
rich buy a million copies and see that they are given to those
who need them?"</p>

<p>"A great adventure that has most gripping appeal."&mdash;<em>New York

<p>"A novel which deserves serious attention as an important contribution
to modern American fiction." &mdash;Nation.</p>

<p><em>THE GARDEN OF THE SUN</em></p>

<p>A Story of Army Life in the Philippines</p>

<p>By <em>CAPTAIN T. J. POWERS, U. S. A</em>.</p>

<p>Illustrated. $1.25 net; by mail, $1.37</p>

<p>The <em>Nation</em> says of <em>The Garden of the Sun</em>:</p>

<p>"Two things distinguish this story from the general run of military
novels. One is the vivacity of the dialogue, the other is the
beauty of its descriptive passages. Not that it is lacking in
action&mdash;there is battle, murder, and sudden death enough to stir
the most jaded reader of romance.</p>

<p>"The scene is laid in the Philippine Islands and the important
male characters, with one exception, are officers of the American
army. This exception is Tom Bennett, a rich <em>roué</em>, who
is touring the world in his yacht with his unhappy young wife
and her sister. Bennett and his party are attacked by Moro pirates
in the Sulu Sea and rescued by Capt Ballard and his men. Later
they visit the island of Jolo, where Capt Ballard is stationed.
Between him and Barbara, Bennett's wife, a strong friendship arises
which develops into love. The story of the relations of these
two attractive and well-drawn characters is varied by clever pictures
of the island life, of dances, of flirtations, of drinking bouts,
and of skirmishes with hostile natives.</p>

<p>"Many real and interesting types are introduced, among them a
wandering dancing girl, who calls herself La Belle Syria, but
is, in spirit and in language, redolent of New York's gay irresponsibility.
She uses expressive slang and is a charming, amusing creature.
But her place in the novel is not solely that of the comic relief.
She is partly responsible for the drunken brawl in which Bennett
receives the wound which causes partial paralysis. His helpless
condition brings back his wife, who had resolved to leave him.</p>

<p>"But the story does not end here. New complications ensue, in
which both Bennett and Ballard are severely tested and from which
they emerge heroically. The final chapters of the book, containing
a strong and unexpected dénouement, are admirable pieces of dramatic
writing. They form a fitting climax to a novel which deserves
serious attention as an important contribution to modern American
