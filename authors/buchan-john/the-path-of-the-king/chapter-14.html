<p>When Edward M. Stanton was associated at Cincinnati in 1857 with
Abraham Lincoln in the great McCormick Reaper patent suit, it
was commonly assumed that this was the first time the two men
had met. Such was Lincoln's view, for his memory was apt to have
blind patches in it. But in fact there had been a meeting fifteen
years before, the recollection of which in Stanton's mind had
been so overlaid by the accumulations of a busy life that it did
not awake till after the President's death.</p>

<p>In the early fall of 1842 Stanton had occasion to visit Illinois.
He was then twenty-five years of age, and had already attained
the position of leading lawyer in his native town of Steubenville
in Ohio and acted as reporter of the Supreme Court of that State.
He was a solemn reserved young man, with a square fleshy face
and a strong ill-tempered jaw. His tight lips curved downwards
at the corners and, combined with his bold eyes, gave him an air
of peculiar shrewdness and purpose. He did not forget that he
came of good professional stock &mdash;New England on one side
and Virginia on the other&mdash;and that he was college-bred, unlike
the common backwoods attorney. Also he was resolved on a great
career, with the White House at the end of it, and was ready to
compel all whom he met to admit the justice of his ambition. The
consciousness  of uncommon talent and a shining future gave him
a self-possession rare in a young man, and a complacence not unlike
arrogance. His dress suited his pretensions&mdash;the soft rich broadcloth
which tailors called doeskin, and linen of a fineness rare outside
the eastern cities. He was not popular in Ohio, but he was respected
for his sharp tongue, subtle brain, and intractable honesty.</p>

<p>His business finished, he had the task of filling up the evening,
for he could not leave for home till the morrow. His host, Mr.
George Curtin, was a little shy of his guest and longed profoundly
to see the last of him. It was obvious that this alert lawyer
regarded the Springfield folk as mossbacks&mdash;which might be well
enough for St. Louis and Chicago, but was scarcely becoming in
a man from Steubenville. Another kind of visitor he might have
taken to a chickenfight, but one glance at Stanton barred that
solution. So he compromised on Speed's store.</p>

<p>"There's one or two prominent citizens gathered there most nights,"
he explained. "Like as not we'll find Mr. Lincoln. I reckon you've
heard of Abe Lincoln?"</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton had not. He denied the imputation as if he were annoyed.</p>

<p>"Well, we think a mighty lot of him round here. He's Judge Logan's
law partner and considered one of the brightest in Illinois. He's
been returned to the State Legislature two or three times, and
he's a dandy on the stump. A hot Whig and none the worse of that,
though I reckon them's not your politics.... We're kind of proud
of him in Sangamon county. No, not a native. Rode into the town
one day five years back from New Salem with all his belongings
in a saddle-bag, and started business next morning in Joe Speed's
back room.... He's good company, Abe, for you never heard a better
man to tell a story. You'd die of laughing. Though I did hear
he was a sad man just now along of being crossed in love, so I
can't promise you he'll be up to his usual, if he's at Speed's
to-night."</p>

<p>"I suppose the requirements for a western lawyer," said Mr. Stanton
acidly, "are a gift of buffoonery and a reputation for gallantry."
He was intensely bored, and had small desire to make the acquaintance
of provincial celebrities.</p>

<p>Mr. Curtin was offended, but could think of no suitable retort,
and as they were close on Speed's store he swallowed his wrath
and led the way through alleys of piled merchandise to the big
room where the stove was lighted.</p>

<p>It was a chilly fall night and the fire was welcome. Half a dozen
men sat smoking round it, with rummers of reeking toddy at their
elbows. They were ordinary citizens of the place, and they talked
of the last horseraces. As the new-comers entered they were appealing
to a figure perched on a high barrel to decide some point in dispute.</p>

<p>This figure climbed down from its perch, as they entered, with
a sort of awkward courtesy. It was a very tall man, thin almost
to emaciation, with long arms and big hands and feet. He had a
lean, powerful-looking head, marred by ugly projecting ears and
made shapeless by a mass of untidy black hair. The brow was broad
and fine, and the dark eyes set deep under it; the nose, too,
was good, but the chin and mouth were too small for the proportions
of the face. The mouth, indeed, was so curiously puckered, and
the lower lip so thick and prominent, as to give something of
a comic effect. The skin was yellow, but stretched so firm and
hard on the cheek bones that the sallowness did not look unhealthy.
The man wore an old suit of blue jeans and his pantaloons did
not meet his coarse unblacked shoes by six inches. His scraggy
throat was adorned with a black neckerchief like a boot-lace.</p>

<p>"Abe," said Mr. Curtin, "I would like to make you known to my
friend Mr. Stanton of Ohio."</p>

<p>The queer face broke into a pleasant smile, and the long man
held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Glad to know you, Mr. Stanton," he said, and then seemed to
be stricken with shyness. His wandering eye caught sight of a
new patent churn which had just been added to Mr. Speed's stock.
He took two steps to it and was presently deep in its mechanism.
He turned it all ways, knelt beside it on the floor, took off
the handle and examined it, while the rest of the company pressed
Mr. Stanton to a seat by the fire.</p>

<p>"I heard Abe was out at Rochester helping entertain Ex-President
Van Buren," said Mr. Curtin to the store-keeper.</p>

<p>"I reckon he was," said Speed. "He kept them roaring till morning.
Judge Peck told me he allowed Mr. Van Buren would be stiff for
a month with laughing at Abe's tales. It's curious that a man
who don't use tobacco or whisky should be such mighty good company."</p>

<p>"I wish Abe'd keep it up," said another. "Most of the time now
he goes about like a sick dog. What's come to him, Joe?"</p>

<p>Mr. Speed hushed his voice. "He's got his own troubles.... He's
a deep-feeling man, and can't forget easily like you and me....
But things is better with him, and I kind of hope to see him wed
by Thanksgiving Day.... Look at him with that churn. He's that
inquisitive he can't keep his hands off no new thing."</p>

<p>But the long man had finished his inquiry and rejoined the group
by the stove.</p>

<p>"I thought you were a lawyer, Mr. Lincoln," said Stanton, "but
you seem to have the tastes of a mechanic."</p>

<p>The other grinned. "I've a fancy for any kind of instrument,
for I was a surveyor in this county before I took to law."</p>

<p>"George Washington also was a surveyor."</p>

<p>"Also, but not <em>LIKEWISE. I </em>don't consider I was much
of a hand with the compass and chains."</p>

<p>"It is the fashion in Illinois, I gather, for the law to be the
last in a series of many pursuits&mdash;the pool where the driftwood
from many streams comes to rest." Mr. Stanton spoke with the superior
air of one who took his profession seriously and had been trained
for it in the orthodox fashion.</p>

<p>"It was so in my case. I've kept a post-office, and I've had
a store, and I've had a tavern, and I kept them so darned bad
that I'm still paying off the debts I made in them." The long
man made the confession with a comic simplicity.</p>

<p>"There's a deal to be said for the habit," said Speed. "Having
followed other trades teaches a lawyer something about human nature.
I reckon Abe wouldn't be the man he is if he had studied his books
all his days."</p>

<p>"There is another side to that," said Mr. Stanton and his precise
accents and well-modulated voice seemed foreign in that homely
place. "You are also a politician, Mr. Lincoln?"</p>

<p>The other nodded. "Of a kind. I'm a strong Henry Clay man."</p>

<p>"Well, there I oppose you. I'm no Whig or lover of Whigs. But
I'm a lover of the Constitution and the law of the country, and
that Constitution and that country are approaching perilous times.
There's explosive stuff about which is going to endanger the stability
of the noble heritage we have received from our fathers, and if
that heritage is to be saved it can only be by those who hold
fast to its eternal principles. This land can only be saved by
its lawyers, sir. But they must be lawyers profoundly read in
the history and philosophy of their profession, and no catchpennny
advocates with a glib tongue and an elastic conscience. The true
lawyer must approach his task with reverence and high preparation;
for as his calling is the noblest of human activities, so it is
the most exacting."</p>

<p>The <em>POINT-DEVICE </em>young man spoke with a touch of the
schoolmaster, but his audience, who had an inborn passion for
fine words, were impressed. Lincoln sat squatted on his heels
on a bit of sacking, staring into the open door of the stove.</p>

<p>"There's truth in that," he said slowly. His voice had not the
mellow tones of the other's, being inclined to shrillness, but
it gave the impression of great power waiting on release somewhere
in his massive chest. "But I reckon it's only half the truth,
for truth's like a dollar-piece, it's got two sides, and both
are wanted to make it good currency. The law and the constitution
are like a child's pants. They've got to be made wider and longer
as the child grows so as to fit him. If they're kept too tight,
he'll burst them; and if you're in a hurry and make them too big
all at once, they'll trip him up."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Stanton, "but the fashion and the fabric should
be kept of the same good American pattern."</p>

<p>The long man ran a hand through his thatch of hair.</p>

<p>"There's only one fashion in pants&mdash;to make them comfortable.
And some day that boy is going to grow so big you won't be able
to make the old ones do and he'll have to get a new pair. If he's
living on a farm he'll want the same kind of good working pants,
but for all that they'll have to be new made."</p>

<p>Stanton laughed with some irritation</p>

<p>"I hate arguing in parables, for in the nature of things they
can't be exact. That's a mistake you westerners make. The law
must change in detail with changing conditions, but its principles
cannot alter, and the respect for these principles is our only
safeguard against relapse into savagery. Take slavery. There are
fools in the east who would abolish it by act of Congress. For
myself I do not love the system, but I love anarchy and injustice
less, and if you abolish slavery you abolish  every right of legal
property, and that means chaos and barbarism. A free people such
as ours cannot thus put the knife to their throat. If we were
the serfs of a monarchy, accustomed to bow before the bidding
of a king, it might be different, but a republic cannot do injustice
to one section of its citizens without destroying itself."</p>

<p>Lincoln had not taken his eyes from the stove. He seemed to be
seeing things in the fire, for he smiled to himself.</p>

<p>"Well," he drawled, "I reckon that some day we may have to find
some sort of a king. The new pants have got to be made."</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton shrugged his shoulders, and the other, quick to detect
annoyance, scrambled to his feet and stood looking down from his
great height at his dapper antagonist. A kindly quizzical smile
lit his homely face. "We'll quit arguing, Mr. Stanton, for I admit
I'm afraid of you. You're some years younger than me, but I expect
you would have me convinced on your side if we went on. And maybe
I'd convince you too, and then we'd be like old Jim Fletcher at
New Salem. You'll have heard about Jim. He had a mighty quarrel
with his neighbour about a hog, Jim alleging it was one of his
lot and the neighbour claiming it for his. Well, they argued and
argued, and the upshot was that Jim convinced the neighbour that
the hog was Jim's, and the neighbour convinced Jim that the hog
was the neighbour's, and neither of them would touch that hog,
and they were worse friends than ever."</p>

<p>Mr. Curtin rose and apologised to his companion. He had to see
a man about a buggy and must leave Mr. Stanton to find his way
back alone.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, George," said the long man. "I'm going round your
way and I'll see your friend home." As Mr. Stanton professed himself
ready for bed, the little party by the stove broke up. Lincoln
fetched from a corner a dilapidated carpet-bag full of papers,
and an old green umbrella, handle-less, tied with string about
the middle, and having his name sewn inside in straggling letters
cut out of white muslin. He and Stanton went out-of-doors into
the raw autumn night.</p>

<p>The town lay very quiet in a thin fog made luminous by a full
moon. The long man walked with his feet turned a little inwards,
accommodating his gait to the shorter stride of his companion.
Mr. Stanton, having recovered from his momentary annoyance, was
curious about this odd member of his own profession. Was it possible
that in the whirligig of time a future could lie before one so
uncouth and rustical? A democracy was an unaccountable thing,
and these rude westerners might have to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>"You are ambitious of a political career, Mr. Lincoln?" he asked.</p>

<p>The other looked down with his shy crooked smile, and the Ohio
lawyer suddenly realised that the man had his own attractiveness.</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir. I shouldn't like to say I was ambitious. I've
no call to be, for the Almighty hasn't blessed me with any special
gifts. You're different. It would be a shame to you if you didn't
look high, for you're a young man with all the world before you.
I'm getting middle-aged and I haven't done anything to be proud
of yet, and I reckon I won't get the chance, and if I did I couldn't
take advantage of it. I'm pretty fond of the old country, and
if she wants me, why, she's only got to say so and I'll do what
she tells me. But I don't see any clear road I want to travel.
..."</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, and Stanton, looking up at him, saw that
his face had changed utterly. The patient humorous look had gone
and it was like a tragic mask, drawn and strained with suffering.
They were passing by a little town cemetery and, as if by some
instinct, had halted.</p>

<p>The place looked strange and pitiful in the hazy moonlight. It
was badly tended, and most of the headstones were only of painted
wood, warped and buckled by the weather. But in the dimness the
rows of crosses and slabs seemed to extend into the far distance,
and the moon gave them a cold, eerie whiteness as if they lay
in the light of another world. A great sigh came from Lincoln,
and Stanton thought that he had never seen on mortal countenance
such infinite sadness.</p>

<p>"Ambition!" he said. "How dare we talk of ambition, when this
is the end of it? All these people&mdash;decent people, kind people,
once full of joy and purpose, and now all forgotten! It is not
the buried bodies I mind, it is the buried hearts....I wonder
if it means peace...."</p>

<p>He stood there with head bowed and he seemed to be speaking to
himself. Stanton caught a phrase or two and found it was verse&mdash;banal
verses, which were there and then fixed in his fly-paper memory.
"Tell me, my secret soul," it ran:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Oh, tell me, Hope and Faith,<br/>
Is there no resting-place<br/>
From sorrow, sin, and death?<br/>
Is there no happy spot<br/>
Where mortals may be blessed,<br/>
Where grief may find a balm<br/>
And weariness a rest?"

</p>
</div>
<p>The figure murmuring these lines seemed to be oblivious of his
companion. He stood gazing under the moon, like a gaunt statue
of melancholy. Stanton spoke to him but got no answer, and presently
took his own road home. He had no taste for histrionic scenes.
And as he went his way he meditated. Mad, beyond doubt. Not without
power in him, but unbalanced, hysterical, alternating between
buffoonery and these schoolgirl emotions. He reflected that if
the American nation contained much stuff of this kind it might
prove a difficult team to drive. He was thankful that he was going
home next day to his orderly life.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>Eighteen years have gone, and the lanky figure of Speed's store
is revealed in new surroundings. In a big square room two men
sat beside a table littered with the debris of pens, foolscap,
and torn fragments of paper which marked the end of a Council.
It was an evening at the beginning of April, and a fire burned
in the big grate. One of the two sat at the table with his elbows
on the mahogany, and his head supported by a hand. He was a man
well on in middle life with a fine clean-cut face and the shapely
mobile lips of the publicist and orator. It was the face of one
habituated to platforms and assemblies, full of a certain selfconscious
authority. But to-night its possessor seemed ill at ease. His
cheeks were flushed and his eye distracted.</p>

<p>The other had drawn his chair to the fire, so that one side of
him was lit by the late spring sun and one by the glow from the
hearth. That figure we first saw in the Springfield store had
altered little in the eighteen years. There was no grey in the
coarse black hair, but the lines in the sallow face were deeper,
and there were dark rings under the hollow eyes. The old suit
of blue jeans had gone; and he wore now a frock-coat, obviously
new, which was a little too full for his gaunt frame. His tie,
as of old, was like a boot-lace. A new silk hat, with the nap
badly ruffled, stood near on the top of a cabinet.</p>

<p>He smiled rather wearily. "We're pretty near through the appointments
now, Mr. Secretary. It's a mean business, but I'm a minority President
and I've got to move in zig-zags so long as I don't get off the
pike. I reckon that honest statesmanship is just the employment
of individual meannesses for the public good. Mr. Sumner wouldn't
agree. He calls himself the slave of principles and says he owns
no other master. Mr. Sumner's my notion of a bishop."</p>

<p>The other did not seem to be listening. "Are you still set on
re-enforcing Fort Sumter?" he asked, his bent brows making a straight
line above his eyes.</p>

<p>Lincoln nodded. He was searching in the inside pocket of his
frock-coat, from which he extracted a bundle of papers. Seward
saw what he was after, and his self-consciousness increased.</p>

<p>"You have read my letter?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have," said Lincoln, fixing a pair of cheap spectacles on
his nose. He had paid thirty-seven cents for them in Bloomington
five years before. "A mighty fine letter. Full of horse sense."</p>

<p>"You agree with it?" asked the other eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, no. I don't agree with it, but I admire it a lot and I
admire its writer."</p>

<p>"Mr. President," said Seward solemnly, "on one point I am adamant.
We cannot suffer the dispute to be about slavery. If we fight
on that issue we shall have the Border States against us."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking all the time about the Border States. We've got
to keep them. If there's going to be trouble I'd like to have
the Almighty on my side, but I must have Kentucky."</p>

<p>"And yet you will go forward about Sumter, which is regarded
by everyone as a slavery issue."</p>

<p>"The issue is as God has made it. You can't go past the bed-rock
facts. I am the trustee for the whole property of the nation,
of which Sumter is a piece, and if I give up one stick or stone
to a rebellious demand I am an unfaithful steward. Surely, Mr.
Secretary, if you want to make the issue union or disunion you
can't give up Sumter without fatally prejudicing your case."</p>

<p>"It means war."</p>

<p>Lincoln looked again at the document in his hand. "It appears
that you are thinking of war in any event. You want to pick a
quarrel with France over Mexico and with Spain over St. Domingo,
and unite the nation in a war against foreigners. I tell you honestly
I don't like the proposal. It seems to me downright wicked.</p>

<p>"If the Lord sends us war, we have got to face it like men, but
God forbid we should manufacture war, and use it as an escape
from our domestic difficulties. You can't expect a blessing on
that."</p>

<p>The Secretary of State flushed. "Have you considered the alternative,
Mr. President?" he cried. "It is civil war, war between brothers
in blood. So soon as the South fires a shot against Sumter the
sword is unsheathed. You cannot go back then."</p>

<p>"I am fully aware of it. I haven't been sleeping much lately,
and I've been casting up my accounts. It's a pretty weak balance
sheet. I would like to tell you the main items, Mr. Secretary,
so that you may see that I'm not walking this road blindfold."</p>

<p>The other pushed back his chair from the table with a gesture
of despair. But he listened. Lincoln had risen and stood in front
of the fire, his shoulders leaning on the mantelpiece, and his
head against the lower part of the picture of George Washington.</p>

<p>"First," he said, "I'm a minority President, elected by a minority
vote of the people of the United States. I wouldn't have got in
if the Democrats hadn't been split. I haven't a majority in the
Senate. Yet I've got to decide for the nation and make the nation
follow me. Have I the people's confidence? I reckon I haven't&mdash;yet.
I haven't even got the confidence of the Republican party."</p>

<p>Seward made no answer. He clearly assented.</p>

<p>"Next, I haven't got much in the way of talents. I reckon Jeff
Davis a far abler man than me. My friends tell me I haven't the
presence and dignity for a President. My shaving-glass tells me
I'm a common-looking fellow." He stopped and smiled. "But perhaps
the Lord prefers common-looking people, and that's why He made
so many of them.</p>

<p>"Next," he went on, "I've a heap of critics and a lot of enemies.
Some good men say I've no experience in Government, and that's
about true. Up in New England the papers are asking who is this
political huckster, this county court advocate? Mr. Stanton says
I'm an imbecile, and when he's cross calls me the original gorilla,
and wonders why fools wander about in Africa when they could find
the beast they are looking for in Washington. The pious everywhere
don't like me, because I don't hold that national policy can be
run on the lines of a church meeting. And the Radicals are looking
for me with a gun, because I'm not prepared right here and now
to abolish slavery. One of them calls me 'the slave hound of Illinois.'
I'd like to meet that man, for I guess he must be a humorist."</p>

<p>Mr. Seward leaned forward and spoke earnestly. "Mr. President,
no man values your great qualities more than I do or reprobates
more heartily such vulgar libels. But it is true that you lack
executive experience. I have been the Governor of the biggest
State in the Union, and possess some knowledge of the task. It
is all at your service. Will you not allow me to ease your burden?"</p>

<p>Lincoln smiled down kindly upon the other. "I thank you with
all my heart. You have touched on that matter in your letter....
But, Mr. Secretary, in the inscrutable providence of God it is
I who have been made President. I cannot shirk the duty. I look
to my Cabinet, and notably to you for advice and loyal assistance,
and I am confident that I shall get it. But in the end I and I
only must decide."</p>

<p>Seward looked up at the grave face and said nothing. Lincoln
went on:</p>

<p>"I have to make a decision which may bring war&mdash;civil war. I
don't know anything about war, though I served a month or two
in the Black Hawk campaign and yet, if war comes, I am the Commander-in-Chief
of the Union. Who among us knows anything of the business? General
Scott is an old man, and he doesn't just see eye to eye with me;
for I'm told he talks about 'letting the wayward sisters go in
peace.' Our army and navy's nothing much to boast of, and the
South is far better prepared. You can't tell how our people will
take war, for they're all pulling different ways just now. Blair
says the whole North will spring to arms, but I guess they've
first got to find the arms to spring to.... I was reviewing some
militia the other day, and they looked a deal more like a Fourth
of July procession than a battlefield. Yes, Mr. Secretary, if
we have to fight, we've first got to make an army.</p>

<p>Remember, too, that it will be civil war&mdash;kin against kin, brother
against brother."</p>

<p>"I remember. All war is devilish, but ours will be the most devilish
that the world has ever known. It isn't only the feeding of fresh
young boys to rebel batteries that grieves me, though God knows
that's not a thing that bears thinking about. It's the bitterness
and hate within the people. Will it ever die down, Mr. Secretary?"</p>

<p>Lincoln was very grave, and his face was set like a man in anguish.
Seward, deeply moved, rose and stood beside him, laying a hand
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"And for what, Mr. President?" he cried. "That is the question
I ask myself. We are faced by such a problem as no man ever before
had to meet. If five and a half million white men deeply in earnest
are resolved to secede, is there any power on earth that can prevent
them? You may beat them in battle, but can you ever force them
again inside the confines of the nation? Remember Chatham's saying:
'Conquer a free population of three million souls&mdash;the thing is
impossible.' They stand on the rights of democracy, the right
of self-government, the right to decide their own future."</p>

<p>Lincoln passed a hand over his brow. His face had suddenly became
very worn and weary.</p>

<p>"I've been pondering a deal over the position of the South,"
he said. "I reckon I see their point of view, and I'll not deny
there's sense in it. There's a truth in their doctrine of State
rights, but they've got it out of focus. If I had been raised
in South Carolina, loving the slave-system because I had grown
up with it and thinking more of my State than of the American
nation, maybe I'd have followed Jeff Davis. I'm not saying there's
no honesty in the South, I'm not saying there's not truth on their
side, but I do say that ours is the bigger truth and the better
truth. I hold that a nation is too sacred a thing to tamper with&mdash;even
for good reasons. Why, man, if you once grant the right of a minority
to secede you make popular government foolish. I'm willing to
fight to prevent democracy becoming a laughing-stock."</p>

<p>"It's a fine point to make war about," said the other.</p>

<p>"Most true points are fine points. There never was a dispute
between mortals where both sides hadn't a bit of right. I admit
that the margin is narrow, but if it's made of good rock it's
sufficient to give us a foothold. We've got to settle once for
all the question whether in a free Government the minority have
a right to break up the Government whenever they choose. If we
fail, then we must conclude that we've been all wrong from the
start, and that the people need a tyrant, being incapable of governing
themselves."</p>

<p>Seward wrung his hands. "If you put it that way I cannot confute
you. But, oh, Mr. President, is there not some means of building
a bridge? I cannot think that honest Southerners would force war
on such a narrow issue.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't but for this slavery. It is that accursed system
that obscures their reason. If they fight, the best of them will
fight out of a mistaken loyalty to their State, but most will
fight for the right to keep their slaves.... If you are to have
bridges, you must have solid ground at both ends. I've heard a
tale of some church members that wanted to build a bridge over
a dangerous river. Brother Jones suggested one Myers, and Myers
answered that, if necessary, he could build one to hell. This
alarmed the church members, and Jones, to quiet them, said he
believed his friend Myers was so good an architect that he could
do it if he said he could, though he felt bound himself to express
some doubt about the abutment on the infernal side."</p>

<p>A queer quizzical smile had relieved the gravity of the President's
face. But Seward was in no mood for tales.</p>

<p>"Is there no other way?" he moaned, and his suave voice sounded
cracked and harsh.</p>

<p>"There is no other way but to go forward. I've never been a man
for cutting across lots when I could go round by the road, but
if the roads are all shut we must take to open country. For it
is altogether necessary to go forward."</p>

<p>Seward seemed to pull himself together. He took a turn down the
room and then faced Lincoln.</p>

<p>"Mr. President," he said, "you do not know whether you have a
majority behind you even in the North. You have no experience
of government and none of war. The ablest men in your party are
luke-warm or hostile towards you. You have no army to speak of,
and will have to make everything from the beginning. You feel
as I do about the horror of war, and above all the horrors of
civil war. You do not know whether the people will support you.
You grant that there is some justice in the contention of the
South, and you claim for your own case only a balance of truth.
You admit that to coerce the millions of the South back into the
Union is a kind of task which has never been performed in the
world before and one which the wise of all ages have pronounced
impossible. And yet, for the sake of a narrow point, you are ready,
if the need arises, to embark on a war which must be bloody and
long, which must stir the deeps of bitterness, and which in all
likelihood will achieve nothing. Are you entirely resolved?"</p>

<p>Lincoln's sad eyes rested on the other. "I am entirely resolved.
I have been set here to decide for the people according to the
best of my talents, and the Almighty has shown me no other road."</p>

<p>Seward held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Then, by God, you must be right. You are the bravest man in
this land, sir, and I will follow you to the other side of perdition."</p>

<p><em>III</em></p>

<p>The time is two years later&mdash;a warm evening in early May. There
had been no rain for a week in Washington, and the President,
who had ridden in from his summer quarters in the Soldiers' Home,
had his trousers grey with dust from the knees down. He had come
round to the War Department, from which in these days he was never
long absent, and found the Secretary for War busy as usual at
his high desk. There had been the shortest of greetings, and,
while Lincoln turned over the last telegrams, Stanton wrote steadily.</p>

<p>Stanton had changed much since the night in the Springfield store.
A square beard, streaked with grey, covered his chin, and his
face had grown heavier. There were big pouches below the short-sighted
eyes, and deep lines on each side of his short shaven upper lip.
His skin had an unheathly pallor, like that of one who works late
and has little fresh air. The mouth, always obstinate, was now
moulded into a settled grimness. The ploughs of war had made deep
furrows on his soul.</p>

<p>Lincoln, too, had altered. He had got a stoop in his shoulders
as if his back carried a burden. A beard had been suffered to
grow in a ragged fringe about his jaw and cheeks, and there were
silver threads in it. His whole face seemed to have been pinched
and hammered together, so that it looked like a mask of pale bronze&mdash;a
death mask, for it was hard to believe that blood ran below that
dry tegument. But the chief change was in his eyes. They had lost
the alertness they once possessed, and had become pits of brooding
shade, infinitely kind, infinitely patient, infinitely melancholy.</p>

<p>Yet there was a sort of weary peace in the face, and there was
still humour in the puckered mouth and even in the sad eyes. He
looked less harassed than the Secretary for War. He drew a small
book from his pocket, at which the other glanced malevolently.</p>

<p>"I give you fair warning, Mr. President," said Stanton. "If you've
come here to read me the work of one of your tom-fool funny men,
I'll fling it out of the window."</p>

<p>"This work is the Bible," said Lincoln, with the artlessness
of a mischievous child. "I looked in to ask how the draft was
progressing."</p>

<p>"It starts in Rhode Island on July 7, and till it starts I can
say nothing. We've had warning that there will be fierce opposition
in New York. It may mean that we have a second civil war on our
hands. And of one thing I am certain&mdash;it will cost you your re-election."</p>

<p>The President did not seem perturbed. "In this war we've got
to take one step at a time," he said. "Our job is to save the
country, and to do that we've got to win battles. But you can't
win battles without armies, and if men won't enlist of their own
will they've got to be compelled. What use is a second term to
me if I have no country.... You're not weakening on the policy
of the draft, Mr. Stanton?"</p>

<p>The War Minister shrugged his shoulders. "No. In March it seemed
inevitable. I still think it is essential, but I am forced to
admit the possibility that it may be a rank failure. It is the
boldest step you have taken, Mr. President. Have you ever regretted
it?"</p>

<p>Lincoln shook his head. "It don't do to start regretting. This
war is managed by the Almighty, and if it's his purpose that we
should win He will show us how. I regard our fallible reasoning
and desperate conclusions as part of His way of achieving His
purpose. But about that draft. I'll answer you in the words of
a young Quaker woman who against the rules had married a military
man. The elders asked her if she was sorry, and she replied that
she couldn't truly say that she was sorry, but that she could
say she wouldn't do it again. I was for the draft, and I was for
the war, to prevent democracy making itself foolish."</p>

<p>"You'll never succeed in that," said Stanton gravely.</p>

<p>"If Congress is democracy, there can't be a more foolish gathering
outside a monkey-house."</p>

<p>The President grinned broadly. He was humming the air of a nigger
song, "The Blue-tailed Fly," which Lamon had taught him.</p>

<p>"That reminds me of Artemus Ward. He observes that at the last
election he voted for Henry Clay. It's true, he says, that Henry
was dead, but since all the politicians that he knew were fifteenth-rate
he preferred to vote for a first-class corpse."</p>

<p>Stanton moved impatiently. He hated the President's pocket humorists
and had small patience with his tales. "Was ever a great war fought,"
he cried, "with such a camp-following as our Congressmen?"</p>

<p>Lincoln looked comically surprised.</p>

<p>"You're too harsh, Mr. Stanton. I admit there are one or two
rascals who'd be better hanged. But the trouble is that most of
them are too high-principled. They are that set on liberty that
they won't take the trouble to safeguard it. They would rather
lose the war than give up their little notions. I've a great regard
for principles, but I have no use for them when they get so high
that they become foolishness."</p>

<p>"Every idle pedant thinks he knows better how to fight a war
than the men who are labouring sixteen hours a day at it," said
Stanton bitterly.</p>

<p>"They want to hurry things quicker than the Almighty means them
to go. I don't altogether blame them either, for I'm mortally
impatient myself. But it's no good thinking that saying a thing
should be so will make it so. We're not the Creator of this universe.
You've got to judge results according to your instruments. Horace
Greeley is always telling me what I should do, but Horace omits
to explain how I am to find the means. You can't properly manure
a fifty-acre patch with only a bad smell."</p>

<p>Lincoln ran his finger over the leaves of the small Bible he
had taken from his pocket. "Seems to me Moses had the same difficulties
to contend with. Read the sixteenth chapter of the book of Numbers
at your leisure, Mr. Secretary. It's mighty pertinent to our situation.
The people have been a deal kinder to me than I deserve and I've
got more cause for thankfulness than complaint. But sometimes
I get just a little out of patience with our critics. I want to
say to them as Moses said to Korah, Dathan, and Abiram&mdash;'Ye take
too much upon you, ye sons of Levi!'"</p>

<p>Lincoln's speech had broadened into something like the dialect
of his boyhood. Stanton finished the paper on which he had been
engaged and stepped aside from his desk. His face was heavily
preoccupied and he kept an eye always on the door leading to his
private secretary's room.</p>

<p>"At this moment," he said, "Hooker is engaged with Lee." He put
a finger on a map which was stretched on a frame behind him. "There!
On the Rappahannock, where it is joined by the Rapidan.... Near
the hamlet of Chancellorsville.... Battle was joined two days
ago, and so far it has been indecisive. Tonight we should know
the result. That was the news you came here to-night about, Mr.
President?"</p>

<p>Lincoln nodded. "I am desperately anxious. I needn't conceal
that from you, Mr. Stanton."</p>

<p>"So am I. I wish to God I had more confidence in General Hooker.
I never liked that appointment, Mr. President. I should have preferred
Meade or Reynolds. Hooker is a blustering thick-headed fellow,
good enough, maybe, for a division or even a corps, but not for
an army."</p>

<p>"I visited him three weeks back," said Lincoln, "and I'm bound
to say he has marvellously pulled round the Army of the Potomac.
There's a new spirit in their ranks. You're unjust to Joe Hooker,
Mr. Stanton. He's a fine organiser, and he'll fight&mdash;he's eager
to fight, which McClellan and Burnside never were."</p>

<p>"But what on earth is the good of being willing to fight if you're
going to lose? He hasn't the brains to command. And he's opposed
by Lee and Jackson. Do you realise the surpassing ability of those
two men? We have no generals fit to hold a candle to them."</p>

<p>"We've a bigger and a better army. I'm not going to be depressed,
Mr. Stanton. Joe has two men to every one of Lee's, he's safe
over the Rappahannock, and I reckon he will make a road to Richmond.
I've seen his troops, and they are fairly bursting to get at the
enemy. I insist on being hopeful. What's the last news from the
Mississippi?"</p>

<p>"Nothing new. Grant has got to Port Gibson and has his base at
Grand Gulf. He now proposes to cut loose and make for Vicksburg.
So far he has done well, but the risk is terrific. Still, I am
inclined to think you were right about that man. He has capacity."</p>

<p>"Grant stops still and saws wood," said Lincoln "He don't talk
a great deal, but he fights. I can't help feeling hopeful to-night,
for it seems to me we have the enemy in a fix. You've heard me
talk of the shrinking quadrilateral, which is the rebel States,
as I see the proposition."</p>

<p>"Often," said the other drily.</p>

<p>"I never could get McClellan rightly to understand it. I look
on the Confederacy as a quadrilateral of which at present we hold
two sides&mdash;the east and the south&mdash;the salt-water sides. The north
side is Virginia, the west side the line of the Mississippi. If
Grant and Farragut between them can win the control of the Father
of Waters, we've got the west side. Then it's the business of
the Armies on the Mississippi to press east and the Army of the
Potomac to press south. It may take a time, but if we keep a stiff
upper lip we're bound to have the rebels whipped. I reckon they're
whipped already in spite of Lee. I've heard of a turtle that an
old nigger man decapitated. Next day he was amusing himself poking
sticks at it and the turtle was snapping back. His master comes
along and says to him, 'Why, Pomp, I thought that turtle was dead.'
'Well, he am dead, massa,' says Pompey, 'but the critter don't
know enough ter be sensible ob it.' I reckon the Confederacy's
dead, but Jeff Davis don't know enough to be sensible of it."</p>

<p>A young man in uniform came hurriedly through the private secretary's
door and handed the Secretary for War a telegram. He stood at
attention, and the President observed that his face was pale.
Stanton read the message, but gave no sign of its contents. He
turned to the map behind him and traced a line on it with his
forefinger.</p>

<p>"Any more news?" he asked the messenger.</p>

<p>"Nothing official, sir," was the answer. "But there is a report
that General Jackson has been killed in the moment of victory."</p>

<p>The officer withdrew and Stanton turned to the President. Lincoln's
face was terrible in its strain, for the words "in the moment
of victory" had rung the knell of his hopes.</p>

<p>When Stanton spoke his voice was controlled and level. "Unlike
your turtle," he said, "the Confederacy is suddenly and terribly
alive. Lee has whipped Hooker to blazes. We have lost more than
fifteen thousand men. To-day we are back on the north side of
the Rappahannock."</p>

<p>Lincoln was on his feet and for a moment the bronze mask of his
face was distorted by suffering.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried. "What will the country say? What will the
country say?"</p>

<p>"It matters little what the country says. The point is what will
the country suffer. In a fortnight Lee will be in Maryland and
Pennsylvania. Your quadrilateral will not shrink, it will extend.
In a month we shall be fighting to hold Washington and Baltimore,
aye, and Philadelphia."</p>

<p>The bitterness of the words seemed to calm Lincoln. He was walking
up and down the floor, with his hands clasped behind his back,
and his expression was once again one of patient humility.</p>

<p>"I take all the blame," he said. "You have done nobly, Mr. Stanton,
and all the mistakes are mine. I reckon I am about the poorest
effigy of a War President that ever cursed an unhappy country."</p>

<p>The other did not reply. He was an honest man who did not deal
in smooth phrases.</p>

<p>"I'd resign to-morrow," Lincoln went on. "No railsplitter ever
laid down his axe at the end of a hard day so gladly as I would
lay down my office. But I've got to be sure first that my successor
will keep faith with this nation. I've got to find a man who will
keep the right course."</p>

<p>"Which is?" Stanton asked.</p>

<p>"To fight it out to the very end. To the last drop of blood and
the last cent. There can be no going back. If I surrendered my
post to any successor, though he were an archangel from heaven,
who would weaken on that great purpose, I should deserve to be
execrated as the betrayer of my country."</p>

<p>Into Stanton's sour face there came a sudden gleam which made
it almost beautiful.</p>

<p>"Mr. President," he said, "I have often differed from you. I
have used great freedom in criticism of your acts, and I take
leave to think that I have been generally in the right. You know
that I am no flatterer. But I tell you, sir, from my inmost heart
that you are the only man to lead the people, because you are
the only man whose courage never fails. God knows how you manage
it. I am of the bull-dog type and hold on because I do not know
how to let go. Most of my work I do in utter hopelessness. But
you, sir, you never come within a mile of despair. The blacker
the clouds get the more confident you are that there is sunlight
behind them. I carp and cavil at you, but I also take off my hat
to you, for you are by far the greatest of us."</p>

<p>Lincoln's face broke into a slow smile, which made the eyes seem
curiously child-like.</p>

<p>"I thank you, my old friend," he said. "I don't admit I have
your courage, for I haven't half of it. But if a man feels that
he is only a pipe for Omnipotence to sound through, he is not
so apt to worry. Besides, these last weeks God has been very good
to me and I've been given a kind of assurance. I know the country
will grumble a bit about my ways of doing things, but will follow
me in the end. I know that we shall win a clean victory. Jordan
has been a hard road to travel, but I feel that in spite of all
our frailties we'll be dumped on the right side of that stream.
After that..."</p>

<p>"After that," said Stanton, with something like enthusiasm in
his voice, "you'll be the first President of a truly united America,
with a power and prestige the greatest since Washington."</p>

<p>Lincoln's gaze had left the other's face and was fixed on the
blue dusk now gathering in the window.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," he said. "When the war's over, I think
I'll go home."</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>Two years passed and once again it was spring in Washington&mdash;about
half-past ten of the evening of the 14th of April &mdash;Good
Friday&mdash;the first Eastertide of peace. The streets had been illuminated
for victory, and the gas jets were still blazing, while a young
moon, climbing the sky, was dimming their murky yellow with its
cold pure light. Tenth Street was packed from end to end by a
silent mob. As a sponge cleans a slate, so exhilaration had been
wiped off their souls. On the porch of Ford's Theatre some gaudy
posters advertised Tom Taylor's comedy, Our American Cousin, and
the steps were littered with paper and orange peel and torn fragments
of women's clothes, for the exit of the audience had been hasty.
Lights still blazed in the building, for there was nobody to put
them out. In front on the side-walk was a cordon of soldiers.</p>

<p>Stanton elbowed his way through the throng to the little house,
Mr. Peterson's, across the street. The messenger from the War
Department had poured wild news into his ear,&mdash;wholesale murder,
everybody&mdash;the President&mdash;Seward &mdash;Grant. Incredulous he
had hurried forth and the sight of that huge still crowd woke
fear in him. The guards at Mr. Peterson's door recognised him
and he was admitted. As he crossed the threshold he saw ominous
dark stains.</p>

<p>A kitchen candle burned below the hat-rack in the narrow hall,
and showed further stains on the oilcloth. From a room on the
left hand came the sound of women weeping.</p>

<p>The door at the end of the passage was ajar. It opened on a bare
little place, once perhaps the surgery of some doctor in small
practice, but now a bedroom. A door gave at the farther side on
a tiny verandah, and this and the one window were wide open. An
oil lamp stood on a table by the bed and revealed a crowd of people.
A man lay on the camp-bed, lying aslant for he was too long for
it. A sheet covered his lower limbs, but his breast and shoulders
had been bared. The head was nearest to the entrance, propped
on an outjutting bolster.</p>

<p>A man was leaving whom Stanton recognised as Dr. Stone, the Lincoln
family physician. The doctor answered his unspoken question. "Dying,"
he said. "Through the brain. The bullet is now below the left
eye. He may live for a few hours&mdash;scarcely the night."</p>

<p>Stanton moved to the foot of the bed like one in a dream. He
saw that Barnes, the Surgeon-General, sat on a deal chair on the
left side, holding the dying man's hand. Dr. Gurley, the minister,
sat beside the bed. He noted Sumner and Welles and General Halleck
and Governor Dennison, and back in the gloom the young Robert
Lincoln. But he observed them only as he would have observed figures
in a picture. They were but shadows; the living man was he who
was struggling on the bed with death.</p>

<p>Lincoln's great arms and chest were naked, and Stanton, who had
thought of him as meagre and shrunken, was amazed at their sinewy
strength. He remembered that he had once heard of him as a village
Hercules. The President was unconscious, but some tortured nerve
made him moan like an animal in pain. It was a strange sound to
hear from one who had been wont to suffer with tight lips. To
Stanton it heightened the spectral unreality of the scene. He
seemed to be looking at a death in a stage tragedy.</p>

<p>The trivial voice of Welles broke the silence. He had to give
voice to the emotion which choked him.</p>

<p>"His dream has come true," he said&mdash;"the dream he told us about
at the Cabinet this morning. His ship is nearing the dark shore.
He thought it signified good news from Sherman."</p>

<p>Stanton did not reply. To save his life he could not have uttered
a word.</p>

<p>Then Gurley, the minister, spoke, very gently, for he was a simple
man sorely moved.</p>

<p>"He has looked so tired for so long. He will have rest now, the
deep rest of the people of God.... He has died for us all....
To-day nineteen hundred years ago the Son of Man gave His life
for the world.... The President has followed in his Master's steps."</p>

<p>Sumner was repeating softly to himself, like a litany, that sentence
from the second Inaugural&mdash;"With malice toward none, with charity
for all."</p>

<p>But Stanton was in no mood for words. He was looking at the figure
on the bed, the great chest heaving with the laboured but regular
breath, and living again the years of colleagueship and conflict.
He had been Loyal to him: yes, thank God! he had been loyal. He
had quarrelled, thwarted, criticised, but he had never failed
him in a crisis. He had held up his hands as Aaron and Hur held
up the hands of Moses....</p>

<p>The Secretary for War was not in the habit of underrating his
own talents and achievements. But in that moment they seemed less
than nothing. Humility shook him like a passion. Till his dying
day his one boast must be that he had served that figure on the
camp-bed. It had been his high fortune to have his lot cast in
the vicinity of supreme genius. With awe he realised that he was
looking upon the passing of the very great.... There had never
been such a man. There could never be such an one again. So patient
and enduring, so wise in all great matters, so potent to inspire
a multitude, so secure in his own soul.... Fools would chatter
about his being a son of the people and his career a triumph of
the average man. Average! Great God, he was a ruler of princes,
a master, a compeller of men.... He could imagine what noble nonsense
Sumner would talk.... He looked with disfavor at the classic face
of the Bostonian.</p>

<p>But Sumner for once seemed to share his feelings. He, too, was
looking with reverent eyes towards the bed, and as he caught Stanton's
gaze he whispered words which the Secretary for War did not condemn:
"The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places."</p>

<p>The night hours crawled on with an intolerable slowness. Some
of the watchers sat, but Stanton remained rigid at the bed-foot.
He had not been well of late and had been ordered a long rest
by his doctor, but he was not conscious of fatigue. He would not
have left his post for a king's ransom, for he felt himself communing
with the dying, sharing the last stage in his journey as he had
shared all the rough marches. His proud spirit found a certain
solace in the abasement of its humbleness.</p>

<p>A little before six the morning light began to pale the lamps.
The window showed a square of grey cloudy sky, and outside on
the porch there was a drip of rain. The faces revealed by the
cold dawn were as haggard and yellow as that of the dying man.
Wafts of the outer air began to freshen the stuffiness of the
little room.</p>

<p>The city was waking up. There came the sound of far-away carts
and horses, and a boy in the lane behind the house began to whistle,
and then to sing. "When I was young," he sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"When I was young I used to wait<br/>
At Magea'n table 'n' hand de plate<br/>
An' pais de bottie when he was dry,<br/>
An' brush away de blue-tailed fly."

</p>
</div>
<p>"It's his song," Stanton said to himself, and with the air came
a rush of strange feelings. He remembered a thousand things, which
before had been only a background of which he had been scarcely
conscious. The constant kindliness, the gentle healing sympathy,
the homely humour which he once thought had irritated but which
he now knew had soothed him.... This man had been twined round
the roots of every heart. All night he had been in an ecstasy
of admiration, but now that was forgotten in a yearning love.
The President had been part of his being, closer to him than wife
or child. The boy sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"But I can't forget, until I die<br/>
Ole Massa an' de blue-tailed fly."

</p>
</div>
<p>Stanton's eyes filled with hot tears. He had not wept since his
daughter died.</p>

<p>The breathing from the bed was growing faint. Suddenly the Surgeon-General
held up his hand. He felt the heart and shook his head. "Fetch
your mother," he said to Robert Lincoln. The minister had dropped
on his knees by the bedside and was praying.</p>

<p>"The President is dead," said the Surgeon-General, and at the
words it seemed that every head in the room was bowed on the breast.</p>

<p>Stanton took a step forward with a strange appealing motion of
the arms. It was noted by more than one that his pale face was
transfigured.</p>

<p>"Yesterday he was America's," he cried. "Our very own. Now he
is all the world's.... Now he belongs to the ages."</p>

<p><em>EPILOGUE</em></p>

<p>Mr. Francis Hamilton, an honorary attache of the British Embassy,
stood on the steps of the Capitol watching the procession which
bore the President's body from the White House to lie in state
in the great Rotunda. He was a young man of some thirty summers,
who after a distinguished Oxford career was preparing himself
with a certain solemnity for the House of Commons. He sought to
be an authority on Foreign affairs, and with this aim was making
a tour among the legations. Two years before he had come to Washington,
intending to remain for six months, and somewhat to his own surprise
had stayed on, declining to follow his kinsman Lord Lyons to Constantinople.
Himself a staunch follower of Mr. Disraeli, and an abhorrer of
Whiggery in all its forms, he yet found in America's struggle
that which appealed both to his brain and his heart. He was a
believer, he told himself, in the Great State and an opponent
of parochialism; so, unlike most of his friends at home, his sympathies
were engaged for the Union. Moreover he seemed to detect in the
protagonists a Roman simplicity pleasing to a good classic.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton was sombrely but fashionably dressed and wore a
gold eyeglass on a black ribbon, because he fancied that a monocle
adroitly used was a formidable weapon in debate. He had neat small
sidewhiskers, and a pleasant observant eye. With him were young
Major Endicott from Boston and the eminent Mr. Russell Lowell,
who, as Longfellow's successor in the Smith Professorship and
one of the editors of The North American Review, was a great figure
in cultivated circles. Both were acquaintances made by Mr. Hamilton
on a recent visit to Harvard. He found it agreeable to have a
few friends with whom he could have scholarly talk.</p>

<p>The three watched the procession winding through the mourning
streets. Every house was draped in funeral black, the passing
bell tolled from every church, and the minute-guns boomed at the
City Hall and on Capitol Hill. Mr. Hamilton regarded the cortege
at first with a critical eye. The events of the past week had
wrought in him a great expectation, which he feared would be disappointed.
It needed a long tradition to do fitting honour to the man who
had gone. Had America such a tradition? he asked himself.... The
coloured troops marching at the head of the line pleased him.
That was a happy thought. He liked, too, the business-like cavalry
and infantry, and the battered field-pieces.... He saw his Chief
among the foreign Ministers, bearing a face of portentous solemnity....
But he liked best the Illinois and Kentucky delegates; he thought
the dead President would have liked them too.</p>

<p>Major Endicott was pointing out the chief figures. "There's Grant...
and Stanton, looking more cantankerous than ever. They say he's
brokenhearted." But Mr. Hamilton had no eye for celebrities. He
was thinking rather of those plain mourners from the west, and
of the poorest house in Washington decked with black. This is
a true national sorrow, he thought. He had been brought up as
a boy from Eton to see Wellington's funeral, and the sight had
not impressed him like this. For the recent months had awakened
odd emotions in his orderly and somewhat cynical soul. He had
discovered a hero.</p>

<p>The three bared their heads as the long line filed by. Mr. Lowell
said nothing. Now and then he pulled at his moustaches as if to
hide some emotion which clamoured for expression. The mourners
passed into the Capitol, while the bells still tolled and the
guns boomed. The cavalry escort formed up on guard; from below
came the sound of sharp commands.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton was shaken out of the admirable detachment which
he had cultivated. He wanted to sit down and sob like a child.
Some brightness had died in the air, some great thing had gone
for ever from the world and left it empty. He found himself regarding
the brilliant career which he had planned for himself with a sudden
disfavour. It was only second-rate after all, that glittering
old world of courts and legislatures and embassies. For a moment
he had had a glimpse of the firstrate, and it had shivered his
pretty palaces. He wanted now something which he did not think
he would find again.</p>

<p>The three turned to leave, and at last Mr. Lowell spoke.</p>

<p>"There goes," he said, "the first American!"</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton heard the words as he was brushing delicately with
his sleeve a slight berufflement of his silk hat.</p>

<p>"I dare say you are right, Professor," he said. "But I think
it is also the last of the Kings."</p>
