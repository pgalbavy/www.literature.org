<p>Great excitement prevailed when Rouletabille had finished. The
court-room became agitated with the murmurings of suppressed applause.
Maitre Henri Robert called for an adjournment of the trial and
was supported in his motion by the public prosecutor himself.
The case was adjourned. The next day Monsieur Robert Darzac was
released on bail, while Daddy Jacques received the immediate benefit
of a "no cause for action." Search was everywhere made for Frederic
Larsan, but in vain. Monsieur Darzac finally escaped the awful
calamity which, at one time, had threatened him. After a visit
to Mademoiselle Stangerson, he was led to hope that she might,
by careful nursing, one day recover her reason.</p>

<p>Rouletabille, naturally, became the "man of the hour." On leaving
the Palais de Justice, the crowd bore him aloft in triumph. The
press of the whole world published his exploits and his photograph.
He, who had interviewed so many illustrious personages, had himself
become illustrious and was interviewed in his turn. I am glad
to say that the enormous success in no way turned his head.</p>

<p>We left Versailles together, after having dined at "The Dog That
Smokes." In the train I put a number of questions to him which,
during our meal, had been on the tip of my tongue, but which I
had refrained from uttering, knowing he did not like to talk "shop"
while eating.</p>

<p>"My friend," I said, "that Larsan case is wonderful. It is worthy
of you."</p>

<p>He begged me to say no more, and humorously pretended an anxiety
for me should I give way to silly praise of him because of a personal
admiration for his ability.</p>

<p>"I’ll come to the point, then," I said, not a little nettled.
"I am still in the dark as to your reason for going to America.
When you left the Glandier you had found out, if I rightly understand,
all about Frederic Larsan; you had discovered the exact way he
had attempted the murder?"</p>

<p>"Quite so. And you," he said, turning the conversation, "did
you suspect nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!"</p>

<p>"It’s incredible!"</p>

<p>"I don’t see how I could have suspected anything. You took great
pains to conceal your thoughts from me. Had you already suspected
Larsan when you sent for me to bring the revolvers?"</p>

<p>"Yes! I had come to that conclusion through the incident of the
‘inexplicable gallery.’ Larsan’s return to Mademoiselle Stangerson’s
room, however, had not then been cleared up by the eye-glasses.
My suspicions were the outcome of my reasoning only; and the idea
of Larsan being the murderer seemed so extraordinary that I resolved
to wait for actual evidence before venturing to act. Nevertheless,
the suspicion worried me, and I sometimes spoke to the detective
in a way that ought to have opened your eyes. I spoke disparagingly
of his methods. But until I found the eye-glasses I could but
look upon my suspicion of him in the light of an absurd hypothesis
only. You can imagine my elation after I had explained Larsan’s
movements. I remember well rushing into my room like a mad-man
and crying to you: ‘I’ll get the better of the great Fred. I’ll
get the better of him in a way that will make a sensation!’</p>

<p>"I was then thinking of Larsan, the murderer. It was that same
evening that Darzac begged me to watch over Mademoiselle Stangerson.
I made no efforts until after we had dined with Larsan, until
ten o’clock. He was right there before me, and I could afford
to wait. You ought to have suspected, because when we were talking
of the murderer’s arrival, I said to you: ‘I am quite sure Larsan
will be here to-night.’</p>

<p>"But one important point escaped us both. It was one which ought
to have opened our eyes to Larsan. Do you remember the bamboo
cane? I was surprised to find Larsan had made no use of that evidence
against Robert Darzac. Had it not been purchased by a man whose
description tallied exactly with that of Darzac? Well, just before
I saw him off at the train, after the recess during the trial,
I asked him why he hadn’t used the cane evidence. He told me he
had never had any intention of doing so; that our discovery of
it in the little inn at Epinay had much embarrassed him. If you
will remember, he told us then that the cane had been given him
in London. Why did we not immediately say to ourselves: ‘Fred
is lying. He could not have had this cane in London. He was not
in London. He bought it in Paris’? Then you found out, on inquiry
at Cassette’s, that the cane had been bought by a person dressed
very like Robert Darzac, though, as we learned later, from Darzac
himself, it was not he who had made the purchase. Couple this
with the fact we already knew, from the letter at the poste restante,
that there was actually a man in Paris who was passing as Robert
Darzac, why did we not immediately fix on Fred himself?</p>

<p>"Of course, his position at the Surete was against us; but when
we saw the evident eagerness on his part to find convicting evidence
against Darzac, nay, even the passion he displayed in his pursuit
of the man, the lie about the cane should have had a new meaning
for us. If you ask why Larsan bought the cane, if he had no intention
of manufacturing evidence against Darzac by means of it, the answer
is quite simple. He had been wounded in the hand by Mademoiselle
Stangerson, so that the cane was useful to enable him to close
his hand in carrying it. You remember I noticed that he always
carried it?</p>

<p>"All these details came back to my mind when I had once fixed
on Larsan as the criminal. But they were too late then to be of
any use to me. On the evening when he pretended to be drugged
I looked at his hand and saw a thin silk bandage covering the
signs of a slight healing wound. Had we taken a quicker initiative
at the time Larsan told us that lie about the cane, I am certain
he would have gone off, to avoid suspicion. All the same, we worried
Larsan or Ballmeyer without our knowing it."</p>

<p>"But," I interrupted, "if Larsan had no intention of using the
cane as evidence against Darzac, why had he made himself up to
look like the man when he went in to buy it?"</p>

<p>"He had not specially ‘made up’ as Darzac to buy the cane; he
had come straight to Cassette’s immediately after he had attacked
Mademoiselle Stangerson. His wound was troubling him and, as he
was passing along the Avenue de l’Opera, the idea of the cane
came to his mind and he acted on it. It was then eight o’clock.
And I, who had hit upon the very hour of the occurrence of the
tragedy, almost convinced that Darzac was not the criminal, and
knowing of the cane, I still never suspected Larsan. There are
times..."</p>

<p>"There are times," I said, "when the greatest intellects&mdash;..." 
Rouletabille shut my mouth. I still continued to chide him, but,
finding he did not reply, I saw he was no longer paying any attention
to what I was saying. I found he was fast asleep.</p>
