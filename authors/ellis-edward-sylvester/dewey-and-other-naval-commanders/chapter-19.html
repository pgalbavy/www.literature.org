<p>Resentment of the Barbary States&mdash;The War with Algiers &mdash;Captain
Decatur's Vigorous Course &mdash;His Astonishing Success as a
Diplomat.</p>

<p>It was not alone in our wars with the leading nations that the
American navy won glory. Wherever there arose a demand for its
work, its patriotism, skill and bravery were instant to respond.</p>

<p>England had its hands full during the early years of the nineteenth
century in combating Napoleon Bonaparte and other nations with
which she became embroiled. Had she been wise and treated the
United States with justice, she would have saved herself the many
humiliations received at our hands. She is another nation to-day,
but it was wholly her fault that her "children" on this side of
the ocean were forced to strike for the defence of their rights
in the Revolution and the War of 1812.</p>

<p>In the account of our war with Tripoli it has been shown that
the young American navy performed brilliant service. The Barbary
States took naturally to piracy, and Great Britain, by securing
immunity for her vessels through the payment of tribute, also
secured a virtual monopoly of the commerce of the Mediterranean.
Her policy was a selfish one, for she believed the United States
was too weak to send any effective warships into that part of
the world. The story of Tripoli convinced her of the mistake of
this belief.</p>

<p>The Barbary States were sour over their defeat, and, when the
War of 1812 broke out, they eagerly seized the occasion to pick
a quarrel with us. The Dey of Algiers opened the ball by insisting
that $27,000 should be paid him, the same being past due (under
the old treaty providing for tribute from the United States),
owing to the difference in the methods of computing time by the
two countries. Since our war with England prevented the sending
of any force to the Mediterranean at that time, the consul complied
and the blackmail was handed to the Dey.</p>

<p>This concession only whetted the barbarian's appetite, and his
next step was to order the consul to leave the country, since
he was not honest enough to make his residence in the Dey's dominions
congenial to the latter. About that time the Dey received a present
of valuable naval stores from England, and he lost no time in
sending out his corsairs to prey upon American commerce.</p>

<p>Tripoli and Tunis were not so active, but believing the British
boast that they would sweep the American navy from the seas, they
allowed the warships of that nation to recapture several prizes
that the American privateers had sent into their ports. Their
sympathies were wholly with England and against the United States,
which they hated with an intensity natural to their savage nature.</p>

<p>The United States bided its time. No sooner had the War of 1812
closed than our Government decided to give its attention to Algiers,
whose defiant Dey had not only refused to allow his American prisoners
to be ransomed, but had insolently declared that he meant to add
a good many more to them.</p>

<p>Hardly had the treaty with England been proclaimed when two squadrons
were ordered into Algerian waters. The first was under the command
of Captain William Bainbridge and assembled at Boston, and the
second, under Captain Stephen Decatur, was organized at New York.
Decatur was the first to get under way, sailing on May 20 with
a squadron consisting of ten vessels, mounting 210 guns. He had
under his direct command nearly all the seamen who had served
under him and survived the last war.</p>

<p>It may seem that Decatur had an easy task before him, but Maclay
shows that the force against which he sailed was really the stronger.
It consisted of 5 frigates, 6 sloops of war and 1 schooner&mdash;all
carrying 360 guns, which exceeded those of the American squadron
by 50 per cent. The Algerian admiral was the terror of the Mediterranean.
He had risen from the lowest to the highest rank by his indomitable
valor and skill. He once captured by boarding in broad daylight
a Portuguese frigate within sight of Gibraltar. He had performed
other valiant exploits; his ships were well equipped and manned,
and the crews trained in modern warfare.</p>

<p>In addition, the city of Algiers was so strongly fortified that
Lord Nelson declared that twenty-five ships of the line would
not be more than enough to capture it. As Decatur drew near the
Portugal coast he made guarded inquiries as to the whereabouts
of the Algerian squadron. He used the utmost care to prevent his
presence from becoming known to the enemy, and finally heard that
which led him to believe the Moorish admiral had passed through
the Straits of Gibraltar and entered the Mediterranean. At Gibraltar
Decatur saw several boats hurrying off to Algiers to warn his
enemy of his danger. He made sail up the Mediterranean, hoping
to beat the despatch boats. The admiral's flagship was descried,
and, still striving to avert suspicion, the American ships worked
gradually toward him. Before they could get within range the Moorish
admiral took the alarm, and, crowding on every stitch of canvas,
made a resolute effort to escape. He handled his ship with great
skill, and Decatur feared he would succeed in reaching some neutral
port or elude him in the night, which was near at hand.</p>

<p>A hot chase followed, and the Turks soon opened on the American
flagship and wounded several men, but Decatur reserved his fire
until able to deliver one of his fearful broadsides. A shot literally
cut the Moorish admiral in two. A few minutes later a second broadside
was fired, but no signal of surrender was made, and the men in
the tops continued firing until the American marines picked them
off. Seeing there was no escape for the enemy, and wishing to
save the unnecessary shedding of blood, Decatur took a position
off the frigate's bow, whereupon she made a vigorous effort to
escape.</p>

<p>In doing this, she headed directly for the 18-gun brig <em>Epervier</em>,
which was in danger of being run down; but the plucky master-commandant,
John Downes, backed and filled away with wonderful skill, chased
the flying frigate, delivered nine diminutive broadsides and compelled
the Turk to strike his colors.</p>

<p>Upon taking possession of the prize it was found that 30 had
been killed and there were 406 prisoners. On the <em>Guerriere</em>
3 had fallen and 11 were wounded by the fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>Believing that the rest of the Algerian squadron would make haste
to their home port, Decatur hastened thither with the view of
cutting them off. If the Dey refused to come to terms, he intended
to blockade the squadron and bombard the city. It was on the 28th
of June, 1815, that the American fleet appeared off Algiers, and
the commander signalled a request for the Swedish consul to come
aboard. He came out a few hours later, accompanied by the Algerian
captain of the port. When Decatur proved by the testimony of one
of the native prisoners that their admiral had been killed and
his ship and a second one captured, the officer was astounded,
and so alarmed that he asked the American commander on what terms
he would make peace.</p>

<p>Decatur was prepared for this question, and produced a letter
to the Dey from the President of the United States, in which it
was declared that the only conditions upon which peace could be
made was the full and final relinquishment by Algiers of all claim
to tribute in the future, and the guarantee that American commerce
would not be molested. The captain, like all Orientals, began
to quibble to gain time, asking that the commissioners should
land and conduct the negotiations on shore. Decatur replied that
they must be negotiated on board the <em>Guerriere</em> and nowhere
else.</p>

<p>The next day the Moorish captain returned with full powers to
negotiate. Decatur now notified him that, in addition to the terms
already named, every American prisoner must be given up without
ransom, and the value, to the last penny, of their stolen property
restored. Other minor demands were added, all of which were within
the province of Decatur, who had been clothed with full authority
to make peace. The captain asked for a truce that he might lay
the terms before the Dey. This was denied. Then he asked for a
delay of three hours.</p>

<p>"Not three minutes," replied Decatur; "if the remaining ships
of your squadron appear before the treaty is signed, or before
every American prisoner is on board this ship, I will capture
every one of them."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>CAPTAIN BAINBRIDGE AND THE DEY OF ALGIERS</em>.]</p>

<p>The Moor was thoroughly cowed by the aggressive American, and,
promising to do all he could to secure the consent of the Dey,
he was hastily rowed ashore. It was understood that if the Dey
agreed to the terms the captain would return in the boat with
a white flag displayed at the bow.</p>

<p>He had been gone but a short time when an Algerian ship of war
was discovered, crowded with soldiers and approaching. Decatur
instantly cleared for action, and had started to meet the enemy,
when the port captain was observed approaching as rapidly in his
boat as his men could row, and with the white signal fluttering
from the bow. All the Americans, including Decatur, were disappointed,
but as he had promised, he waited until the boat was within hail.
Then he called out to know whether the treaty was signed. He was
told that it was, and in a short time the prisoners were brought
alongside and delivered to their rescuers. Wan, emaciated and
hollow-eyed from their long and bitter imprisonment, they wept
tears of joy and kissed the American flag that, coming so many
thousand miles, had brought them deliverance.</p>

<p>Thus in two weeks after the arrival of the American squadron
in Algerian waters, every demand of its Government was complied
with, and a treaty of peace made on terms dictated by its gallant
and faithful representative. It will be admitted that Stephen
Decatur proved himself one of the most successful diplomats as
well as intrepid and skilful of commanders.</p>

<p>He now proceeded to Tunis and notified the Dey that he would
give him twelve hours in which to pay $46,000 for allowing the
seizure of American prizes in his port during the late war. The
Dey paid it. The next call of the American commander was on the
Bashaw of Tripoli, who, although he blustered a good deal, was
compelled to hand over $25,000 for a similar breach of the law.</p>

<p>Among the vessels of the American squadron were three&mdash;the <em>Guerriere</em>,
<em>Macedonian</em>, and the <em>Peacock</em>&mdash;which had been
captured from Great Britain during the late war. This fact gave
peculiar point to the reproof of the Dey's prime minister to the
British consul: "You told us that the Americans should be swept
from the seas in six months by your navy, and now they make war
upon us with some of your own vessels which they took from you."</p>
