<p>As Mate Storms said, he had but little more communication to
make with the negro.</p>

<p>"You may now swim back to your friends and say that we will be
ready to negotiate to-morrow morning. If they will come down to
the shore, we will have a talk and arrange the whole business.
Now, perhaps, you had better go back."</p>

<p>Pomp Cooper was quick-witted enough to understand that this utterance
was in the nature of a hint for him to depart, and he stood not
on the order of his going.</p>

<p>"Good-by, sah," he called out. "Much obleege fo' your kindness,
dat I shall remember a good while."</p>

<p>Mate Storms stood motionless, watching him until he was perhaps
a hundred feet from the craft, when he said, just loud enough
to be heard:</p>

<p>"Sharks are mighty plenty hereabout, and I saw a big one yesterday.
Shouldn't wonder if he has a leg bit off before he gets back."</p>

<p>Pomp heard the words, and they "disturbed" him, to put it mildly.
Evidently he had forgotten the peril to which all persons are
exposed in tropical waters, and, as the truth was impressed upon
him with such suddenness, he uttered a "whiff" like a porpoise
and began swimming with fierce energy toward the shore. In fact,
he never put forth so much effort in all his life. The expectation
of feeling a huge man-eating monster gliding beneath you when
in the water is enough to shake the nerves of the strongest swimmer.
He kept diving and swimming as far as he could below the surface,
and then came up and continued his desperate efforts until he
reached the land, where he joined his companions.</p>

<p>Abe Storms stood looking and listening, his face expanded in
a broad smile, when he heard a light laugh at his elbow. Turning
his head, he found the captain there.</p>

<p>"I heard your summons to him," said the captain, by way of explanation,
"and I came up to hear what it meant. I must admit, you managed
the case well."</p>

<p>"It might have been worse. My only fear is that the imps won't
believe we honestly intend to hold the conference with them, and
offer a compromise."</p>

<p>"They will find it out at daylight, and meanwhile they can't
help themselves. It is useless for me to stay below, Abe," added
the nervous captain. "There's too much on my mind to sleep."</p>

<p>Therefore, the two remained on watch until the sun rose, at which
time there was nothing to be seen of the mutineers.</p>

<p>"They're suspicious," concluded the mate, who called out, in
a loud voice that reached every portion of the island:</p>

<p>"Hello, men! come and show yourselves. We want to have a talk
with you!"</p>

<p>A few minutes later Hyde Brazzier appeared on the shore and answered
back again. It was deemed best to give the mutineers a proof of
their sincerity, and instead, therefore, of holding the conversation
from the deck of the schooner, the small boat was lowered, and
both the captain and mate entered it and rowed ashore, where all
three awaited them, as may be supposed, with some degree of astonishment.</p>

<p>Storms and Captain Bergen were not without some misgivings, and
they did not venture unprepared into the lion's den. Both carried
a loaded revolver at command, and in case of an attack the business
would have been lively. But it was unreasonable to suppose that
our friends would be assailed under the peculiar circumstances.
Furthermore, as the parties understood each other, there was no
time wasted in reproaches or recriminations, but Captain Bergen
came directly to the point.</p>

<p>"This state of things can't last," said he; "we are deadly enemies,
and we would kill each other on the slightest pretext. The island
is too small to contain us all. Either you three or we two must
leave before the sun reaches meridian, or we shall go to fighting
like caged tigers. Neither can we go away together, for I would
not trust any of you again, nor would you trust either of us;
therefore, one party must go, and the other must stay&mdash;which shall
it be? We were prepared to leave, when we reflected that if we
should be caught in some of the storms which sweep over this region,
the mate and I would hardly be able to manage the schooner, and
we are anxious to take care of the little girl, to whom we are
greatly attached. There are three of you, all able-bodied seamen,
and in case of a tempest you would be able to navigate the <em>Coral</em>.
It would be safer, therefore, for you to take the vessel and go
to some of the ports, secure assistance and send them after us.
We make, therefore, this proposition: We will turn over the schooner
to you, on condition that you leave with us such stores as we
may choose to take, and that you proceed at once to the nearest
of the inhabited Paumotu Islands and send assistance to us. Furthermore,
as you know all about the pearl-oysters, we will agree to divide
with you. You can take up half of what are on the bed out yonder,
and you may carry them away with you, leaving a moiety to us.
You are to sail just as soon as the oysters are placed on board.
That's our proposition&mdash;what do you say?"</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that the mutineers were astonished by
the generosity of the offer, coming, as it did, from those who
were in reality masters of the situation.</p>

<p>Had they been a little more cunning, they might have suspected
there was something behind it all, which was kept carefully out
of sight; but the terms were so good that Brazzier answered, the
instant the question was put to him:</p>

<p>"We'll do it, and carry out our part fair and square."</p>

<p>"Very well; there's no need of delay. We'll bring the schooner
inshore and take out what we want, and then turn the craft over
to you."</p>

<p>This amazing programme was carried out to the letter. Captain
and mate, accompanied by Pomp, rowed back in the small boat, and
the schooner was carefully worked toward the shore.</p>

<p>Abe Storms and Captain Bergen saw that among the possibilities
of the future was a long stay on the lonely island, and they therefore
prepared for such a contingency, having an eye mainly to securing
that which little Inez would be likely to need. Pomp informed
the officers that there was a small cabin a short distance away,
which had no doubt been put up by the sailors of whom Grebbens
had told the captain. It was made of planking that had come ashore
from the wreck, and the fact that it had stood so long proved
that it must have been built with much skill as well as strength.</p>

<p>It was found just as represented by Pomp&mdash;there being two compartments,
each a dozen feet or so square, and one of these was so well put
together that it seemed to be waterproof. Our friends were greatly
surprised and pleased over the discovery, for Grebbens had never
said anything about the structure.</p>

<p>The goods from the <em>Coral</em> were carried to this building
and deposited in the rear room, which was so tight that one would
have almost suffocated had he remained in it during the tropical
weather which prevails among the Paumotu Islands most of the time.</p>

<p>The goods stowed there were of a varied assortment, including
the three breech-loading rifles, ammunition, tool-chest and contents,
a portion of the medicine-chest, some biscuits, cooking utensils,
and a trunk of calicoes, linens and materials such as are used
in the making of feminine costumes. It was a singular coincidence
that Abe Storms had provided a considerable quantity of this before
leaving San Francisco, knowing as he did the fondness of savages
for such finery, and having a suspicion that it might be turned
to good account in the way of barter in some of the South Sea
islands. Little did he suspect the use to which it would be put,
and thankful indeed was he that it was at his command, when it
was so likely to be needed for Inez Hawthorne.</p>

<p>There was a goodly amount of stock, which was transferred to
the cabin, the mutineers assisting with the rest, for all felt
there was no time to lose. There was mistrust at first, each party
seeming to be suspicious of the other, but it soon wore off, and
any one looking upon them could not have been made to believe
they were deadly enemies.</p>

<p>When the transfer was completed, it was evident that the current
was close upon its turn, and unless they should leave the island
soon, they would be compelled to wait perhaps twelve or twenty-four
hours longer.</p>

<p>Since the sea was very calm, Hyde Brazzier proposed that the
schooner should be taken outside and anchored directly over the
pearl-oyster bed, so that sail could be hoisted as soon as they
were ready. There was a slight risk in the action, but it was
done, and after some careful maneuvering the <em>Coral</em> was
secured in position.</p>

<p>It looked very magnanimous and somewhat stupid for Abe Storms
to volunteer to go down in his coat of armor and scoop the oysters
into a huge basket, for the very parties who had tried so hard
to drown him when similarly engaged the day before. Nothing, it
would seem, could be more absurd, and yet the reader is requested
to suspend judgment until he shall have read the following chapter.</p>

<p>All this was done, and in the course of the succeeding two hours
fully three-fourths of the oysters scattered over that particular
bed were dumped upon the deck of the <em>Coral</em>, and Abe Storms,
pretty well exhausted, was pulled to the surface. The captain
and mate, with the armor, rowed themselves the short distance
ashore in the small boat. The <em>Coral</em> hoisted sail, and,
heading out to sea, rapidly sped away over the Pacific.</p>

<p>And all this time the three mutineers felicitated themselves
upon the manner in which they had gotten the best of the bargain.
And yet, never in all their lives had they been so completely
outwitted as they were by Abe Storms and Captain Jack Bergen,
as we shall now proceed to show.</p>
