<p>Miss Spence gasped. So did the pupils.</p>

<p>The whole room filled with a swelling conglomerate "<em>O-O-O-O-H</em>!"</p>

<p>As for Penrod himself, the walls reeled with the shock. He sat
with his mouth open, a mere lump of stupefaction. For the appalling
words that he had hurled at the teacher were as inexplicable to
him as to any other who heard them.</p>

<p>Nothing is more treacherous than the human mind; nothing else
so loves to play the Iscariot. Even when patiently bullied into
a semblance of order and training, it may prove but a base and
shifty servant. And Penrod's mind was not his servant; it was
a master, with the April wind's whims; and it had just played
him a diabolical trick. The very jolt with which he came back
to the schoolroom in the midst of his fancied flight jarred his
day-dream utterly out of him; and he sat, open-mouthed in horror
at what he had said.</p>

<p>The unanimous gasp of awe was protracted. Miss Spence, however,
finally recovered her breath, and, returning deliberately to the
platform, faced the school. "And then for a little while," as
pathetic stories sometimes recount, "everything was very still."
It was so still, in fact, that Penrod's newborn notoriety could
almost be heard growing. This grisly silence was at last broken
by the teacher.</p>

<p>"Penrod Schofield, stand up!"</p>

<p>The miserable child obeyed.</p>

<p>"What did you mean by speaking to me in that way?"</p>

<p>He hung his head, raked the floor with the side of his shoe,
swayed, swallowed, looked suddenly at his hands with the air of
never having seen them before, then clasped them behind him. The
school shivered in ecstatic horror, every fascinated eye upon
him; yet there was not a soul in the room but was profoundly grateful
to him for the sensation&mdash;including the offended teacher herself.
Unhappily, all this gratitude was unconscious and altogether different
from the kind which, results in testimonials and loving-cups.
On the contrary!</p>

<p>"Penrod Schofield!"</p>

<p>He gulped.</p>

<p>"Answer me at once! Why did you speak to me like that?"</p>

<p>"I was&#11834;" He choked, unable to continue.</p>

<p>"Speak out!"</p>

<p>"I was just&mdash;thinking," he managed to stammer.</p>

<p>"That will not do," she returned sharply. "I wish to know immediately
why you spoke as you did."</p>

<p>The stricken Penrod answered helplessly:</p>

<p>"Because I was just thinking."</p>

<p>Upon the very rack he could have offered no ampler truthful explanation.
It was all he knew about it.</p>

<p>"Thinking what?"</p>

<p>"Just thinking."</p>

<p>Miss Spence's expression gave evidence that her power of self-restraint
was undergoing a remarkable test. However, after taking counsel
with herself, she commanded:</p>

<p>"Come here!"</p>

<p>He shuffled forward, and she placed a chair upon the platform
near her own.</p>

<p>"Sit there!"</p>

<p>Then (but not at all as if nothing had happened), she continued
the lesson in arithmetic. Spiritually the children may have learned
a lesson in very small fractions indeed as they gazed at the fragment
of sin before them on the stool of penitence. They all stared
at him attentively with hard and passionately interested eyes,
in which there was never one trace of pity. It cannot be said
with precision that he writhed; his movement was more a slow,
continuous squirm, effected with a ghastly assumption of languid
indifference; while his gaze, in the effort to escape the marble-hearted
glare of his schoolmates, affixed itself with apparent permanence
to the waistcoat button of James Russell Lowell just above the
"U" in "Russell."</p>

<p>Classes came and classes went, grilling him with eyes. Newcomers
received the story of the crime in darkling whispers; and the
outcast sat and sat and sat, and squirmed and squirmed and squirmed.
(He did one or two things with his spine which a professional
contortionist would have observed with real interest.) And all
this while of freezing suspense was but the criminal's detention
awaiting trial. A known punishment may be anticipated with some
measure of equanimity; at least, the prisoner may prepare himself
to undergo it; but the unknown looms more monstrous for every
attempt to guess it. Penrod's crime was unique; there were no
rules to aid him in estimating the vengeance to fall upon him
for it. What seemed most probable was that he would be expelled
from the schools in the presence of his family, the mayor, and
council, and afterward whipped by his father upon the State House
steps, with the entire city as audience by invitation of the authorities.</p>

<p>Noon came. The rows of children filed out, every head turning
for a last unpleasingly speculative look at the outlaw. Then Miss
Spence closed the door into the cloakroom and that into the big
hall, and came and sat at her desk, near Penrod. The tramping
of feet outside, the shrill calls and shouting and the changing
voices of the older boys ceased to be heard&mdash;and there was silence.
Penrod, still affecting to be occupied with Lowell, was conscious
that Miss Spence looked at him intently.</p>

<p>"Penrod," she said gravely, "what excuse have you to offer before
I report your case to the principal?"</p>

<p>The word "principal" struck him to the vitals. Grand Inquisitor,
Grand Khan, Sultan, Emperor, Tsar, Caesar Augustus&mdash;these are
comparable. He stopped squirming instantly, and sat rigid.</p>

<p>"I want an answer. Why did you shout those words at me?"</p>

<p>"Well," he murmured, "I was just&mdash;thinking."</p>

<p>"Thinking what?" she asked sharply.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"That won't do!"</p>

<p>He took his left ankle in his right hand and regarded it helplessly.</p>

<p>"That won't do, Penrod Schofield," she repeated severely. "If
that is all the excuse you have to offer I shall report your case
this instant!"</p>

<p>And she rose with fatal intent.</p>

<p>But Penrod was one of those whom the precipice inspires. "Well,
I <em>HAVE </em>got an excuse."</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;she paused impatiently&mdash;"what is it?"</p>

<p>He had not an idea, but he felt one coming, and replied automatically,
in a plaintive tone:</p>

<p>"I guess anybody that had been through what I had to go through,
last night, would think they had an excuse."</p>

<p>Miss Spence resumed her seat, though with the air of being ready
to leap from it instantly.</p>

<p>"What has last night to do with your insolence to me this morning?"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you'd see," he returned, emphasizing the plaintive
note, "if you knew what I know."</p>

<p>"Now, Penrod," she said, in a kinder voice, "I have a high regard
for your mother and father, and it would hurt me to distress them,
but you must either tell me what was the matter with you or I'll
have to take you to Mrs. Houston."</p>

<p>"Well, ain't I going to?" he cried, spurred by the dread name.
"It's because I didn't sleep last night."</p>

<p>"Were you ill?" The question was put with some dryness.</p>

<p>He felt the dryness. "No'm; <em>I</em> wasn't."</p>

<p>"Then if someone in your family was so ill that even you were
kept up all night, how does it happen they let you come to school
this morning?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't illness," he returned, shaking his head mournfully.
"It was lots worse'n anybody's being sick. It was&mdash;it was&mdash;well,
it was jest awful."</p>

<p>"<em>WHAT </em>was?" He remarked with anxiety the incredulity
in her tone.</p>

<p>"It was about Aunt Clara," he said.</p>

<p>"Your Aunt Clara!" she repeated. "Do you mean your mother's sister
who married Mr. Farry of Dayton, Illinois?"</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;Uncle John," returned Penrod sorrowfully. "The trouble
was about him."</p>

<p>Miss Spence frowned a frown which he rightly interpreted as one
of continued suspicion. "She and I were in school together," she
said. "I used to know her very well, and I've always heard her
married life was entirely happy. I don't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was," he interrupted, "until last year when Uncle John
took to running with travelling men&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm." He nodded solemnly. "That was what started it. At first
he was a good, kind husband, but these travelling men would coax
him into a saloon on his way home from work, and they got him
to drinking beer and then ales, wines, liquors, and cigars&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Penrod!"</p>

<p>"Ma'am?"</p>

<p>"I'm not inquiring into your Aunt Clara's private affairs; I'm
asking you if you have anything to say which would palliate&#11834;"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm tryin' to <em>TELL </em>you about, Miss Spence,"
he pleaded,&mdash;"if you'd jest only let me. When Aunt Clara and her
little baby daughter got to our house last night&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You say Mrs. Farry is visiting your mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm&mdash;not just visiting&mdash;you see, she <em>HAD </em>to come.
Well of course, little baby Clara, she was so bruised up and mauled,
where he'd been hittin' her with his cane&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You mean that your uncle had done such a thing as <em>THAT!"
</em>exclaimed Miss Spence, suddenly disarmed by this scandal.</p>

<p>"Yes'm, and mamma and Margaret had to sit up all night nursin'
little Clara&mdash;and <em>AUNT </em>Clara was in such a state <em>SOMEBODY
</em>had to keep talkin' to <em>HER, </em>and there wasn't anybody
but me to do it, so I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But where was your father?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Where was your father while&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;papa?" Penrod paused, reflected; then brightened. "Why,
he was down at the train, waitin' to see if Uncle John would try
to follow 'em and make 'em come home so's he could persecute 'em
some more. I wanted to do that, but they said if he did come I
mightn't be strong enough to hold him and&#11834;" The brave lad paused
again, modestly. Miss Spence's expression was encouraging. Her
eyes were wide with astonishment, and there may have been in them,
also, the mingled beginnings of admiration and self-reproach.
Penrod, warming to his work, felt safer every moment.</p>

<p>"And so," he continued, "I had to sit up with Aunt Clara. She
had some pretty big bruises, too, and I had to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But why didn't they send for a doctor?" However, this question
was only a flicker of dying incredulity.</p>

<p>"Oh, they didn't want any <em>DOCTOR," </em>exclaimed the inspired
realist promptly. "They don't want anybody to <em>HEAR </em>about
it because Uncle John might reform&mdash;and then where'd he be if
everybody knew he'd been a drunkard and whipped his wife and baby
daughter?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Miss Spence.</p>

<p>"You see, he used to be upright as anybody," he went on explanatively.
"It all begun&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Began, Penrod."</p>

<p>"Yes'm. It all commenced from the first day he let those travelling
men coax him into the saloon." Penrod narrated the downfall of
his Uncle John at length. In detail he was nothing short of plethoric;
and incident followed incident, sketched with such vividness,
such abundance of colour, and such verisimilitude to a drunkard's
life as a drunkard's life should be, that had Miss Spence possessed
the rather chilling attributes of William J. Burns himself, the
last trace of skepticism must have vanished from her mind. Besides,
there are two things that will be believed of any man whatsoever,
and one of them is that he has taken to drink. And in every sense
it was a moving picture which, with simple but eloquent words,
the virtuous Penrod set before his teacher.</p>

<p>His eloquence increased with what it fed on; and as with the
eloquence so with self-reproach in the gentle bosom of the teacher.
She cleared her throat with difficulty once or twice, during his
description of his ministering night with Aunt Clara. "And I said
to her, 'Why, Aunt Clara, what's the use of takin' on so about
it?' And I said, 'Now, Aunt Clara, all the crying in the world
can't make things any better.' And then she'd just keep catchin'
hold of me, and sob and kind of holler, and I'd say, '<em>DON'T
</em>cry, Aunt Clara &mdash;<em>PLEASE </em>don't cry."'</p>

<p>Then, under the influence of some fragmentary survivals of the
respectable portion of his Sunday adventures, his theme became
more exalted; and, only partially misquoting a phrase from a psalm,
he related how he had made it of comfort to Aunt Clara, and how
he had besought her to seek Higher guidance in her trouble.</p>

<p>The surprising thing about a structure such as Penrod was erecting
is that the taller it becomes the more ornamentation it will stand.
Gifted boys have this faculty of building magnificence upon cobwebs&mdash;and
Penrod was gifted. Under the spell of his really great performance,
Miss Spence gazed more and more sweetly upon the prodigy of spiritual
beauty and goodness before her, until at last, when Penrod came
to the explanation of his "just thinking," she was forced to turn
her head away.</p>

<p>"You mean, dear," she said gently, "that you were all worn out
and hardly knew what you were saying?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"And you were thinking about all those dreadful things so hard
that you forgot where you were?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking," he said simply, "how to save Uncle John."</p>

<p>And the end of it for this mighty boy was that the teacher kissed
him!</p>
