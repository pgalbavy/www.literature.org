<p>Terence Clark gathered himself for another rush and blow at the
Shawanoe, when the latter with a quickness which the eye of Fred
Linden could hardly follow, ducked under the arm of the Irish
lad and again struck him a resounding blow with the flat of the
hand, first on one side of the face and then on the other. Terry
wheeled and returned the blows with skill. Once his hand grazed
the black hair that was dangling about Deerfoot's head, and several
times he touched the nodding feathers, but strive as much as he
might, he could not reach the fellow himself.</p>

<p>Now that the combat may be said to have opened, it went through
to the end without halt or break. Here, there, everywhere dodged
and struck the Shawanoe, while Terry was always just too late
to catch him. Deerfoot might have inflicted considerable injury
upon his plucky antagonist, had he struck him with his closed
hand, but he always used his open palm. Some of the blows resounded
like pistol shots. Having delivered all that he wished, Deerfoot
doubled up his left hand so that only the index finger was extended.
With this he punched the right and left ribs of Terry, then his
chest, and then actually flipped each side of his nose, easily
dodging the blows which the half angered Irish lad aimed at him
in return.</p>

<p>Suddenly Terry turned his back on his foe and deliberately struck
several times at vacancy. Then he dropped his hands and walked
back by the fire, saying, with a shake of his head:</p>

<p>"I've enough! ye could bate the divil and his uncle."</p>

<p>Fred Linden was sitting on the ground shaking with laughter.
He had not seen any thing for a long time that pleased him so
much. He had observed Terry in more than one fight with the boys
at home and he knew he was an ugly customer, as full of grit as
a bull dog, but the Shawanoe struck him fully a dozen times, while
the Irish lad with all his skill desperately put forth never once
touched him. The discomfiture of the brave Irish lad was complete.</p>

<p>No witness of the bout, however, could have failed to admire
the skill and pluck of Terry. He acquitted himself well and kept
up the struggle, even after he was convinced that he could do
nothing with his alert antagonist. Then, when Deerfoot began to
trifle with him, he turned around as I have shown and struck the
empty air.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?" asked Fred, as the three stood by the
fire discussing the incident.</p>

<p>Terry passed his open hand over his cheeks, which were red and
smarting from the sharp taps of Deerfoot, and closing one eye
and scratching his head, made answer:</p>

<p>"I had been sthrikin' at Deerfut until I obsarved that ivery
time I sthruck <em>at</em> him I didn't hit him; so thinks I to
mesilf, I will see whither I can hit him by tryin' not to hit
him; so I sthruck where I knowed he wasn't, thinkin' he was there."</p>

<p>"Well, I must declare Deerfoot the winner."</p>

<p>"I can't deny that he is; I throw up the sponge and extind to
him the best wishes for himself and family."</p>

<p>Smiling in a way that left no doubt of his relish of the incident,
Deerfoot warmly shook the hand of his friend, whose brave fight
had increased his admiration of him.</p>

<p>"My brother is brave," said he admiringly; "perhaps he can lay
Deerfoot on his back; Deerfoot will rejoice if he can do so."</p>

<p>"Be the powers! but that suits me," exclaimed the delighted Terry;
"I forgot we were to have a wrestling match; Fred, ye will be
koind enough to sarve as riferee again; we'll take side holts
and it'll be the bist two out of thraa."</p>

<p>Terry was warranted in feeling more confidence in this test of
skill. He had failed&mdash;as he knew he would always fail&mdash;in a sparring
contest, for the reason that Deerfoot was so quick that he could
not touch him; but one of the necessities of a wrestling match
is that the contestants shall first seize each other. Terry believed
that he had as much physical strength as Deerfoot, and if he once
got a fair hold, he would not let go until he downed him.</p>

<p>Terry being right and Deerfoot left handed, each was able to
secure his most effective grip. So, standing side by side, in
the old fashioned style, with a dusky left arm around the white
neck and a white arm around the dusky neck, they began the struggle.</p>

<p>In this match, as before, Deerfoot allowed his antagonist to
dally with him awhile before he took the aggressive. Passing him
over his hip Terry gave Deerfoot such a violent fling that a pang
of fear shot through him, lest he had broken the Shawanoe's neck;
but though he shot headlong out of the grasp of the Irish lad,
the Shawanoe landed lightly on his feet and instantly leaped back
and closed with Terry again.</p>

<p>"I'll fetch ye this time," he muttered between his compressed
lips; "ye shan't git out of me hands till ye's down flat on yer
back and mesilf layin' a-straddle of ye. There's a difference
between boxin' and sparrin' and I shall taich ye the same, as
me grandmither&mdash;"</p>

<p>Both went down that instant, but the Shawanoe was on top. His
antagonist could not have fallen flatter had he been dropped from
the roof of a house.</p>

<p>"Mark the first fall for Deerfut," called out Terry, hastily
clambering to his feet, the Shawanoe extending his hand to help.</p>

<p>This result weakened the confidence of the Irish lad in himself,
that is, so far as concerned his opponent. He reflected that many
of the Indians are skillful wrestlers, and while Deerfoot had
had no training in boxing, he had in the other art. Such a cool
headed athlete would be sure to learn fast. Terry recognized the
peculiar flirt by which he had been turned off his feet as the
very trick he had played successfully on his playmates at home,
but which he never dreamed was known to Deerfoot.</p>

<p>The Irish lad tried every possible lock, twist and turn upon
his rival, but he could not get him off his feet. It seemed to
Terry that he whirled in the air when almost on the ground, and
that if he had been dropped head downwards from the height of
a rod, he would alight on his feet.</p>

<p>Fred saw Deerfoot, who was carefully watching his antagonist,
smile, and he knew what was coming. So deftly that, for the life
of him, the spectator could not see how it was done, Terry went
over again as "flat as a flounder." Not only that, but to the
astonishment of the victim as well as of the witness, the Shawanoe
remained erect, so that he literally flung his antagonist to the
ground and looked smilingly down upon him.</p>

<p>"Ye can baat the baaters," exclaimed Terry, rising to his feet,
and shaking hands with his victor. "I niver met any one who could
down me in that sthyle. I don't know how ye did the same, but
I haven't any doubts that ye done it, as me great uncle remarked
whin the cannon ball took off his head."</p>

<p>With the same shadowy smile Deerfoot looked inquiringly at Fred
Linden.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot thinks maybe his brother would be glad to lay him on
the ground?"</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I don't try it," laughed Fred, springing to
his feet, and instantly but cautiously closing arms with the graceful
warrior.</p>

<p>"My brother can not throw Deerfoot," said the latter; "but the
heart of Deerfoot would be glad if he would tell him how he would
like to fall&mdash;on his shoulders, or side, or back."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't like to fall at all; but if you think you can get
me on my shoulders, just try it; that's all."</p>

<p>"It shall be as my brother wishes."</p>

<p>The words seemed yet in the mouth of Deerfoot when Fred felt
himself sailing through space, and the next instant he landed
on his shoulders with a shock that Terry declared made the ground
shake.</p>

<p>As before, Deerfoot himself did not fall, but looked smilingly
down on his prostrate friend as he began climbing to his feet
again.</p>

<p>"Now, if my brother wishes to fall on his back, it shall be so."</p>

<p>"I've little doubt that you will not do just as you say you will;
I only ask that you wait till I say I am ready; you did the last
before I had time to prepare."</p>

<p>"Ye bitter not ax him to wait," said Terry, who rolled over on
the ground in the exuberance of his mirth, at the sight of his
big friend going down before the lithe, willowy Shawanoe; "for
since he's bound to do what he says, the sooner ye are out of
yer suspinse, the sooner ye'll be out of it."</p>

<p>"Be kind enough to attend to your own affairs," said Fred stiffly;
"Deerfoot and I are running this show."</p>

<p>"It looks as if Deerfut had charge of the whole of it," was the
comment of Terry, who broke into laughter again; "and whin he
is done ye'll agraa with me."</p>

<p>Once more the arms passed over each other's neck. Fred resolved
that whatever came, he would not be taken by surprise this time.
He was stronger than Terry and he had thrown him more than once.
He could not understand, therefore, why he should not at least
give the Shawanoe a struggle. He braced his feet, with every muscle
strained, and every faculty on the alert.</p>

<p>"I am ready," said he; "do your best."</p>

<p>"On which side shall Deerfoot throw his brother?"</p>

<p>"On my right side, and as hard as you can."</p>

<p>Now, you will see the difficulty of the task, for Fred had his
right arm tightly locked over the neck of Deerfoot, so that that
side was guarded by the body of the warrior himself. It would
seem, that if Fred should fall on either side it could only be
on the left. Manifestly if it should be the right, the Shawanoe
could not go down with him. He must bring him to the ground and
escape from beneath him before he fell.</p>

<p>He did it. For a second or two the contestants stood motionless.
Then, like a flash, Deerfoot slipped from the grasp of his friend,
dropped down in a stooping posture almost to the earth, holding
the right hand of Fred firmly with his left (this was to prevent
him using that hand to save himself), and then by a quick dart
to the left, he carried both feet of his opponent off the ground,
and Fred fell squarely on his right side, his conqueror straightening
up as he went down.</p>

<p>"I would be obleeged," said Terry, throwing back his head with
laughter, "if yees will be koind enough to till me who is runnin'
the show about this time."</p>

<p>Fred was chagrined at the ease with which Deerfoot had overthrown
him, and it was not lessened by the honest compliment which the
young warrior gave to his skill. Both Fred and Terry had been
pretty well jarred, for they were downed with such amazing suddenness
that it could not be otherwise; but neither referred to it and
they could only praise the wonderful ability of their friend.</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Fred, seating himself on the ground beside
the other two, after the flurry was over, "all this proves that
skill is worth more than strength. I am quite sure that I am as
strong as you, Deerfoot, but I don't believe that Terry and I
together could lay you on your back. When I had my arm around
your neck, I suspected you would try to slip out, and I squeezed
you pretty hard. You slid out so quickly that at the moment you
were down at my heels, I thought I had you fast."</p>

<p>"I'm thinkin' that the nixt thing we should try is a race; Fred
can outrun me and I'll agraa that he will outrun Deerfut, that
is, if ye'll allow me to make the conditions."</p>

<p>"What would they be?" asked Deerfoot, Looking gravely down upon
his friends.</p>

<p>"The race should be for a hundred yards, and Deerfut must give
Fred ninety-five yards start, though to make it sure enough, maybe
it ought to be ninety-six or siven."</p>

<p>"Then you would require about ninety-nine, according to the same
calculation," said Fred.</p>

<p>"Ye's are right," replied Terry, to whom it seemed that no athletic
feat was impossible for the Shawanoe; "nayther yersilf nor mesilf
have a right to be mintioned in the same day with him."</p>
