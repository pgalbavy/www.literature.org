<P>
The Irvings came back to Echo Lodge for the summer, and Anne spent
a happy three weeks there in July.  Miss Lavendar had not changed;
Charlotta the Fourth was a very grown-up young lady now, but still
adored Anne sincerely.
<P>
"When all's said and done, Miss Shirley, ma'am, I haven't seen
any one in Boston that's equal to you," she said frankly.
<P>
Paul was almost grown up, too.  He was sixteen, his chestnut
curls had given place to close-cropped brown locks, and he was
more interested in football than fairies.  But the bond between
him and his old teacher still held.  Kindred spirits alone do not
change with changing years.
<P>
It was a wet, bleak, cruel evening in July when Anne came back to
Green Gables.  One of the fierce summer storms which sometimes
sweep over the gulf was ravaging the sea.  As Anne came in the
first raindrops dashed against the panes.
<P>
"Was that Paul who brought you home?" asked Marilla.  "Why didn't
you make him stay all night.  It's going to be a wild evening."
<P>
"He'll reach Echo Lodge before the rain gets very heavy, I think.
Anyway, he wanted to go back tonight.  Well, I've had a splendid
visit, but I'm glad to see you dear folks again.  `East, west,
hame's best.'  Davy, have you been growing again lately?"
<P>
"I've growed a whole inch since you left," said Davy proudly.
"I'm as tall as Milty Boulter now.  Ain't I glad.  He'll have to
stop crowing about being bigger.  Say, Anne, did you know that
Gilbert Blythe is dying?"  Anne stood quite silent and motionless,
looking at Davy.  Her face had gone so white that Marilla thought
she was going to faint.
<P>
"Davy, hold your tongue," said Mrs. Rachel angrily.  "Anne,
don't look like that -- DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT!  We didn't mean
to tell you so suddenly."
<P>
"Is -- it -- true?" asked Anne in a voice that was not hers.
<P>
"Gilbert is very ill," said Mrs. Lynde gravely.  "He took down
with typhoid fever just after you left for Echo Lodge.  Did you
never hear of it?"
<P>
"No," said that unknown voice.
<P>
"It was a very bad case from the start.  The doctor said he'd
been terribly run down.  They've a trained nurse and everything's
been done.  DON'T look like that, Anne.  While there's life
there's hope."
<P>
"Mr. Harrison was here this evening and he said they had no hope of him,"
reiterated Davy.
<P>
Marilla, looking old and worn and tired, got up and marched Davy grimly
out of the kitchen.
<P>
"Oh, DON'T look so, dear," said Mrs. Rachel, putting her kind old arms
about the pallid girl.  "I haven't given up hope, indeed I haven't.
He's got the Blythe constitution in his favor, that's what."
<P>
Anne gently put Mrs. Lynde's arms away from her, walked blindly
across the kitchen, through the hall, up the stairs to her old room.
At its window she knelt down, staring out unseeingly. It was very dark.
The rain was beating down over the shivering fields.  The Haunted Woods
was full of the groans of mighty trees wrung in the tempest, and the
air throbbed with the thunderous crash of billows on the distant shore.
And Gilbert was dying!
<P>
There is a book of Revelation in every one's life, as there is in the Bible.
Anne read hers that bitter night, as she kept her agonized vigil through
the hours of storm and darkness.  She loved Gilbert -- had always loved him!
She knew that now.  She knew that she could no more cast him out of her life
without agony than she could have cut off her right hand and cast it from her.
And the knowledge had come too late -- too late even for the bitter solace
of being with him at the last.  If she had not been so blind -- so foolish
-- she would have had the right to go to him now.  But he would never know
that she loved him -- he would go away from this life thinking that she
did not care.  Oh, the black years of emptiness stretching before her!
She could not live through them -- she could not!  She cowered down by
her window and wished, for the first time in her gay young life, that
she could die, too.  If Gilbert went away from her, without one word or
sign or message, she could not live.  Nothing was of any value without him.
She belonged to him and he to her.  In her hour of supreme agony she had
no doubt of that.  He did not love Christine Stuart -- never had loved
Christine Stuart.  Oh, what a fool she had been not to realize what the
bond was that had held her to Gilbert -- to think that the flattered
fancy she had felt for Roy Gardner had been love.  And now she must pay
for her folly as for a crime.
<P>
Mrs. Lynde and Marilla crept to her door before they went to bed,
shook their heads doubtfully at each other over the silence,
and went away.  The storm raged all night, but when the dawn came
it was spent.  Anne saw a fairy fringe of light on the skirts of
darkness.  Soon the eastern hilltops had a fire-shot ruby rim.
The clouds rolled themselves away into great, soft, white masses
on the horizon; the sky gleamed blue and silvery.  A hush fell
over the world.
<P>
Anne rose from her knees and crept downstairs.  The freshness of
the rain-wind blew against her white face as she went out into
the yard, and cooled her dry, burning eyes.  A merry rollicking
whistle was lilting up the lane.  A moment later Pacifique Buote
came in sight.
<P>
Anne's physical strength suddenly failed her.  If she had not
clutched at a low willow bough she would have fallen.  Pacifique
was George Fletcher's hired man, and George Fletcher lived
next door to the Blythes.  Mrs. Fletcher was Gilbert's aunt.
Pacifique would know if -- if -- Pacifique would know what there
was to be known.
<P>
Pacifique strode sturdily on along the red lane, whistling.  He
did not see Anne.  She made three futile attempts to call him.
He was almost past before she succeeded in making her quivering
lips call, "Pacifique!"
<P>
Pacifique turned with a grin and a cheerful good morning.
<P>
"Pacifique," said Anne faintly, "did you come from George
Fletcher's this morning?"
<P>
"Sure," said Pacifique amiably.  "I got de word las' night dat my
fader, he was seeck.  It was so stormy dat I couldn't go den, so I
start vair early dis mornin'.  I'm goin' troo de woods for short cut."
<P>
"Did you hear how Gilbert Blythe was this morning?" Anne's
desperation drove her to the question.  Even the worst would be
more endurable than this hideous suspense.
<P>
"He's better," said Pacifique.  "He got de turn las' night.
De doctor say he'll be all right now dis soon while.  Had close
shave, dough!  Dat boy, he jus' keel himself at college.
Well, I mus' hurry.  De old man, he'll be in hurry to see me."
<P>
Pacifique resumed his walk and his whistle.  Anne gazed after him
with eyes where joy was driving out the strained anguish of the night.
He was a very lank, very ragged, very homely youth.  But in her sight
he was as beautiful as those who bring good tidings on the mountains.
Never, as long as she lived, would Anne see Pacifique's brown, round,
black-eyed face without a warm remembrance of the moment when he had
given to her the oil of joy for mourning.
<P>
Long after Pacifique's gay whistle had faded into the phantom of
music and then into silence far up under the maples of Lover's
Lane Anne stood under the willows, tasting the poignant sweetness
of life when some great dread has been removed from it.  The
morning was a cup filled with mist and glamor.  In the corner
near her was a rich surprise of new-blown, crystal-dewed roses.
The trills and trickles of song from the birds in the big tree
above her seemed in perfect accord with her mood.  A sentence
from a very old, very true, very wonderful Book came to her lips,
<P>
"Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning."
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
XLI
<P>
Love Takes Up the Glass of Time
<P>
<P>
"I've come up to ask you to go for one of our old-time rambles
through September woods and `over hills where spices grow,' this
afternoon," said Gilbert, coming suddenly around the porch corner.
"Suppose we visit Hester Gray's garden."
<P>
Anne, sitting on the stone step with her lap full of a pale,
filmy, green stuff, looked up rather blankly.
<P>
"Oh, I wish I could," she said slowly, "but I really can't,
Gilbert.  I'm going to Alice Penhallow's wedding this evening,
you know.  I've got to do something to this dress, and by
the time it's finished I'll have to get ready.  I'm so sorry.
I'd love to go."
<P>
"Well, can you go tomorrow afternoon, then?" asked Gilbert,
apparently not much disappointed.
<P>
"Yes, I think so."
<P>
"In that case I shall hie me home at once to do something I
should otherwise have to do tomorrow.  So Alice Penhallow is
to be married tonight.  Three weddings for you in one summer,
Anne -- Phil's, Alice's, and Jane's.  I'll never forgive Jane
for not inviting me to her wedding."
<P>
"You really can't blame her when you think of the tremendous
Andrews connection who had to be invited.  The house could hardly
hold them all.  I was only bidden by grace of being Jane's old
chum -- at least on Jane's part.  I think Mrs. Harmon's motive
for inviting me was to let me see Jane's surpassing gorgeousness."
<P>
"Is it true that she wore so many diamonds that you couldn't tell
where the diamonds left off and Jane began?"
<P>
Anne laughed.
<P>
"She certainly wore a good many.  What with all the diamonds and
white satin and tulle and lace and roses and orange blossoms,
prim little Jane was almost lost to sight.  But she was VERY
happy, and so was Mr. Inglis -- and so was Mrs. Harmon."
<P>
"Is that the dress you're going to wear tonight?" asked Gilbert,
looking down at the fluffs and frills.
<P>
"Yes.  Isn't it pretty?  And I shall wear starflowers in my hair.
The Haunted Wood is full of them this summer."
<P>
Gilbert had a sudden vision of Anne, arrayed in a frilly green gown,
with the virginal curves of arms and throat slipping out of it,
and white stars shining against the coils of her ruddy hair.
The vision made him catch his breath.  But he turned lightly away.
<P>
"Well, I'll be up tomorrow.  Hope you'll have a nice time tonight."
<P>
Anne looked after him as he strode away, and sighed.  Gilbert was
friendly -- very friendly -- far too friendly.  He had come quite
often to Green Gables after his recovery, and something of their
old comradeship had returned.  But Anne no longer found it satisfying.
The rose of love made the blossom of friendship pale and scentless
by contrast.  And Anne had again begun to doubt if Gilbert now felt
anything for her but friendship.  In the common light of common
day her radiant certainty of that rapt morning had faded.  She was
haunted by a miserable fear that her mistake could never be rectified.
It was quite likely that it was Christine whom Gilbert loved after all.
Perhaps he was even engaged to her.  Anne tried to put all unsettling
hopes out of her heart, and reconcile herself to a future where work
and ambition must take the place of love.  She could do good, if not
noble, work as a teacher; and the success her little sketches were
beginning to meet with in certain editorial sanctums augured well
for her budding literary dreams.  But -- but -- Anne picked up her
green dress and sighed again.
<P>
When Gilbert came the next afternoon he found Anne waiting for him,
fresh as the dawn and fair as a star, after all the gaiety of the
preceding night.  She wore a green dress -- not the one she had
worn to the wedding, but an old one which Gilbert had told her
at a Redmond reception he liked especially.  It was just the shade
of green that brought out the rich tints of her hair, and the starry
gray of her eyes and the iris-like delicacy of her skin.  Gilbert,
glancing at her sideways as they walked along a shadowy woodpath,
thought she had never looked so lovely.  Anne, glancing sideways
at Gilbert, now and then, thought how much older he looked since
his illness.  It was as if he had put boyhood behind him forever.
<P>
The day was beautiful and the way was beautiful.  Anne was almost
sorry when they reached Hester Gray's garden, and sat down on the
old bench.  But it was beautiful there, too -- as beautiful as it
had been on the faraway day of the Golden Picnic, when Diana and
Jane and Priscilla and she had found it.  Then it had been lovely
with narcissus and violets; now golden rod had kindled its fairy
torches in the corners and asters dotted it bluely.  The call of
the brook came up through the woods from the valley of birches
with all its old allurement; the mellow air was full of the purr
of the sea; beyond were fields rimmed by fences bleached silvery
gray in the suns of many summers, and long hills scarfed with the
shadows of autumnal clouds; with the blowing of the west wind old
dreams returned.
<P>
"I think," said Anne softly, "that `the land where dreams come true'
is in the blue haze yonder, over that little valley."
<P>
"Have you any unfulfilled dreams, Anne?" asked Gilbert.
<P>
Something in his tone -- something she had not heard since that
miserable evening in the orchard at Patty's Place -- made Anne's
heart beat wildly.  But she made answer lightly.
<P>
"Of course.  Everybody has.  It wouldn't do for us to have all
our dreams fulfilled.  We would be as good as dead if we had
nothing left to dream about.  What a delicious aroma that
low-descending sun is extracting from the asters and ferns.
I wish we could see perfumes as well as smell them.  I'm sure
they would be very beautiful."
<P>
Gilbert was not to be thus sidetracked.
<P>
"I have a dream," he said slowly.  "I persist in dreaming it,
although it has often seemed to me that it could never come true.
I dream of a home with a hearth-fire in it, a cat and dog, the
footsteps of friends -- and YOU!"
<P>
Anne wanted to speak but she could find no words.  Happiness was
breaking over her like a wave.  It almost frightened her.
<P>
"I asked you a question over two years ago, Anne.  If I ask it
again today will you give me a different answer?"
<P>
Still Anne could not speak.  But she lifted her eyes, shining
with all the love-rapture of countless generations, and looked
into his for a moment.  He wanted no other answer.
<P>
They lingered in the old garden until twilight, sweet as dusk in
Eden must have been, crept over it.  There was so much to talk
over and recall -- things said and done and heard and thought and
felt and misunderstood.
<P>
"I thought you loved Christine Stuart," Anne told him, as
reproachfully as if she had not given him every reason to
suppose that she loved Roy Gardner.
<P>
Gilbert laughed boyishly.
<P>
"Christine was engaged to somebody in her home town.  I knew it
and she knew I knew it.  When her brother graduated he told me
his sister was coming to Kingsport the next winter to take music,
and asked me if I would look after her a bit, as she knew no one
and would be very lonely.  So I did.  And then I liked Christine
for her own sake.  She is one of the nicest girls I've ever
known.  I knew college gossip credited us with being in love with
each other.  I didn't care.  Nothing mattered much to me for a
time there, after you told me you could never love me, Anne.
There was nobody else -- there never could be anybody else for me
but you.  I've loved you ever since that day you broke your slate
over my head in school."
<P>
"I don't see how you could keep on loving me when I was such a
little fool," said Anne.
<P>
"Well, I tried to stop," said Gilbert frankly, "not because I
thought you what you call yourself, but because I felt sure there
was no chance for me after Gardner came on the scene.  But I
couldn't -- and I can't tell you, either, what it's meant to me
these two years to believe you were going to marry him, and be
told every week by some busybody that your engagement was on the
point of being announced.  I believed it until one blessed day
when I was sitting up after the fever.  I got a letter from Phil
Gordon -- Phil Blake, rather -- in which she told me there was
really nothing between you and Roy, and advised me to `try again.'
Well, the doctor was amazed at my rapid recovery after that."
<P>
Anne laughed -- then shivered.
<P>
"I can never forget the night I thought you were dying, Gilbert.
Oh, I knew -- I KNEW then -- and I thought it was too late."
<P>
"But it wasn't, sweetheart.  Oh, Anne, this makes up for
everything, doesn't it?  Let's resolve to keep this day sacred to
perfect beauty all our lives for the gift it has given us."
<P>
"It's the birthday of our happiness," said Anne softly.
"I've always loved this old garden of Hester Gray's,
and now it will be dearer than ever."
<P>
"But I'll have to ask you to wait a long time, Anne,"
said Gilbert sadly.  "It will be three years before
I'll finish my medical course.  And even then there
will be no diamond sunbursts and marble halls."
<P>
Anne laughed.
<P>
"I don't want sunbursts and marble halls.  I just want YOU.
You see I'm quite as shameless as Phil about it.  Sunbursts and
marble halls may be all very well, but there is more `scope for
imagination' without them.  And as for the waiting, that doesn't
matter.  We'll just be happy, waiting and working for each other
-- and dreaming.  Oh, dreams will be very sweet now."
<P>
Gilbert drew her close to him and kissed her.  Then they walked
home together in the dusk, crowned king and queen in the bridal
realm of love, along winding paths fringed with the sweetest
flowers that ever bloomed, and over haunted meadows where winds
of hope and memory blew.
