<p>The tragedy enacted that night and morning was so harsh, so virulent and
so swift that it left the inmates of the Old Mill as though stunned.
Instead of uniting them in a common emotion, it scattered them, giving
each of them an impression of discomfort and uneasiness.
</p><p>In Philippe, this took the form of a state of torpor that kept him
asleep until the next morning. He awoke, however, in excellent
condition, but with an immense longing for solitude. In reality, he
shrank from finding himself in the presence of his father and his wife.
</p><p>He went out, therefore, very early, across the woods and fields, stopped
at an inn, climbed the Ballon de Vergix and did not come home until
lunch-time. He was very calm by then and quite master of himself.
</p><p>To men like Philippe, men endowed with upright natures and generous
minds, but not prone to waste time in reflecting upon the minor cases of
conscience that arise in daily life, the sense of duty performed
becomes, at critical periods, a sort of standard by which they judge
their actions. This sense Philippe experienced in all its fulness.
Placed by a series of abnormal circumstances between the necessity of
betraying Suzanne or the necessity of swearing upon oath to a thing
which he did not know, he felt that he was certainly entitled to lie.
The lie seemed just and natural. He did not deny the fault which he had
committed in succumbing to the young girl's fascinations and wiles: but,
having committed the fault, he owed it to Suzanne to keep it secret,
whatever the consequences of his discretion might be. There was no
excuse that permitted him to break silence.
</p><p>He found, on the drawing-room table, the three newspapers which were
taken at the Old Mill: the <u>Éclaireur des Vosges</u>; a Paris
evening-paper; and the <u>Börsweilener Zeitung</u>, a morning-paper printed
in German, but French in tone and inspiration. A glance at these
completely reassured him. Amid the confusion of the first reports
devoted to the Jorancé case, his own part passed almost unnoticed. The
<u>Éclaireur des Vosges</u> summoned up his evidence in a couple of lines.
When all was said, he was and would be no more than a supernumerary.
</p><p>"A walking gentleman, at the outside," he murmured, with satisfaction.
</p><p>"Yes, at the outside. It's your father and M. Jorancé who play the star
parts."
</p><p>Marthe had entered and caught his last words, which he had spoken aloud,
and was answering him with a laugh.
</p><p>She put her arm around his neck with the fond gesture usual to her and
said:
</p><p>"Yes, Philippe, you need not worry yourself. Your evidence is of no
importance and cannot influence events in any way. You can be very sure
of that."
</p><p>Their faces were quite close together and Philippe read nothing but
gaiety and affection in Marthe's eyes.
</p><p>He understood that she had ascribed his behaviour of the previous day,
his first, false version, his reticence and his confusion to scruples of
conscience and vague apprehensions. Anxious about the consequences of
the business and dreading lest his testimony might complicate it, he had
tried to avoid the annoyance of giving evidence.
</p><p>"I believe you're right," he said, with a view to confirming her in her
mistake. "Besides, is the business so very serious?"
</p><p>They talked together for a few minutes and, gradually, while watching
her, he changed the subject to the Jorancés:
</p><p>"Has Suzanne been this morning?"
</p><p>Marthe appeared astonished:
</p><p>"Suzanne?" she said. "Don't you know?... Oh, of course, you were asleep
last evening. Suzanne spent the night here."
</p><p>He turned aside his head, to hide the flush that spread over his
features, and he said:
</p><p>"Oh, she slept here, did she?"
</p><p>"Yes. M. Morestal wishes her to stay with us until M. Jorancé's return."
</p><p>"But ... but where is she now?..."
</p><p>"She is at Börsweilen ... she has gone to ask for leave to see her
father."
</p><p>"Alone?"
</p><p>"No, Victor went with her."
</p><p>With an air of indifference, Philippe asked:
</p><p>"How is she? Depressed?"
</p><p>"Very much depressed.... I don't know why, but she imagines that it was
her fault that her father was kidnapped.... She says she urged him to go
for that walk!... Poor Suzanne, what interest could she have in
remaining alone?..."
</p><p>He plainly perceived, from his wife's voice and attitude, that, although
certain coincidences had surprised her, her mind had not been touched by
the shadow of a suspicion. On that side, everything was over. The danger
was averted.
</p><p>Happily released from his fears, Philippe had the further satisfaction
of learning that his father had spent a very good night and that he had
gone to the town-hall at Saint-Élophe. He questioned his mother. Mme.
Morestal, yielding like Philippe to that desire for assuagement and
security which comes over us after any great shock, reassured him on the
subject of the old man's health. Certainly, there was something the
matter with the heart: Dr. Borel insisted upon his leading the most
regular and monotonous life. But Dr. Borel always looked at the dark
side of things; and, all considered, Morestal had borne the fatigue
attendant on his capture and escape, hard though it was, very well
indeed.
</p><p>"Besides, you have only to look at him," she concluded. "Here he comes,
back from Saint-Élophe."
</p><p>They saw him alight from the carriage with the brisk and springy step of
a young man. He joined them in the drawing-room and at once cried:
</p><p>"Oh, what an uproar! I've telephoned to town.... They're talking of
nothing else.... And who do you think swooped down upon me at
Saint-Élophe? Quite half-a-dozen reporters! I sent them away with a flea
in their ears! A set of fellows who make mischief wherever they go and
who arrange everything as it suits them!... They're the scourge of our
time!... I shall give Catherine formal orders that no one is to be
admitted to the Old Mill.... Why, did you see how they report my
escape? I'm supposed to have strangled the sentry and to have made a
couple of Uhlans who pursued me bite the dust!..."
</p><p>He could not succeed in concealing his satisfaction and drew himself to
his full height, like a man who sees nothing astonishing in an exploit
of that kind.
</p><p>Philippe asked.
</p><p>"And what is the general feeling?"
</p><p>"Just what the papers say. Jorancé's release is imminent. I told you as
much. The more we assert ourselves, as we have every right to do, the
sooner the thing will be over. You must understand that friend Jorancé
is being examined at this moment and that he is giving exactly the same
replies that I did. So you see!... No, once more, Germany will give way.
It is only a question of a day or two. So don't upset yourself, my boy,
since you're so afraid of war ... and the responsibilities attaching to
it!..."
</p><p>This, when all was said and done, was the motive to which he, like
Marthe, ascribed the incoherent words which Philippe had uttered
previous to his appearance before the magistrates; and, without going
deeper into the matter, it gave him, on his side, a certain sense of
anger, mingled with a mild contempt. Philippe Morestal, old Morestal's
son, afraid of war! He was one more corrupted by the Paris poison!...
</p><p>Lunch was very lively. The old man never ceased talking. His
good-humour, his optimism, his steady belief in a favourable and
immediate solution overcame every resistance; and Philippe himself was
glad to share a conviction that delighted him.

<p>The afternoon was continued under equally propitious auspices. Morestal
and Philippe were sent for to the frontier, where, in the presence of
the public prosecutor, the sub-prefect, the sergeant of gendarmes and a
number of journalists whom they tried in vain to send away, the
examining-magistrate carefully completed the investigations which he had
begun the day before. Morestal had to repeat the story of the aggression
on the spot where it occurred, to point definitely to the road followed
before the attack and during the flight, to fix the place where Private
Baufeld had crossed the frontier-line and the place where the commissary
and himself were arrested.
</p><p>He did so without hesitation, walking to and fro, talking and making his
statements so positively, so logically and so sincerely that the scene,
as pictured by him, lived again before the spectators' eyes. His
demonstration was lucid and commanding. Here, the first shot was fired.
There, a sharp divergence to the right, on German territory. Here, back
in France and, further on, at that exact spot, fifteen yards on this
side of the frontier, the scene of the fight, the place of the arrest.
Indications, undeniable indications, abounded. It was the truth, with no
possible fear of a mistake.
</p><p>Philippe was carried away and categorically confirmed his original
declaration. He had heard the special commissary shouting, as he
approached the Butte-aux-Loups. The words, "We are in France!... There
is the frontier!" had reached him distinctly. And he described his
search, his conversation with Private Baufeld and the wounded man's
evidence concerning the encroachment on French territory.
</p><p>The enquiry ended with a piece of good news. On Monday, a few hours
before the attack, Farmer Saboureux was said to have seen Weisslicht,
the chief of the German detectives, and a certain Dourlowski, a hawker,
walking in the woods and trying to keep hidden. Now Morestal, without
confessing the relations that existed between him and that individual,
had nevertheless spoken of the visit of this Dourlowski and of his
proposal that the witness should act as an accomplice. An understanding
between Dourlowski and Weisslicht was a proof that an ambush had been
laid and that the passing of Private Baufeld across the frontier,
arranged for half-past ten, was only a pretext to catch the special
commissary and his friend in a trap.
</p><p>The magistrates made no secret of their satisfaction. The Jorancé case,
a plot hatched by subordinate officials of police, whom the imperial
government would not hesitate to disown was becoming rapidly reduced to
the proportions of an incident which would lead to nothing and be
forgotten on the morrow.
</p><p>"That's all right," said Morestal, walking away with his son, while the
magistrates went on to Saboureux's Farm. "It will be an even simpler
matter than I hoped. The French government will know the results of the
enquiry this evening. There will be an exchange of views with the German
embassy; and to-morrow ..."
</p><p>"Do you think so?..."
</p><p>"I go further. I believe that Germany will make the first advance."
</p><p>As they came to the Col du Diable, they passed a small company of men
headed by one in a gold-laced cap.
</p><p>Morestal took off his hat with a flourish and grinned:
</p><p>"Good-afternoon!... I hope I see you well!"
</p><p>The man passed without speaking.
</p><p>"Who is that?" asked Philippe.
</p><p>"Weisslicht, the chief of the detectives."
</p><p>"And the others?"
</p><p>"The others?... It's the Germans making their investigation."
</p><p>It was then four o'clock in the afternoon.
</p><pre>

                                  * *</pre>
<p>The remainder of that day passed peacefully at the Old Mill. Suzanne
arrived from Börsweilen at nightfall, looking radiant. They had given
her a letter from her father and she would be authorized to see him on
Saturday.
</p><p>"You will not even have to go back to Börsweilen," said Morestal. "Your
father will come to fetch you here, won't he, Philippe?"
</p><p>Dinner brought them all five together under the family lamp; and they
experienced a feeling of relaxation, comfort and repose. They drank to
the special commissary's health. And it seemed to them as if his place
were not even empty, so great was the certainty with which they expected
his return.
</p><p>Philippe was the only one who did not share in the general gaiety.
Sitting beside Marthe and opposite Suzanne, he was bound, with his
upright nature and his sane judgment, to suffer at finding himself
situated in such a false position. Since the night before last, since
the moment when he had left Suzanne while the dawning light of day stole
into her room at Saint-Élophe, this was the first instant that he had
had any sort of time to conjure up the memory of those unnerving hours.
Alarmed by the course of events, obsessed by his anxiety about the way
in which he was to act, his one and only thought of Suzanne had been how
not to compromise her.
</p><p>Now, he saw her before him. He heard her laugh and talk. She lived in
his presence, not as he had known her in Paris and found her at
Saint-Élophe, but adorned with a different charm, of which he knew the
mysterious secret. True, he remained master of himself and he clearly
felt that no temptation would induce him to succumb a second time. But
could he help it that she had fair hair, the colour of which bewitched
him, and quivering lips and a voice melodious as a song? And could he
help it that all this filled him with an emotion which every minute that
passed made more profound?
</p><p>Their eyes met. Suzanne trembled under Philippe's gaze. A sort of
bashfulness decked her as with a veil that gives added beauty to its
wearer. She was as desirable as a wife and as winsome as a bride.
</p><p>At that moment, Marthe smiled to Philippe. He turned red and thought:
</p><p>"I shall go away to-morrow."
</p><p>His decision was taken then and there. He would not remain a day longer
between the two women. The mere sight of their intimacy was hateful to
him. He would go away without a word. He knew the danger of
leave-takings between people who love, knew how they soften us and
disarm us. He wanted none of those compromises and evasions. Temptation,
even if we resist it, is a fault in itself.
</p><p>When dinner was over, he stood up and went to his bedroom, where Marthe
joined him. He learnt from her that Suzanne's room was on the same
floor. Later, he heard the young girl come upstairs. But he knew that
nothing would make him fall again.
</p><p>As soon as he was alone, he opened his window, sat a long time staring
at the vague outlines of the trees, then undressed and went to bed.
</p><pre>
                                   *
                                  * *</pre>
<p>In the morning, Marthe brought him his letters. He at once recognized
the writing of a friend on one of the envelopes:
</p><p>"Good!" he said, jumping at the pretext. "A letter from Pierre Belum. I
hope it's not to tell me to come back!"
</p><p>He opened the letter and, after reading it, said:
</p><p>"It's as I feared! I shall have to go."
</p><p>"Not before this evening, my boy."
</p><p>It was old Morestal, who had entered the room with an open letter in his
hand.
</p><p>"What's the matter, father?"
</p><p>"We are specially summoned to appear before the Prefect of the Vosges in
the town-hall at Saint-Élophe."
</p><p>"I too?"
</p><p>"You too. They want to verify certain points in your deposition."
</p><p>"So they are beginning all over again?"
</p><p>"Yes, it's a fresh enquiry. It appears that things are becoming
complicated."
</p><p>"What are you saying?"
</p><p>"I am saying what this morning's papers say. According to the latest
telegrams, Germany has no intention of releasing Jorancé. Moreover,
there have been manifestations in Paris. Berlin also is stirring. The
yellow press are adopting an arrogant tone. In short ..."
</p><p>"What?"
</p><p>"Well, the matter is taking a very nasty turn."
</p><p>Philippe gave a start. He walked up to his father and, yielding to a
sudden fit of anger:
</p><p>"There! Which of us was right? You see, you see what's happening now!
If you had listened to me ..."
</p><p>"If I had listened to you?..." echoed Morestal, emphasizing each word
and at once preparing for a quarrel.
</p><p>But Philippe restrained himself. Marthe made a remark or two at random.
And then all three were silent.
</p><p>Besides, of what use was speech? The thunderstorm had passed over their
heads and was rumbling over France. Henceforward powerless, they must
undergo its consequences and hear its distant echoes without being able
to influence the formidable elements that had been let loose during that
Monday night.
