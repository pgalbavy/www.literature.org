It was Albert's uncle who thought of our trying a newspaper.  He said he
thought we should not find the bandit business a paying industry, as a
permanency, and that journalism might be.</p>

<p>We had sold Noel's poetry and that piece of information about Lord
Tottenham to the good editor, so we thought it would not be a bad idea
to have a newspaper of our own.  We saw plainly that editors must be
very rich and powerful, because of the grand office and the man in the
glass case, like a museum, and the soft carpets and big writing-table.
Besides our having seen a whole handful of money that the editor pulled
out quite carelessly from his trousers pocket when he gave me my five
bob.</p>

<p>Dora wanted to be editor and so did Oswald, but he gave way to her
because she is a girl, and afterwards he knew that it is true what it
says in the copy-books about Virtue being its own Reward. Because you've
no idea what a bother it is. Everybody wanted to put in everything just
as they liked, no matter how much room there was on the page.  It was
simply awful!  Dora put up with it as long as she could and then she
said if she wasn't let alone she wouldn't go on being editor; they could
be the paper's editors themselves, so there.</p>

<p>Then Oswald said, like a good brother: 'I will help you if you like,
Dora,' and she said, 'You're more trouble than all the rest of them!
Come and be editor and see how you like it.  I give it up to you.'  But
she didn't, and we did it together.  We let Albert-next-door be sub-
editor, because he had hurt his foot with a nail in his boot that
gathered.</p>

<p>When it was done Albert-next-door's uncle had it copied for us in
typewriting, and we sent copies to all our friends, and then of course
there was no one left that we could ask to buy it.  We did not think of
that until too late.  We called the paper the Lewisham Recorder;
Lewisham because we live there, and Recorder in memory of the good
editor.  I could write a better paper on my head, but an editor is not
allowed to write all the paper.  It is very hard, but he is not.  You
just have to fill up with what you can get from other writers.  If I
ever have time I will write a paper all by myself.  It won't be patchy.
We had no time to make it an illustrated paper, but I drew the ship
going down with all hands for the first copy.  But the typewriter can't
draw ships, so it was left out in the other copies.  The time the first
paper took to write out no one would believe!  This was the Newspaper:</p>

<p>Every paper is written for some reason.  Ours is because we want to sell
it and get money.  If what we have written brings happiness to any sad
heart we shall not have laboured in vain. But we want the money too.
Many papers are content with the sad heart and the happiness, but we are
not like that, and it is best not to be deceitful.  EDITORS.</p>

<p>There will be two serial stories; One by Dicky and one by all of us.  In
a serial story you only put in one chapter at a time. But we shall put
all our serial story at once, if Dora has time to copy it.  Dicky's will
come later on.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>CHAPTER I - by Dora<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The sun was setting behind a romantic-looking tower when two strangers
might have been observed descending the crest of the hill.  The eldest,
a man in the prime of life; the other a handsome youth who reminded
everybody of Quentin Durward.  They approached the Castle, in which the
fair Lady Alicia awaited her deliverers.  She leaned from the
castellated window and waved her lily hand as they approached.  They
returned her signal, and retired to seek rest and refreshment at a
neighbouring hostelry.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>     -  -  -  -  -  - <br />
CHAPTER II - by Alice<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The Princess was very uncomfortable in the tower, because her fairy
godmother had told her all sorts of horrid things would happen if she
didn't catch a mouse every day, and she had caught so many mice that now
there were hardly any left to catch.  So she sent her carrier pigeon to
ask the noble Strangers if they could send her a few mice - because she
would be of age in a few days and then it wouldn't matter.  So the fairy
godmother - - (I'm very sorry, but there's no room to make the chapters

<p>(I can't - I'd much rather not - I don't know how.)</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>    -  -  -  -  -  - <br />
CHAPTER IV - by Dicky<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>I must now retrace my steps and tell you something about our hero.  You
must know he had been to an awfully jolly school, where they had turkey
and goose every day for dinner, and never any mutton, and as many helps
of pudding as a fellow cared to send up his plate for - so of course they
had all grown up very strong, and before he left school he challenged
the Head to have it out man to man, and he gave it him, I tell you.
That was the education that made him able to fight Red Indians, and to
be the stranger who might have been observed in the first chapter.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>     -  -  -  -  -  - <br />
CHAPTER V - by Noel<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>I think it's time something happened in this story.  So then the dragon
he came out, blowing fire out of his nose, and he said - </p>

<p>'Come on, you valiant man and true, I'd like to have a set-to along of
you!'</p>

<p>(That's bad English. - ED.  I don't care; it's what the dragon said. Who
told you dragons didn't talk bad English? - Noel.)</p>

<p>So the hero, whose name was Noeloninuris, replied - </p>

<p>'My blade is sharp, my axe is keen,
    You're not nearly as big as a good many
              dragons I've seen.'</p>

<p>(Don't put in so much poetry, Noel.  It's not fair, because none of the
others can do it. - ED.)</p>

<p>And then they went at it, and he beat the dragon, just as he did the
Head in Dicky's part of the Story, and so he married the Princess, and
they lived - - (No they didn't - not till the last chapter. - ED.)</p>

CHAPTER VI - by H. O.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>I think it's a very nice Story - but what about the mice?  I don't want
to say any more.  Dora can have what's left of my chapter.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>     -  -  -  -  -  - <br />
CHAPTER VII - by the Editors<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>And so when the dragon was dead there were lots of mice, because he used
to kill them for his tea but now they rapidly multiplied and ravaged the
country, so the fair lady Alicia, sometimes called the Princess, had to
say she would not marry any one unless they could rid the country of
this plague of mice.  Then the Prince, whose real name didn't begin with
N, but was Osrawalddo, waved his magic sword, and the dragon stood
before them, bowing gracefully.  They made him promise to be good, and
then they forgave him; and when the wedding breakfast came, all the
bones were saved for him.  And so they were married and lived happy ever
after.</p>

<p>(What became of the other stranger? - NOEL. The dragon ate him because he
asked too many questions. - EDITORS.)</p>

<p>This is the end of the story.</p>

<p>It only takes four hours and a quarter now to get from London to
Manchester; but I should not think any one would if they could help it.</p>

<p>A DREADFUL WARNING.  A wicked boy told me a very instructive thing about
ginger. They had opened one of the large jars, and he happened to take
out quite a lot, and he made it all right by dropping marbles in, till
there was as much ginger as before. But he told me that on the Sunday,
when it was coming near the part where there is only juice generally, I
had no idea what his feelings were.  I don't see what he could have said
when they asked him.  I should be sorry to act like it.</p>

you in particular, but every one.</p>

finished, I will exchange it for your shut-up inkstand, or the knife
that has the useful thing in it for taking stones out of horses' feet,
but you can't have it without.</p>

might ask Dicky.  He knows one of them.  I think it is the way yours
stopped.</p>

crabs build their nests there you are not at all sensible.</p>

we cannot read it except where the Duke waves his sword and says some

SAM REDFERN, OR THE BUSH RANGER'S BURIAL<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>By Dicky<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>'Well, Annie, I have bad news for you,' said Mr Ridgway, as he entered
the comfortable dining-room of his cabin in the Bush. 'Sam Redfern the
Bushranger is about this part of the Bush just now.  I hope he will not
attack us with his gang.'</p>

<p>'I hope not,' responded Annie, a gentle maiden of some sixteen summers.</p>

<p>Just then came a knock at the door of the hut, and a gruff voice asked
them to open the door.</p>

<p>'It is Sam Redfern the Bushranger, father,' said the girl.</p>

<p>'The same,' responded the voice, and the next moment the hall door was
smashed in, and Sam Redfern sprang in, followed by his gang.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div> -  -  -  -  -  - <br />
CHAPTER II<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Annie's Father was at once overpowered, and Annie herself lay bound with
cords on the drawing-room sofa.  Sam Redfern set a guard round the
lonely hut, and all human aid was despaired of. But you never know.  Far
away in the Bush a different scene was being enacted.</p>

<p>'Must be Injuns,' said a tall man to himself as he pushed his way
through the brushwood.  It was Jim Carlton, the celebrated detective.
'I know them,' he added; 'they are Apaches.'  just then ten Indians in
full war-paint appeared. Carlton raised his rifle and fired, and
slinging their scalps on his arm he hastened towards the humble log hut
where resided his affianced bride, Annie Ridgway, sometimes known as the
Flower of the Bush.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div> -  -  -  -  -  - <br />
CHAPTER III<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The moon was low on the horizon, and Sam Redfern was seated at a
drinking bout with some of his boon companions.</p>

<p>They had rifled the cellars of the hut, and the rich wines flowed like
water in the golden goblets of Mr Ridgway.</p>

<p>But Annie had made friends with one of the gang, a noble, good-hearted
man who had joined Sam Redfern by mistake, and she had told him to go
and get the police as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>'Ha! ha!' cried Redfern, 'now I am enjoying myself!' He little knew that
his doom was near upon him.</p>

<p>Just then Annie gave a piercing scream, and Sam Redfern got up, seizing
his revolver.  'Who are you?' he cried, as a man entered.</p>

<p>'I am Jim Carlton, the celebrated detective,' said the new arrival.</p>

<p>Sam Redfern's revolver dropped from his nerveless fingers, but the next
moment he had sprung upon the detective with the well-known activity of
the mountain sheep, and Annie shrieked, for she had grown to love the
rough Bushranger.</p>

<p>These are useful to play at shop with, until you are ready.  Not at
dinner-parties, for they will not grow unless uncooked. Potatoes are
not grown with seed, but with chopped-up potatoes. Apple trees are grown
from twigs, which is less wasteful.</p>

<p>Oak trees come from acorns.  Every one knows this.  When Noel says he
could grow one from a peach stone wrapped up in oak leaves, he shows
that he knows nothing about gardening but marigolds, and when I passed
by his garden I thought they seemed just like weeds now the flowers have
been picked.</p>

<p>A boy once dared me to eat a bulb.</p>

<p>Dogs are very industrious and fond of gardening.  Pincher is always
planting bones, but they never grow up.  There couldn't be a bone tree.
I think this is what makes him bark so unhappily at night.  He has never
tried planting dog-biscuit, but he is fonder of bones, and perhaps he
wants to be quite sure about them first.</p>

<p>This would have been a jolly good story if they had let me finish it at
