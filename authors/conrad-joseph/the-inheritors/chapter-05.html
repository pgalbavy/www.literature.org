<p><em>FOUR</em></p>

<p>He might really be backing a foreign, philanthropic ruler and
State-founder, and a British Foreign Minister, against the rather
sinister Chancellor of the Exchequer that Mr. Gurnard undoubtedly
was. It might suit him; perhaps he had shares in something or
other that depended on the success of the Duc de Mersch's Greenland
Protectorate. I knew well enough, you must remember, that Fox
was a big man&mdash;one of those big men that remain permanently behind
the curtain, perhaps because they have a certain lack of comeliness
of one sort or another and don't look well on the stage itself.
And I understood now that if he had abandoned&mdash;as he had done&mdash;half
a dozen enterprises of his own for the sake of the <em>Hour</em>,
it must be because it was very well worth his while. It was not
merely a question of the editorship of a paper; there was something
very much bigger in the background. My Dimensionist young lady,
again, might have other shares that depended on the Chancellor
of the Exchequer's blocking the way. In that way she might very
well talk allegorically of herself as in alliance with Gurnard
against Fox and Churchill. I was at sea in that sort of thing&mdash;but
I understood vaguely that something of the sort was remotely possible.</p>

<p>I didn't feel called upon to back out of it on that account,
yet I very decidedly wished that the thing could have been otherwise.
For myself, I came into the matter with clean hands&mdash;and I was
going to keep my hands clean; otherwise, I was at Fox's disposal.</p>

<p>"I understand," I said, the speech marking my decision, "I shall
have dealings with a good many of the proprietors &mdash;I am
the scratcher, in fact, and you don't want me to make a fool of
myself."</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, gauging me with his blue, gimlet eyes, "it's
just as well to know."</p>

<p>"It's just as well to know," I echoed. It <em>was</em> just as
well to know.</p>
