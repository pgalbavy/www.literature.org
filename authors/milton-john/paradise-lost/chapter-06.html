 <BR>
All night the dreadless Angel unpursu'd <BR>
Through Heav'ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn, <BR>
Wak't by the circling Hours, with rosie hand <BR>
Unbarr'd the gates of Light.  There is a Cave <BR>
Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne, <BR>
Where light and darkness in perpetual round <BR>
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav'n <BR>
Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night; <BR>
Light issues forth, and at the other dore <BR>
Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre <BR>
To veile the Heav'n, though darkness there might well <BR>
Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn <BR>
Such as in highest Heav'n, arrayd in Gold <BR>
Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night, <BR>
Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain <BR>
Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright, <BR>
Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds <BR>
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: <BR>
Warr he perceav'd, warr in procinct, and found <BR>
Already known what he for news had thought <BR>
To have reported: gladly then he mixt <BR>
Among those friendly Powers who him receav'd <BR>
With joy and acclamations loud, that one <BR>
That of so many Myriads fall'n, yet one <BR>
Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill <BR>
They led him high applauded, and present <BR>
Before the seat supream; from whence a voice <BR>
From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard. <BR>
<BR>
  Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought <BR>
The better fight, who single hast maintaind <BR>
Against revolted multitudes the Cause <BR>
Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes; <BR>
And for the testimonie of Truth hast born <BR>
Universal reproach, far worse to beare <BR>
Then violence: for this was all thy care <BR>
To stand approv'd in sight of God, though Worlds <BR>
Judg'd thee perverse: the easier conquest now <BR>
Remains thee, aided by this host of friends, <BR>
Back on thy foes more glorious to return <BR>
Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue <BR>
By force, who reason for thir Law refuse, <BR>
Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King <BR>
MESSIAH, who by right of merit Reigns. <BR>
Goe MICHAEL of Celestial Armies Prince, <BR>
And thou in Military prowess next <BR>
GABRIEL, lead forth to Battel these my Sons <BR>
Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints <BR>
By Thousands and by Millions rang'd for fight; <BR>
Equal in number to that Godless crew <BR>
Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms <BR>
Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav'n <BR>
Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss, <BR>
Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf <BR>
Of TARTARUS, which ready opens wide <BR>
His fiery CHAOS to receave thir fall. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began <BR>
To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl <BR>
In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe <BR>
Of wrauth awak't: nor with less dread the loud <BR>
Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow: <BR>
At which command the Powers Militant, <BR>
That stood for Heav'n, in mighty Quadrate joyn'd <BR>
Of Union irresistible, mov'd on <BR>
In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound <BR>
Of instrumental Harmonie that breath'd <BR>
Heroic Ardor to advent'rous deeds <BR>
Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause <BR>
Of God and his MESSIAH.  On they move <BR>
Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill, <BR>
Nor streit'ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides <BR>
Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground <BR>
Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore <BR>
Thir nimble tread; as when the total kind <BR>
Of Birds in orderly array on wing <BR>
Came summond over EDEN to receive <BR>
Thir names of thee; so over many a tract <BR>
Of Heav'n they march'd, and many a Province wide <BR>
Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last <BR>
Farr in th' Horizon to the North appeer'd <BR>
From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht <BR>
In battailous aspect, and neerer view <BR>
Bristl'd with upright beams innumerable <BR>
Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng'd, and Shields <BR>
Various, with boastful Argument portraid, <BR>
The banded Powers of SATAN hasting on <BR>
With furious expedition; for they weend <BR>
That self same day by fight, or by surprize <BR>
To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne <BR>
To set the envier of his State, the proud <BR>
Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov'd fond and vain <BR>
In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd <BR>
At first, that Angel should with Angel warr, <BR>
And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet <BR>
So oft in Festivals of joy and love <BR>
Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire <BR>
Hymning th' Eternal Father: but the shout <BR>
Of Battel now began, and rushing sound <BR>
Of onset ended soon each milder thought. <BR>
High in the midst exalted as a God <BR>
Th' Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate <BR>
Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos'd <BR>
With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields; <BR>
Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now <BR>
'Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left, <BR>
A dreadful interval, and Front to Front <BR>
Presented stood in terrible array <BR>
Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van, <BR>
On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn'd, <BR>
SATAN with vast and haughtie strides advanc't, <BR>
Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold; <BR>
ABDIEL that sight endur'd not, where he stood <BR>
Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, <BR>
And thus his own undaunted heart explores. <BR>
<BR>
  O Heav'n! that such resemblance of the Highest <BR>
Should yet remain, where faith and realtie <BR>
Remain not; wherfore should not strength &amp; might <BR>
There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove <BR>
Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable? <BR>
His puissance, trusting in th' Almightie's aide, <BR>
I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri'd <BR>
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, <BR>
That he who in debate of Truth hath won, <BR>
Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike <BR>
Victor; though brutish that contest and foule, <BR>
When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so <BR>
Most reason is that Reason overcome. <BR>
<BR>
  So pondering, and from his armed Peers <BR>
Forth stepping opposite, half way he met <BR>
His daring foe, at this prevention more <BR>
Incens't, and thus securely him defi'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht <BR>
The highth of thy aspiring unoppos'd, <BR>
The Throne of God unguarded, and his side <BR>
Abandond at the terror of thy Power <BR>
Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain <BR>
Against th' Omnipotent to rise in Arms; <BR>
Who out of smallest things could without end <BR>
Have rais'd incessant Armies to defeat <BR>
Thy folly; or with solitarie hand <BR>
Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow <BR>
Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd <BR>
Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest <BR>
All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith <BR>
Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then <BR>
To thee not visible, when I alone <BR>
Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent <BR>
From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late <BR>
How few somtimes may know, when thousands err. <BR>
<BR>
    Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance <BR>
Thus answerd.  Ill for thee, but in wisht houre <BR>
Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst <BR>
From flight, seditious Angel, to receave <BR>
Thy merited reward, the first assay <BR>
Of this right hand provok't, since first that tongue <BR>
Inspir'd with contradiction durst oppose <BR>
A third part of the Gods, in Synod met <BR>
Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel <BR>
Vigour Divine within them, can allow <BR>
Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comst <BR>
Before thy fellows, ambitious to win <BR>
From me som Plume, that thy success may show <BR>
Destruction to the rest: this pause between <BR>
(Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know; <BR>
At first I thought that Libertie and Heav'n <BR>
To heav'nly Soules had bin all one; but now <BR>
I see that most through sloth had rather serve, <BR>
Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song; <BR>
Such hast thou arm'd, the Minstrelsie of Heav'n, <BR>
Servilitie with freedom to contend, <BR>
As both thir deeds compar'd this day shall prove. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom in brief thus ABDIEL stern repli'd. <BR>
Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find <BR>
Of erring, from the path of truth remote: <BR>
Unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name <BR>
Of SERVITUDE to serve whom God ordains, <BR>
Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same, <BR>
When he who rules is worthiest, and excells <BR>
Them whom he governs.  This is servitude, <BR>
To serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebelld <BR>
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, <BR>
Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall'd; <BR>
Yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid. <BR>
Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve <BR>
In Heav'n God ever blessed, and his Divine <BR>
Behests obey, worthiest to be obey'd, <BR>
Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while <BR>
From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight, <BR>
This greeting on thy impious Crest receive. <BR>
<BR>
  So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, <BR>
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell <BR>
On the proud Crest of SATAN, that no sight, <BR>
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield <BR>
Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge <BR>
He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee <BR>
His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth <BR>
Winds under ground or waters forcing way <BR>
Sidelong, had push't a Mountain from his seat <BR>
Half sunk with all his Pines.  Amazement seis'd <BR>
The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see <BR>
Thus foil'd thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout, <BR>
Presage of Victorie and fierce desire <BR>
Of Battel: whereat MICHAEL bid sound <BR>
Th' Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heav'n <BR>
It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung <BR>
HOSANNA to the Highest: nor stood at gaze <BR>
The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn'd <BR>
The horrid shock: now storming furie rose, <BR>
And clamour such as heard in Heav'n till now <BR>
Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray'd <BR>
Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles <BR>
Of brazen Chariots rag'd; dire was the noise <BR>
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss <BR>
Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew, <BR>
And flying vaulted either Host with fire. <BR>
Sounder fierie Cope together rush'd <BR>
Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault <BR>
And inextinguishable rage; all Heav'n <BR>
Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth <BR>
Had to her Center shook.  What wonder? when <BR>
Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought <BR>
On either side, the least of whom could weild <BR>
These Elements, and arm him with the force <BR>
Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power <BR>
Armie against Armie numberless to raise <BR>
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, <BR>
Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat; <BR>
Had not th' Eternal King Omnipotent <BR>
From his strong hold of Heav'n high over-rul'd <BR>
And limited thir might; though numberd such <BR>
As each divided Legion might have seemd <BR>
A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand <BR>
A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd <BR>
Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert <BR>
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway <BR>
Of Battel, open when, and when to close <BR>
The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight, <BR>
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed <BR>
That argu'd fear; each on himself reli'd, <BR>
As onely in his arm the moment lay <BR>
Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame <BR>
Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred <BR>
That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground <BR>
A standing fight, then soaring on main wing <BR>
Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then <BR>
Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale <BR>
The Battel hung; till SATAN, who that day <BR>
Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes <BR>
No equal, raunging through the dire attack <BR>
Of fighting Seraphim confus'd, at length <BR>
Saw where the Sword of MICHAEL smote, and fell'd <BR>
Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway <BR>
Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down <BR>
Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand <BR>
He hasted, and oppos'd the rockie Orb <BR>
Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield <BR>
A vast circumference: At his approach <BR>
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile <BR>
Surceas'd, and glad as hoping here to end <BR>
Intestine War in Heav'n, the arch foe subdu'd <BR>
Or Captive drag'd in Chains, with hostile frown <BR>
And visage all enflam'd first thus began. <BR>
<BR>
  Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, <BR>
Unnam'd in Heav'n, now plenteous, as thou seest <BR>
These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, <BR>
Though heaviest by just measure on thy self <BR>
And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb'd <BR>
Heav'ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought <BR>
Miserie, uncreated till the crime <BR>
Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill'd <BR>
Thy malice into thousands, once upright <BR>
And faithful, now prov'd false.  But think not here <BR>
To trouble Holy Rest; Heav'n casts thee out <BR>
From all her Confines.  Heav'n the seat of bliss <BR>
Brooks not the works of violence and Warr. <BR>
Hence then, and evil go with thee along <BR>
Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell, <BR>
Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles, <BR>
Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome, <BR>
Or som more sudden vengeance wing'd from God <BR>
Precipitate thee with augmented paine. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus <BR>
The Adversarie.  Nor think thou with wind <BR>
Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds <BR>
Thou canst not.  Hast thou turnd the least of these <BR>
To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise <BR>
Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee <BR>
That thou shouldst hope, imperious, &amp; with threats <BR>
To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end <BR>
The strife which thou call'st evil, but wee style <BR>
The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win, <BR>
Or turn this Heav'n it self into the Hell <BR>
Thou fablest, here however to dwell free, <BR>
If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force, <BR>
And join him nam'd ALMIGHTIE to thy aid, <BR>
I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh. <BR>
<BR>
  They ended parle, and both addrest for fight <BR>
Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue <BR>
Of Angels, can relate, or to what things <BR>
Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift <BR>
Human imagination to such highth <BR>
Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd, <BR>
Stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms <BR>
Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav'n. <BR>
Now wav'd thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire <BR>
Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields <BR>
Blaz'd opposite, while expectation stood <BR>
In horror; from each hand with speed retir'd <BR>
Where erst was thickest fight, th' Angelic throng, <BR>
And left large field, unsafe within the wind <BR>
Of such commotion, such as to set forth <BR>
Great things by small, If Natures concord broke, <BR>
Among the Constellations warr were sprung, <BR>
Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne <BR>
Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie, <BR>
Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound. <BR>
Together both with next to Almightie Arme, <BR>
Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim'd <BR>
That might determine, and not need repeate, <BR>
As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd <BR>
In might or swift prevention; but the sword <BR>
Of MICHAEL from the Armorie of God <BR>
Was giv'n him temperd so, that neither keen <BR>
Nor solid might resist that edge: it met <BR>
The sword of SATAN with steep force to smite <BR>
Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid, <BR>
But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar'd <BR>
All his right side; then SATAN first knew pain, <BR>
And writh'd him to and fro convolv'd; so sore <BR>
The griding sword with discontinuous wound <BR>
Pass'd through him, but th' Ethereal substance clos'd <BR>
Not long divisible, and from the gash <BR>
A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow'd <BR>
Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed, <BR>
And all his Armour staind ere while so bright. <BR>
Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run <BR>
By Angels many and strong, who interpos'd <BR>
Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields <BR>
Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir'd <BR>
From off the files of warr; there they him laid <BR>
Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame <BR>
To find himself not matchless, and his pride <BR>
Humbl'd by such rebuke, so farr beneath <BR>
His confidence to equal God in power. <BR>
Yet soon he heal'd; for Spirits that live throughout <BR>
Vital in every part, not as frail man <BR>
In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines, <BR>
Cannot but by annihilating die; <BR>
Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound <BR>
Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire: <BR>
All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare, <BR>
All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please, <BR>
They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size <BR>
Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare. <BR>
<BR>
  Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd <BR>
Memorial, where the might of GABRIEL fought, <BR>
And with fierce Ensignes pierc'd the deep array <BR>
Of MOLOC furious King, who him defi'd, <BR>
And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound <BR>
Threatn'd, nor from the Holie One of Heav'n <BR>
Refrein'd his tongue blasphemous; but anon <BR>
Down clov'n to the waste, with shatterd Armes <BR>
And uncouth paine fled bellowing.  On each wing <BR>
URIEL and RAPHAEL his vaunting foe, <BR>
Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd, <BR>
Vanquish'd ADRAMELEC, and ASMADAI, <BR>
Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods <BR>
Disdain'd, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight, <BR>
Mangl'd with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile. <BR>
Nor stood unmindful ABDIEL to annoy <BR>
The Atheist crew, but with redoubl'd blow <BR>
ARIEL and ARIOC, and the violence <BR>
Of RAMIEL scorcht and blasted overthrew. <BR>
I might relate of thousands, and thir names <BR>
Eternize here on Earth; but those elect <BR>
Angels contented with thir fame in Heav'n <BR>
Seek not the praise of men: the other sort <BR>
In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr, <BR>
Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome <BR>
Canceld from Heav'n and sacred memorie, <BR>
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. <BR>
For strength from Truth divided and from Just, <BR>
Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise <BR>
And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires <BR>
Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame: <BR>
Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome. <BR>
<BR>
  And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv'd, <BR>
With many an inrode gor'd; deformed rout <BR>
Enter'd, and foul disorder; all the ground <BR>
With shiverd armour strow'n, and on a heap <BR>
Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd <BR>
And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld <BR>
Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host <BR>
Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris'd, <BR>
Then first with fear surpris'd and sense of paine <BR>
Fled ignominious, to such evil brought <BR>
By sinne of disobedience, till that hour <BR>
Not liable to fear or flight or paine. <BR>
Far otherwise th' inviolable Saints <BR>
In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc't entire, <BR>
Invulnerable, impenitrably arm'd: <BR>
Such high advantages thir innocence <BR>
Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd, <BR>
Not to have disobei'd; in fight they stood <BR>
Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain'd <BR>
By wound, though from thir place by violence mov'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Now Night her course began, and over Heav'n <BR>
Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd, <BR>
And silence on the odious dinn of Warr: <BR>
Under her Cloudie covert both retir'd, <BR>
Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field <BR>
MICHAEL and his Angels prevalent <BR>
Encamping, plac'd in Guard thir Watches round, <BR>
Cherubic waving fires: on th' other part <BR>
SATAN with his rebellious disappeerd, <BR>
Far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest, <BR>
His Potentates to Councel call'd by night; <BR>
And in the midst thus undismai'd began. <BR>
<BR>
  O now in danger tri'd, now known in Armes <BR>
Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare, <BR>
Found worthy not of Libertie alone, <BR>
Too mean pretense, but what we more affect, <BR>
Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne, <BR>
Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight, <BR>
(And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?) <BR>
What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send <BR>
Against us from about his Throne, and judg'd <BR>
Sufficient to subdue us to his will, <BR>
But proves not so: then fallible, it seems, <BR>
Of future we may deem him, though till now <BR>
Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly arm'd, <BR>
Some disadvantage we endur'd and paine, <BR>
Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd, <BR>
Since now we find this our Empyreal forme <BR>
Incapable of mortal injurie <BR>
Imperishable, and though peirc'd with wound, <BR>
Soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd. <BR>
Of evil then so small as easie think <BR>
The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes, <BR>
Weapons more violent, when next we meet, <BR>
May serve to better us, and worse our foes, <BR>
Or equal what between us made the odds, <BR>
In Nature none: if other hidden cause <BR>
Left them Superiour, while we can preserve <BR>
Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound, <BR>
Due search and consultation will disclose. <BR>
<BR>
  He sat; and in th' assembly next upstood <BR>
NISROC, of Principalities the prime; <BR>
As one he stood escap't from cruel fight, <BR>
Sore toild, his riv'n Armes to havoc hewn, <BR>
And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake. <BR>
Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free <BR>
Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard <BR>
For Gods, and too unequal work we find <BR>
Against unequal armes to fight in paine, <BR>
Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil <BR>
Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes <BR>
Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain <BR>
Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands <BR>
Of Mightiest.  Sense of pleasure we may well <BR>
Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, <BR>
But live content, which is the calmest life: <BR>
But pain is perfet miserie, the worst <BR>
Of evils, and excessive, overturnes <BR>
All patience.  He who therefore can invent <BR>
With what more forcible we may offend <BR>
Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme <BR>
Our selves with like defence, to mee deserves <BR>
No less then for deliverance what we owe. <BR>
<BR>
  Whereto with look compos'd SATAN repli'd. <BR>
Not uninvented that, which thou aright <BR>
Beleivst so main to our success, I bring; <BR>
Which of us who beholds the bright surface <BR>
Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand, <BR>
This continent of spacious Heav'n, adornd <BR>
With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms &amp; Gold, <BR>
Whose Eye so superficially surveyes <BR>
These things, as not to mind from whence they grow <BR>
Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, <BR>
Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht <BR>
With Heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth <BR>
So beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light. <BR>
These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep <BR>
Shall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame, <BR>
Which into hallow Engins long and round <BR>
Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire <BR>
Dilated and infuriate shall send forth <BR>
From far with thundring noise among our foes <BR>
Such implements of mischief as shall dash <BR>
To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands <BR>
Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd <BR>
The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. <BR>
Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne, <BR>
Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive; <BR>
Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind <BR>
Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird. <BR>
He ended, and his words thir drooping chere <BR>
Enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd. <BR>
Th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee <BR>
To be th' inventer miss'd, so easie it seemd <BR>
Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought <BR>
Impossible: yet haply of thy Race <BR>
In future dayes, if Malice should abound, <BR>
Some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd <BR>
With dev'lish machination might devise <BR>
Like instrument to plague the Sons of men <BR>
For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent. <BR>
Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew, <BR>
None arguing stood, innumerable hands <BR>
Were ready, in a moment up they turnd <BR>
Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath <BR>
Th' originals of Nature in thir crude <BR>
Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame <BR>
They found, they mingl'd, and with suttle Art, <BR>
Concocted and adusted they reduc'd <BR>
To blackest grain, and into store conveyd: <BR>
Part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth <BR>
Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone, <BR>
Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls <BR>
Of missive ruin; part incentive reed <BR>
Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. <BR>
So all ere day spring, under conscious Night <BR>
Secret they finish'd, and in order set, <BR>
With silent circumspection unespi'd. <BR>
Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav'n appeerd <BR>
Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms <BR>
The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood <BR>
Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host, <BR>
Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills <BR>
Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure, <BR>
Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, <BR>
Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight, <BR>
In motion or in alt: him soon they met <BR>
Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow <BR>
But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail <BR>
ZEPHIEL, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, <BR>
Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, <BR>
Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit <BR>
This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud <BR>
He comes, and settl'd in his face I see <BR>
Sad resolution and secure: let each <BR>
His Adamantine coat gird well, and each <BR>
Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield, <BR>
Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, <BR>
If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr, <BR>
But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire. <BR>
So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon <BR>
In order, quit of all impediment; <BR>
Instant without disturb they took Allarm, <BR>
And onward move Embattelld; when behold <BR>
Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe <BR>
Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube <BR>
Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd <BR>
On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, <BR>
To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood <BR>
A while, but suddenly at head appeerd <BR>
SATAN: And thus was heard Commanding loud. <BR>
<BR>
  Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould; <BR>
That all may see who hate us, how we seek <BR>
Peace and composure, and with open brest <BR>
Stand readie to receive them, if they like <BR>
Our overture, and turn not back perverse; <BR>
But that I doubt, however witness Heaven, <BR>
Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge <BR>
Freely our part: yee who appointed stand <BR>
Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch <BR>
What we propound, and loud that all may hear. <BR>
<BR>
  So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce <BR>
Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front <BR>
Divided, and to either Flank retir'd. <BR>
Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, <BR>
A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid <BR>
On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd <BR>
Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr <BR>
With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd) <BR>
Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes <BR>
With hideous orifice gap't on us wide, <BR>
Portending hollow truce; at each behind <BR>
A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed <BR>
Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, <BR>
Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd, <BR>
Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds <BR>
Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd <BR>
With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame, <BR>
But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd, <BR>
From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar <BR>
Emboweld with outragious noise the Air, <BR>
And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule <BR>
Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail <BR>
Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host <BR>
Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote, <BR>
That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, <BR>
Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell <BR>
By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd; <BR>
The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might <BR>
Have easily as Spirits evaded swift <BR>
By quick contraction or remove; but now <BR>
Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout; <BR>
Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files. <BR>
What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse <BR>
Repeated, and indecent overthrow <BR>
Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd, <BR>
And to thir foes a laughter; for in view <BR>
Stood rankt of Seraphim another row <BR>
In posture to displode thir second tire <BR>
Of Thunder: back defeated to return <BR>
They worse abhorr'd.  SATAN beheld thir plight, <BR>
And to his Mates thus in derision call'd. <BR>
<BR>
  O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? <BR>
Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, <BR>
To entertain them fair with open Front <BR>
And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms <BR>
Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds, <BR>
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, <BR>
As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd <BR>
Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps <BR>
For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose <BR>
If our proposals once again were heard <BR>
We should compel them to a quick result. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus BELIAL in like gamesom mood. <BR>
Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, <BR>
Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home, <BR>
Such as we might perceive amus'd them all, <BR>
And stumbl'd many, who receives them right, <BR>
Had need from head to foot well understand; <BR>
Not understood, this gift they have besides, <BR>
They shew us when our foes walk not upright. <BR>
<BR>
  So they among themselves in pleasant veine <BR>
Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond <BR>
All doubt of Victorie, eternal might <BR>
To match with thir inventions they presum'd <BR>
So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, <BR>
And all his Host derided, while they stood <BR>
A while in trouble; but they stood not long, <BR>
Rage prompted them at length, &amp; found them arms <BR>
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. <BR>
Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power <BR>
Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd) <BR>
Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills <BR>
(For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n <BR>
Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) <BR>
Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, <BR>
From thir foundations loosning to and fro <BR>
They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, <BR>
Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops <BR>
Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, <BR>
Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host, <BR>
When coming towards them so dread they saw <BR>
The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd, <BR>
Till on those cursed Engins triple-row <BR>
They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence <BR>
Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, <BR>
Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads <BR>
Main Promontories flung, which in the Air <BR>
Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd, <BR>
Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and brus'd <BR>
Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain <BR>
Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, <BR>
Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind <BR>
Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, <BR>
Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. <BR>
The rest in imitation to like Armes <BR>
Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; <BR>
So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills <BR>
Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire, <BR>
That under ground they fought in dismal shade; <BR>
Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game <BR>
To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt <BR>
Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n <BR>
Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred, <BR>
Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits <BR>
Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure, <BR>
Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen <BR>
This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: <BR>
That his great purpose he might so fulfill, <BR>
To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd <BR>
Upon his enemies, and to declare <BR>
All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son <BR>
Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began. <BR>
<BR>
  Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd, <BR>
Son in whose face invisible is beheld <BR>
Visibly, what by Deitie I am, <BR>
And in whose hand what by Decree I doe, <BR>
Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, <BR>
Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n, <BR>
Since MICHAEL and his Powers went forth to tame <BR>
These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, <BR>
As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd; <BR>
For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst, <BR>
Equal in their Creation they were form'd, <BR>
Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought <BR>
Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom; <BR>
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last <BR>
Endless, and no solution will be found: <BR>
Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do, <BR>
And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines, <BR>
With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes <BR>
Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine. <BR>
Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; <BR>
For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr <BR>
Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine <BR>
Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou <BR>
Can end it.  Into thee such Vertue and Grace <BR>
Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know <BR>
In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare, <BR>
And this perverse Commotion governd thus, <BR>
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir <BR>
Of all things, to be Heir and to be King <BR>
By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. <BR>
Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might, <BR>
Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles <BR>
That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr, <BR>
My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms <BR>
Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; <BR>
Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out <BR>
From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep: <BR>
There let them learn, as likes them, to despise <BR>
God and MESSIAH his anointed King. <BR>
<BR>
  He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct <BR>
Shon full, he all his Father full exprest <BR>
Ineffably into his face receiv'd, <BR>
And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. <BR>
<BR>
  O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones, <BR>
First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst <BR>
To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee, <BR>
As is most just; this I my Glorie account, <BR>
My exaltation, and my whole delight, <BR>
That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will <BR>
Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. <BR>
Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume, <BR>
And gladlier shall resign, when in the end <BR>
Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee <BR>
For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st: <BR>
But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on <BR>
Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, <BR>
Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, <BR>
Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd, <BR>
To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down <BR>
To chains of Darkness, and th' undying Worm, <BR>
That from thy just obedience could revolt, <BR>
Whom to obey is happiness entire. <BR>
Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure <BR>
Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount <BR>
Unfained HALLELUIAHS to thee sing, <BR>
Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief. <BR>
So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose <BR>
From the right hand of Glorie where he sate, <BR>
And the third sacred Morn began to shine <BR>
Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound <BR>
The Chariot of Paternal Deitie, <BR>
Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn, <BR>
It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd <BR>
By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each <BR>
Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all <BR>
And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels <BR>
Of Beril, and careering Fires between; <BR>
Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament, <BR>
Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure <BR>
Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch. <BR>
Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd <BR>
Of radiant URIM, work divinely wrought, <BR>
Ascended, at his right hand Victorie <BR>
Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow <BR>
And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd, <BR>
And from about him fierce Effusion rowld <BR>
Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; <BR>
Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, <BR>
He onward came, farr off his coming shon, <BR>
And twentie thousand (I thir number heard) <BR>
Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen: <BR>
Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime <BR>
On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd. <BR>
Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own <BR>
First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd, <BR>
When the great Ensign of MESSIAH blaz'd <BR>
Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n: <BR>
Under whose Conduct MICHAEL soon reduc'd <BR>
His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing, <BR>
Under thir Head imbodied all in one. <BR>
Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd; <BR>
At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd <BR>
Each to his place, they heard his voice and went <BR>
Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd, <BR>
And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd. <BR>
This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur'd, <BR>
And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers <BR>
Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. <BR>
In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? <BR>
But to convince the proud what Signs availe, <BR>
Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent? <BR>
They hard'nd more by what might most reclame, <BR>
Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight <BR>
Took envie, and aspiring to his highth, <BR>
Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud <BR>
Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile <BR>
Against God and MESSIAH, or to fall <BR>
In universal ruin last, and now <BR>
To final Battel drew, disdaining flight, <BR>
Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God <BR>
To all his Host on either hand thus spake. <BR>
<BR>
  Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand <BR>
Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest; <BR>
Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God <BR>
Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause, <BR>
And as ye have receivd, so have ye don <BR>
Invincibly; but of this cursed crew <BR>
The punishment to other hand belongs, <BR>
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; <BR>
Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd <BR>
Nor multitude, stand onely and behold <BR>
Gods indignation on these Godless pourd <BR>
By mee; not you but mee they have despis'd, <BR>
Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, <BR>
Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream <BR>
Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, <BR>
Hath honourd me according to his will. <BR>
Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd; <BR>
That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee <BR>
In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, <BR>
Or I alone against them, since by strength <BR>
They measure all, of other excellence <BR>
Not emulous, nor care who them excells; <BR>
Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd <BR>
His count'nance too severe to be beheld <BR>
And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies. <BR>
At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings <BR>
With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes <BR>
Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound <BR>
Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. <BR>
Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, <BR>
Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles <BR>
The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, <BR>
All but the Throne it self of God.  Full soon <BR>
Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand <BR>
Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent <BR>
Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd <BR>
Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, <BR>
All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd; <BR>
O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode <BR>
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, <BR>
That wish'd the Mountains now might be again <BR>
Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. <BR>
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell <BR>
His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure, <BR>
Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels, <BR>
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes, <BR>
One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye <BR>
Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire <BR>
Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength, <BR>
And of thir wonted vigour left them draind, <BR>
Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n. <BR>
Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd <BR>
His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant <BR>
Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n: <BR>
The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard <BR>
Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd <BR>
Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd <BR>
With terrors and with furies to the bounds <BR>
And Chrystall wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide, <BR>
Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd <BR>
Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight <BR>
Strook them with horror backward, but far worse <BR>
Urg'd them behind; headlong themselvs they threw <BR>
Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth <BR>
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. <BR>
<BR>
  Hell heard th' unsufferable noise, Hell saw <BR>
Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled <BR>
Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep <BR>
Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. <BR>
Nine dayes they fell; confounded CHAOS roard, <BR>
And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall <BR>
Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout <BR>
Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last <BR>
Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd, <BR>
Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire <BR>
Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. <BR>
Disburd'nd Heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird <BR>
Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. <BR>
Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes <BR>
MESSIAH his triumphal Chariot turnd: <BR>
To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood <BR>
Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts, <BR>
With Jubilie advanc'd; and as they went, <BR>
Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright, <BR>
Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King, <BR>
Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n, <BR>
Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode <BR>
Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts <BR>
And Temple of his mightie Father Thron'd <BR>
On high; who into Glorie him receav'd, <BR>
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth <BR>
At thy request, and that thou maist beware <BR>
By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd <BR>
What might have else to human Race bin hid; <BR>
The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav'n <BR>
Among th' Angelic Powers, and the deep fall <BR>
Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld <BR>
With SATAN, hee who envies now thy state, <BR>
Who now is plotting how he may seduce <BR>
Thee also from obedience, that with him <BR>
Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake <BR>
His punishment, Eternal miserie; <BR>
Which would be all his solace and revenge, <BR>
As a despite don against the most High, <BR>
Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe. <BR>
But list'n not to his Temptations, warne <BR>
Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard <BR>
By terrible Example the reward <BR>
Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, <BR>
Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress. <BR>
<BR>
     THE END OF THE SIXTH BOOK. <BR>
