<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A youth in the situation of Fred Greenwood cannot reason clearly,
even though he be right in his main conclusions. He had settled
into the belief that Motoza, the Sioux, had determined to subject
him to a lingering death through starvation; and yet if it were
he&mdash;as undoubtedly it was&mdash;who rolled the boulder into the canyon,
it indicated a wish to put the most sudden end possible to his
existence.</p>

<p>It would be painful to attempt to describe the experience of
the lad in the cavern at the side of the canyon. As is often the
case, his hunger diminished and was succeeded by a dull indifference,
in which the suffering of the mind outweighed that of the body.
The dreadful day at last drew to an end, and his situation and
condition were much the same as earlier in the forenoon. He had
not seen a living person, and had given over all hope of another
visit from his merciless enemy.</p>

<p>"He means that I shall perish for want of food, and there is
no help for it."</p>

<p>But with the coming of darkness the energy of the boy's nature
asserted itself. It was impossible now for the Sioux or his allies
to maintain a watch upon the mouth of the cavern, where the lad
was observed the moment he showed himself, and Fred determined
that as soon as it was fairly dark he would make an attempt that
should be crowned with success or that would end his sufferings
and wretchedness.</p>

<p>His plan was to let himself down from the ledge to the top of
the nearest rock, and then try to reach the break in the canyon
as he had ascended it under the guidance of his captor. It was
not to be supposed that the vigilant Motoza would leave the way
open for him, though his actions pointed to the belief that it
was utterly impossible for the prisoner to escape by that means.</p>

<p>Nor in truth was it possible, for in the impenetrable gloom he
was certain to miss his foothold sooner or later and be flung
into the torrent, with no possibility of the good fortune that
attended Jack Dudley, who had a much less distance to traverse.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the evening when Fred came once more and
for the last time to the front of the cavern. With that attention
to trifling matters which a person sometimes shows in the most
trying crises he wound up his watch, examined his clothing to
see that everything was right, adjusted his hat so that it was
not likely to be displaced, and looked out in the gloom. All that
he could see was when he gazed upward and observed a few stars
twinkling in the thin streak of sky.</p>

<p>"Two things are certain," he mused: "that Indian does not think
it possible for me to make my way out of the canyon; and, if I
should succeed, he will be on the watch for me and shoot or try
to force me to return. He shall never get me back here, for I
will take the risk of drowning, and then&#11834;"</p>

<p>A thought flashed through him like an inspiration and fairly
took away his breath.</p>

<p>Why not climb the side of the canyon?</p>

<p>He was so overcome by the question, which seemed born of heaven,
that he stood dazed and bewildered. Then he became cool again
and asked:</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>He recalled that Hank Hazletine had told him he had done it during
the daytime, and it must have been somewhere in this neighborhood.
The task would seem easy if the sun were shining, but if it were
shining Fred Greenwood would not have been permitted to make the
attempt.</p>

<p>He was convinced of another thing: the depth of the canyon had
been repeatedly referred to as being a thousand feet, but there
were places where it was less than half that extent, and he remembered
a depression in the earth, almost directly overhead, which must
have lessened the prodigious height found at other points.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a climb of several hundred feet up the perpendicular
side of a canyon or mountain wall is severe work to the most powerful
and best trained man, and its formidable nature was proved by
the fact that some of the cowmen would not try it by daylight.</p>

<p>Nothing could be clearer than that Motoza had not hesitated to
leave his prisoner alone in the cavern for the reason that he
was certain he could not effect his escape therefrom. The last
means the youth would think of employing was that of climbing
the side; therefore, as Fred reasoned, that was the very means
to adopt, and the only one that could possibly succeed.</p>

<p>"I'll try it!" was his conclusion, after a few minutes' thought.</p>

<p>Before setting out on the unparalleled task he fervently asked
the help of the only One who could extricate him from his peril.
Then he summoned his strength and courage to the tremendous work.</p>

<p>His dread now was that Motoza would put in an appearance before
he was clear of the mouth of the cavern. Had the lad thought of
the daring scheme earlier in the day he would have studied the
stupendous stairs upon which all his hopes now rested, but it
was too late to think of that.</p>

<p>Reaching upward, he grasped one of the projecting points of rock
and drew himself clear of the opening in front of the cavern.
Naturally muscular and active, with all his nerves in superb control,
the effort was trifling. Within less time than would be supposed
he had climbed fully fifty feet without meeting with any difficulty.
Then the first thrill of alarm shot through him as one foot slipped
and he narrowly missed falling.</p>

<p>He found a good place to rest, and immediately adopted a sensible
precaution. Removing both shoes, he tied the strings together
and slung them over his shoulder, with the fastening under his
chin. This would make it rough for his stockinged feet, but it
was worth it all. He was not discommoded by rifle or pistol, and
could not have been better prepared for climbing.</p>

<p>He felt as yet no fatigue, and resumed his work as soon as he
was ready. If he continued to find projections such as he had
found thus far, there was no reason why he should not reach the
level ground above in safety. As an evidence of how fate sometimes
plays fast and loose with us, it is certain that Hank Hazletine
entered the cavern while his young friend was climbing the wall
overhead, without either dreaming of the actual situation.</p>

<p>Fred Greenwood, at the beginning of his climb for liberty, was
subjected to a peculiar peril. He had rested but a moment, when
he was seized with an extraordinary "panicky" feeling. He was
sure that Motoza was standing on the ledge below, peering upward
in the gloom, and holding his rifle ready to fire at him on the
instant he could make his aim certain.</p>

<p>Like all such emotions, it was opposed to common sense. According
to his belief it was out of the power of the Sioux to obtain the
most shadowy glimpse of him, and the youth ought to have felt
as secure against being picked off as if in his home, hundreds
of miles away; but the feeling for a time was uncontrollable,
and, yielding to it, he began frantically climbing, never abating
his efforts until he had gone fully fifty feet higher. By that
time he was all a-tremble, and so weak that he was forced to pause
for rest. Thus far he had been extremely fortunate in meeting
with no difficulty, the projections affording abundant support
for hands and feet. Moreover, he had again attained a ledge where
he was able to sustain himself with comparative ease.</p>

<p>He paused, panting, trembling and exhausted. Thrusting out his
head as far as was safe, he looked downward. Nothing but impenetrable
gloom met his eye. He could hear the torrent rushing against the
rocks and boulders in its path, and flinging itself against the
walls of the canyon, but he could distinguish nothing, and his
strong sense now came to his rescue.</p>

<p>"If he is down there he cannot see me; he will not dream I have
started to climb the wall, and therefore will not follow. If he
does, he must appear below me, and I will kick him loose the minute
I see him. How foolish to be afraid!"</p>

<p>In a few minutes his nerves became calmer, but he began to realize
the nature of the terrifying task before him. There was no thought
of retreat on his part, and he was determined to keep on, so long
as the work was possible.</p>

<p>His feet were paining him, and were certain to pain him a good
deal more before he reached the top; but healthy, rugged youth
has elastic muscles, and in a short time Fred was ready to resume
his work. His panic was gone, and he exerted himself with the
deliberate care which he should have shown from the first.</p>

<p>As nearly as he could judge he had climbed some twenty paces,
when he was startled, upon extending his hand upward, to encounter
only the smooth face of the wall. Hitherto there had been more
projections than he required, but now the steps appeared to vanish,
leaving him without any support.</p>

<p>Could it be he would have to abandon his effort after making
so fine a start? Must he pick his way down the side of the canyon,
again, to the cavern, and there meekly resume the torture of waiting
for death from starvation? Failure was too terrible to be thought
of, and he resumed his searching for the indispensable support.</p>

<p>Certainly there was nothing directly above him that would serve,
and he passed his right hand to one side. Ah! he caught the sharp
edge, after groping for a few seconds. Leaning over, he reached
out as far as possible and found the projection extended indefinitely.</p>

<p>"It will do!" he muttered, with a thrill, and, without pausing
to reflect upon the fearful risk of the thing, he swung himself
along, sustained for an instant by his single hand; but the other
was immediately alongside of it, and it was easy to hold himself
like a pendulum swaying over the frightful abyss. But there was
nothing upon which to rest his feet. He did not wish anything,
and, swinging sideways, threw one leg over the ledge beside his
hands, and, half-rolling over, raised himself securely for the
time on his perch.</p>

<p>"Gracious!" he exclaimed, pausing from the effort; "if I had
stopped to think, I shouldn't have dared to try it. If this ledge
had been smaller I shouldn't have found room for my body, and
there is no way of getting back to the stone on which I was standing.
I <em>must</em> go on now, for I cannot go back."</p>

<p>It was plain sailing for a few minutes. The flinty excrescences
were as numerous as ever, and he never paused in his ascent until
prudence whispered that it was wise to take another breathing
spell. It was a source of infinite comfort to feel that when he
thus checked himself he was not compelled to do so for lack of
support.</p>

<p>There was no way of determining how far he had climbed, and he
based his calculation on hope rather than knowledge. The roar
of the canyon was notably fainter, and, when he looked aloft,
the ribbon of starlit sky appeared nearer than at first. There
could be no doubt that he was making his ascent at the most favorable
point, for the height was much less than at most of the other
places, and he believed this was the portion where Hank Hazletine
had climbed from the bottom to the top of the gorge. Could he
have been certain of the latter, all misgiving would have vanished.</p>

<p>Not a trace of his panic remained. If Motoza had returned to
the cavern, and, discovering the flight of his prisoner, set out
to follow him, there was little prospect of his success, for the
fugitive had varied from a direct line, and the Sioux might pass
within arm's length without being aware of the fact.</p>

<p>There was one peril to which Fred was exposed, and it was fortunate
it never entered his mind. Supposing Motoza was standing on the
ledge at the bottom of the canyon and gazing upward, weapon in
hand, it was quite probable that he would be able to locate the
youth. This would be not because of any superiority of vision,
but because of that patch of sky beyond, acting as a background
for the climber. With his inky figure thrown in relief against
the stars, his enemy could have picked him off as readily as if
the sun were shining.</p>

<p>This possibility, we say, did not present itself to Fred Greenwood,
and, more providential than all, Motoza was not in the canyon.</p>

<p>The slipping of one foot tore most of the sole from the stocking,
and his foot had henceforth no protection against the craggy surface.</p>

<p>"I don't mind the stocking," grimly reflected the youth, "for
there is another pair in camp and plenty of them at the ranch,
but how it hurts!"</p>

<p>He would have been altogether lacking in the pluck he had displayed
thus far had he been deterred by physical suffering from pushing
his efforts to the utmost. He would have kept on through torture
tenfold worse, and he showed himself no mercy.</p>

<p>Few people who have not been called upon to undertake such a
work can form an idea of its exhausting nature. It would be hard
to think of anyone better prepared than Fred Greenwood to stand
the terrific draught upon his strength; but while a long way from
the top, and while there was no lack of supports for his hands
and feet, and in the face of his unshakable resolve, he was compelled
to doubt his success. It seemed as if the dizzy height did not
diminish. When he had climbed for a long time and stopped, panting
and suffering, the stars appeared to be as far away as ever. He
felt as if he ought to have been out of the ravine long before,
but the opening looked to be as unattainable as at the beginning.</p>

<p>His whole experience was remarkable to that extent that it can
be explained only on the ground that the intense mental strain
prevented his seeing things as they were. He had subjected his
muscles to such a tension that he was obliged to pause every few
minutes and rest. One of his feet was scarified and bleeding,
and the other only a little better. When he looked upward his
heart sank, for a long distance still interposed between him and
the ground above.</p>

<p>"I must have picked the place where the canyon is deepest," was
his despairing conclusion; "I feel hardly able to hang on, and
would not dare do what I did further below."</p>

<p>He now yielded to a curious whim. Instead of continually gazing
at the sky, that he might measure the distance remaining to be
traversed, he resolved not to look at it at all until he had climbed
a long way. He hoped by doing this to discover such a marked decrease
in the space that it would reanimate him for the remaining work.</p>

<p>Accordingly he closed his eyes, and, depending on the sense of
feeling alone, which in truth was his reliance from the first,
he toiled steadily upward. Sometimes he had to grope with his
hands for a minute or two before daring to leave the support on
which his feet rested, but one of his causes for astonishment
and thankfulness was that such aids seemed never to be lacking.</p>

<p>He continued this blind progress until his wearied muscles refused
to obey further. He must rest or he would drop to the bottom from
exhaustion. He hooked his right arm over the point of a rock,
sat upon a favoring projection below, and decided to wait until
his strength was fully restored.</p>

<p>He could not resist the temptation to look up and learn how much
yet remained to do.</p>

<p>Could he believe his senses? He was within a dozen feet of the
top!</p>

<p>He gasped with amazement, grew faint, and then was thrilled with
hope. He even broke into a cheer, for the knowledge was like nectar
to the traveller perishing of thirst in the desert&mdash;it was life
itself.</p>

<p>All pain, all suffering, all fatigue were forgotten in the blissful
knowledge. He bent to his work with redoubled vigor. If the supports
continued, his stupendous task was virtually ended.</p>

<p>And they did continue. Not once did the eagerly-feeling hands
fail to grasp a projection of some form which could be made to
serve his purpose. Up, up he went, until the clear, cool air fanned
his temples, when, with a last effort, he drew himself from the
canyon, and, plunging forward on his face, fainted dead away.</p>

<p>He lay in a semi-conscious condition for nearly an hour. Then,
when his senses slowly returned, he raised himself to a sitting
position and looked around. It was too early for the moon, and
the gloom prevented his seeing more than a few paces in any direction.</p>

<p>But how the pain racked him! It seemed as if every bone was aching
and every muscle sore. The feet had been wholly worn from each
stocking, and his own feet were torn and bleeding. He had preserved
his shoes, but when he came to put them on he groaned with anguish.
His feet were so swollen that it was torture to cover them, and
he could not tie the strings; but they must be protected, and
he did not rise until they were thus armored.</p>

<p>He was without any weapons, but the torment of his wounds drove
that fact from his mind. All that he wanted now was to get away
from the spot where he could not help believing he was still in
danger of recapture. But when he stood erect and the agony shot
through his frame, he asked himself whether it was possible to
travel to the plateau without help; and yet the effort must be
made.</p>

<p>He had a general knowledge of his situation, and, bracing himself
for the effort, he began the work. It was torture from the first,
but after taking a few steps his system partly accommodated itself
to the requirement and he progressed better than he anticipated.
He was still on the wrong side of the canyon, which it was necessary
to leave before rejoining his friends. He was wise enough to distrust
his own capacity after the fearful strain, and did not make the
attempt until he found a place where the width was hardly one-half
of the extent leaped by him and Jack Dudley. As it was, the jump,
into which he put all his vigor, landed him just clear of the
edge, a fact which did much to lessen the sharp suffering caused
by alighting on his feet.</p>

<p>He yearned to sit down and rest, but was restrained by the certainty
that it would make his anguish more intense when he resumed his
tramp toward camp. Furthermore, as he believed himself nearing
safety, his impatience deepened and kept him at work when he should
have ceased.</p>

<p>As he painfully trudged along, his thoughts reverted to his climb
up the side of the canyon and he shuddered; for, now that it was
over, he could not comprehend how he dared ever make the effort.
Not for the world would he repeat it, even by daylight.</p>

<p>"Heaven brought me safely through," was his grateful thought.</p>

<p>But as he drew near the plateau his musings turned thither. He
had counted upon finding Jack Dudley and the guide there; but
they might be miles away, and he would not see them for days.
He knew he needed attention from his friends and could not sustain
himself much longer. If he should be unable to find them&#11834;</p>

<p>But all these gloomy forebodings were scattered a few minutes
later by the glimmer of the camp-fire on the other side of the
plateau. One of his friends at least must be there, and providentially
it proved that both were present.</p>
