<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Deliciously weary, every fibre in her throbbing with physical
fatigue, she had nevertheless found it impossible to sleep.</p>

<p>The vivid memory of Duane holding her in his arms, while she
gave her heart to him with her lips, left her tremulous and confused
by emotions of which she yet knew little.</p>

<p>Toward dawn a fever of unrest drove her from her hot, crushed
pillows to the cool of the open casements. The morning was dark
and very still; no breeze stirred; a few big, widely scattered
stars watched her. For a long while she stood there trying to
quiet the rapid pulse and fast breathing; and at length, with
an excited little laugh, she sank down among the cushions on the
window-seat and lay back very still, her head, with its glossy,
disordered hair, cradled in her arms.</p>

<p>"Is <em>this</em> love?" she said to herself. "Is this what it
is doing to me? Am I never again going to sleep?"</p>

<p>But she could not lie still; her restless hands began groping
about in the darkness, and presently the fire from a cigarette
glimmered red.</p>

<p>She remained quiet for a few moments, elbow among the pillows,
cheek on hand, watching the misty spirals float through the open
window. After a while she sat up nervously and tossed the cigarette
from her. Like a falling star the spark whirled earthward in a
wide curve, glowed for a few seconds on the lawn below, and slowly
died out.</p>

<p>Then an inexplicable thing occurred. Unthinkingly she had turned
over and extended her arm, searching in the darkness behind her.
There came a tinkle, a vague violet perfume, and the starlight
fell on her clustering hair and throat as she lifted and drained
the brimming glass.</p>

<p>Suddenly she stood up; the frail, crystal glass fell from her
fingers, splintering on the stone sill; and with a quick, frightened
intake of breath, lips still wet and scented, and the fire of
it already stealing through her veins, she awoke to stunned comprehension
of what she had done.</p>

<p>For a moment only startled astonishment dominated her. That she
could have done this thing so instinctively and without forethought
or intent, seemed impossible. She bowed her head in her hands,
striving desperately to recollect the circumstances; she sprang
to her feet and paced the darkened room, trying to understand.
A terrified and childish surprise possessed her, which changed
slowly to anger and impatience as she began to realise the subtle
treachery that habit had practised on her&mdash;so stealthy is habit,
betraying the body unawares.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with consternation, she seated herself to consider
the circumstances; little flashes of alarm assisted her. Then
a sort of delicate madness took possession of her, deafening her
ears to the voice of fear. She refused to be afraid.</p>

<p>As she sat there, both hands unconsciously indenting her breast,
the clamour and tumult of her senses drowned the voice within.</p>

<p>No, she would not be afraid!&mdash;though the burning perfume was
mounting to her head with every breath and the glow grew steadily
in her body, creeping from vein to vein. No, she would not be
afraid. It could never happen again. She would be on her guard
after this.... Besides, the forgetfulness had been so momentary,
the imprudence so very slight ... and it had helped her, too&mdash;it
was already making her sleepy ... and she had needed something
to quiet her&mdash;needed sleep....</p>

<p>After a long while she turned languidly and picked up the little
crystal flask from the dresser&mdash;an antique bit of glass which
Rosalie had given her.</p>

<p>Dawn whitened the edges of the sky; the birds were becoming very
noisy. She lifted the curiously cut relic; an imprisoned fluid
glimmered with pale-violet light&mdash;some scented French distillation
which Rosalie affected because nobody else had ever heard of it&mdash;an
aromatic, fiery essence, faintly perfumed.</p>

<p>For a moment the girl gazed at it curiously. Then, on deliberate
impulse, she filled another glass.</p>

<p>"One thing is certain," she said to herself; "if I am capable
of controlling myself at all, I must begin now. If I should touch
this it would be excess.... I would like to, but"&mdash;she flung the
contents from the window&mdash;"I won't. And <em>that</em> is the way
I am able to control myself."</p>

<p>She smiled, set the glass aside, and raised her eyes to the paling
stars. When at last she stretched herself out on the bed, dawn
was already lighting the room, but she fell asleep at once.</p>

<p>It was a flushed and rather heavy slumber, not perfectly natural;
and when Kathleen entered at nine o'clock, followed by Geraldine's
maid with the breakfast-tray, the girl still lay with face buried
in her hair, breathing deeply and irregularly, her lashes wet
with tears.</p>

<p>The maid retired; Kathleen bent low over the feverishly parted
lips, kissed them, hesitated, drew back sharply, and cast a rapid
glance around the room. Then she went over to the dressing-table
and lifted Rosalie's antique flaçon; and set it back slowly, as
the girl turned her face on the pillow and opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>For a few seconds she lay quite motionless, then, rising on one
elbow, she passed the backs of her fingers across her lids, laughed
sleepily, and straightened up, freeing her eyes from the confusion
of her hair.</p>

<p>"I've had horrid dreams. I've been crying in my sleep. Come here,"
she said, stretching out her arms, and Kathleen went slowly.</p>

<p>The girl pulled her head down, linking both arms around her neck:</p>

<p>"You darling, can you ever guess what miracle happened to me
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"No.... What?"</p>

<p>"I promised to marry Duane Mallett!"</p>

<p>There was no reply. The girl clung to her excitedly, burying
her face against Kathleen's cheek, then released her with a laugh,
and saw her face&mdash;saw the sorrowful amazement in it, the pain.</p>

<p>"Kathleen!" she exclaimed, startled, "what is the matter?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Severn dropped down on the bed's edge, her hands loosely
clasped. Geraldine's brown eyes searched hers in hurt astonishment.</p>

<p>"Aren't you glad for me, Kathleen? What is it? Why do you&mdash;"
And all at once she divined, and the hot colour stained her from
brow to throat. Kathleen bent forward swiftly and caught her in
her arms with a smothered cry; but the girl freed herself and
leaned back, breathing fast.</p>

<p>"Duane knows about me," she said. "I told him."</p>

<p>"He knew before you told him, my darling."</p>

<p>Another wave of scarlet swept Geraldine's face.</p>

<p>"That is true.... He found out&mdash;last April.... But he and I are
not afraid. I promised him&mdash;" And her voice failed as the memory
of the night's indulgence flashed in her brain.</p>

<p>Kathleen began: "You promised me, too&mdash;" And her voice also failed.</p>

<p>There was a silence; the girl's eyes turned miserably toward
the dressing-table, closed with a slow, inward breath which ended
like a sob; and again she was in Kathleen's arms&mdash;struggled from
them only to drop her head on Kathleen's knees and lie, tense
face hidden, both hands clenched. The wave of grief and shame
swept her and passed.</p>

<p>After a while she spoke in a hard little voice:</p>

<p>"It is foolish to say I cannot control myself.... I did not think
what I was doing last night&mdash;that was all. Duane knows my danger&mdash;tendency,
I mean. He isn't worried; he knows that I can take care of myself&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't marry him until <em>you</em> know you can."</p>

<p>"But I am perfectly certain of myself now!"</p>

<p>"Only prove it, darling. Be frank with me. Who in the world loves
you as I do, Geraldine? Who desires happiness for you as I do?
What have I in life besides you and Scott?... And lately, dearest
&mdash;I <em>must</em> speak as I feel&mdash;something&mdash;some indefinable
constraint seems to have grown between you and me&mdash;something &mdash;I
don't exactly know what&mdash;that threatens our intimate understanding&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, there is nothing!"</p>

<p>"Be honest with me, dear. What is it?"</p>

<p>The girl lay silent for a while, then:</p>

<p>"I don't know myself. I have been&mdash;worried. It may have been
that."</p>

<p>"Worried about yourself, you poor lamb?"</p>

<p>"A little.... And a little about Duane."</p>

<p>"But, darling, if Duane loves you, that is all cleared up, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... But for a long time he and Rosalie made me perfectly
wretched.... I didn't know I was in love with him, either....
And I couldn't sleep very much, and I &mdash;I simply couldn't
tell you how unhappy they were making me&mdash;and <em>I&mdash;</em>sometimes&mdash;now
and then&mdash;in fact, very often, <em>I&mdash;</em>formed the custom of&mdash;doing
what I ought not to have done&mdash;to steady my nerves&mdash;in fact, I
simply let myself go&mdash;badly."</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling! My darling! Couldn't you have told me&mdash;let me
sit with you, talk, read to you&mdash;<em>love</em> you to sleep? Why
did you do this, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;very disgraceful&mdash;ever happened. It only helped me
to sleep when I was excited and miserable.... <em>I&mdash;I </em>didn't
care what I did &mdash;Duane and Rosalie made me so wretched.
And there seemed no use in my trying to be different from others,
and I thought I might as well be as rotten as everybody. But I
tried and couldn't &mdash;I tried, for instance, to misbehave
with Jack Dysart, but I couldn't&mdash;and I only hated myself and
him and Rosalie and Duane!"</p>

<p>She sat up, flushed, dishevelled, lips quivering. "I want to
confess! I've been horribly depraved for a week! I gambled with
the Pink 'uns and swore as fashionably as I knew how! I scorched
my tongue with cigarettes; I sat in Bunny Gray's room with the
door bolted and let him teach me how to make silver fizzes and
Chinese juleps out of Rose wine and saki! I let Jack Dysart retain
my hand&mdash;and try to kiss me&mdash;several times&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Geraldine!"</p>

<p>"I <em>did</em>. I wanted to be horrid."</p>

<p>She sat there breathing fast, her big brown eyes looking defiantly
at Kathleen, but the child's mouth quivered beyond control and
the nervous hands tightened and relaxed.</p>

<p>"How bad have I been, Kathleen? It sounds pretty bad to tell
it. But Muriel says 'damn!' and Rosalie says 'the devil!' and
when anything goes wrong and I say, 'Oh, fluff!' I mean swearing,
so I thought I'd do it.... And almost every woman I know smokes
and has her favourite cocktail, and they all bet and play for
stakes; and from what I hear talked about, nobody's conduct is
modified because anybody happens to be married&#11834;"</p>

<p>The horror in Kathleen's blue eyes checked her; she hid her face
in her hands for a moment, then flung out her arms and crushed
Kathleen to her breast.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell Duane how I've behaved. I couldn't rest until
he knows the very worst ... how fearfully common and bad a girl
I can be. Darling, don't break down. I don't want to go any closer
to the danger line than I've been. And, oh, I'm so ashamed, so
humiliated&mdash;I &mdash;I wish I could go to Duane as&mdash;as clean and
sweet and innocent as he would have me. For he is the dearest
boy&mdash;and I love him so, Kathleen. I'm so silly about him.... I've
got to tell him how I behaved, haven't I?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'I want to confess! I've been horribly depraved
for a week!'"]</p>

<p>"Are&mdash;are you going to?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am!" ... She drew away and sat up very straight
in bed, serious, sombre-eyed, hands clasped tightly about her
knees.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said, as though to herself, "it is curious
that a trivial desire for anything like that"&mdash;pointing to Rosalie's
gift&mdash;"should make me restless&mdash;annoy me, cause me discomfort.
I can't understand why it should actually torment me. It really
does, sometimes."</p>

<p>"That is the terrible part of it," faltered Kathleen. "For God's
sake, keep clear of anything with even the faintest odour of alcohol
about it.... Where did you find that cut-glass thing?"</p>

<p>"Rosalie gave it to me."</p>

<p>"What is in it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;crême de something or other."</p>

<p>Kathleen took the girl's tightly clasped hands in hers:</p>

<p>"Geraldine, you've got to be square to Duane. You can't marry
him until you cleanse yourself, until you scour yourself free
of this terrible inclination for stimulants."</p>

<p>"H-how can I? I don't intend, ever again, to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Prove it then. Let sufficient time elapse&#11834;"</p>

<p>"How long? <em>A&mdash;</em>year?"</p>

<p>"Dear, if you will show a clean record of self-control for a
year I ask no more. It ought not to be difficult for you to dominate
this silly weakness. Your will-power is scarcely tainted. What
fills me with fear is this habit you have formed of caressing
danger&mdash;this childish trifling with something which is still asleep
in you&mdash;with all that is weak and ignoble. It is there&mdash;it is
in all of us&mdash;in you, too. Don't rouse it; it is still asleep&mdash;merely
a little restless in its slumber&mdash;but, oh, Geraldine! Geraldine!&mdash;if
you ever awake it!&mdash;if you ever arouse it to its full, fierce
consciousness&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I won't," said the girl hastily. "Oh, I won't, I won't, Kathleen,
darling. I do know it's in me &mdash;I feel that if I ever let
myself go I could be reckless and wicked. But truly, truly, I
won't. <em>I&mdash;</em>darling, you mustn't cry&mdash;please, don't&mdash;because
you are making me cry. I cried in my sleep, too.... I ought to
be very happy&mdash;" She forced a laugh through the bright tears fringing
her lashes, bent forward swiftly, kissed Kathleen, and sprang
from the bed.</p>

<p>"I want my bath and breakfast!" she cried. "If I'm to be a Louis
<em>XVI </em>doll this week, it's time my face was washed and
my sawdust reinforced. Do fix my tray, dear, while I'm in the
bath&mdash;and ring for my maid.... And when you go down you may tell
Duane to wait for me on the stairs. It's good discipline; he'll
find it stupid because I'll be a long time&mdash;but, oh, Kathleen,
it is perfectly heavenly to bully him!"</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Later she sent a note to him by her maid:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"TO <em>THE ONLY MAN IN THE WORLD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ON THE STAIRS</em>.

</p>
<p>
"<em>Patient Sir</em>: If you will go to the large beech-tree beyond<br/>
Hurryon Gate and busy yourself by carving upon it certain initials<br/>
intertwined within the circumscribed outlines of a symbol popularly<br/>
supposed to represent a human heart, your industry will be<br/>
presently and miraculously rewarded by the apparition of her who<br/>
presumably occupies no inconsiderable place in your affections."

</p>
</div>
<p>At the Hurryon Gate Duane found Rosalie trying to unlock it,
a dainty, smiling Rosalie, fresh as a blossom, and absurdly like
a schoolgirl with her low-cut collar, snowy neck, and the thick
braid of hair. Under her arm she carried her bathing-dress.</p>

<p>"I'm going for a swim; I nearly perished with the heat last night....
Did you sleep well, Duane?"</p>

<p>"Rather well."</p>

<p>She hesitated, looked up: "Are you coming with me?"</p>

<p>"I have an appointment."</p>

<p>"Oh!... Are you going to let me go alone?"</p>

<p>He laughed: "I've no choice; I really have an appointment this
morning."</p>

<p>She inspected him, drew a step nearer, laid both hands lightly
on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Duane, dear," she said, "are you really going to let me drift
past you out to sea&mdash;after all?"</p>

<p>"What else can I do? Besides, you are not going to drift."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. You were very nice to me yesterday."</p>

<p>"It was you who were very sweet to me.... But I told you how
matters stand. You care for your husband."</p>

<p>"Yes, you did tell me. But it is not true. I thought about it
all night long; I find that I do not care for him&mdash;as you told
me I did."</p>

<p>He said, smiling: "Nor do you really care for me."</p>

<p>"I could care."</p>

<p>Her hands still lay lightly on his shoulders; he smilingly disengaged
them, saluted the finger tips, and swung them free.</p>

<p>"No, you couldn't," he said&mdash;"nor could I."</p>

<p>She clasped her hands behind her, confronting him with that gaily
audacious allure which he knew so well:</p>

<p>"Does a man really care whether or not he is in love with a woman
before he makes love to her?"</p>

<p>"Do you want an honest answer?"</p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;if she is sufficiently attractive, a man doesn't
usually care."</p>

<p>"Am I sufficiently attractive?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;why do you hesitate?... I know the rules of the game.
When one wearies, the other must pretend to.... And then they
make their adieux very amiably.... Isn't that a man's ideal of
an affair with a pretty woman?"</p>

<p>He laughed: "I suppose so."</p>

<p>"So do I. You are no novice, are you&mdash;as I am?"</p>

<p>"Are you a novice, Rosalie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. You probably don't believe it. It is absurd, isn't
it, considering these lonely years&mdash;considering what he has done&mdash;that
I haven't anything with which to reproach myself."</p>

<p>"It is very admirable," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, theoretically. I was too fastidious&mdash;perhaps a little
bit too decent. It's curious how inculcated morals and early precepts
make mountains out of what is really very simple travelling. If
a woman ceases to love her husband, she is going to miss too much
in life if she's afraid to love anybody else.... I suppose I have
been afraid."</p>

<p>"It's rather a wholesome sort of fear," he said.</p>

<p>"Wholesome as breakfast-food. I hate it. Besides, the fear doesn't
exist any more," shaking her head. "Like the pretty girls in a
very popular and profoundly philosophical entertainment, I've
simply got to love somebody"&mdash;she smiled at him&mdash;"and I'd prefer
to fall honestly and disgracefully in love with you&mdash;if you'd
give me the opportunity." There was a pause. "Otherwise," she
concluded, "I shall content myself with doing a mischief to your
sex where I can. I give you the choice, Duane &mdash;I give you
the disposal of myself. Am I to love&mdash;you?&mdash;or be loved by God
knows whom&mdash;and make him suffer for it"&mdash;she set her little even
teeth&mdash;"and pay back to men what man has done to me?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said good-humouredly; "isn't there anything except
playing at love that counts in the world?"</p>

<p>"Nothing counts without it. I've learned that much."</p>

<p>"Some people have done pretty well without it."</p>

<p>"You haven't. You might have been a really good painter if you
cared for a woman who cared for you. There's no tenderness in
your work; it's all technique and biceps."</p>

<p>He said gravely: "You are right."</p>

<p>"Am I?... Do you think you could try to care for me&mdash;even for
that reason, Duane&mdash;to become a better painter?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," he said pleasantly.</p>

<p>There was a silence; her expression changed subtly, then the
colour came back and she smiled and nodded adieu.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said; "I'm going to get into all sorts of mischief.
The black flag is hoisted. <em>Malheur aux hommes!</em>"</p>

<p>"There's one now," said Duane, laughing as Delancy Grandcourt's
bulk appeared among the trees along Hurryon Water. "Lord! what
a bungler he is on a trout-stream!"</p>

<p>Rosalie turned and gazed at the big, clumsy young man who was
fishing with earnestness and method every unlikely pool in sight.</p>

<p>"Does he belong to anybody?" she asked, considering him. "I want
to do real damage. He is usually at Geraldine's heels, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, let him alone," said Duane; "he's an awfully decent fellow.
If a man of that slow, plodding, faithful species ever is thoroughly
aroused by a woman, it will be a lively day for his tormentor."</p>

<p>Rosalie's blue eyes sparkled: "Will it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it will. You had better not play hob with Delancy. Are
you intending to?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Look at the man! That's the fourth time he's landed
his line in a bush! He'll fall into that pool if he's not&mdash;mercy!&mdash;there
he goes! Did you ever see such a genius for clumsiness?"</p>

<p>She was moving forward through the trees as she spoke; Duane
called after her in a warning voice:</p>

<p>"Don't try to do anything to disturb him. It's not good sport;
he's a mighty decent sort, I tell you."</p>

<p>"I won't play any tricks on your good young man," she said with
a shrug of contempt, and sauntered off toward the Gray Water.
Her path, however, crossed Grandcourt's, and as she stepped upon
the footbridge she glanced down, where, wading gingerly in mid-stream,
Delancy floundered and panted and barely contrived to maintain
a precarious footing, while sending his flies sprawling down the
rapids.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," she nodded, as he caught sight of her. He attempted
to take off his cap, slipped, wallowed, and recovered his balance
by miracle alone.</p>

<p>"There's a thumping big trout under that bridge," he informed
her eagerly; "he ran downstream just now, but I can't seem to
raise him."</p>

<p>"You splash too much. You'd probably raise him if you raised
less of something else."</p>

<p>"Is that it?" he inquired innocently. "I try not to, but I generally
manage to raise hell with every pool before I get a chance to
fish it. I'll show you just where he lies. Watch!"</p>

<p>His cast of flies whistled wildly; there was a quick pang of
pain in her shoulder and she gave a frightened cry.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! Have I got <em>you</em>?" he exclaimed, aghast.</p>

<p>"You certainly have," she retorted, exasperated, "and you had
better come up and get this hook out! You'll need it if you want
to fish any more."</p>

<p>Dripping and horrified, he scrambled up the bank to the footbridge;
she flinched, but made no sound, as he freed her from the hook;
a red stain appeared on the sleeve of her waist, above the elbow.</p>

<p>"It's fortunate that it was a b-barbless hook," he stammered,
horribly embarrassed and contemplating with dismay the damage
he had accomplished; "otherwise," he added, "we would have had
to cut out the hook. We're rather lucky, I think. Is it very painful?"</p>

<p>"Sufficiently," she said, disgusted. "But I suppose this sort
of thing is nothing unusual for you."</p>

<p>"I've hooked one or two people," he admitted, reddening. "I suppose
you won't bother to forgive me, but I'm terribly sorry. If you'll
let me put a little mud on it&#11834;"</p>

<p>She disdained to reply. He hovered about her, clumsily solicitous,
and whichever way she turned, he managed to get underfoot, until,
thoroughly vexed, she stood stock-still and opened her arms with
a hopeless gesture:</p>

<p>"What <em>are</em> you trying to do, Delancy? Do you want to
embrace me? I wish you wouldn't leap about me like a great Dane
puppy!"</p>

<p>The red surged up into his face anew:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "I'm very sorry."</p>

<p>She looked at him curiously: "I beg yours&mdash;you big, silly boy.
Don't blush at me. Great Danes are exceedingly desirable property,
you know.... Did you wish to be forgiven for anything? What on
earth are you doing with that horrid fistful of muck?"</p>

<p>"I only want to put some mud on that wound, if you'll let me.
It's good for hornet stings&#11834;"</p>

<p>She laughed and backed away: "Do you believe there is any virtue
in mud, Delancy?&mdash;good, deep mire&mdash;when one is bruised and sore
and lonely and desperate? Oh, don't try to understand&mdash;what a
funny, confused, stupid way you have of looking at me! I remember
you used to look at me that way sometimes&mdash;oh, long ago&mdash;before
I was married, I think."</p>

<p>The heavy colour which surged so readily to his temples began
to amuse her; she leaned back against the bridge rail and contemplated
him with smiling disdain.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said, "years ago, I had a slight, healthy
suspicion that you were on the verge of falling in love with me."</p>

<p>He tried to smile, but the colour died out in his face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was on the verge," he contrived to answer.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you fall over?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it was because you married Jack Dysart," he said simply.</p>

<p>"Was <em>that</em> all?"</p>

<p>"All?" He thought he perceived the jest, and managed to laugh
again.</p>

<p>"Really, I am perfectly serious," repeated Rosalie. "Was that
all that prevented you from falling in love with me&mdash;because I
was married?"</p>

<p>"I think so," he said. "Wasn't it reason enough?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was enough for a man. I don't believe I know
exactly how men consider such matters.... You've managed to hook
that fly into my gown again! And now you've torn the skirt hopelessly!
What a devastating sort of creature you are, Delancy! You used
to step on my slippers at dancing school, and, oh, Heaven! how
I hated you.... Where are you going?" for he had begun to walk
away, reeling in his wet line as he moved, his grave, highly coloured
face lowered, troubled eyes intent on what he was doing.</p>

<p>When she spoke, he halted and raised his head, and she saw the
muscles flexed under the bronze skin of the jaw&mdash;saw the lines
of pain appear where his mouth tightened. All of the clumsy boy
in him had vanished; she had never troubled herself to look at
him very closely, and it surprised her to see how worn his face
really was under the eyes and cheek-bones&mdash;really surprised her
that there was much of dignity, even of a certain nobility, in
his quiet gaze.</p>

<p>"I asked you where you are going?" she repeated with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>"Nowhere in particular."</p>

<p>"But you are going <em>somewhere</em>, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"In my direction?"</p>

<p>"I think not."</p>

<p>"That is very rude of you, Delancy&mdash;when you don't even know
where my direction lies. Do you think," she demanded, amused,
"that it is particularly civil of a man to terminate an interview
with a woman before she offers him his congé?"</p>

<p>He finished reeling in his line, hooked the drop-fly into the
reel-guide, shifted his creel, buttoned on the landing-net, and
quietly turned around and inspected Mrs. Dysart.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you something," he said. "I have never, even
as a boy, had from you a single word which did not in some vague
manner convey a hint of your contempt for me. Do you realise that?"</p>

<p>"W-what!" she faltered, bewildered.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you do realise it. People generally feel toward
me as you feel; it has always been the fashion to tolerate me.
It is a legend that I am thick-skinned and stupidly slow to take
offence. I am not offended now.... Because I could not be with
you.... But I am tired of it, and I thought it better that you
should know it&mdash;after all these years."</p>

<p>Utterly confounded, she leaned back, both hands tightening on
the hand-rail behind her, and as she comprehended the passionless
reproof, a stinging flush deepened over her pretty face.</p>

<p>"Had you anything else to say to me?" he asked, without embarrassment.</p>

<p>"N-no."</p>

<p>"Then may I take my departure?"</p>

<p>She lifted her startled blue eyes and regarded him with a new
and intense curiosity.</p>

<p>"Have I, by my manner or speech, ever really hurt you?" she asked.
"Because I haven't meant to."</p>

<p>He started to reply, hesitated, shook his head, and his pleasant,
kindly smile fascinated her.</p>

<p>"You haven't intended to," he said. "It's all right, Rosalie&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;have I been horrid and disagreeable? Tell me."</p>

<p>In his troubled eyes she could see he was still searching to
excuse her; slowly she began to recognise the sensitive simplicity
of the man, the innate courtesy so out of harmony with her experience
among men. What, after all, was there about him that a woman should
treat with scant consideration, impatience, the toleration of
contempt? His clumsy manner? His awkwardness? His very slowness
to exact anything for himself? Or had it been the half-sneering,
half-humourous attitude of her husband toward him which had insensibly
coloured her attitude?</p>

<p>She had known Delancy Grandcourt all her life&mdash;that is, she had
neglected to know him, if this brief revelation of himself warranted
the curiosity and interest now stirring her.</p>

<p>"Were you really ever in love with me?" she asked, so frankly
that the painful colour rose to his hair again, and he stood silent,
head lowered, like a guilty boy caught in his sins.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;good heavens!" she exclaimed with an uneasy little laugh,
"there's nothing to be ashamed of in it! I'm not laughing at you,
Delancy; I am thinking about it with&mdash;with a certain re&mdash;" She
was going to say regret, but she substituted "respect," and, rather
surprised at her own seriousness, she fell silent, her uncertain
gaze continually reverting to him.</p>

<p>She had never before noticed how tall and well-built he was,
in spite of the awkwardness with which he moved&mdash;a great, big
powerful machine, continually checked and halted, as though by
some fear that his own power might break loose and smash things.
That seemed to be the root of his awkwardness&mdash;unskilful self-control&mdash;a
vague consciousness of the latent strength of limb and body and
will, which habit alone controlled, and controlled unskilfully.</p>

<p>She had never before known a man resembling this new revelation
of Grandcourt. Without considering or understanding why, she began
to experience an agreeable sense of restfulness and security in
the silence which endured between them. He stood full in the sunlight,
very deeply preoccupied with the contents of his fly-book; she
leaned back on the sun-scorched railing of the bridge, bathing-suit
tucked under one arm, listening to the melody of the rushing stream
below. It seemed almost like the intimacy of old friendship, this
quiet interval in the sun, with the moving shadows of leaves at
their feet and the music of the water in their ears&mdash;a silence
unbroken save by that, and the pure, sweet call-note of some woodland
bird from the thickets beyond.</p>

<p>"What fly are you trying?" she asked, dreamily conscious of the
undisturbed accord.</p>

<p>"Wood-ibis&mdash;do you think they might come to it?" he asked so
naturally that a sudden glow of confidence in him, in the sunlit
world around her, warmed her.</p>

<p>"Let me look at your book?"</p>

<p>He brought it. Together they fumbled the brilliantly patterned
aluminum leaves, fumbling with tufted silks and feathers, until
she untangled a most alluringly constructed fly and drew it out,
presenting it to him between forefinger and thumb.</p>

<p>"Shall we try it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said.</p>

<p>Duane, carving hieroglyphics on the bark of the big beech, raised
his head and looked after them.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty low trick," he said to himself, as they sauntered
away toward the Gray Water. And he scowled in silence and continued
his carving.</p>
