<p>Poor Fred Munson struggled with the vigor of desperation to escape
the clutches of the Indian, who swooped down upon him in the fashion
described, but it was in vain; and he scarcely heard the thunder
of the horses' hoofs and saw the figure of the rushing mustang,
when he was snatched up by the muscular and far-reaching Apache,
and borne away amid the shower of bullets, which hurtled as harmlessly
about the red rider and his steed as if the two bore charmed lives.</p>

<p>The daring warrior who performed this remarkable feat had no
sooner secured the boy than he righted himself on the back of
his horse, sitting bolt upright, while, almost at the same instant,
the dead run was toned down to a moderate walk. Turning his head,
the Apache emitted several tantalizing whoops, intended to irritate
the whites into firing.</p>

<p>Although he was within easy rifle-shot, no one essayed to fire,
and he knew none would do so. Not even that skillful marksman,
Sut Simpson, dared make the trial, for the painted body of the
sinewy red-skin was covered by that of the boy, whom he held in
front of him, and he who fired at the wretch was much more likely
to kill the lad so cunningly held in his arms. Thus it was that
the captor made off with his prize, and no one was able to check
him, although the hearts of the whites were burning with rage
and with the desire to shoot the Apache who had baffled them so
utterly.</p>

<p>Fred was still struggling, in the frantic hope of twisting himself
loose from the grasp of the redskin, when the latter spoke in
his harsh, guttural voice:</p>

<p>"Stop, or I'll kill."</p>

<p>This was said in the best of English, and the boy was astonished,
as may well be supposed, at the linguistic accomplishment of the
Indian. At first he imagined that it was a white man painted and
disguised, but one searching glance not only removed that impression,
but revealed the identity of his captor. It was Lone Wolf, whom
he had baffled the night before in the wood.</p>

<p>"It's all up with me now," was the thought of Fred, when this
intelligence flashed upon him. "He will never forgive me for the
way I stopped him last night. How sorry I am that I didn't shoot
him when I had such a good chance!"</p>

<p>For one minute he thought of appealing to his mercy, but a brief
reflection convinced him that that was worse than useless, and
he abandoned the idea as absurd. He was old enough to know that
Indians are merciless.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that night was closing in when Fred was
captured and a few minutes later, when he turned his head back
toward New Boston, he was unable to distinguish a single house.</p>

<p>The mustang bearing captor and prisoner dropped into an easy
gallop, passing entirely out of the valley and a short distance
over the prairie, where, when he halted, he found himself amid
some thirty or forty mounted Apaches. Here a halt was made and
the red-skins engaged in a consultation, which, as a matter of
course, was conducted in their own language, and, consequently,
was unintelligible to the lad, who was as deeply interested as
any of them in the proceedings.</p>

<p>The scene was a strange one, and was so firmly impressed upon
his memory that he was sure he could not forget it if he lived
a hundred years. The Indians he saw now for the first time with
their animals perfectly motionless. They were grouped around their
chief in an irregular circle, and in the gathering darkness, with
their long, coarse, black hair dangling over their shoulders;
their low, scarcely perceptible foreheads; broad, misshapen, painted
faces and their hideous figures, they formed as unearthly a scene
as can be conjured up. Several persisted in talking at the same
moment, and they indulged liberally in gesture, so that it was
very apparent that something exciting was before the convention.</p>

<p>What it was, Fred could not conjecture satisfactorily to himself.
He could not believe that he himself was regarded of sufficient
importance to cause any such discussion, and from what he had
heard of the war-chief, it did not seem probable that he would
allow any such wrangle over a prisoner which he had in his own
possession. It surely was over some other matter, probably concerning
the action of the Apaches, regarding which he had invited discussion;
but whatever it was, Fred could only content himself with looking
and listening.</p>

<p>The lad felt that he was as helpless as an infant, and, now that
he had been given time to collect his senses, he stopped making
any further effort to escape from his captor. Knowing the uncontrollable
temper of the Indians, he resolved not to provoke an outburst
by any action of his own. The wonder with him was, that the chief
did not kill him the minute he found that he was in his power.
They had not shown any desire to make prisoners, when it was so
much more easy to rid themselves of their captives by a blow from
the tomahawk or the thrust of the knife.</p>

<p>"I suppose they mean to do something dreadful with me," was the
thought of Fred, as he shudderingly looked around upon the repulsive
group.</p>

<p>There could be but little doubt of that, and he could do nothing
but ask heaven to protect him in the terrible danger in which
he was placed. At such a time a person's mind is unusually active
and a hundred schemes agitated the mind of the young captive&mdash;schemes
which, when analyzed by the clear light of reason, were about
as unsubstantial as the fabric of a dream. Fred felt that if he
was not killed immediately there was some chance for him. A few
hours, or at least a day or two, would give time for his friends
to do something. Mickey O'Rooney, upon returning to the settlement
(as he would have to do sooner or later), would not consent to
remain there as long as the fate of his young friend was in doubt.
And there was Sut Simpson, the hunter, who had taken so much pains
to come and warn the settlers of the impending attack. He had
witnessed the capture of the lad and was certain to do all he
could to rescue him. His long experience in the west, and his
numerous encounters with these Indians, had given him a knowledge
which would be of great value in such an emergency. Fred recalled
too, that he had heard it stated more than once that the Indians
frequently took prisoners for the purpose of ransom, and that
he might be restored in this manner so soon as communication could
be opened between the Apaches and his friends.</p>

<p>It so happened, therefore, as the minutes passed, that something
like the renewal of hope came to the heart of the lad, who had
reached the conclusion that the subject under discussion did not
relate to himself.</p>

<p>This Apache convention did not prolong its session. Lone Wolf
seemed to permit his warriors to talk until he became weary, when
he said a few words, and the talk ended. During the discussion,
numbers had continued to come in, until there were over a hundred
gathered together. The moon was shining from a clear sky overhead,
and the group gathered on the open prairie, where the members
thereof were in readiness to dash in any direction, in case of
an attack. With the words of Lone Wolf came the adjournment of
the convention. The talk ceased instantly, as if by magic, and
the heads of the horses were turned toward the north.</p>

<p>The Indians were about to leave the neighborhood where they had
been so roughly used by the whites. A number had already gone,
bearing with them the dead and wounded, and the remainder were
about to depart&mdash;that is, for a time, until their forces could
be marshaled into a body that would sweep New Boston from the
face of the earth. Such was the decree of Lone Wolf. Was he to
permit a party of white men to plant a settlement in the very
heart of his country? Was he to allow his hunting grounds to be
appropriated in this fashion? Was he to submit quietly to the
encroachments of those who had never so much as asked his consent?
Not so long as he could summon an army of the best warriors of
the Southwest to his command. If his present company had been
too small, then he would double and treble it. At all events,
the power would be provided to accomplish his purpose.</p>

<p>The horsemen speedily arranged themselves; the head of all turned
in a northerly direction. It took some minutes for them to arrange
themselves, but they were about ready to receive the command of
their chief, when the report of a rifle broke upon the stillness.
An Indian, with a spasmodic shriek, threw up his arms and rolled
backward, and then from his steed, which snorted and reared, as
if it, too, had suffered some injury.</p>

<p>This warrior was directly in the rear of Lone Wolf, and had been
so fairly in line with him that there could be no doubt that the
bullet had really been intended for the chief. The point from
whence it came could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>Over half of the war-party saw the flash of the gun, off to their
right, in the direction of the settlement, and those who chanced
not to see it were quickly informed of the spot by the appearance
of a horse, looking as if he had sprung from the ground itself.
No rider was visible; but, of course, he was there, as he had
just demonstrated by means of his shot. That there might be no
doubt of his identity, he uttered a loud yell, like that with
which one Indian defies another, and called out in the Apache
tongue:</p>

<p>"Sut Simpson sends the shot for the heart of Lone Wolf, who is
a dog and a coward."</p>

<p>This was the favorite taunt of the hunter when he sought to draw
out his old enemy. Some of the numerous scars which he received
were the direct result of his daring defiance, and he was hopeful
that the challenge would accomplish something in the present case.
Nor was he disappointed.</p>
