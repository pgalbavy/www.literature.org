<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Suddenly Red Feather stopped. Melville did the same, wondering
what the cause could be.</p>

<p>The youth stood so near that he saw the chief was looking to
the right, as though he had heard a suspicious sound or saw something
in that direction. The lad gave close attention, since he could
detect nothing.</p>

<p>The Indian resumed his walk more slowly than before, but did
not utter a word. His glances, however, to one side showed he
was not free from misgiving, and by-and-by he stopped walking
and listened intently as before.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Melville, giving way to his curiosity.</p>

<p>"Me hear something," was the reply, the Indian going still slower.</p>

<p>"I can't detect anything," said the lad, as though the fact ought
to lighten the fears of the other.</p>

<p>Red Feather now tenderly placed Dot on her feet. The little one
was half asleep, and rubbed her eyes after the manner of children
when disturbed.</p>

<p>A whispered word from her brother kept her quiet, and, kneeling
down, Red Feather pressed his ear to the ground, holding it there
for a full minute. Then he raised his head a few inches, looked
off into the darkness, placed the side of his face against the
ground for a few seconds more, after which he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>Instead of explaining, he turned to Melville.</p>

<p>"You see Red Feather do&mdash;you do same as him."</p>

<p>Melville promptly obeyed, assuming the same posture that his
friend had taken. Closing his eyes, so as to shut out everything
that might distract his senses, he gave all his efforts to that
of hearing.</p>

<p>Yes, he <em>did</em> hear something&mdash;just the faintest irregular
beating on the ground&mdash;so faint indeed that he would not have
believed it anything except for what the Sioux had said.</p>

<p>"Hear nuffin?" asked the other, as the boy came to his feet.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I did hear a faint noise."</p>

<p>"What him be?"</p>

<p>"That's more than I can tell, Red Feather."</p>

<p>"Hoss&mdash;hear hoss walking&mdash;dat what hear."</p>

<p>"Is that the fact?" asked Melville, somewhat startled, peering
toward the same point of the compass at which the chief had gazed
though the lad had no other idea of the right course.</p>

<p>"Hoss&mdash;he come dis way."</p>

<p>"If that is so there is likely to be someone on him, and I don't
think it is well for us to meet him."</p>

<p>To this wise remark Red Feather gave no answer, but continued
peering in the same direction as before.</p>

<p>"If there is one horseman there is likely to be more&#11834;"</p>

<p>Melville cut short his own words, and whistled cautiously, checking
that with equal suddenness, through fear of offending his friend.</p>

<p>But the chief showed no displeasure, and, before anything could
be said, the form of a riderless horse came out of the gloom and
trotted forward with a faint neigh of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Saladin, my own Saladin!" exclaimed the delighted youth, flinging
his arms around the outstretched neck, and actually touching his
lips to the silken nose of the noble steed.</p>

<p>"Saladin, old fellow, I'm proud of you," said Melville; "the
Sioux did their best to steal you away from us, but you were too
smart for them. One was cruel enough to shoot at you, but it don't
look as if he did any damage."</p>

<p>The youth could not resist the temptation to place his foot in
the stirrup, and leap into the saddle, where he was "at home."</p>

<p>"Now, Red Feather," he added, "things are beginning to look up;
I can relieve you of carrying Dot; the truth is that after we
cross the stream I shall feel safe. Under heaven, we owe everything
to you; but you need go no farther with us."</p>

<p>"Ain't safe," said the chieftain sententiously; "Injins all round
&mdash;Red Feather go all way home wid pappoose."</p>

<p>"That is very kind, but I can relieve you of your burden."</p>

<p>"Me carry pappoose," replied the Sioux, moving toward the little
one.</p>

<p>"Dot," said her brother, "which would you rather do&mdash;ride on
Saladin with me or let Red Feather carry you?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "A riderless horse came out of the gloom."]</p>

<p>"It's a good deal nicer to have him carry me; take me, Red Feather,"
she added, reaching out her arms.</p>

<p>Melville was glad to hear this answer, for he knew it would touch
the chieftain, whose heart had become wrapped up in the sweet
little one.</p>

<p>Before he could lift her, however, he paused, and, saying "Wait,"
again knelt down with his ear to the ground.</p>

<p>The result was satisfactory, and, remarking that he heard nothing
more, he stood upon his feet, stooped over, and lifted the little
one to her old place. Then the flight was taken up as before.</p>

<p>Melville held Saladin back, so as to follow the leader, who reached
the side of the stream a few minutes later. Objects were indistinct,
but the youth was so familiar with the spot that he recognized
it as the Upper Crossing. When the lad would have lost himself
the Sioux had gone as unerringly to the spot as though the sun
were shining overhead to guide him.</p>

<p>"Now," said Melville, as they waited a minute or two on the brink,
"there is no need for you to wade across, and wet your leggings
to the knees; it can be easily fixed."</p>

<p>"Oogh! heap big load for hoss&mdash;carry all."</p>

<p>The lad laughed.</p>

<p>"That isn't what I mean; the pony is strong enough to bear us,
but it isn't necessary; I'll ride him over, and then send him
back after you."</p>

<p>This was a sensible course, for, though an Indian cares little
for the inconvenience of wading through water of considerable
depth, yet he will not do so when there in any practicable means
of avoiding it.</p>

<p>"You must be careful," added Melville, as he was about to ride
into the current, "for there are some deep places which the horse
will have to skirt closely. If he steps into one, he will go over
his depth, and that will make it bad for you and Dot; I think
I had better carry her over with me."</p>

<p>"Oogh! Red Feather know holes, 'cause he fall in 'em&mdash;mebbe you
fall in wid pappoose&mdash;how den, eh?"</p>

<p>"All right," replied the youth with a smile, as he gave the word
to Saladin, who began wading with the same snuffing and care that
his kind always show when entering a body of water.</p>

<p>His rider was wise enough to decide that the safest course was
to leave everything to him, for he had travelled that way often
enough to be familiar with its dangers.</p>

<p>He narrowly missed plunging into a hole near the other bank,
but he saved himself, and finally emerged on the farther shore
with his rider dry-shod.</p>

<p>"Now, old fellow," said Melville, affectionately patting his
head, "go back and bring over Red Feather and Dot. Try not to
come as near making a slip as you did with me."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Go back and bring over Red Feather and Dot."]</p>

<p>The pony showed his comprehension of the request by stepping
at once in the stream and making his way toward the other shore.</p>

<p>Long before the little party reached the stream just crossed
by Melville night had fully come. The moon did not rise until
late in the evening, and the darkness was such that, after parting
with Saladin, he saw him vanish when he was no more than half-way
across the creek. Of course, therefore, Red Feather and Dot were
out of sight altogether.</p>

<p>Melville sat down on the sloping bank, with his rifle across
his knees, to await the coming of his friend. In the stillness,
the slightest sound could be heard a long way. The plashing of
the pony's feet as he carefully felt his way through the water
was so plain that it was easy to tell every step he took.</p>

<p>The youth was looking idly off in the gloom when he observed
a rapidly growing light toward the south-east, which you will
bear in mind was on the other side of the stream. He watched it
for a minute or two, when the cause became apparent.</p>

<p>A couple of miles east of the Clarendon home was that of the
nearest neighbor. He was without any family, his only companion
being a hired man. They had received warning of the impending
danger in time to escape, but being well mounted and armed, took
a different direction from that leading toward Barwell, whither
Mr. Clarendon and his wife hastened.</p>

<p>They were gone, but their property remained. The buildings were
more extensive than those of Mr. Clarendon, and they had been
fired by the Sioux. They created a huge glare which lit up the
horizon in every direction.</p>

<p>"It must be," thought Melville, "that Tall Bear and his warriors
have been scared away by the appearance of white men, and have
touched off those buildings out of revenge. If Red Feather and
I could have only known that friends were coming we could have
stayed at home. I wonder they didn't try to fire that again, now
that they can get inside and have so much better chance."</p>

<p>Melville watched the glare growing brighter and brighter, until
it suddenly occurred to him that Red Feather was a long time in
crossing the stream. The light from the conflagration brought
the opposite shore into faint view, but failed to reveal the Sioux.
While the youth was looking and wondering, however, he heard the
splashing of water and observed Saladin making his way back.</p>

<p>But, instead of doing so at the regular ferry-place, he had gone
some distance above, where the depth was greater. Even while staring
at the pony, the animal sank down so low that it was plain he
was swimming.</p>

<p>This of itself was curious, without the additional fact that
there was no one upon his back; he was returning, as may be said,
empty handed.</p>

<p>As you may well believe, Melville was startled and alarmed; something
unusual must have happened on the other shore. There could be
no doubt that Saladin had gone entirely across, and now came back
without the chief who expected to ride over the ford.</p>

<p>The lad rose and walked down to the edge of the water to meet
his steed. The latter was obliged to swim only a short distance,
when the depth became so shallow that his body rose above the
surface, and he quickly stepped out on dry land.</p>

<p>"What can this mean?" muttered Melville examining the wetted
saddle, bridle, and accoutrements; "were you sent back, Saladin,
or did you come of your own accord? Ah, if you had the gift of
speech!"</p>

<p>It seemed to the lad that he could discern something moving on
the other side, but, with the help of the glare of the distant
fire, he could not make it out.</p>

<p>He ventured to signal to Red Feather by means of the whistle
with which he was accustomed to summon Saladin. The Sioux was
sure to identify it if it reached his ears.</p>

<p>The signal was emitted with such care that it could not have
been heard more than a hundred yards away, and the youth listened
with a rapidly beating heart for the reply.</p>

<p>It came, but in a far different form than was expected or desired.
The sounds showed that other animals had entered the water and
were approaching the opposite bank. At this juncture, too, the
glare from the burning buildings increased to that extent that
the other shore came out more distinctly than ever.</p>

<p>To his dismay Melville observed that the bank was lined with
mounted Indians, three of whom had already ridden into the stream
and were urging their ponies across. They were doing this, too,
with a skill which left no doubt that they knew all about the
holes into which one was likely to plunge.</p>

<p>Where these Sioux&mdash;as they undoubtedly were&mdash;could have come
from with such abruptness was more than the startled lad could
tell, though he naturally supposed they belonged to the party
that had fired the burning buildings. Whether they were members
of Tall Bear's band or an independent body could not be told just
then, and Melville had no time or inclination to puzzle himself
over the question.</p>

<p>It was enough to know that he and his pony were in imminent danger,
and that not a second was to be lost in leaving the spot.</p>

<p>He was in the saddle in a twinkling, and turned the head of Saladin
to the north.</p>

<p>"A good deal depends on <em>you</em>," he said, patting the neck
of the noble animal; "we have a rugged path to travel, and there
isn't much chance to show them what you can do in the way of speed,
but I know they can't beat you."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "To his dismay Melville observed that the bank
was lined with mounted Indians." &mdash;Page 110]</p>

<p>I told you in the earlier part of this story that the upper trail,
as it was called, was much more rugged and difficult to traverse
than the lower one, which fact accounted for its general abandonment
by those who had occasion to cross the stream. Had the ground
for some distance been open prairie, Saladin would have shown
a clean pair of heels to his enemies, and speedily borne his master
beyond danger; but within a hundred yards of the bank of the stream
the surface became so broken that it was difficult for a horse
to travel faster than a walk.</p>

<p>But our young friend did not hesitate to assume the risk, and
Saladin instantly broke into a canter, which, to say the least,
was the equal in speed of any pace his pursuers dare attempt.
The difficulty, however, was that the latter were already so close
that a volley from them could not fail to do damage. The fact
that they had some distance yet to travel through the water, where
their ponies could not be forced off a walk, was a vast help to
Melville, who improved the brief space to that extent that he
was almost out of sight when the horsemen forced their animals
up the bank and struck into a gallop.</p>

<p>Melville rode a reckless gait, which proved to be the wisest
thing he could do; for, though Saladin came near stumbling more
than once, he did not fall, and drew so far away from his pursuers
that he soon left them out of sight. Satisfying himself of this,
the youth abruptly drew him to one side, forced him among some
rocks and bushes, faced about, and held him motionless.</p>

<p>"I don't know what has happened to Red Feather and Dot," he said,
"and it may be they don't need my help; but I shan't do anything
that looks like deserting them&mdash;<em>sh!</em>"</p>

<p>At that moment, the hoofs of the pursuing horses fell on his
ear in his hiding-place, and he knew the three Sioux were at hand.</p>
