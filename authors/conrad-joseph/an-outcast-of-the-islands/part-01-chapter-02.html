<p>The sea, perhaps because of its saltness, roughens the outside
but keeps sweet the kernel of its servants’ soul. The old sea;
the sea of many years ago, whose servants were devoted slaves
and went from youth to age or to a sudden grave without needing
to open the book of life, because they could look at eternity
reflected on the element that gave the life and dealt the death.
Like a beautiful and unscrupulous woman, the sea of the past was
glorious in its smiles, irresistible in its anger, capricious,
enticing, illogical, irresponsible; a thing to love, a thing to
fear. It cast a spell, it gave joy, it lulled gently into boundless
faith; then with quick and causeless anger it killed. But its
cruelty was redeemed by the charm of its inscrutable mystery,
by the immensity of its promise, by the supreme witchery of its
possible favour. Strong men with childlike hearts were faithful
to it, were content to live by its grace&mdash;to die by its will.
That was the sea before the time when the French mind set the
Egyptian muscle in motion and produced a dismal but profitable
ditch. Then a great pall of smoke sent out by countless steam-boats
was spread over the restless mirror of the Infinite. The hand
of the engineer tore down the veil of the terrible beauty in order
that greedy and faithless landlubbers might pocket dividends.
The mystery was destroyed. Like all mysteries, it lived only in
the hearts of its worshippers. The hearts changed; the men changed.
The once loving and devoted servants went out armed with fire
and iron, and conquering the fear of their own hearts became a
calculating crowd of cold and exacting masters. The sea of the
past was an incomparably beautiful mistress, with inscrutable
face, with cruel and promising eyes. The sea of to-day is a used-up
drudge, wrinkled and defaced by the churned-up wakes of brutal
propellers, robbed of the enslaving charm of its vastness, stripped
of its beauty, of its mystery and of its promise.</p>

<p>Tom Lingard was a master, a lover, a servant of the sea. The
sea took him young, fashioned him body and soul; gave him his
fierce aspect, his loud voice, his fearless eyes, his stupidly
guileless heart. Generously it gave him his absurd faith in himself,
his universal love of creation, his wide indulgence, his contemptuous
severity, his straightforward simplicity of motive and honesty
of aim. Having made him what he was, womanlike, the sea served
him humbly and let him bask unharmed in the sunshine of its terribly
uncertain favour. Tom Lingard grew rich on the sea and by the
sea. He loved it with the ardent affection of a lover, he made
light of it with the assurance of perfect mastery, he feared it
with the wise fear of a brave man, and he took liberties with
it as a spoiled child might do with a paternal and good-natured
ogre. He was grateful to it, with the gratitude of an honest heart.
His greatest pride lay in his profound conviction of its faithfulness&mdash;in
the deep sense of his unerring knowledge of its treachery.</p>

<p>The little brig Flash was the instrument of Lingard’s fortune.
They came north together&mdash;both young&mdash;out of an Australian port,
and after a very few years there was not a white man in the islands,
from Palembang to Ternate, from Ombawa to Palawan, that did not
know Captain Tom and his lucky craft. He was liked for his reckless
generosity, for his unswerving honesty, and at first was a little
feared on account of his violent temper. Very soon, however, they
found him out, and the word went round that Captain Tom’s fury
was less dangerous than many a man’s smile. He prospered greatly.
After his first&mdash;and successful&mdash;fight with the sea robbers, when
he rescued, as rumour had it, the yacht of some big wig from home,
somewhere down Carimata way, his great popularity began. As years
went on it grew apace. Always visiting out-of-the-way places of
that part of the world, always in search of new markets for his
cargoes&mdash;not so much for profit as for the pleasure of finding
them&mdash;he soon became known to the Malays, and by his successful
recklessness in several encounters with pirates, established the
terror of his name. Those white men with whom he had business,
and who naturally were on the look-out for his weaknesses, could
easily see that it was enough to give him his Malay title to flatter
him greatly. So when there was anything to be gained by it, and
sometimes out of pure and unprofitable good nature, they would
drop the ceremonious "Captain Lingard" and address him half seriously
as Rajah Laut&mdash;the King of the Sea.</p>

<p>He carried the name bravely on his broad shoulders. He had carried
it many years already when the boy Willems ran barefooted on the
deck of the ship Kosmopoliet <em>IV. </em>in Samarang roads, looking
with innocent eyes on the strange shore and objurgating his immediate
surroundings with blasphemous lips, while his childish brain worked
upon the heroic idea of running away. From the poop of the Flash
Lingard saw in the early morning the Dutch ship get lumberingly
under weigh, bound for the eastern ports. Very late in the evening
of the same day he stood on the quay of the landing canal, ready
to go on board of his brig. The night was starry and clear; the
little custom-house building was shut up, and as the gharry that
brought him down disappeared up the long avenue of dusty trees
leading to the town, Lingard thought himself alone on the quay.
He roused up his sleeping boat-crew and stood waiting for them
to get ready, when he felt a tug at his coat and a thin voice
said, very distinctly&mdash;</p>

<p>"English captain."</p>

<p>Lingard turned round quickly, and what seemed to be a very lean
boy jumped back with commendable activity.</p>

<p>"Who are you? Where do you spring from?" asked Lingard, in startled
surprise.</p>

<p>From a safe distance the boy pointed toward a cargo lighter moored
to the quay.</p>

<p>"Been hiding there, have you?" said Lingard. "Well, what do you
want? Speak out, confound you. You did not come here to scare
me to death, for fun, did you?"</p>

<p>The boy tried to explain in imperfect English, but very soon
Lingard interrupted him.</p>

<p>"I see," he exclaimed, "you ran away from the big ship that sailed
this morning. Well, why don’t you go to your countrymen here?"</p>

<p>"Ship gone only a little way&mdash;to Sourabaya. Make me go back to
the ship," explained the boy.</p>

<p>"Best thing for you," affirmed Lingard with conviction.</p>

<p>"No," retorted the boy; "me want stop here; not want go home.
Get money here; home no good."</p>

<p>"This beats all my going a-fishing," commented the astonished
Lingard. "It’s money you want? Well! well! And you were not afraid
to run away, you bag of bones, you!"</p>

<p>The boy intimated that he was frightened of nothing but of being
sent back to the ship. Lingard looked at him in meditative silence.</p>

<p>"Come closer," he said at last. He took the boy by the chin,
and turning up his face gave him a searching look. "How old are
you?"</p>

<p>"Seventeen."</p>

<p>"There’s not much of you for seventeen. Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"Will you come with me, in that brig there?"</p>

<p>The boy moved without a word towards the boat and scrambled into
the bows.</p>

<p>"Knows his place," muttered Lingard to himself as he stepped
heavily into the stern sheets and took up the yoke lines. "Give
way there."</p>

<p>The Malay boat crew lay back together, and the gig sprang away
from the quay heading towards the brig’s riding light.</p>

<p>Such was the beginning of Willems’ career.</p>

<p>Lingard learned in half an hour all that there was of Willems’
commonplace story. Father outdoor clerk of some ship-broker in
Rotterdam; mother dead. The boy quick in learning, but idle in
school. The straitened circumstances in the house filled with
small brothers and sisters, sufficiently clothed and fed but otherwise
running wild, while the disconsolate widower tramped about all
day in a shabby overcoat and imperfect boots on the muddy quays,
and in the evening piloted wearily the half-intoxicated foreign
skippers amongst the places of cheap delights, returning home
late, sick with too much smoking and drinking&mdash;for company’s sake&mdash;with
these men, who expected such attentions in the way of business.
Then the offer of the good-natured captain of Kosmopoliet <em>IV.,
</em>who was pleased to do something for the patient and obliging
fellow; young Willems’ great joy, his still greater disappointment
with the sea that looked so charming from afar, but proved so
hard and exacting on closer acquaintance&mdash;and then this running
away by a sudden impulse. The boy was hopelessly at variance with
the spirit of the sea. He had an instinctive contempt for the
honest simplicity of that work which led to nothing he cared for.
Lingard soon found this out. He offered to send him home in an
English ship, but the boy begged hard to be permitted to remain.
He wrote a beautiful hand, became soon perfect in English, was
quick at figures; and Lingard made him useful in that way. As
he grew older his trading instincts developed themselves astonishingly,
and Lingard left him often to trade in one island or another while
he, himself, made an intermediate trip to some out-of-the-way
place. On Willems expressing a wish to that effect, Lingard let
him enter Hudig’s service. He felt a little sore at that abandonment
because he had attached himself, in a way, to his protege. Still
he was proud of him, and spoke up for him loyally. At first it
was, "Smart boy that&mdash;never make a seaman though."  Then when
Willems was helping in the trading he referred to him as "that
clever young fellow." Later when Willems became the confidential
agent of Hudig, employed in many a delicate affair, the simple-hearted
old seaman would point an admiring finger at his back and whisper
to whoever stood near at the moment, "Long-headed chap that; deuced
long-headed chap. Look at him. Confidential man of old Hudig.
I picked him up in a ditch, you may say, like a starved cat. Skin
and bone. ‘Pon my word I did. And now he knows more than I do
about island trading. Fact. I am not joking. More than I do,"
he would repeat, seriously, with innocent pride in his honest
eyes.</p>

<p>From the safe elevation of his commercial successes Willems patronized
Lingard. He had a liking for his benefactor, not unmixed with
some disdain for the crude directness of the old fellow’s methods
of conduct. There were, however, certain sides of Lingard’s character
for which Willems felt a qualified respect. The talkative seaman
knew how to be silent on certain matters that to Willems were
very interesting. Besides, Lingard was rich, and that in itself
was enough to compel Willems’ unwilling admiration. In his confidential
chats with Hudig, Willems generally alluded to the benevolent
Englishman as the "lucky old fool" in a very distinct tone of
vexation; Hudig would grunt an unqualified assent, and then the
two would look at each other in a sudden immobility of pupils
fixed by a stare of unexpressed thought.</p>

<p>"You can’t find out where he gets all that india-rubber, hey
Willems?"  Hudig would ask at last, turning away and bending over
the papers on his desk.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Hudig. Not yet. But I am trying," was Willems’ invariable
reply, delivered with a ring of regretful deprecation.</p>

<p>"Try! Always try! You may try! You think yourself clever perhaps," 
rumbled on Hudig, without looking up. "I have been trading with
him twenty&mdash;thirty years now. The old fox. And I have tried. Bah!"</p>

<p>He stretched out a short, podgy leg and contemplated the bare
instep and the grass slipper hanging by the toes. "You can’t make
him drunk?" he would add, after a pause of stertorous breathing.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Hudig, I can’t really," protested Willems, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Well, don’t try. I know him. Don’t try," advised the master,
and, bending again over his desk, his staring bloodshot eyes close
to the paper, he would go on tracing laboriously with his thick
fingers the slim unsteady letters of his correspondence, while
Willems waited respectfully for his further good pleasure before
asking, with great deference&mdash;</p>

<p>"Any orders, Mr. Hudig?"</p>

<p>"Hm! yes. Go to Bun-Hin yourself and see the dollars of that
payment counted and packed, and have them put on board the mail-boat
for Ternate. She’s due here this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Hudig."</p>

<p>"And, look here. If the boat is late, leave the case in Bun-Hin’s
godown till to-morrow. Seal it up. Eight seals as usual. Don’t
take it away till the boat is here."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Hudig."</p>

<p>"And don’t forget about these opium cases. It’s for to-night.
Use my own boatmen. Transship them from the Caroline to the Arab
barque," went on the master in his hoarse undertone. "And don’t
you come to me with another story of a case dropped overboard
like last time," he added, with sudden ferocity, looking up at
his confidential clerk.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Hudig. I will take care."</p>

<p>"That’s all. Tell that pig as you go out that if he doesn’t make
the punkah go a little better I will break every bone in his body,"
finished up Hudig, wiping his purple face with a red silk handkerchief
nearly as big as a counterpane.</p>

<p>Noiselessly Willems went out, shutting carefully behind him the
little green door through which he passed to the warehouse. Hudig,
pen in hand, listened to him bullying the punkah boy with profane
violence, born of unbounded zeal for the master’s comfort, before
he returned to his writing amid the rustling of papers fluttering
in the wind sent down by the punkah that waved in wide sweeps
above his head.</p>

<p>Willems would nod familiarly to Mr. Vinck, who had his desk close
to the little door of the private office, and march down the warehouse
with an important air. Mr. Vinck&mdash;extreme dislike lurking in every
wrinkle of his gentlemanly countenance&mdash;would follow with his
eyes the white figure flitting in the gloom amongst the piles
of bales and cases till it passed out through the big archway
into the glare of the street.</p>
