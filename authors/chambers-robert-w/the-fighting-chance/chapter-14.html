<p>If a man's grief does not awaken his dignity, then he has none.
In that event, grief is not even respectable. And so it was with
Leroy Mortimer when Lydia at last turned on him. If you caress
an Angora too long and too persistently it runs away. And before
it goes it scratches.</p>

<p>Under all the physical degeneration of mind and flesh there had
still remained in Mortimer the capacity for animal affection;
and that does not mean sensuality alone, but generosity and a
sort of routine devotion as characteristic components of a character
which had now disintegrated into the simplest and most primitive
elements.</p>

<p>Lydia Vyse left Saratoga when the financial stringency began
to make it unpleasant for her to remain. She told Mortimer without
the slightest compunction that she was going.</p>

<p>He did not believe her and he gave her the new car&mdash;the big yellow-and-black
Serin-Chanteur. She sold it the same day to a bookmaker&mdash;an old
friend of hers; withdrew several jewels from limbo&mdash;gems which
Mortimer had given her&mdash;and gathered together everything for which,
if he turned ugly, she might not be criminally liable.</p>

<p>She had never liked him&mdash;she had long disliked him. Such women
have an instinct for their own kind, and no matter how low in
the scale a man of the other kind sinks he can never entirely
supply the type of running mate that such women require, understand,
and usually conceive a passion for.</p>

<p>Not liking him she had no hesitation in the matter; disliking
him, whatever unpleasant had occurred during their companionship
remained as an irritant to poison memory. She resented a thousand
little incidents that he scarcely knew had ever existed, but which
she treasured without wasting emotion until the sum total and
the time coincided to retaliate. Not that she would have cared
to harm him seriously; she was willing enough to disoblige him,
however&mdash;decorate him, before she left him, with one extra scratch
for the sake of auld lang syne. So she wrote a note to the governors
of the Patroons Club, saying that both Quarrier and Mortimer were
aware that the guilt of her escapade could not be attached to
Siward; that she knew nothing of Siward, had accepted his wager
without meaning to attempt to win it, had never again seen him,
and had, on the impulse of the moment, made her entry in the wake
of several men. She added that when Quarrier, as governor, had
concurred in Siward's expulsion he knew perfectly well that Siward
was not guilty, because she herself had so informed Quarrier.
Since then she had also told Mortimer, but he had taken no steps
to do justice to Siward, although he, Mortimer, was still a governor
of the Patroons Club.</p>

<p>This being about all she could think of to make mischief for
two men whose recent companionship had nourished and irritated
her, she shipped her trunks by express, packed her jewel-case
and valise, and met Desmond at the station.</p>

<p>Desmond had business in Europe; Lydia had as much business there
as anywhere; and, although she had been faithless to Mortimer
for a comparatively short time, within that time Desmond already
had sworn at her and struck her. So she was quite ready to follow
Desmond anywhere in this world or the next. And that, too, had
not made her the more considerate toward Mortimer.</p>

<p>When the latter returned from the races to find her gone the
last riddled props to what passed for his manhood gave way and
the rotten fabric came crashing into the mud.</p>

<p>He had loved her as far as he had been capable of imitating that
passion on the transposed plane to which he had fallen; he was
stupefied at first, then grew violent with the furniture, then
hysterically profane, then pitiable in the abandoned degradation
of his grief. And, suspecting Desmond, he started to find him.
They put him out of Desmond's club-house when he became noisy;
they refused him admittance to several similar resorts where his
noise threatened to continue; his landlord lost no time in interviewing
him upon the subject of damage to furniture from kicks and to
the walls and carpets from the contents of smashed bottles.</p>

<p>Creditors with sharp noses scented the whirlwind afar off and
hemmed him in with unsettled accounts, mostly hers. Somebody placed
a lien on his horses; a deputy sheriff began to follow him about;
all credit ceased as by magic, and men crossed the street to avoid
meeting with an old companion in direst need.</p>

<p>Still, alternately stupefied by his own grief and maddened into
the necessity for action, he packed a suitcase, crawled out of
the rear door, toiled across country and found a farmer to drive
him twenty miles over a sandy road to a local railroad crossing,
where he managed to board a train for Albany.</p>

<p>At Albany, as he stood panting and sweating on the long, concrete
platform which paralleled track No. 1, he saw a private car, switched
from a Boston and Albany train, shunted to the rear of the Merchants'
Express.</p>

<p>The private car was lettered in gold on the central panel, "Algonquin." 
He boarded the Pullman coupled to it forward, pushed through the
vestibule, shoved aside the Japanese steward and darky cook, forcing
his way straight into the private car. Quarrier, reading a magazine,
looked up at him in astonishment. For a full moment neither spoke.
Then Mortimer dropped his suit-case, sat down in an armchair opposite
Quarrier, and leisurely mopped his reeking face and neck.</p>

<p>"Scotch and lithia!" he said hoarsely; the Japanese steward looked
at Quarrier; then, at that gentleman's almost imperceptible nod,
went away to execute the commission.</p>

<p>He executed a great many similar commissions during the trip
to New York. When they arrived there at five o'clock, Quarrier
offered Mortimer his hand, and held the trembling, puffy fingers
as he leaned closer, saying with cold precision and emotionless
emphasis something that appeared to require the full concentration
of Mortimer's half-drugged faculties.</p>

<p>And when at length Mortimer drove away in a hansom, Quarrier's
Japanese steward went with him&mdash;perhaps to carry his suit case&mdash;a
courtesy that did credit to Quarrier's innate thoughtfulness and
consideration for others. He was very considerate; he even called
Agatha up on the telephone and talked with her for ten minutes.
Then he telephoned to Plank's office, learned that Harrington
was already there, telephoned the garage for a Mercedes which
he always kept ready in town, and presently went bowling away
to a conference on which the last few hours had put an entirely
new aspect.</p>

<p>It had taken Plank only a few minutes to perceive that something
had occurred to change a point of view which he had believed it
impossible for Quarrier to change. Something had gone wrong in
his own careful calculations; some cog had slipped, some rivet
given way, some bed-plate cracked. And Harrington evidently had
not been aware of it; but Quarrier knew it. There was something
wrong.</p>

<p>It was too late now to go tinkering in the dark for trouble.
Plank understood that. Coolly, as though utterly unaware that
the machinery might not stand the strain, he started it full speed.
And when he stopped it at last Harrington's grist had been ground
to atoms, and Quarrier had looked on without comment. There seemed
to be little more for them to do except to pay the miller.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said Quarrier, rising to go. It was on the edge
of Plank's lips to say, "to-day!"&mdash;but he was silent, knowing
that Harrington would speak for him. And the old man did, without
words, turning his iron visage on Quarrier with the silent dignity
of despair. But Quarrier coldly demanded a day before they reckoned
with Plank. And Plank, profoundly disturbed, shrugged his massive
shoulders in contemptuous assent.</p>

<p>So Quarrier and Harrington went away&mdash;the younger partner taking
leave of the older with a sneer for an outworn prop which no man
could ever again have use for. Old and beaten&mdash;that was all Harrington
now stood for in Quarrier's eyes. Never a thought of the past
undaunted courage, never a memory of the old victories which had
made the Quarrier fortune possible&mdash;only contempt for age, a sneer
for the mind and body that had failed at last. The old robber
was done for, his armour rotten, his buckler broken, his sword
blade rusted to the core. The least of his victims might now finish
him with a club where he swayed in his loosened saddle, or leave
him to that horseman on the pale horse watching him yonder on
the horizon.</p>

<p>For now, whether Harrington lived or died, he must be counted
as nothing in this new struggle darkly outlining its initial strategy
in Quarrier's brain. What was coming was coming between himself
and Plank alone; and whatever the result&mdash;whether an armed truce
leaving affairs indefinitely in statu quo, or the other alternative,
an alliance with Plank, leaving Harrington like a king in his
mail, propped upon his throne, dead eyes doubly darkened under
the closed helmet&mdash;the result must be attained swiftly, with secrecy,
and with the aid of no man. For he did not count Mortimer a man.</p>

<p>So Quarrier's thin lips twitched and the glimmer of teeth showed
under the silky beard as he listened without comment to the old
man's hesitating words&mdash;a tremulous suggestion for a conference
that evening&mdash;and he said again, "to-morrow," and left him there
alone, groping with uncertain hands toward the door of the hired
coupé which had brought him to the place of his earthly downfall;
the place where he had met his own weird face to face&mdash;the wraith
that bore the mask of Plank.</p>

<p>Quarrier, brooding sullenly in his Mercedes, was already far
up town on his way to Major Belwether's house.</p>

<p>At the door, Sylvia's maid received him smilingly, saying that
her mistress was not at home but that Mrs. Mortimer was&mdash;which
saved Quarrier the necessity of asking for the private conference
with Leila which was exactly what he had come for. But her first
unguarded words on receiving him as he rose at her entrance into
the darkened drawing-room changed that plan, too&mdash;changed it all
so utterly, and so much for the better, that he almost smiled
to think of the crudity of human combinations and inventions as
compared to the masterly machinations of Fate. No need for him
to complicate matters when here were pawns enough to play the
game for him. No need for him to do anything except give them
their initial velocity and let them tumble into one another and
totter or fall. Leila said, laughingly: "Oh, you are too late,
Howard. We are dining with Mr. Plank at Riverside Inn. What in
the world are you doing in town so suddenly?"</p>

<p>"A business telegram. I might have come down with you and Sylvia
if I had known. … Is Plank dining with you alone?"</p>

<p>"I haven't seen him," smiled Leila evasively. "He will tell us
his plans of course when he comes."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Quarrier, dropping his eyes and glancing furtively
toward the curtained windows through which he could see the street
and his Mercedes waiting at the curb. At the same instant a hansom
drove up; Sylvia sprang out, ran lightly up the low steps, and
the silent, shrouded house rang with the clamour of the bell.</p>

<p>Leila looked curiously at Quarrier, who sat motionless, head
partly averted, as though listening to something heard by him
alone. He believed perhaps that he was listening to the voice
of Fate again, and it may have been so, for already, for the third
time, all his plans were changing to suit this new ally of his&mdash;this
miraculous Fate which was shaping matters for him as he waited.
Sylvia had started up-stairs like a fragrant whirlwind, but her
flying feet halted at Leila's constrained voice from the drawing-room,
and she spun around and came into the darkened room like an April
breeze.</p>

<p>"Leila! They'll be here at a quarter to seven&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her breath seemed to leave her body as a shadowy figure rose
in the uncertain light and confronted her.</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>He said: "Didn't you recognise the Mercedes outside?"</p>

<p>She had not even seen it, so excited, so deeply engaged had she
been with the riotous tumult of her own thoughts. And still her
hurt, unbelieving gaze widened to dismay as she stood there halted
on the threshold; and still his eyes, narrowing, held her under
their expressionless inspection.</p>

<p>"When did you come? Why?" she asked in an altered voice.</p>

<p>"I came on business. Naturally, being here, I came to see you.
I understand you are dining out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are dining out."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I didn't wire you because we might have dined together.
I saw Plank this afternoon. He did not say you were to dine with
him. Shall I see you later in the evening, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>it will be too late&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! To-morrow then. What train do you take?"</p>

<p>Sylvia did not answer; he picked up his hat, repeating the question
carelessly, and still she made no reply.</p>

<p>"Shall I see you to-morrow?" he asked, swinging on her rather
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;not. <em>I&mdash;</em>there will be no time&mdash;"</p>

<p>He bowed quietly to Leila, offering his hand. "Who did you say
was to dine with you&mdash;besides Plank?"</p>

<p>Leila stood silent, then, withdrawing her fingers, walked to
the window.</p>

<p>Quarrier, his hat in his gloved hands, looked from one to the
other, his inquiring eyes returning and focused on Sylvia.</p>

<p>"Who are you dining with?" he asked with authority.</p>

<p>"Mr. Plank and Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward!" he repeated in surprised displeasure, as though
he had not already divined it.</p>

<p>"Yes. A man I like."</p>

<p>"A man I dislike," he rejoined with the slightest emphasis.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she said simply.</p>

<p>"So am I, Sylvia. And I am going to ask you to make him an excuse.
Any excuse will do."</p>

<p>"Excuse? What do you mean, Howard?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I do not care to have you seen with Mr. Siward.
Have I ever demanded very much of you, Sylvia? Very well; I demand
this of you now."</p>

<p>And still she stood there, her eyes wide, her colour gone, repeating:
"Excuse? What excuse? What do you mean by 'excuse,' Howard?"</p>

<p>"I have told you. You know my wishes. If he has a telephone you
can communicate with him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And say that <em>I&mdash;</em>that you forbid me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you choose. Yes; say that I object to him. Is there anything
extraordinary in a man objecting to his future wife dining in
the country at a common inn with a notorious outcast from every
decent club and circle in New York?"</p>

<p>"What!" she whispered, white as death. "What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Shall I repeat what everybody except you seems to be aware of?
Do you care to have me explain to you exactly why decent people
have ostracised this man with whom you are proposing to figure
in a public resort?"</p>

<p>He turned to Leila, who stood at the window, her back turned
toward them: "Mrs. Mortimer, when Mr. Plank arrives, you will
be kind enough to explain why Sylvia is unable to accompany you."</p>

<p>If Leila heard she neither turned nor made sign of comprehension.</p>

<p>"We will dine at the Santa Regina," he said to Sylvia. "Agatha
is there and I'll find somebody at the club to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why bother to find anybody?" said Leila, wheeling on him, exasperated.
"Why not dine there with Agatha alone? It will not be the first
time I fancy!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he said fiercely, under his breath. The colour
had left his face, too, and in his eyes Leila saw for the first
time an expression that she had never before surprised in any
eyes except her husband's. It was the expression of fright; she
recognised it. But Sylvia stared, unenlightened, at an altered
visage she scarcely knew for Quarrier's.</p>

<p>"What do I mean?" repeated Leila; "I mean what I say; and if
you don't understand it you can find the key to it, I fancy. Nor
shall I answer to you for my guests. I invite whom I choose. Mr.
Siward is one, Mr. Plank is another. Sylvia, if you care to come
I shall be delighted."</p>

<p>"I do care to come," said Sylvia. Her heart was beating violently,
her eyes were on Quarrier.</p>

<p>"If you go," said Quarrier, showing the glimmering edge of teeth
under his beard, "you will answer to me for it."</p>

<p>"I will answer you now, Howard; I am going with Mrs. Mortimer.
What have you to say?"</p>

<p>"I'll say it to-morrow," he replied, contemplating her in a dull,
impassive manner as though absorbed in other things.</p>

<p>"Say what there is to be said now!" she insisted, the hot colour
staining her cheeks again. "Do you desire me to free you? Is that
all? I will if you wish."</p>

<p>"No. And I shall not free you, Sylvia. This&mdash;all this can be
adjusted in time."</p>

<p>"As you please," she said slowly.</p>

<p>"In time," he repeated, his passionless voice now under perfect
control. He turned and looked at Leila; all the wickedness of
his anger was concentrated in his gaze. Then he took his leave
of them as formally, as precisely as though he had forgotten the
whole scene; and a minute later the big Mercedes ran out into
a half-circle, backed, wheeled, and rolled away through the thickening
dusk, the glare of the acetylenes sweeping the deserted street.</p>

<p>Into the twilight sped Quarrier, head bent, but his soft, dark-lashed
eyes of a woman fixed steadily ahead. Every energy, every thought
was now bent to this newest phase of the same question which he
and Fate were finding simpler to solve every minute. Of all the
luxuries he permitted himself openly or furtively, one&mdash;the rarest
of them all&mdash;his self-denial had practically eliminated from the
list: the luxury of punishing where no end was served save that
of mere personal satisfaction. The temptation of this luxury now
presented itself; and the means of gratification were so simple,
so secret, so easy to command, that the temptation became almost
a duty.</p>

<p>Siward he had not turned out of his way to injure; Siward had
been in the way, that was all, and his ruin was to have been merely
an agreeable coincidence with the purposed ruin of Amalgamated
Electric before Inter-County absorbed the fragments. But here
was a new phase; Mrs. Mortimer, whom he had expected to use, and
if necessary sacrifice, had suddenly turned vicious. And he now
hated her as coldly as he hated Major Belwether for betraying
suspicions of a similar nature. As for Plank, fear and hatred
of him was becoming hatred and contempt. He had the means of checking
Plank if Mortimer did not drop dead before midnight. There remained
Sylvia, whom he had selected as the fittest object attainable
to transmit his name. Long ago, whatever of liking, of affection,
of passion he had ever entertained for her had quieted to indifference
and the unemotional contemplation of a future methodically arranged
for. Now of a sudden, this young girl he had bought&mdash;he knowing
what she sold and what he was paying for&mdash;had become exposed to
the infection of a suspicion concerning himself and another woman;
a woman unmarried, and of his own caste, and numbered among her
own friends.</p>

<p>And he knew enough of Sylvia to know that if anybody could once
arouse her suspicion nothing on earth could induce her to look
into his face again. Suppose Leila should do so this evening?</p>

<p>Certainly Quarrier had several matters to ponder over and provide
for; and first and foremost of all to provide for his own security
and the vital necessity of preserving his name and his character
untainted. In this he had to deal with that miserable judge who
had betrayed him; with Mortimer, who had once black-mailed him
and who now was temporarily in his service; with Mrs. Mortimer,
who &mdash;God knew how, when, or where&mdash;had become suspicious
of Agatha and himself; with Major Belwether, who had deserted
him before he could sacrifice the major, and whom he now hated
and feared for having stumbled over suspicions similar to Mrs.
Mortimer's. He had to deal with Sylvia herself, and with Siward&mdash;reckon
with Siward's knowledge of matters which it were best that Sylvia
should not know.</p>

<p>But first of all, and most important of all, he had to deal with
Beverly Plank. And he was going to do it in a manner that Plank
could not have foreseen; he was going to stop Plank where he stood,
and to do this he was deliberately using his knowledge of the
man and paying Plank the compliment of counting on his sense of
honour to defeat him.</p>

<p>For he had suddenly found the opportunity to defend himself;
he had discovered the joint in Plank's old-fashioned armour&mdash;the
armour of the old paladins&mdash;who placed a woman's honour before
all else in the world. Now, through his creature, Mortimer, he
could menace Plank with a threat to involve him and Leila in a
vile publicity; now he was in a position to demand a hearing and
a compromise through his new ambassador, Mortimer, knowing that
he could at last halt Plank by threatening Leila with this shameful
danger. Plank must sign the truce or face with Leila an action
for damages and divorce.</p>

<p>First of all he went to the Lenox Club and dressed. Then he dined
sparingly and alone. The Mercedes was waiting when he came out
ready to run down to the great Hotel Corona, whither the Japanese
steward had conducted Mortimer. Mortimer had dined heavily, but
his disorganised physical condition was such that it had scarcely
affected him at all.</p>

<p>Again Quarrier went over patiently and carefully the very simple
part he had reserved for Mortimer that evening, explaining exactly
what to say to Leila and what to say to Plank in case of insolent
interruption. Then he told Mortimer to be ready at nine o'clock,
turned on his heel with a curt word to the Japanese, descended
to the street, entered his motor-car again, and sped away to the
Hotel Santa Regina.</p>

<p>Miss Caithness was at home, came the message in exchange for
his cards for Agatha and Mrs. Vendenning. He entered the gilded
elevator, stepped out on the sixth floor into a tiny, rococo,
public reception-room. Nobody was there besides himself; Agatha's
maid came presently, and he turned and followed her into the large
and very handsome parlour belonging to the suite which Agatha
was occupying with Mrs. Vendenning for the few days that they
were to stop in town.</p>

<p>"Hello," she said serenely, sauntering in, her long, pale hands
bracketed on her narrow hips, her lips disclosing her teeth in
a smile so like that nervous muscular recession which passed for
a smile on Quarrier's visage that for one moment he recognised
it and thought she was mocking him. But she strolled up to him,
meeting his eye calmly, and lifted her slim neck, lips passive
under his impetuous kiss.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Vendenning out?" he asked, laying his hands on the bare
shoulders of the tall, pallid girl&mdash;tall as he, and as pallid.</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Ven. is in, Howard."</p>

<p>"Now? You mean she is coming in to interrupt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no; she isn't fond of you, Howard."</p>

<p>"You said&mdash;" he began almost angrily, but she laid her fingers
across his lips.</p>

<p>"I said a very foolish thing, Howard. I said that I'd manage
to dispense with Mrs. Ven. this evening."</p>

<p>"You mean that you couldn't manage it?"</p>

<p>"Not at all; I could easily have managed it. But &mdash;I didn't
care to."</p>

<p>She looked at him calmly at close range as he held her embraced,
lifted her arms and, with slender, white fingers patted her hair
into place where his arm around her head had disarranged it, watching
him all the while out of her pale, haunted eyes.</p>

<p>"You promised me," he said, "that you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh Howard! Do men still believe in promises?"</p>

<p>Quarrier's face had colour enough now; his voice, too, had lost
its passionless, monotonous precision. Whatever was in the man
of emotion was astir; his impatient voice, his lack of poise,
the almost human lack of caution in his speech betrayed him in
a new and interesting light.</p>

<p>"Look here, Agatha, how long is this going to last? Are you trying
to make a fool of me? What is the matter? Is there anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"Wrong? Oh dear no! How could there be anything wrong between
you and me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Agatha, what is the matter! Look here; let's settle this thing
now and settle it one way or the other! I won't stand it; I &mdash;I
can't!"</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, releasing herself from his tightening
arms and stepping back with another glance at the mirror and another
light touch of her finger-tips on her burnished hair. "Very well,"
she repeated, gazing again into the mirror; "what am I to understand,
Howard?"</p>

<p>"You know what to understand," he said in a low voice; "you know
what we both understood when&mdash;when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When what?"</p>

<p>"When <em>I&mdash;</em>when you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh what, Howard?" she prompted indolently; and he answered in
brutal exasperation, and for the first time so plainly that a
hint of rose tinted her strange, pale beauty and between her lips
the breath came less regularly as she stood there looking at the
dull, silvery rug under her feet.</p>

<p>"Did you ever misunderstand me?" he demanded hotly. "Did I give
you any chance to? Were you ignorant of what that meant," with
a gesture toward the splendid crescent of flashing gems, scintillating
where the low, lace bodice met the silky lustre of her skin. "Did
you misinterpret the collar? Or the sudden change of fortune in
your own family's concerns? Answer me, Agatha, once for all. But
you need not answer after all: I know you have never misunderstood
me!"</p>

<p>"I misunderstood nothing," she said; "you are quite right."</p>

<p>"Then what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Do?" she asked in slow surprise. "What am I to do, Howard?"</p>

<p>"You have said that you loved me."</p>

<p>"I said the truth, I think."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"How long are you going to keep me at arm's length?" he asked
violently.</p>

<p>"That lies with you," she said, smiling. She looked at him for
a moment, then, resting her hands on her hips, she began to pace
the floor, to and fro, to and fro, and at every turn she raised
her head to look at him. All the strange grace of her became insolent
provocation&mdash;her pale eyes, clear, limpid, harbouring no delusions,
haunted with the mockery of wisdom, challenged and checked him.
"Howard," she said, "why should I be the fool you want me to be
because I love you? Why should I be even if I wished to be? You
desire an understanding? Voilà! You have it. I love you; I never
misunderstood you from the first; I could not afford to. You know
what I am; you know what you arouse in me?"</p>

<p>Slim, pale, depraved in all but body she stood, eyeing him a
moment, the very incarnation of vicious perversity.</p>

<p>"You know what you arouse in me," she repeated. "But don't count
on it!"</p>

<p>"You have encouraged&mdash;permitted me to count&mdash;" His anger choked
him&mdash;or was it the haunting wisdom of her eyes that committed
him to silence.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, musingly, "what it is in you that I
am so mad about&mdash;whether it is your brutality, or the utter corruption
of you that holds me, or your wicked eyes of a woman, or the fascination
of the mask you turn on the world, and the secret visage, naked
in its vice, that you reserve for me. But I love you&mdash;in my own
fashion. Count on that, Howard; for that is all you can surely
count on. And now, at last, you know."</p>

<p>As he stood there, it came to him slowly that, deep within him
he had always known this; that he had never really counted on
anything else though he had throttled his doubts by covering her
throat with diamonds. Her strangeness, her pallor, her acquiescence,
the delicate hint of depravity in her, the subtle response to
all that was worst in him had attracted him, only to learn, little
by little, that the taint of corruption was only a taint infecting
others, not her; that the promise of evil was only a promise;
that he had to deal with a young body but an old intelligence,
and a mind so old that at moments her faded gaze almost appalled
him with its indolent clairvoyance.</p>

<p>Long since he knew, too, that in all the world he could never
again find such a mate for him. This had, unadmitted even to himself,
always remained a hidden secret within this secret man&mdash;an unacknowledged,
undrawn-on reserve in case of the failure which he, even in sanguine
moods, knew in his inmost corrupted soul that his quest was doomed
to.</p>

<p>And now he had no more need of secrets from himself; now, turning
his gaze inward, he looked upon all with which he had chosen to
deceive himself. And there was nothing left for self-deception.</p>

<p>"If I marry you!" he said calmly "at least I know what I am getting."</p>

<p>"I will marry you, Howard. I've got to marry somebody pretty
soon. You or Captain Voucher."</p>

<p>For an instant a vicious light flashed in his narrowing eyes.
She saw it and shook her head with weary cynicism:</p>

<p>"No, not that. It could not attract me even with you. It is really
vulgar&mdash;that arrangement. Noblesse oblige, mon ami. There is a
depravity in marrying you that makes all lesser vices stale as
virtues."</p>

<p>He said nothing; she looked at him, lazily amused; then, inattentive,
turned and paced the floor again.</p>

<p>"Shall I see you to-morrow?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"If you wish. Captain Voucher came down on the same train with
me. I'll set him adrift if you like."</p>

<p>"Is he preparing for a declaration?" sneered Quarrier.</p>

<p>"I think so," she said simply.</p>

<p>"Well if he comes to-night after I'm gone, you wait a final word
from me. Do you understand?" he repeated with repressed violence.</p>

<p>"No, Howard. Are you going to propose to me to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"You'll know to-morrow," he retorted angrily. "I tell you to
wait. I've a right to that much consideration anyway."</p>

<p>"Very well, Howard," she said, recognising in him the cowardice
which she had always suspected to be there.</p>

<p>She bade him good night; he touched her hand but made no offer
to kiss her. She laughed a little to herself, watching him striding
toward the elevator, then, closing the door, she stood still in
the centre of the room, staring at her own reflection, full length,
in the gilded pier-glass, her lips edged with a sneer so like
Quarrier's that, the next moment she laughed aloud, imitating
Quarrier's rare laugh from sheer perversity.</p>

<p>"I think," she said to her reflected figure in the glass, "I
think that you are either mentally ill or inherently a kind of
devil. And I don't much care which."</p>

<p>And she turned leisurely, her slim hands balanced lightly on
her narrow hips, and strolled into the second dressing-room, where
Mrs. Vendenning sat sullenly indulging in that particular species
of solitaire known as "The Idiot's Delight."</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired Mrs. Vendenning, looking up at the tall, pale
girl she was chaperoning so carefully during their sojourn in
town.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know the rhyme to that," yawned Agatha; "let's ring
up somebody. I'm bored stiff."</p>

<p>"What did Howard Quarrier want?"</p>

<p>"He knows, I think, but he hasn't yet informed me."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you one thing, Agatha," said Mrs. Vendenning, gathering
up the packs for a new shuffle: "Grace Ferrall doesn't fancy Howard's
attention to you and she's beginning to say so. When you go back
to Shotover you'd better let him alone."</p>

<p>"I'm not going back to Shotover," said Agatha.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"No; I don't think so. However, I'll let you know to-morrow.
It all depends&mdash;but I don't expect to." She turned as her maid
tapped on the door. "Oh, Captain Voucher. Are you at home to him?"
flipping the pasteboard onto the table among the scattered cards.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Vendenning aggressively, "unless you expect
him to flop down on his knees to-night. Do you?"</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;to-night. Perhaps to-morrow. I don't know; I can't
tell yet."  And to her maid she nodded that they were at home
to Captain Voucher.</p>

<p>Quarrier had met him, too, just as he was leaving the hotel lobby.
They exchanged the careful salutations of men who had no use for
one another. On the Englishman's clean-cut face a deeper hue settled
as he passed; on Quarrier's, not a trace of emotion; but when
he entered his motor he sat bolt upright, stiff-backed and stiff-necked,
his long gray-gloved fingers moving restlessly over his pointed
heard.</p>

<p>The night was magnificent; myriads of summer stars spangled the
heavens. Even in the reeking city itself a slight freshness grew
in the air, although there was no wind to stir the parched leaves
of the park trees, among which fire-flies floated&mdash;their intermittent
phosphorescence breaking out with a silvery, star-like brilliancy.</p>

<p>Plank, driving his big motor northward through the night, Leila
Mortimer beside him, twice mistook the low glimmer of a fire-fly
for the distant lamp of a motor, which amused Leila, and her clear,
young laughter floated back to the ears of Sylvia and Siward,
curled up in their corners of the huge tonneau. But they were
too profoundly occupied with each other to heed the sudden care-free
laughter of the young matron, though in these days her laughter
was infrequent enough to set the more merciless tongues wagging
when it did sound.</p>

<p>Plank had never seen fit to speak to her of her husband's scarcely
veiled menace that day he had encountered him in the rotunda of
the Algonquin Trust Company. His first thought was to do so&mdash;to
talk it over with her, consider the threat and the possibility
of its seriousness, and then come to some logical and definite
decision as to what their future relations should be. Again and
again he had been on the point of doing this when alone with Leila&mdash;uncomfortable,
even apprehensive, because of their frank intimacy; but he had
never had the opportunity to do so without deliberately dragging
in the subject by the ears in all its ugliness and implied reproach
for her imprudence, and seeing that dreadful, vacant change in
Leila's face, which the mere mention of her husband's name was
sure to bring, turn into horror unspeakable.</p>

<p>A man not prone to fear his fellows, he now feared Mortimer,
but that fear struck him only through Leila&mdash;or had so reached
him until the days of his closing struggle with Quarrier. Whether
the long strain had unnerved him, whether minutely providing against
every possible danger he had been over-scrupulous, over-anxious,
morbidly exact&mdash;or whether a foresight almost abnormal had evoked
a sinister possibility&mdash;he did not know; but that threat of Mortimer's
to involve Plank with Leila in one common ruin, that boast that
he was able to do so could not be ignored as a possible weapon
if Quarrier should by any chance learn of it.</p>

<p>In all his life he had taken Leila into his arms but once; had
kissed her but once&mdash;but that once had been enough to arm Mortimer
with danger from head to foot. Some prying servant had either
listened or seen&mdash;perhaps a glimmer of a mirror had betrayed them.
At all events, whoever had seen or heard had informed Mortimer,
and now the man was equipped; the one and only man in all the
world who could with truth accuse Plank; the only man of whom
he stood in honest fear.</p>

<p>And it was characteristic of Plank that never for one moment
had it occurred to him that the sheer fault of it all lay with
Leila; that it was her imprudence alone that now threatened herself
and the man she loved&mdash;that threatened his very success in life
as long as Mortimer should live.</p>

<p>All this, Plank, in his thorough, painstaking review of the subject,
had taken into account; and he could not see how it could possibly
bear upon the matters now finally to be adjusted between Quarrier
and himself, because Quarrier was in New York and Mortimer in
Saratoga, and unless the latter had already sold his information
the former could not strike at him through knowledge of it.</p>

<p>And yet a curious reluctancy, a hesitation inexplicable&mdash;unless
overwork explained it&mdash;had come over him when Siward had proposed
their dining together on the very eve of his completed victory
over Quarrier.</p>

<p>It seemed absurd, and Plank was too stolid to entertain superstitions,
but he could not, even with Leila laughing there beside him, shake
off the dull instinct that all was not well&mdash;that Quarrier's attitude
was still the attitude of a dangerous man; that he, Plank, should
have had this evening in his room alone to study out the matters
he had so patiently plodded through in the long hours while Siward
slept.</p>

<p>Yet not for one instant did he dream of shifting the responsibility&mdash;if
responsibility entailed blame&mdash;on Siward, who, against Plank's
judgment and desire, had on the very eve of consummation drawn
him away from that sleepless vigilance which must for ever be
the price of a business man's safety.</p>

<p>Leila, gay and excited as a schoolgirl, chattered on ceaselessly
to Plank; all the silence, all the secrecy of the arid years turning
to laughter on her red lips, pouring out, in broken phrases of
delight, words strung together for the sheer pleasure of speech
and the happiness of her lot to be with him unrestrained.</p>

<p>He remembered once listening to the song of a wild bird on the
edge of a clearing at night, and how, standing entranced, the
low, distant jar of thunder sounded at moments, scarcely audible&mdash;like
his heart now, at intervals, dully persistent amid the gaiety
of her voice.</p>

<p>"And would you believe it, Beverly," she said, "I formed the
habit at Shotover of walking across the boundary and strolling
into your greenhouses and deliberately helping myself. And every
time I did it I was certain one of your men would march me out!"</p>

<p>He laughed, but did not tell her that his men had reported the
first episode and that he had instructed them that Mrs. Mortimer
and her friends were to do exactly as they pleased at the Fells.
However she knew it, because a garrulous gardener, proud of his
service with Plank, had informed her.</p>

<p>"Beverly," she said, "you are a dear. If people only knew what
I know!"</p>

<p>He began to turn red; she could see it even in the flickering,
lamp-shot darkness. And she teased him for a while, very gently,
even tenderly; and their voices grew lower in a half-serious badinage
that ended with a quiet, indrawn breath, a sigh, and silence.</p>

<p>And now the river swept into view, a darkly luminous sheet set
with reflected stars. Mirrored lights gleamed in it; sudden bright,
yellow flashes zigzagged into its sombre depths; the foliage edged
it with a deeper gloom over which, on the heights, twinkled the
multicoloured lights of Riverside Inn.</p>

<p>Up the broad, gentle grade they sped, curving in and out among
the clumps of trees and shrubbery, then on a level, sweeping in
a great circle up to the steps of the inn.</p>

<p>Now all about them from the brilliantly lighted verandas the
gay tumult broke out like an uproarious welcome after the swift
silence of their journey; the stir of jolly people keen for pleasure;
the clatter of crockery; the coming and going of waiters, of guests,
of hansoms, coupés, victorias, and scores of motor-cars wheeling
and turning through the blinding glare of their own headlights.</p>

<p>Somewhere a gipsy orchestra, full of fitful crescendoes and throbbing
suspensions of caprice, furnished resonant accompaniment to the
joyous clamour; the scent of fountain spray and flowers was in
the air.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you had telephoned for a table," said Siward,
as a head-waiter came up smiling and bowing to Plank. "I confess,
in the new excitement of things, I clean forgot it! What a man
you are to think of other people!"</p>

<p>Plank reddened again, muttering something evasive, and went forward
with Leila.</p>

<p>Sylvia, moving leisurely beside Siward who was walking slowly
but confidently without crutches, whispered to him: "I never really
liked Mr. Plank before I understood his attitude toward you."</p>

<p>"He is a man, every inch," said Siward simply.</p>

<p>"I think that generally includes what men of your sort demand,
doesn't it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Men of my sort sometimes demand in others what they themselves
are lacking in," said Siward, laughing. "Sylvia, look at this
jolly crowd! Look at all those tables! It seems an age since I
have done anything of this sort. I feel like a boy of eighteen&mdash;the
same funny, quickening fascination in me toward everything gay
and bright and alive!" He looked around at her, laughingly. "As
for you," he said, "you look about sixteen. You certainly are
the most beautiful thing this beautiful world ever saw!"</p>

<p>"Schoolboy courtship!" she mocked him, lingering as he made his
slow way through the crowded place. The tint of excitement was
in her eyes and cheeks; the echo of it in her low, happy voice.
"Where on earth is Mr. Plank? Oh, I see them! They have a table
by the balcony rail, in the corner; and it seems to be rather
secluded, Stephen, so I shall, of course, expect you to say nothing
further about beauty of any species. … Are you a trifle tired?
No? … Well, you need not be indignant. I don't care whether you
tumble. Indeed, I don't believe there is really anything the matter
with you&mdash;you are walking with the same old careless saunter.
Mr. Plank," as they arrived and seated themselves, "Mr. Siward
has just admitted that he uses crutches only because they are
ornamental. Leila, isn't this air delicious? All sorts of people,
too, aren't there, Mr. Plank? Such curious-looking women, some
of them&mdash;quite pretty, too, in a certain way. Are you hungry,
St &mdash;Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"Are you, St &mdash;Mr. Siward?" mimicked Leila promptly.</p>

<p>"I am," said Siward, laughing at Sylvia's significant colour
and noting Plank's direct gaze as the waiter filled Leila's slender-stemmed
glass. And "nothing but Apollinaris," he said coolly, as the waiter
approached him; but though his voice was easy enough, a dull patch
of colour came out under the cheek-bones.</p>

<p>"That is all I care for, either," said Sylvia with elaborate
carelessness.</p>

<p>Plank and Leila immediately began to make conversation. Siward,
his eyes bent on the glass of mineral water at his elbow, looked
up in silence at Sylvia questioningly.</p>

<p>There was something in her face he did not quite comprehend.
She made as though to speak, looked at him, hesitated, her lovely
face eloquent under the impulse. Then, leaning toward him, she
said:</p>

<p>"'And thy ways shall be my ways.'"</p>

<p>"Sylvia, you must not deny yourself, just because I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me. It is the happiest thing I have ever done for myself."</p>

<p>"But I don't wish it."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I do," she said, the low excited laughter scarcely fluttering
her lips. "Listen: I never before, in all my life, gave up anything
for your sake, only this one little pitiful thing."</p>

<p>"I won't let you!" he breathed; "it is nonsense to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must let me! Am I to be on friendly terms with&mdash;with your
mortal enemy?" She was still smiling, but now her sensitive mouth
quivered suddenly.</p>

<p>He sat silent, considering her, his restless fingers playing
with his glass in which the harmless bubbles were breaking.</p>

<p>"I drink to your health, Stephen," she said under her breath.
"I drink to your happiness, too; and&mdash;and to your fortune, and
to all that you desire from fortune." And she raised her glass
in the star-light, looking over it into his eyes.</p>

<p>"All I desire from fortune?" he repeated significantly.</p>

<p>"All&mdash;almost all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, all," he demanded.</p>

<p>But she only raised the glass to her lips, still looking at him
as she drank.</p>

<p>They became unreasonably gay almost immediately, though the beverage
scarcely accounted for the delicate intoxication that seemed to
creep into their veins. Yet it was sufficient for Siward to say
an amusing thing wittily, for Sylvia to return his lead with all
the delightful, unconscious brilliancy that he seemed to inspire
in her&mdash;as though awaking into real life once more. All that had
slumbered in her through the winter and spring, and the long,
arid summer now crumbling to the edge of autumn, broke out into
a delicate riot of exquisite florescence; the very sounds of her
voice, every intonation, every accent, every pause, were charming
surprises; her laughter was a miracle, her beauty a revelation.</p>

<p>Leila, aware of it, exchanged glance after glance with Plank.
Siward, alternately the leader in it all, then the enchanted listener,
bewitched, enthralled, felt care slipping from his shoulders like
a mantle, and sadness exhaling from a heart that was beating strongly,
steadily, fearlessly&mdash;as a heart should beat in the breast of
him who has taken at last his fighting chance. He took it now,
under her eyes, for honour, for manhood, and for the ideal which
had made manhood no longer an empty term muttered in desperation
by a sick body, and a mind too sick to control it.</p>

<p>Yes, at last the lifelong battle was on. He knew it. He knew,
too, whatever his fate with her or without her, he must always
go on with the battle for the safe-guarding of that manhood the
consciousness of which she had aroused.</p>

<p>All he knew was that, through the medium of his love for her,
whatever in him of the spiritual remained, or had been generated,
was now awake, alive, strong, vital, indestructible&mdash;an impalpable
current flowing from a sane intelligence, through medium of her,
back to the eternal truth, returning always, always, to the deathless
source from whence it came.</p>

<p>Lingering over the fruit, the champagne breaking in the glasses
standing on the table between them, rim to rim, Leila and Plank
had fallen into a low, desultory, yet guarded exchange of words
and silences.</p>

<p>Sylvia sprang up and pushed her chair into the farther corner
against the balcony rail, where no light fell except the radiance
of the stars. Here Siward joined her, dragging his chair around
so that it faced her as she leaned back, tilted against a shadowy
column.</p>

<p>"Is this Bohemianism, Stephen? If it is, I rather like it. Don't
you? You are going to smoke now, aren't you? Ah, that is delightful!" 
daintily sniffing the aroma from his cigarette. "It always reminds
me of you&mdash;there on the cliffs, that first day. Do you remember?&mdash;the
smoke from your cigarette whirling up in my face? … You say you
remember. … Oh, of course there's nothing else to say when a girl
asks you … is there? Oh, I won't argue with you, if you insist
that you do remember. You will not be like any other man if you
do, that's all. … The little things that women remember! … And
believe that men remember! It is pitiful in a way. There! I am
not going to spill over, and I don't care a copper penny whether
you really do remember or not! … Yes, I do care! … Oh, all women
care. It is their first disappointment to learn how much a man
can forget and still remember to care for them&mdash;a little! … Stephen,
I said a little; and that is all that you are permitted to care
for me; isn't it? … Please, don't. You are deliberately beginning
to say things! … Stephen, you silly! you are making love to me!"</p>

<p>In the darkness his hand encountered hers on the wooden rail,
and the tremor of the contact silenced her. She freed one finger,
then let it rest with its slender fellow-prisoners. There was
no use in trying to speak just then&mdash;utterly useless her voice
in the soft, rounded throat imprisoned by the swelling pulses
that tightened and hammered and tightened.</p>

<p>Years seemed to fall away from her, slipping back, back into
girlhood, into childhood, drawing not her alone on the gliding
tide, but carrying him with her. An exquisite languor held her.
Through it vague hints of those splendid visions of her lonely
childhood rose, shaping themselves in the starry darkness&mdash;the
old mystery of dreams, the old, innocent desires, the old simplicity
of clairvoyance wherein right was right and wrong, wrong&mdash;in all
the conventional significance of right and wrong, in all the old-fashioned,
undisturbed faith of childhood.</p>

<p>Drifting deliciously, her eyes sometimes meeting his, sometimes
lost in the magic of her reverie, she lay there in her chair,
her unresisting fingers locked in his.</p>

<p>Odd little thoughts came hovering into her reverie&mdash;thoughts
that seemed distantly familiar, the direct, unconscious impulses
of a child. To feel was once more the only motive for expression;
to think fearlessly was once more inherent; to desire was to demand&mdash;unlock
her lips, naively, and ask for what she wished.</p>

<p>Under the spell, she turned her blue gaze on him, and her lips
parted without a tremor:</p>

<p>"What do you offer for what you ask? And do you still ask it?
Is it me you are asking me for? Because you love me? And what
do you give&mdash;love?"</p>

<p>"Weigh it with the&mdash;other," he said.</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;often&mdash;every moment since I have known you. And what
a winter!"  Her voice was almost inaudible. "What a winter&mdash;without
you!"</p>

<p>"That hell is ended for me, too. Sylvia, I know what I ask. And
I ask. I know what I offer. Will you take it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>He rose, blindly. She stood up, pale, wide-eyed, confronting
him, stammering out the bargain:</p>

<p>"I take all&mdash;all! every virtue, every vice of you. I give all&mdash;all!
all I have been, all I am, all I shall be! Is that enough? Oh,
if there were only more to give! Stephen, if there were only more!"</p>

<p>Her hands had fallen into his, and they looked each other in
the eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly, through the hush of the enchanted moment, a sullen
sound broke&mdash;the sound of a voice they knew, threateningly raised,
louder and louder, growling, profanely menacing.</p>

<p>Aghast, they turned in the darkness, peering toward the lighted
space beyond. Leroy Mortimer, his face shockingly congested, stood
unsteadily balancing there, confronting his wife, who sat staring
at him in horror. At the same instant Plank rose and laid a hand
on Mortimer's shoulder, but Mortimer shook him off with a warning
oath.</p>

<p>"You and I will settle with each other to-morrow!" he said thickly,
pointing a puffy finger at Plank. "You'll find me at the Algonquin
Trust. Do you hear? That's where you'll settle this matter&mdash;in
the president's office!" He stood swaying and leering at Plank,
repeating loudly: "In Quarrier's office! Understand? That's where
you'll settle up! See?"</p>

<p>Leila, white face quivering, shrank as though he had struck her,
and he turned on her again, grinning: "As for you, you come home!
And that'll be about all for yours."</p>

<p>"Are you insane, to make a scene like this?" whispered Plank.</p>

<p>But Mortimer swung on him insultingly: "That's about all from
you, too!"  he said. "Leila, are you coming?"</p>

<p>He stepped heavily toward her; but Plank's sudden crushing grip
was on his fat arm above the elbow, and he emitted a roar of surprise
and pain.</p>

<p>"Don't touch him! Don't, in Heaven's name!" stammered Leila,
as Plank, releasing him, stepped back beside her chair. "Can't
you see that I must go with him! I &mdash;I must go." She cast
one terrified glance around her, where scores of strange faces
met hers; and at every table people were standing up to see better.</p>

<p>Plank, who had dropped Mortimer's arm as the latter emitted his
bellow of amazement, stepped toward him again, dropping his voice
as he spoke:</p>

<p>"You go! Do you hear?" he said quietly. "I'll do what you ask
me, to-morrow! I will do what you ask, if you'll go now!"</p>

<p>"You come&mdash;do you hear!" snarled Mortimer, turning on his wife,
who had already risen. "If you don't I'll make a row here that
you'll never hear the end of as long as you live! And there'll
be nothing to talk over in Quarrier's office, if I do."</p>

<p>Leila looked at Plank, rose, and moved swiftly toward the veranda
steps, her head resolutely lowered, the burning shame flaming
in her face. Mortimer cast one triumphant glance at Plank, then
waddled unsteadily after his wife.</p>

<p>"Hold on," he growled; "I've a Mercedes here! I'll drive you
back&mdash;wait! Here it is! Here we are!" And to Quarrier's machinist
he said: "You get into the tonneau. I want to show Mrs. Mortimer
what night-driving is. Do you hear? I tell you I'm going to drive
this machine and show you how!"</p>

<p>Leila scarcely heard him. She obeyed the impulse of his hand
on her arm, and mounted to the seat, staring straight ahead of
her with dazed and straining eyes that saw nothing.</p>

<p>Then Mortimer clambered to his seat, and, without an instant's
warning, opened up and seized the wheel.</p>

<p>Unprepared, the machinist attempted to swing aboard, missed his
footing in the uncertain light, and fell sprawling on the gravel.
Plank saw him from the veranda and instantly vaulted the rail
to the lawn below.</p>

<p>"You damn fool!" yelled Mortimer, looking around, "what in hell
do you think you'll do?" And he clapped on full speed as Plank
made a leap for the car and missed.</p>

<p>Mortimer laughed, and turned his head to look back, and the next
instant something seemed to wrench the steering-wheel from its
roots. There was a blinding glare of light, a scream, and the
great machine bounded into the air full length, turned completely
over, and lay across a flower-bed, partly on one side.</p>

<p>Something was afire, too. Men were rushing from the verandas,
women screamed, and stood up wringing their hands; a mounted policeman
came galloping through the darkness; people shouted: "Throw sand
on it! Get shovels, for God's sake! Lift that tonneau! There's
a woman under it."</p>

<p>But they were mistaken, for Leila lay at the foot of the slope,
one little bloody hand clutching the dead grass; and Plank knelt
beside her, giving his orders quietly to those who came running
down the hill from the roadway above, which was now fiercely illuminated
by burning gasoline. At last they got sand enough to quench the
fire and men sufficient to lift the weight from the dead man's
neck, and drag what was left of him onto the grass.</p>

<p>"Don't look," whispered Siward, drawing Sylvia back.</p>

<p>He and she both had put their shoulders to the tonneau along
with the others; and now they stood there together in the shifting
lantern-light, sickened, shivering under the summer stars, staring
at the gathering crowd around that shapeless lump on the grass.</p>

<p>Plank passed them, walking beside an improvised stretcher, calm,
almost smiling, as Sylvia sprang forward with a little sob of
inquiry.</p>

<p>"There's the doctor, over there; that man is a doctor; he knows," 
repeated Plank with studied deliberation, looking down at Leila's
deathly face. "He says it's all right; he says he'll get a candle,
and that he can tell by the flame's effect on the pupils of the
eyes what exactly is the matter. No," to Siward beside him, pressing
forward through the crowd which eddied from the dead man to the
stretcher; "no, there is not a bone broken. She is stunned, that's
all; she fell in the shrubbery. We'll have an ambulance here pretty
quick. Stephen," using his first name unconsciously, "won't you
look out for Sylvia? I'm going back on the ambulance. If you'll
find somebody to drive my machine, I wish you would take Sylvia
back. No, I don't want you to drive, Stephen&mdash;if you don't mind.
Get that machinist, please. I'm rattled, and I don't want you
to drive."</p>

<p>Leila lay on the stretcher, her bloodless face upturned to the
stars. Beyond, under a blanket, something else lay very still
on the lawn.</p>

<p>Plank beckoned a policeman, and whispered to him.</p>

<p>Then, far away in the darkness, a distant clamour grew on the
night air, nearer, nearer.</p>

<p>Plank, standing beside the stretcher, raised his head, listening
to the ambulance arriving at full speed.</p>
