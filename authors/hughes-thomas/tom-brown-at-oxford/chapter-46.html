<p>If a knowledge of contemporary history must be reckoned as an
important element in the civilization of any people, then I am
afraid that the good folk of Englebourn must have been content,
in the days of our story, with a very low place on the ladder.
How, indeed, was knowledge to percolate, so as to reach down to
the foundations of Englebournian society&mdash;the stratum on which
all others rest&mdash;the common agricultural labourer, producer of
corn and other grain, the careful and stolid nurse and guardian
of youthful oxen, sheep and pigs, many of them far better fed
and housed than his own children? All-penetrating as she is, one
cannot help wondering that she did not give up Englebourn altogether
as a hopeless job.</p>

<p>So far as written periodical instruction is concerned (with the
exception of the <em>Quarterly</em>, which Dr. Winter had taken
in from its commencement, but rarely opened), the supply was limited
to at most half a dozen weekly papers. A London journal, sound
in Church and State principles, most respectable but not otherwise
than heavy, came every Saturday to the rectory. The Conservative
county paper was taken in at the Red Lion; and David the constable,
and the blacksmith, clubbed together to purchase the Liberal paper,
by help of which they managed to wage unequal war with the knot
of village quidnuncs, who assembled almost nightly at the bar
of the Tory beast above referred to&mdash;that king of beasts, red
indeed in colour but of the truest blue in political principle.
Besides these, perhaps three or four more papers were taken by
the farmers. But, scanty as the food was, it was quite enough
for the mouths; indeed, when the papers once passed out of the
parlours, they had for the most part performed their mission.
Few of the farm-servants, male or female, had curiosity or scholarship
enough to spell through the dreary columns.</p>

<p>And oral teaching was not much more plentiful, as how was it
likely to be? Englebourn was situated on no trunk road, and the
amount of intercourse between it and the rest of the world was
of the most limited kind. The rector never left home; the curate
at rare intervals. Most of the farmers went to market once a week
and dined at their ordinary, discussing county politics according
to their manner, but bringing home little, except as much food
and drink as they could cleverly carry. The carrier went to and
from Newbury once a week; but he was a silent man, chiefly bent
on collecting and selling butter. The postman, who was deaf, only
went as far as the next village. The waggoners drove their masters'
produce to market from time to time, and boozed away an hour or
two in the kitchen, or tap, or skittle-alley, of some small public-house
in the nearest town, while their horses rested. With the above
exceptions, probably not one of the villagers strayed ten miles
from home, from year's end to year's end. As to visitors, an occasional
peddler or small commercial traveller turned up about once a quarter.
A few boys and girls, more enterprising than their fellows, went
out altogether into the world, of their own accord, in the course
of the year; and an occasional burly ploughboy, or carter's boy,
was entrapped into taking the Queen's shilling by some subtle
recruiting sergeant. But few of these were seen again, except
at long intervals. The yearly village feasts, harvest homes, or
a meet of the hounds on Englebourn Common, were the most exciting
events which in an ordinary way stirred the surface of Englebourn
life; only faintest and most distant murmurs of the din and strife
of the great outer world, of wars, and rumors of wars, the fall
of governments, and the throes of nations, reached that primitive,
out-of-the-way little village.</p>

<p>A change was already showing itself since Miss Winter had been
old enough to look after the schools. The waters were beginning
to stir; and by this time, no doubt, the parish boasts a regular
book-hawker and reading-room; but at that day Englebourn was like
one of those small ponds you may find in some nook of a hill-side,
the banks grown over with underwood, to which neither man nor
beast, scarcely the winds of heaven, have any access. When you
have found such a pond, you may create a great excitement amongst
the easy-going newts and frogs who inhabit it, by throwing in
a pebble. The splash in itself is a small splash enough, and the
waves which circle away from it are very tiny waves, but they
move over the whole face of the pond, and are of more interest
to the frogs than a nor'-wester in the Atlantic.</p>

<p>So the approaching return of Harry Winburn, and the story of
his doings at the wars, and of the wonderful things he had sent
home, stirred Englebourn to its depth. In that small corner of
the earth, the sergeant was of far more importance than governor-general
and commander-in-chief. In fact, it was probably the common belief
that he was somehow the head of the whole business; and India,
the war, and all that hung thereon, were looked at and cared for
only as they had served to bring him out. So careless were the
good folk about everything in the matter except their own hero,
and so wonderful were the romances which soon got abroad about
him, that Miss Winter, tired of explaining again and again to
the old women without the slightest effect on the parochial faith,
bethought her of having a lecture on the subject of India and
the war in the parish schoolroom.</p>

<p>Full of this idea, she wrote off to Tom, who was the medium of
communication on Indian matters, and propounded it to him. The
difficulty was, that Mr. Walker, the curate, the only person competent
to give it, was going away directly for a three weeks' holiday,
having arranged with two neighbouring curates to take his Sunday
duty for him. What was to be done? Harry might be back any day,
it seemed; so there was no time to be lost. Could Tom come himself,
and help her?</p>

<p>Tom could not, but he wrote back to say that his friend Hardy
was just getting away from Oxford for the long vacation, and would
gladly take Mr. Walker's duty for the three weeks, if Dr. Winter
approved, on his way home; by which Englebourn would not be without
an efficient parson on week-days, and she would have the man of
all others to help her in utilizing the sergeant's history for
the instruction of the bucolic mind. The arrangement, moreover,
would be particularly happy, because Hardy had already promised
to perform the marriage ceremony, which Tom and she had settled
would take place at the earliest possible moment after the return
of the Indian heroes.</p>

<p>Dr. Winter was very glad to accept the offer; and so, when they
parted at Oxford, Hardy went to Englebourn, where we must leave
him for the present. Tom went home&mdash;whence, in a few days, he
had to hurry down to Southampton to meet the two Harrys. He was
much shocked at first to see the state of his old school-fellow.
East looked haggard and pale in the face, notwithstanding the
sea voyage. His clothes hung on him as if they had been made for
a man of twice his size, and he walked with difficulty by the
help of a large stick. But he had lost none of his indomitableness,
laughed at Tom's long face, and declared that he felt himself
getting better and stronger every day.</p>

<p>"If you had only seen me at Calcutta," he said, "you would sing
a different song. Eh, Winburn?"</p>

<p>Harry Winburn was much changed, and had acquired all the composed
and self-reliant look which is so remarkable in a good non-commissioned
officer. Readiness to obey and command was stamped on every line
of his face; but it required all his powers of self-restraint
to keep within bounds his delight at getting home again. His wound
was quite healed, and his health re-established by the voyage;
and, when Tom saw how wonderfully his manners and carriage were
improved, and how easily his uniform sat on him, he felt quite
sure that all would soon be right at Englebourn, and that Katie
and he would be justified in their prophecies and preparations.
The invalids had to report themselves in London, and thither the
three proceeded together. When this was done, Harry Winburn was
sent off at once. He resisted at first, and begged to be allowed
to stay with his captain until the captain could go to Berkshire
himself. But he was by this time too much accustomed to discipline
not to obey a positive order, and was comforted by Tom's assurance
that he would not leave East, and would do everything for him
which the sergeant had been accustomed to do.</p>

<p>Three days later, as East and Tom were sitting at breakfast,
a short note came from Miss Winter, telling of Harry's arrival&mdash;how
the bells were set ringing to welcome him; how Mr. Hardy had preached
the most wonderful sermon on his story the next day; above all,
how Patty had surrendered at discretion, and the banns had been
called for the first time. So the sooner they would come down
the better&mdash;as it was very important that no time should be lost,
lest some of the old jealousies and quarrels should break out
again. Upon reading and considering which letter, East resolved
to start for Englebourn at once, and Tom to accompany him.</p>

<p>There was one person to whom Harry's return and approaching wedding
was a subject of unmixed joy and triumph, and that was David the
constable. He had always been a sincere friend to Harry, and had
stood up for him when all the parish respectabilities had turned
against him, and had prophesied that he would live to be a credit
to the place. So now David felt himself an inch higher as he saw
Harry walking about in his uniform with his sweetheart, the admiration
of all Englebourn. But, besides all the unselfish pleasure which
David enjoyed on his young friend's account, a little piece of
private and personal gratification came to him on his own. Ever
since Harry's courtship had begun, David had felt himself in a
false position towards, and had suffered under, old Simon, the
rector's gardener. The necessity for keeping the old man in good
humor for Harry's sake had always been present to the constable's
mind; and for the privilege of putting in a good word for his
favorite now and then, he had allowed old Simon to assume an air
of superiority over him, and to trample upon him and dogmatize
to him, even in the matters of flowers and bees. This had been
the more galling to David on account of old Simon's intolerant
Toryism, which the constable's soul rebelled against, except in
the matter of Church music. On this point they agreed, but even
here Simon managed to be unpleasant. He would lay the whole blame
of the changes which had been effected upon David, accusing him
of having given in where there was no need. As there was nothing
but a wall between the Rectory garden and David's little strip
of ground, in which he spent all his leisure time until the shades
of evening summoned him to the bar of the Red Lion for his daily
pint and pipe, the two were constantly within hearing of one another,
and Simon, in times past, had seldom neglected an opportunity
of making himself disagreeable to his long-suffering neighbour.</p>

<p>But now David was a free man again; and he took the earliest
occasion of making the change in his manner apparent to Simon,
and of getting, as he called it, "upsides" with him. One would
have thought, to look at him, that the old gardener was as pachydermatous
as a rhinoceros; but somehow he seemed to feel that things had
changed between them, and did not appreciate an interview with
David now nearly so much as of old. So he found very little to
do in that part of the garden which abutted on the constable's
premises. When he could not help working there, he chose the times
at which David was most likely to be engaged, or even took the
trouble to ascertain that he was not at home.</p>

<p>Early on Midsummer day, old Simon reared his ladder against the
boundary wall, with a view of "doctorin'" some of the fruit trees,
relying on a parish meeting, at which the constable's presence
was required. But he had not more than half finished his operations
before David had returned from vestry, and, catching sight of
the top of the ladder and Simon's head above the wall, laid aside
all other business, and descended into the garden.</p>

<p>Simon kept on at his work, only replying by a jerk of the head
and one of his grunts to his neighbour's salutation.</p>

<p>David took his coat off, and his pruning knife out, and, establishing
himself within easy shot of his old oppressor, opened fire at
once&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou'st gi'en thy consent, then?"</p>

<p>"'Tis no odds, consent or none&mdash;her's old enough to hev her own
waay."</p>

<p>"But thou'st gi'en thy consent?"</p>

<p>"Ees, then, if thou wilt hev't," said Simon, somewhat surlily;
"wut then?"</p>

<p>"So I heerd," said David, indulging in an audible chuckle.</p>

<p>"What bist a laughin' at?"</p>

<p>"I be laughin' to think how folks changes. Do'st mind the hard
things as thou hast judged and said o' Harry? Not as ever I known
thy judgment to be o' much account, 'cept about roots. But thou
saidst, times and times, as a would come to the gallows."</p>

<p>"So a med yet&mdash;so a med yet," answered Simon. "Not but wut I
wishes well to un, and bears no grudges; but others as hev got
the law ov un medn't."</p>

<p>"'Tis he as hev got grudges to bear. He don't need none o' thy
forgiveness."</p>

<p>"Pr'aps a medn't. But hev 'em got the law ov un, or hevn't em?"</p>

<p>"Wut do'st mean&mdash;got the law ov un?"</p>

<p>"Thaay warrants as wur out agen un, along wi' the rest as was
transpworted auver Farmer Tester's job."</p>

<p>"Oh, he've got no call to be afeard o' thaay now. Thou know'st
I hears how 'tis laid down in Sessions and 'Sizes, wher' I've
a been this twenty year."</p>

<p>"Like enuff. Only, wut's to hinder thaay tryin' ov un, if thaay
be a minded to 't? That's what I wants to know."</p>

<p>"'Tis wut the counsellors calls the Statut o' Lamentations,"
said the constable, proudly.</p>

<p>"Wutever's Lamentations got to do wi't?"</p>

<p>"A gurt deal, I tell 'ee. What do'st thou know o' Lamentations?"</p>

<p>"Lamentations cums afore Ezekiel in the Bible."</p>

<p>"That ain't no kin to the Statut o' Lamentations. But ther's
summut like to't in the Bible," said the constable, stopping his
work to consider a moment. "Do'st mind the year when the land
wur all to be guv back to thaay as owned it fust, and debts wur
to be wiped out?"</p>

<p>"Ees, I minds summut o' that."</p>

<p>"Well, this here statut says, if so be as a man hev bin to the
wars, and sarved his country like; as nothin' shan't be reckoned
agen he, let alone murder. Nothin' can't do away wi' murder."</p>

<p>"No, nor oughtn't. Hows'mdever, you seems clear about the law
on't. There's Miss a callin'."</p>

<p>And old Simon's head disappeared as he descended the ladder to
answer the summons of his young mistress, not displeased at having
his fears as to the safety of his future son-in-law set at rest
by so eminent a legal authority as the constable. Fortunately
for Harry, the constable's law was not destined to be tried. Young
Wurley was away in London. Old Tester was bedridden with an accumulation
of diseases brought on by his bad life. His illness made him more
violent and tyrannical than ever; but he could do little harm
out of his own room, for no one ever went to see him, and the
wretched farm-servant who attended him was much too frightened
to tell him anything of what was going on in the parish. There
was no one else to revive proceedings against Harry.</p>

<p>David pottered on at his bees and his flowers till old Simon
returned, and ascended his ladder again.</p>

<p>"You be ther' still, be 'ee?" he said, as soon as he saw David.</p>

<p>"Ees. Any news?"</p>

<p>"Ah, news enuff. He as wur Harry's captain and young Mr. Brown
be comin' down to-morrow, and hev tuk all the Red Lion to theirselves.
And thaay beant content to wait for banns&mdash;not thaay&mdash;and so ther's
to be a license got for Saturday. 'Taint scarce decent, that 'taint."</p>

<p>"'Tis best to get drough wi't," said the constable.</p>

<p>"Then nothin'll sarve 'em but the church must be hung wi' flowers,
and wher' be thaay to cum from without strippin' and starvin'
ov my beds? 'Tis shameful to see how folks acts wi' flowers now-a-days,
a cuttin' on 'em and puttin' on 'em about, as prodigal at though
thaay growed o' theirselves."</p>

<p>"So 'tis shameful," said David, whose sympathies for flowers
were all with Simon. "I heers tell as young Squire Wurley hevs
'em on table at dinner-time instead o' the wittels."</p>

<p>"Do'ee though! I calls it reg'lar Papistry, and so I tells Miss;
but her only laughs."</p>

<p>The constable shook his head solemnly as he replied "Her've been
led away wi' such doin's ever sence Mr. Walker cum, and took to
organ-playin' and chantin'."</p>

<p>"And he ain't no such gurt things in the pulpit, neether, ain't
Mr. Walker," chimed in Simon, (the two had not been so in harmony
for years). "I reckon as he ain't nothin' to speak ov alongside
o' this here new un as hev tuk his place. He've a got a good deal
o' move in un' he hev."</p>

<p>"Ah, so a hev. A wunnerful sight o' things a telled us t'other
night, about the Indians and the wars."</p>

<p>"Ah! talking cums as nat'ral to he as buttermilk to a litterin'
sow."</p>

<p>"Thou should'st a heerd un, though, about the battles. I can't
mind the neames on 'em&mdash;let me see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I dwun't valley the neames," interrupted Simon. "Thaay makes
a deal o' fuss auvert 'taal, but I dwun't tek no account on't.
Tain't like the owld wars and fightin' o' the French, this here
fightin' wi' blackamoors, let 'em talk as thaay wool."</p>

<p>"No more 'tain't. But 'twur a 'mazin' fine talk as he gi'n us.
Hev 'ee seed ought 'twixt he and young missus?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' out o' th' common. I got plenty to do without lookin'
arter the women, and 'tain't no bisness o' mine, nor o' thine
neether."</p>

<p>David was preparing a stout rejoinder to this rebuke of the old
retainer of the Winter family on his curiosity, but was summoned
by his wife to the house to attend a customer; and by the time
he could get out again, Simon had disappeared.</p>

<p>The next day East and Tom arrived, and took possession of the
Red Lion; and Englebourn was soon in a ferment of preparation
for the wedding. East was not the man to do things by halves;
and, seconded as he was by Miss Winter, and Hardy, and Tom, had
soon made arrangements for all sorts of merrymaking. The school-children
were to have a whole holiday, and, after scattering flowers at
church and marching in the bridal procession, were to be entertained
in a tent pitched in the home paddock of the Rectory, and to have
an afternoon of games and prizes, and cake and tea. The bell-ringers,
Harry's old comrades, were to have five shillings apiece, and
a cricket match, and a dinner afterwards at the second public
house, to which any other of his old friends whom Harry chose
to ask, were to be also invited. The old men and women were to
be fed in the village school-room; and East and Tom were to entertain
a select party of the farmers and tradesmen, at the Red Lion;
the tap of which hostelry was to be thrown open to all comers
at the Captain's expense. It was not without considerable demur
on the part of Miss Winter, that some of these indiscriminate
festivities were allowed to pass. But after consulting with Hardy,
she relented, on condition that the issue of beer at the two public-houses
should be put under the control of David, the constable, who,
on his part, promised that law and order should be well represented
and maintained on the occasion. "Arter all, Miss, you sees, 'tis
only for once in a waay," he said; "and 'twill make 'em remember
aal as hev bin said to 'em about the Indians, and the rest on't."
So the Captain and his abettors, having gained the constable as
an ally, prevailed; and Englebourn, much wondering at itself,
made ready for a general holiday.</p>
