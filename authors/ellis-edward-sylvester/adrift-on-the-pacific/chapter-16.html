<p>But the mutineers took good care not to show themselves just
then; and the captain, deeming such a course prudent, tugged at
the anchor until it was lifted, when he managed to shove the craft
off, and reaching the middle of the lagoon, the anchor was dropped.</p>

<p>"Now they won't be likely to approach without my seeing them,"
was his conclusion; "and so long as I can keep awake, I can hold
them at bay. I hate to shoot a man, but if ever a person had justification
for doing so, I have. I am rather inclined to think that if either
Brazzier or Redvignez should wander into range, one of these rifles
would be likely to go off!"</p>

<p>Seeing no immediate danger, Captain Bergen descended into the
cabin for a few minutes. Poor, tired Inez had thrown herself on
the hammock and was sound asleep.</p>

<p>"Sleep, little one," murmured the captain, as he lingered for
a minute to look at the sweet, infantile face, in the gathering
twilight. "It is a sad fate which orders you to witness so much
violence, and sorry I am that it is so; but where would I have
been excepting for you?"</p>

<p>Then he softly left the cabin and took his position on deck.
The moon was full, which was gratefully noticed by the captain,
for he could easily keep awake all night, and thus detect the
approach of his enemies. In fact, his nerves were so unstrung
that he would not be able to sleep for many hours to come.</p>

<p>"But what is to be done hereafter?"</p>

<p>This was the question he put to himself, and which had to be
answered.</p>

<p>The mutineers kept carefully out of sight, and, as night settled
over the scene, the captain remained wide awake and vigilant.
There was ample food for thought and reflection&mdash;the cutting of
the hose-pipes of the diving apparatus, the attack by the mutineers,
the terrible flight and pursuit, the interference of Inez&mdash;all
these and more surged through the brain of the captain, while
he slowly paced back and forth, with eyes and ears wide open.
Inez still slumbered, and all was silent, excepting the boom of
the ocean against the coral-reef; while, as the night wore on,
the captain maintained his lonely watch.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen scanned the fringe of shore which circled about
him, like a great wall thrown up between the lagoon and the Pacific,
that steadily broke on the outside. But turn his keen eyes wheresoever
he chose, he could detect not the slightest sign of the mutineers.
He thought it likely they would start a fire somewhere, but no
starlike point of light twinkled from beneath the palm-trees,
and he was left to conjecture where they were and what they were
doing.</p>

<p>"They will probably wait till they think I am asleep," was his
thought, "and then they will swim quietly out and try to board."</p>

<p>He believed it would be either that way or they would construct
a raft and paddle themselves out to the schooner. Knowing the
captain was on the Coral, and knowing how important it was that
he should not be allowed to run away and leave them there, they
would neglect no precaution to prevent his going off. They, too,
would understand what it was he was waiting for, and they were
seamen enough to know the hour when he would be able to sail,
and, consequently, what they were to do to prevent it.</p>

<p>"They have no way of closing the channel, or they would do so,
and it remains-&mdash;Hello!"</p>

<p>He was standing at the prow, looking carefully about him, and
with all his senses alert, and he stood thus fully twenty minutes,
expecting something whose precise nature he had already conjectured.</p>

<p>"That splash meant something, and I think&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then he heard a commotion in the water directly under the
prow, and, looking over, he saw a strange-looking object, like
one of the uncouth monsters of the deep, come to the surface and
begin climbing up by aid of the fore-chains.</p>

<p>"I say, cap'n, can't you give a fellow a lift?"</p>

<p>It was the mate, Abe Storms, who asked the question, and, as
the captain extended his hand, he said, in a low, fervent voice:</p>

<p>"Thank heaven! I was about giving you up for lost!"</p>
