<P>
The perfume of countless roses, the music of the finest band in
Europe, floated through the famous white ballroom of Devenham
House. Electric lights sparkled from the ceiling, through the
pillared way the ceaseless splashing of water from the fountains
in the winter garden seemed like a soft undernote to the murmur
of voices, the musical peals of laughter, the swirl of skirts,
and the rhythm of flying feet.
<P>
Penelope stood upon the edge of the ballroom, her hand resting
still upon her partner's arm. She wore a dress of dull
rose-color, a soft, clinging silk, which floated about her as she
danced, a creation of Paquin's, daring but delightful. Her eyes
were very full and soft. She was looking her best, and knew it.
Nevertheless, she was just at the moment, a little DISTRAIT. She
was watching the brilliant scene with a certain air of
abstraction, as though her interest in it was, after all, an
impersonal thing.
<P>
"Jolly well every one looks tonight," her partner, who was Sir
Charles, remarked. "All the women seem to be wearing smart
frocks, and some of those foreign uniforms are gorgeous."
<P>
"Even the Prince," Penelope said thoughtfully, "must find some
reflection of the philosophy of his own country in such a scene
as this. For the last fortnight we have been surfeited with
horrors. We have had to go through all sorts of nameless things,"
she added, shivering slightly, "and tonight we dance at Devenham
House. We dance, and drink champagne, and marvel at the flowers,
as though we had not a care in the world, as though life moved
always to music."
<P>
Sir Charles frowned a little.
<P>
"The Prince again!" he said, half protesting. "He seems to be a
great deal in your thoughts lately, Penelope."
<P>
"Why not?" she answered. "It is something to meet a person whom
one is able to dislike. Nowadays the whole world is so amiable."
<P>
"I wonder how much you really do dislike him," he said.
<P>
She looked at him with a mysterious smile.
<P>
"Sometimes," she murmured softly, "I wonder that myself."
<P>
"Leaving the Prince out of the question," he continued, "what you
say is true enough. Only a few days ago, you had to attend that
awful inquest, and the last time I saw dear old Dicky Vanderpole,
he was looking forward to this very dance."
<P>
"It seems callous of us to have come," Penelope declared. "And
yet, if we hadn't, what difference would it have made? Every one
else would have been here. Our absence would never have been
noticed, and we should have sat at home and had the blues. But
all the same, life is cruel."
<P>
"Can't say I find much to grumble at myself," Sir Charles said
cheerfully. "I'm frightfully sorry about poor old Dicky, of
course, and every other decent fellow who doesn't get his show.
But, after all, it's no good being morbid. Sackcloth and ashes
benefit no one. Shall we have another turn?"
<P>
"Not yet," Penelope replied. "Wait till the crowd thins a little.
Tell me what you have been doing today?"
<P>
"Pretty strenuous time," Sir Charles remarked. "Up at nine,
played golf at Ranelagh all morning, lunched down there, back to
my rooms and changed, called on my tailor, went round to the
club, had one game of billiards and four rubbers of bridge."
<P>
"Is that all?" Penelope asked.
<P>
The faint sarcasm which lurked beneath her question passed
unnoticed. Sir Charles smiled good-humoredly.
<P>
"Not quite," he answered. "I dined at the Carlton with Bellairs
and some men from Woolwich and we had a box at the Empire to see
the new ballet. Jolly good it was, too. Will you come one night,
if I get up a party?"
<P>
"Oh, perhaps!" she answered. "Come and dance."
<P>
They passed into the great ballroom, the finest in London,
brilliant with its magnificent decorations of real flowers, its
crowd of uniformed men and beautiful women, its soft yet
ever-present throbbing of wonderful music. At the further end of
the room, on a slightly raised dais, still receiving her guests,
stood the Duchess of Devenham. Penelope gave a little start as
they saw who was bowing over her hand.
<P>
"The Prince!" she exclaimed.
<P>
Sir Charles whispered something a little under his breath.
<P>
"I wonder," she remarked with apparent irrelevance, "whether he
dances."
<P>
"Shall I go and find out for you?" Sir Charles asked.
<P>
She had suddenly grown absent. She had the air of scarcely
hearing what he said.
<P>
"Let us stop," she said. "I am out of breath."
<P>
He led her toward the winter garden. They sat by a fountain,
listening to the cool play of the water.
<P>
"Penelope," Somerfield said a little awkwardly, "I don't want to
presume, you know, nor to have you think that I am foolishly
jealous, but you have changed towards me the last few weeks,
haven't you?"
<P>
"The last few weeks," she answered, "have been enough to change
me toward any one. All the same, I wasn't conscious of anything
particular so far as you are concerned."
<P>
"I always thought," he continued after a moment's hesitation,
"that there was so much prejudice in your country
against--against all Asiatic races."
<P>
She looked at him steadfastly for a minute.
<P>
"So there is," she answered. "What of it?"
<P>
"Nothing, except that it is a prejudice which you do not seem to
share," he remarked.
<P>
"In a way I do share it," she declared, "but there are
exceptions, sometimes very wonderful exceptions."
<P>
"Prince Maiyo, for instance," he said bitterly. "Yet a fortnight
ago I could have sworn that you hated him."
<P>
"I think that I do hate him," Penelope affirmed. "I try to. I
want to. I honestly believe that he deserves my hatred. I have
more reason for feeling this way than you know of, Sir Charles."
<P>
"If he has dared--" Somerfield began.
<P>
"He has dared nothing that he ought not to," Penelope
interrupted. "His manners are altogether too perfect. It is the
chill faultlessness of the man which is so depressing. Can't you
understand," she added, speaking in a tone of greater intensity,
"that that is why I hate him? Hush!"
<P>
She gripped his sleeve warningly. There was suddenly the murmur
of voices and the trailing of skirts. A little party seemed to
have invaded the winter garden--a little party of the principal
guests. The Duchess herself came first, and her fingers were
resting upon the arm of Prince Maiyo. She stopped to speak to
Penelope, and turned afterwards to Somerfield. Prince Maiyo held
out his hand for Penelope's programme.
<P>
"You will spare me some dances?" he pleaded. "I come late, but it
is not my fault."
<P>
She yielded the programme to him without a word.
<P>
"Those with an X,'" she said, "are free. One has to protect
oneself."
<P>
He smiled as he wrote his own name, unrebuked, in four places.
<P>
"Our first dance, then, is number 10," he said. "It is the next
but one. I shall find you here, perhaps?"
<P>
"Here or amongst the chaperons," she answered, as they passed on.
<P>
"You admire Miss Morse?" the Duchess asked him.
<P>
"Greatly," the Prince answered. "She is natural, she has grace,
and she has what I do not find so much in this country--would you
say charm?"
<P>
"It is an excellent word," the Duchess answered. "I am inclined
to agree with you. Her aunt, with whom she lives, is a confirmed
invalid, so she is a good deal with me. Her mother was my
half-sister."
<P>
The Prince bowed.
<P>
"She will marry, I suppose?" he said.
<P>
"Naturally," the Duchess answered. "Sir Charles, poor fellow, is
a hopeless victim. I should not be surprised if she married him,
some day or other."
<P>
The Prince looked behind for a moment; then he stopped to admire
a magnificent orchid.
<P>
"It will be great good fortune for Sir Charles Somerfield," he
said.
<P>
Somerfield scarcely waited until the little party were out of
sight.
<P>
"Penelope," he exclaimed, "you've given that man four dances!"
<P>
"I am afraid," she answered, "that I should have given him eight
if he had asked for them."
<P>
He rose to his feet.
<P>
"Will you allow me to take you back to your aunt?" he asked.
<P>
"No!" she answered. "My aunt is quite happy without me, and I
should prefer to remain here."
<P>
He sat down, fuming.
<P>
"Penelope, what do you mean by it?" he demanded.
<P>
"And what do you mean by asking me what I mean by it?" she
replied. "You haven't any especial right that I know of."
<P>
"I wish to Heaven I had!" he answered with a noticeable break in
his voice.
<P>
There was a short silence. She turned away; she felt that she was
suddenly surrounded by a cloud of passion.
<P>
"Penelope," he pleaded,--
<P>
She stopped him.
<P>
"You must not say another word," she declared. "I mean it,--you
must not."
<P>
"I have waited for some time," he reminded her.
<P>
"All the more reason why you should wait until the right time,"
she insisted. "Be patient for a little longer, do. Just now I
feel that I need a friend more than I have ever needed one
before. Don't let me lose the one I value most. In a few weeks'
time you shall say whatever you like, and, at any rate, I will
listen to you. Will you be content with that?"
<P>
"Yes!" he answered.
<P>
She laid her fingers upon his arm.
<P>
"I am dancing this with Captain Wilmot," she said. "Will you come
and bring me back here afterwards, unless you are engaged?"
<P>
The Prince found her alone in the winter garden, for Somerfield,
when he had seen him coming, had stolen away. He came towards her
quickly, with the smooth yet impetuous step which singled him out
at once as un-English. He had the whole room to cross to come to
her, and she watched him all the way. The corners of his lips
were already curved in a slight smile. His eyes were bright, as
one who looks upon something which he greatly desires. Slender
though his figure was, his frame was splendidly knit, and he
carried himself as one of the aristocrats of the world. As he
approached, she scanned his face curiously. She became critical,
anxiously but ineffectively. There was not a feature in his face
with which a physiognomist could have found fault.
<P>
"Dear young lady," he said, bowing low, "I come to you very
humbly, for I am afraid that I am a deceiver. I shall rob you of
your pleasure, I fear. I have put my name down for four dances,
and, alas! I do not dance."
<P>
She made room for him by her side.
<P>
"And I," she said, "am weary of dancing. One does nothing else,
night after night. We will talk."
<P>
"Talk or be silent," he answered softly. "Myself I believe that
you are in need of silence. To be silent together is a proof of
great friendship, is it not?"
<P>
She nodded.
<P>
"It seems to me that I have been through so much the last
fortnight." she said.
<P>
"You have suffered where you should not have suffered," he
assented gravely. "I do not like your laws at all. At what they
called the inquest your presence was surely not necessary! You
were a woman and had no place there. You had," he added calmly,
"so little to tell."
<P>
"Nothing," she murmured.
<P>
"Life to me just now," he continued, "is so much a matter of
comparison. It is for that, indeed, that I am here. You see, I
have lived nearly all my life in my own country and only a very
short time in Europe. Then my mother was an English lady, and my
father a Japanese nobleman. Always I seem to be pulled two
different ways, to be struggling to see things from two different
points of view. But there is one subject in which I think I am
wholly with my own country."
<P>
"And that?" she asked.
<P>
"I do not think," he said, "that the rougher and more strenuous
paths of life were meant to be trodden by your sex. Please do not
misunderstand me," he went on earnestly. "I am not thinking of
the paths of literature and of art, for there the perceptions of
your sex are so marvellously acute that you indeed may often lead
where we must follow. I am speaking of the more material things
of life."
<P>
She was suddenly conscious of a shiver which seemed to spread
from her heart throughout her limbs. She sat quite still,
gripping her little lace handkerchief in her fingers.
<P>
"I mean," he continued, "the paths which a man must tread who
seeks to serve his country or his household,--the every-day life
in which sometimes intrigue or force is necessary. Do you agree
with me, Miss Morse?"
<P>
"I suppose so," she faltered.
<P>
"That is why," he added, "it was painful to me to see you stand
there before those men, answering their questions,--men whose
walk in life was different, of an order removed from yours, who
should not even have been permitted to approach you upon bended
knees. Do not think that I am suggesting any fault to you--do not
think that I am forcing your confidence in any way. But these are
the thoughts which came to me only a little time ago."
<P>
She was silent. They listened together to the splashing of the
water. What was the special gift, she wondered, which gave this
man such insight? She felt her heart beating; she was conscious
that he was looking at her. He knew already that it was through
her medium that those despatches which never reached London were
to have been handed on to their destination! He must know that
she was to some extent in the confidence of her country's
Ambassador! Perhaps he knew, too, those other thoughts which were
in her mind,--knew that it had been her deliberate intent to
deceive him, to pluck those secrets which he carried with him,
even from his heart! What a fool she had been to dream, for a
moment, of measuring her wits against his!
<P>
He began to speak again, and his voice seemed pitched in lighter
key.
<P>
"After all," he said, "you must think it strange of me to be so
egotistical--to speak all the time so much of my likes and
dislikes. To you I have been a little more outspoken than to
others."
<P>
"You have found me an interesting subject for investigation
perhaps?" she asked, looking up suddenly.
<P>
"You possess gifts," he admitted calmly, "which one does not find
amongst the womenfolk of my country, nor can I say that I have
found them to any extent amongst the ladies of the English
Court."
<P>
"Gifts of which you do not approve when possessed by my sex," she
suggested.
<P>
"You are a law to yourself, Miss Morse," he said. "What one would
not admire in others seems natural enough in you. You have brains
and you have insight. For that reason I have been with you a
little outspoken,--for that reason and another which I think you
know of. You see, my time over here grows nearer to an end with
every day. Soon I must carry away with me, over the seas, all the
delightful memories, the friendships, the affections, which have
made this country such a pleasant place for me."
<P>
"You are going soon?" she asked quickly.
<P>
"Very soon," he answered. "My work is nearly finished, if indeed
I may dignify it by the name of work. Then I must go back."
<P>
She shrank a little away from him, as though the word were
distasteful to her.
<P>
"Do you mean that you will go back for always?" she asked.
<P>
"There are many chances in life," he answered. "I am the servant
of the Emperor and my country."
<P>
"There is no hope, then," she continued, "of your settling down
here altogether?"
<P>
For once the marble immobility of his features seemed disturbed.
He looked at her in honest amazement.
<P>
"Here!" he exclaimed. "But I am a son of Japan!"
<P>
"There are many of your race who do live here," she reminded him.
<P>
He smiled with the air of one who is forced to humor a person of
limited vision.
<P>
"With them it is, alas! a matter of necessity," he said. "It is
very hard indeed to make you understand over here how we feel
about such things,--there seems to be a different spirit amongst
you Western races, a different spirit or a lack of spirit--I do
not know which I should say. But in Japan the love of our country
is a passion which seems to throb with every beat of our hearts.
If we leave her, it is for her good. When we go back, it is our
reward."
<P>
"Then you are here now for her good?" she asked.
<P>
"Assuredly," he answered.
<P>
"Tell me in what way?" she begged. "You have been studying
English customs, their methods of education, their political
life, perhaps?"
<P>
He turned his head slowly and looked into her eyes. She bore the
ordeal well, but she never forgot it. It seemed to her afterwards
that he must have read every thought which had flashed through
her brain. She felt like a little child in the presence of some
mysterious being, thoughts of whom had haunted her dreams, now
visible in bodily shape for the first time.
<P>
"My dear young lady," he said, "please do not ask me too much,
for I love to speak the truth, and there are many things which I
may not tell. Only you must understand that the country I
love--my own country--must enter soon upon a new phase of her
history. We who look into the future can see the great clouds
gathering. Some of us must needs be pioneers, must go forward a
little to learn our safest, and best course. May I tell you that
much?"
<P>
"Of course," she answered softly.
<P>
"And now," he added, leaving his seat as though with reluctance,
"the Duchess reminded me, above all things, that directly I found
you I was to take you to supper. One of your royal princes has
been good enough to signify his desire that we should sit at the
same table."
<P>
She rose at once.
<P>
"Does the Duchess know that you are taking me?" she asked.
<P>
"I arranged it with her," he answered. "My time draws soon to an
end and I am to be spoilt a little."
<P>
They crossed the ballroom together and mounted the great stairs.
Something--she never knew quite what it was--prompted her to
detain him as they paused on the threshold of the supper room.
<P>
"You do not often read the papers, Prince," she said. "Perhaps
you have not seen that, after all, the police have discovered a
clue to the Hamilton Fynes murder."
<P>
The Prince looked down upon her for a moment without reply.
<P>
"Yes?" he murmured softly.
<P>
She understood that she was to go on--that he was anxious for her
to go on.
<P>
"Some little doctor in a village near Willington, where the line
passes, has come forward with a story about attending to a
wounded man on the night of the murder," she said.
<P>
He was very silent. It seemed to her that there was something
strange about the immovability of his features. She looked at him
wonderingly. Then it suddenly flashed upon her that this was his
way of showing emotion. Her lips parted. The color seemed drawn
from her cheeks. The majordomo of the Duchess stood before them
with a bow.
<P>
"Her Grace desires me to show your Highness to your seats," he
announced.
<P>
Prince Maiyo turned to his companion.
<P>
"Will you allow me to precede you through the crush?" he said.
"We are to go this way."
<P>
