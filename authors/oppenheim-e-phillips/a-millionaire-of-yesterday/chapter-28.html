It was then perhaps that Trent fought the hardest battle of his
life.  The start was made with only a dozen Kru boys, Trent himself,
stripped to the shirt, labouring amongst them spade in hand.  In a
week the fishing boats were deserted, every one was working on the
road.  The labour was immense, but the wages were magnificent.  Real
progress was made and the boy's calculations were faultless.  Trent
used the cable freely.
<P>
"Have dismissed Cathcart for incompetence - road started - progress
magnificent," he wired one week, and shortly afterwards a message
came back - "Cathcart cables resigned - scheme impossible - shares
dropping - wire reply."
<P>
Trent clenched his fist, and his language made the boy, who had
never heard him violent, look up in surprise.  Then he put on his
coat and walked out to the cable station.
<P>
"Cathcart lies.  I dismissed him for cowardice and incompetence.
The road is being made and I pledge my word that it will be finished
in six months.  Let our friends sell no shares."
<P>
Then Trent went back and, hard as he had worked before, he surpassed
it all now.  Far and wide he sent ever with the same inquiry - for
labour and stores.  He spent money like water, but he spent from a
bottomless purse.  Day after day Kru boys, natives and Europeans
down on their luck, came creeping in.  Far away across the rolling
plain the straight belt of flint-laid road-bed stretched to the
horizon, one gang in advance cutting turf, another beating in the
small stones.  The boy grew thin and bronzed, Trent and he toiled
as though their lives hung upon the work.  So they went on till the
foremost gang came close to the forests, beyond which lay the
village of Bekwando.
<P>
Then began the period of the greatest anxiety, for Trent and the
boy and a handful of the others knew what would have sent half of
the natives flying from their work if a whisper had got abroad.  A
few soldiers were drafted down from the Fort, arms were given out
to all those who could be trusted to use them and by night men
watched by the great red fires which flared along the path of their
labours.  Trent and the boy took it by turns to watch, their
revolvers loaded by their side, and their eyes ever turned towards
that dark line of forest whence came nothing but the singing of
night birds and the calling of wild animals.  Yet Trent would have
no caution relaxed, the more they progressed.  the more vigilant
the watch they kept.  At last came signs of the men of Bekwando.
In the small hours of the morning a burning spear came hurtling
through the darkness and fell with a hiss and a quiver in the ground,
only a few feet from where Trent and the boy lay.  Trent stamped on
it hastily and gave no alarm.  But the boy stole round with a
whispered warning to those who could be trusted to fight.
<P>
Yet no attack came on that night or the next; on the third Trent
and the boy sat talking and the latter frankly owned that he was
nervous.
<P>
"It's not that I'm afraid," he said, smiling.  "You know it isn't
that!  But all day long I've had the same feeling - we're being
watched!  I'm perfectly certain that the beggars are skulking round
the borders of the forest there.  Before morning we shall hear
from them."
<P>
"If they mean to fight," Trent said, "the sooner they come out the
better.  I'd send a messenger to the King only I'm afraid they'd
kill him.  Oom Sam won't come!  I've sent for him twice."
<P>
The boy was looking backwards and forwards along the long line of
disembowelled earth.
<P>
"Trent," he said suddenly, "you're a wonderful man.  Honestly, this
road is a marvellous feat for untrained labour and with such rotten
odds and ends of machinery.  I don't know what experience you'd had
of road-making."
<P>
"None," Trent interjected.
<P>
"Then it's wonderful!"
<P>
Trent smiled upon the boy with such a smile as few people had ever
seen upon his lips.
<P>
"There's a bit of credit to you, Davenant," he said.  "I'd never
have been able to figure out the levelling alone.  Whether I go
down or not, this shall be a good step up on the ladder for you."
<P>
The boy laughed.
<P>
"I've enjoyed it more than anything else in my life," he said.
"Fancy the difference between this and life in a London office.
It's been magnificent!  I never dreamed what life was like before."
<P>
Trent looked thoughtfully into the red embers.  "You had the mail
to-day," the boy continued.  How were things in London?"
<P>
"Not so bad," Trent answered.  "Cathcart has been doing all the
harm he can, but it hasn't made a lot of difference.  My cables have
been published and our letters will be in print by now, and the
photographs you took of the work.  That was a splendid idea!"
<P>
"And the shares?"
<P>
"Down a bit - not much.  Da Souza seems to be selling out carefully
a few at a time, and my brokers are buying most of them.  Pound
shares are nineteen shillings to-day.  They'll be between three and
four pounds, a week after I get back."
<P>
"And when shall you go?" the boy asked.
<P>
"Directly I get a man out here I can trust and things are fixed with
his Majesty the King of Bekwando!  We'll both go then, and you shall
spend a week or two with me in London."
<P>
The boy laughed.
<P>
"What a time we'll have!" he cried.  "Say, do you know your way
round?"
<P>
Trent shook his head.
<P>
"I'm afraid not," he said.  "You'll have to be my guide."
<P>
"Right you are," was the cheerful answer.  "I'll take you to Jimmy's,
and the Empire, and down the river, and to a match at Lord's, and
to Henley if we're in time, and I'll take you to see my aunt!
You'll like her."
<P>
Trent nodded.
<P>
"I'll expect to," he said.  "Is she anything like you?"
<P>
"Much cleverer," the boy said, "but we've been great chums all our
life.  She's the cleverest woman ever knew, earns lots of money
writing for newspapers.
<P>
"Here, you've dropped your cigar, Trent."
<P>
Trent groped for it on the ground with shaking fingers.
<P>
"Writes for newspapers?" he repeated slowly. I wonder - her name
isn't Davenant, is it?"
<P>
The boy shook his head.
<P>
"No, she's my mother's cousin really - only I call her Aunty, we
always got on so.  She isn't really much older than me, her name is
Wendermott - Ernestine Wendermott.  Ernestine's a pretty name, don't
you think?"
<P>
Trent rose to his feet, muttering something about a sound in the
forest.  He stood with his back to the boy looking steadily at the
dark line of outlying scrub, seeing in reality nothing, yet keenly
anxious that the red light of the dancing flames should not fall
upon his face.  The boy leaned on his elbow and looked in the same
direction.  He was puzzled by a fugitive something which he had
seen in Trent's face.
<P>
Afterwards Trent liked sometimes to think that it was the sound of
her name which had saved them all.  For, whereas his gaze had been
idle at first, it became suddenly fixed and keen.  He stooped down
and whispered something to the boy.  The word was passed along the
line of sleeping men and one by one they dropped back into the
deep-cut trench.  The red fire danced and crackled - only a few
yards outside the flame-lit space came the dark forms of men
creeping through the rough grass like snakes.
