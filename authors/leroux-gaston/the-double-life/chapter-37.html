<p>M. <em>THEOPHRASTE LONGUET </em>had by this time quite forgotten
the ties which bound him to the world above, and while M. Mifroid
was abandoning himself to the fancies of Lady de Montfort, he
was indulging in excesses of debauchery with the Talfa people.</p>

<p>The time came when M. Mifroid became tired of this kind of life.
They had been in the catacombs three weeks and had become acquainted
with the habits of all the Talfa people. M. Mifroid longed to
get into the open world, where people had public affairs and a
properly organized society. He felt confused, and a feeling of
weariness came over him.</p>

<p>Théophraste was for stopping there altogether. He said he had
never had such a time before. He had been playing the tricks of
Cartouche on the Talfa people, and he felt more free in spirits
than he had felt on earth. He was so persistent In his determination
to stay that M. Mifroid decided to appeal to Mlle de Coucy. He
felt that Théophraste was a nuisance to the Talfa, and the best
way to get him out was to appeal to the people themselves. Théophraste
had even suggested putting out his own eyes to be like these people.</p>

<p>Upon telling Mlle, de Coucy, however, he got a totally different
answer than he expected. She told him that the Talfa people had
decided to let them go as soon as twenty thousand people had passed
their fingers over their faces. She explained that the Talfa had
forever been trying to get into the upper world, and therefore
they must all visit these men from the coveted realms and see
what they looked like before their departure.</p>

<p>M. Mifroid calculated that it would take some time to complete
this ceremony, and so he devised a plan by which they could deceive
the people and escape. They were never long alone, and all day
and all night fingers were feeling their faces and were thrust
into their eyes, nose or mouth. It was during these operations
one night that M. Mifroid devised his plan of escape. He would
utilize his powers as a sculptor.</p>

<p>Obtaining some clay from the bed of the lake he modeled two masks
like those of the Talfa people with large noses and ears. Then
under the pretense of acquiescing in Théophraste’s wishes, who
dreamed only of becoming a Talfa, he put one of the masks on his
face, and the other he wore himself. The deception was perfect,
and although they met several Talfa they were not recognized,
in spite of much finger feeling.</p>

<p>M. Mifroid took the precaution of providing himself with food,
and they both started out. Théophraste laughed with delight at
the bold deception, and in his merriment he did not realize that
M. Mifroid had led him out of the domains of the Talfa. They walked
for five days. Their eyes had by this time become accustomed to
the darkness, and they were able to make good headway. On the
fifth day they came across some human bones, and M. Mifroid uttered
a prayer of thankfulness, for here were signs of a civilized people.
They were on the outskirts of the city of Ossarium.</p>

<p>Théophraste had been in a very depressed state of mind since
leaving the Talfa. He had continually reproached M. Mifroid for
getting him away. Upon coming upon the first signs of human existence,
M. Mifroid drew his attention to them and declared that in a short
time they would be out in the light of day again.</p>

<p>Soon they came across a skull with the signs of a candle near
it, showing Catholic burial, then the gallery seemed to dip down,
the ground became wet, and they found themselves wading through
mire. Water dripped on them from crevices above, and the air became
cold and damp. At last M. Mifroid recognized a part of the gallery,
and again he sent a prayer up to heaven for his deliverance.</p>

<p>There was a Latin inscription cut out of the rock: "Ossa arida
audite verbum Domini," which M. Mifroid recognized as being near
an entrance to the catacombs.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far when voices were heard, and they found
themselves in a large vault. This was a very different place than
the hall of the Talfa, though. There were ordinary human beings
here. Through the whole length of the hall chairs were arranged.
The place was lit up by numerous candles enclosed in human skulls.
At the end was a kind of rotunda where evidently the musicians
sat, for a large circle of music-stands were arranged. A number
of people were present getting ready for a feast. No one took
any notice of the two strangers, as it was thought that they were
invited guests, and they strolled through, watching the proceedings.
Soon the musicians began to arrive one by one, and the people
sat around making pleasantries, and passing the time away in talk.
It was half-past one.</p>

<p>It was indeed a curious sight. Here down among the dead, with
coffins and bones all around, had assembled a crowd to listen
to music, and to make revelry. Fifty musicians had assembled,
among whom M. Mifroid recognized many of the orchestra of the
Opera House.</p>

<p>Soon the music started, Chopin’s "Dead March" being the first
piece. After listening for some time M. Mifroid tapped Théophraste
on the shoulder, whispering to him that it was time to go. They
hurried along, and ten minutes later they found themselves on
the earth again.</p>

<p>They walked together for about half an hour, neither uttering
a word. They were both thinking what a wonderful experience they
had gone through. The Talfa nation, with its peculiar habits,
had impressed them wonderfully, and neither wished to disturb
the other in contemplation of it all.</p>

<p>Suddenly Théophraste said: "What are you waiting for, M. Mifroid?
Do you intend to arrest me?"</p>

<p>M. Mifroid had, in the emotion of the moment, forgotten his original
mission. He, however, had become very friendly with Théophraste
in the catacombs, in spite of his excesses, and so, now that he
was confronted with the necessity of arresting him, he said: "No,
my friend, I shall not arrest you. My mission was to arrest Cartouche,
but as Cartouche is no more, I cannot arrest him. Besides, you,
M. Longuet, are my friend."</p>

<p>They then parted at the Buci Crossway.</p>
