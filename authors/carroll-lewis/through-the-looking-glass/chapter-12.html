    `Your majesty shouldn't purr so loud,' Alice said, rubbing her
    eyes, and addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some
    severity. `You woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! And you've
    been along with me, Kitty -- all through the Looking-Glass world.
    Did you know it, dear?'
    <P>
      It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made
      the remark) that, whatever you say to them, they Always purr.
      `If them would only purr for "yes" and mew for "no," or any rule
      of that sort,' she had said, `so that one could keep up a
      conversation! But how <I>can</I> you talk with a person if they always
      say the same thing?'
    <P>
      On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible
      to guess whether it meant `yes' or `no.'
    <P>
      So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had
      found the Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the
      hearth-rug, and put the kitten and the Queen to look at each
      other. "Now, Kitty!' she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly.
      `Confess that was what you turned into!'
    <P>
      (`But it wouldn't look at it,' she said, when she was
      explaining the thing afterwards to her sister: `it turned away
      its head, and pretended not to see it: but it looked a <I>little</I>
      ashamed of itself, so I think it <I>must</I> have been the Red Queen.')
    <P>
      `Sit up a little more stiffly, dear!' Alice cried with a merry
      laugh. `And curtsey while you're thinking what to -- what to
      purr. It saves time, remember!' And she caught it up and gave
      it one little kiss, `just in honour of having been a Red Queen.'
    <P>
      `Snowdrop, my pet!' she went on, looking over her shoulder at
      the White Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its
      toilet, `when <I>will</I> Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I
      wonder? That must be the reason you were so untidy in my dream -
      - Dinah! do you know that you're scrubbing a White Queen?
      Really, it's most disrespectful of you!
    <P>
      `And what did <I>dinah</I> turn to, I wonder?' she prattled on, as she
      settled comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin
      in her hand, to watch the kittens. `Tell me, Dinah, did you turn
      to Humpty Dumpty? I <I>think</I> you did -- however, you'd better not
      mention it to your friends just yet, for I'm not sure.
    <P>
      `By the way, Kitty, of only you'd been really with me in my
      dream, there was one thing you <I>would</I> have enjoyed -- I had such a
      quantity of poetry said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow
      morning you shall have a real treat. All the time you're eating
      your breakfast, I'll repeat "The Walrus and the Carpenter" to
      you; and then you can make believe it's oysters, dear!
    <P>
      `Now, Kitty, let's consider who it was that dreamed it all.
      This is a serious question, my dear, and you should <I>not</I> go on
      licking your paw like that -- as if Dinah hadn't washed you this
      morning! You see, Kitty, it <I>must</I> have been either me or the Red
      King. He was part of my dream, of course -- but then I was part
      of his dream, too! <I>was</I> it the Red King, Kitty. You were his
      wife, my dear, so you ought to know -- Oh, Kitty, <I>do</I> help to
      settle it! I'm sure your paw can wait!' But the provoking
      kitten only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn't heard
      the question.
    <P>
      Which do <I>you</I> think it was?

      <P>
        A boat beneath a sunny sky,<BR>
        Lingering onward dreamily<BR>
        In an evening of July --
      <P>
        Children three that nestle near,<BR>
        Eager eye and willing ear,<BR>
        Pleased a simple tale to hear --
      <P>
        Long had paled that sunny sky:<BR>
        Echoes fade and memories die.<BR>
        Autumn frosts have slain July.
      <P>
        Still she haunts me, phantomwise,<BR>
        Alice moving under skies<BR>
        Never seen by waking eyes.
      <P>
        Children yet, the tale to hear,<BR>
        Eager eye and willing ear,<BR>
        Lovingly shall nestle near.
      <P>
        In a Wonderland they lie,<BR>
        Dreaming as the days go by,<BR>
        Dreaming as the summers die:
      <P>
        Ever drifting down the stream --<BR>
        Lingering in the golden gleam --<BR>
        Life, what is it but a dream?
      <P>
