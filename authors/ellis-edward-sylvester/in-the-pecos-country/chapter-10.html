<p>Lone Wolf recognized the taunt of his old enemy, and his black
eye lit up with a gleam of fire and passion. He would not turn
his back upon his white foe, who had just sent a bullet in quest
of his heart. He would accept the gage of battle, and end his
personal warfare of years. But, like all Indians, the chieftain
was the personification of treachery, without a particle of chivalry
or manhood, and when he resolved upon his attempt to destroy the
frontiersman, it was without any regard for the fairness of the
means which he should employ.</p>

<p>He handed the boy to one of the warriors sitting near him, as,
of course, he could do nothing when impeded by his presence, although
he had proved very convenient some time before, in the way of
a shield. Then he said something to a dozen or so of the warriors
immediately around him. The main body remained comparatively motionless,
while the chief rode out in advance and headed toward his antagonist,
his horse upon a slow walk, and moving with great caution.</p>

<p>Sut Simpson was not to be caught napping. No one understood the
sneaking character of Lone Wolf better than did he. He had had
it back and forth with him too many times not to be able to read
the fellow through and through.</p>

<p>While the leader was coming forward in this cautious manner,
he saw several other horsemen in motion. Their direction was not
the same as their leader. They appeared to be riding further back
upon the prairie, as though they had been sent upon some errand
to a distant point. But Sut knew what it meant. They meant to
steal away until they were out of sight, when they would come
around behind him. There were enough to surround him completely
and to cut off his escape in any direction.</p>

<p>Sut saw all this and was not surprised thereat. He believed that
he was too old a bird to be caught with such chaff. The manner
in which he could defeat the purpose of Lone Wolf was by direct
fight, or by forcing him into a combat which would anticipate
the intention of the Apache. He preferred the latter course, and
he made the effort in the common Indian way, by uttering a taunt,
still using the Apache tongue.</p>

<p>"Lone Wolf is a coward and a dog! He is afraid of the white hunter!
He stays by his warriors, that they may hold his head when his
heart grows faint at sight of his pale-face foe."</p>

<p>Anyone who understands the temper of an Indian will see that
such a taunt as this was of the most exasperating nature. It rankled
deeply in the heart of Lone Wolf, who would have given a dozen
of his best warriors for the chance of burying his tomahawk in
the skull of his foe; but he was too cunning to be misled by his
desire for revenge. He, too, indulged in a little of the taunting
business himself; and, as the hunter had honored him by speaking
in the Apache language, he "threw himself," so to speak, in English.</p>

<p>"The white hunter is afraid of Lone Wolf. He dreads his scalping-knife.
His heart trembles, and he knows not where to hide himself."</p>

<p>"He does not hide from Lone Wolf, for he has hunted days and
nights to find him, and when Lone Wolf saw him coming, he ran
among his warriors and hid."</p>

<p>"He is not among them now," retorted Lone Wolf; "while he seeks
Sut Simpson, the brave hunter moves away."</p>

<p>Such was really the case. Judged from a superficial standpoint,
the greatest show of courage was made by the Apache, whose horse
was moving forward at a slow, cautious pace, while the mustang
of Sut Simpson kept up a continued and equally guarded retreat,
so that the distance between the two taunting enemies remained
about the same. The hunter had a manifest purpose in this, which
was simply to draw his foe far enough away from his support to
gain a chance for a sudden dash at him before he could elude him.
At the same time he did not forget the dozen horsemen that had
stolen out so cautiously from the rear, and he knew that "if it
were done, then 'twere well it were done quickly," as Macbeth
so aptly puts it.</p>

<p>Sut carefully measured the intervening space with his eye, but
Lone Wolf was still too near his reserve. The two men were eying
each other like cats, and, although he taunted so loudly, yet
no one would have been readier than the Apache to flee if he believed
that he was in greater peril than his antagonist.</p>

<p>"Why does not Lone Wolf move faster?" asked Sut, hoping to spur
him into doing so.</p>

<p>"Why does not the hunter wait for him?" asked the chief, very
appropriately, in return.</p>

<p>The scout thought that if he could draw the savage a few yards
further he would have him just where he wanted him. Feeling how
precious the passing time was, he galloped his mustang a rod or
so and then came to a sudden abrupt halt.</p>

<p>"Here I'll await you, you old copper-skinned hoodlum!" he called
out, in unmistakable English.</p>

<p>Lone Wolf did not check his speed; nor, on the other hand, did
he hasten it. Let alone, he was sure to reach the proper point
in due time; but the trouble was that Sut had no time to spare.
The dozen horsemen who were making their circuit must have accomplished
considerable of it already, and would soon be closing in around
him.</p>

<p>The hunter had been caught in just such predicaments many a time
before, and had managed to pull through without material injury;
but no brave man who was possessed of ordinary sense would willingly
allow himself to be drawn into such a trap. The Apaches were as
good riders as he, and a shot that would disable his horse would
play mischief with the rider. He wished to avoid any such snarl,
and so he dallied and trifled with his adversary in the hope of
trolling him along to a point where he could hold him, while the
Indian continued his advance like one whose only purpose was to
hold his man until the other warriors could close in behind him.
The moment speedily came when it would not have been best to wait
a second longer.</p>

<p>Wheeling his horse with the suddenness of lightning, Simpson
charged at full speed straight at Lone Wolf. The latter was surprised
by the movement, but he was not thrown off his guard, nor did
he seek to fall back on his reserves. It would be time enough
to do that when he should become convinced of its necessity; besides
which, he had only to keep the hunter engaged for a brief time
in order to give his horsemen the chance to entrap him.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the deceitful character of the chief, Sut waited
until he was within a short distance, when he wheeled and let
drive with a couple chambers of his revolver. Lone Wolf went over
the side of his mustang so suddenly that the hunter believed he
had been killed; but, as he checked himself before reaching the
ground, he saw his mistake, and knew that the savage's "reply"
would be forthcoming on the instant. Accordingly, Sut followed
suit and interposed the body of his mustang like a flash between
himself and the red-skin.</p>

<p>He was not a wink too soon. Just as he went over he caught the
flash, and heard the report of a pistol. The chief had fired from
beneath the neck of his steed, with his revolver&mdash;for Lone Wolf
carried his revolver, like any other gentleman of the plains.</p>

<p>This was complicating matters so much that the hunter determined
to force conclusions without a moment's delay.</p>

<p>There was no use of firing at the Indian as long as he was protected
by his horse. He was to cunning to be caught napping. So, without
a particle of hesitation, Sut threw the muzzle of his rifle beneath
the neck of his steed, and fired straight at the one which was
sheltering his adversary.</p>

<p>The shot was fatal, and, with a frenzied leap, the animal stumbled
forward upon his neck, and fell dead in his tracks. Nimble Lone
Wolf threw himself as quick as a flash from beneath the falling
body, and, conscious of his disadvantage, started on a run for
the main body of warriors; but Sut, with extraordinary shrewdness,
had anticipated this very thing, and, assisted by the intelligence
of his animal, he threw himself ahead of him, so as to shut off
the flight in that direction.</p>

<p>Everything now went with bewildering swiftness. The Apaches,
seeing their chief environed, rode forward to his assistance,
while the hunter, revolver in hand, blazed away at him, determined
to bring him to earth, now that he had the chance. The activity
of Lone Wolf was simply marvelous.</p>

<p>He darted here and there, dodged back and forth, and once or
twice actually shot beneath the belly of his adversary's mustang.
His antics were confusing, and, although Sut succeeded in wounding
him, it seemed utterly impossible to disable him.</p>

<p>The hunter had already discharged his rifle when he slew the
horse, and when he emptied his revolver, he was chagrined, furious,
and baffled.</p>

<p>"I believe you're the devil himself!" he exclaimed, ceasing his
efforts to bring him down, "and I'll let you go this time!"</p>

<p>He turned to flee when he saw that the Apaches were all about
him.</p>
