<p>The young hunters now asked themselves whether it was worth while
to try to find out who had fired the gun whose report broke in
upon them with such startling suddenness.</p>

<p>It was not at all unlikely that some of their friends from the
settlement up the river, or from the scattered cabins, were out
on a hunt through the woods.</p>

<p>But when young George blurted out his belief that it was an Indian
who had fired the weapon, he uttered the very thought that was
in the mind of Jack.</p>

<p>Ever since his meeting with the Wyandot chief and his son that
morning he had been uneasy in mind.  There were times when he
would not think about the red men, but very soon his thoughts
went back to the subject.</p>

<p>His misgiving may be understood when I repeat what I have already
hinted, namely, that the presence of Hua-awa-oma and his son in
the neighbourhood of the two cabins meant that a band of his warriors
were not far away.  The Wyandots, as you have already learned,
were among the fiercest enemies of the settlers, and the painted
faces of the chieftain and his son made it look as if the latter
was on his first war path.</p>

<p>All this might be hard to explain in the light of the treatment
received by Jack at the hands of Hua-awa-oma, or "He who fights
without falling" but still it was not inexplainable.  More than
likely the chief gave back the gun as part punishment to his boy
because he was beaten so badly in the wrestling bout.</p>

<p>Probably the dusky leader felt so much faith in his own place
at the head of a war party of Wyandots that he believed it safe
to indulge such a whim, believing as he did that not only the
rifle but also the boy himself would be at his disposal whenever
he cared to claim them.</p>

<p>"If there are Indians near us," said Jack, "we ought to know
it, so as to be able to keep out of their way."</p>

<p>"They must have heard our guns, since we heard one of theirs,"
remarked Will.</p>

<p>"If they are white men, we ought to know that too," added George.</p>

<p>"Well, if we are careful I guess we can find out. Come on."</p>

<p>Jack led the way back to the path which they had followed for
some distance, and crossing it, plunged into the wood on the other
side. They had gone only a short way when the ground grew rougher,
and sloped upward like a ridge.  They pushed on until they reached
the top of an elevation of several hundred feet.</p>

<p>Beyond this the land sloped off again into a valley, fully a
half mile in width, beyond which it rose almost to the same height
as the surface on which they stood.</p>

<p>The spot where they halted was so open and free from undergrowth
that they had a good view of the small valley spread out before
them, and over which they gazed with keen interest.</p>

<p>"Hallo, there they are!" whispered Will.</p>

<p>Following the direction of his finger, his companions saw near
the middle of the valley a column of smoke ascending from among
the trees, and lazily mingling with the air above, where it rested
almost stationary, as though it had been there for hours.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jack, "a camp fire is there, but we don’t know whether
it belongs to Indians or white men."</p>

<p>"That’s what we have come to find out."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said George, "that instead of going down together
we ought to separate.  What do you think, Jack?"</p>

<p>"It strikes me as a good plan; if we keep together it will be
hard work for us to find out what we want to know without letting
the Indians&mdash;if they are Indians&mdash;find out more than we want them
to learn about us."</p>

<p>"That is good enough," observed Will, to whom the others looked
to hear his opinion, "and I guess we may as well try it; but if
we separate we have got to be mighty careful that we don’t run
into danger before we know it.  I will turn to the right, you,
Jack, to the left, while George can push straight down into the
valley; we must be on the watch all the time. As soon as one of
us sees anything that tells what we want to know, he must turn
back to this place and wait for the others."</p>

<p>"The first one who finds the camp and learns who started it ought
to signal to the others, so that they need not run any more risk."</p>

<p>"We will do that," said Jack; "and that is likely to be George,
because he has a shorter distance than either of us to travel."</p>

<p>"What shall be the signal?"</p>

<p>Jack placed his two hands in front of his mouth, the palms curved
toward each other, so that a hollow space was enclosed, the thumbs
being in front.  Pressing his lips against these, he blew gently,
and made a soft, deep whistle, whose volume he could increase
until it was audible for several hundred yards.</p>

<p>While the call thus made bore little resemblance to that of any
animal or bird, it had the advantage of being hard to locate. 
That is, if a person should detect it in the forest it would require
the closest attention, and then would have to be repeated several
times before the hearer could fix the exact spot whence it came.</p>

<p>"You know how to do that?" he said, looking inquiringly at the
brothers.</p>

<p>By way of reply, each fashioned his hands as Jack had done, and,
with the lips against the thumbs, emitted a precisely similar
sound.</p>

<p>"That’s it," he said.  "It is understood then that the first
one who finds out what we want to know is to start straight back
to this spot, and as soon as he reaches a point where it is safe
to make the signal he will do so.  Neither of the others will
be too far off to hear, and will hurry back.  Then, after we learn
the truth, we’ll settle what is best to be done."</p>

<p>All this was simple enough, and when each had added several cautions
to the others they silently parted company.</p>

<p>You will see from what has been told that there was reason to
believe that George Burton, who took the direct course to the
camp fire, would be the first to reach it.  Indeed, the others
were so confident of his doing so that they were rather indifferent
to their own progress.</p>

<p>Feeling the responsibility on him, young George acted like an
old campaigner, using more care than seemed necessary at first;
but he had felt quite sure from the beginning that they were near
a party of Indian warriors, and he did not mean to betray himself
and friends into their hands by any lack of caution. He was glad
to see, after going a short distance down the slope, that there
was an increase of undergrowth. This gave him a better chance
to keep his body screened while approaching the camp.</p>

<p>"Whatever happens," was his thought, "it shan’t be said that
<em>I</em> was the cause of Jack and Will getting into trouble. 
If there are a party of Indians tramping through here, it is for
no good, and the best thing we can do is to get back home as quick
as we know how."</p>

<p>At the end of a quarter of an hour he thought he must be close
to the camp.  Since coming down into the valley he was unable
to see the smoke that was in such plain sight when they were on
top of the ridge, but he used his keen eyes and sense of hearing
with a skill that an Indian scout would have found hard to surpass.</p>

<p>"It must be close at hand&mdash;<em>sh</em>!"</p>

<p>Sure enough, he had not gone five steps farther when he came
in full view of the camp.</p>

<p>In the middle of a small open space a number of sticks had been
piled together and kindled an hour or two before.  This was plain,
not only from the number of burnt-out embers and brands, but from
the appearance of the smoke above the trees as already described.</p>

<p>On a fallen tree, near the fire, sat three Indian warriors, talking
together in their low guttural voices. Another was in the act
of stooping down and lighting his long-stemmed pipe, while a fifth
was standing a few feet away, examining his rifle&mdash;this being
all that were in sight.</p>

<p>Each was in his war paint, and, young as was George Burton, he
was certain that they were but a fraction of the party that was
in the woods bent on mischief.</p>

<p>"They must be Wyandots," he thought, forming this opinion from
the story told by Jack of his encounter that morning; "and we
must get home as fast as we can, and tell the folk."</p>

<p>Full of this purpose, he turned softly about to hasten back,
when he found himself face to face with a gigantic and scowling
Indian warrior! </p>
