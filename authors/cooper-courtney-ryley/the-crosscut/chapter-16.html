<p>Fairchild blinked in surprise at this and sank back into his chair.
Finally he laughed uneasily and puffed again on the dubious cigar.
</p>
<p>"I 'd say," came finally, "that there is n't any such animal."
</p><p>"But there is.  She has--"  Then he stopped, as though to cover the
slip.  Fairchild leaned forward.
</p><p>"She?"
</p><p>Mr. Barnham gave the appearance of a very flustered man.
</p><p>"My tongue got away from me; I should n't have said it.  I really
should n't have said it.  If she ever finds it out, it will mean
trouble for me.  But truly," and he beamed, "you are such a tough
customer to deal with and so suspicious--no offense meant, of
course--that I really was forced to it.  I--feel sure she will forgive
me."
</p><p>"Whom do you mean by 'she'?"
</p><p>Mr. Barnham smiled in a knowing manner.
</p><p>"You and I both know," came his cryptic answer.  "She is your one
great, good friend.  She thinks a great deal of you, and you have done
several things to cause that admiration.  Now, Mr. Fairchild, coming to
the point, suppose she should point a way out of your troubles?"
</p><p>"How?"
</p><p>"In the first place, you and your partner are in very great
difficulties."
</p><p>"Are we?"  Fairchild said it sarcastically.
</p><p>"Indeed you are, and there is no need of attempting to conceal the
fact.  Your friend, whose name must remain a secret, does not love
you--don't ever think that--but--"
</p><p>Then he hesitated as though to watch the effect on Fairchild's face.
There was none; Robert had masked it.  In time the words went on: "But
she does think enough of you to want to make you happy.  She has
recently done a thing which gives her a great deal of power in one
direction.  In another, she has connections who possess vast money
powers and who are looking for an opening here in the west.  Now,--" he
made a church steeple out of his fingers and leaned back in his chair,
staring vacuously at the ceiling, "if you will say the word and do a
thing which will relieve her of a great deal of embarrassment, I am
sure that she can so arrange things that life will be very easy for you
henceforth."
</p><p>"I 'm becoming interested."
</p><p>"In the first place, she is engaged to be married to a very fine young
man.  You, of course, may say differently, and I do not know--I am only
taking her word for it.  But--if I understand it, your presence in
Ohadi has caused a few disagreements between them and--well, you know
how willful and headstrong girls will be.  I believe she has committed
a few--er--indiscretions with you."
</p><p>"That's a lie!"  Fairchild's temper got away from him and his fist
banged on the table.  "That's a lie and you know it!"
</p><p>"Pardon me--er--pardon me!  I made use of a word that can have many
meanings, and I am sure that in using it, I did n't place the same
construction that you did in hearing it.  But let that pass.  I
apologize.  What I should have said was that, if you will pardon me,
she used you, as young women will do, as a foil against her fianc√© in a
time of petty quarreling between them.  Is that plainer?"
</p><p>It was too plain to Fairchild.  It hurt.  But he nodded his head and
the other man went on.
</p><p>"Now the thing has progressed to a place where you may be--well--what
one might call the thorn in the side of their happiness.  You are the
'other man', as it were, to cause quarrels and that sort of thing.  And
she feels that she has not done rightly by you, and, through her
friendship and a desire to see peace all around, believes she can
arrange matters to suit all concerned.  To be plain and blunt, Mr.
Fairchild, you are not in an enviable position.  I said that I had
information for you, and I 'm going to give it.  You are trying to work
a mine.  That demands capital.  You have n't got it and there is no way
for you to procure it.  To get capital, one must have standing--and you
must admit that you are lacking to a great extent in that very
necessary ingredient.  In the first place, your mine is in escrow,
being held in court in lieu of five thousand dollars bond on--"
</p><p>"You seem to have been making a few inquiries?"
</p><p>"Not at all.  I never heard of the proposition before she brought it to
me.  As I say, the deeds to your mine are held in escrow.  Your partner
now is accused of four crimes and will go to trial on them in the fall.
It is almost certain that he will be convicted on at least one of the
charges.  That would mean that the deeds to the mine must remain in
jurisdiction of the court in lieu of a cash bond while the case goes to
the Supreme Court.  Otherwise, you must yield over your partner to go
to jail.  In either event, the result would not be satisfactory.  For
yourself, I dare say that a person whose father is supposed to have
committed a murder--not that I say he did it, understand--hardly could
establish sufficient standing to borrow the money to proceed on an
undertaking which requires capital.  Therefore, I should say that you
were in somewhat of a predicament.  Now--" a long wait and then,
"please take this as only coming from a spokesman: My client is in a
position to use her good offices to change the viewpoint of the man who
is the chief witness against your partner.  She also is in a position
to use those same good offices in another direction, so that there
might never be a grand jury investigation of the finding of a certain
body or skeleton, or something of the kind, in your mine--which, if you
will remember, brought about a very disagreeable situation.  And
through her very good connections in another way, she is able to
relieve you of all your financial embarrassment and procure for you
from a certain eastern syndicate, the members of which I am not at
liberty to name, an offer of $200,000 for your mine.  All that is
necessary for you to do is to say the word."
</p><p>Fairchild leaned forward.
</p><p>"And of course," he said caustically, "the name of this mysterious
feminine friend must be a secret?"
</p><p>"Certainly.  No mention of this transaction must be made to her
directly, or indirectly.  Those are my specific instructions.  Now, Mr.
Fairchild, that seems to me to be a wonderful offer.  And it--"
</p><p>"Do you want my answer now?"
</p><p>"At any time when you have given the matter sufficient thought."
</p><p>"That's been accomplished already.  And there 's no need of waiting.  I
want to thank you exceedingly for your offer, and to tell you--that you
can go straight to hell!"
</p><p>And without looking back to see the result of his ultimatum, Fairchild
rose, strode to the door, unlocked it, and stamped down the hall.  He
had taken snap judgment, but in his heart, he felt that he was right.
What was more, he was as sure as he was sure of life itself that Anita
Richmond had not arranged the interview and did not even know of it.
One streaking name was flitting through Fairchild's brain and causing
it to seethe with anger.  Cleverly concealed though the plan might have
been, nicely arranged and carefully planted, to Robert Fairchild it all
stood out plainly and clearly--the Rodaines!
</p><p>And yet why?  That one little word halted Fairchild as he left the
elevator.  Why should the Rodaines be willing to free him from all the
troubles into which his mining ventures had taken him, start him out
into the world and give him a fortune with which to make his way
forward?  Why?  What did they know about the Blue Poppy mine, when
neither he nor Harry had any idea of what the future might hold for
them there?  Certainly they could not have investigated in the years
that were gone; the cave-in precluded that.  There was no other tunnel,
no other means of determining the riches which might be hidden within
the confines of the Blue Poppy claims, yet it was evident.  That day in
court Rodaine had said that the Blue Poppy was a good property and that
it was worth every cent of the value which had been placed on it.  How
did he know?  And why--?
</p><p>At least one answer to Rodaine's action came to him.  It was simple now
to see why the scar-faced man had put a good valuation on the mine
during the court procedure and apparently helped Fairchild out in a
difficulty.  In fact, there were several reasons for it.  In the first
place, the tying up of the mine by placing it in the care of a court
would mean just that many more difficulties for Fairchild, and it would
mean that the mine would be placed in a position where work could be
hampered for years if a first conviction could be obtained.  Further,
Rodaine could see that if by any chance the bond should be forfeited,
it would be an easy matter for the claims to be purchased cheap at a
public sale by any one who desired them and who had the inside
information of what they were worth.  And evidently Rodaine and Rodaine
alone possessed that knowledge.
</p><p>It was late now.  Fairchild went to a junk yard or two, searching for
the materials which Harry had ordered, and failed to find them.  Then
he sought a hotel, once more to struggle with the problems which the
interview with Barnham had created and to cringe at a thought which
arose like a ghost before him:
</p><p>Suppose that it had been Anita Richmond after all who had arranged
this?  It was logical in a way.  Maurice Rodaine was the one man who
could give direct evidence against Harry as the man who had held up the
Old Times Dance, and Anita now was engaged to marry him.  Judge
Richmond had been a friend of Thornton Fairchild; could it have been
possible that this friendship might have entailed the telling of
secrets which had not been related to any one else?  The matter of the
finding of the skeleton could be handled easily, Fairchild saw, through
Maurice Rodaine.  One word from him to his father could change the
story of Crazy Laura and make it, on the second telling, only the
maundering tale of an insane, herb-gathering woman.  Anita could have
arranged it, and Anita might have arranged it.  Fairchild wished now
that he could recall his words, that he could have held his temper and
by some sort of strategy arranged matters so that the offer might have
come more directly--from Anita herself.
</p><p>Yet, why should she have gone through this procedure to reach him?  Why
had she not gone to Farrell with the proposition--to a man whom she
knew Fairchild trusted, instead of to a greasy, hand rubbing shyster?
And besides--
</p><p>But the question was past answering now.  Fairchild had made his
decision, and he had told the lawyer where to go.  If, at the same
time, he had relegated the woman who had awakened affection in his
heart, only to have circumstances do their best to stamp it out again,
to the same place,--well, that had been done, too, and there was no
recalling of it now.  But one thing was certain: the Blue Poppy mine
was worth money.  Somewhere in that beetling hill awaited wealth, and
if determination counted for anything, if force of will and force of
muscle were worth only a part of their accepted value, Fairchild meant
to find it.  Once before an offer had come, and now that he thought of
it, Fairchild felt almost certain that it had been from the same
source.  That was for fifty thousand dollars.  Why should the value
have now jumped to four times its original figures?  It was more than
the adventurer could encompass; he sought to dismiss it all, went to a
picture show, then trudged back to his hotel and to sleep.
</p><p>The next day found him still striving to put the problem away from him
as he went about the various errands outlined by Harry.  A day after
that, then the puffing, snorting, narrow-gauged train took him again
through Clear Creek ca√±on and back to Ohadi.  The station was strangely
deserted.
</p><p>None of the usual loungers were there.  None of the loiterers who,
watch in hand, awaited the arrival and departure of the puffing train
as though it were a matter of personal concern.  Only the bawling 'bus
man for the hotel, the station agent wrestling with a trunk or
two,--that was all.  Fairchild looked about him in surprise, then
approached the agent.
</p><p>"What's happened?  Where 's everybody?"
</p><p>"Up on the hill."
</p><p>"Something happened?"
</p><p>"A lot.  From what I hear it's a strike that's going to put Ohadi on
the map again."
</p><p>"Who made it?"
</p><p>"Don't know.  Some fellow came running down here an hour or so ago and
said there 'd been a tremendous strike made on the hill, and everybody
beat it up there."
</p><p>Fairchild went on, to turn into a deserted street,--a street where the
doors of the stores had been left open and the owners gone.  Everywhere
it was the same; it was as if Ohadi suddenly had been struck by some
catastrophe which had wiped out the whole population.  Only now and
then a human being appeared, a few persons left behind at the banks,
but that was about all.  Then from far away, up the street leading from
Kentucky Gulch, came the sound of cheering and shouting.  Soon a crowd
appeared, led by gesticulating, vociferous men, who veered suddenly
into the Ohadi Bank at the corner, leaving the multitude without for a
moment, only to return, their hands full of gold certificates, which
they stuck into their hats, punched through their buttonholes, stuffed
into their pockets, allowing them to hang half out, and even jammed
down the collars of their rough shirts, making outstanding decorations
of currency about their necks.  On they came, closer--closer, and then
Fairchild gritted his teeth.  There were four of them leading the
parade, displaying the wealth that stood for the bonanza of the silver
strike they had just made, four men whose names were gall and wormwood
to Robert Fairchild.
</p><p>Blindeye Bozeman and Taylor Bill were two of them.  The others were
Squint and Maurice Rodaine!
