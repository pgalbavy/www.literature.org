<p><em>DANNY MEADOW MOUSE </em>often had sat watching Skimmer the
Swallow sailing around up in the blue, blue sky. He had watched
Ol’ Mistah Buzzard go up, up, up, until he was nothing but a tiny
speck, and Danny had wondered how it would seem to be way up above
the Green Meadows and the Green Forest and look down. It had seemed
to him that it must be very wonderful and beautiful. Sometimes
he had wished that he had wings and could go up in the air and
look down. And now here he was, he, Danny Meadow Mouse, actually
doing that very thing!</p>

<p>[Illustration: He was being carried. <em>Page 45.</em>]</p>

<p>But Danny could see nothing wonderful or beautiful now. No, indeed!
Everything was terrible, for you see Danny Meadow Mouse wasn’t
flying himself. He was being carried. Yes, Sir, Danny Meadow Mouse
was being carried through the air in the cruel claws of Hooty
the Owl! And all because Danny had forgotten—forgotten to watch
up in the sky for danger.</p>

<p>Poor, poor Danny Meadow Mouse! Hooty’s great cruel claws hurt
him dreadfully! But it wasn’t the pain that was the worst. No,
indeed! It wasn’t the pain! It was the thought of what would happen
when Hooty reached his home in the Green Forest, for he knew that
there Hooty would gobble him up, bones and all. As he flew, Hooty
kept chuckling, and Danny Meadow Mouse knew just what those chuckles
meant. They meant that Hooty was thinking of the good meal he
was going to have.</p>

<p>Hanging there in Hooty’s great cruel claws, Danny looked down
on the snow-covered Green Meadows he loved so well. They seemed
a frightfully long way below him, though really they were not
far at all, for Hooty was flying very low. But Danny Meadow Mouse
had never in all his life been so high up before, and so it seemed
to him that he was way, way up in the sky, and he shut his eyes
so as not to see. But he couldn’t keep them shut. No, Sir, he
couldn’t keep them shut! He just <em>had</em> to keep opening
them. There was the dear old Green Forest drawing nearer and nearer.
It always had looked very beautiful to Danny Meadow Mouse, but
now it looked terrible, very terrible indeed, because over in
it, in some dark place, was the home of Hooty the Owl.</p>

<p>Just ahead of him was the Old Briar-patch where Peter Rabbit
lives so safely. Every old bramble in it was covered with snow
and it was very, very beautiful. Really everything was just as
beautiful as ever—the moonlight, the Green Forest, the snow-covered
Green Meadows, the Old Briar-patch. The only change was in Danny
Meadow Mouse himself, and it was all because he had forgotten.</p>

<p>Suddenly Danny began to wriggle and struggle. "Keep still!" snapped
Hooty the Owl.</p>

<p>But Danny only struggled harder than ever. It seemed to him that
Hooty wasn’t holding him as tightly as at first. He felt one of
Hooty’s claws slip. It tore his coat and hurt dreadfully, but
it slipped! The fact is, Hooty had only grabbed Danny Meadow Mouse
by the loose part of his coat, and up in the air he couldn’t get
hold of Danny any better. Danny kicked, squirmed and twisted,
and twisted, squirmed, and kicked. He felt his coat tear and of
course the skin with it, but he kept right on, for now he was
hanging almost free. Hooty had started down now, so as to get
a better hold. Danny gave one more kick and then—he felt himself
falling!</p>

<p>Danny Meadow Mouse shut his eyes and held his breath. Down, down,
down he fell. It seemed to him that he never would strike the
snow-covered meadows! Really he fell only a very little distance.
But it seemed a terrible distance to Danny. He hit something that
scratched him, and then plump! he landed in the soft snow right
in the very middle of the Old Briar-patch, and the last thing
he remembered was hearing the scream of disappointment and rage
of Hooty the Owl.</p>
