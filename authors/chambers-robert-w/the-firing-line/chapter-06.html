<p>The young girl beside him had finished her guava, and now, idly
swinging her tennis-bat, stood watching the games in the sunken
courts below.</p>

<p>"Please don't consider me a burden," he said. "I would be very
glad to sit here and watch you play."</p>

<p>"I have been playing, thank you."</p>

<p>"But you won't let me interfere with anything that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Hamil, I won't let you interfere&mdash;with anything."</p>

<p>She stood swinging her bat, apparently preoccupied with her own
thoughts&mdash;like a very grave goddess, he thought, glancing at her
askance&mdash;a very young goddess, immersed in celestial reverie far
beyond mortal comprehension.</p>

<p>"Do you like guavas?" she inquired. And, closing her own question:
"But you had better not until you are acclimated. Do you feel
<em>very</em> sleepy, Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh! You ought to conform to tradition. There's a particularly
alluring hammock on the veranda."</p>

<p>"To get rid of me is it necessary to make me take a nap?" he
protested.</p>

<p>"So you refuse to go to sleep?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do."</p>

<p>She sighed and tucked the tennis-bat under her left arm. "Come,"
she said, moving forward, "my father will ask me what I have done
to amuse you, and I had better hunt up something to tell him about.
You'll want to see the groves of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'm not going to drag you about with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come," she repeated; and as he stood his ground obstinately:
"Please?"&mdash;with a rising inflection hinting at command.</p>

<p>"Why on earth don't you play tennis and let me sit and watch
you?" he asked, joining and keeping step with her.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask a woman for reasons, Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>"It's too bad to spoil your morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know it; so in revenge I'm going to spoil yours. Our trip
is called 'Seeing Florida,' so you must listen to your guide very
attentively. This is a pomelo grove&mdash;thank you," to the negro
who opened the gate&mdash;"here you see blossoms and ripe fruit together
on the same tree. A few palmettos have been planted here for various
agricultural reasons. This is a camphor bush"&mdash;touching it with
her bat&mdash;"the leaves when crushed in the palm exhale a delightful
fragr&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Calypso!"</p>

<p>She turned toward him with coldest composure. "<em>That</em>
never happened, Mr. Hamil."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it never did."</p>

<p>A slight colour remained in his face; hers was cool enough.</p>

<p>"Did you think it happened?" she asked. He shook his head. "No,"
he repeated seriously, "I know that it never happened."</p>

<p>She said: "If you are quite sure it never happened, there is
no harm in pretending it did.... What was it you called me?"</p>

<p>"I could never remember, Miss Cardross&mdash;unless you tell me."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you&mdash;if you are quite sure you don't remember.
You called me 'Calypso.'"</p>

<p>And looking up he surprised the rare laughter in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You are rather nice after all," she said, "or is it only that
I have you under such rigid discipline? But it was very bad taste
in you to recall so crudely what never occurred&mdash;until I gave
you the liberty to do it. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," he said. "I've made two exhibitions of myself since
I knew you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>One</em>, Mr. Hamil. Please recollect that I am scarcely
supposed to know how many exhibitions of yourself you may have
made before we were formally presented."</p>

<p>She stood still under a tree which drooped like a leaf-tufted
umbrella, and she said, swinging her racket: "You will always
have me at a disadvantage. Do you know it?"</p>

<p>"That is utterly impossible!"</p>

<p>"Is it? Do you mean it?"</p>

<p>"I do with all my heart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you; but do you mean it with all your logical intelligence,
too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I do."</p>

<p>She stood, head partly averted, one hand caressing the smooth,
pale-yellow fruit which hung in heavy clusters around her. And
all around her, too, the delicate white blossoms poured out fragrance,
and the giant swallow-tail butterflies in gold and black fluttered
and floated among the blossoms or clung to them as though stupefied
by their heavy sweetness.</p>

<p>"I wish we had begun&mdash;differently," she mused.</p>

<p>"I don't wish it."</p>

<p>She said, turning on him almost fiercely: "You persisted in talking
to me in the boat; you contrived to make yourself interesting
without being offensive&mdash;I don't know how you managed it! And
then&mdash;last night &mdash;I was not myself.... And then&mdash;<em>that</em>
happened!"</p>

<p>"Could anything more innocent have happened?"</p>

<p>"Something far more dignified could have happened when I heard
you say 'Calypso.'" She shrugged her shoulders. "It's done; we've
misbehaved; and you will have to be dreadfully careful. You will,
won't you? And yet I shall certainly hate you heartily if you
make any difference between me and other women. Oh, dear! &mdash;Oh,
dear! The whole situation is just unimportant enough to be irritating.
Mr. Hamil, I don't think I care for you very much."</p>

<p>And as he looked at her with a troubled smile, she added:</p>

<p>"You must not take that declaration <em>too</em> literally. Can
you forget&mdash;various things?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to, Miss Cardross. Listen: nobody could be more
sweet, more simple, more natural than the girl I spoke to &mdash;I
dreamed that I talked with&mdash;last night. I don't want to forget
that night, or that girl. Must I?"</p>

<p>"Are you, in your inmost thoughts, fastidious in thinking of
that girl? Is there any reservation, any hesitation?"</p>

<p>He said, meeting her eyes: "She is easily the nicest girl I ever
met&mdash;the very nicest. Do you think that I might have her for a
friend?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean this girl, Calypso?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I think that she will return to you the exact measure of
friendship that you offer her.... Because, Mr. Hamil, she is after
all not very old in years, and a little sensitive and impressionable."</p>

<p>He thought to himself: "She is a rather curious mixture of impulse
and reason; of shyness and audacity; of composure and timidity;
of courage and cowardice and experience. But there is in her no
treachery; nothing mentally unwholesome."</p>

<p>They stood silent a moment smiling at each other rather seriously;
then her smooth hand slid from his, and she drew a light breath.</p>

<p>"What a relief!" she said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"To know you are the kind of man I knew you were. That sounds
rather Irish, doesn't it?..." And under her breath&mdash;"perhaps it
is. God knows!" Her face grew very grave for a moment, then, as
she turned and looked at him, the shadow fell.</p>

<p>"Do you know&mdash;it was absurd of course&mdash;but I could scarcely sleep
last night for sheer dread of your coming to-day. And yet I knew
what sort of a man you must be; and this morning"&mdash;she shook her
head&mdash;"I couldn't endure any breakfast, and I usually endure lots;
so I took a spin down the lake in my chair. When I saw you just
now I was trying to brace up on a guava. Listen to me: I am hungry!"</p>

<p>"You poor little thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sympathy satisfies sentiment but appetite prefers oranges. Shall
we eat oranges together and become friendly and messy? Are you
even <em>that</em> kind of a man? Oh, then if you really are,
there's a mixed grove just beyond."</p>

<p>So together, shoulder to shoulder, keeping step, they passed
through the new grove with its enormous pendent bunches of grape-fruit,
and into a second grove where limes and mandarins hung among clusters
of lemons and oranges; where kum-quat bushes stood stiffly, studded
with egg-shaped, orange-tinted fruit; where tangerines, grape-fruit,
and king-oranges grew upon the same tree, and the deep scarlet
of ripe Japanese persimmons and the huge tattered fronds of banana
trees formed a riotous background.</p>

<p>"This tree!" she indicated briefly, reaching up; and her hand
was white even among the milky orange bloom&mdash;he noticed that as
he bent down a laden bough for her.</p>

<p>"Pine-oranges," she said, "the most delicious of all. I'll pick
and you hold the branch. And please get me a few tangerines&mdash;those
blood-tangerines up there.... Thank you; and two Japanese persimmons&mdash;and
two more for yourself.... Have you a knife? Very well; now, break
a fan from that saw-palmetto and sweep a place for me on the ground&mdash;that
way. And now please look very carefully to see if there are any
spiders. No spiders? No scorpions? No wood-ticks? Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"There <em>may</em> be a bandersnatch," he said doubtfully, dusting
the ground with his palmetto fan.</p>

<p>She laughed and seated herself on the ground, drew down her short
white tennis-skirt as far as it would go over her slim ankles,
looked up at him confidently, holding out her hand for his knife.</p>

<p>"We are going to be delightfully messy in a moment," she said;
"let me show you how they prepare an orange in Florida. This is
for you&mdash;you must take it.... And this is for me. The rind is
all gone, you see. Now, Ulysses. This is the magic moment!"</p>

<p>And without further ceremony her little teeth met in the dripping
golden pulp; and in another moment Hamil was imitating her.</p>

<p>They appeared to be sufficiently hungry; the brilliant rind,
crinkling, fell away in golden corkscrews from orange after orange,
and still they ate on, chattering away together between oranges.</p>

<p>"Isn't this primitive luxury, Mr. Hamil? We ought to wear our
bathing-clothes.... Don't dare take my largest king-orange! Yes&mdash;you
may have it; &mdash;I won't take it.... Are you being amused?
My father said that you were to be amused. What in the world are
you staring at?"</p>

<p>"That!" said Hamil, eyes widening. "What on earth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing&mdash;that is our watchman. We have to employ
somebody to watch our groves, you know, or all the negroes in
Florida would be banqueting here. So we have that watchman yonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it's a <em>bird</em>!" insisted Hamil, "a big gray, long-legged,
five-foot bird with a scarlet head!"</p>

<p>"Of course," said the girl serenely; "it's a crane. His name
is Alonzo; he's four feet high; and he's horridly savage. If you
came in here without father or me or some of the workmen who know
him, Alonzo would begin to dance at you, flapping his wings, every
plume erect; and if you didn't run he'd attack you. That big,
dagger-like bill of his is an atrocious weapon."</p>

<p>The crane resembled a round-shouldered, thin-legged old gentleman
with his hands tucked under his coat-tails; and as he came up,
tiptoeing and peering slyly at Hamil out of two bright evil-looking
eyes, the girl raised her arm and threw a kum-quat at him so accurately
that the bird veered off with a huge hop of grieved astonishment.</p>

<p>"Alonzo! Go away this instant!" she commanded. And to Hamil:
"He's disgustingly treacherous; he'll sidle up behind you if he
can. Give me that palmetto fan."</p>

<p>But the bird saw her rise, and hastily retreated to the farther
edge of the grove, where presently they saw him pretending to
hunt snails and lizards as innocently as though premeditated human
assassination was farthest from his thoughts.</p>

<p>There was a fountain with a coquina basin in the grove; and here
they washed the orange juice from their hands and dried them on
their handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see Tommy Tiger?" she asked. "I'm taming him."</p>

<p>"Very much," he said politely.</p>

<p>"Well, he's in there somewhere," pointing to a section of bushy
jungle edging the grove and around which was a high heavy fence
of closely woven buffalo wire. "Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!" she
called, in her fresh young voice that, at times, broke deliciously
in a childish grace-note.</p>

<p>At first Hamil could see nothing in the tangle of brier and saw-palmetto,
but after a while he became aware of a wild-cat, tufted ears flattenend,
standing in the shadow of a striped bush and looking at him out
of the greenest eyes he had ever beheld.</p>

<p>"Pretty Tom," said the girl caressingly. "Tommy, come and let
Shiela scratch his ears."</p>

<p>And the lynx, disdainfully shifting its blank green gaze from
Hamil, hoisted an absurd stub of a tail and began rubbing its
lavishly whiskered jowl against the bush. Nearer and nearer sidled
the lithe grayish animal, cautiously the girl advanced, until
the cat was rubbing cheek and flank against the woven-wire fence.
Then, with infinite precaution, she extended her hand, touched
the flat fierce head, and slowly began to rub it.</p>

<p>"Don't!" said Hamil, stepping forward; and at the sound of his
voice and step the cat whirled and struck, and the girl sprang
back, white to the lips.</p>

<p>For a moment she said nothing, then looked up at Hamil beside
her, as pale as she.</p>

<p>"I am not hurt," she said, "only startled."</p>

<p>"I should not have spoken," he faltered. "What an ass I am!"</p>

<p>"It is all right; I ought to have cautioned you about moving
or speaking. I thought you understood&mdash;but please don't look that
way, Mr. Hamil. It was not your fault and I am not hurt. Which
teaches me a lesson, I hope. What is the moral?&mdash;don't attempt
to caress the impossible?&mdash;or something similarly senseless,"
she added gaily. And turning on the crouching lynx: "Bad Tommy!
Wicked, treacherous, <em>bad</em>&mdash;no! <em>Poor</em> old Tom!
You are quite right. I'd do the same if I were trapped and anybody
tried to patronize me. I know how you feel&mdash;yes, I do, Tommy Tiger.
And I'll tell old Jonas to give you lots and lots of delicious
mud-fish for your dinner to-night&mdash;yes, I will, my friend. Also
some lavender to roll on.... Mr. Hamil, you are still unusually
colourless. Were you really afraid?"</p>

<p>"Horribly."</p>

<p>"Oh, the wire is too strong for him to break out," she observed
coolly.</p>

<p>"I was not afraid of that," he retorted, reddening.</p>

<p>She turned toward him, smilingly remorseful.</p>

<p>"I know it! I say such things &mdash;I don't know why. You will
learn how to take them, won't you?"</p>

<p>They walked on, passing through grove after grove, Alonzo tiptoeing
after them, and when, as a matter of precaution from time to time,
Shiela looked back, the bird pretended not to see them until they
passed the last gate and locked it. Then the great crane, half
flying, half running, charged at the closed gate, dancing and
bounding about; and long after they were out of sight Alonzo's
discordant metallic shrieks rang out in baffled fury from among
the trees.</p>

<p>They had come into a wide smooth roadway flanked by walks shaded
by quadruple rows of palms. Oleander and hibiscus hedges ran on
either side as far as the eye could see, and long brilliant flower-beds
stretched away into gorgeous perspective.</p>

<p>"This is stunning," he said, staring about him.</p>

<p>"It is our road to the ocean, about two miles long," she explained.
"My father designed it; do you really like it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," he said sincerely; "and I scarcely understand why
Mr. Cardross has called me into consultation if this is the way
he can do things."</p>

<p>"That is generous of you. Father will be very proud and happy
when I tell him."</p>

<p>They were leaning over the rail of a stone bridge together; the
clear stream below wound through thickets of mangrove, bamboo,
and flowering vines all a-flutter with butterflies; a school of
fish stemmed the current with winnowing fins; myriads of brown
and gold dragon-flies darted overhead.</p>

<p>"It's fairyland&mdash;the only proper setting for you after all,"
he said.</p>

<p>Resting one elbow on the stone parapet, her cheek in the hollow
of her hand, she watched the smile brightening in his face, but
responded only faintly to it.</p>

<p>"Some day," she said, "when we have blown the froth and sparkle
from our scarcely tasted cup of acquaintance, you will talk to
me of serious things sometimes&mdash;will you not?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes," he said, surprised.</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;as you would to a man. You will find me capable of understanding
you. You once said to me, in a boat, that no two normal people
of opposite sex can meet without experiencing more or less wholesome
interest in one another. Didn't you say that? Very well, then;
I now admit my normal interest in you&mdash;untinged by sentiment.
Don't disappoint me."</p>

<p>He said whimsically: "I'm not intellectual; I don't know very
much about anything except my profession."</p>

<p>"Then talk to me about it. Goodness! Don't I deserve it? Is a
girl to violate precept and instinct on an ill-considered impulse
only to find the man in the case was not worth it? And how do
you know what else I violated&mdash;merely to be kind. I must have
been mad to do it!"</p>

<p>He flushed up so vividly that she winced, then added quickly:
"I didn't mean that, Mr. Hamil; I knew you were worth it when
I did it."</p>

<p>"The worst of it is that I am not," he said. "I'm like everybody
who has been through college and chooses a profession for love
of it. I do know something about that profession; outside of it,
the least I can say for myself is that I care about everything
that goes on in this very jolly world. Curiosity has led me about
by the nose. The result is a series of acquired smatterings."</p>

<p>She regarded him intently with that clear gaze he found so refreshing&mdash;a
direct, fearless scrutiny which straightened her eyebrows to a
fascinating level and always made him think of a pagan marble,
with delicately chiselled, upcurled lips, and white brow youthfully
grave.</p>

<p>"Did you study abroad?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;not long enough."</p>

<p>She seemed rather astonished at this. Amused, he rested both
elbows on the parapet, looking at her from between the strong,
lean hands that framed his face.</p>

<p>"It was droll&mdash;the way I managed to scurry like a jack-rabbit
through school and college on nothing a year. I was obliged to
hurry post-graduate courses and Europe and such agreeable things.
Otherwise I would probably be more interesting to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are sufficiently interesting," she said, flushing up at
his wilful misinterpretation.</p>

<p>And, as he laughed easily:</p>

<p>"The horrid thing about it is that you <em>are</em> interesting
and you know it. All I asked of you was to be seriously interesting
to me&mdash;occasionally; and instead you are rude&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rude!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you are!&mdash;pretending that I was disappointed in you because
you hadn't dawdled around Europe for years in the wake of an education.
You are, apparently, just about the average sort of man one meets&mdash;yet
I kicked over several conventions for the sake of exchanging a
few premature words with you, knowing all the while I was to meet
you later. It certainly was not for your beaux yeux; I am not
sentimental!" she added fiercely. "And it was not because you
are a celebrity&mdash;you are not one yet, you know. Something in you
certainly appealed to something reckless in me; yet I did not
really feel very sinful when I let you speak to me; and, even
in the boat, I admit frankly that I enjoyed every word that we
spoke&mdash;though I didn't appear to, did I?"</p>

<p>"No, you didn't," he said.</p>

<p>She smiled, watching him, chin on hand.</p>

<p>"I wonder how you'll like this place," she mused. "It's gay&mdash;in
a way. There are things to do every moment if you let people rob
you of your time&mdash;dances, carnivals, races, gambling, suppers.
There's the Fortnightly Club, and various charities too, and dinners
and teas and all sorts of things to do outdoors on land and on
water. Are you fond of shooting?"</p>

<p>"Very. I <em>can</em> do that pretty well."</p>

<p>"So can I. We'll go with my father and Gray. Gray is my brother;
you'll meet him at luncheon. What time is it?"</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. "Eleven&mdash;a little after."</p>

<p>"We're missing the bathing. Everybody splashes about the pool
or the ocean at this hour. Then everybody sits on the veranda
of <em>The Breakers</em> and drinks things and gossips until luncheon.
Rather intellectual, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Sufficiently," he replied lazily.</p>

<p>She leaned over the parapet, standing on the tips of her white
shoes and looked down at the school of fish. Presently she pointed
to a snake swimming against the current.</p>

<p>"A moccasin?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, only a water snake. They call everything moccasins down
here, but real moccasins are not very common."</p>

<p>"And rattlesnakes?"</p>

<p>"Scarcer still. You hear stories, but&mdash;" She shrugged her shoulders.
"Of course when we are quail shooting it's well to look where
you step, but there are more snakes in the latitude of Saint Augustine
than there are here. When father and I are shooting we never think
anything about them. I'm more afraid of those horrid wood-ticks.
Listen; shall we go camping?"</p>

<p>"But I have work on hand," he said dejectedly.</p>

<p>"That is part of your work. Father said so. Anyway I know he
means to camp with you somewhere in the hammock, and if Gray goes
I go too."</p>

<p>"Calypso," he said, "do you know what I've been hearing about
you? I've heard that you are the most assiduously run-after girl
at Palm Beach. And if you are, what on earth will the legions
of the adoring say when you take to the jungle?"</p>

<p>"Who said that about me?" she asked, smiling adorably.</p>

<p>"Is it true?"</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;liked. Who said it?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say," he continued perversely, "that I have
monopolised the reigning beauty of Palm Beach for an entire morning."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have and it is high time you understood it. <em>Who</em>
said this to <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;I gathered the fact&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"My aunt &mdash;Miss Palliser."</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Shiela Cardross slowly, "that Miss Palliser
has been exceedingly nice to me? But her friend, Miss Suydam,
is not very civil."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," he said.</p>

<p>"I could tell you that it mattered nothing," she said, looking
straight at him; "and that would be an untruth. I know that many
people disregard such things&mdash;many are indifferent to the opinion
of others, or say they are. I never have been; I want everybody
to like me&mdash;even people I have not the slightest interest in&mdash;people
I do not even know &mdash;I want them all to like me. For I must
tell you, Mr. Hamil, that when anybody dislikes me, and I know
it, I am just as unhappy about it as though I cared for them."</p>

<p>"It's absurd for anybody not to like you!" he said.</p>

<p>"Well, do you know it really is absurd&mdash;if they only knew how
willing I am to like everybody.... I was inclined to like Miss
Suydam."</p>

<p>Hamil remained silent.</p>

<p>The girl added: "One does not absolutely disregard the displeasure
of such people."</p>

<p>"They didn't some years ago when there were no shops on Fifth
Avenue and gentlemen wore side-whiskers," said Hamil, smiling.</p>

<p>Shiela Cardross shrugged. "I'm sorry; I was inclined to like
her. She misses more than I do because we are a jolly and amusing
family. It's curious how much energy is wasted disliking people.
Who is Miss Suydam?"</p>

<p>"She's a sort of a relative. I have always known her. I'm sorry
she was rude. She is sometimes."</p>

<p>They said no more about her or about his aunt; and presently
they moved on again, luncheon being imminent.</p>

<p>"You will like my sister, Mrs. Carrick," said Shiela tranquilly.
"You know her husband, Acton, don't you? He's at Miami fishing."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I've met him at the club. He's very agreeable."</p>

<p>"He <em>is</em> jolly. And Jessie &mdash;Mrs. Carrick&mdash;is the
best fun in the world. And you are sure to like my little sister
Cecile; every man adores her, and you'll do it, too&mdash;yes, I mean
sentimentally&mdash;until she laughs you out of it."</p>

<p>"Like yourself, Calypso, I'm not inclined to sentiment," he said.</p>

<p>"You can't help it with Cecile. Wait! Then there are others to
lunch with us &mdash;Marjorie Staines&mdash;very popular with men,
and Stephanie Anan&mdash;you studied with her uncle, Winslow Anan,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" he exclaimed warmly, "but how did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I knew it; I know lots about you, you see.... Then there
is Phil Gatewood&mdash;a perfectly splendid fellow, and Alex Anan&mdash;a
dear boy, ready to adore any girl who looks sideways at him....
I don't remember who else is to lunch with us, except my brother
Gray. Look, Mr. Hamil! They've actually sat down to luncheon without
waiting for us! What horrid incivility! Could your watch have
been wrong?&mdash;or have we been too deeply absorbed?"</p>

<p>"I can speak for one of us," he said, as they came out upon the
lawn in full view of the table which was spread under the most
beautiful live-oaks he had ever seen.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>Everybody was very friendly. Gray Cardross, a nice-looking boy
who wore spectacles, collected butterflies, and did not look like
a "speed-mad cub," took Hamil to the house, whither Shiela had
already retired for an ante-prandial toilet; but there is no dust
in that part of the world, and his preparations were quickly made.</p>

<p>"Awfully glad you came," repeated young Cardross with all the
excessive cordiality of the young and unspoiled. "Father has been
checking off the days on the calendar since your letter saying
you were coming by way of Nassau. The Governor is dying to begin
operations on that jungle yonder. When we camp I'm going&mdash;and
probably Shiela is&mdash;she began clamoring to go two weeks ago. We
all had an idea that you were a rather feeble old gentleman&mdash;like
Mr. Anan&mdash;until Shiela brought us the picture they published of
you in the paper two weeks ago; and she said immediately that
if you were young enough to camp she was old enough to go too.
She's a good shot, Mr. Hamil, and she won't interfere with your
professional duties&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should think not!" said Hamil cordially; "but&mdash;as for my camping&mdash;there's
really almost nothing left for me to do except to familiarise
myself with the character of your wilderness. Your father tells
me he has the surveys and contour maps all ready. As a matter
of fact I really could begin the office work at once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake don't do that! and don't say it!" exclaimed
the young fellow in dismay. "Father and Shiela and I are counting
on this trip. There's a butterfly or two I want to get at Ruffle
Lake. Don't you think it extremely necessary that you go over
the entire territory?&mdash;become thoroughly saturated with the atmosphere
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Malaria?" suggested Hamil, laughing. "Of course, seriously,
it will be simply fine. And perhaps it is the best thing to do
for a while. Please don't mistake me; I <em>want</em> to do it;
I &mdash;I've never before had a vacation like this. It's like
a trip into paradise from the sordid horror of Broadway. Only,"
he added slowly as they left the house and started toward the
luncheon party under the live-oaks, "I should like to have your
father know that I am ready to give him every moment of my time."</p>

<p>"That's what he wants&mdash;and so do I," said young Cardross....
"Hello! Here's Shiela back before us! I'd like to sit near enough
to talk to you, but Shiela is between us. I'll tell you after
luncheon what we propose to do on this trip."</p>

<p>A white servant seated Hamil on Mrs. Cardross's right; and for
a while that languid but friendly lady drawled amiable trivialities
to him, propounding the tritest questions with an air of pleased
profundity, replying to his observations with harmlessly complacent
platitudes&mdash;a good woman, every inch of her&mdash;one who had never
known an unkindly act or word in the circle of her own family&mdash;one
who had always been accustomed to honor, deference, and affection&mdash;of
whom nothing more had ever been demanded than the affections of
a good wife and a good mother.</p>

<p>Being very, very stout, and elaborately upholstered, a shady
hammock couch suited her best; and as she was eternally dieting
and was too stout to sit comfortably, she never remained very
long at table.</p>

<p>Gray escorted her houseward in the midst of the festivities.
She nodded a gracious apology to all, entered her wheel-chair,
and was rolled heavily away for her daily siesta.</p>

<p>Everybody appeared to be friendly to him, even cordial. Mrs.
Acton Carrick talked to him in her pretty, decisive, animated
manner, a feminine reflection of her father's characteristic energy
and frankness.</p>

<p>Her younger sister, Cecile, possessed a drawl like her mother's.
Petite, distractingly pretty, Hamil recognised immediately her
attraction&mdash;experienced it, amused himself by yielding to it as
he exchanged conventionally preliminary observations with her
across the table.</p>

<p>Men, on first acquaintance, were usually very easily captivated,
for she had not only all the general attraction of being young,
feminine, and unusually ornamental, but she also possessed numberless
individualities like a rapid fire of incarnations, which since
she was sixteen had kept many a young man, good and true, madly
guessing which was the real Cecile. And yet all the various and
assorted Ceciles seemed equally desirable, susceptible, and eternally
on the verge of being rounded up and captured; that was the worst
of it; and no young man she had ever known had wholly relinquished
hope. For even in the graceful act of side-stepping the smitten,
the girl's eyes and lips seemed unconsciously to unite in a gay
little unspoken promise&mdash;"This serial story is to be continued
in our next&mdash;perhaps."</p>

<p>As for the other people at the table Hamil began to distinguish
one from another by degrees; the fair-haired Anans, sister and
brother, who spoke of their celebrated uncle, Winslow Anan, and
his predictions concerning Hamil as his legitimate successor;
Marjorie Staines, willowy, active, fresh as a stem of white jasmine,
and inconsequent as a very restless bird; Philip Gatewood, grave,
thin, prematurely saddened by the responsibility of a vast inheritance,
consumed by a desire for an artistic career, looking at the world
with his owlish eyes through the prismatic colors of a set palette.</p>

<p>There were others there whom as yet he had been unable to differentiate;
smiling, well-mannered, affable people who chattered with more
or less intimacy among themselves as though accustomed to meeting
one another year after year in this winter rendezvous. And everywhere
he felt the easy, informal friendliness and goodwill of these
young people.</p>

<p>"Are you being amused?" asked Shiela beside him. "My father's
orders, you know," she added demurely.</p>

<p>They stood up as Mrs. Carrick rose and left the table followed
by the others; and he looked at Shiela expecting her to imitate
her sister's example. As she did not, he waited beside her, his
cigarette unlighted.</p>

<p>Presently she bent over the table, extended her arm, and lifted
a small burning lamp of silver toward him; and, thanking her,
he lighted his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Siesta?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No; I feel fairly normal."</p>

<p>"That's abnormal in Florida. But if you really don't feel sleepy&mdash;if
you really don't&mdash;we'll get the <em>Gracilis</em>&mdash;our fastest
motor-boat&mdash;and run down to the Beach Club and get father. Shall
we&mdash;just you and I?"</p>

<p>"And the engineer?"</p>

<p>"I'll run the <em>Gracilis</em> if you will steer," she said
quietly.</p>

<p>"I'll do whichever you wish, Calypso, steer or run things."</p>

<p>She looked up with that quick smile which seemed to transfigure
her into something a little more than mortal.</p>

<p>"Why in the world have I ever been afraid of you?" she said.
"Will you come? I think our galley is in commission.... Once I
told you that Calypso was a land-nymph. But&mdash;time changes us all,
you know&mdash;and as nobody reads the classics any longer nobody will
perceive the anachronism."</p>

<p>"Except ourselves."</p>

<p>"Except ourselves, Ulysses; and we'll forgive each other." She
took a step out from the shadow of the oaks' foliage into the
white sunlight and turned, looking back at him.</p>

<p>And he followed, as did his heroic namesake in the golden noon
of the age of fable.</p>

<p>As they came in sight of the sea he halted.</p>

<p>"That's curious!" he exclaimed; "there is the <em>Ariani</em>
again!"</p>

<p>"The yacht you came on?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I wonder if there's been an accident. She cleared for Miami
last night."</p>

<p>They stood looking at the white steamer for a moment.</p>

<p>"I hope everything's all right with the <em>Ariani</em>" he murmured;
then turned to the girl beside him.</p>

<p>"By the way I have a message for you from a man on board; I forgot
to deliver it."</p>

<p>"A message for <em>me</em>?"</p>

<p>"From a very ornamental young man who desired to be particularly
remembered to Shiela Cardross until he could pay his respects
in person. Can you guess?"</p>

<p>For a moment she looked at him with a tremor of curiosity and
amusement edging her lips.</p>

<p>"Louis Malcourt," he said, smiling; and turned again to the sea.</p>

<p>A sudden, still, inward fright seized her; the curious soundless
crash of her own senses followed&mdash;as though all within had given
way.</p>

<p>She had known many, many such moments; one was upon her now,
the clutching terror of it seeming to stiffen the very soul within
her.</p>

<p>"I hope all's well with the <em>Ariani</em>" he repeated under
his breath, staring at the sea.</p>

<p>Miss Cardross said nothing.</p>
