<p>Peter Rabbit was on his way back from the pond of Paddy the Beaver
deep in the Green Forest. He had just seen Mr. and Mrs. Quack
start toward the Big River for a brief visit before leaving on
their long, difficult journey to the far-away Southland. Farewells
are always rather sad, and this particular farewell had left Peter
with a lump in his throat,&mdash;a queer, choky feeling.</p>

<p>"If I were sure that they would return next spring, it wouldn't
be so bad," he muttered. "It's those terrible guns. I know what
it is to have to watch out for them. Farmer Brown's boy used to
hunt me with one of them, but he doesn't any more. But even when
he did hunt me it wasn't anything like what the Ducks have to
go through. If I kept my eyes and ears open, I could tell when
a hunter was coming and could hide in a hole if I wanted to. I
never had to worry about my meals. But with the Ducks it is a
thousand times worse. They've got to eat while making that long
journey, and they can eat only where there is the right kind of
food. Hunters with terrible guns know where those places are and
hide there until the Ducks come, and the Ducks have no way of
knowing whether the hunters are waiting for them or not. That
isn't hunting. It's&mdash;it's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it? What are you talking to yourself about, Peter
Rabbit?"</p>

<p>Peter looked up with a start to find the soft, beautiful eyes
of Lightfoot the Deer gazing down at him over the top of a little
hemlock tree.</p>

<p>"It's awful," declared Peter. "It's worse than unfair. It doesn't
give them any chance at all."</p>

<p>"I suppose it must be so if you say so," replied Lightfoot, "but
you might tell me what all this awfulness is about."</p>

<p>Peter grinned. Then he began at the beginning and told Lightfoot
all about Mr. and Mrs. Quack and the many dangers they must face
on their long journey to the far-away Southland and back again
in the spring, all because of the heartless hunters with terrible
guns. Lightfoot listened and his great soft eyes were filled with
pity for the Quack family.</p>

<p>"I hope they will get through all right," said he, "and I hope
they will get back in the spring. It is bad enough to be hunted
by men at one time of the year, as no one knows better than I
do, but to be hunted in the spring as well as in the fall is more
than twice as bad. Men are strange creatures. I do not understand
them at all. None of the people of the Green Forest would think
of doing such terrible things. I suppose it is quite right to
hunt others in order to get enough to eat, though I am thankful
to say that I never have had to do that, but to hunt others just
for the fun of hunting is something I cannot understand at all.
And yet that is what men seem to do it for. I guess the trouble
is they never have been hunted themselves and don't know how it
feels. Sometimes I think I'll hunt one some day just to teach
him a lesson. What are you laughing at, Peter?"</p>

<p>"At the idea of you hunting a man," replied Peter. "Your heart
is all right, Lightfoot, but you are too timid and gentle to frighten
any one. Big as you are I wouldn't fear you."</p>

<p>With a single swift bound Lightfoot sprang out in front of Peter.
He stamped his sharp hoofs, lowered his handsome head until the
sharp points of his antlers, which people call horns, pointed
straight at Peter, lifted the hair along the back of his neck,
and made a motion as if to plunge at him. His eyes, which Peter
had always thought so soft and gentle, seemed to flash fire.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Peter in a faint, frightened-sounding voice and leaped
to one side before it entered his foolish little head that Lightfoot
was just pretending.</p>

<p>Lightfoot chuckled. "Did you say I couldn't frighten any one?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I didn't know you could look so terribly fierce," stammered
Peter. "Those antlers look really dangerous when you point them
that way. Why&mdash;why&mdash;what is that hanging to them? It looks like
bits of old fur. Have you been tearing somebody's coat, Lightfoot?"
Peter's eyes were wide with wonder and suspicion.</p>
