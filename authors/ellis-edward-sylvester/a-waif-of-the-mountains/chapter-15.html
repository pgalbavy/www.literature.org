<p>Wade Ruggles and Parson Brush sprang to their feet and confronted
the white-faced Captain Dawson, who stared at them and breathed
fast. For a full minute they gazed into one another's faces, dazed,
motionless and speechless. The partners stood, each with pipe
in hand, the faint smoke curling upward from the bowls, their
slouched hats still on their frowsy heads, the revolvers at their
cartridge belts spanning their waists, their trousers tucked in
the tops of their boots, and with their heavy flannel shirts serving
for coats and vests.</p>

<p>Captain Dawson was similarly attired. He had dashed out of his
own cabin and into that of his friends, his long locks flying,
and even the strands of his heavy beard rigidly apart, as if from
the consternation that had taken possession of his very soul.</p>

<p>In those seconds of tomb-like stillness, an ember on the earthen
hearth fell apart and a twist of flame threw a yellow illumination
through the small room, grim and bare of everything suggesting
luxury.</p>

<p>It was the parson who first found voice, but when he spoke the
tones, even to himself, sounded like those of another person.</p>

<p>"Captain, it is possible that there is some mistake about this."</p>

<p>"Would to God there might be!"</p>

<p>"Let us hope there is."</p>

<p>"Mistake!" he repeated in a husky, rasping voice; "can there
be any mistake about <em>that</em>?"</p>

<p>He threw out his single arm as he spoke, as if he would drive
his fist through their chests. But he held a crumpled bit of paper
in the face of the parson, who silently took it from him, crinkled
it apart and turning his side so that the firelight fell on the
sheet, began reading the few words written in pencil and in the
pretty delicate hand which he knew so well.</p>

<p>"Read it out loud, parson," said Ruggles, speaking for the first
time.</p>

<p>Felix Brush did so in a voice of surprising evenness:</p>

<p>  "MY <em>DEAREST FATHER:   &</em>mdash;I have decided to go
with Lieutenant Russell.   We love each other and I have promised
to become his wife. Do not   think I love you any less for that
can never be. I cannot remain   here. You will hear from us soon
and then I pray that you will   come to your own</p>

<p>
<em>NELLIE</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>"Have you been to his shanty?" asked Ruggles, who hardly comprehended
the meaning of his own words.</p>

<p>"Why would he go there?" angrily demanded the parson.</p>

<p>"Mebbe the villain changed his mind."</p>

<p>"But, if he had, <em>she</em> would not be there."</p>

<p>"Yes; I went to his cabin," bitterly answered Captain Dawson;
"he has not been in the place for hours; all is dark and deserted;
if I found him, I would have killed him."</p>

<p>The three were laboring under fearful emotion, but with surprising
power forced themselves to seem comparatively calm.</p>

<p>"Captain, tell us about it," said the parson, carefully folding
the bit of paper upon itself and shoving it into his pocket, unobserved
by the others.</p>

<p>Despite his apparent calmness it took a few moments for the father
to gain sufficient self-control to speak clearly. Seated in the
chair, he looked into the embers of the fire on the hearth, compressed
his lips and breathed hard. His two friends had also seated themselves,
for it seemed to them it was easier to master their agitation
thus than while upon their feet.</p>

<p>"What have I to tell, but my everlasting woe and shame? The lieutenant
and I have been working for several days by ourselves on a new
lead. I had noticed nothing unusual in his manner nor indeed in
that of my child. At lunch time to-day he complained to me of
not feeling like work, and told me not to expect him back this
afternoon. I would have returned with him, had not the indications
of the new lead been so good. And actually he invited me to do
no more work until to-morrow, though why he should have done it,
when it would have spoiled their whole scheme, is more than I
can explain.</p>

<p>"It was part of his plan to deceive you."</p>

<p>"I don't see how it could do that, for there was no need of his
inviting me,&mdash;but let it go. It came about that I worked later
than usual, so that it was dark when I got home. I was surprised
to see no light and to find no fire or Nellie. I thought nothing
of that, however, for who would have believed it possible that
there could be anything wrong? I supposed she was with some of
the folks and being tired I sat down in my chair and fell asleep.</p>

<p>"When I awoke, the room was cold, silent and as dark as a wolf's
mouth. I felt impatient and decided to give her a scolding for
being so neglectful. I groped around until I found a match, intending
to start a fire. I had just lit the lamp and set it down on the
table, when I caught sight of a folded piece of paper with my
name in her handwriting on the outside. It gave me a queer feeling
and my hands trembled when I unfolded and read it.</p>

<p>"I don't clearly remember the next few minutes. The room seemed
to be spinning around, and I think I had to sit down to keep from
falling, but what saved me from collapse was my anger. I have
been consumed with indignation once or twice in my life, but was
never so furious, so uncontrollable, so utterly savage as I was
after reading that note. If I could have found Russell, I would
have throttled him. It may sound strange, but I hardly once thought
of Nellie; it was <em>he</em>, the villain, whom I yearned to
get my hands on."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Ruggles, "that's the way you oughter feel."</p>

<p>"I don't know what possessed me to do so, but I rushed out and
made straight for his cabin, as if I would find him there. Of
course that too was empty, and then I came here. Fool that I have
been!" exclaimed the parent, leaping to his feet and striding
up and down the room; "not to see all this, but," he added pathetically,
"I believed that Nellie loved me."</p>

<p>The flaming wrath of the two melted into pity for the stricken
father. Parson Brush laid his hand on his shoulder and compelled
him to resume his seat. Then he spoke with the tenderness of a
woman:</p>

<p>"That child <em>does</em> love you more than she loves her own
life, but she is blinded by her infatuation for that smooth-tongued
scoundrel. It is the nature of her sex to feel and act thus; but,
as I said, it does not mean that her love for you is less&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk of her love for me," fiercely interrupted the parent;
"we only judge of a person by his actions."</p>

<p>"But you and I have made mistakes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing like this; why did she not ask me? why did <em>he</em>
not tell me that he wished to marry her?&mdash;that is if he does,"
added the father, as if determined to make his own cup as bitter
as possible.</p>

<p>"He did not ask you, because he knew you would refuse; for from
the first time he entered this community, he was determined to
have her."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Because Ruggles and I read him; we did what no one else did,&mdash;we
measured the man. Am I right, Wade?"</p>

<p>The miner nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Every word is as true as gospel; we noticed his sly looks at
her, that first night you and him entered the Heavenly Bower and
she was there. We couldn't make any mistake about it."</p>

<p>"And you didn't warn me! You two are as bad as he, because you
kept the secret when you ought to have put me on my guard, so
that I might have strangled him at the first advance he made."</p>

<p>Sympathy for the man prevented his listeners taking offence at
the words which, from any one else, would have brought serious
consequences. The parson said soothingly:</p>

<p>"If you were not so wrought up, captain, you would not be so
unreasonable; suppose Wade and I had gone to you with the statement
that the man who, according to your own words, had saved your
life but a short time before in the mountains, was a villain,
who contemplated robbing you of your child; what would you have
done?"</p>

<p>"Thanked you and been on my guard."</p>

<p>"You would have done nothing of the kind; you would have cursed
us and told us to mind our own business."</p>

<p>"No matter what I would have done, it was your duty to tell me,
regardless of the consequences to yourselves. I might have resented
it, but my eyes would have been opened and this blow saved me."</p>

<p>"Nothing could have opened your eyes, for you were blind," said
the parson, who felt that though the man was intensely agitated,
he ought to hear some plain truths; "even had you suspected there
was ground for our fears, you would have gone to Lieutenant Russell
and demanded an explanation. He would have denied it, and you
would have believed him with the result that he would have been
put on his guard and would have deceived you the more completely."</p>

<p>"Likewise, as aforesaid," added Ruggles, "the villain would have
come to us and made us give our grounds for our charges. What
ridic'lous fools we would have been, when all we could answer
was that we thought he looked as if he meant to run away with
your darter."</p>

<p>"There may be some justice in what you say," replied the captain
more composedly; "It was I who was blind, but I can't understand
it. Never until I read that piece of paper, did I suspect the
truth."</p>

<p>"Howsumever, the parson and me haven't been idle; we often talked
it over and fixed on a line that we thought would work better
than going to you. We showed the leftenant that we was onto his
game; I give him a scowl now and then, as it fell convenient,
that said 'Beware!' We, that is the parson and me, made up our
minds to watch close, and, at the first sign that was dead sure,
we'd fall onto him like a couple of mountains."</p>

<p>"And why didn't you?"</p>

<p>"He fooled us as he did you. We was talkin' over matters the
very minute you busted into the door and was satisfied that he
had larned he was playin' with fire and had concluded to drop
it. We was as big fools as you."</p>
