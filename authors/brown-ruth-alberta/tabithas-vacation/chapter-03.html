<p>"Well, one whole week is gone," said Tabitha exultantly, as she
bent over the heaped-up mending basket one hot afternoon, and
tried to make neat darns of the gaping holes in the heels of Susie's
stockings.</p>

<p>"Yes, and half of the first day of the second week," Gloriana
replied cheerily.  "But really, Puss, time hasn't dragged as slowly
as I feared.  That first day was the longest, I think, I ever
knew."</p>

<p>"That first day was a horrible nightmare," the older girl emphatically
declared.  "I thought it <em>never</em> would end, and I'd have
quit my job on the spot if there had been anyone to take my place."</p>

<p>"I'd have quit it anyway if you had just said the word," laughed
her companion.  "I thought you'd never go to sleep that night
&mdash;I wanted so badly to cry."</p>

<p>"Did you?  So did I, but you kept tossing so restlessly that
I knew you were still awake, and finally I dropped off without
getting my cry at all."</p>

<p>"That's just what I did, too!" giggled Gloriana.</p>

<p>"And the next morning everything looked so different<hr>"</p>

<p>"Yes, I could laugh then at the burro's nose in your lovely pie
and the seeds in my gingerbread; but they didn't seem so funny
the night before."</p>

<p>"They seemed anything but funny to me for several days, and I
don't think I'll ever see a chocolate pie or a gingerbread again
in my life without remembering this vacation."</p>

<p>"But things have gone splendidly since that first night," Gloriana
reminded her.  "The children have tried to be angels, even if
they have executed some queer stunts for cherubs."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but I am glad just the same that half of our&mdash;apprenticeship&mdash;is
over.  If this week will pass as smoothly as last week did, it's
all I'll&mdash;  What in the world is the matter with the children? 
Sounds as if they were having an Indian war dance.  I wonder if
those Swanberg boys are bothering again."</p>

<p>Both girls dropped their mending and hurried to the door just
in time to hear Inez's voice say cuttingly, "Of course we know
who you are, Williard and Theodore McKittrick!"</p>

<p>"Guess again!" drawled the older of two strange boys, lolling
on suitcases in the middle of the yard.</p>

<p>"Well, those <em>are</em> your names," Inez insisted.</p>

<p>"You look enough like you used to when you were here before,
so we can't be mistaken," said Mercedes primly.</p>

<p>"Can't, eh?  Well, our names are Williard and Theodore no longer. 
We are Billiard and Toady these days.  Mind you don't forget! 
We've come to stay till the folks get back<hr>"</p>

<p>"Didn't you get our telegram telling you not to come?" demanded
belligerent Susie.</p>

<p>"Sure we did!"</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you stay at home?"</p>

<p>"'Cause ma had the arrangements all made to go across the ocean
and there wasn't anyone else to send us to.  Grandma's away travelling,
and Aunt Helen's kids have got scarlet fever."</p>

<p>"But papa's in the hospital and mamma's there nursing him," said
Irene indignantly.</p>

<p>"Truly?"  The boy called Toady spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm lying?"</p>

<p>"Well, ma said she bet it was all a bluff to keep us from coming
out here," Billiard explained, looking genuinely surprised at
Irene's words.</p>

<p>"And anyway," supplemented Toady, "she said if it was true about
your father and mother being away to Los Angeles, there'd have
to be someone here to look after you kids, and two more wouldn't
make much difference."</p>

<p>"Specially when she's paying for our board!"</p>

<p>Tabitha, a silent spectator in the doorway, ground her teeth
in helpless rage, while Gloriana gasped audibly at the impudence
of mother and sons.</p>

<p>"It's no more'n right that you should pay board," Susie declared
in heat.  "You make so much trouble wherever you go."</p>

<p>"Do, huh?"  Billiard, frowning darkly, advanced threateningly
toward his outspoken cousin, with fists doubled up and an ugly
sneer on his face.  But Susie was no coward, and when he shook
his knuckles close to her little pug nose to emphasize his words,
the girl's arm shot out unexpectedly and landed a blow fair and
square on one eye.</p>

<p>With a yell of rage and pain, the surprised boy lunged forward,
but instead of confronting Susie, he found himself in the grasp
of a tall, irate young lady, who wore her shining black hair pinned
up on top of her head, although her skirts were still short enough
to show a pair of trim ankles.  "Now stop right here!"</p>

<p>She spoke quietly, almost too quietly; but one look into the
smouldering depths of those big, black eyes was enough to cow
the bully, and he jerked himself free, muttering sulkily, "She
hit me first!"</p>

<p>"She had to, or get hit herself," bawled Inez, jigging excitedly
from one foot to the other in her exultation over her cousin's
defeat.</p>

<p>"Inez!"</p>

<p>"Well, he needn't have come!  We telegraphed them not to!"</p>

<p>"<em>Inez</em>!"</p>

<p>The girl subsided, and Billiard found courage to leer triumphantly
at her discomfiture.  But Tabitha intercepted the glance, and
in that ominously calm voice which had struck terror to his cowardly
heart before, she announced, "It is too late now to think of that
side of the question.  We'll have to make the most of a bad situation;
but I <em>will not</em> tolerate fighting.  You may as well understand
that first as last. If you boys can't behave like gentlemen, you
can just move on down to the hotel.  Is that plain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;ma'am," stammered the abashed Billiard, glancing uneasily
about for some means of escape, but Tabitha had delivered her
ultimatum, and now swept grandly into the house, satisfied that
she had displayed her authority in a very impressive manner.</p>

<p>Hardly had the screen closed behind her, however, when her sharp
ears caught Billiard's hoarsely whispered question, "Who is that
high-headed geezer?"</p>

<p>"The girl who is taking care of us," answered Mercedes unguardedly.</p>

<p>"Girl?"</p>

<p>"Sure!  What did you take her for?"</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>a new woman.  <em>A&mdash;</em>one of these things that's
trying to vote and do men's work and such like."</p>

<p>"Oho!" yelled the McKittrick girls in unison.  "Why, she ain't
much older'n us!"</p>

<p>"She goes to Ivy Hall in Los Angeles, the boarding school I belong
to," said Mercedes.</p>

<p>"Honest Injun?"</p>

<p>"Cross my heart!"</p>

<p>"Huh!"</p>

<p>And instinctively Tabitha knew that there was trouble ahead for
her. "Isn't this the worst luck you ever heard of?" she groaned
to Gloriana when once inside the house again.</p>

<p>"If I had my way about it, I'd ship them straight home on the
next train," declared the red-haired girl angrily.  "The very
idea of their mother doing such a thing as that!  What kind of
a woman is she, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I don't know much about her, except that she is utterly selfish
and very rich.  The boys are sent away to school most of the year;
and during vacations she manages to shift them onto some of her
relatives. Fortunately, Jim McKittrick is too far away to be bothered
with them very often."</p>

<p>"But what shall you&mdash;we do with them?  Shall we tell Mrs. McKittrick
that they have come?"</p>

<p>"Goodness, no!  At least not yet.  It would just worry her more
than ever and she is worn to distraction now.  No, we must make
the best of it this week, and by that time Miss Davis will be
here.  She was raised in a family of boys and ought to know how
to manage them."</p>

<p>"Well, I am thankful <em>I</em> am not in her shoes," breathed
Gloriana.  "I suppose we can get along somehow for the six days
that are left.  Where shall you put them?"</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!  I had forgotten all about that part of it. 
They will think I am a real hospitable hostess."  She stepped
to the door to call them, but not a soul was in sight anywhere. 
Two open suitcases lay on the ground with their contents scattered
all about, but both owners and their cousins had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Mercedes!  Susie!" she called peremptorily, but no one answered;
and not even the sound of their voices at play fell on her listening
ear. "Strange," she muttered.  "They were here a minute ago. 
Where can they have gone so quickly?"</p>

<p>She was about to start on a tour of investigation when a series
of wild, piercing screams of abject terror rent the air, and Rosslyn
came stumbling down the steep incline behind the house, bruised,
scratched, torn, and covered from head to foot with what looked
like blood Gloriana caught him as he fell, for Tabitha turned
faint and sick at the sight; but a shout of boyish disgust from
above brought her to her senses.</p>

<p>"Aw, come back, you bawl baby!  We were just foolin'!  You ain't
hurt a mite!"  Billiard swaggered into view from behind a tall
boulder half-way up the mountainside, and even Tabitha shuddered
at the spectacle he presented, for he was togged out in war paint
and feathers till he looked fiendish as he brandished a tomahawk
in one hand and an evil-looking knife in the other.  At sight
of the girl on the narrow piazza, he hastily retreated behind
the rocks again; but Tabitha was there almost as soon as he. 
Snatching the gorgeous headdress from the culprit's head, she
trampled it ruthlessly in the sharp gravel, disarmed the would-be
Indian brave, breaking the treasured tomahawk and knife against
the rocks, and shook the cowering savage with strong, relentless
hands.  But not a word did she speak, and though her victim writhed
and squirmed and wriggled, he could not break the fierce grip
on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Don't, don't," he blubbered in desperation.  "I didn't mean
to scare him so bad.  We were only playing Indian."</p>

<p>"Only&mdash;playing &mdash;Indian!" panted Tabitha, in scorching scorn. 
"Look at those children!  You have frightened them all to death!" 
Pausing an instant in her vigorous shaking, she pointed at the
circle of sisters, &mdash;Mercedes, weak and trembling, bent over
the limp form of little Janie, blowing frantically in the still,
white face; a thoroughly subdued and frightened Toady was wildly
fanning poor Irene, who had likewise crumpled in a faint; while
close by sat Susie and Inez clinging to each other and sobbing
in terror.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean to!" bellowed Billiard, as Tabitha resumed
her shaking.  "I thought they'd seen Indians before."</p>

<p>"And so they have, but not such horrible savages as you!"  Shake!
Shake!  Shake!</p>

<p>Irene sighed faintly and opened her eyes.  Toady's heart gave
a violent thump of relief and thanksgiving, and abruptly dropping
the headdress of feathers which he had been using as a fan, he
flew to his brother's rescue.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Mrs. Tabitha," he pleaded, "you've drubbed him enough.
Shake me if you ain't through yet.  You'll have him plumb addled!
Really, we were just in for some fun.  We never dreamed the kids
would scare so easy.  That's only vegetable dye on Rosslyn's head. 
He thought we had scalped him, but we didn't mean to hurt him."</p>

<p>Tabitha glanced down into the entreating brown eyes at her elbow,
straightway forgave Toady, and released her victim so suddenly
that he fell sprawling into a nest of sharp-thorned Mormon pears;
but of this she was unaware, for with one swoop she gathered up
the now hysterical baby, and stalked off toward the house, saying
grimly, "You boys stay right where you are until you are willing
to apologize and promise to behave yourselves in the future. 
I've a mind to turn you over to the sheriff now.  Come, girls!" 
Followed by the troop of white, shivering sisters, she disappeared
within doors, and soon quiet reigned in the Eagles' Nest.</p>

<p>Only then did the cowed Billiard venture to peer from his retreat
at the house below.  It was nearing the supper hour and he was
hungry, but Tabitha had said he must apologize and promise good
behaviour before he would be admitted to the family circle.  It
was evident that she meant business.</p>

<p>"Toady," he whispered to the other boy, sitting silent and motionless
where he had dropped when Tabitha had left them an hour before.
"Toady, can you see anyone down there?"</p>

<p>Toady glanced off at the hazy flat below with its winding silver
ribbon of railroad track, and the lonely, dingy station house,
and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Aw, not there!" Billiard protested, seeing that his brother's
thoughts had evidently been running in the same channel.  "Down
to Uncle Jim's, I mean."</p>

<p>Scarcely shifting his position, dutiful Toady craned his neck
around a boulder, surveyed the quiet mountainside in the waning
afternoon light, and again shook his head.</p>

<p>"Creep down and see what they're doing.  Maybe they are talking
about us."</p>

<p>"Go yourself," returned Toady briefly.</p>

<p>"Aw, come now, Toady!  She ain't so mad at you, and besides,
you're littler.  They wouldn't see you so quick."</p>

<p>Still Toady remained seated.</p>

<p>"We'll have to have some water to wash off this stuff before
she'll let us in to&mdash;to apologize," wheedled Billiard.</p>

<p>"<em>Are</em> you going to apologize?"</p>

<p>"Looks like we got to," answered the older boy gloomily.  "She's
a reg'lar cyclone.  Smashed up half our things already, and like
enough she will sick the sheriff on us like she said, 'nless we
do&mdash;er&mdash;apologize."</p>

<p>It was very evident that Billiard was not in the habit of apologizing
for anything; and Toady, grinning with no little satisfaction
at his brother's discomfiture, arose and slowly descended by a
roundabout trail to the cottage.  He was gone a long time and
Billiard was growing decidedly restless and anxious when he appeared
in sight once more. "She's&mdash;they are going to write to Uncle Hogan!"
he announced breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Uncle Hogan!" cried Billiard in dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's just what I heard them say.  Mercedes told her how
Uncle Hogan<hr>"</p>

<p>"I'll get even with Miss Mercedes," Billiard interrupted fiercely.</p>

<p>"You better get that paint off your face and hike for the house
with your apology," advised the more easily persuaded brother,
"else you'll never have a chance to get even with anybody again."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because if we don't promise to be good inside of an hour, they
are going to ask the&mdash;the&mdash;some man, sort of a policeman, I guess,
to look after us until Uncle Hogan answers."</p>

<p>"Do you really think they'd write to Uncle Hogan?"</p>

<p>"Sure!  Tabitha knows him.  She and that Glory girl with the
red hair kept him all night last winter off some mountain he wanted
to climb 'cause they didn't know who he was.  She had a gun and
shot at them; but when her father got there he said 'twas all
right, and Uncle Hogan thinks Tabitha is the whole cheese now."</p>

<p>"Supposing we do&mdash;apologize, will they write to him still?"</p>

<p>"No, I guess not.  If you'll promise to behave, they will let
you stay until some woman who's going to take care of the kids
most of the summer gets here.  Then she can do as she pleases
about writing.  You better knuckle under, Billiard."</p>

<p>The older boy groaned.  "You don't seem to care very much," he
complained bitterly, feeling that Toady had deserted him at the
most critical moment.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I've apologized already," acknowledged the other. 
"I'd rather do that than have Uncle Hogan get after us."</p>

<p>"So would I," Billiard sulkily decided, and pulling himself up
from his rocky seat, he slowly shambled down the mountainside,
with Toady at his heels hugely enjoying his brother's humiliation,
for, though comrades in mischief, the older boy loved to bully
the younger, and Toady had a long list of scores to settle, so
he could not refrain from grinning broadly behind Billiard's back,
particularly since his part of the disagreeable program had already
been accomplished.</p>

<p>"Better wash your face, first," he suggested, as Billiard made
straight for the kitchen door, through which savory odors of supper
cooking were beginning to steal.</p>

<p>"Aw, come off!"</p>

<p>"She won't let you in till you do."</p>

<p>"Well, then, where's the water?"</p>

<p>Toady pointed toward a basin on a nearby rock, and Billiard made
a vigorous, if somewhat hasty toilet.  Then, after a moment's
further hesitation, he entered the kitchen with hanging head,
and, addressing a grease spot on the floor by Tabitha's feet,
muttered surlily, "<em>I&mdash;</em>er&mdash;apologize."</p>

<p>Tabitha's lips twitched.  He looked so utterly downcast and abject
that she could scarcely keep from smiling openly.  "Are you ready
to promise to behave yourself from now on?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir &mdash;I mean, ma'am," he gulped, flushing angrily
as the girls tittered.</p>

<p>Tabitha instantly silenced their mirth, and turning to the boy,
said graciously, "Then we'll let bygones be bygones; but we'll
have no more such actions while you stay.  Your suitcase is in
the back bedroom. Toady will show you.  But first, please bring
in a couple armfuls of wood.  It looks like rain and<hr>"</p>

<p>"Wood!  We never bring in wood at home!" the boy rebelled.</p>

<p>"You are not at home now," Tabitha answered sweetly.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;we're paying board!"</p>

<p>"I haven't seen any board money yet.  And anyway, we need the
wood."</p>

<p>Angrily the boy jerked out a purse from his trousers pocket and
slammed some gold pieces on the table.</p>

<p>"Twenty dollars," she counted.  "For how long?"</p>

<p>"All summer."</p>

<p>"Ten weeks!  Two dollars a week for two of you!  Board on the
desert is cheap at a dollar a day.  You can write your mother
to that effect; and in the meantime, perhaps you better put up
at the hotel<hr>"</p>

<p>"Oh, she said if anyone made a fuss, she'd pay more," Billiard
hastily explained, for somehow the hotel idea did not appeal to
him.</p>

<p>"Well, you tell her a dollar a day for each of you is the regular
rate. And now you will have just about time to get that wood before
supper is ready."</p>

<p>Billiard glanced questioningly up into the clear, olive face
above him, as if he could not believe his ears.</p>

<p>"The pile is close to the door," she continued, paying no attention
to the amazement in his face: "and the woodbox is on the screened
porch."</p>

<p>Billiard hesitated, opened his lips as if to speak, closed them
again, and inwardly raging, but outwardly meek, marched out of
the door to the woodpile.</p>
