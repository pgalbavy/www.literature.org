<p>For a time Jake Golcher paid no attention to the whites, but
watched the Senecas, while they plied the roaring fire, as though
it gave him a good deal of satisfaction.</p>

<p>In counting the Indians, Fred Godfrey saw that two were missing,
but before he formed any guess as to the cause of their absence
they reappeared, their coming announced by the terrific squealing
of a young pig, that they had managed to steal somewhere.</p>

<p>As they entered the circle of light, they were seen to be holding
a plump little porker between them, while he struggled fiercely
and emitted screams like the shriek of a locomotive whistle.</p>

<p>It was a piece of good fortune that they were enabled to secure
such a prize, when so many of the fugitives from Wyoming almost
perished with hunger.</p>

<p>The cries of the little porker were soon hushed in death, and
he was dressed with considerable skill. Conveniences not being
at hand for scalding him, it became necessary to prepare him for
the table without that desirable process.</p>

<p>When he was ready for the coals the latter were raked out, and
Aunt Peggy was invited to come forward and display her skill.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see me cook for you scand'lous villains," she snapped
out; "I would do it if I had a lot of p'ison to put in the meat,
but not otherwise."</p>

<p>Her refusal probably would have ended in serious consequences
to herself, but Mr. Brainerd and Maggie urged her to comply, all
saying they were extremely hungry, and in no other way would they
be able to secure any food.</p>

<p>In deference to their wishes she stepped forward, and, being
furnished with a keen hunting-knife by one of the warriors, plied
it with the skill for which she became famous years before.</p>

<p>The pig was in prime condition, and, if properly prepared, would
have made an enjoyable delicacy for the table.</p>

<p>But time and circumstances did not favor elaborate cookery, and
Aunt Peggy, in grim silence, cut off slices that were nicely broiled
by being skewered with green sticks, and held over the glowing
coals.</p>

<p>In a few minutes a thin steak was browned and ready for the palate.</p>

<p>"I'll take that, old woman," said Jake Golcher, reaching out
for it.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see you get it," said the lady, whipping it away
from him; "you good-for-nothing, scand'lous villain, don't you
know that ladies orter be waited on fust?"</p>

<p>And with these scarifying words, she walked over to Maggie and
Eva, and, cutting the steak in two, handed half to each.</p>

<p>"That's just what I was going to do," growled Golcher, annoyed
by the broad grin that illuminated Caucasian and American faces
alike.</p>

<p>"You know it's a falsehood," replied Aunt Peggy, in the same
peppery style; "you're too mean ever to think of anything decent
and Christian-like, you vagabond&mdash;oh-h-h-h, how I ache to get
hold of you!"</p>

<p>The Tory fought rather shy of her, for in sooth she was a lady
to be dreaded.</p>

<p>Eva Brainerd walked straight to where her father sat, and said:</p>

<p>"Papa, I shall not eat a mouthful until you do."</p>

<p>"I can't eat very conveniently with my hands tied behind me,
but I shall never consent to devour that and allow you to go hungry."</p>

<p>"But I can get more of Aunt Peggy."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so and perhaps not."</p>

<p>"Then we will eat it between us. There, you take a bite and I
will do the same, and we will keep it up until nothing is left."</p>

<p>"That <em>is</em> a good arrangement," replied her parent, smiling
at the ingenuity of the affectionate child, and complying with
her request.</p>

<p>He took a good mouthful, and she followed. Eva forced the last
bit upon her father, who, in spite of himself, was compelled to
eat fully two-thirds of the piece, which, after all, was the proper
thing to do.</p>

<p>Before the feast was finished Aunt Peggy had another slice ready,
which was handed over to Maggie, who walked directly to where
Fred Godfrey sat on the log.</p>

<p>"Brother Fred, this is for <em>you</em>."</p>

<p>He consented to share it with her as their parent was doing with
little Eva, and of course she complied.</p>

<p>While this scene was going on the Indians were lolling near at
hand, smoking their pipes, and exchanging a few guttural grunts.
They were all on the ground, evidently in a more patient mood
than Jake Golcher, who stood a short distance back from the camp-fire,
scowling and angry, that he should be compelled to stand still
and see the captives fed, while he was hungry and unable to obtain
a mouthful.</p>

<p>Even Habakkuk McEwen was not forgotten, Maggie ministering to
his wants, though, of course, she did not alternate the feasting
as she did with Fred. Habakkuk asked her to do so, but she refused
so pointedly that he did not repeat the request.</p>

<p>"This is interesting," muttered the angered Tory to himself,
as he looked on; "that pig belongs to us, and we've got to set
back and let them rebels swaller it before our eyes. I'll be hanged
if I'll stand it."</p>

<p>He was fast working up to a dangerous point of anger, which was
not mollified when he noticed that Aunt Peggy herself now and
then placed a large piece in her mouth, after which her jaws worked
with great vigor.</p>

<p>"See here, old woman," he called out, "that pork don't belong
to you, and I reckon it's about time the owner got some."</p>

<p>He did not approach her, but he looked as savage as a sharpened
tomahawk.</p>

<p>Aunt Peggy made no reply and acted as though she heard him not;
but, had any one noticed her closely, he would have seen her jaws
working more energetically than ever, while her eyes took on a
little sharper gleam than before.</p>

<p>She, too, was rapidly reaching an explosive mood, although the
particular individual against whom she felt the rising anger failed
to take warning.</p>

<p>"She's the worst hag I ever seen," muttered Jake, glancing askance
at her, but still keeping a respectful distance.</p>

<p>The Senecas sat somewhat apart in the same lolling attitudes,
and some of them looked as if they anticipated what was coming.</p>

<p>A minute later, Aunt Peggy finished another slice, which she
asked Maggie to take.</p>

<p>"Thank you, auntie, we have enough," replied our heroine, Eva
saying the same.</p>

<p>"I think I could eat a few pounds more," remarked Habakkuk, "but
I would prefer to see Mr. Golcher get something. He is a good
fellow, and orter been sarved first."</p>

<p>"If none of you want it, I'll eat it myself," observed the ancient
maiden, who thereupon began disposing of it.</p>

<p>"That's gone about fur enough!" exclaimed Golcher, striding toward
her; "some folks haven't got no gratertude, and I'll teach you&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he uttered this threat, or rather partly uttered it, he was
at Aunt Peggy's elbow in a wrathful mood. All at once, she whirled
about, and sprang at him like a tigress.</p>

<p>"You'll teach me manners, will you? There! Take <em>that</em>!
and <em>THAT</em>!"</p>

<p>The attack was so unexpected that Golcher threw up his empty
hands in a weak way, and lowered his head, closing his eyes and
trying to retreat, but she had grasped his long, straggling hair,
and it came out by the handfuls.</p>

<p>Instantly all was confusion. Mr. Brainerd laughed, and the Senecas,
as they sprang to their feet, made no effort to interfere. Indeed,
there was strong reason to believe they enjoyed the strange scene.</p>

<p>Aunt Peggy scratched and pulled with the most commendable enthusiasm,
and her victim howled with pain.</p>

<p>"Take her off!" he shouted, "or she will kill me!"</p>

<p>Eva and Maggie ran forward, but the Indians actually laughed,
and the two girls were unable to restrain her until she had spent
her vengeance. Her victim was in a sorry plight, and in his blind
retreat he tumbled backward over the log, springing instantly
to his feet, and actually dashing off in the darkness.</p>

<p>"There!" gasped Aunt Peggy, "I've been aching to get my hands
on you, and now I feel better!"</p>

<p>At this juncture several of the Senecas uttered excited exclamations,
for the discovery was made that during the hubbub one of the prisoners
had escaped, and his name was Fred Godfrey.</p>
