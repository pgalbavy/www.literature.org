<p><em>TWO HOURS </em>later a note was received from Mrs. Davenport,
inviting Tom to pass the day at her house. It was brought by an
errand-boy, and arrived just as Tom, having arranged his wardrobe,
was about to start on a journey of exploration.</p>

<p>"I’ll come with pleasure," said Tom. "Say I’ll be round in fifteen
minutes."</p>

<p>"You see, my dear," said Mr. Middleton, "Tom has been taken up
by the Davenports; we must take care to gratify him in all his
wishes. It will do us credit to have him at our house."</p>

<p>"I wonder they have invited him. I am sure he was very impudent
to Squire Davenport."</p>

<p>"Boys will be boys, my dear, and our young friend is rich."</p>

<p>"Well, I’m glad of one thing, he’ll be away for two meals."</p>

<p>"True, my dear, that will be a saving. He certainly has a great
appetite."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tom, having brushed his hair and put on a clean collar,
walked round to Lawyer Davenport’s. He found the two boys in front
of the house.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said James, rather sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Will you let me play with you this morning?" said Tom smiling.</p>

<p>"We didn’t know who you were yesterday," said James, "but as
you’re a gentleman, we are glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Did you find the ball?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Mike, the errand-boy, found it. Shall we have a toss?"</p>

<p>"I should like it."</p>

<p>They went into the field before referred to, and spent a couple
of hours very pleasantly. James and Edwin, looking upon their
companion as a young man of fortune, were very courteous and polite.
Indeed it was hard to think of them as the same boys who had treated
Tom so rudely the day before. Our hero was clear-sighted and understood
very well the meaning of the change in their manners, but he took
the world as he found it, and didn’t choose to quarrel with the
respect which his wealth procured him.</p>

<p>At dinner he made acquaintance with Mrs. Davenport. This lady
was very much like her husband and son. When she had heard of
Tom’s difficulty with James, she was very indignant, supposing
our hero to be a poor boy. Now that she had ascertained his circumstances,
she was prepared to receive him cordially.</p>

<p>"I am glad that my son and nephew have found a suitable companion,"
she said affably. "I don’t want to say anything against the village
boys, who are very well in their way, but of course they are not
the social equals of my boys. They are lacking in culture and
refinement."</p>

<p>"They’re low," said James.</p>

<p>"I was low yesterday," thought Tom, "but it’s different to-day."</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma’am," he said, "you are very obliging."</p>

<p>"I am told you are to reside with the Middletons, Mr. Temple,"
the lady proceeded.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma’am."</p>

<p>"They are very worthy people—not stylish, but respectable. Was
your father connected with them?"</p>

<p>"He was a school-mate of Mr. Middleton, I believe."</p>

<p>"I say, Tom," said James, "you must look out or you will get
the gout there."</p>

<p>"I’ll take care of that," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Middleton will, if you don’t."</p>

<p>"James, you should not make such remarks," said his mother. "It
is true, I believe, that the Middletons are rather economical
in their table expenses, but doubtless out of regard to Mr. Temple
they will adopt a different policy."</p>

<p>Tom smiled, but said nothing. He did not consider it honorable
to refer to Mr. Middleton’s domestic arrangements.</p>

<p>At this moment two girls entered the room. One was evidently
Mrs. Davenport’s daughter, as she bore a striking resemblance
to that dignified lady. She was by no means pretty, but evidently
thought considerable of herself, and was not troubled with bashfulness.
She made a low courtesy, in the most approved dancing-school style,
to Tom, who was sufficiently well-bred to acquit himself creditably.</p>

<p>"My daughter, Imogene, Mr. Temple," said Mr. Davenport.</p>

<p>The other girl was probably a year younger, and as pretty as
Imogene was unattractive. But she was plainly dressed, and had
a timid, retiring look. In fact she was a poor cousin, a dependent
upon the lawyer’s bounty, and made to feel her position by all
the family.</p>

<p>"Mary Somers, Mr. Temple," said Mrs. Davenport slightingly.</p>

<p>Mary blushed, and offered her hand timidly to our hero.</p>

<p>"What a pretty girl!" thought Tom. "She’s ever so much prettier
than the other, but I guess from the old lady’s manner that she
hasn’t got the stamps."</p>

<p>They sat down to the dinner-table, which Tom saw with satisfaction
presented a very different appearance from the frugal board of
Mr. Middleton. It was a capital dinner, and Tom enjoyed it.</p>

<p>"I shouldn’t mind boarding here," he thought.</p>

<p>There was only one drawback. He was seated next to Imogene, when
he would have very much preferred a seat next to Mary Somers,
the poor cousin.</p>
