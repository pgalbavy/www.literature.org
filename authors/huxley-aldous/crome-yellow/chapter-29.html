<p>It was after ten o’clock. The dancers had already dispersed and
the last lights were being put out. To-morrow the tents would
be struck, the dismantled merry-go-round would be packed into
waggons and carted away. An expanse of worn grass, a shabby brown
patch in the wide green of the park, would be all that remained.
Crome Fair was over.</p>

<p>By the edge of the pool two figures lingered.</p>

<p>"No, no, no," Anne was saying in a breathless whisper, leaning
backwards, turning her head from side to side in an effort to
escape Gombauld’s kisses. "No, please. No." Her raised voice had
become imperative.</p>

<p>Gombauld relaxed his embrace a little. "Why not?" he said. "I
will."</p>

<p>With a sudden effort Anne freed herself. "You won’t," she retorted.
"You’ve tried to take the most unfair advantage of me."</p>

<p>"Unfair advantage?" echoed Gombauld in genuine surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, unfair advantage. You attack me after I’ve been dancing
for two hours, while I’m still reeling drunk with the movement,
when I’ve lost my head, when I’ve got no mind left but only a
rhythmical body! It’s as bad as making love to someone you’ve
drugged or intoxicated."</p>

<p>Gombauld laughed angrily. "Call me a White Slaver and have done
with it."</p>

<p>"Luckily," said Anne, "I am now completely sobered, and if you
try and kiss me again I shall box your ears. Shall we take a few
turns round the pool?" she added. "The night is delicious."</p>

<p>For answer Gombauld made an irritated noise. They paced off slowly,
side by side.</p>

<p>"What I like about the painting of Degas..." Anne began in her
most detached and conversational tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, damn Degas!" Gombauld was almost shouting.</p>

<p>From where he stood, leaning in an attitude of despair against
the parapet of the terrace, Denis had seen them, the two pale
figures in a patch of moonlight, far down by the pool’s edge.
He had seen the beginning of what promised to be an endless passionate
embracement, and at the sight he had fled. It was too much; he
couldn’t stand it. In another moment, he felt, he would have burst
into irrepressible tears.</p>

<p>Dashing blindly into the house, he almost ran into Mr. Scogan,
who was walking up and down the hall smoking a final pipe.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Mr. Scogan, catching him by the arm; dazed and
hardly conscious of what he was doing or where he was, Denis stood
there for a moment like a somnambulist. "What’s the matter?" Mr.
Scogan went on. "you look disturbed, distressed, depressed."</p>

<p>Denis shook his head without replying.</p>

<p>"Worried about the cosmos, eh?" Mr. Scogan patted him on the
arm. "I know the feeling," he said. "It’s a most distressing symptom.
‘What’s the point of it all? All is vanity. What’s the good of
continuing to function if one’s doomed to be snuffed out at last
along with everything else?’ Yes, yes. I know exactly how you
feel. It’s most distressing if one allows oneself to be distressed.
But then why allow oneself to be distressed? After all, we all
know that there’s no ultimate point. But what difference does
that make?"</p>

<p>At this point the somnambulist suddenly woke up. "What?" he said,
blinking and frowning at his interlocutor. "What?" Then breaking
away he dashed up the stairs, two steps at a time.</p>

<p>Mr. Scogan ran to the foot of the stairs and called up after
him. "It makes no difference, none whatever. Life is gay all the
same, always, under whatever circumstances&mdash;under whatever circumstances,"
he added, raising his voice to a shout. But Denis was already
far out of hearing, and even if he had not been, his mind to-night
was proof against all the consolations of philosophy. Mr. Scogan
replaced his pipe between his teeth and resumed his meditative
pacing. "Under any circumstances," he repeated to himself. It
was ungrammatical to begin with; was it true? And is life really
its own reward? He wondered. When his pipe had burned itself to
its stinking conclusion he took a drink of gin and went to bed.
In ten minutes he was deeply, innocently asleep.</p>

<p>Denis had mechanically undressed and, clad in those flowered
silk pyjamas of which he was so justly proud, was lying face downwards
on his bed. Time passed. When at last he looked up, the candle
which he had left alight at his bedside had burned down almost
to the socket. He looked at his watch; it was nearly half-past
one. His head ached, his dry, sleepless eyes felt as though they
had been bruised from behind, and the blood was beating within
his ears a loud arterial drum. He got up, opened the door, tiptoed
noiselessly along the passage, and began to mount the stairs towards
the higher floors. Arrived at the servants’ quarters under the
roof, he hesitated, then turning to the right he opened a little
door at the end of the corridor. Within was a pitch-dark cupboard-like
boxroom, hot, stuffy, and smelling of dust and old leather. He
advanced cautiously into the blackness, groping with his hands.
It was from this den that the ladder went up to the leads of the
western tower. He found the ladder, and set his feet on the rungs;
noiselessly, he lifted the trap-door above his head; the moonlit
sky was over him, he breathed the fresh, cool air of the night.
In a moment he was standing on the leads, gazing out over the
dim, colourless landscape, looking perpendicularly down at the
terrace seventy feet below.</p>

<p>Why had he climbed up to this high, desolate place? Was it to
look at the moon? Was it to commit suicide? As yet he hardly knew.
Death&mdash;the tears came into his eyes when he thought of it. His
misery assumed a certain solemnity; he was lifted up on the wings
of a kind of exaltation. It was a mood in which he might have
done almost anything, however foolish. He advanced towards the
farther parapet; the drop was sheer there and uninterrupted. A
good leap, and perhaps one might clear the narrow terrace and
so crash down yet another thirty feet to the sun-baked ground
below. He paused at the corner of the tower, looking now down
into the shadowy gulf below, now up towards the rare stars and
the waning moon. He made a gesture with his hand, muttered something,
he could not afterwards remember what; but the fact that he had
said it aloud gave the utterance a peculiarly terrible significance.
Then he looked down once more into the depths.</p>

<p>"What <em>ARE </em>you doing, Denis?" questioned a voice from
somewhere very close behind him.</p>

<p>Denis uttered a cry of frightened surprise, and very nearly went
over the parapet in good earnest. His heart was beating terribly,
and he was pale when, recovering himself, he turned round in the
direction from which the voice had come.</p>

<p>"Are you ill?"</p>

<p>In the profound shadow that slept under the eastern parapet of
the tower, he saw something he had not previously noticed&mdash;an
oblong shape. It was a mattress, and someone was lying on it.
Since that first memorable night on the tower, Mary had slept
out every evening; it was a sort of manifestation of fidelity.</p>

<p>"It gave me a fright," she went on, "to wake up and see you waving
your arms and gibbering there. What on earth were you doing?"</p>

<p>Denis laughed melodramatically. "What, indeed!" he said. If she
hadn’t woken up as she did, he would be lying in pieces at the
bottom of the tower; he was certain of that, now.</p>

<p>"You hadn’t got designs on me, I hope?" Mary inquired, jumping
too rapidly to conclusions.</p>

<p>"I didn’t know you were here," said Denis, laughing more bitterly
and artificially than before.</p>

<p>"What IS the matter, Denis?"</p>

<p>He sat down on the edge of the mattress, and for all reply went
on laughing in the same frightful and improbable tone.</p>

<p>An hour later he was reposing with his head on Mary’s knees,
and she, with an affectionate solicitude that was wholly maternal,
was running her fingers through his tangled hair. He had told
her everything, everything: his hopeless love, his jealousy, his
despair, his suicide&mdash;as it were providentially averted by her
interposition. He had solemnly promised never to think of self-destruction
again. And now his soul was floating in a sad serenity. It was
embalmed in the sympathy that Mary so generously poured. And it
was not only in receiving sympathy that Denis found serenity and
even a kind of happiness; it was also in giving it. For if he
had told Mary everything about his miseries, Mary, reacting to
these confidences, had told him in return everything, or very
nearly everything, about her own.</p>

<p>"Poor Mary!" He was very sorry for her. Still, she might have
guessed that Ivor wasn’t precisely a monument of constancy.</p>

<p>"Well," she concluded, "one must put a good face on it." She
wanted to cry, but she wouldn’t allow herself to be weak. There
was a silence.</p>

<p>"Do you think," asked Denis hesitatingly&mdash;"do you really think
that she...that Gombauld..."</p>

<p>"I’m sure of it," Mary answered decisively. There was another
long pause.</p>

<p>"I don’t know what to do about it," he said at last, utterly
dejected.</p>

<p>"You’d better go away," advised Mary. "It’s the safest thing,
and the most sensible."</p>

<p>"But I’ve arranged to stay here three weeks more."</p>

<p>"You must concoct an excuse."</p>

<p>"I suppose you’re right."</p>

<p>"I know I am," said Mary, who was recovering all her firm self-possession.
"You can’t go on like this, can you?"</p>

<p>"No, I can’t go on like this," he echoed.</p>

<p>Immensely practical, Mary invented a plan of action. Startlingly,
in the darkness, the church clock struck three.</p>

<p>"You must go to bed at once," she said. "I’d no idea it was so
late."</p>

<p>Denis clambered down the ladder, cautiously descended the creaking
stairs. His room was dark; the candle had long ago guttered to
extinction. He got into bed and fell asleep almost at once.</p>
