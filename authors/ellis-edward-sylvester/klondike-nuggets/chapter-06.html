<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Game is so scarce in the valley of the Upper Yukon and in the
Klondike country that many gold-seekers take no firearms at all
with them. Years ago the Indians showed occasional hostility toward
the missions and trading-posts, but nothing now is to be feared
from them. They are often hired to help carry loads through the
passes, and with that aptitude for imitating the white man, they
have speedily learned to charge high prices for their labor.</p>

<p>Before leaving Juneau, Jeff Graham presented each of his little
party with an excellent revolver, quoting the remark which a cowboy
once made to a tenderfoot:</p>

<p>"You may not want the weapon often, but when you do you'll want
it mighty bad."</p>

<p>Jeff took with him his own pistol which he had carried for years,
besides which he was provided with a fine Winchester rifle. He
knew he was not likely to find any use for it in shooting game,
but he grimly observed that if a pistol should prove handy, the
larger weapon was apt to prove much more so.</p>

<p>The Indian who engaged to take them to the foot of Lake Lindeman
was old, but wiry and tough, and understood his business. He could
speak a few words of English, which were enough for his purposes.
He raised a small soiled sail of canvas on the scow, and with
the help of a long pole kept the heavily laden craft moving. Although
the lake was open thus early in the season, the shores were lined
with ice, much of it extending into the water for a number of
rods. Huge cakes sometimes bumped against the scow, but they caused
no damage, and did not interfere with its progress.</p>

<p>The three men who had first engaged the boat looked as if they
had come a long distance. Our friends had no recollection of having
seen them on the steamer from Seattle or on the steam launch that
connects Juneau with Dyea at the head of Lynn Canal. Where they
came from, therefore, was a mystery, the probability being that
they had been loitering about Dyea for a long time, waiting for
the season to advance sufficiently to allow them to start for
the Yukon. They seemed reserved to the point of sullenness, keeping
by themselves and showing so much antipathy to any approach that
they were let alone.</p>

<p>But just before the foot of the lake, nearly six miles distant,
was reached, Frank Mansley made an interesting discovery. The
most ill-favored of the trio was an acquaintance of Ike Hardman.
No one else noticed the significant fact, and it was partly through
accident that the truth came to the lad.</p>

<p>The two men acted as if strangers, not exchanging a word on the
passage, and seemingly feeling no interest in each other. All
of Frank's friends were near the bow of the boat, looking to where
they were soon to touch shore. Two of the strangers were standing
just back of and near them, while Hardman was in the middle of
the boat, apparently watching the old Indian as he plied his paddle
with untiring vigor.</p>

<p>The third stranger was at the stern, seated on the gunwale, smoking
a clay pipe and seemingly taking no note of anything about him.
When Ike Hardman sauntered among the piles of luggage to the rear,
Frank was impelled by an impulse for which he could not account
to watch him. He had no well-defined suspicion, and least of all
did he suspect what proved to be the truth.</p>

<p>Hardman halted a few paces from the man sitting on the edge of
the boat, and, so far as appearances went, did not pay any attention
to him. A quick, furtive glance to the front put the lad on his
guard, and he, too, turned his face toward land, but his position
was such that he could look sideways at the two, while not seeming
to do so.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hardman, with his back partly toward the youth, made
a sign with his hands, the meaning of which Frank could not catch,
because the signal was not fully seen, but the fellow sitting
down nodded his head, and taking his pipe from between his lips,
said something in so guarded a voice that only the ears for which
the words were intended could understand them.</p>

<p>This brief interchange ought to have been enough, but Hardman
did not appear to think so. He stepped somewhat closer, and he,
too, spoke, still gesticulating with one of his hands. The man
addressed was impatient. He nodded again in a jerky fashion, and
made answer with less caution, as a consequence of which the eavesdropper
caught the words, "Yes, yes, to-night; I understand."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>SUDDENLY HARDMAN MADE A SIGN</em>.]</p>

<p>Hardman was satisfied, and came back to the front of the boat,
which was now approaching the shore. His friend smoked a few minutes
until the scow bumped against the projection of ice, and, the
old Indian leaping lightly out, carried the heavy stone anchor
as far as the rope would permit. This held the boat in place,
and the unloading began. The Indian offered to help for an extravagant
price, but his offer was refused, and the respective parties busied
themselves with their own work.</p>

<p>The discovery made by Frank Mansley caused him considerable uneasiness.
The dislike which he felt toward Hardman the first time he saw
him had never abated, and it was the same with his cousin. Young
as they were, they felt that a great mistake was made when Hardman
was allowed to join the party, and they wondered that Jeff permitted
it, but, as has been shown, they were too discreet to object.</p>

<p>That Hardman, on his part, detested the youths was apparent,
though he tried to conceal the feeling when he feared it might
attract the attention of others. He had little to say to them
or they to him. Frank decided to tell his chum of the discovery
he had made, and they would consult as to whether they should
take Jeff and Tim into their confidence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the trio gathered their loads upon their backs and
started northward without so much as calling good-by to those
whom they left behind, and who were not sorry to part company
with them.</p>

<p>The gold-hunters had had a little lift on their journey, but
it was not worth considering, in view of what remained before
them. A mile advance with sleds and their packs took them to the
head of Lake Bennet, where it may be said the navigation of the
Yukon really begins. The lake is about twenty-eight miles long,
contains a number of islands, and in going to the foot one passes
from Alaska into British Columbia. Along its shores were scores
of miners, busily engaged in building boats with which to make
the rest of the journey. Sad to say, owing to their impatience
and lack of skill, some of the boats were so flimsy and ill-constructed
that they were certain to go to pieces in the fierce rapids below,
and add their owners to the long list of victims whose bodies
strew the pathway from Chilkoot to the Upper Yukon.</p>

<p>Here, too, it became necessary for our friends to build a craft,
and since it was comparatively early in the day, Jeff and Tim,
each with an axe over his shoulder, went into the wood, already
partly cut down, Hardman accompanying them, in order to bear his
turn. The boys remained behind to guard the property, though their
neighbors were so occupied with their own affairs that they gave
them little heed. Frank took the opportunity to tell his companion
what he had observed on the boat while crossing the lake.</p>

<p>"Hardman has joined our company for some evil purpose," said
Roswell, "and the other man is his partner in the plot."</p>

<p>"But they are gone, and we may not see them again."</p>

<p>"One of them, at least, has an understanding with Hardman, and
will keep him within hailing distance."</p>

<p>"We will say nothing to Jeff or Tim until to-morrow; I fear that
we shall learn something to-night."</p>

<p>The boy was right in his supposition.</p>
