<p>He confessed his wickedness to Madame de Vaurigard the next afternoon
as they drove out the Appian Way. "A fellow must have just a bit
of a fling, you know," he said; "and, really, Salone Margherita
isn't so tremendously wicked."</p>

<p>She shook her head at him in friendly raillery. "Ah, that may
be; but how many of those little dancing-girl' have you invite
to supper afterward?"</p>

<p>This was a delicious accusation, and though he shook his head
in virtuous denial he was before long almost convinced that he
<em>had</em> given a rather dashing supper after the vaudeville
and had <em>not</em> gone quietly back to the hotel, only stopping
by the way to purchase an orange and a pocketful of horse-chestnuts
to eat in his room.</p>

<p>It was a happy drive for Robert Russ Mellin, though not happier
than that of the next day. Three afternoons they spent driving
over the Campagna, then back to Madame de Vaurigard's apartment
for tea by the firelight, till the enraptured American began to
feel that the dream in which he had come to live must of happy
necessity last forever.</p>

<p>On the fourth afternoon, as he stepped out of the hotel elevator
into the corridor, he encountered Mr. Sneyd.</p>

<p>"Just stottin', eh?" said the Englishman, taking an envelope
from his pocket. "Lucky I caught you. This is for you. I just
saw the Cantess and she teold me to give it you. Herry and read
it and kem on t' the Amairikin Baw. Chap I want you to meet. Eold
Cooley's thyah too. Gawt in with his tourin'-caw at noon."</p>

"You will forgive, dear friend," wrote Madame de Vaurigard,<br/>
"if I ask you that we renounce our drive to-day.  You see, I<br/>
wish to have that little dinner to-night and must make<br/>
preparation. Honorable Chandler Pedlow arrived this morning<br/>
from Paris and that droll Mr. Cooley I have learn is<br/>
coincidentally arrived also.  You see I think it would be<br/>
very pleasant to have the dinner to welcome these friends on<br/>
their arrival.  You will come surely&mdash;or I shall be so truly<br/>
miserable.  You know it perhaps too well!  We shall have a<br/>
happy evening if you come to console us for renouncing our<br/>
drive.  A thousand of my prettiest wishes for you.

<p>The signature alone consoled him. To have that note from her,
to own it, was like having one of her gloves or her fan. He would
keep it forever, he thought; indeed, he more than half expressed
a sentiment to that effect in the response which he wrote in the
aquarium, while Sneyd waited for him at a table near by. The Englishman
drew certain conclusions in regard to this reply, since it permitted
a waiting friend to consume three long tumblers of brandy-and-soda
before it was finished. However, Mr. Sneyd kept his reflections
to himself, and, when the epistle had been dispatched by a messenger,
took the American's arm and led him to the "American Bar" of the
hotel, a region hitherto unexplored by Mellin.</p>

<p>Leaning against the bar were Cooley and the man whom Mellin had
seen lolling beside Madame de Vaurigard in Cooley's automobile
in Paris, the same gross person for whom he had instantly conceived
a strong repugnance, a feeling not at once altered by a closer
view.</p>

<p>Cooley greeted Mellin uproariously and Mr. Sneyd introduced the
fat man. "Mr. Mellin, the Honorable Chandler Pedlow," he said;
nor was the shock to the first-named gentleman lessened by young
Cooley's adding, "Best feller in the world!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pedlow's eyes were sheltered so deeply beneath florid rolls
of flesh that all one saw of them was an inscrutable gleam of
blue; but, small though they were, they were not shifty, for they
met Mellin's with a squareness that was almost brutal. He offered
a fat paw, wet by a full glass which he set down too suddenly
on the bar.</p>

<p>"Shake," he said, in a loud and husky voice, "and be friends!
Tommy," he added to the attendant, "another round of Martinis."</p>

<p>"Not for me," said Mellin hastily. "I don't often&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>What!</em>" Mr. Pedlow roared suddenly. "Why, the first
words Countess de Vaurigard says to me this afternoon was, 'I
want you to meet my young friend Mellin,' she says; 'the gamest
little Indian that ever come down the pike! He's game,' she says&mdash;'he'll
see you <em>all</em> under the table!' That's what the smartest
little woman in the world, the Countess de Vaurigard, says about
you."</p>

<p>This did not seem very closely to echo Madame de Vaurigard's
habit of phrasing, but Mellin perceived that it might be only
the fat man's way of putting things.</p>

<p>"You ain't goin' back on <em>her</em>, are you?" continued Mr.
Pedlow. "You ain't goin' to make her out a liar? I tell you, when
the Countess de Vaurigard says a man 's game, he is game!" He
laid his big paw cordially on Mellin's shoulder and smiled, lowering
his voice to a friendly whisper. "And I'll bet ten thousand dollars
right out of my pants pocket you <em>are</em> game, too!"</p>

<p>He pressed a glass into the other's hand. Smiling feebly, the
embarrassed Mellin accepted it.</p>

<p>"Make it four more, Tommy," said Pedlow. "And here," continued
this thoughtful man, "I don't go bandying no ladies' names around
a bar-room&mdash;that ain't my style&mdash;but I do want to propose a toast.
I won't name her, but you all know who I mean."</p>

<p>"Sure we do," interjected Cooley warmly. "Queen! That's what
she is."</p>

<p>"Here's <em>to</em> her," continued Mr. Pedlow. "Here's to her&mdash;brightest
and best&mdash;and no heel-taps! And now let's set down over in the
corner and take it easy. It ain't hardly five o'clock yet, and
we can set here comfortable, gittin' ready for dinner, until half-past
six, anyway."</p>

<p>Whereupon the four seated themselves about a tabouret in the
corner, and, a waiter immediately bringing them four fresh glasses
from the bar, Mellin began to understand what Mr. Pedlow meant
by "gittin' ready for dinner." The burden of the conversation
was carried almost entirely by the Honorable Chandler, though
Cooley, whose boyish face was deeply flushed, now and then managed
to interrupt by talking louder than the fat man. Mr. Sneyd sat
silent.</p>

<p>"Good ole Sneyd," said Pedlow. "<em>He</em> never talks, jest
saws wood. Only Britisher I ever liked. Plays cards like a goat."</p>

<p>"He played a mighty good game on the steamer," said Cooley warmly.</p>

<p>"I don't care what he did on the steamer, he played like a goat
the only time <em>I</em> ever played with him. You know he did.
I reckon you was <em>there!</em>"</p>

<p>"Should say I <em>was</em> there! He played mighty well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like a goat," reiterated the fat man firmly.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort. You had a run of hands, that was all. Nobody
can go against the kind of luck you had that night; and you took
it away from Sneyd and me in rolls. But we'll land you pretty
soon, won't we, ole Sneydie?"</p>

<p>"We sh'll have a shawt at him, at least," said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he won't want us to try," young Cooley pursued derisively.
"Perhaps he thinks I play like a goat, too!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pedlow threw back his head and roared. "Give me somep'n easy!
You don't know no more how to play a hand of cards than a giraffe
does. I'll throw in all of my Blue Gulch gold-stock&mdash;and it's
worth eight hundred thousand dollars if it's worth a cent &mdash;I'll
put it up against that tin automobile of yours, divide chips even
and play you freeze-out for it. You play cards? Go learn hop-scotch!"</p>

<p>"You wait!" exclaimed the other indignantly. "Next time we play
we'll make you look so small you'll think you're back in Congress!"</p>

<p>At this Mr. Pedlow again threw back his head and roared, his
vast body so shaken with mirth that the glass he held in his hand
dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>"There," said Cooley, "that's the second Martini you've spilled.
You're two behind the rest of us."</p>

<p>"What of it?" bellowed the fat man. "There's plenty comin', ain't
there? Four more, Tommy, and bring cigars. Don't take a cent from
none of these Indians. Gentlemen, your money ain't good here.
I own this bar, and this is my night."</p>

<p>Mellin had begun to feel at ease, and after a time&mdash;as they continued
to sit&mdash;he realized that his repugnance to Mr. Pedlow was wearing
off; he felt that there must be good in any one whom Madame de
Vaurigard liked. She had spoken of Pedlow often on their drives;
he was an "eccentric,"  she said, an "original." Why not accept
her verdict? Besides, Pedlow was a man of distinction and force;
he had been in Congress; he was a millionaire; and, as became
evident in the course of a long recital of the principal events
of his career, most of the great men of the time were his friends
and proteges.</p>

<p>"'Well, Mack,' says I one day when we were in the House together"&mdash;(thus
Mr. Pedlow, alluding to the late President McKinley)&mdash;"'Mack,'
says I, 'if you'd drop that double standard business'&mdash;he was
waverin' toward silver along then&mdash;'I don't know but I might git
the boys to nominate you fer President.' 'I'll think it over,'
he says&mdash;'I'll think it over.' You remember me tellin' you about
that at the time, don't you, Sneyd, when you was in the British
Legation at Washin'ton?"</p>

<p>"Pahfictly," said Mr. Sneyd, lighting a cigar with great calmness.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I says, 'Mack,' I says, 'if you'll drop it, I'll turn
in and git you the nomination.'"</p>

<p>"Did he drop it?" asked Mellin innocently.</p>

<p>Mr. Pedlow leaned forward and struck the young man's knee a resounding
blow with the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>"He was <em>nominated</em>, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Time to dress," announced Mr. Sneyd, looking at his watch.</p>

<p>"One more round first," insisted Cooley with prompt vehemence.
"Let's finish with our first toast again. Can't drink that too
often."</p>

<p>This proposition was received with warmest approval, and they
drank standing. "Brightest and best!" shouted Mr. Pedlow.</p>

<p>"Queen! What she is!" exclaimed Cooley.</p>

<p><em>"Ma belle Marquise!"</em> whispered Mellin tenderly, as the
rim touched his lips.</p>

<p>A small, keen-faced man, whose steady gray eyes were shielded
by tortoise-rimmed spectacles, had come into the room and now
stood quietly at the bar, sipping a glass of Vichy. He was sharply
observant of the party as it broke up, Pedlow and Sneyd preceding
the younger men to the corridor, and, as the latter turned to
follow, the stranger stepped quickly forward, speaking Cooley's
name.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't remember me. My name's Cornish. I'm a newspaper
man, a correspondent." (He named a New York paper.) "I'm down
here to get a Vatican story. I knew your father for a number of
years before his death, and I think I may claim that he was a
friend of mine."</p>

<p>"That's good," said the youth cordially. "If I hadn't a fine
start already, and wasn't in a hurry to dress, we'd have another."</p>

<p>"You were pointed out to me in Paris," continued Cornish. "I
found where you were staying and called on you the next day, but
you had just started for the Riviera." He hesitated, glancing
at Mellin. "Can you give me half a dozen words with you in private?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to excuse me, I'm afraid. I've only got about ten
minutes to dress. See you to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I should like it to be as soon as possible," the journalist
said seriously. "It isn't on my own account, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right. You come to my room at ten t'morrow morning?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you can't possibly make it to-night," said Cornish
reluctantly. "I wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't possibly."</p>

<p>And Cooley, taking Mellin by the arm, walked rapidly down the
corridor. "Funny ole correspondent," he murmured. "What do <em>I</em>
know about the Vatican?"</p>
