<p>For a moment the airman stood watching and listening. The whir
of the receding car died away in the night.</p>

<p>Then, carrying his bundle and his bomber’s sack, heavy with latent
death, he went into the inn and through the café, where the sleeping
innkeeper sat huddled, and felt his way cautiously to the little
dining room.</p>

<p>The wooden shutters had been closed; a candle flared on the table.
Maryette sat beside it, her arms extended across the cloth, her
head bowed.</p>

<p>He thought she was asleep, but she looked up as his footfall
sounded on the bare floor.</p>

<p>She was so pale that he asked her if she felt ill.</p>

<p>"No. I have been thinking of my friend," she replied in a low
but steady voice.</p>

<p>"He may live," said the airman. "He was alive when we lifted
him."</p>

<p>The girl nodded as though preoccupied&mdash;an odd, mysterious little
nod, as though assenting to some intimate, inward suggestion of
her own mind.</p>

<p>Then she raised her dark blue eyes to the airman, who was still
standing beside the table, the sack of bombs hanging from his
left shoulder, the bundle under his arm.</p>

<p>"Here is supper," she said, looking around absently at the few
dishes. Then she folded her hands on the table’s edge and sat
silent, as though lost in thought.</p>

<p>He placed the sack carefully on a cane chair beside him, the
bundle on the floor, and seated himself opposite her. There was
bread, meat, and a bottle of red wine. The girl declined to eat,
saying that she had supped.</p>

<p>"Your friend Jack," he said again, after a long silence, " &mdash;I
have seen worse cases. He may live, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"That," she said musingly, in her low, even voice, "is now in
God’s hands." She gave the slightest movement to her shoulders,
as though easing them a trifle of that burden. "I have prayed.
You saw me weep. That is ended&mdash;so much. Now&mdash;" and across her
eyes shot a blue gleam, "&mdash;now I am ready to listen to <em>you</em>!
In the cart&mdash;out on the road there&mdash;you said that anybody can
weep, but that few dare avenge."</p>

<p>"Yes," he drawled, "I said that."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; tell me <em>how</em>!"</p>

<p>"What do <em>you</em> want to avenge? Your friend?"</p>

<p>"His country’s honour, and mine! If he had been slain&mdash;otherwise
&mdash;I should have perhaps mourned him, confident in the law
of France. But &mdash;I have seen the Rhenish swine on French
soil &mdash;I saw the Boches do this thing in France. It is not
merely my friend I desire to avenge; it is the triple crime against
his life, against the honour of his country and of mine." She
had not raised her voice; had not stirred in her chair.</p>

<p>The airman, who had stopped eating, sat with fork in hand, listening,
regarding her intently.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, resuming his meal, "I understand quite well what
you mean. Some such philosophy sent my elder brother and me over
here from New York&mdash;the wild hogs trampling through Belgium&mdash;the
ferocious herds from the Rhine defacing, defiling, rending, obliterating
all that civilized man has reverenced for centuries.... That’s
the idea&mdash;the world-wide menace of these unclean hordes&mdash;and the
murderous filth of them!... They got my brother."</p>

<p>He shrugged, realizing that his face had flushed with the heat
of inner fires.</p>

<p>"Coolness does it," he added, almost apologetically, "&mdash;method
and coolness. The world must keep its head clear: yellow fever
and smallpox have been nearly stamped out; the Hun can be eliminated&mdash;with
intelligence and clear thinking.... And I’m only an American airman
who has been shot down like a winged heron whose comrades have
lingered a little to comfort him and have gone on.... Yes, but
a winged heron can still stab, little mistress of the bells....
And every blow counts.... Listen attentively&mdash;for Jack’s sake
... and for the sake of France. For I am going to explain to you
how you can strike&mdash;if you want to."</p>

<p>"I am listening," said Maryette serenely.</p>

<p>"We may not live through it. Even my orders do not send me to
do this thing; they merely permit it. Are you contented to go
with me?"</p>

<p>She nodded, the shadow of a smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"Very well. You play the carillon?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You can play ’La Brabançonne’?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"On the bells?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He rose, went around the table, carrying his chair with him,
and seated himself beside her. She inclined her pale, pretty head;
he placed his lips close to her ear, speaking very slowly and
distinctly, explaining his plan in every minute detail.</p>

<p>While he was still speaking in a whisper, the street outside
filled with the trample of arriving cavalry. The Spahis were leaving
the environs of Sainte Lesse; <em>chasseurs à cheval</em> followed
from still farther afield, escorting ambulances from the Nivelle
hospitals now being abandoned.</p>

<p>"The trenches at Nivelle are being emptied," said the airman.</p>

<p>"And do you mean that you and I are to go there, to Nivelle?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I mean. In an hour I shall be in the Nivelle
belfry. Will you be there with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" he exclaimed. "You can play ’La Brabançonne’ on
the bells while I blow hell out of them in the redoubt below us!"</p>

<p>The infantry from the Nivelle trenches began to pass. There were
a few wagons, a battery of seventy-fives, a soup kitchen or two
and a long column of mules from Fontanes.</p>

<p>Two American muleteers knocked at the inn door and came stamping
into the hallway, asking for a loaf and a bottle of red wine.
Maryette rose from the table to find provisions; the airman got
up also, saying in English:</p>

<p>"Where do you come from, boys?"</p>

<p>"From Fontanes corral," they replied, surprised to hear their
own tongue spoken.</p>

<p>"Do you know Jack Burley, one of your people?"</p>

<p>"Sure. He’s just been winged bad."</p>

<p>"The Huns done him up something fierce," added the other.</p>

<p>"Very bad?"</p>

<p>Maryette came back with a loaf and two bottles.</p>

<p>"I seen him at Fontanes," replied the muleteer, taking the provisions
from the girl. "He’s all shot to pieces, but they say he’ll pull
through."</p>

<p>The airman turned to Maryette:</p>

<p>"Jack will get well," he translated bluntly.</p>

<p>The girl, who had just refused the money offered by the American
muleteer, turned sharply, became deadly white for a second, then
her face flamed with a hot and splendid colour.</p>

<p>One of the muleteers said:</p>

<p>"Is this here his girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the airman.</p>

<p>The muleteer became voluble, patting Maryette on one arm and
then on the other:</p>

<p>"J’ai vue Jack Burley, mamzelle, toot a l’heure! Il est bien,
savvy voo! Il est tray, tray bien! Bocoo de trou! N’importe! Il
va tray bien! Savvy voo? Jack Burley, l’ami de voo! Comprenny?
On va le guerir toot sweet! Wee! Wee! Wee!&#11834;"</p>

<p>The girl flung her arms around the amazed muleteer’s neck and
kissed him impetuously on both cheeks. The muleteer blushed and
his comrade fidgeted. Only the girl remained unembarrassed.</p>

<p>Half laughing, half crying, terribly excited, and very lovely
to look upon, she caught both muleteers by their sleeves and poured
out a torrent of questions. With the airman’s aid she extracted
what information they had to offer; and they went their way, flustered,
still blushing, clasping bread and bottles to their agitated breasts.</p>

<p>The airman looked her keenly in the eyes as she came back from
the door, still intensely excited, adorably transfigured. She
opened her lips to speak&mdash;the happy exclamation on her lips, already
half uttered, died there.</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired the airman quietly.</p>

<p>Dumb, still breathing rapidly, she returned his gaze in silence.</p>

<p>"Now that your friend Jack is going to live&mdash;what next?" asked
the airman pleasantly.</p>

<p>For a full minute she continued to stare at him without a word.</p>

<p>"No need to avenge him now," added the airman, watching her.</p>

<p>"No." She turned, gazed vaguely into space. After a moment she
said, as though to herself: "But his country’s honour&mdash;and mine?
That reckoning still remains! Is it not true?"</p>

<p>The airman said, with a trace of pity in his voice, for the girl
seemed very young:</p>

<p>"You need not go with me to Nivelle just because you promised."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said simply, "I must go, of course&mdash;it being a question
of our country’s honour."</p>

<p>"I do not ask it. Nor would Jack, your friend. Nor would your
own country ask it of you, Maryette Courtray."</p>

<p>She replied serenely:</p>

<p>"But <em>I</em> ask it&mdash;of <em>myself</em>. Do you understand,
monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly." He glanced mechanically at his useless wrist watch,
then inquired the time. She went to her room, returned, wearing
a little jacket and carrying a pair of big, wooden gloves.</p>

<p>"It is after eleven o’clock," she said. "I brought my jacket
because it is cold in all belfries. It will be cold in Nivelle,
up there in the tower under Clovis."</p>

<p>"You really mean to go with me?"</p>

<p>She did not even trouble to reply to the question. So he picked
up his packet and his sack of bombs, and they went out, side by
side, under the tunnelled wall.</p>

<p>Infantry from Nivelle trenches were still plodding along the
dark street under the trees; dull gleams came from their helmets
and bayonets in the obscure light of the stars.</p>

<p>The girl stood watching them for a few moments, then her hand
sought the airman’s arm:</p>

<p>"If there is to be a battle in the street here, my father cannot
remain."</p>

<p>The airman nodded, went out into the street and spoke to a passing
officer. He, in turn, signalled the driver of a motor omnibus
to halt.</p>

<p>The little bell-mistress entered the tavern, followed by two
soldiers. In a few moments they came out bearing, chair-fashion
between them, the crippled innkeeper.</p>

<p>The old man was much alarmed, but his daughter followed beside
him to the omnibus, in which were several lamed soldiers.</p>

<p>"<em>Et toi?</em>" he quavered as they lifted him in. "What of
thee, Maryette?"</p>

<p>"I follow," she called out cheerily. "I rejoin thee&mdash;" the bus
moved on&mdash;"God knows when or where!" she added under her breath.</p>

<p>The airman was whispering to a fat staff officer when she rejoined
him. All three looked up in silence at the belfry of Sainte Lesse,
looming above them, a monstrous shadow athwart the stars. A moment
later an automobile, arriving from the south, drew up in front
of the inn.</p>

<p>"<em>Bonne chance</em>," said the fat officer abruptly; he turned
and waddled swiftly away in the darkness. They saw him mount his
horse. His legs stuck out sideways.</p>

<p>"Now," whispered the airman, with a nod to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>The little bell-mistress entered the car, her wooden gloves tucked
under one arm. The airman followed with his packet and his sack
of bombs. The chauffeur started his engine.</p>

<p>The middle of the road was free to him; the edges were occupied
by the retreating infantry. As the car started, very slowly, cautiously
feeling its way out of Sainte Lesse, the fat staff officer turned
his horse and trotted up alongside. The car stopped, the engine
still running.</p>

<p>"It’s understood?" asked the officer in a low voice. "It’s to
be when we hear ’La Brabançonne’?"</p>

<p>"When you hear ’La Brabançonne.’"</p>

<p>"Understood," said the staff officer crisply, saluted and drew
bridle. And the car moved out into the starlit night along an
endless column of retreating soldiers, who were laughing, smoking,
and chatting as though not in the least depressed by their withdrawal
from the dry and cosy trenches of Nivelle which they were abandoning.</p>
