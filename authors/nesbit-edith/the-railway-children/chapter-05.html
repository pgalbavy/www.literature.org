<p>It was one day when Mother had gone to Maidbridge.  She had gone
alone, but the children were to go to the station to meet her.  And,
loving the station as they did, it was only natural that they should
be there a good hour before there was any chance of Mother's train
arriving, even if the train were punctual, which was most unlikely.
No doubt they would have been just as early, even if it had been a
fine day, and all the delights of woods and fields and rocks and
rivers had been open to them.  But it happened to be a very wet day
and, for July, very cold.  There was a wild wind that drove flocks
of dark purple clouds across the sky &quot;like herds of dream-
elephants,&quot; as Phyllis said.  And the rain stung sharply, so that
the way to the station was finished at a run.  Then the rain fell
faster and harder, and beat slantwise against the windows of the
booking office and of the chill place that had General Waiting Room
on its door.</p>

<p>&quot;It's like being in a besieged castle,&quot; Phyllis said; &quot;look at the
arrows of the foe striking against the battlements!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's much more like a great garden-squirt,&quot; said Peter.</p>

<p>They decided to wait on the up side, for the down platform looked
very wet indeed, and the rain was driving right into the little
bleak shelter where down-passengers have to wait for their trains.</p>

<p>The hour would be full of incident and of interest, for there would
be two up trains and one down to look at before the one that should
bring Mother back.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps it'll have stopped raining by then,&quot; said Bobbie; &quot;anyhow,
I'm glad I brought Mother's waterproof and umbrella.&quot;</p>

<p>They went into the desert spot labelled General Waiting Room, and
the time passed pleasantly enough in a game of advertisements.  You
know the game, of course?  It is something like dumb Crambo.  The
players take it in turns to go out, and then come back and look as
like some advertisement as they can, and the others have to guess
what advertisement it is meant to be.  Bobbie came in and sat down
under Mother's umbrella and made a sharp face, and everyone knew she
was the fox who sits under the umbrella in the advertisement.
Phyllis tried to make a Magic Carpet of Mother's waterproof, but it
would not stand out stiff and raft-like as a Magic Carpet should,
and nobody could guess it.  Everyone thought Peter was carrying
things a little too far when he blacked his face all over with coal-
dust and struck a spidery attitude and said he was the blot that
advertises somebody's Blue Black Writing Fluid.</p>

<p>It was Phyllis's turn again, and she was trying to look like the
Sphinx that advertises What's-his-name's Personally Conducted Tours
up the Nile when the sharp ting of the signal announced the up
train.  The children rushed out to see it pass.  On its engine were
the particular driver and fireman who were now numbered among the
children's dearest friends.  Courtesies passed between them.  Jim
asked after the toy engine, and Bobbie pressed on his acceptance a
moist, greasy package of toffee that she had made herself.</p>

<p>Charmed by this attention, the engine-driver consented to consider
her request that some day he would take Peter for a ride on the
engine.</p>

<p>&quot;Stand back, Mates,&quot; cried the engine-driver, suddenly, &quot;and horf
she goes.&quot;</p>

<p>And sure enough, off the train went.  The children watched the tail-
lights of the train till it disappeared round the curve of the line,
and then turned to go back to the dusty freedom of the General
Waiting Room and the joys of the advertisement game.</p>

<p>They expected to see just one or two people, the end of the
procession of passengers who had given up their tickets and gone
away.  Instead, the platform round the door of the station had a
dark blot round it, and the dark blot was a crowd of people.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Peter, with a thrill of joyous excitement, &quot;something's
happened!  Come on!&quot;</p>

<p>They ran down the platform.  When they got to the crowd, they could,
of course, see nothing but the damp backs and elbows of the people
on the crowd's outside.  Everybody was talking at once.  It was
evident that something had happened.</p>

<p>&quot;It's my belief he's nothing worse than a natural,&quot; said a
farmerish-looking person.  Peter saw his red, clean-shaven face as
he spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;If you ask me, I should say it was a Police Court case,&quot; said a
young man with a black bag.</p>

<p>&quot;Not it; the Infirmary more like - &quot;</p>

<p>Then the voice of the Station Master was heard, firm and official: - </p>

<p>&quot;Now, then - move along there.  I'll attend to this, if YOU please.&quot;</p>

<p>But the crowd did not move.  And then came a voice that thrilled the
children through and through.  For it spoke in a foreign language.
And, what is more, it was a language that they had never heard.
They had heard French spoken and German.  Aunt Emma knew German, and
used to sing a song about bedeuten and zeiten and bin and sin.  Nor
was it Latin.  Peter had been in Latin for four terms.</p>

<p>It was some comfort, anyhow, to find that none of the crowd
understood the foreign language any better than the children did.</p>

<p>&quot;What's that he's saying?&quot; asked the farmer, heavily.</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds like French to me,&quot; said the Station Master, who had once
been to Boulogne for the day.</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't French!&quot; cried Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, then?&quot; asked more than one voice.  The crowd fell back
a little to see who had spoken, and Peter pressed forward, so that
when the crowd closed up again he was in the front rank.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know what it is,&quot; said Peter, &quot;but it isn't French.  I know
that.&quot;  Then he saw what it was that the crowd had for its centre.
It was a man - the man, Peter did not doubt, who had spoken in that
strange tongue.  A man with long hair and wild eyes, with shabby
clothes of a cut Peter had not seen before - a man whose hands and
lips trembled, and who spoke again as his eyes fell on Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's not French,&quot; said Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;Try him with French if you know so much about it,&quot; said the farmer-
man.</p>

<p>&quot;Parlay voo Frongsay?&quot; began Peter, boldly, and the next moment the
crowd recoiled again, for the man with the wild eyes had left
leaning against the wall, and had sprung forward and caught Peter's
hands, and begun to pour forth a flood of words which, though he
could not understand a word of them, Peter knew the sound of.</p>

<p>&quot;There!&quot; said he, and turned, his hands still clasped in the hands
of the strange shabby figure, to throw a glance of triumph at the
crowd; &quot;there; THAT'S French.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What does he say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know.&quot;  Peter was obliged to own it.</p>

<p>&quot;Here,&quot; said the Station Master again; &quot;you move on if you please.
I'LL deal with this case.&quot;</p>

<p>A few of the more timid or less inquisitive travellers moved slowly
and reluctantly away.  And Phyllis and Bobbie got near to Peter.
All three had been TAUGHT French at school.  How deeply they now
wished that they had LEARNED it!  Peter shook his head at the
stranger, but he also shook his hands as warmly and looked at him as
kindly as he could.  A person in the crowd, after some hesitation,
said suddenly, &quot;No comprenny!&quot; and then, blushing deeply, backed out
of the press and went away.</p>

<p>&quot;Take him into your room,&quot; whispered Bobbie to the Station Master.
&quot;Mother can talk French.  She'll be here by the next train from
Maidbridge.&quot;</p>

<p>The Station Master took the arm of the stranger, suddenly but not
unkindly.  But the man wrenched his arm away, and cowered back
coughing and trembling and trying to push the Station Master away.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, don't!&quot; said Bobbie; &quot;don't you see how frightened he is?  He
thinks you're going to shut him up.  I know he does - look at his
eyes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They're like a fox's eyes when the beast's in a trap,&quot; said the
farmer.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, let me try!&quot; Bobbie went on; &quot;I do really know one or two
French words if I could only think of them.&quot;</p>

<p>Sometimes, in moments of great need, we can do wonderful things - 
things that in ordinary life we could hardly even dream of doing.
Bobbie had never been anywhere near the top of her French class, but
she must have learned something without knowing it, for now, looking
at those wild, hunted eyes, she actually remembered and, what is
more, spoke, some French words.  She said: - </p>

<p>&quot;Vous attendre.  Ma mere parlez Francais.  Nous - what's the French
for 'being kind'?&quot;</p>

<p>Nobody knew.</p>

<p>&quot;Bong is 'good,'&quot; said Phyllis.</p>

<p>&quot;Nous etre bong pour vous.&quot;</p>

<p>I do not know whether the man understood her words, but he
understood the touch of the hand she thrust into his, and the
kindness of the other hand that stroked his shabby sleeve.</p>

<p>She pulled him gently towards the inmost sanctuary of the Station
Master.  The other children followed, and the Station Master shut
the door in the face of the crowd, which stood a little while in the
booking office talking and looking at the fast closed yellow door,
and then by ones and twos went its way, grumbling.</p>

<p>Inside the Station Master's room Bobbie still held the stranger's
hand and stroked his sleeve.</p>

<p>&quot;Here's a go,&quot; said the Station Master; &quot;no ticket - doesn't even
know where he wants to go.  I'm not sure now but what I ought to
send for the police.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, DON'T!&quot; all the children pleaded at once.  And suddenly Bobbie
got between the others and the stranger, for she had seen that he
was crying.</p>

<p>By a most unusual piece of good fortune she had a handkerchief in
her pocket.  By a still more uncommon accident the handkerchief was
moderately clean.  Standing in front of the stranger, she got out
the handkerchief and passed it to him so that the others did not
see.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait till Mother comes,&quot; Phyllis was saying; &quot;she does speak French
beautifully.  You'd just love to hear her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure he hasn't done anything like you're sent to prison for,&quot;
said Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;Looks like without visible means to me,&quot; said the Station Master.
&quot;Well, I don't mind giving him the benefit of the doubt till your
Mamma comes.  I SHOULD like to know what nation's got the credit of
HIM, that I should.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Peter had an idea.  He pulled an envelope out of his pocket,
and showed that it was half full of foreign stamps.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here,&quot; he said, &quot;let's show him these - &quot;</p>

<p>Bobbie looked and saw that the stranger had dried his eyes with her
handkerchief.  So she said:  &quot;All right.&quot;</p>

<p>They showed him an Italian stamp, and pointed from him to it and
back again, and made signs of question with their eyebrows.  He
shook his head.  Then they showed him a Norwegian stamp - the common
blue kind it was - and again he signed No.  Then they showed him a
Spanish one, and at that he took the envelope from Peter's hand and
searched among the stamps with a hand that trembled.  The hand that
he reached out at last, with a gesture as of one answering a
question, contained a RUSSIAN stamp.</p>

<p>&quot;He's Russian,&quot; cried Peter, &quot;or else he's like 'the man who was' - 
in Kipling, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>The train from Maidbridge was signalled.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll stay with him till you bring Mother in,&quot; said Bobbie.</p>

<p>&quot;You're not afraid, Missie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Bobbie, looking at the stranger, as she might have
looked at a strange dog of doubtful temper.  &quot;You wouldn't hurt me,
would you?&quot;</p>

<p>She smiled at him, and he smiled back, a queer crooked smile.  And
then he coughed again.  And the heavy rattling swish of the incoming
train swept past, and the Station Master and Peter and Phyllis went
out to meet it.  Bobbie was still holding the stranger's hand when
they came back with Mother.</p>

<p>The Russian rose and bowed very ceremoniously.</p>

<p>Then Mother spoke in French, and he replied, haltingly at first, but
presently in longer and longer sentences.</p>

<p>The children, watching his face and Mother's, knew that he was
telling her things that made her angry and pitying, and sorry and
indignant all at once.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Mum, what's it all about?&quot;  The Station Master could not
restrain his curiosity any longer.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Mother, &quot;it's all right.  He's a Russian, and he's lost
his ticket.  And I'm afraid he's very ill.  If you don't mind, I'll
take him home with me now.  He's really quite worn out.  I'll run
down and tell you all about him to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you won't find you're taking home a frozen viper,&quot; said the
Station Master, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Mother said brightly, and she smiled; &quot;I'm quite sure I'm
not.  Why, he's a great man in his own country, writes books - 
beautiful books - I've read some of them; but I'll tell you all about
it to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>She spoke again in French to the Russian, and everyone could see the
surprise and pleasure and gratitude in his eyes.  He got up and
politely bowed to the Station Master, and offered his arm most
ceremoniously to Mother.  She took it, but anybody could have seen
that she was helping him along, and not he her.</p>

<p>&quot;You girls run home and light a fire in the sitting-room,&quot; Mother
said, &quot;and Peter had better go for the Doctor.&quot;</p>

<p>But it was Bobbie who went for the Doctor.</p>

<p>&quot;I hate to tell you,&quot; she said breathlessly when she came upon him
in his shirt sleeves, weeding his pansy-bed, &quot;but Mother's got a
very shabby Russian, and I'm sure he'll have to belong to your Club.
I'm certain he hasn't got any money.  We found him at the station.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Found him!  Was he lost, then?&quot; asked the Doctor, reaching for his
coat.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Bobbie, unexpectedly, &quot;that's just what he was.  He's
been telling Mother the sad, sweet story of his life in French; and
she said would you be kind enough to come directly if you were at
home.  He has a dreadful cough, and he's been crying.&quot;</p>

<p>The Doctor smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, don't,&quot; said Bobbie; &quot;please don't.  You wouldn't if you'd seen
him.  I never saw a man cry before.  You don't know what it's like.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Forrest wished then that he hadn't smiled.</p>

<p>When Bobbie and the Doctor got to Three Chimneys, the Russian was
sitting in the arm-chair that had been Father's, stretching his feet
to the blaze of a bright wood fire, and sipping the tea Mother had
made him.</p>

<p>&quot;The man seems worn out, mind and body,&quot; was what the Doctor said;
&quot;the cough's bad, but there's nothing that can't be cured.  He ought
to go straight to bed, though - and let him have a fire at night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll make one in my room; it's the only one with a fireplace,&quot; said
Mother.  She did, and presently the Doctor helped the stranger to
bed.</p>

<p>There was a big black trunk in Mother's room that none of the
children had ever seen unlocked.  Now, when she had lighted the
fire, she unlocked it and took some clothes out - men's clothes - and
set them to air by the newly lighted fire.  Bobbie, coming in with
more wood for the fire, saw the mark on the night-shirt, and looked
over to the open trunk.  All the things she could see were men's
clothes.  And the name marked on the shirt was Father's name.  Then
Father hadn't taken his clothes with him.  And that night-shirt was
one of Father's new ones.  Bobbie remembered its being made, just
before Peter's birthday.  Why hadn't Father taken his clothes?
Bobbie slipped from the room.  As she went she heard the key turned
in the lock of the trunk.  Her heart was beating horribly.  WHY
hadn't Father taken his clothes?  When Mother came out of the room,
Bobbie flung tightly clasping arms round her waist, and whispered: - </p>

<p>&quot;Mother - Daddy isn't - isn't DEAD, is he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My darling, no!  What made you think of anything so horrible?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I - I don't know,&quot; said Bobbie, angry with herself, but still
clinging to that resolution of hers, not to see anything that Mother
didn't mean her to see.</p>

<p>Mother gave her a hurried hug.  &quot;Daddy was quite, QUITE well when I
heard from him last,&quot; she said, &quot;and he'll come back to us some day.
Don't fancy such horrible things, darling!&quot;</p>

<p>Later on, when the Russian stranger had been made comfortable for
the night, Mother came into the girls' room.  She was to sleep there
in Phyllis's bed, and Phyllis was to have a mattress on the floor, a
most amusing adventure for Phyllis.  Directly Mother came in, two
white figures started up, and two eager voices called: - </p>

<p>&quot;Now, Mother, tell us all about the Russian gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p>A white shape hopped into the room.  It was Peter, dragging his
quilt behind him like the tail of a white peacock.</p>

<p>&quot;We have been patient,&quot; he said, &quot;and I had to bite my tongue not to
go to sleep, and I just nearly went to sleep and I bit too hard, and
it hurts ever so.  DO tell us.  Make a nice long story of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't make a long story of it to-night,&quot; said Mother; &quot;I'm very
tired.&quot;</p>

<p>Bobbie knew by her voice that Mother had been crying, but the others
didn't know.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, make it as long as you can,&quot; said Phil, and Bobbie got her
arms round Mother's waist and snuggled close to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's a story long enough to make a whole book of.  He's a
writer; he's written beautiful books.  In Russia at the time of the
Czar one dared not say anything about the rich people doing wrong,
or about the things that ought to be done to make poor people better
and happier.  If one did one was sent to prison.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But they CAN'T,&quot; said Peter; &quot;people only go to prison when they've
done wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or when the Judges THINK they've done wrong,&quot; said Mother.  &quot;Yes,
that's so in England.  But in Russia it was different.  And he wrote
a beautiful book about poor people and how to help them.  I've read
it.  There's nothing in it but goodness and kindness.  And they sent
him to prison for it.  He was three years in a horrible dungeon,
with hardly any light, and all damp and dreadful.  In prison all
alone for three years.&quot;</p>

<p>Mother's voice trembled a little and stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>&quot;But, Mother,&quot; said Peter, &quot;that can't be true NOW.  It sounds like
something out of a history book - the Inquisition, or something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It WAS true,&quot; said Mother; &quot;it's all horribly true.  Well, then
they took him out and sent him to Siberia, a convict chained to
other convicts - wicked men who'd done all sorts of crimes - a long
chain of them, and they walked, and walked, and walked, for days and
weeks, till he thought they'd never stop walking.  And overseers
went behind them with whips - yes, whips - to beat them if they got
tired.  And some of them went lame, and some fell down, and when
they couldn't get up and go on, they beat them, and then left them
to die.  Oh, it's all too terrible!  And at last he got to the
mines, and he was condemned to stay there for life - for life, just
for writing a good, noble, splendid book.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did he get away?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When the war came, some of the Russian prisoners were allowed to
volunteer as soldiers.  And he volunteered.  But he deserted at the
first chance he got and - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But that's very cowardly, isn't it&quot; - said Peter - &quot;to desert?
Especially when it's war.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think he owed anything to a country that had done THAT to
him?  If he did, he owed more to his wife and children.  He didn't
know what had become of them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; cried Bobbie, &quot;he had THEM to think about and be miserable
about TOO, then, all the time he was in prison?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, he had them to think about and be miserable about all the time
he was in prison.  For anything he knew they might have been sent to
prison, too.  They did those things in Russia.  But while he was in
the mines some friends managed to get a message to him that his wife
and children had escaped and come to England.  So when he deserted
he came here to look for them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Had he got their address?&quot; said practical Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;No; just England.  He was going to London, and he thought he had to
change at our station, and then he found he'd lost his ticket and
his purse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, DO you think he'll find them? - I mean his wife and children,
not the ticket and things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope so.  Oh, I hope and pray that he'll find his wife and
children again.&quot;</p>

<p>Even Phyllis now perceived that mother's voice was very unsteady.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mother,&quot; she said, &quot;how very sorry you seem to be for him!&quot;</p>

<p>Mother didn't answer for a minute.  Then she just said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and
then she seemed to be thinking.  The children were quiet.</p>

<p>Presently she said, &quot;Dears, when you say your prayers, I think you
might ask God to show His pity upon all prisoners and captives.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To show His pity,&quot; Bobbie repeated slowly, &quot;upon all prisoners and
captives.  Is that right, Mother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mother, &quot;upon all prisoners and captives.  All prisoners
and captives.&quot;</p>
