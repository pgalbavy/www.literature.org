<p>"Well, I'll tell you," confided Big Boy, moving closer to Old Bunk and
lowering his voice mysteriously, "I know you'll think I'm crazy, but
there's something to that stuff. Maybe we don't understand it, and of
course there's a lot of fakes, but I got this from Mother Trigedgo.
She's that Cornish seeress, that predicted the big cave in the stope of
the Last Chance mine, and now I <u>know</u> she's good. She tells
fortunes by cards and by pouring water in your hand and going into a
trance. Then she looks into the water and sees a kind of vision of all
that is going to happen. Well, here's what she said for me--and she
wrote it down on a paper.
</p><p>"'You will soon make a journey to the west and there, in the shadow of a
place of death, you will find two treasures, one of silver and the other
of gold. Choose well between the two and----"
</p><p>"By grab, that's right, boy!" exclaimed Old Bunk enthusiastically, "she
described this place down to a hickey. You came west from Globe and when
you went by here the shadow was still on those hills; and as for a place
of death, Apache Leap got its name from the Indians that jumped over
that cliff. Say, you could hunt all over Arizona and not find another
place that came within a mile of it!"
</p><p>"That's right," mused Big Boy, "but I was thinking all the time that
that place of death would be a graveyard."
</p><p>"Sure, but how could a graveyard cast a shadow--they're always on level
ground. No, I'm telling you, boy, that there cliff is the place--lemme
tell you how it got its name. A long time ago when the Indians were bad
they had a soldiers' post right here where this town stands, and they
kept a lookout up on the Picket Post butte, where they could heliograph
clear down to Tucson. Well, every time a bunch of Indians would go down
out of the hills to raid some wagon-train on the trail this lookout
would see them and signal Tucson and the soldiers would do the rest. It
got so bymeby the Indians couldn't do anything and at last Old Cochise
got together about eight hundred Apaches and came over to wipe out the
post. It looked easy at the time, because there was less than two
hundred men, but the major in command was a fighting fool and didn't
know when he was whipped. The Apaches all gathered up on the top of
those high cliffs--it's flat on the upper side--and one night when their
signal fires had burned down the soldiers sneaked around behind them.
And then, just at dawn, they fired a volley and made a rush for the
camp; and before they knowed it about two hundred Indians had jumped
clean over the cliff. They killed the rest of them--all but two or three
bucks that fought their way through the line--and now, by grab, you
couldn't get an Indian up there if you'd offer him a quart of whiskey.
It's sure bad medicine for Apaches."
</p><p>"Isn't it wonderful!" exclaimed Big Boy, "there's no use talking--this
sure is the place of death. And say, next time you go over to Globe you
go and see Mother Trigedgo--I just want to tell you what she did!"
</p><p>"All right," sighed Old Bunk, who preferred to talk business, and he
settled down to listen.
</p><p>"This Mother Trigedgo," began Big Boy, "isn't an ordinary, cheap
fortune-teller. Those people are all fakes because they're just out for
the dollar and tell you what they think you want to know. But Mother
Trigedgo keeps a Cousin-Jack boarding house and only prophesies when she
feels the power. Sometimes she'll go along for a week or more and never
tell a fortune; and then, when she happens to be feeling right, she'll
tell some feller what's coming to him. Those Cousin Jacks are crazy
about what she can do, but I never went to a seeress in my life until
after we had that big cave. I'm a timber man, you see, and sometimes I
take contracts to catch up dangerous ground; and the best men in the
world when it comes to that work are these old-country Cousin Jacks.
They're nervy and yet they're careful and so I always hire 'em; but when
we were doing this work down in the stope of the Last Chance, they began
talking about Mother Trigedgo. It seems she'd told the fortune of a boy
or two--they were all of them boarding at her house--and she was so
worried she could hardly cook on account of them working in this mine.
It was swelling ground and there were a lot of old workings where the
timbering had given way; and to tell you the truth I didn't like it
myself, although I wouldn't admit it."
</p><p>"Well, it was the twenty-second of April, and all that morning we could
hear the ground working over head and when it came noon we went up
above, as we says, for a breath of fresh air. But while we were eating,
there was a Cousin Jack named Chambers fetched up this old talk about
Mother Trigedgo, and how she'd predicted he'd be killed in a cave if he
didn't quit working in the stope; and when our half-hour's nooning was
up he says: 'I'll not go down that shaft!'
</p><p>"We were all badly scared, because that ground was always moving, and
finally we agreed that we'd take a full hour off and work till five
o'clock. Well, we waited till after one before we went to the collar and
just as I was stepping into the cage the whole danged stope caved in!"
</p><p>"Well, sir, I went back to my room and got every dollar I had and gave
Mother Trigedgo the roll. I could easy earn more but if I'd been caught
in that cave they'd never even tried to dig me out. That was the least I
could do, considering what she'd done for me; but Mother Trigedgo took
on so much about it that I told her it was to have my fortune told.
Well, she tried the cards and dice and consulted the signs of the
Zodiac; and then one day when she felt the power strong she poured a
little water in my hand. That made a kind of pool, like these
crystal-gazers use, and when she looked into it she began to talk and
she told me all about my life. Or that is, she told me what she thought
I ought to know, and gave me a copy of the Book of Fate that Napoleon
always consulted. And here it ain't three months till I make this
journey west and find the place she prophesied."
</p><p>"Yes, and silver, too!" added Old Bunk portentously, "she hit it, down
to a hickey. And now, if you'd like to inspect those claims----"
</p><p>"No, hold on," protested Big Boy still pondering on his fate, "I've got
to find these treasures myself. And one of them was of gold. What's the
chances around here for that?"
</p><p>"Danged poor," grumbled Bunker as he saw his hopes gone glimmering,
"don't remember to have seen a color. But say, old Bible Back is
drilling for copper and that's a good deal like gold. Same color,
practically, and you know all these prophecies have a kind of symbolical
meaning. A golden treasure don't necessarily mean gold, and I've got a
claim----"
</p><p>"Say, who's that up there?" broke in Big Boy uneasily and Old Bunk
looked around with a jerk.
</p><p>An old, white-haired man, wearing a battered cork helmet, was peering
over the bank and when he perceived that his presence was discovered he
came shuffling down the trail. He was a short, fat man, in faded shirt
and overalls; and on his feet he wore a pair of gunboat brogans, thickly
studded on the bottom with hob-nails. A space of six inches between the
tops of his shoes and the worn-off edge of his trousers exposed his
shrunken shanks, and he carried a stick which might serve for cane or
club as circumstances demanded. He came down briskly with his broad toes
turned out in grotesque resemblance to a duck and when Bunker Hill saw
him he snorted resentfully and rose up from his seat.
</p><p>"Have you seen my burros?" demanded the old man, half defiantly, "I
can't find dose rascals nowhere. Ah, so; here's a stranger come to camp!
Good morning, I'm glad to know you."
</p><p>"Good morning," returned Big Boy glancing doubtfully at Bunker Hill, "my
name is Denver Russell."
</p><p>"Oh, excuse <u>me</u>!" spoke up Bunker with a sarcastic drawl, "Mr.
Russell, this is Professor Diffenderfer, the eminent buttinsky and
geologist."
</p><p>"Ah--so!" beamed the Professor overlooking the fling in the excitement
of the meeting, "I take it you're a mining man? Vell, if it's golt
you're looking for I haf a claim up on dat hill dat is rich in
auriferous deposits."
</p><p>"Yes," broke in Bunker giving Big Boy a sly wink, "you ought to inspect
that tunnel--it's unique in the annals of mining. You see the Professor
here is an educated man--he's learned all the big words in the
dictionary, and he's learned mining from reading Government reports.
We're quite proud of his achievements as a mining engineer, but you
ought to see that tunnel. It starts into the hill, takes a couple of
corkscrew twists and busts right out into the sunshine."
</p><p>"Oh, never mind <u>him</u>!" protested the Professor as Bunker burst
into a roar, "he will haf his choke, of course. But dis claim I speak
of----"
</p><p>"And that ain't all his accomplishments," broke in Bunker Hill
relentlessly, "Mr. Diffenderfer is a count--a German count--sometimes
known as Count No-Count. But as I was about to say, his greatest
accomplishments have been along tonsorial lines."
</p><p>A line of pain appeared between the Professor's eyes--but he stood his
ground defiantly. "Yes," went on Bunker thrusting out his jaw in a
baleful leer at his rival, "for many years he has had the proud
distinction of being the Champion Rough-Riding Barber of Arizona."
</p><p>"Vell, I've got to go," murmured the Professor hastily, "I've got to
find dem burros."
</p><p>He started off but at the plank across the creek he stopped and cleared
his throat. "Und any time," he began, "dat you'd like to inspect dem
claims----"
</p><p>"The Champeen--Rough-Riding--Barber!" repeated Old Bunk with gusto, "he
won his title on the race-track at Tucson, before safety razors was
invented."
</p><p>"Shut up!" snapped the Professor and, crossing the plank with waspish
quickness, he went squattering off down the creek. Yet one ear was
turned back and as Bunker began to speak he stopped in the trail to
listen.
</p><p>"He took a drunken cowboy up in the saddle before him," went on Bunker
with painful distinctness, "and gave him a close shave while the horse
was bucking, only cutting his throat three times."
</p><p>"You're a liar!" yelled the Professor and, stamping his foot, he hustled
vengefully off down the trail.
</p><p>"Say, who is that old boy?" enquired Big Boy curiously, "he might know
where I'd find that gold."
</p><p>"Who--him?" jeered Bunker, "why, that old stiff wouldn't know a chunk of
gold if he saw it. All he does is to snoop around and watch what
<u>I'm</u> doing, and if he ever thinks that I've picked up a live one
he butts in and tries to underbid me. Now I'll tell you what I'll do,
I'll get you a horse and show you all over the district, and any claim
I've got that you want to go to work on, you can have for five hundred
dollars. Now, that's reasonable, ain't it? And yet, the way things are
going, I'm glad to let you in on it. If you strike something big, here
I've got my store and mine, and plenty of other claims, to boot; and if
there's a rush I stand to make a clean-up on some of my other
properties. So come up to the house and meet my wife and daughter, and
we'll try to make you comfortable. But that old feller----"
</p><p>"Nope," said Big Boy, "I think I'd rather camp--who lives in those
cave-houses up there?"
</p><p>He jerked his head at some walled-up caves in the bluff not far across
the creek and Old Bunk scowled reproachfully.
</p><p>"Oh, nobody," he said, "except the rattle-snakes and pack-rats. Why
don't you come up to the house?"
</p><p>"I don't need to go to your house," returned Big Boy defiantly. "I've
got money to buy what I need."
</p><p>"Yes, but come up anyway and meet my wife and daughter. Drusilla is a
musician--she's studied in Boston at the celebrated Conservatory of
Music----"
</p><p>"I've got me a phonograph," answered Big Boy shortly, "if I can ever get
it over here from Globe."
</p><p>"Well, go ahead and get it, then," said Bunker Hill tartly, "they's
nobody keeping you, I'm sure."
</p><p>"No, and you bet your life there won't be," came back Big Boy, starting
off, "I'm playing a lone hand to win."
