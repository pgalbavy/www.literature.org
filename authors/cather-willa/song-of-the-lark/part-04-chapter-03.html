<p>THE faculty of observation was never highly developed in Thea Kronborg.
A great deal escaped her eye as she passed through the world. But the
things which were for her, she saw; she experienced them physically and
remembered them as if they had once been a part of herself. The roses
she used to see in the florists' shops in Chicago were merely roses. But
when she thought of the moonflowers that grew over Mrs. Tellamantez's
door, it was as if she had been that vine and had opened up in white
flowers every night. There were memories of light on the sand hills, of
masses of prickly-pear blossoms she had found in the desert in early
childhood, of the late afternoon sun pouring through the grape leaves
and the mint bed in Mrs. Kohler's garden, which she would never lose.
These recollections were a part of her mind and personality. In Chicago
she had got almost nothing that went into her subconscious self and took
root there. But here, in Panther Canyon, there were again things which
seemed destined for her.
</p><p>Panther Canyon was the home of innumerable swallows. They built nests in
the wall far above the hollow groove in which Thea's own rock chamber
lay. They seldom ventured above the rim of the canyon, to the flat,
wind-swept tableland. Their world was the blue air-river between the
canyon walls. In that blue gulf the arrow-shaped birds swam all day
long, with only an occasional movement of the wings. The only sad thing
about them was their timidity; the way in which they lived their lives
between the echoing cliffs and never dared to rise out of the shadow of
the canyon walls. As they swam past her door, Thea often felt how easy
it would be to dream one's life out in some cleft in the world.
</p><p>From the ancient dwelling there came always a dignified, unobtrusive
sadness; now stronger, now fainter,--like the aromatic smell which the
dwarf cedars gave out in the sun,--but always present, a part of the air
one breathed. At night, when Thea dreamed about the canyon,--or in the
early morning when she hurried toward it, anticipating it,--her
conception of it was of yellow rocks baking in sunlight, the swallows,
the cedar smell, and that peculiar sadness--a voice out of the past, not
very loud, that went on saying a few simple things to the solitude
eternally.
</p><p>Standing up in her lodge, Thea could with her thumb nail dislodge flakes
of carbon from the rock roof--the cooking-smoke of the Ancient People.
They were that near! A timid, nest-building folk, like the swallows. How
often Thea remembered Ray Kennedy's moralizing about the cliff cities.
He used to say that he never felt the hardness of the human struggle or
the sadness of history as he felt it among those ruins. He used to say,
too, that it made one feel an obligation to do one's best. On the first
day that Thea climbed the water trail she began to have intuitions about
the women who had worn the path, and who had spent so great a part of
their lives going up and down it. She found herself trying to walk as
they must have walked, with a feeling in her feet and knees and loins
which she had never known before,--which must have come up to her out of
the accustomed dust of that rocky trail. She could feel the weight of an
Indian baby hanging to her back as she climbed.
</p><p>The empty houses, among which she wandered in the afternoon, the
blanketed one in which she lay all morning, were haunted by certain
fears and desires; feelings about warmth and cold and water and physical
strength. It seemed to Thea that a certain understanding of those old
people came up to her out of the rock shelf on which she lay; that
certain feelings were transmitted to her, suggestions that were simple,
insistent, and monotonous, like the beating of Indian drums. They were
not expressible in words, but seemed rather to translate themselves into
attitudes of body, into degrees of muscular tension or relaxation; the
naked strength of youth, sharp as the sunshafts; the crouching
timorousness of age, the sullenness of women who waited for their
captors. At the first turning of the canyon there was a half-ruined
tower of yellow masonry, a watch-tower upon which the young men used to
entice eagles and snare them with nets. Sometimes for a whole morning
Thea could see the coppery breast and shoulders of an Indian youth there
against the sky; see him throw the net, and watch the struggle with the
eagle.
</p><p>Old Henry Biltmer, at the ranch, had been a great deal among the Pueblo
Indians who are the descendants of the Cliff-Dwellers. After supper he
used to sit and smoke his pipe by the kitchen stove and talk to Thea
about them. He had never found any one before who was interested in his
ruins. Every Sunday the old man prowled about in the canyon, and he had
come to know a good deal more about it than he could account for. He had
gathered up a whole chestful of Cliff-Dweller relics which he meant to
take back to Germany with him some day. He taught Thea how to find
things among the ruins: grinding-stones, and drills and needles made of
turkey-bones. There were fragments of pottery everywhere. Old Henry
explained to her that the Ancient People had developed masonry and
pottery far beyond any other crafts. After they had made houses for
themselves, the next thing was to house the precious water. He explained
to her how all their customs and ceremonies and their religion went back
to water. The men provided the food, but water was the care of the
women. The stupid women carried water for most of their lives; the
cleverer ones made the vessels to hold it. Their pottery was their most
direct appeal to water, the envelope and sheath of the precious element
itself. The strongest Indian need was expressed in those graceful jars,
fashioned slowly by hand, without the aid of a wheel.
</p><p>When Thea took her bath at the bottom of the canyon, in the sunny pool
behind the screen of cottonwoods, she sometimes felt as if the water
must have sovereign qualities, from having been the object of so much
service and desire. That stream was the only living thing left of the
drama that had been played out in the canyon centuries ago. In the
rapid, restless heart of it, flowing swifter than the rest, there was a
continuity of life that reached back into the old time. The glittering
thread of current had a kind of lightly worn, loosely knit personality,
graceful and laughing. Thea's bath came to have a ceremonial gravity.
The atmosphere of the canyon was ritualistic.
</p><p>One morning, as she was standing upright in the pool, splashing water
between her shoulder-blades with a big sponge, something flashed through
her mind that made her draw herself up and stand still until the water
had quite dried upon her flushed skin. The stream and the broken
pottery: what was any art but an effort to make a sheath, a mould in
which to imprison for a moment the shining, elusive element which is
life itself,--life hurrying past us and running away, too strong to
stop, too sweet to lose? The Indian women had held it in their jars. In
the sculpture she had seen in the Art Institute, it had been caught in a
flash of arrested motion. In singing, one made a vessel of one's throat
and nostrils and held it on one's breath, caught the stream in a scale
of natural intervals.
