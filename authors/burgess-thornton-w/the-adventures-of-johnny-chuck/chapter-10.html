<p>
Anger is an awful thing;<br/>
It never stops to reason.<br/>
It boils right over all at once,<br/>
No matter what the season.

<p>It was so with Johnny Chuck. The minute he caught sight of the
strange Chuck over by the lone elm-tree, anger filled his heart
and fairly boiled over, until he was in a terrible rage. Of course
it was foolish, very foolish indeed. The strange Chuck hadn't
said or done anything to make Johnny Chuck angry, not the least
thing in the world, excepting to come down on to the Green Meadows.
Now the Green Meadows are very broad, and there is room for many
Chucks. It was pure selfishness on the part of Johnny Chuck to
want to drive away every other Chuck.</p>

<p>But anger never stops to reason. It didn't now. Johnny Chuck
hurried as fast as his short legs could take him towards the lone
elm-tree, and in his mind was just one thought&mdash;to drive that
strange Chuck off the Green Meadows and to punish him so that
he never, never would dare even think of coming back. So great
was Johnny's anger that every hair stood on end, and as he ran
he chattered and scolded.</p>

<p>"I'll fix him! These are my Green Meadows, and no one else has
any business here unless I say so! I'll fix him! I'll fix him!"</p>

<p>Then Johnny would grind his teeth, and in his eyes was the ugliest
look. He wasn't nice to see, not a bit nice. The Merry Little
Breezes of Old Mother West Wind didn't know what to make of him.
Could this be the Johnny Chuck they had known so long, the good-natured,
happy Johnny Chuck whom everybody loved? They drew away from him,
for they didn't want anything to do with any one in such a frightful
temper. But Johnny Chuck didn't even notice, and if he had he
wouldn't have cared. That is the trouble with anger. It crowds
out everything else, when it once fills the heart.</p>

<p>When Johnny had first seen the stranger, he had thought right
away that it was the old gray Chuck with whom he had had such
a terrible fight the day before and whom he whipped. Perhaps that
was one reason for Johnny Chuck's terrible anger now, for the
old gray Chuck had tried to drive Johnny Chuck off the Green Meadows.</p>

<p>But when he had to stop for breath and sat up to look again,
he saw that it wasn't the old gray Chuck at all. It was a younger
Chuck and much smaller than the old gray Chuck. It was smaller
than Johnny himself.</p>

<p>"He'll be all the easier to whip," muttered Johnny, as he started
on again, never once thinking of how unfair it would be to fight
with one smaller than himself. That was because he was so angry.
Anger never is fair.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he reached the lone elm-tree. The stranger wasn't
to be seen! No, Sir, the stranger wasn't anywhere in sight. Johnny
Chuck sat up and looked this way and looked that way, but the
stranger was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Johnny Chuck, "He's afraid to fight! He's a coward.
But he can't get away from me so easily. He's hiding, and I'll
find him and then&#11834;" Johnny didn't finish, but he ground his
teeth, and it wasn't a pleasant sound to hear.</p>

<p>So Johnny Chuck hunted for the stranger, and the longer he hunted
the angrier he grew. Somehow the stranger managed to keep out
of his sight. He was almost ready to give up, when he almost stumbled
over the stranger, hiding in a little clump of bushes. And then
a funny thing happened. What do you think it was?</p>

<p>Why, all the anger left Johnny Chuck. His hair no longer stood
on end. He didn't know why, but all of a sudden he felt foolish,
very foolish indeed.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded gruffly.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I'm Polly Chuck," replied the stranger, in a small,
timid voice.</p>
