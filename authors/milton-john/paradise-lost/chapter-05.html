 <BR>
Now Morn her rosie steps in th' Eastern Clime <BR>
Advancing, sow'd the Earth with Orient Pearle, <BR>
When ADAM wak't, so customd, for his sleep <BR>
Was Aerie light, from pure digestion bred, <BR>
And temperat vapors bland, which th' only sound <BR>
Of leaves and fuming rills, AURORA's fan, <BR>
Lightly dispers'd, and the shrill Matin Song <BR>
Of Birds on every bough; so much the more <BR>
His wonder was to find unwak'nd EVE <BR>
With Tresses discompos'd, and glowing Cheek, <BR>
As through unquiet rest: he on his side <BR>
Leaning half-rais'd, with looks of cordial Love <BR>
Hung over her enamour'd, and beheld <BR>
Beautie, which whether waking or asleep, <BR>
Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice <BR>
Milde, as when ZEPHYRUS on FLORA breathes, <BR>
Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus.  Awake <BR>
My fairest, my espous'd, my latest found, <BR>
Heav'ns last best gift, my ever new delight, <BR>
Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field <BR>
Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring <BR>
Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove, <BR>
What drops the Myrrhe, &amp; what the balmie Reed, <BR>
How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee <BR>
Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet. <BR>
<BR>
  Such whispering wak'd her, but with startl'd eye <BR>
On ADAM, whom imbracing, thus she spake. <BR>
<BR>
  O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, <BR>
My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see <BR>
Thy face, and Morn return'd, for I this Night, <BR>
Such night till this I never pass'd, have dream'd, <BR>
If dream'd, not as I oft am wont, of thee, <BR>
Works of day pass't, or morrows next designe, <BR>
But of offence and trouble, which my mind <BR>
Knew never till this irksom night; methought <BR>
Close at mine ear one call'd me forth to walk <BR>
With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said, <BR>
Why sleepst thou EVE? now is the pleasant time, <BR>
The cool, the silent, save where silence yields <BR>
To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake <BR>
Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignes <BR>
Full Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing light <BR>
Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain, <BR>
If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes, <BR>
Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire, <BR>
In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment <BR>
Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze. <BR>
I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; <BR>
To find thee I directed then my walk; <BR>
And on, methought, alone I pass'd through ways <BR>
That brought me on a sudden to the Tree <BR>
Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd, <BR>
Much fairer to my Fancie then by day: <BR>
And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood <BR>
One shap'd &amp; wing'd like one of those from Heav'n <BR>
By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd <BR>
Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd; <BR>
And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd, <BR>
Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet, <BR>
Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd? <BR>
Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste? <BR>
Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold <BR>
Longer thy offerd good, why else set here? <BR>
This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous Arme <BR>
He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd <BR>
At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold: <BR>
But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine, <BR>
Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt, <BR>
Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit <BR>
For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men: <BR>
And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more <BR>
Communicated, more abundant growes, <BR>
The Author not impair'd, but honourd more? <BR>
Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic EVE, <BR>
Partake thou also; happie though thou art, <BR>
Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be: <BR>
Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods <BR>
Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind, <BR>
But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes <BR>
Ascend to Heav'n, by merit thine, and see <BR>
What life the Gods live there, and such live thou. <BR>
So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, <BR>
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part <BR>
Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell <BR>
So quick'nd appetite, that I, methought, <BR>
Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the Clouds <BR>
With him I flew, and underneath beheld <BR>
The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide <BR>
And various: wondring at my flight and change <BR>
To this high exaltation; suddenly <BR>
My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down, <BR>
And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak'd <BR>
To find this but a dream!  Thus EVE her Night <BR>
Related, and thus ADAM answerd sad. <BR>
<BR>
  Best Image of my self and dearer half, <BR>
The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep <BR>
Affects me equally; nor can I like <BR>
This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear; <BR>
Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none, <BR>
Created pure.  But know that in the Soule <BR>
Are many lesser Faculties that serve <BR>
Reason as chief; among these Fansie next <BR>
Her office holds; of all external things, <BR>
Which the five watchful Senses represent, <BR>
She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes, <BR>
Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames <BR>
All what we affirm or what deny, and call <BR>
Our knowledge or opinion; then retires <BR>
Into her private Cell when Nature rests. <BR>
Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes <BR>
To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes, <BR>
Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams, <BR>
Ill matching words and deeds long past or late. <BR>
Som such resemblances methinks I find <BR>
Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream, <BR>
But with addition strange; yet be not sad. <BR>
Evil into the mind of God or Man <BR>
May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave <BR>
No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope <BR>
That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream, <BR>
Waking thou never wilt consent to do. <BR>
Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looks <BR>
That wont to be more chearful and serene <BR>
Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World, <BR>
And let us to our fresh imployments rise <BR>
Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours <BR>
That open now thir choicest bosom'd smells <BR>
Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store. <BR>
<BR>
  So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard, <BR>
But silently a gentle tear let fall <BR>
From either eye, and wip'd them with her haire; <BR>
Two other precious drops that ready stood, <BR>
Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell <BR>
Kiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse <BR>
And pious awe, that feard to have offended. <BR>
<BR>
  So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste. <BR>
But first from under shadie arborous roof, <BR>
Soon as they forth were come to open sight <BR>
Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen <BR>
With wheels yet hov'ring o're the Ocean brim, <BR>
Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray, <BR>
Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East <BR>
Of Paradise and EDENS happie Plains, <BR>
Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began <BR>
Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid <BR>
In various style, for neither various style <BR>
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise <BR>
Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc't or sung <BR>
Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence <BR>
Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse, <BR>
More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp <BR>
To add more sweetness, and they thus began. <BR>
<BR>
  These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, <BR>
Almightie, thine this universal Frame, <BR>
Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then! <BR>
Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens <BR>
To us invisible or dimly seen <BR>
In these thy lowest works, yet these declare <BR>
Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine: <BR>
Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light, <BR>
Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs <BR>
And choral symphonies, Day without Night, <BR>
Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav'n, <BR>
On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll <BR>
Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. <BR>
Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night, <BR>
If better thou belong not to the dawn, <BR>
Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn <BR>
With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare <BR>
While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime. <BR>
Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule, <BR>
Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise <BR>
In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st, <BR>
And when high Noon hast gaind, &amp; when thou fallst. <BR>
Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli'st <BR>
With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies, <BR>
And yee five other wandring Fires that move <BR>
In mystic Dance not without Song, resound <BR>
His praise, who out of Darkness call'd up Light. <BR>
Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth <BR>
Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run <BR>
Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix <BR>
And nourish all things, let your ceasless change <BR>
Varie to our great Maker still new praise. <BR>
Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise <BR>
From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey, <BR>
Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold, <BR>
In honour to the Worlds great Author rise, <BR>
Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie, <BR>
Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers, <BR>
Rising or falling still advance his praise. <BR>
His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow, <BR>
Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines, <BR>
With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave. <BR>
Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow, <BR>
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise. <BR>
Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds, <BR>
That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend, <BR>
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise; <BR>
Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk <BR>
The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep; <BR>
Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven, <BR>
To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade <BR>
Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise. <BR>
Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still <BR>
To give us onely good; and if the night <BR>
Have gathered aught of evil or conceald, <BR>
Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark. <BR>
<BR>
  So pray'd they innocent, and to thir thoughts <BR>
Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm. <BR>
On to thir mornings rural work they haste <BR>
Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row <BR>
Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr <BR>
Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check <BR>
Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine <BR>
To wed her Elm; she spous'd about him twines <BR>
Her mariageable arms, and with her brings <BR>
Her dowr th' adopted Clusters, to adorn <BR>
His barren leaves.  Them thus imploid beheld <BR>
With pittie Heav'ns high King, and to him call'd <BR>
RAPHAEL, the sociable Spirit, that deign'd <BR>
To travel with TOBIAS, and secur'd <BR>
His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid. <BR>
<BR>
  RAPHAEL, said hee, thou hear'st what stir on Earth <BR>
SATAN from Hell scap't through the darksom Gulf <BR>
Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd <BR>
This night the human pair, how he designes <BR>
In them at once to ruin all mankind. <BR>
Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend <BR>
Converse with ADAM, in what Bowre or shade <BR>
Thou find'st him from the heat of Noon retir'd, <BR>
To respit his day-labour with repast, <BR>
Or with repose; and such discourse bring on, <BR>
As may advise him of his happie state, <BR>
Happiness in his power left free to will, <BR>
Left to his own free Will, his Will though free, <BR>
Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware <BR>
He swerve not too secure: tell him withall <BR>
His danger, and from whom, what enemie <BR>
Late falln himself from Heav'n, is plotting now <BR>
The fall of others from like state of bliss; <BR>
By violence, no, for that shall be withstood, <BR>
But by deceit and lies; this let him know, <BR>
Least wilfully transgressing he pretend <BR>
Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake th' Eternal Father, and fulfilld <BR>
All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint <BR>
After his charge receivd, but from among <BR>
Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood <BR>
Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light <BR>
Flew through the midst of Heav'n; th' angelic Quires <BR>
On each hand parting, to his speed gave way <BR>
Through all th' Empyreal road; till at the Gate <BR>
Of Heav'n arriv'd, the gate self-opend wide <BR>
On golden Hinges turning, as by work <BR>
Divine the sov'ran Architect had fram'd. <BR>
From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, <BR>
Starr interpos'd, however small he sees, <BR>
Not unconform to other shining Globes, <BR>
Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crownd <BR>
Above all Hills.  As when by night the Glass <BR>
Of GALILEO, less assur'd, observes <BR>
Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon: <BR>
Or Pilot from amidst the CYCLADES <BR>
DELOS or SAMOS first appeering kenns <BR>
A cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight <BR>
He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie <BR>
Sailes between worlds &amp; worlds, with steddie wing <BR>
Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann <BR>
Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare <BR>
Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems <BR>
A PHOENIX, gaz'd by all, as that sole Bird <BR>
When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's <BR>
Bright Temple, to AEGYPTIAN THEB'S he flies. <BR>
At once on th' Eastern cliff of Paradise <BR>
He lights, and to his proper shape returns <BR>
A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade <BR>
His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad <BR>
Each shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brest <BR>
With regal Ornament; the middle pair <BR>
Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round <BR>
Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold <BR>
And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet <BR>
Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile <BR>
Skie-tinctur'd grain.  Like MAIA'S son he stood, <BR>
And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filld <BR>
The circuit wide.  Strait knew him all the bands <BR>
Of Angels under watch; and to his state, <BR>
And to his message high in honour rise; <BR>
For on som message high they guessd him bound. <BR>
Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come <BR>
Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe, <BR>
And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme; <BR>
A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here <BR>
Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will <BR>
Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet, <BR>
Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss. <BR>
Him through the spicie Forrest onward com <BR>
ADAM discernd, as in the dore he sat <BR>
Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun <BR>
Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme <BR>
Earths inmost womb, more warmth then ADAM need; <BR>
And EVE within, due at her hour prepar'd <BR>
For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please <BR>
True appetite, and not disrelish thirst <BR>
Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream, <BR>
Berrie or Grape: to whom thus ADAM call'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Haste hither EVE, and worth thy sight behold <BR>
Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape <BR>
Comes this way moving; seems another Morn <BR>
Ris'n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav'n <BR>
To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe <BR>
This day to be our Guest.  But goe with speed, <BR>
And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure <BR>
Abundance, fit to honour and receive <BR>
Our Heav'nly stranger; well we may afford <BR>
Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow <BR>
From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies <BR>
Her fertil growth, and by disburd'ning grows <BR>
More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus EVE. ADAM, earths hallowd mould, <BR>
Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store, <BR>
All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; <BR>
Save what by frugal storing firmness gains <BR>
To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: <BR>
But I will haste and from each bough and break, <BR>
Each Plant &amp; juciest Gourd will pluck such choice <BR>
To entertain our Angel guest, as hee <BR>
Beholding shall confess that here on Earth <BR>
God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n. <BR>
<BR>
  So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste <BR>
She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent <BR>
What choice to chuse for delicacie best, <BR>
What order, so contriv'd as not to mix <BR>
Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring <BR>
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change, <BR>
Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk <BR>
Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds <BR>
In INDIA East or West, or middle shoare <BR>
In PONTUS or the PUNIC Coast, or where <BR>
ALCINOUS reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate, <BR>
Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell <BR>
She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board <BR>
Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape <BR>
She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes <BR>
From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest <BR>
She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold <BR>
Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground <BR>
With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd. <BR>
Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet <BR>
His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train <BR>
Accompani'd then with his own compleat <BR>
Perfections, in himself was all his state, <BR>
More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits <BR>
On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long <BR>
Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold <BR>
Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape. <BR>
Neerer his presence ADAM though not awd, <BR>
Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, <BR>
As to a superior Nature, bowing low, <BR>
<BR>
  Thus said.  Native of Heav'n, for other place <BR>
None can then Heav'n such glorious shape contain; <BR>
Since by descending from the Thrones above, <BR>
Those happie places thou hast deignd a while <BR>
To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us <BR>
Two onely, who yet by sov'ran gift possess <BR>
This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre <BR>
To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears <BR>
To sit and taste, till this meridian heat <BR>
Be over, and the Sun more coole decline. <BR>
<BR>
  Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde. <BR>
ADAM, I therefore came, nor art thou such <BR>
Created, or such place hast here to dwell, <BR>
As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n <BR>
To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre <BR>
Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise <BR>
I have at will.  So to the Silvan Lodge <BR>
They came, that like POMONA'S Arbour smil'd <BR>
With flourets deck't and fragrant smells; but EVE <BR>
Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair <BR>
Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd <BR>
Of three that in Mount IDA naked strove, <BR>
Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no vaile <BR>
Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme <BR>
Alterd her cheek.  On whom the Angel HAILE <BR>
Bestowd, the holy salutation us'd <BR>
Long after to blest MARIE, second EVE. <BR>
<BR>
  Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb <BR>
Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons <BR>
Then with these various fruits the Trees of God <BR>
Have heap'd this Table.  Rais'd of grassie terf <BR>
Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round, <BR>
And on her ample Square from side to side <BR>
All AUTUMN pil'd, though SPRING and AUTUMN here <BR>
Danc'd hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold; <BR>
No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began <BR>
Our Authour.  Heav'nly stranger, please to taste <BR>
These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom <BR>
All perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends, <BR>
To us for food and for delight hath caus'd <BR>
The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps <BR>
To spiritual Natures; only this I know, <BR>
That one Celestial Father gives to all. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives <BR>
(Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part <BR>
Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found <BR>
No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure <BR>
Intelligential substances require <BR>
As doth your Rational; and both contain <BR>
Within them every lower facultie <BR>
Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, <BR>
Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, <BR>
And corporeal to incorporeal turn. <BR>
For know, whatever was created, needs <BR>
To be sustaind and fed; of Elements <BR>
The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea, <BR>
Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires <BR>
Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon; <BR>
Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'd <BR>
Vapours not yet into her substance turnd. <BR>
Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale <BR>
From her moist Continent to higher Orbes. <BR>
The Sun that light imparts to all, receives <BR>
From all his alimental recompence <BR>
In humid exhalations, and at Even <BR>
Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the Trees <BR>
Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines <BR>
Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn <BR>
We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground <BR>
Cover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath here <BR>
Varied his bounty so with new delights, <BR>
As may compare with Heaven; and to taste <BR>
Think not I shall be nice.  So down they sat, <BR>
And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly <BR>
The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss <BR>
Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch <BR>
Of real hunger, and concoctive heate <BR>
To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires <BR>
Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire <BR>
Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist <BR>
Can turn, or holds it possible to turn <BR>
Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold <BR>
As from the Mine.  Mean while at Table EVE <BR>
Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups <BR>
With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence <BR>
Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, <BR>
Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin <BR>
Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts <BR>
Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousie <BR>
Was understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus when with meats &amp; drinks they had suffic'd, <BR>
Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose <BR>
In ADAM, not to let th' occasion pass <BR>
Given him by this great Conference to know <BR>
Of things above his World, and of thir being <BR>
Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw <BR>
Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms <BR>
Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far <BR>
Exceeded human, and his wary speech <BR>
Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Inhabitant with God, now know I well <BR>
Thy favour, in this honour done to man, <BR>
Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't <BR>
To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, <BR>
Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, <BR>
As that more willingly thou couldst not seem <BR>
At Heav'ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare? <BR>
<BR>
   To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd. <BR>
O ADAM, one Almightie is, from whom <BR>
All things proceed, and up to him return, <BR>
If not deprav'd from good, created all <BR>
Such to perfection, one first matter all, <BR>
Indu'd with various forms, various degrees <BR>
Of substance, and in things that live, of life; <BR>
But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure, <BR>
As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending <BR>
Each in thir several active Sphears assignd, <BR>
Till body up to spirit work, in bounds <BR>
Proportiond to each kind.  So from the root <BR>
Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves <BR>
More aerie, last the bright consummate floure <BR>
Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit <BR>
Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd <BR>
To vital Spirits aspire, to animal, <BR>
To intellectual, give both life and sense, <BR>
Fansie and understanding, whence the soule <BR>
Reason receives, and reason is her being, <BR>
Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse <BR>
Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, <BR>
Differing but in degree, of kind the same. <BR>
Wonder not then, what God for you saw good <BR>
If I refuse not, but convert, as you, <BR>
To proper substance; time may come when men <BR>
With Angels may participate, and find <BR>
No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare: <BR>
And from these corporal nutriments perhaps <BR>
Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit <BR>
Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend <BR>
Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice <BR>
Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell; <BR>
If ye be found obedient, and retain <BR>
Unalterably firm his love entire <BR>
Whose progenie you are.  Mean while enjoy <BR>
Your fill what happiness this happie state <BR>
Can comprehend, incapable of more. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd. <BR>
O favourable spirit, propitious guest, <BR>
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct <BR>
Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set <BR>
From center to circumference, whereon <BR>
In contemplation of created things <BR>
By steps we may ascend to God.  But say, <BR>
What meant that caution joind, IF YE BE FOUND <BR>
OBEDIENT? can wee want obedience then <BR>
To him, or possibly his love desert <BR>
Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here <BR>
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss <BR>
Human desires can seek or apprehend? <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Angel.  Son of Heav'n and Earth, <BR>
Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God; <BR>
That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self, <BR>
That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. <BR>
This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd. <BR>
God made thee perfet, not immutable; <BR>
And good he made thee, but to persevere <BR>
He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will <BR>
By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate <BR>
Inextricable, or strict necessity; <BR>
Our voluntarie service he requires, <BR>
Not our necessitated, such with him <BR>
Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how <BR>
Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve <BR>
Willing or no, who will but what they must <BR>
By Destinie, and can no other choose? <BR>
My self and all th' Angelic Host that stand <BR>
In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state <BR>
Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; <BR>
On other surety none; freely we serve. <BR>
Because wee freely love, as in our will <BR>
To love or not; in this we stand or fall: <BR>
And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n, <BR>
And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall <BR>
From what high state of bliss into what woe! <BR>
<BR>
  To whom our great Progenitor.  Thy words <BR>
Attentive, and with more delighted eare <BR>
Divine instructer, I have heard, then when <BR>
Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills <BR>
Aereal Music send: nor knew I not <BR>
To be both will and deed created free; <BR>
Yet that we never shall forget to love <BR>
Our maker, and obey him whose command <BR>
Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts <BR>
Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst <BR>
Hath past in Heav'n, som doubt within me move, <BR>
But more desire to hear, if thou consent, <BR>
The full relation, which must needs be strange, <BR>
Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard; <BR>
And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun <BR>
Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins <BR>
His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus ADAM made request, and RAPHAEL <BR>
After short pause assenting, thus began. <BR>
<BR>
  High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men, <BR>
Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate <BR>
To human sense th' invisible exploits <BR>
Of warring Spirits; how without remorse <BR>
The ruin of so many glorious once <BR>
And perfet while they stood; how last unfould <BR>
The secrets of another world, perhaps <BR>
Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good <BR>
This is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reach <BR>
Of human sense, I shall delineate so, <BR>
By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, <BR>
As may express them best, though what if Earth <BR>
Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein <BR>
Each to other like, more then on earth is thought? <BR>
<BR>
  As yet this world was not, and CHAOS wilde <BR>
Reignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests <BR>
Upon her Center pois'd, when on a day <BR>
(For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'd <BR>
To motion, measures all things durable <BR>
By present, past, and future) on such day <BR>
As Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal Host <BR>
Of Angels by Imperial summons call'd, <BR>
Innumerable before th' Almighties Throne <BR>
Forthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerd <BR>
Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright <BR>
Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd, <BR>
Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare <BR>
Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve <BR>
Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees; <BR>
Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'd <BR>
Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love <BR>
Recorded eminent.  Thus when in Orbes <BR>
Of circuit inexpressible they stood, <BR>
Orb within Orb, the Father infinite, <BR>
By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son, <BR>
Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whoseop <BR>
Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. <BR>
<BR>
  Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light, <BR>
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, <BR>
Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand. <BR>
This day I have begot whom I declare <BR>
My onely Son, and on this holy Hill <BR>
Him have anointed, whom ye now behold <BR>
At my right hand; your Head I him appoint; <BR>
And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow <BR>
All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord: <BR>
Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide <BR>
United as one individual Soule <BR>
For ever happie: him who disobeyes <BR>
Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day <BR>
Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls <BR>
Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place <BR>
Ordaind without redemption, without end. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words <BR>
All seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all. <BR>
That day, as other solem dayes, they spent <BR>
In song and dance about the sacred Hill, <BR>
Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare <BR>
Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles <BR>
Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, <BR>
Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular <BR>
Then most, when most irregular they seem: <BR>
And in thir motions harmonie Divine <BR>
So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear <BR>
Listens delighted.  Eevning approachd <BR>
(For we have also our Eevning and our Morn, <BR>
We ours for change delectable, not need) <BR>
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn <BR>
Desirous, all in Circles as they stood, <BR>
Tables are set, and on a sudden pil'd <BR>
With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows: <BR>
In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold, <BR>
Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav'n. <BR>
They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet <BR>
Are fill'd, before th' all bounteous King, who showrd <BR>
With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy. <BR>
Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal'd <BR>
From that high mount of God, whence light &amp; shade <BR>
Spring both, the face of brightest Heav'n had changd <BR>
To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there <BR>
In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos'd <BR>
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest, <BR>
Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr <BR>
Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred, <BR>
(Such are the Courts of God) Th' Angelic throng <BR>
Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend <BR>
By living Streams among the Trees of Life, <BR>
Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard, <BR>
Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept <BR>
Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course <BR>
Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne <BR>
Alternate all night long: but not so wak'd <BR>
SATAN, so call him now, his former name <BR>
Is heard no more Heav'n; he of the first, <BR>
If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power, <BR>
In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught <BR>
With envie against the Son of God, that day <BR>
Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd <BR>
MESSIAH King anointed, could not beare <BR>
Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird. <BR>
Deep malice thence conceiving &amp; disdain, <BR>
Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre <BR>
Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd <BR>
With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave <BR>
Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supream <BR>
Contemptuous, and his next subordinate <BR>
Awak'ning, thus to him in secret spake. <BR>
<BR>
  Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close <BR>
Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree <BR>
Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips <BR>
Of Heav'ns Almightie.  Thou to me thy thoughts <BR>
Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart; <BR>
Both waking we were one; how then can now <BR>
Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos'd; <BR>
New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise <BR>
In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate <BR>
What doubtful may ensue, more in this place <BR>
To utter is not safe.  Assemble thou <BR>
Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief; <BR>
Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night <BR>
Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste, <BR>
And all who under me thir Banners wave, <BR>
Homeward with flying march where we possess <BR>
The Quarters of the North, there to prepare <BR>
Fit entertainment to receive our King <BR>
The great MESSIAH, and his new commands, <BR>
Who speedily through all the Hierarchies <BR>
Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd <BR>
Bad influence into th' unwarie brest <BR>
Of his Associate; hee together calls, <BR>
Or several one by one, the Regent Powers, <BR>
Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught, <BR>
That the most High commanding, now ere Night, <BR>
Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n, <BR>
The great Hierarchal Standard was to move; <BR>
Tells the suggested cause, and casts between <BR>
Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound <BR>
Or taint integritie; but all obey'd <BR>
The wonted signal, and superior voice <BR>
Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed <BR>
His name, and high was his degree in Heav'n; <BR>
His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guides <BR>
The starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyes <BR>
Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host: <BR>
Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernes <BR>
Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount <BR>
And from within the golden Lamps that burne <BR>
Nightly before him, saw without thir light <BR>
Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred <BR>
Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes <BR>
Were banded to oppose his high Decree; <BR>
And smiling to his onely Son thus said. <BR>
<BR>
  Son, thou in whom my glory I behold <BR>
In full resplendence, Heir of all my might, <BR>
Neerly it now concernes us to be sure <BR>
Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms <BR>
We mean to hold what anciently we claim <BR>
Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe <BR>
Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne <BR>
Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North; <BR>
Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie <BR>
In battel, what our Power is, or our right. <BR>
Let us advise, and to this hazard draw <BR>
With speed what force is left, and all imploy <BR>
In our defence, lest unawares we lose <BR>
This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer <BR>
Light'ning Divine, ineffable, serene, <BR>
Made answer.  Mightie Father, thou thy foes <BR>
Justly hast in derision, and secure <BR>
Laugh'st at thir vain designes and tumults vain, <BR>
Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate <BR>
Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power <BR>
Giv'n me to quell thir pride, and in event <BR>
Know whether I be dextrous to subdue <BR>
Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav'n. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Son, but SATAN with his Powers <BR>
Farr was advanc't on winged speed, an Host <BR>
Innumerable as the Starrs of Night, <BR>
Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun <BR>
Impearls on every leaf and every flouer. <BR>
Regions they pass'd, the mightie Regencies <BR>
Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones <BR>
In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which <BR>
All thy Dominion, ADAM, is no more <BR>
Then what this Garden is to all the Earth, <BR>
And all the Sea, from one entire globose <BR>
Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass'd <BR>
At length into the limits of the North <BR>
They came, and SATAN to his Royal seat <BR>
High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount <BR>
Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs <BR>
From Diamond Quarries hew'n, &amp; Rocks of Gold, <BR>
The Palace of great LUCIFER, (so call <BR>
That Structure in the Dialect of men <BR>
Interpreted) which not long after, hee <BR>
Affecting all equality with God, <BR>
In imitation of that Mount whereon <BR>
MESSIAH was declar'd in sight of Heav'n, <BR>
The Mountain of the Congregation call'd; <BR>
For thither he assembl'd all his Train, <BR>
Pretending so commanded to consult <BR>
About the great reception of thir King, <BR>
Thither to come, and with calumnious Art <BR>
Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears. <BR>
<BR>
  Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers, <BR>
If these magnific Titles yet remain <BR>
Not meerly titular, since by Decree <BR>
Another now hath to himself ingross't <BR>
All Power, and us eclipst under the name <BR>
Of King anointed, for whom all this haste <BR>
Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here, <BR>
This onely to consult how we may best <BR>
With what may be devis'd of honours new <BR>
Receive him coming to receive from us <BR>
Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile, <BR>
Too much to one, but double how endur'd, <BR>
To one and to his image now proclaim'd? <BR>
But what if better counsels might erect <BR>
Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke? <BR>
Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend <BR>
The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust <BR>
To know ye right, or if ye know your selves <BR>
Natives and Sons of Heav'n possest before <BR>
By none, and if not equal all, yet free, <BR>
Equally free; for Orders and Degrees <BR>
Jarr not with liberty, but well consist. <BR>
Who can in reason then or right assume <BR>
Monarchie over such as live by right <BR>
His equals, if in power and splendor less, <BR>
In freedome equal? or can introduce <BR>
Law and Edict on us, who without law <BR>
Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord, <BR>
And look for adoration to th' abuse <BR>
Of those Imperial Titles which assert <BR>
Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve? <BR>
<BR>
  Thus farr his bold discourse without controule <BR>
Had audience, when among the Seraphim <BR>
ABDIEL, then whom none with more zeale ador'd <BR>
The Deitie, and divine commands obei'd, <BR>
Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe <BR>
The current of his fury thus oppos'd. <BR>
<BR>
  O argument blasphemous, false and proud! <BR>
Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'n <BR>
Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate <BR>
In place thy self so high above thy Peeres. <BR>
Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne <BR>
The just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn, <BR>
That to his only Son by right endu'd <BR>
With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'n <BR>
Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due <BR>
Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist <BR>
Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free, <BR>
And equal over equals to let Reigne, <BR>
One over all with unsucceeded power. <BR>
Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute <BR>
With him the points of libertie, who made <BR>
Thee what thou art, &amp; formd the Pow'rs of Heav'n <BR>
Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being? <BR>
Yet by experience taught we know how good, <BR>
And of our good, and of our dignitie <BR>
How provident he is, how farr from thought <BR>
To make us less, bent rather to exalt <BR>
Our happie state under one Head more neer <BR>
United.  But to grant it thee unjust, <BR>
That equal over equals Monarch Reigne: <BR>
Thy self though great &amp; glorious dost thou count, <BR>
Or all Angelic Nature joind in one, <BR>
Equal to him begotten Son, by whom <BR>
As by his Word the mighty Father made <BR>
All things, ev'n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav'n <BR>
By him created in thir bright degrees, <BR>
Crownd them with Glory, &amp; to thir Glory nam'd <BR>
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers <BR>
Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur'd, <BR>
But more illustrious made, since he the Head <BR>
One of our number thus reduc't becomes, <BR>
His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done <BR>
Returns our own.  Cease then this impious rage, <BR>
And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease <BR>
Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son, <BR>
While Pardon may be found in time besought. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale <BR>
None seconded, as out of season judg'd, <BR>
Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd <BR>
Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd. <BR>
That we were formd then saist thou? &amp; the work <BR>
Of secondarie hands, by task transferd <BR>
From Father to his Son? strange point and new! <BR>
Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw <BR>
When this creation was? rememberst thou <BR>
Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being? <BR>
We know no time when we were not as now; <BR>
Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais'd <BR>
By our own quick'ning power, when fatal course <BR>
Had circl'd his full Orbe, the birth mature <BR>
Of this our native Heav'n, Ethereal Sons. <BR>
Our puissance is our own, our own right hand <BR>
Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try <BR>
Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold <BR>
Whether by supplication we intend <BR>
Address, and to begirt th' Almighty Throne <BR>
Beseeching or besieging.  This report, <BR>
These tidings carrie to th' anointed King; <BR>
And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. <BR>
<BR>
  He said, and as the sound of waters deep <BR>
Hoarce murmur echo'd to his words applause <BR>
Through the infinite Host, nor less for that <BR>
The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone <BR>
Encompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold. <BR>
<BR>
  O alienate from God, O spirit accurst, <BR>
Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fall <BR>
Determind, and thy hapless crew involv'd <BR>
In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred <BR>
Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth <BR>
No more be troubl'd how to quit the yoke <BR>
Of Gods MESSIAH; those indulgent Laws <BR>
Will not be now voutsaf't, other Decrees <BR>
Against thee are gon forth without recall; <BR>
That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject <BR>
Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake <BR>
Thy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise, <BR>
Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly <BR>
These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth <BR>
Impendent, raging into sudden flame <BR>
Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel <BR>
His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire. <BR>
Then who created thee lamenting learne, <BR>
When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the Seraph ABDIEL faithful found, <BR>
Among the faithless, faithful only hee; <BR>
Among innumerable false, unmov'd, <BR>
Unshak'n, unseduc'd, unterrifi'd <BR>
His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale; <BR>
Nor number, nor example with him wrought <BR>
To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind <BR>
Though single.  From amidst them forth he passd, <BR>
Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind <BR>
Superior, nor of violence fear'd aught; <BR>
And with retorted scorn his back he turn'd <BR>
On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom'd. <BR>
