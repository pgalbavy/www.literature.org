<p>When Mickey found himself under the shelter of the trees, something
like his old confidence returned.</p>

<p>"As I obsarved some minutes ago, it's mesilf that's not going
to stand any fooling," he added, loud enough for the redskins
to hear. "Whither ye're there or not, ye ought to spake, and come
out and smoke the calomel of peace, and give a spalpeen a chance
to crack your head, as though ye're his brother; but if ye're
up to any of your thricks, make ready to go to your hunting-grounds."</p>

<p>By this time he was within a dozen feet of the spot whence came
the rustling that so disturbed him, and was staring with all his
eyes in quest of the redskins. In spite of the bright moonlight,
the Irishman could not be certain of anything he saw. There were
trees of large size, behind any of which an Indian might have
shielded himself effectually, and it was useless for Mickey to
look unless his man chose to show himself.</p>

<p>The Irishman had all the natural recklessness of his race, but
he had been in the Apache country long enough to learn to tone
it down, for that was the country where the most fatal attribute
a man could have was recklessness or rashness. In many instances
of conflict with Indians it is worse than cowardice.</p>

<p>But, in the face of Mickey's assurance to the contrary, he did
not feel altogether easy about the Apaches he had left at the
cave. His humanity had prevented him from depriving them of means
of escape, and although he was inclined to believe that they were
not likely to climb the lasso until many hours should elapse,
there could be no certainty about it. They might do so within
an hour after the departure of the man and boy.</p>

<p>It was this reflection that caused Mickey to act with something
of his natural rashness. He felt that he could not afford to wait
to fight the thing out on scientific principles, so he determined,
since he was so close, to force it to an issue without delay.
Accordingly, he prepared himself to charge.</p>

<p>"I've been too kind already in giving ye warnings," he added,
gathering himself for the effort, "and if your indifference causes
your ruin, it's your own fault, as the bull remarked when he come
down on a butt agin the engine."</p>

<p>Compressing his lips, Mickey made his start, forcing out a few
words, as he would shoot bullets on the way.</p>

<p>"Nobody but a spalpeen of a coward would keep out of sight when
he saw a head coming down on him in such tempting style as mine.
I can't understand how he could."</p>

<p>In his furious hunt for antagonists, the belligerent fellow did
not think of looking upon the ground. He made the blunder of Captain
John Smith, of the Jamestown Colony, who, in retreating from Powhatan's
warriors, became mired, with the eventual result of making Pocahontas
famous, and securing an infinite number of namesakes of the captain
himself.</p>

<p>Mickey O'Rooney had scarcely begun his charge when his feet came
into violent collision with a body upon the ground, and he turned
a complete somersault over it.</p>

<p>"Be the powers! but that's a dirty thrick!" he exclaimed, gathering
himself up as hurriedly as possible, and recovering very speedily
from his natural bewilderment. "A man who drops in the ring without
a blow is always ruled out, and be that token ye're not entitled
to the respect of illegant gintlemen."</p>

<p>During the utterance of these words the Irishman had carefully
returned, boiling over with indignation and fight, and at this
juncture he discovered the obstruction which had brought him to
grief.</p>

<p>So far as appearances went, there was no Indian nearer than the
cave. It was his own horse that had made the noise which first
alarmed him. While the equine was stretched upon the ground, peacefully
sleeping, his bumptious owner, in charging over his body, had
stumbled and fallen.</p>

<p>Mickey was thrown "all in a heap" for a minute or two, when he
found how the case stood, and then he laughed to himself as he
fully appreciated the situation.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well, I feel as chape as Jerry McConnell when he
hugged and kissed a gal for two hours, one evening, and found
it was his wife, and she felt chaaper yet, for she thought all
the time that it was Mickey O'Shaughnessy. I suppose me old swateheart,"
he added, as he stooped down and patted the head of his horse,
"that ye've been living so high here for two or three days that
ye're too fat to be good for anything. Come, up wid ye, ye old
spalpeen!"</p>

<p>The mustang recognized the voice of his master, and obeyed as
promptly as a child, coming upon his feet with the nimbleness
of a racer, and ready to do what he was bidden. Mickey led him
out into the moonlight, when he left him standing, while he went
a short distance for the saddle and bridle, which he had concealed
at the time of leaving the spot. They were found just as he had
left them, and he returned in high feather, secured them in a
twinkling upon his animal and galloped back to where the lad was
waiting.</p>

<p>"Ye haven't seen or heard anything of redskins, have ye, while
I was procuring my cratur?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," replied the lad; "but I heard you talking pretty
loud, so I suppose you must have found several."</p>

<p>"No," answered Mickey, who did not care about explaining the
whole affair. "I'm always in the habit of exchanging a few words
wid the cratur when I maats, and such was the case a short time
since, when I met him, after being away so long."</p>

<p>"Well, Mickey, we haven't any time to spare."</p>

<p>"Ye're right, my laddy; all you've got to do is to folly me."</p>

<p>With this he headed his mustang at precisely right angles to
the course they followed in making their way to the spot; and
Fred, who expected all sorts of trouble in the way of traveling,
noticed that he was following some sort of path or trail, along
which his horse trod as easily as upon the open prairie. While
this was an advantage in one respect it had its disadvantage in
another. The presence of a trail in that part of the world implied
that it was one made and traveled by Indians, who were likely
to be encountered at any moment, and Mickey was not insensible
to the peril. But, in the present instance, there seemed to be
no other means of getting along, and thus, in one sense, they
were forced into it. The probabilities, however, were that they
would soon emerge into safer territory, where it would be possible
to take some precautions against pursuers.</p>

<p>For some time the two galloped along without speaking. The hoofs
of their mustangs rang upon the rocks, and rattled over the gravel,
and, in the still night, could have been heard a long distance
away. While the Irishman kept as good a lookout ahead as possible,
Fred Munson did his best to guard their rear. He kept continually
glancing over his shoulder in the expectation of seeing some of
their enemies, but nothing of the kind occurred, and before he
anticipated it, they emerged into what seemed a deep valley, with
high rocks upon both sides. Mickey drew up, and allowed his young
friend to move alongside.</p>

<p>"Do ye mind ever having seen this place before?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't remember anything about this country, and all I ask
is that we may get out of it as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"But don't ye mind ever having been here before?"</p>

<p>Thus questioned, Fred scanned his surroundings as best he could,
but there was nothing that he could identify, and he so said,
adding:</p>

<p>"I'm sure I've never been here before."</p>

<p>"And I'm sure ye have. This is the path that Lone Wolf come along,
and that ye was hunting for when ye got lost, and fell into the
basement story of the mountain."</p>

<p>"Oh, this is the pass, is it?" exclaimed the delighted lad; "then
we have a clear road before us straight to New Boston."</p>

<p>"Clear of all but one thing."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"The red spalpeens; they're always turning up when you don't
expect 'em, and don't want 'em."</p>

<p>"How far are we away from the cave, where we left the half dozen
Apaches?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it's much more than a mile, though it may be a
mile and a half."</p>

<p>"Well, that's very good; we've got that much start, and it's
worth having."</p>

<p>"And there's where ye're mistook, as the gals used to obsarve
when anybody tried to run down my beauty. The path that we come
along, ye'll mind, makes many turns and twists, and the ind of
it all is that it strikes the pass on the other side of the cave,
and we've got to ride right by the spot which we lift."</p>

<p>This was not cheering information, although, everything considered,
the two had cause to congratulate themselves upon their extraordinary
success up to this time.</p>

<p>The night was about gone, and, while their mustangs halted, they
observed that it was growing light in the east. They would be
forced to ride through the dangerous territory by day, so that
the risk of detection would be proportionately greater if their
enemies should be in the vicinity. Both the mustangs were fresh
and vigorous, however, having enjoyed an unusually long rest,
with plenty of food, and they were good for many hours of speed
and endurance. The one ridden by Fred had behaved in a very seemly
fashion, and there was ground for the hope that he would keep
up the line of conduct to the end. Still there could be no certainty
of what he would do in the presence of the Apaches.</p>

<p>"We'll take it aisy," said Mickey, as the two started off at
an easy gallop. "We'll not be afther putting 'em to a run till
we have to do the same, so that when there's naad for their spaad,
we shall have it at command." This prudent suggestion was carried
out. Their horses dropped into a sweeping gallop that was as easy
as an ordinary walk. The riders kept their senses awake, talking
only a little, and then in guarded voices.</p>

<p>As they galloped along the sun rose, and the day promised to
be as warm and pleasant as those which had preceded it. The sky
was obscured only by a few fleecy clouds, while the deep blue
beyond was as beautiful as that of Italy. Drawing near the cave
in the mountain, they pulled their horses down to a walk and carefully
guided them into the softest places, so as to make the noise of
their hoofs as slight as possible. Nothing occurred until they
were a short distance beyond the dangerous spot, when Mickey spoke.</p>

<p>"Do you obsarve that stream there?" he asked, pointing to a rather
deep brook which ran across the pass, and lost itself in the rocks
upon the opposite side. "Well, that's the water that comes through
the cave over the cascade, and that I expicted to swim out by,
and I'm going to find out what me chances were."</p>
