<p>But other passengers were approaching Lincoln meanwhile by other
roads on foot. A county town draws the inhabitants of all vicarages,
farms, country houses, and wayside cottages, within a radius of
ten miles at least, once or twice a week to its streets; and among
them, on this occasion, were Ralph Denham and Mary Datchet. They
despised the roads, and took their way across the fields; and
yet, from their appearance, it did not seem as if they cared much
where they walked so long as the way did not actually trip them
up. When they left the Vicarage, they had begun an argument which
swung their feet along so rhythmically in time with it that they
covered the ground at over four miles an hour, and saw nothing
of the hedgerows, the swelling plowland, or the mild blue sky.
What they saw were the Houses of Parliament and the Government
Offices in Whitehall. They both belonged to the class which is
conscious of having lost its birthright in these great structures
and is seeking to build another kind of lodging for its own notion
of law and government. Purposely, perhaps, Mary did not agree
with Ralph; she loved to feel her mind in conflict with his, and
to be certain that he spared her female judgment no ounce of his
male muscularity. He seemed to argue as fiercely with her as if
she were his brother. They were alike, however, in believing that
it behooved them to take in hand the repair and reconstruction
of the fabric of England. They agreed in thinking that nature
has not been generous in the endowment of our councilors. They
agreed, unconsciously, in a mute love for the muddy field through
which they tramped, with eyes narrowed close by the concentration
of their minds. At length they drew breath, let the argument fly
away into the limbo of other good arguments, and, leaning over
a gate, opened their eyes for the first time and looked about
them. Their feet tingled with warm blood and their breath rose
in steam around them. The bodily exercise made them both feel
more direct and less self-conscious than usual, and Mary, indeed,
was overcome by a sort of light-headedness which made it seem
to her that it mattered very little what happened next. It mattered
so little, indeed, that she felt herself on the point of saying
to Ralph:</p>

<p>"I love you; I shall never love anybody else. Marry me or leave
me; think what you like of me &mdash;I don’t care a straw." At
the moment, however, speech or silence seemed immaterial, and
she merely clapped her hands together, and looked at the distant
woods with the rust-like bloom on their brown, and the green and
blue landscape through the steam of her own breath. It seemed
a mere toss-up whether she said, "I love you,"  or whether she
said, "I love the beech-trees," or only "I love  &mdash;I love."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mary," Ralph suddenly interrupted her, "I’ve made
up my mind."</p>

<p>Her indifference must have been superficial, for it disappeared
at once. Indeed, she lost sight of the trees, and saw her own
hand upon the topmost bar of the gate with extreme distinctness,
while he went on:</p>

<p>"I’ve made up my mind to chuck my work and live down here. I
want you to tell me about that cottage you spoke of. However,
I suppose there’ll be no difficulty about getting a cottage, will
there?" He spoke with an assumption of carelessness as if expecting
her to dissuade him.</p>

<p>She still waited, as if for him to continue; she was convinced
that in some roundabout way he approached the subject of their
marriage.</p>

<p>"I can’t stand the office any longer," he proceeded. "I don’t
know what my family will say; but I’m sure I’m right. Don’t you
think so?"</p>

<p>"Live down here by yourself?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Some old woman would do for me, I suppose," he replied. "I’m
sick of the whole thing," he went on, and opened the gate with
a jerk. They began to cross the next field walking side by side.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Mary, it’s utter destruction, working away, day
after day, at stuff that doesn’t matter a damn to any one. I’ve
stood eight years of it, and I’m not going to stand it any longer.
I suppose this all seems to you mad, though?"</p>

<p>By this time Mary had recovered her self-control.</p>

<p>"No. I thought you weren’t happy," she said.</p>

<p>"Why did you think that?" he asked, with some surprise.</p>

<p>"Don’t you remember that morning in Lincoln’s Inn Fields?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ralph, slackening his pace and remembering Katharine
and her engagement, the purple leaves stamped into the path, the
white paper radiant under the electric light, and the hopelessness
which seemed to surround all these things.</p>

<p>"You’re right, Mary," he said, with something of an effort, "though
I don’t know how you guessed it."</p>

<p>She was silent, hoping that he might tell her the reason of his
unhappiness, for his excuses had not deceived her.</p>

<p>"I was unhappy&mdash;very unhappy," he repeated. Some six weeks separated
him from that afternoon when he had sat upon the Embankment watching
his visions dissolve in mist as the waters swam past and the sense
of his desolation still made him shiver. He had not recovered
in the least from that depression. Here was an opportunity for
making himself face it, as he felt that he ought to; for, by this
time, no doubt, it was only a sentimental ghost, better exorcised
by ruthless exposure to such an eye as Mary’s, than allowed to
underlie all his actions and thoughts as had been the case ever
since he first saw Katharine Hilbery pouring out tea. He must
begin, however, by mentioning her name, and this he found it impossible
to do. He persuaded himself that he could make an honest statement
without speaking her name; he persuaded himself that his feeling
had very little to do with her.</p>

<p>"Unhappiness is a state of mind," he said, "by which I mean that
it is not necessarily the result of any particular cause."</p>

<p>This rather stilted beginning did not please him, and it became
more and more obvious to him that, whatever he might say, his
unhappiness had been directly caused by Katharine.</p>

<p>"I began to find my life unsatisfactory," he started afresh.
"It seemed to me meaningless." He paused again, but felt that
this, at any rate, was true, and that on these lines he could
go on.</p>

<p>"All this money-making and working ten hours a day in an office,
what’s it <em>FOR? </em>When one’s a boy, you see, one’s head
is so full of dreams that it doesn’t seem to matter what one does.
And if you’re ambitious, you’re all right; you’ve got a reason
for going on. Now my reasons ceased to satisfy me. Perhaps I never
had any. That’s very likely now I come to think of it. (What reason
is there for anything, though?) Still, it’s impossible, after
a certain age, to take oneself in satisfactorily. And I know what
carried me on"&mdash;for a good reason now occurred to him&mdash;"I wanted
to be the savior of my family and all that kind of thing. I wanted
them to get on in the world. That was a lie, of course&mdash;a kind
of self-glorification, too. Like most people, I suppose, I’ve
lived almost entirely among delusions, and now I’m at the awkward
stage of finding it out. I want another delusion to go on with.
That’s what my unhappiness amounts to, Mary."</p>

<p>There were two reasons that kept Mary very silent during this
speech, and drew curiously straight lines upon her face. In the
first place, Ralph made no mention of marriage; in the second,
he was not speaking the truth.</p>

<p>"I don’t think it will be difficult to find a cottage," she said,
with cheerful hardness, ignoring the whole of this statement.
"You’ve got a little money, haven’t you? Yes," she concluded,
"I don’t see why it shouldn’t be a very good plan."</p>

<p>They crossed the field in complete silence. Ralph was surprised
by her remark and a little hurt, and yet, on the whole, rather
pleased. He had convinced himself that it was impossible to lay
his case truthfully before Mary, and, secretly, he was relieved
to find that he had not parted with his dream to her. She was,
as he had always found her, the sensible, loyal friend, the woman
he trusted; whose sympathy he could count upon, provided he kept
within certain limits. He was not displeased to find that those
limits were very clearly marked. When they had crossed the next
hedge she said to him:</p>

<p>"Yes, Ralph, it’s time you made a break. I’ve come to the same
conclusion myself. Only it won’t be a country cottage in my case;
it’ll be America. America!" she cried. "That’s the place for me!
They’ll teach me something about organizing a movement there,
and I’ll come back and show you how to do it."</p>

<p>If she meant consciously or unconsciously to belittle the seclusion
and security of a country cottage, she did not succeed; for Ralph’s
determination was genuine. But she made him visualize her in her
own character, so that he looked quickly at her, as she walked
a little in front of him across the plowed field; for the first
time that morning he saw her independently of him or of his preoccupation
with Katharine. He seemed to see her marching ahead, a rather
clumsy but powerful and independent figure, for whose courage
he felt the greatest respect.</p>

<p>"Don’t go away, Mary!" he exclaimed, and stopped.</p>

<p>"That’s what you said before, Ralph," she returned, without looking
at him. "You want to go away yourself and you don’t want me to
go away. That’s not very sensible, is it?"</p>

<p>"Mary," he cried, stung by the remembrance of his exacting and
dictatorial ways with her, "what a brute I’ve been to you!"</p>

<p>It took all her strength to keep the tears from springing, and
to thrust back her assurance that she would forgive him till Doomsday
if he chose. She was preserved from doing so only by a stubborn
kind of respect for herself which lay at the root of her nature
and forbade surrender, even in moments of almost overwhelming
passion. Now, when all was tempest and high-running waves, she
knew of a land where the sun shone clear upon Italian grammars
and files of docketed papers. Nevertheless, from the skeleton
pallor of that land and the rocks that broke its surface, she
knew that her life there would be harsh and lonely almost beyond
endurance. She walked steadily a little in front of him across
the plowed field. Their way took them round the verge of a wood
of thin trees standing at the edge of a steep fold in the land.
Looking between the tree-trunks, Ralph saw laid out on the perfectly
flat and richly green meadow at the bottom of the hill a small
gray manor-house, with ponds, terraces, and clipped hedges in
front of it, a farm building or so at the side, and a screen of
fir-trees rising behind, all perfectly sheltered and self-sufficient.
Behind the house the hill rose again, and the trees on the farther
summit stood upright against the sky, which appeared of a more
intense blue between their trunks. His mind at once was filled
with a sense of the actual presence of Katharine; the gray house
and the intense blue sky gave him the feeling of her presence
close by. He leant against a tree, forming her name beneath his
breath:</p>

<p>"Katharine, Katharine," he said aloud, and then, looking round,
saw Mary walking slowly away from him, tearing a long spray of
ivy from the trees as she passed them. She seemed so definitely
opposed to the vision he held in his mind that he returned to
it with a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"Katharine, Katharine," he repeated, and seemed to himself to
be with her. He lost his sense of all that surrounded him; all
substantial things&mdash;the hour of the day, what we have done and
are about to do, the presence of other people and the support
we derive from seeing their belief in a common reality&mdash;all this
slipped from him. So he might have felt if the earth had dropped
from his feet, and the empty blue had hung all round him, and
the air had been steeped in the presence of one woman. The chirp
of a robin on the bough above his head awakened him, and his awakenment
was accompanied by a sigh. Here was the world in which he had
lived; here the plowed field, the high road yonder, and Mary,
stripping ivy from the trees. When he came up with her he linked
his arm through hers and said:</p>

<p>"Now, Mary, what’s all this about America?"</p>

<p>There was a brotherly kindness in his voice which seemed to her
magnanimous, when she reflected that she had cut short his explanations
and shown little interest in his change of plan. She gave him
her reasons for thinking that she might profit by such a journey,
omitting the one reason which had set all the rest in motion.
He listened attentively, and made no attempt to dissuade her.
In truth, he found himself curiously eager to make certain of
her good sense, and accepted each fresh proof of it with satisfaction,
as though it helped him to make up his mind about something. She
forgot the pain he had caused her, and in place of it she became
conscious of a steady tide of well-being which harmonized very
aptly with the tramp of their feet upon the dry road and the support
of his arm. The comfort was the more glowing in that it seemed
to be the reward of her determination to behave to him simply
and without attempting to be other than she was. Instead of making
out an interest in the poets, she avoided them instinctively,
and dwelt rather insistently upon the practical nature of her
gifts.</p>

<p>In a practical way she asked for particulars of his cottage,
which hardly existed in his mind, and corrected his vagueness.</p>

<p>"You must see that there’s water," she insisted, with an exaggeration
of interest. She avoided asking him what he meant to do in this
cottage, and, at last, when all the practical details had been
thrashed out as much as possible, he rewarded her by a more intimate
statement.</p>

<p>"One of the rooms," he said, "must be my study, for, you see,
Mary, I’m going to write a book." Here he withdrew his arm from
hers, lit his pipe, and they tramped on in a sagacious kind of
comradeship, the most complete they had attained in all their
friendship.</p>

<p>"And what’s your book to be about?" she said, as boldly as if
she had never come to grief with Ralph in talking about books.
He told her unhesitatingly that he meant to write the history
of the English village from Saxon days to the present time. Some
such plan had lain as a seed in his mind for many years; and now
that he had decided, in a flash, to give up his profession, the
seed grew in the space of twenty minutes both tall and lusty.
He was surprised himself at the positive way in which he spoke.
It was the same with the question of his cottage. That had come
into existence, too, in an unromantic shape&mdash;a square white house
standing just off the high road, no doubt, with a neighbor who
kept a pig and a dozen squalling children; for these plans were
shorn of all romance in his mind, and the pleasure he derived
from thinking of them was checked directly it passed a very sober
limit. So a sensible man who has lost his chance of some beautiful
inheritance might tread out the narrow bounds of his actual dwelling-place,
and assure himself that life is supportable within its demesne,
only one must grow turnips and cabbages, not melons and pomegranates.
Certainly Ralph took some pride in the resources of his mind,
and was insensibly helped to right himself by Mary’s trust in
him. She wound her ivy spray round her ash-plant, and for the
first time for many days, when alone with Ralph, set no spies
upon her motives, sayings, and feelings, but surrendered herself
to complete happiness.</p>

<p>Thus talking, with easy silences and some pauses to look at the
view over the hedge and to decide upon the species of a little
gray-brown bird slipping among the twigs, they walked into Lincoln,
and after strolling up and down the main street, decided upon
an inn where the rounded window suggested substantial fare, nor
were they mistaken. For over a hundred and fifty years hot joints,
potatoes, greens, and apple puddings had been served to generations
of country gentlemen, and now, sitting at a table in the hollow
of the bow window, Ralph and Mary took their share of this perennial
feast. Looking across the joint, half-way through the meal, Mary
wondered whether Ralph would ever come to look quite like the
other people in the room. Would he be absorbed among the round
pink faces, pricked with little white bristles, the calves fitted
in shiny brown leather, the black-and-white check suits, which
were sprinkled about in the same room with them? She half hoped
so; she thought that it was only in his mind that he was different.
She did not wish him to be too different from other people. The
walk had given him a ruddy color, too, and his eyes were lit up
by a steady, honest light, which could not make the simplest farmer
feel ill at ease, or suggest to the most devout of clergymen a
disposition to sneer at his faith. She loved the steep cliff of
his forehead, and compared it to the brow of a young Greek horseman,
who reins his horse back so sharply that it half falls on its
haunches. He always seemed to her like a rider on a spirited horse.
And there was an exaltation to her in being with him, because
there was a risk that he would not be able to keep to the right
pace among other people. Sitting opposite him at the little table
in the window, she came back to that state of careless exaltation
which had overcome her when they halted by the gate, but now it
was accompanied by a sense of sanity and security, for she felt
that they had a feeling in common which scarcely needed embodiment
in words. How silent he was! leaning his forehead on his hand,
now and then, and again looking steadily and gravely at the backs
of the two men at the next table, with so little self-consciousness
that she could almost watch his mind placing one thought solidly
upon the top of another; she thought that she could feel him thinking,
through the shade of her fingers, and she could anticipate the
exact moment when he would put an end to his thought and turn
a little in his chair and say:</p>

<p>"Well, Mary&mdash;?" inviting her to take up the thread of thought
where he had dropped it.</p>

<p>And at that very moment he turned just so, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, Mary?" with the curious touch of diffidence which she
loved in him.</p>

<p>She laughed, and she explained her laugh on the spur of the moment
by the look of the people in the street below. There was a motor-car
with an old lady swathed in blue veils, and a lady’s maid on the
seat opposite, holding a King Charles’s spaniel; there was a country-woman
wheeling a perambulator full of sticks down the middle of the
road; there was a bailiff in gaiters discussing the state of the
cattle market with a dissenting minister&mdash;so she defined them.</p>

<p>She ran over this list without any fear that her companion would
think her trivial. Indeed, whether it was due to the warmth of
the room or to the good roast beef, or whether Ralph had achieved
the process which is called making up one’s mind, certainly he
had given up testing the good sense, the independent character,
the intelligence shown in her remarks. He had been building one
of those piles of thought, as ramshackle and fantastic as a Chinese
pagoda, half from words let fall by gentlemen in gaiters, half
from the litter in his own mind, about duck shooting and legal
history, about the Roman occupation of Lincoln and the relations
of country gentlemen with their wives, when, from all this disconnected
rambling, there suddenly formed itself in his mind the idea that
he would ask Mary to marry him. The idea was so spontaneous that
it seemed to shape itself of its own accord before his eyes. It
was then that he turned round and made use of his old, instinctive
phrase:</p>

<p>"Well, Mary&mdash;?"</p>

<p>As it presented itself to him at first, the idea was so new and
interesting that he was half inclined to address it, without more
ado, to Mary herself. His natural instinct to divide his thoughts
carefully into two different classes before he expressed them
to her prevailed. But as he watched her looking out of the window
and describing the old lady, the woman with the perambulator,
the bailiff and the dissenting minister, his eyes filled involuntarily
with tears. He would have liked to lay his head on her shoulder
and sob, while she parted his hair with her fingers and soothed
him and said:</p>

<p>"There, there. Don’t cry! Tell me why you’re crying&mdash;"; and they
would clasp each other tight, and her arms would hold him like
his mother’s. He felt that he was very lonely, and that he was
afraid of the other people in the room.</p>

<p>"How damnable this all is!" he exclaimed abruptly.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" she replied, rather vaguely, still
looking out of the window.</p>

<p>He resented this divided attention more than, perhaps, he knew,
and he thought how Mary would soon be on her way to America.</p>

<p>"Mary," he said, "I want to talk to you. Haven’t we nearly done?
Why don’t they take away these plates?"</p>

<p>Mary felt his agitation without looking at him; she felt convinced
that she knew what it was that he wished to say to her.</p>

<p>"They’ll come all in good time," she said; and felt it necessary
to display her extreme calmness by lifting a salt-cellar and sweeping
up a little heap of bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>"I want to apologize," Ralph continued, not quite knowing what
he was about to say, but feeling some curious instinct which urged
him to commit himself irrevocably, and to prevent the moment of
intimacy from passing.</p>

<p>"I think I’ve treated you very badly. That is, I’ve told you
lies. Did you guess that I was lying to you? Once in Lincoln’s
Inn Fields and again to-day on our walk. I am a liar, Mary. Did
you know that? Do you think you do know me?"</p>

<p>"I think I do," she said.</p>

<p>At this point the waiter changed their plates.</p>

<p>"It’s true I don’t want you to go to America," he said, looking
fixedly at the table-cloth. "In fact, my feelings towards you
seem to be utterly and damnably bad," he said energetically, although
forced to keep his voice low.</p>

<p>"If I weren’t a selfish beast I should tell you to have nothing
more to do with me. And yet, Mary, in spite of the fact that I
believe what I’m saying, I also believe that it’s good we should
know each other&mdash;the world being what it is, you see&mdash;" and by
a nod of his head he indicated the other occupants of the room,
"for, of course, in an ideal state of things, in a decent community
even, there’s no doubt you shouldn’t have anything to do with
me&mdash;seriously, that is."</p>

<p>"You forget that I’m not an ideal character, either," said Mary,
in the same low and very earnest tones, which, in spite of being
almost inaudible, surrounded their table with an atmosphere of
concentration which was quite perceptible to the other diners,
who glanced at them now and then with a queer mixture of kindness,
amusement, and curiosity.</p>

<p>"I’m much more selfish than I let on, and I’m worldly a little&mdash;more
than you think, anyhow. I like bossing things&mdash;perhaps that’s
my greatest fault. I’ve none of your passion for&mdash;" here she hesitated,
and glanced at him, as if to ascertain what his passion was for&mdash;"for
the truth," she added, as if she had found what she sought indisputably.</p>

<p>"I’ve told you I’m a liar," Ralph repeated obstinately.</p>

<p>"Oh, in little things, I dare say," she said impatiently. "But
not in real ones, and that’s what matters. I dare say I’m more
truthful than you are in small ways. But I could never care"&mdash;she
was surprised to find herself speaking the word, and had to force
herself to speak it out&mdash;"for any one who was a liar in that way.
I love the truth a certain amount&mdash;a considerable amount&mdash;but
not in the way you love it." Her voice sank, became inaudible,
and wavered as if she could scarcely keep herself from tears.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" Ralph exclaimed to himself. "She loves me! Why
did I never see it before? She’s going to cry; no, but she can’t
speak."</p>

<p>The certainty overwhelmed him so that he scarcely knew what he
was doing; the blood rushed to his cheeks, and although he had
quite made up his mind to ask her to marry him, the certainty
that she loved him seemed to change the situation so completely
that he could not do it. He did not dare to look at her. If she
cried, he did not know what he should do. It seemed to him that
something of a terrible and devastating nature had happened. The
waiter changed their plates once more.</p>

<p>In his agitation Ralph rose, turned his back upon Mary, and looked
out of the window. The people in the street seemed to him only
a dissolving and combining pattern of black particles; which,
for the moment, represented very well the involuntary procession
of feelings and thoughts which formed and dissolved in rapid succession
in his own mind. At one moment he exulted in the thought that
Mary loved him; at the next, it seemed that he was without feeling
for her; her love was repulsive to him. Now he felt urged to marry
her at once; now to disappear and never see her again. In order
to control this disorderly race of thought he forced himself to
read the name on the chemist’s shop directly opposite him; then
to examine the objects in the shop windows, and then to focus
his eyes exactly upon a little group of women looking in at the
great windows of a large draper’s shop. This discipline having
given him at least a superficial control of himself, he was about
to turn and ask the waiter to bring the bill, when his eye was
caught by a tall figure walking quickly along the opposite pavement&mdash;a
tall figure, upright, dark, and commanding, much detached from
her surroundings. She held her gloves in her left hand, and the
left hand was bare. All this Ralph noticed and enumerated and
recognized before he put a name to the whole &mdash;Katharine
Hilbery. She seemed to be looking for somebody. Her eyes, in fact,
scanned both sides of the street, and for one second were raised
directly to the bow window in which Ralph stood; but she looked
away again instantly without giving any sign that she had seen
him. This sudden apparition had an extraordinary effect upon him.
It was as if he had thought of her so intensely that his mind
had formed the shape of her, rather than that he had seen her
in the flesh outside in the street. And yet he had not been thinking
of her at all. The impression was so intense that he could not
dismiss it, nor even think whether he had seen her or merely imagined
her. He sat down at once, and said, briefly and strangely, rather
to himself than to Mary:</p>

<p>"That was Katharine Hilbery."</p>

<p>"Katharine Hilbery? What do you mean?" she asked, hardly understanding
from his manner whether he had seen her or not.</p>

<p>"Katharine Hilbery," he repeated. "But she’s gone now."</p>

<p>"Katharine Hilbery!" Mary thought, in an instant of blinding
revelation; "I’ve always known it was Katharine Hilbery!" She
knew it all now.</p>

<p>After a moment of downcast stupor, she raised her eyes, looked
steadily at Ralph, and caught his fixed and dreamy gaze leveled
at a point far beyond their surroundings, a point that she had
never reached in all the time that she had known him. She noticed
the lips just parted, the fingers loosely clenched, the whole
attitude of rapt contemplation, which fell like a veil between
them. She noticed everything about him; if there had been other
signs of his utter alienation she would have sought them out,
too, for she felt that it was only by heaping one truth upon another
that she could keep herself sitting there, upright. The truth
seemed to support her; it struck her, even as she looked at his
face, that the light of truth was shining far away beyond him;
the light of truth, she seemed to frame the words as she rose
to go, shines on a world not to be shaken by our personal calamities.</p>

<p>Ralph handed her her coat and her stick. She took them, fastened
the coat securely, grasped the stick firmly. The ivy spray was
still twisted about the handle; this one sacrifice, she thought,
she might make to sentimentality and personality, and she picked
two leaves from the ivy and put them in her pocket before she
disencumbered her stick of the rest of it. She grasped the stick
in the middle, and settled her fur cap closely upon her head,
as if she must be in trim for a long and stormy walk. Next, standing
in the middle of the road, she took a slip of paper from her purse,
and read out loud a list of commissions entrusted to her&mdash;fruit,
butter, string, and so on; and all the time she never spoke directly
to Ralph or looked at him.</p>

<p>Ralph heard her giving orders to attentive, rosy-checked men
in white aprons, and in spite of his own preoccupation, he commented
upon the determination with which she made her wishes known. Once
more he began, automatically, to take stock of her characteristics.
Standing thus, superficially observant and stirring the sawdust
on the floor meditatively with the toe of his boot, he was roused
by a musical and familiar voice behind him, accompanied by a light
touch upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I’m not mistaken? Surely Mr. Denham? I caught a glimpse of your
coat through the window, and I felt sure that I knew your coat.
Have you seen Katharine or William? I’m wandering about Lincoln
looking for the ruins."</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Hilbery; her entrance created some stir in the shop;
many people looked at her.</p>

<p>"First of all, tell me where I am," she demanded, but, catching
sight of the attentive shopman, she appealed to him. "The ruins&mdash;my
party is waiting for me at the ruins. The Roman ruins&mdash;or Greek,
Mr. Denham? Your town has a great many beautiful things in it,
but I wish it hadn’t so many ruins. I never saw such delightful
little pots of honey in my life&mdash;are they made by your own bees?
Please give me one of those little pots, and tell me how I shall
find my way to the ruins."</p>

<p>"And now," she continued, having received the information and
the pot of honey, having been introduced to Mary, and having insisted
that they should accompany her back to the ruins, since in a town
with so many turnings, such prospects, such delightful little
half-naked boys dabbling in pools, such Venetian canals, such
old blue china in the curiosity shops, it was impossible for one
person all alone to find her way to the ruins. "Now," she exclaimed,
"please tell me what you’re doing here, Mr. Denham&mdash;for you <em>ARE
</em>Mr. Denham, aren’t you?" she inquired, gazing at him with
a sudden suspicion of her own accuracy. "The brilliant young man
who writes for the Review, I mean? Only yesterday my husband was
telling me he thought you one of the cleverest young men he knew.
Certainly, you’ve been the messenger of Providence to me, for
unless I’d seen you I’m sure I should never have found the ruins
at all."</p>

<p>They had reached the Roman arch when Mrs. Hilbery caught sight
of her own party, standing like sentinels facing up and down the
road so as to intercept her if, as they expected, she had got
lodged in some shop.</p>

<p>"I’ve found something much better than ruins!" she exclaimed.
"I’ve found two friends who told me how to find you, which I could
never have done without them. They must come and have tea with
us. What a pity that we’ve just had luncheon." Could they not
somehow revoke that meal?</p>

<p>Katharine, who had gone a few steps by herself down the road,
and was investigating the window of an ironmonger, as if her mother
might have got herself concealed among mowing-machines and garden-shears,
turned sharply on hearing her voice, and came towards them. She
was a great deal surprised to see Denham and Mary Datchet. Whether
the cordiality with which she greeted them was merely that which
is natural to a surprise meeting in the country, or whether she
was really glad to see them both, at any rate she exclaimed with
unusual pleasure as she shook hands:</p>

<p>"I never knew you lived here. Why didn’t you say so, and we could
have met? And are you staying with Mary?" she continued, turning
to Ralph. "What a pity we didn’t meet before."</p>

<p>Thus confronted at a distance of only a few feet by the real
body of the woman about whom he had dreamt so many million dreams,
Ralph stammered; he made a clutch at his self-control; the color
either came to his cheeks or left them, he knew not which; but
he was determined to face her and track down in the cold light
of day whatever vestige of truth there might be in his persistent
imaginations. He did not succeed in saying anything. It was Mary
who spoke for both of them. He was struck dumb by finding that
Katharine was quite different, in some strange way, from his memory,
so that he had to dismiss his old view in order to accept the
new one. The wind was blowing her crimson scarf across her face;
the wind had already loosened her hair, which looped across the
corner of one of the large, dark eyes which, so he used to think,
looked sad; now they looked bright with the brightness of the
sea struck by an unclouded ray; everything about her seemed rapid,
fragmentary, and full of a kind of racing speed. He realized suddenly
that he had never seen her in the daylight before.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it was decided that it was too late to go in search
of ruins as they had intended; and the whole party began to walk
towards the stables where the carriage had been put up.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Katharine, keeping slightly in advance of
the rest with Ralph, "I thought I saw you this morning, standing
at a window. But I decided that it couldn’t be you. And it must
have been you all the same."</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought I saw you&mdash;but it wasn’t you," he replied.</p>

<p>This remark, and the rough strain in his voice, recalled to her
memory so many difficult speeches and abortive meetings that she
was jerked directly back to the London drawing-room, the family
relics, and the tea-table; and at the same time recalled some
half-finished or interrupted remark which she had wanted to make
herself or to hear from him&mdash;she could not remember what it was.</p>

<p>"I expect it was me," she said. "I was looking for my mother.
It happens every time we come to Lincoln. In fact, there never
was a family so unable to take care of itself as ours is. Not
that it very much matters, because some one always turns up in
the nick of time to help us out of our scrapes. Once I was left
in a field with a bull when I was a baby&mdash;but where did we leave
the carriage? Down that street or the next? The next, I think."
She glanced back and saw that the others were following obediently,
listening to certain memories of Lincoln upon which Mrs. Hilbery
had started. "But what are you doing here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I’m buying a cottage. I’m going to live here&mdash;as soon as I can
find a cottage, and Mary tells me there’ll be no difficulty about
that."</p>

<p>"But," she exclaimed, almost standing still in her surprise,
"you will give up the Bar, then?" It flashed across her mind that
he must already be engaged to Mary.</p>

<p>"The solicitor’s office? Yes. I’m giving that up."</p>

<p>"But why?" she asked. She answered herself at once, with a curious
change from rapid speech to an almost melancholy tone. "I think
you’re very wise to give it up. You will be much happier."</p>

<p>At this very moment, when her words seemed to be striking a path
into the future for him, they stepped into the yard of an inn,
and there beheld the family coach of the Otways, to which one
sleek horse was already attached, while the second was being led
out of the stable door by the hostler.</p>

<p>"I don’t know what one means by happiness," he said briefly,
having to step aside in order to avoid a groom with a bucket.
"Why do you think I shall be happy? I don’t expect to be anything
of the kind. I expect to be rather less unhappy. I shall write
a book and curse my charwoman&mdash;if happiness consists in that.
What do you think?"</p>

<p>She could not answer because they were immediately surrounded
by other members of the party&mdash;by Mrs. Hilbery, and Mary, Henry
Otway, and William.</p>

<p>Rodney went up to Katharine immediately and said to her:</p>

<p>"Henry is going to drive home with your mother, and I suggest
that they should put us down half-way and let us walk back."</p>

<p>Katharine nodded her head. She glanced at him with an oddly furtive
expression.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately we go in opposite directions, or we might have
given you a lift," he continued to Denham. His manner was unusually
peremptory; he seemed anxious to hasten the departure, and Katharine
looked at him from time to time, as Denham noticed, with an expression
half of inquiry, half of annoyance. She at once helped her mother
into her cloak, and said to Mary:</p>

<p>"I want to see you. Are you going back to London at once? I will
write." She half smiled at Ralph, but her look was a little overcast
by something she was thinking, and in a very few minutes the Otway
carriage rolled out of the stable yard and turned down the high
road leading to the village of Lampsher.</p>

<p>The return drive was almost as silent as the drive from home
had been in the morning; indeed, Mrs. Hilbery leant back with
closed eyes in her corner, and either slept or feigned sleep,
as her habit was in the intervals between the seasons of active
exertion, or continued the story which she had begun to tell herself
that morning.</p>

<p>About two miles from Lampsher the road ran over the rounded summit
of the heath, a lonely spot marked by an obelisk of granite, setting
forth the gratitude of some great lady of the eighteenth century
who had been set upon by highwaymen at this spot and delivered
from death just as hope seemed lost. In summer it was a pleasant
place, for the deep woods on either side murmured, and the heather,
which grew thick round the granite pedestal, made the light breeze
taste sweetly; in winter the sighing of the trees was deepened
to a hollow sound, and the heath was as gray and almost as solitary
as the empty sweep of the clouds above it.</p>

<p>Here Rodney stopped the carriage and helped Katharine to alight.
Henry, too, gave her his hand, and fancied that she pressed it
very slightly in parting as if she sent him a message. But the
carriage rolled on immediately, without wakening Mrs. Hilbery,
and left the couple standing by the obelisk. That Rodney was angry
with her and had made this opportunity for speaking to her, Katharine
knew very well; she was neither glad nor sorry that the time had
come, nor, indeed, knew what to expect, and thus remained silent.
The carriage grew smaller and smaller upon the dusky road, and
still Rodney did not speak. Perhaps, she thought, he waited until
the last sign of the carriage had disappeared beneath the curve
of the road and they were left entirely alone. To cloak their
silence she read the writing on the obelisk, to do which she had
to walk completely round it. She was murmuring a word to two of
the pious lady’s thanks above her breath when Rodney joined her.
In silence they set out along the cart-track which skirted the
verge of the trees.</p>

<p>To break the silence was exactly what Rodney wished to do, and
yet could not do to his own satisfaction. In company it was far
easier to approach Katharine; alone with her, the aloofness and
force of her character checked all his natural methods of attack.
He believed that she had behaved very badly to him, but each separate
instance of unkindness seemed too petty to be advanced when they
were alone together.</p>

<p>"There’s no need for us to race," he complained at last; upon
which she immediately slackened her pace, and walked too slowly
to suit him. In desperation he said the first thing he thought
of, very peevishly and without the dignified prelude which he
had intended.</p>

<p>"I’ve not enjoyed my holiday."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No. I shall be glad to get back to work again."</p>

<p>"Saturday, Sunday, Monday&mdash;there are only three days more," she
counted.</p>

<p>"No one enjoys being made a fool of before other people," he
blurted out, for his irritation rose as she spoke, and got the
better of his awe of her, and was inflamed by that awe.</p>

<p>"That refers to me, I suppose," she said calmly.</p>

<p>"Every day since we’ve been here you’ve done something to make
me appear ridiculous," he went on. "Of course, so long as it amuses
you, you’re welcome; but we have to remember that we are going
to spend our lives together. I asked you, only this morning, for
example, to come out and take a turn with me in the garden. I
was waiting for you ten minutes, and you never came. Every one
saw me waiting. The stable-boys saw me. I was so ashamed that
I went in. Then, on the drive you hardly spoke to me. Henry noticed
it. Every one notices it.... You find no difficulty in talking
to Henry, though."</p>

<p>She noted these various complaints and determined philosophically
to answer none of them, although the last stung her to considerable
irritation. She wished to find out how deep his grievance lay.</p>

<p>"None of these things seem to me to matter," she said.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. I may as well hold my tongue," he replied.</p>

<p>"In themselves they don’t seem to me to matter; if they hurt
you, of course they matter," she corrected herself scrupulously.
Her tone of consideration touched him, and he walked on in silence
for a space.</p>

<p>"And we might be so happy, Katharine!" he exclaimed impulsively,
and drew her arm through his. She withdrew it directly.</p>

<p>"As long as you let yourself feel like this we shall never be
happy,"  she said.</p>

<p>The harshness, which Henry had noticed, was again unmistakable
in her manner. William flinched and was silent. Such severity,
accompanied by something indescribably cold and impersonal in
her manner, had constantly been meted out to him during the last
few days, always in the company of others. He had recouped himself
by some ridiculous display of vanity which, as he knew, put him
still more at her mercy. Now that he was alone with her there
was no stimulus from outside to draw his attention from his injury.
By a considerable effort of self-control he forced himself to
remain silent, and to make himself distinguish what part of his
pain was due to vanity, what part to the certainty that no woman
really loving him could speak thus.</p>

<p>"What do I feel about Katharine?" he thought to himself. It was
clear that she had been a very desirable and distinguished figure,
the mistress of her little section of the world; but more than
that, she was the person of all others who seemed to him the arbitress
of life, the woman whose judgment was naturally right and steady,
as his had never been in spite of all his culture. And then he
could not see her come into a room without a sense of the flowing
of robes, of the flowering of blossoms, of the purple waves of
the sea, of all things that are lovely and mutable on the surface
but still and passionate in their heart.</p>

<p>"If she were callous all the time and had only led me on to laugh
at me I couldn’t have felt that about her," he thought. "I’m not
a fool, after all. I can’t have been utterly mistaken all these
years. And yet, when she speaks to me like that! The truth of
it is," he thought, "that I’ve got such despicable faults that
no one could help speaking to me like that. Katharine is quite
right. And yet those are not my serious feelings, as she knows
quite well. How can I change myself? What would make her care
for me?" He was terribly tempted here to break the silence by
asking Katharine in what respects he could change himself to suit
her; but he sought consolation instead by running over the list
of his gifts and acquirements, his knowledge of Greek and Latin,
his knowledge of art and literature, his skill in the management
of meters, and his ancient west-country blood. But the feeling
that underlay all these feelings and puzzled him profoundly and
kept him silent was the certainty that he loved Katharine as sincerely
as he had it in him to love any one. And yet she could speak to
him like that! In a sort of bewilderment he lost all desire to
speak, and would quite readily have taken up some different topic
of conversation if Katharine had started one. This, however, she
did not do.</p>

<p>He glanced at her, in case her expression might help him to understand
her behavior. As usual, she had quickened her pace unconsciously,
and was now walking a little in front of him; but he could gain
little information from her eyes, which looked steadily at the
brown heather, or from the lines drawn seriously upon her forehead.
Thus to lose touch with her, for he had no idea what she was thinking,
was so unpleasant to him that he began to talk about his grievances
again, without, however, much conviction in his voice.</p>

<p>"If you have no feeling for me, wouldn’t it be kinder to say
so to me in private?"</p>

<p>"Oh, William," she burst out, as if he had interrupted some absorbing
train of thought, "how you go on about feelings! Isn’t it better
not to talk so much, not to be worrying always about small things
that don’t really matter?"</p>

<p>"That’s the question precisely," he exclaimed. "I only want you
to tell me that they don’t matter. There are times when you seem
indifferent to everything. I’m vain, I’ve a thousand faults; but
you know they’re not everything; you know I care for you."</p>

<p>"And if I say that I care for you, don’t you believe me?"</p>

<p>"Say it, Katharine! Say it as if you meant it! Make me feel that
you care for me!"</p>

<p>She could not force herself to speak a word. The heather was
growing dim around them, and the horizon was blotted out by white
mist. To ask her for passion or for certainty seemed like asking
that damp prospect for fierce blades of fire, or the faded sky
for the intense blue vault of June.</p>

<p>He went on now to tell her of his love for her, in words which
bore, even to her critical senses, the stamp of truth; but none
of this touched her, until, coming to a gate whose hinge was rusty,
he heaved it open with his shoulder, still talking and taking
no account of his effort. The virility of this deed impressed
her; and yet, normally, she attached no value to the power of
opening gates. The strength of muscles has nothing to do on the
face of it with the strength of affections; nevertheless, she
felt a sudden concern for this power running to waste on her account,
which, combined with a desire to keep possession of that strangely
attractive masculine power, made her rouse herself from her torpor.</p>

<p>Why should she not simply tell him the truth&mdash;which was that
she had accepted him in a misty state of mind when nothing had
its right shape or size? that it was deplorable, but that with
clearer eyesight marriage was out of the question? She did not
want to marry any one. She wanted to go away by herself, preferably
to some bleak northern moor, and there study mathematics and the
science of astronomy. Twenty words would explain the whole situation
to him. He had ceased to speak; he had told her once more how
he loved her and why. She summoned her courage, fixed her eyes
upon a lightning-splintered ash-tree, and, almost as if she were
reading a writing fixed to the trunk, began:</p>

<p>"I was wrong to get engaged to you. I shall never make you happy.
I have never loved you."</p>

<p>"Katharine!" he protested.</p>

<p>"No, never," she repeated obstinately. "Not rightly. Don’t you
see, I didn’t know what I was doing?"</p>

<p>"You love some one else?" he cut her short.</p>

<p>"Absolutely no one."</p>

<p>"Henry?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Henry? I should have thought, William, even you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is some one," he persisted. "There has been a change in
the last few weeks. You owe it to me to be honest, Katharine."</p>

<p>"If I could, I would," she replied.</p>

<p>"Why did you tell me you would marry me, then?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Why, indeed? A moment of pessimism, a sudden conviction of the
undeniable prose of life, a lapse of the illusion which sustains
youth midway between heaven and earth, a desperate attempt to
reconcile herself with facts&mdash;she could only recall a moment,
as of waking from a dream, which now seemed to her a moment of
surrender. But who could give reasons such as these for doing
what she had done? She shook her head very sadly.</p>

<p>"But you’re not a child&mdash;you’re not a woman of moods," Rodney
persisted. "You couldn’t have accepted me if you hadn’t loved
me!" he cried.</p>

<p>A sense of her own misbehavior, which she had succeeded in keeping
from her by sharpening her consciousness of Rodney’s faults, now
swept over her and almost overwhelmed her. What were his faults
in comparison with the fact that he cared for her? What were her
virtues in comparison with the fact that she did not care for
him? In a flash the conviction that not to care is the uttermost
sin of all stamped itself upon her inmost thought; and she felt
herself branded for ever.</p>

<p>He had taken her arm, and held her hand firmly in his, nor had
she the force to resist what now seemed to her his enormously
superior strength. Very well; she would submit, as her mother
and her aunt and most women, perhaps, had submitted; and yet she
knew that every second of such submission to his strength was
a second of treachery to him.</p>

<p>"I did say I would marry you, but it was wrong," she forced herself
to say, and she stiffened her arm as if to annul even the seeming
submission of that separate part of her; "for I don’t love you,
William; you’ve noticed it, every one’s noticed it; why should
we go on pretending? When I told you I loved you, I was wrong.
I said what I knew to be untrue."</p>

<p>As none of her words seemed to her at all adequate to represent
what she felt, she repeated them, and emphasized them without
realizing the effect that they might have upon a man who cared
for her. She was completely taken aback by finding her arm suddenly
dropped; then she saw his face most strangely contorted; was he
laughing, it flashed across her? In another moment she saw that
he was in tears. In her bewilderment at this apparition she stood
aghast for a second. With a desperate sense that this horror must,
at all costs, be stopped, she then put her arms about him, drew
his head for a moment upon her shoulder, and led him on, murmuring
words of consolation, until he heaved a great sigh. They held
fast to each other; her tears, too, ran down her cheeks; and were
both quite silent. Noticing the difficulty with which he walked,
and feeling the same extreme lassitude in her own limbs, she proposed
that they should rest for a moment where the bracken was brown
and shriveled beneath an oak-tree. He assented. Once more he gave
a great sigh, and wiped his eyes with a childlike unconsciousness,
and began to speak without a trace of his previous anger. The
idea came to her that they were like the children in the fairy
tale who were lost in a wood, and with this in her mind she noticed
the scattering of dead leaves all round them which had been blown
by the wind into heaps, a foot or two deep, here and there.</p>

<p>"When did you begin to feel this, Katharine?" he said; "for it
isn’t true to say that you’ve always felt it. I admit I was unreasonable
the first night when you found that your clothes had been left
behind. Still, where’s the fault in that? I could promise you
never to interfere with your clothes again. I admit I was cross
when I found you upstairs with Henry. Perhaps I showed it too
openly. But that’s not unreasonable either when one’s engaged.
Ask your mother. And now this terrible thing&mdash;" He broke off,
unable for the moment to proceed any further. "This decision you
say you’ve come to&mdash;have you discussed it with any one? Your mother,
for example, or Henry?"</p>

<p>"No, no, of course not," she said, stirring the leaves with her
hand. "But you don’t understand me, William&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Help me to understand you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don’t understand, I mean, my real feelings; how could you?
I’ve only now faced them myself. But I haven’t got the sort of
feeling&mdash;love, I mean &mdash;I don’t know what to call it"&mdash;she
looked vaguely towards the horizon sunk under mist&mdash;"but, anyhow,
without it our marriage would be a farce&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How a farce?" he asked. "But this kind of analysis is disastrous!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I should have done it before," she said gloomily.</p>

<p>"You make yourself think things you don’t think," he continued,
becoming demonstrative with his hands, as his manner was. "Believe
me, Katharine, before we came here we were perfectly happy. You
were full of plans for our house&mdash;the chair-covers, don’t you
remember?&mdash;like any other woman who is about to be married. Now,
for no reason whatever, you begin to fret about your feeling and
about my feeling, with the usual result. I assure you, Katharine,
I’ve been through it all myself. At one time I was always asking
myself absurd questions which came to nothing either. What you
want, if I may say so, is some occupation to take you out of yourself
when this morbid mood comes on. If it hadn’t been for my poetry,
I assure you, I should often have been very much in the same state
myself. To let you into a secret," he continued, with his little
chuckle, which now sounded almost assured, "I’ve often gone home
from seeing you in such a state of nerves that I had to force
myself to write a page or two before I could get you out of my
head. Ask Denham; he’ll tell you how he met me one night; he’ll
tell you what a state he found me in."</p>

<p>Katharine started with displeasure at the mention of Ralph’s
name. The thought of the conversation in which her conduct had
been made a subject for discussion with Denham roused her anger;
but, as she instantly felt, she had scarcely the right to grudge
William any use of her name, seeing what her fault against him
had been from first to last. And yet Denham! She had a view of
him as a judge. She figured him sternly weighing instances of
her levity in this masculine court of inquiry into feminine morality
and gruffly dismissing both her and her family with some half-sarcastic,
half-tolerant phrase which sealed her doom, as far as he was concerned,
for ever. Having met him so lately, the sense of his character
was strong in her. The thought was not a pleasant one for a proud
woman, but she had yet to learn the art of subduing her expression.
Her eyes fixed upon the ground, her brows drawn together, gave
William a very fair picture of the resentment that she was forcing
herself to control. A certain degree of apprehension, occasionally
culminating in a kind of fear, had always entered into his love
for her, and had increased, rather to his surprise, in the greater
intimacy of their engagement. Beneath her steady, exemplary surface
ran a vein of passion which seemed to him now perverse, now completely
irrational, for it never took the normal channel of glorification
of him and his doings; and, indeed, he almost preferred the steady
good sense, which had always marked their relationship, to a more
romantic bond. But passion she had, he could not deny it, and
hitherto he had tried to see it employed in his thoughts upon
the lives of the children who were to be born to them.</p>

<p>"She will make a perfect mother&mdash;a mother of sons," he thought;
but seeing her sitting there, gloomy and silent, he began to have
his doubts on this point. "A farce, a farce," he thought to himself.
"She said that our marriage would be a farce," and he became suddenly
aware of their situation, sitting upon the ground, among the dead
leaves, not fifty yards from the main road, so that it was quite
possible for some one passing to see and recognize them. He brushed
off his face any trace that might remain of that unseemly exhibition
of emotion. But he was more troubled by Katharine’s appearance,
as she sat rapt in thought upon the ground, than by his own; there
was something improper to him in her self-forgetfulness. A man
naturally alive to the conventions of society, he was strictly
conventional where women were concerned, and especially if the
women happened to be in any way connected with him. He noticed
with distress the long strand of dark hair touching her shoulder
and two or three dead beech-leaves attached to her dress; but
to recall her mind in their present circumstances to a sense of
these details was impossible. She sat there, seeming unconscious
of everything. He suspected that in her silence she was reproaching
herself; but he wished that she would think of her hair and of
the dead beech-leaves, which were of more immediate importance
to him than anything else. Indeed, these trifles drew his attention
strangely from his own doubtful and uneasy state of mind; for
relief, mixing itself with pain, stirred up a most curious hurry
and tumult in his breast, almost concealing his first sharp sense
of bleak and overwhelming disappointment. In order to relieve
this restlessness and close a distressingly ill-ordered scene,
he rose abruptly and helped Katharine to her feet. She smiled
a little at the minute care with which he tidied her and yet,
when he brushed the dead leaves from his own coat, she flinched,
seeing in that action the gesture of a lonely man.</p>

<p>"William," she said, "I will marry you. I will try to make you
happy."</p>
