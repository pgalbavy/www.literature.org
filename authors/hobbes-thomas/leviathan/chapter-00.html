<p>Notes on the E-Text.
This E-text was prepared from the Pelican Classics edition of Leviathan,
which in turn was prepared from the first edition. I have tried to
follow as closely as possible the original, and to give the flavour
of the text that Hobbes himself proof-read, but the following differences
were unavoidable.</p>

<p>Hobbes used capitals and italics very extensively, for emphasis,
for proper names, for quotations, and sometimes, it seems, just because.</p>

<p>The original has very extensive margin notes, which are used
to show where he introduces the definitions of words and concepts, to give
in short the subject that a paragraph or section is dealing with, and to
give references to his quotations, largely but not exclusively biblical.
To some degree, these margin notes seem to have been intended to serve
in place of an index, the original having none. They are all in italics.</p>

<p>He also used italics for words in other languages than English, and there
are a number of Greek words, in the Greek alphabet, in the text.</p>

<p>To deal with these within the limits of plain vanilla ASCII,
I have done the following in this E-text.</p>

<p>I have restricted my use of full capitalization to those places
where Hobbes used it, except in the chapter headings, which I have
fully capitalized, where Hobbes used a mixture of full capitalization
and italics.</p>

<p>Where it is clear that the italics are to indicate the text is quoting,
I have introduced quotation marks.  Within quotation marks I have
retained the capitalization that Hobbes used.</p>

<p>Where italics seem to be used for emphasis, or for proper names,
or just because, I have capitalized the initial letter of the words.
This has the disadvantage that they are not then distinguished
from those that Hobbes capitalized in plain text, but the extent
of his italics would make the text very ugly if I was to use an
underscore or slash.</p>

<p>Where the margin notes are either to introduce the paragraph subject,
or to show where he introduces word definitions, I have included them
as headers to the paragraph, again with all words having initial capitals,
and on a shortened line.</p>

<p>For margin references to quotes, I have included them in the text,
in brackets immediately next to the quotation. Where Hobbes included
references in the main text, I have left them as he put them,
except to change his square brackets to round.</p>

<p>For the Greek alphabet, I have simply substituted the nearest
ordinary letters that I can, and I have used initial capitals
for foreign language words.</p>

<p>Neither Thomas Hobbes nor his typesetters seem to have had many
inhibitions about spelling and punctuation. I have tried to reproduce
both exactly, with the exception of the introduction of quotation marks.</p>

<p>In preparing the text, I have found that it has much more meaning
if I read it with sub-vocalization, or aloud, rather than trying
to read silently.  Hobbes' use of emphasis and his eccentric
punctuation and construction seem then to work.</p>

LEVIATHAN
OR
THE MATTER, FORME, &amp; POWER
OF A COMMON-WEALTH
ECCLESIASTICAL
AND
CIVILL</p>

<p>By Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury.</p>

<p>Printed for Andrew Crooke,
at the Green Dragon
in St. Paul's Churchyard, 1651.</p>

<p>TO
MY MOST HONOR'D FRIEND
Mr. FRANCIS GODOLPHIN
of GODOLPHIN</p>

<p>HONOR'D SIR.</p>

<p>Your most worthy Brother Mr SIDNEY GODOLPHIN, when he lived,
was pleas'd to think my studies something, and otherwise to oblige me,
as you know, with reall testimonies of his good opinion, great in
themselves, and the greater for the worthinesse of his person.
For there is not any vertue that disposeth a man, either to the
service of God, or to the service of his Country, to Civill Society,
or private Friendship, that did not manifestly appear in his
conversation, not as acquired by necessity, or affected upon occasion,
but inhaerent, and shining in a generous constitution of his nature.
Therefore in honour and gratitude to him, and with devotion to your
selfe, I humbly Dedicate unto you this my discourse of Common-wealth.
I know not how the world will receive it, nor how it may reflect on
those that shall seem to favour it.  For in a way beset with those that
contend on one side for too great Liberty, and on the other side for too
much Authority, 'tis hard to passe between the points of both unwounded.
But yet, me thinks, the endeavour to advance the Civill Power, should
not be by the Civill Power condemned; nor private men, by reprehending
it, declare they think that Power too great.  Besides, I speak not
of the men, but (in the Abstract) of the Seat of Power, (like to those
simple and unpartiall creatures in the Roman Capitol, that with their
noyse defended those within it, not because they were they, but there)
offending none, I think, but those without, or such within
(if there be any such) as favour them.  That which perhaps may most offend,
are certain Texts of Holy Scripture, alledged by me to other purpose
than ordinarily they use to be by others.  But I have done it with due
submission, and also (in order to my Subject) necessarily; for they are
the Outworks of the Enemy, from whence they impugne the Civill Power.
If notwithstanding this, you find my labour generally decryed, you may
be pleased to excuse your selfe, and say that I am a man that love
my own opinions, and think all true I say, that I honoured your Brother,
and honour you, and have presum'd on that, to assume the Title
(without your knowledge) of being, as I am,</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Your most humble, and most obedient servant,
Thomas Hobbes.</p>

<p>THE INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>Nature (the art whereby God hath made and governes the world) is
by the art of man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated,
that it can make an Artificial Animal.  For seeing life is but a
motion of Limbs, the begining whereof is in some principall part within;
why may we not say, that all Automata (Engines that move themselves
by springs and wheeles as doth a watch) have an artificiall life?
For what is the Heart, but a Spring; and the Nerves, but so many Strings;
and the Joynts, but so many Wheeles, giving motion to the whole Body,
such as was intended by the Artificer?  Art goes yet further,
imitating that Rationall and most excellent worke of Nature, Man.
For by Art is created that great LEVIATHAN called a COMMON-WEALTH,
or STATE, (in latine CIVITAS) which is but an Artificiall Man;
though of greater stature and strength than the Naturall, for whose
protection and defence it was intended; and in which, the Soveraignty
is an Artificiall Soul, as giving life and motion to the whole body;
The Magistrates, and other Officers of Judicature and Execution,
artificiall Joynts; Reward and Punishment (by which fastned to the seat
of the Soveraignty, every joynt and member is moved to performe his duty)
are the Nerves, that do the same in the Body Naturall; The Wealth and
Riches of all the particular members, are the Strength; Salus Populi
(the Peoples Safety) its Businesse; Counsellors, by whom all things
needfull for it to know, are suggested unto it, are the Memory;
Equity and Lawes, an artificiall Reason and Will; Concord, Health;
Sedition, Sicknesse; and Civill War, Death.  Lastly, the Pacts and
Covenants, by which the parts of this Body Politique were at first made,
set together, and united, resemble that Fiat, or the Let Us Make Man,
pronounced by God in the Creation.</p>

<p>To describe the Nature of this Artificiall man, I will consider</p>

<p>First the Matter thereof, and the Artificer; both which is Man.</p>

<p>Secondly, How, and by what Covenants it is made; what are the Rights
and just Power or Authority of a Soveraigne; and what it is that
Preserveth and Dissolveth it.</p>

<p>Thirdly, what is a Christian Common-Wealth.</p>

<p>Lastly, what is the Kingdome of Darkness.</p>

<p>Concerning the first, there is a saying much usurped of late,
That Wisedome is acquired, not by reading of Books, but of Men.
Consequently whereunto, those persons, that for the most part can
give no other proof of being wise, take great delight to shew what
they think they have read in men, by uncharitable censures of one
another behind their backs.  But there is another saying not of late
understood, by which they might learn truly to read one another,
if they would take the pains; and that is, Nosce Teipsum, Read Thy Self:
which was not meant, as it is now used, to countenance, either
the barbarous state of men in power, towards their inferiors;
or to encourage men of low degree, to a sawcie behaviour towards
their betters; But to teach us, that for the similitude of the thoughts,
and Passions of one man, to the thoughts, and Passions of another,
whosoever looketh into himselfe, and considereth what he doth,
when he does Think, Opine, Reason, Hope, Feare, &amp;c, and upon what grounds;
he shall thereby read and know, what are the thoughts, and Passions
of all other men, upon the like occasions.  I say the similitude
of Passions, which are the same in all men, Desire, Feare, Hope, &amp;c;
not the similitude or The Objects of the Passions, which are the things
Desired, Feared, Hoped, &amp;c: for these the constitution individuall,
and particular education do so vary, and they are so easie to be kept
from our knowledge, that the characters of mans heart, blotted and
confounded as they are, with dissembling, lying, counterfeiting,
and erroneous doctrines, are legible onely to him that searcheth hearts.
And though by mens actions wee do discover their designee sometimes;
yet to do it without comparing them with our own, and distinguishing
all circumstances, by which the case may come to be altered,
is to decypher without a key, and be for the most part deceived,
by too much trust, or by too much diffidence; as he that reads,
is himselfe a good or evill man.</p>

<p>But let one man read another by his actions never so perfectly,
it serves him onely with his acquaintance, which are but few.
He that is to govern a whole Nation, must read in himselfe, not this,
or that particular man; but Man-kind; which though it be hard to do,
harder than to learn any Language, or Science; yet, when I shall have
set down my own reading orderly, and perspicuously, the pains left another,
will be onely to consider, if he also find not the same in himselfe.
For this kind of Doctrine, admitteth no other Demonstration.</p>
