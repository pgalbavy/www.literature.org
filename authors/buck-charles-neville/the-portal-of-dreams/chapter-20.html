<p>I have since searchingly asked myself whether, at that time, any mean
thought entered my mind as to the possibilities which might open for me
if Weighborne died. I set it down in justification, though it may rather
be attributable to the excitement of the moment than to inherent
guilelessness, that that phase of the matter did not occur to me. Had I
entertained such speculations they must have been short lived, for when
we arrived at the cabin and made an examination, and when later by
relayed telephone messages we brought the doctor, it was to learn that
the patient would have to lie in bed for perhaps a week or two, but need
fear no grave consequences. His wound had narrowly missed the heart, but
the margin was sufficient. My own injury proved to be a mere flesh
scratch and a bandage did for it all that was needful.
</p><p>I was rather surprised at the almost lethargic calmness with which the
household greeted our disordered homecoming. Preparations for supper
went on with little interruption. There was no excited demand from those
who had stayed at home, for the full story, and even the children seemed
uninquisitive. Only the aged woman showed a flash of unexpected fire as
she demanded, "Didn't ye git nary one of <u>them</u>?"
</p><p>"We got Rat-Ankle," drawled an unshaven lout with a revolting note of
placid satisfaction.
</p><p>"That's better'n not gettin' nary one," commended the old woman. Her
voice revealed the hereditary source of Marcus' ability for sincere
hating.
</p><p>I looked at her aged, monkey-like face and the intensity of her beady
eyes with wonderment. There was vindictiveness there but no fear, no
excitement even, except the excitement of hate--and yet this old woman
was the same who could not be induced to travel on a railroad train for
fear of an accident.
</p><p>It was several hours later that the doctor arrived. He was much like the
men among whom he lived. If he had once been otherwise long association
had roughened him to their own similitude. He entered with a wordless
nod and went straight to the bed where the injured man lay unconscious.
After a silent examination he opened his worn and faded saddle-bags and
proceeded taciturnly but capably with his work. He asked no questions
and Marcus volunteered no explanation. At last he rose and said, "He
ain't in no great danger if he keeps quiet. Have you got a little licker
in the house, Calloway?"
</p><p>Before the fireplace he poured generously from a stoneware jug into a
tin cup, but instead of tossing down his white whiskey at a gulp he
sipped it slowly, while he gave directions to the lawyer or shouted them
loudly into the ear of the old woman. The only allusion to the ambuscade
came from her.
</p><p>"Our folks got Rat-Ankle," she announced somewhat triumphantly. "But
they didn't see nary other face of them that lay-wayed 'em."
</p><p>"Don't pay no attention to Mother," said Marcus more hastily than I had
before heard him speak; "at times she gets childish."
</p><p>The physician nodded.
</p><p>Then it was that I, in an ignorance which had not learned the valuable
art of general distrust, volunteered a remark for which my host, so soon
as we were alone, rebuked me sternly.
</p><p>"Mrs. Marcus is mistaken as to that," I said. "Just as the volley was
fired, I recognized Curt Dawson."
</p><p>The voice of Calloway Marcus again cut in with an interruption. "Oh, I
reckon you're mistaken about that, Mr. Deprayne. I understand Dawson is
across the Virginia line."
</p><p>"I'm sure enough," I persisted, failing entirely to catch my host's
effort to silence me, "to swear to it in court."
</p><p>"Mr. Deprayne is a stranger here," deprecated the lawyer. "He isn't
familiar enough with our people to be certain in these matters."
</p><p>Again the doctor nodded and, taking up his saddle-bags, went out. As
soon as he had bidden him farewell, Marcus returned. He walked over and
stood before me with a face that was deeply troubled. Except for his
mother, too deaf to hear his low-pitched voice, and Weighborne, whose
initial unconsciousness had passed under medical administrations into a
profound sleep, we were alone.
</p><p>"Sir," he said patiently, "I can't be angry with you because you don't
understand what you have done. Perhaps I should have warned you. I sent
for Richardson because he was the only doctor within many hours' riding,
but I don't confide in him. He will carry straight to Garvin your
announcement that you have recognized his gun-man. You have given away a
secret I might have used to great advantage. Sir, you have tremendously
complicated matters."
</p><p>He dropped his hands at his sides with a weary gesture, half-despair.
"However, it's done now," he added, "it's no use to deplore it--but, for
God's sake, be more careful in the future."
</p><p>When Weighborne recovered consciousness he spoke to me once more of his
wife. He was afraid that an exaggerated report of the affair would leak
through to the Lexington papers, and he wished to allay her anxiety. The
duty of this reassurance devolved on me, but the complicated system of
telephoning spared me the torture of felicitating her. The message was
relayed through disinterested voices before it reached her ears. As it
eventuated Weighborne's precaution was a wise one since the news
filtered that same night to a newspaper correspondent at the railroad
town. This scribe so well utilized his information that the papers of
the next morning carried scare-heads over a story of bloodshed and
massacre which accorded to both of us desperate wounds and ludicrously
lauded us as heroes.
</p><p>It cannot be said for Weighborne that he proved a docile patient. He had
all the energetic man's aversion to inactive days in bed, and he greatly
preferred, if he must submit to such an exigency, that it be in his own
bed and among more plentiful conveniences, than could be afforded here.
But to move him over twenty semi-perpendicular miles was pronounced
impossible and to that decree he had to submit.
</p><p>I, who, despite my newspaper peril, was not even bedridden, continued
the daily rides to tracts marked for inspection, and discussed the day's
work with him in the evening.
</p><p>One afternoon we met in the road a party of horsemen who halted us and
expressed the desire for a peaceable parley. Marcus gave his assurance
and a stout fellow with a ruddy, good-natured face and a benevolent
smile rode out and accosted us.
</p><p>"You're a lawyer, Calloway," he began, "an' I reckon you know I've got
to do my duty. I hope you ain't holdin' hit ergainst me none." He paused
and seemed relieved when the attorney nodded his understanding.
</p><p>"I just want ter know ef you won't bring yer fellers ter county co'te
any day this week that suits you an' answer fer the killin' of
Rat-Ankle. I'm namin' it to yer like a friend, an' I'm askin' you ter
set the day. Hit ain't nothin' but a matter of givin' bail noways."
</p><p>"For whom have you warrants?" asked Marcus.
</p><p>The sheriff read a list of a half-dozen names, all kinsmen and retainers
of the attorney. Weighborne and myself were not included. Marcus
accepted service and agreed to be present on the date named. It was not
until the sheriff's men had waved their hands and ridden away that he
turned to me.
</p><p>"That shows Garvin's effrontery," he remarked with a laugh. "He
summonses me to answer in his own court, for meeting with hostility the
attack of his own assassins. I'll be there--but I hope to give him a
surprise."
</p><p>Weighborne had some temperature and was often restless on his mattress
of corn shucks, though his amiability held steady. One evening several
days after our ambuscade, I was sitting alone and morose before the open
hearth while he slept. Since our apartment had been a sickroom, the
evening gatherings had been suspended and I had companionship only from
my pipe and thoughts. The thoughts were not cheery comrades to-night.
They went back with a brutal sort of insistence to the island and the
things which had there taken root, to grow with the rank and lawless
swiftness of the tropics. I had had a long conversation with Marcus that
evening in which he had outlined his plans for the examining trials. He
meant to strike a bold and unexpected blow, using me as his star
witness.
</p><p>All that the county judge could do would be to fix a bond for answering
to the grand jury, but the circuit court was also under the influence of
the dictator, and later when the trials came up on that docket the
prosecution would become persecution. Garvin would, however, fix a light
bond, he thought, in the preliminary hearing and would expect Marcus to
await the main issue later. Therefore, he meant to forestall the attack
with an attack in the county court. His enemies would rely on his
reputation as a supporter of law and order to make his warfare a warfare
within the law, and that would also lull them into expecting only
formal and preparatory fencing at the hearing of next Wednesday.
</p><p>"When I take the course which I mean to take," the attorney had assured
me, "it will be in the nature of exploding a bomb and may precipitate
trouble. If I had the power to do so I should ask for a militia
detachment to be present and preserve order, but unfortunately such a
call can come only from some civil officer such as the circuit
judge--and he is not disposed to act on my request. I shall have to
satisfy myself with having in town every anti-Garvin man whom I can
bring there. Garvin doesn't want a general battle just now. He doesn't
want to attract outside clamor. He wants to move in the dark, so I think
he will instruct against an outbreak in the streets or court-room. But
there is one thing I can do, and that I am arranging. I am held in some
respect by the papers of Louisville and Lexington, and I have written a
rather full statement of conditions here and asked that reporters be
present in the court-room on Wednesday. That will mean that whatever
transpires cannot be hushed up. Then I shall move to swear Garvin off
the bench, announcing openly that his jackal led this ambuscade in
obedience to his own orders. That will be my surprise and my proof of it
will be your testimony. If he suspected it he would find a way to
silence you. Even as it is he knows you recognized Dawson and you must
be cautious. He may seek to keep you out of court."
</p><p>At length I slipped out and stood for a while leaning against a post of
the porch, although the air was sharp with frost, and the stars pierced
coldly through the hard steel of a winter sky. My other skies had been
softer.
</p><p>The mountains, under a young moon, stood out black and forbidding; frost
mists hung like frozen smoke on the lowlands. From somewhere about the
house came the nasal singing of a mountaineer to the plunking of a
tuneless banjo. His voice rose and quavered and fell with more care that
his words be distinct than that his notes be true. He had chosen a song
composed by a local bard, and as I stood gazing off across the sea of
moonlight and mist he alone broke and tortured the silence.
</p><p>    "Right down here in Adamson coun-tee
</p><p>        Where they have no church of our Lord,
    Frank Smith sold Pate Art'b'ry some whis-key
</p><p>        And caused him to get shot in the for'd."
</p><p>His fellows, in all solemnity, took up the ludicrous chorus and
trumpeted in through their noses.
</p><p>    "Oh, whis-key's the root of all ev-il,
</p><p>        It fills up a drunkard's hell,<br/>
    So why not vote out this old ev-il
</p><p>        And say farewell, whis-key, farewell!"
</p><p>I smiled as I thought how little they were changed from rude retainers
in an old, oak-raftered hall of feudal England. I felt as remote from
civilization as though I were living behind the moat and draw-bridge of
some embattled baron. In such a place anything might happen.
</p><p>And then as the singers fell silent again, I became aware of a faint and
distant sound of voices. The hound which lay curled upon the top step of
the porch rose and sniffed the keen air, his bristles rising. In a
moment he was off toward the road, barking blatantly.
</p><p>The voices became more distinct and I moved from my position in the
moonlight to the corner of the house where the shadow fell black enough
to swallow me. As I did so a shuffling of feet in the loft told me that
the men there had also caught the sound. The approaching party must be
coming to this house, since we had no neighbor within three-quarters of
a mile and the road ran out and ended at our gate.
</p><p>Shortly a group of horsemen came into view, climbing the hill a quarter
of a mile away. They seemed to be riding close together, knee to knee,
and except when they crossed the intervals of the moon's spotlight one
could see them only in a massed effect. They came to a halt in the
shadow at a little distance from the gate.
</p><p>The noiseless opening of a door and a momentary glimpse of a stealthy,
rifle-armed figure slipping out into the shadow of the kitchen assured
me of the preparedness of the impecunious clansmen who played watchdogs
for their keep.
</p><p>Then a loud and affable voice from the road gave greeting, "Hello, Cal
Marcus!"
</p><p>There was no immediate reply. Those inside were awaiting a more
conclusive guarantee of pacific intent. Seemingly amicable salutations
shouted from the night had before now brought householders into the
excellent target of a lighted door, where they had lain down and died.
</p><p>"Hello, Cal Marcus!" called the voice again, "we're a-comin' in."
</p><p>"Who be ye?" challenged a voice from the interior. "Don't come till we
know who ye be."
</p><p>In the next moment I started violently and found myself in a tremor from
head to foot, for the voice which answered the question was a woman's
voice, and it was the voice of rich contralto which I had once heard and
often imagined.
</p><p>"It's I, Frances Weighborne," was the response, "and some gentlemen who
rode over with me from the train." In corroboration came other voices,
deep and masculine, and evidently recognized within as the voices of
friends. The man in the shadow of the kitchen came out from his
concealment and started down to the gate swinging his rifle at his side.
A door opened and framed the emaciated, half-clad figure of Calloway
Marcus. "Come right in, Ma'm," he shouted. The group rode up into the
light and dismounted.
</p><p>I saw her come in at the gate. The moonlight was full upon her, and I
stood skulking in my concealment of shadow like a thief, held fast in a
paralysis of jealousy and worship.
</p><p>This was no place for me. I, of all men in the world, could least endure
or be endured at that greeting between Weighborne and his wife who had
ridden these mountains to be with him.
