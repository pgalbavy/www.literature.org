<p>There was no happier boy in all Kentucky than Jack Gedney on
the morning that completed the first twelve years of his life,
for on that day his father presented him with a fine rifle.</p>

<p>Now, you must know that some of the best riflemen in the world
have been born and reared in Kentucky, where the early settlers
had to fight not only the wild beasts, but the fierce red men. 
The battles between the Indians and pioneers were so many that
Kentucky came to be known as the Dark and Bloody Ground.</p>

<p>Some of you may have heard that the most famous pioneer in American
history was Daniel Boone, who entered all alone the vast wilderness
south of the Ohio, and spent many months there before the Revolution
broke out.  The emigrants began flocking thither as soon as it
became known that the soil of Kentucky was rich, and that the
woods abounded with game.</p>

<p>Among those who went thither, towards the close of the last century,
were Thomas Gedney and his wife Abigail.  With a dozen other families,
they floated down the Ohio in a flat boat, until a short distance
below the mouth of the Licking, when they landed, and, taking
the boat apart, used the material in building their cabins.</p>

<p>It happened at that period that there was less trouble than usual
with the red men.  Some of the settlers believed that the Indians,
finding themselves unable to stay the tide of immigration that
was pouring over the west, would move deeper into the solitudes
which stretched beyond the Mississippi.  Instead of putting up
their cabins close together, a part of the pioneers pushed farther
into the woods, and began their houses where they found better
sites.  Most of them were near natural "clearings," where the
fertile soil was easily made ready for the corn and vegetables,
without the hard work of cutting down the trees and clearing out
the stumps.</p>

<p>Thomas Gedney and his wife were among those who went farther
than the spot where they landed from the flat boat.  Indeed, they
pushed deeper into the woods than any one else who helped to found
the little settlement that was planted a hundred years ago on
the southern bank of the Ohio.  Their nearest neighbours were
the members of the Burton family, who lived a mile to the eastward,
while a mile farther in that direction were the little group of
cabins that marked the beginning of one of the most prosperous
towns of to-day in Kentucky.</p>

<p>Mr. Gedney was fortunate enough to find a clearing of an acre
in extent, with a small stream running near. Since he had helped
his neighbours to put up their cabins, they in return gave him
such aid that in a few days he had a strong, comfortable structure
of logs, into which he moved with his wife and only child, Jack,
then but six years old.</p>

<p>The sturdy men who built their homes in the depths of the wilderness
a century ago were never in such haste that they forgot to make
them strong and secure. The red men might be peaceful, and might
make promises to molest the white people no more, but the pioneers
knew better than to trust to such promises. There are no more
treacherous people in the whole world than the American Indians,
and no man is wise who places much faith in their pledges.</p>

<p>But I have not started to tell you the history of the pioneers
who came down the Ohio in the flat boat, but to give an account
of some strange adventures that befell Jack Gedney, shortly after
his rifle was given to him by his father.  Jack had been trained
in sighting and firing a gun as soon as he could learn to close
his left eye while he kept the other open.  His father’s rifle
was too heavy for him to aim off-hand, but kneeling behind a fallen
tree, or a stump, or rock, his keen vision was able to direct
the little bullet with such precision, that Daniel Boone himself,
who one day watched the little fellow, gave him much praise.</p>

<p>In those days there was nothing in which a Kentuckian took more
pride than in his skill with his rifle. Thomas Gedney had never
met his superior, and he meant that if his boy Jack lived the
same should be said of him.  And so, while the mother gave the
boy instruction in reading and writing, the father took many long
tramps with him through the woods, and taught him how to become
a great hunter.  He showed him the difference between the tracks
of the various game, and told him of the peculiar habits of the
wild animals and the best method of outwitting them. More than
all, he did his best to teach Jack how to guard against his most
dangerous of all foes&mdash;man himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Gedney was a man who took great precautions when constructing
his cabin.  He built it just as strongly as it was possible to
make it.  The windows were so narrow that no grown person could
force his body through, the roof was so steep that the most agile
red man could not climb it, and the heavy door, when closed and
barred inside, was really as stout as the solid walls of logs
themselves.</p>

<p>I have not time to tell you about several incidents that proved
his wisdom in taking so much pains to guard himself and family
against their dusky foes the Indians, but the time came when the
woodcraft thus taught to the boy proved of the greatest value
to him.</p>

<p>Among the important rules laid down by the father for the son’s
guidance was that the very first thing to be done after firing
his rifle was to re-load it; that in tramping through the woods
he should bear in mind that he was always in danger, and that
he must look not only in front but beside and behind him; that
he must take all pains to hide his trail whenever there was the
least cause to fear the red men; that he must use the utmost precaution
when lying down to sleep for the night; that in communicating
with his friends he must do so by means of signals that a foe
could not understand; that he must always be on the watch for
signs of an enemy’s presence; and that, when brought face to face
with a foe, he must remember that a second’s forgetfulness or
impatience was almost certain to give the other the decisive advantage
over him.</p>

<p>These were but a few of the rules that were impressed upon Jack
by his father, who, as I have already told you, spent many hours
with him in the woods, the two afterwards coming back to the cabin
laden with game that kept the family well provided with food for
many days.</p>

<p>Mr. Gedney had sent eastward for the gun which he gave to his
son on his birthday.  It was of fine make and somewhat lighter
than his own, for several years must pass before Jack would be
strong enough to handle a man’s weapon.  The piece would not have
been looked upon in these days as of much account, for it was
a muzzle-loader with a flint-lock. When Jack wished to load it,
he emptied the charge from his powder-horn into the palm of his
hand; this was carefully poured into the muzzle of his gun, and
then the round bullet, enclosed in a piece of greased cloth or
a damp bit of paper, was rammed down upon it.  The ramrod was
afterwards pushed back in place on the under-side of the barrel,
and, raising the clumsy hammer, which clasped the piece of yellow
flint, the pan beneath was filled with powder, connecting by means
of a touch-hole with the powder in the barrel behind the bullet.</p>

<p>The hammer was let down so as to hold the powder in place.  When
the owner wished to fire the gun he drew back the hammer, sighted,
and pulled the trigger.  The flint nipped against a piece of steel,
giving out a spark of fire, which set off the grains in the pan,
the latter also touching off the powder in the breech of the barrel,
which drove out the bullet. </p>
