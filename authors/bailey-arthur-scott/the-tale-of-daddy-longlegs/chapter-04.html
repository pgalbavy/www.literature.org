<p>"MY cousin, Jasper Jay, has kindly consented to ask us some questions,"
Mr. Crow informed Daddy Longlegs. "And he will decide which of us makes
the wiser answers."
</p>
<p>Buster Bumblebee, who was watching and listening, said:
</p><p>"That's hardly fair, it seems to me."
</p><p>But old Mr. Crow quickly told him that he was a stupid fellow and that
he'd better keep still. And since a good many other people had
frequently said the same thing to that young gentleman, Buster began to
think there might be some truth in it. So he said nothing more.
</p><p>Meanwhile Daddy Longlegs beamed upon all the company. And Mr. Crow
looked at him out of the corner of his eye. Then he said to Daddy, "I
suppose you've no objection to this plan?"
</p><p>"It suits me very well," Daddy replied.
</p><p>"I thought it would," said old Mr. Crow with a smirk. And turning to his
cousin, Jasper Jay, he remarked in a low voice that Daddy Longlegs was
even duller than he had imagined.
</p><p>Then Jasper Jay announced that he would put the first question. And
after he had heard Mr. Crow's opinion he would listen to Daddy
Longlegs'.
</p><p>"When is the best time to plant corn?" Jasper then asked Mr. Crow, while
the whole company craned their necks and strained their ears--for of
course they didn't want to miss anything.
</p><p>Mr. Crow made no answer for a few moments. He appeared to be thinking
deeply. But at last he looked up and said:
</p><p>"The best time to plant corn is as early as possible."
</p><p>A good many of those present exclaimed at once that that was a good
answer. And a few clapped their hands.
</p><p>"What's your opinion?" Jasper Jay then asked, turning to Daddy Longlegs.
</p><p>Daddy Longlegs took off his hat, mopped his narrow forehead with his red
bandanna, and then slowly nodded his head three times.
</p><p>"My answer is exactly the same as Mr. Crow's," he piped in his queer,
thin, high voice.
</p><p>At that a look of displeasure passed quickly over the faces of the two
cousins. And when little Mr. Chippy called on Jasper Jay to decide
which was the better answer, Jasper looked really worried.
</p><p>"It's a tie this time," he said somewhat sourly. And while everybody was
shouting, he and Mr. Crow withdrew to one side and whispered, which some
considered to be rather bad manners.
</p><p>Soon Jasper and Mr. Crow returned to the eager throng. And Jasper now
looked as brazen as ever.
</p><p>"I'll put the next question," he announced. "And Daddy Longlegs may
answer first.... How many kernels of corn make a meal!"
</p><p>There wasn't a sound--except for Buster Bumblebee's buzzing--as Daddy
Longlegs moved forward a few steps and held his hand behind his ear.
</p><p>"Speak louder!" somebody said to Jasper. "You know he's hard of
hearing."
</p><p>So Jasper Jay repeated the question. But Daddy Longlegs only looked at
him blankly.
</p><p>It was quite clear that he couldn't understand a single word that Jasper
said.
