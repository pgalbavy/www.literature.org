Though her clothes were torn and her hair disheveled,
Albert Werper realized that he never before had looked
upon such a vision of loveliness as that which Lady
Greystoke presented in the relief and joy which she
felt in coming so unexpectedly upon a friend and
rescuer when hope had seemed so far away.
<P>
If the Belgian had entertained any doubts as to the
woman's knowledge of his part in the perfidious attack
upon her home and herself, it was quickly dissipated by
the genuine friendliness of her greeting.  She told him
quickly of all that had befallen her since he had
departed from her home, and as she spoke of the death
of her husband her eyes were veiled by the tears which
she could not repress.
<P>
"I am shocked," said Werper, in well-simulated
sympathy; "but I am not surprised.  That devil there,"
and he pointed toward the body of Achmet Zek, "has
terrorized the entire country.  Your Waziri are either
exterminated, or have been driven out of their country,
far to the south.  The men of Achmet Zek occupy the
plain about your former home--there is neither
sanctuary nor escape in that direction.  Our only hope
lies in traveling northward as rapidly as we may, of
coming to the camp of the raiders before the knowledge
of Achmet Zek's death reaches those who were left
there, and of obtaining, through some ruse, an escort
toward the north.
<P>
"I think that the thing can be accomplished, for I was
a guest of the raider's before I knew the nature of the
man, and those at the camp are not aware that I turned
against him when I discovered his villainy.
<P>
"Come!  We will make all possible haste to reach the
camp before those who accompanied Achmet Zek upon his
last raid have found his body and carried the news of
his death to the cut-throats who remained behind.  It
is our only hope, Lady Greystoke, and you must place
your entire faith in me if I am to succeed.  Wait for
me here a moment while I take from the Arab's body the
wallet that he stole from me," and Werper stepped
quickly to the dead man's side, and, kneeling, sought
with quick fingers the pouch of jewels.  To his
consternation, there was no sign of them in the
garments of Achmet Zek.  Rising, he walked back along
the trail, searching for some trace of the missing
pouch or its contents; but he found nothing, even
though he searched carefully the vicinity of his dead
horse, and for a few paces into the jungle on either
side.  Puzzled, disappointed and angry, he at last
returned to the girl.  "The wallet is gone," he
explained, crisply, "and I dare not delay longer in
search of it. We must reach the camp before the
returning raiders."
<P>
Unsuspicious of the man's true character, Jane Clayton
saw nothing peculiar in his plans, or in his specious
explanation of his former friendship for the raider,
and so she grasped with alacrity the seeming hope for
safety which he proffered her, and turning about she
set out with Albert Werper toward the hostile camp in
which she so lately had been a prisoner.
<P>
It was late in the afternoon of the second day before
they reached their destination, and as they paused upon
the edge of the clearing before the gates of the walled
village, Werper cautioned the girl to accede to
whatever he might suggest by his conversation with the
raiders.
<P>
"I shall tell them," he said, "that I apprehended you
after you escaped from the camp, that I took you to
Achmet Zek, and that as he was engaged in a stubborn
battle with the Waziri, he directed me to return to
camp with you, to obtain here a sufficient guard, and
to ride north with you as rapidly as possible and
dispose of you at the most advantageous terms to a
certain slave broker whose name he gave me."
<P>
Again the girl was deceived by the apparent frankness
of the Belgian.  She realized that desperate situations
required desperate handling, and though she trembled
inwardly at the thought of again entering the vile and
hideous village of the raiders she saw no better course
than that which her companion had suggested.
<P>
Calling aloud to those who tended the gates, Werper,
grasping Jane Clayton by the arm, walked boldly across
the clearing.  Those who opened the gates to him
permitted their surprise to show clearly in their
expressions.  That the discredited and hunted
lieutenant should be thus returning fearlessly of his
own volition, seemed to disarm them quite as
effectually as his manner toward Lady Greystoke had
deceived her.
<P>
The sentries at the gate returned Werper's salutations,
and viewed with astonishment the prisoner whom he
brought into the village with him.
<P>
Immediately the Belgian sought the Arab who had been
left in charge of the camp during Achmet Zek's absence,
and again his boldness disarmed suspicion and won the
acceptance of his false explanation of his return.
The fact that he had brought back with him the woman
prisoner who had escaped, added strength to his claims,
and Mohammed Beyd soon found himself fraternizing
good-naturedly with the very man whom he would have slain
without compunction had he discovered him alone in the
jungle a half hour before.
<P>
Jane Clayton was again confined to the prison hut she
had formerly occupied, but as she realized that this
was but a part of the deception which she and Frecoult
were playing upon the credulous raiders, it was with
quite a different sensation that she again entered the
vile and filthy interior, from that which she had
previously experienced, when hope was so far away.
<P>
Once more she was bound and sentries placed before the
door of her prison; but before Werper left her he
whispered words of cheer into her ear.  Then he left,
and made his way back to the tent of Mohammed Beyd.
He had been wondering how long it would be before the
raiders who had ridden out with Achmet Zek would return
with the murdered body of their chief, and the more he
thought upon the matter the greater his fears became,
that without accomplices his plan would fail.
<P>
What, even, if he got away from the camp in safety
before any returned with the true story of his guilt--
of what value would this advantage be other than to
protract for a few days his mental torture and his
life?  These hard riders, familiar with every trail and
bypath, would get him long before he could hope to
reach the coast.
<P>
As these thoughts passed through his mind he entered
the tent where Mohammed Beyd sat cross-legged upon a
rug, smoking.  The Arab looked up as the European came
into his presence.
<P>
"Greetings, O Brother!" he said.
<P>
"Greetings!" replied Werper.
<P>
For a while neither spoke further.  The Arab was the
first to break the silence.
<P>
"And my master, Achmet Zek, was well when last you saw
him?" he asked.
<P>
"Never was he safer from the sins and dangers of
mortality," replied the Belgian.
<P>
"It is well," said Mohammed Beyd, blowing a little puff
of blue smoke straight out before him.
<P>
Again there was silence for several minutes.
<P>
"And if he were dead?" asked the Belgian, determined to
lead up to the truth, and attempt to bribe Mohammed
Beyd into his service.
<P>
The Arab's eyes narrowed and he leaned forward, his
gaze boring straight into the eyes of the Belgian.
<P>
"I have been thinking much, Werper, since you returned
so unexpectedly to the camp of the man whom you had
deceived, and who sought you with death in his heart.
I have been with Achmet Zek for many years--his own
mother never knew him so well as I. He never forgives--
much less would he again trust a man who had once
betrayed him; that I know.
<P>
"I have thought much, as I said, and the result of my
thinking has assured me that Achmet Zek is dead--for
otherwise you would never have dared return to his
camp, unless you be either a braver man or a bigger
fool than I have imagined.  And, if this evidence of my
judgment is not sufficient, I have but just now
received from your own lips even more confirmatory
witness--for did you not say that Achmet Zek was never
more safe from the sins and dangers of mortality?
<P>
"Achmet Zek is dead--you need not deny it.  I was not
his mother, or his mistress, so do not fear that my
wailings shall disturb you.  Tell me why you have come
back here. Tell me what you want, and, Werper, if you
still possess the jewels of which Achmet Zek told me,
there is no reason why you and I should not ride north
together and divide the ransom of the white woman and
the contents of the pouch you wear about your person. Eh?"
<P>
The evil eyes narrowed, a vicious, thin-lipped smile
tortured the villainous face, as Mohammed Beyd grinned
knowingly into the face of the Belgian.
<P>
Werper was both relieved and disturbed by the Arab's
attitude.  The complacency with which he accepted the
death of his chief lifted a considerable burden of
apprehension from the shoulders of Achmet Zek's
assassin; but his demand for a share of the jewels
boded ill for Werper when Mohammed Beyd should have
learned that the precious stones were no longer in the
Belgian's possession.
<P>
To acknowledge that he had lost the jewels might be to
arouse the wrath or suspicion of the Arab to such an
extent as would jeopardize his new-found chances of
escape.  His one hope seemed, then, to lie in fostering
Mohammed Beyd's belief that the jewels were still in
his possession, and depend upon the accidents of the
future to open an avenue of escape.
<P>
Could he contrive to tent with the Arab upon the march
north, he might find opportunity in plenty to remove
this menace to his life and liberty--it was worth
trying, and, further, there seemed no other way out of
his difficulty.
<P>
"Yes," he said, "Achmet Zek is dead.  He fell in battle
with a company of Abyssinian cavalry that held me
captive.  During the fighting I escaped; but I doubt if
any of Achmet Zek's men live, and the gold they sought
is in the possession of the Abyssinians.  Even now they
are doubtless marching on this camp, for they were sent
by Menelek to punish Achmet Zek and his followers for a
raid upon an Abyssinian village.  There are many of
them, and if we do not make haste to escape we shall
all suffer the same fate as Achmet Zek."
<P>
Mohammed Beyd listened in silence.  How much of the
unbeliever's story he might safely believe he did not
know; but as it afforded him an excuse for deserting
the village and making for the north he was not
inclined to cross-question the Belgian too minutely.
<P>
"And if I ride north with you," he asked, "half the
jewels and half the ransom of the woman shall be mine?"
<P>
"Yes," replied Werper.
<P>
"Good," said Mohammed Beyd.  "I go now to give the
order for the breaking of camp early on the morrow,"
and he rose to leave the tent.
<P>
Werper laid a detaining hand upon his arm.
<P>
"Wait," he said, "let us determine how many shall
accompany us.  It is not well that we be burdened by
the women and children, for then indeed we might be
overtaken by the Abyssinians.  It would be far better
to select a small guard of your bravest men, and leave
word behind that we are riding WEST.  Then, when
the Abyssinians come they will be put upon the wrong
trail should they have it in their hearts to pursue us,
and if they do not they will at least ride north with
less rapidity than as though they thought that we were
ahead of them."
<P>
"The serpent is less wise than thou, Werper," said
Mohammed Beyd with a smile.  "It shall be done as you
say.  Twenty men shall accompany us, and we shall ride
WEST--when we leave the village."
<P>
"Good," cried the Belgian, and so it was arranged.
<P>
Early the next morning Jane Clayton, after an almost
sleepless night, was aroused by the sound of voices
outside her prison, and a moment later, M. Frecoult,
and two Arabs entered.  The latter unbound her ankles
and lifted her to her feet.  Then her wrists were
loosed, she was given a handful of dry bread, and led
out into the faint light of dawn.
<P>
She looked questioningly at Frecoult, and at a moment
that the Arab's attention was attracted in another
direction the man leaned toward her and whispered that
all was working out as he had planned.  Thus assured,
the young woman felt a renewal of the hope which the
long and miserable night of bondage had almost expunged.
<P>
Shortly after, she was lifted to the back of a horse,
and surrounded by Arabs, was escorted through the
gateway of the village and off into the jungle toward
the west.  Half an hour later the party turned north,
and northerly was their direction for the balance of
the march.
<P>
M. Frecoult spoke with her but seldom, and she
understood that in carrying out his deception he must
maintain the semblance of her captor, rather than
protector, and so she suspected nothing though she saw
the friendly relations which seemed to exist between
the European and the Arab leader of the band.
<P>
If Werper succeeded in keeping himself from
conversation with the young woman, he failed signally
to expel her from his thoughts.  A hundred times a day
he found his eyes wandering in her direction and
feasting themselves upon her charms of face and figure.
Each hour his infatuation for her grew, until his
desire to possess her gained almost the proportions of
madness.
<P>
If either the girl or Mohammed Beyd could have guessed
what passed in the mind of the man which each thought a
friend and ally, the apparent harmony of the little
company would have been rudely disturbed.
<P>
Werper had not succeeded in arranging to tent with
Mohammed Beyd, and so he revolved many plans for the
assassination of the Arab that would have been greatly
simplified had he been permitted to share the other's
nightly shelter.
<P>
Upon the second day out Mohammed Beyd reined his horse
to the side of the animal on which the captive was
mounted.  It was, apparently, the first notice which
the Arab had taken of the girl; but many times during
these two days had his cunning eyes peered greedily
from beneath the hood of his burnoose to gloat upon the
beauties of the prisoner.
<P>
Nor was this hidden infatuation of any recent origin.
He had conceived it when first the wife of the
Englishman had fallen into the hands of Achmet Zek; but
while that austere chieftain lived, Mohammed Beyd had
not even dared hope for a realization of his
imaginings.
<P>
Now, though, it was different--only a despised dog of a
Christian stood between himself and possession of the
girl.  How easy it would be to slay the unbeliever, and
take unto himself both the woman and the jewels!  With
the latter in his possession, the ransom which might be
obtained for the captive would form no great inducement
to her relinquishment in the face of the pleasures of
sole ownership of her.  Yes, he would kill Werper,
retain all the jewels and keep the Englishwoman.
<P>
He turned his eyes upon her as she rode along at his
side.  How beautiful she was!  His fingers opened and
closed--skinny, brown talons itching to feel the soft
flesh of the victim in their remorseless clutch.
<P>
"Do you know," he asked leaning toward her, "where this
man would take you?"
<P>
Jane Clayton nodded affirmatively.
<P>
"And you are willing to become the plaything of a black
sultan?"
<P>
The girl drew herself up to her full height, and turned
her head away; but she did not reply.  She feared lest
her knowledge of the ruse that M. Frecoult was playing
upon the Arab might cause her to betray herself through
an insufficient display of terror and aversion.
<P>
"You can escape this fate," continued the Arab;
"Mohammed Beyd will save you," and he reached out a
brown hand and seized the fingers of her right hand in
a grasp so sudden and so fierce that this brutal
passion was revealed as clearly in the act as though
his lips had confessed it in words. Jane Clayton
wrenched herself from his grasp.
<P>
"You beast!" she cried.  "Leave me or I shall call M.
Frecoult."
<P>
Mohammed Beyd drew back with a scowl.  His thin, upper
lip curled upward, revealing his smooth, white teeth.
<P>
"M. Frecoult?" he jeered.  "There is no such person.
The man's name is Werper.  He is a liar, a thief, and a
murderer.  He killed his captain in the Congo country
and fled to the protection of Achmet Zek.  He led
Achmet Zek to the plunder of your home.  He followed
your husband, and planned to steal his gold from him.
He has told me that you think him your protector, and
he has played upon this to win your confidence that it
might be easier to carry you north and sell you into
some black sultan's harem.  Mohammed Beyd is your only
hope," and with this assertion to provide the captive
with food for thought, the Arab spurred forward toward
the head of the column.
<P>
Jane Clayton could not know how much of Mohammed Beyd's
indictment might be true, or how much false; but at
least it had the effect of dampening her hopes and
causing her to review with suspicion every past act of
the man upon whom she had been looking as her sole
protector in the midst of a world of enemies and
dangers.
<P>
On the march a separate tent had been provided for the
captive, and at night it was pitched between those of
Mohammed Beyd and Werper.  A sentry was posted at the
front and another at the back, and with these
precautions it had not been thought necessary to
confine the prisoner to bonds.  The evening following
her interview with Mohammed Beyd, Jane Clayton sat for
some time at the opening of her tent watching the rough
activities of the camp.  She had eaten the meal that
had been brought her by Mohammed Beyd's Negro slave--a
meal of cassava cakes and a nondescript stew in which a
new-killed monkey, a couple of squirrels and the
remains of a zebra, slain the previous day, were
impartially and unsavorily combined; but the one-time
Baltimore belle had long since submerged in the stern
battle for existence, an estheticism which formerly
revolted at much slighter provocation.
<P>
As the girl's eyes wandered across the trampled jungle
clearing, already squalid from the presence of man, she
no longer apprehended either the nearer objects of the
foreground, the uncouth men laughing or quarreling
among themselves, or the jungle beyond, which
circumscribed the extreme range of her material vision.
Her gaze passed through all these, unseeing, to center
itself upon a distant bungalow and scenes of happy
security which brought to her eyes tears of mingled joy
and sorrow.  She saw a tall, broad-shouldered man
riding in from distant fields; she saw herself waiting
to greet him with an armful of fresh-cut roses from the
bushes which flanked the little rustic gate before her.
All this was gone, vanished into the past, wiped out by
the torches and bullets and hatred of these hideous and
degenerate men.  With a stifled sob, and a little
shudder, Jane Clayton turned back into her tent and
sought the pile of unclean blankets which were her bed.
Throwing herself face downward upon them she sobbed
forth her misery until kindly sleep brought her, at
least temporary, relief.
<P>
And while she slept a figure stole from the tent that
stood to the right of hers.  It approached the sentry
before the doorway and whispered a few words in the
man's ear.  The latter nodded, and strode off through
the darkness in the direction of his own blankets.
The figure passed to the rear of Jane Clayton's tent
and spoke again to the sentry there, and this man also
left, following in the trail of the first.
<P>
Then he who had sent them away stole silently to the
tent flap and untying the fastenings entered with the
noiselessness of a disembodied spirit.
