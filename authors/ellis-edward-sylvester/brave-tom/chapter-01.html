<p>On a certain summer day, a few years ago, the little village
of Briggsville, in Pennsylvania, was thrown into a state of excitement,
the like of which was never known since the fearful night, a hundred
years before, when a band of red men descended like a cyclone
upon the little hamlet with its block-house, and left barely a
dozen settlers alive to tell the story of the visitation to their
descendants.</p>

<p>Tom Gordon lived a mile from Briggsville with his widowed mother
and his Aunt Cynthia, a sister to his father, who had died five
years before.</p>

<p>The boy had no brother or sister; and as he was bright, truthful,
good-tempered, quick of perception, and obedient, it can be well
understood that he was the pride and hope of his mother and aunt,
whose circumstances were of the humblest nature. He attended the
village school, where he was the most popular and promising of
the threescore pupils under the care of the crabbed Mr. Jenkins.
He was as active of body as mind, and took the lead among boys
of his own age in athletic sports and feats of dexterity.</p>

<p>One summer day the village of Briggsville blazed out in black
and red and white, every available space being covered with immense
posters, which in flaming scenes and gigantic type announced the
coming of "Jones's &amp; Co.'s Great Moral Menagerie and Transcontinental
Circus, on its triumphal tour through the United States and Canada."</p>

<p>Naturally a tremendous excitement set in among the boys, who
began hoarding their pennies and behaving with supernatural propriety,
so that nothing should interfere with the treat, which in exquisite
enjoyment can never be equaled by anything that could come to
them in after-life.</p>

<p>Tom Gordon had never yet seen the inside of a circus and menagerie;
and as his mother promised him that the enjoyment should be his,
it is impossible to describe his state of mind for the days and
nights preceding the visit of the grand aggregation, the like
of which (according to the overwhelming posters) the world had
never known before. He studied the enormous pictures, with their
tigers, bears, leopards, and panthers, the size of a meeting-house;
their elephants of mountainous proportions, and the daring acrobats,
contortionists, and performers, whose feats made one hold one's
breath while gazing in awe at their impossible performances. The
lad dreamed of them at night, talked about them through the day,
and discussed with his most intimate friends the project of forming
a circus of their own when they became bigger and older. The latter
project, it may be added, owing to unforeseen obstacles, never
assumed definite form.</p>

<p>But alas! this is a world of disappointment. On the morning of
the circus Tom was seized with a violent chill, which almost shook
him out of his shoes. He tried with might and main to master it;
for he well knew that if he did not, his visit to the wonderful
show must be postponed indefinitely. He strove like a hero, and
was actually sick several hours before the watchful eyes of his
mother and aunt discovered his plight. The moment came when he
could hold out no longer, with his teeth rattling like castanets,
and his red face so hot that it was painful to the touch. Since
the performance did not open until two o'clock in the afternoon,
he did not as yet abandon all hope.</p>

<p>His mother and aunt sympathized with him; but although he rallied
to a great extent from his illness, they could not give consent
for him to leave the house. He partook of refreshment, and left
his bed at noon. At two o'clock he was able to sit in the chair
by the window, with his fever greatly abated, and an hour later
he was as free from all traces of the ague as you or I.</p>

<p>But it was then too late to go to the circus. The disappointment
was a sore one, but the lad stood it like the really brave fellow
he was. He swallowed the lump in his throat, and smiled as he
said to his aunt,&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the circus comes again, I don't think I'll have a chill."</p>

<p>"And you shall see it, if you are alive then,&mdash;of that be assured."</p>

<p>The day was one of the most pleasant and balmy of the season,
and Tom walked out of the house, leaned on the gate, and looked
up and down the highway.</p>

<p>Suddenly he observed a span of horses coming on a gallop, while
the driver of the open wagon was lashing them with his whip and
urging them to still greater speed.</p>

<p>"They aren't running away," mused the astonished boy; "for, if
they were, the man wouldn't be trying to make them run faster.
It's Mr. MacDowell! I never saw him drive faster than a walk before;
something dreadful must have happened."</p>

<p>As Mr. MacDowell caught sight of the boy, and came opposite,
he shouted something, and with an expression of terror glanced
around and pointed with his whip behind him. The furious rattle
of the wagon prevented Tom's catching the words, and the terrified
farmer did not repeat them, but lashed his team harder than ever,
vanishing in a cloud of dust raised by his own wheels.</p>

<p>"He must be crazy," said Tom, unable to think of any other explanation
of the old man's frantic behavior.</p>

<p>The lad stood with his head turned toward the cloud of dust,
wondering and speculating over the strange affair, when hurried
footsteps caused him to turn quickly and look again in the direction
of the village.</p>

<p>This time it was Jim Travers, who was panting from his running,
and whose face was a picture of consternation, equal to that of
Farmer MacDowell.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Jim?" asked Tom as his schoolmate reached
him.</p>

<p>"O Tom, ain't it awful?" gasped the new arrival, coming to a
halt, still panting, and casting affrighted glances in the direction
of Briggsville.</p>

<p>"Ain't <em>what</em> awful?"</p>

<p>"Gracious! hain't you heard the news? I thought everybody knowed
it."</p>

<p>And the tired boy took off his hat and rubbed his sleeve across
his steaming forehead, as though his expression of surprise at
Tom's ignorance communicated of itself the news to him. Tom, as
may be supposed, was on needles; for, as yet, he had not received
the first hint of the occurrence, which certainly must have been
of a stirring nature.</p>

<p>"Sam Harper, Jack Habersham, and Bill Dunham&mdash;<em>all killed</em>
before any one could help 'em! Did you ever hear of anything like
it?" continued Jim.</p>

<p>"I haven't heard of <em>that</em> yet. I don't know what you're
talking about, Jim; if you can't tell me, why, shut up!"</p>

<p>"So you hain't heard the news? I forgot; it scared me almost
to death. I thought everybody knowed it. I must hurry home."</p>

<p>And the bewildered youngster was on the point of dashing off
again, after partially recovering his wind, when he seemed to
awaken to the fact that he owed something in the way of enlightenment
to his friend.</p>

<p>"I forgot, Tom; but I did think you knowed it: guess you're the
only boy in a thousand miles that hain't heard of it. Well, you
see the way of it was this: there was the biggest crowd I ever
seed at the circus,&mdash;don't believe any other circus in the country
ever had so many people there. Everything was going 'long all
right, when what did Sam Harper do, but reach out with a stick
and punch it in the eye of the tiger, Tippo Sahib? The minute
he done it, the tiger let out a yell that you would have heerd
a mile off, and, afore Sam could get out of the way, the tiger
smashed right out of the cage and was among the people, chawing
them up. He had his well eye on Sam, and crushed his head like
an eggshell, with one bite! Then he made a sweep with his paw,
and knocked Jack Habersham clean out the tent. He must have gone
a hundred feet through the air, for he come down on top of the
steeple, and is there yet with the spire sticking up through him.
Then he hit Bill Dunham such a clip that he sailed out through
the same hole in the tent that Jack passed through. When I left,
Bill hadn't been seed by anybody. Guess he hasn't come down yet.</p>

<p>"Then the tiger come for <em>me</em>!</p>

<p>"I seen him make a spring, and ducked my head. He went clean
over, and landed among the women and children, and begun chawing
'em up. Why, Tom, the sound of their bones cracking and snapping
in his jaws was like the fire-crackers going off on the Fourth
of July. Them as warn't swallered or killed scattered right and
left, and begun climbing trees, jumping through winders, and fastening
the doors. All this time the tiger kept on chawing. He never took
more than one bite at a man!"</p>

<p>"Did you see him kill any one?" asked the scared Tom, somewhat
confused by the tremendous narrative of his friend.</p>

<p>"Did I see him kill any one? I should say I did. I seed him kill
more than forty!"</p>

<p>"Did he eat 'em all?"</p>

<p>"Of course he did! That is, all but their boots and shoes. He
don't seem to like leather," added Jim thoughtfully; "for I noticed
that when the men were going down his throat, he kind of shet
his jaws, so as to slip off their boots."</p>

<p>"Jim, he must be a big tiger to hold so many folks inside of
him."</p>

<p>"Course he is! The biggest that was ever catched in Greenland!
He didn't not only swaller the men and boys and women that I'm
telling you 'bout, but he took in horses, cows, dogs, and anything
in his way. If I ain't mistook, he swallered Mr. MacDowell's two
horses with him."</p>

<p>"No, he didn't; for they went by a few minutes ago. But, Jim,
what makes you in such a hurry?"</p>

<p>"I'm trying to get away from Tippo Sahib," replied the frightened
lad, glancing furtively again toward the village.</p>

<p>"Where's the tiger now?"</p>

<p>"He ain't fur off, and," added Jim, speaking the truth this time,
"<em>the tiger's coming this way, and will soon be here</em>."</p>
