<p>
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pursued it with forks and hope;<br/>
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They charmed it with smiles and soap.

</p>
<p>
And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was matter for general remark,<br/>
Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his zeal to discover the Snark

</p>
<p>
But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh<br/>
And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he knew it was useless to fly.

</p>
<p>
He offered large discount&mdash;he offered a cheque<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Drawn "to bearer") for seven-pounds-ten:<br/>
But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grabbed at the Banker again.

</p>
<p>
Without rest or pause&mdash;while those frumious jaws<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went savagely snapping around&mdash;<br/>
He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till fainting he fell to the ground.

</p>
<p>
The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led on by that fear-stricken yell:<br/>
And the Bellman remarked "It is just as I feared!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And solemnly tolled on his bell.

</p>
<p>
He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The least likeness to what he had been:<br/>
While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wonderful thing to be seen!

</p>
<p>
To the horror of all who were present that day.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He uprose in full evening dress,<br/>
And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What his tongue could no longer express.

</p>
<p>
Down he sank in a chair&mdash;ran his hands through his hair&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chanted in mimsiest tones<br/>
Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he rattled a couple of bones.

</p>
<p>
"Leave him here to his fate&mdash;it is getting so late!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.<br/>
"We have lost half the day.  Any further delay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we shaâ€™nt catch a Snark before night!"<br/>
