<p> The West Wind reigns over the seas surrounding the coasts of
these kingdoms; and from the gateways of the channels, from promontories
as if from watch-towers, from estuaries of rivers as if from postern
gates, from passage-ways, inlets, straits, firths, the garrison
of the Isle and the crews of the ships going and returning look
to the westward to judge by the varied splendours of his sunset
mantle the mood of that arbitrary ruler.  The end of the day is
the time to gaze at the kingly face of the Westerly Weather, who
is the arbiter of ships’ destinies.  Benignant and splendid, or
splendid and sinister, the western sky reflects the hidden purposes
of the royal mind.  Clothed in a mantle of dazzling gold or draped
in rags of black clouds like a beggar, the might of the Westerly
Wind sits enthroned upon the western horizon with the whole North
Atlantic as a footstool for his feet and the first twinkling stars
making a diadem for his brow.  Then the seamen, attentive courtiers
of the weather, think of regulating the conduct of their ships
by the mood of the master.  The West Wind is too great a king
to be a dissembler: he is no calculator plotting deep schemes
in a sombre heart; he is too strong for small artifices; there
is passion in all his moods, even in the soft mood of his serene
days, in the grace of his blue sky whose immense and unfathomable
tenderness reflected in the mirror of the sea embraces, possesses,
lulls to sleep the ships with white sails.  He is all things to
all oceans; he is like a poet seated upon a throne—magnificent,
simple, barbarous, pensive, generous, impulsive, changeable, unfathomable—but
when you understand him, always the same.  Some of his sunsets
are like pageants devised for the delight of the multitude, when
all the gems of the royal treasure-house are displayed above the
sea. Others are like the opening of his royal confidence, tinged
with thoughts of sadness and compassion in a melancholy splendour
meditating upon the short-lived peace of the waters.  And I have
seen him put the pent-up anger of his heart into the aspect of
the inaccessible sun, and cause it to glare fiercely like the
eye of an implacable autocrat out of a pale and frightened sky.</p>

<p>He is the war-lord who sends his battalions of Atlantic rollers
to the assault of our seaboard.  The compelling voice of the West
Wind musters up to his service all the might of the ocean.  At
the bidding of the West Wind there arises a great commotion in
the sky above these Islands, and a great rush of waters falls
upon our shores.  The sky of the westerly weather is full of flying
clouds, of great big white clouds coming thicker and thicker till
they seem to stand welded into a solid canopy, upon whose gray
face the lower wrack of the gale, thin, black and angry-looking,
flies past with vertiginous speed.  Denser and denser grows this
dome of vapours, descending lower and lower upon the sea, narrowing
the horizon around the ship.  And the characteristic aspect of
westerly weather, the thick, gray, smoky and sinister tone sets
in, circumscribing the view of the men, drenching their bodies,
oppressing their souls, taking their breath away with booming
gusts, deafening, blinding, driving, rushing them onwards in a
swaying ship towards our coasts lost in mists and rain.</p>

<p>The caprice of the winds, like the wilfulness of men, is fraught
with the disastrous consequences of self-indulgence.  Long anger,
the sense of his uncontrolled power, spoils the frank and generous
nature of the West Wind.  It is as if his heart were corrupted
by a malevolent and brooding rancour.  He devastates his own kingdom
in the wantonness of his force. South-west is the quarter of the
heavens where he presents his darkened brow.  He breathes his
rage in terrific squalls, and overwhelms his realm with an inexhaustible
welter of clouds.  He strews the seeds of anxiety upon the decks
of scudding ships, makes the foam-stripped ocean look old, and
sprinkles with gray hairs the heads of ship-masters in the homeward-bound
ships running for the Channel.  The Westerly Wind asserting his
sway from the south-west quarter is often like a monarch gone
mad, driving forth with wild imprecations the most faithful of
his courtiers to shipwreck, disaster, and death.</p>

<p>The south-westerly weather is the thick weather <em>par excellence</em>. 
It is not the thickness of the fog; it is rather a contraction
of the horizon, a mysterious veiling of the shores with clouds
that seem to make a low-vaulted dungeon around the running ship. 
It is not blindness; it is a shortening of the sight.  The West
Wind does not say to the seaman, "You shall be blind"; it restricts
merely the range of his vision and raises the dread of land within
his breast.  It makes of him a man robbed of half his force, of
half his efficiency.  Many times in my life, standing in long
sea-boots and streaming oilskins at the elbow of my commander
on the poop of a homeward-bound ship making for the Channel, and
gazing ahead into the gray and tormented waste, I have heard a
weary sigh shape itself into a studiously casual comment:</p>

<p>"Can’t see very far in this weather."</p>

<p>And have made answer in the same low, perfunctory tone</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>It would be merely the instinctive voicing of an ever-present
thought associated closely with the consciousness of the land
somewhere ahead and of the great speed of the ship.  Fair wind,
fair wind!  Who would dare to grumble at a fair wind?  It was
a favour of the Western King, who rules masterfully the North
Atlantic from the latitude of the Azores to the latitude of Cape
Farewell.  A famous shove this to end a good passage with; and
yet, somehow, one could not muster upon one’s lips the smile of
a courtier’s gratitude.  This favour was dispensed to you from
under an overbearing scowl, which is the true expression of the
great autocrat when he has made up his mind to give a battering
to some ships and to hunt certain others home in one breath of
cruelty and benevolence, equally distracting.</p>

<p>"No, sir.  Can’t see very far."</p>

<p>Thus would the mate’s voice repeat the thought of the master,
both gazing ahead, while under their feet the ship rushes at some
twelve knots in the direction of the lee shore; and only a couple
of miles in front of her swinging and dripping jib-boom, carried
naked with an upward slant like a spear, a gray horizon closes
the view with a multitude of waves surging upwards violently as
if to strike at the stooping clouds.</p>

<p>Awful and threatening scowls darken the face of the West Wind
in his clouded, south-west mood; and from the King’s throne-hall
in the western board stronger gusts reach you, like the fierce
shouts of raving fury to which only the gloomy grandeur of the
scene imparts a saving dignity.  A shower pelts the deck and the
sails of the ship as if flung with a scream by an angry hand;
and when the night closes in, the night of a south-westerly gale,
it seems more hopeless than the shade of Hades.  The south-westerly
mood of the great West Wind is a lightless mood, without sun,
moon, or stars, with no gleam of light but the phosphorescent
flashes of the great sheets of foam that, boiling up on each side
of the ship, fling bluish gleams upon her dark and narrow hull,
rolling as she runs, chased by enormous seas, distracted in the
tumult.</p>

<p>There are some bad nights in the kingdom of the West Wind for
homeward-bound ships making for the Channel; and the days of wrath
dawn upon them colourless and vague like the timid turning up
of invisible lights upon the scene of a tyrannical and passionate
outbreak, awful in the monotony of its method and the increasing
strength of its violence. It is the same wind, the same clouds,
the same wildly racing seas, the same thick horizon around the
ship.  Only the wind is stronger, the clouds seem denser and more
overwhelming, the waves appear to have grown bigger and more threatening
during the night.  The hours, whose minutes are marked by the
crash of the breaking seas, slip by with the screaming, pelting
squalls overtaking the ship as she runs on and on with darkened
canvas, with streaming spars and dripping ropes.  The down-pours
thicken. Preceding each shower a mysterious gloom, like the passage
of a shadow above the firmament of gray clouds, filters down upon
the ship.  Now and then the rain pours upon your head in streams
as if from spouts.  It seems as if your ship were going to be
drowned before she sank, as if all atmosphere had turned to water. 
You gasp, you splutter, you are blinded and deafened, you are
submerged, obliterated, dissolved, annihilated, streaming all
over as if your limbs, too, had turned to water.  And every nerve
on the alert you watch for the clearing-up mood of the Western
King, that shall come with a shift of wind as likely as not to
whip all the three masts out of your ship in the twinkling of
an eye.</p>
