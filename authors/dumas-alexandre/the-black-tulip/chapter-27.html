<P>Boxtel's return was scarcely announced, when he entered in 
person the drawing-room of Mynheer van Systens, followed by 
two men, who carried in a box their precious burden and 
deposited it on a table.</P>
<P>The Prince, on being informed, left the cabinet, passed into 
the drawing-room, admired the flower, and silently resumed 
his seat in the dark corner, where he had himself placed his 
chair.</P>
<P>Rosa, trembling, pale and terrified, expected to be invited 
in her turn to see the tulip.</P>
<P>She now heard the voice of Boxtel.</P>
<P>&quot;It is he!&quot; she exclaimed.</P>
<P>The Prince made her a sign to go and look through the open 
door into the drawing-room.</P>
<P>&quot;It is my tulip,&quot; cried Rosa, &quot;I recognise it. Oh, my poor 
Cornelius!&quot;</P>
<P>And saying this she burst into tears.</P>
<P>The Prince rose from his seat, went to the door, where he 
stood for some time with the full light falling upon his 
figure.</P>
<P>As Rosa's eyes now rested upon him, she felt more than ever 
convinced that this was not the first time she had seen the 
stranger.</P>
<P>&quot;Master Boxtel,&quot; said the Prince, &quot;come in here, if you 
please.&quot;</P>
<P>Boxtel eagerly approached, and, finding himself face to face 
with William of Orange, started back.</P>
<P>&quot;His Highness!&quot; he called out.</P>
<P>&quot;His Highness!&quot; Rosa repeated in dismay.</P>
<P>Hearing this exclamation on his left, Boxtel turned round, 
and perceived Rosa.</P>
<P>At this sight the whole frame of the thief shook as if under 
the influence of a galvanic shock.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; muttered the Prince to himself, &quot;he is confused.&quot;</P>
<P>But Boxtel, making a violent effort to control his feelings, 
was already himself again.</P>
<P>&quot;Master Boxtel,&quot; said William, &quot;you seem to have discovered 
the secret of growing the black tulip?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, your Highness,&quot; answered Boxtel, in a voice which 
still betrayed some confusion.</P>
<P>It is true his agitation might have been attributable to the 
emotion which the man must have felt on suddenly recognising 
the Prince.</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; continued the Stadtholder, &quot;here is a young damsel 
who also pretends to have found it.&quot;</P>
<P>Boxtel, with a disdainful smile, shrugged his shoulders.</P>
<P>William watched all his movements with evident interest and 
curiosity.</P>
<P>&quot;Then you don't know this young girl?&quot; said the Prince.</P>
<P>&quot;No, your Highness!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you, child, do you know Master Boxtel?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, I don't know Master Boxtel, but I know Master Jacob.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I mean to say that at Loewestein the man who here calls 
himself Isaac Boxtel went by the name of Master Jacob.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you say to that, Master Boxtel?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I say that this damsel lies, your Highness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You deny, therefore, having ever been at Loewestein?&quot;</P>
<P>Boxtel hesitated; the fixed and searching glance of the 
proud eye of the Prince prevented him from lying.</P>
<P>&quot;I cannot deny having been at Loewestein, your Highness, but 
I deny having stolen the tulip.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You have stolen it, and that from my room,&quot; cried Rosa, 
with indignation.</P>
<P>&quot;I deny it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now listen to me. Do you deny having followed me into the 
garden, on the day when I prepared the border where I was to 
plant it? Do you deny having followed me into the garden 
when I pretended to plant it? Do you deny that, on that 
evening, you rushed after my departure to the spot where you 
hoped to find the bulb? Do you deny having dug in the ground 
with your hands  -  but, thank God! in vain, as it was a 
stratagem to discover your intentions. Say, do you deny all 
this?&quot;</P>
<P>Boxtel did not deem it fit to answer these several charges, 
but, turning to the Prince, continued,  - </P>
<P>&quot;I have now for twenty years grown tulips at Dort. I have 
even acquired some reputation in this art; one of my hybrids 
is entered in the catalogue under the name of an illustrious 
personage. I have dedicated it to the King of Portugal. The 
truth in the matter is as I shall now tell your Highness. 
This damsel knew that I had produced the black tulip, and, 
in concert with a lover of hers in the fortress of 
Loewestein, she formed the plan of ruining me by 
appropriating to herself the prize of a hundred thousand 
guilders, which, with the help of your Highness's justice, I 
hope to gain.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yah!&quot; cried Rosa, beyond herself with anger.</P>
<P>&quot;Silence!&quot; said the Prince.</P>
<P>Then, turning to Boxtel, he said,  - </P>
<P>&quot;And who is that prisoner to whom you allude as the lover of 
this young woman?&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa nearly swooned, for Cornelius was designated as a 
dangerous prisoner, and recommended by the Prince to the 
especial surveillance of the jailer.</P>
<P>Nothing could have been more agreeable to Boxtel than this 
question.</P>
<P>&quot;This prisoner,&quot; he said, &quot;is a man whose name in itself 
will prove to your Highness what trust you may place in his 
probity. He is a prisoner of state, who was once condemned 
to death.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And his name?&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa hid her face in her hands with a movement of despair.</P>
<P>&quot;His name is Cornelius van Baerle,&quot; said Boxtel, &quot;and he is 
godson of that villain Cornelius de Witt.&quot;</P>
<P>The Prince gave a start, his generally quiet eye flashed, 
and a death-like paleness spread over his impassible 
features.</P>
<P>He went up to Rosa, and with his finger, gave her a sign to 
remove her hands from her face.</P>
<P>Rosa obeyed, as if under mesmeric influence, without having 
seen the sign.</P>
<P>&quot;It was, then to follow this man that you came to me at 
Leyden to solicit for the transfer of your father?&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa hung down her head, and, nearly choking, said,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Yes, your Highness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go on,&quot; said the Prince to Boxtel.</P>
<P>&quot;I have nothing more to say,&quot; Isaac continued. &quot;Your 
Highness knows all. But there is one thing which I did not 
intend to say, because I did not wish to make this girl 
blush for her ingratitude. I came to Loewestein because I 
had business there. On this occasion I made the acquaintance 
of old Gryphus, and, falling in love with his daughter, made 
an offer of marriage to her; and, not being rich, I 
committed the imprudence of mentioning to them my prospect 
of gaining a hundred thousand guilders, in proof of which I 
showed to them the black tulip. Her lover having himself 
made a show at Dort of cultivating tulips to hide his 
political intrigues, they now plotted together for my ruin. 
On the eve of the day when the flower was expected to open, 
the tulip was taken away by this young woman. She carried it 
to her room, from which I had the good luck to recover it at 
the very moment when she had the impudence to despatch a 
messenger to announce to the members of the Horticultural 
Society that she had produced the grand black tulip. But she 
did not stop there. There is no doubt that, during the few 
hours which she kept the flower in her room, she showed it 
to some persons whom she may now call as witnesses. But, 
fortunately, your Highness has now been warned against this 
impostor and her witnesses.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, my God, my God! what infamous falsehoods!&quot; said Rosa, 
bursting into tears, and throwing herself at the feet of the 
Stadtholder, who, although thinking her guilty, felt pity 
for her dreadful agony.</P>
<P>&quot;You have done very wrong, my child,&quot; he said, &quot;and your 
lover shall be punished for having thus badly advised you. 
For you are so young, and have such an honest look, that I 
am inclined to believe the mischief to have been his doing, 
and not yours.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monseigneur! Monseigneur!&quot; cried Rosa, &quot;Cornelius is not 
guilty.&quot;</P>
<P>William started.</P>
<P>&quot;Not guilty of having advised you? that's what you want to 
say, is it not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What I wish to say, your Highness, is that Cornelius is as 
little guilty of the second crime imputed to him as he was 
of the first.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of the first? And do you know what was his first crime? Do 
you know of what he was accused and convicted? Of having, as 
an accomplice of Cornelius de Witt, concealed the 
correspondence of the Grand Pensionary and the Marquis de 
Louvois.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, sir, he was ignorant of this correspondence being 
deposited with him; completely ignorant. I am as certain as 
of my life, that, if it were not so, he would have told me; 
for how could that pure mind have harboured a secret without 
revealing it to me? No, no, your Highness, I repeat it, and 
even at the risk of incurring your displeasure, Cornelius is 
no more guilty of the first crime than of the second; and of 
the second no more than of the first. Oh, would to Heaven 
that you knew my Cornelius; Monseigneur!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He is a De Witt!&quot; cried Boxtel. &quot;His Highness knows only 
too much of him, having once granted him his life.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Silence!&quot; said the Prince; &quot;all these affairs of state, as 
I have already said, are completely out of the province of 
the Horticultural Society of Haarlem.&quot;</P>
<P>Then, knitting his brow, he added,  - </P>
<P>&quot;As to the tulip, make yourself easy, Master Boxtel, you 
shall have justice done to you.&quot;</P>
<P>Boxtel bowed with a heart full of joy, and received the 
congratulations of the President.</P>
<P>&quot;You, my child,&quot; William of Orange continued, &quot;you were 
going to commit a crime. I will not punish you; but the real 
evil-doer shall pay the penalty for both. A man of his name 
may be a conspirator, and even a traitor, but he ought not 
to be a thief.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A thief!&quot; cried Rosa. &quot;Cornelius a thief? Pray, your 
Highness, do not say such a word, it would kill him, if he 
knew it. If theft there has been, I swear to you, Sir, no 
one else but this man has committed it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Prove it,&quot; Boxtel coolly remarked.</P>
<P>&quot;I shall prove it. With God's help I shall.&quot;</P>
<P>Then, turning towards Boxtel, she asked,  - </P>
<P>&quot;The tulip is yours?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How many bulbs were there of it?&quot;</P>
<P>Boxtel hesitated for a moment, but after a short 
consideration he came to the conclusion that she would not 
ask this question if there were none besides the two bulbs 
of which he had known already. He therefore answered,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Three.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What has become of these bulbs?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! what has become of them? Well, one has failed; the 
second has produced the black tulip.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And the third?</P>
<P>&quot;The third!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The third,  -  where is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have it at home,&quot; said Boxtel, quite confused.</P>
<P>&quot;At home? Where? At Loewestein, or at Dort?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At Dort,&quot; said Boxtel.</P>
<P>&quot;You lie!&quot; cried Rosa. &quot;Monseigneur,&quot; she continued, whilst 
turning round to the Prince, &quot;I will tell you the true story 
of these three bulbs. The first was crushed by my father in 
the prisoner's cell, and this man is quite aware of it, for 
he himself wanted to get hold of it, and, being balked in 
his hope, he very nearly fell out with my father, who had 
been the cause of his disappointment. The second bulb, 
planted by me, has produced the black tulip, and the third 
and last&quot;  -  saying this, she drew it from her bosom  -  
&quot;here it is, in the very same paper in which it was wrapped 
up together with the two others. When about to be led to the 
scaffold, Cornelius van Baerle gave me all the three. Take 
it, Monseigneur, take it.&quot;</P>
<P>And Rosa, unfolding the paper, offered the bulb to the 
Prince, who took it from her hands and examined it.</P>
<P>&quot;But, Monseigneur, this young woman may have stolen the 
bulb, as she did the tulip,&quot; Boxtel said, with a faltering 
voice, and evidently alarmed at the attention with which the 
Prince examined the bulb; and even more at the movements of 
Rosa, who was reading some lines written on the paper which 
remained in her hands.</P>
<P>Her eyes suddenly lighted up; she read, with breathless 
anxiety, the mysterious paper over and over again; and at 
last, uttering a cry, held it out to the Prince and said, 
&quot;Read, Monseigneur, for Heaven's sake, read!&quot;</P>
<P>William handed the third bulb to Van Systens, took the 
paper, and read.</P>
<P>No sooner had he looked at it than he began to stagger; his 
hand trembled, and very nearly let the paper fall to the 
ground; and the expression of pain and compassion in his 
features was really frightful to see.</P>
<P>It was that fly-leaf, taken from the Bible, which Cornelius 
de Witt had sent to Dort by Craeke, the servant of his 
brother John, to request Van Baerle to burn the 
correspondence of the Grand Pensionary with the Marquis de 
Louvois.</P>
<P>This request, as the reader may remember, was couched in the 
following terms:  - </P>
<P>&quot;My Dear Godson,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Burn the parcel which I have intrusted to you. Burn it 
without looking at it, and without opening it, so that its 
contents may for ever remain unknown to yourself. Secrets of 
this description are death to those with whom they are 
deposited. Burn it, and you will have saved John and 
Cornelius de Witt.</P>
<P>&quot;Farewell, and love me.</P>
<P>Cornelius de Witt.</P>
<P>&quot;August 20, 1672.&quot;</P>
<P>This slip of paper offered the proofs both of Van Baerle's 
innocence and of his claim to the property of the tulip.</P>
<P>Rosa and the Stadtholder exchanged one look only.</P>
<P>That of Rosa was meant to express, &quot;Here, you see yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>That of the Stadtholder signified, &quot;Be quiet, and wait.&quot;</P>
<P>The Prince wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, and 
slowly folded up the paper, whilst his thoughts were 
wandering in that labyrinth without a goal and without a 
guide, which is called remorse and shame for the past.</P>
<P>Soon, however, raising his head with an effort, he said, in 
his usual voice,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Go, Mr. Boxtel; justice shall be done, I promise you.&quot;</P>
<P>Then, turning to the President, he added,  - </P>
<P>&quot;You, my dear Mynheer van Systens, take charge of this young 
woman and of the tulip. Good-bye.&quot;</P>
<P>All bowed, and the Prince left, among the deafening cheers 
of the crowd outside.</P>
<P>Boxtel returned to his inn, rather puzzled and uneasy, 
tormented by misgivings about that paper which William had 
received from the hand of Rosa, and which his Highness had 
read, folded up, and so carefully put in his pocket. What 
was the meaning of all this?</P>
<P>Rosa went up to the tulip, tenderly kissed its leaves and, 
with a heart full of happiness and confidence in the ways of 
God, broke out in the words,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Thou knowest best for what end Thou madest my good 
Cornelius teach me to read.&quot; </P></article>
