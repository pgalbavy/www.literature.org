<p>IT was a sight that some people remembered better even than their
own sorrows - the sight in that grey clear morning, when the fatal
cart with the two young women in it was descried by the waiting
watching multitude, cleaving its way towards the hideous symbol of
a deliberately inflicted sudden death.</p>

<p>All Stoniton had heard of Dinah Morris, the young Methodist woman
who had brought the obstinate criminal to confess, and there was
as much eagerness to see her as to see the wretched Hetty.</p>

<p>But Dinah was hardly conscious of the multitude.  When Hetty had
caught sight of the vast crowd in the distance, she had clutched
Dinah convulsively.</p>

<p>&quot;Close your eyes, Hetty,&quot; Dinah said, &quot;and let us pray without
ceasing to God.&quot;</p>

<p>And in a low voice, as the cart went slowly along through the
midst of the gazing crowd, she poured forth her soul with the
wrestling intensity of a last pleading, for the trembling creature
that clung to her and clutched her as the only visible sign of
love and pity.</p>

<p>Dinah did not know that the crowd was silent, gazing at her with a
sort of awe - she did not even know how near they were to the fatal
spot, when the cart stopped, and she shrank appalled at a loud
shout hideous to her ear, like a vast yell of demons.  Hetty's
shriek mingled with the sound, and they clasped each other in
mutual horror.</p>

<p>But it was not a shout of execration - not a yell of exultant
cruelty.</p>

<p>It was a shout of sudden excitement at the appearance of a
horseman cleaving the crowd at full gallop.  The horse is hot and
distressed, but answers to the desperate spurring; the rider looks
as if his eyes were glazed by madness, and he saw nothing but what
was unseen by others.  See, he has something in his hand - he is
holding it up as if it were a signal.</p>

<p>The Sheriff knows him: it is Arthur Donnithorne, carrying in his
hand a hard-won release from death.</p>
