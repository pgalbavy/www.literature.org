<p><em>THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER</em></p>

<p>
[<em>As given in the original edition</em>]
</p>

<p>The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us
on the mother’s side.  About three years ago, Mr. Gulliver growing
weary of the concourse of curious people coming to him at his
house in Redriff, made a small purchase of land, with a convenient
house, near Newark, in Nottinghamshire, his native country; where
he now lives retired, yet in good esteem among his neighbours.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from Oxfordshire;
to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at Banbury
in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.</p>

<p>Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should
think fit.  I have carefully perused them three times.  The style
is very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the
author, after the manner of travellers, is a little too circumstantial. 
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed
the author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became
a sort of proverb among his neighbours at Redriff, when any one
affirmed a thing, to say, it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had
spoken it.</p>

<p>By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the author’s
permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to send
them into the world, hoping they may be, at least for some time,
a better entertainment to our young noblemen, than the common
scribbles of politics and party.</p>

<p>This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had
not made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the
winds and tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in
the several voyages, together with the minute descriptions of
the management of the ship in storms, in the style of sailors;
likewise the account of longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have
reason to apprehend, that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied. 
But I was resolved to fit the work as much as possible to the
general capacity of readers.  However, if my own ignorance in
sea affairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes, I alone
am answerable for them.  And if any traveller hath a curiosity
to see the whole work at large, as it came from the hands of the
author, I will be ready to gratify him.</p>

<p>As for any further particulars relating to the author, the reader
will receive satisfaction from the first pages of the book.</p>

<em>RICHARD SYMPSON</em>
</p>
<p><em>A LETTER FROM CAPTAIN GULLIVER TO HIS COUSIN SYMPSON</em></p>

<p>
<em>WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1727</em>
</p>

<p>I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall
be called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed
on me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels,
with directions to hire some young gentleman of either university
to put them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier
did, by my advice, in his book called "A Voyage round the world." 
But I do not remember I gave you power to consent that any thing
should be omitted, and much less that any thing should be inserted;
therefore, as to the latter, I do here renounce every thing of
that kind; particularly a paragraph about her majesty Queen Anne,
of most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and
esteem her more than any of human species.  But you, or your interpolator,
ought to have considered, that it was not my inclination, so was
it not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my
master <em>Houyhnhnm</em>: And besides, the fact was altogether
false; for to my knowledge, being in England during some part
of her majesty’s reign, she did govern by a chief minister; nay
even by two successively, the first whereof was the lord of Godolphin,
and the second the lord of Oxford; so that you have made me say
the thing that was not.  Likewise in the account of the academy
of projectors, and several passages of my discourse to my master
<em>Houyhnhnm</em>, you have either omitted some material circumstances,
or minced or changed them in such a manner, that I do hardly know
my own work.  When I formerly hinted to you something of this
in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you were afraid of
giving offence; that people in power were very watchful over the
press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every thing
which looked like an <em>innuendo</em> (as I think you call it). 
But, pray how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and
at about five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be
applied to any of the <em>Yahoos</em>, who now are said to govern
the herd; especially at a time when I little thought, or feared,
the unhappiness of living under them?  Have not I the most reason
to complain, when I see these very <em>Yahoos</em> carried by
<em>Houyhnhnms</em> in a vehicle, as if they were brutes, and
those the rational creatures?  And indeed to avoid so monstrous
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement
hither.</p>

<p>Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,
and to the trust I reposed in you.</p>

<p>I do, in the next place, complain of my own great want of judgment,
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning
of you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer
my travels to be published.  Pray bring to your mind how often
I desired you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of
public good, that the <em>Yahoos</em> were a species of animals
utterly incapable of amendment by precept or example: and so it
has proved; for, instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses
and corruptions, at least in this little island, as I had reason
to expect; behold, after above six months warning, I cannot learn
that my book has produced one single effect according to my intentions. 
I desired you would let me know, by a letter, when party and faction
were extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest
and modest, with some tincture of common sense, and Smithfield
blazing with pyramids of law books; the young nobility’s education
entirely changed; the physicians banished; the female <em>Yahoos</em>
abounding in virtue, honour, truth, and good sense; courts and
levees of great ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit,
and learning rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and
verse condemned to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench
their thirst with their own ink.  These, and a thousand other
reformations, I firmly counted upon by your encouragement; as
indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered
in my book.  And it must be owned, that seven months were a sufficient
time to correct every vice and folly to which <em>Yahoos</em>
are subject, if their natures had been capable of the least disposition
to virtue or wisdom. Yet, so far have you been from answering
my expectation in any of your letters; that on the contrary you
are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys, and
reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself
accused of reflecting upon great state folk; of degrading human
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and
of abusing the female sex.  I find likewise that the writers of
those bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them
will not allow me to be the author of my own travels; and others
make me author of books to which I am wholly a stranger.</p>

<p>I find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to
confound the times, and mistake the dates, of my several voyages
and returns; neither assigning the true year, nor the true month,
nor day of the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all
destroyed since the publication of my book; neither have I any
copy left: however, I have sent you some corrections, which you
may insert, if ever there should be a second edition: and yet
I cannot stand to them; but shall leave that matter to my judicious
and candid readers to adjust it as they please.</p>

<p>I hear some of our sea <em>Yahoos</em> find fault with my sea-language,
as not proper in many parts, nor now in use.  I cannot help it. 
In my first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the
oldest mariners, and learned to speak as they did.  But I have
since found that the sea <em>Yahoos</em> are apt, like the land
ones, to become new-fangled in their words, which the latter change
every year; insomuch, as I remember upon each return to my own
country their old dialect was so altered, that I could hardly
understand the new.  And I observe, when any <em>Yahoo</em> comes
from London out of curiosity to visit me at my house, we neither
of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible
to the other.</p>

<p>If the censure of the <em>Yahoos</em> could any way affect me,
I should have great reason to complain, that some of them are
so bold as to think my book of travels a mere fiction out of mine
own brain, and have gone so far as to drop hints, that the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>
and <em>Yahoos</em> have no more existence than the inhabitants
of Utopia.</p>

<p>Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of <em>Lilliput</em>,
<em>Brobdingrag</em> (for so the word should have been spelt,
and not erroneously <em>Brobdingnag</em>), and <em>Laputa</em>,
I have never yet heard of any <em>Yahoo</em> so presumptuous as
to dispute their being, or the facts I have related concerning
them; because the truth immediately strikes every reader with
conviction.  And is there less probability in my account of the
<em>Houyhnhnms</em> or <em>Yahoos</em>, when it is manifest as
to the latter, there are so many thousands even in this country,
who only differ from their brother brutes in <em>Houyhnhnmland</em>,
because they use a sort of jabber, and do not go naked?  I wrote
for their amendment, and not their approbation. The united praise
of the whole race would be of less consequence to me, than the
neighing of those two degenerate <em>Houyhnhnms</em> I keep in
my stable; because from these, degenerate as they are, I still
improve in some virtues without any mixture of vice.</p>

<p>Do these miserable animals presume to think, that I am so degenerated
as to defend my veracity?  <em>Yahoo</em> as I am, it is well
known through all <em>Houyhnhnmland</em>, that, by the instructions
and example of my illustrious master, I was able in the compass
of two years (although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to
remove that infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and
equivocating, so deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species;
especially the Europeans.</p>

<p>I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion;
but I forbear troubling myself or you any further.  I must freely
confess, that since my last return, some corruptions of my <em>Yahoo</em>
nature have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species,
and particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity;
else I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that
of reforming the <em>Yahoo</em> race in this kingdom: But I have
now done with all such visionary schemes for ever.</p>
