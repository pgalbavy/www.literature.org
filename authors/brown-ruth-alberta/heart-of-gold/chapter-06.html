<p>"Peace, Peace, guess what's happened!"</p>

<p>Allee tore across the smooth, green lawn as if racing for her
life; and Cherry, following hard upon her heels, panted protestingly,
"I'm going to tell her. It's my right. I heard what he said first."</p>

<p>"I don't care if you did," retorted Allee. "I reached her chair
first. So now!"</p>

<p>It was just a week since Aunt Pen's visit to the President's
house, but already a remarkable change had come over the little
invalid in her wheel-chair prison. The dull indifference had disappeared
from the thin face, the hopeless look from the somber eyes; and
though there was still a sadly pathetic droop to the once merry
mouth, she seemed to have shaken off the deadly apathy which had
gripped her for so long, and to have taken a fresh hold upon life
again. True, it was hard work to smile and look happy with the
dreadful knowledge tugging at one's heart that one must be a helpless
cripple for the rest of her days, but the first smile had made
it easier for the second to come, and gradually the old merry
disposition came creeping back. Aunt Pen was right,&mdash;her real
self had only been in hiding, and with the lifting of the cloud
the sunshine of that gay spirit burst forth again.</p>

<p>She was tired of being idle, and with characteristic energy that
very morning had surprised and delighted the whole household by
demanding something to do,&mdash;some real work with which to fill
the long hours. And Miss Smiley had promptly suggested Indian
baskets, spending many precious minutes of a busy forenoon teaching
the weak fingers how to weave. Peace was a-tingle with pride over
her accomplishment, especially when she was told of its possibilities
and scope; and straightway began planning to send her first finished
product to the State Fair which was to open its gates soon.</p>

<p>So as she wrestled with the damp raffia sad willow sticks after
Miss Edith had left her, she so far forgot her trouble that the
old, familiar laugh bubbled up to her lips, and once she paused
in her work to answer a trilling bird in the branches overhead.
She was all alone on the wide, shady lawn, and so engrossed in
her own thoughts that she never heard the chug-chug of a motor-car
gliding up the river road, nor saw the black-frocked figure leap
nimbly from the machine and scurry up the walk to the kitchen
door, as if in too big a hurry to enter the house in the proper
manner. But she did hear the boisterous shouts of Cherry and Allee
a few moments later, as they burst through the screen door and
raced through the short, sweet clover toward her, each clamoring
to tell her the news which stuck out all over them.</p>

<p>"I reached her first!" Allee repeated, waving the older sister
off.</p>

<p>"Pig!" returned Cherry. "You always&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," interrupted a voice from behind, in tones of mock
severity. "Are you girls <em>quarreling</em>? I'm ashamed of you.
Peace, what is it all about?"</p>

<p>Mr. Strong, light of step and radiant of face, appeared on the
scene by another path; and Peace, flinging down the raffia basket
which her busy fingers were weaving, stretched out eager arms
in welcome. "It's something they both wanted to tell me, St. John,
but they stopped to scrap about it, and I hain't heard what it
is yet."</p>

<p>"Bet you meant to steal my thunder, didn't you?" He turned merry,
accusing eyes upon the pair of culprits, and they flushed guiltily.
"But you just aren't going to do it this time. <em>I</em> shall
tell her myself. It is my news, you know."</p>

<p>Both heads bobbed solemnly, and Peace, excited and not understanding,
cried imperiously, "Tell me quick. I'm half dead with curiosity.
Has old Tortoise-shell got some more kittens or &mdash;Say, you
haven't put Glen in <em>pants</em> yet?"</p>

<p>"No," he laughed delightedly and the two sisters giggled in glee.
"Guess again. It happened last night."</p>

<p>"Somebody sent you a present?"</p>

<p>"The most wonderful gift!"</p>

<p>"Two of 'em," put in impatient Allee, but the minister held up
a warning finger, and she quickly subsided.</p>

<p>"Two!" repeated Peace, much mystified. "What <em>can</em> they
be? Oh, I know&mdash;monkeys!" For ever since the day that Peace had
brought the sick, half-dead monkey home to the parsonage, it had
been Glen's fondest dream to own one himself.</p>

<p>"No!" Mr. Strong and the other two girls exploded in a gale of
laughter.</p>

<p>"Give it up then," Peace promptly retorted. "I mightn't guess
in a hundred years and I'm fairly bu'sting to know."</p>

<p>"Well, girlie, the angels brought us two little babies last night
for our very own. Two! Think of it!"</p>

<p>"Twins!" gurgled Allee, ecstatically hopping from one foot to
the other.</p>

<p>"Both girls!" added Cherry, hugging herself from sheer joy at
being part bearer of the glad tidings.</p>

<p>"Truly, St. John?" asked Peace, almost too amazed for words.</p>

<p>"Truly, my lady."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of that! I bet you were s'prised. Now
weren't you? What do they look like? Are they pretty?"</p>

<p>"I can't say they are very beautiful to look at yet," admitted
the fond father. "They resemble scraps of wrinkled red flannel
more than anything else just now. But they will improve. Glen
did, and he was a caution to took at when he was a day old."</p>

<p>"Are they big or little?"</p>

<p>"Neither is very large, but one is tinier than the other,&mdash;weighs
only four pounds. She isn't such a brilliant scarlet as her sister,
and we <em>think</em> she will have dark eyes and black hair.
The reddest one has blue eyes now, is bald-headed, and possesses
a most excellent pair of lungs. The Tiniest One has cried only
once so far, but its twin makes up for it."</p>

<p>"What are their names?" The three girls hung breathlessly on
his answer.</p>

<p>"That's one reason I am here now," the minister replied gravely.
"Elspeth and I couldn't discover any suitable names for the twinnies,
so she sent me down here to consult with Peace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>O&mdash;</em>ee!" squealed the girls.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" whispered Peace in awed amazement. "Does she really
want <em>me</em> to name her babies?"</p>

<p>"Shouldn't you like to?"</p>

<p>"O, so much! But most mothers would thank other folks to let
them do their own naming. Or, if the mothers didn't mind, prob'ly
the children themselves would kick when they grew up. There was
our family, for one. Grandpa Greenfield named the most of us,
and see what a job he made of it. He went to the Bible for us,
too."</p>

<p>The minister's lips twitched, but Peace was so very serious that
he dared not laugh; so, after an apologetic cough behind his hand,
he suggested politely, "Then suppose we arrange it this way,&mdash;if
the first names you select don't suit, we will tell you so, and
you can pick out some others."</p>

<p>"O, don't I have to think them up today? I s'posed you would
want 'em right away. Grandpa named us the first time he looked
at us, Gail says."</p>

<p>"Well, we needn't be in such a big hurry as that, girlie. It
took us a month to decide what we should call our boy, and if
you want that long a time, take it."</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall," she replied, viewing her unusual and
unexpected privilege with serious eyes. "Not being a mother or
a father, I don't expect it will take me more'n a few days to
find very pretty names." Then, as if struck by an important thought,
she asked, "But how will you <em>Christian</em> them, s'posing
I don't hit on some likely names before a month is up?"</p>

<p>"Christian them!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Like they did Tommy Finnegan's baby brother. He was only
seven days old, but he had to have a name before the priest could
Christian him."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Mr. Strong was enlightened. "There is no set time in our
church for christening babies, dear. We call it baptizing in our
church, and sometimes parents don't have their children baptized
until they are old enough to understand for themselves what it
means."</p>

<p>"Then you won't be having the twins chris&mdash;baptizzened for some
time yet!"</p>

<p>"No, probably not until Children's Day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, that's already gone by! There won't be another until next
summer!"</p>

<p>"Next June. But that is usually the time we perform that ceremony
in our church, although any other time is just as good."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll have your children named by that time,&mdash;don't you
fret. Allee, won't you bring me 'Hill's Evangel' from the Library?
I 'member that has strings of names in it."</p>

<p>"'Hill's Manual,'" corrected the preacher, picking up his hat
and preparing to depart.</p>

<p>"Is it? St. John says it is 'Hill's Emanuel,'" she called after
the fleeing sister. "It's a big dirty-red book and you will find
it in the furthest corner of the bookcase on the next to the lowest
shelf. Why, St. John, must you hustle away so soon? You've hardly
got here yet. Perhaps I could have some names ready for you to
take home with you if you'd wait a while longer."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Peace," he bowed courteously. "But I must hurry home
and mind the kiddies. There is no one there to look after them
and Elspeth except the nurse and Aunt Pen. I told them I shouldn't
be gone but a few minutes, and here it is almost an hour. Good-bye,
Peace. Good-bye, Cherry. I'll come again soon."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, St. John, and next time bring the twins with you."</p>

<p>"O, Peace," gasped Allee, who was just returning with the heavy
book in her short arms, and overheard the sister's parting admonition;
"they're too fresh yet. Grandma says it will prob'ly be several
weeks 'fore they get taken anywhere."</p>

<p>The preacher, convulsed with laughter, glanced back over his
shoulder and seeing the look of disappointment in the brown eyes,
rashly promised, "This shall be the first place they visit, girlies,
and we'll bring them just as soon as they are old enough."</p>

<p>So he swung out of sight down the driveway, and Peace turned
to her delightful task of finding suitable names for the little
strangers at the parsonage.</p>

<p>"They ought to begin with the same letter," suggested Cherry,
wishing it had fallen to her lot to name a pair of twins, "like
Hazel and Helen Bean."</p>

<p>"Or else rhyme with each other," put in excited Allee, thinking
it a most wonderful privilege which had been granted Peace, "like
Pearl and Beryl Whittaker."</p>

<p>"Or they might suggest the same thing," ventured Hope, who had
heard the good news and had come out to see what progress the
favored sister was making. "For instance, Opal and Garnet Ordway.
The opal and the garnet are precious stones, you know."</p>

<p>"<em>These</em> twins are precious babies," interrupted Peace
in decided accents, "and we shan't call them such heathenish names
as stones. This book, now, has a long line of names,&mdash;here it
is,&mdash;and there ought to be some pretty ones amongst them, though
I can't say the <em>a's</em> sound very nice. There is only one
decent one in the bunch and that's Abigail."</p>

<p>Hope, leaning over the back of her chair, scanned the list beginning
with <em>a's</em> and thoughtfully read aloud, "Abigail, Achsa,
Ada, Adaline, Addie, Adela, Adelaide, Adora, Agatha, Agnes, Alethea,
Alexandra, Alice, Almeda, Amanda, Amarilla, Amy, Angeline, Anna,
Annabel, Antoinette, Augusta, Aurelia, Aurora, Avis,&mdash;that last
one isn't so bad&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It isn't so good, either," Peace retorted. "It sounds like the
thing you fall into when you tumble off a steep mountain. I wouldn't
want a baby of mine called that."</p>

<p>"Abyss, you mean," suggested Hope, when the other sisters looked
mystified. "No one else would ever think of such a thing."</p>

<p>"No one else needs to. I'd do thinking enough for all if I tacked
such a name on a little baby that couldn't help itself."</p>

<p>It was very evident that Peace had taken a deep dislike to the
name, so Hope said no more, and they turned their attention to
the next letter with no better success. Peace was too critical
to be easily satisfied, and when the whole list had been thoroughly
considered several times, she sighed, "There is only one nice
name on the page."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;?" Hope ventured.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth."</p>

<p>"But that is Mrs. Strong's name!" all three chorused.</p>

<p>"Don't I know it? And can't a baby be named for its mother? Gail
was. The only trouble is there is no other pretty name to go with
it. Nothing rhymes with it, and none of the other <em>e's</em>
are nice enough."</p>

<p>"Hasn't Mrs. Strong a sister named Esther?" asked Cherry, consulting
the list again.</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;s, but since I knew Esther Kern, I've lost my liking for
that name. I can't bear to think of one of those lovely twins
growing up into such a pug-nosed, freckle-faced sauce-box."</p>

<p>"Well, here is 'Evelyn,'&mdash;that is pretty enough, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"And Evelyn Smiley would say the baby was named for her. I'd
sooner call it Peace, and be done with it."</p>

<p>"Then how about Edith, for Miss Smiley?"</p>

<p>"It's too short. Elizabeth has four pieces to it, and it wouldn't
be fair to give less than four to the other one."</p>

<p>So the search for a name went on, and each succeeding day found
Peace no nearer her goal. Whenever the busy pastor appeared for
a brief chat, she had to own defeat, and beg for a little more
time. One day a brilliant thought occurred to her, and the next
time the preacher's shining black head appeared at the gate he
was greeted with the excited yell, "What is Elspeth's middle name?
It isn't right to call one baby after its mother and the other
after nobody."</p>

<p>"Elspeth has no middle name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Neither have I," sighed Peace. "When I marry, my middle name
will be Greenfield, but until then I haven't got any."</p>

<p>"That's the way with Elizabeth."</p>

<p>"I was afraid it would be, but I hoped she would be more fortunate
than me."</p>

<p>Another idea buzzed through her brain.</p>

<p>"What's <em>your</em> middle name? Maybe we could make something
out of that."</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," he smiled. "I was named John Solomon, after
my two doting grandfathers."</p>

<p>"Solomon!" she echoed in great disappointment. "Mercy! I wouldn't
name a cat that!"</p>

<p>"Neither would I," he agreed quite cheerfully, and Peace returned
to the much thumbed 'Hill's Manual' once more to consider the
list of <em>e's</em>.</p>

<p>"I've a notion to call the Tiniest One Evangeline," she mused.
"It's exactly as long and almost as pretty. Only it sounds so
much like these preachers that get up and rage and dance all over
the pulpit while they are trying to think of what they meant to
say. I should hate to think of either twin growing up to be a
woman preacher, 'specially the Tiniest One. I always wanted to
call <em>her</em> Elizabeth, 'cause she is so much gooder than
the Tiny One, but St. John says she has dark eyes. Elspeth's are
blue, so it ought to be the blue-eyed baby that's named for her,
I s'pose, even if it does cry more. Mercy, in another two days
the month will be up, and I <em>must</em> have those names by
then. It's hard work always to say the Tiny One and the Tiniest
One."</p>

<p>Again she fell into a brown study, but two days later found her
as undecided as ever, and she concluded to ask for just one more
week in which to make up her mind. However, when Mr. Strong appeared
for his brief visit that morning, his face looked so sadly grave
as he bent over the crippled child to give her his usual kiss
of greeting that she cried apprehensively, "What's the matter,
St. John! Has anything happened to the twins?"</p>

<p>"One of them&mdash;the Tiniest One&mdash;flew away with the angels last
night," he answered simply, turning his face away that she might
not witness his grief.</p>

<p>For a moment his reply dazed her; then she threw both arms about
his neck, and burst into tears, sobbing as if her heart would
break, while he dumbly sought to soothe her sorrow, by cuddling
her head on his shoulder and rubbing his quivering cheek against
hers, for he could not trust his voice to speak.</p>

<p>The first outburst of grief over, Peace shook the tears from
her eyes, loosened her strangling grasp about his neck and gulped,
"Well, that makes the naming of them easier, doesn't it, St. John!
I was so fussed up to find something nice enough to go with Elizabeth,
but now we'll just call the Tiniest One 'Angel Baby' and be glad
that God didn't lug off both twins. But oh, I do wish He had waited
a little while longer until I could have seen the two live twins."</p>

<p>So they comforted each other, and when the grave-eyed minister
left her a few moments later, she was smiling ever so faintly,
while the heaviness of his heart had lifted a bit, and he felt
better for the child's sympathy.</p>

<p>Sitting alone in her chair under the trees after the tall, black-frocked
figure had disappeared down the avenue, Peace suddenly heard the
voice of Mrs. Campbell through the library window saying in troubled
tones, "I really ought to go up to the parsonage myself and see
Mrs. Strong in person. She would appreciate it more than anything
else, but it is utterly impossible to go today, with that Board
Meeting to attend to. I suppose I might write a little note of
condolence now and make my call tomorrow, but such things are
so stiff at best&mdash;"</p>

<p>Abruptly Peace remembered that she had sent no message by St.
John to her sorrowing Elspeth, and with feverish eagerness she
caught at her grandmother's suggestion of a note, turning to the
table beside her chair where lay the dirty-red book which she
had consulted so often during the past few weeks.</p>

<p>"I'll write her, too," she decided. "There are some lovely <em>corndolences</em>
in this 'Manual,' and I wouldn't for the world have her think
I didn't care terribly bad because one of her babies has died."</p>

<p>With impatient fingers she turned the worn and ragged pages until
she found the section she was seeking. Then pulling out pen and
paper, she laboriously copied one of the stilted, old-fashioned
epistles printed under the title of "Letters of Sympathy," and
despatched it, hidden under a beautiful spray of white daisies
and fern, to the little parsonage on the hill.</p>

<p>Elizabeth herself received the badly blotted missive, and with
startled, mystified eyes, read the incongruous words penned by
that childish hand.</p>

<p>"My dear Friend, &mdash;I realize that this letter will find
you berried in the deepest sorrow at the loss of your darling
little Angle Baby, and that words of mine will be intirely inacqueduct
to assawsage your overwhelming grief; yet I feel that I must write
a few words to insure you that I am thinking of you and praying
for you. If there can be a coppersating thought, it is that your
darling returned to the God who gave it pure and unspotted by
the world's temptations. The white rose and bud I send (Jud says
there haint any in blossom, so I'll have to take daisies) I trust
you will permit to rest upon your darling's pillow.</p>

<p>With feelings of deepest symparthy, I remain, dear friend,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Yours very sincerely,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>PEACE GREENFIELD</em>."

</p>
<p>
On the other side of the inky sheet were scrawled a few almost illegible<br/>
lines, "My darlingest St. Elspeth, I have neerly squalled my heyes out<br/>
because St. John says your Angle Baby has flewn back to Heaven and I<br/>
wanted it to stay. But I am glad you have got another twin so the little<br/>
crib St. John told us about won't be all empty and you will still have<br/>
one reel live baby to rock to sleep besides Glen. This note of<br/>
corndolence on the other page is the best I could find. All the others<br/>
were too old. This one fits pretty well, but I had to change it a<br/>
little, and even now it is stiff like Grandma says all notes of<br/>
corndolence are. But I guess you will know I am as sorry as can be, for<br/>
I love you and want you to be happy.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>YOUR PEACE</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>And Elizabeth, looking with tear-dimmed eyes from the bungling
little note to the lovely, snow-white daisies in the box, was
strangely comforted.</p>
