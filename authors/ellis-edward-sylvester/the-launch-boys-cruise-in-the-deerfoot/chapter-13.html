<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>An automobile chugging along at the rate of thirty miles an hour
whirled around a bend in the road from the eastward and approached
the youths, who halted and looked wonderingly at it. The youthful
chauffeur bent over the steering wheel, and beside him sat a bearded,
grim-looking man in middle life, with a big brass badge on his
breast. The two were the only occupants of the car, the broad
rear seat being unoccupied.</p>

<p>The moment the constable, as he was, caught sight of the lads,
he raised his hand to signify he had business with them. At the
same time the chauffeur slowed up in front of Alvin and Chester.
The officer leaped out before the car had hardly stopped and strode
toward them.</p>

<p>"I want you!" was his crisp remark.</p>

<p>"What do you want of us?" asked the astonished Alvin.</p>

<p>"I'll blame soon show you. No shenanigan! Hand over your pistols."</p>

<p>"We haven't any; you are the only one hereabouts that's armed,"
said the Captain, observing that the man had drawn a revolver.</p>

<p>"In here with you! I've no time to fool!"</p>

<p>The lads resented his peremptory manner. Chester asked:</p>

<p>"Why should we get into your auto? We prefer to choose our own
company; we don't like your looks."</p>

<p>"I know mighty well you don't, nor do I like <em>your</em> looks,
but that makes no difference. In with you, I say, or I'll blow
your heads off!"</p>

<p>The alarming words and action of the officer left no doubt of
his earnestness. Alvin replied:</p>

<p>"We have a right to know why you arrest us; we have done nothing
unlawful."</p>

<p>"I don't mind reminding you that the Rockledge post office was
robbed last night. Banet Raymond the postmaster said it was done
by three scoundrels&mdash;all wearing masks and dressed in yachting
clothes. They came this way; where's the other fellow?"</p>

<p>"We had a companion with us when we came up the Sheepscot, but
he's gone in search of our boat that some one stole from us a
little while ago."</p>

<p>"You're the skeezicks I'm after; we'll soon have the third burglar."</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do with us?" asked Alvin. "Where is your
warrant?"</p>

<p>"I don't need any."</p>

<p>Neither he nor Chester was alarmed. The arrest could have but
one issue, since sooner or later their identity would be proved;
but the situation was exasperating, for it promised to interfere
with their capture of the stolen boat or at least cause serious
delay in making the search. It was dangerous to trifle with an
officer who was in no mood to accept any excuse from the couple
whom he believed to be criminals. He added:</p>

<p>"Robbing a post office is a crime against Uncle Sam, and he's
a pretty hard proposition to buck against. If you have a story
to tell me, I'll give you three minutes to do it in."</p>

<p>The two stepped beside the auto, the glum chauffeur silently
watching them.</p>

<p>"It's all well enough for you to be so bumptious in the performance
of what you may think is your duty," said Alvin, looking into
the iron countenance, "but I suppose you have made a mistake once
or twice in your lifetime."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with this business? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"My name is Alvin Landon and my friend here is Chester Haynes.
Our parents each have a summer home on Southport, opposite Squirrel
Island. My father made me a present of a motor boat a short time
ago; we have been cruising about the bay and islands for several
weeks; this morning we left home with a companion, an Irish lad
named Mike Murphy; we stopped at the blockhouse up the river and
went ashore to eat our lunch; while we were doing so, some one
ran off with the boat; Mike has gone on a run down stream to see
if he can overtake it; we walked to this place and sent a telegram
to Point Quarry, inquiring about the craft and learned it had
passed there a few minutes before, headed down stream. There you
have our story straight and true: what have you to say about it?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it. Anyhow, you'll have the chance
to tell it in court, where you're certain to get justice done
you."</p>

<p>The officer handed his weapon to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Keep your eye on 'em, Tim, and at the first move, shoot!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," responded the chauffeur, showing by his looks that
he would have been quite glad of an excuse for displaying his
markmanship upon one or both of the prisoners.</p>

<p>His hands thus freed, the officer ran them deftly over the clothing
of each lad from his shoulders to his knees, to assure himself
they carried no weapons. The search was satisfactory.</p>

<p>"Throwed your guns away, I 'spose. Now for the bracelets."</p>

<p>He whipped out a pair of handcuffs, at sight of which Alvin recoiled
with a flush of shame.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, please; we'll give our parole. With your pistol
you are not afraid of two unarmed boys."</p>

<p>The appeal touched the pride of the officer, who dropped the
handcuffs into the side pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm not afeared of you, but you might try to give
me the slip, if a chance should happen to come your way."</p>

<p>"We will not, for we have nothing to fear."</p>

<p>"All right. You," addressing Alvin, "will sit in front while
I take your friend with me on the back seat."</p>

<p>Brief as was the conversation between the constable and his prisoners,
it attracted the attention of several men, women and young persons,
who gathered round the automobile, and catching the meaning of
the incident from the remarks of those concerned, naturally indulged
in remarks.</p>

<p>"Seems to me that this part of Maine has become a favorite tramping
ground for yeggmen and post office robbers," said a man in white
flannels, with a tennis racquet in one hand and two tennis balls
in the other. "These gentlemen have begun young."</p>

<p>"Who would think it of them?" asked the sweet girl at his side.</p>

<p>"Can't judge a fellow by his looks."</p>

<p>"Which is fortunate for you, Algernon."</p>

<p>He lifted his hat in mock obeisance.</p>

<p>An older man, probably a member of the same party of players,
spoke oracularly:</p>

<p>"You needn't say that, Gwendolen; you <em>can</em> judge a person
by his looks. Now just to look at the face of that chap on the
front seat. He is rather handsome, but it is easy to see that
the stamp of crime is there, as plain as the sun at noonday. Like
enough he is a tough from the Bowery of New York."</p>

<p>"And the one on the rear seat beside the officer isn't any better,"
said a middle-aged woman, peering through her eyeglasses. "Just
think of two as young as they robbing a post office for a few
paltry dollars, and almost beating the life out of the old postmaster!
Ugh! it would serve them right if they were lynched."</p>

<p>Every word of this and many more were heard by Alvin and Chester
during their brief debate with the officer. It "added to the gayety
of nations" and caused Alvin to turn his head and say to his friend:</p>

<p>"Give a dog a bad name, Chester&mdash;you know the rest. We don't
seem to have made a very good impression in Charmount. I never
knew I looked so much like a double-dyed villain."</p>

<p>"I have noticed it many times and it has caused me much pain."</p>

<p>"It might distress me, if we both were not in the same boat."</p>

<p>"We have often been in the same boat, but I don't know that we
ever shall be again. Ah, you have one friend in Charmount."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Alvin, with quick interest.</p>

<p>"It's a <em>she</em>; cast your eye toward the telegraph office."</p>

<p>As Alvin did so, he saw the sweet-looking telegraphist in the
door and watching proceedings. He could not resist the temptation
to touch his fingers to his lips and waft them toward her. Nothing
daunted, she replied similarly, whereat most of the spectators
were shocked.</p>

<p>"I should hold her in tender regard," said Alvin, "if she didn't
ask such a big price for a look at Mike's telegram."</p>

<p>"How much does she want?"</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you give it her?"</p>

<p>"I didn't happen to have the change with me; can you help me
out?"</p>

<p>"I should like to help us both out, but the officer might object."</p>

<p>The chauffeur was backing and turning, and now headed the machine
over the road by which he had brought his employer to this spot.</p>

<p>"Where to now?" asked Alvin of their gaoler.</p>

<p>"Augusta&mdash;as straight and fast as we can travel."</p>

<p>But Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes down to the present time
have never seen the capital of the State of Maine.</p>
