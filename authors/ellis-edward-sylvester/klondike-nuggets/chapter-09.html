<p>All hurried to the side of Roswell, who was pointing to a place
a short distance from the raft.</p>

<p>It was the body of a man that they saw, floating face upward.
His clothing was good, and the white features, partly hidden by
a black beard, must have been pleasing in life. The feet and hands,
dangling at the sides, were so low in the water that only when
stirred by the waves did they show, but the face rose and fell,
sometimes above, and never more than a few inches below, so that
it was in view all the time.</p>

<p>The group silently viewed the scene. The body drifted nearer
and nearer and faintly touched the edge of the raft, as the wind
carried it past. Then it continued dipping, and gradually floated
away in the gathering gloom.</p>

<p>"We ought to give it burial," said Frank to Jeff, who shook his
head.</p>

<p>"What's the use? We might tow it ashore, dig up a foot of the
frozen earth, and set a wooden cross or heap of stones to mark
the grave, but the lake is as good a burial-place as it could
have."</p>

<p>"I wonder who he could have been," said Roswell thoughtfully.
"Some man, no doubt, who has come from his home in the States,
thousands of miles away, and started to search for gold. He may
have left wife and children behind, who will look longingly for
his coming, but will never see his face again."</p>

<p>"The world is full of such sad things," observed Tim McCabe,
impressed, like all, with the melancholy incident, and then he
expressed the thought that was in the mind of each: "There be
five of us: will we all see home again?"</p>

<p>There was no reply. Hardman had not spoken, and, as if the occasion
was too oppressive, he sauntered to another part of the raft,
while the rest gradually separated, each grave and saddened by
what he had witnessed.</p>

<p>It is well for us to turn aside from the hurly-burly of life
and reflect upon the solemn fact of the inevitable end that awaits
us all.</p>

<p>But the long afternoon was drawing to a close, and the question
to be considered was whether the raft should be allowed to drift
or land, or they should continue forward, despite a certain degree
of danger during the darkness. All were eager to improve the time,
and Jeff, as the head of the expedition, said they would keep
at it at least for a while longer.</p>

<p>"As far as I can tell," he said, "there's no danger of running
into anything that'll wreck us, and we must use our sail while
we can. Besides," he added, after testing it, "the water is so
deep that we can't reach bottom, and there isn't much chance to
help ourselves."</p>

<p>The wind which swept over the raft had risen almost to a gale,
and brought with it a few scurrying flakes of snow. There was
a perceptible fall in the temperature, and the chilly, penetrating
air caused all to shiver, despite their thick clothing.</p>

<p>Finally night closed in, and the raft was still drifting, the
wind carrying it four or five miles an hour. The night was so
short that the hope was general that the straightforward progress
would continue until sunrise, though Tim, who was better acquainted
with the region, expressed the belief that a storm of several
days' duration had set in.</p>

<p>Since there was nothing to do, the men and boys disposed of themselves
as comfortably as possible on the lee side of the raft, beyond
reach of the waves, though the spray now and then dashed against
their rubber blankets which each had wrapped about his shoulders
and body. After a time Jeff took his station at the bow, though
an almost imperceptible change of wind caused the structure to
drift partly sideways.</p>

<p>Roswell and Frank, who were seated back to back and in an easy
attitude, had sunk into a doze, when both were startled by a bump
which swung them partly over. They straightened up and looked
around in the gloom, wondering what it meant.</p>

<p>"We've struck shore," called Jeff, who was the only one on watch.
"The voyage is over for the time."</p>

<p>There was hurrying to and fro, as all perceived that he had spoken
the truth. The corner of the raft had impinged against some ice
that was piled on the beach. The gloom was too deep for any one
to see more than a few rods, so that Tim, who had traversed the
sheet of water before, was unable to guess where they were.</p>

<p>"Provided we've come over a straight coorse," said the Irishman,
"we can't be far from the fut of the lake."</p>

<p>"We'll know in the morning, which can't be far off," replied
Jeff; "we'll make ourselves as comfortable as we can until then."</p>

<p>Despite the wind, they managed to light several matches and examine
their watches. To their surprise, the night was nearly gone, and
it was decided not to attempt to put up their tent until daylight.
Accordingly, they huddled together and spent the remaining hour
of gloom in anything but comfort.</p>

<p>At the earliest streakings of light all were astir. Springing
from the ground, Tim McCabe hurriedly walked a short way to the
northward. The others had risen to their feet and were watching
him. As the gray light rapidly overspread the scene, they saw
the lake, still tossing with whitecaps, stretching to the south
and west, with the shore faintly visible. On the east, north,
south, and west towered the snow-capped mountains, with Mount
Lotne and other peaks piercing the very clouds. The sun was still
hidden, with the air damp, cold, and penetrating.</p>

<p>Tim McCabe was seen to stand motionless for some minutes, when
he slowly turned about on his heels and attentively studied the
landmarks. Then he suddenly flung his cap high in air, and, catching
it as it came down, began dancing a jig with furious vigor. He
acted as if he had bidden good-by to his senses.</p>

<p>"Whoop! hurrah!" he shouted, as he replaced his cap and hurried
to his friends. "We're at the fut of the lake!"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "WE'RE AT <em>THE FUT OF THE LAKE," SHOUTED TIM</em>.]</p>

<p>Such was the fact. A steamer guided by pilot and compass could
not have come more directly to the termination of the sheet of
water. Tim had cause for rejoicing, and all congratulated themselves
upon their good fortune.</p>

<p>"There's only one bad thing about the same," he added more seriously.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Jeff.</p>

<p>"We're no longer in the United States."</p>

<p>"That's the fact," said Hardman, "we're in British Columbia."</p>

<p>After all, this was a small matter. Inasmuch as the signs indicated
a severe storm, it was decided to stay where they were until its
chief fury was spent. The snow was shovelled aside to allow them
to reach the frozen earth, into which the stakes were securely
driven, and the tent set up, with the stove in position.</p>

<p>Beyond Chilkoot Pass plenty of timber is to be found, consisting
of pine, spruce, cottonwood, and birch. Thus far not the first
sign of game had been seen. The whole country, after leaving Dyea,
is mountainous.</p>

<p>Most of the goods were left on the raft, where they were protected
by the rubber sheathing and the secure manner in which they were
packed and bound.</p>

<p>Three dreary days of waiting followed, and the hours became so
monotonous at times, especially after the hard, active toil that
had preceded them, that in some respects it was the most trying
period of the memorable journey of our friends from Dyea to Dawson
City. The men found consolation in their pipes, which frequently
made the air within the tent intolerable to the youngsters. Like
most smokers, however, the men never suspected the annoyance they
caused, and the boys were too considerate to hint anything of
the kind. When their young limbs yearned for exercise, they bolted
out of doors, in the face of the driving sleet and fine snow which
cut the face like bird-shot. Locking arms, they wrestled and rolled
and tumbled in the snow, washed each other's faces, flung the
snow about&mdash;for it was too dry to admit of being wrought into
balls&mdash;and when tired out, they came back panting and with red
cheeks, showing that their lungs had been filled with the life-giving
ozone.</p>

<p>It was necessary now and then to cut fuel from the adjacent wood,
and this was done by Tim and Jeff. The boys asked to be allowed
to try their hand, but they were too unskilful in wielding an
axe, and their request was denied. Now and then the howling gale
drove the smoke back into the tent, where it was almost as bad
as the odor from the pipes.</p>

<p>The four slept at intervals through the day and most of the long
night; but now and then the men laid aside their pipes, the stove
"drew," and the atmosphere within was agreeable. The only books
in the company were the two pocket Bibles furnished by the mothers
of Roswell and Frank. Neither boy forgot his promise to read the
volume whenever suitable opportunity presented. Seeing Frank reclining
on his blanket, with his little Bible in hand, Jeff asked him
to read it aloud, and the boy gladly complied. It was a striking
sight, as the men inclined their heads and reverently listened
to the impressive words from the Book of Life. There was no jesting
or badinage, for that chord which the Creator has placed in every
human heart was touched, and responded with sweet music. Many
an hour was thus passed&mdash;let us hope with profit to every one
of the little party.</p>

<p>Finally the longed-for lull in the storm came, and the voyage
was renewed. The trip through Caribou Crossing was made without
mishap, the distance being about four miles, when they entered
Marsh Lake, often known as Mud Lake, though no apparent cause
exists for the title. No difficulty was experienced in making
their way for the twenty-four miles of its length, at the end
of which they debouched into Lynx River, where twenty-seven more
miles were passed without incident or trouble worth recording.</p>
