<p>Two evenings after, Louisa tapped at the door of the Quarry
Cottage, at half-past six.  He had finished dinner, the woman had
washed up and gone away, but still he sat in his pit dirt.  He was
going later to the New Inn.  He had begun to go there because he
must go somewhere.  The mere contact with other men was necessary
to him, the noise, the warmth, the forgetful flight of the hours.
But still he did not move.  He sat alone in the empty house till it
began to grow on him like something unnatural.</p>

<p>He was in his pit dirt when he opened the door.</p>

<p>&quot;I have been wanting to call - I thought I would,&quot; she said, and she
went to the sofa.  He wondered why she wouldn't use his mother's
round armchair.  Yet something stirred in him, like anger, when the
housekeeper placed herself in it.</p>

<p>&quot;I ought to have been washed by now,&quot; he said, glancing at the
clock, which was adorned with butterflies and cherries, and the
name of &quot;T. Brooks, Mansfield.&quot;  He laid his black hands along his
mottled dirty arms.  Louisa looked at him.  There was the reserve,
and the simple neutrality towards her, which she dreaded in him.
It made it impossible for her to approach him.</p>

<p>&quot;I am afraid,&quot; she said, &quot;that I wasn't kind in asking you to
supper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not used to it,&quot; he said, smiling with his mouth, showing the
interspaced white teeth.  His eyes, however, were steady and
unseeing.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not THAT,&quot; she said hastily.  Her repose was exquisite and
her dark grey eyes rich with understanding.  He felt afraid of her
as she sat there, as he began to grow conscious of her.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you get on alone?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>He glanced away to the fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh - &quot; he answered, shifting uneasily, not finishing his answer.</p>

<p>Her face settled heavily.</p>

<p>&quot;How close it is in this room.  You have such immense fires.  I
will take off my coat,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He watched her take off her hat and coat.  She wore a cream cashmir
blouse embroidered with gold silk.  It seemed to him a very fine
garment, fitting her throat and wrists close.  It gave him a
feeling of pleasure and cleanness and relief from himself.</p>

<p>&quot;What were you thinking about, that you didn't get washed?&quot; she
asked, half intimately.  He laughed, turning aside his head.  The
whites of his eyes showed very distinct in his black face.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;I couldn't tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to keep this house on?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>He stirred in his chair, under the question.</p>

<p>&quot;I hardly know,&quot; he said.  &quot;I'm very likely going to Canada.&quot;</p>

<p>Her spirit became very quiet and attentive.</p>

<p>&quot;What for?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>Again he shifted restlessly on his seat.</p>

<p>&quot;Well&quot; - he said slowly - &quot;to try the life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But which life?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's various things - farming or lumbering or mining.  I don't
mind much what it is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And is that what you want?&quot;</p>

<p>He did not think in these times, so he could not answer.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said, &quot;till I've tried.&quot;</p>

<p>She saw him drawing away from her for ever.</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't you sorry to leave this house and garden?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; he answered reluctantly.  &quot;I suppose our Fred would
come in - that's what he's wanting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't want to settle down?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>He was leaning forward on the arms of his chair.  He turned to her.
Her face was pale and set.  It looked heavy and impassive, her hair
shone richer as she grew white.  She was to him something steady
and immovable and eternal presented to him.  His heart was hot in
an anguish of suspense.  Sharp twitches of fear and pain were in
his limbs.  He turned his whole body away from her.  The silence
was unendurable.  He could not bear her to sit there any more.  It
made his heart go hot and stifled in his breast.</p>

<p>&quot;Were you going out to-night?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Only to the New Inn,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Again there was silence.</p>

<p>She reached for her hat.  Nothing else was suggested to her.  She
HAD to go.  He sat waiting for her to be gone, for relief.  And she
knew that if she went out of that house as she was, she went out a
failure.  Yet she continued to pin on her hat; in a moment she
would have to go.  Something was carrying her.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a sharp pang, like lightning, seared her from head to
foot, and she was beyond herself.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you want me to go?&quot; she asked, controlled, yet speaking out of
a fiery anguish, as if the words were spoken from her without her
intervention.</p>

<p>He went white under his dirt.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; he asked, turning to her in fear, compelled.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you want me to go?&quot; she repeated.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; he asked again.</p>

<p>&quot;Because I wanted to stay with you,&quot; she said, suffocated, with her
lungs full of fire.</p>

<p>His face worked, he hung forward a little, suspended, staring
straight into her eyes, in torment, in an agony of chaos, unable to
collect himself.  And as if turned to stone, she looked back into
his eyes.  Their souls were exposed bare for a few moments.  It was
agony.  They could not bear it.  He dropped his head, whilst his
body jerked with little sharp twitchings.</p>

<p>She turned away for her coat.  Her soul had gone dead in her.  Her
hands trembled, but she could not feel any more.  She drew on her
coat.  There was a cruel suspense in the room.  The moment had come
for her to go.  He lifted his head.  His eyes were like agate,
expressionless, save for the black points of torture.  They held
her, she had no will, no life any more.  She felt broken.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you want me?&quot; she said helplessly.</p>

<p>A spasm of torture crossed his eyes, which held her fixed.</p>

<p>&quot;I - I - &quot; he began, but he could not speak.  Something drew him from
his chair to her.  She stood motionless, spellbound, like a
creature given up as prey.  He put his hand tentatively,
uncertainly, on her arm.  The expression of his face was strange
and inhuman.  She stood utterly motionless.  Then clumsily he put
his arms round her, and took her, cruelly, blindly, straining her
till she nearly lost consciousness, till he himself had almost
fallen.</p>

<p>Then, gradually, as he held her gripped, and his brain reeled
round, and he felt himself falling, falling from himself, and
whilst she, yielded up, swooned to a kind of death of herself, a
moment of utter darkness came over him, and they began to wake up
again as if from a long sleep.  He was himself.</p>

<p>After a while his arms slackened, she loosened herself a little,
and put her arms round him, as he held her.  So they held each
other close, and hid each against the other for assurance, helpless
in speech.  And it was ever her hands that trembled more closely
upon him, drawing him nearer into her, with love.</p>

<p>And at last she drew back her face and looked up at him, her eyes
wet, and shining with light.  His heart, which saw, was silent with
fear.  He was with her.  She saw his face all sombre and
inscrutable, and he seemed eternal to her.  And all the echo of
pain came back into the rarity of bliss, and all her tears came up.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you,&quot; she said, her lips drawn and sobbing.  He put down
his head against her, unable to hear her, unable to bear the sudden
coming of the peace and passion that almost broke his heart.  They
stood together in silence whilst the thing moved away a little.</p>

<p>At last she wanted to see him.  She looked up.  His eyes were
strange and glowing, with a tiny black pupil.  Strange, they were,
and powerful over her.  And his mouth came to hers, and slowly her
eyelids closed, as his mouth sought hers closer and closer, and
took possession of her.</p>

<p>They were silent for a long time, too much mixed up with passion
and grief and death to do anything but hold each other in pain and
kiss with long, hurting kisses wherein fear was transfused into
desire.  At last she disengaged herself.  He felt as if his heart
were hurt, but glad, and he scarcely dared look at her.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad,&quot; she said also.</p>

<p>He held her hands in passionate gratitude and desire.  He had not
yet the presence of mind to say anything.  He was dazed with
relief.</p>

<p>&quot;I ought to go,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her.  He could not grasp the thought of her going, he
knew he could never be separated from her any more.  Yet he dared
not assert himself.  He held her hands tight.</p>

<p>&quot;Your face is black,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Yours is a bit smudged,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>They were afraid of each other, afraid to talk.  He could only keep
her near to him.  After a while she wanted to wash her face.  He
brought her some warm water, standing by and watching her.  There
was something he wanted to say, that he dared not.  He watched her
wiping her face, and making tidy her hair.</p>

<p>&quot;They'll see your blouse is dirty,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>She looked at her sleeves and laughed for joy.</p>

<p>He was sharp with pride.</p>

<p>&quot;What shall you do?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He was awkward at a reply.</p>

<p>&quot;About me,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you want me to do?&quot; she laughed.</p>

<p>He put his hand out slowly to her.  What did it matter!</p>

<p>&quot;But make yourself clean,&quot; she said.</p>
