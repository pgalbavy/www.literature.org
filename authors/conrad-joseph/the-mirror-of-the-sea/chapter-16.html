<p> Often I turn with melancholy eagerness to the space reserved
in the newspapers under the general heading of "Shipping Intelligence." 
I meet there the names of ships I have known.  Every year some
of these names disappear—the names of old friends.  "Tempi passati!"</p>

<p>The different divisions of that kind of news are set down in
their order, which varies but slightly in its arrangement of concise
headlines.  And first comes "Speakings"—reports of ships met and
signalled at sea, name, port, where from, where bound for, so
many days out, ending frequently with the words "All well."  Then
come "Wrecks and Casualties"—a longish array of paragraphs, unless
the weather has been fair and clear, and friendly to ships all
over the world.</p>

<p>On some days there appears the heading "Overdue"—an ominous threat
of loss and sorrow trembling yet in the balance of fate.  There
is something sinister to a seaman in the very grouping of the
letters which form this word, clear in its meaning, and seldom
threatening in vain.</p>

<p>Only a very few days more—appallingly few to the hearts which
had set themselves bravely to hope against hope—three weeks, a
month later, perhaps, the name of ships under the blight of the
"Overdue" heading shall appear again in the column of "Shipping
Intelligence," but under the final declaration of "Missing."</p>

<p>"The ship, or barque, or brig So-and-so, bound from such a port,
with such and such cargo, for such another port, having left at
such and such a date, last spoken at sea on such a day, and never
having been heard of since, was posted to-day as missing."  Such
in its strictly official eloquence is the form of funeral orations
on ships that, perhaps wearied with a long struggle, or in some
unguarded moment that may come to the readiest of us, had let
themselves be overwhelmed by a sudden blow from the enemy.</p>

<p>Who can say?  Perhaps the men she carried had asked her to do
too much, had stretched beyond breaking-point the enduring faithfulness
which seems wrought and hammered into that assemblage of iron
ribs and plating, of wood and steel and canvas and wire, which
goes to the making of a ship—a complete creation endowed with
character, individuality, qualities and defects, by men whose
hands launch her upon the water, and that other men shall learn
to know with an intimacy surpassing the intimacy of man with man,
to love with a love nearly as great as that of man for woman,
and often as blind in its infatuated disregard of defects.</p>

<p>There are ships which bear a bad name, but I have yet to meet
one whose crew for the time being failed to stand up angrily for
her against every criticism.  One ship which I call to mind now
had the reputation of killing somebody every voyage she made. 
This was no calumny, and yet I remember well, somewhere far back
in the late seventies, that the crew of that ship were, if anything,
rather proud of her evil fame, as if they had been an utterly
corrupt lot of desperadoes glorying in their association with
an atrocious creature.  We, belonging to other vessels moored
all about the Circular Quay in Sydney, used to shake our heads
at her with a great sense of the unblemished virtue of our own
well-loved ships.</p>

<p>I shall not pronounce her name.  She is "missing" now, after
a sinister but, from the point of view of her owners, a useful
career extending over many years, and, I should say, across every
ocean of our globe.  Having killed a man for every voyage, and
perhaps rendered more misanthropic by the infirmities that come
with years upon a ship, she had made up her mind to kill all hands
at once before leaving the scene of her exploits. A fitting end,
this, to a life of usefulness and crime—in a last outburst of
an evil passion supremely satisfied on some wild night, perhaps,
to the applauding clamour of wind and wave.</p>

<p>How did she do it?  In the word "missing" there is a horrible
depth of doubt and speculation.  Did she go quickly from under
the men’s feet, or did she resist to the end, letting the sea
batter her to pieces, start her butts, wrench her frame, load
her with an increasing weight of salt water, and, dismasted, unmanageable,
rolling heavily, her boats gone, her decks swept, had she wearied
her men half to death with the unceasing labour at the pumps before
she sank with them like a stone?</p>

<p>However, such a case must be rare.  I imagine a raft of some
sort could always be contrived; and, even if it saved no one,
it would float on and be picked up, perhaps conveying some hint
of the vanished name.  Then that ship would not be, properly speaking,
missing.  She would be "lost with all hands," and in that distinction
there is a subtle difference—less horror and a less appalling
darkness.</p>
