<p>Alice had said that no one who knew either Russell or herself
would be likely to see them in the park or upon the dingy street;
but although they returned by that same ungenteel thoroughfare
they were seen by a person who knew them both. Also, with some
surprise on the part of Russell, and something more poignant than
surprise for Alice, they saw this person.</p>

<p>All of the dingy street was ugly, but the greater part of it
appeared to be honest. The two pedestrians came upon a block or
two, however, where it offered suggestions of a less upright character,
like a steady enough workingman with a naughty book sticking out
of his pocket. Three or four dim shops, a single story in height,
exhibited foul signboards, yet fair enough so far as the wording
went; one proclaiming a tobacconist, one a junk-dealer, one a
dispenser of "soft drinks and cigars." The most credulous would
have doubted these signboards; for the craft of the modern tradesman
is exerted to lure indoors the passing glance, since if the glance
is pleased the feet may follow; but this alleged tobacconist and
his neighbours had long been fond of dust on their windows, evidently,
and shades were pulled far down on the glass of their doors. Thus
the public eye, small of pupil in the light of the open street,
was intentionally not invited to the dusky interiors. Something
different from mere lack of enterprise was apparent; and the signboards
might have been omitted; they were pains thrown away, since it
was plain to the world that the business parts of these shops
were the brighter back rooms implied by the dark front rooms;
and that the commerce there was in perilous new liquors and in
dice and rough girls.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more innocent than the serenity with
which these wicked little places revealed themselves for what
they were; and, bound by this final tie of guilelessness, they
stood together in a row which ended with a companionable barbershop,
much like them. Beyond was a series of soot-harried frame two-story
houses, once part of a cheerful neighbourhood when the town was
middle-aged and settled, and not old and growing. These houses,
all carrying the label. "Rooms," had the worried look of vacancy
that houses have when they are too full of everybody without being
anybody's home; and there was, too, a surreptitious air about
them, as if, like the false little shops, they advertised something
by concealing it.</p>

<p>One of them&mdash;the one next to the barber-shop&mdash;had across its
front an ample, jig-sawed veranda, where aforetime, no doubt,
the father of a family had fanned himself with a palm-leaf fan
on Sunday afternoons, watching the surreys go by, and where his
daughter listened to mandolins and badinage on starlit evenings;
but, although youth still held the veranda, both the youth and
the veranda were in decay. The four or five young men who lounged
there this afternoon were of a type known to shady pool-parlours.
Hats found no favour with them; all of them wore caps; and their
tight clothes, apparently from a common source, showed a vivacious
fancy for oblique pockets, false belts, and Easter-egg colourings.
Another thing common to the group was the expression of eye and
mouth; and Alice, in the midst of her other thoughts, had a distasteful
thought about this.</p>

<p>The veranda was within a dozen feet of the sidewalk, and as she
and her escort came nearer, she took note of the young men, her
face hardening a little, even before she suspected there might
be a resemblance between them and any one she knew. Then she observed
that each of these loungers wore not for the occasion, but as
of habit, a look of furtively amused contempt; the mouth smiled
to one side as if not to dislodge a cigarette, while the eyes
kept languidly superior. All at once Alice was reminded of Walter;
and the slight frown caused by this idea had just begun to darken
her forehead when Walter himself stepped out of the open door
of the house and appeared upon the veranda. Upon his head was
a new straw hat, and in his hand was a Malacca stick with an ivory
top, for Alice had finally decided against it for herself and
had given it to him. His mood was lively: he twirled the stick
through his fingers like a drum-major's baton, and whistled loudly.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was indeed accompanied. With him was a thin girl
who had made a violent black-and-white poster of herself: black
dress, black flimsy boa, black stockings, white slippers, great
black hat down upon the black eyes; and beneath the hat a curve
of cheek and chin made white as whitewash, and in strong bilateral
motion with gum.</p>

<p>The loungers on the veranda were familiars of the pair; hailed
them with cacklings; and one began to sing, in a voice all tin:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Then my skirt, Sal, and me did go<br/>
Right straight to the moving-pitcher show.<br/>
OH, you bashful vamp!"

</p>
</div>
<p>The girl laughed airily. "God, but you guys are wise!" she said.</p>

<p>"Come on, Wallie."</p>

<p>Walter stared at his sister; then grinned faintly, and nodded
at Russell as the latter lifted his hat in salutation. Alice uttered
an incoherent syllable of exclamation, and, as she began to walk
faster, she bit her lip hard, not in order to look wistful, this
time, but to help her keep tears of anger from her eyes.</p>

<p>Russell laughed cheerfully. "Your brother certainly seems to
have found the place for 'colour' today," he said. "That girl's
talk must be full of it."</p>

<p>But Alice had forgotten the colour she herself had used in accounting
for Walter's peculiarities, and she did not understand. "What?"
she said, huskily.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember telling me about him? How he was going to
write, probably, and would go anywhere to pick up types and get
them to talk?"</p>

<p>She kept her eyes ahead, and said sharply, "I think his literary
tastes scarcely cover this case!"</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure. He didn't look at all disconcerted. He didn't
seem to mind your seeing him."</p>

<p>"That's all the worse, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," her friend said, genially. "It means he didn't consider
that he was engaged in anything out of the way. You can't expect
to understand everything boys do at his age; they do all sorts
of queer things, and outgrow them. Your brother evidently has
a taste for queer people, and very likely he's been at least half
sincere when he's made you believe he had a literary motive behind
it. We all go through&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Thanks, Mr. Russell," she interrupted. "Let's don't say any
more."</p>

<p>He looked at her flushed face and enlarged eyes; and he liked
her all the better for her indignation: this was how good sisters
ought to feel, he thought, failing to understand that most of
what she felt was not about Walter. He ventured only a word more.
"Try not to mind it so much; it really doesn't amount to anything."</p>

<p>She shook her head, and they went on in silence; she did not
look at him again until they stopped before her own house. Then
she gave him only one glimpse of her eyes before she looked down.
"It's spoiled, isn't it?" she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"What's 'spoiled?'"</p>

<p>"Our walk&mdash;well, everything. Somehow it always&mdash;is."</p>

<p>"'Always is' what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Spoiled," she said.</p>

<p>He laughed at that; but without looking at him she suddenly offered
him her hand, and, as he took it, he felt a hurried, violent pressure
upon his fingers, as if she meant to thank him almost passionately
for being kind. She was gone before he could speak to her again.</p>

<p>In her room, with the door locked, she did not go to her mirror,
but to her bed, flinging herself face down, not caring how far
the pillows put her hat awry. Sheer grief had followed her anger;
grief for the calamitous end of her bright afternoon, grief for
the "end of everything," as she thought then. Nevertheless, she
gradually grew more composed, and, when her mother tapped on the
door presently, let her in. Mrs. Adams looked at her with quick
apprehension.</p>

<p>"Oh, poor child! Wasn't he&#11834;"</p>

<p>Alice told her. "You see how it&mdash;how it made me look, mama,"
she quavered, having concluded her narrative. "I'd tried to cover
up Walter's awfulness at the dance with that story about his being
'literary,' but no story was big enough to cover this up&mdash;and
oh! it must make him think I tell stories about other things!"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" Mrs. Adams protested. "Don't you see? At the worst,
all HE could think is that Walter told stories to you about why
he likes to be with such dreadful people, and you believed them.
That's all HE'D think; don't you see?"</p>

<p>Alice's wet eyes began to show a little hopefulness. "You honestly
think it might be that way, mama?"</p>

<p>"Why, from what you've told me he said, I <em>KNOW </em>it's
that way. Didn't he say he wanted to come again?"</p>

<p>"N-no," Alice said, uncertainly. "But I think he will. At least
I begin to think so now. He&#11834;" She stopped.</p>

<p>"From all you tell me, he seems to be a very desirable young
man," Mrs. Adams said, primly.</p>

<p>Her daughter was silent for several moments; then new tears gathered
upon her downcast lashes. "He's just&mdash;dear!" she faltered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams nodded. "He's told you he isn't engaged, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"No. But I know he isn't. Maybe when he first came here he was
near it, but I know he's not."</p>

<p>"I guess Mildred Palmer would <em>LIKE </em>him to be, all right!"
Mrs. Adams was frank enough to say, rather triumphantly; and Alice,
with a lowered head, murmured:</p>

<p>"Anybody&mdash;would."</p>

<p>The words were all but inaudible.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry," her mother said, and patted her on the shoulder.
"Everything will come out all right; don't you fear, Alice. Can't
you see that beside any other girl in town you're just a perfect
<em>QUEEN? </em>Do you think any young man that wasn't prejudiced,
or something, would need more than just one look to&#11834;"</p>

<p>But Alice moved away from the caressing hand. "Never mind, mama.
I wonder he looks at me at all. And if he does again, after seeing
my brother with those horrible people&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Now, now!" Mrs. Adams interrupted, expostulating mournfully.
"I'm sure Walter's a <em>GOOD </em>boy&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You are?" Alice cried, with a sudden vigour. "You <em>ARE</em>?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure he's <em>GOOD, </em>yes&mdash;and if he isn't, it's not
his fault. It's mine."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!"</p>

<p>"No, it's true," Mrs. Adams lamented. "I tried to bring him up
to be good, God knows; and when he was little he was the best
boy I ever saw. When he came from Sunday-school he'd always run
to me and we'd go over the lesson together; and he let me come
in his room at night to hear his prayers almost until he was sixteen.
Most boys won't do that with their mothers&mdash;not nearly that long.
I tried so hard to bring him up right&mdash;but if anything's gone
wrong it's my fault."</p>

<p>"How could it be? You've just said&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It's because I didn't make your father this&mdash;this new step earlier.
Then Walter might have had all the advantages that other&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, mama, <em>PLEASE!" </em>Alice begged her. "Let's don't go
over all that again. Isn't it more important to think what's to
be done about him? Is he going to be allowed to go on disgracing
us as he does?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams sighed profoundly. "I don't know what to do," she
confessed, unhappily. "Your father's so upset about&mdash;about this
new step he's taking &mdash;I don't feel as if we ought to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Alice cried. "Papa mustn't be distressed with this,
on top of everything else. But <em>SOMETHING'S </em>got to be
done about Walter."</p>

<p>"What can be?" her mother asked, helplessly. "What can be?"</p>

<p>Alice admitted that she didn't know.</p>

<p>At dinner, an hour later, Walter's habitually veiled glance lifted,
now and then, to touch her furtively;&mdash;he was waiting, as he would
have said, for her to "spring it"; and he had prepared a brief
and sincere defense to the effect that he made his own living,
and would like to inquire whose business it was to offer intrusive
comment upon his private conduct. But she said nothing, while
his father and mother were as silent as she. Walter concluded
that there was to be no attack, but changed his mind when his
father, who ate only a little, and broodingly at that, rose to
leave the table and spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Walter," he said, "when you've finished I wish you'd come up
to my room. I got something I want to say to you."</p>

<p>Walter shot a hard look at his apathetic sister, then turned
to his father. "Make it to-morrow," he said. "This is Satad'y
night and I got a date."</p>

<p>"No," Adams said, frowning. "You come up before you go out. It's
important."</p>

<p>"All right; I've had all I want to eat," Walter returned. "I
got a few minutes. Make it quick."</p>

<p>He followed his father upstairs, and when they were in the room
together Adams shut the door, sat down, and began to rub his knees.</p>

<p>"Rheumatism?" the boy inquired, slyly. "That what you want to
talk to me about?"</p>

<p>"No." But Adams did not go on; he seemed to be in difficulties
for words, and Walter decided to help him.</p>

<p>"Hop ahead and spring it," he said. "Get it off your mind: I'll
tell the world <em>I</em> should worry! You aren't goin' to bother
ME any, so why bother yourself? Alice hopped home and told you
she saw me playin' around with some pretty gay-lookin' berries
and you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Alice?" his father said, obviously surprised. "It's nothing
about Alice."</p>

<p>"Didn't she tell you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I haven't talked with her all day."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," Walter said. "She told mother and mother told you."</p>

<p>"No, neither of 'em have told me anything. What was there to
tell?"</p>

<p>Walter laughed. "Oh, it's nothin'," he said. "I was just startin'
out to buy a girl friend o' mine a rhinestone buckle I lost to
her on a bet, this afternoon, and Alice came along with that big
Russell fish; and I thought she looked sore. She expects me to
like the kind she likes, and I don't like 'em. I thought she'd
prob'ly got you all stirred up about it."</p>

<p>"No, no," his father said, peevishly. "I don't know anything
about it, and I don't care to know anything about it. I want to
talk to you about something important."</p>

<p>Then, as he was again silent, Walter said, "Well, <em>TALK </em>about
it; I'm listening."</p>

<p>"It's this," Adams began, heavily. "It's about me going into
this glue business. Your mother's told you, hasn't she?"</p>

<p>"She said you were goin' to leave the old place down-town and
start a glue factory. That's all I know about it; I got my own
affairs to 'tend to."</p>

<p>"Well, this is your affair," his father said, frowning. "You
can't stay with Lamb and Company."</p>

<p>Walter looked a little startled. "What you mean, I can't? Why
not?"</p>

<p>"You've got to help me," Adams explained slowly; and he frowned
more deeply, as if the interview were growing increasingly laborious
for him. "It's going to be a big pull to get this business on
its feet."</p>

<p>"Yes!" Walter exclaimed with a sharp skepticism. "I should say
it was!"  He stared at his father incredulously. "Look here; aren't
you just a little bit sudden, the way you're goin' about things?
You've let mother shove you a little too fast, haven't you? Do
you know anything about what it means to set up a new business
these days?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know all about it," Adams said. "About this business,
I do."</p>

<p>"How do you?"</p>

<p>"Because I made a long study of it. I'm not afraid of going about
it the wrong way; but it's a hard job and you'll have to put in
all whatever sense and strength you've got."</p>

<p>Walter began to breathe quickly, and his lips were agitated;
then he set them obstinately. "Oh; I will," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, you will," Adams returned, not noticing that his son's
inflection was satiric. "It's going to take every bit of energy
in your body, and all the energy I got left in mine, and every
cent of the little I've saved, besides something I'll have to
raise on this house. I'm going right at it, now I've got to; and
you'll have to quit Lamb's by the end of next week."</p>

<p>"Oh, I will?" Walter's voice grew louder, and there was a shrillness
in it. "I got to quit Lamb's the end of next week, have I?" He
stepped forward, angrily. "Listen!" he said. "I'm not walkin'
out o' Lamb's, see? I'm not quittin' down there: I stay with 'em,
see?"</p>

<p>Adams looked up at him, astonished. "You'll leave there next
Saturday,"  he said. "I've got to have you."</p>

<p>"You don't anything o' the kind," Walter told him, sharply. "Do
you expect to pay me anything?"</p>

<p>"I'd pay you about what you been getting down there."</p>

<p>"Then pay somebody else; <em>I</em> don't know anything about
glue. You get somebody else."</p>

<p>"No. You've got to&#11834;"</p>

<p>Walter cut him off with the utmost vehemence. "Don't tell me
what I got to do! I know what I got to do better'n you, I guess!
I stay at Lamb's, see?"</p>

<p>Adams rose angrily. "You'll do what I tell you. You can't stay
down there."</p>

<p>"Why can't I?"</p>

<p>"Because I won't let you."</p>

<p>"Listen! Keep on not lettin' me: I'll be there just the same."</p>

<p>At that his father broke into a sour laughter. "<em>THEY </em>won't
let you, Walter! They won't have you down there after they find
out I'm going."</p>

<p>"Why won't they? You don't think they're goin' to be all shot
to pieces over losin' <em>YOU, </em>do you?"</p>

<p>"I tell you they won't let you stay," his father insisted, loudly.</p>

<p>"Why, what do they care whether you go or not?"</p>

<p>"They'll care enough to fire <em>YOU, </em>my boy!"</p>

<p>"Look here, then; show me why."</p>

<p>"They'll do it!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Walter jeered; "you keep sayin' they will, but when I
ask you to show me why, you keep sayin' they will! That makes
little headway with ME, I can tell you!"</p>

<p>Adams groaned, and, rubbing his head, began to pace the floor.
Walter's refusal was something he had not anticipated; and he
felt the weakness of his own attempt to meet it: he seemed powerless
to do anything but utter angry words, which, as Walter said, made
little headway. "Oh, my, my!" he muttered, "OH, my, my!"</p>

<p>Walter, usually sallow, had grown pale: he watched his father
narrowly, and now took a sudden resolution. "Look here," he said.
"When you say Lamb's is likely to fire me because you're goin'
to quit, you talk like the people that have to be locked up. I
don't know where you get such things in your head; Lamb and Company
won't know you're gone. Listen: I can stay there long as I want
to. But I'll tell you what I'll do: make it worth my while and
I'll hook up with your old glue factory, after all."</p>

<p>Adams stopped his pacing abruptly, and stared at him. "'Make
it worth your while?' What you mean?"</p>

<p>"I got a good use for three hundred dollars right now," Walter
said. "Let me have it and I'll quit Lamb's to work for you. Don't
let me have it and I <em>SWEAR I </em>won't!"</p>

<p>"Are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"Is everybody crazy that needs three hundred dollars?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Adams said. "They are if they ask ME for it, when I got
to stretch every cent I can lay my hands on to make it look like
a dollar!"</p>

<p>"You won't do it?"</p>

<p>Adams burst out at him. "You little fool! If I had three hundred
dollars to throw away, besides the pay I expected to give you,
haven't you got sense enough to see I could hire a man worth three
hundred dollars more to me than you'd be? It's a <em>FINE </em>time
to ask me for three hundred dollars, isn't it! What <em>FOR? </em>Rhinestone
buckles to throw around on your 'girl friends?' Shame on you!
Ask me to <em>BRIBE </em>you to help yourself and your own family!"</p>

<p>"I'll give you a last chance," Walter said. "Either you do what
I want, or I won't do what you want. Don't ask me again after
this, because&#11834;"</p>

<p>Adams interrupted him fiercely. "'Ask you again!' Don't worry
about that, my boy! All I ask you is to get out o' my room."</p>

<p>"Look here," Walter said, quietly; and his lopsided smile distorted
his livid cheek. "Look here: I expect <em>YOU </em>wouldn't give
me three hundred dollars to save my life, would you?"</p>

<p>"You make me sick," Adams said, in his bitterness. "Get out of
here."</p>

<p>Walter went out, whistling; and Adams drooped into his old chair
again as the door closed. "OH, my, my!" he groaned. "Oh, Lordy,
Lordy! The way of the transgressor&#11834;"</p>
