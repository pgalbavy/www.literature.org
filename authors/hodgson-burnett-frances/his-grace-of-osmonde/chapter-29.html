<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The happiness he had dreamed of was given to him; nay, he knew joy and
tenderness even more high and sweet than his fancy had painted. As
Camylott had been in his childhood so he saw it again--the most
beauteous home in England and the happiest, its mistress the fairest
woman and the most nobly loving. As his own father and mother had found
life a joyful thing and their world full of warm hearts and faithful
friends, so he and she he loved, found it together. The great house was
filled once more with guests and pleasures as in the olden time, the
stately apartments were thrown open for entertainment, gay cavalcades
came and went from town, the forests were hunted, the moors shot over
by sportsmen, and the lady who was hostess and chatelaine won renown as
well as hearts, since each party of guests she entertained went back to
the homes they came from, proclaiming to all her wit and gracious
charm.
</p><p>She rode to hunt and leapt hedges as she had done when she had been Clo
Wildairs; she walked the moors with the sportsmen, her gun over her
shoulder, she sparkling and showing her white teeth like a laughing
gipsy; and when she so walked, the black rings of her hair blown loose
about her brow, her cheeks kissed fresh crimson by the wet wind, and
turned her eyes upon my lord Duke near her and their looks met, the man
who beheld saw lovers who set his own heart beating.
</p><p>"But is it true," asked once the great French lady who had related the
history of the breaking of the horse, Devil, "is it true that a poor
man killed himself in despair on her last marriage, and that she lives
a secret life of penance to atone--and wears a hair shirt, and peas in
her beautiful satin shoes, and does deeds of mercy in the dark places
of the big black English city?"
</p><p>"A man, mad with jealous rage of her, disappeared from sight," said an
English lady present. "And he might well have drowned himself from
disappointment that she would not wed him and pay his debts; but 'twas
more like he fled England to escape his creditors. And 'tis true she
does many noble deeds in secret; but if they be done in penance for Sir
John Oxon, she is a lady with a conscience that is tender indeed."
</p><p>That her conscience was a strangely tender thing was a thought which
moved one man's heart strongly many a time. Scarce a day passed in
which her husband did not mark some evidence of this--hear some word
spoken, see some deed done, almost, it seemed, as if in atonement for
imagined faults hid in her heart. He did not remark this because he was
unused to womanly mercifulness; his own mother's life had been full of
gentle kindness to all about her, of acts of charity and goodness, but
in the good deeds of this woman, whom he so loved, he observed an
eagerness which was almost a passion. She had changed no whit in the
brilliance of her spirit; in the world she reigned a queen as she had
ever done; wheresoever she moved, life and gayety seemed to follow,
whether it was at the Court, in the town, or the country; but in both
town and country he found she did strange charities, and seemed to
search for creatures she might aid in such places as other women had
not courage to dive into.
</p><p>This he discovered through encountering her one day as she re-entered
Osmonde House, returning from some such errand, clad in dark, plain
garments, her black hood drawn over her face, being thereby so
disguised that but for her height and bearing he should not have
recognised her--indeed, he thought, she had not seen and would have
passed him in silence.
</p><p>He put forth his hand and stayed her, smiling.
</p><p>"Your Grace!" he said, "or some vision!"
</p><p>She threw the black hood back and her fair face and large black eyes
shone out from beneath its shadows. She drew his hand up and kissed it,
and held it against her cheek in a dear way which was among the
sweetest of her wifely caresses.
</p><p>"It is like Heaven, Gerald," she said, "to see your face, after
beholding such miseries."
</p><p>And when he took her in his arm and led her to the room in which they
loved best to sit in converse together, she told him of a poor creature
she had been to visit, and when she named the place where she had found
her, 'twas a haunt so dark and wicked that he started in alarm and
wonder at her.
</p><p>"Nay, dear one," he said, "such dens are not for you to visit. You must
not go to them again."
</p><p>She was sitting on a low seat before him, and she leaned forward, the
black hood falling back, framing her face and making it look white.
</p><p>"None else dare go," she said; "none else dare go, Gerald. Such places
are so hideous and so noisome, and yet there are those who are born and
die there, bound hand and foot when they are born, that they may be
bound hand and foot to die!" She rose as if she did not know she moved,
and stood up before him, her hand upon her breast.
</p><p>"'Tis such as I should go," she said, "I who am happy and
beloved--after all--after all! 'Tis such as I who should go, and carry
love and pity--love and pity!" And she seemed Love's self and Pity's
self, and stood transfigured.
</p><p>"You are a saint," he cried; "and yet I am afraid. Ah! how could any
harm you?"
</p><p>"I am so great and strong," she said, in a still voice, "none could
harm me if they would. I am not as other women. And I do not know fear.
See!" and she held out her arm. "I am a Wildairs--built of iron and
steel. If in a struggle I held aught in my hand and struck at a man--"
her arm fell at her side suddenly as if some horrid thought had swept
across her soul, like a blighting blast. She turned white and sank upon
her low seat, covering her face with her hands. Then she looked up with
awed eyes. "If one who was so strong," she said, "should strike at a
man in anger, he might strike him dead--unknowing--dead!"
</p><p>"'Tis not a thing to think of," said his Grace, and shuddered a little.
</p><p>"But he would think of it," she said, "all his life through and bear it
on his soul." And she shuddered, too, and in her eyes was the old look
which sometimes haunted them. Surely, he thought, Nature had never
before made a woman's eyes so to answer to her lover's and her lord's.
They were so warm and full of all a man's soul most craved for. He had
seen them flash fire like Juno's, he had seen tears well up into them
as if she had been a tender girl, he had seen them laugh like a
child's, he had seen them brood over him as a young dove's might brood
over her mate, but this look was unlike any other, and was as if she
thought on some dark thing in another world--so far away that her
mind's vision could scarce reach it, and yet could not refrain from
turning towards its shadow.
</p><p>But this was but a cloud which his love-words and nearness could
dispel. This she herself told him on a time when he spoke to her of it.
</p><p>"When you see it," she said, "come and tell me that you love me, and
that there is naught can come between our souls. As you said the day
you showed me the dear rose, 'Naught can come between'--and love is
more than all."
</p><p>"But that you know," he answered.
</p><p>Life is so full of joys for those who love and, being mated, are given
by their good fortunes the power to live as their hearts lead them.
These two were given all things, it seemed to the world which looked
on. From one of their estates to the other they went with the changing
seasons, and with them carried happiness and peace. Her Grace, of whom
the villagers had heard such tales as made them feel that they should
tremble before the proud glance of her dark eyes, found that their last
Duchess, whose eyes had been like violets, could smile no more sweetly.
This one was somehow the more majestic lady of the two, being taller
and having a higher bearing by Nature, but none among them had ever
beheld one who was more a woman and seemed so well to understand a
woman's heart and ways. Where had she learned it, they wondered among
themselves, as others had wondered the year when, as my Lady
Dunstanwolde, she had been guest at Camylott, and in the gipsy's
encampment had carried, so soft and tenderly, the little gipsy child in
her arms. Where had she learned it?
</p><p>"Gerald," she said once to her husband, and pressed her hand against
her heart, "'twas always here--<u>here</u>, lying hid, when none knew
it--when I did not know it myself. When I seemed but a hard, wild
creature, having only men for friends--I was a woman then, and used
sometimes to sit and stare at the red coals of the fire, or the red sun
going down on the moors, and feel longings and pities and sadness I
knew not the meaning of. And often, suddenly, I was made angry by them
and would spring up and walk away that I might be troubled no more. But
'twas Nature crying out in me that I was a woman and could be naught
else."
</p><p>Her love and tenderness for her sister, Mistress Anne, increased, it
seemed, hour by hour.
</p><p>"At Camylott, at Marlowell, at Roxholm, at Paulyn, and at Mertoun," she
had said when she was married, "we must have an apartment which is
Anne's. She is my saint and I must keep a niche for her in every house
and set her in it to be worshipped."
</p><p>And so it was, to whichsoever of their homes they went, Mistress Anne
went with them and found always her own nest warm to receive her.
</p><p>"It makes me feel audacious, sister," she used to say at first, "to go
from one grand house to the other and be led to Mistress Anne's
apartments, in each, and they always prepared and waiting as if 'twere
I who were a Duchess."
</p><p>"You are Anne! You are Anne!" said her Grace, and kissed her fondly.
</p><p>Sometimes she was like a gay and laughing girl, and set all the place
alight with her witcheries; she invented entertainments for their
guests, games and revels for the villagers, and was the spirit of all.
In one of their retrospective hours, Osmonde had told her of the
thoughts he had dreamed on, as they had ridden homeward from the
encampment of the gipsies--of his fancies of the comrade she would make
for a man who lived a roving life. She had both laughed and wept over
the story, clinging to his breast as she had told her own, and of her
fear of his mere glance at her in those dark days, and that she had not
dared to sit alone but kept near her lord's side lest she should
ponder and remember what 'twas honest she should forget.
</p><p>But afterwards she planned, for their fanciful pleasure, rambling long
jaunts when they rode or walked unattended, and romanced like children,
eating their simple food under broad greenwood trees or on the wide
moors with a whole world of heather, as it seemed, rolled out before
them.
</p><p>On such a journey, setting out from London one bright morning, they
rode through Essex and stopped by chance at a little village inn. 'Twas
the village of Wickben, and on the signboard which hung swinging on a
post before the small thatched house of entertainment was painted a
brown cow.
</p><p>None knew 'twas a Duke and his Duchess who dismounted and entered the
place. They had made sure that by their attire none could suspect them
of being more than ordinary travellers, modest enough to patronise a
humble place.
</p><p>"But Lord, what a fine pair!" said the old fellow who was the landlord.
"Adam and Eve may have been such when God first made man and woman, and
had stuff in plenty to build them."
</p><p>He was an aged man and talkative, and being eager for a chance to wag
his tongue and hear travellers' adventures, attended them closely. He
gave them their simple repast himself in small room, and as he moved
to and fro fell to gossiping, emboldened by their friendly gayety of
speech and by her Grace's smiling eyes.
</p><p>"Your ladyship," he began at first, in somewhat awkward, involuntary
homage.
</p><p>"Nay, gaffer, I am no ladyship," she answered, with Clo Wildairs's
unceremonious air. "I am but a gipsy woman in good luck for a day, and
my man is a gipsy, too, though his skin is fairer than mine. We are
going to join our camp near Camylott village. These horses are not ours
but borrowed--honestly. Is't not so, John Merton?" And she so laughed
at his Grace with her big, saucy eyes, that he wished he had been
indeed a gipsy man and could have kissed her openly.
</p><p>"Art the Gipsies' queen?" asked the old man, bewitched by her.
</p><p>"Not she," answered his Grace, "but a plain gipsy wench who makes
baskets and tells fortunes--for all her good looks. Thou'rt flattering
her, old fellow. All the men flatter her."
</p><p>"'Tis well there are some to flatter me," said her Grace, showing her
white teeth. "Thou dost not. But 'tis always so when a poor woman weds
a man and tramps by the side of him instead of keeping him at her
feet."
</p><p>And then they led their old host on to talk, and told him stories of
what gipsies did, and of their living in tents and sleeping in the
open, and of the ill-luck which sometimes befel them when the lord of
the manor they camped on was a hard man and evil tempered.
</p><p>"'Tis a Duke who rules over Camylott, is't not?" the old fellow asked.
</p><p>"Ay," was her Grace's answer, nodding her head. "He is well enough, but
his lady--Lord! but they tell that she was a vixen before her marriage
a few years gone!"
</p><p>"I have seen her," said his Grace. "She is not ill to look at, and has
done us no harm yet."
</p><p>"Ay, but she may," says her Grace, nodding wisely again. "Who knows
what such a woman may turn out. I have seen <u>him</u>!" She stopped, her
elbows on the little round wooden table, her chin on her hands, and
gave her saucy stare again. "I'll pay thee a compliment," she said. "He
is a big fellow, and not unlike thee--though he be Duke and thou naught
but a vagabond gipsy."
</p><p>Their host had hearkened to them eagerly, and now he put in a question.
"Was not she the beauty that was married to an old Earl who left her
widow?" he said. "Was not she Countess Dunstanwolde?"
</p><p>"Ay," answered her Grace, quietly.
</p><p>"Ecod!" cried the old fellow, "that minds me of a story, and 'twas a
thing happened in this very house and room. Look there!"
</p><p>He pointed with something like excitement to the window. 'Twas but
seldom he had chance to tell his story, and 'twas a thing he dearly
loved to do, life being but a dull thing at the Cow at Wickben, and few
travellers passing that way. A pair so friendly and gay and ready to
hearken to his chatter as these two he had not seen for years.
</p><p>"Look there!" he said. "At that big hole in the wall."
</p><p>They turned together and looked at it in some wonder that her ladyship
of Dunstanwolde should have any connection with it. 'Twas indeed a big
hole, and looked as if the plaster of the wall under the sill had been
roughly broken and hacked.
</p><p>"Ay," said the host, "'tis a queer thing and came here in a strange
way, being made by a gentleman's sword, and he either wild with liquor
or with rage. Never shall I forget hearing his horse's hoofs come
tearing over the road, as if some man was riding for his life. I was
abed, and started out of my sleep at the sound of it. 'Who's chased by
the devil at this time o' night through Wickben village?' says I, and
scarce were the words out of my mouth before the horse clatters up to
the house and stops. I could hear him panting and heaving as his rider
gets off and strides up to bang on the door. 'What dost thou want?'
says I, putting my head out of the window. 'Come down and let me in,'
answers he; 'I have no time to spare. You have a thing in your house I
would find.' 'Twas a gentleman's voice, and I saw 'twas a gentleman's
dress he wore, for 'twas fine cloth, and his sword had a silvered
scabbard, and his hat rich plumes. 'Come down,' says he, and bangs the
door again, so down I went."
</p><p>"Who was he?" asked her Grace slowly, for he had stopped for breath.
She sat quite still as before, her round chin held in her hands, her
eyes fixed on him, but there was no longer any laughter in their
blackness. "Did he tell his name?"
</p><p>"Not then," was the answer; "nor did he know I heard when he spoke it,
breaking forth in anger. But that is to come later"--with the air of
one who would have his tale heard to the most dramatic advantage. "Into
this room he strides and to the window straight and looks below the
sill. 'Four years ago,' says he, 'there was a hole here in the wall.
Was't so or was't not?' and he looks at me sharp and fierce as if he
would take me by the throat if I said there had been none. 'Ay, there
was a hole there long enough,' I answers him, 'but 'twas mended with
new plaster at last. Your lordship can see the patch, for 'twas but
roughly done.' Then he goes close to it and stares. 'Ay,' says he,
'there has been a hole mended. Old Chris did not lie.' And on that he
turns to me. 'Get out of the room,' he says, 'I have a search to make
here. Your wall will want another patch when I am done,' he says. 'But
'twill be made good. Go thy ways.' And he draws out his hanger, and
there was sweat on his brow and he breathed fast, as if he was wild
with his anxiousness to find what he sought."
</p><p>"And didst leave him?" asked her Grace, as quiet as before. "For how
long?"
</p><p>The old man grinned.
</p><p>"Not for long," said he, "nor did I go far. I stood outside, where I
could see through the crack o' the door."
</p><p>The Duchess nodded with an unmoved face.
</p><p>"He was like a man in a frenzy," the host went on. "He dug at the
plaster till I thought his sword would break; he dug as if he were paid
for it by the minute. He made a hole bigger than had been there before,
and when 'twas made he thrusts his hand in and fumbles about, cursing
under his breath. And of a sudden he gives a start and stops and pants
for breath, and then draws his hand back, and it was bloody, being
scratched by the stone and plaster, but he held somewhat in it, a
little dusty package, and he clutches it to his breast and laughs
outright. Good Lord, 'twas like a devil's laugh, 'twas so wild and
joyful. 'Ha, ha!' cries he, shaking the thing in the air and stamping
his foot, 'Jack Oxon comes to his own again, to his own!'"
</p><p>"Then," says her Grace, more slowly still, "that was his name? I have
heard it before."
</p><p>"I heard it again," said the old story-teller, eager to reach his
climax. "And 'tis that ends the story so finely. 'Twas by chance talk
of travellers I heard it nigh six months later. The very day after he
stood here and searched for his package he disappeared from sight and
has not been heard of since. And the last who set eyes on him was my
Lady Dunstanwolde, who is now a Duchess at Camylott, where your camp
is. 'Twas her name brought the story back to me."
</p><p>Her Grace rose, catching her breath with a laugh. She turned her face
towards the window, as if, of a sudden, attracted by somewhat to be
seen outside.
</p><p>"'Tis a good story," she said, but for a moment the crimson roses on
her cheeks had shuddered to whiteness. Why, no man could tell. Her host
did not see her countenance--perhaps my lord Duke did not.
</p><p>"'Tis a good story!" she laughed again.
</p><p>"And well told," added my lord Duke.
</p><p>Her Grace turned to them both once more. Through some wondrous exercise
of her will she looked herself again.
</p><p>"As we are in luck to-day," she said, "and it has passed the time, let
us count it in the reckoning."
</p><p>A new, almost wild, fantastic gayety seized her. She flung herself into
her playing of the part of a gipsy woman with a spirit which was a
marvel to behold. She searched his Grace's pockets and her own for
pence, and counted up the reckoning on the table, saying that they
could but afford this or that much, that they must save this coin for a
meal, that for a bed, this to pay toll on the road. She used such
phrases of the gipsy jargon as she had picked up, and made jokes and
bantering speeches which set their host cackling with laughter. Osmonde
had seen her play a fantastic part before on their whimsical holidays,
but never one which suited her so well, and in which she seemed so full
of fire and daring wit. She was no Duchess, a man might have sworn, but
a tall, splendid, black-eyed laughing gipsy woman, who, to the man who
was her partner, would be a fortune every day, and a fortune not of
luck alone, but of gay spirit and bravery and light-hearted love.
</p>
<p>That night the moon shone white and clear, and in the mid hours my lord
Duke waked from his sleep suddenly, and saw the brightness streaming
full through the oriel window, and in the fair flood of it his love's
white figure kneeling.
</p><p>"Gerald," she cried, clinging to him when he went to her. "'Twas I
awaked you. I called, though I did not speak."
</p><p>"I heard, as I should hear if I lay dead," he answered low.
</p><p>Her hair was all unbound for the night--her black, wondrous hair which
he so loved--and from its billowy cloud her face looked at him wild and
white, her mouth quivering.
</p><p>"Gerald," she said, "look out with me."
</p><p>Together they looked forth from the wide window into the beauty of the
night, up into the great vault of Heaven, where the large silver moon
sailed in the blue, the stars shining faintly before her soft
brilliance.
</p><p>"We are Pagans," she said, "poor Pagans who oftenest seem to pray to a
cruel thing we do not know but only crouch before in terror, lest it
crush us. But when we look up into such a Heaven as this, its majesty
and stillness seem a presence, and we dare to utter what our hearts cry
out, and know we shall be heard." She caught his hand and held it to
her heart, which he felt leap beneath it. "There is no power would harm
a woman's child," she cried--"a little unborn thing which has not
breathed--because it would wreak vengeance on herself! There is none,
Gerald, is there?" And she clung to him, her uplifted face filled with
such lovely, passionate, woman's fear and pleading as made him sweep
her to his breast and hold her silently--because he could not speak.
</p><p>"For I have learned to be afraid," she murmured brokenly, against his
breast. "And I was kneeling here to pray--to pray with all my
soul--that if there were so cruel a thing 'twould <u>kill</u> me
now--blight me--take me from you--that I might die in torture--but not
bring suffering on my love, and on an innocent thing."
</p><p>And her heart beat like some terrified caged eaglet against his own,
and her eyes were wild with woe. But the wondrous stillness of the deep
night enfolded them, as if Nature held them in her great arms which
comfort so. And her stars gazed calmly down, even as though their
calmness were answering speech.
