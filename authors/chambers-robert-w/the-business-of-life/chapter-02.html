<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Desboro arrived in town on a late train. It was raining, so he
drove to his rooms, exchanged his overcoat for a raincoat, and
went out into the downpour again, undisturbed, disdaining an umbrella.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour's vigorous walking he came to the celebrated
antique shop of Louis Nevers, and entered, letting in a gust of
wind and rain at his heels.</p>

<p>Everywhere in the semi-gloom of the place objects loomed mysteriously,
their outlines lost in shadow except where, here and there, a
gleam of wintry daylight touched a jewel or fell across some gilded
god, lotus-throned, brooding alone.</p>

<p>When Desboro's eyes became accustomed to the obscurity, he saw
that there was armour there, complete suits, Spanish and Milanese,
and an odd Morion or two; and there were jewels in old-time settings,
tapestries, silver, ivories, Hispano-Moresque lustre, jades, crystals.</p>

<p>The subdued splendour of Chinese and Japanese armour, lacquered
in turquoise, and scarlet and gold, glimmered on lay figures masked
by grotesque helmets; an Ispahan rug, softly luminous, trailed
across a table beside him, and on it lay a dead Sultan's scimitar,
curved like the new moon, its slim blade inset with magic characters,
the hilt wrought as delicately as the folded frond of a fern,
graceful, exquisite, gem-incrusted.</p>

<p>There were a few people about the shop, customers and clerks,
moving shapes in the dull light. Presently a little old salesman
wearing a skull cap approached him.</p>

<p>"Rainy weather for Christmas week, sir. Can I be of service?"</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Desboro. "I came here by appointment on a matter
of private business."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. I think Miss Nevers is not engaged. Kindly give
me your card and I will find out."</p>

<p>"But I wish to see Mr. Nevers himself."</p>

<p>"Mr. Nevers is dead, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! I didn't know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Mr. Nevers died two years ago." And, as Desboro remained
silent and thoughtful: "Perhaps you might wish to see Miss Nevers?
She has charge of everything now, including all our confidential
affairs."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Desboro pleasantly, "but this is an affair requiring
personal judgment and expert advice&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I understand, sir. The gentlemen who came to see Mr. Nevers
about matters requiring expert opinions now consult Miss Nevers
personally."</p>

<p>"Who is <em>Miss</em> Nevers?"</p>

<p>"His daughter, sir." He added, with quaint pride: "The great
jewelers of Fifth Avenue consult her; experts in our business
often seek her advice. The Museum authorities have been pleased
to speak highly of her monograph on Hurtado de Mendoza."</p>

<p>Desboro hesitated for a moment, then gave his card to the old
salesman, who trotted away with it down the unlighted vista of
the shop.</p>

<p>The young man's pleasantly indifferent glance rested on one object
after another, not unintelligently, but without particular interest.
Yet there were some very wonderful and very rare and beautiful
things to be seen in the celebrated shop of the late Jean Louis
Nevers.</p>

<p>So he stood, leaning on his walking stick, the upturned collar
of his raincoat framing a face which was too colourless and worn
for a man of his age; and presently the little old salesman came
trotting back, the tassel on his neat silk cap bobbing with every
step.</p>

<p>"Miss Nevers will be very glad to see you in her private office.
This way, if you please, sir."</p>

<p>Desboro followed to the rear of the long, dusky shop, turned
to the left through two more rooms full of shadowy objects dimly
discerned, then traversed a tiled passage to where electric lights
burned over a doorway.</p>

<p>The old man opened the door; Desboro entered and found himself
in a square picture gallery, lighted from above, and hung all
around with dark velvet curtains to protect the pictures on sale.
As he closed the door behind him a woman at a distant desk turned
her head, but remained seated, pen poised, looking across the
room at him as he advanced. Her black gown blended so deceptively
with the hangings that at first he could distinguish only the
white face and throat and hands against the shadows behind her.</p>

<p>"Will you kindly announce me to Miss Nevers?" he said, looking
around for a chair.</p>

<p>"I am Miss Nevers."</p>

<p>She closed the ledger in which she had been writing, laid aside
her pen and rose. As she came forward he found himself looking
at a tall girl, slim to thinness, except for the rounded oval
of her face under a loose crown of yellow hair, from which a stray
lock sagged untidily, curling across her cheek.</p>

<p>He thought: "A blue-stocking prodigy of learning, with her hair
in a mess, and painted at that." But he said politely, yet with
that hint of idle amusement in his voice which often sounded through
his speech with women:</p>

<p>"Are you the Miss Nevers who has taken over this antique business,
and who writes monographs on Hurtado de Mendoza?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You appear to be very young to succeed such a distinguished
authority as your father, Miss Nevers."</p>

<p>His observation did not seem to disturb her, nor did the faintest
hint of mockery in his pleasant voice. She waited quietly for
him to state his business.</p>

<p>He said: "I came here to ask somebody's advice about engaging
an expert to appraise and catalogue my collection."</p>

<p>And even while he was speaking he was conscious that never before
had he seen such a white skin and such red lips&mdash;if they were
natural. And he began to think that they might be.</p>

<p>He said, noticing the bright lock astray on her cheek once more:</p>

<p>"I suppose that I may speak to you in confidence&mdash;just as I would
have spoken to your father."</p>

<p>She was still looking at him with the charm of youthful inquiry
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Certainly," she said.</p>

<p>She glanced down at his card which still lay on her blotter,
stood a moment with her hand resting on the desk, then indicated
a chair at her elbow and seated herself.</p>

<p>He took the chair.</p>

<p>"I wrote you that I'd drop in sometime this week. The note was
directed to your father. I did not know he was not living."</p>

<p>"You are the Mr. Desboro who owns the collection of armour?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I am that James Philip Desboro who lives at Silverwood," he
said. "Evidently you have heard of the Desboro collection of arms
and armour."</p>

<p>"Everybody has, I think."</p>

<p>He said, carelessly: "Museums, amateur collectors, and students
know it, and I suppose most dealers in antiques have heard of
it."</p>

<p>"Yes, all of them, I believe."</p>

<p>"My house," he went on, "Silverwood, is in darkest Westchester,
and my recent grandfather, who made the collection, built a wing
to contain it. It's there as he left it. My father made no additions
to it. Nor," he added, "have I. Now I want to ask you whether
a lot of those things have not increased in value since my grandfather's
day?"</p>

<p>"No doubt."</p>

<p>"And the collection is valuable?"</p>

<p>"I think it must be&mdash;very."</p>

<p>"And to determine its value I ought to have an expert go there
and catalogue it and appraise it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Who? That's what I've come here to find out."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you might wish us to do it."</p>

<p>"Is that still part of your business?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, after a moment's thought, "I am going to sell
the Desboro collection."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry!" she exclaimed, under her breath; and looked
up to find him surprised and beginning to be amused again.</p>

<p>"Your attitude is not very professional&mdash;for a dealer in antiques,"
he said quizzically.</p>

<p>"I am something else, too, Mr. Desboro." She had flushed a little,
not responding to his lighter tone.</p>

<p>"I am very sure you are," he said. "Those who really know about
and care for such collections must feel sorry to see them dispersed."</p>

<p>"I had hoped that the Museum might have the Desboro collection
some day," she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>He said: "I am sorry it is not to be so," and had the grace to
redden a trifle.</p>

<p>She played with her pen, waiting for him to continue; and she
was so young, and fresh, and pretty that he was in no hurry to
finish. Besides, there was something about her face that had been
interesting him&mdash;an expression which made him think sometimes
that she was smiling, or on the verge of it. But the slightly
upcurled corners of her mouth had been fashioned so by her Maker,
or perhaps had become so from some inborn gaiety of heart, leaving
a faint, sweet imprint on her lips.</p>

<p>To watch her was becoming a pleasure. He wondered what her smile
might be like&mdash;all the while pretending an absent-minded air which
cloaked his idle curiosity.</p>

<p>She waited, undisturbed, for him to come to some conclusion.
And all the while he was thinking that her lips were perhaps just
a trifle too full&mdash;that there was more of Aphrodite in her face
than of any saint he remembered; but her figure was thin enough
for any saint. Perhaps a course of banquets&mdash;perhaps a régime
under a diet list warranted to improve&#11834;</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the Desboro collection, Miss Nevers?" he asked
vaguely.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What expert will you send to catalogue and appraise it?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> could go."</p>

<p>"You!" he said, surprised and smiling.</p>

<p>"That is my profession."</p>

<p>"I knew, of course, that it was your father's. But I never supposed
that you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Did you wish to have an appraisement made, Mr. Desboro?" she
interrupted dryly.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I suppose so. Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to ask
for anything."</p>

<p>"Have you really decided to sell that superb collection?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"What else can I do?" he inquired gayly. "I suppose the Museum
ought to have it, but I can't afford to give it away or to keep
it. In other words&mdash;and brutal ones &mdash;I need money."</p>

<p>She said gravely: "I am sorry."</p>

<p>And he knew she didn't mean that she was sorry because he needed
money, but because the Museum was not to have the arms, armour,
jades, and ivories. Yet, somehow, her "I am sorry" sounded rather
sweet to him.</p>

<p>For a while he sat silent, one knee crossed over the other, twisting
the silver crook of his stick. From moment to moment she raised
her eyes from the blotter to let them rest inquiringly on him,
then went on tracing arabesques over her blotter with an inkless
pen. One slender hand was bracketed on her hip, and he noticed
the fingers, smooth and rounded as a child's. Nor could he keep
his eyes from her profile, with its delicate, short nose, ever
so slightly arched, and its lips, just a trifle too sensuous&mdash;and
that soft lock astray again against her cheek. No, her hair was
not dyed, either. And it was as though she divined his thought,
for she looked up suddenly from her blotter and he instantly gazed
elsewhere, feeling guilty and impertinent&mdash;sentiments not often
experienced by that young man.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do, Miss Nevers," he concluded, "I'll
write you a letter to my housekeeper, Mrs. Quant. Shall I? And
you'll go up and look over the collection and let me know what
you think of it!"</p>

<p>"Do you not expect to be there?"</p>

<p>"Ought I to be?"</p>

<p>"I really can't answer you, but it seems to me rather important
that the owner of a collection should be present when the appraiser
begins work."</p>

<p>"The fact is," he said, "I'm booked for a silly shooting trip.
I'm supposed to start to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you had better write the letter. My full name is
Jacqueline Nevers&mdash;if you require it. You may use my desk."</p>

<p>She rose; he thanked her, seated himself, and began a letter
to Mrs. Quant, charging her to admit, entertain, and otherwise
particularly cherish one Miss Jacqueline Nevers, and give her
the keys to the armoury.</p>

<p>While he was busy, Jacqueline Nevers paced the room backward
and forward, her pretty head thoughtfully bent, hands clasped
behind her, moving leisurely, absorbed in her cogitations.</p>

<p>Desboro ended his letter and sat for a moment watching her until,
happening to glance at him, she discovered his idleness.</p>

<p>"Have you finished?" she asked.</p>

<p>A trifle out of countenance he rose and explained that he had,
and laid the letter on her blotter. Realising that she was expecting
him to take his leave, he also realised that he didn't want to.
And he began to spar with Destiny for time.</p>

<p>"I suppose this matter will require several visits from you,"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, several."</p>

<p>"It takes some time to catalogue and appraise such a collection,
doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She answered him very sweetly but impersonally, and there seemed
to be in her brief replies no encouragement for him to linger.
So he started to pick up his hat, thinking as fast as he could
all the while; and his facile wits saved him at the last moment.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word!" he exclaimed. "Do you know that you and
I have not yet discussed terms?"</p>

<p>"We make our usual charges," she said.</p>

<p>"And what are those?"</p>

<p>She explained briefly.</p>

<p>"That is for cataloguing and appraising only?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And if you sell the collection?"</p>

<p>"We take our usual commission."</p>

<p>"And you think you <em>can</em> sell it for me?"</p>

<p>"I'll have to&mdash;won't I?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "But <em>can</em> you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>As the curt affirmative fell from her lips, suddenly, under all
her delicate, youthful charm, Desboro divined the note of hidden
strength, the self-confidence of capability&mdash;oddly at variance
with her allure of lovely immaturity. Yet he might have surmised
it, for though her figure was that of a girl, her face, for all
its soft, fresh beauty, was a woman's, and already firmly moulded
in noble lines which even the scarlet fulness of the lips could
not deny. For if she had the mouth of Aphrodite, she had her brow,
also.</p>

<p>He had not been able to make her smile, although the upcurled
corners of her mouth seemed always to promise something. He wondered
what her expression might be like when animated&mdash;even annoyed.
And his idle curiosity led him on to the edges of impertinence.</p>

<p>"May I say something that I have in mind and not offend you?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you wish." She lifted her eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you think you are old enough and experienced enough to catalogue
and appraise such an important collection as this one? I thought
perhaps you might prefer not to take such a responsibility upon
yourself, but would rather choose to employ some veteran expert."</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"Have I offended you?"</p>

<p>She walked slowly to the end of the room, turned, and, passing
him a third time, looked up at him and laughed&mdash;a most enchanting
little laugh&mdash;a revelation as delightful as it was unexpected.</p>

<p>"I believe you really <em>want</em> to do it yourself!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"<em>Want</em> to? I'm dying to! I don't think there is anything
in the world I had rather try!" she said, with a sudden flush
and sparkle of recklessness that transfigured her. "Do you suppose
anybody in my business would willingly miss the chance of personally
handling such a transaction? Of <em>course</em> I want to. Not
only because it would be a most creditable transaction for this
house&mdash;not only because it would be a profitable business undertaking,
but"&mdash;and the swift, engaging smile parted her lips once more&mdash;"in
a way I feel as though my own ability had been questioned&#11834;"</p>

<p>"By me?" he protested. "Did I actually dare question your ability?"</p>

<p>"Something very like it. So, naturally, I would seize an opportunity
to vindicate myself&mdash;if you offer it&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I do offer it," he said.</p>

<p>"I accept."</p>

<p>There was a moment's indecisive silence. He picked up his hat
and stick, lingering still; then:</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Miss Nevers. When are you going up to Silverwood?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if it is quite convenient."</p>

<p>"Entirely. I may be there. Perhaps I can fix it&mdash;put off that
shooting party for a day or two."</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"I hope so, too."</p>

<p>He walked reluctantly toward the door, turned and came all the
way back.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had rather I remained away from Silverwood."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"But, of course," he said, "there is a nice old housekeeper there,
and a lot of servants&#11834;"</p>

<p>She laughed. "Thank you very much, Mr. Desboro. It is very nice
of you, but I had not considered that at all. Business women must
disregard such conventions, if they're to compete with men. I'd
like you to be there, because I may have questions to ask."</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;it's very good of you. I &mdash;I'll try to be there&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Because I might have some very important questions to ask you,"
she repeated.</p>

<p>"Of course. I've got to be there. Haven't I?"</p>

<p>"It might be better for your interests."</p>

<p>"Then I'll be there. Well, good-bye, Miss Nevers."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mr. Desboro."</p>

<p>"And thank you for undertaking it," he said cordially.</p>

<p>"Thank <em>you</em> for asking me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm &mdash;I'm really delighted. It's most kind of <em>you</em>.
<em>Good</em>-bye, Miss Nevers."</p>

<p>"<em>Good</em>-bye, Mr. Desboro."</p>

<p>He had to go that time; and he went still retaining a confused
vision of blue eyes and vivid lips, and of a single lock of hair
astray once more across a smooth, white cheek.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Jacqueline seated herself at her desk and picked
up her pen. She remained so for a while, then emerged abruptly
from a fit of abstraction and sorted some papers unnecessarily.
When she had arranged them to her fancy, she rearranged them.
Then the little Louis <em>XVI </em>desk interested her, and she
examined the inset placques of flowered Sèvres in detail, as though
the little desk of tulip, satinwood and walnut had not stood there
since she was a child.</p>

<p>Later she noticed his card on her blotter; and, face framed in
her hands, she studied it so long that the card became a glimmering
white patch and vanished; and before her remote gaze his phantom
grew out of space, seated there in the empty chair beside her&mdash;the
loosened collar of his raincoat revealing to her the most attractive
face of any man she had ever looked upon in her twenty-two years
of life.</p>

<p>Toward evening the electric lamps were lighted in the shop; rain
fell more heavily outside; few people entered. She was busy with
ledgers and files of old catalogues recording auction sales, the
name of the purchaser and the prices pencilled on the margins
in her father's curious handwriting. Also her card index aided
her. Under the head of "Desboro" she was able to note what objects
of interest or of art her father had bought for her recent visitor's
grandfather, and the prices paid&mdash;little, indeed, in those days,
compared with what the same objects would now bring. And, continuing
her search, she finally came upon an uncompleted catalogue of
the Desboro collection. It was in manuscript&mdash;her father's peculiar
French chirography&mdash;neat and accurate as far as it went.</p>

<p>Everything bearing upon the Desboro collection she bundled together
and strapped with rubber bands; then, one by one, the clerks and
salesmen came to report to her before closing up. She locked the
safe, shut her desk, and went out to the shop, where she remained
until the shutters were clamped and the last salesman had bade
her a cheery good night. Then, bolting the door and double-locking
it, she went back along the passage and up the stairs, where she
had the two upper floors to herself, and a cook and chambermaid
to keep house for her.</p>

<p>In the gaslight of the upper apartment she seemed even more slender
than by daylight&mdash;her eyes bluer, her lips more scarlet. She glanced
into the mirror of her dresser as she passed, pausing to twist
up the unruly lock that had defied her since childhood.</p>

<p>Everywhere in the room Christmas was still in evidence&mdash;a tiny
tree, with frivolous, glittering things still twisted and suspended
among the branches, calendars, sachets, handkerchiefs still gaily
tied in ribbons, flowering shrubs swathed in tissue and bows of
tulle&mdash;these from her salesmen, and she had carefully but pleasantly
maintained the line of demarcation by presenting each with a gold
piece.</p>

<p>But there were other gifts&mdash;gloves and stockings, and bon-bons,
and books, from the friends who were girls when she too was a
child at school; and a set of volumes from Cary Clydesdale whose
collection of jades she was cataloguing. The volumes were very
beautiful and expensive. The gift had surprised her.</p>

<p>Among her childhood friends was her social niche; the circumference
of their circle the limits of her social environment. They came
to her and she went to them; their pastimes and pleasures were
hers; and if there was not, perhaps, among them her intellectual
equal, she had not yet felt the need of such companionship, but
had been satisfied to have them hold her as a good companion who
otherwise possessed much strange and perhaps useless knowledge
quite beyond their compass. And she was shyly content with her
intellectual isolation.</p>

<p>So, amid these people, she had found a place prepared for her
when she emerged from childhood. What lay outside of this circle
she surmised with the intermittent curiosity of ignorance, or
of a bystander who watches a pageant for a moment and hastens
on, preoccupied with matters more familiar.</p>

<p>All young girls think of pleasures; she had thought of them always
when the day's task was ended, and she had sought them with all
the ardour of youth, with a desire unwearied, and a thirst unquenched.</p>

<p>In her, mental and physical pleasure were wholesomely balanced;
the keen delight of intellectual experience, the happiness of
research and attainment, went hand in hand with a rather fastidious
appetite for having the best time that circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>She danced when she had a chance, went to theatres and restaurants
with her friends, bathed at Manhattan in summer, when gay parties
were organised, and did the thousand innocent things that thousands
of young business girls do whose lines are cast in the metropolis.</p>

<p>Since her father's death she had been intensely lonely; only
a desperate and steady application to business had pulled her
through the first year without a breakdown.</p>

<p>The second year she rejoined her friends and went about again
with them. Now, the third year since her father's death was already
dawning; and her last prayer as the old year died had been that
the new one would bring her friends and happiness.</p>

<p>Seated before the wood fire in her bedroom, leisurely undressing,
she thought of Desboro and the business that concerned him. He
was so very good looking&mdash;in the out-world manner&mdash;the manner
of those who dwelt outside her orbit.</p>

<p>She had not been very friendly with him at first. She had wanted
to be; instinct counselled reserve, and she had listened&mdash;until
the very last. He had a way of laughing at her in every word&mdash;in
even an ordinary business conversation. She had been conscious
all the while of his half-listless interest in her, of an idle
curiosity, which, before it had grown offensive, had become friendly
and at times almost boyish in its naïve self-disclosure. And it
made her smile to remember how very long it took him to take his
leave.</p>

<p>But&mdash;a man of that kind&mdash;a man of the out-world&mdash;with the <em>something</em>
in his face that betrays shadows which she had never seen cast&mdash;and
never would see&mdash;<em>he</em> was no boy. For in his face was the
faint imprint of that pallid wisdom which warned. Women in his
own world might ignore the warning; perhaps it did not menace
them. But instinct told her that it might be different outside
that world.</p>

<p>She nestled into her fire-warmed bath-robe and sat pensively
fitting and refitting her bare feet into her slippers.</p>

<p>Men were odd; alike and unalike. Since her father's death, she
had had to be careful. Wealthy gentlemen, old and young, amateurs
of armour, ivories, porcelains, jewels, all clients of her father,
had sometimes sent for her too many times on too many pretexts;
and sometimes their paternal manner toward her had made her uncomfortable.
Desboro was of that same caste. Perhaps he was not like them otherwise.</p>

<p>When she had bathed and dressed, she dined alone, not having
any invitation for the evening. After dinner she talked on the
telephone to her little friend, Cynthia Lessler, whose late father's
business had been to set jewels and repair antique watches and
clocks. Incidentally, he drank and chased his daughter about with
a hatchet until she fled for good one evening, which afforded
him an opportunity to drink himself very comfortably to death
in six months.</p>

<p>"Hello, Cynthia!" called Jacqueline, softly.</p>

<p>"Hello! Is it you, Jacqueline, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't you want to come over and eat chocolates and gossip?"</p>

<p>"Can't do it. I'm just starting for the hall."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd finished rehearsing."</p>

<p>"I've got to be on hand all the same. How are you, sweetness,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"Blooming, my dear. I'm crazy to tell you about my good luck.
I have a splendid commission with which to begin the new year."</p>

<p>"Good for you! What is it?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you yet"&mdash;laughingly&mdash;"it's confidential business&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know. Some old, fat man wants you to catalogue his collection."</p>

<p>"No! He isn't fat, either. You <em>are</em> the limit, Cynthia!"</p>

<p>"All the same, look out for him," retorted Cynthia. "<em>I</em>
know man and his kind. Office experience is a liberal education;
the theatre a post-graduate course. Are you coming to the dance
to-morrow night?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I suppose the usual people will be there?"</p>

<p>"Some new ones. There's an awfully good-looking newspaper man
from Yonkers. He has a car in town, too."</p>

<p>Something&mdash;some new and unaccustomed impatience&mdash;she did not
understand exactly what&mdash;prompted Jacqueline to say scornfully:</p>

<p>"His name is Eddie, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>A sudden vision of Desboro, laughing at her under every word
of an unsmiling and commonplace conversation, annoyed her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cynthia, dear, every good-looking man we meet is usually
named Ed and comes from places like Yonkers."</p>

<p>Cynthia, slightly perplexed, said slangily that she didn't "get"
her; and Jacqueline admitted that she herself didn't know what
she had meant.</p>

<p>They gossiped for a while, then Cynthia ended:</p>

<p>"I'll see you to-morrow night, won't I? And listen, you little
white mouse, I get what you mean by 'Eddie'."</p>

<p>"Do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Shall I see you at the dance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and 'Eddie,' too. Good-bye."</p>

<p>Jacqueline laughed again, then shivered slightly and hung up
the receiver.</p>

<p>Back before her bedroom fire once more, Grenville's volume on
ancient armour across her knees, she turned the illuminated pages
absently, and gazed into the flames. What she saw among them apparently
did not amuse her, for after a while she frowned, shrugged her
shoulders, and resumed her reading.</p>

<p>But the XV century knights, in their gilded or silvered harness,
had Desboro's lithe figure, and the lifted vizors of their helmets
always disclosed his face. Shields emblazoned with quarterings,
plumed armets, the golden morions, banner, pennon, embroidered
surtout, and the brilliant trappings of battle horse and palfry,
became only a confused blur of colour under her eyes, framing
a face that looked back at her out of youthful eyes, marred by
the shadow of a wisdom she knew about&mdash;alas&mdash;but did not know.</p>

<p>The man of whom she was thinking had walked back to the club
through a driving rain, still under the fascination of the interview,
still excited by its novelty and by her unusual beauty. He could
not quite account for his exhilaration either, because, in New
York, beauty is anything but unusual among the hundreds of thousands
of young women who work for a living&mdash;for that is one of the seven
wonders of the city&mdash;and it is the rule rather than the exception
that, in this new race which is evolving itself out of an unknown
amalgam, there is scarcely a young face in which some trace of
it is not apparent at a glance.</p>

<p>Which is why, perhaps, he regarded his present exhilaration humorously,
or meant to; perhaps why he chose to think of her as "Stray Lock,"
instead of Miss Nevers, and why he repeated confidently to himself:
"She's thin as a Virgin by the 'Master of the Death of Mary'."
And yet that haunting expression of her face&mdash;the sweetness of
the lips upcurled at the corners&mdash;the surprising and lovely revelation
of her laughter&mdash;these impressions persisted as he swung on through
the rain, through the hurrying throngs just released from shops
and great department stores, and onward up the wet and glimmering
avenue to his destination, which was the Olympian Club.</p>

<p>In the cloak room there were men he knew, being divested of wet
hats and coats; in reading room, card room, lounge, billiard hall,
squash court, and gymnasium, men greeted him with that friendly
punctiliousness which indicates popularity; from the splashed
edge of the great swimming pool men hailed him; clerks and club
servants saluted him smilingly as he sauntered about through the
place, still driven into motion by an inexplicable and unaccustomed
restlessness. Cairns discovered him coming out of the billiard
room:</p>

<p>"Have a snifter?" he suggested affably. "I'll find Ledyard and
play you 'nigger' or 'rabbit' afterward, if you like."</p>

<p>Desboro laid a hand on his friend's shoulder:</p>

<p>"Jack, I've a business engagement at Silverwood to-morrow, and
I believe I'd better go home to-night."</p>

<p>"Heavens! You've just been there! And what about the shooting
trip?"</p>

<p>"I can join you day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Jim, are you going to spoil our card quartette on
the train? Reggie Ledyard will kill you."</p>

<p>"He might, at that," said Desboro pleasantly. "But I've got to
be at Silverwood to-morrow. It's a matter of business, Jack."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> and business! Lord! The amazing alliance! What
are you going to do&mdash;sell a few superannuated Westchester hens
at auction? By heck! You're a fake farmer and a pitiable piker,
that's what <em>you</em> are. And Stuyve Van Alstyne had a wire
to-night that the ducks and geese are coming in to the guns by
millions&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Go ahead and shoot 'em, then! I'll probably be along in time
to pick up the game for you."</p>

<p>"You won't go with us?"</p>

<p>"Not to-morrow. A man can't neglect his own business <em>every</em>
day in the year."</p>

<p>"Then you won't be in Baltimore for the Assembly, and you won't
go to Georgia, and you won't do a thing that you expected to.
Oh, you're the gay, quick-change artist! And don't tell me it's
business, either," he added suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I <em>do</em> tell you exactly that."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that nothing except sheer, dry business keeps
you here?"</p>

<p>The colour slowly settled under Desboro's cheek bones:</p>

<p>"It's a matter with enough serious business in it to keep me
busy to-morrow&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Selecting pearls? In which show and which row does she cavort,
dear friend&mdash;speaking in an exquisitely colloquial metaphor!"</p>

<p>Desboro shrugged: "I'll play you a dozen games of rabbit before
we dress for dinner. Come on, you suspicious sport!"</p>

<p>"Which show?" repeated Cairns obstinately. He did not mean it
literally, footlight affairs being unfashionable. But Desboro's
easy popularity with women originated continual gossip, friendly
and otherwise; and his name was often connected harmlessly with
that of some attractive woman in his own class&mdash;like Mrs. Clydesdale,
for instance&mdash;and sometimes with some pretty unknown in some class
not specified. But the surmise was idle, and the gossip vague,
and neither the one nor the other disturbed Desboro, who continued
to saunter through life keeping his personal affairs pleasantly
to himself.</p>

<p>He linked his arm in Cairns's and guided him toward the billiard
room. But there were no tables vacant for rabbit, which absurd
game, being hard on the cloth, was limited to two decrepit pool
tables.</p>

<p>So Cairns again suggested his celebrated "snifter," and then
the young men separated, Desboro to go across the street to his
elaborate rooms and dress, already a little less interested in
his business trip to Silverwood, already regretting the gay party
bound South for two weeks of pleasure.</p>

<p>And when he had emerged from a cold shower which, with the exception
of sleep, is the wisest counsellor in the world, now that he stood
in fresh linen and evening dress on the threshold of another night,
he began to wonder at his late exhilaration.</p>

<p>To him the approach of every night was always fraught with mysterious
possibilities, and with a belief in Chance forever new. Adventure
dawned with the electric lights; opportunity awoke with the evening
whistles warning all labourers to rest. Opportunity for what?
He did not know; he had not even surmised; but perhaps it was
that <em>something</em>, that subtle, evanescent, volatile <em>something</em>
for which the world itself waits instinctively, and has been waiting
since the first day dawned. Maybe it is happiness for which the
world has waited with patient instinct uneradicated; maybe it
is death; and after all, the two may be inseparable.</p>

<p>Desboro, looking into the coals of a dying fire, heard the clock
striking the hour. The night was before him&mdash;those strange hours
in which anything could happen before another sun gilded the sky
pinnacles of the earth.</p>

<p>Another hour sounded and found him listless, absent-eyed, still
gazing into a dying fire.</p>
