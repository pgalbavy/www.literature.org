<p>With his last words Colonel Race had swung away and left us. I
stood staring after him. Harry’s voice recalled me to myself.
</p>
<p>“Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me.”
</p><p>He took my hand in his and almost mechanically I drew it away.
</p><p>“Why did you deceive me?”
</p><p>“I don’t know that I can make you understand. I was afraid of all
that sort of thing—the power and fascination of wealth. I wanted
you to care for me just for myself—for the man I was—without
ornaments and trappings.”
</p><p>“You mean you didn’t trust me?”
</p><p>“You can put it that way if you like, but it isn’t quite true. I’d
become embittered, suspicious—always prone to look for ulterior
motives—and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you
cared for me.”
</p><p>“I see,” I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story
he had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it
which I had disregarded—an assurance of money, the power to buy
back the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to
speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when
he had said “my friend” he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It
was Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply.
</p><p>“How did it come about?” I asked.
</p><p>“We were both reckless—anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged
identification discs—for luck! Lucas was killed the next day—blown
to pieces.”
</p><p>I shuddered.
</p><p>“But why didn’t you tell me now? This morning? You couldn’t have
doubted my caring for you by this time?”
</p><p>“Anne, I didn’t want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to
the island. What’s the good of money? It can’t buy happiness. We’d
have been happy on the island. I tell you I’m afraid of that other
life—it nearly rotted me through once.”
</p><p>“Did Sir Eustace know who you really were?”
</p><p>“Oh, yes.”
</p><p>“And Carton?”
</p><p>“No. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he
didn’t know which was which. He accepted my statement that I was
Lucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was never afraid
of Lucas. He was a quiet chap—very deep. But I always had the
devil’s own temper. She’d have been scared out of her life if she’d
known that I’d come to life again.”
</p><p>“Harry, if Colonel Race hadn’t told me, what did you mean to do?”
</p><p>“Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.”
</p><p>“And your father’s millions?”
</p><p>“Race was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of
them than I ever shall. Anne, what are you thinking about? You’re
frowning so.”
</p><p>“I’m thinking,” I said slowly, “that I almost wish Colonel Race
hadn’t made you tell me.”
</p><p>“No. He was right. I owed you the truth.”
</p><p>He paused, then said suddenly:
</p><p>“You know, Anne, I’m jealous of Race. He loves you too—and he’s a
bigger man than I am or ever shall be.”
</p><p>I turned to him, laughing.
</p><p>“Harry, you idiot. It’s you I want—and that’s all that matters.”
</p><p>As soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was
waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together.
When the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to
Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that
had belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took
up our abode in it.
</p><p>There we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne
and to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was
to be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details
enormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal.
And sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled—as
though I couldn’t breathe.
</p><p>It was the night before we were to sail. I couldn’t sleep. I was
miserable, and I didn’t know why. I hated leaving Africa. When I
came back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the
same thing again?
</p><p>And then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter. I
sprang up. Harry was on the <u>stoep</u> outside.
</p><p>“Put some clothes on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.”
</p><p>I huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the cool night
air—still and scented, with its velvety feel. Harry beckoned me
out of earshot of the house. His face looked pale and determined
and his eyes were blazing.
</p><p>“Anne, do you remember saying to me once that women enjoyed doing
the things they disliked for the sake of some one they liked?”
</p><p>“Yes,” I said, wondering what was coming.
</p><p>He caught me in his arms.
</p><p>“Anne, come away with me—now—to-night. Back to Rhodesia—back to
the island. I can’t stand all this tomfoolery. I can’t wait for
you any longer.”
</p><p>I disengaged myself a minute.
</p><p>“And what about my French frocks?” I lamented mockingly.
</p><p>To this day Harry never knows when I’m in earnest and when I’m only
teasing him.
</p><p>“Damn your French frocks. Do you think I want to put frocks on you?
I’m a damned sight more likely to want to tear them off you. I’m
not going to let you go, do you hear? You’re my woman. If I let
you go away, I may lose you. I’m never sure of you. You’re coming
with me now—to-night—and damn everybody.”
</p><p>He held me to him, kissing me until I could hardly breathe.
</p><p>“I can’t do without you any longer, Anne. I can’t indeed. I hate
all this money. Let Race have it. Come on. Let’s go.”
</p><p>“My toothbrush?” I demurred.
</p><p>“You can buy one. I know I’m a lunatic, but for God’s sake, _come!”_
</p><p>He stalked off at a furious pace. I followed him as meekly as the
Barotsi woman I had observed at the Falls. Only I wasn’t carrying
a frying-pan on my head. He walked so fast that it was very
difficult to keep up with him.
</p><p>“Harry,” I said at last, in a meek voice, “are we going to walk
all the way to Rhodesia?”
</p><p>He turned suddenly and with a great shout of laughter gathered me
up in his arms.
</p><p>“I’m mad, sweetheart, I know it. But I do love you so.”
</p><p>“We’re a couple of lunatics. And, oh, Harry, you never asked me,
but I’m not making a sacrifice at all! I <u>wanted</u> to come!”
