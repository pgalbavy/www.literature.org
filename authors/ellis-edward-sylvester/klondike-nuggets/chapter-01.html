<p>Jeff Graham was an Argonaut who crossed the plains in 1849, while
he was yet in his teens, and settling in California, made it his
permanent home. When he left Independence, Mo., with the train,
his parents and one sister were his companions, but all of them
were buried on the prairie, and their loss robbed him of the desire
ever to return to the East. Hostile Indians, storm, cold, heat,
privation, and suffering were the causes of their taking off,
as they have been of hundreds who undertook the long journey to
the Pacific coast in quest of gold.</p>

<p>Jeff spent several years in the diggings, and after varying fortune,
made a strike, which yielded him sufficient to make him comfortable
for the rest of his days. He never married, and the income from
his investments was all and, indeed, more than he needed to secure
him against want.</p>

<p>He was now past threescore, grizzled, somewhat stoop-shouldered,
but robust, rugged, strong, and, in his way, happy. His dress
varied slightly with the changes of the seasons, consisting of
an old slouch hat, a red shirt, coarse trousers tucked in the
tops of his heavy boots, and a black neckerchief with dangling
ends. He had never been addicted to drink, and his only indulgence
was his brierwood pipe, which was his almost inseparable companion.
His trousers were secured at the waist by a strong leathern belt,
and when he wore a coat in cold weather he generally had a revolver
at his hip, but the weapon had not been discharged in years.</p>

<p>There were two members of that overland train whom Jeff never
forgot. They were young children, Roswell and Edith Palmer, who
lost both of their parents within five years after reaching the
coast. Jeff proved the friend in need, and no father could have
been kinder to the orphans, who were ten and twelve years younger
than he.</p>

<p>Roswell Palmer was now married, with a son named for himself,
while his sister, Mrs. Mansley, had been a widow a long time,
and she, too, had an only son, Frank, who was a few months older
than his cousin. The boys had received a good common-school education,
but their parents were too poor to send them to college. Jeff
would have offered to help but for his prejudice against all colleges.
The small wages which the lads received as clerks in a leading
dry-goods house were needed by their parents, and the youths,
active, lusty, and ambitious, had settled down to the career of
merchants, with the hoped-for reward a long, long way in the future.</p>

<p>One evening late in March, 1897, Jeff opened the door of Mr.
Palmer's modest home, near the northern suburb of San Francisco,
and with his pipe between his lips, sat down in the chair to which
he was always welcome. In truth, the chair was considered his,
and no one would have thought of occupying it when he was present.
As he slowly puffed his pipe he swayed gently backward and forward,
his slouch hat on the floor beside him, and his long, straggling
hair dangling about his shoulders, while his heavy beard came
almost to his eyes.</p>

<p>It was so late that the wife had long since cleared away the
dishes from the table, and sat at one side of the room sewing
by the lamp. The husband was reading a paper, but laid it aside
when Jeff entered, always glad to talk with their quaint visitor,
to whom he and his family were bound by warm ties of gratitude.</p>

<p>Jeff smoked a minute or two in silence, after greeting his friends,
and the humping of his massive shoulders showed that he was laughing,
though he gave forth no sound.</p>

<p>"What pleases you, Jeff?" asked Mr. Palmer, smiling in sympathy,
while the wife looked at their caller in mild surprise.</p>

<p>"I've heerd it said that a burned child dreads the fire, but
I don't b'lieve it. After he's burnt he goes back agin and gits
burnt over. Why is it, after them explorers that are trying to
find the North Pole no sooner git home and thawed out than they're
crazy to go back agin! Look at Peary. You'd think he had enough,
but he's at it once more, and will keep at it after he finds the
pole&mdash;that is, if he ever does find it. Nansen, too, he'll be
like a fish out of water till he's climbing the icebergs agin."</p>

<p>And once more the huge shoulders bobbed up and down. His friends
knew this was meant to serve as an introduction to something else
that was on Jeff's mind, and they smilingly waited for it to come.</p>

<p>"It's over forty years since I roughed it in the diggings, starving,
fighting Injins, and getting tough," continued the old minor musingly.
"After I struck it purty fair I quit; but I never told you how
many times the longing has come over me so strong that it was
all I could do to stick at home and not make a fool of myself."</p>

<p>"But that was in your younger days," replied his friend; "you
have had nothing of the kind for a good while."</p>

<p>Jeff took his pipe from the network of beard that enclosed his
lips, and turned his bright, gray eyes upon the husband and wife
who were looking curiously at him. They knew by the movement of
the beard at the corners of the invisible mouth that he was smiling.</p>

<p>"There's the joke. It's come over me so strong inside the last
week, that I've made up my mind to start out on a hunt for gold.
What do you think of that, eh?"</p>

<p>And restoring his pipe to his lips, he leaned back and rocked
his chair with more vigor than before, while he looked fixedly
into the faces of his friends.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>JEFF</em>.]</p>

<p>"Jeff, you can't be in earnest; you are past threescore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sixty-four last month," he interrupted; "let's git it right."</p>

<p>"And you are in no need of money; besides it is a hard matter
to find any place in California where it is worth your while&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it ain't Californy," he broke in again; "it's the Klondike
country. No use of talking," he added with warmth, "there's richer
deposits in Alaska and that part of the world than was ever found
hereabouts. I've got a friend, Tim McCabe, at Juneau; he's been
through the Klondike country, and writes me there's no mistake
about it; he wants me to join him. I'm going to do it, and your
boy Roswell and his cousin Frank are to go with me. Oh, it's all
settled," said Jeff airily; "the only question is how soon you
can git him ready. A day oughter be enough."</p>

<p>The husband and wife looked at each other in astonishment. They
had not dreamed of anything like this; but if the truth were told,
Mr. Palmer had been so wrought up by the wonderful stories that
were continually coming from Alaska and British Columbia, that
he was seriously thinking of joining the northward-bound procession.</p>

<p>Startling as was the announcement of Jeff Graham, a discussion
of the scheme brought out more than one fact to recommend it.
The youths were in perfect health, strong and athletic. Jeff volunteered
to provide all the funds needed, and his early experience in mining
and his love for the boys made him an invaluable guide and companion
despite his years. He had turned over in his mind every phase
of the question, and met each objection the affectionate mother
brought forward, alarmed as she was at the thought of having her
boy go so many miles from under her care.</p>

<p>"It will be necessary to talk with Roswell about it," said the
father, after the conversation had lasted a considerable while.</p>

<p>"No, it won't; I've talked with him, and he's as crazy as me
to go."</p>

<p>"But what will Frank's mother say?"</p>

<p>"She's said what she's got to say; had a talk with her last night,
and it's all fixed. I've sent word to Tim that I'll be at Juneau
by next steamer, and have two of the likeliest younkers with me
on the coast; then we'll head for the Upper Yukon, and bime-by
hire a ship to bring back all the gold we'll scoop in."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that we have nothing to do in the premises, Jeff."</p>

<p>"Nothing 'cept to git the youngster ready."</p>
