<p>There are of KNOWLEDGE two kinds; whereof one is Knowledge Of Fact:
the other Knowledge Of The Consequence Of One Affirmation To Another.
The former is nothing else, but Sense and Memory, and is Absolute
Knowledge; as when we see a Fact doing, or remember it done:
And this is the Knowledge required in a Witnesse.  The later is
called Science; and is Conditionall; as when we know, that,
If The Figure Showne Be A Circle, Then Any Straight Line Through
The Centre Shall Divide It Into Two Equall Parts.  And this is
the Knowledge required in a Philosopher; that is to say, of him
that pretends to Reasoning.</p>

<p>The Register of Knowledge Of Fact is called History.  Whereof there be
two sorts: one called Naturall History; which is the History of
such Facts, or Effects of Nature, as have no Dependance on Mans Will;
Such as are the Histories of Metals, Plants, Animals, Regions,
and the like.  The other, is Civill History; which is the History of
the Voluntary Actions of men in Common-wealths.</p>

<p>The Registers of Science, are such Books as contain the Demonstrations
of Consequences of one Affirmation, to another; and are commonly called
Books of Philosophy; whereof the sorts are many, according to the
diversity of the Matter; And may be divided in such manner as I have
divided them in the following Table.</p>

     also PHILOSOPHY</p>
