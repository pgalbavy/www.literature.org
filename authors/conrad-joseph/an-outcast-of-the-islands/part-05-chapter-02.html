<p>For the next half-hour Almayer, who wanted to give Joanna plenty
of time, stumbled amongst the lumber in distant parts of his enclosure,
sneaked along the fences; or held his breath, flattened against
grass walls behind various outhouses: all this to escape Ali’s
inconveniently zealous search for his master. He heard him talk
with the head watchman&mdash;sometimes quite close to him in the darkness&mdash;then
moving off, coming back, wondering, and, as the time passed, growing
uneasy.</p>

<p>"He did not fall into the river?&mdash;say, thou blind watcher!" Ali
was growling in a bullying tone, to the other man. "He told me
to fetch Mahmat, and when I came back swiftly I found him not
in the house. There is that Sirani woman there, so that Mahmat
cannot steal anything, but it is in my mind, the night will be
half gone before I rest."</p>

<p>He shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Master! O master! O mast . . ."</p>

<p>"What are you making that noise for?" said Almayer, with severity,
stepping out close to them.</p>

<p>The two Malays leaped away from each other in their surprise.</p>

<p>"You may go. I don’t want you any more tonight, Ali," went on
Almayer. "Is Mahmat there?"</p>

<p>"Unless the ill-behaved savage got tired of waiting. Those men
know not politeness. They should not be spoken to by white men,"
said Ali, resentfully.</p>

<p>Almayer went towards the house, leaving his servants to wonder
where he had sprung from so unexpectedly. The watchman hinted
obscurely at powers of invisibility possessed by the master, who
often at night . . . Ali interrupted him with great scorn. Not
every white man has the power. Now, the Rajah Laut could make
himself invisible. Also, he could be in two places at once, as
everybody knew; except he&mdash;the useless watchman&mdash;who knew no more
about white men than a wild pig! Ya-wa!</p>

<p>And Ali strolled towards his hut, yawning loudly.</p>

<p>As Almayer ascended the steps he heard the noise of a door flung
to, and when he entered the verandah he saw only Mahmat there,
close to the doorway of the passage. Mahmat seemed to be caught
in the very act of slinking away, and Almayer noticed that with
satisfaction. Seeing the white man, the Malay gave up his attempt
and leaned against the wall. He was a short, thick, broad-shouldered
man with very dark skin and a wide, stained, bright-red mouth
that uncovered, when he spoke, a close row of black and glistening
teeth. His eyes were big, prominent, dreamy and restless. He said
sulkily, looking all over the place from under his eyebrows&mdash;</p>

<p>"White Tuan, you are great and strong&mdash;and I a poor man. Tell
me what is your will, and let me go in the name of God. It is
late."</p>

<p>Almayer examined the man thoughtfully. How could he find out
whether . . . He had it! Lately he had employed that man and his
two brothers as extra boatmen to carry stores, provisions, and
new axes to a camp of rattan cutters some distance up the river.
A three days’ expedition. He would test him now in that way. He
said negligently&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want you to start at once for the camp, with surat for the
Kavitan. One dollar a day."</p>

<p>The man appeared plunged in dull hesitation, but Almayer, who
knew his Malays, felt pretty sure from his aspect that nothing
would induce the fellow to go. He urged&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is important&mdash;and if you are swift I shall give two dollars
for the last day."</p>

<p>"No, Tuan. We do not go," said the man, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"We start on another journey."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"To a place we know of," said Mahmat, a little louder, in a stubborn
manner, and looking at the floor.</p>

<p>Almayer experienced a feeling of immense joy. He said, with affected
annoyance&mdash;</p>

<p>"You men live in my house and it is as if it were your own. I
may want my house soon."</p>

<p>Mahmat looked up.</p>

<p>"We are men of the sea and care not for a roof when we have a
canoe that will hold three, and a paddle apiece. The sea is our
house. Peace be with you, Tuan."</p>

<p>He turned and went away rapidly, and Almayer heard him directly
afterwards in the courtyard calling to the watchman to open the
gate. Mahmat passed through the gate in silence, but before the
bar had been put up behind him he had made up his mind that if
the white man ever wanted to eject him from his hut, he would
burn it and also as many of the white man’s other buildings as
he could safely get at. And he began to call his brothers before
he was inside the dilapidated dwelling.</p>

<p>"All’s well!" muttered Almayer to himself, taking some loose
Java tobacco from a drawer in the table. "Now if anything comes
out I am clear. I asked the man to go up the river. I urged him.
He will say so himself. Good."</p>

<p>He began to charge the china bowl of his pipe, a pipe with a
long cherry stem and a curved mouthpiece, pressing the tobacco
down with his thumb and thinking: No. I sha’n’t see her again.
Don’t want to. I will give her a good start, then go in chase&mdash;and
send an express boat after father. Yes! that’s it.</p>

<p>He approached the door of the office and said, holding his pipe
away from his lips&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good luck to you, Mrs. Willems. Don’t lose any time. You may
get along by the bushes; the fence there is out of repair. Don’t
lose time. Don’t forget that it is a matter of . . . life and
death. And don’t forget that I know nothing. I trust you."</p>

<p>He heard inside a noise as of a chest-lid falling down. She made
a few steps. Then a sigh, profound and long, and some faint words
which he did not catch. He moved away from the door on tiptoe,
kicked off his slippers in a corner of the verandah, then entered
the passage puffing at his pipe; entered cautiously in a gentle
creaking of planks and turned into a curtained entrance to the
left. There was a big room. On the floor a small binnacle lamp&mdash;that
had found its way to the house years ago from the lumber-room
of the Flash&mdash;did duty for a night-light. It glimmered very small
and dull in the great darkness. Almayer walked to it, and picking
it up revived the flame by pulling the wick with his fingers,
which he shook directly after with a grimace of pain. Sleeping
shapes, covered&mdash;head and all&mdash;with white sheets, lay about on
the mats on the floor. In the middle of the room a small cot,
under a square white mosquito net, stood&mdash;the only piece of furniture
between the four walls&mdash;looking like an altar of transparent marble
in a gloomy temple. A woman, half-lying on the floor with her
head dropped on her arms, which were crossed on the foot of the
cot, woke up as Almayer strode over her outstretched legs. She
sat up without a word, leaning forward, and, clasping her knees,
stared down with sad eyes, full of sleep.</p>

<p>Almayer, the smoky light in one hand, his pipe in the other,
stood before the curtained cot looking at his daughter&mdash;at his
little Nina&mdash;at that part of himself, at that small and unconscious
particle of humanity that seemed to him to contain all his soul.
And it was as if he had been bathed in a bright and warm wave
of tenderness, in a tenderness greater than the world, more precious
than life; the only thing real, living, sweet, tangible, beautiful
and safe amongst the elusive, the distorted and menacing shadows
of existence. On his face, lit up indistinctly by the short yellow
flame of the lamp, came a look of rapt attention while he looked
into her future. And he could see things there! Things charming
and splendid passing before him in a magic unrolling of resplendent
pictures; pictures of events brilliant, happy, inexpressibly glorious,
that would make up her life. He would do it! He would do it. He
would! He would&mdash;for that child! And as he stood in the still
night, lost in his enchanting and gorgeous dreams, while the ascending,
thin thread of tobacco smoke spread into a faint bluish cloud
above his head, he appeared strangely impressive and ecstatic:
like a devout and mystic worshipper, adoring, transported and
mute; burning incense before a shrine, a diaphanous shrine of
a child-idol with closed eyes; before a pure and vaporous shrine
of a small god&mdash;fragile, powerless, unconscious and sleeping.</p>

<p>When Ali, roused by loud and repeated shouting of his name, stumbled
outside the door of his hut, he saw a narrow streak of trembling
gold above the forests and a pale sky with faded stars overhead:
signs of the coming day. His master stood before the door waving
a piece of paper in his hand and shouting excitedly&mdash;"Quick, Ali!
Quick!" When he saw his servant he rushed forward, and pressing
the paper on him objurgated him, in tones which induced Ali to
think that something awful had happened, to hurry up and get the
whale-boat ready to go immediately&mdash;at once, at once&mdash;after Captain
Lingard. Ali remonstrated, agitated also, having caught the infection
of distracted haste.</p>

<p>"If must go quick, better canoe. Whale-boat no can catch, same
as small canoe."</p>

<p>"No, no! Whale-boat! whale-boat! You dolt! you wretch!" howled
Almayer, with all the appearance of having gone mad. "Call the
men! Get along with it. Fly!"</p>

<p>And Ali rushed about the courtyard kicking the doors of huts
open to put his head in and yell frightfully inside; and as he
dashed from hovel to hovel, men shivering and sleepy were coming
out, looking after him stupidly, while they scratched their ribs
with bewildered apathy. It was hard work to put them in motion.
They wanted time to stretch themselves and to shiver a little.
Some wanted food. One said he was sick. Nobody knew where the
rudder was. Ali darted here and there, ordering, abusing, pushing
one, then another, and stopping in his exertions at times to wring
his hands hastily and groan, because the whale-boat was much slower
than the worst canoe and his master would not listen to his protestations.</p>

<p>Almayer saw the boat go off at last, pulled anyhow by men that
were cold, hungry, and sulky; and he remained on the jetty watching
it down the reach. It was broad day then, and the sky was perfectly
cloudless. Almayer went up to the house for a moment. His household
was all astir and wondering at the strange disappearance of the
Sirani woman, who had taken her child and had left her luggage.
Almayer spoke to no one, got his revolver, and went down to the
river again. He jumped into a small canoe and paddled himself
towards the schooner. He worked very leisurely, but as soon as
he was nearly alongside he began to hail the silent craft with
the tone and appearance of a man in a tremendous hurry.</p>

<p>"Schooner ahoy! schooner ahoy!" he shouted.</p>

<p>A row of blank faces popped up above the bulwark. After a while
a man with a woolly head of hair said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"The mate! the mate! Call him, steward!" said Almayer, excitedly,
making a frantic grab at a rope thrown down to him by somebody.</p>

<p>In less than a minute the mate put his head over. He asked, surprised&mdash;</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, Mr. Almayer?"</p>

<p>"Let me have the gig at once, Mr. Swan&mdash;at once. I ask in Captain
Lingard’s name. I must have it. Matter of life and death."</p>

<p>The mate was impressed by Almayer’s agitation</p>

<p>"You shall have it, sir. . . . Man the gig there! Bear a hand,
serang! . . . It’s hanging astern, Mr. Almayer," he said, looking
down again. "Get into it, sir. The men are coming down by the
painter."</p>

<p>By the time Almayer had clambered over into the stern sheets,
four calashes were in the boat and the oars were being passed
over the taffrail. The mate was looking on. Suddenly he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it dangerous work? Do you want any help? I would come . .
."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" cried Almayer. "Come along. Don’t lose a moment.
Go and get your revolver. Hurry up! hurry up!"</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding his feverish anxiety to be off, he lolled
back very quiet and unconcerned till the mate got in and, passing
over the thwarts, sat down by his side. Then he seemed to wake
up, and called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let go&mdash;let go the painter!"</p>

<p>"Let go the painter&mdash;the painter!" yelled the bowman, jerking
at it.</p>

<p>People on board also shouted "Let go!" to one another, till it
occurred at last to somebody to cast off the rope; and the boat
drifted rapidly away from the schooner in the sudden silencing
of all voices.</p>

<p>Almayer steered. The mate sat by his side, pushing the cartridges
into the chambers of his revolver. When the weapon was loaded
he asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is it? Are you after somebody?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Almayer, curtly, with his eyes fixed ahead on the
river. "We must catch a dangerous man."</p>

<p>"I like a bit of a chase myself," declared the mate, and then,
discouraged by Almayer’s aspect of severe thoughtfulness, said
nothing more.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour passed. The calashes stretched forward head first
and lay back with their faces to the sky, alternately, in a regular
swing that sent the boat flying through the water; and the two
sitters, very upright in the stern sheets, swayed rhythmically
a little at every stroke of the long oars plied vigorously.</p>

<p>The mate observed: "The tide is with us."</p>

<p>"The current always runs down in this river," said Almayer.</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I know," retorted the other; "but it runs faster
on the ebb. Look by the land at the way we get over the ground!
A five-knot current here, I should say."</p>

<p>"H’m!" growled Almayer. Then suddenly: "There is a passage between
two islands that will save us four miles. But at low water the
two islands, in the dry season, are like one with only a mud ditch
between them. Still, it’s worth trying."</p>

<p>"Ticklish job that, on a falling tide," said the mate, coolly.
"You know best whether there’s time to get through."</p>

<p>"I will try," said Almayer, watching the shore intently. "Look
out now!"</p>

<p>He tugged hard at the starboard yoke-line.</p>

<p>"Lay in your oars!" shouted the mate.</p>

<p>The boat swept round and shot through the narrow opening of a
creek that broadened out before the craft had time to lose its
way.</p>

<p>"Out oars! . . . Just room enough," muttered the mate.</p>

<p>It was a sombre creek of black water speckled with the gold of
scattered sunlight falling through the boughs that met overhead
in a soaring, restless arc full of gentle whispers passing, tremulous,
aloft amongst the thick leaves. The creepers climbed up the trunks
of serried trees that leaned over, looking insecure and undermined
by floods which had eaten away the earth from under their roots.
And the pungent, acrid smell of rotting leaves, of flowers, of
blossoms and plants dying in that poisonous and cruel gloom, where
they pined for sunshine in vain, seemed to lay heavy, to press
upon the shiny and stagnant water in its tortuous windings amongst
the everlasting and invincible shadows.</p>

<p>Almayer looked anxious. He steered badly. Several times the blades
of the oars got foul of the bushes on one side or the other, checking
the way of the gig. During one of those occurrences, while they
were getting clear, one of the calashes said something to the
others in a rapid whisper. They looked down at the water. So did
the mate.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he exclaimed. "Eh, Mr. Almayer! Look! The water is running
out. See there! We will be caught."</p>

<p>"Back! back! We must go back!" cried Almayer.</p>

<p>"Perhaps better go on."</p>

<p>"No; back! back!"</p>

<p>He pulled at the steering line, and ran the nose of the boat
into the bank. Time was lost again in getting clear.</p>

<p>"Give way, men! give way!" urged the mate, anxiously.</p>

<p>The men pulled with set lips and dilated nostrils, breathing
hard.</p>

<p>"Too late," said the mate, suddenly. "The oars touch the bottom
already. We are done."</p>

<p>The boat stuck. The men laid in the oars, and sat, panting, with
crossed arms.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are caught," said Almayer, composedly. "That is unlucky!"</p>

<p>The water was falling round the boat. The mate watched the patches
of mud coming to the surface. Then in a moment he laughed, and
pointing his finger at the creek&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look!" he said; "the blamed river is running away from us. Here’s
the last drop of water clearing out round that bend."</p>

<p>Almayer lifted his head. The water was gone, and he looked only
at a curved track of mud&mdash;of mud soft and black, hiding fever,
rottenness, and evil under its level and glazed surface.</p>

<p>"We are in for it till the evening," he said, with cheerful resignation.
"I did my best. Couldn’t help it."</p>

<p>"We must sleep the day away," said the mate. "There’s nothing
to eat,"  he added, gloomily.</p>

<p>Almayer stretched himself in the stern sheets. The Malays curled
down between thwarts.</p>

<p>"Well, I’m jiggered!" said the mate, starting up after a long
pause. "I was in a devil of a hurry to go and pass the day stuck
in the mud. Here’s a holiday for you! Well! well!"</p>

<p>They slept or sat unmoving and patient. As the sun mounted higher
the breeze died out, and perfect stillness reigned in the empty
creek. A troop of long-nosed monkeys appeared, and crowding on
the outer boughs, contemplated the boat and the motionless men
in it with grave and sorrowful intensity, disturbed now and then
by irrational outbreaks of mad gesticulation. A little bird with
sapphire breast balanced a slender twig across a slanting beam
of light, and flashed in it to and fro like a gem dropped from
the sky. His minute round eye stared at the strange and tranquil
creatures in the boat. After a while he sent out a thin twitter
that sounded impertinent and funny in the solemn silence of the
great wilderness; in the great silence full of struggle and death.</p>
