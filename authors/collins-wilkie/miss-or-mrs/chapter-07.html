              MR. TURLINGTON,
<P>
            LADY WINWOOD At Home.
<P>
     Wednesday, December 15th.--Ten o'clock.
<hr>
<P>
 "Dearest Natalie--As the brute insists, the brute must have the
invitation which I inclose. Never mind, my child. You and Launce
are coming to dinner, and I will see that you have your little
private opportunities of retirement afterward. All I expect of
you in return is, _not_ to look (when you come back) as if your
husband had been kissing you. You will certainly let out the
secret of those stolen kisses, if you don't take care. At mamma's
dinner yesterday, your color (when you came out of the
conservatory) was a sight to see. Even your shoulders were red!
They are charming shoulders, I know, and men take the strangest
fancies sometimes. But, my dear, suppose you wear a chemisette
next time, if you haven't authority enough over him to prevent
his doing it again!
<P>
                 "Your affectionate  LOUISA."
<P>
 The private history of the days that had passed since the
marriage
 was written in that letter. An additional chapter--of some
importance in its bearing on the future--was contributed by the
progress of events at Lady Winwood's party.
<P>
By previous arrangement with Natalie, the Graybrookes (invited to
dinner) arrived early. Leaving her husband and her stepdaughters
to entertain Sir Joseph and Miss Lavinia, Lady Winwood took
Natalie into her own boudoir, which communicated by a curtained
opening with the drawing-room.
<P>
"My dear, you are looking positively haggard this evening. Has
anything happened?"
<P>
"I am nearly worn out, Louisa. The life I am leading is so
unendurable that, if Launce pressed me, I believe I should
consent to run away with him when we leave your house tonight."
<P>
"You will do nothing of the sort, if you please. Wait till you
are sixteen. I delight in novelty, but the novelty of appearing
at the Old Bailey is beyond my ambition. Is the brute coming
to-night?"
<P>
"Of course. He insists on following me wherever I go. He lunched
at Muswell Hill today. More complaints of my incomprehensible
coldness to him. Another scolding from papa. A furious letter
from Launce. If I let Richard kiss my hand again in his presence,
Launce warns me he will knock him down. Oh, the meanness and the
guiltiness of the life I am leading now! I am in the falsest of
all false positions, Louisa, and you encouraged me to do it. I
believe Richard Turlington suspects us. The last two times Launce
and I tried to get a minute together at my aunt's, he contrived
to put himself in our way. There he was, my dear, with his
scowling face, looking as if he longed to kill Launce. Can you do
anything for us tonight? Not on my account. But Launce is so
impatient. If he can't say two words to me alone this evening, he
declares he will come to Muswell Hill, and catch me in the garden
tomorrow."
<P>
"Compose yourself, my dear; he shall say his two words to-night."
<P>
"How?"
<P>
Lady Winwood pointed through the curtained entrance of the
boudoir to the door of the drawing-room. Beyond the door was the
staircase landing. And beyond the landing was a second drawing-
room, the smaller of the two.
<P>
"There are only three or four people coming to dinner," her
ladyship proceeded; "and a few more in the evening. Being a small
party, the small drawing-room will do for us. This drawing-room
will not be lighted, and there will be only my reading-lamp here
in the boudoir. I shall give the signal for leaving the
dining-room earlier than usual. Launce will join us before the
evening party begins. The moment he appears, send him in
here--boldly before your aunt and all of us."
<P>
"For what?"
<P>
"For your fan. Leave it there under the sofa-cushion before we go
down to dinner. You will sit next to Launce, and you will give
him private instructions not to find the fan. You will get
impatient--you will go to find it yourself--and there you are.
Take care of your shoulders, Mrs. Linzie! I have nothing more to
say."
<P>
The guests asked to dinner began to arrive. Lady Winwood was
recalled to her duties as mistress of the house.
<P>
It was a pleasant little dinner--with one drawback. It began too
late. The ladies only reached the small drawing-room at ten
minutes to ten. Launce was only able to join them as the clock
struck.
<P>
"Too late!" whispered Natalie. "He will be here directly."
<P>
"Nobody comes punctually to an evening party," said Launce.
"Don't let us lose a moment. Send me for your fan."
<P>
Natalie opened her lips to say the necessary words. Before she
could speak, the servant announced--"Mr. Turlington."
<P>
He came in, with his stiffly-upright shirt collar and his
loosely-fitting glossy black clothes. He made his sullen and
clumsy bow to Lady Winwood. And then he did, what he had done
dozens of times already--he caught Natalie, with her eyes still
bright and her face still animated (after talking to Launce)--a
striking contrast to the cold and unimpulsive young lady whom he
was accustomed to see while Natalie was talking to _him_.
<P>
Lord Winwood's daughters were persons of some celebrity in the
world of amateur music. Noticing the look that Turlington cast at
Launce, Lady Winwood whispered to Miss Lavinia--who instantly
asked the young ladies to sing. Launce, in obedience to a sign
from Natalie, volunteered to find the music-books. It is needless
to add that he pitched on the wrong volume at starting. As he
lifted it from the piano to take it back to the stand, there
dropped out from between the leaves a printed letter, looking
like a circular. One of the young ladies took it up, and ran her
eye over it, with a start.
<P>
"The Sacred Concerts!" she exclaimed.
<P>
Her two sisters, standing by, looked at each other guiltily:
"What will the Committee say to us? We entirely forgot the
meeting last month."
<P>
"Is there a meeting this month?"
<P>
They all looked anxiously at the printed letter.
<P>
"Yes! The twenty-third of December. Put it down in your book,
Amelia." Amelia, then and there, put it down among the
engagements for the latter end of the month. And Natalie's
unacknowledged husband placidly looked on.
<P>
So did the merciless irony of circumstances make Launce the
innocent means of exposing his own secret to discovery. Thanks to
his success in laying his hand on the wrong music-book, there
would now be a meeting--two good days before the elopement could
take place--between the lord's daughters and the rector's wife!
<P>
The guests of the evening began to appear by twos and threes. The
gentlemen below stairs left the dinner-table, and joined them.
<P>
The small drawing-room was pleasantly filled, and no more. Sir
Joseph Graybrooke, taking Turlington's hand, led him eagerly to
their host. The talk in the dining-room had turned on finance.
Lord Winwood was not quite satisfied with some of his foreign
investments; and Sir Joseph's "dear Richard" was the very man to
give him a little sound advice. The three laid their heads
together in a corner. Launce (watching them) slyly pressed
Natalie's hand. A renowned "virtuoso" had arrived, and was
thundering on the piano. The attention of the guests generally
was absorbed in the performance. A fairer chance of sending
Launce for the fan could not possibly have offered itself. While
the financial discussion was still proceeding, the married lovers
were ensconced together alone in the boudoir.
<P>
Lady Winwood (privately observant of their absence) kept her eye
on the corner, watching Richard Turlington.
<P>
He was talking earnestly--with his back toward the company. He
neither moved nor looked round. It came to Lord Winwood's turn to
speak. He preserved the same position, listening. Sir Joseph took
up the conversation next. Then his attention wandered--he knew
beforehand what Sir Joseph would say. His eyes turned anxiously
toward the place in which he had left Natalie. Lord Winwood said
a word. His head turned back again toward the corner. Sir Joseph
put an objection. He glanced once more over his shoulder--this
time at the place in which Launce had been standing. The next
moment his host recalled his attention, and made it impossible
for him to continue his scrutiny of the room. At the same times
two among the evening guests, bound for another party, approached
to take leave of the lady of the house. Lady Winwood was obliged
to rise, and attend to them. They had something to say to her
before they left, and they said it at terrible length, standing
so as to intercept her view of the proceedings of the enemy. When
she had got rid of them at last, she looked--and behold Lord
Winwood and Sir Joseph were the only occupants of the corner!
<P>
Delaying one moment, to set the "virtuoso" thundering once more,
Lady Winwood slipped out of the room and crossed the landing. At
the entrance to the empty drawing-room she heard Turlington's
voice, low and threatening, in the boudoir. Jealousy has a Second
Sight of its own. He had looked in the right place at
starting--and, oh heavens! he had caught them.
<P>
Her ladyship's courage was beyond dispute; but she turned pale as
she approached the entrance to the boudoir.
<P>
There stood Natalie--at once angry and afraid--between the man to
whom she was ostensibly engaged, and the man to whom she was
actually married. Turlington's rugged
 face expressed a martyrdom of suppressed fury. Launce--in the
act of offering Natalie her fan--smiled, with the cool
superiority of a man who knew that he had won his advantage, and
who triumphed in knowing it.
<P>
"I forbid you to take your fan from that man's hands," said
Turlington, speaking to Natalie, and pointing to Launce.
<P>
"Isn't it rather too soon to begin 'forbidding'?" asked Lady
Winwood, good-humoredly.
<P>
"Exactly what I say!" exclaimed Launce. "It seems necessary to
remind Mr. Turlington that he is not married to Natalie yet!"
<P>
Those last words were spoken in a tone which made both the women
tremble inwardly for results. Lady Winwood took the fan from
Launce with one hand, and took Natalie's arm with the other.
<P>
"There is your fan, my dear," she said, in her easy off-hand
manner. "Why do you allow these two barbarous men to keep you
here while the great Bootmann is playing the Nightmare Sonata in
the next room? Launce! Mr. Turlington! follow me, and learn to be
musical directly! You have only to shut your eyes, and you will
fancy you hear four modern German composers playing, instead of
one, and not the ghost of a melody among all the four. "She led
the way out with Natalie, and whispered, "Did he catch you?"
Natalie whispered back, "I heard him in time. He only caught us
looking for the fan." The two men waited behind to have two words
together alone in the boudoir.
<P>
"This doesn't end here, Mr. Linzie!"
<P>
Launce smiled satirically. "For once I agree with you," he
answered. "It doesn't end here, as you say."
<P>
Lady Winwood stopped, and looked back at them from the drawing-
room door. They were keeping her waiting--they had no choice but
to follow the mistress of the house.
<P>
Arrived in the next room, both Turlington and Launce resumed
their places among the guests with the same object in view. As a
necessary result of the scene in the boudoir, each had his own
special remonstrance to address to Sir Joseph. Even here, Launce
was beforehand with Turlington. He was the first to get
possession of Sir Joseph's private ear. His complaint took the
form of a protest against Turlington's jealousy, and an appeal
for a reconsideration of the sentence which excluded him from
Muswell Hill. Watching them from a distance, Turlington's
suspicious eye detected the appearance of something unduly
confidential in the colloquy between the two. Under cover of the
company, he stole behind them and listened.
<P>
The great Bootmann had arrived at that part of the Nightmare
Sonata in which musical sound, produced principally with the left
hand, is made to describe, beyond all possibility of mistake, the
rising of the moon in a country church-yard and a dance of
Vampires round a maiden's grave. Sir Joseph, having no chance
against the Vampires in a whisper, was obliged to raise his voice
to make himself audible in answering and comforting Launce. "I
sincerely sympathize with you," Turlington heard him say; "and
Natalie feels about it as I do. But Richard is an obstacle in our
way. We must look to the consequences, my dear boy, supposing
Richard found us out." He nodded kindly to his nephew; and,
declining to pursue the subject, moved away to another part of
the room.
<P>
Turlington's jealous distrust, wrought to the highest pitch of
irritability for weeks past, instantly associated the words he
had just heard with the words spoken by Launce in the boudoir,
which had reminded him that he was not married to Natalie yet.
Was there treachery at work under the surface? and was the object
to persuade weak Sir Joseph to reconsider his daughter's
contemplated marriage in a sense favorable to Launce?
Turlington's blind suspicion overleaped at a bound all the
manifest improbabilities which forbade such a conclusion as this.
After an instant's consideration with himself, he decided on
keeping his own counsel, and on putting Sir Joseph's good faith
then and there to a test which he could rely on as certain to
take Natalie's father by surprise.
<P>
"Graybrooke!"
<P>
Sir Joseph started at the sight of his future son-in-law's face.
<P>
"My dear Richard, you are looking very strangely! Is the heat of
the room too much for you?"
<P>
"Never mind the heat! I have seen enough to-night to justify me
in insisting that your daughter and Launcelot Linzie shall meet
no more between this and the day of my marriage." Sir Joseph
attempted to speak. Turlington declined to give him the
opportunity. "Yes! yes! your opinion of Linzie isn't mine, I
know. I saw you as thick as thieves together just now." Sir
Joseph once more attempted to make himself heard. Wearied by
Turlington's perpetual complaints of his daughter and his nephew,
he was sufficiently irritated by this time to have reported what
Launce had actually said to him if he had been allowed the
chance. But Turlington persisted in going on. "I cannot prevent
Linzie from being received in this house, and at your sister's,"
he said; "but I can keep him out of _my_ house in the country,
and to the country let us go. I propose a change in the
arrangements. Have you any engagement for the Christmas
holidays?"
<P>
He paused, and fixed his eyes attentively on Sir Joseph. Sir
Joseph, looking a little surprised, replied briefly that he had
no engagement.
<P>
"In that case, "resumed Turlington, "I invite you all to
Somersetshire, and I propose that the marriage shall take place
from my house, and not from yours. Do you refuse?"
<P>
"It is contrary to the usual course of proceeding in such cases,
Richard," Sir Joseph began.
<P>
"Do you refuse?" reiterated Turlington. "I tell you plainly, I
shall place a construction of my own upon your motive if you do."
<P>
"No, Richard," said Sir Joseph, quietly, "I accept."
<P>
Turlington drew back a step in silence. Sir Joseph had turned the
tables on him, and had taken _him_ by surprise.
<P>
"It will upset several plans, and be strongly objected to by the
ladies," proceeded the old gentleman. "But if nothing less will
satisfy you, I say, Yes! I shall have occasion, when we meet to-
morrow at Muswell Hill, to appeal to your indulgence under
circumstances which may greatly astonish you. The least I can do,
in the meantime, is to set an example of friendly sympathy and
forbearance on my side. No more now, Richard. Hush! the music!"
<P>
It was impossible to make him explain himself further that night.
Turlington was left to interpret Sir Joseph's mysterious
communication with such doubtful aid to success as his own
unassisted ingenuity might afford.
<P>
The meeting of the next day at Muswell Hill had for its object--
as Turlington had already been informed--the drawing of Natalie's
marriage-settlement. Was the question of money at the bottom of
Sir Joseph's contemplated appeal to his indulgence? He thought of
his commercial position. The depression in the Levant trade still
continued. Never had his business at any previous time required
such constant attention, and repaid that attention with so little
profit. The Bills of Lading had been already used by the firm, in
the ordinary course of trade, to obtain possession of the goods.
The duplicates in the hands of Bulpit Brothers were literally
waste paper. Repayment of the loan of forty thousand pounds (with
interest) was due in less than a month's time. There was his
commercial position! Was it possible that money-loving Sir Joseph
had any modification to propose in the matter of his daughter's
dowry? The bare dread that it might be so struck him cold. He
quitted the house--and forgot to wish Natalie goodnight.
<P>
Meanwhile, Launce had left the evening party before him--and
Launce also found matter for serious reflection presented to his
mind before he slept that night. In other words, he found, on
reaching his lodgings, a letter from his brother marked
"private." Had the inquiry into the secrets of Turlington's early
life--now prolonged over some weeks--led to positive results at
last? Launce eagerly opened the letter. It contained a Report and
a Summary. He passed at once to the Summary, and read these
words:
<P>
"If you only want moral evidence to satisfy your own mind, your
end is gained. There is, morally, no doubt that Turlington and
the sea-captain who cast the foreign sailor overboard to drown
are on e and the same man. Legally, the matter is beset by
difficulties, Turlington having destroyed all provable connection
between his present self and his past life. There is only one
chance for us. A sailor on board the ship (who was in his
master's secrets) is supposed to be still living (under his
master's protection). All the black deeds of Turlington's early
life are known to this man. He can prove the facts, if we can
find him, and make it worth his while to speak. Under what alias
he is hidden we do not know. His own name is Thomas Wildfang. If
we are to make the attempt to find him, not a moment is to be
lost. The expenses may be serious. Let me know whether we are to
go on, or whether enough has been done to attain the end you have
in view."
<P>
Enough had been done--not only to satisfy Launce, but to produce
the right effect on Sir Joseph's mind if Sir Joseph proved
obdurate when the secret of the marriage was revealed. Launce
wrote a line directing the stoppage of the proceedings at the
point which they had now reached. "Here is a reason for her not
marrying Turlington," he said to himself, as he placed the papers
under lock and key. "And if she doesn't marry Turlington," he
added, with a lover's logic, "why shouldn't she marry Me?"
