<blockquote>&quot;Let the steam-pot hiss till it's hot;<br>
Give me the speed of the Tantivy trot.&quot;<br>
Coaching Song, by R.E.E. Warburton, Esq.</blockquote>
<P>&quot;Now, sir, time to get up, if you please.  Tally-ho coach for
Leicester'll be round in half an hour, and don't wait for
nobody.&quot;  So spake the boots of the Peacock Inn Islington, at
half-past two o'clock on the morning of a day in the early part
of November 183-, giving Tom at the same time a shake by the
shoulder, and then putting down a candle; and carrying off his
shoes to clean.</P>
<P>Tom and his father arrived in town from Berkshire the day
before, and finding, on inquiry, that the Birmingham coaches
which ran from the city did not pass through Rugby, but
deposited their passengers at Dunchurch, a village three miles
distant on the main road, where said passengers had to wait for
the Oxford and Leicester coach in the evening, or to take a
post-chaise, had resolved that Tom should travel down by the
Tally-ho, which diverged from the main road and passed through
Rugby itself.  And as the Tally-ho was an early coach, they had
driven out to the Peacock to be on the road.</P>
<P>Tom had never been in London, and would have liked to have
stopped at the Belle Savage, where they had been put down by the
Star, just at dusk, that he might have gone roving about those
endless, mysterious, gas-lit streets, which, with their glare
and hum and moving crowds, excited him so that he couldn't talk
even.  But as soon as he found that the Peacock arrangement
would get him to Rugby by twelve o'clock in the day, whereas
otherwise he wouldn't be there till the evening, all other plans
melted away, his one absorbing aim being to become a public
school-boy as fast as possible, and six hours sooner or later
seeming to him of the most alarming importance.</P>
<P>Tom and his father had alighted at the Peacock at about seven in
the evening; and having heard with unfeigned joy the paternal
order, at the bar, of steaks and oyster-sauce for supper in half
an hour, and seen his father seated cozily by the bright fire in
the coffee-room with the paper in his hand, Tom had run out to
see about him, had wondered at all the vehicles passing and
repassing, and had fraternized with the boots and hostler, from
whom he ascertained that the Tally-ho was a tip-top goer - ten
miles an hour including stoppages - and so punctual that all the
road set their clocks by her.</P>
<P>Then being summoned to supper, he had regaled himself in one of
the bright little boxes of the Peacock coffee-room, on the beef-
steak and unlimited oyster-sauce and brown stout (tasted then
for the first time - a day to be marked for ever by Tom with a
white stone); had at first attended to the excellent advice
which his father was bestowing on him from over his glass of
steaming brandy-and-water, and then began nodding, from the
united effects of the stout, the fire, and the lecture; till the
Squire, observing Tom's state, and remembering that it was
nearly nine o'clock, and that the Tally-ho left at three, sent
the little fellow off to the chambermaid, with a shake of the
hand (Tom having stipulated in the morning before starting that
kissing should now cease between them), and a few parting words:</P>
<P>&quot;And now, Tom, my boy,&quot; said the Squire, &quot;remember you are
going, at your own earnest request, to be chucked into this
great school, like a young bear, with all your troubles before
you - earlier than we should have sent you perhaps.  If schools
are what they were in my time, you'll see a great many cruel
blackguard things done, and hear a deal of foul, bad talk.  But
never fear.  You tell the truth, keep a brave and kind heart,
and never listen to or say anything you wouldn't have your
mother and sister hear, and you'll never feel ashamed to come
home, or we to see you.&quot;</P>
<P>The allusion to his mother made Tom feel rather choky, and he
would have liked to have hugged his father well, if it hadn't
been for the recent stipulation.</P>
<P>As it was, he only squeezed his father's hand, and looked
bravely up and said, &quot;I'll try, father.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know you will, my boy.  Is your money all safe?</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Tom, diving into one pocket to make sure.</P>
<P>&quot;And your keys?&quot; said the Squire.</P>
<P>&quot;All right,&quot; said Tom, diving into the other pocket.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, good-night.  God bless you!  I'll tell boots to
call you, and be up to see you off.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom was carried off by the chambermaid in a brown study, from
which he was roused in a clean little attic, by that buxom
person calling him a little darling and kissing him as she left
the room; which indignity he was too much surprised to resent.
And still thinking of his father's last words, and the look with
which they were spoken, he knelt down and prayed that, come what
might, he might never bring shame or sorrow on the dear folk at
home.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Squire's last words deserved to have their effect,
for they had been the result of much anxious thought.  All the
way up to London he had pondered what he should say to Tom by
way of parting advice - something that the boy could keep in his
head ready for use.  By way of assisting meditation, he had even
gone the length of taking out his flint and steel and tinder,
and hammering away for a quarter of an hour till he had
manufactured a light for a long Trichinopoli cheroot, which he
silently puffed, to the no small wonder of coachee, who was an
old friend, and an institution on the Bath road, and who always
expected a talk on the prospects and doings, agricultural and
social, of the whole country, when he carried the Squire.</P>
<P>To condense the Squire's meditation, it was somewhat as follows:
&quot;I won't tell him to read his Bible, and love and serve God; if
he don't do that for his mother's sake and teaching, he won't
for mine.  Shall I go into the sort of temptations he'll meet
with?  No, I can't do that.  Never do for an old fellow to go
into such things with a boy.  He won't understand me.  Do him
more harm than good, ten to one.  Shall I tell him to mind his
work, and say he's sent to school to make himself a good
scholar?  Well, but he isn't sent to school for that - at any
rate, not for that mainly.  I don't care a straw for Greek
particles, or the digamma; no more does his mother.  What is he
sent to school for?  Well, partly because he wanted so to go.
If he'll only turn out a brave, helpful, truth-telling
Englishman, and a gentleman, and a Christian, that's all I
want,&quot; thought the Squire; and upon this view of the case he
framed his last words of advice to Tom, which were well enough
suited to his purpose.</P>
<P>For they were Tom's first thoughts as he tumbled out of bed at
the summons of boots, and proceeded rapidly to wash and dress
himself.  At ten minutes to three he was down in the coffee-room
in his stockings, carrying his hat-box, coat, and comforter in
his hand; and there he found his father nursing a bright fire,
and a cup of hot coffee and a hard biscuit on the table.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, then, Tom, give us your things here, and drink this.
There's nothing like starting warm, old fellow.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom addressed himself to the coffee, and prattled away while he
worked himself into his shoes and his greatcoat, well warmed
through - a Petersham coat with velvet collar, made tight after
the abominable fashion of those days.  And just as he is
swallowing his last mouthful, winding his comforter round his
throat, and tucking the ends into the breast of his coat, the
horn sounds; boots looks in and says, &quot;Tally-ho, sir;&quot; and they
hear the ring and the rattle of the four fast trotters and the
town-made drag, as it dashes up to the Peacock.</P>
<P>&quot;Anything for us, Bob?&quot; says the burly guard, dropping down from
behind, and slapping himself across the chest.</P>
<P>&quot;Young gen'lm'n, Rugby; three parcels, Leicester; hamper o'
game, Rugby,&quot; answers hostler.</P>
<P>&quot;Tell young gent to look alive,&quot; says guard, opening the hind-
boot and shooting in the parcels after examining them by the
lamps.  &quot;Here; shove the portmanteau up a-top.  I'll fasten him
presently.  - Now then, sir, jump up behind.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good-bye, father - my love at home.&quot;  A last shake of the hand.
Up goes Tom, the guard catching his hatbox and holding on with
one hand, while with the other he claps the horn to his mouth.
Toot, toot, toot! the hostlers let go their heads, the four bays
plunge at the collar, and away goes the Tally-ho into the
darkness, forty-five seconds from the time they pulled up.
Hostler, boots, and the Squire stand looking after them under
the Peacock lamp.</P>
<P>&quot;Sharp work!&quot; says the Squire, and goes in again to his bed, the
coach being well out of sight and hearing.</P>
<P>Tom stands up on the coach and looks back at his father's figure
as long as he can see it; and then the guard, having disposed of
his luggage, comes to an anchor, and finishes his buttonings and
other preparations for facing the three hours before dawn - no
joke for those who minded cold, on a fast coach in November, in
the reign of his late Majesty.</P>
<P>I sometimes think that you boys of this generation are a deal
tenderer fellows than we used to be.  At any rate you're much
more comfortable travellers, for I see every one of you with his
rug or plaid, and other dodges for preserving the caloric, and
most of you going in, those fuzzy, dusty, padded first-class
carriages.  It was another affair altogether, a dark ride on the
top of the Tally-ho, I can tell you, in a tight Petersham coat,
and your feet dangling six inches from the floor.  Then you knew
what cold was, and what it was to be without legs, for not a bit
of feeling had you in them after the first half-hour.  But it
had its pleasures, the old dark ride.  First there was the
consciousness of silent endurance, so dear to every Englishman - 
of standing out against something, and not giving in.  Then
there was the music of the rattling harness, and the ring of the
horses' feet on the hard road, and the glare of the two bright
lamps through the steaming hoar frost, over the leaders' ears,
into the darkness, and the cheery toot of the guard's horn, to
warn some drowsy pikeman or the hostler at the next change; and
the looking forward to daylight; and last, but not least, the
delight of returning sensation in your toes.</P>
<P>Then the break of dawn and the sunrise, where can they be ever
seen in perfection but from a coach roof?  You want motion and
change and music to see them in their glory - not the music of
singing men and singing women, but good, silent music, which
sets itself in your own head, the accompaniment of work and
getting over the ground.</P>
<P>The Tally-ho is past St. Albans, and Tom is enjoying the ride,
though half-frozen.  The guard, who is alone with him on the
back of the coach, is silent, but has muffled Tom's feet up in
straw, and put the end of an oat-sack over his knees.  The
darkness has driven him inwards, and he has gone over his little
past life, and thought of all his doings and promises, and of
his mother and sister, and his father's last words; and has made
fifty good resolutions, and means to bear himself like a brave
Brown as he is, though a young one.  Then he has been forward
into the mysterious boy-future, speculating as to what sort of
place Rugby is, and what they do there, and calling up all the
stories of public schools which he has heard from big boys in
the holidays.  He is choke-full of hope and life,
notwithstanding the cold, and kicks his heels against the back-
board, and would like to sing, only he doesn't know how his
friend the silent guard might take it.</P>
<P>And now the dawn breaks at the end of the fourth stage, and the
coach pulls up at a little roadside inn with huge stables
behind.  There is a bright fire gleaming through the red
curtains of the bar window, and the door is open.  The coachman
catches his whip into a double thong, and throws it to the
hostler; the steam of the horses rises straight up into the air.
He has put them along over the last two miles, and is two
minutes before his time.  He rolls down from the box and into
the inn.  The guard rolls off behind.  &quot;Now, sir,&quot; says he to
Tom, &quot;you just jump down, and I'll give you a drop of something
to keep the cold out.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom finds a difficulty in jumping, or indeed in finding the top
of the wheel with his feet, which may be in the next world for
all he feels; so the guard picks him off the coach top, and sets
him on his legs, and they stump off into the bar, and join the
coachman and the other outside passengers.</P>
<P>Here a fresh-looking barmaid serves them each with a glass of
early purl as they stand before the fire, coachman and guard
exchanging business remarks.  The purl warms the cockles of
Tom's heart, and makes him cough.</P>
<P>&quot;Rare tackle that, sir, of a cold morning,&quot; says the coachman,
smiling.  &quot;Time's up.&quot;  They are out again and up; coachee the
last, gathering the reins into his hands and talking to Jem the
hostler about the mare's shoulder, and then swinging himself up
on to the box - the horses dashing off in a canter before he
falls into his seat.  Toot-toot-tootle-too goes the horn, and
away they are again, five-and-thirty miles on their road (nearly
half-way to Rugby, thinks Tom), and the prospect of breakfast at
the end of the stage.</P>
<P>And now they begin to see, and the early life of the country-
side comes out - a market cart or two; men in smock-frocks going
to their work, pipe in mouth, a whiff of which is no bad smell
this bright morning.  The sun gets up, and the mist shines like
silver gauze.  They pass the hounds jogging along to a distant
meet, at the heels of the huntsman's back, whose face is about
the colour of the tails of his old pink, as he exchanges
greetings with coachman and guard.  Now they pull up at a lodge,
and take on board a well-muffled-up sportsman, with his gun-case
and carpet-bag,  An early up-coach meets them, and the coachmen
gather up their horses, and pass one another with the accustomed
lift of the elbow, each team doing eleven miles an hour, with a
mile to spare behind if necessary.  And here comes breakfast.</P>
<P>&quot;Twenty minutes here, gentlemen,&quot; says the coachman, as they
pull up at half-past seven at the inn-door.</P>
<P>Have we not endured nobly this morning? and is not this a worthy
reward for much endurance?  There is the low, dark wainscoted
room hung with sporting prints; the hat-stand (with a whip or
two standing up in it belonging to bagmen who are still snug in
bed) by the door; the blazing fire, with the quaint old glass
over the mantelpiece, in which is stuck a large card with the
list of the meets for the week of the county hounds; the table
covered with the whitest of cloths and of china, and bearing a
pigeon-pie, ham, round of cold boiled beef cut from a mammoth
ox, and the great loaf of household bread on a wooden trencher.
And here comes in the stout head waiter, puffing under a tray of
hot viands - kidneys and a steak, transparent rashers and
poached eggs, buttered toast and muffins, coffee and tea, all
smoking hot.  The table can never hold it all.  The cold meats
are removed to the sideboard - they were only put on for show
and to give us an appetite.  And now fall on, gentlemen all.  It
is a well-known sporting-house, and the breakfasts are famous.
Two or three men in pink, on their way to the meet, drop in, and
are very jovial and sharp-set, as indeed we all are.</P>
<P>&quot;Tea or coffee, sir?&quot; says head waiter, coming round to Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;Coffee, please,&quot; says Tom, with his mouth full of muffin and
kidney.  Coffee is a treat to him, tea is not.</P>
<P>Our coachman, I perceive, who breakfasts with us, is a cold beef
man.  He also eschews hot potations, and addicts himself to a
tankard of ale, which is brought him by the barmaid.  Sportsman
looks on approvingly, and orders a ditto for himself.</P>
<P>Tom has eaten kidney and pigeon-pie, and imbibed coffee, till
his little skin is as tight as a drum; and then has the further
pleasure of paying head waiter out of his own purse, in a
dignified manner, and walks out before the inn-door to see the
horses put to.  This is done leisurely and in a highly-finished
manner by the hostlers, as if they enjoyed the not being
hurried.  Coachman comes out with his waybill, and puffing a fat
cigar which the sportsman has given him.  Guard emerges from the
tap, where he prefers breakfasting, licking round a tough-
looking doubtful cheroot, which you might tie round your finger,
and three whiffs of which would knock any one else out of time.</P>
<P>The pinks stand about the inn-door lighting cigars and waiting
to see us start, while their hacks are led up and down the
market-place, on which the inn looks.  They all know our
sportsman, and we feel a reflected credit when we see him
chatting and laughing with them.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, sir, please,&quot; says the coachman.  All the rest of the
passengers are up; the guard is locking up the hind-boot.</P>
<P>&quot;A good run to you!&quot; says the sportsman to the pinks, and is by
the coachman's side in no time.</P>
<P>&quot;Let 'em go, Dick!&quot;  The hostlers fly back, drawing off the
cloths from their glossy loins, and away we go through the
market-place and down the High Street, looking in at the first-
floor windows, and seeing several worthy burgesses shaving
thereat; while all the shopboys who are cleaning the windows,
and housemaids who are doing the steps, stop and look pleased as
we rattle past, as if we were a part of their legitimate
morning's amusement.  We clear the town, and are well out
between the hedgerows again as the town clock strikes eight.</P>
<P>The sun shines almost warmly, and breakfast has oiled all
springs and loosened all tongues.  Tom is encouraged by a remark
or two of the guard's between the puffs of his oily cheroot, and
besides is getting tired of not talking.  He is too full of his
destination to talk about anything else, and so asks the guard
if he knows Rugby.</P>
<P>&quot;Goes through it every day of my life.  Twenty minutes afore
twelve down - ten o'clock up.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What sort of place is it, please?&quot; says Tom.</P>
<P>Guard looks at him with a comical expression.  &quot;Werry out-o'-
the-way place, sir; no paving to streets, nor no lighting.
'Mazin' big horse and cattle fair in autumn - lasts a week - 
just over now.  Takes town a week to get clean after it.
Fairish hunting country.  But slow place, sir, slow place-off
the main road, you see - only three coaches a day, and one on
'em a two-oss wan, more like a hearse nor a coach - Regulator - 
comes from Oxford.  Young genl'm'n at school calls her Pig and
Whistle, and goes up to college by her (six miles an hour) when
they goes to enter.  Belong to school, sir?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; says Tom, not unwilling for a moment that the guard
should think him an old boy.  But then, having some qualms as to
the truth of the assertion, and seeing that if he were to assume
the character of an old boy he couldn't go on asking the
questions he wanted, added - &quot;That is to say, I'm on my way
there.  I'm a new boy.&quot;</P>
<P>The guard looked as if he knew this quite as well as Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;You're werry late, sir,&quot; says the guard; &quot;only six weeks to-day
to the end of the half.&quot;  Tom assented.  &quot;We takes up fine loads
this day six weeks, and Monday and Tuesday arter.  Hopes we
shall have the pleasure of carrying you back.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom said he hoped they would; but he thought within himself that
his fate would probably be the Pig and Whistle.</P>
<P>&quot;It pays uncommon cert'nly,&quot; continues the guard.  &quot;Werry free
with their cash is the young genl'm'n.  But, Lor' bless you, we
gets into such rows all 'long the road, what wi' their pea-
shooters, and long whips, and hollering, and upsetting every one
as comes by, I'd a sight sooner carry one or two on 'em, sir, as
I may be a-carryin' of you now, than a coach-load.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do they do with the pea-shooters?&quot; inquires Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;Do wi' 'em!  Why, peppers every one's faces as we comes near,
'cept the young gals, and breaks windows wi' them too, some on
'em shoots so hard.  Now 'twas just here last June, as we was a-
driving up the first-day boys, they was mendin' a quarter-mile
of road, and there was a lot of Irish chaps, reg'lar roughs, a-
breaking stones.  As we comes up, 'Now, boys,' says young gent
on the box (smart young fellow and desper't reckless), 'here's
fun!  Let the Pats have it about the ears.'  'God's sake sir!'
says Bob (that's my mate the coachman); 'don't go for to shoot
at 'em.  They'll knock us off the coach.'  'Damme, coachee,'
says young my lord, 'you ain't afraid.  - Hoora, boys! let 'em
have it.'  'Hoora!' sings out the others, and fill their mouths
choke-full of peas to last the whole line.  Bob, seeing as 'twas
to come, knocks his hat over his eyes, hollers to his osses, and
shakes 'em up; and away we goes up to the line on 'em, twenty
miles an hour.  The Pats begin to hoora too, thinking it was a
runaway; and first lot on 'em stands grinnin' and wavin' their
old hats as we comes abreast on 'em; and then you'd ha' laughed
to see how took aback and choking savage they looked, when they
gets the peas a-stinging all over 'em.  But bless you, the laugh
weren't all of our side, sir, by a long way.  We was going so
fast, and they was so took aback, that they didn't take what was
up till we was half-way up the line.  Then 'twas, 'Look out
all!' surely.  They howls all down the line fit to frighten you;
some on 'em runs arter us and tries to clamber up behind, only
we hits 'em over the fingers and pulls their hands off; one as
had had it very sharp act'ly runs right at the leaders, as
though he'd ketch 'em by the heads, only luck'ly for him he
misses his tip and comes over a heap o' stones first.  The rest
picks up stones, and gives it us right away till we gets out of
shot, the young gents holding out werry manful with the pea-
shooters and such stones as lodged on us, and a pretty many
there was too.  Then Bob picks hisself up again, and looks at
young gent on box werry solemn.  Bob'd had a rum un in the ribs,
which'd like to ha' knocked him off the box, or made him drop
the reins.  Young gent on box picks hisself up, and so does we
all, and looks round to count damage.  Box's head cut open and
his hat gone; 'nother young gent's hat gone; mine knocked in at
the side, and not one on us as wasn't black and blue somewheres
or another, most on 'em all over.  Two pound ten to pay for
damage to paint, which they subscribed for there and then, and
give Bob and me a extra half-sovereign each; but I wouldn't go
down that line again not for twenty half-sovereigns.&quot;  And the
guard shook his head slowly, and got up and blew a clear, brisk
toot-toot.</P>
<P>&quot;What fun!&quot; said Tom, who could scarcely contain his pride at
this exploit of his future school-fellows.  He longed already
for the end of the half, that he might join them.</P>
<P>&quot;'Taint such good fun, though, sir, for the folk as meets the
coach, nor for we who has to go back with it next day.  Them
Irishers last summer had all got stones ready for us, and was
all but letting drive, and we'd got two reverend gents aboard
too.  We pulled up at the beginning of the line, and pacified
them, and we're never going to carry no more pea-shooters,
unless they promises not to fire where there's a line of Irish
chaps a-stonebreaking.&quot;  The guard stopped and pulled away at
his cheroot, regarding Tom benignantly the while.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, don't stop!  Tell us something more about the pea-
shooting.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, there'd like to have been a pretty piece of work over it
at Bicester, a while back.  We was six mile from the town, when
we meets an old square-headed gray-haired yeoman chap, a-jogging
along quite quiet.  He looks up at the coach, and just then a
pea hits him on the nose, and some catches his cob behind and
makes him dance up on his hind legs.  I see'd the old boy's face
flush and look plaguy awkward, and I thought we was in for
somethin' nasty.</P>
<P>&quot;He turns his cob's head and rides quietly after us just out of
shot.  How that 'ere cob did step!  We never shook him off not a
dozen yards in the six miles.  At first the young gents was
werry lively on him; but afore we got in, seeing how steady the
old chap come on, they was quite quiet, and laid their heads
together what they should do.  Some was for fighting, some for
axing his pardon.  He rides into the town close after us, comes
up when we stops, and says the two as shot at him must come
before a magistrate; and a great crowd comes round, and we
couldn't get the osses to.  But the young uns they all stand by
one another, and says all or none must go, and as how they'd
fight it out, and have to be carried.  Just as 'twas gettin'
serious, and the old boy and the mob was going to pull 'em off
the coach, one little fellow jumps up and says, 'Here - I'll
stay.  I'm only going three miles farther.  My father's name's
Davis; he's known about here, and I'll go before the magistrate
with this gentleman.'  'What! be thee parson Davis's son?' says
the old boy.  'Yes,' says the young un.  'Well, I be mortal
sorry to meet thee in such company; but for thy father's sake
and thine (for thee bist a brave young chap) I'll say no more
about it.'  Didn't the boys cheer him, and the mob cheered the
young chap; and then one of the biggest gets down, and begs his
pardon werry gentlemanly for all the rest, saying as they all
had been plaguy vexed from the first, but didn't like to ax his
pardon till then, 'cause they felt they hadn't ought to shirk
the consequences of their joke.  And then they all got down, and
shook hands with the old boy, and asked him to all parts of the
country, to their homes; and we drives off twenty minutes behind
time, with cheering and hollering as if we was county 'members.
But, Lor' bless you, sir,&quot; says the guard, smacking his hand
down on his knee and looking full into Tom's face, &quot;ten minutes
arter they was all as bad as ever.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom showed such undisguised and open-mouthed interest in his
narrations that the old guard rubbed up his memory, and launched
out into a graphic history of all the performances of the boys
on the roads for the last twenty years.  Off the road he
couldn't go; the exploit must have been connected with horses or
vehicles to hang in the old fellow's head.  Tom tried him off
his own ground once or twice, but found he knew nothing beyond,
and so let him have his head, and the rest of the road bowled
easily away; for old Blow-hard (as the boys called him) was a
dry old file, with much kindness and humour, and a capital
spinner of a yarn when he had broken the neck of his day's work,
and got plenty of ale under his belt.</P>
<P>What struck Tom's youthful imagination most was the desperate
and lawless character of most of the stories.  Was the guard
hoaxing him?  He couldn't help hoping that they were true.  It's
very odd how almost all English boys love danger.  You can get
ten to join a game, or climb a tree, or swim a stream, when
there's a chance of breaking their limbs or getting drowned, for
one who'll stay on level ground, or in his depth, or play quoits
or bowls.</P>
<P>The guard had just finished an account of a desperate fight
which had happened at one of the fairs between the drovers and
the farmers with their whips, and the boys with cricket-bats and
wickets, which arose out of a playful but objectionable practice
of the boys going round to the public-houses and taking the
linch-pins out of the wheels of the gigs, and was moralizing
upon the way in which the Doctor, &quot;a terrible stern man he'd
heard tell,&quot; had come down upon several of the performers,
&quot;sending three on 'em off next morning in a po-shay with a
parish constable,&quot; when they turned a corner and neared the
milestone, the third from Rugby.  By the stone two boys stood,
their jackets buttoned tight, waiting for the coach.</P>
<P>&quot;Look here, sir,&quot; says the guard, after giving a sharp toot-
toot; &quot;there's two on 'em; out-and-out runners they be. They
comes out about twice or three times a week, and spirts a mile
alongside of us.&quot;</P>
<P>And as they came up, sure enough, away went two boys along the
footpath, keeping up with the horses - the first a light, clean-
made fellow going on springs; the other stout and round-
shouldered, labouring in his pace, but going as dogged as a
bull-terrier.</P>
<P>Old Blow-hard looked on admiringly.  &quot;See how beautiful that
there un holds hisself together, and goes from his hips, sir,&quot;
said he; &quot;he's a 'mazin' fine runner.  Now many coachmen as
drives a first-rate team'd put it on, and try and pass 'em.  But
Bob, sir, bless you, he's tender-hearted; he'd sooner pull in a
bit if he see'd 'em a-gettin' beat.  I do b'lieve, too, as that
there un'd sooner break his heart than let us go by him afore
next milestone.&quot;</P>
<P>At the second milestone the boys pulled up short, and waved
their hats to the guard, who had his watch out and shouted
&quot;4.56,&quot; thereby indicating that the mile had been done in four
seconds under the five minutes.  They passed several more
parties of boys, all of them objects of the deepest interest to
Tom, and came in sight of the town at ten minutes before twelve.
Tom fetched a long breath, and thought he had never spent a
pleasanter day.  Before he went to bed he had quite settled that
it must be the greatest day he should ever spend, and didn't
alter his opinion for many a long year - if he has yet.</P>
