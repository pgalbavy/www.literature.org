<p>As in a blessed vision, doubting the reality of it all, she sat
looking upward until his step on some outer floor aroused her
to the wondrous reality.</p>

<p>He came, holding two clay figures. The first was an exquisite
winged shape, standing with delicate limbs parallel, arms extended,
palms outward. The head was lifted a little, poised exquisitely
on the perfect neck. Its loveliness thrilled her.</p>

<p>"Is it an angel?" she asked, innocently.</p>

<p>"No.... I thought you understood&mdash;this is only a sketch I made.
And this is the other." And he placed on a table the second figure,
a smooth, youthful, sensuous shape, looking aside and down at
her own white fingers playing with her hair.</p>

<p>"Is it Eve?" she inquired, wondering.</p>

<p>"These," he said slowly, "are the first two sketches, done without
a model, for my two figures 'Soul' and 'Body'."</p>

<p>She looked at him, not comprehending.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I must have a <em>living</em> model&mdash;for these," he
stammered. "Didn't you understand? I want <em>you</em> to work
from."</p>

<p>From brow to throat the scarlet stain deepened and spread. She
turned, laid one small hand on the back of the chair, faltered,
sank onto it, covering her face.</p>

<p>"I thought you understood," he repeated stupidly. "Forgive me
&mdash;I thought you understood what sort of help I needed." He
dropped on one knee beside her. "I am so sorry. Try to reason
a little. You&mdash;you must know I meant no offense&mdash;that I never
could wish to offend you. Look at me, please; I am not that sort
of a man. Can't you realize how desperate I was&mdash;how I dared hazard
the chance that you might help me?"</p>

<p>She rose, her face still covered.</p>

<p>"<em>Can't</em> you comprehend?" he pleaded, "that I meant no
offense?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes. Let me go."</p>

<p>"Can you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>yes."</p>

<p>"And you cannot&mdash;help me?"</p>

<p>"H-help you?... Oh, no, no, no!" She broke down, sobbing in the
chair, her golden head buried in her arms.</p>

<p>Confused, miserable, he watched her. Already the old helpless
feeling had come surging back, that there was to be no chance
for him in the world, no hope of all he had dared to believe in,
no future. Watching her he felt his own courage falling with her
tears, his own will drooping as she drooped there&mdash;slender and
white in her thin, black gown.</p>

<p>Again he spoke, for the moment forgetting himself.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, because there is nothing to cry about. You know I
did not mean to hurt you; I know that you would help me if you
could. Isn't it true?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"It was only a sculptor who asked you, not a man at all. You
understand what I mean?&mdash;only a poor devil of a sculptor, carried
away by the glamour of a chance for better fortune that seemed
to open before him for a moment. So you must not feel distressed
or sensitive or ashamed&#11834;"</p>

<p>She sat up, wet eyed, cheeks aflame.</p>

<p>"I am thinking of <em>you</em>!" she cried, almost fiercely,
"not of myself; and you don't understand! Do you think I would
cry over myself? <em>I&mdash;</em>it is because I cannot help <em>you</em>!"</p>

<p>He found no words to answer as she rose and moved toward the
door. She crossed the threshold, turned and looked at him. Then
she entered her own doorway.</p>

<p>And the world went badly for her that night, and, after that,
day and night, the world went badly.</p>

<p>Always the confusion of shame and dread returned to burn her;
but that was the least; for in the long hours, lying amid the
fragments of her shattered dreams, the knowledge that he needed
her and that she could not respond, overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>The house, the corridor, her room became unendurable; she desired
to go&mdash;anywhere&mdash;and try to forget. But she could not; she could
not leave, she could not forget, she could not go to him and offer
the only aid he desired, she could not forgive herself.</p>

<p>In vain, in vain, white with the agony of courage, she strove
to teach herself that she was nothing, her body nothing, that
the cost was nothing, compared to the terrible importance of his
necessity. She knew in her heart that she could have died for
him; but&mdash;but&mdash;her courage could go no further.</p>

<p>In terrible silence she walked her room, thinking of him as one
in peril, as one ruined for lack of the aid she withheld. Sometimes
she passed hours on her knees, tearless, wordless; sometimes sheerest
fear set her creeping to the door to peer out, dreading lest his
closed door concealed a tragedy.</p>

<p>And always, burning like twin gray flames before her eyes, she
saw the figures he had made, 'Soul' and 'Body.' Every detail remained
clear; their terrible beauty haunted her. Night after night, rigid
on her bed's edge, she stretched her bared, white arms, staring
at them, then flung them hopelessly across her eyes, whispering,
"I cannot&mdash;O God &mdash;I cannot&mdash;even for him."</p>

<p>And there came a day&mdash;a Saturday&mdash;when the silence of the house,
of her room, the silence in her soul, became insupportable.</p>

<p>All day she walked in the icy, roaring streets, driving herself
forward toward the phantom of forgetfulness which fled before
her like her shadow. And at the edge of noon she found herself&mdash;where
she knew she must come one day&mdash;seeking the woman who made plaster
casts of hands and arms and shapely feet.</p>

<p>For a little while they talked together. The woman surprised,
smiling sometimes, but always very gentle; the girl flushed, stammering,
distressed in forming her naïve questions.</p>

<p>Yes, it could be done; it had been done. But it was a long process;
it must be executed in sections, then set together limb by limb,
for there were many difficulties&mdash;and it was not pleasant to endure,
even sometimes painful.</p>

<p>"I do not mind the pain," said the girl. "Will it scar me?"</p>

<p>"No, not that.... But, another thing; it would be expensive."</p>

<p>"I have my vacation money, and a little more." She named the
sum timidly.</p>

<p>Yes, it was enough. And when could she come for the first casts
to be taken?</p>

<p>She was ready now.</p>

<p>A little later, turning a lovely, flushed face over her bare
shoulder: "One figure stood like this," and, after a pause, "the
other this way.... If you make them from me, can a sculptor work
from life casts such as these?"</p>

<p>A sculptor could.</p>

<p>About dusk she crept home, trembling in every nerve. Her vacation
had begun.</p>

<p>She had been promoted to a position as expert lace buyer, which
permitted larger liberty. From choice she had taken no vacation
during the summer. Now her vacation, which she requested for December,
lasted ten days; and at the end of it her last penny had been
spent, but in a manner so wonderful, so strange, that no maid
ever dreamed such things might be.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Christmas Eve she knelt, crying, before the pedestal."]</p>

<p>And on the last evening of it, which was Christmas Eve, she knelt,
crying, before two pedestals from which rose her body and soul
as white as death.</p>

<p>An hour later the snowy twins stood in his empty studio, swathed
in their corpse-white winding-sheets&mdash;unstained cerements, sealing
beneath their folds her dead pride, dead hope&mdash;all that was delicate
and intimate and subtle and sweet&mdash;slain and in cerements, for
his sake.</p>

<p>And now she must go before he returned. Her small trunk was ready;
her small account settled. With strangely weak and unsteady hands
she stood before the glass knotting her veil.</p>

<p>Since that night together last summer she had not spoken to him,
merely returning his low greeting in the corridor with a silent
little inclination of her head. But, although she had had no speech
with him, she had learned that he was teaching at the League now,
and she knew his hours and his movements well enough to time her
own by them.</p>

<p>He was not due for another hour; she looked out into the snowy
darkness, drawing on her gloves and buttoning the scant fur collar
close about her throat.</p>

<p>The old janitor came to say good-by.</p>

<p>"An' God be with you, miss, this Christmas Eve"&mdash;taking the coin
irresolutely, but pocketing it for fear of hurting her.</p>

<p>His fingers, numbed and aged, fumbling in the pocket encountered
another object.</p>

<p>"Musha, thin, I'm afther forgettin' phwat I'm here f'r to tell
ye, miss," he rambled on. "Misther Landon wishes ye f'r to know
that he do be lavin' the house"&mdash;the old man moistened his lips
in an effort to remember with all the elegance required of him&mdash;"an'
Misther Landon is wishful f'r to say a genteel good luck to ye,
miss."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Landon good-by for me, Patrick. Say&mdash;from me &mdash;God
bless him.... Will you remember?... And a&mdash;a happy Christmas."</p>

<p>"I will, Miss."</p>

<p>She touched her eyes with her handkerchief hastily, and held
out her hand to the old man.</p>

<p>"I think that is all," she whispered.</p>

<p>She was mistaken; the janitor was holding out a note to her.</p>

<p>"In case ye found it onconvaynient f'r to see Misther Landon,
I was to projooce the letter, Miss."</p>

<p>She took it; a shiver passed over her.</p>

<p>When the old man had shambled off down the passage she reëntered
her room, held the envelope a moment close under the lighted lamp,
then nervously tore it wide.</p>

<p>"<em>You will read this in case you refuse to say good-by to
me. But I only wanted to offer you a little gift at Christmastide&mdash;not
in reparation, for I meant no injury&mdash;but in deepest respect for
you. And so I ask you once more to wait for me. Will you?</em>"</p>

<p>Minute after minute she sat there, dumb, confused, nerves at
the breaking point, her heart and soul crying out for him. Then
the memory of what was awaiting him in his studio choked her with
fright. She sprang to her feet, and at the same moment the outer
gate clanged.</p>

<p>Terror froze her; then she remembered that it was too early for
him; it must be the expressman for her trunk. And she went to
the door and opened it.</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" she breathed, shrinking back; but Landon had seen his
letter in her hand, and he followed her into the room.</p>

<p>He was paler than she: his voice was failing him, too, as he
laid his gift on the bare table&mdash;only a little book, prettily
bound.</p>

<p>"Will you take it?" he asked in a colorless voice; but she could
not answer, could not move.</p>

<p>"I wish you a happy Christmas," he whispered. "Good-by."</p>

<p>She strove to meet his eyes, strove to speak, lifted her slim
hand to stay him. It fell, strength spent, in both of his.</p>

<p>Suddenly Time went all wrong, reeling off centuries in seconds.
And through the endless interstellar space that stretched between
her world and his she heard his voice bridging it: "I love you
&mdash;I love you dearly.... Once more I am the beggar&mdash;a beggar
at Christmastide, asking your mercy&mdash;asking more, your love. Dear,
is it plain this time? Is all clear, dearest among women?"</p>

<p>She looked up into his eyes; his hands tightened over hers.</p>

<p>"Can you love me?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered her eyes and the fragrant mouth assented, quivering
under his lips.</p>

<p>Then, without will or effort of her own, from very far away,
her voice stole back to her faintly.</p>

<p>"Is all this true? I have dreamed so long&mdash;so long&mdash;of loving
you&#11834;"</p>

<p>He drew her closer; she laid both hands against his coat and
hid her face between them.</p>

<p>He whispered:</p>

<p>"It was your unselfishness, your sweetness, and&mdash;<em>you</em>&mdash;all
of you&mdash;yes&mdash;your beauty&mdash;the loveliness of you, too! I could
not put it from me; I knew that night that I loved you&mdash;and to-day
they said you were going&mdash;so I came with my Christmas gift&mdash;the
sorry, sorry gift&mdash;myself&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" she whispered, clinging closer. "And what of my gift&mdash;my
twin gifts&mdash;there, in your studio! Oh, you don't know, you don't
know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Dearest!"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you can never know how much easier it had been for me to
die than to love&mdash;as I have loved a man this day."</p>

<p>"Confound you, Williams," I said, blinking.</p>

<p>But he did not hear me, sitting there in a literary revery, mentally
repolishing the carefully considered paragraphs with which he
had just regaled me.</p>

<p>"Williams?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"So&mdash;they're living in Normandy."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Jim Landon and that girl, dammit!" I said, crossly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;oh, yes, of course. Children&mdash;bunches of 'em&mdash;and all that."</p>

<p>"Williams?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"<em>Was</em> she so pretty?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said, absently. "Don't bother me now; I've got
an idea for another story."</p>
