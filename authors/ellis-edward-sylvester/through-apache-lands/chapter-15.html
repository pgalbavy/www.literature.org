<p>Ned designed to drift down stream for a mile or so, by which
time he expected to be at such a distance that there was no further
possible danger of pursuit. It would then be necessary for him
to get forward as fast as he could, taking care to avoid the redskins
who were in front, rather than those in the rear.</p>

<p>He was a little alarmed to find, after going scarcely half that
distance, that the stream was broadening very rapidly. The current
as a consequence, became slower, and when he descried seemingly
a large forest looming up before him, he concluded that the time
had about come for him to disembark, and use his heels. But, prompted
somewhat by curiosity, he remained a while longer, until, before
he was aware, he discovered that the stream had debouched into
a lake, nearly circular in shape, and fully a couple of hundred
yards in diameter. The impetus of the current kept the tree moving
slowly and still more slowly, until it had reached a point near
the middle, when it gradually settled down to a complete standstill.</p>

<p>"That's odd!" exclaimed the lad, looking about him, and seeing
the broad sweep of water on every hand. "If I knew this I think
I should have got off."</p>

<p>It only remained for him to work his way to land, and this he
began doing by using his hands as paddles. It was slow progress;
and he was of the opinion that he had made a rather foolish blunder
in permitting himself to be "carried out to sea" in this fashion.
He was disturbed still further by the appearance of the sky. Dark,
threatening clouds were gathering and sweeping across it, frequently
shutting out the light of the moon and causing the most grotesque
shadows to whisk over the surface of the lake.</p>

<p>The indications were that a violent storm was close at hand,
and he used both hands with all the vigor at his command, and
saw himself gradually nearing land&mdash;the rate being so moderate
that it could not keep pace with his impatience. He was tempted
more than once to leap into the water and swim or wade ashore,
but he restrained himself. On one of these occasions, just as
a heavy cloud approached the moon, and while his raft was a dozen
yards or so from shore, he was alarmed at sight of something approaching
him through the water. What it was he could not conjecture, as
it was low down, and very indistinct on account of the gathering
gloom.</p>

<p>As the cloud touched the moon and obscured the light, this suspicious
object disappeared, and he awaited with no little alarm the outcome
of the mystery. He was sitting motionless, looking and listening,
when the end of the tree was suddenly elevated a full foot, while
the other correspondingly descended.</p>

<p>With a gasp of terror, Ned clutched the limb near him and held
on, not knowing whither he was about to be flung. A muttering
growl at the same instant explained what it all meant, and he
hastily retreated still further upon the tree, expecting every
moment to feel the claws of the wild animal fastened upon him.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that these beasts are after me more than the
Indians," was his thought, as he drew out his revolver, and awaited
the necessity of using it.</p>

<p>Further than placing his paws upon one end of the trunk, and
giving out a threatening growl, the animal did nothing for a few
minutes, while the boy, fully sensible of the value of his ammunition,
was equally lacking in offensive proceedings. Thus matters stood,
while the great heavy cloud floated slowly by the moon, and the
head of the unwelcome stranger gradually came to view.</p>

<p>It was some wild beast, beyond question, but it wasn't a bear.
Its eyes, shining with a phosphorescent glow, and the cavernous
growling that issued from the red jaws, made it seem the most
frightful kind of a monster. Hoping that it was not particularly
hungry, Ned tried the scare game again, flinging up his arms and
shouting, and making noises horrible enough to frighten any one
to whom they remained unexplained. In this case it succeeded admirably.
The creature, whatever it was, must have concluded that it was
something besides a boy with which it had taken passage, and,
after indulging in one prolonged stare, dropped back into the
water and paddled straight for shore.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>NED TRIED THE SCARE GAME AGAIN, FLINGING UP
HIS ARMS AND SHOUTING</em>]</p>

<p>"I don't think Lone Wolf can follow me all along this route,"
concluded the boy, as he resumed his paddling toward shore, and
reached it in the course of the next ten minutes. He had been
cramped up in one position so long that he felt the need of exercise,
and started off at a rapid pace, with no more idea of the precise
direction he was following than if he were blind.</p>

<p>The clouds sweeping across the sky grew heavier and darker, and
the wind, strong and chilling, soughed through the trees of the
forest with a dismal, wailing sound that would have frightened
one of more years than young Chadmund. Even he would have shrunk
from the task of going through the wood had the circumstances
been different, but he was so actuated by the one all-controlling
desire of escape that he forgot the real danger which encompassed
him. Besides the risk of encountering the Apaches, there was the
ever-present peril from wild beasts and venomous serpents. None
of the latter as yet had disturbed him, but he was likely to step
upon some coiling reptile, unseen in the dark, whose sting was
certain death.</p>

<p>It soon became apparent that a storm of a most violent character
was about to burst forth. The wind grew stronger and colder, lightning
flashed athwart the darkening sky, and the thunder boomed with
an increasing power peculiar to warm countries. The wanderer had
been fortunate thus far in preserving himself from a ducking,
and he was still desirous of doing so. There was nothing to be
gained by pressing forward, and he began groping around for some
kind of a shelter. This was difficult to find, as the gloom was
so dense that eyesight was useless, and he could only use his
hands.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll have to climb a tree," he thought, running his
hand along the bark of one.</p>

<p>But at this juncture he ran against a rock, striking with such
violence that he saw stars. As soon as he recovered he began an
examination, and was not a little pleased to find that under one
portion of it there was a hollow big enough for him to crawl in
and protect himself from the tempest. He had scarcely done so
when the storm burst forth.</p>

<p>First a few large drops pattered upon the leaves, and then it
seemed as if the windows of Heaven had been opened. The rain descended
in torrents, the firmament flamed with a blinding intensity&mdash;and
the earth trembled with the reverberating thunder. The vivid sheets
of electric fire made the darkness and gloom deeper by contrast.
The trees, with their swaying branches, and the spear-like columns
of rain, stood out and vanished again so rapidly that the vision
of the appalled lad was dazzled and bewildered. The terrific shocks
coming simultaneously with the lightning, proved that the thunderbolts
were falling all around him, and again and again he thanked that
Providence which had dissuaded him from taking refuge in some
of the trees.</p>

<p><em>Crash!</em></p>

<p>Directly in front of him, an immense giant of the forest was
smitten from top to base, the limbs, leaves, and splinters hurled
in every direction, as if a thousand pounds of powder had been
exploded within. The air was so surcharged with electricity that
Ned felt the effect. A prickling sensation down one entire side
of his body was followed by a partial numbness and paralysis that
alarmed him. With his other hand he hastily rubbed his limbs,
and turned and twisted, fearing that he was becoming helpless.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he regained the strength which had temporarily
departed, and then noticed that the storm was subsiding as rapidly
as it had arisen. The thunder died out in sullen mutterings; the
lightning flashed fitfully, often without any perceptible report
following, and the deluge diminished to a few drops.</p>

<p>"The storm is over, thank heaven!" he exclaimed. "As I have such
a good bed, I may as well stay here till morning."</p>

<p>But at this instant his blood almost froze at the sudden discovery
of a new and deadly peril.</p>
