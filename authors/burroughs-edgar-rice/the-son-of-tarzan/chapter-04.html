The killing of the friendless old Russian, Michael Sabrov,
by his great trained ape, was a matter for newspaper comment
for a few days.  Lord Greystoke read of it, and while taking
special precautions not to permit his name to become connected
with the affair, kept himself well posted as to the police search
for the anthropoid.
<P>
As was true of the general public, his chief interest in the
matter centered about the mysterious disappearance of the slayer.
Or at least this was true until he learned, several days subsequent
to the tragedy, that his son Jack had not reported at the public
school en route for which they had seen him safely ensconced
in a railway carriage.  Even then the father did not connect the
disappearance of his son with the mystery surrounding the
whereabouts of the ape.  Nor was it until a month later that
careful investigation revealed the fact that the boy had left the
train before it pulled out of the station at London, and the cab
driver had been found who had driven him to the address of the
old Russian, that Tarzan of the Apes realized that Akut had in
some way been connected with the disappearance of the boy.
<P>
Beyond the moment that the cab driver had deposited his fare
beside the curb in front of the house in which the Russian had
been quartered there was no clue.  No one had seen either the
boy or the ape from that instant--at least no one who still lived. 
The proprietor of the house identified the picture of the lad as
that of one who had been a frequent visitor in the room of the
old man.  Aside from this he knew nothing.  And there, at the
door of a grimy, old building in the slums of London, the
searchers came to a blank wall--baffled.
<P>
The day following the death of Alexis Paulvitch a youth
accompanying his invalid grandmother, boarded a steamer at Dover. 
The old lady was heavily veiled, and so weakened by age and
sickness that she had to be wheeled aboard the vessel in an
invalid chair.
<P>
The boy would permit none but himself to wheel her, and
with his own hands assisted her from the chair to the interior of
their stateroom--and that was the last that was seen of the old
lady by the ship's company until the pair disembarked.  The boy
even insisted upon doing the work of their cabin steward, since,
as he explained, his grandmother was suffering from a nervous
disposition that made the presence of strangers extremely
distasteful to her.
<P>
Outside the cabin--and none there was aboard who knew what he
did in the cabin--the lad was just as any other healthy, normal
English boy might have been.  He mingled with his fellow passengers,
became a prime favorite with the officers, and struck up numerous
friendships among the common sailors.  He was generous and
unaffected, yet carried an air of dignity and strength of
character that inspired his many new friends with admiration
as well as affection for him.
<P>
Among the passengers there was an American named Condon, a noted
blackleg and crook who was "wanted" in a half dozen of the larger
cities of the United States.  He had paid little attention to the
boy until on one occasion he had seen him accidentally display
a roll of bank notes.  From then on Condon cultivated the
youthful Briton.  He learned, easily, that the boy was traveling
alone with his invalid grandmother, and that their destination
was a small port on the west coast of Africa, a little below the
equator; that their name was Billings, and that they had no
friends in the little settlement for which they were bound. 
Upon the point of their purpose in visiting the place Condon
found the boy reticent, and so he did not push the matter--he
had learned all that he cared to know as it was.
<P>
Several times Condon attempted to draw the lad into a card
game; but his victim was not interested, and the black looks
of several of the other men passengers decided the American to
find other means of transferring the boy's bank roll to his
own pocket.
<P>
At last came the day that the steamer dropped anchor in the
lee of a wooded promontory where a score or more of sheet-
iron shacks making an unsightly blot upon the fair face of
nature proclaimed the fact that civilization had set its heel. 
Straggling upon the outskirts were the thatched huts of natives,
picturesque in their primeval savagery, harmonizing with the
background of tropical jungle and accentuating the squalid
hideousness of the white man's pioneer architecture.
<P>
The boy, leaning over the rail, was looking far beyond the
man-made town deep into the God-made jungle.  A little shiver
of anticipation tingled his spine, and then, quite without
volition, he found himself gazing into the loving eyes of his
mother and the strong face of the father which mirrored, beneath
its masculine strength, a love no less than the mother's
eyes proclaimed.  He felt himself weakening in his resolve. 
Nearby one of the ship's officers was shouting orders to a
flotilla of native boats that was approaching to lighter the
consignment of the steamer's cargo destined for this tiny post.
<P>
"When does the next steamer for England touch here?" the
boy asked.
<P>
"The Emanuel ought to be along most any time now,"
replied the officer.  "I figgered we'd find her here,"
and he went on with his bellowing remarks to the dusty
horde drawing close to the steamer's side.
<P>
The task of lowering the boy's grandmother over the side to
a waiting canoe was rather difficult.  The lad insisted on being
always at her side, and when at last she was safely ensconced in
the bottom of the craft that was to bear them shoreward her
grandson dropped catlike after her.  So interested was he in seeing
her comfortably disposed that he failed to notice the little
package that had worked from his pocket as he assisted in lowering
the sling that contained the old woman over the steamer's side,
nor did he notice it even as it slipped out entirely and dropped
into the sea.
<P>
Scarcely had the boat containing the boy and the old woman
started for the shore than Condon hailed a canoe upon the other
side of the ship, and after bargaining with its owner finally
lowered his baggage and himself aboard.  Once ashore he kept out
of sight of the two-story atrocity that bore the legend "Hotel"
to lure unsuspecting wayfarers to its multitudinous discomforts. 
It was quite dark before he ventured to enter and arrange for
accommodations.
<P>
In a back room upon the second floor the lad was explaining,
not without considerable difficulty, to his grandmother that he
had decided to return to England upon the next steamer.  He was
endeavoring to make it plain to the old lady that she might remain
in Africa if she wished but that for his part his conscience
demanded that he return to his father and mother, who doubtless
were even now suffering untold sorrow because of his absence;
from which it may be assumed that his parents had not been
acquainted with the plans that he and the old lady had made for
their adventure into African wilds.
<P>
Having come to a decision the lad felt a sense of relief from
the worry that had haunted him for many sleepless nights.  When he
closed his eyes in sleep it was to dream of a happy reunion with
those at home.  And as he dreamed, Fate, cruel and inexorable,
crept stealthily upon him through the dark corridor of the squalid
building in which he slept--Fate in the form of the American
crook, Condon.
<P>
Cautiously the man approached the door of the lad's room.
There he crouched listening until assured by the regular
breathing of those within that both slept.  Quietly he
inserted a slim, skeleton key in the lock of the door. 
With deft fingers, long accustomed to the silent manipulation
of the bars and bolts that guarded other men's property, Condon
turned the key and the knob simultaneously.  Gentle pressure
upon the door swung it slowly inward upon its hinges.  The man
entered the room, closing the door behind him.  The moon was
temporarily overcast by heavy clouds.  The interior of the
apartment was shrouded in gloom.  Condon groped his way toward
the bed.  In the far corner of the room something moved--moved
with a silent stealthiness which transcended even the trained
silence of the burglar.  Condon heard nothing.  His attention
was riveted upon the bed in which he thought to find a young
boy and his helpless, invalid grandmother.
<P>
The American sought only the bank roll.  If he could possess
himself of this without detection, well and good; but were he to
meet resistance he was prepared for that too.  The lad's clothes
lay across a chair beside the bed.  The American's fingers felt
swiftly through them--the pockets contained no roll of crisp,
new notes.  Doubtless they were beneath the pillows of the bed.
He stepped closer toward the sleeper; his hand was already half
way beneath the pillow when the thick cloud that had obscured
the moon rolled aside and the room was flooded with light. 
At the same instant the boy opened his eyes and looked straight
into those of Condon.  The man was suddenly conscious that the
boy was alone in the bed.  Then he clutched for his victim's throat. 
As the lad rose to meet him Condon heard a low growl at his back,
then he felt his wrists seized by the boy, and realized that
beneath those tapering, white fingers played muscles of steel.
<P>
He felt other hands at his throat, rough hairy hands that reached
over his shoulders from behind.  He cast a terrified glance
backward, and the hairs of his head stiffened at the sight his eyes
revealed, for grasping him from the rear was a huge, man-like ape. 
The bared fighting fangs of the anthropoid were close to his throat. 
The lad pinioned his wrists.  Neither uttered a sound.  Where was
the grandmother?  Condon's eyes swept the room in a single
all-inclusive glance.  His eyes bulged in horror at the
realization of the truth which that glance revealed.  In the power
of what creatures of hideous mystery had he placed himself!
Frantically he fought to beat off the lad that he might turn upon
the fearsome thing at his back.  Freeing one hand he struck a
savage blow at the lad's face.  His act seemed to unloose a
thousand devils in the hairy creature clinging to his throat. 
Condon heard a low and savage snarl.  It was the last thing that
the American ever heard in this life.  Then he was dragged backward
upon the floor, a heavy body fell upon him, powerful teeth fastened
themselves in his jugular, his head whirled in the sudden blackness
which rims eternity--a moment later the ape rose from his prostrate
form; but Condon did not know--he was quite dead.
<P>
The lad, horrified, sprang from the bed to lean over the body
of the man.  He knew that Akut had killed in his defense, as he
had killed Michael Sabrov; but here, in savage Africa, far from
home and friends what would they do to him and his faithful ape? 
The lad knew that the penalty of murder was death.  He even knew
that an accomplice might suffer the death penalty with the principal. 
Who was there who would plead for them?  All would be against them. 
It was little more than a half-civilized community, and the chances
were that they would drag Akut and him forth in the morning and hang
them both to the nearest tree--he had read of such things being
done in America, and Africa was worse even and wilder than the
great West of his mother's native land.  Yes, they would both be
hanged in the morning!
<P>
Was there no escape?  He thought in silence for a few moments,
and then, with an exclamation of relief, he struck his
palms together and turned toward his clothing upon the chair.
Money would do anything!  Money would save him and Akut!
He felt for the bank roll in the pocket in which he had been
accustomed to carry it.  It was not there!  Slowly at first and
at last frantically he searched through the remaining pockets of
his clothing.  Then he dropped upon his hands and knees and
examined the floor.  Lighting the lamp he moved the bed to one
side and, inch by inch, he felt over the entire floor.  Beside the
body of Condon he hesitated, but at last he nerved himself to
touch it.  Rolling it over he sought beneath it for the money. 
Nor was it there.  He guessed that Condon had entered their room
to rob; but he did not believe that the man had had time to possess
himself of the money; however, as it was nowhere else, it must
be upon the body of the dead man.  Again and again he went
over the room, only to return each time to the corpse; but no
where could he find the money.
<P>
He was half-frantic with despair.  What were they to do? 
In the morning they would be discovered and killed.  For all his
inherited size and strength he was, after all, only a little boy--
a frightened, homesick little boy--reasoning faultily from the
meager experience of childhood.  He could think of but a single
glaring fact--they had killed a fellow man, and they were among
savage strangers, thirsting for the blood of the first victim whom
fate cast into their clutches.  This much he had gleaned from
penny-dreadfuls.
<P>
And they must have money!
<P>
Again he approached the corpse.  This time resolutely.  The ape
squatted in a corner watching his young companion.  The youth
commenced to remove the American's clothing piece by piece,
and, piece by piece, he examined each garment minutely.  Even to
the shoes he searched with painstaking care, and when the last
article had been removed and scrutinized he dropped back upon
the bed with dilated eyes that saw nothing in the present--
only a grim tableau of the future in which two forms swung
silently from the limb of a great tree.
<P>
How long he sat thus he did not know; but finally he was aroused
by a noise coming from the floor below.  Springing quickly to his
feet he blew out the lamp, and crossing the floor silently locked
the door.  Then he turned toward the ape, his mind made up.
<P>
Last evening he had been determined to start for home at the
first opportunity, to beg the forgiveness of his parents for this
mad adventure.  Now he knew that he might never return to them. 
The blood of a fellow man was upon his hands--in his morbid
reflections he had long since ceased to attribute the death
of Condon to the ape.  The hysteria of panic had fastened the
guilt upon himself.  With money he might have bought justice;
but penniless!--ah, what hope could there be for strangers
without money here?
<P>
But what had become of the money?  He tried to recall when
last he had seen it.  He could not, nor, could he, would he have
been able to account for its disappearance, for he had been
entirely unconscious of the falling of the little package from his
pocket into the sea as he clambered over the ship's side into the
waiting canoe that bore him to shore.
<P>
Now he turned toward Akut.  "Come!" he said, in the language of
the great apes. 
<P>
Forgetful of the fact that he wore only a thin pajama suit he
led the way to the open window.  Thrusting his head out he
listened attentively.  A single tree grew a few feet from
the window.  Nimbly the lad sprang to its bole, clinging
cat-like for an instant before he clambered quietly to the
ground below.  Close behind him came the great ape.  Two hundred
yards away a spur of the jungle ran close to the straggling town. 
Toward this the lad led the way.  None saw them, and a moment
later the jungle swallowed them, and John Clayton, future Lord
Greystoke, passed from the eyes and the knowledge of men.
<P>
It was late the following morning that a native houseman
knocked upon the door of the room that had been assigned to
Mrs. Billings and her grandson.  Receiving no response he
inserted his pass key in the lock, only to discover that another
key was already there, but from the inside.  He reported the fact
to Herr Skopf, the proprietor, who at once made his way to the
second floor where he, too, pounded vigorously upon the door. 
Receiving no reply he bent to the key hole in an attempt to look
through into the room beyond.  In so doing, being portly, he lost
his balance, which necessitated putting a palm to the floor to
maintain his equilibrium.  As he did so he felt something soft
and thick and wet beneath his fingers.  He raised his open palm
before his eyes in the dim light of the corridor and peered at it. 
Then he gave a little shudder, for even in the semi-darkness he
saw a dark red stain upon his hand.  Leaping to his feet he hurled
his shoulder against the door.  Herr Skopf is a heavy man--or at
least he was then--I have not seen him for several years.  The frail
door collapsed beneath his weight, and Herr Skopf stumbled
precipitately into the room beyond.
<P>
Before him lay the greatest mystery of his life.  Upon the floor
at his feet was the dead body of a strange man.  The neck was
broken and the jugular severed as by the fangs of a wild beast. 
The body was entirely naked, the clothing being strewn about
the corpse.  The old lady and her grandson were gone.  The window
was open.  They must have disappeared through the window for the
door had been locked from the inside.
<P>
But how could the boy have carried his invalid grandmother
from a second story window to the ground?  It was preposterous.
Again Herr Skopf searched the small room.  He noticed that the
bed was pulled well away from the wall--why?  He looked beneath
it again for the third or fourth time.  The two were gone,
and yet his judgment told him that the old lady could not have
gone without porters to carry her down as they had carried her
up the previous day.
<P>
Further search deepened the mystery.  All the clothing of the
two was still in the room--if they had gone then they must have
gone naked or in their night clothes.  Herr Skopf shook his head;
then he scratched it.  He was baffled.  He had never heard of
Sherlock Holmes or he would have lost no time in invoking the
aid of that celebrated sleuth, for here was a real mystery: 
An old woman--an invalid who had to be carried from the ship to
her room in the hotel--and a handsome lad, her grandson, had
entered a room on the second floor of his hostelry the day before. 
They had had their evening meal served in their room--that was
the last that had been seen of them.  At nine the following morning
the corpse of a strange man had been the sole occupant of that room. 
No boat had left the harbor in the meantime--there was not a
railroad within hundreds of miles--there was no other white
settlement that the two could reach under several days of arduous
marching accompanied by a well-equipped safari.  They had
simply vanished into thin air, for the native he had sent to
inspect the ground beneath the open window had just returned
to report that there was no sign of a footstep there, and what
sort of creatures were they who could have dropped that distance
to the soft turf without leaving spoor?  Herr Skopf shuddered. 
Yes, it was a great mystery--there was something uncanny about
the whole thing--he hated to think about it, and he dreaded the
coming of night.
<P>
It was a great mystery to Herr Skopf--and, doubtless, still is.
