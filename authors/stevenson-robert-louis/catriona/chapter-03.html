<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The next morning, I was no sooner awake in my new lodging than
I was up and into my new clothes; and no sooner the breakfast
swallowed, than I was forth on my adventurers. Alan, I could hope,
was fended for; James was like to be a more difficult affair,
and I could not but think that enterprise might cost me dear,
even as everybody said to whom I had opened my opinion. It seemed
I was come to the top of the mountain only to cast myself down;
that I had clambered up, through so many and hard trials, to be
rich, to be recognised, to wear city clothes and a sword to my
side, all to commit mere suicide at the last end of it, and the
worst kind of suicide, besides, which is to get hanged at the
King’s charges.</p>

<p>What was I doing it for? I asked, as I went down the high Street
and out north by Leith Wynd. First I said it was to save James
Stewart; and no doubt the memory of his distress, and his wife’s
cries, and a word or so I had let drop on that occasion worked
upon me strongly. At the same time I reflected that it was (or
ought to be) the most indifferent matter to my father’s son, whether
James died in his bed or from a scaffold. He was Alan’s cousin,
to be sure; but so far as regarded Alan, the best thing would
be to lie low, and let the King, and his Grace of Argyll, and
the corbie crows, pick the bones of his kinsman their own way.
Nor could I forget that, while we were all in the pot together,
James had shown no such particular anxiety whether for Alan or
me.</p>

<p>Next it came upon me I was acting for the sake of justice: and
I thought that a fine word, and reasoned it out that (since we
dwelt in polities, at some discomfort to each one of us) the main
thing of all must still be justice, and the death of any innocent
man a wound upon the whole community. Next, again, it was the
Accuser of the Brethren that gave me a turn of his argument; bade
me think shame for pretending myself concerned in these high matters,
and told me I was but a prating vain child, who had spoken big
words to Rankeillor and to Stewart, and held myself bound upon
my vanity to make good that boastfulness. Nay, and he hit me with
the other end of the stick; for he accused me of a kind of artful
cowardice, going about at the expense of a little risk to purchase
greater safety. No doubt, until I had declared and cleared myself,
I might any day encounter Mungo Campbell or the sheriff’s officer,
and be recognised, and dragged into the Appin murder by the heels;
and, no doubt, in case I could manage my declaration with success,
I should breathe more free for ever after. But when I looked this
argument full in the face I could see nothing to be ashamed of.
As for the rest, "Here are the two roads," I thought, "and both
go to the same place. It’s unjust that James should hang if I
can save him; and it would be ridiculous in me to have talked
so much and then do nothing. It’s lucky for James of the Glens
that I have boasted beforehand; and none so unlucky for myself,
because now I’m committed to do right. I have the name of a gentleman
and the means of one; it would be a poor duty that I was wanting
in the essence." And then I thought this was a Pagan spirit, and
said a prayer in to myself, asking for what courage I might lack,
and that I might go straight to my duty like a soldier to battle,
and come off again scatheless, as so many do.</p>

<p>This train of reasoning brought me to a more resolved complexion;
though it was far from closing up my sense of the dangers that
surrounded me, nor of how very apt I was (if I went on) to stumble
on the ladder of the gallows. It was a plain, fair morning, but
the wind in the east. The little chill of it sang in my blood,
and gave me a feeling of the autumn, and the dead leaves, and
dead folks’ bodies in their graves. It seemed the devil was in
it, if I was to die in that tide of my fortunes and for other
folks’ affairs. On the top of the Calton Hill, though it was not
the customary time of year for that diversion, some children were
crying and running with their kites. These toys appeared very
plain against the sky; I remarked a great one soar on the wind
to a high altitude and then plump among the whins; and I thought
to myself at sight of it, "There goes Davie."</p>

<p>My way lay over Mouter’s Hill, and through an end of a clachan
on the braeside among fields. There was a whirr of looms in it
went from house to house; bees bummed in the gardens; the neighbours
that I saw at the doorsteps talked in a strange tongue; and I
found out later that this was Picardy, a village where the French
weavers wrought for the Linen Company. Here I got a fresh direction
for Pilrig, my destination; and a little beyond, on the wayside,
came by a gibbet and two men hanged in chains. They were dipped
in tar, as the manner is; the wind span them, the chains clattered,
and the birds hung about the uncanny jumping-jacks and cried.
The sight coming on me suddenly, like an illustration of my fears,
I could scarce be done with examining it and drinking in discomfort.
And, as I thus turned and turned about the gibbet, what should
I strike on, but a weird old wife, that sat behind a leg of it,
and nodded, and talked aloud to herself with becks and courtesies.</p>

<p>"Who are these two, mother?" I asked, and pointed to the corpses.</p>

<p>"A blessing on your precious face!" she cried. "Twa joes [7]
o’mine: just two o’ my old joes, my hinny dear."</p>

<p>"What did they suffer for?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ou, just for the guid cause," said she. "Aften I spaed to them
the way that it would end. Twa shillin’ Scots: no pickle mair;
and there are twa bonny callants hingin’ for ’t! They took it
frae a wean [8] belanged to Brouchton."</p>

<p>"Ay!" said I to myself, and not to the daft limmer, "and did
they come to such a figure for so poor a business? This is to
lose all indeed."</p>

<p>"Gie’s your loof, [9] hinny," says she, "and let me spae your
weird to ye."</p>

<p>"No, mother," said I, "I see far enough the way I am. It’s an
unco thing to see too far in front."</p>

<p>"I read it in your bree," she said. "There’s a bonnie lassie
that has bricht een, and there’s a wee man in a braw coat, and
a big man in a pouthered wig, and there’s the shadow of the wuddy,
[10] joe, that lies braid across your path. Gie’s your loof, hinny,
and let Auld Merren spae it to ye bonny."</p>

<p>The two chance shots that seemed to point at Alan and the daughter
of James More struck me hard; and I fled from the eldritch creature,
casting her a baubee, which she continued to sit and play with
under the moving shadows of the hanged.</p>

<p>My way down the causeway of Leith Walk would have been more pleasant
to me but for this encounter. The old rampart ran among fields,
the like of them I had never seen for artfulness of agriculture;
I was pleased, besides, to be so far in the still countryside;
but the shackles of the gibbet clattered in my head; and the mope
and mows of the old witch, and the thought of the dead men, hag-rode
my spirits. To hang on a gallows, that seemed a hard case; and
whether a man came to hang there for two shillings Scots, or (as
Mr. Stewart had it) from the sense of duty, once he was tarred
and shackled and hung up, the difference seemed small. There might
David Balfour hang, and other lads pass on their errands and think
light of him; and old daft limmers sit at a leg-foot and spae
their fortunes; and the clean genty maids go by, and look to the
other aide, and hold a nose. I saw them plain, and they had grey
eyes, and their screens upon their heads were of the Drummed colours.</p>

<p>I was thus in the poorest of spirits, though still pretty resolved,
when I came in view of Pilrig, a pleasant gabled house set by
the walkside among some brave young woods. The laird’s horse was
standing saddled at the door as I came up, but himself was in
the study, where he received me in the midst of learned works
and musical instruments, for he was not only a deep philosopher
but much of a musician. He greeted me at first pretty well, and
when he had read Rankeillor’s letter, placed himself obligingly
at my disposal.</p>

<p>"And what is it, cousin David!" said he—"since it appears that
we are cousins—what is this that I can do for you! A word to Prestongrange!
Doubtless that is easily given. But what should be the word?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Balfour," said I, "if I were to tell you my whole story
the way it fell out, it’s my opinion (and it was Rankeillor’s
before me) that you would be very little made up with it."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear this of you, kinsman," says he.</p>

<p>"I must not take that at your hands, Mr. Balfour," said I; "I
have nothing to my charge to make me sorry, or you for me, but
just the common infirmities of mankind. ‘The guilt of Adam’s first
sin, the want of original righteousness, and the corruption of
my whole nature,’ so much I must answer for, and I hope I have
been taught where to look for help," I said; for I judged from
the look of the man he would think the better of me if I knew
my questions. [11] "But in the way of worldly honour I have no
great stumble to reproach myself with; and my difficulties have
befallen me very much against my will and (by all that I can see)
without my fault. My trouble is to have become dipped in a political
complication, which it is judged you would be blythe to avoid
a knowledge of."</p>

<p>"Why, very well, Mr. David," he replied, "I am pleased to see
you are all that Rankeillor represented. And for what you say
of political complications, you do me no more than justice. It
is my study to be beyond suspicion, and indeed outside the field
of it. The question is," says he, "how, if I am to know nothing
of the matter, I can very well assist you?"</p>

<p>"Why sir," said I, "I propose you should write to his lordship,
that I am a young man of reasonable good family and of good means:
both of which I believe to be the case."</p>

<p>"I have Rankeillor’s word for it," said Mr. Balfour, "and I count
that a warran-dice against all deadly."</p>

<p>"To which you might add (if you will take my word for so much)
that I am a good churchman, loyal to King George, and so brought
up," I went on.</p>

<p>"None of which will do you any harm," said Mr. Balfour.</p>

<p>"Then you might go on to say that I sought his lordship on a
matter of great moment, connected with His Majesty’s service and
the administration of justice," I suggested.</p>

<p>"As I am not to hear the matter," says the laird, "I will not
take upon myself to qualify its weight. ‘Great moment’ therefore
falls, and ‘moment’ along with it. For the rest I might express
myself much as you propose."</p>

<p>"And then, sir," said I, and rubbed my neck a little with my
thumb, "then I would be very desirous if you could slip in a word
that might perhaps tell for my protection."</p>

<p>"Protection?" says he, "for your protection! Here is a phrase
that somewhat dampens me. If the matter be so dangerous, I own
I would be a little loath to move in it blindfold."</p>

<p>"I believe I could indicate in two words where the thing sticks,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that would be the best," said he.</p>

<p>"Well, it’s the Appin murder," said I.</p>

<p>He held up both his hands. "Sirs! sirs!" cried he.</p>

<p>I thought by the expression of his face and voice that I had
lost my helper.</p>

<p>"Let me explain. . ." I began.</p>

<p>"I thank you kindly, I will hear no more of it," says he. "I
decline <em>in toto</em> to hear more of it. For your name’s sake
and Rankeillor’s, and perhaps a little for your own, I will do
what I can to help you; but I will hear no more upon the facts.
And it is my first clear duty to warn you. These are deep waters,
Mr. David, and you are a young man. Be cautious and think twice."</p>

<p>"It is to be supposed I will have thought oftener than that,
Mr. Balfour," said I, "and I will direct your attention again
to Rankeillor’s letter, where (I hope and believe) he has registered
his approval of that which I design."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said he; and then again, "Well, well! I will do
what I can for you." There with he took a pen and paper, sat a
while in thought, and began to write with much consideration.
"I understand that Rankeillor approved of what you have in mind?"
he asked presently.</p>

<p>"After some discussion, sir, he bade me to go forward in God’s
name," said I.</p>

<p>"That is the name to go in," said Mr. Balfour, and resumed his
writing. Presently, he signed, re-read what he had written, and
addressed me again. "Now here, Mr. David," said he, "is a letter
of introduction, which I will seal without closing, and give into
your hands open, as the form requires. But, since I am acting
in the dark, I will just read it to you, so that you may see if
it will secure your end—</p>

<p>"Pilrig, <em>August</em> 26th, 1751.</p>

<p>"My Lord,—This is to bring to your notice my namesake and cousin,
David Balfour Esquire of Shaws, a young gentleman of unblemished
descent and good estate. He has enjoyed, besides, the more valuable
advantages of a godly training, and his political principles are
all that your lordship can desire. I am not in Mr. Balfour’s confidence,
but I understand him to have a matter to declare, touching His
Majesty’s service and the administration of justice; purposes
for which your Lordship’s zeal is known. I should add that the
young gentleman’s intention is known to and approved by some of
his friends, who will watch with hopeful anxiety the event of
his success or failure.</p>

<p>"Whereupon," continued Mr. Balfour, "I have subscribed myself
with the usual compliments. You observe I have said ‘some of your
friends’; I hope you can justify my plural?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, sir; my purpose is known and approved by more than
one," said I. "And your letter, which I take a pleasure to thank
you for, is all I could have hoped."</p>

<p>"It was all I could squeeze out," said he; "and from what I know
of the matter you design to meddle in, I can only pray God that
it may prove sufficient."</p>
