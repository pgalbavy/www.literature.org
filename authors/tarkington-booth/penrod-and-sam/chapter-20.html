<p>By the time Penrod returned from chasing Duke to the next corner,
Verman had the long, black snake down from the rafter where its
active head had taken refuge, with the rest of it dangling; and
both boys agreed that Mrs. Williams's cat must certainly be able
to "see <em>SOME, </em>anyway", through the meshes of the stocking.</p>

<p>"Well," said Penrod, "it's gettin' pretty near dark, what with
all this bother and mess we been havin' around here, and I expeck
as soon as I get this good ole broom-handle fixed out of the rake
for you, Verman, it'll be about time to begin what we had to go
and take all this trouble <em>FOR</em>."</p>

<p>.... Mr. Schofield had brought an old friend home to dinner with
him: "Dear old Joe Gilling," he called this friend when introducing
him to Mrs. Schofield. Mr. Gilling, as Mrs. Schofield was already
informed by telephone, had just happened to turn up in town that
day, and had called on his classmate at the latter's office. The
two had not seen each other in eighteen years.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilling was a tall man, clad highly in the mode, and brought
to a polished and powdered finish by barber and manicurist; but
his colour was peculiar, being almost unhumanly florid, and, as
Mrs. Schofield afterward claimed to have noticed, his eyes "wore
a nervous, apprehensive look", his hands were tremulous, and his
manner was "queer and jerky"&mdash;at least, that is how she defined
it.</p>

<p>She was not surprised to hear him state that he was travelling
for his health and not upon business. He had not been really well
for several years, he said.</p>

<p>At that, Mr. Schofield laughed and slapped him heartily on the
back.</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy!" Mr. Gilling cried, leaping in his chair. "What IS
the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" Mr. Schofield laughed. "I just slapped you the way
we used to slap each other on the campus. What I was going to
say was that you have no business being a bachelor. With all your
money, and nothing to do but travel and sit around hotels and
clubs, no wonder you've grown bilious."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I'm not bilious," Mr. Gilling said uncomfortably. "I'm
not bilious at all."</p>

<p>"You ought to get married," Mr. Schofield returned. "You ought&mdash;"
He paused, for Mr. Gilling had jumped again. "What's the trouble,
Joe?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I thought perhaps&mdash;perhaps you were going to slap me
on the back again."</p>

<p>"Not this time," Mr. Schofield said, renewing his laughter. "Well,
is dinner about ready?" he asked, turning to his wife. "Where
are Margaret and Penrod?"</p>

<p>"Margaret's just come in," Mrs. Schofield answered. "She'll be
down in a minute, and Penrod's around somewhere."</p>

<p>"Penrod?" Mr. Gilling repeated curiously, in his nervous, serious
way. "What is Penrod?"</p>

<p>And at this, Mrs. Schofield joined in her husband's laughter.
Mr. Schofield explained.</p>

<p>"Penrod's our young son," he said. "He's not much for looks,
maybe; but he's been pretty good lately, and sometimes we're almost
inclined to be proud of him. You'll see him in a minute, old Joe!"</p>

<p>Old Joe saw him even sooner. Instantly, as Mr. Schofield finished
his little prediction, the most shocking uproar ever heard in
that house burst forth in the kitchen. Distinctly Irish shrieks
unlimited came from that quarter&mdash;together with the clashing of
hurled metal and tin, the appealing sound of breaking china, and
the hysterical barking of a dog.</p>

<p>The library door flew open, and Mrs. Cullen appeared as a mingled
streak crossing the room from one door to the other. She was followed
by a boy with a coal-black nose and between his feet, as he entered,
there appeared a big long, black, horrible snake, with frantic
legs springing from what appeared to be its head; and it further
fulfilled Mrs. Cullen's description by making a fizzin' noise.
Accompanying the snake, and still faithfully endeavouring to guide
it with the detached handle of a rake, was a small black demon
with a gassly white forehead and gasslier white hair. Duke evidently
still feeling his bath, was doing all in his power to aid the
demon in making the snake step lively. A few kitchen implements
followed this fugitive procession through the library doorway.</p>

<p>The long, black snake became involved with a leg of the heavy
table in the centre of the room. The head developed spasms of
agility; there were clangings and rippings, then the foremost
section of the long, black snake detached itself, bounded into
the air, and, after turning a number of somersaults, became, severally,
a torn stocking, excelsior, and a lunatic cat. The ears of this
cat were laid back flat upon its head and its speed was excessive
upon a fairly circular track it laid out for itself in the library.
Flying round this orbit, it perceived the open doorway; passed
through it, thence to the kitchen, and outward and onward &mdash;Della
having left the kitchen door open in her haste as she retired
to the backyard.</p>

<p>The black demon with the gassly white forehead and hair, finding
himself in the presence of grown people who were white all over,
turned in his tracks and followed Mrs. Williams's cat to the great
outdoors. Duke preceded Verman. Mrs. Cullen vanished. Of the apparition,
only wreckage and a rightfully apprehensive Penrod were left.</p>

<p>"But where," Mrs. Schofield began, a few minutes later, looking
suddenly mystified&mdash;"where&mdash;where&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where what?" Mr. Schofield asked testily. "What are you talking
about?"  His nerves were jarred, and he was rather hoarse after
what he had been saying to Penrod. (That regretful necromancer
was now upstairs doing unhelpful things to his nose over a washstand.)
"What do you mean by, 'Where, where, where?'" Mr. Schofield demanded.
"I don't see any sense to it."</p>

<p>"But where is your old classmate?" she cried. "Where's Mr. Gilling?"</p>

<p>She was the first to notice this striking absence.</p>

<p>"By George!" Mr. Schofield exclaimed. "Where IS old Joe?"</p>

<p>Margaret intervened. "You mean that tall, pale man who was calling?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Pale, no!" said her father. "He's as flushed as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was pale when <em>I</em> saw him," Margaret said. "He had
his hat and coat, and he was trying to get out of the front door
when I came running downstairs. He couldn't work the catch for
a minute; but before I got to the foot of the steps he managed
to turn it and open the door. He went out before I could think
what to say to him, he was in such a hurry. I guess everything
was so confused you didn't notice&mdash;but he's certainly gone."</p>

<p>Mrs. Schofield turned to her husband.</p>

<p>"But I thought he was going to stay to dinner!" she cried.</p>

<p>Mr. Schofield shook his head, admitting himself floored. Later,
having mentally gone over everything that might shed light on
the curious behaviour of old Joe, he said, without preface:</p>

<p>"He wasn't at all dissipated when we were in college."</p>

<p>Mrs. Schofield nodded severely. "Maybe this was just the best
thing could have happened to him, after all," she said.</p>

<p>"It may be," her husband returned. "I don't say it isn't. <em>BUT
</em>that isn't going to make any difference in what I'm going
to do to Penrod!"</p>
