<p>"What do you say to this, my boy? Did I prophesy it all, or did I not?
Read my pamphlet on <u>The Channel in the Year 2000</u> and you'll see. And
then remember all I told you the other morning, at Newhaven station.
Well, there you are: the two countries are joined together as they
were once before, in the Eocene epoch."
</p><p>Awakened with a start by Old Sandstone, Simon, with eyes still heavy
with slumber, gazed vacantly at the hotel bed-room in which he had
been sleeping, at his old professor, walking to and fro, and at
another person, who was sitting in the dark and who seemed to be an
acquaintance of Old Sandstone's.
</p><p>"Ah!" yawned Simon. "But what's the time?"
</p><p>"Seven o'clock in the evening, my son."
</p><p>"What? Seven o'clock? Have I been sleeping since last night's meeting
at the Casino?"
</p><p>"Rather! I was strolling about this morning, when I heard of your
adventure. 'Simon Dubosc! I know him.' said I. I ran like mad. I
rapped on the door. I came in. Nothing would wake you. I went away,
came back again and so on, until I decided to sit down by your bedside
and wait."
</p><p>Simon leapt out of bed. New clothes and clean linen had been laid out
in the bathroom; and he saw, hanging on the wall, his jacket, the same
with which he had covered the bare shoulders of the young woman whom
he had released.
</p><p>"Who brought that?" he asked.
</p><p>"That? What?" asked Old Sandstone.
</p><p>Simon turned to him.
</p><p>"Tell me, professor, did any one come to this room while you were
here?"
</p><p>"Yes, lots of people. They came in as they liked: admirers, idle
sightseers. . . ."
</p><p>"Did a woman come in?"
</p><p>"Upon my word, I didn't notice. . . . Why?"
</p><p>"Why?" replied Simon, explaining. "Because last night, while I was
asleep, I several times had the impression that a woman came up to me
and bent over me. . . ."
</p><p>Old Sandstone shrugged his shoulders:
</p><p>"You've been dreaming, my boy. When one's badly overtired, one's
likely to have those nightmares. . . ."
</p><p>"But it wasn't in the very least a nightmare!" said Simon, laughing.
</p><p>"It's stuff and nonsense, in any case!" cried Old Sandstone. "What
does it matter? There's only one thing that matters: this sudden
joining up of the two coasts . . . ! It's fairly tremendous, what?
What do you think of it? It's more than a bridge thrown from shore to
shore. It's more than a tunnel. It's a flesh-and-blood tie, a
permanent junction, an isthmus, what? The Sussex Isthmus, the Isthmus
of Normandy, they've already christened it."
</p><p>Simon jested:
</p><p>"Oh, an isthmus! . . . A mere causeway, at most!"
</p><p>"You're drivelling!" cried Old Sandstone. "Don't you know what
happened last night? Why, of course not, the fellow knows nothing! He
was asleep! . . . Then you didn't realize that there was another
earthquake? Quite a slight one, but still . . . an earthquake? No? You
didn't wake up? In that case, my boy, listen to the incredible truth,
which surpasses what any one could have foreseen. It's no longer a
question of the strip of earth which you crossed from Dieppe to
Hastings. That was the first attempt, just a little trial phenomenon.
But since then . . . oh, since then, my boy . . . you're listening,
aren't you? Well, there, from Fécamp to Cape Gris-nez in France and
from the west of Brighton to Folkestone in England: all that part, my
boy, is now one solid mass. Yes, it forms a permanent junction,
seventy to ninety miles wide, a bit of exposed ground equivalent at
least to two large French departments or two fair-sized English
counties. Nature hasn't done badly . . . for a few hours' work! What
say you?"
</p><p>Simon listened in amazement:
</p><p>"Is it possible? Are you sure? But then it will be the cause of
unspeakable losses. Think: all the coast-towns ruined . . . and trade
. . . navigation. . . ."
</p><p>And Simon, thinking of his father and the vessels locked up in Dieppe
harbour, repeated:
</p><p>"Are you quite sure?"
</p><p>"Why, of course I am!" said Old Sandstone, to whom all these
considerations were utterly devoid of interest. "Of course I'm sure! A
hundred telegrams, from all sides, vouch for the fact. What's more,
read the evening papers. Oh, I give you my word, it's a blessed
revolution! . . . The earthquake? The victims? We hardly mention them!
. . . Your Franco-English raid? An old story! No, there's only one
thing that matters to-day, on this side of the Channel: England is no
longer an Island; she forms part of the European continent; she is
riveted on to France!"
</p><p>"This," said Simon, "is one of the greatest facts in history!"
</p><p>"It's <u>the</u> greatest, my son. Since the world has been a world and
since men have been gathered into nations, there has been no physical
phenomenon of greater importance than this. And to think that I
predicted the whole thing, the causes and the effects, the causes
which I am the only one to know!"
</p><p>"And what are they?" asked Simon. "How is it that I was able to pass?
How is it. . . ."
</p><p>Old Sandstone checked him with a gesture which reminded Simon of the
way in which his former lecturer used to begin his explanations at
college; and the old codger, taking a pen and a sheet of paper,
proceeded:
</p><p>"Do you know what a fault is? Of course not! Or a horst? Ditto! Oh, a
geology-lesson at Dieppe college was so many hours wasted! Well, lend
me your ears, young Dubosc! I will be brief and to the point. The
terrestrial rind--that is, the crust which surrounds the internal
fire-ball, of solidified elements and eruptive or sedimentary
rocks--consists throughout of layers superposed like the pages of a
book. Imagine forces of some kind, acting laterally, to compress those
layers. There will be corrugations, sometimes actual fractures, the
two sides of which, sliding one against the other, will be either
raised or depressed. Faults is the name which we give to the fractures
that penetrate the terrestrial shell and separate two masses of rock,
one of which slides over the plane of fracture. The fault, therefore,
reveals an edge, a lower lip produced by the subsidence of the soil,
and an upper lip produced by an elevation. Now it happens that
suddenly, after thousands and thousands of years, this upper lip,
under the action of irresistible tangential forces, will rise, shoot
upwards, and form considerable outthrows, to which we give the name of
horsts. This is what has just taken place. . . . There exists in
France, marked on the geological charts, a fault known as the Rouen
fault, which is an important dislocation of the Paris basin. Parallel
to the corrugations of the soil, which have wrinkled the cretaceous
and tertiary deposits in this region from north-east to north-west, it
runs from Versailles to seventy-five miles beyond Rouen. At Maromme,
we lose it. But I, Simon, have found it again in the quarries above
Longueville and also not far from Dieppe. And lastly I have found it
. . . where do you think? In England, at Eastbourne, between Hastings
and Newhaven! Same composition, same disposition. There was no
question of a mistake. It ran from France to England! It ran under the
Channel. . . . Ah, how I have studied it, my fault, Old Sandstone's
fault, as I used to call it! How I have sounded it, deciphered its
meanings, questioned it, analysed it! And then, suddenly in 1912, some
seismic shocks affected the table-lands of the Seine-Inférieure and
the Somme and acted in an abnormal manner as I was able to prove--on
the tides! Shocks in Normandy! In the Somme! Right out at sea! Do you
grasp the strangeness of such a phenomenon and how, on the other hand,
it acquired a significant value from the very fact that it took place
along a fault? Might we not suppose that there were stresses along
this fault, that captive forces were seeking to escape through the
earth's crust and attacking the points of least resistance, which
happened to lie precisely along the lines of the faults? . . . You may
call it an improbable theory. Perhaps so; but at any rate it seemed
worth verifying. And I did verify it. I made diving-experiments within
sight of the French coast. At my fourth descent, in the Ridin de
Dieppe, where the depth is only thirty feet, I discovered traces of an
eruption in the two blocks of a fault all of whose elements tallied
with those of the Anglo-Norman fault . . . That was all I wanted to
know. There was nothing more to do but wait . . . a century or two
. . . or else a few hours. . . . Meanwhile it was patent to me that
sooner or later the fragile obstacle opposed to the internal energies
would break down and the great upheaval would come to pass. It has
come to pass."
</p><p>Simon listened with growing interest. Old Sandstone illustrated his
lecture with diagrams drawn with broad strokes of the pen and smeared
with blots which his sleeve or fingers generously spread all over the
paper. Drops of sweat also played their part, falling from his
forehead, for Old Sandstone was always given to perspiring copiously.
</p><p>He repeated:
</p><p>"It has come to pass, with a whole train of precursory or concomitant
phenomena: submarine eruptions, whirlpools, boats and ships hurled
into the air and drawn under by the most terrible suction; and then
seismic tremors, more or less marked, cyclones, waterspouts and the
devil's own mischief; and then a cataclysm of an earthquake. And
immediately afterwards, indeed at the same moment, the shooting up of
one lip of the fault, projecting from one coast to the other, over a
width of seventy or eighty miles. And then, on the top of it, you,
Simon Dubosc, crossing the Channel at a stride. And this perhaps was
not the least remarkable fact, my boy, in the whole story."
</p><p>Simon was silent for some time. Then he said:
</p><p>"So far, so good. You have explained the emergence of the narrow belt
of earth which I walked along and whose width I measured with my eyes,
I might say, incessantly. But how do you explain the emergence of this
immense region which now fills the Straits of Dover and part of the
Channel?"
</p><p>"Perhaps the Anglo-Norman fault had ramifications in the affected
areas?"
</p><p>"I repeat, I saw only a narrow belt of land."
</p><p>"That is to say, you saw and crossed only the highest crests of the
upheaved region, crests forming a ridge. But this region was thrown up
altogether; and you must have noticed that the waves, instead of
subsiding, were rolling over miles of beach."
</p><p>"That is so. Nevertheless the sea was there and is there no longer."
</p><p>"It is there no longer because it has receded. Phenomena of this
extent produce reactions beyond their immediate field of activity and
give rise to other phenomena, which in turn react upon the first. And,
if this dislocation of the bottom of the Channel has raised one part,
it may very well, in some other submarine part, have provoked
subsidences and ruptures by which the sea has escaped through the
crust. Observe that a reduction of level of six to nine feet was
enough to turn those miles of barely covered beach into permanent dry
land."
</p><p>"A supposition, my dear professor."
</p><p>"Nothing of the sort!" cried Old Sandstone, striking the table with
his fists. "Nothing of the sort! I have positive evidence of this
also; and I shall publish all my proofs at a suitable moment, which
will not be long delayed."
</p><p>He drew from his pocket the famous locked wallet, whose grease-stained
morocco had caught Simon's eye at Newhaven, and declared:
</p><p>"The truth will emerge from this, my lad, from this wallet in which my
notes have been accumulating, four hundred and fifteen notes which
must needs serve for reference. For, now that the phenomena has come
to pass and all its mysterious causes have been wiped out by the
upheaval, people will never know anything except what I have observed
by personal experiments. They will put forward theories, draw
inferences, form conclusions. <u>But they will not see.</u> Now I . . .
have <u>seen</u>."
</p><p>Simon, who was only half listening, interrupted:
</p><p>"In the meantime, my dear professor, I am hungry. Will you have some
dinner?"
</p><p>"No, thanks. I must catch the train to Dover and cross to-night. It
seems the Calais-Dover boats are running again; and I have no time to
lose if I'm to publish an article and take up a definite position." He
glanced at his watch. "Phew! It's jolly late! . . . If only I don't
lose my train! . . . See you soon, my boy!" . . .
</p><p>He departed.
</p><p>The other person sitting in the dark had not stirred during this
conversation and, to Simon's great astonishment, did not stir either
after Old Sandstone had taken his leave. Simon, at switching on the
light, was amazed to find himself face to face with an individual
resembling in every respect the man whose body he had seen near the
wreck on the previous evening. There was the same brick-red face, the
same prominent cheek-bones, the same long hair, the same buff leather
clothing. This man, however, was very much younger, with a noble
bearing and a handsome face.
</p><p>"A true Indian chief," thought Simon, "and it seems to me that I have
seen him before. . . . Yes, I have certainly seen him somewhere. But
where? And when?"
</p><p>The stranger was silent. Simon asked him:
</p><p>"What can I do for you, please?"
</p><p>The other had risen to his feet. He went to the little table on which
Simon had emptied his pockets, took up the coin with the head of
Napoleon I. which Simon had found the day before and, speaking
excellent French, but in a voice whose guttural tone harmonized with
his appearance, said:
</p><p>"You picked up this coin yesterday, on your way here, near a dead
body, did you not?"
</p><p>His guess was so correct and so unexpected that Simon could but
confirm it:
</p><p>"I did . . . near a man who had just been stabbed to death."
</p><p>"Perhaps you were able to trace the murderer's footprints?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"They were prints of bathing-shoes or tennis-shoes, with patterned
rubber soles?"
</p><p>"Yes, yes!" said Simon, more and more puzzled. "But how do you know
that?"
</p><p>"Well, sir," continued the man whom Simon silently called the Indian,
without replying to the question, "Well, sir, yesterday one of my
friends, Badiarinos by name, and his niece Dolores, wishing to explore
the new land after the convulsions of the morning, discovered, in the
harbour, amid the ruins, a narrow channel which communicated with the
sea and was still free at that moment. A man who was getting into a
boat offered to take my friend and his niece along with him. After
rowing for some time, they saw several large wrecks and landed.
Badiarinos left his niece in the boat and went off in one direction,
while their companion took another. An hour later, the latter returned
alone, carrying an old broken cash-box with gold escaping from it.
Seeing blood on one of his sleeves, Dolores became alarmed and tried
to get out of the boat. He flung himself upon her and, in spite of her
desperate resistance, succeeded in tying her up. He took the oars
again and turned back along the new coast-line. On the way, he decided
to get rid of her and threw her overboard. She had the good luck to
fall on a sandbank which became uncovered a few minutes later and
which was soon joined to the mainland. For all that, she would have
been dead if you had not released her."
</p><p>"Yes," murmured Simon, "a Spaniard, isn't she? Very beautiful. . . . I
saw her again at the casino."
</p><p>"We spent the whole evening," continued the Indian, in the same
impassive tones, "hunting for the murderer, at the meeting in the
casino, in the bars of the hotels, in the public-houses, everywhere.
This morning we began again . . . and I came here, wishing also to
bring you the coat which you had lent to my friend's niece."
</p><p>"It was you, then? . . ."
</p><p>"Now, on entering the corridor upon which your room opens, I heard
someone groaning and I saw, a little way ahead of me--the corridor is
very dark--I saw a man dragging himself along the floor, wounded,
half-dead. A servant and I carried him into one of the rooms which are
being used for infirmary purposes; and I could see that he had been
stabbed between the shoulders . . . as my friend was! Was I on the
track of the murderer? It was difficult to make enquiries in this
great hotel, crammed with the mixed crowd of people who have come here
for shelter. At last I discovered that, a little before nine o'clock,
a lady's maid, coming from outside, with a letter in her hand, had
asked the porter for M. Simon Dubosc. The porter replied, 'Second
floor, room 44.'"
</p><p>"But I haven't had that letter!" Simon remarked.
</p><p>"The porter, luckily for you, mistook the number. You're in room 43."
</p><p>"And what became of it? Who sent it?"
</p><p>"Here is a piece of the envelope which I picked up," replied the
Indian. "You can still make out a seal with Lord Bakefield's arms. So
I went to Battle House."
</p><p>"And you saw . . . ?"
</p><p>"Lord Bakefield, his wife and his daughter had left for London this
morning, by motor. But I saw the maid, the one who had been to the
hotel with a letter for you from her mistress. As she was going
upstairs, she was overtaken by a gentleman who said, 'M. Simon Dubosc
is asleep and said I was to let no one in. I'll give him the letter.'
The maid therefore handed him the letter and accepted a tip of a
louis. Here's the louis. It's one with the head of Napoleon I. and the
date 1807 and is therefore precisely similar to the coin which you
picked up near my friend's body."
</p><p>"And then?" asked Simon, anxiously. "Then this man . . . ?"
</p><p>"The man, having read the letter, went and knocked at room 44, which
is the next room to yours. Your neighbour opened the door and was
seized by the throat, while the murderer, with his free arm, drove a
dagger into his neck, above the shoulders."
</p><p>"Do you mean to say that he was stabbed instead of me? . . ."
</p><p>"Yes, instead of you. But he is not dead. They will pull him through."
</p><p>Simon was stunned.
</p><p>"It's dreadful!" he muttered. "Again, that particular way of striking!
. . ."
</p><p>After a short pause, he asked:
</p><p>"Do you know nothing of the contents of the letter?"
</p><p>"From some words exchanged by Lord Bakefield and his daughter the maid
gathered that they were discussing the wreck of the <u>Queen Mary</u>, the
steamer on which Miss Bakefield had been shipwrecked the other day and
which must be lying high and dry by now. Miss Bakefield appears to
have lost a miniature."
</p><p>"Yes," said Simon, thoughtfully, "yes, I dare say. But it is most
distressing that this letter was not placed in my own hands. The maid
ought never to have given it up."
</p><p>"Why should she have been suspicious?"
</p><p>"What! Of the first person she met?"
</p><p>"But she knew him."
</p><p>"She knew this man?"
</p><p>"Certainly. She had often seen him at Lord Bakefield's; he is a
frequent visitor to the house."
</p><p>"Then she was able to give you his name?"
</p><p>"She told me his name."
</p><p>"Well?"
</p><p>"His name's Rolleston."
</p><p>Simon gave a start.
</p><p>"Rolleston!" he exclaimed. "But that's impossible! . . . Rolleston!
What madness! . . . What's the fellow like? Give me a description of
him."
</p><p>"The man whom the maid and I saw is very tall, which enables him to
bend over his victims and stab them from above between the shoulders.
He is thin . . . stoops a little . . . and he's very pale. . . ."
</p><p>"Stop!" ordered Simon, impressed by this description, which was that
of Edward. "Stop! . . . The man is a friend of mine and I'll answer
for him as I would for myself. Rolleston a murderer! What nonsense!"
</p><p>And Simon broke into a nervous laugh, while the Indian, still
impassive, resumed:
</p><p>"Among other matters, the maid told me of a public-house, frequented
by rather doubtful people, where Rolleston, a great whiskey-drinker,
was a familiar customer. This information was found to be correct.
The barman, whom I tipped lavishly, told me that Rolleston had just
been there, at about twelve o'clock, that he had enlisted half-a-dozen
rascals who were game for anything and that the object of the
expedition was the wreck of the <u>Queen Mary</u>. I was now fully
informed. The whole complicated business was beginning to have a
meaning; and I at once made the necessary preparations, though I made
a point of coming back here constantly, so that I might be present
when you awoke and tell you the news. Moreover, I took care that your
friend, Mr. Sandstone, should watch over you; and I locked your
pocketbook, which was lying there for anybody to help himself from, in
this drawer. I took ten thousand francs out of it to finance our
common business."
</p><p>Simon was past being astonished by the doings of this strange
individual. He could have taken all the notes with which the
pocketbook was crammed; he had taken only ten. He was at least an
honest man.
</p><p>"Our business?" said Simon. "What do you mean by that?"
</p><p>"It will not take long to explain, M. Dubosc," replied the Indian,
speaking as a man who knows beforehand that he has won his cause.
"It's this. Miss Bakefield lost, in the wreck of the <u>Queen Mary</u>, a
miniature of the greatest value; and her letter was asking you to go
and look for it. The letter was intercepted by Rolleston, who was thus
informed of the existence of this precious object and at the same
time, no doubt, became acquainted with Miss Bakefield's feelings
towards you. If we admit that Rolleston, as the maid declares, is in
love with Miss Bakefield, this in itself explains his pleasant
intention of stabbing you. At any rate, after recruiting half-a-dozen
blackguards of the worst kind, he set out for the wreck of the <u>Queen
Mary</u>. Are you going to leave the road clear for him, M. Dubosc?"
</p><p>Simon did not at once reply. He was thinking. How could he fail to be
struck by the logic of the facts that had come to his notice? Nor
could he forget Rolleston's habits, his way of living, his love of
whisky and his general extravagance. Nevertheless, he once more
asserted;
</p><p>"Rolleston is incapable of such a thing."
</p><p>"All right," said the Indian. "But certain men have set out to seize
the <u>Queen Mary</u>. Are you going to leave the road clear for them? I'm
not. I have the death of my friend Badiarinos to avenge. You have
Miss Bakefield's letter to bear in mind. We will make a start then.
Everything is arranged. Four of my comrades have been notified. I have
bought arms, horses and enough provisions to last us. I repeat,
everything is ready. What are you going to do?"
</p><p>Simon threw off his dressing-gown and snatched at his clothes:
</p><p>"I shall come with you."
</p><p>"Oh, well," said the Indian smiling, "if you imagine that we can
venture on the new land in the middle of the night! What about the
water-courses? And the quicksands? And all the rest of it? To say
nothing of the devil's own fog! No, no, we shall start to-morrow
morning, at four o'clock. In the meantime, eat, M. Dubosc, and sleep."
</p><p>Simon protested:
</p><p>"Sleep! Why, I've done nothing else since yesterday!"
</p><p>"That's not enough. You have undergone the most terrible exertions;
and this will be a trying expedition, very trying and very dangerous.
You can take Lynx-Eye's word for it."
</p><p>"Lynx-Eye?"
</p><p>"Antonio or Lynx-Eye: those are my names," explained the Indian.
"Then to-morrow morning, M. Dubosc!"
</p><p>Simon obeyed like a child. Since they had been living for the past few
days in such a topsy-turvy world, could he do better than follow the
advice of a man whom he had never seen, who was a Red Indian and who
was called Lynx-Eye?
</p><p>When he had had his meal, he glanced through an evening paper. There
was an abundance of news, serious and contradictory. It was stated
that Southampton and Le Havre were blocked. It was said that the
British fleet was immobilized at Portsmouth. The rivers, choked at
their mouths, were overflowing their banks. Everywhere all was
disorder and confusion; communications were broken, harbours were
filled with sand, ships were lying on their sides, trade was
interrupted; everywhere devastation reigned and famine and despair;
the local authorities were impotent and the governments distraught.
</p><p>It was late when Simon at last fell into a troubled sleep.
</p><p>It seemed to him that after an hour or two some one opened the door of
his room; and he remembered that he had not bolted it. Light footsteps
crossed the carpet. Then he had the impression that some one bent
over him and that this some one was a woman. A cool breath caressed
his face and in the darkness he divined a shadow moving quickly away.
</p><p>He tried to switch on the light, but there was no current.
</p><p>The shadow left the room. Was it the young woman whom he had released,
who had come? But why should she have come?
