<p>It was characteristic of Larry Murphy and Wharton Edwards that
each should hasten to risk his own life for the other.</p>

<p>When the latter made his leap across the chasm, through which
the water rushed, with his rifle that had been left there, he
had no thought of the peril in which he placed himself. Had he
turned on the instant, or sprang back to the bluff he had just
left, he would have had a companion, with a good weapon between
them, even though he possessed no gun himself.</p>

<p>But that would have placed the Irish lad in the extremity of
peril, as Wharton well knew, and he determined to face the danger
alone, reasoning that it was useless to involve both as long as
it could be prevented.</p>

<p>The earnestness of Wharton caused Larry to withdraw from the
gorge until he was among the trees beyond, when he halted for
a moment, and, reflecting on the situation, read the purpose of
his friend.</p>

<p>"I see through the trick," he muttered, angry with himself that
he had been duped even for a few moments, "and it won't work on
me. Larry Murphy isn't to be left out of this business."</p>

<p>It was all well enough to form this resolution, but the youth
was confronted by the query as to how his friend was to receive
any practical benefit from his efforts. Peering from the trees
in the direction of the gorge, he saw nothing of him, nor of the
Indians who he was sure were there.</p>

<p>Nothing would have pleased Larry more that to repeat the performance
of Wharton, and thereby place himself on the other side of the
gorge; but he saw no way of doing it without a fatal delay. It
was utterly beyond his power to make the leap which was so easy
for the other. He knew that if he attempted it he would plump
down into the torrent and go over the falls again, unless he swam
out, as did the bear, on the same side from which he entered.</p>

<p>There was no break in the bluffs across stream by which one could
climb out above the falls, so that the only feasible way open
to him to reach Wharton was by swimming the torrent below the
falls. That, as we have said, involved a delay which, under the
circumstances, was fatal to all chance of giving his friend any
practical help. But Larry could not stand idle. In the blind hope
of doing something, he hurried down stream and approached it again
at the point where he had entered it before, and whence the bear
had emerged.</p>

<p>It was as he feared. He might as well have tried to climb the
smooth face of a perpendicular wall as to leave the torrent at
any point above the falls, to say nothing of the danger of being
swept over the latter.</p>

<p>A slight bend in the stream enabled him to discern the spot where
Wharton had landed when he made his leap. He was looking fixedly
in that direction, hoping he would reappear, when a Shawanoe Indian
came into view and paused on the brink of the gorge.</p>

<p>He held his rifle in one hand and was in war paint. He seemed
to be looking at the water and the other bluff, as though measuring
the distance preparatory to leaping the chasm. This indicated
that the red man knew, or suspected, that another was near at
hand, and on the other side of the stream.</p>

<p>The leap was a good one, even for a trained warrior, and when
this one made up his mind to attempt it, he stepped back several
paces in order to gain the necessary momentum. When he paused,
only the top of his head was visible to the watchful Larry, who
knew very well what he intended to do.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe suddenly ran the short distance, and made the leap
with the ease shown by Wharton Edwards a short time before.</p>

<p>At the moment the crouching form was in mid-air, with limbs drawn
together and muscles set, the rifle dropped from his grasp, his
arms went upward with a wild cry that rose above the waters, and
his body, landing on the edge of the bluff, rolled back in the
torrent and instantly sank out of sight.</p>

<p>"I can jump the stream myself. I don't maan that such spalpeens
as ye shall have the chance of doing the same," muttered Larry,
stepping back several paces and reloading his gun with the utmost
haste.</p>

<p>None knew better than he that the occurrence would stir up matters
among the Indians on the other side, and he would have been a
zany to invite a return shot by remaining a fair view to those
who would investigate the matter offhand.</p>

<p>Had he possessed one of the modern breech-loaders and repeating
rifles, he might have secured a good position and held half a
hundred Indians at bay; but with his clumsy though excellent weapon
he could not hope to maintain his ground for any length of time.</p>

<p>The moment his gun was ready he cautiously advanced to the edge
of the stream and peered around the rocks. There was no warrior
in sight, but he was shrewd enough to allow his vision to roam
along the bluff on the other side down to the falls themselves.</p>

<p>So far as he could judge, no one was near. A dark body, however,
caught his eye in the water itself. It was going over the falls,
a limp and inert mass, which he was quick to recognize, and at
which he cast but a single glance.</p>

<p>But the youth was not left long in suspense. His keen eyes were
roving along the edge of the other bluff, which was sharply outlined
against the blue sky, when a small protuberance suddenly appeared
at the very point on which his eyes happened to rest.</p>

<p>"It's anither of 'em," was his thought, as he screened himself
so far as he could behind the ledge of rocks and brought his rifle
to a level; "when his head rises high enough I'll plug him in
the eye. Whisht now!"</p>

<p>The Indian was cunning. Instead of bringing his crown into sight,
it sank out of sight again.</p>

<p>Larry was standing with his gaze centred on the point where he
had just seen the object, his gun loaded and ready to fire the
instant a fair target was presented, when it shot up like a jack-in-the-box
a dozen feet to one side, immediately dropping out of view again.</p>

<p>The movement was so quick that the painted face had appeared
and vanished before Larry could shift his aim.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe must have known that some one was awaiting a favorable
chance to serve him as the warrior was served who attempted to
leap the gorge.</p>

<p>"It saams to me," growled the disappointed Larry, "that every
one I'm getting acquainted wid is up to some of his tricks. Why
couldn't that spalpeen have showed himself where he made me expect
him? It would be just like some of 'em to sneak across above or
below, where I can't head 'em off. I wonder what's become of Whart?"</p>
