<p>Jimmy Skunk was smiling as he ambled towards the old house of
Johnny Chuck near the foot of the hill. There was no one near
to see him, and this made him smile still more. You see, the odor
of that perfume which he had thrown at Reddy Fox just a little
while before was very, very strong there, and Jimmy knew that
until that had disappeared no one would come near the place because
it was so unpleasant for every one. To Jimmy himself it wasn't
unpleasant at all, and he couldn't understand why other people
disliked it so. He had puzzled over that a great deal. He was
glad that it was so, because on account of it every one treated
him with respect and took special pains not to quarrel with him.</p>

<p>"I guess it's a good thing that Old Mother Nature didn't make
us all alike," said he to himself. "I think there must be something
the matter with their noses, and I suppose they think there is
something the matter with mine. But there isn't. Not a thing.
Hello! There is Johnny Chuck's old house just ahead of me. Now
we will see what we shall see."</p>

<p>He walked softly as he drew near to the old house. If Peter was
way down inside, it wouldn't matter how he approached. But if
Peter should happen to be only just inside the doorway, he might
take it into his head to run if he should hear footsteps, particularly
if those footsteps were not heavy enough to be those of Reddy
or Granny Fox or Old Man Coyote. Jimmy didn't intend to give Peter
a chance to do any such thing. If Peter once got outside that
old house, his long legs would soon put him beyond Jimmy's reach,
and Jimmy knew it. If he was to give Peter the fright that he
had made up his mind to give him, he would first have to get him
where he couldn't run away. So Jimmy walked as softly as he knew
how and approached the old house in such a way as to keep out
of sight of Peter, should he happen to be lying so as to look
out of the doorway.</p>

<p>At last he reached a position where with one jump he could land
right on the doorstep. He waited a few minutes and cocked his
head on one side to listen. There wasn't a sound to tell him whether
Peter was there or not. Then lightly he jumped over to the doorstep
and looked in at the doorway. There was no Peter to be seen.</p>

<p>"If he is here, he is way down inside," thought Jimmy. "I wonder
if he really is here. I think I'll look about a bit before I go
in."</p>

<p>Now the doorstep was of sand, as Johnny Chuck's doorsteps always
are. Almost at once Jimmy chuckled. There were Peter's tracks,
and they pointed straight towards the inside of Johnny Chuck's
old house. Jimmy looked carefully, but not a single track pointing
the other way could he find. Then he chuckled again. "The scamp
is here all right," he muttered. "He hid here and watched all
that happened and then decided to lie low and wait until he was
sure that the way was clear and no one would see him." In this
Jimmy was partly right and partly wrong, as you and I know.</p>

<p>He stared down the long dark doorway a minute. Then he made up
his mind. "I'll go down and make Peter a call, and I won't bother
to knock," he chuckled, and poked his head inside the doorway.
But that was as far as Jimmy Skunk went. Yes, Sir, that was just
as far as Jimmy Skunk went. You see, no sooner did he start to
enter that old house of Johnny Chuck's than he was met by a lot
of those Yellow Jackets, and they were in a very bad temper.</p>

<p>Jimmy Skunk knows all about Yellow Jackets and the sharp little
lances they carry in their tails; he has the greatest respect
for them. He backed out in a hurry and actually hurried away to
a safe distance. Then he sat down to think. After a little he
began to chuckle again. "I know what happened," said he, talking
to himself. "Peter Rabbit popped into that doorway. Those Yellow
Jackets just naturally got after him. He didn't dare come out
for fear of Reddy Fox and me, and so he went on down to Jimmy
Chuck's old bedroom, and he's down there now, wondering how ever
he is to get out without getting stung. I reckon I don't need
to scare Peter to pay him for that joke. I reckon he's been punished
already."</p>
