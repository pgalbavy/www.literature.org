<p><u>Tuesday</u>, <u>July</u> 16.—It rained in the night, sudden and loud, in Gilbert
Island fashion.  Before the day, the crowing of a cock aroused me and I
wandered in the compound and along the street.  The squall was blown by,
the moon shone with incomparable lustre, the air lay dead as in a room,
and yet all the isle sounded as under a strong shower, the eaves thickly
pattering, the lofty palms dripping at larger intervals and with a louder
note.  In this bold nocturnal light the interior of the houses lay
inscrutable, one lump of blackness, save when the moon glinted under the
roof, and made a belt of silver, and drew the slanting shadows of the
pillars on the floor.  Nowhere in all the town was any lamp or ember; not
a creature stirred; I thought I was alone to be awake; but the police
were faithful to their duty; secretly vigilant, keeping account of time;
and a little later, the watchman struck slowly and repeatedly on the
cathedral bell; four o’clock, the warning signal.  It seemed strange
that, in a town resigned to drunkenness and tumult, curfew and réveille
should still be sounded and still obeyed.
</p>
<p>The day came, and brought little change.  The place still lay silent; the
people slept, the town slept.  Even the few who were awake, mostly women
and children, held their peace and kept within under the strong shadow of
the thatch, where you must stop and peer to see them.  Through the
deserted streets, and past the sleeping houses, a deputation took its way
at an early hour to the palace; the king was suddenly awakened, and must
listen (probably with a headache) to unpalatable truths.  Mrs. Rick,
being a sufficient mistress of that difficult tongue, was spokeswoman;
she explained to the sick monarch that I was an intimate personal friend
of Queen Victoria’s; that immediately on my return I should make her a
report upon Butaritari; and that if my house should have been again
invaded by natives, a man-of-war would be despatched to make reprisals.
It was scarce the fact—rather a just and necessary parable of the fact,
corrected for latitude; and it certainly told upon the king.  He was much
affected; he had conceived the notion (he said) that I was a man of some
importance, but not dreamed it was as bad as this; and the missionary
house was tapu’d under a fine of fifty dollars.
</p><p>So much was announced on the return of the deputation; not any more; and
I gathered subsequently that much more had passed.  The protection gained
was welcome.  It had been the most annoying and not the least alarming
feature of the day before, that our house was periodically filled with
tipsy natives, twenty or thirty at a time, begging drink, fingering our
goods, hard to be dislodged, awkward to quarrel with.  Queen Victoria’s
friend (who was soon promoted to be her son) was free from these
intrusions.  Not only my house, but my neighbourhood as well, was left in
peace; even on our walks abroad we were guarded and prepared for; and,
like great persons visiting a hospital, saw only the fair side.  For the
matter of a week we were thus suffered to go out and in and live in a
fool’s paradise, supposing the king to have kept his word, the tapu to be
revived and the island once more sober.
</p><p><u>Tuesday</u>, <u>July</u> 23.—We dined under a bare trellis erected for the
Fourth of July; and here we used to linger by lamplight over coffee and
tobacco.  In that climate evening approaches without sensible chill; the
wind dies out before sunset; heaven glows a while and fades, and darkens
into the blueness of the tropical night; swiftly and insensibly the
shadows thicken, the stars multiply their number; you look around you and
the day is gone.  It was then that we would see our Chinaman draw near
across the compound in a lurching sphere of light, divided by his
shadows; and with the coming of the lamp the night closed about the
table.  The faces of the company, the spars of the trellis, stood out
suddenly bright on a ground of blue and silver, faintly designed with
palm-tops and the peaked roofs of houses.  Here and there the gloss upon
a leaf, or the fracture of a stone, returned an isolated sparkle.  All
else had vanished.  We hung there, illuminated like a galaxy of stars <u>in
vacuo</u>; we sat, manifest and blind, amid the general ambush of the
darkness; and the islanders, passing with light footfalls and low voices
in the sand of the road, lingered to observe us, unseen.
</p><p>On Tuesday the dusk had fallen, the lamp had just been brought, when a
missile struck the table with a rattling smack and rebounded past my ear.
Three inches to one side and this page had never been written; for the
thing travelled like a cannon ball.  It was supposed at the time to be a
nut, though even at the time I thought it seemed a small one and fell
strangely.
</p><p><u>Wednesday</u>, <u>July</u> 24.—The dusk had fallen once more, and the lamp been
just brought out, when the same business was repeated.  And again the
missile whistled past my ear.  One nut I had been willing to accept; a
second, I rejected utterly.  A cocoa-nut does not come slinging along on
a windless evening, making an angle of about fifteen degrees with the
horizon; cocoa-nuts do not fall on successive nights at the same hour and
spot; in both cases, besides, a specific moment seemed to have been
chosen, that when the lamp was just carried out, a specific person
threatened, and that the head of the family.  I may have been right or
wrong, but I believed I was the mark of some intimidation; believed the
missile was a stone, aimed not to hit, but to frighten.
</p><p>No idea makes a man more angry.  I ran into the road, where the natives
were as usual promenading in the dark; Maka joined me with a lantern; and
I ran from one to another, glared in quite innocent faces, put useless
questions, and proffered idle threats.  Thence I carried my wrath (which
was worthy the son of any queen in history) to the Ricks.  They heard me
with depression, assured me this trick of throwing a stone into a family
dinner was not new; that it meant mischief, and was of a piece with the
alarming disposition of the natives.  And then the truth, so long
concealed from us, came out.  The king had broken his promise, he had
defied the deputation; the tapu was still dormant, <u>The Land we Live in</u>
still selling drink, and that quarter of the town disturbed and menaced
by perpetual broils.  But there was worse ahead: a feast was now
preparing for the birthday of the little princess; and the tributary
chiefs of Kuma and Little Makin were expected daily.  Strong in a
following of numerous and somewhat savage clansmen, each of these was
believed, like a Douglas of old, to be of doubtful loyalty.  Kuma (a
little pot-bellied fellow) never visited the palace, never entered the
town, but sat on the beach on a mat, his gun across his knees, parading
his mistrust and scorn; Karaiti of Makin, although he was more bold, was
not supposed to be more friendly; and not only were these vassals jealous
of the throne, but the followers on either side shared in the animosity.
Brawls had already taken place; blows had passed which might at any
moment be repaid in blood.  Some of the strangers were already here and
already drinking; if the debauch continued after the bulk of them had
come, a collision, perhaps a revolution, was to be expected.
</p><p>The sale of drink is in this group a measure of the jealousy of traders;
one begins, the others are constrained to follow; and to him who has the
most gin, and sells it the most recklessly, the lion’s share of copra is
assured.  It is felt by all to be an extreme expedient, neither safe,
decent, nor dignified.  A trader on Tarawa, heated by an eager rivalry,
brought many cases of gin.  He told me he sat afterwards day and night in
his house till it was finished, not daring to arrest the sale, not
venturing to go forth, the bush all round him filled with howling
drunkards.  At night, above all, when he was afraid to sleep, and heard
shots and voices about him in the darkness, his remorse was black.
</p><p>‘My God!’ he reflected, ‘if I was to lose my life on such a wretched
business!’  Often and often, in the story of the Gilberts, this scene has
been repeated; and the remorseful trader sat beside his lamp, longing for
the day, listening with agony for the sound of murder, registering
resolutions for the future.  For the business is easy to begin, but
hazardous to stop.  The natives are in their way a just and law-abiding
people, mindful of their debts, docile to the voice of their own
institutions; when the tapu is re-enforced they will cease drinking; but
the white who seeks to antedate the movement by refusing liquor does so
at his peril.
</p><p>Hence, in some degree, the anxiety and helplessness of Mr. Rick.  He and
Tom, alarmed by the rabblement of the <u>Sans Souci</u>, had stopped the sale;
they had done so without danger, because <u>The Land we Live in</u> still
continued selling; it was claimed, besides, that they had been the first
to begin.  What step could be taken?  Could Mr. Rick visit Mr. Muller
(with whom he was not on terms) and address him thus: ‘I was getting
ahead of you, now you are getting ahead of me, and I ask you to forego
your profit.  I got my place closed in safety, thanks to your continuing;
but now I think you have continued long enough.  I begin to be alarmed;
and because I am afraid I ask you to confront a certain danger’?  It was
not to be thought of.  Something else had to be found; and there was one
person at one end of the town who was at least not interested in copra.
There was little else to be said in favour of myself as an ambassador.  I
had arrived in the Wightman schooner, I was living in the Wightman
compound, I was the daily associate of the Wightman coterie.  It was
egregious enough that I should now intrude unasked in the private affairs
of Crawford’s agent, and press upon him the sacrifice of his interests
and the venture of his life.  But bad as I might be, there was none
better; since the affair of the stone I was, besides, sharp-set to be
doing, the idea of a delicate interview attracted me, and I thought it
policy to show myself abroad.
</p><p>The night was very dark.  There was service in the church, and the
building glimmered through all its crevices like a dim Kirk Allowa’.  I
saw few other lights, but was indistinctly aware of many people stirring
in the darkness, and a hum and sputter of low talk that sounded stealthy.
I believe (in the old phrase) my beard was sometimes on my shoulder as I
went.  Muller’s was but partly lighted, and quite silent, and the gate
was fastened.  I could by no means manage to undo the latch.  No wonder,
since I found it afterwards to be four or five feet long—a fortification
in itself.  As I still fumbled, a dog came on the inside and sniffed
suspiciously at my hands, so that I was reduced to calling ‘House ahoy!’
Mr. Muller came down and put his chin across the paling in the dark.
‘Who is that?’ said he, like one who has no mind to welcome strangers.
</p><p>‘My name is Stevenson,’ said I.
</p><p>‘O, Mr. Stevens!  I didn’t know you.  Come inside.’  We stepped into the
dark store, when I leaned upon the counter and he against the wall.  All
the light came from the sleeping-room, where I saw his family being put
to bed; it struck full in my face, but Mr. Muller stood in shadow.  No
doubt he expected what was Coming, and sought the advantage of position;
but for a man who wished to persuade and had nothing to conceal, mine was
the preferable.
</p><p>‘Look here,’ I began, ‘I hear you are selling to the natives.’
</p><p>‘Others have done that before me,’ he returned pointedly.
</p><p>‘No doubt,’ said I, ‘and I have nothing to do with the past, but the
future.  I want you to promise you will handle these spirits carefully.’
</p><p>‘Now what is your motive in this?’ he asked, and then, with a sneer, ‘Are
you afraid of your life?’
</p><p>‘That is nothing to the purpose,’ I replied.  ‘I know, and you know,
these spirits ought not to be used at all.’
</p><p>‘Tom and Mr. Rick have sold them before.’
</p><p>‘I have nothing to do with Tom and Mr. Rick.  All I know is I have heard
them both refuse.’
</p><p>‘No, I suppose you have nothing to do with them.  Then you are just
afraid of your life.’
</p><p>‘Come now,’ I cried, being perhaps a little stung, ‘you know in your
heart I am asking a reasonable thing.  I don’t ask you to lose your
profit—though I would prefer to see no spirits brought here, as you
would—’
</p><p>‘I don’t say I wouldn’t.  I didn’t begin this,’ he interjected.
</p><p>‘No, I don’t suppose you did,’ said I.  ‘And I don’t ask you to lose; I
ask you to give me your word, man to man, that you will make no native
drunk.’
</p><p>Up to now Mr. Muller had maintained an attitude very trying to my temper;
but he had maintained it with difficulty, his sentiment being all upon my
side; and here he changed ground for the worse.  ‘It isn’t me that
sells,’ said he.
</p><p>‘No, it’s that nigger,’ I agreed.  ‘But he’s yours to buy and sell; you
have your hand on the nape of his neck; and I ask you—I have my wife
here—to use the authority you have.’
</p><p>He hastily returned to his old ward.  ‘I don’t deny I could if I wanted,’
said he.  ‘But there’s no danger, the natives are all quiet.  You’re just
afraid of your life.’
</p><p>I do not like to be called a coward, even by implication; and here I lost
my temper and propounded an untimely ultimatum.  ‘You had better put it
plain,’ I cried.  ‘Do you mean to refuse me what I ask?’
</p><p>‘I don’t want either to refuse it or grant it,’ he replied.
</p><p>‘You’ll find you have to do the one thing or the other, and right now!’ I
cried, and then, striking into a happier vein, ‘Come,’ said I, ‘you’re a
better sort than that.  I see what’s wrong with you—you think I came from
the opposite camp.  I see the sort of man you are, and you know that what
I ask is right.’
</p><p>Again he changed ground.  ‘If the natives get any drink, it isn’t safe to
stop them,’ he objected.
</p><p>‘I’ll be answerable for the bar,’ I said.  ‘We are three men and four
revolvers; we’ll come at a word, and hold the place against the village.’
</p><p>‘You don’t know what you’re talking about; it’s too dangerous!’ he cried.
</p><p>‘Look here,’ said I, ‘I don’t mind much about losing that life you talk
so much of; but I mean to lose it the way I want to, and that is, putting
a stop to all this beastliness.’
</p><p>He talked a while about his duty to the firm; I minded not at all, I was
secure of victory.  He was but waiting to capitulate, and looked about
for any potent to relieve the strain.  In the gush of light from the
bedroom door I spied a cigar-holder on the desk.  ‘That is well
coloured,’ said I.
</p><p>‘Will you take a cigar?’ said he.
</p><p>I took it and held it up unlighted.  ‘Now,’ said I, ‘you promise me.’
</p><p>‘I promise you you won’t have any trouble from natives that have drunk at
my place,’ he replied.
</p><p>‘That is all I ask,’ said I, and showed it was not by immediately
offering to try his stock.
</p><p>So far as it was anyway critical our interview here ended.  Mr. Muller
had thenceforth ceased to regard me as an emissary from his rivals,
dropped his defensive attitude, and spoke as he believed.  I could make
out that he would already, had he dared, have stopped the sale himself.
Not quite daring, it may be imagined how he resented the idea of
interference from those who had (by his own statement) first led him on,
then deserted him in the breach, and now (sitting themselves in safety)
egged him on to a new peril, which was all gain to them, all loss to him!
I asked him what he thought of the danger from the feast.
</p><p>‘I think worse of it than any of you,’ he answered.  ‘They were shooting
around here last night, and I heard the balls too.  I said to myself,
“That’s bad.”  What gets me is why you should be making this row up at
your end.  I should be the first to go.’
</p><p>It was a thoughtless wonder.  The consolation of being second is not
great; the fact, not the order of going—there was our concern.
</p><p>Scott talks moderately of looking forward to a time of fighting ‘with a
feeling that resembled pleasure.’  The resemblance seems rather an
identity.  In modern life, contact is ended; man grows impatient of
endless manœuvres; and to approach the fact, to find ourselves where we
can push an advantage home, and stand a fair risk, and see at last what
we are made of, stirs the blood.  It was so at least with all my family,
who bubbled with delight at the approach of trouble; and we sat deep into
the night like a pack of schoolboys, preparing the revolvers and
arranging plans against the morrow.  It promised certainly to be a busy
and eventful day.  The Old Men were to be summoned to confront me on the
question of the tapu; Muller might call us at any moment to garrison his
bar; and suppose Muller to fail, we decided in a family council to take
that matter into our own hands, <u>The Land we Live in</u> at the pistol’s
mouth, and with the polysyllabic Williams, dance to a new tune.  As I
recall our humour I think it would have gone hard with the mulatto.
</p><p><u>Wednesday</u>, <u>July</u> 24.—It was as well, and yet it was disappointing that
these thunder-clouds rolled off in silence.  Whether the Old Men recoiled
from an interview with Queen Victoria’s son, whether Muller had secretly
intervened, or whether the step flowed naturally from the fears of the
king and the nearness of the feast, the tapu was early that morning
re-enforced; not a day too soon, from the manner the boats began to
arrive thickly, and the town was filled with the big rowdy vassals of
Karaiti.
</p><p>The effect lingered for some time on the minds of the traders; it was
with the approval of all present that I helped to draw up a petition to
the United States, praying for a law against the liquor trade in the
Gilberts; and it was at this request that I added, under my own name, a
brief testimony of what had passed;—useless pains; since the whole
reposes, probably unread and possibly unopened, in a pigeon-hole at
Washington.
</p><p><u>Sunday</u>, <u>July</u> 28.—This day we had the afterpiece of the debauch.  The
king and queen, in European clothes, and followed by armed guards,
attended church for the first time, and sat perched aloft in a precarious
dignity under the barrel-hoops.  Before sermon his majesty clambered from
the dais, stood lopsidedly upon the gravel floor, and in a few words
abjured drinking.  The queen followed suit with a yet briefer allocution.
All the men in church were next addressed in turn; each held up his right
hand, and the affair was over—throne and church were reconciled.
