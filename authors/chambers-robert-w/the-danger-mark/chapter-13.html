<p>Rosalie had departed; Grandcourt followed suit next day; Sylvia's
brother, Stuyvesant, had at last found a sober moment at his disposal
and had appeared at Roya-Neh and taken his sister away. Duane
was all ready to go to New York to find out whether his father
was worrying over anything, as the tone of his letters indicated.</p>

<p>The day he left, Kathleen and Geraldine started on a round of
August house parties, ranging from Lenox to Long Island, including
tiresome week ends and duty visits to some very unpretentious
but highly intellectual relatives of Mrs. Severn. So Scott remained
in solitary possession of Roya-Neh, with its forests, gardens,
pastures, lakes and streams, and a staggering payroll and all
the multiplicity of problems that such responsibility entails.
Which pleased him immensely, except for the departure of Kathleen.</p>

<p>To play the intellectual country squire had been all he desired
on earth except Kathleen. From the beginning White's "Selborne"
had remained his model for all books, Kathleen for all women.
He was satisfied with these two components of perfect happiness,
and with himself, as he was, for the third ingredient in a contented
and symmetrical existence.</p>

<p>He had accepted his answer from her with more philosophy than
she quite expected or was prepared for, saying that if she made
a particular point of it he would go about next winter and give
himself a chance to meet as many desirable young girls as she
thought best; that it was merely wasting time, but if it made
her any happier, he'd wait and endeavour to return to their relations
of unsentimental comradeship until she was satisfied he knew his
mind.</p>

<p>Kathleen was, at first, a little dismayed at his complacency.
It was only certainty of himself. At twenty-two there is time
for anything, and the vista of life ahead is endless. And there
was one thing more which Kathleen did not know. Under the covering
of this Seagrave complacency and self-centred sufficiency, all
alone by itself was developing the sprouting germ of consideration
for others.</p>

<p>How it started he himself did not know&mdash;nor was he even aware
that it had started. But long, solitary rambles and the quiet
contemplation of other things besides himself had awakened first
curiosity, then a dawning suspicion of the rights of others.</p>

<p>In the silence of forests it is difficult to preserve complacency;
under the stars modesty is born.</p>

<p>It began to occur to him, by degrees, that his own personal importance
among his kind <em>might</em> be due, in part, to his fortune.
And from the first invasion of that shocking idea matters progressed
rather rapidly with the last of the Seagraves.</p>

<p>He said uneasily to Duane, once: "Are you going in seriously
for painting?"</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> in," observed Duane drily.</p>

<p>"Professionally?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing. God hates an amateur."</p>

<p>"What are you after?" persisted Scott. "Fame?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I need it in my business."</p>

<p>"Are you contemplating a velvet coat and bow tie, and a bunch
of the elect at your heels?&mdash;ratty men, and pop-eyed young women
whose coiffure needs weeding?"</p>

<p>Duane laughed. "Are they any more deadly than our own sort? Why
endure either? Because you are developing into a country squire,
you don't have to marry Maud Muller." And he quoted Bret Harte:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"For there be women fair as she,<br/>
Whose verbs and nouns do more agree."

</p>
</div>
<p>"You don't have to wallow in a profession, you know."</p>

<p>"But why the mischief do you want to paint professionally?" inquired
Scott, with unsatisfied curiosity. "It isn't avarice, is it?"</p>

<p>"I expect to hold out for what my pictures are worth, if that's
what you mean by avarice. What I'm trying to do," added Duane,
striking his palm with his fist as emphasis, "is not to die the
son of a wealthy man. If I can't be anything more, I'm not worth
a damn. But I'm going to be. I can do it, Scott; I'm lazy, I'm
undecided, I've a weak streak. And yet, do you know, with all
my blemishes, all my misgivings, all my discouragements, panics,
despondent moments, I am, way down inside, serenely and unaccountably
certain that I can paint like the devil, and that I am going to
do it. That sounds cheeky, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"It sounds all right to me," said Scott. And he walked away thoughtfully,
fists dug deep in his pockets.</p>

<p>And one still, sunny afternoon, standing alone on the dry granite
crags of the Golden Dome, he looked up and saw, a quarter of a
million miles above him, the moon's ghost swimming in azure splendour.
Then he looked down and saw the map of the earth below him, where
his forests spread out like moss, and his lakes mirrored the clouds,
and a river belonging to him traced its course across the valley
in a single silver thread. And a slight blush stung his face at
the thought that, without any merit or endeavour of his own, his
money had bought it all&mdash;his money, that had always acted as his
deputy, fought for him, conquered for him, spoken for him, vouched
for him&mdash;perhaps pleaded for him!&mdash;he shivered, and suddenly he
realised that this golden voice was, in fact, all there was to
him.</p>

<p>What had he to identify him on earth among mankind? Only his
money. Wherein did he differ from other men? He had more money.
What had he to offer as excuse for living at all? Money. What
had he done? Lived on it, by it. Why, then, it was the money that
was entitled to distinction, and he figured only as its parasite!
Then he was nothing&mdash;even a little less. In the world there was
man and there was money. It seemed that he was a little lower
in the scale than either; a parasite&mdash;scarcely a thing of distinction
to offer Kathleen Severn.</p>

<p>Very seriously he looked up at the moon.</p>

<p>It was the day following his somewhat disordered and impassioned
declaration. He expected to receive his answer that evening; and
he descended the mountain in a curiously uncertain and perplexed
state of mind which at times bordered on a modesty painfully akin
to humbleness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Duane was preparing to depart on the morrow. And that
evening he also was to have his definite answer to the letter
which Kathleen had taken to Geraldine Seagrave that morning.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Dear," he had written, "I once told you that my weakness needed<br/>
the aid of all that is best in you; that yours required the best of<br/>
courage and devotion that lies in me. It is surely so. Together we<br/>
conquer the world&mdash;which is ourselves.

</p>
<p>
"For the little things that seem to threaten our separation do not<br/>
really alarm me. Even if I actually committed the inconsequential<br/>
and casual thing that so abruptly and so deeply offended you, there<br/>
remains enough soundness in me at the core to warrant your charity<br/>
and repay, in a measure, your forgiveness and a renewal of your<br/>
interest in my behalf.

</p>
<p>
"Search your heart, Geraldine; question your intelligence; both will<br/>
tell you that I am enough of a man to dare love you. And it takes<br/>
something of a man to dare do it.

</p>
<p>
"There is a thing that I might say which would convince you, even<br/>
against the testimony of your own eyes, that never in deed or in<br/>
thought have I been really disloyal to you since you gave me your<br/>
heart.... Yet I must not say it.... Can you summon sufficient faith<br/>
in me to accept that statement&mdash;against the evidence of those two<br/>
divine witnesses which condemn me&mdash;your eyes? Circumstantial<br/>
evidence is no good in this case, dear. I can say no more than that.

</p>
<p>
"Dearest, what can compare to the disaster of losing each other?

</p>
<p>
"I ask you to let me have the right to stand by you in your present<br/>
distress and despondency. What am I for if not for such moments?

</p>
<p>
"That night you were closer to the danger mark than you have ever<br/>
been. I know that my conduct&mdash;at least your interpretation of<br/>
it&mdash;threw you, for the moment off your guarded balance; but that<br/>
your attitude toward such a crisis&mdash;your solution of such a<br/>
situation&mdash;should be a leap forward toward self-destruction&mdash;a<br/>
reckless surrender to anger and blind impulse, only makes me the<br/>
more certain that we need each other now if ever.

</p>
<p>
"The silent, lonely, forlorn battle that has been going on behind<br/>
the door of your room and the doors of your heart during these last<br/>
few days, is more than I can well endure. Open both doors to me;<br/>
leagued we can win through!

</p>
<p>
"Give me the right to be with you by night as well as by daylight,<br/>
and we two shall stand together and see 'the day break and the<br/>
shadows flee away.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>That same evening his reply came:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"My darling, Kathleen will give you this. I don't care what my eyes<br/>
saw if you tell me it isn't true. I have loved you, anyway, all the<br/>
while&mdash;even with my throat full of tears and my mouth bitter with<br/>
anger, and my heart torn into several thousand tatters&mdash;oh, it is<br/>
not very difficult to love you, Duane; the only trouble is to love<br/>
you in the right way; which is hard, dear, because I want you so<br/>
much; and it's so new to me to be unselfish. I began to learn by<br/>
loving you.

</p>
<p>
"Which means, that I will not let you take the risk you ask for.<br/>
Give me time; I've fought it off since that miserable night. Heaven<br/>
alone knows why I surrendered&mdash;turning to my deadly enemy for<br/>
countenance and comfort to support my childish and contemptible<br/>
anger against you.

</p>
<p>
"Duane, there is an evil streak in me, and we both must reckon with<br/>
it. Long, long before I knew I loved you, things you said and did<br/>
often wounded me; and within me a perfectly unreasoning desire to<br/>
hurt you&mdash;to make you suffer&mdash;always flamed up and raged.

</p>
<p>
"I think that was partly what made me do what you know I did that<br/>
night. It would hurt you; that was my ignoble instinct. God knows<br/>
whether it was also a hideous sort of excuse for my weakness&mdash;for I<br/>
was blazing hot after the last dance&mdash;and the gaiety and uproar and<br/>
laughter all overexcited me&mdash;and then what I had seen you do, and<br/>
your not coming to me, and that ominous uneasy impulse stirring!

</p>
<p>
"That is the truth as I analyse it. The dreadful thing is that I<br/>
could have been capable of dealing our chance of happiness such a<br/>
cowardly blow.

</p>
<p>
"Well, it is over. The thing has fled for a while. I fought it down,<br/>
stamped on it with utter horror and loathing. It&mdash;the<br/>
encounter&mdash;tired me. I am weary yet&mdash;from honourable wounds. But I<br/>
won out. If it comes back again&mdash;Oh, Duane! and it surely will<br/>
&mdash;I<br/>
shall face it undaunted once more; and every hydra-head that stirs I<br/>
shall kill until the thing lies dead between us for all time.

</p>
<p>
"Then, dear, will you take the girl who has done this thing?

</p>
<p>
"<em>GERALDINE SEAGRAVE</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>This was his answer on the eve of his departure.</p>

<p>And on the morning of it Geraldine came down to say good-bye;
a fresh, sweet, and bewildering Geraldine, somewhat slimmer than
when he had last seen her, a little finer in feature, more delicate
of body; and there was about her even a hint of the spirituel
as a fascinating trace of what she had been through, locked in
alone behind the doors of her room and heart.</p>

<p>She bade him good-morning somewhat shyly, offering her slim hand
and looking at him with the slight uncertainty and bent brows
of a person coming suddenly into a strong light.</p>

<p>He said under his breath: "You poor darling, how thin you are."</p>

<p>"Athletics," she said; "Jacob wrestled with an angel, but you
know what I've been facing in the squared circle. Don't speak
of it any more, will you? ... How sunburned you are! What have
you been about since I've kept to my room?"</p>

<p>"I've painted Miller's kids in the open; I suppose the terrific
influence of Sorolla has me in bondage for the moment." He laughed
easily: "But don't worry; it will leave nothing except clean inspiration
behind it. I'll think out my own way&mdash;grope it out through Pantheon
and living maze. All I've really got to say in paint can be said
only in my own way. I know that, even when realising that I've
been sunstruck by Sorolla."</p>

<p>She listened demurely, watching him, her lips sensitive with
understanding; and she laughed when he laughed away his fealty
to the superb Spaniard, knowing himself and the untried strength
within him.</p>

<p>"But when are you coming back to us, Duane?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Father's letters perplex me. I'll write you every
day, of course."</p>

<p>A quick colour tinted her skin:</p>

<p>"And I will write you every day. I will begin to-day. Kathleen
and I expect to be here in September. But you will come back before
that and keep Scott company; won't you?"</p>

<p>"I want to get into harness again," he said slowly. "I want to
settle down to work."</p>

<p>"Can't you work here?"</p>

<p>"Not very well."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"To tell the truth," he admitted, smiling, "I require something
more like a working studio than Miller's garret."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought," she said shyly, "and Scott and I have
the plans for a studio all ready; and the men are to begin Monday,
and Miller is to take the new gate cottage. Oh, the plans are
really very wonderful!" she added hastily, as Duane looked grateful
but dubious. "Rollins and Calvert drew them. I wrote to Billy
Calvert and sent him the original plans for Hurryon Lodge. Duane,
I thought it would please you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It does, you dear, generous girl! I'm a trifle overwhelmed,
that's all my silence meant. You ought not to do this for me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Why? Aren't we to be as near each other as we can be until &mdash;I
am ready&mdash;for something&mdash;closer?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Certainly.... I'll arrange to work out certain things
up here. As for models, if there is nothing suitable at Westgate
village, you won't mind my importing some, will you?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, becoming very serious and gravely interested,
as befitted the fiancée of a painter of consequence. "You will
do what is necessary, of course; because <em>I&mdash;</em>few girls&mdash;are
accustomed in the beginning to the details of such a profession
as yours; and I'm very ignorant, Duane, and I must learn how to
second you&mdash;intelligently"&mdash;she blushed&mdash;"that is, if I'm to amount
to anything as an artist's wife."</p>

<p>"You dear!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"No; I tell you I am totally ignorant. A studio is an awesome
place to me. I merely know enough to keep out of it when you are
using models. That is safest, isn't it?"</p>

<p>He said, intensely amused: "It might be safer not to give pink
teas while I am working from the nude."</p>

<p>"Duane! Do you think me a perfect ninny? Anyway, you're not <em>always</em>
painting Venus and Ariadne and horrid Ledas, are you?"</p>

<p>"Not always!" he managed to assure her; and her pretty, confused
laughter mingled with his unembarrassed mirth as the motor-car
swung up to carry him and his traps to the station.</p>

<p>They said good-bye; her dark eyes became very tragic; her lips
threatened to escape control.</p>

<p>Kathleen turned away, manoeuvring Scott out of earshot, who knowing
nothing of any situation between Duane and his sister, protested
mildly, but forgot when Kathleen led him to an orange-underwing
moth asleep on the stone coping of the terrace.</p>

<p>And when the unfortunate Catocala had been safely bottled and
they stood examining it in the library, Scott's rapidly diminishing
conceit found utterance:</p>

<p>"I say, Kathleen, it's all very well for me to collect these
fascinating things, but any ass can do that. One can't make a
particular name for one's self by doing what a lot of cleverer
men have already done, and what a lot of idle idiots are imitating."</p>

<p>She raised her violet eyes, astonished:</p>

<p>"Do <em>you</em> want to make a name for yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, reddening.</p>

<p>"Why not? I'm a nobody. I'm worse; I'm an amateur! You ought
to hear what Duane has to say about amateurs!"</p>

<p>"But, Scott, you don't have to be anything in particular except
what you are&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What am I?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yourself."</p>

<p>"And what's that?" He grew redder. "I'll tell you, Kathleen.
I'm merely a painfully wealthy young man. Don't laugh; this is
becoming deadly serious to me. By my own exertions I've never
done one bally thing either useful or spectacular. I'm not distinguished
by anything except an unfair share of wealth. I'm not eminent,
let alone pre-eminent, even in that sordid class; there are richer
men, plenty of them&mdash;some even who have made their own fortunes
and have not been hatched out in a suffocating plethora of affluence
like the larva of the Carnifex tumble-bug&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Scott!"</p>

<p>"And I!" he ended savagely. "Why, I'm not even pre-eminent as
far as my position in the social puddle is concerned; there are
sets that wouldn't endure me; there's at least one club into which
I couldn't possibly wriggle; there are drawing-rooms where I wouldn't
be tolerated, because I've nothing on earth to recommend me or
to distinguish me from Algernon FitzNoodle and Montmorency de
Sansgallette except an inflated income! What have I to offer anybody
worth while for entertaining me? What have I to offer you, Kathleen,
in exchange for yourself?"</p>

<p>He was becoming boyishly dramatic with sweeping gestures which
amazed her; but she was conscious that it was all sincere and
very real to him.</p>

<p>"Scott, dear," she began sweetly, uncertain how to take it all;
"kindness, loyalty, and decent breeding are all that a woman cares
for in a man&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You are entitled to more; you are entitled to a man of distinction,
of attainment, of achievement&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Few women ask for that, Scott; few care for it; fewer still
understand it&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You would. I've got a cheek to ask you to marry me&mdash;<em>me!</em>&mdash;before
I wear any tag to identify me except the dollar mark&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, Scott! You are talking utter nonsense; don't you know
it?"</p>

<p>He made a large and rather grandiose gesture:</p>

<p>"Around me lies opportunity, Kathleen&mdash;every stone; every brook&#11834;"</p>

<p>The mischievous laughter of his listener checked him. She said:
"I'm sorry; only it made me think of</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'Sermons in stones,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Books in the running brooks,'

</p>
</div>
<p>and the indignant gentleman who said: 'What damn nonsense! It's
"sermons in <em>books</em>, <em>stones</em> in the running brooks!"'
Do go on, Scott, dear, I don't mean to be frivolous; it is fine
of you to wish for fame&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It isn't fame alone, although I wouldn't mind it if I deserved
it. It's that I want to do just one thing that amounts to something.
I wish you'd give me an idea, Kathleen, something useful in&mdash;say
in entomology."</p>

<p>Together they walked back to the terrace. Duane had gone; Geraldine
sat sideways on the parapet, her brown eyes fixed on the road
along which her lover had departed.</p>

<p>"Geraldine," said Kathleen, who very seldom relapsed into the
vernacular, "this brother of yours desires to perform some startling
stunt in entomology and be awarded Carnegie medals."</p>

<p>"That's about it," said Scott, undaunted. "Some wise guy put
it all over the Boll-weevil, and saved a few billions for the
cotton growers; another gentleman full of scientific thinks studied
out the San José scale; others have got in good licks at mosquitoes
and house-flies. I'd like to tackle something of that sort."</p>

<p>"Rose-beetles," said his sister briefly. In her voice was a suspicion
of tears, and she kept her head turned from them.</p>

<p>"Nobody could ever get rid of Rose-beetles," said Kathleen. "But
it <em>would</em> be exciting, wouldn't it, Scott? Think of saving
our roses and peonies and irises every year!"</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> thinking of it," said Scott gravely.</p>

<p>A few moments later he disappeared around the corner of the house,
returning presently, pockets bulging with bottles and boxes, a
field-microscope in one hand, and several volumes on Coleoptera
in the other.</p>

<p>"They're gone," he said without further explanation.</p>

<p>"Who are gone?" inquired Kathleen.</p>

<p>"The Rose-beetles. They deposit their eggs in the soil. The larvæ
ought to be out by now. I'm going to begin this very minute, Kathleen."
And he descended the terrace steps, entered the garden, and, seating
himself under a rose-tree, spread out his paraphernalia and began
a delicate and cautious burrowing process in the sun-dried soil.</p>

<p>"Fame is hidden under humble things," observed Geraldine with
a resolute effort at lightness. "That excellent brother of mine
may yet discover it in the garden dirt."</p>

<p>"Dirt breeds roses," said Kathleen. "Oh, look, dear, how earnest
he is about it. What a boy he is, after all! So serious and intent,
and so touchingly confident!"</p>

<p>Geraldine nodded listlessly, considering her brother's evolutions
with his trowel and weeder where he lay flat on his stomach, absorbed
in his investigations.</p>

<p>"Why does he get so grubby?" she said. "All his coat-pockets
are permanently out of shape. The other day I was looking through
them, at his request, to find one of my own handkerchiefs which
he had taken, and oh, horrors! a caterpillar, forgotten, had spun
a big cocoon in one of them!"</p>

<p>She shuddered, but in Kathleen's laughter there was a tremor
of tenderness born of that shy pride which arises from possession.
For it was now too late, if it had not always been too late, for
any criticism of this boy of hers. Perfect he had always been,
wondrous to her, as a child, for the glimpses of the man developing
in him; perfect, wonderful, adorable now for the glimpses of the
child which she caught so constantly through the man's character
now forming day by day under her loyal eyes. Everything masculine
in him she loved or pardoned proudly&mdash;even his egotism, his slapdash
self-confidence, his bullying of her, his domination, his exacting
demands. But this new humility&mdash;this sudden humble doubt that
he might not be worthy of her, filled her heart with delicious
laughter and a delight almost childish.</p>

<p>So she watched him from the parapet, chin cupped in both palms,
bright hair blowing, one shoulder almost hidden under the drooping
scarlet nasturtiums pendant from the carved stone urn above; a
fair, sweet, youthful creature, young as her guiltless heart,
sweet as her conscience, fair as the current of her stainless
life.</p>

<p>And beside her, seated sideways, brown eyes brooding, sat a young
girl, delicately lovely, already harassed, already perplexed,
already bruised and wearied by her first skirmishes with life;
not yet fully understanding what threatened, what lay before&mdash;alas!
what lay behind her&mdash;even to the fifth generation.</p>

<p>They were to motor to Lenox after luncheon. Before that&mdash;and
leaving Scott absorbed in his grubbing, and Kathleen absorbed
in watching him &mdash;Geraldine wandered back into the library
and took down a book&mdash;a book which had both beguiled and horrified
the solitude of her self-imprisonment. It was called "Simpson
on Heredity."</p>

<p>There were some very hideous illustrated pages in that book;
she turned to them with a fearful fascination which had never
left her since she first read them. They dealt with the transmission
of certain tendencies through successive generations.</p>

<p>That the volume was an old one and amusingly out of date she
did not realise, as her brown eyes widened over terrifying paragraphs
and the soft tendrils of her glossy hair almost bristled.</p>

<p>She had asked Kathleen about it, and Kathleen had asked Dr. Bailey,
who became very irritated and told Geraldine that anybody except
a physician who ever read medical works was a fool. Desperation
gave her courage to ask him one more question; his well-meant
reply silenced her. But she had the book under her pillow. It
is better to answer such questions when the young ask them.</p>

<p>And over it all she pondered and pored, and used a dictionary
and shuddered, frightening herself into a morbid condition until,
desperately scared, she even thought of going to Duane about it;
but could not find the hardihood to do it or the vocabulary necessary.</p>

<p>Now Duane was gone; and the book lay there between her knees,
all its technical vagueness menacing her with unknown terrors;
and she felt that she could endure it alone no longer.</p>

<p>She wrote him:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"You have not been gone an hour, and already I need you. I wish to<br/>
ask you about something that is troubling me; I've asked Kathleen<br/>
and she doesn't know; and Dr. Bailey was horrid to me, and I tried<br/>
to find out from Scott whether he knew, but he wasn't much<br/>
interested. So, Duane, who else is there for me to ask except you?<br/>
And I don't exactly know whether I may speak about such matters to<br/>
you, but I'm rather frightened, and densely ignorant.

</p>
<p>
"It is this, dear; in a medical book which I read, it says that<br/>
hereditary taints are transmissible; that sometimes they may skip<br/>
the second generation but only to appear surely in the third. But it<br/>
also says that the taint is very likely to appear in <em>every</em><br/>
generation.

</p>
<p>
"Duane, is this <em>true</em>? It has worried me sick since I read it.<br/>
Because, my darling, if it is so, is it not another reason for our<br/>
not marrying?

</p>
<p>
"Do you understand? I can and will eradicate what is threatening<br/>
<em>me</em>, but if I marry you&mdash;you <em>do</em> understand, don't you? Isn't it<br/>
all right for me to ask you whether, if we should have children,<br/>
this thing would menace them? Oh, Duane<br/>
&mdash;Duane! Have I any right to<br/>
marry? Children come<br/>
&mdash;God knows how, for nobody ever told me<br/>
exactly, and I'm a fool about such things&mdash;but I summoned up courage<br/>
to ask Dr. Bailey if there was any way to tell before I married<br/>
whether I would have any, and he said I would if I had any notion of<br/>
my duty and any pretence to self-respect. And I don't know what he<br/>
means and I'm bewildered and miserable and afraid to marry you even<br/>
when I myself become perfectly well. And that is what worries me,<br/>
Duane, and I have nobody in the world to ask about it except you.<br/>
Could you please tell me how I might learn what I ought to know<br/>
concerning these things without betraying my own vital interest in<br/>
them to whomever I ask? You see, Kathleen is as innocent as I.

</p>
<p>
"Please tell me all you can, Duane, for I am most unhappy."

</p>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
<p>
"The house is very still and full of sunlight and cut flowers. Scott<br/>
is meditating great deeds, lying flat in the dirt. Kathleen sits<br/>
watching him from the parapet. And I am here in the library, with<br/>
that ghastly book at my elbow, pouring out all my doubts and fears<br/>
to the only man in the world&mdash;whom God bless and protect wherever he<br/>
may be<br/>
&mdash;Oh, Duane, Duane, how I love you!"

</p>

<p>She hurriedly directed and sealed the letter and placed it in
the box for outgoing mail; then, unquiet and apprehensive regarding
what she had ventured to write, she began a restless tour of the
house, upstairs and down, wandering aimlessly through sunny corridors,
opening doors for a brief survey of chambers in which only the
shadow-patterns of leaves moved on sunlit walls; still rooms tenanted
only by the carefully dusted furniture which seemed to stand there
watching attentively for another guest.</p>

<p>Duane had left his pipe in his bedroom. She was silly over it,
even to the point of retiring into her room, shredding some cigarettes,
filling the rather rank bowl, and trying her best to smoke it.
But such devotion was beyond her physical powers; she rinsed her
mouth, furious at being defeated in her pious intentions, and,
making an attractive parcel of the pipe, seized the occasion to
write him another letter.</p>

"There is in my heart," she wrote, "no room for anything except<br/>
you; no desire except for you; no hope, no interest that is not<br/>
yours. You praise my beauty; you endow me with what you might wish I<br/>
really possessed; and oh, I really am so humble at your feet, if you<br/>
only knew it! So dazed by your goodness to me, so grateful, so happy<br/>
that you have chosen me (I just jumped up to look at myself in the<br/>
mirror; I <em>am</em> pretty, Duane, I've a stunning colour just now and<br/>
there <em>is</em> a certain charm about me&mdash;even I can see it in what you<br/>
call the upcurled corners of my mouth, and in my figure and<br/>
hands)&mdash;and I am so happy that it is true&mdash;that you find me<br/>
beautiful, that you care for my beauty.... It is so with a man, I<br/>
believe; and a girl wishes to have him love her beauty, too.

</p>
<p>
"But, Duane, I don't think the average girl cares very much about<br/>
that in a man. Of course you are exceedingly nice to look at, and I<br/>
notice it sometimes, but not nearly as often as you notice what you<br/>
think is externally attractive about me.

</p>
<p>
"In my heart, I don't believe it really matters much to a girl what<br/>
a man looks like; anyway, it matters very little after she once<br/>
knows him.

</p>
<p>
"Of course women do notice handsome men&mdash;or what we consider<br/>
handsome&mdash;which is, I believe, not at all what men care for; because<br/>
men usually seem to have a desire to kick the man whom women find<br/>
good-looking. I know several men who feel that way about Jack<br/>
Dysart. I think you do, for one.

</p>
<p>
"Poor Jack Dysart! To-day's papers are saying such horridly<br/>
unpleasant things about the rich men with whom he was rather closely<br/>
associated in business affairs several years ago. I read, but I do<br/>
not entirely comprehend.

</p>
<p>
"The New York papers seem unusually gloomy this summer; nothing but<br/>
predictions of hard times coming, and how many corporations the<br/>
attorney-general is going to proceed against, and wicked people who<br/>
loot metropolitan railways, and why the district-attorney doesn't do<br/>
his duty&mdash;which you say he does&mdash;oh, dear; I expect that Scott and<br/>
Kathleen and I will have to take in boarders this winter; but if<br/>
nobody has any money, nobody can pay board, so everybody will be<br/>
ruined and I don't very much care, for I could teach school, only<br/>
who is to pay my salary if there's no money to pay it with? Oh,<br/>
dear! what nonsense I am writing&mdash;only to keep on writing, because<br/>
it seems to bring you a little nearer&mdash;my own&mdash;my Duane&mdash;my<br/>
comrade&mdash;the same, same little boy who ran away from his nurse and<br/>
came into our garden to fight my brother and&mdash;fall in love with his<br/>
sister! Oh, Fate! Oh, Destiny! Oh, Duane Mallett!

</p>
<p>
"Here is a curious phenomenon. Listen:

</p>
<p>
"Away from you I have a woman's courage to tell you how I long for<br/>
you, how my heart and my arms ache for you. But when I am with you<br/>
I'm less of a woman and more of a girl&mdash;a girl not yet accustomed to<br/>
some things&mdash;always guarded, always a little reticent, always<br/>
instinctively recoiling from the contact I really like, always a<br/>
little on the defensive against your lips, in spite of<br/>
myself&mdash;against your arms&mdash;where, somehow, I cannot seem to stay<br/>
long at a time&mdash;will not endure it&mdash;<em>cannot</em>, somehow.

</p>
<p>
"Yet, here, away from you, I so long for your embrace, and cannot<br/>
imagine it too long, too close, too tender to satisfy my need of<br/>
you.

</p>
<p>
"And this is my second letter to you within the hour&mdash;one hour after<br/>
your departure.

</p>
<p>
"Oh, Duane, I do truly miss you so! I go about humming that air you<br/>
found so quaint:

</p>
<p>
"'Lisetto quittée la plaine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moi perdi bonheur à moi,<br/>
Yeux à moi semblent fontaine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depuis moi pas miré toi,'

</p>
<p>
and there's a tear in every note of it, and I'm the most lonely<br/>
girl on the face of the earth to-day.

</p>
