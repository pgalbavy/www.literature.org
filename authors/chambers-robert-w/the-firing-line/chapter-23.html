<p>As Hamil left the garden Malcourt sauntered into view, halted,
then came forward.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you," he said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>Neither offered to shake hands; Malcourt, lightly formal, spoke
of Hamil's illness in a few words, using that excellent taste
which was at his command when he chose to employ it. He expressed
his pleasure in Hamil's recovery, and said that he was ready at
any time to take up the unfinished details of Portlaw's business,
agreeing with Hamil that there remained very little to talk over.</p>

<p>"The main thing, of course, is to squelch William's last hopes
of any Rhine castles," continued Malcourt, laughing. "If you feel
like it to-day I'll bring over the plans as you sketched them."</p>

<p>"In a day or two," nodded Hamil.</p>

<p>"Or perhaps you will lunch with m&mdash;with us, and you and I can
go over the things comfortably."</p>

<p>But he saw by the scarcely perceptible change in Hamil's face
that there were to be no such relations between them, informal
or otherwise; and he went on quietly, closing his own suggestion:</p>

<p>"Or, if you like, we'll get Portlaw some morning after his breakfast,
and end the whole matter by laying down the law to him."</p>

<p>"That would be perfectly agreeable to me," said Hamil. He spoke
as though fatigued, and he looked it as he moved toward his house,
using his walking-stick. Malcourt accompanied him to the road.</p>

<p>"Hamil," he said coolly, "may I suggest something?"</p>

<p>The other turned an expressionless face toward him: "What do
you wish to suggest?"</p>

<p>"That, some day when you feel physically better, I'd like to
go over one or two matters with you&mdash;privately&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What matters?"</p>

<p>"They concern you and myself."</p>

<p>"I know of no private matters which concern you and myself&mdash;or
are ever likely to."</p>

<p>Malcourt's face darkened. "I think I warned you once that one
day you would misunderstand my friendship for you."</p>

<p>Hamil straightened up, looking him coldly in the eye.</p>

<p>"Malcourt," he said, "there is no reason for the slightest pretence
between us. I don't like you; I don't dislike you; I simply don't
take you into consideration at all. The accident of your intrusion
into a woman's life is not going to make any more difference to
me than it has already made, nor can it affect my complete liberty
and freedom to do and say what I choose."</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I understand you, Hamil."</p>

<p>"Well, you can certainly understand this: that my regard for
&mdash;Mrs. Malcourt&mdash;does not extend to you; that it is neither
modified nor hampered by the fact that you happen to exist, or
that she now bears your name."</p>

<p>Malcourt's face had lost its colour. He began slowly:</p>

<p>"There is no reason, I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care what you think!" said Hamil. "It is not of any
consequence to me, nor will it govern me in any manner." He made
a contemptuous gesture toward the garden. "Those flower-beds and
gravel walks in there &mdash;I don't know whether they belong
to you or to Mrs. Malcourt or to Portlaw; and I don't care. The
accidental ownership of property will not prevent my entering
it; but its ownership by you would prevent my accepting your personal
invitation to use it or even enter it. And now, perhaps, you understand."</p>

<p>Malcourt, very white, nodded:</p>

<p>"It is so useless," he said&mdash;"all this bitterness. You don't
know what you're saying.... But I suppose you can't help it....
It always has been that way; things go to smash if I try to do
anything.... Well, Hamil, we'll go on in your own fashion, if
we must&mdash;for a while. But"&mdash;and he laughed mirthlessly&mdash;"if it
ends in a little shooting&mdash;you mustn't blame me!"</p>

<p>Hamil surveyed him in cold displeasure.</p>

<p>"I always expected you'd find your level," he observed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll find it," mused Malcourt, "as soon as I know what
it ought to be. Under pressure it is difficult to ascertain such
things; one's true level may be higher or lower. My father and
I have often discussed this matter&mdash;and the ethics of straight
shooting."</p>

<p>Hamil's eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"If you mean that as a threat"&mdash;he began contemptuously; but
Malcourt, who had suddenly assumed that curious listening attitude,
raised his hand impatiently, as though silencing interruption.</p>

<p>And long after Hamil had turned on his heel and gone, he stood
there, graceful head lowered a little and partly turned as though
poetically appreciative of the soft twittering music which the
bluebirds were making among the falling apple-bloom.</p>

<p>Then, slowly, not noticing Hamil's departure, he retraced his
steps through the garden, head slightly inclined, as though to
catch the murmur of some invisible companion accompanying him.
Once or twice he nodded, a strange smile creeping over his face;
once his lips moved as though asking a question; no sound came
from them, but apparently he had his answer, for he nodded assent,
halted, drew a deep breath, and looked upward.</p>

<p>"We can try that," he said aloud in his naturally pleasant voice;
and, entering the house, went upstairs to his wife's apartments.</p>

<p>Shiela's maid answered his knock; a moment later, Shiela herself,
gowned for the afternoon, came to the door, and her maid retired.</p>

<p>"Do you mind my stepping in a moment?" he asked.</p>

<p>She glanced back into her own bedroom, closed the door, and led
the way to the small living-room at the other end of the house.</p>

<p>"Where's that maid of yours?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sewing in my dressing-room. Shall I send her downstairs?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it's better."</p>

<p>So Shiela went away and returned shortly saying that her maid
had gone; and then, with a questioning gesture to her husband,
she seated herself by the open window and looked out into the
sunshine, waiting for him to speak.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said abruptly, "what saved Cardross, Carrick
&amp; Co. from going to the wall?"</p>

<p>"What?" The quick, crisp question sounded like the crack of a
tiny whip.</p>

<p>He looked at her, languidly amused.</p>

<p>"You knew there was a panic?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"You knew that your father and Mr. Carrick were worried?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You didn't realise they were in bad shape?"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;very. Were they?"</p>

<p>"That they needed money, and that they couldn't go out into the
market and borrow it because nobody would lend any money to anybody?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand such details."</p>

<p>"Details? Ah&mdash;yes, quite so.... Then you were not aware that
a run was threatened on the Shoshone Securities Company and certain
affiliated banks?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but I did not suppose it meant anything alarming."</p>

<p>"And you didn't understand that your father and brother-in-law
could not convert their securities into the ready cash they needed
to meet their obligations&mdash;did you?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand details, Louis.... No."</p>

<p>"Or that they were desperate?"</p>

<p>Her face altered pitifully.</p>

<p>"On the edge of bankruptcy?" he went on.</p>

<p>"<em>What</em>!"</p>

<p>"Then," he said deliberately, "you don't know what helped them&mdash;what
tided them over those two days&mdash;what pulled them through by the
slimmest margin that ever saved the credit of anybody."</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;my money?"</p>

<p>"Yes; your money."</p>

<p>"Is it true, Louis?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>She leaned her head on her hand and sat gazing out of the open
window. There were tears very near her eyes, but the lids closed
and not one fell or even wet the thick lashes resting on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I supposed it would please you to know what you have done."</p>

<p>The face she turned toward him was wonderful in its radiance.</p>

<p>She said: "I have never been as happy in all my life, I think.
Thank you for telling me. I needed just&mdash;that."</p>

<p>He studied her for a moment, nimble wits at work. Then:</p>

<p>"Has your father&mdash;and the others&mdash;in their letters, said anything
about it to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father has. He did not say matters had been desperate."</p>

<p>"I suppose he does not dare commit such a thing to paper&mdash;yet....
<em>You</em> do not burn your letters," he added blandly.</p>

<p>"I have no reason to."</p>

<p>"It might save servants' gossip."</p>

<p>"What gossip?"&mdash;in cold surprise.</p>

<p>"There's a desk full of Hamil's letters upstairs, judging from
the writing on the envelopes." He added with a smile: "Although
I don't pry, some servants do. And if there is anything in those
letters you do not care to have discussed below stairs, you ought
either to lock them up or destroy them."</p>

<p>Her face was burning hot; but she met his gaze with equanimity,
slowly nodding serene assent to his suggestion.</p>

<p>"Shiela," he said pleasantly, "it looks to me as though what
you have done for your family in that hour of need rather balances
all accounts between you and them."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I say that you are square with them for what they have done
in the past for you."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I don't know what you mean, Louis."</p>

<p>He said patiently: "You had nothing to give but your fortune,
and you gave it."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Which settles your obligations toward them&mdash;puts them so deeply
for ever in your debt that&mdash;" He hesitated, considering the chances,
then, seriously persuasive:</p>

<p>"They are now in <em>your</em> debt, Shiela. They have sufficient
proof of your unselfish affection for them to stand a temporary
little shock. Why don't you administer it?"</p>

<p>"What shock?"&mdash;in an altered voice.</p>

<p>"Your divorce."</p>

<p>"I thought you were meaning that."</p>

<p>"I do mean it. You ought to have your freedom; you are ruining
your own life and Hamil's, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yours?"</p>

<p>"Let that go," he said almost savagely; "I can always get along.
But I want you to have your freedom to marry that damned fool,
Hamil."</p>

<p>The quick blood stung her face under his sudden blunt brutality.</p>

<p>"You think that because I returned a little money to my family,
it entitles me to publicly disgrace them?"</p>

<p>Malcourt's patience was fast going.</p>

<p>"Oh, for Heaven's sake, Shiela, shed your swaddling clothes and
act like something adult. Is there any reason why two people situated
as we are cannot discuss sensibly some method of mitigating our
misfortune? I'll do anything you say in the matter. Divorce is
a good thing sometimes. This is one of the times, and I'll give
you every reason for a successful suit against me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She rose, cheeks aflame, and in her eyes scorn ungovernable.</p>

<p>He rose too, exasperated.</p>

<p>"You won't consider it?" he asked harshly.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm not coward enough to ask others to bear the consequences
of my own folly and yours!"</p>

<p>"You little fool," he said, "do you think your family would let
you endure me for one second if they knew how you felt? Or what
I am likely to do at any moment?"</p>

<p>She stood, without replying, plainly waiting for him to leave
the room and her apartments. All her colour had fled.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, with an ugly glimmer in his eyes, "I need
not continue this appeal to your common sense, if you haven't
got any; I can force you to a choice."</p>

<p>"What choice?"&mdash;in leisurely contempt.</p>

<p>He hesitated; then, insolently: "Your choice between&mdash;honest
wifehood and honest divorce."</p>

<p>For a moment she could not comprehend: suddenly her hands contracted
and clinched as the crimson wave stained her from throat to brow.
But in her eyes was terror unutterable.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I beg&mdash;your pardon," he stammered. "I did not mean
to frighten you&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at his first word she clapped both hands over her ears, staring
at him in horror&mdash;backing away from him, shrinking flat against
the wall.</p>

<p>"Confound it! I am not threatening you," he said, raising his
voice; but she would not hear another word&mdash;he saw that now&mdash;and,
with a shrug, he walked past her, patient once more, outwardly
polite, inwardly bitterly amused, as he heard the key snap in
the door behind him.</p>

<p>Standing in his own office on the floor below, he glanced vacantly
around him. After a moment he said aloud, as though to somebody
in the room: "Well, I tried it. But that is not the way."</p>

<p>Later, young Mrs. Malcourt, passing, saw him seated at his desk,
head bent as though listening to something interesting. But there
was nobody else in the office.</p>

<p>When at last he roused himself the afternoon sun was shining
level in the west; long rosy beams struck through the woods turning
the silver stems of the birches pink.</p>

<p>On the footbridge spanning the meadow brook he saw his wife and
Hamil leaning over the hand-rail, shoulder almost touching shoulder;
and he went to the window and stood intently observing them.</p>

<p>They seemed to be conversing very earnestly; once she threw back
her pretty head and laughed unrestrainedly, and the clear sound
of it floated up to him through the late sunshine; and once she
shook her head emphatically, and once he saw her lay her hand
on Hamil's arm&mdash;an impulsive gesture, as though to enforce her
words, but it was more like a caress.</p>

<p>A tinge of malice altered Malcourt's smile as he watched them;
the stiffening grin twitched at his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Now I wonder," he thought to himself, "whether it is the right
way after all!... I don't think I'll threaten her again with&mdash;alternatives.
There's no telling what a fool might do in a panic." Then, as
though the spectacle bored him, he yawned, stretched his arms
and back gracefully, turned and touched the button that summoned
his servant.</p>

<p>"Order the horses and pack as usual, Simmons," he said with another
yawn. "I'm going to New York. Isn't Mr. Portlaw here yet?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you say he went away on horseback?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, this morning."</p>

<p>"And you don't know where?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Mr. Portlaw took the South Road."</p>

<p>Malcourt grinned again, perfectly certain, now, of Portlaw's
destination; and thinking to himself that unless his fatuous employer
had been landed in a ditch somewhere, en route, he was by this
time returning from Pride's Fall with considerable respect for
Mrs. Ascott.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>As a matter of fact, Portlaw had already started on his way back.
Mrs. Ascott was not at Pride's Hall&mdash;her house&mdash;when he presented
himself at the door. Her servant, evidently instructed, did not
know where Mrs. Ascott and Miss Palliser had gone or when they
might return.</p>

<p>So Portlaw betook himself heavily to the village inn, where he
insulted his astonished stomach with a noonday dinner, and found
the hard wooden chairs exceedingly unpleasant.</p>

<p>About five o'clock he got into his saddle with an unfeigned groan,
and out of it again at Mrs. Ascott's door. They told him there
that Mrs. Ascott was not at home.</p>

<p>Whether this might be the conventional manner of informing him
that she declined to receive him, or whether she really was out,
he had no means of knowing; so he left his cards for Mrs. Ascott
and Miss Palliser, also the note which young Mrs. Malcourt had
given him; clambered once more up the side of his horse, suppressing
his groans until out of hearing and well on his way toward the
fatal boundary.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon, sky and water had turned to a golden rose
hue; clouds of gnats danced madly over meadow pools, calm mirrors
of the sunset, save when a trout sprang quivering, a dark, slim
crescent against the light, falling back with a mellow splash
that set the pool rocking.</p>

<p>At gaze a deer looked at him from sedge, furry ears forward;
stamped, winded him, and, not frightened very much, trotted into
the dwarf willows, halting once or twice to look around.</p>

<p>As he advanced, his horse splashing through the flooded land
fetlock-deep in water, green herons flapped upward, protesting
harshly, circled overhead with leisurely wing-beats, and settled
on some dead limb, thin, strange shapes against the deepening
orange of the western heavens.</p>

<p>Portlaw, sitting his saddle gingerly, patronized nature askance;
and he saw across the flooded meadow where the river sand had
piled its smothering blanket&mdash;which phenomenon he was guiltily
aware was due to him.</p>

<p>Everywhere were signs of the late overflow&mdash;raw new gravel channels
for Painted Creek; river willows bent low where the flood had
winnowed; piles of driftwood jammed here and there; a single stone
pier stemming mid-stream, ancient floor and cover gone. More of
his work&mdash;or the consequences of it&mdash;this desolation; from which,
under his horse's feet, rose a hawk, flapping, furious, a half-drowned
snake dangling from the talon-clutch.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" muttered Portlaw, bringing his startled horse under discipline;
then forged forward across the drowned lands, sorry for his work,
sorry for his obstinacy, sorrier for himself; for Portlaw, in
some matters was illogically parsimonious; and it irked him dreadfully
to realise how utterly indefensible were his actions and how much
they promised to cost him.</p>

<p>"Unless," he thought cannily to himself, "I can fix it up with
her&mdash;for old friendship's sake&mdash;bah!&mdash;doing the regretful sinner
business&mdash;"</p>

<p>As the horse thrashed out of the drowned lands up into the flat
plateau where acres of alders, their tops level as a trimmed hedge,
stretched away in an even, green sea, a distant, rapping sound
struck his ear, sharp, regular as the tree-tapping of a cock-o'-the-woods.</p>

<p>Indifferently convinced that the great, noisy woodpecker was
the cause of the racket, he rode on toward the hard-wood ridge
dominating this plateau where his guests, last season, had shot
woodcock&mdash;one of the charges in the suit against him.</p>

<p>"The thing to do," he ruminated, "is to throw myself gracefully
on her mercy. Women like to have a chance to forgive you; Louis
says so, and he ought to know. What a devilishly noisy woodpecker!"</p>

<p>And, looking up, he drew bridle sharply.</p>

<p>For there, on the wood's edge, stood a familiar gray mare, and
in the saddle, astride, sat Alida Ascott, busily hammering tacks
into a trespass notice printed on white muslin, and attached to
the trunk of a big maple-tree.</p>

<p>So absorbed was she in her hammering that at first she neither
heard nor saw Portlaw when he finally ventured to advance; and
when she did she dropped the tack hammer in her astonishment.</p>

<p>He dismounted, with pain, to pick it up, presented it, face wreathed
in a series of appealing smiles, then, managing to scale the side
of his horse again, settled himself as comfortably as possible
for the impending conflict.</p>

<p>But Alida Ascott, in her boyish riding breeches and deep-skirted
coat, merely nodded her thanks, took hold of the hammer firmly,
and drove in more tacks, paying no further attention to William
Van Beuren Portlaw and his heart-rending smiles.</p>

<p>It was very embarrassing; he sidled his horse around so that
he might catch a glimpse of her profile. The view he obtained
was not encouraging.</p>

<p>"Alida," he ventured plaintively.</p>

<p>"Mr. Portlaw!"&mdash;so suddenly swinging on him that he lost all
countenance and blurted out:</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I only want to make amends and be friends."</p>

<p>"I expect you to make amends," she said in a significantly quiet
voice, which chilled him with the menace of damages unlimited.
And even in his perturbation he saw at once that it would never
do to have a backwoods jury look upon the fascinating countenance
of this young plaintiff.</p>

<p>"Alida," he said sorrowfully, "I am beginning to see things in
a clearer light."</p>

<p>"I think that light will grow very much clearer, Mr. Portlaw."</p>

<p>He repressed a shudder, and tried to look reproachful, but she
seemed to be very hard-hearted, for she turned once more to her
hammering.</p>

<p>"Alida!"</p>

<p>"What?"&mdash;continuing to drive tacks.</p>

<p>"After all these years of friendship it&mdash;it is perfectly painful
for me to contemplate a possible lawsuit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It will be more painful to contemplate an actual one, Mr. Portlaw."</p>

<p>"Alida, do you really mean that you&mdash;my neighbour and friend&mdash;are
going to press this unnatural complaint?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do."</p>

<p>Portlaw shook his head violently, and passed his gloved hand
over his eyes as though to rouse himself from a distressing dream;
all of which expressive pantomime was lost on Mrs. Ascott, who
was busy driving tacks.</p>

<p>"I simply cannot credit my senses," he said mournfully.</p>

<p>"You ought to try; it will be still more difficult later," she
observed, backing her horse so that she might inspect her handiwork
from the proper point of view.</p>

<p>Portlaw looked askance at the sign. It warned people not to shoot,
fish, cut trees, dam streams, or build fires under penalty of
the law; and was signed, "Alida Ascott."</p>

<p>"You didn't have any up before, did you?" he asked innocently.</p>

<p>"By advice of counsel I think I had better not reply, Mr. Portlaw.
But I believe that point will be brought out by my lawyers&mdash;unless"&mdash;with
a brilliant smile&mdash;"your own counsel sees fit to discuss it."</p>

<p>Portlaw was convinced that his hair was stirring under his cap.
He was horribly afraid of the law.</p>

<p>"See here, Alida," he said, assuming the bluff rough-diamond
front which the alarm in his eyes made foolish, "I want to settle
this little difference and be friends with you again. I was wrong;
I admit it.... Of course I might very easily defend such a suit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, of course"&mdash;serenely undeceived&mdash;"as you admit you are
in the wrong you will scarcely venture to defend such a suit.
<em>Your</em> lawyers ought to forbid <em>you</em> to talk about
this case, particularly"&mdash;with a demure smile&mdash;"to the plaintiff."</p>

<p>"Alida," he said, "I am determined to remain your friend. You
may do what you will, say what you wish, yes, even use my own
words against me, but"&mdash;and virtue fairly exuded from every perspiring
pore&mdash;"I will not retaliate!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you can't, William," she said softly.</p>

<p>"Won't you&mdash;forgive?" he asked in a melting voice; but his eyes
were round with apprehension.</p>

<p>"There are some things that no woman can overlook," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll send my men down to fix that bridge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bridges can be mended; I was not speaking of the bridge."</p>

<p>"You mean those sheep&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Portlaw."</p>

<p>"Well, there's a lot &mdash;I mean that some little sand has
been washed over your meadow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good night," she said, turning her horse's head.</p>

<p>"Isn't it the sand, Alida?" he pleaded. "You surely will forgive
that timber-cutting&mdash;and the shooting of a few migratory birds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good night," touching her gray mare forward to where he was
awkwardly blocking the wood-path.... "Do you mind moving a trifle,
Mr. Portlaw?"</p>

<p>"About&mdash;ah&mdash;the&mdash;down there, you know, at Palm Beach," he stammered,
"at that accursed lawn-party&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" She smiled but her eyes harboured lightning.</p>

<p>"It was so hot in Florida&mdash;you know how infernally hot it was,
don't you, Alida?" he asked beseechingly. "I scarcely dared leave
the Beach Club."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I thought I'd just m-m-mention it. That's why I didn't
call on you &mdash;I was afraid of sunstroke&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" she exclaimed, astonished at his stuttering audacity.</p>

<p>He knew he was absurd, but it was all he could think of. She
gave him time enough to realise the pitiable spectacle he was
making of himself, sitting her horse motionless, pretty eyes bent
on his&mdash;an almost faultless though slight figure, smooth as a
girl's yet faintly instinct with that charm of ripened adolescence
just short of maturity.</p>

<p>And, slowly, under her clear gaze, a confused comprehension began
to stir in him&mdash;at first only a sort of chagrin, then something
more&mdash;a consciousness of his own heaviness of intellect and grossness
of figure&mdash;the fatness of mind and body which had developed so
rapidly within the last two years.</p>

<p>There she sat, as slim and pretty and fresh as ever; and only
two years ago he had been mentally and physically active enough
to find vigorous amusement in her company. Malcourt's stinging
words concerning his bodily unloveliness and self-centred inertia
came into his mind; and a slow blush deepened the colour in his
heavy face.</p>

<p>What vanity he had reckoned on had deserted him along with any
hope of compromising a case only too palpably against him. And
yet, through the rudiments of better feeling awakening within
him, the instinct of thrift still coloured his ideas a little.</p>

<p>"I'm dead wrong, Alida. We might just as well save fees and costs
and go over the damages together.... I'll pay them. I ought to,
anyway. I suppose I don't usually do what I ought. Malcourt says
I don't&mdash;said so very severely&mdash;very mortifyingly the other day.
So&mdash;if you'll get him or your own men to decide on the amount&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think the amount matters?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course it's principle; very proper of you to stand on
your dignity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not standing on it now; I am listening to your utter misapprehension
of me and my motives.... I don't care for any&mdash;damages."</p>

<p>"It is perfectly proper for you to claim them, if," he added
cautiously, "they are within reason&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Portlaw!"</p>

<p>"What?" he asked, alarmed.</p>

<p>"I would not touch a penny! I meant to give it to the schools,
here&mdash;whatever I recovered.... Your misunderstanding of me is
abominable!"</p>

<p>He hung his head, heavy-witted, confused as a stupid schoolboy,
feeling, helplessly, his clumsiness of mind and body.</p>

<p>Something of this may have been perceptible to her&mdash;may have
softened her ideas concerning him&mdash;ideas which had accumulated
bitterness during the year of his misbehaviour and selfish neglect.
Her instinct divined in his apparently sullen attitude the slow
intelligence and mental perturbation of a wilful, selfish boy
made stupid through idleness and self-indulgence. Even what had
been clean-cut, attractive, in his face and figure was being marred
and coarsened by his slothful habits to an extent that secretly
dismayed her; for she had always thought him very handsome; and,
with that natural perversity of selection, finding in him a perfect
foil to her own character, had been seriously inclined to like
him.</p>

<p>Attractions begin in that way, sometimes, where the gentler is
the stronger, the frailer, the dominant character; and the root
is in the feminine instinct to care for, develop, and make the
most of what palpably needs a protectorate.</p>

<p>Without comprehending her own instinct, Mrs. Ascott had found
the preliminary moulding of Portlaw an agreeable diversion; had
rather taken for granted that she was doing him good; and was
correspondingly annoyed when he parted his moorings and started
drifting aimlessly as a derelict scow awash, floundering seaward
without further notice of the trim little tug standing by and
amiably ready to act as convoy.</p>

<p>Now, sitting her saddle in silence she surveyed him, striving
to understand him&mdash;his recent indifference, his deterioration,
the present figure he was cutting. And it seemed to her a trifle
sad that he had no one to tell him a few wholesome truths.</p>

<p>"Mr. Portlaw," she said, "do you know that you have been exceedingly
rude to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <em>I&mdash;</em>do know it."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked simply.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Didn't you care for our friendship? Didn't it amuse and interest
you? How could you have done the things you did&mdash;in the way you
did?... If you had asked my permission to build a dozen dams I'd
have given it. Didn't you know it? But my self-respect protested
when you so cynically ignored me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm a beast all right," he muttered.</p>

<p>She gazed at him, softened, even faintly amused at his repentant
bad-boy attitude.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to forgive you, Mr. Portlaw?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but you oughtn't."</p>

<p>"That is quite true.... Turn your horse and ride back with me.
I'm going to find out exactly how repentant you really are....
If you pass a decent examination you may dine with Miss Palliser,
Mr. Wayward, and me. It's too late anyway to return through the
forest.... I'll send you over in the motor."</p>

<p>And as they wheeled and walked their horses forward through the
dusk, she said impulsively:</p>

<p>"We have four for Bridge if you like."</p>

<p>"Alida," he said sincerely, "you <em>are</em> a corker."</p>

<p>She looked up demurely. What she could see to interest her in
this lump of a man Heaven alone knew, but a hint of the old half-patient,
half-amused liking for him and his slow wits began to flicker
once more. De gustibus&mdash;alas!</p>
