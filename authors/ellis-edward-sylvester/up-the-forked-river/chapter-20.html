<p>It will be recalled that the catboat, in which Major Jack Starland
was descending the river in company with Captain Guzman and the
Atlamalcan deserter, Martella, landed them at the spot where the
young women had left the tug the night before, the cause for which
action on their part has been made clear. This took place early
in the afternoon, and, under the guidance of Martella, the three
started inland over the trail that had been followed by the two
ponies less than four and twenty hours before.</p>

<p>While all doubt of the presence of his sister at the Castle had
been removed, the young American officer did a big lot of thinking
when tracing the path through the mountains. He felt certain that
when General Yozarro sent the two thither under escort, he had
arranged to prevent their leaving until it should suit his pleasure.
It followed, therefore, that despite the outrage, it was necessary
for Starland to act with great prudence. He had only two companions
and he placed little reliance on the Atlamalcan. To attempt to
bluff matters with such an insignificant force would be the height
of folly. One man-of-war from the United States would find it
child's play to blow these miserable little republics off the
face of the earth, and when his government should be appealed
to, it would be certain to bring down a heavy hand upon the offenders;
but days and weeks must pass before that could be brought about,
and there was no saying what deviltry would be wrought in the
meantime. If ever there was call for hurry and the display of
the wisdom of the serpent it was now.</p>

<p>When therefore the three drew near the plateau on which the Castle
stood, the Major said:</p>

<p>"You and I, Captain, will wait here while Martella goes forward
and learns how the land lies."</p>

<p>"If the Señoritas are restrained of their liberty by only five
or six Atlamalcans, why should we hesitate?"</p>

<p>"We shall not, if such proves to be the fact; but if there are
more, it is not well to attack until that is the only means left.
It will be little trouble for Martella to learn the truth."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that he shall make himself known?"</p>

<p>"If necessary; what objection is there to that?"</p>

<p>"He is a deserter from the service of General Yozarro, who will
show him no mercy if he once lays hand on him."</p>

<p>"It cannot be generally known as yet; I understand he merely
came away with you, as if for a visit; he will be safe for several
days. Such is my view; am I right, Martella?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, but I am not afraid of the risk."</p>

<p>"I do not wish you to run into unnecessary danger, but you need
no instruction from me; make all haste."</p>

<p>The native strode from them at an even pace until he was shut
from sight by the bend in the trail. We know what he then did.
He did not think it wise to reveal himself at the time and made
his reconnoissance therefore from a distance. It did not take
him long to learn that the Castle was guarded by a dozen men at
least and probably by more. This was reported to his friends on
his return.</p>

<p>"That puts a different face on matters," was the comment of the
American; "it would be madness to attack such a force when we
have only one rifle among us."</p>

<p>Until now Major Starland had held slight opinion of the courage
and ability of the deserter, but the latter straightway made a
proposal whose daring fairly took away his breath.</p>

<p>"Señor the Major may have been right when he said my desertion
would not be known for several days, but he mistook when he thought
I had made no mention of it. I told Valentin Herrera, the engineer
of the gunboat, before I left; I asked him to tell General Yozarro
with word from me that if I ever gained a chance I should kill
him just as surely as he killed my brother. The engineer promised
to bear the message to General Yozarro and I doubt not that it
will be repeated to him before the sun sets."</p>

<p>"Martella, you're a fool!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied the native with a grin and shrug; "but Señor
the Major does not reflect that General Yozarro would have me
shot for leaving the boat without his permission. He can do no
more with me than that,&mdash;why should I rob myself of the pleasure
of sending him an insulting message?"</p>

<p>"In other words, you might as well be in for a sheep as a lamb.
Very well; have you any plan to offer?"</p>

<p>"I will go to Captain Navarro of the guard and tell him I come
as a messenger from General Yozarro, who is waiting with the gunboat
to take the Señoritas to Atlamalco, and he must not delay in obeying
the command."</p>

<p>The American looked at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"Have you the nerve for that, Martella?"</p>

<p>"I await only your permission."</p>

<p>"I cannot permit you to run such risk; better that I should go
myself and make the demand upon Captain Navarro."</p>

<p>"The captain has been warned not to permit any such thing, on
his life. You know that though General Yozarro may be aware I
have left his service, it is not likely to be known to Captain
Navarro."</p>

<p>"It is a fearful risk, Martella. You are a good deal braver than
I thought; I accept your offer; but you have no acquaintance with
the ladies; they will not come away with you."</p>

<p>"You can write me a few lines to hand to the American Señorita
that will explain it all to her."</p>

<p>Major Starland had a feeling that it was hardly right to allow
this simple hearted fellow to sacrifice himself in this manner.
He turned to Captain Guzman, who was silently smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"It is the only plan that will succeed and there is no certainty
that it will not fail. But let it be tried."</p>

<p>"Will the captain of the guard obey a verbal order which it is
proposed to say is sent by General Yozarro?"</p>

<p>Martella lifted his shoulders.</p>

<p>"If he refuses we shall be no worse off than before."</p>

<p>"We shall not, but you're likely to be. However, here goes!"</p>

<p>He whipped out his note book and hastily penned the few lines
that have already been revealed.</p>

<p>"God go with you, Martella! You are a valiant man; I can hardly
believe you will succeed, but the need is desperate."</p>

<p>The deserter quietly shoved the little fold of paper in his pocket,
close to his terrible knife, and without another word passed up
the trail, his friends following him as far as was thought prudent.
It was not well for them to be seen by any of the guard, since
it must draw suspicion to the plan.</p>
