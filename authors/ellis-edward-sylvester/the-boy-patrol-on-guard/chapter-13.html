<p>Less than half a mile farther brought the troop of Boy Scouts
to the home of Elkanah Sisum, their Instructor in Woodcraft. Naturally
he took the lead, with Scout Master Hall next and the youths straggling
after them.</p>

<p>Expressions of pleased surprise followed the sight of the log
structure in the midst of the neat patch of cultivated ground.
Mike Murphy was the only lad who was familiar with the place and
he held his peace. While his waggishness was generally irrepressible,
he knew when good taste suggested that others do most of the talking.</p>

<p>The party had stood only a few minutes feasting their eyes, when
Mr. Hall asked:</p>

<p>"How long have you lived here, Uncle Elk?"</p>

<p>"Some fifteen years, which have been years of quiet meditation
and serene enjoyment. While I do not wish to cut myself wholly
off from the society of my fellow men and I make occasional visits
to Boothbay Harbor and even to Portland, yet my comfort is here
among my books with my own thoughts and in communion with my Maker,
tending the piece of ground, fishing, and hunting for the smaller
game that is found in this part of Maine."</p>

<p>A slight but significant fact must be recorded. It was at this
time that Scout Master Hall noticed a vague peculiarity in the
manner of the old man which he would have found it hard to describe.
It appeared in his manner and very faintly in his voice. The leader
was the only one who detected it and he made no reference to it
until long afterward.</p>

<p>The survey was brief when their guide walked forward to the open
space in front of his dwelling, where he again halted and spoke
to those gathered about him:</p>

<p>"When I finished building my cabin, the only lock I placed on
the door was the old-fashioned latch. I shoved the leathern string
through the auger hole above it, so that it hung outside, and
never since then by night or day, in sunshine or storm, through
winter or summer, has it been drawn inside. I keep open house
and every one who chooses to honor me with a call is welcome."</p>

<p>"Do you have many visitors?" asked Alvin Landon.</p>

<p>"Weeks have passed without bringing one; then I have had as many
as two in twenty-four hours. I have lately had that number. The
first was Michael last night and the second a stranger whom I
have never seen, but who called this forenoon after I left home."</p>

<p>The old man enjoyed the astonishment of his visitors.</p>

<p>"If you have never seen him how do you know he has been here?"
was the natural question of Patrol Leader Chase.</p>

<p>"I saw the proof in the same moment that I reached the clearing.
He came across the lake in a canoe, walked up the path, entered
the house, stayed a little while and then left. You being strangers
in this section could hardly be expected to discover the shadowy
impressions of his shoe here and there, especially since your
failure a little while ago to find the trail of the wild animal
prowling in your neighborhood."</p>

<p>"Ye will not forgit, Uncle Elk, that it was mesilf that told
ye about the beast that took a promenade by the spot," reminded
Mike Murphy.</p>

<p>"No; I am not likely to forget that, but I <em>am</em> forgetting
the claims of hospitality. I can’t offer you the elbow room you
have at the clubhouse, but you are none the less welcome."</p>

<p>He twitched the latchstring, the door being so balanced on its
hinges that it swung inward of itself. He stepped across the threshold
to the mantel where Scout Master Hall was sure he saw him take
a small article, glance at it and then shove it into his pocket.
Facing about he called to his friends to enter.</p>

<p>They crowded into the room. The host did not draw aside the curtain
which shut off the other half of the lower floor and which was
his sleeping quarters.</p>

<p>You have read a partial description of the home of the hermit,—the
most surprising feature of which was the well-thumbed volumes
of scientific and scholarly works, in addition to several high
class magazines and publications. Mr. Hall noticed that while
the visitors were gazing around with natural curiosity, Uncle
Elk stopped for a moment in front of his book shelf, glanced at
the volumes and then quickly stooping, picked up what seemed to
be a speck of dust from the bare floor. It was all done so quickly
that the Scout Master would never have recalled it but for that
which followed.</p>

<p>There were not enough seats for a third of the company and the
youths kept their feet. Perhaps it was a harmless touch of vanity,
with which all of us are more or less endowed, that led Uncle
Elk to make a display of his skill as a detective.</p>

<p>"Yes," he added a few minutes later; "there has been a caller
here during my absence this forenoon."</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall had the tact to humor the harmless weakness
of the old man.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me whether he was an Indian or a white man?"</p>

<p>"He was of the same race as ourselves and is about forty years
old. He carried no weapon,—nothing more than a fishing tackle.
He is well off in the world’s goods, has been three days in the
neighborhood and is friendly toward me."</p>

<p>"I could have told ye the last, Uncle Elk," said Mike, "for there
isn’t anybody who doesn’t feel that way."</p>

<p>"Well said," commented Scout Master Hall, "and it is true."</p>

<p>The old gentleman bowed in acknowledgment of the compliment.</p>

<p>"You may suspect I am guessing, but I am not. When the man entered
and saw that the owner was absent, he made himself at home, as
I wish every one to do while awaiting my return. I suppose it
was natural that he should be struck by my little library. He
examined some of the books, and while doing so used the fingers
of his right hand to scratch his beard, as a man often does unconsciously.
He withdrew four of the volumes from the shelf, but was not much
interested in them, for he replaced them, lighted a perfecto cigar,
sat down in my easy chair, smoked a little while, with the chair
gently rocking, then with his cigar half consumed, he passed out
of the door and down the path to where he had left his canoe and
paddled across the lake."</p>

<p>Even with the assurance given by Uncle Elk, some of his listeners
found it hard to credit all he said. He looked calmly into the
array of faces, well aware of what was in the minds of his callers.
He expected a question and Mr. Hall asked it:</p>

<p>"We know that all you have told us is true, because you said
it was. They recall so vividly some of the ‘deductions’ of Sherlock
Holmes that I hope you will enlighten us as to your methods."</p>

<p>"What doubt has occurred to you?"</p>

<p>"You detected the faint disturbances made by the visitor’s feet,
where he did not keep to the middle of the path. These told you
the shoes were those of a white man, because, I presume of their
fashionable make, and they showed that he came from and returned
to the lake, but what warrant have you for saying he carried a
rod?"</p>

<p>"He leaned it against the front of the house at the side of the
steps where the imprint plainly shows. It was natural for him
to do that instead of carrying it inside."</p>

<p>"Why do you decide that he is a man in middle life?"</p>

<p>Uncle Elk was manifestly pleased by the chance to display his
ingenuity.</p>

<p>"Let me explain several deductions of rather evident facts. At
the right hand end of the upper shelf of books are four volumes:
Fiske’s ‘Cosmic Philosophy’; James’ ‘Pragmatism’ and ‘Pluralistic
Universe,’ and Henri Bergson’s ‘Creative Evolution.’ These books
are a trifle out of alignment,—just enough so to show it was caused
by some one else. Therefore he took them from their places. In
returning the books to the shelf, he changed the places of Prof.
James’ two works,—another proof if it were needed of the accuracy
of my deduction. He must have stood exactly in front of that side
of the book shelves, for on the floor to the right of such position
are several short hairs, some black and some gray. They would
not have fallen of themselves and must have been displaced by
his fingers. They tell me his beard was grizzled or mixed and
consequently he was in middle life."</p>

<p>"Your explanation is based on the theory that he is right handed,"
said the Scout Master; "are you not guessing there, Uncle Elk?"</p>

<p>"No; standing directly in front of the four volumes, the few
threads of hair fell still further to the right. Their texture
shows they came from his beard and not the crown of his head.
They would not have fallen as they did unless they were displaced
by the hand on that side of the man."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," continued the Scout Master, "that in so trifling
a matter a person would make no distinction in the use of his
hands. Besides, some persons are ambidextrous."</p>

<p>"In certain circumstances he would use either hand, but the position
of the outermost volume shows that it was shoved back by the same
hand that loosened the two or three strands from his beard. When
a man uses the same hand to do both of those things, it is good
proof that he is right handed."</p>

<p>"I am at a loss to understand how the position of the books shows
that your visitor employed his right hand in restoring them to
their places." Uncle Elk’s eyes twinkled as he grew more subtle.</p>

<p>"You may think my explanation fine spun, but it is absolutely
logical. It happens that ‘Pragmatism’ is the least interesting
volume to me. I have not opened it for several weeks. A slight
film of dust has gathered on the upper gilt edges. In withdrawing
the book I rest my thumb against the upper part of the back and
my first two fingers on the top; so every one does. Observe."</p>

<p>Uncle Elk illustrated his words. With the book in his hand he
shifted it about so that the sunlight was reflected from the bright
yellow.</p>

<p>"There are the marks made by the first two fingers of a man’s
hand, but the disturbance of the fine layer of dust clearly shows
that the finger to the right was longer than the other. That is
to say, it was the right hand: do I make myself clear?"</p>

<p>"You do how do you know the man sat down in your chair and rocked
back and forth?"</p>

<p>"That is the simplest matter of all. I suppose that living as
I do I become more or less a crank. One of my notions is never
to leave the house without seeing that the left rocker of my chair
is exactly over and in a line with that crack in the floor. Notice
now and you will see that it rests diagonally across the crack.
Do you ask anything plainer than that?"</p>

<p>It was Bobby Rice who made the natural remark:</p>

<p>"I don’t see why a rocking chair should shift about."</p>

<p>"Arrah now, have ye no sinse?" asked Mike Murphy reprovingly;
"Uncle Elk didn’t say <em>why</em> a rocking chair kicks up its
heels, but ye ought to know that the craturs always do so without
giving any raison or excuse. Haven’t I tried to use me mither’s
chair at home wid the result that it always hitches through the
dure whin I’m not thinking and gives me a back somersault? Ye
surprise me by your stupidity, as Jim Hooligan said whin his taycher
remarked he could not see what plisure a lad found in fighting
two ither lads."</p>

<p>"Why were you so quick to say your visitor is a man in good circumstances?"
asked Scout Master Hall.</p>

<p>"Because he smokes fifteen-cent cigars. Most campers out are
fond of the brier-wood pipe, but when they use cigars they don’t
buy expensive ones unless they can afford it, and not always then."</p>

<p>"What fact gives you so much confidence in their quality?"</p>

<p>"I know the brand, for I have smoked them myself; I caught the
fragrance the moment I opened the door; the silken ashes which
he flipped off in the fireplace is another proof if you wish it.
Michael, are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"I couldn’t do better mesilf, but ye haven’t completed yer rivelations."</p>

<p>"What is lacking?"</p>

<p>"I demand that ye give us the name of the gintleman that ye niver
met or heard of and that spint a part of to-day at yer risidence."</p>

<p>"He is a physician named Wilson Spellman."</p>

<p>The boys stared at one another, with expressions of incredulity.
It sounded as if Uncle Elk was presuming too far upon their simplicity.
By way of answer he drew a card from his pocket and held it up
so that those nearest readily read the name engraved thereon.
Below it were the pencilled words:</p>

<p>"Come and see me at my camp on the upper side of the lake."</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall recalled the crossing of the floor by Uncle
Elk, when he opened the door, as well as his quick scrutiny of
the book shelves.</p>

<p>"The message written below shows the doctor’s friendly disposition,
and is a further proof—which was not needed—that he is a white
man. Since he has waived ceremony and called upon me, I shall
not wait long before returning the courtesy."</p>

<p>"He has been in the neighborhood for three days?" said the Scout
Master inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes; I saw the smoke of his camp-fire three mornings ago. We
should have seen him paddling across the lake this morning, had
we not all been so far in the woods."</p>

<p>The Boy Scouts now wandered over the grounds, under the direction
of their owner, who suggested that as it was near noon, they should
use their lines and prepare a fish dinner as his guests. The Scout
Master thanked him but amended by proposing that they should all
go back to the clubhouse, where they had abundant supplies and
every needed convenience, and that he should favor them with his
presence. He finally decided to stay in his own home until late
in the afternoon, when he would join them for supper. He agreed
to this the more readily since it was understood that Mike Murphy
was to be initiated as a Tenderfoot Scout,—that is provided he
could pass the necessary examination. No one except he and Uncle
Elk knew the thorough instruction he had received and the boys,
including the Scout Master, thought it hardly possible for the
youth to answer the questions, unless they were made specially
easy. It was the self-confidence of Mike himself that permitted
the test to go on.</p>

<p>"Don’t let up aither," he said to the leader; "soak it into me
the best ye know how. If I’m to be squashed, I want to be squashed
fair and square, as Pat Rooney said whin three automobiles ran
over him."</p>

<p>The balmy afternoon passed rapidly, with several of the boys
fishing from the canoes along shore and others wandering through
the woods, brightening their knowledge of the different trees
and studying the birds, of which only a moderate number were observed.</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall saw in Mike Murphy the making of a model Boy
Scout. It may be said that when the troop convened that evening,
chiefly by the glow of the oil lamp suspended overhead from a
beam in the middle of the ceiling, the meeting was a special one,
called for the purpose of helping a young tenderfoot along the
trail. The proceedings may not have been strictly regular, but
no criticism could be made upon their spirit.</p>

<p>Uncle Elk was invited to occupy the seat of honor as it may be
called, but he preferred to remain in the background as observer
and listener. The night was cool enough to make enjoyable the
crackling logs on the broad hearth and to add to the illumination
of the spacious apartment. There was considerable rain and cool
weather in August that year.</p>

<p>At about eight o’clock, Scout Master Hall opened the session
with a commendation of the Boy Scout organization and a compliment
to those who wished to join it. As it was impossible to have the
examination conducted as prescribed by the Court of Honor, the
Scout Master assumed the duty himself.</p>

<p>The second step would have been the collection of observation
lists for future use, but this was omitted, as was the call for
drill formation. The National Flag was displayed and the scout
salute and sign followed, winding up with two good yells which
made the rafters of the bungalow ring.</p>

<p>Mike was now questioned as to his knowledge of our banner. He
was entitled to a written examination, but declined it and again
urged his examiner to show no mercy. Standing in the middle of
the room the candidate amazed his listeners. Not only did he promptly
answer every prescribed question, but he interjected many facts
that were new to nearly all who heard them. I have already hinted
of several, such, for instance, as that our flag throughout the
War of 1812 bore fifteen instead of thirteen stripes, and that
Congress restored the original number in 1818, knowing that otherwise
the beautiful symmetry of the emblem would be destroyed by the
increase in the number of States.</p>

<p>"Michael," said the Instructor from where he was sitting; "can
you tell us to whom the credit belongs for the present pattern
of our flag?"</p>

<p>"To Captain Samuel C. Reid—God bless his memory!"</p>

<p>"And who was Captain Samuel C. Reid?"</p>

<p>"He commanded the American privateer, <em>General Armstrong</em>,
which knocked the iver-lasting stuffing out of a British squadron
of three vessels and two thousand men, while he had liss than
a hundred heroes. Worra, worra, what a shindy that must have been!"</p>

<p>And then Mike impressively repeated the lines that Uncle Elk
had taught him:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Tell the story to your sons<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the gallant days of yore,<br/>
When the brig of seven guns<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fought the fleet of seven score.<br/>
From the set of sun till morn, through the long September night—<br/>
Ninety men against two thousand, and the ninety won the fight—<br/>
In the harbor of Fayal in the Azore."

</p>
</div>
<p>By this time, the Scout Master and everyone of the boys were
convinced of the truth. They knew the theme that had engaged Uncle
Elk and Mike the evening before, and had they felt any doubt on
that point it would have been quenched by the sly glances that
flitted between the couple.</p>

<p>The next requirement was for the candidate to step to the table
in the middle of the room, where two pieces of hempen cord had
been laid, and to tie at least four of the eight knots which have
been already explained. He held up the pieces, like a magician
about to give an exhibition of his skill, and tied every one with
a deft quickness that brought a hum of admiration.</p>

<p>Then he took the scout oath, explaining all its provisions in
his own language or rather in that of his brilliant teacher, not
forgetting the significance of the scout badge and that which
is worn by the tenderfoot. The Scout Master pinned the badge over
the left upper pocket of his coat. The whole company clapped their
hands.</p>

<p>"I am delighted, Mike," said Mr. Hall; "I never knew any one
to acquit himself so admirably. If the opportunity presents itself,
you will make as creditable a Second Class and finally a First
Class Scout, with no end of merit badges. You know you must serve
a month before you are eligible for the next grade. Our stay in
Maine will be no longer than that and I shall not have the pleasure,
therefore, of witnessing your advancement. Your home is in this
State and you will probably demit from our Patrol and join some
other more convenient. I understand that Rev. Mr. Brown, the Methodist
minister at Boothbay Harbor, has organized a fine company of Boy
Scouts, and they will be glad to welcome you to their ranks. I
wonder, even when I know the circumstances, how you acquired such
a knowledge of the duties of a tenderfoot."</p>

<p>"Begging yer pardon," replied Mike with a grin; "there’s no cause
fur wonder. The knowledge of which ye spake and which passed through
me noddle, come from <em>him</em>."</p>

<p>And he pointed at Uncle Elk, sitting behind the others, who so
far as his beard permitted one to see, smiled and said nothing. </p>
