<p>Uncomfortable as the night, with its rocking movement, and salt
smells, may have been, and in one case undoubtedly was, for Mr.
Pepper had insufficient clothes upon his bed, the breakfast next
morning wore a kind of beauty. The voyage had begun, and had begun
happily with a soft blue sky, and a calm sea. The sense of untapped
resources, things to say as yet unsaid, made the hour significant,
so that in future years the entire journey perhaps would be represented
by this one scene, with the sound of sirens hooting in the river
the night before, somehow mixing in.</p>

<p>The table was cheerful with apples and bread and eggs. Helen
handed Willoughby the butter, and as she did so cast her eye on
him and reflected, "And she married you, and she was happy, I
suppose."</p>

<p>She went off on a familiar train of thought, leading on to all
kinds of well-known reflections, from the old wonder, why Theresa
had married Willoughby?</p>

<p>"Of course, one sees all that," she thought, meaning that one
sees that he is big and burly, and has a great booming voice,
and a fist and a will of his own; "but&mdash;" here she slipped into
a fine analysis of him which is best represented by one word,
"sentimental," by which she meant that he was never simple and
honest about his feelings. For example, he seldom spoke of the
dead, but kept anniversaries with singular pomp. She suspected
him of nameless atrocities with regard to his daughter, as indeed
she had always suspected him of bullying his wife. Naturally she
fell to comparing her own fortunes with the fortunes of her friend,
for Willoughby's wife had been perhaps the one woman Helen called
friend, and this comparison often made the staple of their talk.
Ridley was a scholar, and Willoughby was a man of business. Ridley
was bringing out the third volume of Pindar when Willoughby was
launching his first ship. They built a new factory the very year
the commentary on Aristotle&mdash;was it?&mdash;appeared at the University
Press. "And Rachel," she looked at her, meaning, no doubt, to
decide the argument, which was otherwise too evenly balanced,
by declaring that Rachel was not comparable to her own children.
"She really might be six years old," was all she said, however,
this judgment referring to the smooth unmarked outline of the
girl's face, and not condemning her otherwise, for if Rachel were
ever to think, feel, laugh, or express herself, instead of dropping
milk from a height as though to see what kind of drops it made,
she might be interesting though never exactly pretty. She was
like her mother, as the image in a pool on a still summer's day
is like the vivid flushed face that hangs over it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Helen herself was under examination, though not from
either of her victims. Mr. Pepper considered her; and his meditations,
carried on while he cut his toast into bars and neatly buttered
them, took him through a considerable stretch of autobiography.
One of his penetrating glances assured him that he was right last
night in judging that Helen was beautiful. Blandly he passed her
the jam. She was talking nonsense, but not worse nonsense than
people usually do talk at breakfast, the cerebral circulation,
as he knew to his cost, being apt to give trouble at that hour.
He went on saying "No" to her, on principle, for he never yielded
to a woman on account of her sex. And here, dropping his eyes
to his plate, he became autobiographical. He had not married himself
for the sufficient reason that he had never met a woman who commanded
his respect. Condemned to pass the susceptible years of youth
in a railway station in Bombay, he had seen only coloured women,
military women, official women; and his ideal was a woman who
could read Greek, if not Persian, was irreproachably fair in the
face, and able to understand the small things he let fall while
undressing. As it was he had contracted habits of which he was
not in the least ashamed. Certain odd minutes every day went to
learning things by heart; he never took a ticket without noting
the number; he devoted January to Petronius, February to Catullus,
March to the Etruscan vases perhaps; anyhow he had done good work
in India, and there was nothing to regret in his life except the
fundamental defects which no wise man regrets, when the present
is still his. So concluding he looked up suddenly and smiled.
Rachel caught his eye.</p>

<p>"And now you've chewed something thirty-seven times, I suppose?"
she thought, but said politely aloud, "Are your legs troubling
you to-day, Mr. Pepper?"</p>

<p>"My shoulder blades?" he asked, shifting them painfully. "Beauty
has no effect upon uric acid that I'm aware of," he sighed, contemplating
the round pane opposite, through which the sky and sea showed
blue. At the same time he took a little parchment volume from
his pocket and laid it on the table. As it was clear that he invited
comment, Helen asked him the name of it. She got the name; but
she got also a disquisition upon the proper method of making roads.
Beginning with the Greeks, who had, he said, many difficulties
to contend with, he continued with the Romans, passed to England
and the right method, which speedily became the wrong method,
and wound up with such a fury of denunciation directed against
the road-makers of the present day in general, and the road-makers
of Richmond Park in particular, where Mr. Pepper had the habit
of cycling every morning before breakfast, that the spoons fairly
jingled against the coffee cups, and the insides of at least four
rolls mounted in a heap beside Mr. Pepper's plate.</p>

<p>"Pebbles!" he concluded, viciously dropping another bread pellet
upon the heap. "The roads of England are mended with pebbles!
'With the first heavy rainfall,' I've told 'em, 'your road will
be a swamp.' Again and again my words have proved true. But d'you
suppose they listen to me when I tell 'em so, when I point out
the consequences, the consequences to the public purse, when I
recommend 'em to read Coryphaeus? No, Mrs. Ambrose, you will form
no just opinion of the stupidity of mankind until you have sat
upon a Borough Council!" The little man fixed her with a glance
of ferocious energy.</p>

<p>"I have had servants," said Mrs. Ambrose, concentrating her gaze.
"At this moment I have a nurse. She's a good woman as they go,
but she's determined to make my children pray. So far, owing to
great care on my part, they think of God as a kind of walrus;
but now that my back's turned &mdash;Ridley," she demanded, swinging
round upon her husband, "what shall we do if we find them saying
the Lord's Prayer when we get home again?"</p>

<p>Ridley made the sound which is represented by "Tush." But Willoughby,
whose discomfort as he listened was manifested by a slight movement
rocking of his body, said awkwardly, "Oh, surely, Helen, a little
religion hurts nobody."</p>

<p>"I would rather my children told lies," she replied, and while
Willoughby was reflecting that his sister-in-law was even more
eccentric than he remembered, pushed her chair back and swept
upstairs. In a second they heard her calling back, "Oh, look!
We're out at sea!"</p>

<p>They followed her on to the deck. All the smoke and the houses
had disappeared, and the ship was out in a wide space of sea very
fresh and clear though pale in the early light. They had left
London sitting on its mud. A very thin line of shadow tapered
on the horizon, scarcely thick enough to stand the burden of Paris,
which nevertheless rested upon it. They were free of roads, free
of mankind, and the same exhilaration at their freedom ran through
them all. The ship was making her way steadily through small waves
which slapped her and then fizzled like effervescing water, leaving
a little border of bubbles and foam on either side. The colourless
October sky above was thinly clouded as if by the trail of wood-fire
smoke, and the air was wonderfully salt and brisk. Indeed it was
too cold to stand still. Mrs. Ambrose drew her arm within her
husband's, and as they moved off it could be seen from the way
in which her sloping cheek turned up to his that she had something
private to communicate. They went a few paces and Rachel saw them
kiss.</p>

<p>Down she looked into the depth of the sea. While it was slightly
disturbed on the surface by the passage of the <em>Euphrosyne</em>,
beneath it was green and dim, and it grew dimmer and dimmer until
the sand at the bottom was only a pale blur. One could scarcely
see the black ribs of wrecked ships, or the spiral towers made
by the burrowings of great eels, or the smooth green-sided monsters
who came by flickering this way and that.</p>

<p>&mdash;"And, Rachel, if any one wants me, I'm busy till one," said
her father, enforcing his words as he often did, when he spoke
to his daughter, by a smart blow upon the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Until one," he repeated. "And you'll find yourself some employment,
eh? Scales, French, a little German, eh? There's Mr. Pepper who
knows more about separable verbs than any man in Europe, eh?"
and he went off laughing. Rachel laughed, too, as indeed she had
laughed ever since she could remember, without thinking it funny,
but because she admired her father.</p>

<p>But just as she was turning with a view perhaps to finding some
employment, she was intercepted by a woman who was so broad and
so thick that to be intercepted by her was inevitable. The discreet
tentative way in which she moved, together with her sober black
dress, showed that she belonged to the lower orders; nevertheless
she took up a rock-like position, looking about her to see that
no gentry were near before she delivered her message, which had
reference to the state of the sheets, and was of the utmost gravity.</p>

<p>"How ever we're to get through this voyage, Miss Rachel, I really
can't tell," she began with a shake of her head. "There's only
just sheets enough to go round, and the master's has a rotten
place you could put your fingers through. And the counterpanes.
Did you notice the counterpanes? I thought to myself a poor person
would have been ashamed of them. The one I gave Mr. Pepper was
hardly fit to cover a dog. . . . No, Miss Rachel, they could <em>not</em>
be mended; they're only fit for dust sheets. Why, if one sewed
one's finger to the bone, one would have one's work undone the
next time they went to the laundry."</p>

<p>Her voice in its indignation wavered as if tears were near.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to descend and inspect a large pile
of linen heaped upon a table. Mrs. Chailey handled the sheets
as if she knew each by name, character, and constitution. Some
had yellow stains, others had places where the threads made long
ladders; but to the ordinary eye they looked much as sheets usually
do look, very chill, white, cold, and irreproachably clean.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Chailey, turning from the subject of sheets, dismissing
them entirely, clenched her fists on the top of them, and proclaimed,
"And you couldn't ask a living creature to sit where I sit!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Chailey was expected to sit in a cabin which was large enough,
but too near the boilers, so that after five minutes she could
hear her heart "go," she complained, putting her hand above it,
which was a state of things that Mrs. Vinrace, Rachel's mother,
would never have dreamt of inflicting &mdash;Mrs. Vinrace, who
knew every sheet in her house, and expected of every one the best
they could do, but no more.</p>

<p>It was the easiest thing in the world to grant another room,
and the problem of sheets simultaneously and miraculously solved
itself, the spots and ladders not being past cure after all, but&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lies! Lies! Lies!" exclaimed the mistress indignantly, as she
ran up on to the deck. "What's the use of telling me lies?"</p>

<p>In her anger that a woman of fifty should behave like a child
and come cringing to a girl because she wanted to sit where she
had not leave to sit, she did not think of the particular case,
and, unpacking her music, soon forgot all about the old woman
and her sheets.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chailey folded her sheets, but her expression testified
to flatness within. The world no longer cared about her, and a
ship was not a home. When the lamps were lit yesterday, and the
sailors went tumbling above her head, she had cried; she would
cry this evening; she would cry to-morrow. It was not home. Meanwhile
she arranged her ornaments in the room which she had won too easily.
They were strange ornaments to bring on a sea voyage&mdash;china pugs,
tea-sets in miniature, cups stamped floridly with the arms of
the city of Bristol, hair-pin boxes crusted with shamrock, antelopes'
heads in coloured plaster, together with a multitude of tiny photographs,
representing downright workmen in their Sunday best, and women
holding white babies. But there was one portrait in a gilt frame,
for which a nail was needed, and before she sought it Mrs. Chailey
put on her spectacles and read what was written on a slip of paper
at the back:</p>

<p>"This picture of her mistress is given to Emma Chailey by Willoughby
Vinrace in gratitude for thirty years of devoted service."</p>

<p>Tears obliterated the words and the head of the nail.</p>

<p>"So long as I can do something for your family," she was saying,
as she hammered at it, when a voice called melodiously in the
passage:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Chailey! Mrs. Chailey!"</p>

<p>Chailey instantly tidied her dress, composed her face, and opened
the door.</p>

<p>"I'm in a fix," said Mrs. Ambrose, who was flushed and out of
breath. "You know what gentlemen are. The chairs too high&mdash;the
tables too low&mdash;there's six inches between the floor and the door.
What I want's a hammer, an old quilt, and have you such a thing
as a kitchen table? Anyhow, between us"&mdash;she now flung open the
door of her husband's sitting room, and revealed Ridley pacing
up and down, his forehead all wrinkled, and the collar of his
coat turned up.</p>

<p>"It's as though they'd taken pains to torment me!" he cried,
stopping dead. "Did I come on this voyage in order to catch rheumatism
and pneumonia? Really one might have credited Vinrace with more
sense. My dear," Helen was on her knees under a table, "you are
only making yourself untidy, and we had much better recognise
the fact that we are condemned to six weeks of unspeakable misery.
To come at all was the height of folly, but now that we are here
I suppose that I can face it like a man. My diseases of course
will be increased &mdash;I feel already worse than I did yesterday,
but we've only ourselves to thank, and the children happily&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Move! Move! Move!" cried Helen, chasing him from corner to corner
with a chair as though he were an errant hen. "Out of the way,
Ridley, and in half an hour you'll find it ready."</p>

<p>She turned him out of the room, and they could hear him groaning
and swearing as he went along the passage.</p>

<p>"I daresay he isn't very strong," said Mrs. Chailey, looking
at Mrs. Ambrose compassionately, as she helped to shift and carry.</p>

<p>"It's books," sighed Helen, lifting an armful of sad volumes
from the floor to the shelf. "Greek from morning to night. If
ever Miss Rachel marries, Chailey, pray that she may marry a man
who doesn't know his <em>ABC</em>."</p>

<p>The preliminary discomforts and harshnesses, which generally
make the first days of a sea voyage so cheerless and trying to
the temper, being somehow lived through, the succeeding days passed
pleasantly enough. October was well advanced, but steadily burning
with a warmth that made the early months of the summer appear
very young and capricious. Great tracts of the earth lay now beneath
the autumn sun, and the whole of England, from the bald moors
to the Cornish rocks, was lit up from dawn to sunset, and showed
in stretches of yellow, green, and purple. Under that illumination
even the roofs of the great towns glittered. In thousands of small
gardens, millions of dark-red flowers were blooming, until the
old ladies who had tended them so carefully came down the paths
with their scissors, snipped through their juicy stalks, and laid
them upon cold stone ledges in the village church. Innumerable
parties of picnickers coming home at sunset cried, "Was there
ever such a day as this?" "It's you," the young men whispered;
"Oh, it's you," the young women replied. All old people and many
sick people were drawn, were it only for a foot or two, into the
open air, and prognosticated pleasant things about the course
of the world. As for the confidences and expressions of love that
were heard not only in cornfields but in lamplit rooms, where
the windows opened on the garden, and men with cigars kissed women
with grey hairs, they were not to be counted. Some said that the
sky was an emblem of the life to come. Long-tailed birds clattered
and screamed, and crossed from wood to wood, with golden eyes
in their plumage.</p>

<p>But while all this went on by land, very few people thought about
the sea. They took it for granted that the sea was calm; and there
was no need, as there is in many houses when the creeper taps
on the bedroom windows, for the couples to murmur before they
kiss, "Think of the ships to-night," or "Thank Heaven, I'm not
the man in the lighthouse!" For all they imagined, the ships when
they vanished on the sky-line dissolved, like snow in water. The
grown-up view, indeed, was not much clearer than the view of the
little creatures in bathing drawers who were trotting in to the
foam all along the coasts of England, and scooping up buckets
full of water. They saw white sails or tufts of smoke pass across
the horizon, and if you had said that these were waterspouts,
or the petals of white sea flowers, they would have agreed.</p>

<p>The people in ships, however, took an equally singular view of
England. Not only did it appear to them to be an island, and a
very small island, but it was a shrinking island in which people
were imprisoned. One figured them first swarming about like aimless
ants, and almost pressing each other over the edge; and then,
as the ship withdrew, one figured them making a vain clamour,
which, being unheard, either ceased, or rose into a brawl. Finally,
when the ship was out of sight of land, it became plain that the
people of England were completely mute. The disease attacked other
parts of the earth; Europe shrank, Asia shrank, Africa and America
shrank, until it seemed doubtful whether the ship would ever run
against any of those wrinkled little rocks again. But, on the
other hand, an immense dignity had descended upon her; she was
an inhabitant of the great world, which has so few inhabitants,
travelling all day across an empty universe, with veils drawn
before her and behind. She was more lonely than the caravan crossing
the desert; she was infinitely more mysterious, moving by her
own power and sustained by her own resources. The sea might give
her death or some unexampled joy, and none would know of it. She
was a bride going forth to her husband, a virgin unknown of men;
in her vigor and purity she might be likened to all beautiful
things, for as a ship she had a life of her own.</p>

<p>Indeed if they had not been blessed in their weather, one blue
day being bowled up after another, smooth, round, and flawless.
Mrs. Ambrose would have found it very dull. As it was, she had
her embroidery frame set up on deck, with a little table by her
side on which lay open a black volume of philosophy. She chose
a thread from the vari-coloured tangle that lay in her lap, and
sewed red into the bark of a tree, or yellow into the river torrent.
She was working at a great design of a tropical river running
through a tropical forest, where spotted deer would eventually
browse upon masses of fruit, bananas, oranges, and giant pomegranates,
while a troop of naked natives whirled darts into the air. Between
the stitches she looked to one side and read a sentence about
the Reality of Matter, or the Nature of Good. Round her men in
blue jerseys knelt and scrubbed the boards, or leant over the
rails and whistled, and not far off Mr. Pepper sat cutting up
roots with a penknife. The rest were occupied in other parts of
the ship: Ridley at his Greek&mdash;he had never found quarters more
to his liking; Willoughby at his documents, for he used a voyage
to work off arrears of business; and Rachel &mdash;Helen, between
her sentences of philosophy, wondered sometimes what Rachel <em>did</em>
do with herself? She meant vaguely to go and see. They had scarcely
spoken two words to each other since that first evening; they
were polite when they met, but there had been no confidence of
any kind. Rachel seemed to get on very well with her father&mdash;much
better, Helen thought, than she ought to&mdash;and was as ready to
let Helen alone as Helen was to let her alone.</p>

<p>At that moment Rachel was sitting in her room doing absolutely
nothing. When the ship was full this apartment bore some magnificent
title and was the resort of elderly sea-sick ladies who left the
deck to their youngsters. By virtue of the piano, and a mess of
books on the floor, Rachel considered it her room, and there she
would sit for hours playing very difficult music, reading a little
German, or a little English when the mood took her, and doing&mdash;as
at this moment&mdash;absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>The way she had been educated, joined to a fine natural indolence,
was of course partly the reason of it, for she had been educated
as the majority of well-to-do girls in the last part of the nineteenth
century were educated. Kindly doctors and gentle old professors
had taught her the rudiments of about ten different branches of
knowledge, but they would as soon have forced her to go through
one piece of drudgery thoroughly as they would have told her that
her hands were dirty. The one hour or the two hours weekly passed
very pleasantly, partly owing to the other pupils, partly to the
fact that the window looked upon the back of a shop, where figures
appeared against the red windows in winter, partly to the accidents
that are bound to happen when more than two people are in the
same room together. But there was no subject in the world which
she knew accurately. Her mind was in the state of an intelligent
man's in the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth; she would
believe practically anything she was told, invent reasons for
anything she said. The shape of the earth, the history of the
world, how trains worked, or money was invested, what laws were
in force, which people wanted what, and why they wanted it, the
most elementary idea of a system in modern life&mdash;none of this
had been imparted to her by any of her professors or mistresses.
But this system of education had one great advantage. It did not
teach anything, but it put no obstacle in the way of any real
talent that the pupil might chance to have. Rachel, being musical,
was allowed to learn nothing but music; she became a fanatic about
music. All the energies that might have gone into languages, science,
or literature, that might have made her friends, or shown her
the world, poured straight into music. Finding her teachers inadequate,
she had practically taught herself. At the age of twenty-four
she knew as much about music as most people do when they are thirty;
and could play as well as nature allowed her to, which, as became
daily more obvious, was a really generous allowance. If this one
definite gift was surrounded by dreams and ideas of the most extravagant
and foolish description, no one was any the wiser.</p>

<p>Her education being thus ordinary, her circumstances were no
more out of the common. She was an only child and had never been
bullied and laughed at by brothers and sisters. Her mother having
died when she was eleven, two aunts, the sisters of her father,
brought her up, and they lived for the sake of the air in a comfortable
house in Richmond. She was of course brought up with excessive
care, which as a child was for her health; as a girl and a young
woman was for what it seems almost crude to call her morals. Until
quite lately she had been completely ignorant that for women such
things existed. She groped for knowledge in old books, and found
it in repulsive chunks, but she did not naturally care for books
and thus never troubled her head about the censorship which was
exercised first by her aunts, later by her father. Friends might
have told her things, but she had few of her own age, &mdash;Richmond
being an awkward place to reach,&mdash;and, as it happened, the only
girl she knew well was a religious zealot, who in the fervour
of intimacy talked about God, and the best ways of taking up one's
cross, a topic only fitfully interesting to one whose mind reached
other stages at other times.</p>

<p>But lying in her chair, with one hand behind her head, the other
grasping the knob on the arm, she was clearly following her thoughts
intently. Her education left her abundant time for thinking. Her
eyes were fixed so steadily upon a ball on the rail of the ship
that she would have been startled and annoyed if anything had
chanced to obscure it for a second. She had begun her meditations
with a shout of laughter, caused by the following translation
from <em>Tristan</em>:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
In shrinking trepidation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His shame he seems to hide<br/>
While to the king his relation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He brings the corpse-like Bride.<br/>
Seems it so senseless what I say?

</p>
</div>
<p>She cried that it did, and threw down the book. Next she had
picked up <em>Cowper's</em> <em>Letters</em>, the classic prescribed
by her father which had bored her, so that one sentence chancing
to say something about the smell of broom in his garden, she had
thereupon seen the little hall at Richmond laden with flowers
on the day of her mother's funeral, smelling so strong that now
any flower-scent brought back the sickly horrible sensation; and
so from one scene she passed, half-hearing, half-seeing, to another.
She saw her Aunt Lucy arranging flowers in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Aunt Lucy," she volunteered, "I don't like the smell of broom;
it reminds me of funerals."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Rachel," Aunt Lucy replied; "don't say such foolish
things, dear. I always think it a particularly cheerful plant."</p>

<p>Lying in the hot sun her mind was fixed upon the characters of
her aunts, their views, and the way they lived. Indeed this was
a subject that lasted her hundreds of morning walks round Richmond
Park, and blotted out the trees and the people and the deer. Why
did they do the things they did, and what did they feel, and what
was it all about? Again she heard Aunt Lucy talking to Aunt Eleanor.
She had been that morning to take up the character of a servant,
"And, of course, at half-past ten in the morning one expects to
find the housemaid brushing the stairs." How odd! How unspeakably
odd! But she could not explain to herself why suddenly as her
aunt spoke the whole system in which they lived had appeared before
her eyes as something quite unfamiliar and inexplicable, and themselves
as chairs or umbrellas dropped about here and there without any
reason. She could only say with her slight stammer, "Are you f-f-fond
of Aunt Eleanor, Aunt Lucy?" to which her aunt replied, with her
nervous hen-like twitter of a laugh, "My dear child, what questions
you do ask!"</p>

<p>"How fond? Very fond!" Rachel pursued.</p>

<p>"I can't say I've ever thought 'how,'" said Miss Vinrace. "If
one cares one doesn't think 'how,' Rachel," which was aimed at
the niece who had never yet "come" to her aunts as cordially as
they wished.</p>

<p>"But you know I care for you, don't you, dear, because you're
your mother's daughter, if for no other reason, and there <em>are</em>
plenty of other reasons"&mdash;and she leant over and kissed her with
some emotion, and the argument was spilt irretrievably about the
place like a bucket of milk.</p>

<p>By these means Rachel reached that stage in thinking, if thinking
it can be called, when the eyes are intent upon a ball or a knob
and the lips cease to move. Her efforts to come to an understanding
had only hurt her aunt's feelings, and the conclusion must be
that it is better not to try. To feel anything strongly was to
create an abyss between oneself and others who feel strongly perhaps
but differently. It was far better to play the piano and forget
all the rest. The conclusion was very welcome. Let these odd men
and women&mdash;her aunts, the Hunts, Ridley, Helen, Mr. Pepper, and
the rest&mdash;be symbols,&mdash;featureless but dignified, symbols of age,
of youth, of motherhood, of learning, and beautiful often as people
upon the stage are beautiful. It appeared that nobody ever said
a thing they meant, or ever talked of a feeling they felt, but
that was what music was for. Reality dwelling in what one saw
and felt, but did not talk about, one could accept a system in
which things went round and round quite satisfactorily to other
people, without often troubling to think about it, except as something
superficially strange. Absorbed by her music she accepted her
lot very complacently, blazing into indignation perhaps once a
fortnight, and subsiding as she subsided now. Inextricably mixed
in dreamy confusion, her mind seemed to enter into communion,
to be delightfully expanded and combined with the spirit of the
whitish boards on deck, with the spirit of the sea, with the spirit
of Beethoven Op. 112, even with the spirit of poor William Cowper
there at Olney. Like a ball of thistledown it kissed the sea,
rose, kissed it again, and thus rising and kissing passed finally
out of sight. The rising and falling of the ball of thistledown
was represented by the sudden droop forward of her own head, and
when it passed out of sight she was asleep.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Mrs. Ambrose opened the door and looked at
her. It did not surprise her to find that this was the way in
which Rachel passed her mornings. She glanced round the room at
the piano, at the books, at the general mess. In the first place
she considered Rachel aesthetically; lying unprotected she looked
somehow like a victim dropped from the claws of a bird of prey,
but considered as a woman, a young woman of twenty-four, the sight
gave rise to reflections. Mrs. Ambrose stood thinking for at least
two minutes. She then smiled, turned noiselessly away and went,
lest the sleeper should waken, and there should be the awkwardness
of speech between them.</p>
