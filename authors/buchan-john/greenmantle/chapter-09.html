<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Before I turned in that evening I had done some good hours’ work
in the engine-room. The boat was oil-fired, and in very fair order,
so my duties did not look as if they would be heavy. There was
nobody who could be properly called an engineer; only, besides
the furnace-men, a couple of lads from Hamburg who had been a
year ago apprentices in a ship-building yard. They were civil
fellows, both of them consumptive, who did what I told them and
said little. By bedtime, if you had seen me in my blue jumper,
a pair of carpet slippers, and a flat cap—all the property of
the deceased Walter—you would have sworn I had been bred to the
firing of river-boats, whereas I had acquired most of my knowledge
on one run down the Zambesi, when the proper engineer got drunk
and fell overboard among the crocodiles.</p>

<p>The captain—they called him Schenk—was out of his bearings in
the job. He was a Frisian and a first-class deep-water seaman,
but, since he knew the Rhine delta, and because the German mercantile
marine was laid on the ice till the end of war, they had turned
him on to this show. He was bored by the business, and didn’t
understand it very well. The river charts puzzled him, and though
it was pretty plain going for hundreds of miles, yet he was in
a perpetual fidget about the pilotage. You could see that he would
have been far more in his element smelling his way through the
shoals of the Ems mouth, or beating against a northeaster in the
shallow Baltic. He had six barges in tow, but the heavy flood
of the Danube made it an easy job except when it came to going
slow. There were two men on each barge, who came aboard every
morning to draw rations. That was a funny business, for we never
lay to if we could help it. There was a dinghy belonging to each
barge, and the men used to row to the next and get a lift in that
barge’s dinghy, and so forth. Six men would appear in the dinghy
of the barge nearest us and carry off supplies for the rest. The
men were mostly Frisians, slow-spoken, sandy-haired lads, very
like the breed you strike on the Essex coast.</p>

<p>It was the fact that Schenk was really a deep-water sailor, and
so a novice to the job, that made me get on with him. He was a
good fellow and quite willing to take a hint, so before I had
been twenty-four hours on board he was telling me all his difficulties,
and I was doing my best to cheer him. And difficulties came thick,
because the next night was New Year’s Eve.</p>

<p>I knew that that night was a season of gaiety in Scotland, but
Scotland wasn’t in it with the Fatherland. Even Schenk, though
he was in charge of valuable stores and was voyaging against time,
was quite clear that the men must have permission for some kind
of beano. Just before darkness we came abreast a fair-sized town,
whose name I never discovered, and decided to lie to for the night.
The arrangement was that one man should be left on guard in each
barge, and the other get four hours’ leave ashore. Then he would
return and relieve his friend, who should proceed to do the same
thing. I foresaw that there would be some fun when the first batch
returned, but I did not dare to protest. I was desperately anxious
to get past the Austrian frontier, for I had a half-notion we
might be searched there, but Schenk took his <em>Sylvesterabend</em>
business so seriously that I would have risked a row if I had
tried to argue.</p>

<p>The upshot was what I expected. We got the first batch aboard
about midnight, blind to the world, and the others straggled in
at all hours next morning. I stuck to the boat for obvious reasons,
but next day it became too serious, and I had to go ashore with
the captain to try and round up the stragglers. We got them all
in but two, and I am inclined to think these two had never meant
to come back. If I had a soft job like a river-boat I shouldn’t
be inclined to run away in the middle of Germany with the certainty
that my best fate would be to be scooped up for the trenches,
but your Frisian has no more imagination than a haddock. The absentees
were both watchmen from the barges, and I fancy the monotony of
the life had got on their nerves.</p>

<p>The captain was in a raging temper, for he was short-handed to
begin with. He would have started a press-gang, but there was
no superfluity of men in that township: nothing but boys and grandfathers.
As I was helping to run the trip I was pretty annoyed also, and
I sluiced down the drunkards with icy Danube water, using all
the worst language I knew in Dutch and German. It was a raw morning,
and as we raged through the river-side streets I remember I heard
the dry crackle of wild geese going overhead, and wished I could
get a shot at them. I told one fellow—he was the most troublesome—that
he was a disgrace to a great Empire, and was only fit to fight
with the filthy English.</p>

<p>"God in Heaven!" said the captain, "we can delay no longer. We
must make shift the best we can. I can spare one man from the
deck hands, and you must give up one from the engine-room."</p>

<p>That was arranged, and we were tearing back rather short in the
wind when I espied a figure sitting on a bench beside the booking-office
on the pier. It was a slim figure, in an old suit of khaki: some
cast-off duds which had long lost the semblance of a uniform.
It had a gentle face, and was smoking peacefully, looking out
upon the river and the boats and us noisy fellows with meek philosophical
eyes. If I had seen General French sitting there and looking like
nothing on earth I couldn’t have been more surprised.</p>

<p>The man stared at me without recognition. He was waiting for
his cue.</p>

<p>I spoke rapidly in Sesutu, for I was afraid the captain might
know Dutch.</p>

<p>"Where have you come from?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They shut me up in <em>tronk</em>," said Peter, "and I ran away.
I am tired, Cornelis, and want to continue the journey by boat."</p>

<p>"Remember you have worked for me in Africa," I said. "You are
just home from Damaraland. You are a German who has lived thirty
years away from home. You can tend a furnace and have worked in
mines."</p>

<p>Then I spoke to the captain.</p>

<p>"Here is a fellow who used to be in my employ, Captain Schenk.
It’s almighty luck we’ve struck him. He’s old, and not very strong
in the head, but I’ll go bail he’s a good worker. He says he’ll
come with us and I can use him in the engine-room."</p>

<p>"Stand up," said the Captain.</p>

<p>Peter stood up, light and slim and wiry as a leopard. A sailor
does not judge men by girth and weight.</p>

<p>"He’ll do," said Schenk, and the next minute he was readjusting
his crews and giving the strayed revellers the rough side of his
tongue. As it chanced, I couldn’t keep Peter with me, but had
to send him to one of the barges, and I had time for no more than
five words with him, when I told him to hold his tongue and live
up to his reputation as a half-wit. That accursed <em>Sylvesterabend</em>
had played havoc with the whole outfit, and the captain and I
were weary men before we got things straight.</p>

<p>In one way it turned out well. That afternoon we passed the frontier
and I never knew it till I saw a man in a strange uniform come
aboard, who copied some figures on a schedule, and brought us
a mail. With my dirty face and general air of absorption in duty,
I must have been an unsuspicious figure. He took down the names
of the men in the barges, and Peter’s name was given as it appeared
on the ship’s roll—Anton Blum.</p>

<p>"You must feel it strange, Herr Brandt," said the captain, "to
be scrutinized by a policeman, you who give orders, I doubt not,
to many policemen."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. "It is my profession. It is my business
to go unrecognized often by my own servants." I could see that
I was becoming rather a figure in the captain’s eyes. He liked
the way I kept the men up to their work, for I hadn’t been a nigger-driver
for nothing.</p>

<p>Late on that Sunday night we passed through a great city which
the captain told me was Vienna. It seemed to last for miles and
miles, and to be as brightly lit as a circus. After that, we were
in big plains and the air grew perishing cold. Peter had come
aboard once for his rations, but usually he left it to his partner,
for he was lying very low. But one morning—I think it was the
5th of January, when we had passed Buda and were moving through
great sodden flats just sprinkled with snow—the captain took it
into his head to get me to overhaul the barge loads. Armed with
a mighty type-written list, I made a tour of the barges, beginning
with the hindmost. There was a fine old stock of deadly weapons—mostly
machine-guns and some field-pieces, and enough shells to blow
up the Gallipoli peninsula. All kinds of shell were there, from
the big 14-inch crumps to rifle grenades and trench-mortars. It
made me fairly sick to see all these good things preparing for
our own fellows, and I wondered whether I would not be doing my
best service if I engineered a big explosion. Happily I had the
common sense to remember my job and my duty and to stick to it.</p>

<p>Peter was in the middle of the convoy, and I found him pretty
unhappy, principally through not being allowed to smoke. His companion
was an ox-eyed lad, whom I ordered to the look-out while Peter
and I went over the lists.</p>

<p>"Cornelis, my old friend," he said, "there are some pretty toys
here. With a spanner and a couple of clear hours I could make
these maxims about as deadly as bicycles. What do you say to a
try?"</p>

<p>"I’ve considered that," I said, "but it won’t do. We’re on a
bigger business than wrecking munition convoys. I want to know
how you got here."</p>

<p>He smiled with that extraordinary Sunday-school docility of his.</p>

<p>"It was very simple, Cornelis. I was foolish in the cafe—but
they have told you of that. You see I was angry and did not reflect.
They had separated us, and I could see would treat me as dirt.
Therefore, my bad temper came out, for, as I have told you, I
do not like Germans."</p>

<p>Peter gazed lovingly at the little bleak farms which dotted the
Hungarian plain.</p>

<p>"All night I lay in <em>tronk</em> with no food. In the morning
they fed me, and took me hundreds of miles in a train to a place
which I think is called Neuburg. It was a great prison, full of
English officers ... I asked myself many times on the journey
what was the reason of this treatment, for I could see no sense
in it. If they wanted to punish me for insulting them they had
the chance to send me off to the trenches. No one could have objected.
If they thought me useless they could have turned me back to Holland.
I could not have stopped them. But they treated me as if I were
a dangerous man, whereas all their conduct hitherto had shown
that they thought me a fool. I could not understand it.</p>

<p>"But I had not been one night in that Neuburg place before I
thought of the reason. They wanted to keep me under observation
as a check upon you, Cornelis. I figured it out this way. They
had given you some very important work which required them to
let you into some big secret. So far, good. They evidently thought
much of you, even yon Stumm man, though he was as rude as a buffalo.
But they did not know you fully, and they wanted to check on you.
That check they found in Peter Pienaar. Peter was a fool, and
if there was anything to blab, sooner or later Peter would blab
it. Then they would stretch out a long arm and nip you short,
wherever you were. Therefore they must keep old Peter under their
eye."</p>

<p>"That sounds likely enough," I said.</p>

<p>"It was God’s truth," said Peter. "And when it was all clear
to me I settled that I must escape. Partly because I am a free
man and do not like to be in prison, but mostly because I was
not sure of myself. Some day my temper would go again, and I might
say foolish things for which Cornelis would suffer. So it was
very certain that I must escape.</p>

<p>"Now, Cornelis, I noticed pretty soon that there were two kinds
among the prisoners. There were the real prisoners, mostly English
and French, and there were humbugs. The humbugs were treated,
apparently, like the others, but not really, as I soon perceived.
There was one man who passed as an English officer, another as
a French Canadian, and the others called themselves Russians.
None of the honest men suspected them, but they were there as
spies to hatch plots for escape and get the poor devils caught
in the act, and to worm out confidences which might be of value.
That is the German notion of good business. I am not a British
soldier to think all men are gentlemen. I know that amongst men
there are desperate <em>skellums</em>, so I soon picked up this
game. It made me very angry, but it was a good thing for my plan.
I made my resolution to escape the day I arrived at Neuburg, and
on Christmas Day I had a plan made."</p>

<p>"Peter, you’re an old marvel. Do you mean to say you were quite
certain of getting away whenever you wanted?"</p>

<p>"Quite certain, Cornelis. You see, I have been wicked in my time
and know something about the inside of prisons. You may build
them like great castles, or they may be like a backveld <em>tronk</em>,
only mud and corrugated iron, but there is always a key and a
man who keeps it, and that man can be bested. I knew I could get
away, but I did not think it would be so easy. That was due to
the bogus prisoners, my friends, the spies.</p>

<p>"I made great pals with them. On Christmas night we were very
jolly together. I think I spotted every one of them the first
day. I bragged about my past and all I had done, and I told them
I was going to escape. They backed me up and promised to help.
Next morning I had a plan. In the afternoon, just after dinner,
I had to go to the commandant’s room. They treated me a little
differently from the others, for I was not a prisoner of war,
and I went there to be asked questions and to be cursed as a stupid
Dutchman. There was no strict guard kept there, for the place
was on the second floor, and distant by many yards from any staircase.
In the corridor outside the commandant’s room there was a window
which had no bars, and four feet from the window the limb of a
great tree. A man might reach that limb, and if he were active
as a monkey might descend to the ground. Beyond that I knew nothing,
but I am a good climber, Cornelis.</p>

<p>"I told the others of my plan. They said it was good, but no
one offered to come with me. They were very noble; they declared
that the scheme was mine and I should have the fruit of it, for
if more than one tried, detection was certain. I agreed and thanked
them—thanked them with tears in my eyes. Then one of them very
secretly produced a map. We planned out my road, for I was going
straight to Holland. It was a long road, and I had no money, for
they had taken all my sovereigns when I was arrested, but they
promised to get a subscription up among themselves to start me.
Again I wept tears of gratitude. This was on Sunday, the day after
Christmas, and I settled to make the attempt on the Wednesday
afternoon.</p>

<p>"Now, Cornelis, when the lieutenant took us to see the British
prisoners, you remember, he told us many things about the ways
of prisons. He told us how they loved to catch a man in the act
of escape, so that they could use him harshly with a clear conscience.
I thought of that, and calculated that now my friends would have
told everything to the commandant, and that they would be waiting
to bottle me on the Wednesday. Till then I reckoned I would be
slackly guarded, for they would look on me as safe in the net
...</p>

<p>"So I went out of the window next day. It was the Monday afternoon
..."</p>

<p>"That was a bold stroke," I said admiringly.</p>

<p>"The plan was bold, but it was not skilful," said Peter modestly.
"I had no money beyond seven marks, and I had but one stick of
chocolate. I had no overcoat, and it was snowing hard. Further,
I could not get down the tree, which had a trunk as smooth and
branchless as a blue gum. For a little I thought I should be compelled
to give in, and I was not happy.</p>

<p>"But I had leisure, for I did not think I would be missed before
nightfall, and given time a man can do most things. By and by
I found a branch which led beyond the outer wall of the yard and
hung above the river. This I followed, and then dropped from it
into the stream. It was a drop of some yards, and the water was
very swift, so that I nearly drowned. I would rather swim the
Limpopo, Cornelis, among all the crocodiles than that icy river.
Yet I managed to reach the shore and get my breath lying in the
bushes ...</p>

<p>"After that it was plain going, though I was very cold. I knew
that I would be sought on the northern roads, as I had told my
friends, for no one could dream of an ignorant Dutchman going
south away from his kinsfolk. But I had learned enough from the
map to know that our road lay south-east, and I had marked this
big river."</p>

<p>"Did you hope to pick me up?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, Cornelis. I thought you would be travelling in first-class
carriages while I should be plodding on foot. But I was set on
getting to the place you spoke of (how do you call it? Constant
Nople?), where our big business lay. I thought I might be in time
for that."</p>

<p>"You’re an old Trojan, Peter," I said; "but go on. How did you
get to that landing-stage where I found you?"</p>

<p>"It was a hard journey," he said meditatively. "It was not easy
to get beyond the barbed-wire entanglements which surrounded Neuburg—yes,
even across the river. But in time I reached the woods and was
safe, for I did not think any German could equal me in wild country.
The best of them, even their foresters, are but babes in veldcraft
compared with such as me ... My troubles came only from hunger
and cold. Then I met a Peruvian smouse[1], and sold him my clothes
and bought from him these. I did not want to part with my own,
which were better, but he gave me ten marks on the deal. After
that I went into a village and ate heavily."</p>

<p> [1] Peter meant a Polish-Jew pedlar.</p>

<p>"Were you pursued?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I do not think so. They had gone north, as I expected, and were
looking for me at the railway stations which my friends had marked
for me. I walked happily and put a bold face on it. If I saw a
man or woman look at me suspiciously I went up to them at once
and talked. I told a sad tale, and all believed it. I was a poor
Dutchman travelling home on foot to see a dying mother, and I
had been told that by the Danube I should find the main railway
to take me to Holland. There were kind people who gave me food,
and one woman gave me half a mark, and wished me God speed ...
Then on the last day of the year I came to the river and found
many drunkards."</p>

<p>"Was that when you resolved to get on one of the river-boats?"</p>

<p>"<em>Ja</em>, Cornelis. As soon as I heard of the boats I saw
where my chance lay. But you might have knocked me over with a
straw when I saw you come on shore. That was good fortune, my
friend... I have been thinking much about the Germans, and I will
tell you the truth. It is only boldness that can baffle them.
They are a most diligent people. They will think of all likely
difficulties, but not of all possible ones. They have not much
imagination. They are like steam engines which must keep to prepared
tracks. There they will hunt any man down, but let him trek for
open country and they will be at a loss. Therefore boldness, my
friend; for ever boldness. Remember as a nation they wear spectacles,
which means that they are always peering."</p>

<p>Peter broke off to gloat over the wedges of geese and the strings
of wild swans that were always winging across those plains. His
tale had bucked me up wonderfully. Our luck had held beyond all
belief, and I had a kind of hope in the business now which had
been wanting before. That afternoon, too, I got another fillip.
I came on deck for a breath of air and found it pretty cold after
the heat of the engine-room. So I called to one of the deck hands
to fetch me up my cloak from the cabin—the same I had bought that
first morning in the Greif village.</p>

<p>"<em>Der grune Mantel</em>?" the man shouted up, and I cried,
"Yes". But the words seemed to echo in my ears, and long after
he had given me the garment I stood staring abstractedly over
the bulwarks.</p>

<p>His tone had awakened a chord of memory, or, to be accurate,
they had given emphasis to what before had been only blurred and
vague. For he had spoken the words which Stumm had uttered behind
his hand to Gaudian. I had heard something like "Ühnmantl," and
could make nothing of it. Now I was as certain of those words
as of my own existence. They had been "<em>Grune Mantel</em>".
<em>Grune Mantel</em>, whatever it might be, was the name which
Stumm had not meant me to hear, which was some talisman for the
task I had proposed, and which was connected in some way with
the mysterious von Einem.</p>

<p>This discovery put me in high fettle. I told myself that, considering
the difficulties, I had managed to find out a wonderful amount
in a very few days. It only shows what a man can do with the slenderest
evidence if he keeps chewing and chewing on it ...</p>

<p>Two mornings later we lay alongside the quays at Belgrade, and
I took the opportunity of stretching my legs. Peter had come ashore
for a smoke, and we wandered among the battered riverside streets,
and looked at the broken arches of the great railway bridge which
the Germans were working at like beavers. There was a big temporary
pontoon affair to take the railway across, but I calculated that
the main bridge would be ready inside a month. It was a clear,
cold, blue day, and as one looked south one saw ridge after ridge
of snowy hills. The upper streets of the city were still fairly
whole, and there were shops open where food could be got. I remember
hearing English spoken, and seeing some Red Cross nurses in the
custody of Austrian soldiers coming from the railway station.</p>

<p>It would have done me a lot of good to have had a word with them.
I thought of the gallant people whose capital this had been, how
three times they had flung the Austrians back over the Danube,
and then had only been beaten by the black treachery of their
so-called allies. Somehow that morning in Belgrade gave both Peter
and me a new purpose in our task. It was our business to put a
spoke in the wheel of this monstrous bloody Juggernaut that was
crushing the life out of the little heroic nations.</p>

<p>We were just getting ready to cast off when a distinguished party
arrived at the quay. There were all kinds of uniforms—German,
Austrian, and Bulgarian, and amid them one stout gentleman in
a fur coat and a black felt hat. They watched the barges up-anchor,
and before we began to jerk into line I could hear their conversation.
The fur coat was talking English.</p>

<p>"I reckon that’s pretty good noos, General," it said; "if the
English have run away from Gally-poly we can use these noo consignments
for the bigger game. I guess it won’t be long before we see the
British lion moving out of Egypt with sore paws."</p>

<p>They all laughed. "The privilege of that spectacle may soon be
ours," was the reply.</p>

<p>I did not pay much attention to the talk; indeed I did not realize
till weeks later that that was the first tidings of the great
evacuation of Cape Helles. What rejoiced me was the sight of Blenkiron,
as bland as a barber among those swells. Here were two of the
missionaries within reasonable distance of their goal.</p>
