<p>All I could do was to stand in the living room doorway and stare at her.
</p><p>There she sat by the fire, in a short blue skirt that showed her little
feet in blue stockings and buckled shoes, and a blue sweater whose
rolling collar fell away from the column of her soft throat. And she was
just exactly what I had known she would be! There was a gold crest to
every exquisite, warm wave of her bronze hair; her level eyebrows were
about five shades darker, and her curled-up eye-lashes darker still,
where she sat with her head bent over some sort of sewing. And even
before she looked up and I saw her eyes, the beauty of her caught me at
my heart. I had never thought even my dream girl could be as lovely as
she was. But there was more to her face than beauty. It was so young and
sweet and gay, and--when you looked hard at her--so sad, that I forgot I
ought either to speak up or go away. Of who she was or how she came to
be at La Chance, I had no earthly clue. I knew, of course, that it was
she who had met me at the landing, and common sense told me she had
taken me for some one else: but I had no desire to say so, or to go away
either. And suddenly she looked up and saw me.
</p><p>Whoever she was she had good nerves, for she never even stared as women
do at a strange man. I could have been no reassuring vision either,
standing there in moccasined feet that had come in on her as silently as
a wolf or an Indian; with dirty, frozen clothes; and a face that the
Lord knows is dark and hard at its best, and must have been forbidding
enough that night between dirt and fatigue. But that girl only glanced
at me as quietly as if she had known I was there.
</p><p>"Did you----Were you looking for any one?" she asked. And the second I
heard her voice I knew she guessed she had spoken to me a quarter of an
hour ago in words she would probably have given all she possessed to
prevent a stranger from knowing she had need to speak to any one.
</p><p>Only that was not the reason I half stammered, "Not exactly." It was
because I could see her eyes,--and they were like sapphires, and the
sea, and the night sky with the first stars in it. I snatched off my cap
that I had forgotten, and bits of melting ice fell off it and tinkled
on the floor. The sharp little sound brought my wits back to me. Perhaps
I had never really thought my dream girl would come true, but once I had
found her I never meant to lose her. And I knew, if I cared a straw for
my life and the love that was to be in it, that I must meet her now <u>for
the first time</u>; that nothing, not even if she told me so herself, must
make me admit she had come to me at the lake by mistake, or that I had
ever heard her voice before.
</p><p>I said, easily enough, "I'm afraid I startled you. I'm Stretton,
Wilbraham's partner"--which I was to the extent of a thousand
dollars--"I've just come home."
</p><p>And crazy as it sounds, I felt as if I had come home, for the first time
in my life. For the girl of my dreams came to her feet with just that
lovely, controlled ease you see in Pavlova, and with the prettiest
little gesture of welcome.
</p><p>"Oh, you're frozen stiff," she said with a kind of dismayed sympathy.
"And I heard Mr. Wilbraham say some one had forgotten to send out your
horse for you, and that you'd probably walk--the whole way from
Caraquet! You must be tired to death. Please come to the fire and get
warm--now you've come home!"
</p><p>I thought of the queer smell that clung to my stained old coat and the
company I had kept at Skunk's Misery--though if I had guessed what that
wretched boy was going to mean to me I might have grudged my contact
with him less--and I would not have gone near my dream girl for a
fortune. "I think I'll get clean first," I began, and found myself
laughing for the first time in a week. But as I turned away I glanced
back from the dark passage where Charliet, the French-Canadian cook, was
supposed to keep a lamp and never did, and saw the girl in the living
room look after me,--with a look I had never seen in any girl's eyes, if
I'd seen a hunted man have it.
</p><p>"Gad, she knows I know she met me--and she doesn't mean to say so," I
thought vividly. What the reason was I couldn't see, or whom there could
be at La Chance that such a girl should find it necessary to tell that
she would not have him disgrace her, and that he must go away. It made
me wrathy to think there could be any one she needed to hit out at like
that. But we had a queer lot at the mine, including Dunn and Collins, a
couple of educated boys who had not been educated enough to pass as
mining engineers, and had been kicked out into the world by their
families. It might have been either of those two star failures in the
bunk house. The only person it could not have been was Dudley
Wilbraham; since aside from the fact that she could easily speak to him
in the shack she could not have told him he must go away from his own
mine. Which reminded me I'd never even asked where Dudley was or one
thing about the mine I'd been away from so long.
</p><p>But my dream girl, where no girl had ever been, was the only thing I
could think of. I had meant to get some food and go to bed, but instead
I threw my Skunk's Misery clothes out of the window, and got ready to go
out to supper and see that girl again. Who under heaven she could be was
past me, as well as how she came to be at La Chance. I would have been
scared green lest she was the wife of some man at the mine, only she had
no wedding ring on the slim left hand that had beckoned me to the fire.
Yet, "She can't just be here alone, either, and I'm blessed if I see who
she can have come with," I thought blankly. And I opened my room door
straight on Marcia Wilbraham,--Wilbraham's sister!
</p><p>"<u>Well</u>," I said. It was the only thing that came to me. I knew
immediately, of course, that the girl in the living room must have come
out with Marcia; but it knocked me silly to see Marcia herself at La
Chance. I had known Marcia Wilbraham, as I had known Dudley, ever since
I wore blue serge knickerbockers trimmed with white braid. She never
went anywhere with Dudley. She had money of her own, and she spent it
on Horse Show horses, and traveling around to show them. But here she
stood in front of me, in a forsaken backwoods mine that I should not
have expected even Dudley himself to stay at if I had not known his
reasons.
</p><p>"I don't wonder you say 'well,'" Marcia returned crisply. She was
good-looking in a big way, if you did not mind brown eyes that were too
small for her face and a smile that showed her gums. I had never liked
or disliked her especially, any more than you do any girl about your own
age whom you've always known. "I've been here for three months! I was
very near going home a month ago--but I don't think I'll go now. I
believe I'll try a winter here."
</p><p>"A winter!" I thought of Marcia "trying a winter," and I laughed.
</p><p>"Oh, you needn't throw back your handsome Indian head to grin at me,
Nicky Stretton," said she crossly. "I'm tired of always doing the same
thing. And anyhow, the stable lost money, and I had to sell out!"
</p><p>"But why stay here--with Dudley?" I let out. The two of them had always
fought like cats.
</p><p>"I'm going to do some shooting--and wolf hunting," Marcia smiled the
ugly smile I never could stand. "I'm going to stay, anyhow; so you'll
have to bear it, Nicky!"
</p><p>"I'm--charmed!" I thought like lightning that my dream girl would do
whatever Marcia did, and I blessed my stars she was staying; though I
knew she would be all kinds of a nuisance if she insisted on turning out
to hunt wolves. She was all but dressed for it even then, in a horrid
green divided skirt that made her look like a fat old gentleman. But it
was not Marcia I meant to talk about.
</p><p>"Have you brought the--other girl--to hunt wolves, too?" I inquired, as
we moved on down the passage; there was no upstairs to the shack.
</p><p>"No," said Marcia quite carelessly, if I had not caught the snap in her
eyes. "She's come to hunt Dudley! She's going to marry him."
</p><p>"She's <u>what</u>?" I was suddenly thankful we had left the light from my
open door and that Charliet despised keeping a lamp in the passage. The
bland idea that I had found my dream girl split to bits as if a half-ton
rock had landed on it. For her to be going to marry any one was bad
enough; but <u>Dudley</u>, with his temper, and his drink, and the drugs I
was pretty sure he took! The thing was so unspeakable that I stopped
short in the passage.
</p><p>Marcia Wilbraham stopped short too. "I don't wonder you're knocked
silly," she said. "Here, come out of this; I want to speak to you, and
I may as well do it now!" She pushed me into the office where Dudley did
his accounts--which was his name for sitting drinking all day, and never
speaking to any one--and shut the door. "Look here, Nicky, if you're
thinking that girl is a friend of mine, she isn't! I don't know one
thing about her. Except that this summer I had reason to oblige Dudley,
and one day he came to me--you know he was in New York for nearly two
months----"
</p><p>I nodded. I had not cared where he was, so that he was away from La
Chance, where he and old Thompson would drive a tunnel just where I knew
it was useless.
</p><p>"Well, he came to me in the first of August, and said he was going to
marry a girl called Paulette Brown,--and he wanted me to bring her out
here! Why he didn't marry her straight off and bring her out here
himself, I don't know; he only hummed and hawed when I asked him. But
anyhow, I met Paulette Brown, <u>for the first time</u>, at the station, when
we started up here--she and I and Dudley. And she puzzled me from the
second we got into the Pullman, and I saw her pull off the two veils
she'd worn around her head in the station! And she puzzles me worse
now."
</p><p>"Why?" I might have been puzzled myself, remembering Paulette Brown's
speech to me in the dark, but it was none of Marcia's business.
</p><p>"Because I know I've seen her before," Marcia returned calmly, "only
with no 'Paulette Brown' tacked on to her. I've seen her dance
somewhere, but I can't think <u>where</u>--and that's the first thing that
puzzles me."
</p><p>"I don't see why," I said disagreeably, "considering that every one
dances somewhere all day long just now."
</p><p>"It wasn't that kind of dancing. It was rather--wonderful! And there was
some story tacked on to it," Marcia frowned, "only I can't think what!
And the second thing that puzzles me about Paulette Brown--I tell you,
Nicky, I believe she can't <u>bear</u> Dudley, and that she doesn't want to
marry him!"
</p><p>It was the first decent thing I had heard from her, and I could have
opened my mouth and cheered. But I said, "Then why's she here?"
</p><p>"Just because it suits her for some reason of her own," Marcia was
earnest as I had never seen her. "Nicky, I don't think she's anything in
the world but some sort of an adventuress--only what I can't understand
about her is what she wants of Dudley! It isn't money, for I know he's
tried to make her take it, and she wouldn't. Yet I know, too, that she
hadn't a cent coming up here, and she hasn't now--or even any clothes
but summer things, and a blue sweater she wears all the time. She never
speaks about herself, or where she comes from----"
</p><p>"I don't see why there should be any mystery about that!" It was a lie,
but I might not have seen, if she had not spoken to me incomprehensibly
in the dark. "Dudley probably knows all about her people."
</p><p>"A girl called Paulette Brown doesn't have any people," scornfully.
"Besides, her name isn't Brown, or Paulette--she used to forget to
answer to either of them at first; and if Dudley knows what it really
is, I'm going to know too--before I'm a month older! I tell you I've
seen her before, and I know there was some kind of an ugly story tacked
on to her and her dancing. That, and her real name, are up in the attic
of my brain somewhere, and some day they'll come down!"
</p><p>"Well, they won't concern me," I cut in stolidly. Whoever Paulette Brown
was, if she were going to marry Dudley Wilbraham ten times over, she was
the one girl in the world who belonged to me,--and I was not going to
have her discussed by Marcia behind a shut door.
</p><p>But Marcia's retort was too quick for me. "They may interest you, all
the same, if that girl's what I think she is! Don't make any mistake,
Nicky; she's no chorus girl out of work. She's a lady. Only--she's been
something else, too! You watch how she uses a perfectly trained body."
</p><p>I all but started. I had seen it already, when I thought she moved like
Pavlova. "Anything else?" I inquired disagreeably.
</p><p>"Yes," said Marcia quietly. "She's afraid for her life, or Dudley's--I
can't make out which. Wait, and you'll see. Come on; we'll be late for
supper. It would have been over hours ago if Dudley and I hadn't been
out shooting this afternoon. We've only just come in."
</p><p>But I was not thinking about supper. The Wilbrahams had been out, and
Paulette Brown, left alone, had taken her chance to speak to some one.
That she had happened to mistake her man and spoken to me made no
difference in the fact, and it came too aptly on Marcia's suspicions
about her. But "My good heavens, I won't care what she did," I thought
fiercely. My dream girl's eyes were honest, if they were deep blue lakes
a man might drown his soul in, too. If she were Dudley's twice over I
was going to stand by her, because by all my dreams of her she was more
mine. "I haven't time, or chances, to be watching pretty ladies," I said
drily, "and I wouldn't bother over it myself if I were you. I'd let it
go at plain Paulette Brown!"
</p><p>"If you could," said Marcia, just as drily. And over her words, close
outside the window, a wolf howled.
</p><p>It startled me, as it had startled me once before that evening, only
this time I knew the reason. "Scott, I never knew the wolves to be
coming out so early in the season!" I was thankful to be back to things
I could exclaim about. "And down here, beside the house, I never saw
any!"
</p><p>"No; so Dudley said," Marcia returned almost absently. She opened the
door for herself, because I had forgotten it, and stood looking at the
lighted living room at the end of the passage by the front door. "But
the wolves have been round for a week--that was what I meant when I said
I was going to have some wolf hunts! The mine superintendent's going to
take me."
</p><p>"Thompson!" I let out. Then I chuckled. Marcia was likely to have a
great wolf hunt with Thompson, who knew no difference between a shotgun
and a rifle, and would have legged it from a fox if he had met it alone.
"Marcia Wilbraham, I'll pay you five dollars if you ever get out wolf
hunting with Thompson. Why, the only thing he <u>can</u> do for diversion is
to play solitaire!"
</p><p>"Oh, him--yes," said Marcia carelessly and without grammar. "But I
didn't mean old Thompson. He's been gone for a month, and we've a new
man. His name's Macartney, and he's been here two weeks."
</p><p>It was news to me, if it was also an example of the way Dudley Wilbraham
ran his mine. But before I could speak Marcia nodded significantly down
the passage to the living room door. I had been looking into the room
myself, as you do at the lighted stage in a theatre, and I had seen only
one thing in it: my dream girl--whose name might or might not be
Paulette Brown, whom Dudley Wilbraham had more right to than I
had--sitting by the fire as I had left her, that fire I had dreamed I
should come home to, just myself alone, and talking to Dudley. But
Marcia had been looking at something else, and now my gaze followed
hers.
</p><p>A tall, lean, hard, capable-looking man stood on the other side of the
fire. He was taking no share in the conversation between Dudley and the
girl who had only lived in my dreams till to-night. He was watching the
living room door, quite palpably, and it struck me abruptly that I had
not far to seek for Marcia Wilbraham's reason for staying the winter at
La Chance. But I might have taken more interest in that and in
Macartney, the new mine superintendent, too, if the girl sitting by the
fire had not seen Marcia in the doorway and risen to her feet.
</p><p>For she floated up, effortlessly, unconsciously, to the very tips of her
toes, and stood so--like Pavlova!
