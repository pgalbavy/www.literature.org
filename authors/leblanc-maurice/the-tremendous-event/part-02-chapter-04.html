<p>All things considered, their best chance of safety would have been to
plunge into the river and escape by the left bank. But this plan,
which would have cut them off from Rolleston and which Simon did not
wish to adopt except in the last extremity, must have been foreseen by
Forsetta, for, as soon as light was clear enough, they saw two tramps
going up the Somme on the opposite bank. Under these conditions, how
were they to land?
</p><p>Shortly afterwards, they saw that their retreat was discovered and
that the enemy was profiting by their hesitation. On the same bank as
themselves, some five hundred yards down-stream, appeared the barrel
of a rifle. Up-stream an identical menace confronted them.
</p><p>"Forsetta and Mazzani," declared Dolores. "We are cut off right and
left."
</p><p>"But there's nobody in front of us."
</p><p>"Yes, the rest of the tramps."
</p><p>"I don't see them."
</p><p>"They are there, believe me, in hiding and well sheltered."
</p><p>"Let's rush at them and get by!"
</p><p>"To do that, we should have to cover a bare patch under the cross-fire
of Mazzani and Forsetta. They are good shots. They won't miss us."
</p><p>"Then what?"
</p><p>"Well, let's defend ourselves here."
</p><p>It was good advice. The cargo of marble blocks, piled
higgledy-piggledy like a child's building-bricks, formed a thorough
citadel. Dolores and Simon climbed it and at the top selected a fort,
protected on all sides, from which they could see the slightest
movements of their enemies.
</p><p>"They're coming," Dolores declared, after an attentive scrutiny.
</p><p>The river had deposited along the banks trunks of trees and enormous
roots, drifting it was impossible to say whence, which Forsetta and
Mazzani were using to cover their approach. Moreover, at each rush
forward they protected themselves with broad planks which they carried
with them. And Dolores called Simon's attention to the fact that more
things were moving across the bare plain; more shields improvised of
all sorts of stray materials: coils of rope, broken parts of boats,
fragments of pontoons and pieces of boilerplate. All these things were
creeping imperceptibly, with the sure, heavy pace of tortoises making
for the same goal, along the radius that led to the centre. And the
centre was the fortress. The tramps were investing it under the orders
of Mazzani and Forsetta. From time to time a limb or a head appeared
in sight.
</p><p>"Ah!" said Simon, in a voice filled with rage. "If only I had a few
bullets, wouldn't I stop this inroad of wood-lice!"
</p><p>Dolores had made a display of the two useless rifles, in the hope that
the threatening aspect would intimidate the enemy. But the confidence
of the attackers increased with the inactivity of the besieged. It was
even possible that the two Indians had scented the ruse, for they
scarcely attempted to conceal themselves.
</p><p>To show his skill, one of them--Forsetta, Dolores declared--shot down
a sea-gull skimming along the river. Mazzani accepted the challenge.
An aeroplane, humming in their direction and flying lower than most,
seemed suddenly to drop from the clouds and silently glided across
the river, over the blocks of marble. When it came level, Mazzani
threw up his rifle, slowly took aim and fired. The pilot was hit, bore
downwards, heeled over on either side alternately, until he seemed
about to capsize, and passed on, disappearing in a zig-zag flight like
that of a wounded bird.
</p><p>And suddenly, Simon having shown his head, two bullets fired by the
two Indians ricochetted from the nearest stone surface, detaching a
few splinters.
</p><p>"Oh, please don't be so imprudent!" Dolores implored.
</p><p>A drop of blood trickled down his forehead. She staunched it gently
with her handkerchief and murmured:
</p><p>"You see, Simon, those men will get the better of us. And you still
refuse to leave me? You risk your life, though nothing can affect the
issue?"
</p><p>He pushed her away from him:
</p><p>"My life is not at stake. . . . Nor yours either. . . . This handful
of wretches will never get at us."
</p><p>He was mistaken. Some of the vagabonds were within eighty yards of
them. They could hear them talking together; and the men's hard faces,
covered with grey stubble, shot up from behind their bucklers like the
head of a Jack-in-the-box.
</p><p>Forsetta was shouting his orders:
</p><p>"Forward! . . . There's no danger! . . . They've no ammunition! . . .
Forward, I tell you! The Frenchman's pockets are stuffed with notes!"
</p><p>The seven tramps ran forward as one man. Simon levelled his revolver
briskly and fired. They stopped. No one was hit. Forsetta was
triumphant:
</p><p>"They're done for! . . . Nothing but short-range Browning bullets!
. . . At them!"
</p><p>He himself, protecting his body with a piece of sheet-iron, ran up at
full speed. Mazzani and the tramps formed up in a circle at thirty or
forty yards.
</p><p>"Ready!" bellowed Forsetta. "Out with your knives!"
</p><p>Dolores remarked to Simon that they must not remain in their
observation-post, since most of their enemies would be able to reach
the foot of the fortress unseen and slip between the marble blocks.
They slid through a gap which formed a chimney from the top to the
ground.
</p><p>"There they are! There they are!" said Dolores. "Fire now! . . . Look,
here's a chink!"
</p><p>Through this chink Simon saw two big ruffians walking ahead of the
rest. Two shots rang out. The two big ruffians fell. The party halted
for the second time, hesitating what to do.
</p><p>Dolores and Simon profited by this delay to take refuge at the extreme
edge of the river. Three single blocks of marble formed a sort of
sentry-box, with an empty space in front of it.
</p><p>"Charge!" shouted Forsetta, joining the men. "They're trapped! Mazzani
and I have got them covered. If the Frenchman stirs, we'll shoot him
down!"
</p><p>To meet the charge, Simon and Dolores were obliged to stand up and
half-expose themselves. Terrified by the Indian's threat, Dolores
threw herself before Simon, making a rampart of her body.
</p><p>"Halt!" ordered Forsetta, restraining his men's onrush. "And you,
Dolores, you leave your Frenchman! Come! He shall have his life if
you leave him. He can go: it's you I'm after!"
</p><p>Simon seized the girl with his left arm and drew her back by main
force:
</p><p>"Not a movement!" he said. "I forbid you to leave me! I'll answer for
your safety. As long as I live those brutes shan't get you."
</p><p>And, with the girl pressed against the hollow of his shoulder, he
stretched out his right arm.
</p><p>"Well done, M. Dubosc!" jeered Forsetta. "Seems that we're sweet on
the fair Dolores and that we're sticking to her! Those Frenchmen are
all alike! Chivalrous fellows!"
</p><p>With a wave of the hand he gathered up the tramps for the final
attack:
</p><p>"Now then, mates! One more effort and all the notes are yours! Mazzani
and I bag the pretty lady. Is that right, Mazzani?"
</p><p>All together they came rushing on. All together, at an order from
Forsetta, they hurled, like so many projectiles, the pieces of wood
and iron with which they had protected themselves. Dolores was not
hit, but Simon, struck on the arm, dropped his Browning at the very
moment when he had fired at Mazzani and brought him down. One of the
tramps leapt upon the pistol, which had rolled away, while Forsetta
struggled with Dolores, avoiding the girl's dagger and imprisoning her
in his arms.
</p><p>"Oh, Simon! I'm done for!" she screamed, trying to hang on to him.
</p><p>But Simon had the five tramps to deal with. Unarmed, with nothing but
his hands and feet to fight with, he was shot at three times by the
man who had picked up his pistol and was clumsily firing off the last
few cartridges. He staggered for a moment under the weight of the
other brutes and was thrown to the ground. Two of them seized his
legs. Two others tried to strangle him, while the fifth still kept him
covered with his empty pistol.
</p><p>"Simon, save me! . . . Save me!" cried Dolores, whom Forsetta was
carrying off, wrapped in a blanket and bound with a rope.
</p><p>He made a desperate effort, escaping his assailants for a few seconds,
and, before they had time to come to close quarters again, acting on a
sudden impulse he threw his pocket-book to them, shouting:
</p><p>"Hands off, you blackguards! Share that between you! Thirty thousand!"
</p><p>The bundles of notes fell out of the leather wallet and were
scattered over the ground. The tramps did not hesitate, but plumped
down on their hands and knees, leaving the field to Simon.
</p><p>Fifty yards away, Forsetta was running along the river, with his prey
slung over his shoulder. Farther on, the two tramps posted on the
other bank were punting themselves across on a raft which they had
found. If Forsetta came up with them, it meant his safety.
</p><p>"He won't get there," Simon said to himself, measuring the distance
with his eye.
</p><p>With a quick movement, he snatched the knife of one of his aggressors
and set off at a run.
</p><p>Forsetta, who believed him to be still struggling with the vagabonds,
did not hurry. He had, so to speak, rolled Dolores round his neck,
holding her legs, head and arms in front of him and crushing them to
his chest with his rifle and his brawny arms. He shouted to the two
men on the raft, to stimulate their ardour:
</p><p>"Here's the girl! She's my share. . . . You shall have all her
jewels!"
</p><p>The men warned him:
</p><p>"Look out!"
</p><p>He turned, saw Simon at twenty paces' distance and tried to throw
Dolores to the ground with a heave of the shoulder, like an irksome
burden. The girl fell, but she had so contrived matters, under cover
of the suffocating blanket, that at the moment of falling she had a
good grip on the barrel of the Indian's rifle; and in her fall she
dragged him down with her.
</p><p>The few seconds which Forsetta needed to recover his weapon were his
undoing. Simon leapt upon him before he could take aim. He stumbled
once more, received a dagger-thrust in the hip and went down on his
knees, begging for mercy.
</p><p>Simon released Dolores' bonds; then, addressing the two tramps who,
terror-stricken when on the point of touching ground, were now trying
to push off again:
</p><p>"See to his wound," he ordered. "And there's the other Indian over
there: he's probably alive. Look after him too, you shall have your
lives."
</p><p>The tramps were scattering so rapidly in the distance, with Simon's
bank-notes, that he gave up all idea of pursuing them.
</p><p>Thus he remained master of the battle-field. Dead, wounded, or in
fight, his adversaries were defeated. The extraordinary adventure was
continuing as it were in a savage country and against the most
unexpected background.
</p><p>He was profoundly conscious of the incredible moments through which he
was passing, on the bed of the Channel, between France and England, in
a region which was truly a land of death, crime, cunning and violence.
And he had triumphed!
</p><p>He could not refrain from smiling and, leaning with both hands on
Forsetta's rifle, he said to Dolores:
</p><p>"The prairie! It's Fenimore Cooper's prairie! The Far West! It's all
here: the attack by Sioux, the improvised blockhouse, the abduction,
the fight, with the chief of the Pale-Faces coming out victorious!
. . ."
</p><p>She stood facing him, very erect. Her thin silk blouse had been torn
in the struggle and hung in strips around her bosom. Simon added, in a
tone of less assurance:
</p><p>"And here's the fair Indian."
</p><p>Was it emotion, or excessive fatigue after her protracted efforts?
Dolores staggered and seemed on the verge of fainting. He supported
her, holding her in his arms:
</p><p>"You're surely not wounded?" he said.
</p><p>"No. . . . A passing giddiness. . . . I have been badly frightened.
. . . And I had no business to be frightened, since you were there and
you had promised to save me. Oh, Simon, how grateful I am to you!"
</p><p>"I have done what any one would have done in my place, Dolores. Don't
thank me."
</p><p>He tried to free himself, but she held him and, after a moment's
silence, said:
</p><p>"She whom the chief calls the fair Indian had a name by which she was
known in her own country. Shall I tell you what it was?"
</p><p>"What was it, Dolores?"
</p><p>In a low voice, without taking her eyes from his, she replied:
</p><p>"The Chief's Reward!"
</p><p>He had felt, in his inner consciousness, that this magnificent
creature deserved some such name, that she was truly the prey which
men seek to ravish, the captive to be saved at any cost, and that she
did indeed offer, with her red lips and her brown shoulders, the most
wonderful of rewards.
</p><p>She had flung her arms about his neck; he was conscious of their
caress; and for a moment they stood like that, motionless, uncertain
of what was coming. But Isabel's image flashed across his mind and he
remembered the oath which she had required of him:
</p><p>"Not a moment's weakness, Simon. I should never forgive that."
</p><p>He pulled himself together and said:
</p><p>"Get some rest, Dolores. We have still a long way to go."
</p><p>She also recovered herself and went down to the river, where she
bathed her face in the cool water. Then, getting to work immediately,
she collected all the provisions and ammunition that she could find on
the wounded men.
</p><p>"There!" she said, when everything was ready for their departure.
"Mazzani and Forsetta won't die, but we have nothing more to fear from
them. We will leave them in the charge of the two tramps. The four of
them will be able to defend themselves."
</p><p>They exchanged no more words. They went up the river for another hour
and reached the wide bend of which the people from Cayeux had told
them. At the very beginning of this bend, which brought the waters of
the Somme direct from France, they picked up Rolleston's trail on a
tract of muddy sand. The trail led straight on, leaving the course of
the river and running north.
</p><p>"The fountains of gold lie in this direction evidently," Simon
inferred. "Rolleston must be at least a day's journey ahead of us."
</p><p>"Yes," said Dolores, "but his party is a large one, they have no
horses left and their two prisoners are delaying their progress."
</p><p>They met several wanderers, all of whom had heard the strange rumour
which had spread from one end of the prairie to the other and all of
whom were hunting for the fountain of gold. No one could give the
least information.
</p><p>But a sort of old crone came hobbling along, leaning on a stick and
carrying a carpet-bag with the head of a little dog sticking out of
it.
</p><p>The dog was barking like mad. The old crone was humming a tune, in a
faint, high-pitched voice.
</p><p>Dolores questioned her. She replied, in short, sing-song sentences,
which seemed a continuation of her ditty, that she had been walking
for three days, never stopping . . . that she had worn out her shoes
. . . and that when she was tired . . . she got her dog to carry her:
</p><p>"Yes, my dog carries me," she repeated. "Don't you, Dick?"
</p><p>"She's mad," Simon muttered.
</p><p>The old woman nodded in assent and addressed them in a confidential
tone:
</p><p>"Yes, I'm mad. . . . I used not to be, but it's the gold . . . the
rain of gold that has made me mad. . . . It shoots into the air like a
fountain . . . and the gold coins and the bright pebbles . . . fall in
a shower. . . . So you hold out your hat or your bag and the gold
comes pouring into it. . . . My bag is full. . . . Would you like to
see?"
</p><p>She laughed quietly and, beckoning to Simon and Dolores, took her dog
by the scruff of the neck, dropped him on the ground and half-opened
her bag. Then, again in her sing-song voice:
</p><p>"You are honest folk, aren't you? . . . I wouldn't show it to any one
else. . . . But you won't hurt me."
</p><p>Dolores and Simon eagerly bent over the bag. With her bony fingers the
old woman first lifted a heap of rags kept there for Dick's benefit;
she then removed a few shiny red and yellow pebbles. Beneath these lay
quite a little hoard of gold coins, of which she seized a generous
handful, making them clink in the hollow of her hand. They were old
coins of all sizes and bearing all sorts of heads.
</p><p>Simon exclaimed excitedly:
</p><p>"She comes from there! . . . She has been there!"
</p><p>And shaking the mad woman by the shoulders, he asked:
</p><p>"Where is it? How many hours have you been walking? Have you seen a
party of men leading two prisoners, an old man and a girl?"
</p><p>But the madwoman picked up her dog and closed her bag. She refused to
hear. At the most, as she moved away, she said, or rather sang to the
air of a ballad which the dog accompanied with his barking:
</p><p>"Men on horseback. . . . They were galloping. . . . It was yesterday.
. . . A girl with fair hair. . . ."
</p><p>Simon shrugged his shoulders:
</p><p>"She's wandering. Rolleston has no horses. . . ."
</p><p>"True," said Dolores, "but, all the same, Miss Bakefield's hair is
fair."
</p><p>They were much astonished, a little way on, to find that Rolleston's
trail branched off into another trail which came from France and which
had been left by the trampling of many horses--a dozen, Dolores
estimated--whose marks were less recent than the bandits' footprints.
These were evidently the men on horseback whom the madwoman had seen.
</p><p>Dolores and Simon had only to follow the beaten track displayed before
their eyes on the carpet of moist sand. The region of shells had come
to an end. The plain was strewn with great, absolutely round rocks,
formed by pebbles agglomerated in marl, huge balls polished by all the
submarine currents and deep-sea tides. In the end they were packed so
close together that they constituted an insuperable obstacle, which
the horsemen and then Rolleston had wheeled round.
</p><p>When Simon and Dolores had passed it, they came to a wide depression
of the ground, the bottom of which was reached by circular terraces.
Down here were a few more of the round rocks. Amid these rocks lay a
number of corpses. They counted five.
</p><p>They were the bodies of young men, smartly dressed and wearing boots
and spurs. Four had been killed by bullets, the fifth by a stab in the
back between the shoulders.
</p><p>Simon and Dolores looked at each other and then each continued in
independent search.
</p><p>On the sand lay bridles and girth, two nosebags full of oats,
half-emptied meat-tins, unrolled blankets and a spirit-stove.
</p><p>The victims' pockets had been ransacked. Nevertheless, Simon found in
a waistcoat a sheet of paper bearing a list of ten names--Paul
Cormier, Armand Darnaud, etc.--headed by this note:
</p><p>"Foret-d'Eu Hunt."
</p><p>Dolores explored the immediate surroundings. The clues which she thus
obtained and the facts discovered by Simon enabled them to reconstruct
the tragedy exactly. The horsemen, all members of a Norman hunt,
camping on this spot two nights before, had been surprised in the
morning by Rolleston's gang and the greater number massacred.
</p><p>With such men as Rolleston and his followers, the attack had
inevitably ended in a thorough loot, but its main object had been the
theft of the horses. When these had been taken after a fight, the
robbers had made off at a gallop.
</p><p>"There are only five bodies," said Dolores, "and there are ten names
on the list. Where are the other five riders?"
</p><p>"Scattered," said Simon, "wounded, dying, anything. I daresay we
should find them by searching round? But how can we? Have we the right
to delay, when the safety of Miss Bakefield and her father is at
stake? Think, Dolores: Rolleston has more than thirty hours' start of
us and he and his men are mounted on excellent horses, while we. . . .
And then where are we to catch them?"
</p><p>He clenched his fists with rage:
</p><p>"Oh, if I only knew where this fountain of gold was! How far from it
are we? A day's march? Two days'? It's horrible to know nothing, to go
forward at random, in this accursed country!"
