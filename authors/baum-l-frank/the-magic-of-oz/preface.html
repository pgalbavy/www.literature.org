<H3>To My Readers</H3>
Curiously enough, in the events which have taken place in the last
few years in our "great outside world," we may find incidents so
marvelous and inspiring that I cannot hope to equal them with stories
of The Land of Oz.
<P>
However, "The Magic of Oz" is really more strange and unusual than
anything I have read or heard about on our side of The Great Sandy
Desert which shuts us off from The Land of Oz, even during the past
exciting years, so I hope it will appeal to your love of novelty.
<P>
A long and confining illness has prevented my answering all the good
letters sent me--unless stamps were enclosed--but from now on I hope to
be able to give prompt attention to each and every letter with which
my readers favor me.
<P>
Assuring you that my love for you has never faltered and hoping the
Oz Books will continue to give you pleasure as long as I am able to
write them, I am
<P>
Yours affectionately,
L. FRANK BAUM,
"Royal Historian of Oz."
