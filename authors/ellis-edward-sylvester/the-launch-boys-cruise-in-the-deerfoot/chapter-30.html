<p>The amazement of Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes was as overwhelming
as that of Mike Murphy. For a brief while they stared across the
water, without the Captain shifting the wheel. It is said that
a person's voice is the surest means of disclosing his identity,
but Mike's tones did not sound natural because of their hoarseness.
There was no mistaking that sturdy figure, however, that stood
on the top of one of the rocks, acting like a lunatic, as indeed
he was for the moment.</p>

<p>The boat was brought as close to shore as was safe, where Mike
stood waiting. Letting go of the wheel, Alvin stepped forward
and reached out his hand, which was grasped by the lad, who leaped
aboard. The scene that followed would have brought moisture to
the eyes of the most indifferent spectator. Alvin flung his arms
about the neck of Mike, with a fervent "Thank God!" and Mike responded
in kind. Then Chester did the same, and for a moment none spoke
because he could not.</p>

<p>"Arrah, now! don't be childers! Brace up the same as mesilf and
be a mon! Did ye iver see me betray sich foolish waakness? It's
mesilf that's ashamed&#11834;"</p>

<p>Mike's voice suddenly broke, and dropping onto the nearest seat,
he impulsively covered his face with his hands and with heaving
shoulders sobbed as if the fountains of his grief were broken
up. His friends smiled, but it was through their tears. The boat
drifted from the rocks, and for some length of time the propeller
was motionless.</p>

<p>Mike was the first to recover his self-control. He was laughing
as with his handkerchief he wiped his eyes.</p>

<p>"Begorra! it's a fool that I am, as Jerry Connolly remarked whin
he mistook a billiard ball for a pratie. I say, byes, will ye
do me a favor?"</p>

<p>"There isn't anything we wouldn't gladly do for you," replied
Alvin, taking his place at the wheel and moving the lever which
set the screw revolving.</p>

<p>"Both of ye sarch yer clothes and saa whither ye haven't a few
loaves of bread, some biled praties and a pound or two of maat
hidden in the same."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to say, Mike," replied Chester, "that we haven't a
mouthful of food here on board. We have already had our dinner."</p>

<p>"And the only maal I've got is the one I've got to git."</p>

<p>"We'll make all haste to Boothbay where you shall have the biggest
feast of your life," said Alvin, giving the craft full speed with
her nose pointed to the northwest.</p>

<p>"And whin I'm through there'll be a famine started in the town,
as was always the case whin dad took his dinner in any of the
near-by places at home."</p>

<p>As the <em>Deerfoot</em> cut her way through the water with a
speed that sent the spray flying over the wind-shield, Mike told
his story, which you may be sure was listened to with rapt interest
by his friends. They in turn gave him all the facts that were
new to him, and each fervently thanked God for His great mercy.</p>

<p>The afternoon was nearly gone when the <em>Deerfoot</em> settled
to rest beside the floating wharf, and was made fast and left
in charge of the same man who had done similar duty before. Then
the three walked briskly up the steps and street to the hotel.</p>

<p>"The bist plan will be to order dinner for the thraa of us,"
whispered Mike; "that will be classy."</p>

<p>"We have had our midday meal," said Alvin, "and the regular dinner
time is an hour or more away."</p>

<p>"Whist now, I'll see that none of the stuff is wasted."</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that great as was the strain upon the resources
of the hotel, it proved equal to the call, and Mike ate the biggest
meal of his life. Alvin and Chester sat at the table with him,
each drinking a cup of tea, but preferring no food until the usual
time. You may be sure the hour was a merry one, and the guest
did not stop feasting until the limit of his capacity was reached.</p>

<p>When they passed down the main street and turned off to the landing,
it had become fully dark and lights were showing in the stores
and houses. Both Alvin and Chester noted a peculiar fact: most
of those whom they met stared curiously at Mike Murphy. The chums
observed the same thing on their way up the street, but it was
more marked on their return.</p>

<p>"I'm not to blame if I'm so much purtier than aither of ye, that
I compil the admiration of others. It has been the same wheriver
I strayed."</p>

<p>This was the explanation given by the subject of the scrutiny.
The youths were too modest to differ with their genial companion,
but the man left in charge of the boat glanced sharply at the
Irish lad, and said to Alvin:</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad."</p>

<p>"Mighty glad of what?" asked the surprised Captain.</p>

<p>"That that chap wasn't drowned."</p>

<p>"Why should he be drowned more than we or you?"</p>

<p>"I can't say that he should," replied the other, adding naught
in the way of enlightenment. Alvin was annoyed, but said nothing
further, and soon the <em>Deerfoot</em>, with lights burning,
was gliding at moderate speed down the bay and along the eastern
coast of Southport Island. There, as you will recall, were the
homes of Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes, near the shore and almost
opposite Squirrel Island. Chester had accepted his friend's invitation
to spend the night with him. This made it unnecessary to run the
<em>Deerfoot</em> to the shelter provided for her near the dwelling
of Chester. The promise of fair weather was so marked that there
was no hesitation in mooring the launch in the open without the
canvas which would have been stretched over the exposed parts
to protect them from possible rain.</p>

<p>The night was clear, with the stars shining. Later the moon would
appear, but our friends were so familiar with the way that they
would not have hesitated had the gloom been much deeper. They
were within a mile of Alvin's home when they caught sight of the
lights and outlines of a small boat on the opposite course. It
was farther out than they, and they could not see distinctly until
they came opposite, with barely a hundred feet between them. It
was going very much faster than they themselves.</p>

<p>"Alvin," said Chester in some excitement, "I believe that is
the <em>Shark</em>."</p>

<p>"It looks like her. What can she have been doing down here?"</p>

<p>Chester shouted:</p>

<p>"Hello, George!"</p>

<p>There was no reply, though the man aboard could not have failed
to hear them.</p>

<p>"You must have been mistaken," said Alvin.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I was not, though I can't imagine why he didn't answer.
Well, it's a small matter anyway."</p>

<p>Mike who had been silent for some time now spoke:</p>

<p>"Byes, I'm a wee bit unaisy, as Jim Concannon said whin he found
his trousers was on fire at the top and bottom."</p>

<p>"What about?" asked Chester.</p>

<p>"I'm fearing that the account which dad has piled up agin me
is so big that he will lack the strength to square it."</p>

<p>"He will be so glad to see you back that I'm sure he will think
of naught else," assured Alvin.</p>

<p>"Whin I say to him that I didn't understand his words at the
time I was sailing by yisterday and he ordered me to come ashore,
he won't cridit the same. Ye see he doesn't&mdash;ah! I have it fixed!"
exclaimed Mike, delighted with the idea that had flashed into
his brain.</p>

<p>"Let's hear it."</p>

<p>"I'll linger behind while ye two go forrid and say to dad and
mither that poor Mike has been drowned."</p>

<p>"Why in the name of common sense should we say <em>that</em>?"
asked the astonished Chester.</p>

<p>"I want ye to break the news of me coming gintly; after they
have digisted the story of me drowning, ye can say yer tongue
slipped and ye meant to say I come near drowning but didn't quite
make it."</p>

<p>"That's the most original way of telling news," said Alvin, with
a laugh. "I can't see how it will be of much help, but I'll do
what I can. What have you to suggest, Chester?"</p>

<p>"It's clear that unless we pave the way for Mike he is in for
a big trouncing. I advise that he stay on the boat while we go
forward and call upon his folks. We can prove to them that he
has been in great danger and soften the heart, I hope, of his
father."</p>

<p>"And thin whin the right moment comes I'll appear to 'em," said
Mike, who was pleased with the scheme. "But how will I know whin
that right moment arrives?" he asked.</p>

<p>"One of us will open the front door and whistle."</p>

<p>"Don't whistle too soon or wait too long, as Jack Mulrooney did
whin he ate a green persimmon before whistlin' fur his dog."</p>

<p>Fearing that the noise of the launch might attract the attention
of the father of Mike, and bring him out doors, the son curled
down in the cockpit, where he could not be seen by anyone on shore.
Chester sprang out and made the launch fast and Alvin followed
him. Before they left, Mike raised his head.</p>

<p>"Are you sure the <em>Deerfut</em> won't play me the same trick
it did last night and run away wid me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No fear of that; if it does, you know how to run it?"</p>

<p>"Have ye 'nough gas in the b'iler?"</p>

<p>"Oh, keep still and don't show yourself, or I shall tell your
father you are here and waiting for the licking he is saving for
you."</p>

<p>Mike dropped down out of sight, and though he immediately thought
of several important questions to ask, did not do so. He must
now wait with all the patience he could summon for the signal
that it was prudent for him to show himself.</p>

<p>It was only a brief walk to the care-taker's house, and the light
shining through the window and the sound of voices told that the
couple were at home. But in the very act of opening the door,
the boys paused.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked Alvin of his companion.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," was the reply.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy was sobbing and lamenting like a woman distracted.
Her husband seemed to be silent, as if holding himself in better
control. Finally they caught some of her wailing exclamations:</p>

<p>"Poor Micky! the darlint is drowned and it's me heart that is
broke! Wurrah! wurrah! woe is me!"</p>
