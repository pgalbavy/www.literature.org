<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A violent ringing of the bell awakened the concierge of number
nine, avenue Hoche. She pulled the doorstring, grumbling:</p>

<p>"I thought everybody was in. It must be three o’clock!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is some one for the doctor," muttered her husband.</p>

<p>At that moment, a voice inquired:</p>

<p>"Doctor Harel .... what floor?" </p>

<p>"Third floor, left. But the doctor won’t go out at night."</p>

<p>"He must go to-night."</p>

<p>The visitor entered the vestibule, ascended to the first floor,
the second, the third, and, without stopping at the doctor’s door,
he continued to the fifth floor. There, he tried two keys. One
of them fitted the lock.</p>

<p>"Ah! good!" he murmured, "that simplifies the business wonderfully.
But before I commence work I had better arrange for my retreat.
Let me see.... have I had sufficient time to rouse the doctor
and be dismissed by him? Not yet.... a few minutes more."</p>

<p>At the end of ten minutes, he descended the stairs, grumbling
noisily about the doctor. The concierge opened the door for him
and heard it click behind him. But the door did not lock, as the
man had quickly inserted a piece of iron in the lock in such a
manner that the bolt could not enter. Then, quietly, he entered
the house again, unknown to the concierge. In case of alarm, his
retreat was assured. Noiselessly, he ascended to the fifth floor
once more. In the antechamber, by the light of his electric lantern,
he placed his hat and overcoat on one of the chairs, took a seat
on another, and covered his heavy shoes with felt slippers.</p>

<p>"Ouf! Here I am&mdash;and how simple it was! I wonder why more people
do not adopt the profitable and pleasant occupation of burglar.
With a little care and reflection, it becomes a most delightful
profession. Not too quiet and monotonous, of course, as it would
then become wearisome."</p>

<p>He unfolded a detailed plan of the apartment.</p>

<p>"Let me commence by locating myself. Here, I see the vestibule
in which I am sitting. On the street front, the drawing-room,
the boudoir and dining-room. Useless to waste any time there,
as it appears that the countess has a deplorable taste.... not
a bibelot of any value!...Now, let’s get down to business!...
Ah! here is a corridor; it must lead to the bed chambers. At a
distance of three metres, I should come to the door of the wardrobe-closet
which connects with the chamber of the countess." He folded his
plan, extinguished his lantern, and proceeded down the corridor,
counting his distance, thus:</p>

<p>"One metre.... two metres.... three metres....Here is the door....Mon
Dieu, how easy it is! Only a small, simple bolt now separates
me from the chamber, and I know that the bolt is located exactly
one metre, forty-three centimeters, from the floor. So that, thanks
to a small incision I am about to make, I can soon get rid of
the bolt."</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket the necessary instruments. Then the following
idea occurred to him:</p>

<p>"Suppose, by chance, the door is not bolted. I will try it first."</p>

<p>He turned the knob, and the door opened.</p>

<p>"My brave Lupin, surely fortune favors you....What’s to be done
now? You know the situation of the rooms; you know the place in
which the countess hides the black pearl. Therefore, in order
to secure the black pearl, you have simply to be more silent than
silence, more invisible than darkness itself."</p>

<p>Arsène Lupin was employed fully a half-hour in opening the second
door&mdash;a glass door that led to the countess’ bedchamber. But he
accomplished it with so much skill and precaution, that even had
the countess been awake, she would not have heard the slightest
sound. According to the plan of the rooms, that he holds, he has
merely to pass around a reclining chair and, beyond that, a small
table close to the bed. On the table, there was a box of letter-paper,
and the black pearl was concealed in that box. He stooped and
crept cautiously over the carpet, following the outlines of the
reclining-chair. When he reached the extremity of it, he stopped
in order to repress the throbbing of his heart. Although he was
not moved by any sense of fear, he found it impossible to overcome
the nervous anxiety that one usually feels in the midst of profound
silence. That circumstance astonished him, because he had passed
through many more solemn moments without the slightest trace of
emotion. No danger threatened him. Then why did his heart throb
like an alarm-bell? Was it that sleeping woman who affected him?
Was it the proximity of another pulsating heart?</p>

<p>He listened, and thought he could discern the rhythmical breathing
of a person asleep. It gave him confidence, like the presence
of a friend. He sought and found the armchair; then, by slow,
cautious movements, advanced toward the table, feeling ahead of
him with outstretched arm. His right had touched one of the feet
of the table. Ah! now, he had simply to rise, take the pearl,
and escape. That was fortunate, as his heart was leaping in his
breast like a wild beast, and made so much noise that he feared
it would waken the countess. By a powerful effort of the will,
he subdued the wild throbbing of his heart, and was about to rise
from the floor when his left hand encountered, lying on the floor,
an object which he recognized as a candlestick&mdash;an overturned
candlestick. A moment later, his hand encountered another object:
a clock&mdash;one of those small traveling clocks, covered with leather.&#11834;</p>

<p>Well! What had happened? He could not understand. That candlestick,
that clock; why were those articles not in their accustomed places?
Ah! what had happened in the dread silence of the night?</p>

<p>Suddenly a cry escaped him. He had touched&mdash;oh! some strange,
unutterable thing! "No! no!" he thought, "it cannot be. It is
some fantasy of my excited brain." For twenty seconds, thirty
seconds, he remained motionless, terrified, his forehead bathed
with perspiration, and his fingers still retained the sensation
of that dreadful contact.</p>

<p>Making a desperate effort, he ventured to extend his arm again.
Once more, his hand encountered that strange, unutterable thing.
He felt it. He must feel it and find out what it is. He found
that it was hair, human hair, and a human face; and that face
was cold, almost icy.</p>

<p>However frightful the circumstances may be, a man like Arsène
Lupin controls himself and commands the situation as soon as he
learns what it is. So, Arsène Lupin quickly brought his lantern
into use. A woman was lying before him, covered with blood. Her
neck and shoulders were covered with gaping wounds. He leaned
over her and made a closer examination. She was dead.</p>

<p>"Dead! Dead!" he repeated, with a bewildered air.</p>

<p>He stared at those fixed eyes, that grim mouth, that livid flesh,
and that blood&mdash;all that blood which had flowed over the carpet
and congealed there in thick, black spots. He arose and turned
on the electric lights. Then he beheld all the marks of a desperate
struggle. The bed was in a state of great disorder. On the floor,
the candlestick, and the clock, with the hands pointing to twenty
minutes after eleven; then, further away, an overturned chair;
and, everywhere, there was blood, spots of blood and pools of
blood.</p>

<p>"And the black pearl?" he murmured.</p>

<p>The box of letter-paper was in its place. He opened it, eagerly.
The jewel-case was there, but it was empty.</p>

<p>"Fichtre!" he muttered. "You boasted of your good fortune much
too soon, my friend Lupin. With the countess lying cold and dead,
and the black pearl vanished, the situation is anything but pleasant.
Get out of here as soon as you can, or you may get into serious
trouble."</p>

<p>Yet, he did not move.</p>

<p>"Get out of here? Yes, of course. Any person would, except Arsène
Lupin. He has something better to do. Now, to proceed in an orderly
way. At all events, you have a clear conscience. Let us suppose
that you are the commissary of police and that you are proceeding
to make an inquiry concerning this affair-&mdash;Yes, but in order
to do that, I require a clearer brain. Mine is muddled like a
ragout."</p>

<p>He tumbled into an armchair, with his clenched hands pressed
against his burning forehead.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>The murder of the avenue Hoche is one of those which have recently
surprised and puzzled the Parisian public, and, certainly, I should
never have mentioned the affair if the veil of mystery had not
been removed by Arsène Lupin himself. No one knew the exact truth
of the case.</p>

<p>Who did not know&mdash;from having met her in the Bois&mdash;the fair Léotine
Zalti, the once-famous cantatrice, wife and widow of the Count
d’Andillot; the Zalti, whose luxury dazzled all Paris some twenty
years ago; the Zalti who acquired an European reputation for the
magnificence of her diamonds and pearls? It was said that she
wore upon her shoulders the capital of several banking houses
and the gold mines of numerous Australian companies. Skilful jewelers
worked for Zalti as they had formerly wrought for kings and queens.
And who does not remember the catastrophe in which all that wealth
was swallowed up? Of all that marvelous collection, nothing remained
except the famous black pearl. The black pearl! That is to say
a fortune, if she had wished to part with it.</p>

<p>But she preferred to keep it, to live in a commonplace apartment
with her companion, her cook, and a man-servant, rather than sell
that inestimable jewel. There was a reason for it; a reason she
was not afraid to disclose: the black pearl was the gift of an
emperor! Almost ruined, and reduced to the most mediocre existence,
she remained faithful to the companion of her happy and brilliant
youth. The black pearl never left her possession. She wore it
during the day, and, at night, concealed it in a place known to
her alone.</p>

<p>All these facts, being republished in the columns of the public
press, served to stimulate curiosity; and, strange to say, but
quite obvious to those who have the key to the mystery, the arrest
of the presumed assassin only complicated the question and prolonged
the excitement. Two days later, the newspapers published the following
item:</p>

<p>"Information has reached us of the arrest of Victor Danègre,
the servant of the Countess d’Andillot. The evidence against him
is clear and convincing. On the silken sleeve of his liveried
waistcoat, which chief detective Dudouis found in his garret between
the mattresses of his bed, several spots of blood were discovered.
In addition, a cloth-covered button was missing from that garment,
and this button was found beneath the bed of the victim.</p>

<p>"It is supposed that, after dinner, in place of going to his
own room, Danègre slipped into the wardrobe-closet, and, through
the glass door, had seen the countess hide the precious black
pearl. This is simply a theory, as yet unverified by any evidence.
There is, also, another obscure point. At seven o’clock in the
morning, Danègre went to the tobacco-shop on the Boulevard de
Courcelles; the concierge and the shop-keeper both affirm this
fact. On the other hand, the countess’ companion and cook, who
sleep at the end of the hall, both declare that, when they arose
at eight o’clock, the door of the antechamber and the door of
the kitchen were locked. These two persons have been in the service
of the countess for twenty years, and are above suspicion. The
question is: How did Danègre leave the apartment? Did he have
another key? These are matters that the police will investigate."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the police investigation threw no light
on the mystery. It was learned that Victor Danègre was a dangerous
criminal, a drunkard and a debauchee. But, as they proceeded with
the investigation, the mystery deepened and new complications
arose. In the first place, a young woman, Mlle. De Sinclèves,
the cousin and sole heiress of the countess, declared that the
countess, a month before her death, had written a letter to her
and in it described the manner in which the black pearl was concealed.
The letter disappeared the day after she received it. Who had
stolen it?</p>

<p>Again, the concierge related how she had opened the door for
a person who had inquired for Doctor Harel. On being questioned,
the doctor testified that no one had rung his bell. Then who was
that person? An accomplice?</p>

<p>The theory of an accomplice was thereupon adopted by the press
and public, and also by Ganimard, the famous detective.</p>

<p>"Lupin is at the bottom of this affair," he said to the judge.</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed the judge, "you have Lupin on the brain. You
see him everywhere."</p>

<p>"I see him everywhere, because he is everywhere."</p>

<p>"Say rather that you see him every time you encounter something
you cannot explain. Besides, you overlook the fact that the crime
was committed at twenty minutes past eleven in the evening, as
is shown by the clock, while the nocturnal visit, mentioned by
the concierge, occurred at three o’clock in the morning."</p>

<p>Officers of the law frequently form a hasty conviction as to
the guilt of a suspected person, and then distort all subsequent
discoveries to conform to their established theory. The deplorable
antecedents of Victor Danègre, habitual criminal, drunkard and
rake, influenced the judge, and despite the fact that nothing
new was discovered in corroboration of the early clues, his official
opinion remained firm and unshaken. He closed his investigation,
and, a few weeks later, the trial commenced. It proved to be slow
and tedious. The judge was listless, and the public prosecutor
presented the case in a careless manner. Under those circumstances,
Danègre’s counsel had an easy task. He pointed out the defects
and inconsistencies of the case for the prosecution, and argued
that the evidence was quite insufficient to convict the accused.
Who had made the key, the indispensable key without which Danègre,
on leaving the apartment, could not have locked the door behind
him? Who had ever seen such a key, and what had become of it?
Who had seen the assassin’s knife, and where is it now?</p>

<p>"In any event," argued the prisoner’s counsel, "the prosecution
must prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the prisoner committed
the murder. The prosecution must show that the mysterious individual
who entered the house at three o’clock in the morning is not the
guilty party. To be sure, the clock indicated eleven o’clock.
But what of that? I contend, that proves nothing. The assassin
could turn the hands of the clock to any hour he pleased, and
thus deceive us in regard to the exact hour of the crime."</p>

<p>Victor Danègre was acquitted.</p>

<p>He left the prison on Friday about dusk in the evening, weak
and depressed by his six months’ imprisonment. The inquisition,
the solitude, the trial, the deliberations of the jury, combined
to fill him with a nervous fear. At night, he had been afflicted
with terrible nightmares and haunted by weird visions of the scaffold.
He was a mental and physical wreck.</p>

<p>Under the assumed name of Anatole Dufour, he rented a small room
on the heights of Montmartre, and lived by doing odd jobs wherever
he could find them. He led a pitiful existence. Three times, he
obtained regular employment, only to be recognized and then discharged.
Sometimes, he had an idea that men were following him&mdash;detectives,
no doubt, who were seeking to trap and denounce him. He could
almost feel the strong hand of the law clutching him by the collar.</p>

<p>One evening, as he was eating his dinner at a neighboring restaurant,
a man entered and took a seat at the same table. He was a person
about forty years of age, and wore a frock-coat of doubtful cleanliness.
He ordered soup, vegetables, and a bottle of wine. After he had
finished his soup, he turned his eyes on Danègre, and gazed at
him intently. Danègre winced. He was certain that this was one
of the men who had been following him for several weeks. What
did he want? Danègre tried to rise, but failed. His limbs refused
to support him. The man poured himself a glass of wine, and then
filled Danègre’s glass. The man raised his glass, and said:</p>

<p>"To your health, Victor Danègre."</p>

<p>Victor started in alarm, and stammered:</p>

<p>"I!....I!.... no, no....I swear to you...."</p>

<p>"You will swear what? That you are not yourself? The servant
of the countess?"</p>

<p>"What servant? My name is Dufour. Ask the proprietor."</p>

<p>"Yes, Anatole Dufour to the proprietor of this restaurant, but
Victor Danègre to the officers of the law."</p>

<p>"That’s not true! Some one has lied to you."</p>

<p>The new-comer took a card from his pocket and handed it to Victor,
who read on it: "Grimaudan, ex-inspector of the detective force.
Private business transacted." Victor shuddered as he said:</p>

<p>"You are connected with the police?"</p>

<p>"No, not now, but I have a liking for the business and I continue
to work at it in a manner more&mdash;profitable. From time to time
I strike upon a golden opportunity&mdash;such as your case presents."</p>

<p>"My case?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yours. I assure you it is a most promising affair, provided
you are inclined to be reasonable."</p>

<p>"But if I am not reasonable?"</p>

<p>"Oh! my good fellow, you are not in a position to refuse me anything
I may ask."</p>

<p>"What is it.... you want?" stammered Victor, fearfully.</p>

<p>"Well, I will inform you in a few words. I am sent by Mademoiselle
de Sinclèves, the heiress of the Countess d’Andillot."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To recover the black pearl."</p>

<p>"Black pearl?"</p>

<p>"That you stole."</p>

<p>"But I haven’t got it."</p>

<p>"You have it."</p>

<p>"If I had, then I would be the assassin."</p>

<p>"You are the assassin."</p>

<p>Danègre showed a forced smile.</p>

<p>"Fortunately for me, monsieur, the Assizecourt was not of your
opinion. The jury returned an unanimous verdict of acquittal.
And when a man has a clear conscience and twelve good men in his
favor&mdash;"</p>

<p>The ex-inspector seized him by the arm and said:</p>

<p>"No fine phrases, my boy. Now, listen to me and weigh my words
carefully. You will find they are worthy of your consideration.
Now, Danègre, three weeks before the murder, you abstracted the
cook’s key to the servants’ door, and had a duplicate key made
by a locksmith named Outard, 244 rue Oberkampf."</p>

<p>"It’s a lie&mdash;it’s a lie!" growled Victor. "No person has seen
that key. There is no such key."</p>

<p>"Here it is."</p>

<p>After a silence, Grimaudan continued:</p>

<p>"You killed the countess with a knife purchased by you at the
Bazar de la Republique on the same day as you ordered the duplicate
key. It has a triangular blade with a groove running from end
to end."</p>

<p>"That is all nonsense. You are simply guessing at something you
don’t know. No one ever saw the knife."</p>

<p>"Here it is."</p>

<p>Victor Danègre recoiled. The ex-inspector continued:</p>

<p>"There are some spots of rust upon it. Shall I tell you how they
came there?"</p>

<p>"Well!.... you have a key and a knife. Who can prove that they
belong to me?"</p>

<p>"The locksmith, and the clerk from whom you bought the knife.
I have already refreshed their memories, and, when you confront
them, they cannot fail to recognize you."</p>

<p>His speech was dry and hard, with a tone of firmness and precision.
Danègre was trembling with fear, and yet he struggled desperately
to maintain an air of indifference.</p>

<p>"Is that all the evidence you have?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, not at all. I have plenty more. For instance, after
the crime, you went out the same way you had entered. But, in
the centre of the wardrobe-room, being seized by some sudden fear,
you leaned against the wall for support."</p>

<p>"How do you know that? No one could know such a thing," argued
the desperate man.</p>

<p>"The police know nothing about it, of course. They never think
of lighting a candle and examining the walls. But if they had
done so, they would have found on the white plaster a faint red
spot, quite distinct, however, to trace in it the imprint of your
thumb which you had pressed against the wall while it was wet
with blood. Now, as you are well aware, under the Bertillon system,
thumb-marks are one of the principal means of identification."</p>

<p>Victor Danègre was livid; great drops of perspiration rolled
down his face and fell upon the table. He gazed, with a wild look,
at the strange man who had narrated the story of his crime as
faithfully as if he had been an invisible witness to it. Overcome
and powerless, Victor bowed his head. He felt that it was useless
to struggle against this marvelous man. So he said:</p>

<p>"How much will you give me, if I give you the pearl?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh! you are joking! Or do you mean that I should give you an
article worth thousands and hundreds of thousands and get nothing
in return?"</p>

<p>"You will get your life. Is that nothing?"</p>

<p>The unfortunate man shuddered. Then Grimaudan added, in a milder
tone:</p>

<p>"Come, Danègre, that pearl has no value in your hands. It is
quite impossible for you to sell it; so what is the use of your
keeping it?"</p>

<p>"There are pawnbrokers.... and, some day, I will be able to get
something for it."</p>

<p>"But that day may be too late."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because by that time you may be in the hands of the police,
and, with the evidence that I can furnish&mdash;the knife, the key,
the thumb-mark&mdash;what will become of you?"</p>

<p>Victor rested his head on his hands and reflected. He felt that
he was lost, irremediably lost, and, at the same time, a sense
of weariness and depression overcame him. He murmured, faintly:</p>

<p>"When must I give it to you?"</p>

<p>"To-night&#11834;within an hour."</p>

<p>"If I refuse?"</p>

<p>"If you refuse, I shall post this letter to the Procureur of
the Republic; in which letter Mademoiselle de Sinclèves denounces
you as the assassin."</p>

<p>Danègre poured out two glasses of wine which he drank in rapid
succession, then, rising, said:</p>

<p>"Pay the bill, and let us go. I have had enough of the cursed
affair."</p>

<p>Night had fallen. The two men walked down the rue Lepic and followed
the exterior boulevards in the direction of the Place de l’Etoile.
They pursued their way in silence; Victor had a stooping carriage
and a dejected face. When they reached the Parc Monceau, he said:</p>

<p>"We are near the house."</p>

<p>"Parbleu! You only left the house once, before your arrest, and
that was to go to the tobacco-shop."</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Danègre, in a dull voice.</p>

<p>They passed along the garden wall of the countess’ house, and
crossed a street on a corner of which stood the tobacco-shop.
A few steps further on, Danègre stopped; his limbs shook beneath
him, and he sank to a bench.</p>

<p>"Well! what now?" demanded his companion.</p>

<p>"It is there."</p>

<p>"Where? Come, now, no nonsense!"</p>

<p>"There&mdash;in front of us."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Between two paving-stones."</p>

<p>"Which?"</p>

<p>"Look for it."</p>

<p>"Which stones?"</p>

<p>Victor made no reply.</p>

<p>"Ah; I see!" exclaimed Grimaudan, "you want me to pay for the
information."</p>

<p>"No.... but....I am afraid I will starve to death."</p>

<p>"So! that is why you hesitate. Well, I’ll not be hard on you.
How much do you want?"</p>

<p>"Enough to buy a steerage pass to America."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"And a hundred francs to keep me until I get work there."</p>

<p>"You shall have two hundred. Now, speak."</p>

<p>"Count the paving-stones to the right from the sewer-hole. The
pearl is between the twelfth and thirteenth."</p>

<p>"In the gutter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, close to the sidewalk."</p>

<p>Grimaudan glanced around to see if anyone were looking. Some
tram-cars and pedestrians were passing. But, bah, they will not
suspect anything. He opened his pocketknife and thrust it between
the twelfth and thirteenth stones.</p>

<p>"And if it is not there?" he said to Victor.</p>

<p>"It must be there, unless someone saw me stoop down and hide
it."</p>

<p>Could it be possible that the back pearl had been cast into the
mud and filth of the gutter to be picked up by the first comer?
The black pearl&mdash;a fortune!</p>

<p>"How far down?" he asked.</p>

<p>"About ten centimetres."</p>

<p>He dug up the wet earth. The point of his knife struck something.
He enlarged the hole with his finger. Then he abstracted the black
pearl from its filthy hiding-place.</p>

<p>"Good! Here are your two hundred francs. I will send you the
ticket for America."</p>

<p>On the following day, this article was published in the ‘Echo
de France,’ and was copied by the leading newspapers throughout
the world:</p>

<p>  "Yesterday, the famous black pearl came into the possession
of   Arsène Lupin, who recovered it from the murderer of the Countess  
d’Andillot.  In a short time, fac-similes of that precious jewel  
will be exhibited in London, St. Petersburg, Calcutta, Buenos
Ayres   and New York.</p>

<p>  "Arsène Lupin will be pleased to consider all propositions  
submitted to him through his agents."</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>"And that is how crime is always punished and virtue rewarded,"
said Arsène Lupin, after he had told me the foregoing history
of the black pearl.</p>

<p>"And that is how you, under the assumed name of Grimaudan, ex-inspector
of detectives, were chosen by fate to deprive the criminal of
the benefit of his crime."</p>

<p>"Exactly. And I confess that the affair gives me infinite satisfaction
and pride. The forty minutes that I passed in the apartment of
the Countess d’Andillot, after learning of her death, were the
most thrilling and absorbing moments of my life. In those forty
minutes, involved as I was in a most dangerous plight, I calmly
studied the scene of the murder and reached the conclusion that
the crime must have been committed by one of the house servants.
I also decided that, in order to get the pearl, that servant must
be arrested, and so I left the wainscoat button; it was necessary,
also, for me to hold some convincing evidence of his guilt, so
I carried away the knife which I found upon the floor, and the
key which I found in the lock. I closed and locked the door, and
erased the finger-marks from the plaster in the wardrobe-closet.
In my opinion, that was one of those flashes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of genius," I said, interrupting.</p>

<p>"Of genius, if you wish. But, I flatter myself, it would not
have occurred to the average mortal. To frame, instantly, the
two elements of the problem&mdash;an arrest and an acquittal; to make
use of the formidable machinery of the law to crush and humble
my victim, and reduce him to a condition in which, when free,
he would be certain to fall into the trap I was laying for him!"</p>

<p>"Poor devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poor devil, do you say? Victor Danègre, the assassin! He might
have descended to the lowest depths of vice and crime, if he had
retained the black pearl. Now, he lives! Think of that: Victor
Danègre is alive!"</p>

<p>"And you have the black pearl."</p>

<p>He took it out of one of the secret pockets of his wallet, examined
it, gazed at it tenderly, and caressed it with loving fingers,
and sighed, as he said:</p>

<p>"What cold Russian prince, what vain and foolish rajah may some
day possess this priceless treasure! Or, perhaps, some American
millionaire is destined to become the owner of this morsel of
exquisite beauty that once adorned the fair bosom of Leontine
Zalti, the Countess d’Andillot."</p>
