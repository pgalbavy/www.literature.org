<p>“Aziz, are you awake?”
</p>
<p>“No, so let us have a talk; let us dream plans for the future.”
</p><p>“I am useless at dreaming.”
</p><p>“Good night then, dear fellow.”
</p><p>The Victory Banquet was over, and the revellers lay on the roof of
plain Mr. Zulfiqar’s mansion, asleep, or gazing through mosquito
nets at the stars. Exactly above their heads hung the constellation
of the Lion, the disc of Regulus so large and bright that it
resembled a tunnel, and when this fancy was accepted all the other
stars seemed tunnels too.
</p><p>“Are you content with our day’s work, Cyril?” the voice on his left
continued.
</p><p>“Are you?”
</p><p>“Except that I ate too much. ‘How is stomach, how head?’—I say,
Panna Lal and Callendar ’ll get the sack.”
</p><p>“There’ll be a general move at Chandrapore.”
</p><p>“And you’ll get promotion.”
</p><p>“They can’t well move me down, whatever their feelings.”
</p><p>“In any case we spend our holidays together, and visit Kashmir,
possibly Persia, for I shall have plenty of money. Paid to me on
account of the injury sustained by my character,” he explained with
cynical calm. “While with me you shall never spend a single pie.
This is what I have always wished, and as the result of my
misfortunes it has come.”
</p><p>“You have won a great victory . . .” began Fielding.
</p><p>“I know, my dear chap, I know; your voice need not become so solemn
and anxious. I know what you are going to say next: Let, oh let
Miss Quested off paying, so that the English may say, ‘Here is a
native who has actually behaved like a gentleman; if it was not
for his black face we would almost allow him to join our club.’
The approval of your compatriots no longer interests me, I have
become anti-British, and ought to have done so sooner, it would
have saved me numerous misfortunes.”
</p><p>“Including knowing me.”
</p><p>“I say, shall we go and pour water on to Mohammed Latif’s face? He
is so funny when this is done to him asleep.”
</p><p>The remark was not a question but a full-stop. Fielding accepted
it as such and there was a pause, pleasantly filled by a little
wind which managed to brush the top of the house. The banquet,
though riotous, had been agreeable, and now the blessings of
leisure—unknown to the West, which either works or idles—descended
on the motley company. Civilization strays about like a ghost here,
revisiting the ruins of empire, and is to be found not in great
works of art or mighty deeds, but in the gestures well-bred Indians
make when they sit or lie down. Fielding, who had dressed up in
native costume, learnt from his excessive awkwardness in it that
all his motions were makeshifts, whereas when the Nawab Bahadur
stretched out his hand for food or Nureddin applauded a song,
something beautiful had been accomplished which needed no
development. This restfulness of gesture—it is the Peace that
passeth Understanding, after all, it is the social equivalent of
Yoga. When the whirring of action ceases, it becomes visible, and
reveals a civilization which the West can disturb but will never
acquire. The hand stretches out for ever, the lifted knee has the
eternity though not the sadness of the grave. Aziz was full of
civilization this evening, complete, dignified, rather hard, and
it was with diffidence that the other said: “Yes, certainly you
must let off Miss Quested easily. She must pay all your costs, that
is only fair, but do not treat her like a conquered enemy.”
</p><p>“Is she wealthy? I depute you to find out.”
</p><p>“The sums mentioned at dinner when you all got so excited—they
would ruin her, they are perfectly preposterous. Look here . . .”
</p><p>“I am looking, though it gets a bit dark. I see Cyril Fielding to
be a very nice chap indeed and my best friend, but in some ways a
fool. You think that by letting Miss Quested off easily I shall
make a better reputation for myself and Indians generally. No, no.
It will be put down to weakness and the attempt to gain promotion
officially. I have decided to have nothing more to do with British
India, as a matter of fact. I shall seek service in some Moslem
State, such as Hyderabad, Bhopal, where Englishmen cannot insult
me any more. Don’t counsel me otherwise.”
</p><p>“In the course of a long talk with Miss Quested . . .”
</p><p>“I don’t want to hear your long talks.”
</p><p>“Be quiet. In the course of a long talk with Miss Quested I have
begun to understand her character. It’s not an easy one, she being
a prig. But she is perfectly genuine and very brave. When she saw
she was wrong, she pulled herself up with a jerk and said so. I
want you to realize what that means. All her friends around her,
the entire British Raj pushing her forward. She stops, sends the
whole thing to smithereens. In her place I should have funked it.
But she stopped, and almost did she become a national heroine, but
my students ran us down a side street before the crowd caught
flame. Do treat her considerately. She really mustn’t get the worst
of both worlds. I know what all these”—he indicated the shrouded
forms on the roof—“will want, but you mustn’t listen to them. Be
merciful. Act like one of your six Mogul Emperors, or all the six
rolled into one.”
</p><p>“Not even Mogul Emperors showed mercy until they received an
apology.”
</p><p>“She’ll apologize if that’s the trouble,” he cried, sitting up.
“Look, I’ll make you an offer. Dictate to me whatever form of words
you like, and this time to-morrow I’ll bring it back signed. This
is not instead of any public apology she may make you in law. It’s
an addition.”
</p><p>“‘Dear Dr. Aziz, I wish you had come into the cave; I am an awful
old hag, and it is my last chance.’ Will she sign that?”
</p><p>“Well good night, good night, it’s time to go to sleep, after
that.”
</p><p>“Good night, I suppose it is.”
</p><p>“Oh, I wish you wouldn’t make that kind of remark,” he continued
after a pause. “It is the one thing in you I can’t put up with.”
</p><p>“I put up with all things in you, so what is to be done?”
</p><p>“Well, you hurt me by saying it; good night.”
</p><p>There was silence, then dreamily but with deep feeling the voice
said: “Cyril, I have had an idea which will satisfy your tender
mind: I shall consult Mrs. Moore.” Opening his eyes, and beholding
thousands of stars, he could not reply, they silenced him.
</p><p>“Her opinion will solve everything; I can trust her so absolutely.
If she advises me to pardon this girl, I shall do so. She will
counsel me nothing against my real and true honour, as you might.”
</p><p>“Let us discuss that to-morrow morning.”
</p><p>“Is it not strange? I keep on forgetting she has left India. During
the shouting of her name in court I fancied she was present. I had
shut my eyes, I confused myself on purpose to deaden the pain. Now
this very instant I forgot again. I shall be obliged to write. She
is now far away, well on her way towards Ralph and Stella.”
</p><p>“To whom?”
</p><p>“To those other children.”
</p><p>“I have not heard of other children.”
</p><p>“Just as I have two boys and a girl, so has Mrs. Moore. She told
me in the mosque.”
</p><p>“I knew her so slightly.”
</p><p>“I have seen her but three times, but I know she is an Oriental.”
</p><p>“You are so fantastic. . . . Miss Quested, you won’t treat her
generously; while over Mrs. Moore there is this elaborate chivalry.
Miss Quested anyhow behaved decently this morning, whereas the old
lady never did anything for you at all, and it’s pure conjecture
that she would have come forward in your favour, it only rests on
servants’ gossip. Your emotions never seem in proportion to their
objects, Aziz.”
</p><p>“Is emotion a sack of potatoes, so much the pound, to be measured
out? Am I a machine? I shall be told I can use up my emotions by
using them, next.”
</p><p>“I should have thought you could. It sounds common sense. You can’t
eat your cake and have it, even in the world of the spirit.”
</p><p>“If you are right, there is no point in any friendship; it all
comes down to give and take, or give and return, which is
disgusting, and we had better all leap over this parapet and kill
ourselves. Is anything wrong with you this evening that you grow
so materialistic?”
</p><p>“Your unfairness is worse than my materialism.”
</p><p>“I see. Anything further to complain of?” He was good-tempered and
affectionate but a little formidable. Imprisonment had made channels
for his character, which would never fluctuate as widely now as in
the past. “Because it is far better you put all your difficulties
before me, if we are to be friends for ever. You do not like Mrs.
Moore, and are annoyed because I do; however, you will like her in
time.”
</p><p>When a person, really dead, is supposed to be alive, an unhealthiness
infects the conversation. Fielding could not stand the tension any
longer and blurted out: “I’m sorry to say Mrs. Moore’s dead.”
</p><p>But Hamidullah, who had been listening to all their talk, and did
not want the festive evening spoilt, cried from the adjoining bed:
“Aziz, he is trying to pull your leg; don’t believe him, the
villain.”
</p><p>“I do not believe him,” said Aziz; he was inured to practical
jokes, even of this type.
</p><p>Fielding said no more. Facts are facts, and everyone would learn
of Mrs. Moore’s death in the morning. But it struck him that people
are not really dead until they are felt to be dead. As long as
there is some misunderstanding about them, they possess a sort of
immortality. An experience of his own confirmed this. Many years
ago he had lost a great friend, a woman, who believed in the
Christian heaven, and assured him that after the changes and
chances of this mortal life they would meet in it again. Fielding
was a blank, frank atheist, but he respected every opinion his
friend held: to do this is essential in friendship. And it seemed
to him for a time that the dead awaited him, and when the illusion
faded it left behind it an emptiness that was almost guilt: “This
really is the end,” he thought, “and I gave her the final blow.”
He had tried to kill Mrs. Moore this evening, on the roof of the
Nawab Bahadur’s house; but she still eluded him, and the atmosphere
remained tranquil. Presently the moon rose—the exhausted crescent
that precedes the sun—and shortly after men and oxen began their
interminable labour, and the gracious interlude, which he had tried
to curtail, came to its natural conclusion.
