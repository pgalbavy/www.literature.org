<P>
Mr. Fentolin sat for a moment in his chair with immovable face.
Then he pointed to the door, which Gerald had left open behind him.
<P>
"Close that door, Gerald."
<P>
The boy obeyed.  Mr. Fentolin waited until he had turned around
again.
<P>
"Come and stand over here by the side of the table," he directed.
<P>
Gerald came without hesitation.  He stood before his uncle with
folded arms.  There was something else besides sullenness in his
face this morning, something which Mr. Fentolin was quick to
recognise.
<P>
"I do not quite understand the nature of your question, Gerald,"
Mr. Fentolin began.  "It is unlike you.  You do not seem yourself.
Is there anything in particular the matter?"
<P>
"Only this," Gerald answered firmly.  "I don't understand why this
naval fellow should come here and ask you to close up your wireless
because secrets have been leaking out, and a few moments afterwards
you should be picking up a message and telephoning to London
information which was surely meant to be private.  That's all.
I've come to ask you about it."
<P>
"You heard the message, then?"
<P>
"I did."
<P>
"You listened - at the keyhole?"
<P>
"I listened outside," Gerald assented doggedly.  "I am glad I
listened.  Do you mind answering my question?
<P>
"Do I mind!" Mr. Fentolin repeated softly.  "Really, Gerald, your
politeness, your consideration, your good manners, astound me.  I
am positively deprived of the power of speech."
<P>
"I'll wait here till it comes to you again, then," the boy declared
bluntly.  "I've waited on you hand and foot, done dirty work for
you, put up with your ill-humours and your tyranny, and never
grumbled.  But there is a limit!  You've made a poor sort of
creature of me, but even the worm turns, you know.  When it comes
to giving away secrets about the movements of our navy at a time
when we are almost at war, I strike."
<P>
"Melodramatic, almost dramatic, but, alas!  so inaccurate," Mr.
Fentolin sighed.  "Is this a fit of the heroics, boy, or what has
come over you?  Have you by any chance - forgotten?"
<P>
Mr. Fentolin's voice seemed suddenly to have grown in volume.  His
eyes dilated, he himself seemed to have grown in size.  Gerald
stepped a little back.  He was trembling, but his expression had
not changed.
<P>
"No, I haven't forgotten.  There's a great debt we are doing our
best to pay, but there's such a thing as asking top much, there's
such a thing as drawing the cords to snapping point.  I'm speaking
for Esther and mother as well as myself.  We have been your slaves;
in a way I suppose we are willing to go on being your slaves.  It's
the burden that Fate has placed around our necks, and we'll go
through with it.  All I want to point out is that there are limits,
and it seems to me that we are up against them now."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin nodded.  He had the air of a man who wishes to be
reasonable.
<P>
"You are very young, my boy," he said, "very young indeed.  Perhaps
that is my fault for not having let you see more of the world.  You
have got some very queer ideas into your head.  A little too much
novel reading lately, eh?  I might treat you differently.  I might
laugh at you and send you out of the room.  I won't.  I'll tell you
what you ask.  I'll explain what you find so mysterious.  The person
to whom I have been speaking is my stockbroker."
<P>
"Your stockbroker!" Gerald exclaimed.
<P>
Mr. Fentolin nodded.
<P>
"Mr.  Bayliss," he continued, "of the firm of Bayliss, Hundercombe
& Dunn, Throgmorton Court.  Mr.  Bayliss is a man of keen
perceptions.  He understands exactly the effect of certain classes
of news upon the market.  The message which I have just sent to him
is practically common property.  It will be in the Daily Mail
to-morrow morning.  The only thing is that I have sent it to him
just a few minutes sooner than any one else can get it.  There is a
good deal of value in that, Gerald.  I do not mind telling you that
I have made a large fortune through studying the political situation
and securing advance information upon matters of this sort.  That
fortune some day will probably be yours.  It will be you who will
benefit.  Meanwhile, I am enriching myself and doing no one any harm."
<P>
"But how do you know," Gerald persisted, "that this message would
ever have found its way to the Press?  It was simply a message from
one battleship to another.  It was not intended to be picked up on
land.  There is no other installation but ours that could have picked
it up.  Besides, it was in code.  I know that you have the code, but
the others haven't."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin yawned slightly.
<P>
"Ingenious, my dear Gerald, but inaccurate.  You do not know that
the message was in code, and in any case it was liable to be picked
up by any steamer within the circle.  You really do treat me, my boy,
rather as though I were a weird, mischief-making person with a
talent for intrigue and crime of every sort.  Look at your suspicions
last night.  I believe that you and Mr. Hamel had quite made up your
minds that I meant evil things for Mr. John P. Dunster.  Well, I had
my chance.  You saw him depart."
<P>
"What about his papers?"
<P>
"I will admit," Mr. Fentolin replied, "that I read his papers.  They
were of no great consequence, however, and he has taken them away
with him.  Mr. Dunster.  as a matter of fact, turned out to be
rather a mare's-nest.  Now, come, since you are here, finish
everything you have to say to me.  I am not angry.  I am willing to
listen quite reasonably."
<P>
Gerald shook his head.
<P>
"Oh, I can't!" he declared bitterly.  "You always get the best of it.
I'll only ask you one more question.  Are you having the wireless
hauled down?"
<P>
Mr. Fentolin pointed out of the window.  Gerald followed his finger.
Three men were at work upon the towering spars.
<P>
"You see," Mr. Fentolin continued tolerantly, "that I am keeping my
word to Lieutenant Godfrey.  You are suffering from a little too
much imagination, I am afraid.  It is really quite a good fault.
By-the-by, how do you get on with our friend Mr. Hamel?"
<P>
"Very well," the boy replied.  "I haven't seen much of him."
<P>
"He and Esther are together a great deal, eh?" Mr. Fentolin asked
quickly.
<P>
"They seem to be quite friendly."
<P>
"It isn't Mr. Hamel, by any chance, who has been putting these
ideas into your head?"
<P>
"No one has been putting any ideas into my head," Gerald answered
hotly.  "It's simply what I've seen and overheard.  It's simply
what I feel around, the whole atmosphere of the place, the whole
atmosphere you seem to create around you with these brutes Sarson
and Meekins; and those white-faced, smooth-tongued Marconi men of
yours, who can't talk decent English; and the post-office man, who
can't look you in the face; and Miss Price, who looks as though
she were one of the creatures, too, of your torture chamber.
That's all."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin waited until he had finished.  Then be waved him away.
<P>
"Go and take a long walk, Gerald," he advised.  "Fresh air is what
you need, fresh air and a little vigorous exercise.  Run along now
and send Miss Price to me."
<P>
Gerald overtook Hamel upon the stairs.
<P>
"By this time," the latter remarked, "I suppose that our friend
Mr. Dunster is upon the sea."
<P>
Gerald nodded silently.  They passed along the corridor.  The door
of the room which Mr. Dunster had occupied was ajar.  As though by
common consent, they both stopped and looked in.  The windows were
all wide open, the bed freshly made.  The nurse was busy collecting
some medicine bottles and fragments of lint.  She looked at them in
surprise.
<P>
"Mr. Dunster has left, sir," she told them.
<P>
"We saw him go," Gerald replied.
<P>
"Rather a quick recovery, wasn't it, nurse?" Hamel asked.
<P>
"It wasn't a recovery at all, sir," the woman declared sharply.
"He'd no right to have been taken away.  It's my opinion Doctor
Sarson ought to be ashamed of himself to have permitted it."
<P>
"They couldn't exactly make a prison of the place, could they?"
Hamel pointed out.  "The man, after all, was only a guest."
<P>
"That's as it may be, sir," the nurse replied.  "All the same, those
that won't obey their doctors aren't fit to be allowed about alone.
That's the way I look at it."
<P>
Mrs. Fentolin was passing along the corridor as they issued from
the room.  She started a little as she saw them.
<P>
"What have you two been doing in there?" she asked quickly.
<P>
"We were just passing," Hamel explained.  "We stopped for a moment
to speak to the nurse."
<P>
"Mr. Dunster has gone," she said.  "You saw him go, Gerald.  You
saw him, too, didn't you, Mr. Hamel?"
<P>
"I certainly did," Hamel admitted.
<P>
Mrs.  Fentolin pointed to the great north window near which they
were standing, through which the clear sunlight streamed a little
pitilessly upon her worn face and mass of dyed hair.
<P>
"You ought neither of you to be indoors for a minute on a morning
like this," she declared.  "Esther is waiting for you in the car,
I think, Mr. Hamel."
<P>
Gerald passed on up the stairs to his room, but Hamel lingered.
A curious impulse of pity towards his hostess stirred him.  The
morning sunlight seemed to have suddenly revealed the tragedy of
her life.  She stood there, a tired, worn woman, with the burden
heavy upon her shoulders.
<P>
"Why not come out with Miss Fentolin and me? he suggested.  "We
could lunch at the Golf Club, out on the balcony.  I wish you
would.  Can't you manage it?"
<P>
She shook her head.
<P>
"Thank you very much," she said.  "Mr. Fentolin does not like
to be left."
<P>
Something in the finality of her words seemed to him curiously
eloquent of her state of mind.  She did not move on.  She seemed,
indeed, to have the air of one anxious to say more.  In that
ruthless light, the advantages of her elegant clothes and
graceful carriage were suddenly stripped away from her.  She was
the abject wreck of a beautiful woman, wizened, prematurely aged.
Nothing remained but the eyes, which seemed somehow to have their
message for him.
<P>
"Mr. Fentolin is a little peculiar, you know," she went on, her
voice shaking slightly with the effort she was making to keep it
low.  "He allows Esther so little liberty, she sees so few young
people of her own age.  I do not know why he allows you to be with
her so much.  Be careful, Mr. Hamel."
<P>
Her voice seemed suddenly to vibrate with a curious note of
suppressed fear.  Almost as she finished her speech, she passed on.
Her little gesture bade him remain silent.  As she went up the
stairs, she began to hum scraps of a little French air.
