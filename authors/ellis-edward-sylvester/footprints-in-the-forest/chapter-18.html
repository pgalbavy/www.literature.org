<p>The spot fixed upon by the Shawanoe was fully a third of a mile
from the camp-fire kindled by the strange Indian. It was in a
hollow, through which ran a small stream of water, and where the
undergrowth and vegetation were so dense that the flames which
were started would not have attracted notice five rods away.</p>

<p>You will remember that it was just such a place as was a favorite
with Deerfoot. It had attracted his notice during the day, while
they were pushing westward, and it was an easy matter for him
to lead the others back to it when the darkness among the trees
was almost impenetrable.</p>

<p>Several facts, more or less pleasant, impressed Jack Carleton.
One was that their camp was so secure from discovery that all
three could sleep without misgiving. Their tramp through the wood
had been conducted with such stealth that it was impossible for
any one to have seen them, and of course it was beyond the power
of an enemy to trail them except by the aid of daylight.</p>

<p>A fact less pleasant, was the absence of provisions. It was a
goodly number of hours since they had eaten, and the Kentuckian
possessed an appetite such as young gentlemen of his age, who
spend much of their time out doors, invariably own. It must not
be supposed that either the Sauk or Shawanoe were deficient in
that respect, but they were used to privation, and seemed to feel
no discomfort. Jack Carleton was sure that Deerfoot often went
without food when he could have secured it, for no other purpose
than that of retaining mastery over himself.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is a good way," muttered the discontented youth,
stretching himself out for the night, "but it don't agree with
my constitution. They needn't think they're going to make me whine,"
he added, with grim resolution. "I'll starve before I'll ask <em>them</em>
for any thing to eat."</p>

<p>He became interested in his companions, however, and, as is the
rule, when the usual hour for eating passed his hunger grew less.</p>

<p>Deerfoot leaned his long bow against the trunk of the nearest
tree, his quiver lying at the base, and assumed an indolent attitude,
his face toward the fire. The upper part of his body was supported
on his left elbow, which held his Bible so that the firelight
fell upon the printed page. The print was small, the light bad,
and it came from the wrong direction, but the strong vision of
the young Shawanoe read it as easily as if under the glare of
the noonday sun.</p>

<p>Half way to the opposite side of the fire was stretched the Sauk,
his posture precisely the same as that of Deerfoot, except that
he rested on his right elbow. Their feet, therefore, were turned
toward each other. His eyes were fixed on the face of the Shawanoe,
who was reading the marvelous volume, and shaping its words into
the tongue which Hay-uta could understand. Eliot, the Indian apostle,
translated the whole Bible, and his work was one of the most striking
ever done by man, but he put into the American tongue those truths
into which he had been trained and with which he had been familiar
for years&mdash;the character of the labor was immeasurably changed
when the interpretation was made by an Indian to one of his own
race.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, as he had done before, would read a verse or two in
a low tone to himself, and then, looking across to his companion,
explain as best he could their meaning. Now and then Hay-uta asked
something, and occasionally Deerfoot faintly smiled as he answered.</p>

<p>The Kentuckian watched the Shawanoe with as much interest as
did the Sauk, and, though his emotions were different, his wonder
and admiration were fully as great.</p>

<p>"He is the most remarkable Indian that ever lived," was the thought
which stirred the heart of Jack Carleton, as it had done many
a time before; "Hay-uta is in the prime of life, larger, stronger,
and he has always been a fighter; he did his best to kill Deerfoot,
but he was vanquished as though he was only a child. A short time
ago they were striking at each other like a couple of wild cats,
and now they are talking about the One who taught men to forgive
their enemies; they would die for each other. It's no use," added
Jack, shutting his lips tight and shaking his head, as was his
habit, when doubt was removed, "there is something in that religion
which can tame a little fury like Deerfoot was, and make savages
as gentle as lambs."</p>

<p>By and by the senses of the youth began to dull, and drowsiness
crept over him. The last recollection was the figures of the two
Indians stretched out in front of the camp-fire, one reading and
the other listening with rapt attention. The hum and murmur of
voices was in his ears when slumber gently closed his eyelids.</p>

<p>His awaking was pleasant. The sun was above the horizon, the
sky was clear and the air was balmy. The warm season was at hand,
but it had not fully set in, and, under the shade of the towering
trees, the coolness was delightful. Birds were singing and the
brightness and cheerfulness which pervaded nature every where
was like that which makes us fling our hats in air and shout for
joy.</p>

<p>Jack appreciated all this, but there was something else which
filled his being with more eager delight. The air was laden with
the odor of broiling fish, and if there is any thing more fragrant
to the senses of a hungry person, I have never been able to learn
what it is.</p>

<p>Leaving the sleeper where he lay on his blanket by the fire,
Hay-uta and Deerfoot had stolen out to the river, from which it
required but a few minutes to coax a number of toothsome fish.
These were cleaned, spitted, and broiled over the coals raked
from the camp-fire.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe had traveled with the Kentuckian long enough to
gauge his appetite accurately, and thus it came about that when
Jack Carleton ceased eating, he had all that he wished, and in
reply to the question of Deerfoot, said he was ready to go through
the day without any thing more.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot," said the youth, placing his hand on his shoulder,
and looking him earnestly in the eye, "where is Otto Relstaub?"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe gave him a reproving glance, as he answered:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot does not know; the Great Spirit has not told him."</p>

<p>"I understand well enough that none knows or can know where the
poor fellow is, nor whether he is alive or dead; but you have
done a good deal of hunting, and, though you found out nothing
yesterday, yet you have formed some theory; what I want to know,
therefore, is your belief."</p>

<p>Deerfoot began examining his bow, as if to assure himself it
was ready for some use which he seemed to think was close at hand.
He gave no answer to the question, and acted as though he had
not heard it. Determined that he should not have such an excuse,
Jack repeated his inquiry with more directness than before.</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe could not ignore him. Pausing a moment in
his inspection of his weapon, he looked gravely at his young friend
and shook his head. Whether he meant to imply that he knew nothing,
had no theory, or believed that Otto was beyond the reach of help,
was left to Jack himself to decide. The action of Deerfoot, however,
proved that he had not yet despaired of the missing youth; for,
without any hesitancy, he announced that they would make their
way to the river again, and crossing over, continue their search
on the other shore.</p>

<p>"There's some comfort in <em>that</em>," was the conclusion of
Jack; "so long as he believes a chance remains, so long shall
I not despair."</p>

<p>The fact that Deerfoot meant to take his friend with him, looked
as though he had decided to push the search a long ways beyond
the river. Jack succeeded at last in drawing from him his belief
that Otto was not in the custody of the party with whom they had
had the difficulty the day previous. That, however, was not an
important admission, for the young Kentuckian had come to the
same belief long before, and it did not help clear up the mystery
as to the whereabouts of the missing boy. Deerfoot went somewhat
further, and expressed the hope, rather than the belief, that
Otto was alive. When Jack asked him whether it was not likely
he had been transferred to the custody of other parties, the Shawanoe
again shook his head, as he did when the same thing was said before.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that he had a theory of his own which
he did not make known even to Hay-uta. Jack could not extract
the least hint, nor could he guess what it was, (and I can not
forbear saying, just here, that, though the Shawanoe was far from
knowing the whole truth, he suspected a part of it, as will appear
all in due time).</p>

<p>The spot where the three had encamped was about a furlong from
the river, and to the latter all three made their way without
special care or haste. Jack Carleton felt complimented that Deerfoot
meant he should bear them company in the renewal of the effort
to find Otto Relstaub.</p>

<p>But a disappointment was at hand. When they reached the stream,
Deerfoot would not cross until after a careful reconnoissance.
He had approached the river at a point above where the Pawnees
held camp the evening before. He meant that if the passage was
effected, it should be without risk of discovery from their enemies.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the situation was a peculiar one in
more than one respect. First of all, there was no reason to believe
the Pawnees were aware that the two strange Indians who created
such a turmoil had recrossed the river, nor was it known that
the hostiles themselves were in the neighborhood. Besides, the
warrior who made Jack prisoner the evening previous was playing
a singular part in the proceedings. There was no telling where
he was at that moment, nor when he would turn up again. Added
to this, was the absolute ignorance about Otto Relstaub. If they
could have gained some inkling of the disposition made of him
(for there could be no doubt that the warriors identified by the
Sauk knew all about it), the hunt could be forced to a conclusion,
one way or the other, within a few hours.</p>

<p>Directing Hay-uta and Jack Carleton to remain for the present
where they were, the Shawanoe said he would swim over and examine
the vicinity, before allowing his friends to join him in the final
search for the lad. This was such a radical change of purpose
that Jack was impatient. He did not hesitate to ask for an explanation;
but he quickly learned that impatience, anger or dictation availed
nothing with the young Shawanoe. He was afraid of no one, and
if he chose to keep his thoughts to himself, it mattered naught
whether it gave pleasure or offense to others.</p>

<p>Before attempting the passage, Deerfoot ranged up and down the
stream for a considerable distance, scrutinizing the belt of open
land on the other shore, and the woods beyond. Not a vestige of
the Pawnees was to be seen. Then he climbed a tree, and from the
top looked off over the country for a space of many miles. He
hoped to detect the faint stains left in the atmosphere by the
camp-fire of the hostiles, but he was disappointed in that also.
Had he not learned the contrary the previous night, he could have
believed that he was the first human being whose feet had ever
pressed that solitude.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was too subtle a woodman to forget any point of
the compass. It was not impossible that the Pawnees, angered by
the indignities and the disappointments they had suffered at the
hands of the young warrior and his companions, had tried to flank
them. They were not all cowards, and though some of them looked
upon the phenomenal youth as an evil spirit, there were others
who must have known him as he was, and who were eager for the
chance to bring him low by means of their rifles.</p>
