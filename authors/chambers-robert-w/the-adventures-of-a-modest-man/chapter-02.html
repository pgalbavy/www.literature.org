<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The second day we ran out of the storm. I remember on that day
that I wore a rather doggy suit of gray&mdash;a trifle too doggy for
a man of my years. In my button-hole reposed a white carnation,
and as I strolled into the smoking-room I was humming under my
breath an air from "Miss Helyet"&mdash;a thing I had not thought of
in twenty years.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word!" exclaimed a man who looked up from his
novel as I entered the doorway. "Gad! You haven't changed in twenty
years!&mdash;except that your moustache is&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Sure! And my temples, Williams! Besides, I have two grown-up
daughters aboard! How are you, anyway, you Latin Quarter come-back?"</p>

<p>We settled ourselves, hands still warmly clasped.</p>

<p>"You're not going back to Paris?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, man, I live there."</p>

<p>"By George, so you do! I forgot."</p>

<p>There was a silence&mdash;that smiling, retrospective silence which
ends inevitably in a sigh not entirely painful.</p>

<p>"Are any of the old men left there?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Some."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I suppose the city has changed a lot. Men who've been
over since, say so."</p>

<p>"It hasn't changed, radically."</p>

<p>"Hasn't it, Williams?" I asked wistfully.</p>

<p>"No. The old caf√© is exactly the same. The Luxembourg Quarter
will seem familiar to you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'm not going there," I said hastily.</p>

<p>He smiled; I could see him doing it, askance. But my features
remained dignified and my attitude detached.</p>

<p>"I wonder," I began carelessly, "whether&#11834;"</p>

<p>"She got married," he said casually; "I'm glad. She was a sweet
little thing."</p>

<p>"She was exceedingly charming," I said, selecting a cigar. "And
the other?"</p>

<p>"Which?"</p>

<p>"I forget her name."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean Delancy's?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't know whatever became of her," he said.</p>

<p>"Whatever became of Delancy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he did what we all usually do&mdash;he came back, married, and
spent the better part of his life in trying to keep his daughter
from marrying that young Harroll."</p>

<p>"Sir Peter's son?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I was a guest at the Delancy's at the time, and I nearly
died. Harroll confided in me, Catharine Delancy confided in me,
John Delancy told me his woes. It's an amusing story. Do you want
to hear it?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead," I said. "My sympathies are already with Delancy.
I've a pair of daughters myself, and I'm trying to shoo away every
sort of man and keep 'em for myself a little longer."</p>

<p>Williams smiled:</p>

<p>"Well, you listen to what those two did to John Delancy. It was
some."</p>

<p>I lit my cigar; he lit his; and I settled back, looking at him
attentively as he began with a wave of his gloved hand, a story
of peculiar interest to a man with two unusually attractive daughters:</p>

<p>Now, although Harroll had been refused a dozen times&mdash;not by
Miss Delancy, but by her father&mdash;the young man's naturally optimistic
spirits suffered only temporary depression; and a few evenings
later he asked for her again, making it a bakers' dozen&mdash;an uncanny
record.</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Delancy.</p>

<p>"Won't you let me have her when I become tenth vice-president
of the Half-Moon Title Guarantee and Trust&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, I won't."</p>

<p>"When will you let me try for her?"</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the young man cheerfully, "there must be some
way, of course."</p>

<p>"Really, Jim, I don't see what way," said Mr. Delancy, without
emotion. "I don't want you for a son-in-law, and I'm not going
to have you. That's one of the reasons I allow you the run of
the house. My daughter sees too much of you to care for you. It's
a theory of my own, and a good one, too."</p>

<p>"Why don't you want me for a son-in-law?" asked the young man,
for the hundredth time.</p>

<p>"Can you give me one single reason why I should want you?" asked
Mr. Delancy wearily.</p>

<p>Harroll stood buried in meditation for a few moments. "No," he
said, "I can't recall any important reasons at the moment."</p>

<p>"I can supply you with one&mdash;your sense of honor&mdash;but it doesn't
count in this case, because you wouldn't be in my house if you
didn't have any."</p>

<p>Harroll looked at the fire.</p>

<p>"I've told you a hundred times that when my little girl marries,
she marries one of her own kind. I don't like Englishmen. And
that is all there is to it, Jim."</p>

<p>"Don't you like me?"</p>

<p>"I'm not infatuated with you."</p>

<p>"Well," said Harroll, slowly pacing the rug in front of the fire,
"it's curious, isn't it?&mdash;but, do you know, I think that I am
going to marry Catharine one of these days?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I think not," replied Mr. Delancy amiably. "And perhaps
this is a good opportunity to say good-by for a while. You know
we go to Palm Beach to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Catharine told me," said the young man, placidly. "So I've wired
for quarters at The Breakers&mdash;for two weeks."</p>

<p>The two men smiled at one another.</p>

<p>"You take your vacation late," said Mr. Delancy.</p>

<p>"Not too late, I trust."</p>

<p>"You think you can afford Palm Beach, Jim?"</p>

<p>"No; but I'm going."</p>

<p>Mr. Delancy rose and stood thoughtfully twirling his monocle
by the string. Then he threw away his cigar, concealed a yawn,
and glanced gravely at the clock on the mantel.</p>

<p>"May I go in and say good-night to Catharine, sir?" asked young
Harroll.</p>

<p>Mr. Delancy looked bored, but nodded civilly enough.</p>

<p>"And, Jim," he drawled, as the young man started toward the drawing-room,
"I wouldn't go to Palm Beach if I were you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you would, sir&mdash;if you were I."</p>

<p>"Young man," said Mr. Delancy, mildly, "I'm damned if I have
you for a son-in-law! Good-night."</p>

<p>They shook hands. Harroll walked into the drawing-room and found
it empty. The music-room, however, was lighted, and Catharine
Delancy sat tucked up in a deep window-seat, studying a map of
southern Florida and feeding bonbons to an enormous white Persian
cat.</p>

<p>"Jim," she said, raising her dark eyes as he sauntered up, "you
and father have lately fallen into the disreputable habit of sitting
behind closed doors and gossiping. You have done it thirteen times
in three months. Don't be such pigs; scandal, like other pleasures,
was meant to be shared."</p>

<p>At a gesture of invitation he seated himself beside her and lifted
the Persian pussy to his lap.</p>

<p>"Well," she inquired, "are you really going with us?"</p>

<p>"I can't go when you do, but I'm going to The Breakers for a
week or two&mdash;solely to keep an eye on your behavior."</p>

<p>"That is jolly!" she said, flushing with pleasure. "Was father
pleased when you told him?"</p>

<p>"He didn't say he was pleased."</p>

<p>"He is always reticent," she said, quickly. "But won't it be
too jolly for words! We'll travel miles and miles together in
bicycle-chairs, and we'll yacht and bathe and ride and golf, and
catch amber-jack and sharks, and&mdash;you'll persuade father to let
me gamble just once at the club&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>"Not much! Where did you hear that sort of talk, Catharine?"</p>

<p>"Don't tweak Omar's tail and I'll tell you&mdash;there! you've done
it again, and I won't tell you."</p>

<p>He fell to stroking the cat's fur, gazing the while into space
with an absent eye that piqued her curiosity. For a year now he
had acquired that trick of suddenly detaching himself from earth
and gazing speculatively toward heaven, lost in a revery far from
flattering to the ignored onlooker. And now he was doing it again
under her very nose. What was he thinking about? He seemed, all
at once, a thousand miles removed from her. Where were his thoughts?</p>

<p>Touched in her <em>amour propre</em>, she quietly resumed the
map of southern Florida; but even the rustle of the paper did
not disturb his self-centred and provoking meditation.</p>

<p>She looked at him, looked at the map, considered him again, and
finally watched him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, for the first time in her life, she thought him dangerously
attractive. Surprised and interested, she regarded him in this
new light, impersonally for the moment. So far away had he apparently
drifted in his meditation that it seemed to her as though she
were observing a stranger&mdash;a most interesting and most unusual
young man.</p>

<p>He turned and looked her straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>Twenty-two, and her first season half over, and to be caught
blushing like a school-girl!</p>

<p>There was no constraint; her self-possession cooled her cheeks&mdash;and
he was not looking at her, after all: he was looking through her,
at something his fancy focused far, far beyond her.</p>

<p>Never had she thought any man half as attractive as this old
friend in a new light&mdash;this handsome, well-built, careless young
fellow absorbed in thoughts which excluded her. No doubt he was
so habituated to herself in all her moods that nothing except
the friendliest indifference could ever&#11834;</p>

<p>To her consternation another tint of warm color slowly spread
over neck and cheek. He rose at the same moment, dropped the cat
back among the cushions, and smiling down at her, held out his
hand. She took it, met his eyes with an effort; but what message
she divined in them Heaven alone knows, for all at once her heart
stood still and a strange thrill left her fingers nerveless in
his hand.</p>

<p>He was saying slowly, "Then I shall see you at Palm Beach next
week?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... You will come, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will come."</p>

<p>"But if you&mdash;change your mind?"</p>

<p>"I never change. May I write you?"</p>

<p>"Good-night.... You may write me if you wish."</p>

<p>"I will write, every day&mdash;if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"No &mdash;I don't mind," she said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand and stood perfectly still as he left the
room. She heard a servant open the door, she heard Harroll's quick
step echo on the stoop, then the door closed.</p>

<p>A second later Mr. Delancy in the library was aroused from complacent
meditation by the swish of a silken skirt, and glancing up, beheld
a tall, prettily formed girl looking at him with a sober and rather
colorless face.</p>

<p>"Father," she said, "I'm in love with Jim Harroll!"</p>

<p>Mr. Delancy groped for his monocle, screwed it into his left
eye, and examined his daughter.</p>

<p>"It's true, and I thought I'd better tell you," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, "it's as well to let me know. Ah&mdash;er&mdash;when
and how did it occur?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, father. I was feeding Omar bonbons and looking
over the map of South Florida, and thinking about nothing in particular,
when Jim came in. He said he was going to Palm Beach, and I said,
'How jolly!' and he sat down and picked up Omar, and &mdash;I
don't know how it was, but I began to think him very attractive,
and the first thing I knew&mdash;it&mdash;happened!"</p>

<p>"Oh! So that's the way it happened?"</p>

<p>"I think it was, father."</p>

<p>"No doubt you'll outgrow it."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"I haven't a doubt of it, little daughter."</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>Mr. Delancy dropped his monocle and looked at the fire. The fire
was all right.</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;do you suppose that Jim is&mdash;does&mdash;thinks&mdash;knows&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I never speculate on what Jim is, does, thinks, or knows," said
her father, thoughtfully, stirring the embers and spoiling a perfectly
good fire. When he looked up again she had gone.</p>

<p>"One theory smashed!" observed Mr. Delancy. "I'll try another,
with separation as the main ingredient."</p>

<p>He sat down before the fire and lighted a fresh cigar, which
wasn't good for him.</p>

<p>"Must avoid making a martyr of Jim or there will be trouble,"
he mused. "There remains another way&mdash;make a martyr of myself."</p>

<p>He sat swinging his monocle around his forefinger, gazing vacantly
at the pattern the shadows cast across the hearth.</p>

<p>"Avalon!" he said, abruptly. "Avalon! The 'back-to-nature' business,
'grass-cure' and all. It can't harm either Catharine or me, I
fancy&mdash;or any other pair of donkeys!"</p>
