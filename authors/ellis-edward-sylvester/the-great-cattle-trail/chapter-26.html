<p>It was singular that Avon Burnet's most humiliating experience
overtook him on his first night in helping to watch his uncle's
herd of cattle, while following the Great Cattle Trail toward
Kansas.</p>

<p>The starting point was so far north in Texas that the first day
carried them close to the Indian Nation, through whose territory
they expected to tramp for several days.</p>

<p>The night, as has been explained, was raw, with a fine, misty
rain and a cutting wind. The youth was seated on his fleet-footed
and intelligent Thunderbolt, with his back to the wind, after
the fashion not only of all cowboys, under such circumstances,
but of the animals themselves, who sometimes drift many miles
before a driving storm.</p>

<p>He had his thick army blanket gathered about his body and shoulders,
and, though the night was dismal and his situation far from pleasant,
it still lacked the discomfort of many hours spent on the vast
plains of the Lone Star State.</p>

<p>The young man had held his position for less than an hour when
the wind changed, veering completely around, so that, instead
of being in front of the herd and edging gradually from it, he
was thrown behind the cattle, for they immediately faced about
and began moving away from him.</p>

<p>The situation of the young herdsman became a delicate one at
once. His proper place was in front, and to reach that point,
he must ride around the animals, and not among them. One of the
many singular features of herding and driving cattle is the wonderful
sensitiveness shown at times by them. While there is nothing extraordinary
in the wild panic often created by a thunderstorm, there are occasions
when a whole herd is stampeded by a cause too trifling to be understood.</p>

<p>Our experience leads us to agree with many veteran cowboys that
the cattle, when lying on the ground asleep, are sometimes troubled
with bad dreams which cause such fright on their part that their
excitement becomes contagious. Then again the electrical conditions
produce a morbid uneasiness among them as well as among men, and
there seem to be times when they are simply awaiting a pretext
for dashing off in uncontrollable panic.</p>

<p>Avon Burnet's fear was that if he rode directly after the cattle,
the sound of his mustang's hoofs would cause alarm, since it was
too dark for them to identify him. A stampede is the terror of
the cowmen's life, and no labor or trouble is too great to avert
it. He, therefore, checked Thunderbolt and waited a few minutes
until the cattle were so far off that he could wheel and gallop
around their flank without frightening them.</p>

<p>When he thought sufficient time had elapsed, he decided to wait
a brief while longer. His dread of a stampede was so strong that
he was unusually careful, but with no thought of shirking any
duty, he twitched the reins of his horse, spoke sharply, and without
touch of spur, was off like an arrow.</p>

<p>Although not an animal was visible, the rider had the contour
of the herd so vividly impressed on his mind that he felt no misgiving,
when he began edging his steed more to the left, and finally brought
him to a stand-still, as he believed, at the very front of the
collection. Indeed, his confidence would not have been greater
had the sun been shining.</p>

<p>But when he halted and listened he failed to hear anything of
them.</p>

<p>"I must have ridden too far ahead," was his conclusion, as he
started his horse on a walk to meet them; "but they are surely
near by."</p>

<p>Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed, and then he drew rein with
an exclamation of amazement, for his keen sense of hearing did
not catch the first sound of the cattle.</p>

<p>"I have lost the herd!" he muttered in dismay, and such was the
fact. His cheeks burned with chagrin at the consciousness of what
at first thought seems an impossible error on the part of man
or youth with any experience in attending cattle.</p>

<p>It was Avon's first mishap of the kind, and he felt as though
he could never face his comrades again, if they should discover
the blunder, which, after all, was not so striking, when the attendant
circumstances are borne in mind.</p>

<p>But if excuse could be accepted for his slip, there was none
for inaction after its discovery. It was not to be supposed that
the animals would set out to hunt him, nor that any knowledge
could be gained of them by idleness. There were other men on duty,
and he shouted at the top of his voice, in the hope of receiving
a response, but there was none.</p>

<p>Slipping from his saddle, he knelt down and placed his ear to
the ground. He fancied he detected faint sounds, such as are made
by multitudinous hoofs on the soft, wet earth, but the noises
were so slight that he could not identify the direction whence
they came, and he hastily climbed into the saddle again.</p>

<p>He realized that he was lost, and well aware that at such times
it is useless to puzzle one's brains about the point of the compass,
he dashed in the direction which seemed to be the right one. Of
course, as in his recent experience, it proved to be wrong, and
he now spurred toward the top of the ridge or hill, which it was
easy to identify under the tread of his mustang. He was confident
that this elevation would yield the key to the situation and he
was not mistaken.</p>

<p>From the crest he observed the starlike glimmer of a lantern,
and no sight, except that of the herd itself, could have been
more welcome. It was the signal suspended every night from the
front bow of the wagon, to guide the men whenever they needed
guidance.</p>

<p>Confident that someone would be found at that point who could
give him the important news he was seeking, Avon rode thither
on a dead run. He saw no one stirring as he galloped up. The cook,
who had charge of the wagon, was asleep, and the men off duty
were slumbering soundly, while the chance was theirs.</p>

<p>But young Burnet had scarcely checked his mustang, when the sound
of someone riding his horse equally fast reached his ear, and
the next instant Oscar Gleeson dashed beside him.</p>

<p>"Howdy, Baby, is that you?" he asked, peering at the young man
dimly seen in the scant yellow rays of the lantern.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ballyhoo," was the reply; "I'm in trouble."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I've lost the herd."</p>

<p>The Texan shook in his saddle with laughter.</p>

<p>"That's me, too; the first thing I knowed they was gone. I yelled
for you, but you couldn't have heard me, and, after cantering
round awhile, I struck for the wagon in quest of news."</p>

<p>Avon drew a sigh of relief, and with a smile:</p>

<p>"I'm glad you lost them, for the boys won't laugh at you, while
they would at me."</p>

<p>"I don't think there's anyone in that crowd that will laugh,
for they all had the same experience. I know Old Bronze and Short
Stop have lost a herd more than once."</p>

<p>"It won't do to stay here," remarked Avon, "for you know there
is another herd only a mile off, and if the two become mixed,
it will be a big job to cut out ours to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," replied Gleeson, "if the cattle have gone
back to the bed-ground; at any rate we'll look for them there."</p>

<p>The return to the wagon enabled the couple to obtain their bearings,
and they knew the proper course to reach the spot, but the possibility
of the theory being wrong caused them to separate, so as to proceed
thither by routes which, while substantially parallel, were so
far apart that they were out of each other's sight and hearing,
the latter being chiefly due to the direction of the wind.</p>

<p>Avon spurred Thunderbolt into an easy canter, the soft grass
making the travel easy, though there was always the risk of his
animal sinking one or more of his hoofs into a hole, with the
prospect of a broken leg for the horse and a dislocated neck for
his rider.</p>

<p>When it seemed to the latter that he had passed the intervening
distance, he drew his mustang to a walk, listening and peering
through the gloom with all the power at his command. There was
no lighting of the darkness, the wind still blew keenly, and the
fine drizzling rain continued.</p>

<p>No sight nor sound came to him, and, once more bringing his animal
to a halt, he dismounted and pressed his ear to the ground.</p>

<p>This time he caught a distinct noise: it was that made by the
hoofs of a horse. He was walking, and was so near that Thunderbolt
pricked his ears and uttered a faint whinny of salutation. Avon
instantly rose to his feet, and remounted.</p>

<p>Looking keenly into the wet darkness, he became aware that a
horse was standing motionless but a short distance off on his
left. In the gloom the outlines could be traced, but so dimly
that he was uncertain whether he had a rider or not. The steed
held his head well up like Thunderbolt, and appeared to be scrutinizing
the youth and his animal with a curiosity equal to theirs.</p>

<p>There was something so impressive in the sight of the statue-like
object, which emitted not the slightest sound, that young Burnet
hesitated whether to advance or to await its approach. The man
could not be Gleeson, and, whoever he was, it was evident that
he regarded Avon with inquiring suspicion.</p>

<p>But unwilling to maintain the trying situation, the latter touched
the neck of his mustang in a way which the animal recognized as
a command to move forward very slowly. He obeyed, and had advanced
but a few short steps when Avon to his astonishment perceived
that the strange horse was without a rider.</p>

<p>"I don't understand that," mused the mystified young man, stopping
his own animal, with several yards separating them; "he must have
an owner, and what can have become of him, and why is&#11834;"</p>

<p>At that instant he observed a suspicious movement, seemingly
from the other side of the steed. Before he could divine its nature,
a rifle was discharged almost in his face and he went off his
mustang like a flash.</p>
