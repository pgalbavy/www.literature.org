<p>The car was quite crowded. There were more people than themselves who
were going to the Fair and were obliged to economize. When the children
entered, and looked about them in the dim light, they thought at first
that all the seats were full. People seemed to be huddled up asleep or
sitting up awake in all of them. Everybody had been trying to get to
sleep, at least, and the twins found themselves making their whispers
even lower than before.
</p>
<p>“I think there is a seat empty just behind that very fat lady,” Meg
whispered.
</p><p>It was at the end of the car, and they went to it, and found she was
right. They took possession of it quietly, putting their satchel under
the seat.
</p><p>“It seems so still,” said Meg, “I feel as if I was in somebody’s
bedroom. The sound of the wheels makes it seem all the quieter. It’s as
if we were shut in by the noise.”
</p><p>“We mustn’t talk,” said Robin, “or we shall waken the people. Can you go
to sleep, Meg?”
</p><p>“I can if I can stop thinking,” she answered, with a joyful sigh. “I’m
very tired; but the wheels keep saying, over and over again, ‘We’re
going—we’re going—we’re going.’ It’s just as if they were talking. Don’t
you hear them?”
</p><p>“Yes, I do. Do they say that to you, too? But we mustn’t listen,” Robin
whispered back. “If we do we shall not go to sleep, and then we shall be
too tired to walk about. Let’s put our heads down, and shut our eyes,
Meg.”
</p><p>“Well, let’s,” said Meg.
</p><p>She curled herself up on the seat, and put her head into the corner.
</p><p>“If you lean against me, Rob,” she said, “it will be softer. We can take
turns.”
</p><p>They changed position a little two or three times, but they were worn
out with the day’s work, and their walk, and the excitement, and the
motion of the train seemed like a sort of rocking which lulled them.
Gradually their muscles relaxed and they settled down, though, after
they had done so, Meg spoke once, drowsily.
</p><p>“Rob,” she said, “did you see that was our man?”
</p><p>“Yes,” answered Rob, very sleepily indeed, “and he looked as if he knew
us.”
</p><hr/>
<p>If they had been less young, or if they had been less tired, they might
have found themselves awake a good many times during the night. But they
were such children, and, now that the great step was taken, were so
happy, that the soft, deep sleepiness of youth descended upon and
overpowered them. Once or twice during the night they stirred, wakened
for a dreamy, blissful moment by some sound of a door shutting, or a
conductor passing through. But they were only conscious of a delicious
sense of strangeness, of the stillness of the car full of sleepers, of
the half-realized delight of feeling themselves carried along through
the unknown country, and of the rattle of the wheels, which never ceased
saying rhythmically, “We’re going—we’re going—we’re going!”
</p><p>Ah! what a night of dreams and new, vague sensations, to be remembered
always! Ah! that heavenly sense of joy to come, and adventure, and young
hopefulness and imagining! Were there many others carried towards the
City Beautiful that night who bore with them the same rapture of longing
and belief; who saw with such innocent clearness only the fair and
splendid thought which had created it, and were so innocently blind to
any shadow of sordidness or mere worldly interest touching its white
walls? And after the passing of this wonderful night, what a wakening in
the morning, at the first rosiness of dawn, when all the other occupants
of the car were still asleep, or restlessly trying to be at ease!
</p><p>It was as if they both wakened at almost the same moment. The first
shaft of early sunlight streaming in the window touched Meg’s eyelids,
and she slowly opened them. Then something joyous and exultant rushed in
upon her heart, and she sat upright. And Robin sat up too, and they
looked at each other.
</p><p>“It’s the Day, Meg!” said Robin. “It’s the Day!” Meg caught her breath.
</p><p>“And nothing has stopped us,” she said. “And we are getting nearer and
nearer. Rob, let us look out of the window.”
</p><p>For a while they looked out, pressed close together, and full of such
ecstasy of delight in the strangeness of everything that at first they
did not exchange even their whispers.
</p><p>It is rather a good thing to see—rather well worth while even for a man
or woman—the day waking, and waking the world, as one is borne swiftly
through the morning light, and one looks out of a car window. What it
was to these two children only those who remember the children who were
themselves long ago can realize at all. The country went hurrying past
them, making curious sudden revelations and giving half-hints in its
haste; prairie and field, farmhouse and wood and village all wore a
strange, exciting, vanishing aspect.
</p><p>“It seems,” Meg said, “as if it was all going somewhere—in a great
hurry—as if it couldn’t wait to let us see it.”
</p><p>“But we are the ones that are going,” said Rob. “Listen to the
wheels—and we shall soon be there.”
</p><p>After a while the people who were asleep began to stir and stretch
themselves. Some of them looked cross, and some looked tired. The very
fat lady in the seat before them had a coal smut on her nose.
</p><p>“Robin,” said Meg, after looking at her seriously a moment, “let’s get
our towel out of the bag and wet it and wash our faces.”
</p><p>They had taken the liberty of borrowing a towel from Aunt Matilda. It
was Meg who had thought of it, and it had, indeed, been an inspiration.
Robin wetted two corners of it, and they made a rigorous if limited
toilet. At least they had no smuts on their noses, and after a little
touching up with the mutual comb and brush, they looked none the worse
for wear. Their plain and substantial garments were not of the order
which has any special charm to lose.
</p><p>“And it’s not our clothes that are going to the Fair,” said Meg, “it’s
<u>us</u>!”
</p><p>And by the time they were in good order, the farms and villages they
were flying past had grown nearer together. The platforms at the dépôts
were full of people who wore a less provincial look; the houses grew
larger and so did the towns; they found themselves flashing past
advertisements of all sorts of things, and especially of things
connected with the Fair.
</p><p>“You know how we used to play ‘hunt the thimble,’” said Robin, “and how,
when any one came near the place where it was hidden, we said,
‘Warm—warmer—warmer still—hot!’ It’s like that now. We have been getting
warmer and warmer every minute, and now we are getting——”
</p><p>“We shall be in in a minute,” said a big man at the end of the car, and
he stood up and began to take down his things.
</p><p>“Hot,” said Robin, with an excited little laugh. “Meg, we’re not
going—going—going any more. Look out of the window.”
</p><p>“We are steaming into the big dépôt,” cried Meg. “How big it is! What
crowds of people! Robin, we are there!”
</p><p>Robin bent down to pick up their satchel; the people all rose in their
seats and began to move in a mass down the aisle toward the door.
Everybody seemed suddenly to become eager and in a hurry, as if they
thought the train would begin to move again and carry them away. Some
were expecting friends to meet them, some were anxious about finding
accommodations. Those who knew each other talked, asked questions over
people’s shoulders, and there was a general anxiety about valises,
parcels, and umbrellas. Robin and Meg were pressed back into their
section by the crowd, against which they were too young to make headway.
</p><p>“We shall have to wait until the grown-up people have passed by,” Rob
said.
</p><p>But the crowd in the aisle soon lost its compactness, and they were able
to get out. The porter, who stood on the platform near the steps, looked
at them curiously, and glanced behind them to see who was with them, but
he said nothing.
</p><p>It seemed to the two as if all the world must have poured itself into
the big dépôt or be passing through it. People were rushing about;
friends were searching for one another, pushing their way through the
surging crowd; some were greeting each other with exclamations and
hand-shaking, and stopping up the way; there was a Babel of voices, a
clamor of shouts within the covered place, and from outside came a roar
of sound rising from the city.
</p><p>For a few moments Robin and Meg were overwhelmed. They did not quite
know what to do; everybody pushed past and jostled them. No one was
ill-natured, but no one had time to be polite. They were so young and so
strange to all such worlds of excitement and rush, involuntarily they
clutched each other’s hands after their time-honored fashion, when they
were near each other and overpowered. The human vortex caught them up
and carried them along, not knowing where they were going.
</p><p>“We seem so little!” gasped Meg. “There—there are so many people! Rob,
Rob, where are we going?”
</p><p>Robin had lost his breath too. Suddenly the world seemed so huge—so
huge! Just for a moment he felt himself turn pale, and he looked at Meg
and saw that she was pale too.
</p><p>“Everybody is going out of the dépôt,” he said.
</p><p>“Hold on to me tight, Meg. It will be all right. We shall get out.”
</p><p>And so they did. The crowd surged and swayed and struggled, and before
long they saw that it was surging towards the entrance gate, and it took
them with it. Just as they thrust through they found themselves pushed
against a man, who good-naturedly drew a little back to save Meg from
striking against his valise, which was a very substantial one. She
looked up to thank him, and gave a little start. It was the man she had
called “our man” the night before, when she spoke of him to Robin. And
he gave them a sharp but friendly nod.
</p><p>“Hallo!” he exclaimed, “it’s you two again. You <u>are</u> going to the
Fair!”
</p><p>Robin looked up at his shrewd face with a civil little grin.
</p><p>“Yes, sir; we are,” he answered.
</p><p>“Hope you’ll enjoy it,” said the man. “Big thing.” And he was pushed
past them and soon lost in the crowd.
