<p>The Herr Regierungsrat was not at first sight prepossessing.  He
was approaching fifty, and had gone stout and rather loose, as so
many men of his class and race do.  Then he wore one of those
dreadful full-bottom coats, a kind of poor relation to our full-
skirted frock-coat: it would best be described as a family coat.
It flapped about him as he walked, and he looked at first glance
lower middle class.</p>

<p>But he wasn't.  Of course, being in office in the collapsed
Austria, he was a republican.  But by nature he was a monarchist,
nay, an imperialist, as every true Austrian is.  And he was a true
Austrian.  And as such he was much finer and subtler than he
looked.  As one got used to him, his rather fat face, with its fine
nose and slightly bitter, pursed mouth, came to have a resemblance
to the busts of some of the late Roman emperors.  And as one was
with him, one came gradually to realize that out of all his baggy
bourgeois appearance came something of a grand geste.  He could not
help it.  There was something sweeping and careless about his soul:
big, rather assertive, and ill-bred-seeming; but, in fact, not ill-
bred at all, only a little bitter and a good deal indifferent to
his surroundings.  He looked at first sight so common and parvenu.
And then one had to realize that he was a member of a big, old
empire, fallen into a sort of epicureanism, and a little bitter.
There was no littleness, no meanness, and no real coarseness.  But
he was a great talker, and relentless towards his audience.</p>

<p>Hannele was attracted to him by his talk.  He began as soon as
dinner appeared: and he went on, carrying the decanter and the
wine-glass with him out on to the balcony of the villa, over the
lake, on and on until midnight.  The summer night was still and
warm: the lake lay deep and full, and the old town twinkled away
across.  There was the faintest tang of snow in the air, from the
great glacier-peaks that were hidden in the night opposite.
Sometimes a boat with a lantern twanged a guitar.  The clematis
flowers were quite black, like leaves, dangling from the terrace.</p>

<p>It was so beautiful, there in the very heart of the Tyrol.  The
hotels glittered with lights: electric light was still cheap.
There seemed a fullness and a loveliness in the night.  And yet for
some reason it was all terrible and devastating: the life-spirit
seemed to be squirming, bleeding all the time.</p>

<p>And on and on talked the Herr Regierungsrat, with all the witty
volubility of the more versatile Austrian.  He was really very
witty, very human, and with a touch of salty cynicism that reminded
one of a real old Roman of the Empire.  That subtle stoicism, that
unsentimental epicureanism, that kind of reckless hopelessness, of
course, fascinated the women.  And particularly Hannele.  He talked
on and on - about his work before the war, when he held an important
post and was one of the governing class - then about the war - then
about the hopelessness of the present: and in it all there seemed a
bigness, a carelessness based on indifference and hopelessness that
laughed at its very self.  The real old Austria had always
fascinated Hannele.  As represented in the witty, bitter-
indifferent Herr Regierungsrat it carried her away.</p>

<p>And he, of course, turned instinctively to her, talking in his
rapid, ceaseless fashion, with a laugh and a pause to drink and a
new start taken.  She liked the sound of his Austrian speech: its
racy carelessness, its salty indifference to standards of
correctness.  Oh yes, here was the grand geste still lingering.</p>

<p>He turned his large breast towards her, and made a quick gesture
with his fat, well-shapen hand, blurted out another subtle, rough-
seeming romance, pursed his mouth, and emptied his glass once more.
Then he looked at his half-forgotten cigar and started again.</p>

<p>There was something almost boyish and impulsive about him: the way
he turned to her, and the odd way he seemed to open his big breast
to her.  And again he seemed almost eternal, sitting there in his
chair with knees planted apart.  It was as if he would never rise
again, but would remain sitting for ever, and talking.  He seemed
as if he had no legs, save to sit with.  As if to stand on his feet
and walk would not be natural to him.</p>

<p>Yet he rose at last, and kissed her hand with the grand gesture
that France or Germany have never acquired: carelessness, profound
indifference to other people's standards, and then such a sudden
stillness, as he bent and kissed her hand.  Of course she felt a
queen in exile.</p>

<p>And perhaps it is more dangerous to feel yourself a queen in exile
than a queen in situ.  She fell in love with him, with this large,
stout, loose widower of fifty, with two children.  He had no money
except some Austrian money that was worth nothing outside Austria.
He could not even go to Germany.  There he was, fixed in this
hollow in the middle of the Tyrol.</p>

<p>But he had an ambition still, old Roman of the decadence that he
was.  He had year by year and without making any fuss collected the
material for a very minute and thorough history of his own
district: the Chiemgau and the Pinzgau.  Hannele found that his
fund of information on this subject was inexhaustible, and his
intelligence was so delicate, so human, and his scope seemed so
wide, that she felt a touch of reverence for him.  He wanted to
write this history.  And she wanted to help him.</p>

<p>For, of course, as things were he would never write it.  He was
Regierungsrat: that is, he was the petty local governor of his town
and immediate district.  The Amthaus was a great old building, and
there young ladies in high heels flirted among masses of papers
with bare-kneed young gentlemen in Tyrolese costume, and
occasionally they parted to take a pleasant, interesting attitude
and write a word or two, after which they fluttered together for a
little more interesting diversion.  It was extraordinary how many
finely built, handsome young people of an age fitted for nothing
but love-affairs ran the governmental business of this department.
And the Herr Regierungsrat sailed in and out of the big, old room,
his wide coat flying like wings and making the papers flutter, his
rather wine-reddened, old-Roman face smiling with its bitter look.
And of course it was a witticism he uttered first, even if Hungary
was invading the frontier or cholera was in Vienna.</p>

<p>When he was on his legs, he walked nimbly, briskly, and his coat-
bottoms always flew.  So he waved through the town, greeting
somebody at every few strides and grinning, and yet with a certain
haughty reserve.  Oh yes, there was a certain salty hauteur about
him which made the people trust him.  And he spoke the vernacular
so racily.</p>

<p>Hannele felt she would like to marry him.  She would like to be
near him.  She would like him to write his history.  She would like
him to make her feel a queen in exile.  No one had ever QUITE
kissed her hand as he kissed it: with that sudden stillness and
strange, chivalric abandon of himself.  How he would abandon
himself to her! - terribly - wonderfully - perhaps a little horribly.
His wife, whom he had married late, had died after seven years of
marriage.  Hannele could understand that too.  One or the other
must die.</p>

<p>She became engaged.  But something made her hesitate before
marriage.  Being in Austria was like being on a wrecked ship that
MUST sink after a certain short length of time.  And marrying the
Herr Regierungsrat was like marrying the doomed captain of the
doomed ship.  The sense of fatality was part of the attraction.</p>

<p>And yet she hesitated.  The summer weeks passed.  The strangers
flooded in and crowded the town, and ate up the food like locusts.
People no longer counted the paper money, they weighed it by the
kilogram.  Peasants stored it in a corner of the meal-bin, and mice
came and chewed holes in it.  Nobody knew where the next lot of
food was going to come from: yet it always came.  And the lake
teemed with bathers.  When the captain arrived he looked with
amazement on the crowds of strapping, powerful fellows who bathed
all day long, magnificent blond flesh of men and women.  No wonder
the old Romans stood in astonishment before the huge blond limbs of
the savage Germana.</p>

<p>Well, the life was like a madness.  The hotels charged fifteen
hundred kronen a day: the women, old and young, paraded in the
peasant costume, in flowery cotton dresses with gaudy, expensive
silk aprons: the men wore the Tyrolese costume, bare knees and
little short jackets.  And for the men, the correct thing was to
have the leathern hose and the blue linen jacket as old as
possible.  If you had a hole in your leathern seat, so much the
better.</p>

<p>Everything so physical.  Such magnificent naked limbs and naked
bodies, and in the streets, in the hotels, everywhere, bare, white
arms of women and bare, brown, powerful knees and thighs of men.
The sense of flesh everywhere, and the endless ache of flesh.  Even
in the peasants who rowed across the lake, standing and rowing with
a slow, heavy, gondolier motion at the one curved oar, there was
the same endless ache of physical yearning.</p>
