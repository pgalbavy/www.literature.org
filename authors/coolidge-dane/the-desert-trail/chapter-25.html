<p>Though the times had turned to war, all nature that morning was at
peace, and they rode through a valley of flowers like knight and lady
in a pageant. The rich grass rose knee-deep along the hillsides, the
desert trees were filigreed with the tenderest green and twined with
morning-glories, and in open glades the poppies and sand-verbenas
spread forth masses of blue and gold.
</p><p>Already on the mesquit-trees the mocking-birds were singing, and bright
flashes of tropical color showed where cardinal and yellow-throat
passed. The dew was still untouched upon the grass, and yet they
hurried on, for some premonition whispered to them of evil, and they
thought only to gain the far pass.
</p><p>To the west and north rose the high and impassable mountain which
had barred their way in the night; across the valley the flat-topped
Fortunas threw their bulwark against the dawn; and all behind was
broken hills and gulches, any one of which might give up armed men.
Far ahead, like a knife-gash between the ridges, lay the pass to the
northern plains, and as their trail swung out into the open they put
spurs to their horses and galloped.
</p><p>Once through that gap, the upper country would lie before them and
they could pick and choose. Now they must depend upon speed and the
chance that their way was not blocked.
</p><p>Somewhere in those hills to the east Bernardo Bravo and his men were
hidden. Or perhaps they were scattered, turned by their one defeat into
roving bandits or vengeful partizans, laying waste the Sonoran ranches
as they fought their way back to Chihuahua. There were a hundred evil
chances that might befall the fugitives, and while Bud scanned the
country ahead Gracia cast anxious glances behind.
</p><p>"They are coming!" she cried at last, as a moving spot appeared in the
rear. "Oh, there they are!"
</p><p>"Good!" breathed Hooker, as he rose in his stirrups and looked.
</p><p>"Why good?" she demanded curiously.
</p><p>"The's only three of 'em," answered Bud. "I was afraid they might be in
front," he explained, as she gazed at him with a puzzled smile.
</p><p>"Yes," she said; "but what will you do if they catch us?"
</p><p>"They won't catch us," replied Hooker confidently. "Not while I've got
my rifle. Aha!" he exclaimed, still looking back, "now we know all
about it--that sorrel is Manuel del Rey's!"
</p><p>"And will you kill him?" challenged Gracia, rousing suddenly at
the name. Hooker pretended not to hear. Instead, he cocked his eye
up at the eastern mountain, whence from time to time came muffled
rifle-shots, and turned his horse to go. There was trouble over there
to the east somewhere--Alvarez and his Yaquis, still harrying the
retreating rebels--and some of it might come their way.
</p><p>"Ah, how I hate that man!" raged Gracia, spurring her horse as she
scowled back at the galloping Del Rey and his men who were riding
onward rapidly.
</p><p>"All right," observed Bud with a quizzical smile, "I'll have to kill
him for you then!"
</p><p>She gazed at him a moment with eyes that were big with questioning, but
the expression on his rugged face baffled her.
</p><p>"I would not forget it," she cried impulsively. "No, after all I have
suffered, I think I could love the man who would meet him face to face!
But why do you--ah!" she cried, with a sudden tragic bitterness. "You
smile! You have no thought for me--you care nothing that I am afraid of
him! Ah, <u>Dios</u>, for a man who is brave--to rid me of this devil!"
</p><p>"Never mind!" returned Bud, his voice thick with rising anger. "If I
kill him it won't be for <u>you</u>!"
</p><p>He jumped Copper Bottom ahead to avoid her, for in that moment she had
touched his pride. Yes, she had done more than that--she had destroyed
a dream he had, a dream of a beautiful woman, always gentle, always
noble, whom he had sworn to protect with his life. Did she think he was
a <u>pelado</u> Mexican, a hot-country lover, to be inflamed by a glance and
a smile? Then Phil could have her!
</p><p>"Ah, Bud!" she appealed, spurring up beside him, "you did not
understand! I know you are brave--and if he comes"--she struck her
pistol fiercely--"I will kill him myself!"
</p><p>"Never mind," answered Bud in a kinder voice. "I'll take care of you.
Jest keep your horse in the trail," he added, as she rode on through
the brush, "and I'll take care of Del Rey."
</p><p>He beckoned her back with a jerk of the head and resumed his place
in the lead. Here was no place to talk about men and motives. The
mountain above was swarming with rebels, there were <u>rurales</u> spurring
behind--yes, even now, far up on the eastern hillside, he could see
armed men--and now one was running to intercept them!
</p><p>Bud reached for his rifle, jacked up a cartridge, and sat crosswise
in his saddle. He rode warily, watching the distant runner, until
suddenly he pulled in his horse and threw up a welcoming hand. The man
was Amigo--no other could come down a hillside so swiftly--and he was
signaling him to wait.
</p><p>"Who is that man?" asked Gracia, as she reined in at his side. "Do you
know him?"
</p><p>"Sure do!" responded Hooker jovially. "He's the best friend I got in
Mexico!
</p><p>"<u>Kai</u>, Amigo!" he hailed, as the Yaqui came quartering down the hill,
and, apparently oblivious of the oncoming pursuers, he rode out of the
trail to meet him. They struck hands and Amigo flashed his familiar
smile, glancing shyly over the horse's back at the daughter of the
Aragons.
</p><p>"I knew horse," he explained, with a gentle caress for Copper Bottom.
"My people--up there--kill Mexicans! Where you go?"
</p><p>"North--to the line," answered Bud, pointing up the pass.
</p><p>"_Muy malo!<u>" frowned the Yaqui, glancing once more at the woman
behind. "</u>Muchos revoltosos!_"
</p><p>"Where?" asked Bud.
</p><p>"Everywhere!" replied Amigo with a comprehensive wave of the hand.
"But no matter," he added simply. "I will go with you. Who are these
horsemen behind?"
</p><p>"_Rurales!_" responded Hooker, and the Yaqui's black eyes dilated.
</p><p>"Yes," nodded Bud as he read the swift question in their glance. "He is
there, too--Del Rey!"
</p><p>"_Que bueno!_" exclaimed the Indian, fixing his eagle glance upon the
riders. He showed his white teeth in a smile. In an instant he saw his
opportunity, he saw his enemy riding into a trap, and turned his face
to the pass.
</p><p>"Come!" he said, laying hold of a <u>l√°tigo</u> strap, and as Hooker loped
on up the steady incline he ran along at his stirrup. In his right
hand he still carried the heavy Mauser, but his sandaled feet bore him
forward with tireless strides, and only the heaving of his mighty chest
told the story of the pace.
</p><p>"Let me take your gun," suggested Hooker, as they set off on their
race, but Amigo in his warrior's pride only shook his head and motioned
him on and on. So at last they gained the rugged summit, where the
granite ribs of the mountain crop up through the sands of the wash and
the valley slopes away to the north. To the south was Del Rey, still
riding after them, but Amigo beckoned Bud beyond the reef and looked
out to the north.
</p><p>"_Revoltosos!<u>" he exclaimed, pointing a sun-blackened hand at a
distant ridge. "</u>Revoltosos!_" he said again, waving his hand to the
east. "Here," waving toward the west, "no!"
</p><p>"Do you know that country?" inquired Hooker, nodding at the great plain
with its chains of parallel Sierras, but the Indian shook his head.
</p><p>"No," he said; "but the best way is straight for that pass."
</p><p>He pointed at a distant wedge cut down between the blue of two ridges,
and scanned the eastern hills intently.
</p><p>"Men!" he cried, suddenly indicating the sky-line of the topmost ridge.
"I think they are <u>revoltosos</u>," he added gravely. "They will soon
cross your trail."
</p><p>"No difference," answered Bud with a smile. "I am not afraid--not with
you here, Amigo."
</p><p>"No, but the woman!" suggested Amigo, who read no jest in his words.
"It is better that you should ride on--and leave me here."
</p><p>He smiled encouragingly, but a wild light was creeping into his eyes
and Hooker knew what he meant. He desired to be left alone, to deal
with Del Rey after the sure manner of the Yaquis. And yet, why not?
Hooker gazed thoughtfully at the oncoming <u>rurales</u> and walked swiftly
back to Gracia.
</p><p>"This Indian is a friend of mine," he said, "and I can trust him. He
says it will be better for us to ride on--and he will take care of the
<u>rurales</u>."
</p><p>"Take care?" questioned Gracia, turning pale at a peculiar
matter-of-fact tone in his voice.
</p><p>"Sure," said Hooker; "he says there are <u>revoltosos</u> ahead. It will be
better for you, he says, to ride on."
</p><p>"_Madre de Dios!_" breathed Gracia, clutching at her saddle; and then
she nodded her head weakly.
</p><p>"You better get down for a minute," suggested Hooker, helping her
quickly to the ground. "Here, drink some water--you're kinder faint.
I'll be right back--jest want to say good-by."
</p><p>He strode over to where Amigo had posted himself behind a rock and laid
a hand on his arm.
</p><p>"_Adios, Amigo!_" he said, but the Yaqui only glanced at him strangely.
</p><p>"Anything in my camp, you are welcome to it," added Hooker, but Amigo
did not respond. His black eyes, far-seeing as a hawk's, were fixed
intently before him, where Del Rey came galloping in the lead.
</p><p>"You go now!" he said, speaking with an effort, and Hooker understood.
There was no love, no hate, left in that mighty carcass--he was all
warrior, all Yaqui, and he wanted Del Rey to himself.
</p><p>"We'll be going," Hooker said to Gracia, returning swiftly, and his
subdued tones made her start. She felt, as one feels at a funeral, the
hovering wings of death, yet she vaulted into her saddle and left her
thoughts unsaid.
</p><p>They rode on down the valley, spurring yet holding back, and then
with a roar that made them jump the heavy Mauser spoke out--one shot!
And no more. There was a hush, a long wait, and Amigo rose slowly from
behind his rock.
</p><p>[Illustration: With a roar that made them jump the heavy Mauser spoke

</p><p>"God!" exclaimed Hooker, as he caught the pose, and his voice sounded a
requiem for Manuel del Rey.
</p><p>Then, as Gracia crossed herself and fell to sobbing, he leaned forward
in his saddle and they galloped away.
