<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>In the valley of the Rio Pecos, years ago, an attempt at founding
a settlement was made by a number of hardy and daring New Englanders,
whose leader was a sort of Don Quixote, who traveled hundreds
of miles, passing by the richest land, the most balmy climate,
where all were protected by the strong arm of law, for the sake
of locating where the soil was only moderate, the climate no better,
and where, it may be said, the great American government was as
powerless to protect its citizens as was a child itself. The Rio
Pecos, running through New Mexico and Texas, drains a territory
which at that time was one of the most dangerous in the whole
Indian country; and why these score or more of families should
have hit upon this spot of all others, was a problem which could
never be clearly solved.</p>

<p>The head man, Caleb Barnwell, had some odd socialistic theories,
which, antedating as they did the theories of Bellamy, were not
likely to thrive very well upon New England soil, and he pursuaded
his friends to go with him, under the belief that the spot selected
was one where they would have full opportunity to increase and
multiply, as did the Mormons during their early days at Salt Lake.
Then, too, there was some reason to suspect that rumors had reached
the ears of Barnwell of the existence of gold and silver along
this river, and it was said that he had hinted as much to those
whom he believed he could trust. Be that as it may, the score
of families reached the valley of the Upper Pecos in due time,
and the settlement was begun and duly christened New Boston.</p>

<p>"How long do yer s'pose you folks are goin' to stay yer? Why,
just long enough for Lone Wolf to hear tell that you've arriv,
and he'll down here and clear you out quicker'n lightning."</p>

<p>This was the characteristic observation made by the old scout,
hunter and guide, Sut Simpson, as he reined up his mustang to
chat awhile with the new-comers, whom he looked upon as the greatest
lunk-heads that he had ever encountered in all of his rather eventful
experience. He had never seen them before; but he did not care
for that, as he had the frankness of a frontiersman and never
stood upon ceremony in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear tell of Lone Wolf?" he continued, as a group,
including nearly the entire population, gathered about the veteran
of the plains. "I say, war any of you ever introduced to that
American gentleman?"</p>

<p>He looked around, from face to face, but no one responded. Whenever
he fixed his eye upon any individual, that one shook his head
to signify that he knew nothing of the Apache chief whose name
he had just mentioned.</p>

<p>"What I meant to say," he continued, "is that any of you have
got any yearnin' toward Lone Wolf, feeling as if your heart would
break if you did n't get a chance to throw your arms about him,
why, you need n't feel bad, <em>'cause you'll get the chance</em>."</p>

<p>There was a significance in these words which made it plain to
every one of those who were looking up in the scarred face of
the hunter. As they were spoken, he winked one of his eyes and
cocked his head to one side, in a fashion that made the words
still more impressive. As Sut looked about the group, his gaze
was attracted by two figures&mdash;a man and a boy. The former was
an Irishman&mdash;his nationality being evident at the first glance&mdash;while
the latter seemed about fourteen years of age, with a bright,
intelligent face, a clear, rosy, healthy complexion, and a keen
eye that was fixed steadily and inquiringly upon the horseman
who was giving utterance to such valuable information. The hunter
was attracted by both, especially as he saw from their actions
that they were friends and companions. There was something in
the honest face of the Irishman which won him, while the lad by
his side would have carried his way almost anywhere upon the score
of his looks alone.</p>

<p>As the entire group were gazing up in the face of the scout,
he spoke to them all, although, in reality, his words were now
directed more at the two referred to than at the others. When
he had completed the words given, there was silence for a moment,
and then Mickey O'Rooney, the Irishman, recovered his wits. Stepping
forward a couple of paces, he addressed their visitor.</p>

<p>"From the manner of your discourse, I judge that you're acquainted
with the American gentleman that you've just referred to as Mr.
Lone Wolf?"</p>

<p>"I rather reckon I am," replied Sut, with another of his peculiar
grins. "Me and the Wolf have met semi-occasionally for the past
ten years, and I carry a few remembrances of his love, that I
expect to keep on carrying to my grave."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he laid his finger upon a cicatrized wound upon
his cheek, a frightful scar several inches in length, and evidently
made by a tomahawk. It ran from the temple to the base of the
nose, and was scarcely concealed by the luxuriant grizzled beard
that grew almost to his eyes.</p>

<p>"That's only one," said Sut. "Here's another that mebbe you can
see."</p>

<p>This time he removed his coon-skin hunting-cap and bending his
head down, he parted the hair with his long, horny fingers, so
that all saw very distinctly the scar of a wound that must have
endangered the life of the recipient.</p>

<p>"I've got half a dozen other scars strung here and there about
my body, the most of which was made by that lonely Apache chief
that is called Lone Wolf; so I reckon you'll conclude that he
and me have some acquaintance. Oh! we was as lovin' as a couple
of brothers!"</p>

<p>Mickey O'Rooney lifted his cap, and scratched his red head in
a puzzled way, as if he were debating some weighty matter. Suddenly
looking up, he asked:</p>

<p>"Was this Mr. Wolf born in these parts?"</p>

<p>"I can't say, precisely, where he first seed the light, but it
must have been somewhere round about this part of the world. Why
did you ax?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking p'raps he was born in Ireland, and came to this
country when he was of tender age. I once knowed a Mr. Fox, whose
petaty patch was so close to ours, that the favorite amoosement
of me respected parents was flingin' the petaties over into our
field by moonlight. His name was Fox, I say, but I never knowed
anybody by the name of Wolf."</p>

<p>"He's a screamer," continued Sut Simpson, who seemed to enjoy
talking of such a formidable foe. "The Comanches and Apaches sling
things loose in these parts, an' the wonder to me is how you ever
got this fur without losing your top-knots, for you've had to
come right through their country."</p>

<p>"We have had encounters with the red men times without number,"
said Caleb Barnwell, who was standing erect, with arms folded,
looking straight at the hunter. He spoke in a deep, rich, bass
voice, recalling the figures of the early Puritans, who were unappalled
by the dangers of the ocean and forest, when the question of liberty
of conscience was at stake. "We have encountered the red men time
and again," he continued, "so that I may conclude that we have
become acclimated, as they say, and understand the nature of the
American Indian very well."</p>

<p>Sut Simpson shook his head with a displeased expression.</p>

<p>"If you'd understood Injin nature, you'd never come here to settle.
You might have gone through the country on your way to some other
place, for, when you're on the way, you can keep a lookout for
the varmints; but you've undertook to settle down right in the
heart of the Apache country, and that's what I call the biggest
piece of tom-foolery that was ever knowed."</p>

<p>This kind of talk might have discouraged ordinary people, but
Barnwell and his companions had long since become accustomed to
it. They had learned to brave ridicule before leaving their homes,
and they classed the expressions of the hunters who had called
upon them with the utterances of those who failed to "look into
the future."</p>

<p>"We were not the dunces to suppose that this was a promised land,
in which there were no giants to dispossess," replied Barnwell,
in the same dignified manner. "Our fathers had to fight the Indians,
and we are prepared to do the same."</p>

<p>Sut Simpson had no patience with this sort of talk, and he threw
up his head with an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>"Did you ever toss a hunk of buffler meat to a hungry hound,
and seen how nice he'd catch it in his jaws, and gulp it down
without winkin', and then he'd lick his chops, and look up and
whine for more. Wal, that's just the fix you folks are in. Lone
Wolf and his men will swallow you down without winkin', and then
be mad that there ain't somethin' left to squinch thar hunger."</p>

<p>As the hunter uttered this significant warning, he gathered up
the reins of his mustang and rode away.</p>
