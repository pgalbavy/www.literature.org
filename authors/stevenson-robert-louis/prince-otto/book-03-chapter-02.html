<p>When Otto mounted to his rolling prison he found another occupant in a
corner of the front seat; but as this person hung his head and the
brightness of the carriage lamps shone outward, the Prince could only see
it was a man.  The Colonel followed his prisoner and clapped-to the door;
and at that the four horses broke immediately into a swinging trot.
</p>
<p>‘Gentlemen,’ said the Colonel, after some little while had passed, ‘if we
are to travel in silence, we might as well be at home.  I appear, of
course, in an invidious character; but I am a man of taste, fond of books
and solidly informing talk, and unfortunately condemned for life to the
guard-room.  Gentlemen, this is my chance: don’t spoil it for me.  I have
here the pick of the whole court, barring lovely woman; I have a great
author in the person of the Doctor—’
</p><p>‘Gotthold!’ cried Otto.
</p><p>‘It appears,’ said the Doctor bitterly, ‘that we must go together.  Your
Highness had not calculated upon that.’
</p><p>‘What do you infer?’ cried Otto; ‘that I had you arrested?’
</p><p>‘The inference is simple,’ said the Doctor.
</p><p>‘Colonel Gordon,’ said the Prince, ‘oblige me so far, and set me right
with Herr von Hohenstockwitz.’
</p><p>‘Gentlemen,’ said the Colonel, ‘you are both arrested on the same warrant
in the name of the Princess Seraphina, acting regent, countersigned by
Prime Minister Freiherr von Gondremark, and dated the day before
yesterday, the twelfth.  I reveal to you the secrets of the
prison-house,’ he added.
</p><p>‘Otto,’ said Gotthold, ‘I ask you to pardon my suspicions.’
</p><p>‘Gotthold,’ said the Prince, ‘I am not certain I can grant you that.’
</p><p>‘Your Highness is, I am sure, far too magnanimous to hesitate,’ said the
Colonel.  ‘But allow me: we speak at home in my religion of the means of
grace: and I now propose to offer them.’  So saying, the Colonel lighted
a bright lamp which he attached to one side of the carriage, and from
below the front seat produced a goodly basket adorned with the long necks
of bottles.  ‘<u>Tu spem reducis</u>—how does it go, Doctor?’ he asked gaily.
‘I am, in a sense, your host; and I am sure you are both far too
considerate of my embarrassing position to refuse to do me honour.
Gentlemen, I drink to the Prince!’
</p><p>‘Colonel,’ said Otto, ‘we have a jovial entertainer.  I drink to Colonel
Gordon.’
</p><p>Thereupon all three took their wine very pleasantly; and even as they did
so, the carriage with a lurch turned into the high-road and began to make
better speed.
</p><p>All was bright within; the wine had coloured Gotthold’s cheek; dim forms
of forest trees, dwindling and spiring, scarves of the starry sky, now
wide and now narrow, raced past the windows, through one that was left
open the air of the woods came in with a nocturnal raciness; and the roll
of wheels and the tune of the trotting horses sounded merrily on the ear.
Toast followed toast; glass after glass was bowed across and emptied by
the trio; and presently there began to fall upon them a luxurious spell,
under the influence of which little but the sound of quiet and
confidential laughter interrupted the long intervals of meditative
silence.
</p><p>‘Otto,’ said Gotthold, after one of these seasons of quiet, ‘I do not ask
you to forgive me.  Were the parts reversed, I could not forgive you.’
</p><p>‘Well,’ said Otto, ‘it is a phrase we use.  I do forgive you, but your
words and your suspicions rankle; and not yours alone.  It is idle,
Colonel Gordon, in view of the order you are carrying out, to conceal
from you the dissensions of my family; they have gone so far that they
are now public property.  Well, gentlemen, can I forgive my wife?  I can,
of course, and do; but in what sense?  I would certainly not stoop to any
revenge; as certainly I could not think of her but as one changed beyond
my recognition.’
</p><p>‘Allow me,’ returned the Colonel.  ‘You will permit me to hope that I am
addressing Christians?  We are all conscious, I trust, that we are
miserable sinners.’
</p><p>‘I disown the consciousness,’ said Gotthold.  ‘Warmed with this good
fluid, I deny your thesis.’
</p><p>‘How, sir?  You never did anything wrong? and I heard you asking pardon
but this moment, not of your God, sir, but of a common fellow-worm!’ the
Colonel cried.
</p><p>‘I own you have me; you are expert in argument, Herr Oberst,’ said the
Doctor.
</p><p>‘Begad, sir, I am proud to hear you say so,’ said the Colonel.  ‘I was
well grounded indeed at Aberdeen.  And as for this matter of forgiveness,
it comes, sir, of loose views and (what is if anything more dangerous) a
regular life.  A sound creed and a bad morality, that’s the root of
wisdom.  You two gentlemen are too good to be forgiving.’
</p><p>‘The paradox is somewhat forced,’ said Gotthold.
</p><p>‘Pardon me, Colonel,’ said the Prince; ‘I readily acquit you of any
design of offence, but your words bite like satire.  Is this a time, do
you think, when I can wish to hear myself called good, now that I am
paying the penalty (and am willing like yourself to think it just) of my
prolonged misconduct?’
</p><p>‘O, pardon me!’ cried the Colonel.  ‘You have never been expelled from
the divinity hall; you have never been broke.  I was: broke for a neglect
of military duty.  To tell you the open truth, your Highness, I was the
worse of drink; it’s a thing I never do now,’ he added, taking out his
glass.  ‘But a man, you see, who has really tasted the defects of his own
character, as I have, and has come to regard himself as a kind of blind
teetotum knocking about life, begins to learn a very different view about
forgiveness.  I will talk of not forgiving others, sir, when I have made
out to forgive myself, and not before; and the date is like to be a long
one.  My father, the Reverend Alexander Gordon, was a good man, and
damned hard upon others.  I am what they call a bad one, and that is just
the difference.  The man who cannot forgive any mortal thing is a green
hand in life.’
</p><p>‘And yet I have heard of you, Colonel, as a duellist,’ said Gotthold.
</p><p>‘A different thing, sir,’ replied the soldier.  ‘Professional etiquette.
And I trust without unchristian feeling.’
</p><p>Presently after the Colonel fell into a deep sleep and his companions
looked upon each other, smiling.
</p><p>‘An odd fish,’ said Gotthold.
</p><p>‘And a strange guardian,’ said the Prince.  ‘Yet what he said was true.’
</p><p>‘Rightly looked upon,’ mused Gotthold, ‘it is ourselves that we cannot
forgive, when we refuse forgiveness to our friend.  Some strand of our
own misdoing is involved in every quarrel.’
</p><p>‘Are there not offences that disgrace the pardoner?’ asked Otto.  ‘Are
there not bounds of self-respect?’
</p><p>‘Otto,’ said Gotthold, ‘does any man respect himself?  To this poor waif
of a soldier of fortune we may seem respectable gentlemen; but to
ourselves, what are we unless a pasteboard portico and a deliquium of
deadly weaknesses within?’
</p><p>‘I? yes,’ said Otto; ‘but you, Gotthold—you, with your interminable
industry, your keen mind, your books—serving mankind, scorning pleasures
and temptations!  You do not know how I envy you.’
</p><p>‘Otto,’ said the Doctor, ‘in one word, and a bitter one to say: I am a
secret tippler.  Yes, I drink too much.  The habit has robbed these very
books, to which you praise my devotion, of the merits that they should
have had.  It has spoiled my temper.  When I spoke to you the other day,
how much of my warmth was in the cause of virtue? how much was the fever
of last night’s wine?  Ay, as my poor fellow-sot there said, and as I
vaingloriously denied, we are all miserable sinners, put here for a
moment, knowing the good, choosing the evil, standing naked and ashamed
in the eye of God.’
</p><p>‘Is it so?’ said Otto.  ‘Why, then, what are we?  Are the very best—’
</p><p>‘There is no best in man,’ said Gotthold.  ‘I am not better, it is likely
I am not worse, than you or that poor sleeper.  I was a sham, and now you
know me: that is all.’
</p><p>‘And yet it has not changed my love,’ returned Otto softly.  ‘Our
misdeeds do not change us.  Gotthold, fill your glass.  Let us drink to
what is good in this bad business; let us drink to our old affection;
and, when we have done so, forgive your too just grounds of offence, and
drink with me to my wife, whom I have so misused, who has so misused me,
and whom I have left, I fear, I greatly fear, in danger.  What matters it
how bad we are, if others can still love us, and we can still love
others?’
</p><p>‘Ay!’ replied the Doctor.  ‘It is very well said.  It is the true answer
to the pessimist, and the standing miracle of mankind.  So you still love
me? and so you can forgive your wife?  Why, then, we may bid conscience
“Down, dog,” like an ill-trained puppy yapping at shadows.’
</p><p>The pair fell into silence, the Doctor tapping on his empty glass.
</p><p>The carriage swung forth out of the valleys on that open balcony of
high-road that runs along the front of Grünewald, looking down on
Gerolstein.  Far below, a white waterfall was shining to the stars from
the falling skirts of forest, and beyond that, the night stood naked
above the plain.  On the other hand, the lamp-light skimmed the face of
the precipices, and the dwarf pine-trees twinkled with all their needles,
and were gone again into the wake.  The granite roadway thundered under
wheels and hoofs; and at times, by reason of its continual winding, Otto
could see the escort on the other side of a ravine, riding well together
in the night.  Presently the Felsenburg came plainly in view, some way
above them, on a bold projection of the mountain, and planting its bulk
against the starry sky.
</p><p>‘See, Gotthold,’ said the Prince, ‘our destination.’
</p><p>Gotthold awoke as from a trance.
</p><p>‘I was thinking,’ said he, ‘if there is any danger, why did you not
resist?  I was told you came of your free will; but should you not be
there to help her?’
</p><p>The colour faded from the Prince’s cheeks.
