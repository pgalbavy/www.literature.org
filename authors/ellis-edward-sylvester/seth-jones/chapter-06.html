<p>When the sad event just chronicled took place, and Seth made
a rather unceremonious entrance into view of the savages, Graham
felt that he too was in peril, and his life depended upon his
own exertions. To have offered resistance would have been madness,
as there were full thirty Indians at hand. Flight was the only
resource left, and without waiting to see the fate of Seth, our
hero made a bound down the embankment, alighting at the bottom,
and struck directly across the plain, toward the timber that lined
the river. He had gained several hundred yards, when several prolonged
yells told him that he was discovered, and was a flying fugitive.
Casting his eye behind him, he saw five or six Indians already
down the embankment and in full chase.</p>

<p>And now commenced a race of life and death. Graham was as fleet
of foot as a deer, and was well-trained and disciplined, but his
pursuers numbered five of the swiftest runners of the Mohawk nation,
and he feared he had at last found his match. Yet he was as skillful
and cunning as he was sinewy and fleet of foot. The plain over
which he was speeding was perfectly bare and naked for six or
eight miles before him, while it stretched twice that distance
on either hand, before the slightest refuge was offered. Thus,
it will be seen, he took the only course which offered hope&mdash;a
dead run for it, where the pursuer and pursued possessed equal
advantages.</p>

<p>He was pretty certain that his pursuers possessed greater endurance
than himself, and that in a long run he stood small chance of
escape, while in a short race he believed he could distance any
living Indian. So he determined to try the speed of his enemies.</p>

<p>As he heard their yells, he bounded forward almost at the top
of his speed. The pursuers, however, maintained the same regular
and rapid motion. Graham continued his exertions for about half
a mile, making such use of his arms and limbs as to give the impression
that he was doing his utmost. Toward the latter part of the first
mile, his speed began to slacken, and his dangling limbs and furtive
glances behind him, would have convinced any one that he was nigh
exhausted.</p>

<p>But this was only a stratagem, and it succeeded as well as he
could have wished. The Indians believed that he had committed
a common and fatal error&mdash;that of calling into play the utmost
strength and speed of which he was master at the outset, and that
he was now wearied out, while they themselves were just warming
into the glow of the chase. Seeing this, each sent up a shout
of exultation, and darted ahead at the top of his speed, each
endeavoring to reach and tomahawk him before his companion.</p>

<p>But their surprise was unbounded when they saw the fugitive shoot
ahead with the velocity of a race-horse, while his veins, too,
were only filling with the hot blood of exertion. They saw this
and they saw, too, that should such speed continue long, he would
be far beyond their reach, and all now ran as they never ran before.</p>

<p>We say Graham’s stratagem succeeded. It did, and it gave him
the knowledge he wished. It showed him that he had met his match!
His pursuers, at least one or two of them, were nearly as fleet
as was he; and, although he might distance them for a time, yet
ere half the race was finished he would inevitably lose the vantage
ground!</p>

<p>Could one have stood and gazed upon this race of life, he would
have seen a thrilling scene. Far ahead, over a vast plain, a fugitive
white man was flying, and his swift steady gait showed that his
limbs were well-trained and were now put to their severest test.
As his feet doubled with such quickness beneath him as to be almost
invisible, the ground glided like a panorama from under them.</p>

<p>Behind were a half-dozen savages, their gleaming visages distorted
with the passions of exultation, vengeance, and doubt, their garments
flying in the wind, and their strength pressed to its utmost bounds.
They were scattered at different distances from each other, and
were spreading over the prairie, so as to cut off the fugitive’s
escape in every direction.</p>

<p>Two Indians maintained their places side by side, and it was
evident that the pursuit would soon be left to them. The others
were rapidly falling behind, and were already relaxing their exertions.
Graham saw the state of things, and it thrilled him with hope.
Could he not distance these also? Would they not leave him in
such a case? And could he not escape ere he was compelled to give
out from exhaustion?</p>

<p>"At any rate I will try, and God help me!" he uttered, prayerfully,
shooting ahead with almost superhuman velocity. He glanced back
and saw his followers, and they seemed almost standing still,
so rapidly did he leave them behind.</p>

<p>But as nature compelled him to again cease the terrific rate
at which he was going, he saw his unwearied pursuers again recovering
their lost ground. The parties now understood each other. The
Indians saw his maneuvers, and avoided the trap, and kept on in
the same unremitting relentless speed, fully certain that this
would sooner or later compel him to yield; while Graham knew that
the only chance of prolonging the contest rested in his dropping
into and continuing his ordinary speed.</p>

<p>They now sunk into the same steady and terribly monotonous run.
Mile after mile flew beneath them, and still so exact and similar
were their relative rates, that they were absolutely stationary
with regard to each other! The two Indians now remained alone,
and they were untiring&mdash;they were determined that they should
continue to the end!</p>

<p>At last Graham saw the friendly timber but a short distance from
him. The trees seemed beckoning him to their friendly shelter,
and panting and gasping he plunged in among them&mdash;plunged right
ahead till he stood upon the bank of a large, rapidly-flowing
stream.</p>

<p>When the Anglo-Saxon’s body is pitted against that of the North
American Indian, it sometimes yields; but when his mind takes
the place of contestant, it <em>never</em> loses.</p>

<p>Graham gazed hurriedly around him, and in the space of a dozen
seconds his faculties had wrought enough for a lifetime&mdash;wrought
enough to save him.</p>

<p>Throwing his rifle aside, he waded carefully into the stream
until he stood waist deep. Then sinking upon his face, he swam
rapidly upward until he had gone a hundred yards. Here he struck
vigorously out into the channel, swimming up stream as well as
<em>across</em> it, so as not to reach the bank at a lower point.
The current was very swift, and required an exhausting outlay
of his already fainting frame before he reached the opposite shore.
Here he immediately sprang upon the shore, ran quickly a short
distance down the stream, making his trail as plain as possible;
and then springing into the stream, swam rapidly upward, remaining
as close to the shore as possible, so as to avoid the resisting
current. The reason of these singular movements will soon be plain.</p>

<p>The shore was lined by thickly overhanging bushes, and after
swimming until he supposed it time for his pursuers to come up,
he glided beneath their friendly shelter, and awaited for the
further development of things. Almost immediately after, both
appeared upon the opposite bank, but at a point considerably lower
down. Without hesitation, they sprang into the stream and swam
across. As they landed, they commenced a search, and a yell announced
the discovery of the trail. Instantly after, another yell proclaimed
their disappointment, as they lost it in the river.</p>

<p>The savages supposed that the fugitive had again taken to the
water, and had either drowned or reached the other side. At any
rate, they had lost what they considered a certain prey, and with
feelings of baffled malignity they sullenly swam back again, searched
the other side an hour or so, and then took their way back to
their companions.</p>
