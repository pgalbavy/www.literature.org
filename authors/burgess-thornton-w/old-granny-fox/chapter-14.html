There's nothing so foolishly silly and vain<br/>
As to wish for a thing you can never attain.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

<p>We all know that, yet most of us are just foolish enough to make
such a wish now and then. I guess you have done it. I know I have.
Peter Rabbit has done it often and then laughed at himself afterwards.
I suspect that even shrewd, clever old Granny Fox has been guilty
of it more than once. So it is not surprising that Reddy Fox,
terribly hungry as he was, should do a little foolish wishing.</p>

<p>When he left home to go to the Old Pasture, in the hope that
he would be able to find something to eat there, he started off
bravely. It was cold, very cold indeed, but his fur coat kept
him warm as long as he was moving. The Green Meadows were glistening
white with snow. All the world, at least all that part of it with
which Reddy was acquainted, was white. It was beautiful, very
beautiful, as millions of sparkles flashed in the sun. But Reddy
had no thought for beauty; the only thought he had room for was
to get something to put in the empty stomachs of himself and Granny
Fox.</p>

<p>Jack Frost had hardened the snow so that Reddy no longer had
to wade through it. He could run on the crust now without breaking
through. This made it much easier, so he trotted along swiftly.
He had intended to go straight to the Old Pasture, but there suddenly
popped into his head a memory of the shelter down in a far corner
of the Old Orchard which Farmer Brown's boy had built for Bob
White. Probably the Bob White family were there now, and he might
surprise them. He would go there first.</p>

<p>Reddy stopped and looked carefully to make sure that Farmer Brown's
boy and Bowser the Hound were nowhere in sight. Then he ran swiftly
towards the Old Orchard. Just as he entered it he heard a merry
voice just over his head: "Dee, dee, dee, dee!" Reddy stopped
and looked up. There was Tommy Tit the Chickadee clinging tightly
to a big piece of fresh suet tied fast to a branch of a tree,
and Tommy was stuffing himself. Reddy sat down right underneath
that suet and looked up longingly. The sight of it made his mouth
water so that it was almost more than he could stand. He jumped
once. He jumped twice. He jumped three times. But all his jumping
was in vain. That suet was beyond his reach. There was no possible
way of reaching it save by flying or climbing. Reddy's tongue
hung out of his mouth with longing.</p>

<p>"I wish I could climb," said Reddy.</p>

<p>But he couldn't climb, and all the wishing in the world wouldn't
enable him to, as he very well knew. So after a little he started
on. As he drew near the far corner of the Old Orchard, he saw
Bob White and Mrs. Bob and all the young Bobs picking up grain
which Farmer Brown's boy had scattered for them just in front
of the shelter he had built for them. Reddy crouched down and
very slowly, an inch at a time, he crept forward, his eyes shining
with eagerness. Just as he was almost within springing distance,
Bob White gave a signal, and away flew the Bob Whites to the safety
of a hemlock-tree on the edge of the Green Forest.</p>

<p>Tears of rage and disappointment welled up in Reddy's eyes. "I
wish I could fly," he muttered, as he watched the brown birds
disappear in the big hemlock-tree.</p>

<p>This was quite as foolish a wish as the other, so Reddy trotted
on and decided to go down past the Smiling Pool. When he got there
he found it, as he expected, frozen over. But just where the Laughing
Brook joins it there was a little place where there was open water.
Billy Mink was on the ice at its edge, and just as Reddy got there
Billy dived in. A minute later he climbed out with a fish in his
mouth.</p>

<p>"Give me a bite," begged Reddy.</p>

<p>"Catch your own fish," retorted Billy Mink. "I have to work hard
enough for what I get as it is."</p>

<p>Reddy was afraid to go out on the ice where Billy was, and so
he sat and watched him eat that fine fish. Then Billy dived into
the water again and disappeared. Reddy waited a long time, but
Billy did not return. "I wish I could dive," gulped Reddy, thinking
of the fine fish somewhere under the ice.</p>

<p>And this wish was quite as foolish as the other wishes.</p>
