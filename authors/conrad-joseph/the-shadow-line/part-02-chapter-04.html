<p>With her anchor at the bow and clothed in canvas to her very
trucks, my command seemed to stand as motionless as a model ship
set on the gleams and shadows of polished marble. It was impossible
to distinguish land from water in the enigmatical tranquillity
of the immense forces of the world. A sudden impatience possessed
me.</p>

<p>"Won’t she answer the helm at all?" I said irritably to the man
whose strong brown hands grasping the spokes of the wheel stood
out lighted on the darkness; like a symbol of mankind’s claim
to the direction of its own fate.</p>

<p>He answered me.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. She’s coming-to slowly."</p>

<p>"Let her head come up to south."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>I paced the poop. There was not a sound but that of my footsteps,
till the man spoke again.</p>

<p>"She is at south now, sir."</p>

<p>I felt a slight tightness of the chest before I gave out the
first course of my first command to the silent night, heavy with
dew and sparkling with stars. There was a finality in the act
committing me to the endless vigilance of my lonely task.</p>

<p>"Steady her head at that," I said at last. "The course is south."</p>

<p>"South, sir," echoed the man.</p>

<p>I sent below the second mate and his watch and remained in charge,
walking the deck through the chill, somnolent hours that precede
the dawn.</p>

<p>Slight puffs came and went, and whenever they were strong enough
to wake up the black water the murmur alongside ran through my
very heart in a delicate crescendo of delight and died away swiftly.
I was bitterly tired. The very stars seemed weary of waiting for
daybreak. It came at last with a mother-of-pearl sheen at the
zenith, such as I had never seen before in the tropics, unglowing,
almost gray, with a strange reminder of high latitudes.</p>

<p>The voice of the look-out man hailed from forward:</p>

<p>"Land on the port bow, sir."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Leaning on the rail I never even raised my eyes.</p>

<p>The motion of the ship was imperceptible. Presently Ransome brought
me the cup of morning coffee. After I had drunk it I looked ahead,
and in the still streak of very bright pale orange light I saw
the land profiled flatly as if cut out of black paper and seeming
to float on the water as light as cork. But the rising sun turned
it into mere dark vapour, a doubtful, massive shadow trembling
in the hot glare.</p>

<p>The watch finished washing decks. I went below and stopped at
Mr. Burns’ door (he could not bear to have it shut), but hesitated
to speak to him till he moved his eyes. I gave him the news.</p>

<p>"Sighted Cape Liant at daylight. About fifteen miles."</p>

<p>He moved his lips then, but I heard no sound till I put my ear
down, and caught the peevish comment: "This is crawling. . . .
No luck."</p>

<p>"Better luck than standing still, anyhow," I pointed out resignedly,
and left him to whatever thoughts or fancies haunted his awful
immobility.</p>

<p>Later that morning, when relieved by my second officer, I threw
myself on my couch and for some three hours or so I really found
oblivion. It was so perfect that on waking up I wondered where
I was. Then came the immense relief of the thought: on board my
ship! At sea! At sea!</p>

<p>Through the port-holes I beheld an unruffled, sun-smitten horizon.
The horizon of a windless day. But its spaciousness alone was
enough to give me a sense of a fortunate escape, a momentary exultation
of freedom.</p>

<p>I stepped out into the saloon with my heart lighter than it had
been for days. Ransome was at the sideboard preparing to lay the
table for the first sea dinner of the passage. He turned his head,
and something in his eyes checked my modest elation.</p>

<p>Instinctively I asked: "What is it now?" not expecting in the
least the answer I got. It was given with that sort of contained
serenity which was characteristic of the man.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we haven’t left all sickness behind us, sir."</p>

<p>"We haven’t! What’s the matter?"</p>

<p>He told me then that two of our men had been taken bad with fever
in the night. One of them was burning and the other was shivering,
but he thought that it was pretty much the same thing. I thought
so, too. I felt shocked by the news. "One burning, the other shivering,
you say? No. We haven’t left the sickness behind. Do they look
very ill?"</p>

<p>"Middling bad, sir." Ransome’s eyes gazed steadily into mine.
We exchanged smiles. Ransome’s a little wistful, as usual, mine
no doubt grim enough, to correspond with my secret exasperation.</p>

<p>I asked:</p>

<p>"Was there any wind at all this morning?"</p>

<p>"Can hardly say that, sir. We’ve moved all the time though. The
land ahead seems a little nearer."</p>

<p>That was it. A little nearer. Whereas if we had only had a little
more wind, only a very little more, we might, we should, have
been abreast of Liant by this time and increasing our distance
from that contaminated shore. And it was not only the distance.
It seemed to me that a stronger breeze would have blown away the
contamination which clung to the ship. It obviously did cling
to the ship. Two men. One burning, one shivering. I felt a distinct
reluctance to go and look at them. What was the good? Poison is
poison. Tropical fever is tropical fever. But that it should have
stretched its claw after us over the sea seemed to me an extraordinary
and unfair license. I could hardly believe that it could be anything
worse than the last desperate pluck of the evil from which we
were escaping into the clean breath of the sea. If only that breath
had been a little stronger. However, there was the quinine against
the fever. I went into the spare cabin where the medicine chest
was kept to prepare two doses. I opened it full of faith as a
man opens a miraculous shrine. The upper part was inhabited by
a collection of bottles, all square-shouldered and as like each
other as peas. Under that orderly array there were two drawers,
stuffed as full of things as one could imagine&mdash;paper packages,
bandages, cardboard boxes officially labelled. The lower of the
two, in one of its compartments, contained our provision of quinine.</p>

<p>There were five bottles, all round and all of a size. One was
about a third full. The other four remained still wrapped up in
paper and sealed. But I did not expect to see an envelope lying
on top of them. A square envelope, belonging, in fact, to the
ship’s stationery.</p>

<p>It lay so that I could see it was not closed down, and on picking
it up and turning it over I perceived that it was addressed to
myself. It contained a half-sheet of notepaper, which I unfolded
with a queer sense of dealing with the uncanny, but without any
excitement as people meet and do extraordinary things in a dream.</p>

<p>"My dear Captain," it began, but I ran to the signature. The
writer was the doctor. The date was that of the day on which,
returning from my visit to Mr. Burns in the hospital, I had found
the excellent doctor waiting for me in the cabin; and when he
told me that he had been putting in time inspecting the medicine
chest for me. How bizarre! While expecting me to come in at any
moment he had been amusing himself by writing me a letter, and
then as I came in had hastened to stuff it into the medicine-chest
drawer. A rather incredible proceeding. I turned to the text in
wonder.</p>

<p>In a large, hurried, but legible hand the good, sympathetic man
for some reason, either of kindness or more likely impelled by
the irresistible desire to express his opinion, with which he
didn’t want to damp my hopes before, was warning me not to put
my trust in the beneficial effects of a change from land to sea.
"I didn’t want to add to your worries by discouraging your hopes,"
he wrote. "I am afraid that, medically speaking, the end of your
troubles is not yet." In short, he expected me to have to fight
a probable return of tropical illness. Fortunately I had a good
provision of quinine. I should put my trust in that, and administer
it steadily, when the ship’s health would certainly improve.</p>

<p>I crumpled up the letter and rammed it into my pocket. Ransome
carried off two big doses to the men forward. As to myself, I
did not go on deck as yet. I went instead to the door of Mr. Burns’
room, and gave him that news, too.</p>

<p>It was impossible to say the effect it had on him. At first I
thought that he was speechless. His head lay sunk in the pillow.
He moved his lips enough, however, to assure me that he was getting
much stronger; a statement shockingly untrue on the face of it.</p>

<p>That afternoon I took my watch as a matter of course. A great
over-heated stillness enveloped the ship and seemed to hold her
motionless in a flaming ambience composed in two shades of blue.
Faint, hot puffs eddied nervelessly from her sails. And yet she
moved. She must have. For, as the sun was setting, we had drawn
abreast of Cape Liant and dropped it behind us: an ominous retreating
shadow in the last gleams of twilight.</p>

<p>In the evening, under the crude glare of his lamp, Mr. Burns
seemed to have come more to the surface of his bedding. It was
as if a depressing hand had been lifted off him. He answered my
few words by a comparatively long, connected speech. He asserted
himself strongly. If he escaped being smothered by this stagnant
heat, he said, he was confident that in a very few days he would
be able to come up on deck and help me.</p>

<p>While he was speaking I trembled lest this effort of energy should
leave him lifeless before my eyes. But I cannot deny that there
was something comforting in his willingness. I made a suitable
reply, but pointed out to him that the only thing that could really
help us was wind&mdash;a fair wind.</p>

<p>He rolled his head impatiently on the pillow. And it was not
comforting in the least to hear him begin to mutter crazily about
the late captain, that old man buried in latitude 8 d 20’, right
in our way&mdash;ambushed at the entrance of the Gulf.</p>

<p>"Are you still thinking of your late captain, Mr. Burns?" I said.
"I imagine the dead feel no animosity against the living. They
care nothing for them."</p>

<p>"You don’t know that one," he breathed out feebly.</p>

<p>"No. I didn’t know him, and he didn’t know me. And so he can’t
have any grievance against me, anyway."</p>

<p>"Yes. But there’s all the rest of us on board," he insisted.</p>

<p>I felt the inexpugnable strength of common sense being insidiously
menaced by this gruesome, by this insane, delusion. And I said:</p>

<p>"You mustn’t talk so much. You will tire yourself."</p>

<p>"And there is the ship herself," he persisted in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Now, not a word more," I said, stepping in and laying my hand
on his cool forehead. It proved to me that this atrocious absurdity
was rooted in the man himself and not in the disease, which, apparently,
had emptied him of every power, mental and physical, except that
one fixed idea.</p>

<p>I avoided giving Mr. Burns any opening for conversation for the
next few days. I merely used to throw him a hasty, cheery word
when passing his door. I believe that if he had had the strength
he would have called out after me more than once. But he hadn’t
the strength. Ransome, however, observed to me one afternoon that
the mate "seemed to be picking up wonderfully."</p>

<p>"Did he talk any nonsense to you of late?" I asked casually.</p>

<p>"No, sir." Ransome was startled by the direct question; but,
after a pause, he added equably: "He told me this morning, sir,
that he was sorry he had to bury our late captain right in the
ship’s way, as one may say, out of the Gulf."</p>

<p>"Isn’t this nonsense enough for you?" I asked, looking confidently
at the intelligent, quiet face on which the secret uneasiness
in the man’s breast had thrown a transparent veil of care.</p>

<p>Ransome didn’t know. He had not given a thought to the matter.
And with a faint smile he flitted away from me on his never-ending
duties, with his usual guarded activity.</p>

<p>Two more days passed. We had advanced a little way&mdash;a very little
way&mdash;into the larger space of the Gulf of Siam. Seizing eagerly
upon the elation of the first command thrown into my lap, by the
agency of Captain Giles, I had yet an uneasy feeling that such
luck as this has got perhaps to be paid for in some way. I had
held, professionally, a review of my chances. I was competent
enough for that. At least, I thought so. I had a general sense
of my preparedness which only a man pursuing a calling he loves
can know. That feeling seemed to me the most natural thing in
the world. As natural as breathing. I imagined I could not have
lived without it.</p>

<p>I don’t know what I expected. Perhaps nothing else than that
special intensity of existence which is the quintessence of youthful
aspirations. Whatever I expected I did not expect to be beset
by hurricanes. I knew better than that. In the Gulf of Siam there
are no hurricanes. But neither did I expect to find myself bound
hand and foot to the hopeless extent which was revealed to me
as the days went on.</p>

<p>Not that the evil spell held us always motionless. Mysterious
currents drifted us here and there, with a stealthy power made
manifest only by the changing vistas of the islands fringing the
east shore of the Gulf. And there were winds, too, fitful and
deceitful. They raised hopes only to dash them into the bitterest
disappointment, promises of advance ending in lost ground, expiring
in sighs, dying into dumb stillness in which the currents had
it all their own way&mdash;their own inimical way.</p>

<p>The island of Koh-ring, a great, black, upheaved ridge amongst
a lot of tiny islets, lying upon the glassy water like a triton
amongst minnows, seemed to be the centre of the fatal circle.
It seemed impossible to get away from it. Day after day it remained
in sight. More than once, in a favourable breeze, I would take
its bearings in the fast-ebbing twilight, thinking that it was
for the last time. Vain hope. A night of fitful airs would undo
the gains of temporary favour, and the rising sun would throw
out the black relief of Koh-ring looking more barren, inhospitable,
and grim than ever.</p>

<p>"It’s like being bewitched, upon my word," I said once to Mr.
Burns, from my usual position in the doorway.</p>

<p>He was sitting up in his bed-place. He was progressing toward
the world of living men; if he could hardly have been said to
have rejoined it yet. He nodded to me his frail and bony head
in a wisely mysterious assent.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know what you mean," I said. "But you cannot expect
me to believe that a dead man has the power to put out of joint
the meteorology of this part of the world. Though indeed it seems
to have gone utterly wrong. The land and sea breezes have got
broken up into small pieces. We cannot depend upon them for five
minutes together."</p>

<p>"It won’t be very long now before I can come up on deck," muttered
Mr. Burns, "and then we shall see."</p>

<p>Whether he meant this for a promise to grapple with supernatural
evil I couldn’t tell. At any rate, it wasn’t the kind of assistance
I needed. On the other hand, I had been living on deck practically
night and day so as to take advantage of every chance to get my
ship a little more to the southward. The mate, I could see, was
extremely weak yet, and not quite rid of his delusion, which to
me appeared but a symptom of his disease. At all events, the hopefulness
of an invalid was not to be discouraged. I said:</p>

<p>"You will be most welcome there, I am sure, Mr. Burns. If you
go on improving at this rate you’ll be presently one of the healthiest
men in the ship."</p>

<p>This pleased him, but his extreme emaciation converted his self-satisfied
smile into a ghastly exhibition of long teeth under the red moustache.</p>

<p>"Aren’t the fellows improving, sir?" he asked soberly, with an
extremely sensible expression of anxiety on his face.</p>

<p>I answered him only with a vague gesture and went away from the
door. The fact was that disease played with us capriciously very
much as the winds did. It would go from one man to another with
a lighter or heavier touch, which always left its mark behind,
staggering some, knocking others over for a time, leaving this
one, returning to another, so that all of them had now an invalidish
aspect and a hunted, apprehensive look in their eyes; while Ransome
and I, the only two completely untouched, went amongst them assiduously
distributing quinine. It was a double fight. The adverse weather
held us in front and the disease pressed on our rear. I must say
that the men were very good. The constant toil of trimming yards
they faced willingly. But all spring was out of their limbs, and
as I looked at them from the poop I could not keep from my mind
the dreadful impression that they were moving in poisoned air.</p>

<p>Down below, in his cabin, Mr. Burns had advanced so far as not
only to be able to sit up, but even to draw up his legs. Clasping
them with bony arms, like an animated skeleton, he emitted deep,
impatient sighs.</p>

<p>"The great thing to do, sir," he would tell me on every occasion,
when I gave him the chance, "the great thing is to get the ship
past 8 d 20’ of latitude. Once she’s past that we’re all right."</p>

<p>At first I used only to smile at him, though, God knows, I had
not much heart left for smiles. But at last I lost my patience.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. The latitude 8 d 20’. That’s where you buried your
late captain, isn’t it?" Then with severity: "Don’t you think,
Mr. Burns, it’s about time you dropped all that nonsense?"</p>

<p>He rolled at me his deep-sunken eyes in a glance of invincible
obstinacy. But for the rest he only muttered, just loud enough
for me to hear, something about "Not surprised . . . find . .
. play us some beastly trick yet. . . ."</p>

<p>Such passages as this were not exactly wholesome for my resolution.
The stress of adversity was beginning to tell on me. At the same
time, I felt a contempt for that obscure weakness of my soul.
I said to myself disdainfully that it should take much more than
that to affect in the smallest degree my fortitude.</p>

<p>I didn’t know then how soon and from what unexpected direction
it would be attacked.</p>

<p>It was the very next day. The sun had risen clear of the southern
shoulder of Koh-ring, which still hung, like an evil attendant,
on our port quarter. It was intensely hateful to my sight. During
the night we had been heading all round the compass, trimming
the yards again and again, to what I fear must have been for the
most part imaginary puffs of air. Then just about sunrise we got
for an hour an inexplicable, steady breeze, right in our teeth.
There was no sense in it. It fitted neither with the season of
the year nor with the secular experience of seamen as recorded
in books, nor with the aspect of the sky. Only purposeful malevolence
could account for it. It sent us travelling at a great pace away
from our proper course; and if we had been out on pleasure sailing
bent it would have been a delightful breeze, with the awakened
sparkle of the sea, with the sense of motion and a feeling of
unwonted freshness. Then, all at once, as if disdaining to carry
farther the sorry jest, it dropped and died out completely in
less than five minutes. The ship’s head swung where it listed;
the stilled sea took on the polish of a steel plate in the calm.</p>

<p>I went below, not because I meant to take some rest, but simply
because I couldn’t bear to look at it just then. The indefatigable
Ransome was busy in the saloon. It had become a regular practice
with him to give me an informal health report in the morning.
He turned away from the sideboard with his usual pleasant, quiet
gaze. No shadow rested on his intelligent forehead.</p>

<p>"There are a good many of them middling bad this morning, sir,"
he said in a calm tone.</p>

<p>"What? All knocked out?"</p>

<p>"Only two actually in their bunks, sir, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It’s the last night that has done for them. We have had to pull
and haul all the blessed time."</p>

<p>"I heard, sir. I had a mind to come out and help only, you know.
. . ."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. You mustn’t. . . . The fellows lie at night about
the decks, too. It isn’t good for them."</p>

<p>Ransome assented. But men couldn’t be looked after like children.
Moreover, one could hardly blame them for trying for such coolness
and such air as there was to be found on deck. He himself, of
course, knew better.</p>

<p>He was, indeed, a reasonable man. Yet it would have been hard
to say that the others were not. The last few days had been for
us like the ordeal of the fiery furnace. One really couldn’t quarrel
with their common, imprudent humanity making the best of the moments
of relief, when the night brought in the illusion of coolness
and the starlight twinkled through the heavy, dew-laden air. Moreover,
most of them were so weakened that hardly anything could be done
without everybody that could totter mustering on the braces. No,
it was no use remonstrating with them. But I fully believed that
quinine was of very great use indeed.</p>

<p>I believed in it. I pinned my faith to it. It would save the
men, the ship, break the spell by its medicinal virtue, make time
of no account, the weather but a passing worry and, like a magic
powder working against mysterious malefices, secure the first
passage of my first command against the evil powers of calms and
pestilence. I looked upon it as more precious than gold, and unlike
gold, of which there ever hardly seems to be enough anywhere,
the ship had a sufficient store of it. I went in to get it with
the purpose of weighing out doses. I stretched my hand with the
feeling of a man reaching for an unfailing panacea, took up a
fresh bottle and unrolled the wrapper, noticing as I did so that
the ends, both top and bottom, had come unsealed. . . .</p>

<p>But why record all the swift steps of the appalling discovery?
You have guessed the truth already. There was the wrapper, the
bottle, and the white powder inside, some sort of powder! But
it wasn’t quinine. One look at it was quite enough. I remember
that at the very moment of picking up the bottle, before I even
dealt with the wrapper, the weight of the object I had in my hand
gave me an instant premonition. Quinine is as light as feathers;
and my nerves must have been exasperated into an extraordinary
sensibility. I let the bottle smash itself on the floor. The stuff,
whatever it was, felt gritty under the sole of my shoe. I snatched
up the next bottle and then the next. The weight alone told the
tale. One after another they fell, breaking at my feet, not because
I threw them down in my dismay, but slipping through my fingers
as if this disclosure were too much for my strength.</p>

<p>It is a fact that the very greatness of a mental shock helps
one to bear up against it by producing a sort of temporary insensibility.
I came out of the state-room stunned, as if something heavy had
dropped on my head. From the other side of the saloon, across
the table, Ransome, with a duster in his hand, stared open-mouthed.
I don’t think that I looked wild. It is quite possible that I
appeared to be in a hurry because I was instinctively hastening
up on deck. An example this of training become instinct. The difficulties,
the dangers, the problems of a ship at sea must be met on deck.</p>

<p>To this fact, as it were of nature, I responded instinctively;
which may be taken as a proof that for a moment I must have been
robbed of my reason.</p>

<p>I was certainly off my balance, a prey to impulse, for at the
bottom of the stairs I turned and flung myself at the doorway
of Mr. Burns’ cabin. The wildness of his aspect checked my mental
disorder. He was sitting up in his bunk, his body looking immensely
long, his head drooping a little sideways, with affected complacency.
He flourished, in his trembling hand, on the end of a forearm
no thicker than a walking-stick, a shining pair of scissors which
he tried before my very eyes to jab at his throat.</p>

<p>I was to a certain extent horrified; but it was rather a secondary
sort of effect, not really strong enough to make me yell at him
in some such manner as: "Stop!" . . . "Heavens!" . . . "What are
you doing?"</p>

<p>In reality he was simply overtaxing his returning strength in
a shaky attempt to clip off the thick growth of his red beard.
A large towel was spread over his lap, and a shower of stiff hairs,
like bits of copper wire, was descending on it at every snip of
the scissors.</p>

<p>He turned to me his face grotesque beyond the fantasies of mad
dreams, one cheek all bushy as if with a swollen flame, the other
denuded and sunken, with the untouched long moustache on that
side asserting itself, lonely and fierce. And while he stared
thunderstruck, with the gaping scissors on his fingers, I shouted
my discovery at him fiendishly, in six words, without comment.</p>
