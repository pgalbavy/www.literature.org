AFTER two or three days, when I had established myself in my 
room and had gone backwards and forwards to London several 
times, and had ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr Pocket 
and I had a long talk together. He knew more of my intended career 
than I knew myself, for he referred to his having been told by 
Mr Jaggers that I was not designed for any profession, and that 
I should be well enough educated for my destiny if I could 
`hold my own' with the average of young men in prosperous 
circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the 
contrary. 

<p>He advised my attending certain places in London, for the 
acquisition of such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing 
him with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies. 
He hoped that with intelligent assistance I should meet with little 
to discourage me, and should soon be able to dispense with any aid 
but his. Through his way of saying this, and much more to similar 
purpose, he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an 
admirable manner; and I may state at once that he was always so 
zealous and honourable in fulfilling his compact with me, that he 
made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling mine with him. 
lf he had shown indifference as a master, I have no doubt I should 
have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no such 
excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor, did I ever regard 
him as having anything ludicrous about him -- or anything but 
what was serious, honest, and good -- in his tutor communication 
with me. 

<p>When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that 
I had begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could 
retain my bedroom in Barnard's Inn, my life would be agreeably 
varied, while my manners would be none the worse for Herbert's 
society. Mr Pocket did not object to this arrangement, but urged 
that before any step could possibly be taken in it, it must be sub- 
mitted to my guardian. I felt that his delicacy arose out of the 
consideration that the plan would save Herbert some expense, so l 
went off to Little Britain and imparted my wish to Mr Jaggers. 

<p>`If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,' said I, `and one 
or two other little things, I should be quite at home there.' 

<p>`Go it!' said Mr Jaggers, with a short laugh. `I told you you'd 
get on. Well! How much do you want?' 

<p>I said I didn't know how much. 

<p>`Come!' retorted Mr Jaggers. `How much? Fifty pounds?' 

<p>`Oh, not nearly so much.' 

<p>`Five pounds ?' said Mr Jaggers. 

<p>This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, `Oh! more 
than that.' 

<p>`More than that, eh!' retorted Mr Jaggers, lying in wait for me, 
with his hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on 
the wall behind me; `how much more?' 

<p>`It is so difficult to fix a sum,' said I, hesitating. 

<p>`Come!' said Mr Jaggers. `Let's get at it. Twice five; will that 
do? Three times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?' 

<p>I said I thought that would do handsomely. 

<p>`Four times five will do handsomely, will it?' said Mr Jaggers, 
knitting his brows. `Now, what do you make of four times five?' 

<p>`What do I make of it?' 

<p>`Ah!' said Mr Jaggers; `how much?' 

<p>`I suppose you make it twenty pounds,' said I, smiling. 

<p>`Never mind what I make it, my friend,' observed Mr Jaggers, 
with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head. `I want to 
know what you make it.' 

<p>`Twenty pounds, of course.' 

<p>`Wemmick!' said Mr Jaggers, opening his office door. `Take 
Mr Pip's written order, and pay him twenty pounds.' 

<p>This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly 
marked impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. 
Mr Jaggers never laughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, 
and, in poising himself on these boots, with his large head bent 
down and his eyebrows joined together, awaiting an answer, he 
sometimes caused the boots to creak, as if <I>they</I> laughed in a dry 
and suspicious way. As he happened to go out now, and as Wem- 
mick was brisk and talkative, I said to Wemmick that I hardly 
knew what to make of Mr Jaggers's manner. 

<p>`Tell him that, and he'll take it as a compliment,' answered 
Wemmick; `he don't mean that you <I>should</I> know what to make of 
it. -- Oh!' for I looked surprised, `it's not personal; it's pro- 
fessional: only professional.' 

<p>Wemmick was at his desk, lunching -- and crunching -- on a dry 
hard biscuit; pieces of which he threw from time to time into his 
slit of a mouth, as if he were posting them. 

<p>`Always seems to me,' said Wemmick, `as if he had set a man- 
trap and was watching it. Suddenly -- click -- you're caught!' 

<p>Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities 
of life, I said I supposed he was very skilful? 

<p>`Deep,' said Wemmick, `as Australia.' Pointing with his pen at 
the office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the 
purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot 
of the globe. `If there was anything deeper,' added Wemmick, 
bringing his pen to paper, `he'd be it.' 

<p>Then, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick 
said, `Ca-pi-tal!' Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which 
he replied: 

<p>`We don't run much into clerks, because there's only one 
Jaggers, and people won't have him at second-hand. There are 
only four of us. Would you like to see 'em? You are one of us, 
as I may say.' 

<p>I accepted the offer. When Mr Wemmick had put all the biscuit 
into the post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a 
safe, the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back 
and produced from his coat-collar like an iron pigtail, we went 
up-stairs. The house was dark and shabby, and the greasy shoulders 
that had left their mark in Mr Jaggers's room, seemed to have been 
shuffling up and down the staircase for years. In the front first 
floor, a clerk who looked something between a publican and a 
rat-catcher -- a large pale puffed swollen man -- was attentively 
engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance, whom he 
treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who 
contributed to Mr Jaggers's coffers. `Getting evidence together,' 
said Mr Wemmick, as we came out, `for the Bailey.' In the room 
over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair (his 
cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) 
was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr 
Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always 
boiling, and who would melt me anything I pleased -- and who 
was in an excessive white-perspiration, as if he had been trying his 
art on himself. In a back room, a high-shouldered man with a face- 
ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was dressed in old black clothes 
that bore the appearance of having been waxed, was stooping over 
his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentle- 
men, for Mr Jaggers's own use. 

<p>This was all the establishment. When we went down-stairs 
again, Wemmick led me into my guatdian's room, and said, `This 
you've seen already.' 

<p>`Pray,' said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon 
them caught my sight again, `whose likenesses are those?' 

<p>`These?' said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the 
dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down. `These are 
two celebrated ones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of 
credit. This chap (why you must have come down in the night 
and been peeping into the inkstand, to get this blot upon your 
eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered his master, and, considering 
that he wasn't brought up to evidence, didn't plan it badly.' 

<p>`Is it like him?' I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick 
spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve. 

<p>`Like him? It's himself, you know. The cast was made in New- 
gate, directly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy 
for me, hadn't you, Old Artful?' said Wemmick. He rhen explained 
this affectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing 
the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, 
and saying, `Had it made for me, express!' 

<p>`Is the lady anybody?' said I. 

<p>`No,' returned Wemmick. `Only his game. (You liked your bit 
of game, didn't you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr 
Pip, except one -- and she wasn't of this slender ladylike sort, and 
you wouldn't have caught <I>her</I> looking after this urn -- unless there 
was something to drink in it.' Wemmick's attention being thus 
directed to his brooch, he put down the cast, and polished the 
brooch with his pocket-handkerchief. 

<p>`Did that other creature come to the same end?' I asked. `He 
has the same look.' 

<p>`You're right,' said Wemmick; `it's the genuine look. Much as if 
one nostril was caught up with a horsehair and a little fish-hook. 
Yes, he came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure 
you. He forged wills, this blade did, if he didn't also put the 
supposed testators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, 
though' (Mr Wemmick was again apostrophizing), `and you said 
you could write Greek. Yah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! 
I never met such a liar as you!' Before putting his late friend on his 
shelf again, Wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings, 
and said, `Sent out to buy it for me, only the day before.' 

<p>While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from 
the chair the thought crossed my mind that all his personal 
jewellery was derived from like sources. As he had shown no 
diffidence on the subject, I ventured on the liberty of asking him 
the question, when he stood before me, dusting his hands. 

<p>`Oh yes,' he returned, `these are all gifts of that kind. One 
brings another, you see; that's the way of it. I always take 'em. 
They're curiosities. And they're property. They may not be worth 
much, but, after all, they're property and portable. It don't signify 
to you with your brilliant look-out, but as to myself, my guiding- 
star always is, ``Get hold of portable property ''.' 

<p>When I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in 
a friendly manner: 

<p>`If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you 
wouldn't mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer 
you a bed, and I should consider it an honour. I have not much to 
show you; but such two or three curiosities as I have got, you 
might like to look over; and I am fond of a bit of garden and a 
summer-house.' 

<p>I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality. 

<p>`Thankee,' said he; `then we'll consider that it's to come off, 
when convenient to you. Have you dined with Mr Jaggers yet?' 

<p>`Not yet.' 

<p>`Well,' said Wemrnick, `he'll give you wine, and good wine. 
I'll give you punch, and not bad punch. And now I'll tell you 
something. When you go to dine with Mr Jaggers, look at his 
housekeeper.' 

<p>`Shall I see something very uncommon?' 

<p>`Well ' said Wemmick, `you-ll see a wild beast tamed. Not so 
very uncommon, you'll tell me. I reply, that depends on the 
original wildness of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won't 
lower your opinion of Mr Jaggers's powers. Keep your eye on it.' 

<p>I told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that 
his preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked 
me if I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr Jaggers 
`at it?' 

<p>For several reasons, and not least because I didn't clearly know 
what Mr Jaggers would be found to be `at,' I replied in the affirma- 
tive. We dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police- 
court, where a blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the 
deceased with the fanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the 
bar, uncomfortably chewing something; while my guardian had a 
woman under examination or cross-examination -- I don't know 
which -- and was striking her, and the bench, and everybody 
present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever degree, said a word 
that he didn't approve of, he instantly required to have it `taken 
down.' If anybody wouldn't make an admission, he said, `I'll have 
it out of you!' and if anybody made an admission, he said, `Now 
I have got you!' The magistrates shivered under a single bite of his 
finger. Thieves and thieftakers hung in dread rapture on his words, 
and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction. 
Which side he was on, I couldn't make out, for he seemed to 
me to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when 
I stole out on tiptoe, he was not on the side of the bench; for, he 
was making the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite 
convulsive under the table, by his denunciations of his conduct as 
the representative of British law and justice in that chair that day.
