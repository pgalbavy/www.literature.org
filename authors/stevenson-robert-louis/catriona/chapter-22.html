<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The weather in the end considerably worsened; the wind sang in
the shrouds, the sea swelled higher, and the ship began to labour
and cry out among the billows. The song of the leadsman in the
chains was now scarce ceasing, for we thrid all the way among
shoals. About nine in the morning, in a burst of wintry sun between
two squalls of hail, I had my first look of Holland—a line of
windmills birling in the breeze. It was besides my first knowledge
of these daft-like contrivances, which gave me a near sense of
foreign travel and a new world and life. We came to an anchor
about half-past eleven, outside the harbour of Helvoetsluys, in
a place where the sea sometimes broke and the ship pitched outrageously.
You may be sure we were all on deck save Mrs. Gebbie, some of
us in cloaks, others mantled in the ship’s tarpaulins, all clinging
on by ropes, and jesting the most like old sailor-folk that we
could imitate.</p>

<p>Presently a boat, that was backed like a partancrab, came gingerly
alongside, and the skipper of it hailed our master in the Dutch.
Thence Captain Sang turned, very troubled-like, to Catriona; and
the rest of us crowding about, the nature of the difficulty was
made plain to all. The <em>Rose</em> was bound to the port of
Rotterdam, whither the other passengers were in a great impatience
to arrive, in view of a conveyance due to leave that very evening
in the direction of the Upper Germany. This, with the present
half-gale of wind, the captain (if no time were lost) declared
himself still capable to save. Now James More had trysted in Helvoet
with his daughter, and the captain had engaged to call before
the port and place her (according to the custom) in a shore boat.
There was the boat, to be sure, and here was Catriona ready: but
both our master and the patroon of the boat scrupled at the risk,
and the first was in no humour to delay.</p>

<p>"Your father," said he, "would be gey an little pleased if we
was to break a leg to ye, Miss Drummond, let-a-be drowning of
you. Take my way of it," says he, "and come on-by with the rest
of us here to Rotterdam. Ye can get a passage down the Maes in
a sailing scoot as far as to the Brill, and thence on again, by
a place in a rattel-waggon, back to Helvoet."</p>

<p>But Catriona would hear of no change. She looked white-like as
she beheld the bursting of the sprays, the green seas that sometimes
poured upon the fore-castle, and the perpetual bounding and swooping
of the boat among the billows; but she stood firmly by her father’s
orders. "My father, James More, will have arranged it so," was
her first word and her last. I thought it very idle and indeed
wanton in the girl to be so literal and stand opposite to so much
kind advice; but the fact is she had a very good reason, if she
would have told us. Sailing scoots and rattel-waggons are excellent
things; only the use of them must first be paid for, and all she
was possessed of in the world was just two shillings and a penny
halfpenny sterling. So it fell out that captain and passengers,
not knowing of her destitution—and she being too proud to tell
them—spoke in vain.</p>

<p>"But you ken nae French and nae Dutch neither," said one.</p>

<p>"It is very true," says she, "but since the year ’46 there are
so many of the honest Scotch abroad that I will be doing very
well. I thank you."</p>

<p>There was a pretty country simplicity in this that made some
laugh, others looked the more sorry, and Mr. Gebbie fall outright
in a passion. I believe he knew it was his duty (his wife having
accepted charge of the girl) to have gone ashore with her and
seen her safe: nothing would have induced him to have done so,
since it must have involved the lose of his conveyance; and I
think he made it up to his conscience by the loudness of his voice.
At least he broke out upon Captain Sang, raging and saying the
thing was a disgrace; that it was mere death to try to leave the
ship, and at any event we could not cast down an innocent maid
in a boatful of nasty Holland fishers, and leave her to her fate.
I was thinking something of the same; took the mate upon one side,
arranged with him to send on my chests by track-scoot to an address
I had in Leyden, and stood up and signalled to the fishers.</p>

<p>"I will go ashore with the young lady, Captain Sang," said I.
"It is all one what way I go to Leyden;" and leaped at the same
time into the boat, which I managed not so elegantly but what
I fell with two of the fishers in the bilge.</p>

<p>From the boat the business appeared yet more precarious than
from the ship, she stood so high over us, swung down so swift,
and menaced us so perpetually with her plunging and passaging
upon the anchor cable. I began to think I had made a fool’s bargain,
that it was merely impossible Catriona should be got on board
to me, and that I stood to be set ashore at Helvoet all by myself
and with no hope of any reward but the pleasure of embracing James
More, if I should want to. But this was to reckon without the
lass’s courage. She had seen me leap with very little appearance
(however much reality) of hesitation; to be sure, she was not
to be beat by her discarded friend. Up she stood on the bulwarks
and held by a stay, the wind blowing in her petticoats, which
made the enterprise more dangerous, and gave us rather more of
a view of her stockings than would be thought genteel in cities.
There was no minute lost, and scarce time given for any to interfere
if they had wished the same. I stood up on the other side and
spread my arms; the ship swung down on us, the patroon humoured
his boat nearer in than was perhaps wholly safe, and Catriona
leaped into the air. I was so happy as to catch her, and the fishers
readily supporting us, escaped a fall. She held to me a moment
very tight, breathing quick and deep; thence (she still clinging
to me with both hands) we were passed aft to our places by the
steersman; and Captain Sang and all the crew and passengers cheering
and crying farewell, the boat was put about for shore.</p>

<p>As soon as Catriona came a little to herself she unhanded me
suddenly, but said no word. No more did I; and indeed the whistling
of the wind and the breaching of the sprays made it no time for
speech; and our crew not only toiled excessively but made extremely
little way, so that the <em>Rose</em> had got her anchor and was
off again before we had approached the harbour mouth.</p>

<p>We were no sooner in smooth water than the patroon, according
to their beastly Hollands custom, stopped his boat and required
of us our fares. Two guilders was the man’s demand—between three
and four shillings English money—for each passenger. But at this
Catriona began to cry out with a vast deal of agitation. She had
asked of Captain Sang, she said, and the fare was but an English
shilling. "Do you think I will have come on board and not ask
first?" cries she. The patroon scolded back upon her in a lingo
where the oaths were English and the rest right Hollands; till
at last (seeing her near tears) I privately slipped in the rogue’s
hand six shillings, whereupon he was obliging enough to receive
from her the other shilling without more complaint. No doubt I
was a good deal nettled and ashamed. I like to see folk thrifty,
but not with so much passion; and I daresay it would be rather
coldly that I asked her, as the boat moved on again for shore,
where it was that she was trysted with her father.</p>

<p>"He is to be inquired of at the house of one Sprott, an honest
Scotch merchant," says she; and then with the same breath, "I
am wishing to thank you very much—you are a brave friend to me."</p>

<p>"It will be time enough when I get you to your father," said
I, little thinking that I spoke so true. "I can tell him a fine
tale of a loyal daughter."</p>

<p>"O, I do not think I will be a loyal girl, at all events," she
cried, with a great deal of painfulness in the expression. "I
do not think my heart is true."</p>

<p>"Yet there are very few that would have made that leap, and all
to obey a father’s orders," I observed.</p>

<p>"I cannot have you to be thinking of me so," she cried again.
"When you had done that same, how would I stop behind? And at
all events that was not all the reasons." Whereupon, with a burning
face, she told me the plain truth upon her poverty.</p>

<p>"Good guide us!" cried I, "what kind of daft-like proceeding
is this, to let yourself be launched on the continent of Europe
with an empty purse—I count it hardly decent—scant decent!" I
cried.</p>

<p>"You forget James More, my father, is a poor gentleman," said
she. "He is a hunted exile."</p>

<p>"But I think not all your friends are hunted exiles," I exclaimed.
"And was this fair to them that care for you? Was it fair to me?
was it fair to Miss Grant that counselled you to go, and would
be driven fair horn-mad if she could hear of it? Was it even fair
to these Gregory folk that you were living with, and used you
lovingly? It’s a blessing you have fallen in my hands! Suppose
your father hindered by an accident, what would become of you
here, and you your lee-lone in a strange place? The thought of
the thing frightens me," I said.</p>

<p>"I will have lied to all of them," she replied. "I will have
told them all that I had plenty. I told <em>her</em> too. I could
not be lowering James More to them."</p>

<p>I found out later on that she must have lowered him in the very
dust, for the lie was originally the father’s, not the daughter’s,
and she thus obliged to persevere in it for the man’s reputation.
But at the time I was ignorant of this, and the mere thought of
her destitution and the perils in which see must have fallen,
had ruffled me almost beyond reason.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well," said I, "you will have to learn more sense."</p>

<p>I left her mails for the moment in an inn upon the shore, where
I got a direction for Sprott’s house in my new French, and we
walked there—it was some little way—beholding the place with wonder
as we went. Indeed, there was much for Scots folk to admire: canals
and trees being intermingled with the houses; the houses, each
within itself, of a brave red brick, the colour of a rose, with
steps and benches of blue marble at the cheek of every door, and
the whole town so clean you might have dined upon the causeway.
Sprott was within, upon his ledgers, in a low parlour, very neat
and clean, and set out with china and pictures, and a globe of
the earth in a brass frame. He was a big-chafted, ruddy, lusty
man, with a crooked hard look to him; and he made us not that
much civility as offer us a seat.</p>

<p>"Is James More Macgregor now in Helvoet, sir?" says I.</p>

<p>"I ken nobody by such a name," says he, impatient-like.</p>

<p>"Since you are so particular," says I, "I will amend my question,
and ask you where we are to find in Helvoet one James Drummond,
<em>alias</em> Macgregor, <em>alias</em> James More, late tenant
in Inveronachile?"</p>

<p>"Sir," says he, "he may be in Hell for what I ken, and for my
part I wish he was."</p>

<p>"The young lady is that gentleman’s daughter, sir," said I, "before
whom, I think you will agree with me, it is not very becoming
to discuss his character."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to make either with him, or her, or you!" cries
he in his gross voice.</p>

<p>"Under your favour, Mr. Sprott," said I, "this young lady is
come from Scotland seeking him, and by whatever mistake, was given
the name of your house for a direction. An error it seems to have
been, but I think this places both you and me—who am but her fellow-traveller
by accident—under a strong obligation to help our countrywoman."</p>

<p>"Will you ding me daft?" he cries. "I tell ye I ken naething
and care less either for him or his breed. I tell ye the man owes
me money."</p>

<p>"That may very well be, sir," said I, who was now rather more
angry than himself. "At least, I owe you nothing; the young lady
is under my protection; and I am neither at all used with these
manners, nor in the least content with them."</p>

<p>As I said this, and without particularly thinking what I did,
I drew a step or two nearer to his table; thus striking, by mere
good fortune, on the only argument that could at all affect the
man. The blood left his lusty countenance.</p>

<p>"For the Lord’s sake dinna be hasty, sir!" he cried. "I am truly
wishfu’ no to be offensive. But ye ken, sir, I’m like a wheen
guid-natured, honest, canty auld fellows—my bark is waur nor my
bite. To hear me, ye micht whiles fancy I was a wee thing dour;
but na, na! it’s a kind auld fallow at heart, Sandie Sprott! And
ye could never imagine the fyke and fash this man has been to
me."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said I. "Then I will make that much freedom
with your kindness as trouble you for your last news of Mr. Drummond."</p>

<p>"You’re welcome, sir!" said he. "As for the young leddy (my respects
to her!), he’ll just have clean forgotten her. I ken the man,
ye see; I have lost siller by him ere now. He thinks of naebody
but just himsel’; clan, king, or dauchter, if he can get his wameful,
he would give them a’ the go-by! ay, or his correspondent either.
For there is a sense in whilk I may be nearly almost said to be
his correspondent. The fact is, we are employed thegether in a
business affair, and I think it’s like to turn out a dear affair
for Sandie Sprott. The man’s as guid’s my pairtner, and I give
ye my mere word I ken naething by where he is. He micht be coming
here to Helvoet; he micht come here the morn, he michtnae come
for a twalmouth; I would wonder at naething—or just at the ae
thing, and that’s if he was to pay me my siller. Ye see what way
I stand with it; and it’s clear I’m no very likely to meddle up
with the young leddy, as ye ca’ her. She cannae stop here, that’s
ae thing certain sure. Dod, sir, I’m a lone man! If I was to tak
her in, its highly possible the hellicat would try and gar me
marry her when he turned up."</p>

<p>"Enough of this talk," said I. "I will take the young leddy among
better friends. Give me, pen, ink, and paper, and I will leave
here for James More the address of my correspondent in Leyden.
He can inquire from me where he is to seek his daughter."</p>

<p>This word I wrote and sealed; which while I was doing, Sprott
of his own motion made a welcome offer, to charge himself with
Miss Drummond’s mails, and even send a porter for them to the
inn. I advanced him to that effect a dollar or two to be a cover,
and he gave me an acknowledgment in writing of the sum.</p>

<p>Whereupon (I giving my arm to Catriona) we left the house of
this unpalatable rascal. She had said no word throughout, leaving
me to judge and speak in her place; I, upon my side, had been
careful not to embarrass her by a glance; and even now, although
my heart still glowed inside of me with shame and anger, I made
it my affair to seem quite easy.</p>

<p>"Now," said I, "let us get back to yon same inn where they can
speak the French, have a piece of dinner, and inquire for conveyances
to Rotterdam. I will never be easy till I have you safe again
in the hands of Mrs. Gebbie."</p>

<p>"I suppose it will have to be," said Catriona, "though whoever
will be pleased, I do not think it will be her. And I will remind
you this once again that I have but one shilling, and three baubees."</p>

<p>"And just this once again," said I, "I will remind you it was
a blessing that I came alongst with you."</p>

<p>"What else would I be thinking all this time?" says she, and
I thought weighed a little on my arm. "It is you that are the
good friend to me."</p>
