<p>At last the little party were across the Mississippi.  The Indian
canoe, so injured that it was useless until repaired, was pushed
back into the turbid current and went spinning down the river,
sometimes bumping against the bank and then dancing further from
shore, until striking broadside against a nodding "sawyer," it
overturned, and thereafter resembled an ordinary log, on its way
toward the Gulf.</p>

<p>It was the first time that Jack Carleton had placed foot on Louisiana
soil, and he stood for a moment gazing backward at Kentucky, amid
whose confines he was born and beyond which he never strayed,
except when on an occasional hunting excursion into Ohio.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether I shall ever tread those forests again," he
said to himself; "I can't say that I'm anxious to do so, for there
have always been too many Indians for comfort.  They killed my
father and broke the heart of my mother.  No, Kentucky, good bye,"
he added, turning his face toward the west, with a feeling that
in that direction lay his future home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Deerfoot and Otto took but a few minutes to prepare
for their journey.  The Indian having lost his blanket, held only
the rifle and ammunition by way of superfluous luggage, and it
could not be said that his companions were unduly burdened, since
the runaway colt had relieved them in that respect.</p>

<p>Deerfoot slung his long bow back of his shoulders, as he was
accustomed to do when he wished the unrestrained use of both arms,
and carried the rifle as the others did theirs.</p>

<p>The belief obtained with all three that in leaving Kentucky they
bade good-bye to most of the personal peril to which they had
been subjected.  The reader knows that that section was ravaged
by the fierce Shawanoes, Miamis, Hurons and other tribes who were
implacable in their hostility to the white men, and who did so
much to give it the name of the Dark and Bloody Ground by which
it was so long known.  There were thousands of red men ranging
through the immense province known as Louisiana, and the crack
of the hostile rifle, the war-cry of the dusky chieftain, and
the shock, of mortal combat marked the meeting of the races, whether
on the clearing, in the forest, or in the lonely defile in the
mountain.</p>

<p>In that section to which I have referred more than once, as now
bearing the name of Missouri, the fighting between the whites
and Indians was much less than on the eastern bank of the Mississippi.
It will be understood, therefore, why, when the little company
of friends stood on the western shore, they felt much less concern
than while on the other side.</p>

<p>Less than two days' tramp to the westward lay the young settlement
where dwelt the mother of Jack Carleton, the parents of Otto Relstaub
and a dozen other families who had emigrated thither from Kentucky. 
Far beyond and to the southward among the wildest fastnesses of
the Ozark mountains the young Shawanoe had taken refuge, where
he felt secure against those of his race who hated him with irrestrainable
ferocity.</p>

<p>As it would require no great digression on the part of Deerfoot,
and as it was not to be supposed that time was very valuable to
him, Jack and Otto supposed he would go with them the entire distance
to the log cabin of Jacob Relstaub.  To their surprise, however,
he quietly said he could keep them company only a short time longer.</p>

<p>"I had no doubt you would be with us to the end," said the disappointed
Jack.</p>

<p>"It would make the heart of Deerfoot glad if he could go with
his brothers whom he loves; but he cannot."</p>

<p>"Vot ain't de reason?" asked Otto, unrestrained by the sense
of propriety which held the tongue of Jack silent.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is called yonder," was the reply, pointing south of
the path which lay before the others.</p>

<p>They were silent a minute or so, in the hope that, he would explain
his meaning, but he did not, and even Otto saw that he had no
right to question him further.</p>

<p>Aware that his friends were waiting for him to add something,
Deerfoot continued:</p>

<p>"The path of my brothers is straight, and they will not get down
on their knees to look for the trail.  There are no Shawanoes
among the trees to fire when they are not looking, and Deerfoot
can may no words that will do good."</p>

<p>"It is not that which causes us to hope for your company," replied
Jack, who was standing several feet away from the youthful warrior
and looking in his serious countenance; "but it is because we
like you, not only for what we have heard from others, but for
what we have seen with our own eyes, and for what you have done
for us, that we are loath to part with you."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will go part of the way," the Indian hastened to say,
perceiving the feeling of his friends, "but it cannot be long."</p>

<p>"Far be it from me to question what you do; no right belongs
to me, but I could not let you go without telling bow much we
appreciate what you have done for us, and how much we admire your
noble character."</p>

<p>It was one of the peculiarities of Deerfoot that he never accepted
the most pointed compliment.  When forced to reply to a direct
one, he turned it aside with an indifference which showed he placed
no value upon it.  As Jack Carleton remarked later on, praise
ran from Deerfoot like water from a duck's back.</p>

<p>But another matter forced itself upon the attention of the boys,
who were on their way to the settlement.  It has been stated already
that the father of Otto Relstaub was penurious, miserly, and cruel.
The colt on which the boy had ridden to Coatesville, Kentucky,
and part of the way back again, was the better of the two horses
owned by him.  Its loss was certain to throw him into a great
rage, and doubtless would bring down the severest punishment on
the back and shoulders of the son.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton understood this prospect as well as did Otto himself,
and he was of the belief that a resolute effort should be put
forth to recover the horse.  When the matter was stated to Deerfoot,
his own knowledge of the ill-tempered German caused him to urge
the attempt.  In fact he would have done so, had the case been
otherwise, for the value of the animal was considerable.  Furthermore,
Deerfoot was of the opinion that the colt could be regained without
serious difficulty, and he told them they had little to fear from
hostile Indians.</p>

<p>Had the Shawanoe seen the canoe, loaded to the gunwales with
red men in their war paint, which at that very moment was stealing
close under the Louisiana shore, he would have modified his remarks
to a very considerable extent.</p>

<p>The peculiarly original manner in which the boys crossed the
Mississippi had resulted in carrying them some distance below
the trail that trended to the westward.  As the runaway horse
had undergone the same experience, and as Otto had descried him
when he emerged from the river, it was easy to locate quite closely
the point where he entered Louisiana.</p>

<p>"It ish below vere we don't stands not dis moment," he said,
when they were ready to move off.</p>

<p>"My gracious, Otto," exclaimed Jack, "can't you handle English
a little better than that?  I thought your father was the crookedest
of speech of any person I ever heard, but he can't be any worse
than you."</p>

<p>"Yaw-don't it?" grinned Otto.</p>

<p>"Try to improve yourself!  You ain't much of a fool on other
matters, and you may as well learn to talk like a civilized being.
I have seen Deerfoot shocked more than once at the horrible style
in which you mangle the king's English.  I want you to promise
to make an effort to do better; will you?"</p>

<p>"Yaw; I dinks not efery dimes dot I does much better as nefer
vos; vot doesn't you dinks not apout it, eh-don't it?  Yaw!"</p>

<p>Deerfoot had taken a couple of steps along the bank with the
purpose of hunting the hoof-prints of the missing horse, but he
paused and half turned about, looking with an amused expression
at his friends who were holding their characteristic conversation.</p>

<p>There was something noteworthy in the fact that while Otto had
heard the English tongue spoken quite correctly, from the hour
he was able to toddle out doors, he could not compare in his lingual
skill to Deerfoot, who had never attempted a word of the language
until wounded and taken prisoner by the whites.  What caused all
this difference?</p>

<p>The same thing which distinguishes one man from another, and
crowns failure with success, or reverses it, as the case may be&mdash;brains.</p>

<p>The three youths moved down the bank in an irregular Indian file,
for no one saw the need of extra precaution.  Deerfoot was about
a rod in advance, walking with a brisk step, for his searching
eyes took in everything in the field of vision, and the trail
for which he was searching was sure to be marked with a distinctness
that could permit no mistake.</p>

<p>It was the same apparently endless forest which met their eyes
when they looked across from Kentucky, and which seemed to encroach
on the borders of the river itself, as though envious of its space.
There was little undergrowth, and they advanced without difficulty.</p>

<p>"I dinks be ish close to vere de colt goomes owet", said Otto,
his words uttered with such deliberation that it was manifest
he was doing his best to heed the appeal of the young Kentuckian.</p>

<p>"That is a decided improvement," Jack hastened to say, with an
approving smile.  "You don't pronounce very well, but you built
up that sentence better than usual."</p>

<p>"Dot's vot I dinks no times, yaw &mdash;I means dot ish vot I
dinks mine Belf."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Jack, reaching out and patting his shoulder; "if
you will devote a few minutes to hard thought before speaking
a single word, you will improve until one of these days you will
be able to speak as well as Deerfoot."</p>

<p>"Yaw, dot ish nodings&mdash;yaw, holds on I dinks hard!" exclaimed
Otto, resolutely checking himself until he could gain time to
frame the expression he had in mind.  But before he succeeded,
a slight exclamation from Deerfoot made own his discovery of the
trail for which they were hunting.</p>

<p>The others hastened to his side, and looking at the ground, saw
the hoof-prints of the horse that had run away with Otto Relstaub. 
As the animal was well shod, there could be no mistaking the trail,
differing from that of the Indian ponies, which, as a matter of
course, were without such protection for their feet.</p>

<p>"Yaw, dot ish him," remarked the German, his effort being to
surprise Deerfoot as well as to please Jack Carleton by the correctness
of his diction.</p>

<p>A brief examination of the foot-prints showed that the colt had
taken matters leisurely after emerging from the Mississippi. Instead
of breaking into a gallop and plunging straight into the woods,
he had halted long enough to eat what little grass grew within
reach, after which he wandered off for more.</p>

<p>The trail was followed several hundred yards, until a rising
ground was reached.  It was observed that for the distance named,
the colt was following a course slightly north of west-the very
one which, if persevered in long enough, would take him to the
log cabin of his owner.</p>

<p>Deerfoot said it was likely that the animal had set out of his
own accord to go home, and, provided he was not secured by some
wandering Indians, it was more than likely he would arrive at
that point in advance of the boys themselves.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton held the same views, and Otto, after taking a full
minute to shape up his ideas, said with great impressiveness:</p>

<p>"Dot ish vot I dinks as&mdash;yaw, I dinks dot."</p>

<p>"Hold on," interrupted Jack, raising his hand with a laugh; "you
have it straight now; don't spoil it by trying to improve it."</p>

<p>Otto nodded his head and held his peace.  He was wise when he
did so.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was on the point of adding an encouraging remark, when
his keen vision detected something a short distance in advance
which claimed his attention.  Without a word, he motioned for
them to hold their peace, and then ran rapidly several paces toward
that which had caught his eye.</p>
