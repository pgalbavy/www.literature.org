<P>
HE was a young man, not more than twenty-four or five, and he
might have sat his horse with the careless grace of his youth
had he not been so catlike and tense. His black eyes roved
everywhere, catching the movements of twigs and branches where
small birds hopped, questing ever onward through the changing
vistas of trees and brush, and returning always to the clumps
of undergrowth on either side. And as he watched, so did he
listen, though he rode on in silence, save for the boom of
heavy guns from far to the west. This had been sounding
monotonously in his ears for hours, and only its cessation
could have aroused his notice. For he had business closer to
hand. Across his saddle-bow was balanced a carbine.
<P>
So tensely was he strung, that a bunch of quail, exploding into
flight from under his horse's nose, startled him to such an
extent that automatically, instantly, he had reined in and
fetched the carbine halfway to his shoulder. He grinned
sheepishly, recovered himself, and rode on. So tense was he, so
bent upon the work he had to do, that the sweat stung his eyes
unwiped, and unheeded rolled down his nose and spattered his
saddle pommel. The band of his cavalryman's hat was
fresh-stained with sweat. The roan horse under him was likewise
wet. It was high noon of a breathless day of heat. Even the
birds and squirrels did not dare the sun, but sheltered in
shady hiding places among the trees.
<P>
Man and horse were littered with leaves and dusted with yellow
pollen, for the open was ventured no more than was compulsory.
They kept to the brush and trees, and invariably the man halted
and peered out before crossing a dry glade or naked stretch of
upland pasturage. He worked always to the north, though his way
was devious, and it was from the north that he seemed most to
apprehend that for which he was looking. He was no coward, but
his courage was only that of the average civilized man, and he
was looking to live, not die.
<P>
Up a small hillside he followed a cowpath through such dense
scrub that he was forced to dismount and lead his horse. But
when the path swung around to the west, he abandoned it and
headed to the north again along the oak-covered top of the
ridge.
<P>
The ridge ended in a steep descent-so steep that he zigzagged
back and forth across the face of the slope, sliding and
stumbling among the dead leaves and matted vines and keeping a
watchful eye on the horse above that threatened to fall down
upon him. The sweat ran from him, and the pollen-dust, settling
pungently in mouth and nostrils, increased his thirst. Try as
he would, nevertheless the descent was noisy, and frequently he
stopped, panting in the dry heat an d listening for any warning
from beneath.
<P>
At the bottom he came out on a flat, so densely forested that
he could not make out its extent. Here the character of the
woods changed, and he was able to remount. Instead of the
twisted hillside oaks, tall straight trees, big-trunked and
prosperous, rose from the damp fat soil. Only here and there
were thickets, easily avoided, while he encountered winding,
park-like glades where the cattle had pastured in the days
before war had run them off.
<P>
His progress was more rapid now, as he came down into the
valley, and at the end of half an hour he halted at an ancient
rail fence on the edge of a clearing. He did not like the
openness of it, yet his path lay across to the fringe of trees
that marked the banks of the stream. It was a mere quarter of a
mile across that open, but the thought of venturing out in it
was repugnant. A rifle, a score of them, a thousand, might lurk
in that fringe by the stream.
<P>
Twice he essayed to start, and twice he paused. He was appalled
by his own loneliness. The pulse of war that beat from the West
suggested the companionship of battling thousands; here was
naught but silence, and himself, and possible death-dealing
bullets from a myriad ambushes. And yet his task was to find
what he feared to find. He must on, and on, till somewhere,
some time, he encountered another man, or other men, from the
other side, scouting, as he was scouting, to make report, as he
must make report, of having come in touch.
<P>
Changing his mind, he skirted inside the woods for a distance,
and again peeped forth. This time, in the middle of the
clearing, he saw a small farmhouse. There were no signs of
life. No smoke curled from the chimney, not a barnyard fowl
clucked and strutted. The kitchen door stood open, and he gazed
so long and hard into the black aperture that it seemed almost
that a farmer's wife must emerge at any moment.
<P>
He licked the pollen and dust from his dry lips, stiffened
himself, mind and body, and rode out into the blazing sunshine.
Nothing stirred. He went on past the house, and approached the
wall of trees and bushes by the river's bank. One thought
persisted maddeningly. It was of the crash into his body of a
high-velocity bullet. It made him feel very fragile and
defenseless, and he crouched lower in the saddle.
<P>
Tethering his horse in the edge of the wood, he continued a
hundred yards on foot till he came to the stream. Twenty feet
wide it was, without perceptible current, cool and inviting,
and he was very thirsty. But he waited inside his screen of
leafage, his eyes fixed on the screen on the opposite side. To
make the wait endurable, he sat down, his carbine resting on
his knees. The minutes passed, and slowly his tenseness
relaxed. At last he decided there was no danger; but just as he
prepared to part the bushes and bend down to the water, a
movement among the opposite bushes caught his eye.
<P>
It might be a bird. But he waited. Again there was an agitation
of the bushes, and then, so suddenly that it almost startled a
cry from him, the bushes parted and a face peered out. It was a
face covered with several weeks' growth of ginger-colored
beard. The eyes were blue and wide apart, with
laughter-wrinkles in the comers that showed despite the tired
and anxious expression of the whole face.
<P>
All this he could see with microscopic clearness, for the
distance was no more than twenty feet. And all this he saw in
such brief time, that he saw it as he lifted his carbine to his
shoulder. He glanced along the sights, and knew that he was
gazing upon a man who was as good as dead. It was impossible to
miss at such point blank range.
<P>
But he did not shoot. Slowly he lowered the carbine and
watched. A hand, clutching a water-bottle, became visible and
the ginger beard bent downward to fill the bottle. He could
hear the gurgle of the water. Then arm and bottle and ginger
beard disappeared behind the closing bushes. A long time he
waited, when, with thirst unslaked, he crept back to his horse,
rode slowly across the sun-washed clearing, and passed into the
shelter of the woods beyond.
<P>

<P>
Another day, hot and breathless. A deserted farmhouse, large,
with many outbuildings and an orchard, standing in a clearing.
From the Woods, on a roan horse, carbine across pommel, rode
the young man with the quick black eyes. He breathed with
relief as he gained the house. That a fight had taken place
here earlier in the season was evident. Clips and empty
cartridges, tarnished with verdigris, lay on the ground, which,
while wet, had been torn up by the hoofs of horses. Hard by the
kitchen garden were graves, tagged and numbered. From the oak
tree by the kitchen door, in tattered, weatherbeaten garments,
hung the bodies of two men. The faces, shriveled and defaced,
bore no likeness to the faces of men. The roan horse snorted
beneath them, and the rider caressed and soothed it and tied it
farther away.
<P>
Entering the house, he found the interior a wreck. He trod on
empty cartridges as he walked from room to room to reconnoiter
from the windows. Men had camped and slept everywhere, and on
the floor of one room he came upon stains unmistakable where
the wounded had been laid down.
<P>
Again outside, he led the horse around behind the barn and
invaded the orchard. A dozen trees were burdened with ripe
apples. He filled his pockets, eating while he picked. Then a
thought came to him, and he glanced at the sun, calculating the
time of his return to camp. He pulled off his shirt, tying the
sleeves and making a bag. This he proceeded to fill with
apples.
<P>
As he was about to mount his horse, the animal suddenly pricked
up its ears. The man, too, listened, and heard, faintly, the
thud of hoofs on soft earth. He crept to the corner of the barn
and peered out. A dozen mounted men, strung out loosely,
approaching from the opposite side of the clearing, were only a
matter of a hundred yards or so away. They rode on to the
house. Some dismounted, while others remained in the saddle as
an earnest that their stay would be short. They seemed to be
holding a council, for he could hear them talking excitedly in
the detested tongue of the alien invader. The time passed, but
they seemed unable to reach a decision. He put the carbine away
in its boot, mounted, and waited impatiently, balancing the
shirt of apples on the pommel.
<P>
He heard footsteps approaching, and drove his spurs so fiercely
into the roan as to force a surprised groan from the animal as
it leaped forward. At the comer of the barn he saw the
intruder, a mere boy of nineteen or twenty for all of his
uniform jump back to escape being run down. At the same moment
the roan swerved and its rider caught a glimpse of the aroused
men by the house. Some were springing from their horses, and he
could see the rifles going to their shoulders. He passed the
kitchen door and the dried corpses swinging in the shade,
compelling his foes to run around the front of the house. A
rifle cracked, and a second, but he was going fast, leaning
forward, low in the saddle, one hand clutching the shirt of
apples, the other guiding the horse.
<P>
The top bar of the fence was four feet high, but he knew his
roan and leaped it at full career to the accompaniment of
several scattered shots. Eight hundred yards straight away were
the woods, and the roan was covering the distance with mighty
strides. Every man was now firing. pumping their guns so
rapidly that he no longer heard individual shots. A bullet went
through his hat, but he was unaware, though he did know when
another tore through the apples on the pommel. And he winced
and ducked even lower when a third bullet, fired low, struck a
stone between his horse's legs and ricochetted off through the
air, buzzing and humming like some incredible insect.
<P>
The shots died down as the magazines were emptied, until,
quickly, there was no more shooting. The young man was elated.
Through that astonishing fusillade he had come unscathed. He
glanced back. Yes, they had emptied their magazines. He could
see several reloading. Others were running back behind the
house for their horses. As he looked, two already mounted, came
back into view around the comer, riding hard. And at the same
moment, he saw the man with the unmistakable ginger beard kneel
down on the ground, level his gun, and coolly take his time for
the long shot.
<P>
The young man threw his spurs into the horse, crouched very
low, and swerved in his flight in order to distract the other's
aim. And still the shot did not come. With each jump of the
horse, the woods sprang nearer. They were only two hundred
yards away and still the shot was delayed.
<P>
And then he heard it, the last thing he was to hear, for he was
dead ere he hit the ground in the long crashing fall from the
saddle. And they, watching at the house, saw him fall, saw his
body bounce when it struck the earth, and saw the burst of
red-cheeked apples that rolled about him. They laughed at the
unexpected eruption of apples, and clapped their hands in
applause of the long shot by the man with the ginger beard.
