<p>
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pursued it with forks and hope;<br/>
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They charmed it with smiles and soap.

</p>
<p>
They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Beaver, excited at last,<br/>
Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the daylight was nearly past.

</p>
<p>
"There is Thingumbob shouting!" the Bellman said,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is shouting like mad, only hark!<br/>
He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has certainly found a Snark!"

</p>
<p>
They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was always a desperate wag!"<br/>
&nbsp;They beheld him&mdash;their Baker&mdash;their hero unnamed&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top of a neighboring crag.

</p>
<p>
Erect and sublime, for one moment of time.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next, that wild figure they saw<br/>
(As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they waited and listened in awe.

</p>
<p>
"It’s a Snark!" was the sound that first came to their ears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seemed almost too good to be true.<br/>
Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the ominous words "It’s a Boo-"

</p>
<p>
Then, silence.  Some fancied they heard in the air<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A weary and wandering sigh<br/>
Then sounded like "-jum!" but the others declare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only a breeze that went by.

</p>
<p>
They hunted till darkness came on, but they found<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a button, or feather, or mark,<br/>
By which they could tell that they stood on the ground<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Baker had met with the Snark.

</p>
<p>
In the midst of the word he was trying to say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of his laughter and glee,<br/>
He had softly and suddenly vanished away&mdash;-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Snark <em>was</em> a Boojum, you see.

</p>
<p>
<em>THE END</em>
