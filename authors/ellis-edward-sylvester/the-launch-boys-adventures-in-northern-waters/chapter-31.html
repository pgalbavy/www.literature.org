<p>The records show that not long ago there were a number of post
office robberies among the towns and villages in that section
of Maine to which some attention has been given in the preceding
pages. Not all the guilty parties were captured, but we know of
two, or rather three, who were caught in the toils. Two of them,
Kit Woodford and Graff Miller, were convicted in the United States
Court at Portland, for, to use a common expression, they were
caught with the goods on them, and sentenced to long terms in
the Atlanta penitentiary. There they are sure to stay for an indefinite
time to come, provided they are not soon released on parole, or
pardoned on the ground of poor health. Let us hope for better
things.</p>

<p>During the trial of the criminals inquiries were heard for the
third member of the gang, but he seemed to have vanished as completely
as if the earth had opened and swallowed him. Possibly the Judge
learned all the facts from Detective Calvert and saw that justice
would be best served by winking at the youth's offence. Moreover,
an officer of the law cannot be punished for the escape of a prisoner
unless gross carelessness or collusion is proved, which was not
easy in the case named. Be that as it may, Orestes Noxon no longer
exists. In his place rises another young man, "redeemed and disenthralled"&mdash;a
brand plucked from the burning. The grandest work of our penal
institution is that of reforming instead of wreaking revenge upon
the erring ones. It certainly proved so in the instance named.
The parents of the youth knew he had strayed from the narrow path,
but it will be a long time before they learn how far his wayward
footsteps led him. There is no need of their ever knowing the
painful truth. Detective Calvert simply told the grateful father
that his boy had gotten into bad company, but the error could
never be repeated, nor can I believe it ever will be.</p>

<p>One day Gideon Landon, the wealthy banker and capitalist of New
York, received a characteristic letter from his son Alvin. He
said his motor boat <em>Deerfoot</em> had been housed for the
winter, there to remain until next summer, and he and Chester
Haynes had had the time of their lives, for which they could never
thank the kind parent enough. The son meant to prove his gratitude
by acts instead of words, for he intended to buckle down to hard
work and not rest until he was through West Point and had become
General of the United States Army. He added:</p>

<p>  "And now, my dear father, I want you to do a favor or two for
me,   Chester and Mike Murphy, who is one of the best fellows
that ever   lived. Some time I shall tell you all our experience
after you left   the bungalow on Southport Island. I know you
will agree with what I   say.</p>

<p>  "Please send to 'Uncle Ben Trotwood,' Trevett, on Hodgdon Island,  
Boothbay Township, Maine, a big lot of fine smoking tobacco. While  
you are about it you may as well make it half a ton, more or less.  
In his old age, he doesn't do much else but smoke, eat, sleep,
and   talk bass, but he was very kind to Chester and me. He kept
us   overnight and fed us, and was insulted when we wished to
pay him."   (No reference was made to Uncle Ben's frugal wife.)</p>

<p>The genial old man would never have solved the mystery of the
arrival of the big consignment of the weed had it not been accompanied
by a letter from the two boys in which all was made clear.</p>

<p>(Another paragraph from Alvin's communication to his father.)</p>

<p>  "In the little town or village of Beartown live the sweetest
mother   and daughter in the State of Maine. Anyhow, there is
none kinder and   more loving. The name of the daughter, who isn't
out of short dresses   yet, is Nora Friestone. Send her a fine
first class piano&mdash;no   second-hand one&mdash;with about a bushel of
music. Select any stuff you   choose, not forgetting a copy of
'The Sweet Long Ago,' published by   C. W. Thompson, Boston. I
wish you could have heard Mike Murphy sing   that for them. He
has one of the finest voices in the world. If he   would only
study and cultivate it, he would be a second Caruso. I   will
send an explanatory letter to Mrs. Friestone, so you needn't  
bother to write her."</p>

<p>And the Steinway duly reached its destination. Mother and daughter
were overwhelmed. They would have insisted that a tremendous mistake
had been made had not a letter reached them at the same time from
the bungalow. This was signed by Chester Haynes, Mike Murphy and
Alvin Landon. It begged Miss Nora to accept the present as a token
of their appreciation of the hospitality received by them, and
in memory of an interesting night they had spent in the Friestone
home not long before. Nora wrote one of the most delightful replies
that goodness and innocence could pen, and assured the donors
that the prayers of her mother and herself would follow the three
as long as mother and daughter lived.</p>

<p>(Another paragraph from Alvin's communication to his father.)</p>

<p>  "You must understand that the expense of these presents, including  
that which follows, is borne by you and Mr. Haynes. He knew all  
about them and is as ardent as we. He says he is sure you will
be   as glad as he to help in so good a cause.</p>

<p>  "One more trifling gift and I shall be through. About a half
mile   from Beartown lives a poor Irish day laborer known to every
one as   Tam McCaffry. Chester and I did not have the pleasure
of meeting   him, but Mike spent some time at his home, where
his big, jolly   wife proved herself the soul of hospitality.
She is Irish through   and through. Mr. Calvert saw her and says
the great attraction of   the woman, aside from her natural goodness,
is that she is the only   person he has yet met who in the way
of repartee and wit could give   Mike as good as he sent. It was
a treat to hear the two spar, and   Mike admitted that he had
met his match.</p>

<p>  "Send her a pianola. Her hands are too big and untrained to
master   the keys of a piano, but there is nothing the matter
with her feet,   which is all she needs to work one of those contrivances.
Don't   forget to include a whole lot of music, which should be
of the   Irish vintage, such as Moore's melodies, 'Sweet Mavoureen,'
'The   Rocky Road to Dublin,' 'St. Patrick's Day in the Morning,'
'Rory   O'Moore,' and so on. Be sure that the expense is prepaid
all the   way to the McCaffry door. Mike is specially interested
in this   present and contributes more than both of us, for he
gives his all,   the same being twenty-five cents, and to him
we have assigned the   duty of explaining things to the good woman."</p>

<p>Alvin had his father well trained, and he cheerfully granted
every request of his son. He smiled and remarked to his wife after
reading the letter to her:</p>

<p>"Alvin has never caused us an hour of anxiety. He would not ask
these things without good reason. I shall give orders when I go
to the office that everything he wishes shall be done."</p>

<p>"That was rather nice on the part of Mr. Haynes to say what he
did of you, Gideon."</p>

<p>"Yes, Franklin hasn't anything mean in his nature."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it a pity that while his boy and ours are so
fond of each other their fathers are not on speaking terms?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, but there must always be two persons to a quarrel."</p>

<p>"And you are one of them in this case. I mean to call on Sophia
this very day."</p>

<p>"Haynes flew up before he had time to understand all the facts
in that little affair of ours. If he had waited he would have
found that he had no cause for grievance."</p>

<p>"Suppose you call on him."</p>

<p>The banker shook his head.</p>

<p>"That is asking too much; it would be humiliating."</p>

<p>Now when a sensible wife makes up her mind that her husband shall
do a certain thing, and when that husband wishes to do it, but
allows a false pride to hold him back, you may make up your mind
that the aforesaid thing will be done with no unnecessary delay.</p>

<p>So it was that Gideon Landon went to Franklin Haynes and they
had not talked ten minutes when the cloud between them vanished.
Friendship and full trust were restored and can never be broken
again. It was another illustration of the good that often flows
from small deeds and even smaller words.</p>

<p>(Mike Murphy's letter to Mrs. McCaffry.)</p>

<p>  "MY <em>DEAR AUNT MAGGIE</em>:</p>

<p>  "I'm thinking that about the time this luv letter raiches ye,
an   insthrumint will do the same, which the name is peeanoler,
or   something like that. I beg ye to accipt the thrifle as a
prisent   from Captain Landon, Second Mate Haynes and First Mate
mesilf. I   know Misther Noxon would crack his heels togither
fur the chance of   j'ining wid us, but he forgot to lave his
card and I suspict he's   sailed for Europe not to be back fur
fifteen or twinty years, as   was the case wid me great uncle
whin he sailed for Botny Bay.</p>

<p>  "The peagnoluh   &mdash;I'm thrying all ways of spelling the
name of the   blamed thing so as to get the same right wunst any
way&mdash;is played   wid the feet. You slide the sheet wid the holes
punched into 'em   into the wrack over the keeze and then wurrk
the feet up and down   like yer husband Tana used to do at home
in the treadmill.</p>

<p>  "Don't try to sing along wid the music for somebody might hear
ye.   Me worry is that yer teeny Sinderilla feet won't be able
to wurruk   the peddles, and if ye put on the shoes ye wore whin
hanging out   the clothes, there wont be room in the house for
the peanholler, so   ye might try the same widout yer shoes and
stockings.</p>

<p>(Mrs. McCaffry's reply to the foregoing.)</p>

<p>  "My darlint broth of a boy:</p>

<p>  "It tuk me and Tam 2 nights and 3 days to understand the maaning
of   the action of Jim Doogan the carter in drawing up his taam
to our   risidence and tumbling out a big shiny box wid the remark
that   there wasn't a cint to pay. Tam hadn't got home and Jim
carried the   purty thing into the parler and leaned it aginst
the flure. He had   obsarved something of the kind in his travels
and he showed me how   to wurruk it wid me faat. Whin he slipped
in one of the shaats of   paper, wid hundreds of little kriss-kross
holes through it, sot   down on the stule and wobbled his butes,
and 'Killarney' filled the   room, I let out a hoop, kicked off
me satan slippers, danced a jig   and shouted, 'For the love of
Mike!' which the same is thrue, that   being yer name.</p>

<p>  "My number 10 shoes fit the peddlers as yer snub nose fits
yer   freckled face. Tam and me spind the time whin we aint slaaping
or   eating or working in playing the thing and thinking of yersilf
and   the byes you spake of.</p>

<p>  "Me darling Mike, may the birds wake ye aich morning wid their  
swaat songs of praise and soothe ye to slaap in the avening; may  
the sun shine fur ye ivery day through; may yer draams be of angels  
and no man or woman spake anything but wurruds of love to ye;
and   whin old age bows yer head and the time comes to lave us
all, may   ye be welcomed to heaven wid the blessed graating:
'Well done, good   and faithful servant!'</p>

<p>  "Do you and the other byes come soon and see what a happy home
ye   have made for Tam and me.</p>
