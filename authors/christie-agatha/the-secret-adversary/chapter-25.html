<p><em>HER </em>arm through Jane’s, dragging her along, Tuppence
reached the station. Her quick ears caught the sound of the approaching
train.</p>

<p>"Hurry up," she panted, "or we’ll miss it."</p>

<p>They arrived on the platform just as the train came to a standstill.
Tuppence opened the door of an empty first-class compartment,
and the two girls sank down breathless on the padded seats.</p>

<p>A man looked in, then passed on to the next carriage. Jane started
nervously. Her eyes dilated with terror. She looked questioningly
at Tuppence.</p>

<p>"Is he one of them, do you think?" she breathed.</p>

<p>Tuppence shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, no. It’s all right." She took Jane’s hand in hers. "Tommy
wouldn’t have told us to do this unless he was sure we’d be all
right."</p>

<p>"But he doesn’t know them as I do!" The girl shivered. "You can’t
understand. Five years! Five long years! Sometimes I thought I
should go mad."</p>

<p>"Never mind. It’s all over."</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p>The train was moving now, speeding through the night at a gradually
increasing rate. Suddenly Jane Finn started up.</p>

<p>"What was that? I thought I saw a face&mdash;looking in through the
window."</p>

<p>"No, there’s nothing. See." Tuppence went to the window, and
lifting the strap let the pane down.</p>

<p>"You’re sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure."</p>

<p>The other seemed to feel some excuse was necessary:</p>

<p>"I guess I’m acting like a frightened rabbit, but I can’t help
it. If they caught me now they’d&#11834;" Her eyes opened wide and
staring.</p>

<p>"<em>Don’t!</em>" implored Tuppence. "Lie back, and <em>don’t
think</em>. You can be quite sure that Tommy wouldn’t have said
it was safe if it wasn’t."</p>

<p>"My cousin didn’t think so. He didn’t want us to do this."</p>

<p>"No," said Tuppence, rather embarrassed.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of?" said Jane sharply.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Your voice was so&mdash;queer!"</p>

<p>"I <em>was</em> thinking of something," confessed Tuppence. "But
I don’t want to tell you&mdash;not now. I may be wrong, but I don’t
think so. It’s just an idea that came into my head a long time
ago. Tommy’s got it too &mdash;I’m almost sure he has. But don’t
<em>you</em> worry&mdash;there’ll be time enough for that later. And
it mayn’t be so at all! Do what I tell you&mdash;lie back and don’t
think of anything."</p>

<p>"I’ll try." The long lashes drooped over the hazel eyes.</p>

<p>Tuppence, for her part, sat bolt upright&mdash;much in the attitude
of a watchful terrier on guard. In spite of herself she was nervous.
Her eyes flashed continually from one window to the other. She
noted the exact position of the communication cord. What it was
that she feared, she would have been hard put to it to say. But
in her own mind she was far from feeling the confidence displayed
in her words. Not that she disbelieved in Tommy, but occasionally
she was shaken with doubts as to whether anyone so simple and
honest as he was could ever be a match for the fiendish subtlety
of the arch-criminal.</p>

<p>If they once reached Sir James Peel Edgerton in safety, all would
be well. But would they reach him? Would not the silent forces
of Mr. Brown already be assembling against them? Even that last
picture of Tommy, revolver in hand, failed to comfort her. By
now he might be overpowered, borne down by sheer force of numbers....
Tuppence mapped out her plan of campaign.</p>

<p>As the train at length drew slowly into Charing Cross, Jane Finn
sat up with a start.</p>

<p>"Have we arrived? I never thought we should!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought we’d get to London all right. If there’s going
to be any fun, now is when it will begin. Quick, get out. We’ll
nip into a taxi."</p>

<p>In another minute they were passing the barrier, had paid the
necessary fares, and were stepping into a taxi.</p>

<p>"King’s Cross," directed Tuppence. Then she gave a jump. A man
looked in at the window, just as they started. She was almost
certain it was the same man who had got into the carriage next
to them. She had a horrible feeling of being slowly hemmed in
on every side.</p>

<p>"You see," she explained to Jane, "if they think we’re going
to Sir James, this will put them off the scent. Now they’ll imagine
we’re going to Mr. Carter. His country place is north of London
somewhere."</p>

<p>Crossing Holborn there was a block, and the taxi was held up.
This was what Tuppence had been waiting for.</p>

<p>"Quick," she whispered. "Open the right-hand door!"</p>

<p>The two girls stepped out into the traffic. Two minutes later
they were seated in another taxi and were retracing their steps,
this time direct to Carlton House Terrace.</p>

<p>"There," said Tuppence, with great satisfaction, "this ought
to do them. I can’t help thinking that I’m really rather clever!
How that other taxi man will swear! But I took his number, and
I’ll send him a postal order to-morrow, so that he won’t lose
by it if he happens to be genuine. What’s this thing swerving-&mdash;Oh!"</p>

<p>There was a grinding noise and a bump. Another taxi had collided
with them.</p>

<p>In a flash Tuppence was out on the pavement. A policeman was
approaching. Before he arrived Tuppence had handed the driver
five shillings, and she and Jane had merged themselves in the
crowd.</p>

<p>"It’s only a step or two now," said Tuppence breathlessly. The
accident had taken place in Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p>"Do you think the collision was an accident, or done deliberately?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know. It might have been either."</p>

<p>Hand-in-hand, the two girls hurried along.</p>

<p>"It may be my fancy," said Tuppence suddenly, "but I feel as
though there was some one behind us."</p>

<p>"Hurry!" murmured the other. "Oh, hurry!"</p>

<p>They were now at the corner of Carlton House Terrace, and their
spirits lightened. Suddenly a large and apparently intoxicated
man barred their way.</p>

<p>"Good evening, ladies," he hiccupped. "Whither away so fast?"</p>

<p>"Let us pass, please," said Tuppence imperiously.</p>

<p>"Just a word with your pretty friend here." He stretched out
an unsteady hand, and clutched Jane by the shoulder. Tuppence
heard other footsteps behind. She did not pause to ascertain whether
they were friends or foes. Lowering her head, she repeated a manœuvre
of childish days, and butted their aggressor full in the capacious
middle. The success of these unsportsmanlike tactics was immediate.
The man sat down abruptly on the pavement. Tuppence and Jane took
to their heels. The house they sought was some way down. Other
footsteps echoed behind them. Their breath was coming in choking
gasps as they reached Sir James’s door. Tuppence seized the bell
and Jane the knocker.</p>

<p>The man who had stopped them reached the foot of the steps. For
a moment he hesitated, and as he did so the door opened. They
fell into the hall together. Sir James came forward from the library
door.</p>

<p>"Hullo! What’s this?"</p>

<p>He stepped forward, and put his arm round Jane as she swayed
uncertainly. He half carried her into the library, and laid her
on the leather couch. From a tantalus on the table he poured out
a few drops of brandy, and forced her to drink them. With a sigh
she sat up, her eyes still wild and frightened.</p>

<p>"It’s all right. Don’t be afraid, my child. You’re quite safe."</p>

<p>Her breath came more normally, and the colour was returning to
her cheeks. Sir James looked at Tuppence quizzically.</p>

<p>"So you’re not dead, Miss Tuppence, any more than that Tommy
boy of yours was!"</p>

<p>"The Young Adventurers take a lot of killing," boasted Tuppence.</p>

<p>"So it seems," said Sir James dryly. "Am I right in thinking
that the joint venture has ended in success, and that this"&mdash;he
turned to the girl on the couch&mdash;"is Miss Jane Finn?"</p>

<p>Jane sat up.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said quietly, "I am Jane Finn. I have a lot to tell
you."</p>

<p>"When you are stronger&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;now!" Her voice rose a little. "I shall feel safer when
I have told everything."</p>

<p>"As you please," said the lawyer.</p>

<p>He sat down in one of the big arm-chairs facing the couch. In
a low voice Jane began her story.</p>

<p>"I came over on the <em>Lusitania</em> to take up a post in Paris.
I was fearfully keen about the war, and just dying to help somehow
or other. I had been studying French, and my teacher said they
were wanting help in a hospital in Paris, so I wrote and offered
my services, and they were accepted. I hadn’t got any folk of
my own, so it made it easy to arrange things.</p>

<p>"When the <em>Lusitania</em> was torpedoed, a man came up to
me. I’d noticed him more than once&mdash;and I’d figured it out in
my own mind that he was afraid of somebody or something. He asked
me if I was a patriotic American, and told me he was carrying
papers which were just life or death to the Allies. He asked me
to take charge of them. I was to watch for an advertisement in
the <em>Times</em>. If it didn’t appear, I was to take them to
the American Ambassador.</p>

<p>"Most of what followed seems like a nightmare still. I see it
in my dreams sometimes.... I’ll hurry over that part. Mr. Danvers
had told me to watch out. He might have been shadowed from New
York, but he didn’t think so. At first I had no suspicions, but
on the boat to Holyhead I began to get uneasy. There was one woman
who had been very keen to look after me, and chum up with me generally&mdash;a
Mrs. Vandemeyer. At first I’d been only grateful to her for being
so kind to me; but all the time I felt there was something about
her I didn’t like, and on the Irish boat I saw her talking to
some queer-looking men, and from the way they looked I saw that
they were talking about me. I remembered that she’d been quite
near me on the <em>Lusitania</em> when Mr. Danvers gave me the
packet, and before that she’d tried to talk to him once or twice.
I began to get scared, but I didn’t quite see what to do.</p>

<p>"I had a wild idea of stopping at Holyhead, and not going on
to London that day, but I soon saw that that would be plumb foolishness.
The only thing was to act as though I’d noticed nothing, and hope
for the best. I couldn’t see how they could get me if I was on
my guard. One thing I’d done already as a precaution&mdash;ripped open
the oilskin packet and substituted blank paper, and then sewn
it up again. So, if anyone did manage to rob me of it, it wouldn’t
matter.</p>

<p>"What to do with the real thing worried me no end. Finally I
opened it out flat&mdash;there were only two sheets&mdash;and laid it between
two of the advertisement pages of a magazine. I stuck the two
pages together round the edge with some gum off an envelope. I
carried the magazine carelessly stuffed into the pocket of my
ulster.</p>

<p>"At Holyhead I tried to get into a carriage with people that
looked all right, but in a queer way there seemed always to be
a crowd round me shoving and pushing me just the way I didn’t
want to go. There was something uncanny and frightening about
it. In the end I found myself in a carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer
after all. I went out into the corridor, but all the other carriages
were full, so I had to go back and sit down. I consoled myself
with the thought that there were other people in the carriage&mdash;there
was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting just opposite.
So I felt almost happy about it until just outside London. I had
leaned back and closed my eyes. I guess they thought I was asleep,
but my eyes weren’t quite shut, and suddenly I saw the nice-looking
man get something out of his bag and hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer,
and as he did so he <em>winked</em>....</p>

<p>"I can’t tell you how that wink sort of froze me through and
through. My only thought was to get out in the corridor as quick
as ever I could. I got up, trying to look natural and easy. Perhaps
they saw something &mdash;I don’t know&mdash;but suddenly Mrs. Vandemeyer
said ‘Now,’ and flung something over my nose and mouth as I tried
to scream. At the same moment I felt a terrific blow on the back
of my head...."</p>

<p>She shuddered. Sir James murmured something sympathetically.
In a minute she resumed:</p>

<p>"I don’t know how long it was before I came back to consciousness.
I felt very ill and sick. I was lying on a dirty bed. There was
a screen round it, but I could hear two people talking in the
room. Mrs. Vandemeyer was one of them. I tried to listen, but
at first I couldn’t take much in. When at last I did begin to
grasp what was going on &mdash;I was just terrified! I wonder
I didn’t scream right out there and then.</p>

<p>"They hadn’t found the papers. They’d got the oilskin packet
with the blanks, and they were just mad! They didn’t know whether
<em>I</em>‘d changed the papers, or whether Danvers had been carrying
a dummy message, while the real one was sent another way. They
spoke of"&mdash;she closed her eyes&mdash;"torturing me to find out!</p>

<p>"I’d never known what fear&mdash;really sickening fear&mdash;was before!
Once they came to look at me. I shut my eyes and pretended to
be still unconscious, but I was afraid they’d hear the beating
of my heart. However, they went away again. I began thinking madly.
What could I do? I knew I wouldn’t be able to stand up against
torture very long.</p>

<p>"Suddenly something put the thought of loss of memory into my
head. The subject had always interested me, and I’d read an awful
lot about it. I had the whole thing at my finger-tips. If only
I could succeed in carrying the bluff through, it might save me.
I said a prayer, and drew a long breath. Then I opened my eyes
and started babbling in <em>French!</em></p>

<p>"Mrs. Vandemeyer came round the screen at once. Her face was
so wicked I nearly died, but I smiled up at her doubtfully, and
asked her in French where I was.</p>

<p>"It puzzled her, I could see. She called the man she had been
talking to. He stood by the screen with his face in shadow. He
spoke to me in French. His voice was very ordinary and quiet,
but somehow, I don’t know why, he scared me worse than the woman.
I felt he’d seen right through me, but I went on playing my part.
I asked again where I was, and then went on that there was something
I <em>must</em> remember&mdash;<em>must</em> remember&mdash;only for the
moment it was all gone. I worked myself up to be more and more
distressed. He asked me my name. I said I didn’t know&mdash;that I
couldn’t remember anything at all.</p>

<p>"Suddenly he caught my wrist, and began twisting it. The pain
was awful. I screamed. He went on. I screamed and screamed, but
I managed to shriek out things in French. I don’t know how long
I could have gone on, but luckily I fainted. The last thing I
heard was his voice saying: ‘That’s not bluff! Anyway, a kid of
her age wouldn’t know enough.’ I guess he forgot American girls
are older for their age than English ones, and take more interest
in scientific subjects.</p>

<p>"When I came to, Mrs. Vandemeyer was sweet as honey to me. She’d
had her orders, I guess. She spoke to me in French&mdash;told me I’d
had a shock and been very ill. I should be better soon. I pretended
to be rather dazed&mdash;murmured something about the ‘doctor’ having
hurt my wrist. She looked relieved when I said that.</p>

<p>"By and by she went out of the room altogether. I was suspicious
still, and lay quite quiet for some time. In the end, however,
I got up and walked round the room, examining it. I thought that
even if anyone <em>was</em> watching me from somewhere, it would
seem natural enough under the circumstances. It was a squalid,
dirty place. There were no windows, which seemed queer. I guessed
the door would be locked, but I didn’t try it. There were some
battered old pictures on the walls, representing scenes from <em>Faust</em>."</p>

<p>Jane’s two listeners gave a simultaneous "Ah!" The girl nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it was the place in Soho where Mr. Beresford was imprisoned.
Of course, at the time I didn’t even know if I was in London.
One thing was worrying me dreadfully, but my heart gave a great
throb of relief when I saw my ulster lying carelessly over the
back of a chair. <em>And the magazine was still rolled up in the
pocket!</em></p>

<p>"If only I could be certain that I was not being overlooked!
I looked carefully round the walls. There didn’t seem to be a
peep-hole of any kind&mdash;nevertheless I felt kind of sure there
must be. All of a sudden I sat down on the edge of the table,
and put my face in my hands, sobbing out a ‘Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!’
I’ve got very sharp ears. I distinctly heard the rustle of a dress,
and slight creak. That was enough for me. I was being watched!</p>

<p>"I lay down on the bed again, and by and by Mrs. Vandemeyer brought
me some supper. She was still sweet as they make them. I guess
she’d been told to win my confidence. Presently she produced the
oilskin packet, and asked me if I recognized it, watching me like
a lynx all the time.</p>

<p>"I took it and turned it over in a puzzled sort of way. Then
I shook my head. I said that I felt I <em>ought</em> to remember
something about it, that it was just as though it was all coming
back, and then, before I could get hold of it, it went again.
Then she told me that I was her niece, and that I was to call
her ‘Aunt Rita.’ I did obediently, and she told me not to worry&mdash;my
memory would soon come back.</p>

<p>"That was an awful night. I’d made my plan whilst I was waiting
for her. The papers were safe so far, but I couldn’t take the
risk of leaving them there any longer. They might throw that magazine
away any minute. I lay awake waiting until I judged it must be
about two o’clock in the morning. Then I got up as softly as I
could, and felt in the dark along the left-hand wall. Very gently,
I unhooked one of the pictures from its nail &mdash;Marguerite
with her casket of jewels. I crept over to my coat and took out
the magazine, and an odd envelope or two that I had shoved in.
Then I went to the washstand, and damped the brown paper at the
back of the picture all round. Presently I was able to pull it
away. I had already torn out the two stuck-together pages from
the magazine, and now I slipped them with their precious enclosure
between the picture and its brown paper backing. A little gum
from the envelopes helped me to stick the latter up again. No
one would dream the picture had ever been tampered with. I rehung
it on the wall, put the magazine back in my coat pocket, and crept
back to bed. I was pleased with my hiding-place. They’d never
think of pulling to pieces one of their own pictures. I hoped
that they’d come to the conclusion that Danvers had been carrying
a dummy all along, and that, in the end, they’d let me go.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I guess that’s what they did think at first,
and, in a way, it was dangerous for me. I learnt afterwards that
they nearly did away with me then and there&mdash;there was never much
chance of their ‘letting me go’&mdash;but the first man, who was the
boss, preferred to keep me alive on the chance of my having hidden
them, and being able to tell where if I recovered my memory. They
watched me constantly for weeks. Sometimes they’d ask me questions
by the hour &mdash;I guess there was nothing they didn’t know
about the third degree!&mdash;but somehow I managed to hold my own.
The strain of it was awful, though....</p>

<p>"They took me back to Ireland, and over every step of the journey
again, in case I’d hidden it somewhere <em>en route</em>. Mrs.
Vandemeyer and another woman never left me for a moment. They
spoke of me as a young relative of Mrs. Vandemeyer’s whose mind
was affected by the shock of the <em>Lusitania</em>. There was
no one I could appeal to for help without giving myself away to
<em>them</em>, and if I risked it and failed&mdash;and Mrs. Vandemeyer
looked so rich, and so beautifully dressed, that I felt convinced
they’d take her word against mine, and think it was part of my
mental trouble to think myself ‘persecuted’ &mdash;I felt that
the horrors in store for me would be too awful once they knew
I’d been only shamming."</p>

<p>Sir James nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vandemeyer was a woman of great personality. With that
and her social position she would have had little difficulty in
imposing her point of view in preference to yours. Your sensational
accusations against her would not easily have found credence."</p>

<p>"That’s what I thought. It ended in my being sent to a sanatorium
at Bournemouth. I couldn’t make up my mind at first whether it
was a sham affair or genuine. A hospital nurse had charge of me.
I was a special patient. She seemed so nice and normal that at
last I determined to confide in her. A merciful providence just
saved me in time from falling into the trap. My door happened
to be ajar, and I heard her talking to some one in the passage.
<em>She was one of them!</em> They still fancied it might be a
bluff on my part, and she was put in charge of me to make sure!
After that, my nerve went completely. I dared trust nobody.</p>

<p>"I think I almost hypnotized myself. After a while, I almost
forgot that I was really Jane Finn. I was so bent on playing the
part of Janet Vandemeyer that my nerves began to play me tricks.
I became really ill&mdash;for months I sank into a sort of stupor.
I felt sure I should die soon, and that nothing really mattered.
A sane person shut up in a lunatic asylum often ends by becoming
insane, they say. I guess I was like that. Playing my part had
become second nature to me. I wasn’t even unhappy in the end&mdash;just
apathetic. Nothing seemed to matter. And the years went on.</p>

<p>"And then suddenly things seemed to change. Mrs. Vandemeyer came
down from London. She and the doctor asked me questions, experimented
with various treatments. There was some talk of sending me to
a specialist in Paris. In the end, they did not dare risk it.
I overheard something that seemed to show that other people&mdash;friends&mdash;were
looking for me. I learnt later that the nurse who had looked after
me went to Paris, and consulted a specialist, representing herself
to be me. He put her through some searching tests, and exposed
her loss of memory to be fraudulent; but she had taken a note
of his methods and reproduced them on me. I dare say I couldn’t
have deceived the specialist for a minute&mdash;a man who has made
a lifelong study of a thing is unique&mdash;but I managed once again
to hold my own with them. The fact that I’d not thought of myself
as Jane Finn for so long made it easier.</p>

<p>"One night I was whisked off to London at a moment’s notice.
They took me back to the house in Soho. Once I got away from the
sanatorium I felt different&mdash;as though something in me that had
been buried for a long time was waking up again.</p>

<p>"They sent me in to wait on Mr. Beresford. (Of course I didn’t
know his name then.) I was suspicious &mdash;I thought it was
another trap. But he looked so honest, I could hardly believe
it. However, I was careful in all I said, for I knew we could
be overheard. There’s a small hole, high up in the wall.</p>

<p>"But on the Sunday afternoon a message was brought to the house.
They were all very disturbed. Without their knowing, I listened.
Word had come that he was to be killed. I needn’t tell the next
part, because you know it. I thought I’d have time to rush up
and get the papers from their hiding-place, but I was caught.
So I screamed out that he was escaping, and I said I wanted to
go back to Marguerite. I shouted the name three times very loud.
I knew the others would think I meant Mrs. Vandemeyer, but I hoped
it might make Mr. Beresford think of the picture. He’d unhooked
one the first day&mdash;that’s what made me hesitate to trust him."</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>"Then the papers," said Sir James slowly, "are still at the back
of the picture in that room."</p>

<p>"Yes." The girl had sunk back on the sofa exhausted with the
strain of the long story.</p>

<p>Sir James rose to his feet. He looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "we must go at once."</p>

<p>"To-night?" queried Tuppence, surprised.</p>

<p>"To-morrow may be too late," said Sir James gravely. "Besides,
by going to-night we have the chance of capturing that great man
and super-criminal &mdash;Mr. Brown!"</p>

<p>There was dead silence, and Sir James continued:</p>

<p>"You have been followed here&mdash;not a doubt of it. When we leave
the house we shall be followed again, but not molested, <em>for
it is Mr. Brown’s plan that we are to lead him</em>. But the Soho
house is under police supervision night and day. There are several
men watching it. When we enter that house, Mr. Brown will not
draw back&mdash;he will risk all, on the chance of obtaining the spark
to fire his mine. And he fancies the risk not great&mdash;since he
will enter in the guise of a friend!"</p>

<p>Tuppence flushed, then opened her mouth impulsively.</p>

<p>"But there’s something you don’t know&mdash;that we haven’t told you."
Her eyes dwelt on Jane in perplexity.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked the other sharply. "No hesitations, Miss
Tuppence. We need to be sure of our going."</p>

<p>But Tuppence, for once, seemed tongue-tied.</p>

<p>"It’s so difficult&mdash;you see, if I’m wrong&mdash;oh, it would be dreadful." 
She made a grimace at the unconscious Jane. "Never forgive me,"
she observed cryptically.</p>

<p>"You want me to help you out, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, please. <em>You</em> know who Mr. Brown is, don’t you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sir James gravely. "At last I do."</p>

<p>"At last?" queried Tuppence doubtfully. "Oh, but I thought&#11834;"
She paused.</p>

<p>"You thought correctly, Miss Tuppence. I have been morally certain
of his identity for some time&mdash;ever since the night of Mrs. Vandemeyer’s
mysterious death."</p>

<p>"Ah!" breathed Tuppence.</p>

<p>"For there we are up against the logic of facts. There are only
two solutions. Either the chloral was administered by her own
hand, which theory I reject utterly, or else&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Or else it was administered in the brandy you gave her. Only
three people touched that brandy&mdash;you, Miss Tuppence, I myself,
and one other &mdash;Mr. Julius Hersheimmer!"</p>

<p>Jane Finn stirred and sat up, regarding the speaker with wide
astonished eyes.</p>

<p>"At first, the thing seemed utterly impossible. Mr. Hersheimmer,
as the son of a prominent millionaire, was a well-known figure
in America. It seemed utterly impossible that he and Mr. Brown
could be one and the same. But you cannot escape from the logic
of facts. Since the thing was so&mdash;it must be accepted. Remember
Mrs. Vandemeyer’s sudden and inexplicable agitation. Another proof,
if proof was needed.</p>

<p>"I took an early opportunity of giving you a hint. From some
words of Mr. Hersheimmer’s at Manchester, I gathered that you
had understood and acted on that hint. Then I set to work to prove
the impossible possible. Mr. Beresford rang me up and told me,
what I had already suspected, that the photograph of Miss Jane
Finn had never really been out of Mr. Hersheimmer’s possession&#11834;"</p>

<p>But the girl interrupted. Springing to her feet, she cried out
angrily:</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What are you trying to suggest? That Mr. Brown
is <em>Julius?</em> Julius&mdash;my own cousin!"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Finn," said Sir James unexpectedly. "Not your cousin.
The man who calls himself Julius Hersheimmer is no relation to
you whatsoever."</p>
