<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Seated in a low-framed rattan chair on the broad veranda of his cottage,
Mynheer Hendrik Muller, <u>controlleur</u>, and acting resident of Bulungan,
awaited in perspiring impatience the appearance of his military
associate, Captain Gerrit Van Slyck.
</p><p>State regulations required daily conferences, that the civil arm of the
government might lay its commands upon the military and the military
make its requisitions upon the civil. An additional incentive to prompt
attendance upon these was that <u>mynheer</u> the resident rarely failed to
produce a bottle of Hollands, which, compounded with certain odorous and
acidulated products of the tropics, made a drink that cooled the fevered
brow and mellowed the human heart, made a hundred and twenty in the
shade seem like seventy, and chased away the home-sickness of folk
pining for the damp and fog of their native Amsterdam.
</p><p>It was no urgent affair of state, however, that made Muller fume and
fuss like a washerwoman on a rainy Monday at Van Slyck's dilatoriness. A
bit of gossip, casually dropped by the master of a trading schooner who
had called for clearance papers an hour before, was responsible for his
agitation.
</p><p>"When does your new resident arrive?" the visiting skipper had asked.
</p><p>"The new resident?" Muller returned blankly. "What new resident?"
</p><p>The skipper perceived that he was the bearer of unpleasant tidings and
diplomatically minimized the importance of his news.
</p><p>"Somebody down to Batavia told me you were going to have a new resident
here," he replied lightly. "It's only talk, I s'pose. You hear so many
yarns in port."
</p><p>"There is nothing official--yet," Muller declared. He had the air of one
who could tell much if he chose. But when the sailor had gone back to
his ship he hurriedly sent Cho Seng to the stockade with an urgent
request to Van Slyck to come to his house at once.
</p><p>Van Slyck was putting the finishing touches to an exquisite toilet when
he received the message.
</p><p>"What ails the doddering old fool now?" he growled irritably as he read
Muller's appeal. "Another Malay run amuck, I suppose. Every time a few
of these <u>bruinevels</u> (brown-skins) get krissed he thinks the whole
province is going to flame into revolt."
</p><p>Tossing the note into an urn, he leisurely resumed his dressing. It was
not until he was carefully barbered, his hair shampooed and perfumed,
his nails manicured, and his mustache waxed and twisted to the exact
angle that a two-months old French magazine of fashion dictated as the
mode, that the dapper captain left the stockade. He was quite certain
that the last living representative of the ancient house of Van Slyck of
Amsterdam would never be seen in public in dirty linen and unwashed,
regardless how far <u>mynheer the controlleur</u> might forget his
self-respect and the dignity of his office.
</p><p>Van Slyck was leisurely strolling along the tree-lined lane that led
from the iron-wood stockade to the cluster of houses colloquially
designated "Amsterdam" when the impatient Muller perceived his approach.
</p><p>"Devil take the man, why doesn't he hurry?" the <u>controlleur</u> swore.
With a peremptory gesture he signaled Van Slyck to make haste.
</p><p>"By the beard of Nassau," the captain exclaimed. "Does that swine think
he can make a Van Slyck skip like a butcher's boy? Things have come to a
pretty pass in the colonies when a Celebes half-breed imagines he can
make the best blood of Amsterdam fetch and carry for him."
</p><p>Deliberately turning his back on the <u>controlleur</u>, he affected to
admire the surpassingly beautiful bay of Bulungan, heaven's own blue
melting into green on the shingly shore, with a thousand sabres of
iridescent foam stabbing the morning horizon. Muller was fuming when the
commandant finally sauntered on the veranda, selected a fat, black cigar
from the humidor, and gracefully lounged in an easy chair.
</p><p>"<u>Donder en bliksem! kapitein</u>, but you lie abed later every morning,"
he growled.
</p><p>Van Slyck's thin lips curled with aristocratic scorn.
</p><p>"We cannot all be such conscientious public servants as you, <u>mynheer</u>,"
he observed ironically.
</p><p>Muller was in that state of nervous agitation that a single jarring word
would have roused an unrestricted torrent of abuse. Fortunately for Van
Slyck, however, he was obtuse to irony. He took the remark literally and
for the moment, like oil on troubled waters, it calmed the rising tide
of his wrath at what he deemed the governor-general's black ingratitude.
</p><p>"Well, <u>kapitein, gij kebt gelijk</u> (you are right, captain)" he assented
heavily. The blubbery folds under his chin crimsoned with his cheeks in
complacent self-esteem. "There are not many men who would have done so
well as I have under the conditions I had to face--under the conditions
I had to face--<u>kapitein</u>. _Ja!_ Not many men. I have worked and slaved
to build up this residency. For two years now I have done a double
duty--I have been both resident and <u>controlleur</u>. _Jawel!_"
</p><p>Recollection of the skipper's unpleasant news recurred to him. His face
darkened like a tropic sky before a cloudburst.
</p><p>"And what is my reward, <u>kapitein</u>? What is my reward? To have some
<u>Amsterdamsche papegaai</u> (parrot) put over me." His fist came down
wrathily on the arm of his chair. "Ten thousand devils! It is enough to
make a man turn pirate."
</p><p>Van Slyck's cynical face lit with a sudden interest.
</p><p>"You have heard from Ah Sing?" he inquired.
</p><p>"Ah Sing? No. _Drommel noch toe!_" Muller swore. "Who mentioned Ah Sing?
That thieving Deutscher who runs the schooner we had in port over-night
told me this not an hour ago. The whole of Batavia knows it. They are
talking it in every <u>rumah makan</u>. And we sit here and know nothing.
That is the kind of friends we have in Batavia."
</p><p>Van Slyck, apprehensive that the impending change might affect him,
speculated swiftly how much the <u>controlleur</u> knew.
</p><p>"It is strange that Ah Sing hasn't let us know," he remarked.
</p><p>"Ah Sing?" Muller growled. "Ah Sing? That bloodsucker is all for
himself. He would sell us out to Van Schouten in a minute if he thought
he saw any profit in it. _Ja!_ I have even put money into his ventures,
and this is how he treats me."
</p><p>"Damnably, I must say," Van Slyck agreed sympathetically. "That is, if
he knows."
</p><p>"If he knows, <u>mynheer kapitein</u>? Of course he knows. Has he not
<u>agenten</u> in every corner of this archipelago? Has he not a spy in the
<u>paleis</u> itself?"
</p><p>"He should have sent us word," Van Slyck agreed. "Unless <u>mynheer</u>, the
new resident, is one of us. Who did you say it is, <u>mynheer</u>?"
</p><p>"How the devil should I know?" Muller growled irritably. "All I know is
what I told you--that the whole of Batavia says Bulungan is to have a
new resident."
</p><p>Van Slyck's face fell. He had hoped that the <u>controlleur</u> knew at least
the identity of the new executive of the province. Having extracted all
the information Muller had, he dropped the cloak of sympathy and
remarked with cool insolence:
</p><p>"Since you don't know, I think you had better make it your business to
find out, <u>mynheer</u>."
</p><p>Muller looked at him doubtfully. "You might make an effort also,
<u>kapitein</u>," he suggested. "You have friends in Batavia. It is your
concern as well as mine, a new resident would ruin our business."
</p><p>"I don't think he will," Van Slyck replied coolly. "If he isn't one of
us he won't bother us long. Ah Sing won't let any prying reformer
interfere with business while the profits are coming in as well as they
are."
</p><p>A shadow of anxiety crossed Muller's face. He cast a troubled look at
Van Slyck, who affected to admire the multi-tinted color display of
jungle, sun, and sea.
</p><p>"What--what do you mean, <u>kapitein</u>?" he asked hesitantly.
</p><p>"People sometimes begin voyages they do not finish," Van Slyck observed.
"A man might eat a pomegranate that didn't agree with him--pouf--the
colic, and it is all over. There is nothing so uncertain as life,
<u>mynheer</u>."
</p><p>The captain replaced his cigar between his teeth with a flourish.
Muller's pudgy hands caught each other convulsively. The folds under his
chin flutterred. He licked his lips before he spoke.
</p><p>"<u>Kapitein</u>--you mean he might come to an unhappy end on the way?" he
faltered.
</p><p>"Why not?" Van Slyck concentrated his attention on his cigar.
</p><p>"<u>Neen, neen</u>, let us have no bloodshed," Muller vetoed anxiously. "We
have had enough--" He looked around nervously as though he feared
someone might be overhearing him. "Let him alone. We shall find some way
to get rid of him. But let there be no killing."
</p><p>Van Slyck turned his attention from the landscape to the <u>controlleur</u>.
There was a look in the captain's face that made Muller wince and shift
his eyes, a look of cyincal contempt, calm, frank, and unconcealed. It
was the mask lifting, for Van Slyck despised his associate. Bold and
unscrupulous, sticking at nothing that might achieve his end, he had no
patience with the timid, faltering, often conscience-stricken
<u>controlleur</u>.
</p><p>"Well, <u>mynheer</u>," Van Slyck observed at length, "you are getting
remarkably thin-skinned all of a sudden."
</p><p>He laughed sardonically. Muller winced and replied hastily:
</p><p>"I have been thinking, <u>kapitein</u>, that the proa crews have been doing
too much killing lately. I am going to tell Ah Sing that it must be
stopped. There are other ways--we can unload the ships and land their
crews on some island--"
</p><p>"To starve, or to be left to the tender mercies of the Bajaus and the
Bugis," Van Slyck sneered. "That would be more tender-hearted. You would
at least transfer the responsibility."
</p><p>Muller's agitation became more pronounced.
</p><p>"But we must not let it go on, <u>kapitein</u>," he urged. "It hurts the
business. Pretty soon we will have an investigation, one of these
gun-boats will pick up one of our proas, somebody will tell, and what
will happen to us then?"
</p><p>"We'll be hung," Van Slyck declared succinctly.
</p><p>Muller's fingers leaped in an involuntary frantic gesture to his throat,
as though he felt cords tightening around his windpipe. His face paled.
</p><p>"<u>Lieve hemel, kapitein</u>, don't speak of such things," he gasped.
</p><p>"Then don't talk drivel," Van Slyck snarled. "You can't make big profits
without taking big chances. And you can't have piracy without a little
blood-letting. We're in this now, and there's no going back. So stop
your squealing."
</p><p>Settling back into his chair, he looked calmly seaward and exhaled huge
clouds of tobacco smoke. The frown deepened on Muller's troubled brow as
he stared vacantly across the crushed coral-shell highway.
</p><p>"You can think of no reason why his excellency should be offended with
us, <u>kapitein</u>?" he ventured anxiously.
</p><p>The <u>controlleur's</u> eagerness to include him in his misfortune,
evidenced by the use of the plural pronoun, evoked a sardonic flicker in
Van Slyck's cold, gray eyes.
</p><p>"No, <u>mynheer</u>, I cannot conceive why the governor should want to get
rid of so valuable a public servant as you are," he assured ironically.
"You have certainly done your best. There have been a few disturbances,
of course, some head-hunting, and the taxes have not been paid, but
outside of such minor matters everything has done well, very well
indeed."
</p><p>"<u>Donder en bliksem</u>," Muller exclaimed, "how can I raise taxes when
those Midianites, the hill Dyaks, will not let my coast Dyaks grow a
spear of rice? Has there been a month without a raid? Answer me,
<u>kapitein</u>. Have you spent a whole month in the stockade without being
called to beat back some of these thieving plunderers and drive them
into their hills?"
</p><p>The sardonic smile flashed across Van Slyck's face again.
</p><p>"Quite true, <u>mynheer</u>. But sometimes I don't know if I blame the poor
devils. They tell me they're only trying to get even because your coast
Dyaks and Ah Sing's crowd rob them so. Ah Sing must be making quite a
profit out of the slave business. I'll bet he shipped two hundred to
China last year."
</p><p>He glanced quizzically at his associate.
</p><p>"By the way, <u>mynheer</u>," he observed, "you ought to know something about
that. I understand you get a per cent on it."
</p><p>"I?" Muller exclaimed, and looked affrightedly about him. "I,
<u>kapitein</u>?"
</p><p>"Oh, yes you do," Van Slyck asserted airily. "You've got money invested
with Ah Sing in two proas that are handling that end of the business.
And it's the big end just now. The merchandise pickings are small, and
that is all I share in."
</p><p>He looked at Muller meaningly. There was menace in his eyes and menace
in his voice as he announced:
</p><p>"I'm only mentioning this, <u>mynheer</u>, so that if the new resident should
happen to be one of us, with a claim to the booty, his share comes out
of your pot, not mine. Remember that!"
</p><p>For once cupidity overcame Muller's fear of the sharp-witted cynical
soldier.
</p><p>"<u>Wat de drommel</u>," he roared, "do you expect me to pay all, <u>kapitein</u>,
all? Not in a thousand years! If there must be a division you shall give
up your per cent as well as I, <u>stuiver</u> for <u>stuiver</u>, <u>gulden</u> for
<u>gulden</u>!"
</p><p>A hectic spot glowed in each of Van Slyck's cheeks, and his eyes
glittered. Muller's anger rose.
</p><p>"Ah Sing shall decide between us," he cried heatedly. "You cannot rob me
in that way, <u>kapitein</u>."
</p><p>Van Slyck turned on his associate with an oath. "Ah Sing be damned.
We'll divide as I say, or--"
</p><p>The pause was more significant than words. Muller's ruddy face paled.
Van Slyck tapped a forefinger significantly on the arm of his chair.
</p><p>"Just remember, if the worst comes to the worst, there's this one
difference between you and me, <u>mynheer</u>. I'm not afraid to die, and
you--are!" He smiled.
</p><p>Muller's breath came thickly, and he stared fascinatedly into the
evilly handsome face of the captain, whose eyes were fixed on his with a
basilisk glare. Several seconds passed; then Van Slyck said:
</p><p>"See that you remember these things, <u>mynheer</u>, when our next accounting
comes."
</p><p>The silence that followed was broken by the rhythmic pad-pad of wicker
sandals on a bamboo floor. Cho Seng came on the veranda, bearing a tray
laden with two glasses of finest crystal and a decanter of colorless
liquid, both of which he placed on a small porch table. Drops of dew
formed thickly on the chilled surface of the decanter and rolled off
while the Chinaman mixed the juices of fruits and crushed leaves with
the potent liquor. The unknown discoverer of the priceless recipe he
used receives more blessings in the Indies daily than all the saints on
the calendar. When Cho Seng had finished, he withdrew. Muller swallowed
the contents of his glass in a single gulp. Van Slyck sipped leisurely.
Gradually the tension lessened. After a while, between sips, the captain
remarked:
</p><p>"I hear you have a chance to pick up some prize money."
</p><p>Muller looked up with interest. "So, <u>kapitein</u>!" he exclaimed with
forced jocularity. "Have you found a place where guilders grow on
trees?"
</p><p>"Almost as good as that," Van Slyck replied, playing his fish.
</p><p>Finesse and indirection were not Muller's forte. "Well, tell us about
it, <u>kapitein</u>," he demanded bluntly.
</p><p>Van Slyck's eyes twinkled.
</p><p>"Catch Koyala," he replied.
</p><p>The captain's meaning sank into Muller's mind slowly. But as
comprehension began to dawn upon him, his face darkened. The veins
showed purple under the ruddy skin.
</p><p>"You are too clever this morning, <u>kapitein</u>," he snarled. "Let me
remind you that this is your duty. The <u>controlleur</u> sits as judge, he
does not hunt the accused."
</p><p>Van Slyck laughed.
</p><p>"And let me remind you, <u>mynheer</u>, that I haven't received the
governor's orders as yet, although they reached you more than a week
ago." Ironically he added: "You must not let your friendship with Koyala
blind you to your public duties, <u>mynheer</u>."
</p><p>Muller's face became darker still. He had not told any one, and the fact
that the orders seemed to be public property both alarmed and angered
him.
</p><p>"How did you hear of it?" he demanded.
</p><p>"Not from you, <u>mynheer</u>," Van Slyck mocked. "I really do not remember
who told me." (As a matter of fact it was Wang Fu, the Chinese
merchant.)
</p><p>Muller reflected that officers from the gun-boat which carried Van
Schouten's mandate might have told more than they should have at the
stockade. But Koyala had received his warning a full week before, so she
must be safely hidden in the jungle by now, he reasoned. Pulling himself
together, he replied urbanely:
</p><p>"Well, <u>kapitein</u>, it is true that I have rather neglected that matter.
I intended to speak to you to-day. His excellency orders Koyala Bintang
Burung's arrest."
</p><p>"The argus pheasant," Van Slyck observed, "is rarely shot. It must be
trapped."
</p><p>"<u>Nu, kapitein</u>, that is a chance for you to distinguish yourself,"
Muller replied heartily, confident that Van Slyck could never land
Koyala.
</p><p>Van Slyck flecked the ash from his cigar and looked at the glowing coal
thoughtfully.
</p><p>"It seems to me that you might be of material assistance, <u>mynheer</u>," he
observed.
</p><p>"In what way?"
</p><p>"I have noticed that the witch-woman is not--er--" He glanced at Muller
quizzically, wondering how far he might venture to go--"not altogether
indifferent to you."
</p><p>Muller drew a deep breath. His ruddy face became a grayish purple. His
clenched hands gripped each other until the bones crunched and the veins
stood in ridges. Drops of perspiration gathered on his forehead, he
wiped them away mechanically.
</p><p>"_Kapitein!_" he gasped.
</p><p>Van Slyck looked at him increduously, for he had not dreamed Muller's
feelings ran so deeply.
</p><p>"You think--she--sometimes thinks of me?"
</p><p>Van Slyck's nimble wits were calculating the value to him of this new
weakness of the <u>controlleur</u>. He foresaw infinite possibilities,
Muller in love would be clay in his hands.
</p><p>"I am positive, <u>mynheer</u>," he assured with the utmost gravity.
</p><p>"<u>Kapitein</u>, do not make a mistake," Muller entreated. His voice
trembled and broke. "Are you absolutely sure?"
</p><p>Van Slyck restrained a guffaw with difficulty. It was so
ridiculous--this mountain of flesh, this sweaty, panting porpoise in his
unwashed linen in love with the slender, graceful Koyala. He choked and
coughed discreetly.
</p><p>"I am certain, <u>mynheer</u>," he assured.
</p><p>"Tell me, <u>kapitein</u>, what makes you think so?" Muller begged.
</p><p>Van Slyck forced himself to calmness and a judicial attitude.
</p><p>"You know I have seen something of women, <u>mynheer</u>," he replied
gravely. "Both women here and in the best houses in Amsterdam, Paris,
and London. Believe me, they are all the same--a fine figure of a man
attracts them."
</p><p>He ran his eye over Muller's form in assumed admiration.
</p><p>"You have a figure any woman might admire, <u>mynheer</u>. I have seen
Koyala's eyes rest on you, and I know what she was thinking. You have
but to speak and she is yours."
</p><p>"Say you so, <u>kapitein</u>!" Muller cried ecstatically.
</p><p>"Absolutely," Van Slyck assured. His eyes narrowed. The devilish humor
incarnate in him could not resist the temptation to harrow this tortured
soul. Watching Muller closely, he inquired:
</p><p>"Then I can expect you to spread the net, <u>mynheer</u>?"
</p><p>The light died in Muller's eyes. A slow, volcanic fury succeeded it. He
breathed deeply and exhaled the breath in an explosive gasp. His hands
clenched and the veins in his forehead became almost black. Van Slyck
and he leaped to their feet simultaneously.
</p><p>"Kapitein Van Slyck," he cried hoarsely, "you are a scoundrel! You would
sell your own mother. Get out of my sight, or God help you, I will break
you in two."
</p><p>The door of the <u>controlleur's</u> dwelling opened. Muller leaped back, and
Van Slyck's hand leaped to his holster.
</p><p>"I am here, Kapitein Van Slyck," a clear, silvery voice announced
coolly.
</p><p>Koyala stood in the doorway.
