<p>A Hero of the Olden Days&mdash;Cruise of the <em>Constitution</em>
&mdash;Her Capture of the <em>Cyane</em> and <em>Levant</em>&mdash;Reminiscences
of Admiral Stewart &mdash;His Last Days.</p>

<p>During the early days of President Lincoln's administration,
before the firing upon Fort Sumter by the Confederates, the all-absorbing
question was as to whether or not the fort should be reinforced
by the Government. A good many opposed, because it was known that
the attempt would bring on a conflict, and, if war was to come,
each was anxious that the other side should strike the first blow.</p>

<p>It was amid those times of excitement, doubt and trouble that
Commodore Charles Stewart left his modest home near Bordentown,
<em>N.J., </em>and went by train to Washington. From the station
he made his way straight to the White House and sent in his name
to President Lincoln. As usual, the Executive had a swarm of visitors,
but he directed the distinguished caller to be admitted at once.
As the tall, sad-faced man rose from his chair he towered fully
two feet above the diminutive form of the naval officer in his
blue swallow-tail, who took the proffered hand, and, after a few
conventional words, looked up and said in his brisk manner:</p>

<p>"Mr. President, I'll reinforce Fort Sumter."</p>

<p>"You, Commodore! We are just discussing the question."</p>

<p>"There's no need of discussing it; it must be done! Give me the
men and ships&mdash;there won't be many required&mdash;and I'll do it."</p>

<p>The President saw that his caller was in earnest, and he respected
him too highly to indulge in anything like jesting.</p>

<p>"I am inclined to think as you do, Commodore, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But <em>what</em>?" impatiently interrupted the veteran.</p>

<p>"You have already done so much for your country that it seems
only fair that we should give the younger men a chance."</p>

<p>"Younger men! What's the matter with me? I'm not old enough yet
to need a cane."</p>

<p>"I observe that; you are wonderfully spry for one of your years.
Let me see, what <em>is</em> your age?"</p>

<p>"Not quite eighty-four."</p>

<p>"Why, you are still a young man; but the trouble is, Commodore,
we have so many that are still younger, that they are plaguing
the life out of me; I don't see how I can refuse them, but I shall
be grateful to have the benefit of your counsel any time you are
willing to give it."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE BOMBARDMENT OF FORT SUMTER</em>.]</p>

<p>"Counsel be hanged! We have had too much <em>talk</em>; it's
time for actions, and I demand that you give me a chance with
the rest."</p>

<p>With that inimitable tact for which President Lincoln was noted,
he succeeded in soothing the ruffled feelings of the Commodore
(soon afterward made an admiral), but the old gentleman was not
quite satisfied, when he bade the President good-by, without having
obtained the opportunity to re-enter the active service of his
country.</p>

<p>This little anecdote, which is authentic, may serve to introduce
my last references to one of the most remarkable naval heroes
of our country. If his fire, vigor and patriotism burned so brightly
in 1861, little need be said in way of explanation of its nature
when he was less than forty years of age.</p>

<p>Captain Stewart came back from a cruise in the West Indies in
the spring of 1814, and found the <em>Constitution</em>, "Old
Ironsides," closely blockaded by a powerful British squadron.
That remarkable frigate had already won such a reputation that
the enemy were determined she should not get to sea again. They
held her locked in the port for months, but despite their unceasing
vigilance, Captain Stewart, who was a consummate seaman, slipped
out in December and sailed away.</p>

<p>He made several captures, and the frigates of the enemy began
an industrious search for him, while all the lesser craft strained
every nerve to keep out of his way. On the 20th of February, 1815,
when off the coast of South America, he gave chase to two of the
enemy's vessels, one of which proved to be the <em>Cyane</em>
and the other the <em>Levant</em>. The two together carried 55
guns and 313 men, while the <em>Constitution</em> had 51 guns
and a crew of 456 men. The <em>Cyane</em> was properly a frigate,
and she being at the rear, Stewart opened fire from the long guns
of his port battery. The response from the starboard guns of the
enemy was prompt, and for a time the cannonade was deafening.
The <em>Constitution</em> gave most of her attention to the rear
ship. The smoke around the American becoming so dense as to cloud
the vision, Stewart slipped forward and quickly delivered a double-shotted
broadside. Before it could be repeated the other ship attempted
to gain a raking position across the stern of the <em>Constitution</em>.
By a splendid manoeuvre, Stewart defeated the purpose, and, placing
himself abreast the rear ship, delivered another destructive broadside
before the more sluggish enemy comprehended their danger. He maintained
his tremendous fire for a time, when he observed the other ship
luffing across his course to secure a raking position, whereupon,
with the same unsurpassable seamanship that he had shown from
the first, he crossed the wake of the foremost ship and obtained
a raking position himself. Before the vessel could extricate itself
Stewart raked her twice. Then the second ship repeated the attempt
of its consort, but Stewart not only defeated her, but again laid
the <em>Constitution</em> so as to rake her.</p>

<p>In the manoeuvring the two ships drew up side by side, and, the
enemy opening with the port battery, Stewart replied with his
starboard guns. The fire of the American was so amazingly accurate
and effective that in a short time the enemy hoisted a light and
fired a gun in token of surrender. The battle occurred in the
early hours of evening.</p>

<p>Upon sending an officer to take possession, it was found that
the captured vessel was the English 32-gun frigate <em>Cyane</em>.
It took an hour to transfer and secure the prisoners, when the
<em>Constitution</em> started after the other ship, which was
some distance away, engaged in repairing her rigging. Seeing the
American approaching, and not knowing what fate had befallen her
consort, the Englishman gallantly bore down to meet his formidable
enemy. The two vessels passed each other and exchanged broadsides,
but with another display of masterly seamanship Stewart, before
the other was aware of her danger, crossed her wake and raked
her.</p>

<p>This startling experience convinced the Englishman that he had
met his master and he crowded on all sail in the desperate effort
to escape. The <em>Constitution</em> was immediately after her,
and by ten o'clock secured a position from which to deliver another
of her terrible broadsides, seeing which the enemy surrendered.
She proved to be the British sloop of war <em>Levant</em>, of
21 guns.</p>

<p>In this battle the <em>Constitution</em> had 4 killed and 10
wounded, while on the <em>Cyane</em> and <em>Levant</em> 35 were
killed and 42 wounded. Of all the battles in which this famous
ship was engaged, there was none more remarkable than this. When
Stewart advanced to the attack he believed both his enemies were
frigates. The manner in which he baffled every effort of the two
to rake him, while he repeatedly raked them, was one of the many
proofs that the American navy contained no finer seaman than he.
The grand old <em>Constitution</em> seemed to anticipate every
wish of her commander and responded with a promptness that could
not have been surpassed. The discipline of the crew was perfect,
and, after all, therefore, it is little wonder that one of the
last acts of the famous ship was the most brilliant of them all.</p>

<p>It is stated by Richard Watson Gilder that when Captain Stewart
was talking with the respective captains of the <em>Cyane</em>
and <em>Levant</em> in his own cabin, the two fell into a dispute,
each charging the other with failing to do the right thing during
the engagement, and insisting that if it had been done they would
not have been defeated. Stewart sat amused and interested until
he saw they were becoming angry, when he interfered.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," said he, "there's no need of your growing warm
over this affair; no matter what evolutions you made, or what
you did, the end would have been the same. If you don't believe
it, I will put each of you back on your ship with the same crews
and we'll fight it all over again."</p>

<p>Neither of the gentlemen was prepared to accept this proposal,
and there can be no doubt that Captain Stewart was warranted in
his declaration, and his prisoners knew it.</p>

<p>Stewart started for home with his prizes, and early in March
anchored in Port Praya. While there, three powerful British frigates
approached, which, through a series of singular coincidences,
were blockading Boston at the time the <em>Constitution</em> made
her escape some months before. They were anxious, above everything
else, to capture the most dreaded ship in the American navy. Stewart
knew that his only chance was to get away before they shut him
in, for the experience of the <em>Essex</em> at Valparaiso proved
that the neutrality of no port would protect an American cruiser.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he lost no time in getting to sea, leaving with
the utmost haste and signalling to the <em>Cyane</em> and <em>Levant</em>
to follow. They obeyed, and were handled with such skill that
all got to sea, with the squadron in hot pursuit. The chase was
continued for a long time, with the remarkable result that both
the <em>Constitution</em> and <em>Cyane</em> safely reached Boston,
while the <em>Levant</em> was recaptured&mdash;a small reward for the
exertions of the British squadron.</p>

<p>Maclay says: "In this brilliant cruise Captain Stewart proved
himself an officer of rare ability. His action with the <em>Cyane</em>
and <em>Levant</em>, and his masterly escape from the British
squadron, called for all the qualities of a great commander, while
his unhesitating attack on what appeared, in the heavy weather,
to be two frigates, the beautiful style in which the <em>Constitution</em>
was put through the most difficult manoeuvres, and the neatness
with which he captured a superior force, have ranked him as one
of the most remarkable naval officers of his day. Congress awarded
him a sword and gold medal."</p>

<p>It happened one day, when I was talking with Admiral Stewart
at his home, that he showed me a Toledo sword which had been presented
to him by the King of Spain, because of his rescue of a Spanish
ship, drifting helplessly in mid ocean, with the captain and all
the crew dead or prostrated by yellow fever.</p>

<p>The blade of the weapon, although quite plain and ordinary looking,
of course was very valuable, but the hilt was so rough and crude
that I expressed my surprise.</p>

<p>"I supposed that when a king makes a present of a sword," I said,
"that the hilt is generally of a more costly pattern than that."</p>

<p>"So it is," replied Stewart, accepting it from me and playfully
making a few lightning-like passes in the air just to show that
he had not forgotten how to handle the weapon; "that was a very
handsome sword when it came to me, and I could not accept it until
authorized by Congress. During my fight with the <em>Cyane</em>
and <em>Levant</em> I was walking back and forth with this sword
under my arm, the hilt slightly projecting in front of my chest,
when a grapeshot slipped it off, as it grazed me. The hilt which
it now has was put there by my gunner."</p>

<p>"Were you ever wounded in battle?" I asked. "I was struck only
once, and it amounted to nothing. It was in the same battle. A
pigeon became so frightened by the smoke and racket that it flew
hither and thither, and finally perched on my shoulder. While
there a musket ball struck its claw at the junction of the toes
with the leg, and entered my shoulder. The resistance it met was
so tough that it saved my shoulder from being shattered; except
for that, the hurt must have proved serious, but it did not bother
me at all."</p>

<p>The Admiral, still loosely holding the weapon in his hand, turned
his faded eyes toward the window and gazed out over the snow.
Those eyes seemed to look backward over the vista of forty, fifty,
sixty, seventy, eighty years, and must have recalled the many
stirring scenes in which he had taken part, as well as the faces
of the brave fellows, like himself, who had gone from earth long
ago, leaving him alone. Then the old veteran, still erect and
with the fires of patriotism glowing in his brave heart, softly
murmured:</p>

<p>"I have been more fortunate than I deserve; strange that I should
be the only one left, but it cannot be for long."</p>

<p>And yet he lived for seven more years. Then, when a scirrhus
cancer appeared on his tongue, a skilful surgeon told him it could
be easily removed and need cause him no trouble.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the Admiral, who was then past ninety, "I've lived
long enough; let it alone."</p>

<p>He died a few months later, and, as has been stated, was in his
ninety-second year.</p>
