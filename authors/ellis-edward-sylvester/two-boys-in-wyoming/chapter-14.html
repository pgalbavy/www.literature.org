<p>The minute quickly arrived when Jack Dudley could no longer doubt
that a great misfortune had befallen his comrade, Fred Greenwood.</p>

<p>In the anguish of anxiety Jack's imagination pictured many mishaps
that might account for the disappearance. He must have heard the
report of the elder's Winchester, and, since Fred's attention
was centred upon the herd of antelope, he could not fail to know
that his friend had secured one of them for their evening meal.
The only thing to prevent his hastening to join Jack must have
been his inability to do so. There was the remote possibility
that his accident had been of a nature that involved no one else&mdash;such,
for instance, as sudden illness, though Jack had never known anything
like that to overtake his friend.</p>

<p>All that the youth could do was to attempt to follow the route
that Fred had taken when he set out to place himself on the other
side of the game. It was guesswork to trace his footsteps, but
the elder youth made the effort. When he had progressed half the
distance, however, he paused, convinced that his labor was utterly
useless. He called to Fred, repeated their familiar signals and
fired several charges in air, with no more response than at first.</p>

<p>"He has been either killed or carried off by a party of Indians,"
was the conclusion that forced itself upon him.</p>

<p>And with this conviction came the certainty that it was out of
the power of Jack Dudley to do anything for his friend. He might
tramp back and forth for nights and days, but with no success,
for Fred Greenwood was gone&mdash;whither?</p>

<p>Had Jack been skilled in woodcraft, possibly he might have discovered
some signs along the valley that would have enlightened him, but
he was untrained in the ways of red men and was not equal to the
task. A dog that knew how to track a person would have been of
immeasurable value, but such a canine was not to be had.</p>

<p>One memory clung tormentingly to the searcher. It was the demoniac
face of Motoza, the Sioux, when Fred Greenwood compelled him to
return the Winchester of Jack. There could be but one interpretation
of that expression, and it boded the worst for the missing youth.</p>

<p>"Motoza feels no affection for me, but his hatred of Fred is
so intense that he is bent on revenging himself; yet I did not
think he would strike so soon."</p>

<p>The afternoon was drawing to a close, and Jack was fully two
miles from camp. If he wished to reach their rendezvous before
night he had no time to waste. The problem was now in the shape
that Hank Hazletine's help was indispensable. If anyone could
assist Fred Greenwood, the guide was the man.</p>

<p>"He promised to meet us this evening, and if I wait I shall lose
my way."</p>

<p>Accordingly the lad faced in the direction of the plateau and
pressed forward with energy. In his haste he kept the former landmarks
in view, and his previous experience had given him a certain familiarity
with the region which prevented his going astray. Once more he
leaped the canyon, without pausing longer than to glance into
its depths as he swung over it. He saw nothing of the bulky carcass
of the grizzly bear that had fallen a victim to the marksmanship
of himself and friend, and just as night was shutting in he reached
the edge of the small plateau where the ponies were contentedly
grazing.</p>

<p>In one respect better fortune than he anticipated awaited him.
Instead of being compelled to pass the intolerable hours in waiting
for the coming of the guide, he saw he had already reached the
spot. A fire was burning at the mouth of the cavern, and the sinewy
figure of the veteran was observed as he moved to and fro before
it. Detecting the approach of Jack, he stood erect and silently
watched him as he drew near.</p>

<p>A person as agitated as Jack Dudley finds it hard to conceal
his feelings. Something in the action and the expression of his
white face as he came near enough to be seen distinctly gave the
hunter the knowledge that matters had gone amiss with the boy.
True to his word, Hank had brought no food back to camp. He had
eaten his evening meal before going thither, leaving his young
friends to provide for their own wants.</p>

<p>"Where's the younker?" was his question, before Jack halted.</p>

<p>"O Hank! I do not know what has happened; I fear we shall never
see Fred again!"</p>

<p>And, unable to restrain his grief that had been pent up so long,
Jack broke down and sobbed like a child. The veteran showed a
delicacy that would hardly have been expected from him. He knew
it would do Jack good to yield to his sorrow for a brief while,
for he would soon become cooler and more self-possessed. Accordingly
the hunter remained silent until the youth mastered his emotions,
when he laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder and said:</p>

<p>"Now, set down here beside me and let me know all about it."</p>

<p>Jack appreciated his consideration, and taking the seat to which
he was invited, he told, in a choking voice, the story of the
incident beside the little valley, when Fred Greenwood, in high
spirits, walked away and vanished as if the earth had opened and
swallowed him. Jack did not break down again, for he was resolved
to be manly and brave. He would not think of his young friend
as wholly lost, nor allow himself to consider the awful possibility
of returning home with the message that Fred would never be seen
again. Jack felt it was time for action, not for lamentation.</p>

<p>Hazletine was grave and thoughtful, but the youth had hardly
finished his narrative when he said:</p>

<p>"You haven't told me all."</p>

<p>"I do not think of anything I have omitted."</p>

<p>"Your story begins with the first sight of the antelope; what
happened afore that?"</p>

<p>"A good deal; I did not think you would care to hear it."</p>

<p>"I want every word."</p>

<p>So it was that Jack began with their departure in the morning
from camp, and made clear every occurrence down to the start for
the valley where the great misfortune overtook them. He realized,
while describing the meeting with Motoza, the important bearing
that it had upon the disappearance of Fred Greenwood.</p>

<p>When the story was completed the guide emitted a low whistle,
followed by an exclamation of so vigorous a character that it
startled Jack. Hank sprang excitedly to his feet and strode back
and forth until able to control his feelings. Then with a voice
and expression of scornful contempt, he asked:</p>

<p>"What do you think of Motoza's love for you and Fred?"</p>

<p>"I admit that you were right and we were wrong about him; I feared
for Fred, not for myself, and you see he has not tried to harm
<em>me</em>."</p>

<p>"That ain't 'cause he loves you like the brother he calls hisself,
but 'cause he hates Fred more'n he does you. If he hadn't had
such a good chance to grab the other younker, he would have grabbed
you."</p>

<p>"Then you have no doubt that Motoza is the cause of it all?"</p>

<p>"No more doubt than that you're a setting on that stone there."</p>

<p>"I can't understand it; Fred is not the one to let a single Indian
make him prisoner, when one is as well armed as the other."</p>

<p>"Who said there was only one of the imps?"</p>

<p>The abrupt question meant a good deal. It had already been proven
that a number of other Indians were in the vicinity; but Jack
had not thought of associating them with the vagrant Sioux in
his hostility to the young hunters, although there was scarcely
a doubt that Motoza had had one helper or more in his designs
against Fred Greenwood. This put a new face on the matter, and
Hazletine discussed the question more freely.</p>

<p>"There must be a half-dozen varmints or so in the mountains;
they've sneaked off the reservation and are hunting here without
permission from the folks that have 'em in charge. It ain't likely
they started out with any other idee than to have a little frolic
of their own, meaning to go back when they was through; but, as
I remarked afore, when an Injin sees a good chance to raise the
mischief with just as good a chance of not being found out, he's
pretty sartin to do it. Wal, things took such a queer shape when
you younkers and Motoza seen each other that all the ugliness
in him has come out, and that's what's urging him now."</p>

<p>"It seems to me, Hank, that if he meant to punish Fred for humiliating
him, the method was simple."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By shooting him from ambush; he could do it without being seen,
and I can think of no way by which the guilt could be brought
home to him."</p>

<p>"You're off there. Motoza knows that you and me are in these
parts, and that we're the friends of the younker; what had took
place afore, with what I'd swear to, would hang Motoza, and he
knows it."</p>

<p>This declaration was not quite clear to Jack, but it sounded
as if the guide was willing to so modify his testimony in court
as to insure the conviction of the Sioux in case he followed the
plan named by the youth.</p>

<p>The veteran would have considered it right, under the circumstances,
to do such a thing.</p>

<p>"Since the fear of our testimony restrained him, why did he not
seek to remove <em>us</em> in the same manner, when he has had
more than one opportunity?"</p>

<p>"And there you're off again. Motoza wouldn't have had any trouble
in wiping out two young tenderfeet like you, but he'd likely run
agin a snag when he tried it on <em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>The hunter shut his lips and shook his head with eloquent earnestness.</p>

<p>"S'pose he'd done such a thing," he added, angrily; "don't you
see that when the Government larned, as it would be sure to larn,
that three persons had been killed near the reservation by some
of the Injins, there would be the biggest kind of excitement?
It would put its best officers at work, and never let up till
everything was brought to light. You see that, Motoza not being
the only Injin in these parts when the thing was done, the officers
would have some of the other varmints to work on, and they'd got
the whole story from 'em, which would mean the hanging of the
Sioux."</p>

<p>Jack saw the force of his friend's words. Even in this wild region,
where one would naturally suppose he was beyond reach of the law,
the man who committed a grave crime faced a serious risk. Certainly
there was much less danger in "removing" one person than three.</p>

<p>"As it is, Motoza has placed himself in a bad position, but it
would have been tenfold worse had he shot you and me."</p>

<p>Hank nodded his head, but qualified his assent:</p>

<p>"He could have picked you off, but not <em>me</em>, and he knows
that he would have had me on his trail without waiting for the
officers to help."</p>

<p>"But he must face the same thing as it is."</p>

<p>"Don't you see that he had to make the ch'ice atween doing nothing
at all or tackling the younker? The Sioux is such an imp and is
so crazy for revenge that he made up his mind to chance it the
least he could, and he went for the tenderfoot that he hates the
most."</p>

<p>Jack tremblingly asked the question that had been in his mind
for some minutes.</p>

<p>"Do you think he shot Fred?"</p>

<p>The guide slowly turned his head and looked fixedly at the youth
before replying:</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you've heerd his gun?"</p>

<p>The question sent a thrill of hope through the heart of Jack,
but it was quickly succeeded by the dull torture that was there
before. True, he would have heard the report of a rifle if fired
anywhere near him during the afternoon, but a treacherous Sioux
like Motoza was too cunning to expose himself in that manner,
and would have resorted to a different method.</p>

<p>"He could have slain poor Fred in some other way, but do you
believe he has done so?"</p>

<p>"Younker," replied the sympathetic guide, "I ain't the one to
trifle with your feelings, fur you don't feel much worse than
me, but I own up that I don't know anything more 'bout this bus'ness
than you. I mean by that," he hastened to explain, "that I can't
figger out in my mind what that varmint has done till I pick up
more knowledge than you've been able to give me, and I can't do
that afore to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>This sounded reasonable, but it was trying beyond imagination,
for it indicated that the long night must be spent in idleness,
without the raising of a finger to help the one who perhaps was
in the most imminent need of such assistance. There was no help,
however, for it, and Jack accepted the decision of his friend
without a murmur.</p>

<p>The two sat at the mouth of the cavern, talking in low tones,
until the night was well advanced, when Hank said, with a voice
that sounded wonderfully low and tender for him:</p>

<p>"Now go in and lay down, younker, fur there'll be plenty of work
fur you to do to-morrer, and there's no saying when you'll git
the chance to sleep agin."</p>

<p>"Call me when it is my turn to go on guard."</p>

<p>"All right; and don't show yourself till I <em>do</em> call you."</p>

<p>Jack walked into the cavern, first pausing to fling some wood
on the fire. Mingled with his feeling of despair was a dread of
being alone in the gloom. He did not believe he would sleep a
wink through the night, for never were his emotions wrought to
a more keenly torturing point. It was almost impossible to remain
still, but he forced himself to lie down, with his heavy blanket
gathered around him.</p>

<p>It would be distressing to dwell upon the anguish and grief of
the youth, as he lay wide awake, his brain alert and his blood
at fever-heat. At times it all seemed so like a dream that he
turned his head to make sure Fred Greenwood, his loved chum and
comrade, was not lying at his side. But no, it was all a dreadful
reality, and he groaned in spirit.</p>

<p>As the minutes passed he appeared to grow more wakeful, until
he was in as full possession of his faculties as when fleeing
from the grizzly bear. And it was while lying thus, wondering
what the hour could be, that he became aware that Hank Hazletine
was standing at the mouth of the cavern, on the other side of
the smouldering fire. The light was reflected so clearly from
his bearded face that it was seen distinctly, while the position
of Jack, muffled in his blanket, threw his own countenance in
shadow, which prevented the guide seeing it clearly.</p>

<p>Something prompted Jack to lie still and feign sleep, while he
kept his gaze on the man, who was looking fixedly at him. Suddenly
Hank pronounced his name in a low voice, repeating the call in
a louder tone. He wished to learn whether his young friend was
unconscious, and, since Jack made no reply, must have concluded
he was sleeping.</p>

<p>The guide next threw more wood on the blaze, which burned up
so brightly that the reflection reached far out on the grassy
plateau. Then, with a single glance at the prostrate figure, the
hunter turned away, his footsteps as noiseless as if he were stepping
on velvet.</p>

<p>Jack was mystified by the proceeding, but, suspecting its meaning,
he arose from his hard couch and passed outside. The moon had
not yet risen, but the bright stars were in the sky, and shining
with the brilliancy that he had noticed and admired on the previous
evening. He looked around for Hazletine, and, not seeing him,
imitated his action by pronouncing his name, but, as he suspected,
he was not within hearing.</p>

<p>"He has gone off to make some investigations between now and
morning. I am glad of it, for he may learn something which he
desires to know, and which he would never find out by staying
here. I wish I could have gone with him, but no doubt he will
do better alone."</p>

<p>It was demonstrated, therefore, that the guide had violated the
very rule which he had impressed more than once upon his young
friends, for he had left Jack Dudley sound asleep, as he believed,
without any one standing sentinel over him. But it was because
the circumstances were so exceptional and extraordinary that it
justified such suspension of the rules.</p>

<p>Jack did not hesitate to make himself as comfortable as the situation
would permit. He folded his blanket on the ground, and sat with
his back against the very rock where he had fallen asleep the
night before.</p>

<p>"No danger of my doing it again," he reflected; "and it wouldn't
make any difference if I did, since Hank believes I am dreaming."</p>

<p>Jack supposed he threw the wood on the flame to keep away the
possible danger from wild animals that might be prowling in the
neighborhood; though, because of the reasons named, there was
little to be apprehended from them. The youth was so alive to
the situation that he heard a cough from one of the ponies lying
on the ground near the further side of the plateau, and beyond
sight. Twice the watcher fancied he detected a shadowy figure
stealing here and there in the gloom, and he grasped his rifle,
ready for instant use; but it must have been a mistake on his
part, for nothing materialized, and, curious as it may seem, he
finally sank into a fitful slumber, which lasted a long time without
interruption.</p>
