<p><em>JOHNSON </em>was the hero of the hour. It was he who had
tracked the burglars, laid his plans, and recovered the lost silver.
He had not thrown the stone&mdash;public opinion decided that Mabel
and her aunt must have been mistaken in supposing that there was
a stone at all. But he did not deny the warning letter. It was
Gerald who went out after breakfast to buy the newspaper, and
who read aloud to the others the two columns of fiction which
were the <em>Liddlesby Observer's</em> report of the facts. As
he read every mouth opened wider and wider, and when he ceased
with "this gifted fellow-townsman with detective instincts which
outrival those of Messrs. Lecoq and Holmes, and whose promotion
is now assured," there was quite a blank silence.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jimmy, breaking it, "he doesn't stick it on neither,
does he?"</p>

<p>"I feel," said Kathleen, "as if it was our fault&mdash;as if it was
us had told all these whoppers; because if it hadn't been for
you they couldn't have, Jerry. How could he say all that?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Gerald, trying to be fair, "you know, after all,
the chap had to say something. I'm glad <em>I<hr>" </em>He stopped
abruptly.</p>

<p>"You're glad you what?"</p>

<p>"No matter," said he, with an air of putting away affairs of
state. "Now, what are we going to do to-day? The faithful Mabel
approaches; she will want her ring. And you and Jimmy want it
too. Oh, I know. Mademoiselle hasn't had any attention paid to
her for more days than our hero likes to confess."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't always call yourself 'our hero,'" said Jimmy;
"you aren't mine, anyhow."</p>

<p>"You're both of you <em>mine</em>," said Kathleen hastily.</p>

<p>"Good little girl." Gerald smiled annoyingly. "Keep baby brother
in a good temper till Nursie comes back."</p>

<p>"You're not going out without us?" Kathleen asked in haste.</p>

"'And in the market there<br/>

</p>
</div>
<p>If you want to come too, get your boots on, and look slippy about
it."</p>

<p>"I don't want to come," said Jimmy, and sniffed.</p>

<p>Kathleen turned a despairing look on Gerald.</p>

<p>"Oh, James, James," said Gerald sadly, "how difficult you make
it for me to forget that you're my little brother! If ever I treat
you like one of the other chaps, and rot you like I should Turner
or Moberley or any of my pals&mdash;well, this is what comes of it."</p>

<p>"You don't call them your baby brothers," said Jimmy, and truly.</p>

<p>"No; and I'll take precious good care I don't call you it again.
Come on, my hero and heroine. The devoted Mesrour is your salaaming
slave."</p>

<p>The three met Mabel opportunely at the corner of the square where
every Friday the stalls and the awnings and the green umbrellas
were pitched, and poultry, pork, pottery, vegetables, drapery,
sweets, toys, tools, mirrors, and all sorts of other interesting
merchandise were spread out on trestle tables, piled on carts
whose horses were stabled and whose shafts were held in place
by piled wooden cases, or laid out, as in the case of crockery
and hardware, on the bare flagstones of the market-place.</p>

<p>The sun was shining with great goodwill, and, as Mabel remarked,
"all Nature looked smiling and gay." There were a few bunches
of flowers among the vegetables, and the children hesitated, balanced
in choice.</p>

<p>"Mignonette is sweet," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Roses are roses," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Carnations are tuppence," said Jimmy; and Gerald, sniffing among
the bunches of tightly-tied tea-roses, agreed that this settled
it.</p>

<p>So the carnations were bought, a bunch of yellow ones, like sulphur,
a bunch of white ones like clotted cream, and a bunch of red ones
like the cheeks of the doll that Kathleen never played with. They
took the carnations home, and Kathleen's green hair-ribbon came
in beautifully for tying them up, which was hastily done on the
doorstep.</p>

<p>Then discreetly Gerald knocked at the door of the drawing-room,
where Mademoiselle seemed to sit all day.</p>

<p>"Entrez!" came her voice; and Gerald entered. She was not reading,
as usual, but bent over a sketch-book; on the table was an open
colour-box of un-English appearance, and a box of that slate-coloured
liquid so familiar alike to the greatest artist in water-colours
and to the humblest child with a six-penny paint-box.</p>

<p>"With all of our loves," said Gerald, laying the flowers down
suddenly before her.</p>

<p>"But it is that you are a dear child. For this it must that I
embrace you&mdash;no?" And before Gerald could explain that he was
too old, she kissed him with little quick French pecks on the
two cheeks.</p>

<p>"Are you painting?" he asked hurriedly, to hide his annoyance
at being treated like a baby.</p>

<p>"I achieve a sketch of yesterday," she answered; and before he
had time to wonder what yesterday would look like in a picture
she showed him a beautiful and exact sketch of Yalding Towers.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>SHE KISSED HIM WITH LITTLE QUICK FRENCH PECKS</em>.]</p>

<p>"Oh, I say&mdash;ripping!" was the critic's comment. "I say, mayn't
the others come and see?" The others came, including Mabel, who
stood awkwardly behind the rest, and looked over Jimmy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I say, you are clever," said Gerald respectfully.</p>

<p>"To what good to have the talent, when one must pass one's life
at teaching the infants?" said Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>"It must be fairly beastly," Gerald owned.</p>

<p>"You, too, see the design?" Mademoiselle asked Mabel, adding:
"A friend from the town, yes?"</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said Mabel politely. "No, I'm not from the town.
I live at Yalding Towers."</p>

<p>The name seemed to impress Mademoiselle very much. Gerald anxiously
hoped in his own mind that she was not a snob.</p>

<p>"Yalding Towers," she repeated, "but this is very extraordinary.
Is it possible that you are then of the family of Lord Yalding?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't any family," said Mabel; "he's not married."</p>

<p>"I would say are you&mdash;how you say?&mdash;cousin&mdash;sister&mdash;niece?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mabel, flushing hotly, "I'm nothing grand at all.
I'm Lord Yalding's housekeeper's niece."</p>

<p>"But you know Lord Yalding, is it not?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mabel, "I've never seen him."</p>

<p>"He comes then never to his château?"</p>

<p>"Not since I've lived there. But he's coming next week."</p>

<p>"Why lives he not there?" Mademoiselle asked.</p>

<p>"Auntie say he's too poor," said Mabel, and proceeded to tell
the tale as she had heard it in the housekeeper's room: how Lord
Yalding's uncle had left all the money he could leave away from
Lord Yalding to Lord Yalding's second cousin, and poor Lord Yalding
had only just enough to keep the old place in repair, and to live
very quietly indeed somewhere else, but not enough to keep the
house open or to live there; and how he couldn't sell the house
because it was "in tale."</p>

<p>"What is it then&mdash;in tail?" asked Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>"In a tale that the lawyers write out," said Mabel, proud of
her knowledge and flattered by the deep interest of the French
governess; "and when once they've put your house in one of their
tales you can't sell it or give it away, but you have to leave
it to your son, even if you don't want to."</p>

<p>"But how his uncle could he be so cruel&mdash;to leave him the château
and no money?" Mademoiselle asked; and Kathleen and Jimmy stood
amazed at the sudden keenness of her interest in what seemed to
them the dullest story.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can tell you that too," said Mabel. "Lord Yalding wanted
to marry a lady his uncle didn't want him to, a barmaid or a ballet
lady or something, and he wouldn't give her up, and his uncle
said, 'Well then,' and left everything to the cousin."</p>

<p>"And you say he is not married."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;the lady went into a convent; I expect she's bricked-up
alive by now."</p>

<p>"Bricked<hr>?"</p>

<p>"In a wall, you know," said Mabel, pointing explainingly at the
pink and gilt roses of the wall-paper, "shut up to kill them.
That's what they do to you in convents."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Mademoiselle; "in convents are very kind good
women; there is but one thing in convents that is detestable&mdash;the
locks on the doors. Sometimes people cannot get out, especially
when they are very young and their relations have placed them
there for their welfare and happiness. But brick&mdash;how you say
it?&mdash;enwalling ladies to kill them. No&mdash;it does itself never.
And this Lord&mdash;he did not then seek his lady?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;he sought her right enough," Mabel assured her; "but
there are millions of convents, you know, and he had no idea where
to look, and they sent back his letters from the post-office,
and<hr>"</p>

<p>"Ciel!" cried Mademoiselle, "but it seems that one knows all
in the housekeeper's saloon."</p>

<p>"Pretty well all," said Mabel simply.</p>

<p>"And you think he will find her? No?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll find her all right," said Mabel, "when he's old and
broken down, you know&mdash;and dying; and then a gentle sister of
charity will soothe his pillow, and just when he's dying she'll
reveal herself and say: 'My own lost love!' and his face will
light up with a wonderful joy and he'll expire with her beloved
name on his parched lips."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle's was the silence of sheer astonishment. "You do
the prophesy, it appears?" she said at last.</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Mabel, "I got that out of a book. I can tell you
lots more fatal love stories any time you like."</p>

<p>The French governess gave a little jump, as though she had suddenly
remembered something.</p>

<p>"It is nearly dinner-time," she said. "Your friend &mdash;Mabelle,
yes&mdash;will be your convivial, and in her honour we will make a
little feast. My beautiful flowers&mdash;put them to the water, Kathleen.
I run to buy the cakes. Wash the hands, all, and be ready when
I return."</p>

<p>Smiling and nodding to the children, she left them, and ran up
the stairs.</p>

<p>"Just as if she was young," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"She <em>is</em> young," said Mabel. "Heaps of ladies have offers
of marriage when they're no younger than her. I've seen lots of
weddings too, with much older brides. And why didn't you tell
me she was so beautiful?"</p>

<p>"<em>Is</em> she?" asked Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Of course she is; and what a darling to think of cakes for me,
and calling me a convivial!"</p>

<p>"Look here," said Gerald, "I call this jolly decent of her. You
know, governesses never have more than the meanest pittance, just
enough to sustain life, and here she is spending her little all
on us. Supposing we just don't go out to-day, but play with her
instead. I expect she's most awfully bored really."</p>

<p>"Would she really like it?" Kathleen wondered. "Aunt Emily says
grown-ups never really like playing. They do it to please us."</p>

<p>"They little know," Gerald answered, "how often we do it to please
them."</p>

<p>"We've got to do that dressing-up with the Princess clothes anyhow&mdash;we
said we would," said Kathleen. "Let's treat her to that."</p>

<p>"Rather near tea-time," urged Jimmy, "so that there'll be a fortunate
interruption and the play won't go on for ever."</p>

<p>"I suppose all the things are safe?" Mabel asked.</p>

<p>"Quite. I told you where I put them. Come on, Jimmy; let's help
lay the table. We'll get Eliza to put out the best china."</p>

<p>They went.</p>

<p>"It was lucky," said Gerald, struck by a sudden thought, "that
the burglars didn't go for the diamonds in the treasure-chamber."</p>

<p>"They couldn't," said Mabel almost in a whisper; "they didn't
know about them. I don't believe anybody knows about them, except
me&mdash;and you, and you're sworn to secrecy." This, you will remember,
had been done almost at the beginning. "I know aunt doesn't know.
I just found out the spring by accident. Lord Yalding's kept the
secret well."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd got a secret like that to keep," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"If the burglars <em>do</em> know," said Mabel, "it'll all come
out at the trial. Lawyers make you tell everything you know at
trials, and a lot of lies besides."</p>

<p>"There won't be any trial," said Gerald, kicking the leg of the
piano thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No trial?"</p>

<p>"It said in the paper." Gerald went on slowly, "'The miscreants
must have received warning from a confederate, for the admirable
preparations to arrest them as they returned for their ill-gotten
plunder were unavailing. But the police have a clue.'"</p>

<p>"What a pity!" said Mabel.</p>

<p>"You needn't worry&mdash;they haven't got any old clue," said Gerald,
still attentive to the piano leg.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean the clue; I meant the confederate."</p>

<p>"It's a pity you think he's a pity, because he was <em>me</em>,"
said Gerald, standing up and leaving the piano leg alone. He looked
straight before him, as the boy on the burning deck may have looked.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it," he said. "I know you'll think I'm a criminal,
but I couldn't do it. I don't know how detectives can. I went
over a prison once, with father; and after I'd given the tip to
Johnson I remembered that, and I just couldn't. I know I'm a beast,
and not worthy to be a British citizen."</p>

<p>"I think it was rather nice of you," said Mabel kindly. "How
did you warn them?"</p>

<p>"I just shoved a paper under the man's door&mdash;the one that I knew
where he lived&mdash;to tell him to lie low."</p>

<p>"Oh! do tell me&mdash;what did you put on it exactly?" Mabel warmed
to this new interest.</p>

<p>"It said: 'The police know all except your names. Be virtuous
and you are safe. But if there's any more burgling I shall split
and you may rely on that from a friend.' I know it was wrong,
but I couldn't help it. Don't tell the others. They wouldn't understand
why I did it. I don't understand it myself."</p>

<p>"I do," said Mabel: "it's because you've got a kind and noble
heart."</p>

<p>"Kind fiddlestick, my good child!" said Gerald, suddenly losing
the burning boy expression and becoming in a flash entirely himself.
"Cut along and wash your hands; you're as black as ink."</p>

<p>"So are you," said Mabel, "and I'm not. It's dye with me. Auntie
was dyeing a blouse this morning. It told you how in <em>Home
Drivel</em>&mdash;and she's as black as ink too, and the blouse is
all streaky. Pity the ring won't make just parts of you invisible&mdash;the
dirt, for instance."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Gerald said unexpectedly, "it won't make even all
of you invisible again."</p>

<p>"Why not? You haven't been doing anything to it&mdash;have you?" Mabel
sharply asked.</p>

<p>"No; but didn't you notice you were invisible twenty-one hours;
I was fourteen hours invisible, and Eliza only seven&mdash;that's seven
less each time. And now we've come to<hr>"</p>

<p>"How frightfully good you are at sums!" said Mabel, awestruck.</p>

<p>"You see, it's got seven hours less each time, and seven from
seven is nought; it's got to be something different this time.
And then afterwards&mdash;it can't be minus seven, because I don't
see how&mdash;unless it made you more visible&mdash;thicker, you know."</p>

<p>"<em>Don't!</em>" said Mabel; "you make my head go round."</p>

<p>"And there's another odd thing," Gerald went on; "when you're
invisible your relations don't love you. Look at your aunt, and
Cathy never turning a hair at me going burgling. We haven't got
to the bottom of that ring yet. Crikey! here's Mademoiselle with
the cakes. Run, bold bandits&mdash;wash for your lives!"</p>

<p>They ran.</p>

<p>It was not cakes only; it was plums and grapes and jam tarts
and soda-water and raspberry vinegar, and chocolates in pretty
boxes and "pure, thick, rich" cream in brown jugs, also a big
bunch of roses. Mademoiselle was strangely merry, for a governess.
She served out the cakes and tarts with a liberal hand, made wreaths
of the flowers for all their heads&mdash;she was not eating much herself&mdash;drank
the health of Mabel, as the guest of the day, in the beautiful
pink drink that comes from mixing raspberry vinegar and soda-water,
and actually persuaded Jimmy to wear his wreath, on the ground
that the Greek gods as well as the goddesses always wore wreaths
at a feast.</p>

<p>There never was such a feast provided by any French governess
since French governesses began. There were jokes and stories and
laughter. Jimmy showed all those tricks with forks and corks and
matches and apples which are so deservedly popular. Mademoiselle
told them stories of her own school-days when she was "a quite
little girl with two tight tresses&mdash;so," and when they could not
understand the tresses, called for paper and pencil and drew the
loveliest little picture of herself when she was a child with
two short fat pig-tails sticking out from her head like knitting-needles
from a ball of dark worsted. Then she drew pictures of everything
they asked for, till Mabel pulled Gerald's jacket and whispered:
"The acting!"</p>

<p>"Draw us the front of a theatre," said Gerald tactfully, "a French
theatre."</p>

<p>"They are the same thing as the English theatres," Mademoiselle
told him.</p>

<p>"Do you like acting&mdash;the theatre, I mean?"</p>

<p>"But yes &mdash;I love it."</p>

<p>"All right," said Gerald briefly. "We'll act a play for you&mdash;now&mdash;this
afternoon if you like."</p>

<p>"Eliza will be washing up," Cathy whispered, "and she was promised
to see it."</p>

<p>"Or this evening," said Gerald; "and please, Mademoiselle, may
Eliza come in and look on?"</p>

<p>"But certainly," said Mademoiselle; "amuse yourselves well, my
children."</p>

<p>"But it's <em>you</em>," said Mabel suddenly, "that we want to
amuse. Because we love you very much&mdash;don't we, all of you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the chorus came unhesitatingly. Though the others would
never have thought of saying such a thing on their own account.
Yet, as Mabel said it, they found to their surprise that it was
true.</p>

<p>"Tiens!" said Mademoiselle, "you love the old French governess?
Impossible," and she spoke rather indistinctly.</p>

<p>"You're not old," said Mabel; "at least not so very," she added
brightly, "and you're as lovely as a Princess."</p>

<p>"Go then, flatteress!" said Mademoiselle, laughing; and Mabel
went. The others were already half-way up the stairs.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>DOWN CAME THE LOVELIEST BLUE-BLACK HAIR</em>.]</p>

<p>Mademoiselle sat in the drawing-room as usual, and it was a good
thing that she was not engaged in serious study, for it seemed
that the door opened and shut almost ceaselessly all throughout
the afternoon. Might they have the embroidered antimacassars and
the sofa cushions? Might they have the clothes-line out of the
washhouse? Eliza said they mightn't, but might they? Might they
have the sheepskin hearth-rugs? Might they have tea in the garden,
because they had almost got the stage ready in the dining-room,
and Eliza wanted to set tea? Could Mademoiselle lend them any
coloured clothes&mdash;scarves or dressing-gowns, or anything bright?
Yes, Mademoiselle could, and did&mdash;silk things, surprisingly lovely
for a governess to have. Had Mademoiselle any rouge? They had
always heard that French ladies<hr> No. Mademoiselle hadn't&mdash;and
to judge by the colour of her face, Mademoiselle didn't need it.
Did Mademoiselle think the chemist sold rouge&mdash;or had she any
false hair to spare? At this challenge Mademoiselle's pale fingers
pulled out a dozen hairpins, and down came the loveliest blue-black
hair, hanging to her knees in straight, heavy lines.</p>

<p>"No, you terrible infants," she cried. "I have not the false
hair, nor the rouge. And my teeth&mdash;you want them also, without
doubt?"</p>

<p>She showed them in a laugh.</p>

<p>"I <em>said</em> you were a Princess," said Mabel, "and now I
know. You're Rupunzel. Do always wear your hair like that! May
we have the peacock fans, please, off the mantelpiece, and the
things that loop back the curtains, and all the handkerchiefs
you've got?"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle denied them nothing. They had the fans and the handkerchiefs
and some large sheets of expensive drawing-paper out of the school
cupboard, and Mademoiselle's best sable paint-brush and her paint-box.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought," murmured Gerald, pensively sucking
the brush and gazing at the paper mask he had just painted, "that
she was such a brick in disguise? I wonder why crimson lake always
tastes just like Liebig's Extract."</p>

<p>Everything was pleasant that day somehow. There are some days
like that, you know, when everything goes well from the very beginning;
all the things you want are in their places, nobody misunderstands
you, and all that you do turns out admirably. How different from
those other days which we all know too well, when your shoe-lace
breaks, your comb is mislaid, your brush spins on its back on
the floor and lands under the bed where you can't get at it&mdash;you
drop the soap, your buttons come off, an eyelash gets into your
eye, you have used your last clean handkerchief, your collar is
frayed at the edge and cuts your neck, and at the very last moment
your suspender breaks, and there is no string. On such a day as
this you are naturally late for breakfast, and every one thinks
you did it on purpose. And the day goes on and on, getting worse
and worse&mdash;you mislay your exercise-book, you drop your arithmetic
in the mud, your pencil breaks, and when you open your knife to
sharpen the pencil you split your nail. On such a day you jam
your thumb in doors, and muddle the messages you are sent on by
grown-ups. You upset your tea, and your bread-and-butter won't
hold together for a moment. And when at last you get to bed&mdash;usually
in disgrace&mdash;it is no comfort at all to you to know that not a
single bit of it is your own fault.</p>

<p>This day was not one of those days, as you will have noticed.
Even the tea in the garden&mdash;there was a bricked bit by a rockery
that made a steady floor for the tea-table&mdash;was most delightful,
though the thoughts of four out of the five were busy with the
coming play, and the fifth had thoughts of her own that had had
nothing to do with tea or acting.</p>

<p>Then there was an interval of slamming doors, interesting silences,
feet that flew up and down stairs.</p>

<p>It was still good daylight when the dinner-bell rang&mdash;the signal
had been agreed upon at tea-time, and carefully explained to Eliza.
Mademoiselle laid down her book and passed out of the sunset-yellowed
hall into the faint yellow gaslight of the dining-room. The giggling
Eliza held the door open before her, and followed her in. The
shutters had been closed&mdash;streaks of daylight showed above and
below them. The green-and-black tablecloths of the school dining-tables
were supported on the clothes-line from the backyard. The line
sagged in a graceful curve, but it answered its purpose of supporting
the curtains which concealed that part of the room which was the
stage.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>SHE SAW THAT FULLY HALF A DOZEN OF THESE CHAIRS
WERE OCCUPIED, AND BY THE QUEEREST PEOPLE</em>.]</p>

<p>Rows of chairs had been placed across the other end of the room&mdash;all
the chairs in the house, as it seemed&mdash;and Mademoiselle started
violently when she saw that fully half a dozen of these chairs
were occupied. And by the queerest people, too&mdash;an old woman with
a poke bonnet tied under her chin with a red handkerchief, a lady
in a large straw hat wreathed in flowers and the oddest hands
that stuck out over the chair in front of her, several men with
strange, clumsy figures, and all with hats on.</p>

<p>"But," whispered Mademoiselle, through the chinks of the tablecloths,
"you have then invited other friends? You should have asked me,
my children."</p>

<p>Laughter and something like a "hurrah" answered her from behind
the folds of the curtaining tablecloths.</p>

<p>"All right, Mademoiselle Rapunzel," cried Mabel; "turn the gas
up. It's only part of the entertainment."</p>

<p>Eliza, still giggling, pushed through the lines of chairs, knocking
off the hat of one of the visitors as she did so, and turned up
the three incandescent burners.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle looked at the figure seated nearest to her, stooped
to look more closely, half laughed, quite screamed, and sat down
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, "they are not alive!"</p>

<p>Eliza, with a much louder scream, had found out the same thing
and announced it differently. "They ain't got no insides," said
she. The seven members of the audience seated among the wilderness
of chairs had, indeed, no insides to speak of. Their bodies were
bolsters and rolled-up blankets, their spines were broom-handles,
and their arm and leg bones were hockey sticks and umbrellas.
Their shoulders were the wooden cross-pieces that Mademoiselle
used for keeping her jackets in shape; their hands were gloves
stuffed out with handkerchiefs; and their faces were the paper
masks painted in the afternoon by the untutored brush of Gerald,
tied on to the round heads made of the ends of stuffed bolster-cases.
The faces were really rather dreadful. Gerald had done his best,
but even after his best had been done you would hardly have known
they were faces, some of them, if they hadn't been in the positions
which faces visually occupy, between the collar and the hat. Their
eyebrows were furious with lamp-black frowns&mdash;their eyes the size,
and almost the shape, of five-shilling pieces, and on their lips
and cheeks had been spent much crimson lake and nearly the whole
of a half-pan of vermilion.</p>

<p>"You have made yourself an auditors, yes? Bravo!" cried Mademoiselle,
recovering herself and beginning to clap. And to the sound of
that clapping the curtain went up&mdash;or, rather, apart. A voice
said, in a breathless, choked way, "Beauty and the Beast," and
the stage was revealed.</p>

<p>It was a real stage too&mdash;the dining-tables pushed close together
and covered with pink-and-white counterpanes. It was a little
unsteady and creaky to walk on, but very imposing to look at.
The scene was simple, but convincing. A big sheet of cardboard,
bent square, with slits cut in it and a candle behind, represented,
quite transparently, the domestic hearth; a round hat-tin of Eliza's,
supported on a stool with a night-light under it, could not have
been mistaken, save by wilful malice, for anything but a copper.
A waste-paper basket with two or three school dusters and an overcoat
in it, and a pair of blue pyjamas over the back of a chair, put
the finishing touch to the scene. It did not need the announcement
from the wings, "The laundry at Beauty's home." It was so plainly
a laundry and nothing else.</p>

<p>In the wings: "They look just like a real audience, don't they?"
whispered Mabel. "Go on, Jimmy,&mdash;don't forget the Merchant has
to be pompous and use long words."</p>

<p>Jimmy, enlarged by pillows under Gerald's best overcoat, which
had been intentionally bought with a view to his probable growth
during the two years which it was intended to last him, a Turkish
towel turban on his head and an open umbrella over it, opened
the first act in a simple and swift soliloquy:</p>

<p>"I am the most unlucky merchant that ever was. I was once the
richest merchant in Bagdad, but I lost all my ships, and now I
live in a poor house that is all to bits; you can see how the
rain comes through the roof, and my daughters take in washing.
And<hr>"</p>

<p>The pause might have seemed long, but Gerald rustled in, elegant
in Mademoiselle's pink dressing-gown and the character of the
eldest daughter.</p>

<p>"A nice drying day," he minced. "Pa dear, put the umbrella the
other way up. It'll save us going out in the rain to fetch water.
Come on, sisters, dear father's got us a new wash-tub. Here's
luxury!"</p>

<p>Round the umbrella, now held the wrong way up, the three sisters
knelt and washed imaginary linen. Kathleen wore a violet skirt
of Eliza's, a blue blouse of her own, and a cap of knotted handkerchiefs.
A white nightdress girt with a white apron and two red carnations
in Mabel's black hair left no doubt as to which of the three was
Beauty.</p>

<p>The scene went very well. The final dance with waving towels
was all that there is of charming, Mademoiselle said; and Eliza
was so much amused that, as she said, she got quite a nasty stitch
along of laughing so hearty.</p>

<p>You know pretty well what Beauty and the Beast would be like
acted by four children who had spent the afternoon in arranging
their costumes and so had left no time for rehearsing what they
had to say. Yet it delighted them, and it charmed their audience.
And what more can any play do, even Shakespeare's? Mabel, in her
Princess clothes, was a resplendent Beauty; and Gerald a Beast
who wore the drawing-room hearthrugs with an air of indescribable
distinction. If Jimmy was not a talkative merchant, he made it
up with a stoutness practically unlimited, and Kathleen surprised
and delighted even herself by the quickness with which she changed
from one to the other of the minor characters&mdash;fairies, servants,
and messengers. It was at the end of the second act that Mabel,
whose costume, having reached the height of elegance, could not
be bettered and therefore did not need to be changed, said to
Gerald, sweltering under the weighty magnificence of his beast-skin:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, you might let us have the ring back."</p>

<p>"I'm going to," said Gerald, who had quite forgotten it. "I'll
give it you in the next scene. Only don't lose it, or go putting
it on. You might go out all together and never be seen again,
or you might get seven times as visible as any one else, so that
all the rest of us would look like shadows beside you, you'd be
so thick, or<hr>"</p>

<p>"Ready!" said Kathleen, bustling in, once more a wicked sister.</p>

<p>Gerald managed to get his hand into his pocket under his hearthrug,
and when he rolled his eyes in agonies of sentiment, and said,
"Farewell, dear Beauty! Return quickly, for if you remain long
absent from your faithful beast he will assuredly perish," he
pressed a ring into her hand and added: "This is a magic ring
that will give you anything you wish. When you desire to return
to your own disinterested beast, put on the ring and utter your
wish. Instantly you will be by my side."</p>

<p>Beauty-Mabel took the ring, and it was <em>the</em> ring.</p>

<p>The curtains closed to warm applause from two pairs of hands.</p>

<p>The next scene went splendidly. The sisters were almost <em>too</em>
natural in their disagreeableness, and Beauty's annoyance when
they splashed her Princess's dress with real soap and water was
considered a miracle of good acting. Even the merchant rose to
something more than mere pillows, and the curtain fell on his
pathetic assurance that in the absence of his dear Beauty he was
wasting away to a shadow. And again two pairs of hands applauded.</p>

<p>"Here, Mabel, catch hold," Gerald appealed from under the weight
of a towel-horse, the tea-urn, the tea-tray, and the green baize
apron of the boot boy, which together with four red geraniums
from the landing, the pampas-grass from the drawing-room fireplace,
and the indiarubber plants from the drawing-room window were to
represent the fountains and garden of the last act. The applause
had died away.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Mabel, taking on herself the weight of the tea-urn,
"I wish those creatures we made were alive. We should get something
like applause then."</p>

<p>"I'm jolly glad they aren't," said Gerald, arranging the baize
and the towel-horse. "Brutes! It makes me feel quite silly when
I catch their paper eyes."</p>

<p>The curtains were drawn back. There lay the hearth-rug-coated
beast, in flat abandonment among the tropic beauties of the garden,
the pampas-grass shrubbery, the indiarubber plant bushes, the
geranium-trees and the urn fountain. Beauty was ready to make
her great entry in all the thrilling splendour of despair. And
then suddenly it all happened.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle began it: she applauded the garden scene&mdash;with hurried
little clappings of her quick French hands. Eliza's fat red palms
followed heavily, and then&mdash;some one else was clapping, six or
seven people, and their clapping made a dull padded sound. Nine
faces instead of two were turned towards the stage, and seven
out of the nine were painted, pointed paper faces. And every hand
and every face was alive. The applause grew louder as Mabel glided
forward, and as she paused and looked at the audience her unstudied
pose of horror and amazement drew forth applause louder still;
but it was not loud enough to drown the shrieks of Mademoiselle
and Eliza as they rushed from the room, knocking chairs over and
crushing each other in the doorway. Two distant doors banged,
Mademoiselle's door and Eliza's door.</p>

<p>"Curtain! curtain! quick!" cried Beauty-Mabel, in a voice that
wasn't Mabel's or the Beauty's. "Jerry&mdash;those things <em>have</em>
come alive. Oh, whatever <em>shall</em> we do?"</p>

<p>Gerald in his hearthrugs leaped to his feet. Again that flat
padded applause marked the swish of cloths on clothes-line as
Jimmy and Kathleen drew the curtains.</p>

<p>"What's up?" they asked as they drew.</p>

<p>"You've done it this time!" said Gerald to the pink, perspiring
Mabel. "Oh, bother these strings!"</p>

<p>"Can't you burst them? <em>I've</em> done it?" retorted Mabel.
"I like that!"</p>

<p>"More than I do," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," said Mabel, "Come on. We must go and pull
the things to pieces&mdash;then they <em>can't</em> go on being alive."</p>

<p>"It's your fault, anyhow," said Gerald with every possible absence
of gallantry. "Don't you see? It's turned into a wishing ring.
I <em>knew</em> something different was going to happen. Get my
knife out of my pocket&mdash;this string's in a knot. Jimmy, Cathy,
those Ugly-Wuglies have come alive&mdash;because Mabel wished it. Cut
out and pull them to pieces."</p>

<p>Jimmy and Cathy peeped through the curtain and recoiled with
white faces and staring eyes. "Not me!" was the brief rejoinder
of Jimmy. Cathy said, "Not much!" And she meant it, any one could
see that.</p>

<p>And now, as Gerald, almost free of the hearth-rugs, broke his
thumb-nail on the stiffest blade of his knife, a thick rustling
and a sharp, heavy stumping sounded beyond the curtain.</p>

<p>"They're going out!" screamed Kathleen&mdash;"<em>walking</em> out&mdash;on
their umbrella and broomstick legs. You can't stop them, Jerry,
they're too awful!"</p>

<p>"Everybody in the town'll be insane by to-morrow night if we
<em>don't</em> stop them," cried Gerald. "Here, give me the ring
&mdash;I'll unwish them."</p>

<p>[Illustration: A <em>LIMP HAND WAS LAID ON HIS ARM</em>.]</p>

<p>He caught the ring from the unresisting Mabel, cried, "I wish
the Uglies <em>weren't</em> alive," and tore through the door.
He saw, in fancy, Mabel's wish undone, and the empty hall strewed
with limp bolsters, hats, umbrellas, coats and gloves, prone abject
properties from which the brief life had gone out for ever. But
the hall was crowded with live things, strange things&mdash;all horribly
short as broomsticks and umbrellas are short. A limp hand gesticulated.
A pointed white face with red cheeks looked up at him, and wide
red lips said something, he could not tell what. The voice reminded
him of the old beggar down by the bridge who had no roof to his
mouth. These creatures had no roofs to their mouths, of course&mdash;they
had no<hr></p>

<p>"Aa oo ré o me me oo a oo ho el?" said the voice again. And it
had said it four times before Gerald could collect himself sufficiently
to understand that this horror&mdash;alive, and most likely quite uncontrollable&mdash;was
saying, with a dreadful calm, polite persistence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can you recommend me to a good hotel?"</p>
