I went to Australia to go into hospital and get tinkered up, after
which I planned to go on with the voyage.  And during the long
weeks I lay in hospital, from the first day I never missed
alcohol.  I never thought about it.  I knew I should have it again
when I was on my feet.  But when I regained my feet I was not
cured of my major afflictions.  Naaman's silvery skin was still
mine.  The mysterious sun-sickness, which the experts of Australia
could not fathom, still ripped and tore my tissues.  Malaria still
festered in me and put me on my back in shivering delirium at the
most unexpected moments, compelling me to cancel a double lecture
tour which had been arranged.
<P>
So I abandoned the Snark voyage and sought a cooler climate.  The
day I came out of hospital I took up drinking again as a matter of
course.  I drank wine at meals.  I drank cocktails before meals. 
I drank Scotch highballs when anybody I chanced to be with was
drinking them.  I was so thoroughly the master of John Barleycorn
I could take up with him or let go of him whenever I pleased, just
as I had done all my life.
<P>
After a time, for cooler climate, I went down to southermost
Tasmania in forty-three South.  And I found myself in a place
where there was nothing to drink.  It didn't mean anything.  I
didn't drink.  It was no hardship.  I soaked in the cool air, rode
horseback, and did my thousand words a day save when the fever
shock came in the morning.
<P>
And for fear that the idea may still lurk in some minds that my
preceding years of drinking were the cause of my disabilities, I
here point out that my Japanese cabin boy, Nakata, still with me,
was rotten with fever, as was Charmian, who in addition was in the
slough of a tropical neurasthenia that required several years of
temperate climates to cure, and that neither she nor Nakata drank
or ever had drunk.
<P>
When I returned to Hobart Town, where drink was obtainable, I
drank as of old.  The same when I arrived back in Australia.  On
the contrary, when I sailed from Australia on a tramp steamer
commanded by an abstemious captain, I took no drink along, and had
no drink for the forty-three days' passage.  Arrived in Ecuador,
squarely under the equatorial sun, where the humans were dying of
yellow fever, smallpox, and the plague, I promptly drank again--
every drink of every sort that had a kick in it.  I caught none of
these diseases.  Neither did Charmian nor Nakata who did not
drink.
<P>
Enamoured of the tropics, despite the damage done me, I stopped in
various places, and was a long while getting back to the splendid,
temperate climate of California.  I did my thousand words a day,
travelling or stopping over, suffered my last faint fever shock,
saw my silvery skin vanish and my sun-torn tissues healthily knit
again, and drank as a broad-shouldered chesty man may drink.
