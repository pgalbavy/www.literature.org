<p>To me, the fact of greatest interest about the Congo is that it is
owned, and the twenty millions of people who inhabit it are owned by
one man. The land and its people are his private property. I am not
trying to say that he governs the Congo. He does govern it, but that
in itself would not be of interest. His claim is that he owns it.
Though backed by all the mailed fists in the German Empire, and all
the <u>Dreadnoughts</u> of the seas, no other modern monarch would make
such a claim. It does not sound like anything we have heard since
the days and the ways of Pharaoh. And the most remarkable feature of
it is, that the man who makes this claim is the man who was placed
over the Congo as a guardian, to keep it open to the trade of the
world, to suppress slavery. That, in the Congo, he has killed trade
and made the products of the land his own, that of the natives he
did not kill he has made slaves, is what to-day gives the Congo its
chief interest. It is well to emphasize how this one man stole a
march on fourteen Powers, including the United States, and stole
also an empire of one million square miles.
</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago all of Africa was divided into many parts. The
part which still remained to be distributed among the Powers was
that which was watered by the Congo River and its tributaries.
</p><p>Along the north bank of the Congo River ran the French Congo; the
Portuguese owned the lands to the south, and on the east it was shut
in by protectorates and colonies of Germany and England. It was, and
is, a territory as large, were Spain and Russia omitted, as Europe.
Were a map of the Congo laid upon a map of Europe, with the mouth of
the Congo River where France and Spain meet at Biarritz, the
boundaries of the Congo would reach south to the heel of Italy, to
Greece, to Smyrna; east to Constantinople and Odessa; northeast to
St. Petersburg and Finland, and northwest to the extreme limits of
Scotland. Distances in this country are so enormous, the means of
progress so primitive, that many of the Belgian officers with whom I
came south and who already had travelled nineteen days from Antwerp,
had still, before they reached their posts, to steam, paddle, and
walk for three months.
</p><p>In 1844 to dispose amicably of this great territory, which was much
desired by several of the Powers, a conference was held at Berlin.
There it was decided to make of the Congo Basin an Independent
State, a "free-for-all" country, where every flag could trade with
equal right, and with no special tariff or restriction.
</p><p>The General Act of this conference agreed: "The trade of ALL nations
shall enjoy complete freedom." "No Power which exercises or shall
exercise Sovereign rights in the above-mentioned regions shall be
allowed to <u>grant therein a monopoly or favor of any kind in matters
of trade</u>." "ALL the Powers exercising Sovereign rights or influence
in the afore-said territories bind themselves to watch over the
preservation of the native tribes, and to care for the improvement
of <u>the condition of their moral and material welfare</u>, and <u>to
help in suppressing slavery</u>." The italics are mine. These
quotations from the act are still binding upon the fourteen Powers,
including the United States.
</p><p>For several years previous to the Conference of Berlin, Leopold of
Belgium, as a private individual, had shown much interest in the
development of the Congo. The opening up of that territory was
apparently his hobby. Out of his own pocket he paid for expeditions
into the Congo Basin, employed German and English explorers, and
protested against the then existing iniquities of the Arabs, who for
ivory and slaves raided the Upper Congo. Finally, assisted by many
geographical societies, he founded the International Association, to
promote "civilization and trade" in Central Africa; and enlisted
Henry M. Stanley in this service.
</p><p>That, in the early years, Leopold's interest in the Congo was
unselfish may or may not be granted, but, knowing him, as we now
know him, as one of the shrewdest and, of speculators, the most
unscrupulous, at the time of the Berlin Conference, his self-seeking
may safely be accepted. Quietly, unostentatiously, he presented
himself to its individual members as a candidate for the post of
administrator of this new territory.
</p><p>On the face of it he seemed an admirable choice. He was a sovereign
of a kingdom too unimportant to be feared; of the newly created
State he undoubtedly possessed an intimate knowledge. He promised to
give to the Dutch, English, and Portuguese traders, already for many
years established on the Congo, his heartiest aid, and, for those
traders still to come, to maintain the "open door." His professions
of a desire to help the natives were profuse. He became the
unanimous choice of the conference.
</p><p>Later he announced to the Powers signing the act, that from Belgium
he had received the right to assume the title of King of the
Independent State of the Congo. The Powers recognized his new title.
</p><p>The fact that Leopold, King of Belgium, was king also of the État
Indépendant du Congo confused many into thinking that the Free State
was a colony, or under the protection, of Belgium. As we have seen,
it is not. A Belgian may serve in the army of the Free State, or in
a civil capacity, as may a man of any nation, but, although with few
exceptions only Belgians are employed in the Free State, and
although to help the King in the Congo, the Belgian Government has
loaned him great sums of money, politically and constitutionally the
two governments are as independent of each other as France and
Spain.
</p><p>And so, in 1885, Leopold, by the grace of fourteen governments, was
appointed their steward over a great estate in which each of the
governments still holds an equal right; a trustee and keeper over
twenty millions of "black brothers" whose "moral and material
welfare" each government had promised to protect.
</p><p>There is only one thing more remarkable than the fact that Leopold
was able to turn this public market into a private park, and that
is, that he has been permitted to do so. It is true he is a man of
wonderful ability. For his own ends he is a magnificent organizer.
But in the fourteen governments that created him there have been,
and to-day there are, men, if less unscrupulous, of quite as great
ability; statesmen, jealous and quick to guard the rights of the
people they represent, people who since the twelfth century have
been traders, who since 1808 have declared slavery abolished.
</p><p>And yet, for twenty-five years these statesmen have watched Leopold
disobey every provision in the act of the conference. Were they to
visit the Congo, they could see for themselves the jungle creeping
in and burying their trading posts, their great factories turned
into barracks. They know that the blacks they mutually agreed to
protect have been reduced to slavery worse than that they suffered
from the Arabs, that hundreds of thousands of them have fled from
the Congo, and that those that remain have been mutilated, maimed,
or, what was more merciful, murdered. And yet the fourteen
governments, including the United States, have done nothing.
</p><p>Some tell you they do not interfere because they are jealous one of
the other; others say that it is because they believe the Congo will
soon be taken over by Belgium, and with Belgium in control, they
argue, they would be dealing with a responsible government, instead
of with a pirate. But so long as Leopold is King of Belgium one
doubts if Belgians in the Congo would rise above the level of their
King. The English, when asked why they do not assert their rights,
granted not only to them, but to thirteen other governments, reply
that if they did they would be accused of "ulterior motives." What
ulterior motives? If you pursue a pickpocket and recover your watch
from him, are your motives in doing so open to suspicion?
</p><p>Personally, although this is looking some way ahead, I would like to
see the English take over and administrate the Congo. Wherever I
visit a colony governed by Englishmen I find under their
administration, in spite of opium in China and gin on the West
Coast, that three people are benefited: the Englishman, the native,
and the foreign trader from any other part of the world. Of the
colonies of what other country can one say the same?
</p><p>As a rule our present governments are not loath to protect their
rights. But toward asserting them in the Congo they have been moved
neither by the protests of traders, chambers of commerce,
missionaries, the public press, nor by the cry of the black man to
"let my people go." By only those in high places can it be
explained. We will leave it as a curious fact, and return to the
"Unjust Steward."
</p><p>His first act was to wage wars upon the Arabs. From the Soudan and
from the East Coast they were raiding the Congo for slaves and
ivory, and he drove them from it. By these wars he accomplished two
things. As the defender of the slave, he gained much public credit,
and he kept the ivory. But war is expensive, and soon he pointed out
to the Powers that to ask him out of his own pocket to maintain
armies in the field and to administer a great estate was unfair. He
humbly sought their permission to levy a few taxes. It seemed a
reasonable request. To clear roads, to keep boats upon the great
rivers, to mark it with buoys, to maintain wood stations for the
steamers, to improve the "moral and material welfare of the
natives," would cost money, and to allow Leopold to bring about
these improvements, which would be for the good of all, he was
permitted to levy the few taxes. That was twenty years ago; to-day I
saw none of these improvements, and the taxes have increased.
</p><p>From the first they were so heavy that the great trade houses, which
for one hundred years in peace and mutual goodwill bartered with the
natives, found themselves ruined. It was not alone the export taxes,
lighterage dues, port dues, and personal taxes that drove them out
of the Congo; it was the King appearing against them as a rival
trader, the man appointed to maintain the "open door." And a trader
with methods they could not or would not imitate. Leopold, or the
"State," saw for the existence of the Congo only two reasons: Rubber
and Ivory. And the collecting of this rubber and ivory was, as he
saw it, the sole duty of the State and its officers. When he threw
over the part of trustee and became the Arab raider he could not
waste his time, which, he had good reason to fear, might be short,
upon products that, if fostered, would be of value only in later
years. Still less time had he to give to improvements that cost
money and that would be of benefit to his successors. He wanted only
rubber; he wanted it at once, and he cared not at all how he
obtained it. So he spun, and still spins, the greatest of all
"get-rich-quick" schemes; one of gigantic proportions, full of
tragic, monstrous, nauseous details.
</p><p>The only possible way to obtain rubber is through the native; as
yet, in teeming forests, the white man can not work and live. Of
even Chinese coolies imported here to build a railroad ninety per
cent. died. So, with a stroke of the pen, Leopold declared all the
rubber in the country the property of the "State," and then, to make
sure that the natives would work it, ordered that taxes be paid in
rubber. If, once a month (in order to keep the natives steadily at
work the taxes were ordered to be paid each month instead of once a
year), each village did not bring in so many baskets of rubber the
King's cannibal soldiers raided it, carried off the women as
hostages, and made prisoners of the men, or killed and ate them. For
every kilo of rubber brought in in excess of the quota the King's
agent, who received the collected rubber and forwarded it down the
river, was paid a commission. Or was "paid by results." Another
bonus was given him based on the price at which he obtained the
rubber. If he paid the native only six cents for every two pounds,
he received a bonus of three cents, the cost to the State being but
nine cents per kilo, but, if he paid the natives twelve cents for
every two pounds, he received as a bonus less than one cent. In a
word, the more rubber the agent collected the more he personally
benefited, and if he obtained it "cheaply" or for nothing--that is,
by taking hostages, making prisoners, by the whip of hippopotamus
hide, by torture--so much greater his fortune, so much richer
Leopold.
</p><p> [Illustration: A Village on the Kasai River.]
</p><p>Few schemes devised have been more cynical, more devilish, more
cunningly designed to incite a man to cruelty and abuse. To
dishonesty it was an invitation and a reward. It was this system of
"payment by results," evolved by Leopold sooner than allow his
agents a fixed and sufficient wage, that led to the atrocities.
</p><p>One result of this system was that in seven years the natives
condemned to slavery in the rubber forests brought in rubber to the
amount of fifty-five millions of dollars. But its chief results were
the destruction of entire villages, the flight from their homes in
the Congo of hundreds of thousands of natives, and for those that
remained misery, death, the most brutal tortures and degradations,
unprintable, unthinkable.
</p><p>I am not going to enter into the question of the atrocities. In the
Congo the tip has been given out from those higher up at Brussels to
"close up" the atrocities; and for the present the evil places in
the Tenderloin and along the Broadway of the Congo are tightly shut.
But at those lonely posts, distant a month to three months' march
from the capital, the cruelties still continue. I did not see them.
Neither, last year, did a great many people in the United States see
the massacre of blacks in Atlanta. But they have reason to believe
it occurred. And after one has talked with the men and women who
have seen the atrocities, has seen in the official reports that
those accused of the atrocities do not deny having committed them,
but point out that they were merely obeying orders, and after one
has seen that even at the capital of Boma all the conditions of
slavery exist, one is assured that in the jungle, away from the
sight of men, all things are possible. Merchants, missionaries, and
officials even in Leopold's service told me that if one could spare
a year and a half, or a year, to the work in the hinterland he would
be an eye-witness of as cruel treatment of the natives as any that
has gone before, and if I can trust myself to weigh testimony and
can believe my eyes and ears I have reason to know that what they
say is true. I am convinced that to-day a man, who feels that a year
and a half is little enough to give to the aid of twenty millions of
human beings, can accomplish in the Congo as great and good work as
that of the Abolitionists.
</p><p>Three years ago atrocities here were open and above-board. For
instance. In the opinion of the State the soldiers, in killing game
for food, wasted the State cartridges, and in consequence the
soldiers, to show their officers that they did not expend the
cartridges extravagantly on antelope and wild boar, for each empty
cartridge brought in a human hand, the hand of a man, woman, or
child. These hands, drying in the sun, could be seen at the posts
along the river. They are no longer in evidence. Neither is the
flower-bed of Lieutenant Dom, which was bordered with human skulls.
A quaint conceit.
</p><p>The man to blame for the atrocities, for each separate atrocity, is
Leopold. Had he shaken his head they would have ceased. When the hue
and cry in Europe grew too hot for him and he held up his hand they
did cease. At least along the main waterways. Years before he could
have stopped them. But these were the seven fallow years, when
millions of tons of red rubber were being dumped upon the wharf at
Antwerp; little, roughly rolled red balls, like pellets of
coagulated blood, which had cost their weight in blood, which would
pay Leopold their weight in gold.
</p><p>He can not plead ignorance. Of all that goes on in his big
plantation no man has a better knowledge. Without their personal
honesty, he follows every detail of the "business" of his rubber
farm with the same diligence that made rich men of George Boldt and
Marshall Field. Leopold's knowledge is gained through many spies, by
voluminous reports, by following up the expenditure of each centime,
of each arm's-length of blue cloth. Of every Belgian employed on
his farm, and ninety-five per cent. are Belgians, he holds the
<u>dossier</u>; he knows how many kilos a month the agent whips out of
his villages, how many bottles of absinthe he smuggles from the
French side, whether he lives with one black woman or five, why his
white wife in Belgium left him, why he left Belgium, why he dare not
return. The agent knows that Leopold, King of the Belgians, knows,
and that he has shared that knowledge with the agent's employer, the
man who by bribes of rich bonuses incites him to crime, the man who
could throw him into a Belgian jail, Leopold, King of the Congo.
</p><p>The agent decides for him it is best to please both Leopolds, and
Leopold makes no secret of what best pleases him. For not only is he
responsible for the atrocities, in that he does not try to suppress
them, but he is doubly guilty in that he has encouraged them. This
he has done with cynical, callous publicity, without effort at
concealment, without shame. Men who, in obtaining rubber, committed
unspeakable crimes, the memory of which makes other men
uncomfortable in their presence, Leopold rewarded with rich
bonuses, pensions, higher office, gilt badges of shame, and rapid
advancement. To those whom even his own judges sentenced to many
years' imprisonment he promptly granted the royal pardon, promoted,
and sent back to work in the vineyard.
</p><p>"That is the sort of man for <u>me</u>," his action seemed to say. "See
how I value that good and faithful servant. That man collected much
rubber. You observe I do not ask how he got it. I will not ask you.
All you need do is to collect rubber. Use our improved methods. Gum
copal rubbed in the kinky hair of the chief and then set on fire
burns, so my agents tell me, like vitriol. For collecting rubber the
chief is no longer valuable, but to his successor it is an
object-lesson. Let me recommend also the <u>chicotte</u>, the torture
tower, the 'hostage' house, and the crucifix. Many other stimulants
to labor will no doubt suggest themselves to you and to your
cannibal 'sentries.' Help to make me rich, and don't fear the
'State.' '_L'Etat, c'est moi!_' Go as far as you like!"
</p><p>I said the degradations and tortures practised by the men "working
on commission" for Leopold are unprintable, but they have been
printed, and those who wish to read a calmly compiled, careful, and
correct record of their deeds will find it in the "Red Rubber" of
Mr. E.R. Morel. An even better book by the same authority, on the
whole history of the State, is his "King Leopold's Rule in the
Congo." Mr. Morel has many enemies. So, early in the nineteenth
century, had the English Abolitionists, Wilberforce and Granville
Sharp. After they were dead they were buried in the Abbey, and their
portraits were placed in the National Gallery. People who wish to
assist in freeing twenty millions of human beings should to-day
support Mr. Morel. It will be of more service to the blacks than,
after he is dead, burying him in Westminster Abbey.
</p><p>Mr. Morel, the American and English missionaries, and the English
Consul, Roger Casement, and other men, in Belgium, have made a
magnificent fight against Leopold; but the Powers to whom they have
appealed have been silent. Taking courage of this silence, Leopold
has divided the Congo into several great territories in which the
sole right to work rubber is conceded to certain persons. To those
who protested that no one in the Congo "Free" State but the King
could trade in rubber, Leopold, as an answer, pointed with pride at
the preserves of these foreigners. And he may well point at them
with pride, for in some of those companies he owns a third, and in
most of them he holds a half, or a controlling interest. The
directors of the foreign companies are his cronies, members of his
royal household, his brokers, bankers. You have only to read the
names published in the lists of the Brussels Stock Exchange to see
that these "trading companies," under different aliases, are
Leopold. Having, then, "conceded" the greater part of the Congo to
himself, Leopold set aside the best part of it, so far as rubber is
concerned, as a _Domaine Privé_. Officially the receipts of this pay
for running the government, and for schools, roads and wharfs, for
which taxes were levied, but for which, after twenty years, one
looks in vain. Leopold claims that through the Congo he is out of
pocket; that this carrying the banner of civilization in Africa
does not pay. Through his press bureaus he tells that his sympathy
for his black brother, his desire to see the commerce of the world
busy along the Congo, alone prevents him giving up what is for him a
losing business. There are several answers to this. One is that in
the Kasai Company alone Leopold owns 2,010 shares of stock. Worth
originally $50 a share, the value of each share rose to $3,100,
making at one time his total shares worth $5,421,000. In the
A.B.I.R. Concession he owns 1,000 shares, originally worth $100
each, later worth $940. In the "vintage year" of 1900 each of these
shares was worth $5,050, and the 1,000 shares thus rose to the value
of $5,050,000.
</p><p>These are only two companies. In most of the others half the shares
are owned by the King.
</p><p>As published in the "State Bulletin," the money received in eight
years for rubber and ivory gathered in the _Domaine Privé_ differs
from the amount given for it in the market at Antwerp. The official
estimates show a loss to the government. The actual sales show that
the government, over and above its own estimate of its expenses,
instead of losing, made from the _Domaine Privé_ alone $10,000,000.
We are left wondering to whom went that unaccounted-for $10,000,000.
Certainly the King would not take it, for, to reimburse himself for
his efforts, he early in the game reserved for himself another tract
of territory known as the <u>Domaine de la Couronne</u>. For years he
denied that this existed. He knew nothing of Crown Lands. But, at
last, in the Belgian Chamber, it was publicly charged that for years
from this private source, which he had said did not exist, Leopold
had been drawing an income of $15,000,000. Since then the truth of
this statement has been denied, but at the time in the Chamber it
was not contradicted.
</p><p>To-day, grown insolent by the apathy of the Powers, Leopold finds
disguising himself as a company, as a laborer worthy of his hire,
irksome. He now decrees that as "Sovereign" over the Congo all of
the Congo belongs to him. It is as much his property as is a
pheasant drive, as is a staked-out mining claim, as your hat is your
property. And the twenty millions of people who inhabit it are there
only on his sufferance. They are his "tenants." He permits each
the hut in which he lives, and the garden adjoining that hut, but
his work must be for Leopold, and everything else, animal, mineral,
or vegetable, belongs to Leopold. The natives not only may not sell
ivory or rubber to independent traders, but if it is found in their
possession it is seized; and if you and I bought a tusk of ivory
here it would be taken from us and we could be prosecuted. This is
the law. Other men rule over territories more vast even than the
Congo. The King of England rules an empire upon which the sun never
sets. But he makes no claim to own it. Against the wishes of even
the humblest crofter, the King would not, because he knows he could
not, enter his cottage. Nor can we imagine even Kaiser William going
into the palm-leaf hut of a charcoal-burner in German East Africa
and saying: "This is my palm-leaf hut. This is my charcoal. You must
not sell it to the English, or the French, or the American. If they
buy from you they are 'receivers of stolen goods.' To feed my
soldiers you must drag my river for my fish. For me, in my swamp and
in my jungle, you must toil twenty-four days of each month to
gather my rubber. You must not hunt the elephants, for they are my
elephants. Those tusks that fifty years ago your grandfather, with
his naked spear, cut from an elephant, and which you have tried to
hide from me under the floor of this hut, are my ivory. Because that
elephant, running wild through the jungle fifty years ago, belonged
to me. And you yourself are mine, your time is mine, your labor is
mine, your wife, your children, all are mine. They belong to me."
</p><p> [Illustration: "Tenants" of Leopold, Who Claims that the Congo
 Belongs to Him, and that These Native People Are There Only as His
 Tenants.]
</p><p>This, then, is the "open door" as I find it to-day in the Congo. It
is an incredible state of affairs, so insolent, so magnificent in
its impertinence, that it would be humorous, were it not for its
background of misery and suffering, for its hostage houses, its
chain gangs, its <u>chicottes</u>, its nameless crimes against the human
body, its baskets of dried hands held up in tribute to the Belgian
blackguard.
