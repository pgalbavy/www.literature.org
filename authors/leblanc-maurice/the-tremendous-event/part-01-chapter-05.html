<p>It was hardly later than one o'clock in the morning. The storm was
less furious and the squalls had ceased, so that Simon suddenly began
to walk as quickly as the trifling obstacles over which he stumbled
and the dim light of the sky would permit. For that matter, if he
branched off too far in either direction, the nearer sound of the
waves would serve as a warning.
</p><p>In this way he passed Dieppe and followed a direction which, while it
varied by reason of curves and sudden turns, nevertheless, in his
opinion, ran parallel with the Norman coast. During the whole of this
first stage of his journey, he was only half-aware of what he was
doing and had no thought but of making headway, feeling certain that
his explorations would be interrupted from one minute to the next. It
did not seem to him that he was penetrating into unlimited regions,
but rather that he was really persistently pushing towards a goal
which was close at hand, but which receded so soon as he approached it
and which was no other than the extreme point of this miraculous
peninsula.
</p><p>"There," he said to himself. "There it is. I've got there. The new
ground goes as far as that. . . ."
</p><p>But the new ground continued to stretch into the darkness; and a
little later he repeated:
</p><p>"It's over there. The line of breakers is closing up. I can see it."
</p><p>But the line opened out, leaving a passage by which Simon pursued his
way.
</p><p>Two o'clock. . . . Half-past two. . . . Sometimes the water was up to
his knees, sometimes his feet sank into a bed of thicker sand. These
were the low-lying parts, the valleys of the peninsula; and there
might perhaps be some, thought Simon where these beds would be deep
enough to bar his passage. He went on all the more briskly. Ascents
rose in front of him, leading him to mounds forty or fifty feet in
height, whose farther slopes he descended rapidly. And, lost in the
immensity of the sea, imprisoned by it, absorbed by it, he had the
illusion that he was running over its surface, along the back of great
frozen, motionless waves.
</p><p>He halted. Before him a speck of light had crossed the darkness, a
long, a very long way off. Four times he saw the flame reappear at
regular intervals. Fifteen seconds later came a fresh series of
flashes, followed by a similar interval of darkness.
</p><p>"A light-house!" murmured Simon. "A light-house which the disaster has
spared!"
</p><p>Just here the embankment ran in the direction of the light-house; and
Simon calculated that it would thus end at Tréport, or perhaps farther
north, if the light-house marked the estuary of the Somme, which was
highly probable. In that case he would have to walk four or five hours
longer, at the same swift pace.
</p><p>But he lost the intermittent gleams as suddenly as he had caught sight
of them. He looked and failed to find them and felt overwhelmed, as
though, after the death of these little twinkling flames, he could no
longer hope ever to escape from the heavy darkness which was stifling
him or to discover the tremendous secret in pursuit of which he had
darted. What was he doing? Where was he? What did it all mean? What
was the use of making such efforts?
</p><p>"Forward!" he cried. "At the double! and we don't do any more
thinking. I shall understand presently, when I get there. Until then,
it's a matter of going on and on, like a beast of burden."
</p><p>He spoke aloud, to shake off his drowsiness. And, as a protest against
a weakness of which he was ashamed, he set off at a run.
</p><p>It was a quarter past three. In the keener air of the morning he was
conscious of a sense of well-being. Moreover, he noticed that the
obscurity around him was becoming lighter and was gradually lifting
like a mist.
</p><p>The first glimmer of dawn appeared. The day broke quickly and at last
the new land was visible to Simon's eyes, grey, as he had supposed,
and yellower in places, with streaks of sand and hollows filled with
water in which all sorts of fish were seen struggling or dying, with a
whole galaxy of little islands and irregular shoals, beaches of fine,
close-packed gravel, tracts of sea-weed and gentle undulations, like
those of a rich plain.
</p><p>And in the midst of it all there was ever a multitude of objects whose
real shape could no longer be distinguished, remnants enlarged and
swollen by the addition of everything that could be encrusted or
fastened on them, or else eaten away, worn out, corroded, or
disintegrated by everything that helps to dissolve or to destroy.
</p><p>They were flotsam and jetsam of all kinds. Past counting, glistening
with slime, of all types and of all materials, of an age to be
reckoned in months or years, it might be in centuries, they bore
witness to the unbroken procession of thousands and thousands of
wrecks. And, as many as were these remnants of wood and iron, so many
were the human lives engulfed in companies of tens and hundreds.
Youth, health, wealth, hope: each wreck represented the destruction of
all their dreams, of all their realities; and each also recalled the
distress of the living, the mourning of mothers and wives.
</p><p>And the field of death stretched away indefinitely, an immense, tragic
cemetery, such as the earth had never known, with endless lines of
graves, tombstones and funeral monuments. To the right and left there
was nothing, nothing but a dense fog rising from the water, hiding the
horizon as completely as the veils of night and making it impossible
for Simon to see more than a hundred yards in front of him. But from
this fog new land-formations continued to emerge; and this seemed to
him to fall so strictly within the domain of the fabulous and the
incredible that he easily imagined them to be rising from the depths
on his approach and assuming form and substance to offer him a
passage.
</p><p>A little after four o'clock there was a return of the gale, an
offensive of ugly clouds emitting volleys of rain and hail. The wind
made a gap in the clouds, which it drove north and south, and then, on
Simon's right, parallel with a belt of rosy light which divided the
waves from the black sky, the coast-line became visible.
</p><p>It was a vaguely defined line which might have been taken for a fine
streak of motionless clouds; but he knew its general appearance so
well that he did not hesitate for a moment. It was the cliffs of the
Seine-Inférieurs and the Somme, between Le Tréport and Cayeux.
</p><p>He rested for a few minutes; then, to lighten his outfit, he pulled
off his boots, which were too heavy, and his leather jacket, which was
making him too hot. Then taking his father's wallet out of the jacket,
he found in one of the pockets two biscuits and a stick of chocolate
which he himself had put there, so to speak, unwittingly.
</p><p>After making a meal of these, he set out again briskly, not with the
cautious gait of an explorer who does not know whither he is going and
who measures his efforts, but at the pace of an athlete who has fixed
his time-table and keeps to it in spite of obstacles and difficulties.
A strange light-heartedness uplifted him. He was glad to expend so
much of the force which he had been storing for all these years and to
expend it on a task of which he knew nothing, but of which he felt the
exceptional greatness. His elbows were well tucked in and his head
thrown back. His bare feet marked the sand with a faint trail. The
wind bathed his face and played in and out of his hair. What joy!
</p><p>He kept up his pace for nearly four hours. Why should he hold himself
in? He was always expecting the new formation to change its direction
and, bending suddenly to the right, to join the coast of the Somme.
And he went forward in all confidence.
</p><p>At certain points, progress became arduous. The sea had got up; and
here and there the waves, rushing over those places where the sand,
though clear of the water, was unprotected by a barrier of rocks,
formed in the narrower portions actual rivers, flowing from one side
to the other, which Simon had to wade, almost knee-deep in water.
Moreover, he had taken so little food that he began to be racked with
hunger. He had to slow down. And another hour went by.
</p><p>The great squalls had blown over. The returning sea-fogs seemed to
have deadened the wind and were now closing in on him again. Once more
Simon was walking through moving clouds which concealed his path from
him. Less sure of himself, attacked by a sudden sense of loneliness
and distress, he soon experienced a lassitude to which he was
unwilling to surrender.
</p><p>This was a mistake. He recognized the fact: nevertheless, he struggled
on as though in fulfillment of the most imperious duty. With an
obstinate ring in his voice, he gave himself his orders:
</p><p>"Forward: Ten minutes more! . . . You must! . . . And, once more, ten
minutes!"
</p><p>On either side lay things which, in any other circumstances, would
have held his attention. An iron chest, three old guns, small-arms,
cannon-balls, a submarine. Enormous fish lay stranded on the sand.
Sometimes a white sea-gull circled through space.
</p><p>And so he came to a great wreck whose state of preservation betrayed
a recent disaster. It was an overturned steamer, with her keel deeply
buried in a sandy hollow, while her black stern stood erect,
displaying a broad pink stripe on which Simon read:
</p><p>"The <u>Bonne Vierge</u>. Calais."
</p><p>And he remembered. The <u>Bonne Vierge</u> was one of the two boats whose
loss had been announced in the telegrams posted up at Newhaven.
Employed in the coasting-trade between the north and west of France,
she had sunk at a spot which lay in a direct line between Calais and
Le Havre; and Simon saw in this a positive proof that he was still
following the French coast, passing those seamarks whose names he now
recalled: the Ridin de Dieppe, the Bassure de Baas, the Vergoyer and
so on.
</p><p>It was ten o'clock in the morning. From the average pace which he had
maintained, allowing for deviation and for hilly ground, Simon
calculated that he had covered a distance of nearly forty miles as the
crow flies and that he ought to find himself approximately on a level
with Le Touquet.
</p><p>"What am I risking if I push on?" he asked himself. "At most I should
have to do another forty miles to pass through the Straits of Dover
and come out into the North Sea . . . in which case my position would
be none too cheerful. But it will be devilish odd if, between this and
that, I don't touch land somewhere. The only trouble is, whether it's
forty miles on or forty miles back, those things can't be done on an
empty stomach."
</p><p>Fortunately, for he was feeling symptoms of a fatigue to which he was
unaccustomed, the problem solved itself without his assistance. After
going round the wreck, he managed to crawl under the poop and there
discovered a heap of packing-cases which evidently formed part of the
cargo. All were more or less split or broken or gaping at the corners.
But one of them, whose lid Simon had no difficulty in prying open,
contained tins of syrup, bottles of wine and stacks of canned foods:
meat, fish, vegetables and fruits.
</p><p>"Splendid!" he said, laughing. "Luncheon is served, sir. On top of
that, a little rest; and the sooner I'm off the better!"
</p><p>He made an excellent lunch; and a long siesta, under the vessel, among
the packing-cases, restored his strength completely. When he woke and
saw that his watch was already pointing to noon, he felt uneasy at the
waste of time and suddenly reflected that others must have taken the
same path and would now be able to catch him up and outstrip him. And
he did not intend this to happen. Accordingly, feeling as fit as at
the moment of starting, provided with the indispensable provisions and
determined to follow up the adventure to the very end, without a
companion to share his glory or to rob him of it, he set off again at
a very brisk, unflagging pace.
</p><p>"I shall get there," he thought, "I mean to get there. All this is an
unprecedented phenomenon, the creation of a tract of land which will
utterly change the conditions of life in this part of the world. I
mean to be there first and to see . . . to see what? I don't know,
<u>but I mean to do it</u>."
</p><p>What rapture to tread a soil on which no one has ever set foot! Men
travel in search of this rapture to the utmost ends of the earth, to
remote countries, no matter where; and very often the secret is hardly
worth discovering. As for Simon, he was having his wonderful adventure
in the heart of the oldest regions of old Europe. The Channel! The
French coast! To be treading virgin soil here, of all places, where
mankind had lived for three or four thousand years! To behold sights
that no other eye had ever looked upon! To come after the Gauls, the
Romans, the Franks, the Anglo-Saxons and to be the first to pass! To
be the first to pass this way, ahead of the millions and millions of
men who would follow in his track, on the new path which he would have
inaugurated!
</p><p>One o'clock. . . . Half-past one. . . . More ridges of sand, more
wrecks. Always that curtain of clouds. And always Simon's lingering
impression of a goal which eluded him. The tide, still low, was
leaving a greater number of islands uncovered. The waves were breaking
far out to sea and rolling across wide sand-banks as though the new
land had widened considerably.
</p><p>About two o'clock in the afternoon, he came upon higher undulations
followed by a series of sandy flats in which his feet sank to a
greater depth than usual. Absorbed by the dreary spectacle of a ship's
mast protruding from the sand, with its tattered and coloured flag
flopping in the wind, he pressed on all unsuspecting. In a few
minutes, the sand was up to his knees, then half-way up his thighs. He
laughed, still unheeding.
</p><p>In the end, however, unable to advance, he tried to return: his
efforts were useless. He attempted to lift his legs by treading, as
though climbing a flight of stairs, but he could not. He brought his
hands into play, laying them flat on the sands: they too went under.
</p><p>Then he broke into a flood of perspiration. He suddenly understood the
hideous truth: he was caught in a quicksand.
</p><p>It was soon over. He did not sink with the slowness that lends a
little hope to the agony of despair. Simon fell, so to speak, into a
void. His hips, his waist, his chest disappeared. His outstretched
arms checked his descent for a moment. He stiffened his body, he
struggled. In vain. The sand rose like water to his shoulders, to his
neck.
</p><p>He began to shout. But in the immensity of these solitudes, to whom
was his appeal addressed? Nothing could save him from the most
horrible of deaths. Then it was that he shut his eyes and with
clenched lips sealed his mouth, which was already full of the taste of
the sand, and, in a fit of terror, he gave himself up for lost.
