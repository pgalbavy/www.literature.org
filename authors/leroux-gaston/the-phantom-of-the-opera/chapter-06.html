<p>We left M. Firmin Richard and M. Armand Moncharmin at the moment
when they were deciding "to look into that little matter of Box
Five."</p>

<p>Leaving behind them the broad staircase which leads from the
lobby outside the managers' offices to the stage and its dependencies,
they crossed the stage, went out by the subscribers' door and
entered the house through the first little passage on the left. 
Then they made their way through the front rows of stalls and
looked at Box Five on the grand tier, They could not see it well,
because it was half in darkness and because great covers were
flung over the red velvet of the ledges of all the boxes.</p>

<p>They were almost alone in the huge, gloomy house; and a great
silence surrounded them.  It was the time when most of the stage-hands
go out for a drink.  The staff had left the boards for the moment,
leaving a scene half set.  A few rays of light, a wan, sinister
light, that seemed to have been stolen from an expiring luminary,
fell through some opening or other upon an old tower that raised
its pasteboard battlements on the stage; everything, in this deceptive
light, adopted a fantastic shape.  In the orchestra stalls, the
drugget covering them looked like an angry sea, whose glaucous
waves had been suddenly rendered stationary by a secret order
from the storm phantom, who, as everybody knows, is called Adamastor. 
<em>MM. </em>Moncharmin and Richard were the shipwrecked mariners
amid this motionless turmoil of a calico sea. They made for the
left boxes, plowing their way like sailors who leave their ship
and try to struggle to the shore.  The eight great polished columns
stood up in the dusk like so many huge piles supporting the threatening,
crumbling, big-bellied cliffs whose layers were represented by
the circular, parallel, waving lines of the balconies of the grand,
first and second tiers of boxes.  At the top, right on top of
the cliff, lost in M. Lenepveu's copper ceiling, figures grinned
and grimaced, laughed and jeered at <em>MM. </em>Richard and Moncharmin's
distress. And yet these figures were usually very serious.  Their
names were Isis, Amphitrite, Hebe, Pandora, Psyche, Thetis, Pomona,
Daphne, Clytie, Galatea and Arethusa.  Yes, Arethusa herself and
Pandora, whom we all know by her box, looked down upon the two
new managers of the Opera, who ended by clutching at some piece
of wreckage and from there stared silently at Box Five on the
grand tier.</p>

<p>I have said that they were distressed.  At least, I presume so. 
M. Moncharmin, in any case, admits that he was impressed.  To
quote his own words, in his Memoirs:</p>

<p>"This moonshine about the Opera ghost in which, since we first
took over the duties of <em>MM. </em>Poligny and Debienne, we
had been so nicely steeped" &mdash;Moncharmin's style is not always
irreproachable&mdash;"had no doubt ended by blinding my imaginative
and also my visual faculties. It may be that the exceptional surroundings
in which we found ourselves, in the midst of an incredible silence,
impressed us to an unusual extent.  It may be that we were the
sport of a kind of hallucination brought about by the semi-darkness
of the theater and the partial gloom that filled Box Five.  At
any rate, I saw and Richard also saw a shape in the box.  Richard
said nothing, nor I either.  But we spontaneously seized each
other's hand.  We stood like that for some minutes, without moving,
with our eyes fixed on the same point; but the figure had disappeared. 
Then we went out and, in the lobby, communicated our impressions
to each other and talked about 'the shape.'  The misfortune was
that my shape was not in the least like Richard's. I had seen
a thing like a death's head resting on the ledge of the box, whereas
Richard saw the shape of an old woman who looked like Mme. Giry. 
We soon discovered that we had really been the victims of an illusion,
whereupon, without further delay and laughing like madmen, we
ran to Box Five on the grand tier, went inside and found no shape
of any kind."</p>

<p>Box Five is just like all the other grand tier boxes.  There
is nothing to distinguish it from any of the others.  M. Moncharmin
and M. Richard, ostensibly highly amused and laughing at each
other, moved the furniture of the box, lifted the cloths and the
chairs and particularly examined the arm-chair in which "the man's
voice" used to sit.  But they saw that it was a respectable arm-chair,
with no magic about it. Altogether, the box was the most ordinary
box in the world, with its red hangings, its chairs, its carpet
and its ledge covered in red velvet.  After, feeling the carpet
in the most serious manner possible, and discovering nothing more
here or anywhere else, they went down to the corresponding box
on the pit tier below.  In Box Five on the pit tier, which is
just inside the first exit from the stalls on the left, they found
nothing worth mentioning either.</p>

<p>"Those people are all making fools of us!"  Firmin Richard ended
by exclaiming.  "It will be <em>FAUST </em>on Saturday:  let us
both see the performance from Box Five on the grand tier!"</p>
