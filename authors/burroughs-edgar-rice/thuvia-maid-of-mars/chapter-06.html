The girl looked her incredulity.
<P>
"They lay in piles," she murmured.  "There were thousands
of them but a minute ago."
<P>
"And now," continued Carthoris, "there remain but the
banths and the carcasses of the green men."
<P>
"They must have sent forth and carried the dead bowmen
away while we were talking," said the girl.
<P>
"It is impossible!" replied Carthoris.  "Thousands of
dead lay there upon the field but a moment since.  It would
have required many hours to have removed them.  The
thing is uncanny."
<P>
"I had hoped," said Thuvia, "that we might find an
asylum with these fair-skinned people.  Notwithstanding
their valour upon the field of battle, they did not strike
me as a ferocious or warlike people.  I had been about
to suggest that we seek entrance to the city, but now I
scarce know if I care to venture among people whose
dead vanish into thin air."
<P>
"Let us chance it," replied Carthoris.  "We can be no
worse off within their walls than without.  Here we may
fall prey to the banths or the no less fierce Torquasians.
There, at least, we shall find beings moulded after
our own images.
<P>
"All that causes me to hesitate," he added, "is the
danger of taking you past so many banths.  A single
sword would scarce prevail were even a couple of
them to charge simultaneously."
<P>
"Do not fear on that score," replied the girl, smiling.
"The banths will not harm us."
<P>
As she spoke she descended from the platform, and
with Carthoris at her side stepped fearlessly out upon the
bloody field in the direction of the walled city of mystery.
<P>
They had advanced but a short distance when a banth,
looking up from its gory feast, descried them.  With an
angry roar the beast walked quickly in their direction,
and at the sound of its voice a score of others followed
its example.
<P>
Carthoris drew his long-sword.  The girl stole a quick
glance at his face.  She saw the smile upon his lips,
and it was as wine to sick nerves; for even upon warlike
Barsoom where all men are brave, woman reacts quickly to
quiet indifference to danger--to dare-deviltry that is
without bombast.
<P>
"You may return your sword," she said.  "I told you
that the banths would not harm us.  Look!" and as she
spoke she stepped quickly toward the nearest animal.
<P>
Carthoris would have leaped after her to protect her,
but with a gesture she motioned him back.  He heard her
calling to the banths in a low, singsong voice that
was half purr.
<P>
Instantly the great heads went up and all the
wicked eyes were riveted upon the figure of the girl.
Then, stealthily, they commenced moving toward her.
She had stopped now and was standing waiting them.
<P>
One, closer to her than the others, hesitated.  She spoke to
him imperiously, as a master might speak to a refractory hound.
<P>
The great carnivore let its head droop, and with tail
between its legs came slinking to the girl's feet,
and after it came the others until she was entirely
surrounded by the savage maneaters.
<P>
Turning she led them to where Carthoris stood.
They growled a little as they neared the man, but a
few sharp words of command put them in their places.
<P>
"How do you do it?" exclaimed Carthoris.
<P>
"Your father once asked me that same question in the
galleries of the Golden Cliffs within the Otz Mountains,
beneath the temples of the therns.  I could not answer him,
nor can I answer you.  I do not know whence comes my power
over them, but ever since the day that Sator Throg threw
me among them in the banth pit of the Holy Therns,
and the great creatures fawned upon instead of devouring me,
I ever have had the same strange power over them.
They come at my call and do my bidding, even as the
faithful Woola does the bidding of your mighty sire."
<P>
With a word the girl dispersed the fierce pack.  Roaring,
they returned to their interrupted feast, while Carthoris
and Thuvia passed among them toward the walled city.
<P>
As they advanced the man looked with wonder upon
the dead bodies of those of the green men that had not
been devoured or mauled by the banths.
<P>
He called the girl's attention to them.  No arrows
protruded from the great carcasses.  Nowhere upon any of
them was the sign of mortal wound, nor even slightest
scratch or abrasion.
<P>
Before the bowmen's dead had disappeared the corpses
of the Torquasians had bristled with the deadly arrows
of their foes.  Where had the slender messengers
of death departed?  What unseen hand had plucked them
from the bodies of the slain?
<P>
Despite himself Carthoris could scarce repress a shudder
of apprehension as he glanced toward the silent city
before them.  No longer was sign of life visible upon wall
or roof top.  All was quiet--brooding, ominous quiet.
<P>
Yet he was sure that eyes watched them from somewhere
behind that blank wall.
<P>
He glanced at Thuvia.  She was advancing with wide eyes
fixed upon the city gate.  He looked in the direction
of her gaze, but saw nothing.
<P>
His gaze upon her seemed to arouse her as from a lethargy.
She glanced up at him, a quick, brave smile touching
her lips, and then, as though the act was involuntary,
she came close to his side and placed one of her hands in his.
<P>
He guessed that something within her that was beyond her
conscious control was appealing to him for protection. 
He threw an arm about her, and thus they crossed the field.
She did not draw away from him.  It is doubtful that
she realized that his arm was there, so engrossed
was she in the mystery of the strange city before them.
<P>
They stopped before the gate.  It was a mighty thing.
From its construction Carthoris could but dimly
speculate upon its unthinkable antiquity.
<P>
It was circular, closing a circular aperture, and the
Heliumite knew from his study of ancient Barsoomian
architecture that it rolled to one side, like a huge wheel,
into an aperture in the wall.
<P>
Even such world-old cities as ancient Aaanthor were as
yet undreamed of when the races lived that built such
gates as these.
<P>
As he stood speculating upon the identity of this
forgotten city, a voice spoke to them from above.
Both looked up.  There, leaning over the edge of
the high wall, was a man.
<P>
His hair was auburn, his skin fair--fairer even than
that of John Carter, the Virginian.  His forehead was
high, his eyes large and intelligent.
<P>
The language that he used was intelligible to the two
below, yet there was a marked difference between it and
their Barsoomian tongue.
<P>
"Who are you?" he asked.  "And what do you here
before the gate of Lothar?"
<P>
"We are friends," replied Carthoris.  "This be the
princess, Thuvia of Ptarth, who was captured by the
Torquasian horde.  I am Carthoris of Helium, Prince of
the house of Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium, and son of
John Carter, Warlord of Mars, and of his wife, Dejah Thoris."
<P>
"`Ptarth'?" repeated the man.  "`Helium'?"  He shook
his head.  "I never have heard of these places, nor
did I know that there dwelt upon Barsoom a race of thy
strange colour.  Where may these cities lie, of which
you speak?  From our loftiest tower we have never seen
another city than Lothar."
<P>
Carthoris pointed toward the north-east.
<P>
"In that direction lie Helium and Ptarth," he said.
"Helium is over eight thousand haads from Lothar, while
Ptarth lies nine thousand five hundred haads north-east
of Helium." <1
<P>
<P>
<1 On Barsoom the AD is the basis of linear measurement. 
It is the equivalent of an Earthly foot, measuring about 11.694
Earth inches.  As has been my custom in the past, I have generally
translated Barsoomian symbols of time, distance, etc., into their
Earthly equivalent, as being more easily understood by Earth
readers.  For those of a more studious turn of mind it may be
interesting to know the Martian table of linear measurement, and
so I give it here:
<P>
     10 sofads = 1 ad
    200 ads    = 1 haad
    100 haads  = 1 karad
    360 karads = 1 circumference of Mars at equator.
<P>
A haad, or Barsoomian mile, contains about 2,339 Earth feet.
A karad is one degree.  A sofad about 1.17 Earth inches.
<P>
<P>
Still the man shook his head.
<P>
"I know of nothing beyond the Lotharian hills," he said.
"Naught may live there beside the hideous green hordes of Torquas.
They have conquered all Barsoom except this single valley and
the city of Lothar.  Here we have defied them for countless ages,
though periodically they renew their attempts to destroy us.
From whence you come I cannot guess unless you be descended
from the slaves the Torquasians captured in early times when
they reduced the outer world to their vassalage; but we had
heard that they destroyed all other races but their own."
<P>
Carthoris tried to explain that the Torquasians ruled
but a relatively tiny part of the surface of Barsoom, and
even this only because their domain held nothing to attract
the red race; but the Lotharian could not seem to
conceive of anything beyond the valley of Lothar other
than a trackless waste peopled by the ferocious green
hordes of Torquas.
<P>
After considerably parleying he consented to admit
them to the city, and a moment later the wheel-like gate
rolled back within its niche, and Thuvia and Carthoris
entered the city of Lothar.
<P>
All about them were evidences of fabulous wealth.  The
facades of the buildings fronting upon the avenue within
the wall were richly carven, and about the windows and
doors were ofttimes set foot-wide borders of precious
stones, intricate mosaics, or tablets of beaten gold bearing
bas-reliefs depicting what may have been bits of the
history of this forgotten people.
<P>
He with whom they had conversed across the wall was
in the avenue to receive them.  About him were a hundred
or more men of the same race.  All were clothed in
flowing robes and all were beardless.
<P>
Their attitude was more of fearful suspicion than antagonism.
They followed the new-comers with their eyes; but spoke no word to them.
<P>
Carthoris could not but notice the fact that though the
city had been but a short time before surrounded by a
horde of bloodthirsty demons yet none of the citizens
appeared to be armed, nor was there sign of soldiery about.
<P>
He wondered if all the fighting men had sallied forth in one
supreme effort to rout the foe, leaving the city all unguarded.
He asked their host.
<P>
The man smiled.
<P>
"No creature other than a score or so of our sacred
banths has left Lothar to-day," he replied.
<P>
"But the soldiers--the bowmen!" exclaimed Carthoris.
"We saw thousands emerge from this very gate,
overwhelming the hordes of Torquas and putting them
to rout with their deadly arrows and their fierce banths."
<P>
Still the man smiled his knowing smile.
<P>
"Look!" he cried, and pointed down a broad avenue before him.
<P>
Carthoris and Thuvia followed the direction indicated,
and there, marching bravely in the sunlight, they saw
advancing toward them a great army of bowmen.
<P>
"Ah!" exclaimed Thuvia.  "They have returned through another gate,
or perchance these be the troops that remained to defend the city?"
<P>
Again the fellow smiled his uncanny smile.
<P>
"There are no soldiers in Lothar," he said.  "Look!"
<P>
Both Carthoris and Thuvia had turned toward him while he spoke,
and now as they turned back again toward the advancing regiments
their eyes went wide in astonishment, for the broad avenue before
them was as deserted as the tomb.
<P>
"And those who marched out upon the hordes to-day?" whispered Carthoris.
"They, too, were unreal?"
<P>
The man nodded.
<P>
"But their arrows slew the green warriors," insisted Thuvia.
<P>
"Let us go before Tario," replied the Lotharian.
"He will tell you that which he deems it best you know.
I might tell you too much."
<P>
"Who is Tario?" asked Carthoris.
<P>
"Jeddak of Lothar," replied the guide, leading them
up the broad avenue down which they had but a moment
since seen the phantom army marching.
<P>
For half an hour they walked along lovely avenues between
the most gorgeous buildings that the two had ever seen.
Few people were in evidence.  Carthoris could not but
note the deserted appearance of the mighty city.
<P>
At last they came to the royal palace.  Carthoris saw
it from a distance, and guessing the nature of the
magnificent pile wondered that even here there should
be so little sign of activity and life.
<P>
Not even a single guard was visible before the great
entrance gate, nor in the gardens beyond, into which he
could see, was there sign of the myriad life that pulses
within the precincts of the royal estates of the red jeddaks.
<P>
"Here," said their guide, "is the palace of Tario."
<P>
As he spoke Carthoris again let his gaze rest upon the
wondrous palace.  With a startled exclamation he rubbed
his eyes and looked again.  No!  He could not be mistaken.
Before the massive gate stood a score of sentries.  Within,
the avenue leading to the main building was lined on either
side by ranks of bowmen.  The gardens were dotted
with officers and soldiers moving quickly to and fro,
as though bent upon the duties of the minute.
<P>
What manner of people were these who could conjure
an army out of thin air?  He glanced toward Thuvia.
She, too, evidently had witnessed the transformation.
<P>
With a little shudder she pressed more closely toward him.
<P>
"What do you make of it?" she whispered.  "It is most uncanny."
<P>
"I cannot account for it," replied Carthoris, "unless we
have gone mad."
<P>
Carthoris turned quickly toward the Lotharian.  The fellow
was smiling broadly.
<P>
"I thought that you just said that there were no soldiers
in Lothar," said the Heliumite, with a gesture toward
the guardsmen.  "What are these?"
<P>
"Ask Tario," replied the other.  "We shall soon be before him."
<P>
Nor was it long before they entered a lofty chamber
at one end of which a man reclined upon a rich couch
that stood upon a high dais.
<P>
As the trio approached, the man turned dreamy eyes
sleepily upon them.  Twenty feet from the dais their
conductor halted, and, whispering to Thuvia and Carthoris
to follow his example, threw himself headlong to the floor.
Then rising to hands and knees, he commenced crawling
toward the foot of the throne, swinging his head to
and fro and wiggling his body as you have seen a hound
do when approaching its master.
<P>
Thuvia glanced quickly toward Carthoris.  He was
standing erect, with high-held head and arms folded
across his broad chest.  A haughty smile curved his lips.
<P>
The man upon the dais was eyeing him intently, and
Carthoris of Helium was looking straight in the other's face.
<P>
"Who be these, Jav?" asked the man of him who
crawled upon his belly along the floor.
<P>
"O Tario, most glorious Jeddak," replied Jav, "these be
strangers who came with the hordes of Torquas to our gates,
saying that they were prisoners of the green men.
They tell strange tales of cities far beyond Lothar."
<P>
"Arise, Jav," commanded Tario, "and ask these two
why they show not to Tario the respect that is his due."
<P>
Jav arose and faced the strangers.  At sight of their
erect positions his face went livid.  He leaped toward them.
<P>
"Creatures!" he screamed.  "Down!  Down upon your
bellies before the last of the jeddaks of Barsoom!"
