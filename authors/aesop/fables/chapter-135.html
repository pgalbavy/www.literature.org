A VERY HUNGRY FOX, seeing some bread and meat left by shepherds
in the hollow of an oak, crept into the hole and made a hearty
meal.  When he finished, he was so full that he was not able to
get out, and began to groan and lament his fate.  Another Fox
passing by heard his cries, and coming up, inquired the cause of
his complaining.  On learning what had happened, he said to him,
"Ah, you will have to remain there, my friend, until you become
such as you were when you crept in, and then you will easily get
out."
