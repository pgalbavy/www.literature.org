<p>There wasn't any weirdness about the ship when I woke in the
sunlight. She was old and slow and rather small. She carried Lumsden
(master), Mercer (mate), a crew that seemed no better and no worse
than any other crew, and the old gentleman who had thrown me the
rope the night before, and who seemed to think that he had derogated
from his dignity in doing it. He was a Major Cowper, retiring
from a West Indian regiment, and had with him his wife and a disagreeable
little girl, with a yellow pigtail and a bony little chest and
arms.</p>

<p>On the whole, they weren't the sort of people that one would
have chosen for companions on a pleasure-trip. Major Cowper's
wife lay all day in a deck chair, alternately drawing to her and
repulsing the whining little girl. The major talked to me about
the scandals with which the world was filled, and kept a suspicious
eye upon his wife. He spent the morning in shaving what part of
his face his white whiskers did not cover, the afternoon in enumerating
to me the subjects on which he intended to write to the Horse
Guards. He had grown entirely amiable, perhaps for the reason
that his wife ignored my existence.</p>

<p>Meantime I let the days slip by idly, only wondering how I could
manage to remain in Havana and breathe the air of the same island
with the girl who had delivered me. Perhaps some day we might
meet&mdash;who knows? I was not afraid of that Irishman.</p>

<p>It never occurred to me to bother about the course we were taking,
till one day we sighted the Cuban coast, and I heard Lumsden and
Mercer pronounce the name of Rio Medio. The two ridiculous old
chaps talked of Mexican privateers, which seemed to rendezvous
off that place. They pointed out to me the headland near the bay.
There was no sign of privateer or pirate, as far as the eye could
reach. In the course of beating up to windward we closed in with
the coast, and then the wind fell.</p>

<p>I remained motionless against the rail for half the night, looking
at the land. Not a single light was visible. A wistful, dreamy
longing, a quiet longing pervaded me, as though I had been drugged.
I dreamed, as young men dream, of a girl's face. She was sleeping
there within this dim vision of land. Perhaps this was as near
as I should ever be able to approach her. I felt a sorrow without
much suffering. A great stillness reigned around the ship, over
the whole earth. At last I went below and fell asleep.</p>

<p>I was awakened by the idea that I had heard an extraordinary
row&mdash;shouting and stamping. But there was a dead silence, to which
I was listening with all my ears. Suddenly there was a little
pop, as if someone had spat rather vigorously; then a succession
of shouts, then another little pop, and more shouts, and the stamping
overhead. A woman began to shriek on the other side of the bulkhead,
then another woman somewhere else, then the little girl. I hurried
on deck, but it was some minutes before I could make things fit
together. I saw Major Cowper on the poop; he was brandishing a
little pistol and apostrophizing Lumsden, who was waving ineffectual
arms towards the sky; and there was a great deal of shouting,
forward and overhead. Cowper rushed at me, and explained that
something was an abominable scandal, and that there were women
on board. He waved his pistol towards the side; I noticed that
the butt was inlaid with mother-of-pearl Lumsden rushed at him
and clawed at his clothes, imploring him not to be rash.</p>

<p>We were so close in with the coast that the surf along the shore
gleamed and sparkled in full view.</p>

<p>Someone shouted aloft, "Look out! They are firing again."</p>

<p>Then only I noticed, a quarter of a mile astern and between the
land and us, a little schooner, rather low in the water, curtseying
under a cloud of white canvas&mdash;a wonderful thing to look at. It
was as if I had never seen anything so instinct with life and
the joy of it. A snowy streak spattered away from her bows at
each plunge. She came at a great speed, and a row of faces looking
our way became plain, like a beady decoration above her bulwarks.
She swerved a little out of her course, and a sort of mushroom
of smoke grew out of her side; there was a little gleam of smouldering
light hidden in its heart. The spitting bang followed again, and
something skipped along the wave-tops beside us, raising little
pillars of spray that drifted away on the wind. The schooner came
back on her course, heading straight for us; a shout like groaned
applause went up from on board us. Lumsden hid his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>I could hear little Mercer shrieking out orders forwards. We
were shortening sail. The schooner, luffing a little, ranged abreast.
A hail like a metal blare came out of her.</p>

<p>"If you donn'd heef-to we seenk you! We seenk you! By God!"</p>

<p>Major Cowper was using abominable language beside me. Suddenly
he began to call out to someone:</p>

<p>"Go down... go down, I say."</p>

<p>A woman's face disappeared into the hood of the companion like
a rabbit's tail into its burrow. There was a great volley of cracks
from the loose sails, and the ship came to. At the same time the
schooner, now on our beam and stripped of her light kites, put
in stays and remained on the other tack, with her foresheet to
windward.</p>

<p>Major Cowper said it was a scandal. The country was going to
the dogs because merchantmen were not compelled by law to carry
guns. He spluttered into my ears that there wasn't so much as
a twopenny signal mortar on board, and no more powder than enough
to load one of his duelling pistols. He was going to write to
the Horse Guards.</p>

<p>A blue-and-white ensign fluttered up to the main gaff of the
schooner; a boat dropped into the water. It all went breathlessly
&mdash;I hadn't time to think. I saw old Cowper run to the side
and aim his pistol overboard; there was an ineffectual click;
he made a gesture of disgust, and tossed it on deck. His head
hung dejectedly down upon his chest.</p>

<p>Lumsden said, "Thank God, oh, thank God!" and the old man turned
on him like a snarling dog.</p>

<p>"You infernal coward," he said. "Haven't you got a spark of courage?"</p>

<p>A moment after, our decks were invaded by men, brown and ragged,
leaping down from the bulwarks one after the other.</p>

<p>They had come out at break of day (we must have been observed
the evening before), a big schooner&mdash;full of as ill-favoured,
ragged rascals as the most vivid imagination could conceive. Of
course, there had been no resistance on our part. We were outsailed,
and at the first ferocious hail the halyards had been let go by
the run, and all our crew had bolted aloft. A few bronzed bandits
posted abreast of each mast kept them there by the menace of bell-mouthed
blunderbusses pointed upwards. Lumsden and Mercer had been each
tied flat down to a spare spar. They presented an appearance too
ridiculous to awaken genuine compassion. Major Cowper was made
to sit on a hen-coop, and a bearded pirate, with a red handkerchief
tied round his head and a cutlass in his hand, stood guard over
him. The major looked angry and crestfallen. The rest of that
infamous crew, without losing a moment, rushed into the cuddy
to loot the cabins for wearing apparel, jewellery, and money.
They squabbled amongst themselves, throwing the things on deck
into a great heap of booty.</p>

<p>The schooner flying the Mexican flag remained hove to abeam.
But in the man in command of the boarding party I recognized Tomas
Castro!</p>

<p>He <em>was</em> a pirate. My surmises were correct. He looked
the part to the life, in a plumed hat, cloaked to the chin, and
standing apart in a saturnine dignity.</p>

<p>"Are you going to have us all murdered, Castro?" I asked, with
indignation. To my surprise he did not seem to recognize me; indeed,
he pretended not to see me at all. I might have been thin air
for any sign he gave of being aware of my presence; but, turning
his back on me, he addressed himself to the ignobly captive Lumsden,
telling him that he, Castro, was the commander of that Mexican
schooner, and menacing him with dreadful threats of vengeance
for what he called the resistance we had offered to a privateer
of the Republic. I suppose he was pleased to qualify with the
name of armed resistance the miserable little pop of the major's
pocket pistol. To punish that audacity he announced that no private
property would be respected.</p>

<p>"You shall have to give up all the money on board," he yelled
at the wretched man lying there like a sheep ready for slaughter.
The other could only gasp and blink. Castro's ferocity was so
remarkable that for a moment it struck me as put on. There was
no necessity for it. We were meek and silent enough, only poor
Major Cowper muttered:</p>

<p>"My wife and child. . . ."</p>

<p>The ragged brown men were pouring on deck from below; their arms
full of bundles. Half a dozen of them started to pull off the
main hatch tarpaulin. Up aloft the crew looked down with scared
eyes. I began to say excitedly, in my indignation, almost into
his very ear:</p>

<p>"I know you, Tomas Castro&mdash;I know you &mdash;Tomas Castro."</p>

<p>Even then he seemed not to hear; but at last he looked into my
face balefully, as if he wished to convey the plague to me.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue," he said very quickly in Spanish. "This is
folly!"  His little hawk's beak of a nose nestled in his moustache.
He waved his arm and declared forcibly, "I don't know you. I am
Nicola el Demonio, the Mexican."</p>

<p>Poor old Cowper groaned. The reputation of Nicola el Demonio,
if rumours were to be trusted, was a horrible thing for a man
with women depending on him.</p>

<p>Five or six of these bandits were standing about Lumsden, the
major, and myself, fingering the locks of their guns. Poor old
Cowper, breaking away from his guard, was raging up and down the
poop; and the big pirate kept him off the companion truculently.
The major wanted to get below; the little girl was screaming in
the cuddy, and we could hear her very plainly. It was rather horrible.
Castro had gone forward into the crowd of scoundrels round the
hatchway. It was only then that I realized that Major Cowper was
in a state of delirious apprehension and fury; I seemed to remember
at last that for a long time he had been groaning somewhere near
me. He kept on saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake&mdash;for God's sake&mdash;my poor wife."</p>

<p>I understood that he must have been asking me to do something.</p>

<p>It came as a shock to me. I had a vague sensation of his fears.
Up till then I hadn't realized that any one could be much interested
in Mrs. Cowper.</p>

<p>He caught hold of my arm, as if he wanted support, and stuttered:</p>

<p>"Couldn't you&mdash;couldn't you speak to<hr>" He nodded in the
direction of Tomas Castro, who was bent and shouting down the
hatch. "Try to<hr>" the old man gasped. "Didn't you hear the
child scream?" His face was pallid and wrinkled, like a piece
of crumpled paper; his mouth was drawn on one side, and his lips
quivered one against the other.</p>

<p>I went to Castro and caught him by the arm. He spun round and
smiled discreetly.</p>

<p>"We shall be using force upon you directly. Pray resist, Señor;
but not too much. What? His wife? Tell that stupid Inglez with
whispers that she is safe." He whispered with an air of profound
intelligence, "We shall be ready to go as soon as these foul swine
have finished their stealing. I cannot stop them," he added.</p>

<p>I could not pause to think what he might mean. The child's shrieks
resounding louder and louder, I ran below. There were a couple
of men in the cabin with the women. Mrs. Cowper was lying back
upon a sofa, her face very white and drawn, her eyes wide open.
Her useless hands twitched at her dress; otherwise she was absolutely
motionless, like a frozen woman. The black nurse was panting convulsively
in a corner&mdash;a palpitating bundle of orange and purple and white
clothes. The child was rushing round and round, shrieking. The
two men did nothing at all. One of them kept saying in Spanish:</p>

<p>"But&mdash;we only want your rings. But&mdash;we only want your rings."</p>

<p>The other made feeble efforts to catch the child as it rushed
past him. He wanted its earrings&mdash;they were contraband of war,
I suppose.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cowper was petrified with terror. Explaining the desires
of the two men was like shouting things into the ear of a very
deaf woman. She kept on saying:</p>

<p>"Will they go away then? Will they go away then?" All the while
she was drawing the rings off her thin fingers, and handing them
to me. I gave them to the ruffians whose presence seemed to terrify
her out of her senses. I had no option. I could do nothing else.
Then I asked her whether she wished me to remain with her and
the child. She said:</p>

<p>"Yes. No. Go away. Yes. No&mdash;let me think."</p>

<p>Finally it came into my head that in the captain's cabin she
would be able to talk to her husband through the deck ventilator,
and, after a time, the idea filtered through to her brain. She
could hardly walk at all. The child and the nurse ran in front
of us, and, practically, I carried her there in my arms. Once
in the stateroom she struggled loose from me, and, rushing in,
slammed the door violently in my face. She seemed to hate me.</p>
