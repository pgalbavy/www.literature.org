<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Mr. Carewe was already at the breakfast-table, but the light
of his countenance, hidden behind the Rouen Journal, was not vouchsafed
to his daughter when she took her place opposite him, nor did
he see fit to return her morning greeting, from which she generously
concluded that the burning of the two warehouses had meant a severe
loss to him.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry, father," she said gently. (She had not called
him "papa" since the morning after her ball.) "I hope it isn't
to be a great trouble to you." There was no response, and, after
waiting for some time, she spoke again, rather tremulously, yet
not timidly: "Father?"</p>

<p>He rose, and upon his brow were marked the blackest lines of
anger she had ever seen, so that she leaned back from him, startled;
but he threw down the open paper before her on the table, and
struck it with his clenched fist.</p>

<p>"Read that!" he said. And he stood over her while she read.</p>

<p>There were some grandiloquent headlines: "Miss Elizabeth Carewe
an Angel of Mercy! Charming Belle Saves the Lives of Five Prominent
Citizens! Her Presence of Mind Prevents Conflagration from Wiping
Out the City!" It may be noted that Will Cummings, editor and
proprietor of the Journal, had written these tributes, as well
as the whole account of the evening's transactions, and Miss Betty
loomed as large in Will's narrative as in his good and lovelorn
heart. There was very little concerning the fire in the Journal;
it was nearly all about Betty. That is one of the misfortunes
which pursue a lady who allows an editor to fall in love with
her.</p>

<p>However, there was a scant mention of the arrival of the Volunteers
"upon the scene" (though none at all at the cause of their delay)
and an elo-quent paragraph was devoted to their handsome appearance,
Mr. Cummings having been one of those who insisted that the new
uniforms should be worn. "Soon," said the Journal, "through the
daring of the Chief of the Department, and the Captain of the
Hook-and-Ladder Company, one of whom placed and mounted the grappling-ladder,
over which he was immediately followed by the other carrying the
hose, a stream was sent to play upon the devouring element, a
feat of derring-do personally witnessed by a majority of our readers.
Mr. Vanrevel and Mr. Gray were joined by Eugene Madrillon, Tappingham
Marsh, and the editor of this paper, after which occurred the
unfortunate accident to the long ladder, leaving the five named
gentlemen in their terrible predicament, face to face with death
in its most awful form. At this frightful moment "&mdash;and all the
rest was about Miss Carewe.</p>

<p>As Will himself admitted, he had "laid himself out on that description." 
One paragraph was composed of short sentences, each beginning
with the word "alone." "Alone she entered the shattered door!
Alone she set foot upon the first flight of stairs! Alone she
ascended the second! Alone she mounted the third. Alone she lifted
her hand to the trap! Alone she opened it!" She was declared to
have made her appearance to the unfortunate prisoners on the roof,
even as "the palm-laden dove to the despairing Noah," and Will
also asserted repeatedly that she was the "Heroine of the Hour."</p>

<p>Miss Betty blushed to see her name so blazoned forth in print;
but she lacked one kind of vanity, and failed to find good reason
for more than a somewhat troubled laughter, the writer's purpose
was so manifestly kind in spite of the bizarre result.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish Mr. Cummings hadn't!" she exclaimed. "It would have
been better not to speak of me at all, of course; but I can't
see that there is anything to resent&mdash;it is so funny!"</p>

<p>"Funny!" Mr. Carewe repeated the word in a cracked falsetto,
with the evident intention of mocking her, and at the same time
hideously contorted his face into a grotesque idiocy of expression,
pursing his lips so extremely, and setting his brows so awry,
that his other features were cartooned out of all familiar likeness,
effecting an alteration as shocking to behold, in a man of his
severe cast of countenance, as was his falsetto mimicry to hear.
She rose in a kind of terror, perceiving that this contortion
was produced in burlesque of her own expression, and, as he pressed
nearer her, stepped back, overturning her chair. She had little
recollection of her father during her childhood; and as long as
she could remember, no one had spoken to her angrily, or even
roughly.</p>

<p>As she retreated from him, he leaned forward, thrusting the hideous
mask closer to her white and horror-stricken face.</p>

<p>"You can't see anything to resent in that!" he gibbered. "It's
so funny, is it? Funny! Funny! Funny! I'll show you whether it's
funny or not, I'll show you!" His voice rose almost to a shriek.
"You hang around fires, do you, on the public streets at night?
You're a nice one for me to leave in charge of my house while
I'm away, you trollop! What did you mean by going up on that roof?
You knew that damned Vanrevel was there! You did, I say, you knew
it!"</p>

<p>She ran toward the door with a frightened cry; but he got between
it and her, menacing her with his upraised open hands, shaking
them over her.</p>

<p>"You're a lovely daughter, aren't you!" he shouted hoarsely.
"You knew perfectly well who was on that roof, and you went! Didn't
you go? Answer me that! If I'd had arms about me when I got there,
I'd have shot that man dead! He was on my property, giving orders,
the black hound! And when I ordered him out, he told me if I interfered
with his work before it was finished, he'd have me thrown out&mdash;me
that owned the whole place; and there wasn't a man that would
lend me a pistol! 'Rescue!' You'd better rescue him from me, you
palm-laden dove, for I'll shoot him, I will! I'll kill that dog;
and he knows it. He can bluster in a crowd, but he'll hide now!
He's a coward and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He came home with me; he brought me home last night!" Her voice
rang out in the room like that of some other person, and she hardly
knew that it was herself who spoke.</p>

<p>"You lie!" he screamed, and fell back from her, his face working
as though under the dominance of some physical disorder, the flesh
of it plastic beyond conception, so that she cried out and covered
her face with her arm. "You lie! I saw you at the hedge with Crailey
Gray, though you thought I didn't. What do you want to lie like
that for? Vanrevel didn't even speak to you. I asked Madrillon.
You lie!"</p>

<p>He choked upon the words; a racking cough shook him from head
to foot; he staggered back and dropped upon her overturned chair,
his arms beating the table in front of him, his head jerking spasmodically
backward and forward as he gasped for breath.</p>

<p>"Ring the bell," he panted thickly, with an incoherent gesture.
"Nelson knows. Ring!"</p>

<p>Nelson evidently knew. He brought brandy and water from the sideboard
with no stinting hand, and within ten minutes Mr. Carewe was in
his accustomed seat, competent to finish his breakfast. In solitude,
however, he sat, and no one guessed his thoughts.</p>

<p>For Miss Betty had fled to her own room, and had bolted the door.
She lay upon the bed, shuddering and shivering with nausea and
cold, though the day was warm. Then, like a hot pain in her breast,
came a homesickness for St. Mary's, and the flood-tide of tears,
as she thought of the quiet convent in the sunshine over to the
west, the peace of it, and the goodness of everybody there.</p>

<p>"Sister Cecilia!" Her shoulders shook with the great sob that
followed this name, dearest to her in the world, convulsively
whispered to the pil-low "Dear Sister Cecilia!" She patted the
white pillow with her hand, as though it were the cool cheek against
which she yearned to lay her own. "Ah, you would know&mdash;you would
know!" With the thought of the serene face of the good Sister,
and of the kind arms that would have gone round her in her trouble,
her sobbing grew loud and uncontrollable. But she would not have
her father hear it, and buried her face deep in the pillow. After
a time, she began to grow quieter, turned, and lay with wet eyes
staring unseeingly at the wall, her underlip quivering with the
deep intake of each broken sigh.</p>

<p>"Oh, stars, stars, stars!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Missy?" There came a soft knock upon the door and the clink
of silver upon china. "Missy?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>So quick was Miss Betty that, although she answered almost at
once, the tears were washed away, and she was passing a cool,
wet towel over her eyes at the moment she spoke.</p>

<p>"Jass me. I brung yo' breakfas', honey."</p>

<p>Old Nelson's voice was always low and gentle, with a quaver and
hesitancy in the utterance; now it was tender and comforting with
the comprehension of one in suffering, the extraordinary tact,
which the old of his race nearly all come to possess. "Li'l chicken-wing
on piece brown toast, honey."</p>

<p>When she opened the door he came in, bending attentively over
his tray, and, without a glance toward his young mistress, made
some show of fuss and bustle, as he placed it upon a table near
the window and drew up a chair for her so that she could sit with
her back to the light.</p>

<p>"Dah now!" he exclaimed softly, removing the white napkin and
displaying other dainties besides the chicken wing. "Dass de way!
Dat ole Mamie in de kitchen, she got her failin's an' her grievin'
sins; but de way she do han'le chicken an' biscuit sutney ain't
none on 'em! She plead fo' me to ax you how you like dem biscuit."</p>

<p>He kept his head bent low over the table, setting a fork closer
to Betty's hand; arranging the plates, then rearranging them,
but never turning his eyes in her direction.</p>

<p>"Dat ole Mamie mighty vain, yessuh!" He suffered a very quiet
chuckle to escape him. "She did most sutney 'sist dat I ax you
ain't you like dem biscuit. She de ve'y vaines' woman in dis State,
dat ole Mamie, yessuh!"  And now he cast one quick glance out
of the corner of his eye at Miss Betty, before venturing a louder
chuckle. "She reckon dem biscuit goin' git her by Sain' Petuh
when she 'proach de hevumly gates! Uhuh! I tell her she got git
redemption fo' de aigs she done ruin dese many yeahs; 'cause she
as useless wid an ommelick as a two-day calf on de slick ice!"
Here he laughed loud and long. "You jass go and talk wid dat Mamie,
some day, Missy; you'll see how vain dat woman is."</p>

<p>"Has father gone out, Nelson?" asked Betty in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes'm; he up town." The old man's tone sank at once to the level
of her own; became confidential, as one speaks to another in a
room where somebody is ill. "He mekkin' perpetration to go down
de rivuh dis aft'noon. He say he done broke de news to you dat
he goin' 'way. Dey goin' buil' dem wa'house right up, an' yo'
pa he necistate go 'way 'count de contrack. He be gone two week',
honey," Nelson finished, without too much the air of imparting
cheery tidings, but with just enough.</p>

<p>"I am to stay here alone?"</p>

<p>"Law no, Missy! Dat big Miz Tanberry, dass de bes' frien' we
all got, she home ag'in, an' yo' pa goin' invite her visit at
de house, whiles he gone, an' to stay a mont' aftuh he git back,
too, soze she kin go to all de doin's an' junketin's wid you,
and talk wid de young mens dat you don' like whiles you talks
wid dem you does like."</p>

<p>"What time will father come home?"</p>

<p>"Home? He be gone two week', honey!"</p>

<p>"No; I mean to-day."</p>

<p>"Law! He ain' comin' back. Bid me pack de trunk an' ca'y um down
to de boat at noon. Den he bid me say far'-ye-well an' a kine
good-bye fo' him, honey. 'Say he think you ain't feelin' too well,
soze he won't 'sturb ye, hisself, an' dat he unestly do hope you
goin' have splen'id time whiles he trabblin'." (Nelson's imagination
covered many deficits in his master's courtesy.) "Say he reckon
you an' ole Miz Tanberry goin' git 'long mighty nice wid one'nurr.
An' dass what me an' Mamie reckon 'spechually boun' to take place,
'cause dat a mighty gay lady, dat big Miz Tanberry, an' ole frien'
'er owah fambly. She 'uz a frien' er yo' momma's, honey."</p>

<p>Miss Betty had begun by making a pretence to eat, only to please
the old man, but the vain woman's cookery had been not unduly
extolled, and Nelson laughed with pleasure to see the fluffy biscuits
and the chicken wing not nibbled at but actually eaten. This was
a healthy young lady, he thought, one who would do the household
credit and justify the extravagant pride which kitchen and stable
already had in her. He was an old house-servant, therefore he
had seen many young ladies go through unhappy hours, and he admired
Miss Betty the more because she was the first who had indulged
in strong weeping and did not snuffle at intervals afterward.
He understood perfectly everything that had passed between father
and daughter that morning.</p>

<p>When her breakfast was finished, she turned slowly to the window,
and, while her eyes did not refill, a slight twitching of the
upper lids made him believe that she was going over the whole
scene again in her mind; whereupon he began to move briskly about
the room with a busy air, picking up her napkin, dusting a chair
with his hand, exchanging the position of the andirons in the
fireplace; and, apparently discovering that the por-trait of Georges
Meilhac was out of line, he set it awry, then straight again,
the while he hummed an old "spiritual" of which only the words
"Chain de Lion Down" were allowed to be quite audible. They were
repeated often, and at each repetition of them he seemed profoundly,
though decorously, amused, in a way which might have led to a
conjecture that the refrain bore some distant reference to his
master's eccentricity of temper. At first be chuckled softly,
but at the final iteration of "Chain de Lion Down" burst into
outright laughter.</p>

<p>"Honey, my Law!" he exclaimed, "But yo' pa de 'ceivin'dest man!
He mighty proud er you!"</p>

<p>"Proud of me!" She turned to him in astonishment.</p>

<p>Nelson's laughter increased. "Hain't be jass de 'ceivin'dest
man! Yessuh, he de sot-uppest man in dis town 'count what you
done last night. What he say dis mawn', dat jass his way!"</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" said Miss Betty, sadly.</p>

<p>"Yes'm! He proud er you, but he teahbul mad at dat man. He hain't
mad at you, but he gotter cuss somebody! Jass reach out fo' de
nighes' he kin lay han's on, an' dis mawn' it happen soze it were
you, honey. Uhuh! You oughter hearn him ins' night when he come
home. Den it were me. Bless God, I ain't keerin'. He weren't mad
at me, no mo'n' he were at you. He jass mad!"</p>

<p>Miss Betty looked at the old fellow keenly. He remained, however,
apparently unconscious of her scrutiny, and occupied himself with
preparations for removing the tray.</p>

<p>"Nelson, what is the quarrel between my father and Mr. Vanrevel?"</p>

<p>He had lifted the tray, but set it down precipitately, bending
upon her a surprised and sobered countenance.</p>

<p>"Missy," he said, gravely, "Dey big trouble 'twix' dem two."</p>

<p>"I know," she returned quietly. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Wha' fo' you ax me, Missy?"</p>

<p>"Because you're the only one I can ask. I don't know anyone here
well enough, except you."</p>

<p>Nelson's lips puckered solemnly. "Mist' Vanrevel vote Whig; but
he ag'in Texas."</p>

<p>"Well, what if he is?"</p>

<p>"Yo' pa mighty strong fo' Texas."</p>

<p>"No'm, dat ain't hardly de beginnin'. Mist' lanrevel he a Ab'litionist."</p>

<p>"Well? Won't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Honey, folks roun' heah mos' on 'em like Mist' Vanrevel so well
dey ain't hole it up ag'in' him&mdash;but, Missy, ef dey one thing
topper God's worl' yo' pa do desp'itly and contestably despise,
hate, cuss, an' outrageously 'bominate wuss'n' a yaller August
spiduh it are a Ab'litionist! He want stomple 'em eve'y las' one
under he boot-heel, 'cep'n dat one Mist' Crailey Gray. Dey's a
considabul sprinklin' er dem Ab'litionists 'bout de kentry, honey;
dey's mo' dat don' know w'ich dey is; an' dey's mo' still dat
don' keer. Soze dat why dey go git up a quo'l twix' yo' pa an'
dat man; an' 'range to have 'er on a platfawm, de yeah 'fo' de
las' campaign; an', suh, dey call de quo'l a de-bate; an' all
de folks come in f'um de kentry, an' all de folks in town come,
too. De whole possetucky on 'em sit an' listen.</p>

<p>"Fus' yo' pa talk; den Mist' Vanrevel, bofe on 'em mighty cole
an' civilized. Den yo' pa git wo'm up, Missy, like he do, 'case
he so useter have his own way; 'tain't his fault, he jass cain't
help hollerin' an' cussin' if anybody 'pose him; but Mist' Vanrevel
he jass as suvvige, but he stay cole, w'ich make yo' pa all de
hotter. He holler mighty strong, Missy, an' some de back ranks
'gun snickerin' at him. Uhuh! He fa'r jump, he did; an' den bimeby
Mist' Vanrevel he say dat no man oughter be given de pilverige
to sell another, ner to wollop him wid a blacksnake, whether he
'buse dat pilverige er not. 'My honabul 'ponent,' s's he, 'Mist'
Carewe, rep'sent in hisseif de 'ristocratic slave-ownin' class
er de Souf, do' he live in de Nawf an' 'ploy free labor; yit it
sca'sely to be b'lieve dat any er you would willin'ly trus' him
wid de powah er life an' death ovah yo' own chillun, w'ich is
virchously what de slave-ownah p'sess.'</p>

<p>"Missy, you jass oughter see yo' pa den! He blue in de face an'
dance de quadrille on de boa'ds. He leave his cha'h, git up, an'
run 'cross to de odder side de platfawm, an' shake be fis' ovah
dat man's head, an' screech out how it all lies dat de slaves
evah 'ceive sich a treatments. 'Dat all lies, you pu'juh!' he
holler. 'All lies, you misabul thief,' he holler. 'All lies, an'
you know it, you low-bawn slandah' an' scoun'le!'</p>

<p>"An' wid dat Mist' Vanrevel, be laff in yo' pa face, an' tuhn
to de crowd, he did, an' say: 'You reckon dat if dish yuh man
a slave-ownah, an' a slave had anguhed him as I have anguhed him
tonight, does any er you b'lieve dat dat slave wouldn' be tied
up an' whipped tell de blood run, an' den sole down de rivuh to-morrer?'</p>

<p>"Well, suh, 'co'se mos' on 'em b'lieve same as yo' pa; but dat
sutney fotch 'em, an' win de de-bate, 'case dey jass natchully
lay back an' roah, dey did, Missy; dey laff an' stomp an' holler
tell you could a hearn 'em a mild away. An' honey, yo' pa'd a
millyum times druther Mist' Vanrevel'd a kilt him dan tuhn de
laff on him. He'd shoot a man, honey, ef he jass s'picion him
to grin out de cornder his eye at him; an' to stan' up dah wid
de whole county fa'r roahin' at him&mdash;it's de God's mussy be did'n
have no ahms wid him, dat night! Ole Mist' Chen'eth done brung
him home, an' yo' pa reach out an' kick me squah' out'n' de liberry
winder soon's he ketch sight er me!" The old man's gravity gave
way to his enjoyment of the recollection, and he threw back his
head to laugh. "He sho' did, honey! Uhuh! Ho, ho, ho! He sho'
did, honey, he sho' did!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as he lifted the tray again and crossed the room
to go, his solemnity returned. "Missy," he said earnestly, "ef
dat young gelmun fall in love wid you, w'ich I knows he will ef
he ketch sight er you, lemme say dis, an' please fo' to ba'h in
mine: better have nuttin' do wid him fo' he own sake; an' 'bove
all, keep him fur sway f'um dese p'emises. Don' let him come in
a mild er dis house."</p>

<p>"Nelson, was that all the quarrel between them?"</p>

<p>"Blessed Mussy! ain' dat 'nough? Ef dey's any mo' I ain' hearn
what dat part were," he answered quickly, but with a dogged tightening
of the lips which convinced Miss Betty that he knew very well.</p>

<p>"Nelson, what was the rest of it?"</p>

<p>"Please, Missy, I got pack yo' pa trunk; an' it time, long ago,
fer me to be at my wu'k." He was half out of the door.</p>

<p>"What was the rest of it?" she repeated quietly.</p>

<p>"Now, honey," he returned with a deprecatory shake of his head,
"I got my own wu'k 'tend to; an' I ain't nevah ax nobody what
'twas, an' I ain't goin' ax 'em. An' lemme jass beg you f oiler
de ole man's advice: you do de same, 'case nobody ain't goin'
tell you. All I know is dat it come later and were somep'n 'bout
dat riprarin Crailey Gray. Yo' pa he sent a channelge to Mist'
Vanrevel, an' Mist' Vanrevel 'fuse to fight him 'cause he say
he don' b'lieve shootin' yo' pa goin' do yo' pa any good, an'
he still got hope mekkin' good citizen outer him. Dat brung de
laff on yo' pa ag'in; an' he 'clare to God ef he ketch Vanrevel
on any groun' er hisn he shoot him like a mad dog. 'Pon my livin'
soul he mean dem wuds, Missy! Dey had hard 'nough time las' night
keepin' him fum teahin' dat man to pieces at de fiah. You mus'
keep dat young gelmun 'way fum heah!"</p>

<p>"He came home with me last night, Nelson; I told father so."</p>

<p>"Yes'm. Yo' pa tole me you say dat, but he reckon you done it
to mek him madder, 'cause you mad, too. He say he done see dat
Crailey Gray comin' 'long de hedge wid you."</p>

<p>"He was mistaken, it was Mr. Vanrevel."</p>

<p>Nelson rolled his eyes fervently to heaven. "Den dat young man
run pintedly on he death! Ef you want keep us all dis side er
de Jawdan Rivuh, don' let him set foot in dis neighbo'hood when
yo' pa come back! An', honey&mdash;" his voice sank to a penetrating
whisper&mdash;"'fo' I do a lick er wu'k I goin' out in de stable an'
git down on my knees an' retu'n thanksgiving to de good God 'case
he hole Carewe Street in de dahkness las' night!"</p>

<p>This was the speech he chose for his exit, but, after closing
the door behind him, he opened it again, and said, cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Soon's I git de trunk fix f' yo' pa, I bring 'roun' dat bay
colt wid de side saddle. You better set 'bout gittin' on yo' ridin'-habit,
Missy. De roads is mighty good dis sunshiny wedduh."</p>

<p>"Nelson?"</p>

<p>"Do you think such an attack as father had this morning&mdash;is&mdash;dangerous?"</p>

<p>He had hoped for another chance to laugh violently before he
left her, and this completely fitted his desire. "Ho, ho, he!"
he shouted. "No'm, no, no, honey! He jass git so mad it mek him
sick. You couldn' kill dat man wid a broad-ax, Missy!"</p>

<p>And he went down the hail leaving the reverberations of his hilarity
behind him. The purpose of his visit had been effected, for, when
Miss Betty appeared upon the horse-block in her green habit and
gauntlets, she was smiling; so that only a woman&mdash;or a wise old
man&mdash;could have guessed that she had wept bitterly that morning.</p>

<p>She cantered out to the flat, open country to the east, where
she found soft dirt-roads that were good for the bay colt's feet,
and she reached a cross-road several miles from town before she
was overcome by the conviction that she was a wicked and ungrateful
girl. She could not place the exact spot of her guilt, but she
knew it was there, somewhere, since she felt herself a guilty
thing.</p>

<p>For the picture which Nelson had drawn rose before her: the one
man standing alone in his rage on the platform, overwhelmed by
his calm young adversary, beaten and made the butt of laughter
for a thousand. Her father had been in the wrong in that quarrel,
and somehow she was sure, too, he must have been wrong in the
"personal" one, as well: the mysterious difficulty over Fanchon's
Mr. Gray, who had looked so ashamed last night. What feud could
they make over him, of all people in the world? He looked strong
enough to take care of his own quarrels, even if he was so rigorously
bound by Fanchon's apron-string when it came to a word with another
girl!</p>

<p>But the conclusion that her father had been in error did not
lessen the pathetic appeal of the solitary figure facing the ridicule
of the crowd. She felt that he always honestly believed himself
in the right; she knew that he was vain; that he had an almost
monstrous conception of his dignity; and, realizing the bitterness
of that public humiliation which he had undergone, she understood
the wrath, the unspeakable pain and sense of outrage, which must
have possessed him.</p>

<p>And now she was letting him go forth upon a journey&mdash;his way
beset with the chances of illness and accident&mdash;whence he might
never return; she was letting him go without seeing him again;
letting him go with no word of farewell from his daughter. In
brief: she was a wicked girl. She turned the colt's head abruptly
to the west and touched his flanks with her whip.</p>

<p>So it fell out that as the packet foamed its passage backward
from Carewe's wharf into the current, the owner of the boat, standing
upon the hurricane deck, heard a cry from the shore, and turned
to behold his daughter dash down to the very end of the wharf
on the well-lathered colt. Miss Betty's hair was blown about her
face; her cheeks were rosy, her eager eyes sparkling from more
than the hard riding.</p>

<p>"Papa!" she cried, "I'm sorry!"</p>

<p>She leaned forward out of the saddle, extending her arms to him
appealingly in a charming gesture, and, absolutely ignoring the
idlers on the wharf and the passengers on the steamer, was singly
intent upon the tall figure on the hurricane-deck. "Papa&mdash;good-by.
Please forgive me!"</p>

<p>"By the Almighty, but that's a fine woman!" said the captain
of the boat to a passenger from Rouen. "Is she his daughter?"</p>

<p>"Please forgive me!" the clear voice came again, with its quaver
of entreaty, across the widening water; and then, as Mr. Carewe
made no sign, by word or movement, of hearing her, and stood without
the slightest alteration of his attitude, she cried to him once
more:</p>

<p>"Good-by!"</p>

<p>The paddle-wheels reversed; the boat swung down the river, Mr.
Carewe still standing immovable on the hurricane-deck, while,
to the gaze of those on the steamer, the figure on the bay colt
at the end of the wharf began to grow smaller and smaller. She
was waving her handkerchief in farewell, and they could see the
little white speck in the distance, dimmer and dimmer, yet fluttering
still as they passed out of sight round the bend nearly three-quarters
of a mile below.</p>
