It was the habit of the Doctor and the Admiral to
accompany each other upon a morning ramble between
breakfast and lunch.  The dwellers in those quiet
tree-lined roads were accustomed to see the two figures,
the long, thin, austere seaman, and the short, bustling,
tweed-clad physician, pass and repass with such
regularity that a stopped clock has been reset by them. 
The Admiral took two steps to his companion's three, but
the younger man was the quicker, and both were equal to
a good four and a half miles an hour.
<P>
It was a lovely summer day which followed the events
which have been described.  The sky was of the deepest
blue, with a few white, fleecy clouds drifting lazily
across it, and the air was filled with the low drone of
insects or with a sudden sharper note as bee or bluefly
shot past with its quivering, long-drawn hum, like an
insect tuning-fork.  As the friends topped each rise
which leads up to the Crystal Palace, they could see the
dun clouds of London stretching along the northern
sky-line, with spire or dome breaking through the
low-lying haze.  The Admiral was in high spirits, for the
morning post had brought good news to his son.
<P>
"It is wonderful, Walker," he was saying, "positively
wonderful, the way that boy of mine has gone ahead during
the last three years.  We heard from Pearson to-day. 
Pearson is the senior partner, you know, and my boy the
junior--Pearson and Denver the firm.  Cunning old dog is
Pearson, as cute and as greedy as a Rio shark.  Yet he
goes off for a fortnight's leave, and puts my boy in full
charge, with all that immense business in his hands,
and a freehand to do what he likes with it.  How's that
for confidence, and he only three years upon 'Change?"
<P>
"Any one would confide in him.  His face is a
surety," said the Doctor.
<P>
"Go on, Walker!"  The Admiral dug his elbow at him. 
"You know my weak side.  Still it's truth all the same. 
I've been blessed with a good wife and a good son, and
maybe I relish them the more for having been cut off from
them so long.  I have much to be thankful for!"
<P>
"And so have I.  The best two girls that ever
stepped.  There's Clara, who has learned up as much
medicine as would give her the L.S.A., simply in order
that she may sympathize with me in my work.  But hullo,
what is this coming along?"
<P>
"All drawing and the wind astern!" cried the Admiral. 
"Fourteen knots if it's one.  Why, by George, it is that
woman!"
<P>
A rolling cloud of yellow dust had streamed round the
curve of the road, and from the heart of it had emerged
a high tandem tricycle flying along at a breakneck pace. 
In front sat Mrs. Westmacott clad in a heather tweed
pea-jacket, a skirt which just{?} passed her knees and a
pair of thick gaiters of the same material.  She had a
great bundle of red papers under her arm, while
Charles, who sat behind her clad in Norfolk jacket and
knickerbockers, bore a similar roll protruding from
either pocket.  Even as they watched, the pair eased up,
the lady sprang off, impaled one of her bills upon the
garden railing of an empty house, and then jumping on to
her seat again was about to hurry onwards when her nephew
drew her attention to the two gentlemen upon the
footpath.
<P>
"Oh, now, really I didn't notice you," said she,
taking a few turns of the treadle and steering the
machine across to them.  "Is it not a beautiful morning?"
<P>
"Lovely," answered the Doctor.  "You seem to be very
busy."
<P>
"I am very busy." She pointed to the colored paper
which still fluttered from the railing.  "We have been
pushing our propaganda, you see.  Charles and I have been
at it since seven o'clock.  It is about our meeting.  I
wish it to be a great success.  See!"  She smoothed out
one of the bills, and the Doctor read his own name in
great black letters across the bottom.
<P>
"We don't forget our chairman, you see.  Everybody is
coming.  Those two dear little old maids opposite, the
Williamses, held out for some time; but I have their
promise now.  Admiral, I am sure that you wish us well."
<P>
"Hum!  I wish you no harm, ma'am."
<P>
"You will come on the platform?"
<P>
"I'll be---- No, I don't think I can do that."
<P>
"To our meeting, then?"
<P>
"No, ma'am; I don't go out after dinner."
<P>
"Oh yes, you will come.  I will call in if I may, and
chat it over with you when you come home.  We have not
breakfasted yet.  Goodbye!"  There was a whir of wheels,
and the yellow cloud rolled away down the road again.  By
some legerdemain the Admiral found that he was clutching
in his right hand one of the obnoxious bills.  He
crumpled it up, and threw it into the roadway.
<P>
"I'll be hanged if I go, Walker," said he, as be
resumed his walk.  "I've never been hustled into doing a
thing yet, whether by woman or man."
<P>
"I am not a betting man," answered the Doctor, "but
I rather think that the odds are in favor of your going."
<P>
The Admiral had hardly got home, and had just seated
himself in his dining-room, when the attack upon him was
renewed.  He was slowly and lovingly unfolding the
Times preparatory to the long read which led up to
luncheon, and had even got so far as to fasten his golden
pince-nez on to his thin, high-bridged nose, when he
heard a crunching of gravel, and, looking over the top of
his paper, saw Mrs. Westmacott coming up the garden walk. 
She was still dressed in the singular costume which
offended the sailor's old-fashioned notions of propriety,
but he could not deny, as he looked at her, that she was
a very fine woman.  In many climes he had looked upon
women of all shades and ages, but never upon a more
clearcut, handsome face, nor a more erect, supple, and
womanly figure.  He ceased to glower as he gazed upon
her, and the frown smoothed away from his rugged brow.
<P>
"May I come in?" said she, framing herself in the
open window, with a background of green sward and blue
sky.  "I feel like an invader deep in an enemy's
country."
<P>
"It is a very welcome invasion, ma'am," said he,
clearing his throat and pulling at his high collar.  "Try
this garden chair.  What is there that I can do for you? 
Shall I ring and let Mrs. Denver know that you are here?"
<P>
"Pray do not trouble, Admiral.  I only looked in with
reference to our little chat this morning.  I wish that
you would give us your powerful support at our coming
meeting for the improvement of the condition of woman."
<P>
"No, ma'am, I can't do that." He pursed up his lips
and shook his grizzled head.
<P>
"And why not?"
<P>
"Against my principles, ma'am."
<P>
"But why?"
<P>
"Because woman has her duties and man has his. 
I may be old-fashioned, but that is my view.  Why, what
is the world coming to?  I was saying to Dr. Walker only
last night that we shall have a woman wanting to command
the Channel Fleet next."
<P>
"That is one of the few professions which cannot be
improved," said Mrs. Westmacott, with her sweetest smile. 
"Poor woman must still look to man for protection."
<P>
"I don't like these new-fangled ideas, ma'am.  I tell
you honestly that I don't.  I like discipline, and I
think every one is the better for it.  Women have got a
great deal which they had not in the days of our fathers. 
They have universities all for themselves, I am told, and
there are women doctors, I hear.  Surely they should rest
contented.  What more can they want?"
<P>
"You are a sailor, and sailors are always chivalrous. 
If you could see how things really are, you would change
your opinion. What are the poor things to do?  There
are so many of them and so few things to which they can
turn their hands.  Governesses?  But there are hardly any
situations.  Music and drawing?  There is not one in
fifty who has any special talent in that direction.   
Medicine?  It is still surrounded with difficulties for
women, and it takes many years and a small fortune to
qualify.  Nursing?  It is hard work ill paid, and none
but the strongest can stand it.  What would you have
them do then, Admiral?  Sit down and starve?"
<P>
"Tut, tut!  It is not so bad as that."
<P>
"The pressure is terrible.  Advertise for a lady
companion at ten shillings a week, which is less than a
cook's wage, and see how many answers you get.  There is
no hope, no outlook, for these struggling thousands. 
Life is a dull, sordid struggle, leading down to a
cheerless old age.  Yet when we try to bring some little
ray of hope, some chance, however distant, of something
better, we are told by chivalrous gentlemen that it is
against their principles to help."
<P>
The Admiral winced, but shook his head in dissent.
<P>
"There is banking, the law, veterinary surgery,
government offices, the civil service, all these at least
should be thrown freely open to women, if they have
brains enough to compete successfully for them.  Then if
woman were unsuccessful it would be her own fault, and
the majority of the population of this country could no
longer complain that they live under a different law to
the minority, and that they are held down in poverty and
serfdom, with every road to independence sealed to them."
<P>
"What would you propose to do, ma'am?"
<P>
"To set the more obvious injustices right, and so
to pave the way for a reform.  Now look at that man
digging in the field.  I know him.  He can neither read
nor write, he is steeped in whisky, and he has as much
intelligence as the potatoes that he is digging.  Yet the
man has a vote, can possibly turn the scale of an
election, and may help to decide the policy of this
empire.  Now, to take the nearest example, here am I, a
woman who have had some education, who have traveled, and
who have seen and studied the institutions of many
countries.  I hold considerable property, and I pay more
in imperial taxes than that man spends in whisky, which
is saying a great deal, and yet I have no more direct
influence upon the disposal of the money which I pay than
that fly which creeps along the wall.  Is that right?  Is
it fair?"
<P>
The Admiral moved uneasily in his chair.  "Yours is
an exceptional case," said he.
<P>
"But no woman has a voice.  Consider that the women
are a majority in the nation.  Yet if there was a
question of legislation upon which all women were agreed
upon one side and all the men upon the other, it would
appear that the matter was settled unanimously when more
than half the population were opposed to it.   Is that
right?"
<P>
Again the Admiral wriggled.  It was very awkward for 
the gallant seaman to have a handsome woman opposite
to him, bombarding him with questions to none of which he
could find an answer.  "Couldn't even get the tompions
out of his guns," as he explained the matter to the
Doctor that evening.
<P>
"Now those are really the points that we shall lay
stress upon at the meeting.  The free and complete
opening of the professions, the final abolition of the
zenana I call it, and the franchise to all women who pay
Queen's taxes above a certain sum.  Surely there is
nothing unreasonable in that.  Nothing which could offend
your principles.  We shall have medicine, law, and the
church all rallying that night for the protection of
woman.  Is the navy to be the one profession absent?"
<P>
The Admiral jumped out of his chair with an evil word
in his throat.  "There, there, ma'am," he cried.  "Drop
it for a time.  I have heard enough.  You've turned me a
point or two.  I won't deny it.  But let it stand at
that.  I will think it over."
<P>
"Certainly, Admiral.  We would not hurry you in your
decision.  But we still hope to see you on our platform." 
She rose and moved about in her lounging masculine
fashion from one picture to another, for the walls were
thickly covered with reminiscences of the Admiral's
voyages.
<P>
"Hullo!" said she.  "Surely this ship would have
furled all her lower canvas and reefed her topsails if
she found herself on a lee shore with the wind on her
quarter."
<P>
"Of course she would.  The artist was never past
Gravesend, I swear.  It's the Penelope as she was on
the 14th of June, 1857, in the throat of the Straits of
Banca, with the Island of Banca on the starboard bow, and
Sumatra on the port.  He painted it from description, but
of course, as you very sensibly say, all was snug below
and she carried storm sails and double-reefed topsails,
for it was blowing a cyclone from the sou'east.  I
compliment you, ma'am, I do indeed! "
<P>
"Oh, I have done a little sailoring myself--as much
as a woman can aspire to, you know.  This is the Bay of
Funchal.  What a lovely frigate!"
<P>
"Lovely, you say!  Ah, she was lovely!  That is the
Andromeda.  I was a mate aboard of her--sub-lieutenant
they call it now, though I like the old name best."
<P>
"What a lovely rake her masts have, and what a curve
to her bows!  She must have been a clipper."
<P>
The old sailor rubbed his hands and his eyes
glistened.  His old ships bordered close upon his wife
and his son in his affections.
<P>
"I know Funchal," said the lady carelessly.  "A
couple of years ago I had a seven-ton cutter-rigged
yacht, the Banshee, and we ran over to Madeira from
Falmouth."
<P>
"You ma'am, in a seven-tonner?"
<P>
"With a couple of Cornish lads for a crew.  Oh, it
was glorious!  A fortnight right out in the open, with no
worries, no letters, no callers, no petty thoughts,
nothing but the grand works of God, the tossing sea and
the great silent sky.  They talk of riding, indeed, I am
fond of horses, too, but what is there to compare with
the swoop of a little craft as she pitches down the long
steep side of a wave, and then the quiver and spring as
she is tossed upwards again?  Oh, if our souls could
transmigrate I'd be a seamew above all birds that fly! 
But I keep you, Admiral.  Adieu!"
<P>
The old sailor was too transported with sympathy to
say a word.  He could only shake her broad muscular hand. 
She was half-way down the garden path before she heard
him calling her, and saw his grizzled head and
weather-stained face looking out from behind the
curtains.
<P>
"You may put me down for the platform," he cried, and
vanished abashed behind the I curtain of his Times,
where his wife found him at lunch time.
<P>
"I hear that you have had quite a long chat with Mrs.
Westmacott," said she.
<P>
"Yes, and I think that she is one of the most
sensible women that I ever knew.
<P>
"Except on the woman's rights question, of course."
<P>
"Oh, I don't know.  She had a good deal to say for
herself on that also.  In fact, mother, I have taken a
platfom ticket for her meeting."
