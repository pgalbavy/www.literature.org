<p>The "old Indian" asserted itself in Deerfoot the Shawanoe.  While
every act, and in deed every thought, of the wonderful young warrior
was prompted by conscience, yet his views of duty under certain
circumstances, were fitted to bring a smile to the face of an
impartial judge.</p>

<p>While standing behind the tree on the crest of the elevation,
he was sure of two things: he had little time to lose in going
to the help of Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub, and the Shawanoes
who were trailing him were close at hand.  He settled the dispute
by deciding to stay where he was a few minutes longer.  If his
enemies did not appear within that brief period, he would hasten
from the spot.</p>

<p>This conclusion on the part of the young Shawanoe presaged a
desperate encounter between him and his foes, and he made preparation
for it.  He set his rifle on the ground, with the muzzle leaning
against the tree which served to screen his body, and brought
his long bow to the front.  Drawing an arrow from its quiver,
he glanced at it as if looking for some defect, but he knew none
was there, nor was a single shaft of the score and a half in the
quiver imperfect in any respect.  The youth always made his own
weapons.  He glued on the feather which guided and steadied the
missile in its flight, and he fastened the heads with metal obtained
from the whites.  Every one of his possessions had been tested
and proven.</p>

<p>Deerfoot grasped the bow loosely in the centre, one finger of
the same band also holding the arrow in place, with the notch
against the deer sinew, not yet drawn backward.  The amateur archer
will understand that he was in form to bring the shaft to a head
on the instant it should become necessary.</p>

<p>It was some five minutes after he had assumed this position,
and while looking back over his own trail, that two Shawanoe warriors
silently emerged from the bushes fifty yards off, and stealthily
approached him.  They moved absolutely without noise, for their
woodcraft told them they were close upon the most dangerous being
they had ever undertaken to hunt.</p>

<p>The foremost lifted his foot just clear of the ground and placed
it squarely down again.  His head and shoulders were thrown forward,
so that most of his long, coarse, black hair dangled on both sides
of his neck and over his chest.  It hung in front of his face
also, and, as his forehead was very low, he had the appearance,
while continually glancing from side to side and in front, of
a wild beast glaring from behind a hedge.  He trailed his rifle
in his right hand, the left resting on the handle of a knife,
which, with that of a tomahawk, protruded from his girdle.  He
wore the usual hunting-shirt, leggings and moccasins, his body
and limbs being well protected.  His blanket would have been only
an encumbrance, and while he was engaged in such delicate business,
it was left with the canoe on the bank of the Mississippi.  The
ears when visible through the dangling hair, were seen to hold
enormous rings of bone, while the nose hooked over and dipped
in a fashion that showed that the organ had at some time held
a pendant in the way of an ornament.</p>

<p>The countenance was blackened and disfigured with paint, in the
style already made familiar to the reader, and the protuberant
nose was rendered more striking by the retreating chin.  The Shawanoe
was crafty, cunning, treacherous and revengeful, which characteristics
it may be said belong to the entire American race.</p>

<p>The second warrior, with the exception of his features, was the
counterpart of the leader.  Dress, paint, and ornaments, even
to the strings of wampum around the neck, were similar.  He carried
his rifle in the same style, and his left hand rested on the weapons
in his girdle.  Both were strong and sinewy, and their sight lost
not the slightest object in their field of vision.</p>

<p>It was this precaution which apprised them, at the same instant,
that they were confronted by the most terrifying picture on which
their eyes had ever rested.  They halted as if transfixed by a
lightning stroke.</p>

<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe stood behind the trunk of an oak, a foot
in diameter, with his arrow drawn to a head and pointed at the
heart of the foremost warrior.  The matchless youth was at bay,
and in the exact posture for launching his deadly weapon&mdash;right
foot forward, bow grasped in the centre, arrow held by the fingers
of the left hand, which were drawn backward of the shoulder, while
the bow itself, on account of its great length, was held diagonally
in front.</p>

<p>The two Shawanoes who suddenly became aware of their danger,
did not see all that has been described, for Deerfoot utilized
the shelter so far as he could.  Most of his body was carefully
protected, and, though the bow was slanted, the lowermost point
scarcely showed on the opposite side of the tree from the top
of the weapon.</p>

<p>The warriors saw the head, left shoulder and hands of Deerfoot
and the upper part of the bow, whose arrow was on the very point
of speeding toward them.  Directly over the shaft, with head slightly
inclined, like that of a hunter sighting over his gun, were the
gleaming eyes and face of the young Shawanoe.  It looked as if
he had turned his head to one side that he might catch the music
made by the twang of the string when it should dart forward with
the speed of the rattlesnake striking from its coil.</p>

<p>No more startling sight can be imagined than that of a gun aimed
straight at us, with the finger of the marksman pressing the trigger. 
The first proof the pursuers received that they were within sight
of the youth they were seeking was of that nature. Both stood
for a second or more unable to stir.  But their training prevented
the spell lasting more than the briefest while.</p>

<p>The second warrior made a tremendous bound directly backward,
dropping to a squatting posture as he landed, and then scrambling
to cover with a quickness the eye could hardly follow.   While
employed in doing so, his companion emitted an ear-splitting screech
which made the woods echo.  He caught a shadowy glimpse of him
as he leaped high in the air and fell backward, carrying with
him the arrow of the marvelous archer, which had gone clear and
clean through his body, and remained projecting both from the
breast and back.  A defiant shout rang from the elevation, and,
peeping timidly forth, the crouching red man saw Deerfoot holding
his bow aloft with one hand, while he swung the gun with the other
and strode off, his face toward his pursuers.</p>

<p>"Where are the Shawanoes?  Do they love to follow Deerfoot across
the great river?  His heart was sad for them because so many bowed
to his bow and arrow&mdash;so he left them that his eyes might not
look on their warriors who fell by his hand; the Shawanoes are
fools, because they follow Deerfoot.  They cannot harm him, for
he is the friend of the white man, and the Great Spirit gives
him his care; let the Shawanoes send Tecumseh and the Hurons send
Waughtauk; Deerfoot stayed his hand when the time had come for
Waughtauk to sing his death-song, but if the chief trails him
across the great river, Deerfoot will not spare him."</p>

<p>The young warrior doubtless would have indulged in further annoying
remarks, had he not kept moving all the time, so that his last
words were uttered while he was beyond sight of the terrified
Shawanoe crouching on the ground; but the voice of  Deerfoot was
raised to a key which prevented any observation being lost.</p>

<p>The declaration, following the act of the youth, showed that
in his mind his relations toward his enemies changed when they
followed him beyond the Mississippi.  In Kentucky all stood on
the same footing, and he often showed mercy, but if they pursued
him into Louisiana they became his persecutors, and whoever crossed
his path or sought to molest him, did so at his peril.  He had
voluntarily withdrawn from their chosen hunting-grounds, and they
would be wise if they left him alone.  He would not flee from
them like a hunted deer, but would teach them severer lessons
than they had ever yet learned.</p>

<p>The death-yell of the stricken Shawanoe was certain to bring
others to the spot, but Deerfoot cared nothing for that.  It mattered
not if there were a score, for, if he chose to flee, he could
out-speed the swiftest runner on either side the Mississippi. 
With the thousands upon thousands of miles of mountain, prairie,
river, and wilderness at his back, he could laugh to scorn the
rage of his enemies.</p>

<p>Though he had lived several months in this section, it was the
first time his deadly foes had attempted to molest him.  Self-defense
demanded that they should be shown it would not pay to repeat
the attempt.</p>

<p>Still retaining gun and bow, he passed rapidly down the slope,
and, having previously fixed in his mind the course to pursue,
pushed forward at an easy pace, which was much swifter than would
be supposed.</p>

<p>Fast as he journeyed, he had not gone far when five Shawanoes
(including him who had so narrowly escaped his bow), hurried to
the spot where the smitten warrior lay.  They had heard agonized
cry in battle and knew what it meant.  The second survivor was
given but a minute to flee, when he encountered the others rushing
thither, and he turned about and joined them.  They would have
been less arduous had they not known that the terrible Deerfoot
was gone, as was shown by his defiant shout, which came from distant
point in the woods.</p>

<p>Precisely eight Shawanoes (not a Miami among them) paddled over
the Mississippi to hunt the youth: the only two absent from this
party were pursuing Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub, while they
journeyed toward the northwest, after the stray horse.  The occasion,
therefore, was a fitting one in which to consult as to the line
of policy to be followed.</p>

<p>It may seem incredible, but it is an unquestioned fact, that
five of the best warriors of the most formidable tribe in the
West decided to give up the attempt to capture or kill a single
one of their race whose years were considerably less than those
of the youngest member of the party, and that, too, on the ground
that the undertaking was too dangerous.  One of those five Shawanoes,
became converted to Christianity after the war of 1812, and settled
in Kentucky, near the home of Ned Preston, to whom he gave the
particulars of the council held by him and his comrades more than
twenty years before.</p>

<p>Of course no one of the five admitted that personally he was
afraid of Deerfoot.  All expressed the greatest eagerness to meet
him, where a chance to engage in fatal combat could be gained.
Apparently no greater boon could befall them than such extreme
good fortune.</p>

<p>But they could not shut their eyes to one or two discouraging
facts: they had entered a country entirely strange to them, but
which was familiar in a great measure to the fleet-footed traitor,
who could never find himself lacking for some hole in which to
hide himself. It was very much like hunting in an endless forest
for the fawn that leaves no scent for the dog to follow.</p>

<p>But worse than all, the Shawanoes could not doubt that the execrated
Deerfoot had formed alliance with the Osages, who would give him
help whenever wanted.  Such being their theory followed that they
were not fleeing from a despised foe, but from a whole tribe of
Indians.  For five warriors to withdraw in the face of such overwhelming
odds, could not be construed as cowardice, but only as wise discretion.</p>

<p>Such were the grounds on which the party based their decision,
which was accompanied fierce lamentations that the fates had interposed
to save Deerfoot from their vengeance.</p>

<p>"We talk that way," said the old Indian, long years afterward,
while telling the story in broken English, "and," he added with
a laugh twinkle in his dark eyes, "we much brave&mdash;we want to meet
Deerfoot but we looked to see he did not come; if he came, then
we wouldn't be so much brave; we turn, and run like buffalo, we
much afraid of Deerfoot; we no want to see him."</p>
