<P>
Back at his hotel, though nearly two in the morning, he found
the reporters waiting to interview him.  Next morning there were
more.  And thus, with blare of paper trumpet, was he received by
New York.  Once more, with beating of toms-toms and wild
hullaballoo, his picturesque figure strode across the printed
sheet.  The King of the Klondike, the hero of the Arctic, the
thirty-million-dollar millionaire of the North, had come to New
York.  What had he come for?  To trim the New Yorkers as he had
trimmed the Tonopah crowd in Nevada?  Wall Street had best watch
out, for the wild man of Klondike had just come to town.  Or,
perchance, would Wall Street trim him?  Wall Street had trimmed
many wild men; would this be Burning Daylight's fate?  Daylight
grinned to himself, and gave out ambiguous interviews.  It helped
the game, and he grinned again, as he meditated that Wall Street
would sure have to go some before it trimmed him.
<P>
They were prepared for him to play, and, when heavy buying of
Ward Valley began, it was quickly decided that he was the
operator.  Financial gossip buzzed and hummed.  He was after the
Guggenhammers once more.  The story of Ophir was told over again
and sensationalized until even Daylight scarcely recognized it. 
Still, it was all grist to his mill.  The stock gamblers were
clearly befooled.  Each day he increased his buying, and so eager
were the sellers that Ward Valley rose but slowly.  "It sure
beats poker," Daylight whispered gleefully to himself, as he
noted the perturbation he was causing.  The newspapers hazarded
countless guesses and surmises, and Daylight was constantly
dogged by a small battalion of reporters.  His own interviews
were gems.  Discovering the delight the newspapers took in his
vernacular, in his "you-alls," and "sures," and "surge-ups," he
even exaggerated these particularities of speech, exploiting the
phrases he had heard other frontiersmen use, and inventing
occasionally a new one of his own.
<P>
A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday
the eighteenth.  Not only was he gambling as he had never gambled
before, but he was gambling at the biggest table in the world and
for stakes so large that even the case-hardened habitues of that
table were compelled to sit up.  In spite of the unlimited
selling, his persistent buying compelled Ward Valley steadily to
rise, and as Thursday approached, the situation became acute. 
Something had to smash.  How much Ward Valley was this Klondike
gambler going to buy?  How much could he buy?  What was the Ward
Valley crowd doing all this time?  Daylight appreciated the
interviews with them that appeared--interviews delightfully
placid
and non-committal.  Leon Guggenhammer even hazarded the opinion
that this Northland Croesus might possibly be making a mistake. 
But not that they cared, John Dowsett explained.  Nor did they
object.  While in the dark regarding his intentions, of one thing
they were certain; namely, that he was bulling Ward Valley.  And
they did not mind that.  No matter what happened to him and his
spectacular operations, Ward Valley was all right, and would
remain
all right, as firm as the Rock of Gibraltar.  No; they had no
Ward
Valley to sell, thank you.  This purely fictitious state of the
market was bound shortly to pass, and Ward Valley was not to be
induced to change the even tenor of its way by any insane stock
exchange flurry.  "It is purely gambling from beginning to end,"
were Nathaniel Letton's words; "and we refuse to have anything to
do with it or to take notice of it in any way."
<P>
During this time Daylight had several secret meetings with his
partners--one with Leon Guggenhammer, one with John Dowsett, and
two with Mr. Howison.  Beyond congratulations, they really
amounted to nothing; for, as he was informed, everything was
going satisfactorily.
<P>
But on Tuesday morning a rumor that was disconcerting came to
Daylight's ears.  It was also published in the Wall Street
Journal, and it was to the effect, on apparently straight inside
information, that on Thursday, when the directors of Ward Valley
met, instead of the customary dividend being declared, an
assessment would be levied.  It was the first check Daylight had
received.  It came to him with a shock that if the thing were so
he was a broken man.  And it also came to him that all this
colossal operating of his was being done on his own money. 
Dowsett, Guggenhammer, and Letton were risking nothing.  It was a
panic, short-lived, it was true, but sharp enough while it lasted
to make him remember Holdsworthy and the brick-yard, and to
impel him to cancel all buying orders while he rushed to a
telephone.
<P>
"Nothing in it--only a rumor," came Leon Guggenhammer's throaty
voice in the receiver.  "As you know," said Nathaniel Letton, "I
am one of the directors, and I should certainly be aware of it
were such action contemplated.  And John Dowsett: "I warned you
against just such rumors.  There is not an iota of truth in
it--certainly not.  I tell you on my honor as a gentleman."
<P>
Heartily ashamed of himself for his temporary loss of nerve,
Daylight returned to his task.  The cessation of buying had
turned the Stock Exchange into a bedlam, and down all the line of
stocks the bears were smashing.  Ward Valley, as the ape,
received the brunt of the shock, and was already beginning to
tumble.  Daylight calmly doubled his buying orders.  And all
through Tuesday and Wednesday, and Thursday morning, he went on
buying, while Ward Valley rose triumphantly higher.  Still they
sold, and still he bought, exceeding his power to buy many times
over, when delivery was taken into account.  What of that?  On
this day the double dividend would be declared, he assured
himself.  The pinch of delivery would be on the shorts.  They
would be making terms with him.
<P>
And then the thunderbolt struck.  True to the rumor, Ward Valley
levied the assessment.  Daylight threw up his arms.  He verified
the report and quit.  Not alone Ward Valley, but all securities
were being hammered down by the triumphant bears.  As for Ward
Valley, Daylight did not even trouble to learn if it had fetched
bottom or was still tumbling.  Not stunned, not even bewildered,
while Wall Street went mad, Daylight withdrew from the field to
think it over.  After a short conference with his brokers, he
proceeded to his hotel, on the way picking up the evening papers
and glancing at the head-lines.  BURNING DAYLIGHT CLEANED OUT, he
read; DAYLIGHT GETS HIS; ANOTHER WESTERNER FAILS TO FIND EASY
MONEY.  As he entered his hotel, a later edition announced the
suicide of a young man, a lamb, who had followed Daylight's play.
<P>
What in hell did he want to kill himself for?  was Daylight's
muttered comment.
<P>
He passed up to his rooms, ordered a Martini cocktail, took off
his shoes, and sat down to think.  After half an hour he roused
himself to take the drink, and as he felt the liquor pass
warmingly through his body, his features relaxed into a slow,
deliberate, yet genuine grin.  He was laughing at himself.
<P>
"Buncoed, by gosh!" he muttered.
<P>
Then the grin died away, and his face grew bleak and serious. 
Leaving out his interests in the several Western reclamation
projects (which were still assessing heavily), he was a ruined
man.  But harder hit than this was his pride.  He had been so
easy.  They had gold-bricked him, and he had nothing to show for
it.  The simplest farmer would have had documents, while he had
nothing but a gentleman's agreement, and a verbal one at that. 
Gentleman's agreement.  He snorted over it.  John Dowsett's
voice,
just as he had heard it in the telephone receiver, sounded in his
ears the words, "On my honor as a gentleman."  They were
sneak-thieves and swindlers, that was what they were, and they
had given him the double-cross.  The newspapers were right.  He
had come to New York to be trimmed, and Messrs. Dowsett, Letton,
and Guggenhammer had done it.  He was a little fish, and they had
played with him ten days--ample time in which to swallow him,
along with his eleven millions.  Of course, they had been
unloading on him all the time, and now they were buying Ward
Valley back for a song ere the market righted itself.  Most
probably, out of his share of the swag, Nathaniel Letton would
erect a couple of new buildings for that university of his.  Leon
Guggenhammer would buy new engines for that yacht, or a whole
fleet of yachts.  But what the devil Dowsett would do with his
whack, was beyond him--most likely start another string of banks.
<P>
And Daylight sat and consumed cocktails and saw back in his life
to Alaska, and lived over the grim years in which he had battled
for his eleven millions.  For a while murder ate at his heart,
and wild ideas and sketchy plans of killing his betrayers flashed
through his mind.  That was what that young man should have done
instead of killing himself.  He should have gone gunning.  
Daylight unlocked his grip and took out his automatic pistol--a
big Colt's .44.  He released the safety catch with his thumb, and
operating the sliding outer barrel, ran the contents of the clip
through the mechanism.  The eight cartridges slid out in a
stream.  He refilled the clip, threw a cartridge into the
chamber, and, with the trigger at full cock, thrust up the safety
ratchet.  He shoved the weapon into the side pocket of his coat,
ordered another Martini, and resumed his seat.
<P>
He thought steadily for an hour, but he grinned no more.  Lines
formed in his face, and in those lines were the travail of the
North, the bite of the frost, all that he had achieved and
suffered--the long, unending weeks of trail, the bleak tundra
shore of Point Barrow, the smashing ice-jam of the Yukon, the
battles with animals and men, the lean-dragged days of famine,
the long months of stinging hell among the mosquitoes of the
Koyokuk, the toil of pick and shovel, the scars and mars of
pack-strap and tump-line, the straight meat diet with the dogs,
and all the long procession of twenty full years of toil and
sweat and endeavor.
<P>
At ten o'clock he arose and pored over the city directory.  Then
he put on his shoes, took a cab, and departed into the night. 
Twice he changed cabs, and finally fetched up at the night office
of a detective agency.  He superintended the thing himself, laid
down money in advance in profuse quantities, selected the six men
he needed, and gave them their instructions.  Never, for so
simple a task, had they been so well paid; for, to each, in
addition to office charges, he gave a five-hundred-dollar bill,
with the promise of another if he succeeded.  Some time next day,
he was convinced, if not sooner, his three silent partners would
come together.  To each one two of his detectives were to be
attached.  Time and place was all he wanted to learn.
<P>
"Stop at nothing, boys," were his final instructions.  "I must
have this information.  Whatever you do, whatever happens, I'll
sure see you through."
<P>
Returning to his hotel, he changed cabs as before, went up to his
room, and with one more cocktail for a nightcap, went to bed and
to sleep.  In the morning he dressed and shaved, ordered
breakfast and the newspapers sent up, and waited.  But he did not
drink.  By nine o'clock his telephone began to ring and the
reports to come in.  Nathaniel Letton was taking the train at
Tarrytown.  John Dowsett was coming down by the subway.  Leon
Guggenhammer had not stirred out yet, though he was assuredly
within.  And in this fashion, with a map of the city spread out
before him, Daylight followed the movements of his three men as
they drew together.  Nathaniel Letton was at his offices in the
Mutual-Solander Building.  Next arrived Guggenhammer.  Dowsett
was still in his own offices.  But at eleven came the word that
he also had arrived, and several minutes later Daylight was in a
hired motor-car and speeding for the Mutual-Solander Building.
<P>
 CHAPTER IV
<P>
Nathaniel Letton was talking when the door opened; he ceased,
and with his two companions gazed with controlled perturbation at
Burning Daylight striding into the room.  The free, swinging
movements of the trail-traveler were unconsciously exaggerated in
that stride of his.  In truth, it seemed to him that he felt the
trail beneath his feet.
<P>
"Howdy, gentlemen, howdy," he remarked, ignoring the unnatural
calm with which they greeted his entrance.  He shook hands with
them in turn, striding from one to another and gripping their
hands so heartily that Nathaniel Letton could not forbear to
wince.  Daylight flung himself into a massive chair and sprawled
lazily, with an appearance of fatigue.  The leather grip he had
brought into the room he dropped carelessly beside him on the
floor
<P>
"Goddle mighty, but I've sure been going some," he sighed.  "We
sure trimmed them beautiful.  It was real slick.  And the beauty
of the play never dawned on me till the very end.  It was pure
and simple knock down and drag out.  And the way they fell for it
was amazin'."
<P>
The geniality in his lazy Western drawl reassured them.  He was
not so formidable, after all.  Despite the act that he had
effected an entrance in the face of Letton's instructions to the
outer office, he showed no indication of making a scene or
playing rough.
<P>
"Well," Daylight demanded good-humoredly, "ain't you-all got a
good word for your pardner?  Or has his sure enough brilliance
plumb dazzled you-all?"
<P>
Letton made a dry sound in his throat.  Dowsett sat quietly and
waited, while Leon Guggenhammer struggled into articulation.
<P>
"You have certainly raised Cain," he said.
<P>
Daylight's black eyes flashed in a pleased way.
<P>
"Didn't I, though!" he proclaimed jubilantly.  "And didn't we
fool'em!  I was totally surprised.  I never dreamed they would be
that easy.
<P>
"And now," he went on, not permitting the pause to grow awkward,
"we-all might as well have an accounting.  I'm pullin' West this
afternoon on that blamed Twentieth Century."   He tugged at his
grip, got it open, and dipped into it with both his hands.  "But
don't forget, boys, when you-all want me to hornswoggle Wall
Street another flutter, all you-all have to do is whisper the
word.  I'll sure be right there with the goods."
<P>
His hands emerged, clutching a great mass of stubs, check-books,
and broker's receipts.  These he deposited in a heap on the big
table, and dipping again, he fished out the stragglers and added
them to the pile.  He consulted a slip of paper, drawn from his
coat pocket, and read aloud:-
<P>
"Ten million twenty-seven thousand and forty-two dollars and
sixty-eight cents is my figurin' on my expenses.  Of course
that-all's taken from the winnings before we-all get to figurin'
on the whack-up.  Where's your figures?  It must a' been a Goddle
mighty big clean-up."
<P>
The three men looked their bepuzzlement at one another.  The man
was a bigger fool than they had imagined, or else he was playing
a game which they could not divine.
<P>
Nathaniel Letton moistened his lips and spoke up.
<P>
"It will take some hours yet, Mr. Harnish, before the full
accounting can be made.  Mr. Howison is at work upon it now. 
We--ah--as you say, it has been a gratifying clean-up.  Suppose
we
have lunch together and talk it over.  I'll have the clerks work
through the noon hour, so that you will have ample time to catch
your train."
<P>
Dowsett and Guggenhammer manifested a relief that was almost
obvious.  The situation was clearing.  It was disconcerting,
under the circumstances, to be pent in the same room with this
heavy-muscled, Indian-like man whom they had robbed.  They
remembered unpleasantly the many stories of his strength and
recklessness.  If Letton could only put him off long enough for
them to escape into the policed world outside the office door,
all would be well; and Daylight showed all the signs of being put
off.
<P>
"I'm real glad to hear that," he said.  "I don't want to miss
that train, and you-all have done me proud, gentlemen, letting me
in on this deal.  I just do appreciate it without being able to
express my feelings.  But I am sure almighty curious, and I'd
like terrible to know, Mr. Letton, what your figures of our
winning is.  Can you-all give me a rough estimate?"
<P>
Nathaniel Letton did not look appealingly at his two friends, but
in the brief pause they felt that appeal pass out from him. 
Dowsett, of sterner mould than the others, began to divine that
the Klondiker was playing.  But the other two were still older
the blandishment of his child-like innocence.
<P>
"It is extremely--er--difficult," Leon Guggenhammer began.  "You
see, Ward Valley has fluctuated so, er--"
<P>
"That no estimate can possibly be made in advance," Letton
supplemented.
<P>
"Approximate it, approximate it," Daylight counselled cheerfully.
<P>
"It don't hurt if you-all are a million or so out one side or the
other.  The figures'll straighten that up.  But I'm that curious
I'm just itching all over.  What d'ye say?"
<P>
"Why continue to play at cross purposes?" Dowsett demanded
abruptly and coldly.  "Let us have the explanation here and now. 
Mr. Harnish is laboring under a false impression, and he should
be set straight.  In this deal--"
<P>
But Daylight interrupted.  He had played too much poker to be
unaware or unappreciative of the psychological factor, and he
headed Dowsett off in order to play the denouncement of the
present game in his own way.
<P>
"Speaking of deals," he said, "reminds me of a poker game I once
seen in Reno, Nevada.  It wa'n't what you-all would call a
square game.  They-all was tin-horns that sat in.  But they was a
tenderfoot--short-horns they-all are called out there.  He stands
behind the dealer and sees that same dealer give hisself four
aces offen the bottom of the deck.  The tenderfoot is sure
shocked.  He slides around to the player facin' the dealer across
the table.
<P>
"'Say,' he whispers, 'I seen the dealer deal hisself four aces.'
<P>
"'Well, an' what of it?" says the player.
<P>
"'I'm tryin' to tell you-all because I thought you-all ought to
know,' says the tenderfoot.  'I tell you-all I seen him deal
hisself four aces.'
<P>
"'Say, mister,' says the player, 'you-all'd better get outa
here.  You-all don't understand the game.  It's his deal, ain't
it?'"
<P>
The laughter that greeted his story was hollow and perfunctory,
but Daylight appeared not to notice it.
<P>
"Your story has some meaning, I suppose," Dowsett said pointedly.
<P>
Daylight looked at him innocently and did not reply.  He turned
jovially to Nathaniel Letton.
<P>
"Fire away," he said.  "Give us an approximation of our winning. 
As I said before, a million out one way or the other won't
matter, it's bound to be such an almighty big winning."  By
this time Letton was stiffened by the attitude Dowsett had taken,
and his answer was prompt and definite.
<P>
"I fear you are under a misapprehension, Mr. Harnish.  There are
no winnings to be divided with you.  Now don't get excited, I beg
of you.  I have but to press this button..."
<P>
Far from excited, Daylight had all the seeming of being stunned. 
He felt absently in his vest pocket for a match, lighted it, and
discovered that he had no cigarette.  The three men watched him
with the tense closeness of cats.  Now that it had come, they
knew that they had a nasty few minutes before them.
<P>
"Do you-all mind saying that over again?" Daylight said.  "Seems
to me I ain't got it just exactly right.  You-all said...?"
<P>
He hung with painful expectancy on Nathaniel Letton's utterance.
<P>
"I said you were under a misapprehension, Mr. Harnish, that was
all.  You have been stock gambling, and you have been hard hit. 
But neither Ward Valley, nor I, nor my associates, feel that we
owe you anything."
<P>
Daylight pointed at the heap of receipts and stubs on the table.
<P>
"That-all represents ten million twenty-seven thousand and
forty-two dollars and sixty-eight cents, hard cash.  Ain't it
good for anything here?"
<P>
Letton smiled and shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
Daylight looked at Dowsett and murmured:--
<P>
"I guess that story of mine had some meaning, after all."  He
laughed in a sickly fashion.  "It was your deal all right, and
you-all dole them right, too.  Well, I ain't kicking.  I'm like
the player in that poker game.  It was your deal, and you-all had
a right to do your best.  And you d-one it-cleaned me out
slicker'n a whistle."
<P>
He gazed at the heap on the table with an air of stupefaction.
<P>
"And that-all ain't worth the paper it's written on. Gol dast it,
you-all can sure deal 'em 'round when you get a chance. 
Oh, no, I ain't a-kicking.  It was your deal, and you-all
certainly done me, and a man ain't half a man that squeals on
another man's deal.  And now the hand is played out, and the
cards are on the table, and the deal's over, but..."
<P>
His hand, dipping swiftly into his inside breast pocket, appeared
with the big Colt's automatic.
<P>
"As I was saying, the old deal's finished.  Now it's MY deal, and
I'm a-going to see if I can hold them four aces-
<P>
"Take your hand away, you whited sepulchre!" he cried sharply.
<P>
Nathaniel Letton's hand, creeping toward the push-button on the
desk, was abruptly arrested.
<P>
"Change chairs," Daylight commanded.  "Take that chair over
there, you gangrene-livered skunk.  Jump! By God! or I'll make
you leak till folks'll think your father was a water hydrant and
your mother a sprinkling-cart.  You-all move your chair
alongside, Guggenhammer; and you-all Dowsett, sit right there,
while I just irrelevantly explain the virtues of this here
automatic.  She's loaded for big game and she goes off eight
times.  She's a sure hummer when she gets started.
<P>
"Preliminary remarks being over, I now proceed to deal. 
Remember, I ain't making no remarks about your deal.  You done
your darndest, and it was all right.  But this is my deal, and
it's up to me to do my darndest.  In the first place, you-all
know me.  I'm Burning Daylight--savvee?  Ain't afraid of God,
devil, death, nor destruction.  Them's my four aces, and they
sure copper your bets.  Look at that there living skeleton. 
Letton, you're sure afraid to die.  Your bones is all rattling
together you're that scared.  And look at that fat Jew there. 
This little weapon's sure put the fear of God in his heart.  He's
yellow as a sick persimmon.  Dowsett, you're a cool one.  You-all
ain't batted an eye nor turned a hair.  That's because you're
great on arithmetic.  And that makes you-all dead easy in this
deal of mine.  You're sitting there and adding two and two
together, and you-all know I sure got you skinned.  You know me,
and that I ain't afraid of nothing.  And you-all adds up all your
money and knows you ain't a-going to die if you can help it."
<P>
"I'll see you hanged," was Dowsett's retort.
<P>
"Not by a damned sight.  When the fun starts, you're the first I
plug.  I'll hang all right, but you-all won't live to see it. 
You-all die here and now while I'll die subject to the law's
delay--savvee?  Being dead, with grass growing out of your
carcasses, you won't know when I hang, but I'll sure have the
pleasure a long time of knowing you-all beat me to it."
<P>
Daylight paused.
<P>
"You surely wouldn't kill us?" Letton asked in a queer, thin
voice.
<P>
Daylight shook his head.
<P>
"It's sure too expensive.  You-all ain't worth it.  I'd sooner
have my chips back.  And I guess you-all'd sooner give my chips
back than go to the dead-house."
<P>
A long silence followed.
<P>
"Well, I've done dealt.  It's up to you-all to play.  But while
you're deliberating, I want to give you-all a warning: if that
door opens and any one of you cusses lets on there's anything
unusual, right here and then I sure start plugging.  They ain't a
soul'll get out the room except feet first."
<P>
A long session of three hours followed.  The deciding factor was
not the big automatic pistol, but the certitude that Daylight
would use it.  Not alone were the three men convinced of this,
but Daylight himself was convinced.  He was firmly resolved to
kill the men if his money was not forthcoming.  It was not an
easy matter, on the spur of the moment, to raise ten millions in
paper currency, and there were vexatious delays.  A dozen times
Mr. Howison and the head clerk were summoned into the room.  On
these occasions the pistol lay on Daylight's lap, covered
carelessly by a newspaper, while he was usually engaged in
rolling or lighting his brown-paper cigarettes.  But in the end,
the thing was accomplished.  A suit-case was brought up by one of
the clerks from the waiting motor-car, and Daylight snapped it
shut on the last package of bills.  He paused at the door to make
his final remarks.
<P>
"There's three several things I sure want to tell you-all.  When
I get outside this door, you-all'll be set free to act, and I
just want to warn you-all about what to do.  In the first place,
no warrants for my arrest--savvee?  This money's mine, and I
ain't
robbed you of it.  If it gets out how you gave me the
double-cross
and how I done you back again, the laugh'll be on you, and it'll
sure be an almighty big laugh.  You-all can't afford that laugh. 
Besides, having got back my stake that you-all robbed me of, if
you
arrest me and try to rob me a second time, I'll go gunning for
you-all, and I'll sure get you.  No little fraid-cat shrimps like
you-all can skin Burning Daylight.  If you win you lose, and
there'll sure be some several unexpected funerals around this
burg.
<P>
Just look me in the eye, and you-all'll savvee I mean business. 
Them stubs and receipts on the table is all yourn.  Good day."
<P>
As the door shut behind him, Nathaniel Letton sprang for the
telephone, and Dowsett intercepted him.
<P>
"What are you going to do?" Dowsett demanded.
<P>
"The police.  It's downright robbery.  I won't stand it.  I tell
you I won't stand it."
<P>
Dowsett smiled grimly, but at the same time bore the slender
financier back and down into his chair.
<P>
"We'll talk it over," he said; and in Leon Guggenhammer he found
an anxious ally.
<P>
And nothing ever came of it.  The thing remained a secret with
the three men.  Nor did Daylight ever give the secret away,
though that afternoon, leaning back in his stateroom on the
Twentieth Century, his shoes off, and feet on a chair, he
chuckled long and heartily.  New York remained forever puzzled
over the affair; nor could it hit upon a rational explanation. 
By all rights, Burning Daylight should have gone broke, yet it
was known that he immediately reappeared in San Francisco
possessing an apparently unimpaired capital.  This was evidenced
by the magnitude of the enterprises he engaged in, such as, for
instance, Panama Mail, by sheer weight of money and fighting
power wresting the control away from Shiftily and selling out in
two months to the Harriman interests at a rumored enormous
advance.
