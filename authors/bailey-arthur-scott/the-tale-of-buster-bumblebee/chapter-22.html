<p>Though he alighted right on top of the pumpkin, which stood on the wide
shelf in Farmer Green's carriage-house, Buster Bumblebee thought that the
strange buzzing sound had grown fainter. He was sure that he had heard it
more plainly when he was nearer the merry fiddler.
</p>
<p>There was a gouge in the side of the fat pumpkin, into which he peered
carefully. He even crawled into the small cavity himself. But there was
nothing there. And he decided, after thinking deeply for some time, that
there could not possibly be a bee inside the pumpkin.
</p><p>As soon as he had made up his mind on that point Buster Bumblebee
blustered back to old dog Spot once more.
</p><p>"You're certainly wrong!" he exclaimed. "There's no bumblebee--nor any
other sort of bee--anywhere near the pumpkin."
</p><p>"There was one there only a moment ago," old Spot remarked with a sly
smile.
</p><p>"I didn't see him," said Buster Bumblebee, looking much puzzled.
</p><p>"Well, _I_ did," old Spot replied. "And that proves that I'm right."
</p><p>Buster Bumblebee could think of no good retort to make at that moment.
And since the odd buzzing had stopped, and all three fiddlers were tuning
up for more dance music, in his excitement Buster forgot all about the
raising bee again, the bumblebee in the pumpkin, and even his dispute
with old dog Spot.
</p><p>So the dance went on. And at last, late in the afternoon, the people
suddenly remembered that they had to go home to milk the cows. Then the
fiddlers put away their fiddles; for the dance had come to an end. And
Buster Bumblebee was extremely sorry that it was so.
</p><p>Now, Jimmy Rabbit had agreed to meet Buster at the hollyhock hedge
between the flower and the vegetable garden, on the morning following the
great gathering of Farmer Green's friends. At least, that was what Buster
Bumblebee thought.
</p><p>Unfortunately, however, the matter had slipped entirely from Jimmy
Rabbit's mind. And although Buster went to the meeting-place each
morning, he failed to find his long-eared friend there.
</p><p>Luckily it was a pleasant spot in which to wait. So each day Buster
breakfasted upon the flowers. And if it hadn't been for just one thing he
wouldn't have cared much whether Jimmy Rabbit ever came back to meet him
or not. But Buster did want to tell Jimmy Rabbit that he had been
mistaken about the raising bee. Jimmy Rabbit knew so much--he was always
explaining things to people with such a knowing air--that Buster
Bumblebee thought it would do Jimmy a world of good to understand that
for once he was wrong.
</p><p>If Buster had only visited the garden earlier in the morning he would
have found Jimmy Rabbit easily enough. But Buster did not like to go
abroad much until the sun had had a chance to dry the dew, for it was
hard for him to fly when his wings were wet.
</p><p>On the other hand, Jimmy Rabbit usually went to the garden at dawn,
because he had an idea that lettuce was crisper and tasted better while
the cool dew still clung to it. But at last there came a morning when
Jimmy was so late and Buster was so early in reaching the garden that
their breakfast hours came at the same time.
