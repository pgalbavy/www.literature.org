<p>To an American, accustomed to getting things done first and talking
about it afterward, there is nothing so subtly irritating as the Old
World formalism, the polite evasiveness of the Mexicans; and yet, at
times, they can speak to the point with the best of us.
</p><p>For sixty days Don Cipriano Aragon had smiled and smiled and then,
suddenly, as the last day of their mining permit passed by and there
was no record of a denouncement by Cruz Mendez, he appeared at the
Eagle Tail mine with a pistol in his belt and a triumphant sneer on his
lips.
</p><p>Behind him rode four Mexicans, fully armed, and they made no reply to
De Lancey's polite "_Buenos días!_"
</p><p>"Take your poor things," burst out Aragon, pointing contemptuously at
their tent and beds, "and your low, <u>pelado</u> Mexican--and go! This mine
no longer stands in the name of Cruz Mendez, and I want it for myself!
No, not a word!" he cried, as De Lancey opened his mouth to explain.
"Nothing! Only go!"
</p><p>"No, <u>señor</u>," said Hooker, dropping his hand to his six-shooter which
hung low by his leg and stepping forward, "we will not go!"
</p><p>"What?" stormed Aragon. "You--"
</p><p>"Be careful there!" warned Bud, suddenly fixing his eyes on one of the
four retainers. "If you touch that gun I'll kill you!"
</p><p>There was a pause, in which the Mexicans sat frozen to their saddles,
and then De Lancey broke the silence.
</p><p>"You must not think, Señor Aragon," he began, speaking with a certain
bitterness, "that you can carry your point like this. My friend here is
a Texan, and if your men stir he will kill them. But there is a law in
this country for every man--what is it that you want?"
</p><p>"I want this mining claim," shouted Aragon, "that you have so unjustly
taken from me through that scoundrel Mendez! And I want you to step
aside, so that I can set up my monuments and take possession of it."
</p><p>"The Señor Aragon has not been to the <u>agente mineral</u> to-day,"
suggested De Lancey suavely. "If he had taken the trouble he would
not--"
</p><p>"Enough!" cried Aragon, still trying to carry it off cavalierly. "I
sent my servant to the mining agent yesterday and he reported that the
permit had lapsed."
</p><p>"If he had taken the pains to inquire for new permits, however,"
returned De Lancey, "he would have found that one has been issued to
me. I am now a Mexican citizen, like yourself."
</p><p>"_You!_" screamed Aragon, his eyes bulging with astonishment; and then,
finding himself tricked, he turned suddenly upon one of his retainers
and struck him with his whip.
</p><p>"Son of a goat!" he stormed. "Pig! Is this the way you obey my orders?"
</p><p>But though he raved and scolded, he had gone too far, and there was no
putting the blame on his servant. In his desire to humiliate the hated
gringos he had thrown down all his guards, and even De Lancey saw all
too clearly what his intentions in the matter had been.
</p><p>"Spare your cursing, Señor Aragon," he said, "and after this," he
added, "you can save your pretty words, too--for somebody else. We
shall remain here and hold our property."
</p><p>"Ha! You <u>Americanos</u>!" exclaimed Aragon, as he chewed bitterly on his
defeat. "You will rob us of everything--even our government. So you
are a Mexican citizen, eh? You must value this barren mine very highly
to give up the protection of your government. But perhaps you are
acquainted with a man named Kruger?" he sneered.
</p><p>"<u>He</u> would sell his honor any time to defraud a Mexican of his rights,
and I doubt not it was he who sent you here. Yes, I have known it from
the first--but I will fool him yet!
</p><p>"So you are a Mexican citizen, Señor De Lancey? <u>Bien</u>, then you shall
pay the full price of your citizenship. Before our law you are now no
more than that poor <u>pelado</u>, Mendez. You cannot appeal now to your
consul at Gadsden--you are only a Mexican! Very well!"
</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders and smiled significantly.
</p><p>"No," retorted De Lancey angrily; "you are right--I cannot appeal to my
government! But let me tell you something, Señor Mexicano! An American
needs no government to protect him--he has his gun, and that is enough!"
</p><p>"Yes," added Bud, who had caught the drift of the last, "and he has
his friends, too; don't forget that!" He strode over toward Aragon and
menaced him with a threatening finger.
</p><p>"If anything happens to my friend," he hissed, "you will have <u>me</u>
to whip! And now, <u>señor</u>," he added, speaking in the idiom of the
country, "go with God--and do not come back!"
</p><p>"Pah!" spat back Aragon, his hate for the pushing foreigner showing in
every glance; "I will beat you yet! And I pray God the <u>revoltosos</u>
come this way, if they take the full half of my cattle--so long as they
get you two!"
</p><p>"Very well," nodded Bud as Aragon and his men turned away, "but be
careful you do not send any!
</p><p>"Good!" he continued, smiling grimly at the pallid Phil; "now we got
him where we want him--out in the open. And I'll just remember them
four <u>paisanos</u> he had with him--they're his handy men, the boys with
nerve--and don't never let one of 'em catch you out after dark."
</p><p>De Lancey sat down on a rock and wiped his face.
</p><p>"Heavens, Bud," he groaned, "I never would have believed it of him--I
thought he was on the square. But it just goes to prove the old
saying--every Mexican has got a streak of yellow in him somewhere. All
you've got to do is to trust him long enough and you'll find it out.
Well, we're hep to Mr. Aragon, all right!"
</p><p>"I have never seen one of these polite, palavering Mexicans yet,"
observed Bud sagely, "that wasn't crooked. And this feller Aragon is
mean, to boot. But that's a game," he added, "that two can play at. I
don't know how you feel, Phil, but we been kinder creeping and slipping
around so long that I'm all cramped up inside. Never suffered more in
my life than the last sixty days--being polite to that damn' Mexican.
Now it's our turn. Are you game?"
</p><p>"Count me in!" cried De Lancey, rising from his rock. "What's the play?"
</p><p>"Well, we'll go into town pretty soon," grinned Bud, "and if I run
across old Aragon, or any one of them four bad Mexicans, I'm going to
make a show. And as for that big brindle dog of his--well, he's sure
going to get roped and drugged if he don't mend his ways. Come on,
let's ketch up our horses and go in for a little time."
</p><p>"I'll go you!" agreed Phil with enthusiasm, and half an hour later,
each on his favorite horse, they were clattering down the cañon. At the
turn of the trail, where it swung into the Aragon lane, Bud took down
his rope and smiled in anticipation.
</p><p>"You go on ahead," he said, shaking out his loop, "and I'll try to put
the catgut on Brindle."
</p><p>"Off like a flash!" answered De Lancey, and, putting the spurs to
his fiery bay, he went dashing down the street, scattering chickens
and hogs in all directions. Behind came Bud, rolling jovially in his
saddle, and as the dogs rushed out after his pardner he twirled his
loop once and laid it skilfully across the big brindle's back. But
roping dogs is a difficult task at best, and Bud was out of practise.
The sudden blow struck Brindle to the ground and the loop came away
unfilled. The Texan laughed, shifting in his saddle.
</p><p>"Come again!" commented Bud, leaning sidewise as he coiled his rope,
and as the womenfolk and idlers came rushing to see what had happened
he turned Copper Bottom in his tracks and came back like a streak of
light.
</p><p>"Look out, you ugly man's dog!" he shouted, whirling his rope as he
rode; and then, amid a chorus of indignant protests, he chased the
yelping Brindle down the lane and through a hole in the fence. Then,
with no harm done, he rode back up the street, smiling amiably and
looking for more dogs to rope.
</p><p>In the door of the store stood Aragon, pale with fury, but Bud appeared
not to see him. His eyes were turned rather toward the house where, on
the edge of the veranda, Gracia Aragon and her mother stood staring at
his antics.
</p><p>"Good morning to you, ladies!" he saluted, taking off his sombrero with
a flourish. "Lovely weather, ain't it?" And with his tongue in his
cheek and a roguish glance at Aragon, who was stricken dumb by this
last effrontery, he went rollicking after his pardner, sending back a
series of joyous yips.
</p><p>"Now that sure does me good," he confided to Phil, as they rode down
between cottonwoods and struck into the muddy creek. "No sense in it,
but it gets something out of my system that has kept me from feeling
glad. Did you see me bowing to the ladies? Some class to that bow--no?
You want to look out--I got my eye on that gal, and I'm sure a hard one
to head. Only thing is, I wouldn't like the old man for a father-in-law
the way matters stand between us now."
</p><p>He laughed boisterously at this witticism, and the little Mexican
children, playing among the willows, crouched and lay quiet like
rabbits. Along the sides of the rocky hills, where the peons had their
mud-and-rock houses, mothers came anxiously to open doors; and as
they jogged along up the river the Chinese gardeners, working in each
separate nook and eddy of the storm-washed creek-bed, stopped grubbing
to gaze at them inquiringly.
</p><p>"Wonder what's the matter with them chinks?" observed Bud, when his
happiness had ceased to effervesce. "They sit up like a village of
prairie-dogs! Whole country seems to be on the rubber-neck. Must be
something doing."
</p><p>"That's right," agreed Phil. "Did you notice how those peons scattered
when I rode down the street? Maybe there's been some <u>insurrectos</u>
through. But say--listen!"
</p><p>He stopped his horse, and in the silence a bugle-call came down the
wind from the direction of Fortuna.
</p><p>"Soldiers!" he said. "Now where did they come from? I was in Fortuna
day before yesterday, and--well, look at that!"
</p><p>From the point of the hill just ahead of them a line of soldiers came
into view, marching two abreast, with a mounted officer in the lead.
</p><p>"Aha!" exclaimed Bud with conviction; "they've started something down
below. This is that bunch of Federals that we saw drilling up at Agua
Negra."
</p><p>"Yep," admitted De Lancey regretfully; "I guess you're right for
once--the open season for rebels has begun."
</p><p>They drew out of the road and let them pass--a long, double line of
shabby infantrymen, still wearing their last-year's straw hats and
summer uniforms and trudging along in flapping sandals.
</p><p>In front were two men bearing lanterns, to search out the way by night;
slatternly women, the inevitable camp-followers, trotted along at the
sides with their bundles and babies; and as the little brown men from
Zacatecas, each burdened with his heavy gun and a job lot of belts and
packs, shuffled patiently past the Americans, they flashed the whites
of their eyes and rumbled a chorus of "Adios!"
</p><p>"_Adios, Americanos!_" they called, gazing enviously at their fine
horses, and Phil in his turn touched his hat and wished them all
God-speed.
</p><p>"Poor devils!" he murmured, as the last tottering camp-followers, laden
with their burdens, brought up the rear and a white-skinned Spanish
officer saluted from his horse. "What do those little <u>pelónes</u> know
about liberty and justice, or the game that is being played? Wearing
the same uniforms that they had when they fought for Diaz, and now they
are fighting for Madero. Next year they may be working for Orozco or
Huerta or Salazar."
</p><p>"Sure," muttered Bud; "but that ain't the question. If the's rebels in
the hills, where do we get off?"
