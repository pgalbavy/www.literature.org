<p><em>THE </em>difficulty was not only that Gerald had got the
ring on and couldn't get it off, and was therefore invisible,
but that Mabel, who had been invisible and therefore possible
to be smuggled into the house, was now plain to be seen and impossible
for smuggling purposes.</p>

<p>The children would have not only to account for the apparent
absence of one of themselves, but for the obvious presence of
a perfect stranger.</p>

<p>"I can't go back to aunt. I can't and I won't," said Mabel firmly,
"not if I was visible twenty times over."</p>

<p>"She'd smell a rat if you did." Gerald owned&mdash;"about the motor-car,
I mean, and the adopting lady. And what we're to say to Mademoiselle
about you<hr>!" He tugged at the ring.</p>

<p>"Suppose you told the truth," said Mabel meaningly.</p>

<p>"She wouldn't believe it," said Cathy; "or, if she did, she'd
go stark, staring, raving mad."</p>

<p>"No," said Gerald's voice, "we daren't <em>tell</em> her. But
she's really rather decent. Let's ask her to let you stay the
night because it's too late for you to get home."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Jimmy, "but what about you?"</p>

<p>"I shall go to bed," said Gerald, "with a bad headache. Oh, <em>that's</em>
not a lie! I've got one right enough. It's the sun, I think. I
know blacklead attracts the concentration of the sun."</p>

<p>"More likely the pears and the gingerbread," said Jimmy unkindly.
"Well, let's get along. I wish it was me was invisible. I'd do
something different from going to bed with a silly headache, I
know that."</p>

<p>"What would you do?" asked the voice of Gerald just behind him.</p>

<p>"Do keep in one place, you silly cuckoo!" said Jimmy. "You make
me feel all jumpy." He had indeed jumped rather violently. "Here,
walk between Cathy and me."</p>

<p>"What <em>would</em> you do?" repeated Gerald, from that apparently
unoccupied position.</p>

<p>"I'd be a burglar," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>Cathy and Mabel in one breath reminded him how wrong burgling
was, and Jimmy replied:</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;a detective."</p>

<p>"There's got to be something to detect before you can begin detectiving,"
said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Detectives don't always detect things," said Jimmy, very truly.
"If I couldn't be any other kind I'd be a baffled detective. You
could be one all right, and have no end of larks just the same.
Why don't you do it?"</p>

<p>"It's exactly what I <em>am</em> going to do," said Gerald. "We'll
go round by the police-station and see what they've got in the
way of crimes."</p>

<p>They did, and read the notices on the board outside. Two dogs
had been lost, a purse, and a portfolio of papers "of no value
to any but the owner." Also Houghton Grange had been broken into
and a quantity of silver plate stolen. "Twenty pounds reward offered
for any information that may lead to the recovery of the missing
property."</p>

<p>"That burglary's my lay," said Gerald; "I'll detect that. Here
comes Johnson," he added; "he's going off duty. Ask him about
it." The fell detective, being invisible, was unable to pump the
constable, but the young brother of our hero made the inquiries
in quite a creditable manner. "Be creditable, Jimmy."</p>

<p>Jimmy hailed the constable.</p>

<p>"Halloa, Johnson!" he said.</p>

<p>And Johnson replied: "Halloa, young shaver!"</p>

<p>"Shaver yourself!" said Jimmy, but without malice.</p>

<p>"What are you doing this time of night?" the constable asked
jocosely. "All the dicky birds is gone to their little nesteses."</p>

<p>"We've been to the fair," said Kathleen. "There was a conjurer
there. I wish you could have seen him."</p>

<p>"Heard about him," said Johnson; "all fake, you know. The quickness
of the 'and deceives the hi."</p>

<p>Such is fame. Gerald, standing in the shadow, jingled the loose
money in his pocket to console himself.</p>

<p>"What's that?" the policeman asked quickly.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>WHAT'S THAT?" THE POLICEMAN ASKED QUICKLY</em>.]</p>

<p>"Our money jingling," said Jimmy, with perfect truth.</p>

<p>"It's well to be some people," Johnson remarked; "wish I'd got
my pockets full to jingle with."</p>

<p>"Well, why haven't you?" asked Mabel. "Why don't you get that
twenty pounds reward?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why I don't. Because in this 'ere realm of liberty,
and Britannia ruling the waves, you aint allowed to arrest a chap
on suspicion, even if you know puffickly well who done the job."</p>

<p>"What a shame!" said Jimmy warmly. "And who <em>do</em> you think
did it?"</p>

<p>"I don't think &mdash;I know." Johnson's voice was ponderous
as his boots. "It's a man what's known to the police on account
of a heap o' crimes he's done, but we never can't bring it 'ome
to 'im, nor yet get sufficient evidence to convict."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jimmy, "when I've left school I'll come to you and
be apprenticed, and be a detective. Just now I think we'd better
get home and detect our supper. Good-night!"</p>

<p>They watched the policeman's broad form disappear through the
swing door of the police-station; and as it settled itself into
quiet again the voice of Gerald was heard complaining bitterly.</p>

<p>"You've no more brains than a halfpenny bun," he said: "no details
about how and when the silver was taken."</p>

<p>"But he told us he knew," Jimmy urged.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all you've got out of him. A silly policeman's silly
idea. Go home and detect your precious supper! It's all you're
fit for."</p>

<p>"What'll you do about supper?" Mabel asked.</p>

<p>"Buns!" said Gerald, "halfpenny buns. They'll make me think of
my dear little brother and sister. Perhaps you've got enough sense
to buy buns? I can't go into a shop in this state."</p>

<p>"Don't you be so disagreeable," said Mabel with spirit. "We did
our best. If I were Cathy you should whistle for your nasty buns."</p>

<p>"If you were Cathy the gallant young detective would have left
home long ago. Better the cabin of a tramp steamer than the best
family mansion that's got a brawling sister in it," said Gerald.
"You're a bit of an outsider at present, my gentle maiden. Jimmy
and Cathy know well enough when their bold leader is chaffing
and when he isn't."</p>

<p>"Not when we can't see your face we don't," said Cathy, in tones
of relief. "I really thought you were in a flaring wax, and so
did Jimmy, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, rot!" said Gerald. "Come on! This way to the bun shop."</p>

<p>They went. And it was while Cathy and Jimmy were in the shop
and the others were gazing through the glass at the jam tarts
and Swiss rolls and Victoria sandwiches and Bath buns under the
spread yellow muslin in the window, that Gerald discoursed in
Mabel's ear of the plans and hopes of one entering on a detective
career.</p>

<p>"I shall keep my eyes open to-night, I can tell you," he began.
"I shall keep my eyes skinned, and no jolly error. The invisible
detective may not only find out about the purse and the silver,
but detect some crime that isn't even done yet. And I shall hang
about until I see some suspicious-looking characters leave the
town, and follow them furtively and catch them red-handed, with
their hands full of priceless jewels, and hand them over."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Mabel, so sharply and suddenly that Gerald was roused
from his dream to express sympathy.</p>

<p>"Pain?" he said quite kindly. "It's the apples&mdash;they <em>were</em>
rather hard."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not that," said Mabel very earnestly. "Oh, how awful!
I never thought of that before."</p>

<p>"Never thought of <em>what</em>?" Gerald asked impatiently.</p>

<p>"The window."</p>

<p>"What window?"</p>

<p>"The panelled-room window. At home, you know&mdash;at the castle.
That settles it &mdash;I <em>must</em> go home. We left it open
and the shutters as well, and all the jewels and things there.
Auntie'll never go in; she never does. That settles it; I <em>must</em>
go home&mdash;now&mdash;this minute."</p>

<p>Here the others issued from the shop, bun-bearing, and the situation
was hastily explained to them.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "I <em><em>MUST</em> GO HOME&mdash;NOW &</em>mdash;<em>THIS
MINUTE</em>."]</p>

<p>"So you see I must go," Mabel ended.</p>

<p>And Kathleen agreed that she must.</p>

<p>But Jimmy said he didn't see what good it would do. "Because
the key's inside the door, anyhow."</p>

<p>"She <em>will</em> be cross," said Mabel sadly. "She'll have
to get the gardeners to get a ladder and<hr>"</p>

<p>"Hooray!" said Gerald. "Here's me! Nobler and more secret than
gardeners or ladders was the invisible Jerry. I'll climb in at
the window&mdash;it's all ivy, I know I could&mdash;and shut the window
and the shutters all sereno, put the key back on the nail, and
slip out unperceived the back way, threading my way through the
maze of unconscious retainers. There'll be plenty of time. I don't
suppose burglars begin their fell work until the night is far
advanced."</p>

<p>"Won't you be afraid?" Mabel asked. "Will it be safe&mdash;suppose
you were caught?"</p>

<p>"As houses. I can't be," Gerald answered, and wondered that the
question came from Mabel and not from Kathleen, who was usually
inclined to fuss a little annoyingly about the danger and folly
of adventures.</p>

<p>But all Kathleen said was, "Well, goodbye: we'll come and see
you to-morrow, Mabel. The floral temple at half-past ten. I hope
you won't get into an awful row about the motor-car lady."</p>

<p>"Let's detect our supper now," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"All right," said Gerald a little bitterly. It is hard to enter
on an adventure like this and to find the sympathetic interest
of years suddenly cut off at the meter, as it were. Gerald felt
that he ought, at a time like this, to have been the centre of
interest. And he wasn't. They could actually talk about supper.
Well, let them. He didn't care! He spoke with sharp sternness:
"Leave the pantry window undone for me to get in by when I've
done my detecting. Come on, Mabel." He caught her hand. "Bags
I the buns, though," he added, by a happy afterthought, and snatching
the bag, pressed it on Mabel, and the sound of four boots echoed
on the pavement of the High Street as the outlines of the running
Mabel grew small with distance.</p>

<p>= = = = =</p>

<p>Mademoiselle was in the drawing-room. She was sitting by the
window in the waning light reading letters.</p>

<p>"Ah, <em>vous voici</em>!" she said unintelligibly. "You are
again late; and my little Gerald, where is he?"</p>

<p>This was an awful moment. Jimmy's detective scheme had not included
any answer to this inevitable question. The silence was unbroken
till Jimmy spoke.</p>

<p>"He <em>said</em> he was going to bed because he had a headache."
And this, of course, was true.</p>

<p>"This poor Gerald!" said Mademoiselle. "Is it that I should mount
him some supper?"</p>

<p>"He never eats anything when he's got one of his headaches,"
Kathleen said. And this also was the truth.</p>

<p>Jimmy and Kathleen went to bed, wholly untroubled by anxiety
about their brother, and Mademoiselle pulled out the bundle of
letters and read them amid the ruins of the simple supper.</p>

<p>= = = = =</p>

<p>"It is ripping being out late like this," said Gerald through
the soft summer dusk.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mabel, a solitary-looking figure plodding along the
high-road. "I do hope auntie won't be <em>very</em> furious."</p>

<p>"Have another bun," suggested Gerald kindly, and a sociable munching
followed.</p>

<p>It was the aunt herself who opened to a very pale and trembling
Mabel the door which is appointed for the entrances and exits
of the domestic staff at Yalding Towers. She looked over Mabel's
head first, as if she expected to see some one taller. Then a
very small voice said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aunt!"</p>

<p>The aunt started back, then made a step towards Mabel.</p>

<p>"You naughty, naughty girl!" she cried angrily; "how could you
give me such a fright? I've a good mind to keep you in bed for
a week for this, miss. Oh, Mabel, thank Heaven you're safe!" And
with that the aunt's arms went round Mabel and Mabel's round the
aunt in such a hug as they had never met in before.</p>

<p>"But you didn't seem to care a bit this morning," said Mabel,
when she had realised that her aunt really had been anxious, really
was glad to have her safe home again.</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I was there listening. Don't be angry, auntie."</p>

<p>"I feel as if I never could be angry with you again, now I've
got you safe," said the aunt surprisingly.</p>

<p>"But how was it?" Mabel asked.</p>

<p>"My dear," said the aunt impressively, "I've been in a sort of
trance. I think I must be going to be ill. I've always been fond
of you, but I didn't want to spoil you. But yesterday, about half-past
three, I was talking about you to Mr. Lewson, at the fair, and
quite suddenly I felt as if you didn't matter at all. And I felt
the same when I got your letter and when those children came.
And to-day in the middle of tea I suddenly woke up and realised
that you were gone. It was awful. I think I must be going to be
ill. Oh, Mabel, why did you do it?"</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;a joke," said Mabel feebly. And then the two went in
and the door was shut.</p>

<p>"That's most uncommon odd," said Gerald, outside; "looks like
more magic to me. I don't feel as if we'd got to the bottom of
this yet, by any manner of means. There's more about this castle
than meets the eye."</p>

<p>There certainly was. For this castle happened to be&mdash;but it would
not be fair to Gerald to tell you more about it than he knew on
that night when he went alone and invisible through the shadowy
great grounds of it to look for the open window of the panelled
room. He knew that night no more than I have told you; but as
he went along the dewy lawns and through the groups of shrubs
and trees, where pools lay like giant looking-glasses reflecting
the quiet stars, and the white limbs of statues gleamed against
a background of shadow, he began to feel&mdash;well, not excited, not
surprised, not anxious, but&mdash;different.</p>

<p>The incident of the invisible Princess had surprised, the incident
of the conjuring had excited, and the sudden decision to be a
detective had brought its own anxieties; but all these happenings,
though wonderful and unusual, had seemed to be, after all, inside
the circle of possible things&mdash;wonderful as the chemical experiments
are where two liquids poured together make fire, surprising as
legerdemain, thrilling as a juggler's display, but nothing more.
Only now a new feeling came to him as he walked through those
gardens; by day those gardens were like dreams, at night they
were like visions. He could not see his feet as he walked, but
he saw the movement of the dewy grass-blades that his feet displaced.
And he had that extraordinary feeling so difficult to describe,
and yet so real and so unforgettable&mdash;the feeling that he was
in another world, that had covered up and hidden the old world
as a carpet covers a floor. The floor was there all right, underneath,
but what he walked on was the carpet that covered it&mdash;and that
carpet was drenched in magic, as the turf was drenched in dew.</p>

<p>The feeling was very wonderful; perhaps you will feel it some
day. There are still some places in the world where it can be
felt, but they grow fewer every year.</p>

<p>The enchantment of the garden held him.</p>

<p>"I'll not go in yet," he told himself; "it's too early. And perhaps
I shall never be here at night again. I suppose it <em>is</em>
the night that makes everything look so different."</p>

<p>Something white moved under a weeping willow; white hands parted
the long, rustling leaves. A white figure came out, a creature
with horns and goat's legs and the head and arms of a boy. And
Gerald was not afraid. That was the most wonderful thing of all,
though he would never have owned it. The white thing stretched
its limbs, rolled on the grass, righted itself, and frisked away
across the lawn. Still something white gleamed under the willow;
three steps nearer and Gerald saw that it was the pedestal of
a statue&mdash;empty.</p>

<p>"They come alive," he said; and another white shape came out
of the Temple of Flora and disappeared in the laurels. "The statues
come alive."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE MOVING STONE BEAST</em>.]</p>

<p>There was a crunching of the little stones in the gravel of the
drive. Something enormously long and darkly grey came crawling
towards him, slowly, heavily. The moon came out just in time to
show its shape. It was one of those great lizards that you see
at the Crystal Palace, made in stone, of the same awful size which
they were millions of years ago when they were masters of the
world, before Man was.</p>

<p>"It can't see me," said Gerald. "I am not afraid. <em>It's</em>
come to life, too."</p>

<p>As it writhed past him he reached out a hand and touched the
side of its gigantic tail. It was of stone. It had not "come alive,"
as he had fancied, but <em>was</em> alive in its stone. It turned,
however, at the touch; but Gerald also had turned, and was running
with all his speed towards the house. Because at that stony touch
Fear had come into the garden and almost caught him. It was Fear
that he ran from, and not the moving stone beast.</p>

<p>He stood panting under the fifth window; when he had climbed
to the window-ledge by the twisted ivy that clung to the wall,
he looked back over the grey slope&mdash;there was a splashing at the
fish-pool that had mirrored the stars&mdash;the shape of the great
stone beast was wallowing in the shallows among the lily-pads.</p>

<p>Once inside the room, Gerald turned for another look. The fish-pond
lay still and dark, reflecting the moon. Through a gap in the
drooping willow the moonlight fell on a statue that stood calm
and motionless on its pedestal. Everything was in its place now
in the garden. Nothing moved or stirred.</p>

<p>"How extraordinarily rum!" said Gerald. "I shouldn't have thought
you <em>could</em> go to sleep walking through a garden and dream&mdash;like
that."</p>

<p>He shut the window, lit a match, and closed the shutters. Another
match showed him the door. He turned the key, went out, locked
the door again, hung the key on its usual nail, and crept to the
end of the passage. Here he waited, safe in his invisibility,
till the dazzle of the matches should have gone from his eyes,
and he be once more able to find his way by the moonlight that
fell in bright patches on the floor through the barred, unshuttered
windows of the hall.</p>

<p>"Wonder where the kitchen is," said Gerald. He had quite forgotten
that he was a detective. He was only anxious to get home and tell
the others about that extraordinarily odd dream that he had had
in the gardens. "I suppose it doesn't matter <em>what</em> doors
I open. I'm invisible all right still, I suppose? Yes; can't see
my hand before my face." He held up a hand for the purpose. "Here
goes!"</p>

<p>He opened many doors, wandered into long rooms with furniture
dressed in brown holland covers that looked white in that strange
light, rooms with chandeliers hanging in big bags from the high
ceilings, rooms whose walls were alive with pictures, rooms whose
walls were deadened with rows on rows of old books, state bedrooms
in whose great plumed four-posters Queen Elizabeth had no doubt
slept. (That Queen, by the way, must have been very little at
home, for she seems to have slept in every old house in England.)
But he could not find the kitchen. At last a door opened on stone
steps that went up&mdash;there was a narrow stone passage&mdash;steps that
went down&mdash;a door with a light under it. It was, somehow, difficult
to put out one's hand to that door and open it.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Gerald told himself; "don't be an ass! Are you invisible,
or aren't you?"</p>

<p>Then he opened the door, and some one inside said something in
a sudden rough growl.</p>

<p>Gerald stood back, flattened against the wall, as a man sprang
to the doorway and flashed a lantern into the passage.</p>

<p>"All right," said the man, with almost a sob of relief. "It was
only the door swung open, it's that heavy&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"Blow the door!" said another growling voice; "blessed if I didn't
think it was a fair cop that time."</p>

<p>They closed the door again. Gerald did not mind. In fact, he
rather preferred that it should be so. He didn't like the look
of those men. There was an air of threat about them. In their
presence even invisibility seemed too thin a disguise. And Gerald
had seen as much as he wanted to see. He had seen that he had
been right about the gang. By wonderful luck&mdash;beginner's luck,
a card-player would have told him&mdash;he had discovered a burglary
on the very first night of his detective career. The men were
taking silver out of two great chests, wrapping it in rags, and
packing it in baize sacks. The door of the room was of iron six
inches thick. It was, in fact, the strong-room, and these men
had picked the lock. The tools they had done it with lay on the
floor, on a neat cloth roll, such as wood-carvers keep their chisels
in.</p>

<p>"Hurry up!" Gerald heard. "You needn't take all night over it."</p>

<p>The silver rattled slightly. "You're a rattling of them trays
like bloomin' castanets," said the gruffest voice. Gerald turned
and went away, very carefully and very quickly. And it is a most
curious thing that, though he couldn't find the way to the servants'
wing when he had nothing else to think of, yet now, with his mind
full, so to speak, of silver forks and silver cups, and the question
of who might be coming after him down those twisting passages,
he went straight as an arrow to the door that led from the hall
to the place he wanted to get to.</p>

<p>As he went the happenings took words in his mind.</p>

<p>"The fortunate detective," he told himself, "having succeeded
beyond his wildest dreams, himself left the spot in search of
assistance."</p>

<p>But what assistance? There were, no doubt, men in the house,
also the aunt; but he could not warn them. He was too hopelessly
invisible to carry any weight with strangers. The assistance of
Mabel would not be of much value. The police? Before they could
be got&mdash;and the getting of them presented difficulties&mdash;the burglars
would have cleared away with their sacks of silver.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE MEN WERE TAKING SILVER OUT OF TWO GREAT
CHESTS</em>.]</p>

<p>Gerald stopped and thought hard; he held his head with both hands
to do it. You know the way&mdash;the same as you sometimes do for simple
equations or the dates of the battles of the Civil War.</p>

<p>Then with pencil, note-book, a window-ledge, and all the cleverness
he could find at the moment, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>You know the room where the silver is. Burglars<br/>
are burgling it, the thick door is picked. Send a<br/>
man for police. I will follow the burglars if they<br/>
get away ere police arrive on the spot.</em>"

</p>
</div>
<p>He hesitated a moment, and ended&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>From a Friend&mdash;this is not a sell.</em>"

</p>
</div>
<p>This letter, tied tightly round a stone by means of a shoe-lace,
thundered through the window of the room where Mabel and her aunt,
in the ardour of reunion, were enjoying a supper of unusual charm&mdash;stewed
plums, cream, sponge-cakes, custard in cups, and cold bread-and-butter
pudding.</p>

<p>Gerald, in hungry invisibility, looked wistfully at the supper
before he threw the stone. He waited till the shrieks had died
away, saw the stone picked up, the warning letter read.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the aunt, growing calmer. "How wicked! Of course
it's a hoax."</p>

<p>"Oh! do send for the police, like he says," wailed Mabel.</p>

<p>"Like who says?" snapped the aunt.</p>

<p>"Whoever it is," Mabel moaned.</p>

<p>"Send for the police at once," said Gerald, outside, in the manliest
voice he could find.</p>

<p>"You'll only blame yourself if you don't. I can't do any more
for you."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I'll set the dogs on you!" cried the aunt.</p>

<p>"Oh, auntie, <em>don't</em>!" Mabel was dancing with agitation.
"It's true &mdash;I know it's true. Do&mdash;do wake Bates!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it," said the aunt. No more did Bates
when, owing to Mabel's persistent worryings, he was awakened.
But when he had seen the paper, and had to choose whether he'd
go to the strong-room and see that there really wasn't anything
to believe or go for the police on his bicycle, he chose the latter
course.</p>

<p>When the police arrived the strong-room door stood ajar, and
the silver, or as much of it as three men could carry, was gone.</p>

<p>Gerald's note-book and pencil came into play again later on that
night. It was five in the morning before he crept into bed, tired
out and cold as a stone.</p>

<p>= = = = =</p>

<p>"Master Gerald!"&mdash;it was Eliza's voice in his ears&mdash;"it's seven
o'clock and another fine day, and there's been another burglary<hr>
My cats alive!" she screamed, as she drew up the blind and turned
towards the bed; "look at his bed, all crocked with black, and
him not there! Oh, Jimminy!" It was a scream this time. Kathleen
came running from her room; Jimmy sat up in his bed and rubbed
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Whatever is it?" Kathleen cried.</p>

<p>"I dunno when I 'ad such a turn." Eliza sat down heavily on a
box as she spoke. "First thing his bed all empty and black as
the chimley back, and him not in it, and then when I looks again
he <em>is</em> in it all the time. I must be going silly. I thought
as much when I heard them haunting angel voices yesterday morning.
But I'll tell Mam'selle of you, my lad, with your tricks, you
may rely on that. Blacking yourself all over like a dirty nigger
and crocking up your clean sheets and pillow-cases. It's going
back of beyond, this is."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Gerald slowly; "I'm going to tell you something."</p>

<p>Eliza simply snorted, and that was rude of her; but then, she
had had a shock and had not got over it.</p>

<p>"Can you keep a secret?" asked Gerald, very earnest through the
grey of his partly rubbed-off blacklead.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eliza.</p>

<p>"Then keep it and I'll give you two bob."</p>

<p>"But what was you going to tell me?"</p>

<p>"That. About the two bob and the secret. And you keep your mouth
shut."</p>

<p>"I didn't ought to take it," said Eliza, holding out her hand
eagerly. "Now you get up, and mind you wash all the corners, Master
Gerald."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad you're safe," said Kathleen, when Eliza had
gone.</p>

<p>"You didn't seem to care much last night," said Gerald coldly.</p>

<p>"I can't think how I let you go. I didn't care last night. But
when I woke this morning and remembered!"</p>

<p>"There, that'll do&mdash;it'll come off on you," said Gerald through
the reckless hugging of his sister.</p>

<p>"How did you get visible?" Jimmy asked.</p>

<p>"It just happened when she called me&mdash;the ring came off."</p>

<p>"Tell us all about everything," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Gerald mysteriously.</p>
