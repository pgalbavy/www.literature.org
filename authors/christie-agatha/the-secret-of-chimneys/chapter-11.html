<p>So apprehensive was Lord Caterham of being consulted by George
that he spent the whole morning making a tour of his estate. Only
the pangs of hunger drew him homeward. He also reflected that
by now the worst would surely be over.</p>

<p>He sneaked into the house quietly by a small side door. From
there he slipped neatly into his sanctum. He flattered himself
that his entrance had not been observed, but there he was mistaken.
The watchful Tredwell let nothing escape him. He presented himself
at the door.</p>

<p>"You’ll excuse me, my lord——"</p>

<p>"What is it, Tredwell?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Lomax, my lord, is anxious to see you in the library as
soon as you return."</p>

<p>By this delicate method Tredwell conveyed that Lord Caterham
had not yet returned unless he chose to say so.</p>

<p>Lord Caterham sighed, and then rose.</p>

<p>"I suppose it will have to be done sooner or later. In the library,
you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>Sighing again. Lord Caterham crossed the wide spaces of his ancestral
home, and reached the library door. The door was locked. As he
rattled the handle, it was unlocked from inside, opened a little
way, and the face of George Lomax appeared, peering out suspiciously.</p>

<p>His face changed when he saw who it was.</p>

<p>"Ah, Caterham, come in. We were just wondering what had become
of you."</p>

<p>Murmuring something vague about duties on the estate, repairs
for tenants, Lord Caterham sidled in apologetically. There were
two other men in the room. One was Colonel Melrose, the Chief
Constable. The other was a squarely built middle-aged man with
a face so singularly devoid of expression as to be quite remarkable.</p>

<p>"Superintendent Battle arrived half an hour ago," explained George.
"He has been round with Inspector Badgworthy, and seen Dr. Cartwright.
He now wants a few facts from us."</p>

<p>They all sat down, after Lord Caterham had greeted Melrose and
acknowledged his introduction to Superintendent Battle.</p>

<p>"I need hardly tell you, Battle," said George, "that this is
a case in which we must use the utmost discretion."</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded in an offhand manner that rather took
Lord Caterham’s fancy.</p>

<p>"That will be all right, Mr. Lomax. But no concealments from
us. I understand that the dead gentleman was called Count Stanislaus—at
least, that that is the name by which the household knew him.
Now was that his real name?"</p>

<p>"It was not."</p>

<p>"What was his real name?"</p>

<p>"Prince Michael of Herzoslovakia."</p>

<p>Battle’s eyes opened just a trifle, otherwise he gave no sign.</p>

<p>"And what, if I may ask the question, was the purpose of his
visit here? Just pleasure?"</p>

<p>"There was a further object, Battle. All this in the strictest
confidence of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Mr. Lomax."</p>

<p>"Colonel Melrose?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Prince Michael was here for the express purpose
of meeting Mr. Herman Isaacstein. A loan was to be arranged on
certain terms."</p>

<p>"Which were?"</p>

<p>"I do not know the exact details. Indeed, they had not yet been
arranged. But in the event of coming to the throne, Prince Michael
pledged himself to grant certain oil concessions to those companies
in which Mr. Isaacstein is interested. The British Government
was prepared to support the claim of Prince Michael to the throne
in view of his pronounced British sympathies."</p>

<p>"Well," said Superintendent Battle, "I don’t suppose I need go
further into it than that. Prince Michael wanted the money, Mr.
Isaacstein wanted oil, and the British Government was ready to
do the heavy father. Just one question. Was anyone else after
those concessions?"</p>

<p>"I believe an American group of financiers had made overtures
to His Highness."</p>

<p>"And been turned down, eh?"</p>

<p>But George refused to be drawn.</p>

<p>"Prince Michael’s sympathies were entirely pro-British," he repeated.</p>

<p>Superintendent Battle did not press the point.</p>

<p>"Lord Caterham, I understand that this is what occurred yesterday.
You met Prince Michael in town and journeyed down here in company
with him. The Prince was accompanied by his valet, a Herzoslovakian
named Boris Anchoukoff, but his equerry, Captain Andrassy, remained
in town. The Prince, on arriving, declared himself greatly fatigued,
and retired to the apartments set aside for him. Dinner was served
to him there, and he did not meet the other members of the house
party. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>"Quite correct."</p>

<p>"This morning a housemaid discovered the body at approximately
7.45 <em>A.M. </em>Dr. Cartwright examined the dead man and found
that death was the result of a bullet fired from a revolver. No
revolver was found, and no one in the house seems to have heard
the shot. On the other hand the dead man’s wrist watch was smashed
by the fall, and marks the crime as having been committed at exactly
a quarter to twelve. Now what time did you retire to bed last
night?"</p>

<p>"We went early. Somehow or other the party didn’t seem to ‘go’
if you know what I mean, superintendent. We went up about half-past
ten, I should say."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Now I will ask you, Lord Caterham, to give me a description
of all the people staying in the house."</p>

<p>"But, excuse me, I thought the fellow who did it came from outside?"</p>

<p>Superintendent Battle smiled.</p>

<p>"I dare say he did. I dare say he did. But all the same I’ve
got to know who was in the house. Matter of routine, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, there was Prince Michael and his valet and Mr. Herman
Isaacstein. You know all about them. Then there was Mr. Eversleigh——"</p>

<p>"Who works in my department," put in George condescendingly.</p>

<p>"And who was acquainted with the real reason of Prince Michael’s
being here?"</p>

<p>"No, I should not say that," replied George weightily. "Doubtless
he realized that something was in the wind, but I did not think
it necessary to take him fully into my confidence."</p>

<p>"I see. Will you go on, Lord Caterham?"</p>

<p>"Let me see, there was Mr. Hiram Fish."</p>

<p>"Who is Mr. Hiram Fish?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Fish is an American. He brought over a letter of introduction
from Mr. Lucius Gott—you’ve heard of Lucius Gott?"</p>

<p>Superintendent Battle smiled acknowledgment. Who had not heard
of Lucius C. Gott, the multi-millionaire?</p>

<p>"He was specially anxious to see my first editions. Mr. Gott’s
collection is, of course, unequalled, but I’ve got several treasures
myself. This Mr. Fish was an enthusiast. Mr. Lomax had suggested
that I ask one or two extra people down here this week-end to
make things seem more natural, so I took the opportunity of asking
Mr. Fish. That finishes the men. As for the ladies, there is only
Mrs. Revel—and I expect she brought a maid or something like that.
Then there was my daughter, and of course the children and their
nurses and governesses and all the servants."</p>

<p>Lord Caterham paused and took a breath.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the detective. "A mere matter of routine, but
necessary as such."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt, I suppose," asked George ponderously, "that
the murderer entered by the window?"</p>

<p>Battle paused for a minute before replying slowly.</p>

<p>"There were footsteps leading up to the window, and footsteps
leading away from it. A car stopped outside the park at 11.40
last night. At twelve o’clock a young man arrived at the <em>Jolly
Cricketers</em> in a car, and engaged a room. He put his boots
outside to be cleaned—they were very wet and muddy, as though
he had been walking through the long grass in the park."</p>

<p>George leant forward eagerly.</p>

<p>"Could not the boots be compared with the footprints?"</p>

<p>"They were."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"They exactly correspond."</p>

<p>"That settles it," cried George. "We have the murderer. The young
man—what is his name, by the way?"</p>

<p>"At the inn he gave the name of Anthony Cade."</p>

<p>"This Anthony Cade must be pursued at once, and arrested."</p>

<p>"You won’t need to pursue him," said Superintendent Battle.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he’s still there."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Curious, isn’t it?"</p>

<p>Colonel Melrose eyed him keenly.</p>

<p>"What’s in your mind, Battle? Out with it."</p>

<p>"I just say it’s curious, that’s all. Here’s a young man who
ought to cut and run, but he doesn’t cut and run. He stays here,
and gives us every facility for comparing footmarks."</p>

<p>"What do you think, then?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know what to think. And that’s a very disturbing state
of mind."</p>

<p>"Do you imagine——" began Colonel Melrose, but broke off as a
discreet knock came at the door.</p>

<p>George rose and went to it. Tredwell, inwardly suffering from
having to knock at doors in this low fashion, stood dignified
upon the threshold, and addressed his master.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, my lord, but a gentleman wishes to see you on urgent
and important business, connected, I understand, with this morning’s
tragedy."</p>

<p>"What’s his name?" asked Battle suddenly.</p>

<p>"His name, sir, is Mr. Anthony Cade, but he said it wouldn’t
convey anything to anybody."</p>

<p>It seemed to convey something to the four men present. They all
sat up in varying degrees of astonishment.</p>

<p>Lord Caterham began to chuckle.</p>

<p>"I’m really beginning to enjoy myself. Show him in, Tredwell.
Show him in at once."</p>
