<p>I do not think I was surprised at the news I read in <em>The
Times</em> next morning.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Lumley had died suddenly in the night of heart failure,
and the newspapers woke up to the fact that we had been entertaining
a great man unawares.  There was an obituary in "leader" type
of nearly two columns.  He had been older than I thought&mdash;close
on seventy&mdash;and <em>The Times</em> spoke of him as a man who might
have done anything he pleased in public life, but had chosen to
give to a small coterie of friends what was due to the country. 
I read of his wit and learning, his amazing connoisseurship, his
social gifts, his personal charm.  According to the writer, he
was the finest type of cultivated amateur, a Beckford with more
than a Beckford's wealth and none of his folly.  Large private
charities were hinted at, and a hope was expressed that some part
at least of his collections might come to the nation.</p>

<p>The halfpenny papers said the same thing in their own way.  One
declared he reminded it of Atticus, another of Maecenas, another
of Lord Houghton.  There must have been a great run on biographical
dictionaries in the various offices.  Chapman's own particular
rag said that, although this kind of philanthropist was a dilettante
and a back-number, yet Mr. Lumley was a good specimen of the class
and had been a true friend to the poor.  I thought Chapman would
have a fit when he read this.  After that he took in the <em>Morning
Post</em>.</p>

<p>It was no business of mine to explode the myth.  Indeed I couldn't
even if I had wanted to, for no one would have believed me unless
I produced proofs, and these proofs were not to be made public.
Besides I had an honest compunction.  He had had, as he expressed
it, a good run for his money, and I wanted the run to be properly
rounded off.</p>

<p>Three days later I went to the funeral.  It was a wonderful occasion.
Two eminent statesmen were among the pallbearers, Royalty was
represented, and there were wreaths from learned societies and
scores of notable people.  It was a queer business to listen to
that stately service which was never read over stranger dust. 
I was thinking all the time of the vast subterranean machine which
he had controlled, and which now was so much old iron.  I could
dimly imagine what his death meant to the hosts who had worked
blindly at his direction.  He was a Napoleon who left no Marshals
behind him.  From the Power-House came no wreaths or newspaper
tributes, but I knew that it had lost its power....</p>

<p><em>De mortuis</em>, etc.  My task was done, and it only remained
to get Pitt-Heron home.</p>

<p>Of the three people in London besides myself who knew the story
&mdash;Macgillivray, Chapman and Felix&mdash;the two last might be
trusted to be silent, and Scotland Yard is not in the habit of
publishing its information.  Tommy, of course, must some time
or other be told; it was his right; but I knew that Tommy would
never breathe a word of it.  I wanted Charles to believe that
his secret died with Lumley, for otherwise I don't think he would
have ever come back to England.</p>

<p>The thing took some arranging, for we could not tell him directly
about Lumley's death without giving away the fact that we knew
of the connection between the two.  We had to approach it by a
roundabout road.  I got Felix to arrange to have the news telegraphed
to and inserted by special order in a Russian paper which Charles
could not avoid seeing.</p>

<p>The device was successful.  Calling at Portman Square a few days
later I learned from Ethel Pitt-Heron's glowing face that her
troubles were over.  That same evening a cable to me from Tommy
announced the return of the wanderers.</p>

<p>It was the year of the Chilian Arbitration, in which I held a
junior brief for the British Government, and that and the late
sitting of Parliament kept me in London after the end of the term. 
I had had a bad reaction from the excitements of the summer, and
in these days I was feeling pretty well hipped and overdone. 
On a hot August afternoon I met Tommy again.</p>

<p>The sun was shining through my Temple chambers, much as it had
done when he started.  So far as I remember the West Ham brief
which had aroused his contempt was still adorning my table.  I
was very hot and cross and fagged, for I had been engaged in the
beastly job of comparing half a dozen maps of a despicable little
bit of South American frontier.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened, and Tommy, lean and sunburnt, stalked
in.</p>

<p>"Still at the old grind," he cried, after we had shaken hands.
"Fellows like you give me a notion of the meaning of Eternity."</p>

<p>"The same uneventful sedentary life," I replied.  "Nothing happens
except that my scale of fees grows.  I suppose nothing <em>will</em>
happen till the conductor comes to take the tickets.  I shall
soon grow fat."</p>

<p>"I notice it already, my lad.  You want a bit of waking up or
you'll get a liver.  A little sensation would do you a lot of
good."</p>

<p>"And you?" I asked.  "I congratulate you on your success.  I
hear you have retrieved Pitt-Heron for his mourning family."</p>

<p>Tommy's laughing eyes grew solemn.</p>

<p>"I have had the time of my life," he said.  "It was like a chapter
out of the Arabian Nights with a dash of Fenimore Cooper.  I feel
as if I had lived years since I left England in May.  While you
have been sitting among your musty papers we have been riding
like moss-troopers and seeing men die.  Come and dine to-night
and hear about our adventures.  I can't tell you the full story,
for I don't know it, but there is enough to curl your hair."</p>

<p>Then I achieved my first and last score at the expense of Tommy
Deloraine.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "you will dine with me instead and <em>I</em> will
tell you the full story.  All the papers on the subject are over
there in my safe."</p>
