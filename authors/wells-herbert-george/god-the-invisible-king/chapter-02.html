1. HERESIES ARE MISCONCEPTIONS OF GOD
<P>
<P>
Religion is not a plant that has grown from one seed; it is like a 
lake that has been fed by countless springs.  It is a great pool of 
living water, mingled from many sources and tainted with much 
impurity.  It is synthetic in its nature; it becomes simpler from 
original complexities; the sediment subsides.
<P>
A life perfectly adjusted to its surroundings is a life without 
mentality; no judgment is called for, no inhibition, no disturbance 
of the instinctive flow of perfect reactions.  Such a life is bliss, 
or nirvana.  It is unconsciousness below dreaming.  Consciousness is 
discord evoking the will to adjust; it is inseparable from need.  At 
every need consciousness breaks into being.  Imperfect adjustments, 
needs, are the rents and tatters in the smooth dark veil of being 
through which the light of consciousness shines--the light of 
consciousness and will of which God is the sun.
<P>
So that every need of human life, every disappointment and 
dissatisfaction and call for help and effort, is a means whereby men 
may and do come to the realisation of God.
<P>
There is no cardinal need, there is no sort of experience in human 
life from which there does not come or has not come a contribution 
to men's religious ideas.  At every challenge men have to put forth 
effort, feel doubt of adequacy, be thwarted, perceive the chill 
shadow of their mortality.  At every challenge comes the possibility 
of help from without, the idea of eluding frustration, the 
aspiration towards immortality.  It is possible to classify the 
appeals men make for God under the headings of their chief system of 
effort, their efforts to understand, their fear and their struggles 
for safety and happiness, the craving of their restlessness for 
peace, their angers against disorder and their desire for the 
avenger; their sexual passions and perplexities. . . .
<P>
Each of these great systems of needs and efforts brings its own sort 
of sediment into religion.  Each, that is to say, has its own kind 
of heresy, its distinctive misapprehension of God.  It is only in 
the synthesis and mutual correction of many divergent ideas that the 
idea of God grows clear.  The effort to understand completely, for 
example, leads to the endless Heresies of Theory.  Men trip over the 
inherent infirmities of the human mind.  But in these days one does 
not argue greatly about dogma.  Almost every conceivable error about 
unity, about personality, about time and quantity and genus and 
species, about begetting and beginning and limitation and similarity 
and every kink in the difficult mind of man, has been thrust forward 
in some form of dogma.  Beside the errors of thought are the errors 
of emotion.  Fear and feebleness go straight to the Heresies that 
God is Magic or that God is Providence; restless egotism at leisure 
and unchallenged by urgent elementary realities breeds the Heresies 
of Mysticism, anger and hate call for God's Judgments, and the 
stormy emotions of sex gave mankind the Phallic God.  Those who find 
themselves possessed by the new spirit in religion, realise very 
speedily the necessity of clearing the mind of all these 
exaggerations, transferences, and overflows of feeling.  The search 
for divine truth is like gold washing; nothing is of any value until 
most has been swept away.
<P>
<P>
<P>
2. HERESIES OF SPECULATION
<P>
<P>
One sort of heresies stands apart from the rest.  It is infinitely 
the most various sort.  It includes all those heresies which result 
from wrong-headed mental elaboration, as distinguished from those 
which are the result of hasty and imperfect apprehension, the 
heresies of the clever rather than the heresies of the obtuse.  The 
former are of endless variety and complexity; the latter are in 
comparison natural, simple confusions.  The former are the errors of 
the study, the latter the superstitions that spring by the wayside, 
or are brought down to us in our social structure out of a barbaric 
past.
<P>
To the heresies of thought and speculation belong the elaborate 
doctrine of the Trinity, dogmas about God's absolute qualities, such 
odd deductions as the accepted Christian teachings about the 
virginity of Mary and Joseph, and the like.  All these things are 
parts of orthodox Christianity.  Yet none of them did Christ, even 
by the Christian account, expound or recommend.  He treated them as 
negligible.  It was left for the Alexandrians, for Alexander, for 
little, red-haired, busy, wire-pulling Athanasius to find out 
exactly what their Master was driving at, three centuries after 
their Master was dead. . . .
<P>
Men still sit at little desks remote from God or life, and rack 
their inadequate brains to meet fancied difficulties and state 
unnecessary perfections.  They seek God by logic, ignoring the 
marginal error that creeps into every syllogism.  Their conceit 
blinds them to the limitations upon their thinking.  They weave 
spider-like webs of muddle and disputation across the path by which 
men come to God.  It would not matter very much if it were not that 
simpler souls are caught in these webs.  Every great religious 
system in the world is choked by such webs; each system has its own.  
Of all the blood-stained tangled heresies which make up doctrinal 
Christianity and imprison the mind of the western world to-day, not 
one seems to have been known to the nominal founder of Christianity.  
Jesus Christ never certainly claimed to be the Messiah; never spoke 
clearly of the Trinity; was vague upon the scheme of salvation and 
the significance of his martyrdom.  We are asked to suppose that he 
left his apostles without instructions, that were necessary to their 
eternal happiness, that he could give them the Lord's Prayer but 
leave them to guess at the all-important Creed,* and that the Church 
staggered along blindly, putting its foot in and out of damnation, 
until the "experts" of Nicaea, that "garland of priests," marshalled 
by Constantine's officials, came to its rescue. . . .  From the 
conversion of Paul onward, the heresies of the intellect multiplied 
about Christ's memory and hid him from the sight of men.  We are no 
longer clear about the doctrine he taught nor about the things he 
said and did. . . .
<P>
* Even the "Apostles' Creed" is not traceable earlier than the 
fourth century.  It is manifestly an old, patched formulary.  
Rutinius explains that it was not written down for a long time, but 
transmitted orally, kept secret, and used as a sort of password 
among the elect.
<P>
We are all so weary of this theology of the Christians, we are all 
at heart so sceptical about their Triune God, that it is needless 
here to spend any time or space upon the twenty thousand different 
formulae in which the orthodox have attempted to believe in 
something of the sort.  There are several useful encyclopaedias of 
sects and heresies, compact, but still bulky, to which the curious 
may go.  There are ten thousand different expositions of orthodoxy.  
No one who really seeks God thinks of the Trinity, either the 
Trinity of the Trinitarian or the Trinity of the Sabellian or the 
Trinity of the Arian, any more than one thinks of those theories 
made stone, those gods with three heads and seven hands, who sit on 
lotus leaves and flourish lingams and what not, in the temples of 
India.  Let us leave, therefore, these morbid elaborations of the 
human intelligence to drift to limbo, and come rather to the natural 
heresies that spring from fundamental weaknesses of the human 
character, and which are common to all religions.  Against these it 
is necessary to keep constant watch.  They return very insidiously.
<P>
<P>
<P>
3. GOD IS NOT MAGIC
<P>
<P>
One of the most universal of these natural misconceptions of God is 
to consider him as something magic serving the ends of men.
<P>
It is not easy for us to grasp at first the full meaning of giving 
our souls to God.  The missionary and teacher of any creed is all 
too apt to hawk God for what he will fetch; he is greedy for the 
poor triumph of acquiescence; and so it comes about that many people 
who have been led to believe themselves religious, are in reality 
still keeping back their own souls and trying to use God for their 
own purposes.  God is nothing more for them as yet than a 
magnificent Fetish.  They did not really want him, but they have 
heard that he is potent stuff; their unripe souls think to make use 
of him.  They call upon his name, they do certain things that are 
supposed to be peculiarly influential with him, such as saying 
prayers and repeating gross praises of him, or reading in a blind, 
industrious way that strange miscellany of Jewish and early 
Christian literature, the Bible, and suchlike mental mortification, 
or making the Sabbath dull and uncomfortable.  In return for these 
fetishistic propitiations God is supposed to interfere with the 
normal course of causation in their favour.  He becomes a celestial 
log-roller.  He remedies unfavourable accidents, cures petty 
ailments, contrives unexpected gifts of medicine, money, or the 
like, he averts bankruptcies, arranges profitable transactions, and 
does a thousand such services for his little clique of faithful 
people.  The pious are represented as being constantly delighted by 
these little surprises, these bouquets and chocolate boxes from the 
divinity.  Or contrawise he contrives spiteful turns for those who 
fail in their religious attentions.  He murders Sabbath-breaking 
children, or disorganises the careful business schemes of the 
ungodly.  He is represented as going Sabbath-breakering on Sunday 
morning as a Staffordshire worker goes ratting.  Ordinary everyday 
Christianity is saturated with this fetishistic conception of God.  
It may be disowned in THE HIBBERT JOURNAL, but it is unblushingly 
advocated in the parish magazine.  It is an idea taken over by 
Christianity with the rest of the qualities of the Hebrew God.  It 
is natural enough in minds so self-centred that their recognition of 
weakness and need brings with it no real self-surrender, but it is 
entirely inconsistent with the modern conception of the true God.
<P>
There has dropped upon the table as I write a modest periodical 
called THE NORTHERN BRITISH ISRAEL REVIEW, illustrated with 
portraits of various clergymen of the Church of England, and of 
ladies and gentlemen who belong to the little school of thought 
which this magazine represents; it is, I should judge, a sub-sect 
entirely within the Established Church of England, that is to say 
within the Anglican communion of the Trinitarian Christians.  It 
contains among other papers a very entertaining summary by a 
gentleman entitled--I cite the unusual title-page of the periodical--
"Landseer Mackenzie, Esq.," of the views of Isaiah, Ezekiel, and 
Obadiah upon the Kaiser William.  They are distinctly hostile views.  
Mr. Landseer Mackenzie discourses not only upon these anticipatory 
condemnations but also upon the relations of the weather to this 
war.  He is convinced quite simply and honestly that God has been 
persistently rigging the weather against the Germans.  He points out 
that the absence of mist on the North Sea was of great help to the 
British in the autumn of 1914, and declares that it was the wet 
state of the country that really held up the Germans in Flanders in 
the winter of 1914-15.  He ignores the part played by the weather in 
delaying the relief of Kut-el-Amara, and he has not thought of the 
difficult question why the Deity, having once decided upon 
intervention, did not, instead of this comparatively trivial 
meteorological assistance, adopt the more effective course of, for 
example, exploding or spoiling the German stores of ammunition by 
some simple atomic miracle, or misdirecting their gunfire by a 
sudden local modification of the laws of refraction or gravitation.
<P>
Since these views of God come from Anglican vicarages I can only 
conclude that this kind of belief is quite orthodox and permissible 
in the established church, and that I am charging orthodox 
Christianity here with nothing that has ever been officially 
repudiated.  I find indeed the essential assumptions of Mr. Landseer 
Mackenzie repeated in endless official Christian utterances on the 
part of German and British and Russian divines.  The Bishop of 
Chelmsford, for example, has recently ascribed our difficulties in 
the war to our impatience with long sermons--among other similar 
causes.  Such Christians are manifestly convinced that God can be 
invoked by ritual--for example by special days of national prayer or 
an increased observance of Sunday--or made malignant by neglect or 
levity.  It is almost fundamental in their idea of him.  The 
ordinary Mohammedan seems as confident of this magic pettiness of 
God, and the belief of China in the magic propitiations and 
resentments of "Heaven" is at least equally strong.
<P>
But the true God as those of the new religion know him is no such 
God of luck and intervention.  He is not to serve men's ends or the 
ends of nations or associations of men; he is careless of our 
ceremonies and invocations.  He does not lose his temper with our 
follies and weaknesses.  It is for us to serve Him.  He captains us, 
he does not coddle us.  He has his own ends for which he needs 
us. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
4. GOD IS NOT PROVIDENCE
<P>
<P>
Closely related to this heresy that God is magic, is the heresy that 
calls him Providence, that declares the apparent adequacy of cause 
and effect to be a sham, and that all the time, incalculably, he is 
pulling about the order of events for our personal advantages.
<P>
The idea of Providence was very gaily travested by Daudet in 
"Tartarin in the Alps."  You will remember how Tartarin's friend 
assured him that all Switzerland was one great Trust, intent upon 
attracting tourists and far too wise and kind to permit them to 
venture into real danger, that all the precipices were netted 
invisibly, and all the loose rocks guarded against falling, that 
avalanches were prearranged spectacles and the crevasses at their 
worst slippery ways down into kindly catchment bags.  If the 
mountaineer tried to get into real danger he was turned back by 
specious excuses.  Inspired by this persuasion Tartarin behaved with 
incredible daring. . . .  That is exactly the Providence theory of 
the whole world.  There can be no doubt that it does enable many a 
timid soul to get through life with a certain recklessness.  And 
provided there is no slip into a crevasse, the Providence theory 
works well.  It would work altogether well if there were no 
crevasses.
<P>
Tartarin was reckless because of his faith in Providence, and 
escaped.  But what would have happened to him if he had fallen into 
a crevasse?
<P>
There exists a very touching and remarkable book by Sir Francis 
Younghusband called "Within." [Williams and Norgate, 1912.]  It is 
the confession of a man who lived with a complete confidence in 
Providence until he was already well advanced in years.  He went 
through battles and campaigns, he filled positions of great honour 
and responsibility, he saw much of the life of men, without 
altogether losing his faith.  The loss of a child, an Indian famine, 
could shake it but not overthrow it.  Then coming back one day from 
some races in France, he was knocked down by an automobile and hurt 
very cruelly.  He suffered terribly in body and mind.  His 
sufferings caused much suffering to others.  He did his utmost to 
see the hand of a loving Providence in his and their disaster and 
the torment it inflicted, and being a man of sterling honesty and a 
fine essential simplicity of mind, he confessed at last that he 
could not do so.  His confidence in the benevolent intervention of 
God was altogether destroyed.  His book tells of this shattering, 
and how labouriously he reconstructed his religion upon less 
confident lines.  It is a book typical of an age and of a very 
English sort of mind, a book well worth reading.
<P>
That he came to a full sense of the true God cannot be asserted, but 
how near he came to God, let one quotation witness.
<P>
<P>
"The existence of an outside Providence," he writes, "who created 
us, who watches over us, and who guides our lives like a Merciful 
Father, we have found impossible longer to believe in.  But of the 
existence of a Holy Spirit radiating upward through all animate 
beings, and finding its fullest expression, in man in love, and in 
the flowers in beauty, we can be as certain as of anything in the 
world.  This fiery spiritual impulsion at the centre and the source 
of things, ever burning in us, is the supremely important factor in 
our existence.  It does not always attain to light.  In many 
directions it fails; the conditions are too hard and it is utterly 
blocked.  In others it only partially succeeds.  But in a few it 
bursts forth into radiant light.  There are few who in some heavenly 
moment of their lives have not been conscious of its presence.  We 
may not be able to give it outward expression, but we know that it 
is there." . . .
<P>
<P>
God does not guide our feet.  He is no sedulous governess 
restraining and correcting the wayward steps of men.  If you would 
fly into the air, there is no God to bank your aeroplane correctly 
for you or keep an ill-tended engine going; if you would cross a 
glacier, no God nor angel guides your steps amidst the slippery 
places.  He will not even mind your innocent children for you if you 
leave them before an unguarded fire.  Cherish no delusions; for 
yourself and others you challenge danger and chance on your own 
strength; no talisman, no God, can help you or those you care for.  
Nothing of such things will God do; it is an idle dream.  But God 
will be with you nevertheless.  In the reeling aeroplane or the dark 
ice-cave God will be your courage.  Though you suffer or are killed, 
it is not an end.  He will be with you as you face death; he will 
die with you as he has died already countless myriads of brave 
deaths.  He will come so close to you that at the last you will not 
know whether it is you or he who dies, and the present death will be 
swallowed up in his victory.
<P>
<P>
5. THE HERESY OF QUIETISM
<P>
<P>
God comes to us within and takes us for his own.  He releases us 
from ourselves; he incorporates us with his own undying experience 
and adventure; he receives us and gives himself.  He is a stimulant; 
he makes us live immortally and more abundantly.  I have compared 
him to the sensation of a dear, strong friend who comes and stands 
quietly beside one, shoulder to shoulder.
<P>
The finding of God is the beginning of service.  It is not an escape 
from life and action; it is the release of life and action from the 
prison of the mortal self.  Not to realise that, is the heresy of 
Quietism, of many mystics.  Commonly such people are people of some 
wealth, able to command services for all their everyday needs.  They 
make religion a method of indolence.  They turn their backs on the 
toil and stresses of existence and give themselves up to a delicious 
reverie in which they flirt with the divinity.  They will recount 
their privileges and ecstasies, and how ingeniously and wonderfully 
God has tried and proved them.  But indeed the true God was not the 
lover of Madame Guyon.  The true God is not a spiritual troubadour 
wooing the hearts of men and women to no purpose.  The true God goes 
through the world like fifes and drums and flags, calling for 
recruits along the street.  We must go out to him.  We must accept 
his discipline and fight his battle.  The peace of God comes not by 
thinking about it but by forgetting oneself in him.
<P>
<P>
<P>
6. GOD DOES NOT PUNISH
<P>
<P>
Man is a social animal, and there is in him a great faculty for 
moral indignation.  Many of the early Gods were mainly Gods of Fear.  
They were more often "wrath" than not.  Such was the temperament of 
the Semitic deity who, as the Hebrew Jehovah, proliferated, perhaps 
under the influence of the Alexandrian Serapeum, into the Christian 
Trinity and who became also the Moslem God.*  The natural hatred of 
unregenerate men against everything that is unlike themselves, 
against strange people and cheerful people, against unfamiliar 
usages and things they do not understand, embodied itself in this 
conception of a malignant and partisan Deity, perpetually "upset" by 
the little things people did, and contriving murder and vengeance.  
Now this God would be drowning everybody in the world, now he would 
be burning Sodom and Gomorrah, now he would be inciting his 
congenial Israelites to the most terrific pogroms.  This divine 
"frightfulness" is of course the natural human dislike and distrust 
for queer practices or for too sunny a carelessness, a dislike 
reinforced by the latent fierceness of the ape in us, liberating the 
latent fierceness of the ape in us, giving it an excuse and pressing 
permission upon it, handing the thing hated and feared over to its 
secular arm. . . .
<P>
* It is not so generally understood as it should be among English 
and American readers that a very large proportion of early 
Christians before the creeds established and regularised the 
doctrine of the Trinity, denied absolutely that Jehovah was God; 
they regarded Christ as a rebel against Jehovah and a rescuer of 
humanity from him, just as Prometheus was a rebel against Jove.  
These beliefs survived for a thousand years tbroughout Christendom: 
they were held by a great multitude of persecuted sects, from the 
Albigenses and Cathars to the eastern Paulicians.  The catholic 
church found it necessary to prohibit the circulation of the Old 
Testament among laymen very largely on account of the polemics of 
the Cathars against the Hebrew God.  But in this book, be it noted, 
the word Christian, when it is not otherwise defined, is used to 
indicate only the Trinitarians who accept the official creeds.
<P>
It is a human paradox that the desire for seemliness, the instinct 
for restraints and fair disciplines, and the impulse to cherish 
sweet familiar things, that these things of the True God should so 
readily liberate cruelty and tyranny.  It is like a woman going with 
a light to tend and protect her sleeping child, and setting the 
house on fire.  None the less, right down to to-day, the heresy of 
God the Revengeful, God the Persecutor and Avenger, haunts religion.  
It is only in quite recent years that the growing gentleness of 
everyday life has begun to make men a little ashamed of a Deity less 
tolerant and gentle than themselves.  The recent literature of the 
Anglicans abounds in the evidence of this trouble.
<P>
Bishop Colenso of Natal was prosecuted and condemned in 1863 for 
denying the irascibility of his God and teaching "the Kaffirs of 
Natal" the dangerous heresy that God is all mercy.  "We cannot allow 
it to be said," the Dean of Cape Town insisted, "that God was not 
angry and was not appeased by punishment." He was angry "on account 
of Sin, which is a great evil and a great insult to His Majesty."  
The case of the Rev. Charles Voysey, which occurred in 1870, was a 
second assertion of the Church's insistence upon the fierceness of 
her God.  This case is not to be found in the ordinary church 
histories nor is it even mentioned in the latest edition of the 
ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA; nevertheless it appears to have been a 
very illuminating case.  It is doubtful if the church would 
prosecute or condemn either Bishop Colenso or Mr. Voysey to-day.
<P>
<P>
<P>
7. GOD AND THE NURSERY-MAID
<P>
<P>
Closely related to the Heresy of God the Avenger, is that kind of 
miniature God the Avenger, to whom the nursery-maid and the 
overtaxed parent are so apt to appeal.  You stab your children with 
such a God and he poisons all their lives.  For many of us the word 
"God" first came into our lives to denote a wanton, irrational 
restraint, as Bogey, as the All-Seeing and quite ungenerous Eye.  
God Bogey is a great convenience to the nursery-maid who wants to 
leave Fear to mind her charges and enforce her disciplines, while 
she goes off upon her own aims.  But indeed, the teaching of God 
Bogey is an outrage upon the soul of a child scarcely less dreadful 
than an indecent assault.  The reason rebels and is crushed under 
this horrible and pursuing suggestion.  Many minds never rise again 
from their injury.  They remain for the rest of life spiritually 
crippled and debased, haunted by a fear, stained with a persuasion 
of relentless cruelty in the ultimate cause of all things.
<P>
I, who write, was so set against God, thus rendered.  He and his 
Hell were the nightmare of my childhood; I hated him while I still 
believed in him, and who could help but hate?  I thought of him as a 
fantastic monster, perpetually spying, perpetually listening, 
perpetually waiting to condemn and to "strike me dead"; his flames 
as ready as a grill-room fire.  He was over me and about my 
feebleness and silliness and forgetfulness as the sky and sea would 
be about a child drowning in mid-Atlantic.  When I was still only a 
child of thirteen, by the grace of the true God in me, I flung this 
Lie out of my mind, and for many years, until I came to see that God 
himself had done this thing for me, the name of God meant nothing to 
me but the hideous scar in my heart where a fearful demon had been.
<P>
I see about me to-day many dreadful moral and mental cripples with 
this bogey God of the nursery-maid, with his black, insane revenges, 
still living like a horrible parasite in their hearts in the place 
where God should be.  They are afraid, afraid, afraid; they dare not 
be kindly to formal sinners, they dare not abandon a hundred foolish 
observances; they dare not look at the causes of things.  They are 
afraid of sunshine, of nakedness, of health, of adventure, of 
science, lest that old watching spider take offence.  The voice of 
the true God whispers in their hearts, echoes in speech and writing, 
but they avert themselves, fear-driven.  For the true God has no 
lash of fear.  And how the foul-minded bigot, with his ill-shaven 
face, his greasy skin, his thick, gesticulating hands, his 
bellowings and threatenings, loves to reap this harvest of fear the 
ignorant cunning of the nursery girl has sown for him!  How he loves 
the importance of denunciation, and, himself a malignant cripple, to 
rally the company of these crippled souls to persecute and destroy 
the happy children of God! . . .
<P>
Christian priestcraft turns a dreadful face to children.  There is a 
real wickedness of the priest that is different from other 
wickedness, and that affects a reasonable mind just as cruelty and 
strange perversions of instinct affect it.  Let a former Archbishop 
of Canterbury speak for me.  This that follows is the account given 
by Archbishop Tait in a debate in the Upper House of Convocation 
(July 3rd, 1877) of one of the publications of a certain SOCIETY OF 
THE HOLY CROSS:
<P>
<P>
"I take this book, as its contents show, to be meant for the 
instruction of very young children.  I find, in one of the pages of 
it, the statement that between the ages of six and six and a half 
years would be the proper time for the inculcation of the teaching 
which is to be found in the book.  Now, six to six and a half is 
certainly a very tender age, and to these children I find these 
statements addressed in the book:
<P>
<P>
"'It is to the priest, and to the priest only, that the child must 
acknowledge his sins, if he desires that God should forgive him.'
<P>
<P>
"I hope and trust the person, the three clergymen, or however many 
there were, did not exactly realise what they were writing; that 
they did not mean to say that a child was not to confess its sins to 
God direct; that it was not to confess its sins, at the age of six, 
to its mother, or to its father, but was only to have recourse to 
the priest.  But the words, to say the least of them, are rash.  
Then comes the very obvious question:
<P>
<P>
"'Do you know why?  It is because God, when he was on earth, gave to 
his priests, and to them alone, the Divine Power of forgiving men 
their sins.  It was to priests alone that Jesus said: "Receive ye 
the Holy Ghost." . . .  Those who will not confess will not be 
cured.  Sin is a terrible sickness, and casts souls into hell.'
<P>
<P>
"That is addressed to a child six years of age.
<P>
<P>
"'I have known,' the book continues, 'poor children who concealed 
their sins in confession for years; they were very unhappy, were 
tormented with remorse, and if they had died in that state they 
would certainly have gone to the everlasting fires of hell.'" . . .
<P>
<P>
Now here is something against nature, something that I have seen 
time after time in the faces and bearing of priests and heard in 
their preaching.  It is a distinct lust.  Much nobility and devotion 
there are among priests, saintly lives and kindly lives, lives of 
real worship, lives no man may better; this that I write is not of 
all, perhaps not of many priests.  But there has been in all ages 
that have known sacerdotalism this terrible type of the priest; 
priestcraft and priestly power release an aggressive and narrow 
disposition to a recklessness of suffering and a hatred of liberty 
that surely exceeds the badness of any other sort of men.
<P>
<P>
<P>
8. THE CHILDREN'S GOD
<P>
<P>
Children do not naturally love God.  They have no great capacity for 
an idea so subtle and mature as the idea of God.  While they are 
still children in a home and cared for, life is too kind and easy 
for them to feel any great need of God.  All things are still 
something God-like. . . .
<P>
The true God, our modern minds insist upon believing, can have no 
appetite for unnatural praise and adoration.  He does not clamour 
for the attention of children.  He is not like one of those senile 
uncles who dream of glory in the nursery, who love to hear it said, 
"The children adore him."  If children are loved and trained to 
truth, justice, and mutual forbearance, they will be ready for the 
true God as their needs bring them within his scope.  They should be 
left to their innocence, and to their trust in the innocence of the 
world, as long as they can be.  They should be told only of God as a 
Great Friend whom some day they will need more and understand and 
know better.  That is as much as most children need.  The phrases of 
religion put too early into their mouths may become a cant, 
something worse than blasphemy.
<P>
Yet children are sometimes very near to God.  Creative passion stirs 
in their play.  At times they display a divine simplicity.  But it 
does not follow that therefore they should be afflicted with 
theological formulae or inducted into ceremonies and rites that they 
may dislike or misinterpret.  If by any accident, by the death of a 
friend or a distressing story, the thought of death afflicts a 
child, then he may begin to hear of God, who takes those that serve 
him out of their slain bodies into his shining immortality.  Or if 
by some menial treachery, through some prowling priest, the whisper 
of Old Bogey reaches our children, then we may set their minds at 
ease by the assurance of his limitless charity. . . .
<P>
With adolescence comes the desire for God and to know more of God, 
and that is the most suitable time for religious talk and teaching.

9. GOD IS NOT SEXUAL
<P>
<P>
In the last two or three hundred years there has been a very 
considerable disentanglement of the idea of God from the complex of 
sexual thought and feeling.  But in the early days of religion the 
two things were inseparably bound together; the fury of the Hebrew 
prophets, for example, is continually proclaiming the extraordinary 
"wrath" of their God at this or that little dirtiness or 
irregularity or breach of the sexual tabus.  The ceremony of 
circumcision is clearly indicative of the original nature of the 
Semitic deity who developed into the Trinitarian God.  So far as 
Christianity dropped this rite, so far Christianity disavowed the 
old associations.  But to this day the representative Christian 
churches still make marriage into a mystical sacrament, and, with 
some exceptions, the Roman communion exacts the sacrifice of 
celibacy from its priesthood, regardless of the mischievousness and 
maliciousness that so often ensue.  Nearly every Christian church 
inflicts as much discredit and injustice as it can contrive upon the 
illegitimate child.  They do not treat illegitimate children as 
unfortunate children, but as children with a mystical and an 
incurable taint of SIN.  Kindly easy-going Christians may resent 
this statement because it does not tally with their own attitudes, 
but let them consult their orthodox authorities.
<P>
One must distinguish clearly here between what is held to be sacred 
or sinful in itself and what is held to be one's duty or a nation's 
duty because it is in itself the wisest, cleanest, clearest, best 
thing to do.  By the latter tests and reasonable arguments most or 
all of our institutions regulating the relations of the sexes may be 
justifiable.  But my case is not whether they can be justified by 
these tests but that it is not by these tests that they are judged 
even to-day, by the professors of the chief religions of the world.  
It is the temper and not the conclusions of the religious bodies 
that I would criticise.  These sexual questions are guarded by a 
holy irascibility, and the most violent efforts are made--with a 
sense of complete righteousness--to prohibit their discussion.  That 
fury about sexual things is only to be explained on the hypothesis 
that the Christian God remains a sex God in the minds of great 
numbers of his exponents.  His disentanglement from that plexus is 
incomplete.  Sexual things are still to the orthodox Christian, 
sacred things.
<P>
Now the God whom those of the new faith are finding is only 
mediately concerned with the relations of men and women.  He is no 
more sexual essentially than he is essentially dietetic or hygienic.  
The God of Leviticus was all these things.  He is represented as 
prescribing the most petty and intimate of observances--many of 
which are now habitually disregarded by the Christians who profess 
him. . . .  It is part of the evolution of the idea of God that we 
have now so largely disentangled our conception of him from the 
dietary and regimen and meticulous sexual rules that were once 
inseparably bound up with his majesty.  Christ himself was one of 
the chief forces in this disentanglement, there is the clearest 
evidence in several instances of his disregard of the rule and his 
insistence that his disciples should seek for the spirit underlying 
and often masked by the rule.  His Church, being made of baser 
matter, has followed him as reluctantly as possible and no further 
than it was obliged.  But it has followed him far enough to admit 
his principle that in all these matters there is no need for 
superstitious fear, that the interpretation of the divine purpose is 
left to the unembarrassed intelligence of men.  The church has 
followed him far enough to make the harsh threatenings of priests 
and ecclesiastics against what they are pleased to consider impurity 
or sexual impiety, a profound inconsistency.  One seems to hear 
their distant protests when one reads of Christ and the Magdalen, or 
of Christ eating with publicans and sinners.  The clergy of our own 
days play the part of the New Testament Pharisees with the utmost 
exactness and complete unconsciousness.  One cannot imagine a modern 
ecclesiastic conversing with a Magdalen in terms of ordinary 
civility, unless she was in a very high social position indeed, or 
blending with disreputable characters without a dramatic sense of 
condescension and much explanatory by-play.  Those who profess 
modern religion do but follow in these matters a course entirely 
compatible with what has survived of the authentic teachings of 
Christ, when they declare that God is not sexual, and that religious 
passion and insult and persecution upon the score of sexual things 
are a barbaric inheritance.
<P>
But lest anyone should fling off here with some hasty assumption 
that those who profess the religion of the true God are sexually 
anarchistic, let stress be laid at once upon the opening sentence of 
the preceding paragraph, and let me a little anticipate a section 
which follows.  We would free men and women from exact and 
superstitious rules and observances, not to make them less the 
instruments of God but more wholly his.  The claim of modern 
religion is that one should give oneself unreservedly to God, that 
there is no other salvation.  The believer owes all his being and 
every moment of his life to God, to keep mind and body as clean, 
fine, wholesome, active and completely at God's service as he can.  
There is no scope for indulgence or dissipation in such a 
consecrated life.  It is a matter between the individual and his 
conscience or his doctor or his social understanding what exactly he 
may do or not do, what he may eat or drink or so forth, upon any 
occasion.  Nothing can exonerate him from doing his utmost to 
determine and perform the right act.  Nothing can excuse his failure 
to do so.  But what is here being insisted upon is that none of 
these things has immediately to do with God or religious emotion, 
except only the general will to do right in God's service.  The 
detailed interpretation of that "right" is for the dispassionate 
consideration of the human intelligence.
<P>
All this is set down here as distinctly as possible.  Because of the 
emotional reservoirs of sex, sexual dogmas are among the most 
obstinately recurrent of all heresies, and sexual excitement is 
always tending to leak back into religious feeling.  Amongst the 
sex-tormented priesthood of the Roman communion in particular, 
ignorant of the extreme practices of the Essenes and of the Orphic 
cult and suchlike predecessors of Christianity, there seems to be an 
extraordinary belief that chastity was not invented until 
Christianity came, and that the religious life is largely the 
propitiation of God by feats of sexual abstinence.  But a 
superstitious abstinence that scars and embitters the mind, distorts 
the imagination, makes the body gross and keeps it unclean, is just 
as offensive to God as any positive depravity.
