RESOLUTION HONOUR ROLL
<P>
Miss Felicity King.
<P>
<P>
HONOURABLE MENTION
<P>
Mr. Felix King.
Mr. Peter Craig.
Miss Sara Ray.
<P>
<P>
EDITORIAL
<P>
The editor wishes to make a few remarks about the Resolution
Honour Roll.  As will be seen, only one name figures on it. 
Felicity says she has thought a beautiful thought every morning
before breakfast without missing one morning, not even the one we
were at Peg Bowen's.  Some of our number think it not fair that
Felicity should be on the honour roll (FELICITY, ASIDE:  "That's
Dan, of course.") when she only made one resolution and won't tell
us what any of the thoughts were.  So we have decided to give
honourable mention to everybody who has kept one resolution
perfect.  Felix has worked all his arithmetic problems by himself. 
He complains that he never got more than a third of them right and
the teacher has marked him away down; but one cannot keep
resolutions without some inconvenience.  Peter has never played
tit-tat-x in church or got drunk and says it wasn't as bad as he
expected.  (PETER, INDIGNANTLY:  "I never said it."  CECILY,
SOOTHINGLY:  "Now, Peter, Bev only meant that as a joke.") Sara Ray
has never talked any mean gossip, but does not find conversation
as interesting as it used to be.  (SARA RAY, WONDERINGLY:  "I don't
remember of saying that.")
<P>
Felix did not eat any apples until March, but forgot and ate seven
the day we were at Cousin Mattie's.  (FELIX:  "I only ate five!")
He soon gave up trying to say what he thought always.  He got into
too much trouble.  We think Felix ought to change to old
Grandfather King's rule.  It was, "Hold your tongue when you can,
and when you can't tell the truth." Cecily feels she has not read
all the good books she might, because some she tried to read were
very dull and the Pansy books were so much more interesting.  And
it is no use trying not to feel bad because her hair isn't curly
and she has marked that resolution out.  The Story Girl came very
near to keeping her resolution to have all the good times
possible, but she says she missed two, if not three, she might
have had.  Dan refuses to say anything about his resolutions and
so does the editor.

<P>
PERSONALS
<P>
We regret that Miss Cecily King is suffering from a severe cold.
<P>
Mr. Alexander Marr of Markdale died very suddenly last week.  We
never heard of his death till he was dead.
<P>
Miss Cecily King wishes to state that she did not ask the question
about "Holy Moses" and the other word in the January number.  Dan
put it in for a mean joke.
<P>
The weather has been cold and fine.  We have only had one bad
storm.  The coasting on Uncle Roger's hill continues good.
<P>
Aunt Eliza did not favour us with a visit after all.  She took
cold and had to go home.  We were sorry that she had a cold but
glad that she had to go home.  Cecily said she thought it wicked
of us to be glad.  But when we asked her "cross her heart" if she
wasn't glad herself she had to say she was.
<P>
Miss Cecily King has got three very distinguished names on her
quilt square.  They are the Governor and his wife and a witch's.
<P>
The King family had the honour of entertaining the Governor's wife
to tea on February the seventeenth.  We are all invited to visit
Government House but some of us think we won't go.
<P>
A tragic event occurred last Tuesday.  Mrs. James Frewen came to
tea and there was no pie in the house.  Felicity has not yet fully
recovered.
<P>
A new boy is coming to school.  His name is Cyrus Brisk and his
folks moved up from Markdale.  He says he is going to punch Willy
Fraser's head if Willy keeps on thinking he is Miss Cecily King's
beau.
<P>
(CECILY:  "I haven't ANY beau!  I don't mean to think of such a
thing for at least eight years yet!")
<P>
Miss Alice Reade of Charlottetown Royalty has come to Carlisle to
teach music.  She boards at Mr. Peter Armstrong's.  The girls are
all going to take music lessons from her.  Two descriptions of her
will be found in another column.  Felix wrote one, but the girls
thought he did not do her justice, so Cecily wrote another one. 
She admits she copied most of the description out of Valeria H. 
Montague's story Lord Marmaduke's First, Last, and Only Love; or
the Bride of the Castle by the Sea, but says they fit Miss Reade
better than anything she could make up.

HOUSEHOLD DEPARTMENT
<P>
Always keep the kitchen tidy and then you needn't mind if company
comes unexpectedly.
<P>
ANXIOUS INQUIRER:  We don't know anything that will take the stain
out of a silk dress when a soft-boiled egg is dropped on it. 
Better not wear your silk dress so often, especially when boiling
eggs.
<P>
Ginger tea is good for colds.
<P>
OLD HOUSEKEEPER:  Yes, when the baking-powder gives out you can use
tooth-powder instead.
<P>
(FELICITY:  "I never wrote that!  I don't care, I don't think it's
fair for other people to be putting things in my department!")
<P>
Our apples are not keeping well this year.  They are rotting; and
besides father says we eat an awful lot of them.
<P>
PERSEVERANCE:  I will give you the recipe for dumplings you ask
for.  But remember it is not everyone who can make dumplings, even
from the recipe.  There's a knack in it.
<P>
If the soap falls into the porridge do not tell your guests about
it until they have finished eating it because it might take away
their appetite.
<P>
                              FELICITY KING.

<P>
ETIQUETTE DEPARTMENT
<P>
P-r C-g:--Do not criticize people's noses unless you are sure they
can't hear you, and don't criticize your best girl's great-aunt's
nose in any case.
<P>
(FELICITY, TOSSING HER HEAD:  "Oh, my!  I s'pose Dan thought that
was extra smart.")
<P>
C-y K-g:--When my most intimate friend walks with another girl and
exchanges lace patterns with her, what ought I to do?  Ans.  Adopt
a dignified attitude.
<P>
F-y K-g:--It is better not to wear your second best hat to church,
but if your mother says you must it is not for me to question her
decision.
<P>
(FELICITY:  "Dan just copied that word for word out of the Family
Guide, except about the hat part.")
<P>
P-r C-g:--Yes, it would be quite proper to say good evening to the
family ghost if you met it.
<P>
F-x K-g:--No, it is not polite to sleep with your mouth open. 
What's more, it isn't safe.  Something might fall into it.
<P>
                                          DAN KING.

FASHION NOTES
<P>
Crocheted watch pockets are all the rage now.  If you haven't a
watch they do to carry your pencil in or a piece of gum.
<P>
It is stylish to have hair ribbons to match your dress.  But it is
hard to match gray drugget.  I like scarlet for that.
<P>
It is stylish to pin a piece of ribbon on your coat the same
colour as your chum wears in her hair.  Mary Martha Cowan saw them
doing it in town and started us doing it here.  I always wear
Kitty's ribbon and Kitty wears mine, but the Story Girl thinks it
is silly.

AN ACCOUNT OF OUR VISIT TO COUSIN MATTIE'S
<P>
We all walked over to Cousin Mattie's last week.  They were all
well there and we had a fine dinner.  On our way back a snow-storm
came up and we got lost in the woods.  We didn't know where we
were or nothing.  If we hadn't seen a light I guess we'd all have
been frozen and snowed over, and they would never have found us
till spring and that would be very sad.  But we saw a light and
made for it and it was Peg Bowen's.  Some people think she is a
witch and it's hard to tell, but she was real hospitable and took
us all in.  Her house was very untidy but it was warm.  She has a
skull.  I mean a loose skull, not her own.  She lets on it tells
her things, but Uncle Alec says it couldn't because it was only an
Indian skull that old Dr. Beecham had and Peg stole it when he
died, but Uncle Roger says he wouldn't trust himself with Peg's
skull for anything.  She gave us supper.  It was a horrid meal. 
The Story Girl says I must not tell what I found in the bread and
butter because it would be too disgusting to read in Our Magazine
but it don't matter because we were all there, except Sara Ray,
and know what it was.  We stayed all night and us boys slept in
straw.  None of us had ever slept on straw before.  We got home in
the morning.  That is all I can write about our visit to Cousin
Mattie's.

MY WORST ADVENTURE
<P>
It's my turn to write it so I suppose I must.  I guess my worst
adventure was two years ago when a whole lot of us were coasting
on Uncle Rogers hill.  Charlie Cowan and Fred Marr had started,
but half-way down their sled got stuck and I run down to shove
them off again.  Then I stood there just a moment to watch them
with my back to the top of the hill.  While I was standing there
Rob Marr started Kitty and Em Frewen off on his sled.  His sled
had a wooden tongue in it and it slanted back over the girls'
heads.  I was right in the way and they yelled to me to get out,
but just as I heard them it struck me.  The sled took me between
the legs and I was histed back over the tongue and dropped in a
heap behind before I knew what had happened to me.  I thought a
tornado had struck me.  The girls couldn't stop though they
thought I was killed, but Rob came tearing down and helped me up. 
He was awful scared but I wasn't killed nor my back wasn't broken
but my nose bled something awful and kept on bleeding for three
days.  Not all the time but by spells.

THE STORY OF HOW CARLISLE GOT ITS NAME
<P>
This is a true story to.  Long ago there was a girl lived in
charlotte town.  I dont know her name so I cant right it and maybe
it is just as well for Felicity might think it wasnt romantik like
Miss Jemima Parrs.  She was awful pretty and a young englishman
who had come out to make his fortune fell in love with her and
they were engaged to be married the next spring.  His name was Mr.
Carlisle.  In the winter he started off to hunt cariboo for a
spell.  Cariboos lived on the island then.  There aint any here
now.  He got to where it is Carlisle now.  It wasn't anything then
only woods and a few indians.  He got awful sick and was sick for
ever so long in a indian camp and only an old micmac squaw to wait
on him.  Back in town they all thought he was dead and his girl
felt bad for a little while and then got over it and took up with
another beau.  The girls say that wasnt romantik but I think it
was sensible but if it had been me that died I'd have felt bad if
she forgot me so soon.  But he hadnt died and when he got back to
town he went right to her house and walked in and there she was
standing up to be married to the other fellow.  Poor Mr. Carlisle
felt awful.  He was sick and week and it went to his head.  He
just turned and run and run till he got back to the old micmac's
camp and fell in front of it.  But the indians had gone because it
was spring and it didnt matter because he really was dead this
time and people come looking for him from town and found him and
buryed him there and called the place after him.  They say the
girl was never happy again and that was hard lines on her but
maybe she deserved it.

MISS ALICE READE
<P>
Miss Alice Reade is a very pretty girl.  She has kind of curly
blackish hair and big gray eyes and a pale face.  She is tall and
thin but her figure is pretty fair and she has a nice mouth and a
sweet way of speaking.  The girls are crazy about her and talk
about her all the time.
<P>
                                        FELIX KING.

BEAUTIFUL ALICE
<P>
That is what we girls call Miss Reade among ourselves.  She is
divinely beautiful.  Her magnificent wealth of raven hair flows
back in glistening waves from her sun-kissed brow.  (DAN:  "If
Felix had said she was sunburned you'd have all jumped on him."
(CECILY, COLDLY:  "Sun-kissed doesn't mean sunburned."  DAN:  "What
does it mean then?"  CECILY, EMBARRASSED:  "I--I don't know.  But
Miss Montague says the Lady Geraldine's brow was sun-kissed and of
course an earl's daughter wouldn't be sunburned.  "THE STORY GIRL:
"Oh, don't interrupt the reading like this.  It spoils it.") Her
eyes are gloriously dark and deep, like midnight lakes mirroring
the stars of heaven.  Her features are like sculptured marble and
her mouth is a trembling, curving Cupid's bow.  (PETER, ASIDE:
"What kind of a thing is that?") Her creamy skin is as fair and
flawless as the petals of a white lily.  Her voice is like the
ripple of a woodland brook and her slender form is matchless in
its symmetry.  (DAN:  "That's Valeria's way of putting it, but
Uncle Roger says she don't show her feed much."  FELICITY:  "Dan!
if Uncle Roger is vulgar you needn't be!") Her hands are like a
poet's dreams.  She dresses so nicely and looks so stylish in her
clothes.  Her favourite colour is blue.  Some people think she is
stiff and some say she is stuck-up, but she isn't a bit.  It's
just that she is different from them and they don't like it.  She
is just lovely and we adore her.
