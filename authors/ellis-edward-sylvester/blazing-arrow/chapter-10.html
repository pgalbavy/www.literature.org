<p>Larry Murphy, after his daring check of the Shawanoes in their
attempt to leap the torrent, was sufficiently wise to see that
it would not do for him to remain where he was. The red men had
located the dangerous marksman, and would soon gain access to
him.</p>

<p>If they chose, they could swim the stream below, as he had done,
and there must be other points above where the walls approached
near enough to allow them to jump across. If two or three succeeded
in getting to the rear of his position (and what was to prevent
it?) he would be caught inextricably in a trap.</p>

<p>"I wonder what's become of Whart? What could he do without me?
He's always getting into trouble, and it's the bother of me life
getting him out again. I ought to be with him now."</p>

<p>Nothing was clearer than that before he could do any more service
for his friend, or even learn his situation, he must place himself
on the other side of the torrent. He could do this by swimming,
as before, but he shrank from repeating the performance. The Shawanoes
were likely to watch for such an attempt, and he would be in a
bad situation if discovered in the water.</p>

<p>He believed, too, that at no distant point up stream there was
some place where the passage could be made quickly and without
danger; he decided to find out if such was the case.</p>

<p>"I hope Whart won't do anything rash," he mused, picking his
way with no little skill and with the utmost care, "but he needs
me with him all the time. With all the speed he owns, if he only
made a break for the block-house, he'd be there in an hour or
two; but it's just like him not to think of that, and if he did,
mor'n likely the Indians would object."</p>

<p>A hundred yards above the point where young Edwards had leaped
the torrent, Larry began working his way back to it. It would
have been a most fortunate thing had he arrived somewhat sooner,
for then he would have seen his friend starting on his memorable
race with Blazing Arrow. The chance of bringing down the vicious
Shawanoe by a shot from the rear would have been so inviting that
it is more than probable that the youth would have nipped the
contest in the bud. But, had he not done so, he would have gained
the information that would have changed his own line of action,
and the whole course of succeeding events.</p>

<p>But the torrent was wider than below, and not even Wharton Edwards
would have been able to leap it. Larry was careful to keep out
of sight, and withdrawing again from the bank, he cautiously made
his way up stream, on the watch for some place to cross.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether any of them have got over yet?" he muttered,
feeling each step of the way; "they're sharp enough to follow
me tracks where I haven't stepped on the stones&mdash;whisht!"</p>

<p>He stopped short, for he had heard something moving slowly among
the undergrowth ahead.</p>

<p>"Some of them have come back&#11834;"</p>

<p>Instead of a Shawanoe warrior, the bulky form of an immense bear
came into sight.</p>

<p>"And so ye want to mix in this business?" was the thought of
the lad on identifying the animal. "I'm sure neither Whart nor
me would have any objections if you would only turn your attention
to them that is making us so much bother."</p>

<p>He surveyed the lumbering creature a minute or two, strongly
tempted to give him a shot. He would have fired, but the report
of the gun would be heard by the Shawanoes, some of whom could
not be far off. The falls were so distant that the sound was but
a faint roar in his ears.</p>

<p>The bear did not seem to be looking for large boys just then,
and, after lumbering into sight, disappeared among the vegetation,
which was rank in that section. He showed no sign of suspecting
that one of his natural enemies was so near. Had he known it,
doubtless he would have given him attention.</p>

<p>In the effort to find a place where the stream could be crossed,
Larry pushed on, never forgetting that he was in continual danger
from the Shawanoes. The day was waning, and night was not far
off.</p>

<p>"If I don't strike the right sort of spot," he concluded, "by
the time night is here, I'll find a place where I can swim from
one bank to the other. Halloo!" A dark object on the ground a
short distance in advance caught his eye. Stooping down, he found
to his delight it was his lost cap, doubtless carried thither
by this same bear.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the torrent to which we have made
reference so often was not crossed by the trail leading from the
settlement to the block-house, although the two approached quite
closely at several points. The winding course of the path was
mainly with the object of avoiding a passage over the stream.
The boys, therefore, knew little about it, and the slight journey
Larry Murphy was making was in the nature of an exploration.</p>

<p>When he was about ready to give up hope of finding a method of
crossing other than by swimming, a surprise greeted him. The high
banks not only drew near together, but they were bridged by a
fallen tree, whose base was several feet away from the edge of
the other shore. The branches rested on the ground near the feet
of the astonished youth, who felt like throwing off his hat with
delight.</p>

<p>"If I ever meet the gintleman that felled that tree for me, I'll
give him me heartfilt thanks."</p>

<p>Larry would have been pleased had the trunk been larger; not
that it lacked strength, but it would have been much easier to
walk it, for it is no light task to pick one's way along a comparative
sapling, especially when a deep, rapid stream is sweeping beneath.</p>

<p>By this time the sun had set and the light was growing dim in
the woods. He stood back just beyond the dead branches and meditatively
scratched his head. He knew that in all probability the tree had
fallen in this position of its own accord, and perhaps never had
served as a bridge; but, if so, it was because the occasion did
not arise, since nothing could be more opportune.</p>

<p>"I'm wondering whether I'm equal to the job," he added, still
scratching his scrubby hair. "If I step off I'll have to go over
the falls, unless I crawl out at the one spot, and I'm likely
to miss that. If the sun was shining it would be easy enough,
and I guess maybe I can do it as it is."</p>

<p>This was a case where it was idle to delay. He therefore fastened
his rifle in the usual way behind his back, so as to leave his
arms free, for more than likely he would need them before reaching
the opposite side.</p>

<p>"There won't be much use of saving mesilf without the gun, so
we'll hang together or go down, if we must, with our colors flying."</p>

<p>He placed his foot on the upper part of the trunk, just beyond
where the first branch appeared, and tested it. So far as he could
tell, it was sufficiently strong to bear ten times his weight.</p>

<p>He now advanced inch by inch, but had gone less than a fourth
of the distance when he found that his rifle was balanced in such
a way behind his shoulder that it was unsteady, and liable to
throw him at any moment.</p>

<p>It was delicate and dangerous to retreat, but he did it, slowly
struggling until he was so near the shore from which he started
that he was able to turn quickly and leap to the solid ground.</p>

<p>He took several minutes to adjust his weapon, for the slight
trial he had made taught him it would be exceedingly perilous
for him to run any sort of risk. It would be all he could do to
get across under the most favorable circumstances.</p>

<p>In the gathering gloom, when everything was in readiness, he
placed his foot on the narrow portion of the trunk and prepared
to repeat the attempt, but at the very moment of doing so he made
the discovery that some one else had started to cross from the
other side.</p>

<p>Larry Murphy learned the truth in the nick of time. Ten seconds
later and he would have been on the trunk at the same moment as
the other, and an advance by both must have caused them to meet
over the middle of the stream.</p>

<p>As it was, Larry was uncertain whether he had been seen, or whether
it was a man or animal that was approaching. The doubt, however,
lasted but a second, when out from the gloom advanced a Shawanoe
warrior, who came along the narrow bridge with the deliberate
certainty of a Blondin. No fear of <em>his</em> making a misstep.</p>

<p>This of itself told the youth that the Indian had not seen him,
for, if he had, nothing would have been more foolhardy than thus
to place himself at the mercy of the one who a short time before
had shown his nerve and marksmanship under more difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>But for the displacement of his rifle, Larry Murphy would have
walked into the arms of the red man. As it was, he had missed
doing so, or at least had missed discovery, by the narrowest margin
conceivable.</p>

<p>With the coolness and cleverness of a veteran the lad moved back
among the denser gloom of the trees, where he was confident no
one could see him unless close enough to touch his person. Then
he paused and watched proceedings. Hardly had the sun sunk below
the horizon when the round full moon gave out its light, flooding
wood and stream with radiance. It was the moonlight that revealed
the sinewy figure to the watcher in the darkness.</p>

<p>Larry could not but admire the surefootedness of the red man,
who never stepped off the trunk until standing over solid earth.
Then he turned about and faced the side from which he had come.
He was so close to the edge of the gorge that he was still revealed
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The temptation was strong to give him a quick shove into the
water, leaving him to get out the best way he could; but before
the youth could act upon his mischievous suggestion a second Indian
emerged from the gloom and carefully crossed the primitive bridge
used by his predecessor.</p>

<p>"What does all this mean?" Larry asked himself. "Is the whole
party coming over one by one? It may be that they will bring Whart
with them. Halloo!"</p>

<p>A third Shawanoe crossed, but no more. The three stood for several
minutes so close to the youth that but for the noise of the torrent
he would have been sure of betrayal through the throbbing of his
heart.</p>

<p>There was a moment when he believed they had seen him from the
first, and intended to turn like lightning upon him. In case they
did so he meant to make a rush, with the hope of forcing them
into the river.</p>

<p>The red men remained but a few minutes, however, when they disappeared
as silently as phantoms. Whither they had gone, or what their
business was and why three of them had come from the other side,
were questions beyond the solution of the puzzled lad, who was
certain that he had never stumbled into such a mixed condition
of affairs.</p>

<p>He waited a long time, fearful of venturing to walk over the
trunk, lest he might meet others. When that did not take place,
the likelihood of there being more of the Shawanoes in the vicinity,
who would be quick to detect his approach, was not lessened.</p>

<p>It looked to Larry as though the three had come over to look
for him, though why they should expect to find him in the darkness
was hard to understand. If the sun were in the sky there would
be ground for their hope of outwitting him. The fact remained
that, so far as he knew, young Edwards was still on the other
side of the torrent, and his friend could not hope to do him any
service so long as they were thus separated.</p>

<p>"I must git across and put mesilf in such a position that he
can lean on me, but I'm thinking it won't be the best thing to
try it at this place, where so many may observe me."</p>

<p>It was only ordinary prudence that led Larry Murphy to make this
decision. Brave as he was, and often so to the verge of recklessness,
he was not the sort of person to run into danger unnecessarily.
While it was not to be expected that he would find any more bridges
to use in crossing the stream, there was reason to look for such
a narrowing of the banks that he could make the leap, and he set
out once more to find the spot.</p>

<p>To his disappointment the ground over which he was obliged to
make his way changed for the worse. It became so broken that it
was impossible in some places to progress without making detours
that led him a considerable distance from the stream. As there
was no saying whether or not these diversions were not at the
very places where the water could be leaped, he was in anything
but an agreeable frame of mind. This was not decreased when he
suddenly tumbled down a cavity deep enough to bruise him severely.</p>

<p>His efforts to save himself where his eyes gave no help probably
made the mistake worse.</p>

<p>"I'm thankful that I'm alive," was his honest thought when able
to pull himself together. "I've had the best luck&mdash;whisht!"</p>

<p>At that moment he became aware that he was not alone.</p>
