<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I walked out of that house next morning with Blenkiron’s arm
in mine, a different being from the friendless creature who had
looked vainly the day before for sanctuary. To begin with, I was
splendidly dressed. I had a navy-blue suit with square padded
shoulders, a neat black bow-tie, shoes with a hump at the toe,
and a brown bowler. Over that I wore a greatcoat lined with wolf
fur. I had a smart malacca cane, and one of Blenkiron’s cigars
in my mouth. Peter had been made to trim his beard, and, dressed
in unassuming pepper-and-salt, looked with his docile eyes and
quiet voice a very respectable servant. Old Blenkiron had done
the job in style, for, if you’ll believe it, he had brought the
clothes all the way from London. I realized now why he and Sandy
had been fossicking in my wardrobe. Peter’s suit had been of Sandy’s
procuring, and it was not the fit of mine. I had no difficulty
about the accent. Any man brought up in the colonies can get his
tongue round American, and I flattered myself I made a very fair
shape at the lingo of the Middle West.</p>

<p>The wind had gone to the south and the snow was melting fast.
There was a blue sky above Asia, and away to the north masses
of white cloud drifting over the Black Sea. What had seemed the
day before the dingiest of cities now took on a strange beauty,
the beauty of unexpected horizons and tongues of grey water winding
below cypress-studded shores. A man’s temper has a lot to do with
his appreciation of scenery. I felt a free man once more, and
could use my eyes.</p>

<p>That street was a jumble of every nationality on earth. There
were Turkish regulars in their queer conical khaki helmets, and
wild-looking levies who had no kin with Europe. There were squads
of Germans in flat forage-caps, staring vacantly at novel sights,
and quick to salute any officer on the side-walk. Turks in closed
carriages passed, and Turks on good Arab horses, and Turks who
looked as if they had come out of the Ark. But it was the rabble
that caught the eye—very wild, pinched, miserable rabble. I never
in my life saw such swarms of beggars, and you walked down that
street to the accompaniment of entreaties for alms in all the
tongues of the Tower of Babel. Blenkiron and I behaved as if we
were interested tourists. We would stop and laugh at one fellow
and give a penny to a second, passing comments in high-pitched
Western voices.</p>

<p>We went into a cafe and had a cup of coffee. A beggar came in
and asked alms. Hitherto Blenkiron’s purse had been closed, but
now he took out some small nickels and planked five down on the
table. The man cried down blessings and picked up three. Blenkiron
very swiftly swept the other two into his pocket.</p>

<p>That seemed to me queer, and I remarked that I had never before
seen a beggar who gave change. Blenkiron said nothing, and presently
we moved on and came to the harbour-side.</p>

<p>There were a number of small tugs moored alongside, and one or
two bigger craft—fruit boats, I judged, which used to ply in the
Aegean. They looked pretty well moth-eaten from disuse. We stopped
at one of them and watched a fellow in a blue nightcap splicing
ropes. He raised his eyes once and looked at us, and then kept
on with his business.</p>

<p>Blenkiron asked him where he came from, but he shook his head,
not understanding the tongue. A Turkish policeman came up and
stared at us suspiciously, till Blenkiron opened his coat, as
if by accident, and displayed a tiny square of ribbon, at which
he saluted. Failing to make conversation with the sailor, Blenkiron
flung him three of his black cigars.</p>

<p>"I guess you can smoke, friend, if you can’t talk," he said.</p>

<p>The man grinned and caught the three neatly in the air. Then
to my amazement he tossed one of them back.</p>

<p>The donor regarded it quizzically as it lay on the pavement.
"That boy’s a connoisseur of tobacco," he said. As we moved away
I saw the Turkish policeman pick it up and put it inside his cap.</p>

<p>We returned by the long street on the crest of the hill. There
was a man selling oranges on a tray, and Blenkiron stopped to
look at them. I noticed that the man shuffled fifteen into a cluster.
Blenkiron felt the oranges, as if to see that they were sound,
and pushed two aside. The man instantly restored them to the group,
never raising his eyes.</p>

<p>"This ain’t the time of year to buy fruit," said Blenkiron as
we passed on. "Those oranges are rotten as medlars."</p>

<p>We were almost on our own doorstep before I guessed the meaning
of the business.</p>

<p>"Is your morning’s work finished?" I said.</p>

<p>"Our morning’s walk?" he asked innocently.</p>

<p>"I said ‘work’."</p>

<p>He smiled blandly. "I reckoned you’d tumble to it. Why, yes,
except that I’ve some figuring still to do. Give me half an hour
and I’ll be at your service, Major."</p>

<p>That afternoon, after Peter had cooked a wonderfully good luncheon,
I had a heart-to-heart talk with Blenkiron.</p>

<p>"My business is to get noos," he said; "and before I start on
a stunt I make considerable preparations. All the time in London
when I was yelping at the British Government, I was busy with
Sir Walter arranging things ahead. We used to meet in queer places
and at all hours of the night. I fixed up a lot of connections
in this city before I arrived, and especially a noos service with
your Foreign Office by way of Rumania and Russia. In a day or
two I guess our friends will know all about our discoveries."</p>

<p>At that I opened my eyes very wide.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. You Britishers haven’t any notion how wide-awake your
Intelligence Service is. I reckon it’s easy the best of all the
belligerents. You never talked about it in peace time, and you
shunned the theatrical ways of the Teuton. But you had the wires
laid good and sure. I calculate there isn’t much that happens
in any corner of the earth that you don’t know within twenty-four
hours. I don’t say your highbrows use the noos well. I don’t take
much stock in your political push. They’re a lot of silver-tongues,
no doubt, but it ain’t oratory that is wanted in this racket.
The William Jennings Bryan stunt languishes in war-time. Politics
is like a chicken-coop, and those inside get to behave as if their
little run were all the world. But if the politicians make mistakes
it isn’t from lack of good instruction to guide their steps. If
I had a big proposition to handle and could have my pick of helpers
I’d plump for the Intelligence Department of the British Admiralty.
Yes, Sir, I take off my hat to your Government sleuths."</p>

<p>"Did they provide you with ready-made spies here?" I asked in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why, no," he said. "But they gave me the key, and I could make
my own arrangements. In Germany I buried myself deep in the local
atmosphere and never peeped out. That was my game, for I was looking
for something in Germany itself, and didn’t want any foreign cross-bearings.
As you know, I failed where you succeeded. But so soon as I crossed
the Danube I set about opening up my lines of communication, and
I hadn’t been two days in this metropolis before I had got my
telephone exchange buzzing. Sometime I’ll explain the thing to
you, for it’s a pretty little business. I’ve got the cutest cypher
... No, it ain’t my invention. It’s your Government’s. Any one,
babe, imbecile, or dotard, can carry my messages—you saw some
of them today—but it takes some mind to set the piece, and it
takes a lot of figuring at my end to work out the results. Some
day you shall hear it all, for I guess it would please you."</p>

<p>"How do you use it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I get early noos of what is going on in this cabbage-patch.
Likewise I get authentic noos of the rest of Europe, and I can
send a message to Mr X. in Petrograd and Mr Y. in London, or,
if I wish, to Mr Z. in Noo York. What’s the matter with that for
a post-office? I’m the best informed man in Constantinople, for
old General Liman only hears one side, and mostly lies at that,
and Enver prefers not to listen at all. Also, I could give them
points on what is happening at their very door, for our friend
Sandy is a big boss in the best-run crowd of mountebanks that
ever fiddled secrets out of men’s hearts. Without their help I
wouldn’t have cut much ice in this city."</p>

<p>"I want you to tell me one thing, Blenkiron," I said. "I’ve been
playing a part for the past month, and it wears my nerves to tatters.
Is this job very tiring, for if it is, I doubt I may buckle up."</p>

<p>He looked thoughtful. "I can’t call our business an absolute
rest-cure any time. You’ve got to keep your eyes skinned, and
there’s always the risk of the little packet of dynamite going
off unexpected. But as these things go, I rate this stunt as easy.
We’ve only got to be natural. We wear our natural clothes, and
talk English, and sport a Teddy Roosevelt smile, and there isn’t
any call for theatrical talent. Where I’ve found the job tight
was when I had got to be natural, and my naturalness was the same
brand as that of everybody round about, and all the time I had
to do unnatural things. It isn’t easy to be going down town to
business and taking cocktails with Mr Carl Rosenheim, and next
hour being engaged trying to blow Mr Rosenheim’s friends sky-high.
And it isn’t easy to keep up a part which is clean outside your
ordinary life. I’ve never tried that. My line has always been
to keep my normal personality. But you have, Major, and I guess
you found it wearing."</p>

<p>"Wearing’s a mild word," I said. "But I want to know another
thing. It seems to me that the line you’ve picked is as good as
could be. But it’s a cast-iron line. It commits us pretty deep
and it won’t be a simple job to drop it."</p>

<p>"Why, that’s just the point I was coming to," he said. "I was
going to put you wise about that very thing. When I started out
I figured on some situation like this. I argued that unless I
had a very clear part with a big bluff in it I wouldn’t get the
confidences which I needed. We’ve got to be at the heart of the
show, taking a real hand and not just looking on. So I settled
I would be a big engineer—there was a time when there weren’t
many bigger in the United States than John S. Blenkiron. I talked
large about what might be done in Mesopotamia in the way of washing
the British down the river. Well, that talk caught on. They knew
of my reputation as an hydraulic expert, and they were tickled
to death to rope me in. I told them I wanted a helper, and I told
them about my friend Richard Hanau, as good a German as ever supped
sauerkraut, who was coming through Russia and Rumania as a benevolent
neutral; but when he got to Constantinople would drop his neutrality
and double his benevolence. They got reports on you by wire from
the States—I arranged that before I left London. So you’re going
to be welcomed and taken to their bosoms just like John S. was.
We’ve both got jobs we can hold down, and now you’re in these
pretty clothes you’re the dead ringer of the brightest kind of
American engineer ... But we can’t go back on our tracks. If we
wanted to leave for Constanza next week they’d be very polite,
but they’d never let us. We’ve got to go on with this adventure
and nose our way down into Mesopotamia, hoping that our luck will
hold ... God knows how we will get out of it; but it’s no good
going out to meet trouble. As I observed before, I believe in
an all-wise and beneficent Providence, but you’ve got to give
him a chance."</p>

<p>I am bound to confess the prospect staggered me. We might be
let in for fighting—and worse than fighting—against our own side.
I wondered if it wouldn’t be better to make a bolt for it, and
said so.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I reckon not. In the first place we haven’t
finished our inquiries. We’ve got Greenmantle located right enough,
thanks to you, but we still know mighty little about that holy
man. In the second place it won’t be as bad as you think. This
show lacks cohesion, Sir. It is not going to last for ever. I
calculate that before you and I strike the site of the garden
that Adam and Eve frequented there will be a queer turn of affairs.
Anyhow, it’s good enough to gamble on."</p>

<p>Then he got some sheets of paper and drew me a plan of the dispositions
of the Turkish forces. I had no notion he was such a close student
of war, for his exposition was as good as a staff lecture. He
made out that the situation was none too bright anywhere. The
troops released from Gallipoli wanted a lot of refitment, and
would be slow in reaching the Transcaucasian frontier, where the
Russians were threatening. The Army of Syria was pretty nearly
a rabble under the lunatic Djemal. There wasn’t the foggiest chance
of a serious invasion of Egypt being undertaken. Only in Mesopotamia
did things look fairly cheerful, owing to the blunders of British
strategy. "And you may take it from me," he said, "that if the
old Turk mobilized a total of a million men, he has lost 40 per
cent of them already. And if I’m anything of a prophet he’s going
pretty soon to lose more."</p>

<p>He tore up the papers and enlarged on politics. "I reckon I’ve
got the measure of the Young Turks and their precious Committee.
Those boys aren’t any good. Enver’s bright enough, and for sure
he’s got sand. He’ll stick out a fight like a Vermont game-chicken,
but he lacks the larger vision, Sir. He doesn’t understand the
intricacies of the job no more than a sucking-child, so the Germans
play with him, till his temper goes and he bucks like a mule.
Talaat is a sulky dog who wants to batter mankind with a club.
Both these boys would have made good cow-punchers in the old days,
and they might have got a living out West as the gun-men of a
Labour Union. They’re about the class of Jesse James or Billy
the Kid, excepting that they’re college-reared and can patter
languages. But they haven’t the organizing power to manage the
Irish vote in a ward election. Their one notion is to get busy
with their firearms, and people are getting tired of the Black
Hand stunt. Their hold on the country is just the hold that a
man with a Browning has over a crowd with walking-sticks. The
cooler heads in the Committee are growing shy of them, and an
old fox like David is lying low till his time comes. Now it doesn’t
want arguing that a gang of that kind has got to hang close together
or they may hang separately. They’ve got no grip on the ordinary
Turk, barring the fact that they are active and he is sleepy,
and that they’ve got their guns loaded."</p>

<p>"What about the Germans here?" I asked.</p>

<p>Blenkiron laughed. "It is no sort of a happy family. But the
Young Turks know that without the German boost they’ll be strung
up like Haman, and the Germans can’t afford to neglect an ally.
Consider what would happen if Turkey got sick of the game and
made a separate peace. The road would be open for Russia to the
Aegean. Ferdy of Bulgaria would take his depreciated goods to
the other market, and not waste a day thinking about it. You’d
have Rumania coming in on the Allies’ side. Things would look
pretty black for that control of the Near East on which Germany
has banked her winnings. Kaiser says that’s got to be prevented
at all costs, but how is it going to be done?"</p>

<p>Blenkiron’s face had become very solemn again. "It won’t be done
unless Germany’s got a trump card to play. Her game’s mighty near
bust, but it’s still got a chance. And that chance is a woman
and an old man. I reckon our landlady has a bigger brain than
Enver and Liman. She’s the real boss of the show. When I came
here, I reported to her, and presently you’ve got to do the same.
I am curious as to how she’ll strike you, for I’m free to admit
that she impressed me considerable."</p>

<p>"It looks as if our job were a long way from the end," I said.</p>

<p>"It’s scarcely begun," said Blenkiron.</p>

<p>That talk did a lot to cheer my spirits, for I realized that
it was the biggest of big game we were hunting this time. I’m
an economical soul, and if I’m going to be hanged I want a good
stake for my neck.</p>

<p>Then began some varied experiences. I used to wake up in the
morning, wondering where I should be at night, and yet quite pleased
at the uncertainty. Greenmantle became a sort of myth with me.
Somehow I couldn’t fix any idea in my head of what he was like.
The nearest I got was a picture of an old man in a turban coming
out of a bottle in a cloud of smoke, which I remembered from a
child’s edition of the <em>Arabian Nights</em>. But if he was
dim, the lady was dimmer. Sometimes I thought of her as a fat
old German crone, sometimes as a harsh-featured woman like a schoolmistress
with thin lips and eyeglasses. But I had to fit the East into
the picture, so I made her young and gave her a touch of the languid
houri in a veil. I was always wanting to pump Blenkiron on the
subject, but he shut up like a rat-trap. He was looking for bad
trouble in that direction, and was disinclined to speak about
it beforehand.</p>

<p>We led a peaceful existence. Our servants were two of Sandy’s
lot, for Blenkiron had very rightly cleared out the Turkish caretakers,
and they worked like beavers under Peter’s eye, till I reflected
I had never been so well looked after in my life. I walked about
the city with Blenkiron, keeping my eyes open, and speaking very
civil. The third night we were bidden to dinner at Moellendorff’s,
so we put on our best clothes and set out in an ancient cab. Blenkiron
had fetched a dress suit of mine, from which my own tailor’s label
had been cut and a New York one substituted.</p>

<p>General Liman and Metternich the Ambassador had gone up the line
to Nish to meet the Kaiser, who was touring in those parts, so
Moellendorff was the biggest German in the city. He was a thin,
foxy-faced fellow, cleverish but monstrously vain, and he was
not very popular either with the Germans or the Turks. He was
polite to both of us, but I am bound to say that I got a bad fright
when I entered the room, for the first man I saw was Gaudian.
I doubt if he would have recognized me even in the clothes I had
worn in Stumm’s company, for his eyesight was wretched. As it
was, I ran no risk in dress-clothes, with my hair brushed back
and a fine American accent. I paid him high compliments as a fellow
engineer, and translated part of a very technical conversation
between him and Blenkiron. Gaudian was in uniform, and I liked
the look of his honest face better than ever.</p>

<p>But the great event was the sight of Enver. He was a slim fellow
of Rasta’s build, very foppish and precise in his dress, with
a smooth oval face like a girl’s, and rather fine straight black
eyebrows. He spoke perfect German, and had the best kind of manners,
neither pert nor overbearing. He had a pleasant trick, too, of
appealing all round the table for confirmation, and so bringing
everybody into the talk. Not that he spoke a great deal, but all
he said was good sense, and he had a smiling way of saying it.
Once or twice he ran counter to Moellendorff, and I could see
there was no love lost between these two. I didn’t think I wanted
him as a friend—he was too cold-blooded and artificial; and I
was pretty certain that I didn’t want those steady black eyes
as an enemy. But it was no good denying his quality. The little
fellow was all cold courage, like the fine polished blue steel
of a sword.</p>

<p>I fancy I was rather a success at that dinner. For one thing
I could speak German, and so had a pull on Blenkiron. For another
I was in a good temper, and really enjoyed putting my back into
my part. They talked very high-flown stuff about what they had
done and were going to do, and Enver was great on Gallipoli. I
remember he said that he could have destroyed the whole British
Army if it hadn’t been for somebody’s cold feet—at which Moellendorff
looked daggers. They were so bitter about Britain and all her
works that I gathered they were getting pretty panicky, and that
made me as jolly as a sandboy. I’m afraid I was not free from
bitterness myself on that subject. I said things about my own
country that I sometimes wake in the night and sweat to think
of.</p>

<p>Gaudian got on to the use of water power in war, and that gave
me a chance.</p>

<p>"In my country," I said, "when we want to get rid of a mountain
we wash it away. There’s nothing on earth that will stand against
water. Now, speaking with all respect, gentlemen, and as an absolute
novice in the military art, I sometimes ask why this God-given
weapon isn’t more used in the present war. I haven’t been to any
of the fronts, but I’ve studied them some from maps and the newspapers.
Take your German position in Flanders, where you’ve got the high
ground. If I were a British general I reckon I would very soon
make it no sort of position."</p>

<p>Moellendorff asked, "How?"</p>

<p>"Why, I’d wash it away. Wash away the fourteen feet of soil down
to the stone. There’s a heap of coalpits behind the British front
where they could generate power, and I judge there’s ample water
supply from the rivers and canals. I’d guarantee to wash you away
in twenty-four hours—yes, in spite of all your big guns. It beats
me why the British haven’t got on to this notion. They used to
have some bright engineers."</p>

<p>Enver was on the point like a knife, far quicker than Gaudian.
He cross-examined me in a way that showed he knew how to approach
a technical subject, though he mightn’t have much technical knowledge.
He was just giving me a sketch of the flooding in Mesopotamia
when an aide-de-camp brought in a chit which fetched him to his
feet.</p>

<p>"I have gossiped long enough," he said. "My kind host, I must
leave you. Gentlemen all, my apologies and farewells."</p>

<p>Before he left he asked my name and wrote it down. "This is an
unhealthy city for strangers, Mr Hanau," he said in very good
English. "I have some small power of protecting a friend, and
what I have is at your disposal." This with the condescension
of a king promising his favour to a subject.</p>

<p>The little fellow amused me tremendously, and rather impressed
me too. I said so to Gaudian after he had left, but that decent
soul didn’t agree.</p>

<p>"I do not love him," he said. "We are allies—yes; but friends—no.
He is no true son of Islam, which is a noble faith and despises
liars and boasters and betrayers of their salt."</p>

<p>That was the verdict of one honest man on this ruler in Israel.
The next night I got another from Blenkiron on a greater than
Enver. He had been out alone and had come back pretty late, with
his face grey and drawn with pain. The food we ate—not at all
bad of its kind—and the cold east wind played havoc with his dyspepsia.
I can see him yet, boiling milk on a spirit-lamp, while Peter
worked at a Primus stove to get him a hot-water bottle. He was
using horrid language about his inside.</p>

<p>"My God, Major, if I were you with a sound stomach I’d fairly
conquer the world. As it is, I’ve got to do my work with half
my mind, while the other half is dwelling in my intestines. I’m
like the child in the Bible that had a fox gnawing at its vitals."</p>

<p>He got his milk boiling and began to sip it.</p>

<p>"I’ve been to see our pretty landlady," he said. "She sent for
me and I hobbled off with a grip full of plans, for she’s mighty
set on Mesopotamy."</p>

<p>"Anything about Greenmantle?" I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, no, but I have reached one conclusion. I opine that the
hapless prophet has no sort of time with that lady. I opine that
he will soon wish himself in Paradise. For if Almighty God ever
created a female devil it’s Madame von Einem."</p>

<p>He sipped a little more milk with a grave face.</p>

<p>"That isn’t my duodenal dyspepsia, Major. It’s the verdict of
a ripe experience, for I have a cool and penetrating judgement,
even if I’ve a deranged stomach. And I give it as my considered
conclusion that that woman’s mad and bad—but principally bad."</p>
