<p>And to that word of challenge I made no answer, but I raised my head
and looked into his eyes with a dignity that came to me as my right
from suffering. So regarding each other, we stood for a very short
minute in which the Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, raised his head
from his kisses of salutation upon my hands.
</p><p>"And, <u>mon enfant</u>, is this the good Uncle to whose care you came
into America?" asked that Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, as he
reached out his imprisoned hands for a greeting to my relative.
</p><p>I did not make any answer to that question. My head raised itself yet
higher, and I looked my Gouverneur Faulkner again full in the face
while I waited to hear what he would answer of my kinship to him.
</p><p>"Sir, I am the friend of General Carruthers and I am also the Governor
of the State of Harpeth. I have come across the mountains to talk with
you about the business of this contract for mules for your army and I
have brought your young friend to assist me if I should need
translating from or to you. We Americans, Captain, are poor handlers
of any language not our own, and the matter is of much gravity." And
as the Gouverneur Faulkner spoke those words to my Capitaine, the
Count de Lasselles, with a great courtesy but also a great sternness,
in which he named me not as his friend but as the friend of that
Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, I knew that I was placed by him
among all women liars of the world and that to him his boy Robert of
honor was of a truth dead forever.
</p><p>"It is indeed of such a gravity that I have come from the English
Canada to make all clear to myself," answered my beloved Capitaine,
the Count de Lasselles, as he drew himself to his entire height, which
was well-nigh as great as that of the Gouverneur of the State of
Harpeth.
</p><p>"And I have ridden a day and a night, sir, for the same purpose,"
answered my great Gouverneur Faulkner with that beautiful courtesy of
business I have always observed him to use in the transaction of his
affairs in his office at the Capitol of the State of Harpeth. "And as
one of us must make a beginning, will you not tell me, Captain, why
you are here and in this predicament?"
</p><p>"In a few words I will make all clear to you, Your Excellency," made
answer my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, with an air of courtesy
equal to that of the Gouverneur Faulkner. "I sent down into your State
of Harpeth one of my Commission, to whom I gave the direction that
with a lack of annoying publicity he should investigate the
preparedness of the State of Harpeth to deliver those five thousand of
mules to the Republique of France as was being proposed. Behold, a
report that all is well comes to me, but--ah, it is with sorrow and
shame that such a thing could be done by a son of poor France who
struggles for life!--among the sheets of that report was left by
mistake the fragments of a draft of a letter to an American woman,
which made a partial disclosure of an intended falseness of that
statement to me. Immediately I came alone to interview that false
officer and I find him gone from that small town not far from here
into your Capital. I was seeking to rapidly ride alone by directions
into your Capital city to prevent that he make a signature, which I
had given to him the authority to write, to those papers of so great
an importance. I was thus arrested by that man of great wildness,
whose <u>patois</u> I could not understand as he could not comprehend
the English I make use of, and you see me thus. I beg of you to tell
me if that wicked signature has been made."
</p><p>"The papers have not been signed, thank God, Captain, and your very
impatient lieutenant is being shown some Southern hospitality by the
flower and chivalry of Old Harpeth. And I beg your pardon for allowing
you to be a prisoner a minute longer than necessary," was the answer
made to him by my Gouverneur Faulkner. "Untie the Captain, Jim; he's
all right. And you can bring us a little of your mountain dew while I
clear this table here to use for the papers of our business." And
still my Gouverneur Faulkner did not speak or look at me and in my
heart I then knew that he never would.
</p><p>"I will make all ready," I said as I lifted a large gun, a horn of a
beast full of powder and several pipes with tobacco, from the table of
rough boards that stood under the window for light.
</p><p>"Ah, that is a good release! Thank you that you did not make tight
enough for abrasions your cords, my good man," said my Capitaine, the
Count de Lasselles, as he stretched out his arms and then bent to make
a rubbing of his ankle upon which had been the chain.
</p><p>"I said you warn't no revenue. Here, drink, stranger!" answered the
wild Jim as he handed a bottle of white liquid to my Capitaine, the
Count de Lasselles, and also another to my Gouverneur Faulkner. "That
boy can suck the drippings," he added as he looked at me with humor.
</p><p>"Get cups and water, Jim," commanded my Gouverneur Faulkner with a
smile. "Don't drink it straight, Captain. It will knock you down."
</p><p>"I will procure the cups and the water," I said with rapidity, for I
longed to leave that room for a few moments in which to shake from my
eyes some of the tears that were making a mist before them.
</p><p>"Git a fresh bucket from the spring up the gulch, Bob, while I go beat
the boys outen the bushes with the news that they ain't no revenue.
They'll want to see Bill," was the direction that wild Jim gave to me
as he placed in my hand a rude bucket and pointed up the side of the
hill of great steepness. After so doing he descended around the rock
by the path which we had ascended.
</p><p>"What is it that you shall do now, Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye?"
I wept a question to myself as I dipped that bucket into a clear pool
and made ready to return to the hut. "All is lost to you.
</p><p>"I do not know," I answered to myself.
</p><p>And when I had made a safe return to the hut with a small portion of
the water only remaining in the bucket, for the cause of many slides
in the steep descent from the pool, I found my Gouverneur Faulkner and
my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, engaged deeply in a mass of
papers on the table between them and with no thanks to Roberta, the
Marquise of Grez and Bye, when she served to them tin cups of the
water and a liquid that I had ascertained by tasting to be of fire. I
believe it to be thus that in affairs of business, in the minds of men
all women are become drowned.
</p><p>"Will you write this out for His Excellency, my dear Mademoiselle?"
would request my good Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles.
</p><p>"Thank you," would be the reply I received from the Gouverneur
Faulkner of the State of Harpeth, with never one small look into my
eyes that so besought his.
</p><p>And for all of the hours of that very long afternoon I sat on a low
stool beside the feet of those two great gentlemen and served them in
their communications while the heart in my breast was going into death
by a slow, cruel torture.
</p><p>The exact meaning of those papers and words of business I did not
know, but once I observed my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, throw
down his pencil and look into the face of the Gouverneur Faulkner with
a great and stern astonishment.
</p><p>"The work of grafters, Captain Lasselles, with a woman as a tool. But
I yet don't see just how it was that she worked it. My Secretary of
State, General Carruthers, and I have been at work for weeks and we
could not catch the exact fraud," made answer my Gouverneur Faulkner
with a cold sternness.
</p><p>"I was warned in Paris that beautiful American women were very much
interested in the placing of war contracts, Monsieur le Gouverneur. I
fled upon a tug boat from the ship that I escape some for whom I had
letters of introduction which I could not ignore."
</p><p>"It was your Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, whom that Madam
Whitworth sought upon the ship, Roberta," I said to myself.
</p><p>"I think women are alike the world over, Captain, and the discussion
of them and their mental and moral processes is--fruitless," answered
my Gouverneur Faulkner as he again took up his pencil.
</p><p>"When it happened to me to find the fragment of the letter to the lady
of America from my false lieutenant, I had a deep distress that
tenderness for the sufferings of poor France should fail to be in even
one American woman's heart. And now I am in deep concern. Where am I
to obtain the good strong mules by which to transport through fields
heavy with mud the food to my poor boys in their trenches?"
</p><p>"Right here, Captain, I feel reasonably sure. I think I see a way to
give you what you want at a better figure; and from it no man shall
reap more than a just wage for honest work. As the Governor of the
State of Harpeth, I can give you at least that assurance." And as he
spoke my Gouverneur Faulkner looked the Capitaine, the Count de
Lasselles, in the eyes with a fine honesty that carried with it the
utmost of conviction.
</p><p>"I give thanks to <u>le bon Dieu</u>," I said with words that were
very soft in my throat, but at which I observed the mouth of that
Gouverneur Faulkner to again become as one straight line of coldness.
</p><p>"Indeed, thanks to <u>le bon Dieu</u>, Mademoiselle," made courteous
answer to me my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles. "But how will you
accomplish that purpose. Monsieur le Gouverneur?"
</p><p>"As soon as I've done with these figures I'll have in Jim, your
jailer, and then you'll hear some things about the American mountain
mule that you never heard before, I believe." As he spoke, my
Gouverneur Faulkner proceeded with making figures with his pencil, a
fine glow of eagerness added to that of rage in his eyes very deep
under their brows. "Now, I'll go and call in Jim," he said after a few
minutes of waiting, and left the room in which I was then alone with
my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles, who came to me with outstretched
hands.
</p><p>"Ah, Mademoiselle Roberta," he exclaimed, "I am in a debt of gratitude
to you for bringing this great gentleman, your friend, to my rescue
and also to the solving of this very strange situation concerning
these contracts. Indeed have you accomplished the mission for which
you enlisted: your 'Friends for France.' But before procedure I must
ask you, little lady, why it was that you made a vanishment from that
hotel of Ritz-Carlton in New York. I sought you. I sought out that
Monsieur Peter Scudder to inquire for you. Behold, he also is in
sorrow over the loss of you and had for me a strange news of a cup of
tea thrown in the face of that Mr. Raines of Saint Louis by a member
of your family who had departed immediately into the south of America.
I said to myself, 'The beautiful child does not know that your heart
is in anxiety for her,' and immediately I intended to seek you in the
city, to which the very fine lady, who had reported that 'tea fight'
as she so spoke of it to her paper, directed me after my finding of
her. It is a great ease to my unhappy heart to find you in the care of
a family and friends. I make compliments on your costume of the ride.
I also observed the custom of attire masculine to be on those plains
of the great West where I sought the wheat."
</p><p>"It is a great joy to me, <u>mon Capitaine</u>, that you give to me
your approval. Much has happened to me in these short weeks since you
left me in loneliness on that great ship that I must tell to you," I
said as a sob rose into my words.
</p><p>"Poor little girl, it will not be many hours now before I can say to
you the things that have been growing in my heart for you since that
night upon the ship," he said to me in a great tenderness as he raised
my hand and bent to kiss it just as entered the great Gouverneur
Faulkner and the wild Jim.
</p><p>I had not the courage to gaze upon the face of my Gouverneur Faulkner,
but I felt its coldness strike into my body and turn it to hardness.
</p><p>For a second I stood as a stone, then a sudden resolve rose in me and
again that daredevil seized upon my thought. I took a piece of that
white paper with caution and also a pencil, and with them slipped from
the room, while that wild Jim seated himself upon my lowly stool
beside the table at which again the two great men were writing.
</p><p>And out in the soft light that was now slowly fading from the side of
the mountain because of the retirement of the sun, I sat me down upon
the step of the hut and wrote to my Gouverneur Faulkner this small
letter:
</p><p>    "Honored Excellency, the Gouverneur Faulkner, of the State of
</p><dl>
  <dt>Harpeth</dt>
<dd></dd></dl>
<p>    "I go from you into the trenches of France. If your humble boy
    Robert has done for you any small service, I beg of you in
    that name that my Uncle, the General Robert, and my friends
    never know of my dishonor of lies about my woman's estate, but
    believe me to die as a soldier for France as will be the case.
    Make all clear for me to my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles.
    It is that all women are not lies.
</p><p>          Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye."
</p><p>Then I left that letter upon the doorstep, held in place by the weight
of a stone, and very softly slipped out into the shadows of the
twilight and down the mountain by the path up which that morning I had
come with my beloved Gouverneur Faulkner, then my friend. I felt a
certainty that as many as two hours would those men continue in a
consulting with that wild Jim and in that time by going fleetingly I
could gain the place where were tethered the horses, before a complete
darkness had come. From my honored father I had learned the ways of
woods in hunting and also I knew that the good Lightfoot would in
darkness carry me in safety to his stall in the barn of Mr. Bud Bell,
beside which stood my Cherry. From there I could gain the city of
Hayesville in the dead hours of the night and in those same dead hours
depart to France, after obtaining the money I had left in my desk and
which I had earned by my labors and would not be in the act of
stealing from the State of Harpeth. Only one night and day would I be
alone in the forest and I did not care if a death should overtake me.
In my body my heart was dead and why should I desire the life of that
body?
</p><p>And as I had planned I then accomplished. I discovered that Lightfoot
at pasture and I quickly had placed the saddle upon him and had turned
him down the mountain to choose a safe path for both himself and me. I
did not look upon those cradles of fragrant boughs in which the boy
Robert had lain at rest beside his great friend, the Gouverneur
Faulkner, from whom he had stolen faith and affection.
</p><p>"Why did not you also steal his pocketbook as he lay asleep beside
you, Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye?" I questioned myself with
scorn and torture, as good Lightfoot crashed down from that Camp
Heaven into the dark night.
</p><p>And on we rode, the large horse with the woman upon his back, for a
long night, through fragrant thickets that caught at my riding
breeches with rose tendril fingers and under thick forests of budding
trees, through whose branches of tender leaves the wise old stars
looked down upon my bitter weeping with nothing of comfort, perhaps
because they had grown of a hardness of heart from having seen so many
tears of women drop in the silence of a lonely night.
</p><p>Then came a dawn and a noon and a twilight through which I pushed
forward the large horse with great cruelty, only pausing beside
streams to allow that he drink of the water and also to throw myself
down on my face and lap the cool refreshment like do all humble
things. And, when at last the stars were again there to look down upon
me, we arrived behind the barn of that Bud Bell to find all in the
little house at rest. I thought of that small child in sleep in the
arms of that woman, and a great sobbing came from my heart as I threw
myself into my Cherry, after giving a supper to good Lightfoot, and
fled down the long road to the distant city of Hayesville that lay
away in the valley like a great nest of glowworms in a glade of the
leaves of darkness. And among those glowworms I knew that more than a
hundred friends to me were beginning to go into sleep with deep
affection in their hearts for that Robert Carruthers whom wicked
Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, was about to steal from them. I
wept as I turned my Cherry through the back street and into the garage
of my Uncle, the General Robert. Then I paused. All was quiet in the
house and no light burned in the apartments of my beloved protector
and relative. From the watch at my wrist I ascertained the hour to be
half after ten o'clock, and I knew that he was safely in cards at that
Club of Old Hickory, whose lists now bore the added one of another
Robert Carruthers, man of honor and descendant of its founders. Also
there was no light in the rear of the house in the apartment of that
kind Kizzie, in whose affections I had made a large place. A dim light
burned in the hall and I knew that there I would find my faithful
chocolate Bonbon sitting upon a chair by the great door in a deep
sleep. And in a very few minutes I so found him.
</p><p>"It is hello there, good Bonbon," I greeted him.
</p><p>"Howdy, Mr. Robert," he answered me by a very large smile with very
white teeth set in his face of extreme blackness. "The Gen'l said to
call him on the 'fome as soon as you come."
</p><p>"That I will attend to from my apartment," I answered him and then
ascended the wide dark stairway with feet which were as a weight to my
ankles.
</p><p>Very slowly I entered that apartment and turned on the bright light.
All was in readiness for me, and on the small table under the glass
case that contained that beflowered robe of state of the dead
Grandmamma Carruthers stood a vase of very fresh and innocent young
roses.
</p><p>"I would that I could remain and fulfill the destiny of a woman of
your house, Madam Grandmamma," I whispered to her lovely and smiling
portrait on the wall opposite. "I am the last of the ladies Carruthers
but I have made a forfeit of that destiny and I must go out in the
night again in man's attire to a death that will tear asunder the
tender flesh that you have borne. Good-bye!"
</p><p>Then I made a commencement of a very rapid packing, in one of those
bags which I had purchased from the kind gentleman in the City of New
York, of what raiment I knew would be suitable for a man in very
hurried traveling. I put into it the two suits of clothing for wear in
the daytime, but I discarded all of my clothing for the pursuits of
pleasure. The bag was at that moment full and I did not know that it
could be closed. Then I bethought me of that brown coat that had upon
it the blood which I had been allowed to shed for my beloved
Gouverneur Faulkner who was now lost to me.
</p><p>"That I will take and discard the night raiment, to sleep 'as is' in
the manner spoken of by my friend, that Mr. G. Slade of Detroit," I
counseled myself as I laid aside the silken garments that I did so
like and placed in their stead the bloody coat of many wrinkles.
</p><p>After all of that was accomplished I went into a hot bath and again
quickly began to assume my man's clothing, while from my eyes dripped
the slow tears that bleed from the heart of a woman.
</p><p>"You must make a great hurry, thief Roberta, for it draws near
midnight and that is the hour that the train departs to the North," I
cautioned my weeping self. "At that hour you go forth into the world
alone."
</p><p>And then what ensued?
</p><p>Very suddenly I heard the noise of a car being drawn to the curb in
front of the house and the rapid steps of a man progress along the
pavings of brick to the front door, at which he made a loud ringing.
In not a moment was the good Bonbon at my door with a knocking.
</p><p>"The Governor is here to see you, Mr. Robert," he informed me.
</p><p>"What shall you do, Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye?" I asked of
myself. "How is it that you can be able to support the cold reproaches
he will give to you while requiring that you stay to bring dishonor to
your Uncle, the General Robert? You are caught in a trap as is an
animal."
</p><p>And then as I cowered there in my agony, very suddenly that terrible
daredevil rose within me and gave to me a very strange counsel. As it
was speaking to me my gaze was fixed upon the robe of state of the
beautiful Grandmamma.
</p><p>"Very well, then, that great Gouverneur Faulkner can give his
chastisement and lay his commands upon the beautiful and wicked
Roberta, Marquise of Grez and Bye, in proper person, and not have the
privilege of again addressing his faithful and devoted comrade Robert,
who is dead. I, the Marquise Roberta of Grez and Bye, will accord to
him an interview and in the language of this United States it will be
'some' interview!" With which resolve I turned to make an answer to
the faithful Bonbon at the door.
</p><p>"Where awaits His Excellency, the Gouverneur Faulkner?" I questioned
to him.
</p><p>"In the hall at the bottom of the steps," he made reply to me.
</p><p>"Attend him into the large drawing room for a waiting and make all of
the lights to burn. Say to him that I will descend in a very small
space of time," I commanded.
</p><p>"Yes, sir," he made reply and departed.
