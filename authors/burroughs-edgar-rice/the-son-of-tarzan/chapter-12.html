Two tall, bearded white men moved cautiously through the
jungle from their camp beside a wide river.  They were Carl
Jenssen and Sven Malbihn, but little altered in appearance
since the day, years before, that they and their safari
had been so badly frightened by Korak and Akut as the former
sought haven with them.
<P>
Every year had they come into the jungle to trade with the
natives, or to rob them; to hunt and trap; or to guide other
white men in the land they knew so well.  Always since their
experience with The Sheik had they operated at a safe distance
from his territory.
<P>
Now they were closer to his village than they had been for
years, yet safe enough from discovery owing to the uninhabited
nature of the intervening jungle and the fear and enmity of
Kovudoo's people for The Sheik, who, in time past, had raided
and all but exterminated the tribe.
<P>
This year they had come to trap live specimens for a European
zoological garden, and today they were approaching a trap which
they had set in the hope of capturing a specimen of the large
baboons that frequented the neighborhood.  As they approached
the trap they became aware from the noises emanating from its
vicinity that their efforts had been crowned with success. 
The barking and screaming of hundreds of baboons could mean
naught else than that one or more of their number had fallen a
victim to the allurements of the bait.
<P>
The extreme caution of the two men was prompted by former
experiences with the intelligent and doglike creatures with which
they had to deal.  More than one trapper has lost his life in battle
with enraged baboons who will hesitate to attack nothing upon
one occasion, while upon another a single gun shot will disperse
hundreds of them.
<P>
Heretofore the Swedes had always watched near-by their trap,
for as a rule only the stronger bulls are thus caught, since in
their greediness they prevent the weaker from approaching the
covered bait, and when once within the ordinary rude trap woven
on the spot of interlaced branches they are able, with the aid of
their friends upon the outside, to demolish their prison and escape. 
But in this instance the trappers had utilized a special steel
cage which could withstand all the strength and cunning of a baboon. 
It was only necessary, therefore, to drive away the herd which
they knew were surrounding the prison and wait for their boys who
were even now following them to the trap.
<P>
As they came within sight of the spot they found conditions
precisely as they had expected.  A large male was battering
frantically against the steel wires of the cage that held
him captive.  Upon the outside several hundred other baboons were
tearing and tugging in his aid, and all were roaring and jabbering
and barking at the top of their lungs.
<P>
But what neither the Swedes nor the baboons saw was the
half-naked figure of a youth hidden in the foliage of a
nearby tree.  He had come upon the scene at almost the same
instant as Jenssen and Malbihn, and was watching the activities
of the baboons with every mark of interest.
<P>
Korak's relations with the baboons had never been over friendly. 
A species of armed toleration had marked their occasional meetings. 
The baboons and Akut had walked stiff legged and growling past
one another, while Korak had maintained a bared fang neutrality. 
So now he was not greatly disturbed by the predicament of their king. 
Curiosity prompted him to tarry a moment, and in that moment his
quick eyes caught the unfamiliar coloration of the clothing of the
two Swedes behind a bush not far from him.  Now he was all alertness. 
Who were these interlopers?  What was their business in the jungle
of the Mangani?  Korak slunk noiselessly around them to a point
where he might get their scent as well as a better view of them,
and scarce had he done so when he recognized them--they were the
men who had fired upon him years before.  His eyes blazed.  He could
feel the hairs upon his scalp stiffen at the roots.  He watched them
with the intentness of a panther about to spring upon its prey.
<P>
He saw them rise and, shouting, attempt to frighten away the
baboons as they approached the cage.  Then one of them raised
his rifle and fired into the midst of the surprised and angry herd.
For an instant Korak thought that the baboons were about to
charge, but two more shots from the rifles of the white men sent
them scampering into the trees.  Then the two Europeans advanced
upon the cage.  Korak thought that they were going to kill the king. 
He cared nothing for the king but he cared less for the two
white men.  The king had never attempted to kill him--
the white men had.  The king was a denizen of his own beloved
jungle--the white men were aliens.  His loyalty therefore was to
the baboon against the human.  He could speak the language
of the baboon--it was identical to that of the great apes. 
Across the clearing he saw the jabbering horde watching.
<P>
Raising his voice he shouted to them.  The white men turned
at the sound of this new factor behind them.  They thought it was
another baboon that had circled them; but though they searched
the trees with their eyes they saw nothing of the now silent figure
hidden by the foliage.  Again Korak shouted.
<P>
"I am The Killer," he cried.  "These men are my enemies
and yours.  I will help you free your king.  Run out upon the
strangers when you see me do so, and together we will drive
them away and free your king."
<P>
And from the baboons came a great chorus:  "We will do what
you say, Korak."
<P>
Dropping from his tree Korak ran toward the two Swedes, and
at the same instant three hundred baboons followed his example. 
At sight of the strange apparition of the half-naked
white warrior rushing upon them with uplifted spear Jenssen
and Malbihn raised their rifles and fired at Korak; but in the
excitement both missed and a moment later the baboons were
upon them.  Now their only hope of safety lay in escape, and
dodging here and there, fighting off the great beasts that leaped
upon their backs, they ran into the jungle.  Even then they would
have died but for the coming of their men whom they met a
couple of hundred yards from the cage.
<P>
Once the white men had turned in flight Korak gave them no
further attention, turning instead to the imprisoned baboon. 
The fastenings of the door that had eluded the mental powers of
the baboons, yielded their secret immediately to the human
intelligence of The Killer, and a moment later the king baboon
stepped forth to liberty.  He wasted no breath in thanks to Korak,
nor did the young man expect thanks.  He knew that none of the
baboons would ever forget his service, though as a matter of fact
he did not care if they did.  What he had done had been prompted
by a desire to be revenged upon the two white men.  The baboons
could never be of service to him.  Now they were racing in the
direction of the battle that was being waged between their fellows
and the followers of the two Swedes, and as the din of battle
subsided in the distance, Korak turned and resumed his journey
toward the village of Kovudoo.
<P>
On the way he came upon a herd of elephants standing in an
open forest glade.  Here the trees were too far apart to permit
Korak to travel through the branches--a trail he much preferred
not only because of its freedom from dense underbrush and the wider
field of vision it gave him but from pride in his arboreal ability. 
It was exhilarating to swing from tree to tree; to test the
prowess of his mighty muscles; to reap the pleasurable fruits of
his hard won agility.  Korak joyed in the thrills of the highflung
upper terraces of the great forest, where, unhampered and unhindered,
he might laugh down upon the great brutes who must keep forever
to the darkness and the gloom of the musty soil.
<P>
But here, in this open glade where Tantor flapped his giant
ears and swayed his huge bulk from side to side, the ape-man
must pass along the surface of the ground--a pygmy amongst giants. 
A great bull raised his trunk to rattle a low warning as he
sensed the coming of an intruder.  His weak eyes roved hither
and thither but it was his keen scent and acute hearing which
first located the ape-man.  The herd moved restlessly, prepared
for fight, for the old bull had caught the scent of man.
<P>
"Peace, Tantor," called The Killer.  "It is I, Korak, Tarmangani."
<P>
The bull lowered his trunk and the herd resumed their
interrupted meditations.  Korak passed within a foot of the
great bull. A sinuous trunk undulated toward him, touching his
brown hide in a half caress.  Korak slapped the great shoulder
affectionately as he went by.  For years he had been upon good
terms with Tantor and his people.  Of all the jungle folk he
loved best the mighty pachyderm--the most peaceful and at the
same time the most terrible of them all.  The gentle gazelle
feared him not, yet Numa, lord of the jungle, gave him a
wide berth.  Among the younger bulls, the cows and the calves
Korak wound his way.  Now and then another trunk would run out to
touch him, and once a playful calf grasped his legs and upset him.
<P>
The afternoon was almost spent when Korak arrived at the
village of Kovudoo.  There were many natives lolling in shady
spots beside the conical huts or beneath the branches of the
several trees which had been left standing within the enclosure.
Warriors were in evidence upon hand.  It was not a good time
for a lone enemy to prosecute a search through the village. 
Korak determined to await the coming of darkness.  He was a match
for many warriors; but he could not, unaided, overcome an
entire tribe--not even for his beloved Meriem.  While he waited
among the branches and foliage of a near-by tree he searched
the village constantly with his keen eyes, and twice he circled
it, sniffing the vagrant breezes which puffed erratically from first
one point of the compass and then another.  Among the various
stenches peculiar to a native village the ape-man's sensitive
nostrils were finally rewarded by cognizance of the delicate aroma
which marked the presence of her he sought.  Meriem was there--
in one of those huts!  But which one he could not know without
closer investigation, and so he waited, with the dogged patience
of a beast of prey, until night had fallen.
<P>
The camp fires of the blacks dotted the gloom with little points
of light, casting their feeble rays in tiny circles of luminosity
that brought into glistening relief the naked bodies of those who
lay or squatted about them.  It was then that Korak slid silently
from the tree that had hidden him and dropped lightly to the
ground within the enclosure.
<P>
Keeping well in the shadows of the huts he commenced a
systematic search of the village--ears, eyes and nose constantly
upon the alert for the first intimation of the near presence
of Meriem.  His progress must of necessity be slow since not even
the keen-eared curs of the savages must guess the presence of a
stranger within the gates.  How close he came to a detection on
several occasions The Killer well knew from the restless whining
of several of them.
<P>
It was not until he reached the back of a hut at the head of the
wide village street that Korak caught again, plainly, the scent
of Meriem.  With nose close to the thatched wall Korak sniffed
eagerly about the structure--tense and palpitant as a hunting hound. 
Toward the front and the door he made his way when once his nose
had assured him that Meriem lay within; but as he rounded the
side and came within view of the entrance he saw a burly Negro
armed with a long spear squatting at the portal of the girl's prison. 
The fellow's back was toward him, his figure outlined against the
glow of cooking fires further down the street.  He was alone. 
The nearest of his fellows were beside a fire sixty or seventy
feet beyond.  To enter the hut Korak must either silence the sentry
or pass him unnoticed.  The danger in the accomplishment of the
former alternative lay in the practical certainty of alarming the
warriors near by and bringing them and the balance of the village
down upon him.  To achieve the latter appeared practically impossible. 
To you or me it would have been impossible; but Korak, The Killer,
was not as you or I.
<P>
There was a good twelve inches of space between the broad
back of the black and the frame of the doorway.  Could Korak
pass through behind the savage warrior without detection? 
The light that fell upon the glistening ebony of the sentry's
black skin fell also upon the light brown of Korak's.  Should one
of the many further down the street chance to look long in this
direction they must surely note the tall, light-colored, moving
figure; but Korak depended upon their interest in their own gossip to
hold their attention fast where it already lay, and upon the firelight
near them to prevent them seeing too plainly at a distance into the
darkness at the village end where his work lay.
<P>
Flattened against the side of the hut, yet not arousing a single
warning rustle from its dried thatching, The Killer came closer
and closer to the watcher.  Now he was at his shoulder.  Now he
had wormed his sinuous way behind him.  He could feel the heat
of the naked body against his knees.  He could hear the man breathe. 
He marveled that the dull-witted creature had not long since
been alarmed; but the fellow sat there as ignorant of the presence
of another as though that other had not existed.
<P>
Korak moved scarcely more than an inch at a time, then he
would stand motionless for a moment.  Thus was he worming
his way behind the guard when the latter straightened up, opened
his cavernous mouth in a wide yawn, and stretched his arms
above his head.  Korak stood rigid as stone.  Another step and he
would be within the hut.  The black lowered his arms and relaxed. 
Behind him was the frame work of the doorway.  Often before had
it supported his sleepy head, and now he leaned back to enjoy
the forbidden pleasure of a cat nap.
<P>
But instead of the door frame his head and shoulders came in
contact with the warm flesh of a pair of living legs. 
The exclamation of surprise that almost burst from his lips
was throttled in his throat by steel-thewed fingers that closed
about his windpipe with the suddenness of thought.  The black
struggled to arise--to turn upon the creature that had seized
him--to wriggle from its hold; but all to no purpose.  As he had
been held in a mighty vise of iron he could not move.  He could
not scream. Those awful fingers at his throat but closed more
and more tightly.  His eyes bulged from their sockets.  His face
turned an ashy blue.  Presently he relaxed once more--this time
in the final dissolution from which there is no quickening. 
Korak propped the dead body against the door frame.  There it sat,
lifelike in the gloom.  Then the ape-man turned and glided into
the Stygian darkness of the hut's interior.
<P>
"Meriem!" he whispered.
<P>
"Korak!  My Korak!" came an answering cry, subdued by fear of
alarming her captors, and half stifled by a sob of joyful welcome.
<P>
The youth knelt and cut the bonds that held the girl's wrists
and ankles.  A moment later he had lifted her to her feet, and
grasping her by the hand led her towards the entrance.  Outside the
grim sentinel of death kept his grisly vigil.  Sniffing at his
dead feet whined a mangy native cur.  At sight of the two emerging
from the hut the beast gave an ugly snarl and an instant later
as it caught the scent of the strange white man it raised a series
of excited yelps.  Instantly the warriors at the near-by fire
were attracted.  They turned their heads in the direction of
the commotion.  It was impossible that they should fail to see
the white skins of the fugitives.
<P>
Korak slunk quickly into the shadows at the hut's side, drawing
Meriem with him; but he was too late.  The blacks had seen
enough to arouse their suspicions and a dozen of them were now
running to investigate.  The yapping cur was still at Korak's heels
leading the searchers unerringly in pursuit.  The youth struck
viciously at the brute with his long spear; but, long accustomed
to dodging blows, the wily creature made a most uncertain target.
<P>
Other blacks had been alarmed by the running and shouting
of their companions and now the entire population of the village
was swarming up the street to assist in the search.  Their first
discovery was the dead body of the sentry, and a moment later
one of the bravest of them had entered the hut and discovered
the absence of the prisoner.  These startling announcements filled
the blacks with a combination of terror and rage; but, seeing no
foe in evidence they were enabled to permit their rage to get the
better of their terror, and so the leaders, pushed on by those
behind them, ran rapidly around the hut in the direction of the
yapping of the mangy cur.  Here they found a single white warrior
making away with their captive, and recognizing him as the
author of numerous raids and indignities and believing that they
had him cornered and at a disadvantage, they charged savagely
upon him.
<P>
Korak, seeing that they were discovered, lifted Meriem to his
shoulders and ran for the tree which would give them egress
from the village.  He was handicapped in his flight by the weight
of the girl whose legs would but scarce bear her weight, to say
nothing of maintaining her in rapid flight, for the tightly drawn
bonds that had been about her ankles for so long had stopped
circulation and partially paralyzed her extremities.
<P>
Had this not been the case the escape of the two would have
been a feat of little moment, since Meriem was scarcely a whit
less agile than Korak, and fully as much at home in the trees
as he.  But with the girl on his shoulder Korak could not both
run and fight to advantage, and the result was that before he had
covered half the distance to the tree a score of native curs
attracted by the yelping of their mate and the yells and shouts of
their masters had closed in upon the fleeing white man, snapping
at his legs and at last succeeding in tripping him.  As he went
down the hyena-like brutes were upon him, and as he struggled
to his feet the blacks closed in.
<P>
A couple of them seized the clawing, biting Meriem, and
subdued her--a blow upon the head was sufficient.  For the ape-
man they found more drastic measures would be necessary.
<P>
Weighted down as he was by dogs and warriors he still managed
to struggle to his feet.  To right and left he swung crushing blows
to the faces of his human antagonists--to the dogs he paid not
the slightest attention other than to seize the more persistent and
wring their necks with a single quick movement of the wrist.
<P>
A knob stick aimed at him by an ebon Hercules he caught and
wrested from his antagonist, and then the blacks experienced to
the full the possibilities for punishment that lay within those
smooth flowing muscles beneath the velvet brown skin of the
strange, white giant.  He rushed among them with all the force
and ferocity of a bull elephant gone mad.  Hither and thither he
charged striking down the few who had the temerity to stand
against him, and it was evident that unless a chance spear thrust
brought him down he would rout the entire village and regain
his prize.  But old Kovudoo was not to be so easily robbed of
the ransom which the girl represented, and seeing that their
attack which had up to now resulted in a series of individual
combats with the white warrior, he called his tribesmen off, and
forming them in a compact body about the girl and the two who
watched over her bid them do nothing more than repel the assaults
of the ape-man.
<P>
Again and again Korak rushed against this human barricade
bristling with spear points.  Again and again he was repulsed,
often with severe wounds to caution him to greater wariness. 
From head to foot he was red with his own blood, and at last,
weakening from the loss of it, he came to the bitter realization
that alone he could do no more to succor his Meriem.
<P>
Presently an idea flashed through his brain.  He called aloud
to the girl.  She had regained consciousness now and replied.
<P>
"Korak goes," he shouted; "but he will return and take you
from the Gomangani.  Good-bye, my Meriem.  Korak will come
for you again."
<P>
"Good-bye!" cried the girl.  "Meriem will look for you until
you come."
<P>
Like a flash, and before they could know his intention or
prevent him, Korak wheeled, raced across the village and with
a single leap disappeared into the foliage of the great tree that
was his highroad to the village of Kovudoo.  A shower of spears
followed him, but their only harvest was a taunting laugh flung
back from out the darkness of the jungle.
