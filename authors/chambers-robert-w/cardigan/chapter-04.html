<p>I now for the first time obtained a distinct view of the stranger
as he stepped forward, throwing the blanket from him, and stood
revealed, stark naked save for clout and pouch, truly a superb
figure, and perfect, in the Greek sense, barring that racial leanness
below knee and calf, and the sinewy feet planted parallel instead
of diverging, as in our race.</p>

<p>But so splendid was his presence that Sir William, standing to
receive him, unconsciously raised his chin and squared his shoulders
as though bracing for a trial of strength with this tall red forester
from the West.</p>

<p>For a space they stood face to face in silence; then the belt-bearer,
looking warily around at the empty room, asked why Chief Warragh
received his brother alone.</p>

<p>"My brother comes alone," replied Sir William, with emphasis.
"It is the custom of the Cayuga to send three with each belt.
Does my brother bear but a fragment of one belt? Or does he think
us of little consequence that he comes without attestants?"</p>

<p>"I bear three belts," said the Indian, haughtily. "Nine of my
people started from the Ohio; I alone live."</p>

<p>Sir William bowed gravely; and, motioning me to be seated, drew
up an arm-chair of velvet and sat down, folding his arms in silence.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time in my life, I sat at a figurative council
fire and listened to an orator of those masters of oratory, the
peoples of the Six Nations.</p>

<p>Dignified, chary of gesture, clean, yet somewhat sad and over-grave
of speech, the Cayuga, facing the Baronet, related briefly his
name, Quider, which in Iroquois means Peter; his tribe, which
was the tribe of the Wolf, the totem being plain on his breast.
He spoke of his journey from the Ohio, the loss of the eight who
had started with him; all dying from the small-pox within a week.
He spoke respectfully of Sir William as the one man who had protected
the Six Nations from unjust laws, from incursions, from white
men's violence and deception. He admitted that Sir William was
the only man in America who to-day retained the absolute trust
and confidence of the Indians, adding that it was for this reason
that he had come.</p>

<p>And then he began his brief speech, drawing from his pouch a
black belt of wampum:</p>

<p>"<em>Brother</em>: With this belt we breathe upon the embers
which are asleep, and we cause the council fire to burn in this
place and on the Ohio, which are our proper fireplaces. With this
belt we sweep this fireplace clean, removing from it all that
is impure, that we may sit around it as brothers."</p>

(<em>A belt of seven rows.</em>)

</p>
</div>
<p>"<em>Brother</em>: The unhappy oppression of our brethren by
Colonel Cresap's men, near the Ohio carrying-place, is the occasion
for our coming here. Our nation would not be at rest, nor easy,
until they had spoken to you about it. They have now spoken&mdash;with
this belt!"</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>"<em>Brother</em>: What are we to do? Lord Dunmore will not hear
us. Colonel Cresap and his men, to whom we have done no harm,
are coming to clear the forest and cross our free path which lies
from Saint Sacrement to the Ohio, and which path our brother's
belts, which we still possess, have long since swept clear. What
shall we do? Instead of polishing our knives we have come to our
brother Warragh. Instead of seeking our kin the Mohawk and the
Oneida with painted war belts to throw between us and them, we
come to our brother and ask him, by this belt, what is left for
us to do? Our brothers have taught us there is a God. Teach us
He is a just God&mdash;by this belt!"</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>During this speech Sir William sat as still as death, neither
by glance nor gesture nor change of colour betraying the surprise,
indignation, and alarm which this exposure of Colonel Cresap's
doings caused him.</p>

<p>As for me, I, of course, vaguely understood the breach of faith
committed by Colonel Cresap in invading the land of our allies,
and the danger we might run should this Cayuga chief go to our
Mohawks and Oneidas with war-belts and inflammatory appeals for
vengeance on Cresap and his men.</p>

<p>That he had instead come to us, braving all dangers, losing indeed
all his comrades, on this mission of peace, most splendidly attested
to the power and influence of Sir William among these savages
whose first instinct is to draw the hatchet and begin the horrid
vengeance which they consider their right when unjustly molested.</p>

<p>It is seldom the custom to reply to a speech before the following
day. Custom and tradition rule among the Six Nations. Deliberation
and profound reflection they give to all spokesmen who petition
them, and they require it in turn, regarding with suspicion and
contempt a hasty reply, which, they consider, indicates either
premeditated treachery, or a shallow mind incapable of weighty
and mature reflection.</p>

<p>I was prepared, therefore, when Sir William, holding in his right
hand the three belts of wampum, rose and thanked the Cayuga for
his talk, praising him and his tribe for resorting to arbitration
instead of the hatchet, and promising an answer on the morrow.</p>

<p>The Cayuga listened in silence, then resuming his blanket turned
on his heel and passed slowly and noiselessly from the room, leaving
Sir William standing beside the arm-chair, and me erect in the
embrasure of the casement.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time in my life, I saw a trace of physical
decline in my guardian. His hand, holding the belts, had fallen
a-trembling; he made a feeble gesture for me to be seated, and
sank back into his arm-chair, listless eyes on the floor, absently
running his fingers over the polished belts.</p>

<p>"At sixty," he said, as though to himself, "strong men should
be in that mellow prime to which a sober life conducts."</p>

<p>After a moment he went on: "My life has been sober and without
excess&mdash;but hard! very hard! I am an old man; a tired old man."</p>

<p>Looking up to meet my eyes, he smiled, watching the sympathy
which twitched my face.</p>

<p>"All these wars! All these wars! Thirty years of war!" he murmured,
caressing the belts and letting them slip through his fingers
like smooth shining serpents. "War with the French, war with the
Maquas, the Hurons, the Shawanese, the Ojibways! War in the Canadas,
war in the Carolinas, war east and west and north and south! And
&mdash;I am tired."</p>

<p>He flung the slippery belts to the floor, where they twisted
and coiled up in a heap.</p>

<p>"I have worked with my hands," he said. "This land has drunk
the sweat of my body. I have not spared myself in sickness or
in health. My eyes are dim; I have used them by day, by starlight,
by the glimmer of moons long dead, by candle-wood, by torch, by
the flicker of smoke from green fires.</p>

<p>"My arms are tired; I have hewn forests away; my limbs ache;
I have journeyed far through snow, through heat, from the Canadas
to the Gulf&mdash;all my life I have journeyed on business for other
men&mdash;for men I have never seen, and shall never see&mdash;men yet to
be born!"</p>

<p>There came a flush of earnest colour into his face. He leaned
forward towards me, elbow resting on the table, hand outstretched.</p>

<p>"Why, look you, Michael," he said, with childlike eagerness;
"I found a wilderness and I leave a garden! Look at the valley!
Can England grow such grain? Look at Tryon County! Look at this
Province of New York? Ay&mdash;look farther&mdash;wherever my Indians have
set their boundaries! There are roads, lad, roads where I found
runways; turnpikes where I followed Mohawk trails; mills turning
where the wild-cat squatted, fishing with big flat paws! Lad,
you cannot recall it, yet this village was but a carrying-place
when I came. Look at it; look from the window, lad! Is it not
fair and pretty to the eye? One hundred and eighty families! Three
churches, counting my new stone church; a free school, a court-house,
a jail, barracks&mdash;all built by me; stores with red and blue swinging
signs, bravely painted, inns with the good green bush a-swing!
Listen to the cock-crows; listen to the barking! Might it not
be a Devonshire town? Ah &mdash;I forgot; you have never seen
old England."</p>

<p>Smiling still, kind eyes dreaming, his head sank a little, and
he clasped his hands in his lap.</p>

<p>"Lad," he said, softly, "the English hay smells sweet, but not
so sweet as the Mohawk Valley hay to me. This is my country&mdash;my
country first, last, and all the time. I am too old to change
where in my youth I took root among these hills. To transplant
me means my end."</p>

<p>The sunlight stole into the room through leaded diamond-panes
and fell across his knees like a golden robe. The music from the
robins in the orchard filled my ears; soft winds stirred the lace
on Sir William's cuffs and collarette.</p>

<p>Presently he roused, shaking the dream from his eyes; and, watching
him, it seemed to me I could see the very tide of life swelling
flesh and muscle into new vigour. The colour came back into his
face and hands; the light grew in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said, in a voice that had lost its tremour. "Life
has but one meaning&mdash;to go on, ever on, lad! 'Tis a long doze
awaits us at the journey's end." And he fumbled for his snuff-box
and lace hanker, blowing a vigorous blast and exclaiming, "Aha!
Ho!" in deep tones which, when very young, awed me.</p>

<p>I bent and picked up the three belts, placing them on the table
near him.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Michael," he said, heartily; "and I must say that
in this matter of the Cayuga, you have conducted admirably. Mr.
Duncan has told me all; it was wisely done. Had you received the
Cayuga with less welcome or more suspicion, or had you met him
haughtily, I do not doubt that he would have made mischief for
me among my Mohawks."</p>

<p>"He had war-sticks painted red, in his pouch, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"No doubt! No doubt! And a red war-belt, too, belike! They were
meant for my Mohawks had he met with a rebuff here. Oh, I know
them, Michael, I know them. A painted war-belt flung between that
Cayuga and the sachems of my Mohawks would have set the whole
Six Nations&mdash;save, perhaps, the Oneidas&mdash;a-shining up rifle and
hatchet for Cresap and his men!"</p>

<p>Sir William struck the mahogany table with clinched fist.</p>

<p>"Damn Cresap!" he bawled, in one of his familiar fits of fury&mdash;fits
which were never witnessed outside his family circle. "Damn the
fatuous fool to go a-meddling with the Cayugas in their own lands,
held by them in solemn covenant forever inviolate! What does the
sorry ass want? A border war, with all this trouble betwixt King
and colonies hatching? Does Colonel Cresap not know that a single
scalp taken from the Cayugas will set the Six Nations on fire&mdash;ay,
the Lenape, too?"</p>

<p>Sir William slapped the table again with the flat of his hand.</p>

<p>"Look, Michael; should war come betwixt King and colonies, neither
King nor colonies should forget that our frontiers are crowded
with thousands of savages who, if adroitly treated, will remain
neutral and inoffensive. Yet here is this madman Cresap, on the
very eve of a struggle with the greatest power in the world, turning
the savages against the colonies by his crazy pranks on the Ohio!"</p>

<p>"But," said I, "in his blindness and folly, Colonel Cresap is
throwing into our arms these very savages as allies!"</p>

<p>Sir William stopped short and stared at me with cold, steady
eyes.</p>

<p>"Michael," said he, presently, "when this war comes&mdash;as surely
it will come&mdash;choose which cause you will embrace, and then stand
by it to the end. As for me, I cannot believe that God would let
me live to see such a war; that He would leave me to choose between
the King who has honoured me and mine own people in this dear
land of mine!"</p>

<p>He raised his head and passed one hand over his eyes.</p>

<p>"But should He in His wisdom demand that I choose&mdash;and if the
sorrow kills me not&mdash;then, when the time comes, I shall choose."</p>

<p>"Which way, sir?" I said, in a sort of gasp.</p>

<p>But he only answered, "Wait!"</p>

<p>Stupefied, I watched him. It had never entered my head that there
could be any course save unquestioned loyalty to the King in all
things; that there could be any doubt or hesitation or pondering
or praying for light when it came time to choose between King
and rebel.</p>

<p>I now recalled what Sir William had said to me in the school-room.
Putting this with what he now said, or left unsaid, together with
his anger at Colonel Cresap for endangering the peace betwixt
the Indians and the colonies, I came to the frightened conclusion
that Sir William's loyalty might be questioned. But by whom? Who
in America was great enough to call Sir William to account? Not
Governor Tryon; not Lord Dunmore; not General Gage.</p>

<p>Feeling as though the bottom had fallen out of something, I sat
there, my fascinated eyes never leaving Sir William's sombre face.</p>

<p>What then were these tea-hating rebels that Sir William should
defend them at breakfast and in the faces of half a dozen of his
Majesty's officers? I knew nothing of the troubles in Massachusetts
save from soldiers' talk or the gossip of the townsmen, most of
them being tenants of Sir William. I had heard vaguely about one
turbulent fellow named Hancock, and a mischief-making jack-at-all-trades
called Franklin. I knew that the trouble concerned taxes, but
as all this bother appeared to be about a few pennies, and as
I myself never wanted for money, I had little sympathy for people
who made such an ado about a shilling or two. Moreover, if the
King needed money, the idea of not placing one's all at his Majesty's
disposal seemed contemptible to me. It is true that I had never
earned a farthing in all my life, and so had nothing to offer
my sovereign, save what fortune my father had left in trust for
me. It is also true that I knew nothing of the value of money,
having neither earned it nor wanted for it.</p>

<p>Something of these thoughts may have been easily read in my face,
for Sir William said, with some abruptness:</p>

<p>"It is not money; it is principle that men fight for."</p>

<p>I was startled, although Sir William sometimes had a way of rounding
out my groping thoughts with sudden spoken words which made me
fear him.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said, laughing and rising to stretch his cramped
limbs; "this is enough for one day, Michael. Let the morrow fret
for itself, lad. Come, smile a bit! Shall we have a holiday, perhaps
the last for many a month? Nay, do not look so sober, Micky. Who
knows what will come? Who knows; who knows?"</p>

<p>"I shall stand by you, sir, whatever comes," said I.</p>

<p>But Sir William only smiled, drawing me to him, one arm about
me.</p>

<p>"Suppose," said he, "that you and I and Mr. Duncan and Felicity
and Peter and Esk take rods and bait and go a-fishing in the Kennyetto
by Fonda's Bush!"</p>

<p>"A peg-down fishing match!" cried I, enchanted.</p>

<p>"Ay, a peg-down match, and the prize whatever the victor wills&mdash;in
reason. What say you, Michael?"</p>

<p>I was about to assent with enthusiasm when something occurred
to me and I stopped.</p>

<p>"May I wear my uniform, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Gad!" cried Sir William, in a fit of laughter. "'Tis a bolder
man than I who dare separate you from your uniform!"</p>

<p>"Then I'll carry my pistols and go a-horse!" said I, delighted.</p>

<p>The Baronet, hands clasped behind him, nodded absently. That
old gray colour came into his face again, and he lifted a belt
from the table and studied it dreamily, picking at the wampum
which glowed like a snake's skin in the sunshine.</p>
