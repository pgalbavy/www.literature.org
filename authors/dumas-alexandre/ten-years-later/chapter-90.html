<P>Raoul quitted the Palais-Royal full of ideas that admitted
no delay in execution. He mounted his horse in the
courtyard, and followed the road to Blois, while the
marriage festivities of Monsieur and the princess of England
were being celebrated with exceeding animation by the
courtiers, but to the despair of De Guiche and Buckingham.
Raoul lost no time on the road, and in sixteen hours he
arrived at Blois. As he traveled along, he marshaled his
arguments in the most becoming manner. Fever also is an
argument that cannot be answered, and Raoul had an attack.
Athos was in his study, making additions to his memoirs,
when Raoul entered, accompanied by Grimaud. Keen-sighted and
penetrating, a mere glance at his son told him that
something extraordinary had befallen him.</P>
<P>&quot;You seem to come on a matter of importance,&quot; said he to
Raoul, after he had embraced him, pointing to a seat.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur,&quot; replied the young man; &quot;and I entreat you
to give me the same kind attention that has never yet failed
me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Speak, Raoul.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I present the case to you, monsieur, free from all preface,
for that would be unworthy of you. Mademoiselle de la
Valliere is in Paris as one of Madame's maids of honor. I
have pondered deeply on the matter; I love Mademoiselle de
la Valliere above everything; and it is not proper to leave
her in a position where her reputation, her virtue even, may
be assailed. It is my wish, therefore, to marry her,
monsieur, and I have come to solicit your consent to my
marriage.&quot;</P>
<P>While this communication was being made to him, Athos
maintained the profoundest silence and reserve. Raoul, who
had begun his address with an assumption of self-possession,
finished it by allowing a manifest emotion to escape him at
every word. Athos fixed upon Bragelonne a searching look,
overshadowed indeed by a slight sadness.</P>
<P>&quot;You have reflected well upon it?&quot; he inquired.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I believe you are already acquainted with my views
respecting this alliance?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur,&quot; replied Raoul, in a low tone of voice, &quot;but
you added, that if I persisted  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You do persist, then?&quot;</P>
<P>Bragelonne stammered out an almost unintelligible assent.</P>
<P>&quot;Your passion,&quot; continued Athos, tranquilly, &quot;must indeed be
very great, since, notwithstanding my dislike to this union,
you persist in wishing it.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul passed his trembling hand across his forehead to
remove the perspiration that collected there. Athos looked
at him, and his heart was touched by pity. He rose and said,
 -  - </P>
<P>&quot;It is no matter. My own personal feelings are not to be
taken into consideration since yours are concerned; you need
my assistance; I am ready to give it. Tell me what you
want.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your kind indulgence, first of all, monsieur,&quot; said Raoul,
taking hold of his hand.</P>
<P>&quot;You have mistaken my feelings, Raoul, I have more than mere
indulgence for you in my heart.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul kissed as devotedly as a lover could have done the
hand he held in his own.</P>
<P>&quot;Come, come,&quot; said Athos, &quot;I am quite ready; what do you
wish me to sign?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing whatever, monsieur. only it would be very kind if
you would take the trouble to write to the king to whom I
belong, and solicit his majesty's permission for me to marry
Mademoiselle de la Valliere.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well thought, Raoul! After, or rather before myself, you
have a master to consult, that master being the king; it is
loyal in you to submit yourself voluntarily to this double
proof; I will grant your request without delay, Raoul.&quot;</P>
<P>The count approached the window, and leaning out, called to
Grimaud, who showed his head from an arbor covered with
jasmine, which he was occupied in trimming.</P>
<P>&quot;My horses, Grimaud,&quot; continued the count.</P>
<P>&quot;Why this order, monsieur?&quot; inquired Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;We shall set off in a few hours.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Whither?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For Paris.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Paris, monsieur?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is not the king at Paris?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, ought we not to go there?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur,&quot; said Raoul, almost alarmed by this kind
condescension. &quot;I do not ask you to put yourself to such
inconvenience, and a letter merely  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You mistake my position, Raoul; it is not respectful that a
simple gentleman, such as I am, should write to his
sovereign. I wish to speak, I ought to speak, to the king,
and I will do so. We will go together, Raoul.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You overpower me with your kindness, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How do you think his majesty is affected?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Towards me, monsieur?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Excellently well disposed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know that to be so?&quot; continued the count.</P>
<P>&quot;The king has himself told me so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On what occasion?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Upon the recommendation of M. d'Artagnan, I believe, and on
account of an affair in the Place de Greve, when I had the
honor to draw my sword in the king's service. I have reason
to believe that, vanity apart, I stand well with his
majesty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So much the better.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I entreat you, monsieur,&quot; pursued Raoul, &quot;not to
maintain towards me your present grave and serious manner.
Do not make me bitterly regret having listened to a feeling
stronger than anything else.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is the second time you have said so, Raoul; it was
quite unnecessary, you require my formal consent, and you
have it. We need talk no more on the subject, therefore.
Come and see my new plantations, Raoul.&quot;</P>
<P>The young man knew very well, that, after the expression of
his father's wish, no opportunity of discussion was left
him. He bowed his head, and followed his father into the
garden. Athos slowly pointed out to him the grafts, the
cuttings, and the avenues he was planting. This perfect
repose of manner disconcerted Raoul extremely; the affection
with which his own heart was filled seemed so great that the
whole world could hardly contain it. How, then, could his
father's heart remain void, and closed to its influence?
Bragelonne, therefore, collecting all his courage, suddenly
exclaimed,  -  - </P>
<P>&quot;It is impossible, monsieur, you can have any reason to
reject Mademoiselle de la Valliere? In Heaven's name, she is
so good, so gentle and pure, that your mind, so perfect in
its penetration, ought to appreciate her accordingly. Does
any secret repugnance, or any hereditary dislike, exist
between you and her family?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Look, Raoul, at that beautiful lily of the valley,&quot; said
Athos; &quot;observe how the shade and the damp situation suit
it, particularly the shadow which that sycamore-tree casts
over it, so that the warmth, and not the blazing heat of the
sun, filters through its leaves.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul stopped, bit his lips, and then with the blood
mantling in his face, he said, courageously,  -  &quot;One word of
explanation, I beg, monsieur. You cannot forget that your
son is a man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In that case,&quot; replied Athos, drawing himself up with
sternness, &quot;prove to me that you are a man, for you do not
show yourself a son. I begged you to wait the opportunity of
forming an illustrious alliance. I would have obtained a
wife for you from the first ranks of the rich nobility. I
wish you to be distinguished by the splendor which glory and
fortune confer, for nobility of descent you have already.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; exclaimed Raoul, carried away by a first
impulse, &quot;I was reproached the other day for not knowing who
my mother was.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos turned pale; then, knitting his brows like the
greatest of all the heathen deities:  -  &quot;I am waiting to
learn the reply you made,&quot; he demanded, in an imperious
manner.</P>
<P>&quot;Forgive me! oh, forgive me,&quot; murmured the young man,
sinking at once from the lofty tone he had assumed.</P>
<P>&quot;What was your reply, monsieur?&quot; inquired the count,
stamping his feet upon the ground.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur, my sword was in my hand immediately, my adversary
placed himself on guard, I struck his sword over the
palisade, and threw him after it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why did you suffer him to live?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The king has prohibited duelling, and, at that moment, I
was an ambassador of the king.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Athos, &quot;but all the greater reason I
should see his majesty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you intend to ask him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Authority to draw my sword against the man who has
inflicted this injury upon me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If I did not act as I ought to have done, I beg you to
forgive me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did I reproach you, Raoul?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Still, the permission you are going to ask from the king?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will implore his majesty to sign your marriage-contract,
but on one condition.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are conditions necessary with me, monsieur? Command, and
you shall be obeyed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On one condition, I repeat,&quot; continued Athos; &quot;that you
tell me the name of the man who spoke of your mother in that
way.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What need is there that you should know his name; the
offense was directed against myself, and the permission once
obtained from his majesty, to revenge it is my affair.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tell me his name, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will not allow you to expose yourself.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you take me for a Don Diego? His name, I say.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You insist upon it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I demand it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Vicomte de Wardes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Athos, tranquilly, &quot;I know him. But our
horses are ready, I see; and, instead of delaying our
departure for a couple of hours, we will set off at once.
Come, monsieur.&quot;</P></article>
