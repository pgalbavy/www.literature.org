<p>Pausing on the edge of the natural clearing which had been the
scene of the terrific race between himself and Blazing Arrow,
Wharton looked back, and in the gathering darkness saw a flickering
figure on the farther side, where the trail re-entered the wood,
and he knew it was that of the champion runner of his tribe, whom
he had not only defeated in the contest of fleetness, but in the
singular battle of wits which followed.</p>

<p>"I'd wager a good deal, if I had a chance," muttered the lad,
"that he feels just a little impatient with himself. I am quite
sure that matters haven't gone to suit him."</p>

<p>It was in the power of the youth to turn the tables still more
completely on the dusky miscreant. He had but to wait where he
was until he was within easy range, and then shoot him down. It
need not be said, however, after what had taken place a short
time before, that this was a crime which nothing could have induced
young Edwards to commit, even though he knew the Shawanoe was
as eager as a tiger to secure his life.</p>

<p>"We're likely to come together again before this business is
over," he reflected, "where I won't feel so much like letting
you alone as I do now."</p>

<p>There was one uncomfortable proceeding which he did not mean
to undergo; that was to have Blazing Arrow dogging at his heels
like a sneaking wolf awaiting the chance to pounce upon him unawares.
It is hard to imagine a more trying situation than that of knowing
an enemy is stealing behind you in the darkness, on the alert
to dart forward when your vigilance is relaxed, and make his attack
with the deadly quickness of the rattlesnake.</p>

<p>Walking but a short way, Wharton stepped aside from the trail
and stood motionless among the trees, where an owl would not have
noticed him in flying along the path. He was not kept waiting
many minutes. A soft tap-tap sounded on the ground as Blazing
Arrow, in a loping trot, left the clearing and plunged into the
wood, and then a faint, shadowy figure was dimly seen moving between
the trees.</p>

<p>Directly opposite Wharton it came to a halt. Because of the obscurity
he could not be seen except in motion, but the watcher knew what
that meant. He was listening. He could not be assured what the
youth in front was doing, and since his experience with him, the
redskin understood that he had a young man above the ordinary
as his antagonist.</p>

<p>A minute later Wharton saw something flicker in the gloom. The
Shawanoe had started on again. This time he did not trot, for
the protruding limbs interfered and would have made too much rustling.
He walked rapidly enough, however, to overtake any one going at
the usual rate.</p>

<p>Waiting until he believed he was at a safe distance in advance,
the lad stepped back upon the trail and continued his journey
toward the war party, where he hoped to be of service to his friend.</p>

<p>Since the white and red men had exchanged situations, Wharton
had now to guard against running into the one in advance. If the
Shawanoe should learn what had been done he would be sure to try
some trick on the youth. By crouching along the path he could
leap upon him as he passed and bear him helplessly to the ground.</p>

<p>It need not be said that young Edwards was on the alert. He could
not have been more so, frequently pausing to listen, or to use
his eyes, so far as possible, in the darkness.</p>

<p>Unable to hear anything through the air, he knelt down and pressed
his ear to the ground. That served him no better, and he slowed
his progress, and stopped more frequently.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he has any suspicion that I am behind him?"
was his thought. "It may be," he added grimly, "that he is thinking
what sort of yarn to get up to explain why he hasn't brought me
with him. If I am not careful he may nab me after all. I'd like
to know whether he still has the headache, or whether he hasn't
set me down as a fool for letting him off when I had the chance
to finish him."</p>

<p>If it should so prove that Blazing Arrow was not aware that,
instead of following the white youth, the reverse was the case,
the space between them was certainly increasing, for one was going
slow and the other fast.</p>

<p>When the distance passed became considerable, Wharton began to
feel hope. They were close to where he had already undergone several
stirring adventures, and he was almost certain the savage runner
knew nothing of his whereabouts. Finally he turned off from the
trail almost at the point where he had started to run away from
Blazing Arrow and his companions.</p>

<p>Attentively listening and watching, he heard nothing, and then
began a guarded examination of the immediate neighborhood. It
was there the Shawanoes had crouched when he bounded across the
gorge in quest of his rifle, but it was not to be expected that
they had remained there ever since. The examination convinced
him that all had moved somewhere else.</p>

<p>Wharton's concern being now for Larry Murphy, he did some close
reasoning.</p>

<p>"I know he will, risk his life to help me, whom he naturally
thinks is in a bad way, but how is he going to do it, or how has
he got across to this side of the torrent? He can't make the leap
that I did, and I am quite sure he wouldn't try to swim, because
that would compel him to go below the falls. The chances are that
he is on the other side."</p>

<p>This conclusion, it will be perceived, was correct; but had the
reasoner known of that fallen tree spanning the gorge, it is likely
his decision would have been different.</p>

<p>Before repeating the leap he had already made, Wharton spent
more time in what may be called reconnoitering.</p>

<p>It was altogether beyond reason that the Shawanoes should be
looking for any such performance, and with little hesitation,
therefore, he walked out from the shadow, ran across the moonlit
space of rocks, and, with the same ease and grace as before, placed
himself on the other bank. He quickly scurried to cover, and then
awaited the result.</p>

<p>It was nothing, so far as he could tell. Still at a loss which
way to turn or what to do, but hoping that Larry might be somewhere
within reach, he made the signal which has been described elsewhere.</p>

<p>"If he hears that he will know what it means. By gracious, he
has heard it!"</p>

<p>From a point close at hand, and directly behind him, came the
response, although, as the reader well knows, it was not the lips
of Larry Murphy that made it.</p>
