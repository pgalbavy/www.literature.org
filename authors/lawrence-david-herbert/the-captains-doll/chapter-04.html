<p>'Won't you come and have tea with me - do!  Come right along now.
Don't you find it bitterly cold?  Yes - well now - come in with me
and we'll have a cup of nice, hot tea in our little sitting-room.
The weather changes so suddenly, and really one needs a little
reinforcement.  But perhaps you don't take tea?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes.  I got so used to it in England,' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'Did you now!  Well now, were you long in England?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes - '</p>

<p>The two women had met in the Domplatz.  Mrs Hepburn was looking
extraordinarily like one of Hannele's dolls, in a funny little cape
of odd striped skins, and a little dark-green skirt, and a rather
fuzzy sort of hat.  Hannele looked almost huge beside her.</p>

<p>'But now you will come in and have tea, won't you?  Oh, please do.
Never mind whether it's de rigueur or not.  I ALWAYS please myself
WHAT I do.  I'm afraid my husband gets some shocks sometimes - but
that we can't help.  I won't have anybody laying down the law to
me.'  She laughed her winsome little laugh.'  So now come along in,
and we'll see if there aren't hot scones as well.  I love a hot
scone for tea in cold weather.  And I hope you do.  That is, if
there are any.  We don't know yet.'  She tinkled her little laugh.
'My husband may or may not be in.  But that makes no difference to
you and me, does it?  There, it's just striking half past four.  In
England, we always have tea at half past.  My husband ADORES his
tea.  I don't suppose our man is five minutes off the half past,
ringing the gong for tea, not once in twelve months.  My husband
doesn't mind at all if dinner is a little late.  But he gets - 
quite - well, quite &quot;ratty&quot; if tea is late.'  She tinkled a laugh.
'Though I shouldn't say that.  He is the soul of kindness and
patience.  I don't think I've ever known him do an unkind thing - or
hardly say an unkind word.  But I doubt if he will be in today.'</p>

<p>He WAS in, however, standing with his feet apart and his hands in
his trouser pockets in the little sitting-room upstairs in the
hotel.  He raised his eyebrows the smallest degree, seeing Hannele
enter.</p>

<p>'Ah, Countess Hannele - my wife has brought you along!  Very nice,
very nice!  Let me take your wrap.  Oh yes, certainly . . .'</p>

<p>'Have you rung for tea, dear?' asked Mrs Hepburn.</p>

<p>'Er - yes.  I said as soon as you came in they were to bring it.'</p>

<p>'Yes - well.  Won't you ring again, dear, and say for THREE.'</p>

<p>'Yes - certainly.  Certainly.'</p>

<p>He rang, and stood about with his hands in his pockets waiting for
tea.</p>

<p>'Well now,' said Mrs Hepburn, as she lifted the tea-pot, and her
bangles tinkled, and her huge rings of brilliants twinkled, and her
big ear-rings of clustered seed-pearls bobbed against her rather
withered cheek,' isn't it charming of Countess zu - Countess zu - '</p>

<p>'Rassentlow,' said he.  'I believe most people say Countess
Hannele.  I know we always do among ourselves.  We say Countess
Hannele's shop.'</p>

<p>'Countess Hannele's shop!  Now, isn't that perfectly delightful:
such a romance in the very sound of it.  You take cream?'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said Hannele.</p>

<p>The tea passed in a cloud of chatter, while Mrs Hepburn manipulated
the tea-pot, and lit the spirit-flame, and blew it out, and peeped
into the steam of the tea-pot, and couldn't see whether there was
any more tea or not - and - 'At home I KNOW - I was going to say to a
teaspoonful - how much tea there is in the pot.  But this tea-pot - I
don't know what it's made of - it isn't silver, I know that - it is
so heavy in itself that it's deceived me several times already.
And my husband is a greedy man, a greedy man - he likes at least
three cups - and four if he can get them, or five!  Yes, dear, I've
plenty of tea today.  You shall have even five, if you don't mind
the last two weak.  Do let me fill your cup, Countess Hannele.  I
think it's a CHARMING name.'</p>

<p>'There's a play called Hannele, isn't there?' said he.</p>

<p>When he had had his five cups, and his wife had got her cigarette
perched in the end of a long, long, slim, white holder, and was
puffing like a little Chinawoman from the distance, there was a
little lull.</p>

<p>'Alec, dear,' said Mrs Hepburn.  'You won't forget to leave that
message for me at Mrs Rackham's.  I'm so afraid it will be
forgotten.'</p>

<p>'No, dear, I won't forget.  Er - would you like me to go round now?'</p>

<p>Hannele noticed how often he said 'er' when he was beginning to
speak to his wife.  But they WERE such good friends, the two of
them.</p>

<p>'Why, if you WOULD, dear, I should feel perfectly comfortable.  But
I don't want you to hurry one bit.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I may as well go now.'</p>

<p>And he went.  Mrs Hepburn detained her guest.</p>

<p>'He IS so charming to me,' said the little woman.  'He's really
wonderful.  And he always has been the same - invariably.  So that
if he DID make a little slip - well, you know, I don't have to take
it so seriously.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Hannele, feeling as if her ears were stretching with
astonishment.</p>

<p>'It's the war.  It's just the war.  It's had a terribly
deteriorating effect on the men.'</p>

<p>'In what way?' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'Why, morally.  Really, there's hardly one man left the same as he
was before the war.  Terribly degenerated.'</p>

<p>'Is that so?' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'It is indeed.  Why, isn't it the same with the German men and
officers?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I think so,' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'And I'm sure so, from what I hear.  But of course it is the women
who are to blame in the first place.  We poor women!  We are a
guilty race, I am afraid.  But I never throw stones.  I know what
it is myself to have temptations.  I have to flirt a little - and
when I was younger - well, the men didn't escape me, I assure you.
And I was SO often scorched.  But never QUITE singed.  My husband
never minded.  He knew I was REALLY safe.  Oh yes, I have always
been faithful to him.  But still - I have been very near the flame.'
And she laughed her winsome little laugh.</p>

<p>Hannele put her fingers to her ears to make sure they were not
falling off.</p>

<p>'Of course during the war it was terrible.  I know that in a
certain hospital it was quite impossible for a girl to stay on if
she kept straight.  The matrons and sisters just turned her out.
They wouldn't have her unless she was one of themselves.  And you
know what that means.  Quite like the convent in Balzac's story - 
you know which I mean, I'm sure.'  And the laugh tinkled gaily.</p>

<p>'But then, what can you expect, when there aren't enough men to go
round!  Why, I had a friend in Ireland.  She and her husband had
been an ideal couple, an IDEAL couple.  Real playmates.  And you
can't say more than that, can you?  Well, then, he became a major
during the war.  And she was so looking forward, poor thing, to the
perfectly lovely times they would have together when he came home.
She is like me, and is lucky enough to have a little income of her
own - not a great fortune - but - well - Well now, what was I going to
say?  Oh yes, she was looking forward to the perfectly lovely times
they would have when he came home: building on her dreams, poor
thing, as we unfortunate women always do.  I suppose we shall never
be cured of it.'  A little tinkling laugh.  'Well now, not a bit of
it.  Not a bit of it.'  Mrs Hepburn lifted her heavily-jewelled
little hand in a motion of protest.  It was curious, her hands were
pretty and white, and her neck and breast, now she wore a little
tea-gown, were also smooth and white and pretty, under the medley
of twinkling little chains and coloured jewels.  Why should her
face have played her this nasty trick of going all crumpled!
However, it was so.</p>

<p>'Not one bit of it,' reiterated the little lady.  'He came home
quite changed.  She said she could hardly recognize him for the
same man.  Let me tell you one little incident.  Just a trifle, but
significant.  He was coming home - this was some time after he was
free from the army - he was coming home from London, and he told her
to meet him at the boat: gave her the time and everything.  Well,
she went to the boat, poor thing, and he didn't come.  She waited,
and no word of explanation or anything.  So she couldn't make up
her mind whether to go next day and meet the boat again.  However,
she decided she wouldn't.  So of course, on that boat he arrived.
When he got home, he said to her:  &quot;Why didn't you meet the boat?&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I went yesterday, and you didn't come.&quot;  &quot;Then
why didn't you meet it again today?&quot;  Imagine it, the sauce!  And
they had been real playmates.  Heart-breaking isn't it?  &quot;Well,&quot;
she said in self-defence, &quot;why didn't you come yesterday?&quot;  &quot;Oh,&quot;
he said, &quot;I met a woman in town whom I liked, and she asked me to
spend the night with her, so I did.&quot;  Now what do you think of
that?  Can you conceive of such a thing?'</p>

<p>'Oh no,' said Hannele.  'I call that unnecessary brutality.'</p>

<p>'Exactly!  So terrible to say such a thing to her!  The brutality
of it!  Well, that's how the world is today.  I'm thankful my
husband isn't that sort.  I don't say he's perfect.  But whatever
else he did, he'd never be unkind, and he COULDN'T be brutal.  He
just couldn't.  He'd never tell me a lie - I know THAT.  But callous
brutality, no, thank goodness, he hasn't a spark of it in him.  I'm
the wicked one, if either of us is wicked.'  The little laugh
tinkled.  'Oh, but he's been perfect to me, perfect.  Hardly a
cross word.  Why, on our wedding night, he kneeled down in front of
me and promised, with God's help, to make my life happy.  And I
must say, as far as possible, he's kept his word.  It has been his
one aim in life, to make my life happy.'</p>

<p>The little lady looked away with a bright, musing look towards the
window.  She was being a heroine in a romance.  Hannele could see
her being a heroine, playing the chief part in her own life
romance.  It is such a feminine occupation, that no woman takes
offence when she is made audience.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I've more of the woman than the mother in my
composition,' resumed the little heroine.  'I adore my two
children.  The boy is at Winchester, and my little girl is in a
convent in Brittany.  Oh, they are perfect darlings, both of them.
But the man is first in my mind, I'm afraid.  I fear I'm rather
old-fashioned.  But never mind.  I can see the attractions in other
men - can't I indeed!  There was a perfectly exquisite creature - he
was a very clever engineer - but much, much more than THAT.  But
never mind.'  The little heroine sniffed as if there were perfume
in the air, folded her jewelled hands, and resumed:  'However - I
know what it is myself to flutter round the flame.  You know I'm
Irish myself, and we Irish can't help it.  Oh, I wouldn't be
English for anything.  Just that little touch of imagination, you
know . . .'  The little laugh tinkled.  'And that's what makes me
able to sympathize with my husband even when, perhaps, I shouldn't.
Why, when he was at home with me, he never gave a thought, not a
thought to another woman.  I must say, he used to make ME feel a
little guilty sometimes.  But there!  I don't think he ever thought
of another woman as being flesh and blood, after he knew me.  I
could tell.  Pleasant, courteous, charming - but other women were
not flesh and blood to him, they were just people, callers - that
kind of thing.  It used to amaze me, when some perfectly lovely
creature came, whom I should have been head over heels in love with
in a minute - and he, he was charming, delightful; he could see her
points, but she was no more to him than, let me say, a pot of
carnations or a beautiful old piece of punto di Milano.  Not flesh
and blood.  Well, perhaps one can feel too safe.  Perhaps one needs
a tiny pinch of salt of jealousy.  I believe one does.  And I have
not had one jealous moment for seventeen years.  So that, REALLY,
when I heard a whisper of something going on here, I felt almost
pleased.  I felt exonerated for my own little peccadilloes, for one
thing.  And I felt he was perhaps a little more human.  Because,
after all, it is nothing but human to fall in love, if you are
alone for a long time and in the company of a beautiful woman - and
if you're an attractive man yourself.'</p>

<p>Hannele sat with her eyes propped open and her ears buttoned back
with amazement, expecting the next revelations.</p>

<p>'Why, of course,' she said, knowing she was expected to say
something.</p>

<p>'Yes, of course,' said Mrs Hepburn, eyeing her sharply.  'So I
thought I'd better come and see how far things had gone.  I had
nothing but a hint to go on.  I knew no name - nothing.  I had just
a hint that she was German, and a refugee aristocrat - and that he
used to call at the studio.'  The little lady eyed Hannele sharply,
and gave a breathless little laugh, clasping her hands nervously.
Hannele sat absolutely blank: really dazed.</p>

<p>'Of course,' resumed Mrs Hepburn, 'that was enough.  That was quite
a sufficient clue.  I'm afraid my intentions when I called at the
studio were not as pure as they might have been.  I'm afraid I
wanted to see something more than the dolls.  But when you showed
me HIS doll, then I knew.  Of course there wasn't a shadow of doubt
after that.  And I saw at once that she loved him, poor thing.  She
was SO agitated.  And no idea who I was.  And you were so unkind to
show me the doll.  Of course, you had no idea who you were showing
it to.  But for her, poor thing, it was such a trial.  I could see
how she suffered.  And I must say she's very lovely - she's very,
very lovely, with her golden skin and her reddish amber eyes and
her beautiful, beautiful carriage.  And such a na&iuml;ve, impulsive
nature.  Give everything away in a minute.  And then her deep
voice - &quot;Oh yes - Oh, please!&quot; - such a child.  And such an
aristocrat, that lovely turn of her head, and her simple, elegant
dress.  Oh, she's very charming.  And she's just the type I always
knew would attract him, if he hadn't got me.  I've thought about it
many a time - many a time.  When a woman is older than a man, she
does think these things - especially if he has his attractive points
too.  And when I've dreamed of the woman he would love if he hadn't
got me, it has always been a Spanish type.  And the Baroness is
extraordinarily Spanish in her appearance.  She must have had some
noble Spanish ancestor.  Don't you think so?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' said Hannele.'  There were such a lot of Spaniards in
Austria, too, with the various emperors.'</p>

<p>'With Charles V, exactly.  Exactly.  That's how it must have been.
And so she has all the Spanish beauty, and all the German feeling.
Of course, for myself, I miss the RESERVE, the haughtiness.  But
she's very, very lovely, and I'm sure I could never HATE her.  I
couldn't even if I tried.  And I'm not going to try.  But I think
she's much too dangerous for my husband to see much of her.  Don't
you agree, now?'</p>

<p>'Oh, but really,' stammered Hannele.  'There's nothing in it,
really.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said the little lady, cocking her head shrewdly aside, 'I
shouldn't like there to be any MORE in it.'</p>

<p>And there was a moment's dead pause.  Each woman was reflecting.
Hannele wondered if the little lady was just fooling her.</p>

<p>'Anyhow,' continued Mrs Hepburn, 'the spark is there, and I don't
intend the fire to spread.  I am going to be very, very careful,
myself, not to fan the flames.  The last thing I should think of
would be to make my husband scenes.  I believe it would be fatal.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Hannele, during the pause.</p>

<p>'I am going very carefully.  You think there isn't much in it - 
between him and the Baroness?'</p>

<p>'No - no - I'm sure there isn't,' cried Hannele, with a full voice of
conviction.  She was almost indignant at being slighted so
completely herself, in the little lady's suspicions.</p>

<p>'Hm! - mm!' hummed the little woman, sapiently nodding her head
slowly up and down.  'I'm not so sure!  I'm not so sure that it
hasn't gone pretty far.'</p>

<p>'Oh NO!' cried Hannele, in real irritation of protest.</p>

<p>'Well,' said the other.  'In any case, I don't intend it to go any
farther.'</p>

<p>There was dead silence for some time.</p>

<p>'There's more in it than you say.  There's more in it than you
say,' ruminated the little woman.  'I know HIM, for one thing.  I
know he's got a cloud on his brow.  And I know it hasn't left his
brow for a single minute.  And when I told him I had been to the
studio, and showed him the cushion-cover, I knew he felt guilty.  I
am not so easily deceived.  We Irish all have a touch of second
sight, I believe.  Of course I haven't challenged him.  I haven't
even mentioned the doll.  By the way, WHO ordered the doll?  Do you
mind telling me?'</p>

<p>'No, it wasn't ordered,' confessed Hannele.</p>

<p>'Ah - I thought not - I thought not!' said Mrs Hepburn, lifting her
finger.  'At least, I knew no outsider had ordered it.  Of course I
knew.'  And she smiled to herself.</p>

<p>'So,' she continued, 'I had too much sense to say anything about
it.  I don't believe in stripping wounds bare.  I believe in gently
covering them and letting them heal.  But I DID say I thought her a
lovely creature.'  The little lady looked brightly at Hannele.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'And he was very vague in his manner, &quot;Yes, not bad,&quot; he said.  I
thought to myself:  Aha, my boy, you don't deceive me with your NOT
BAD.  She's very much more than not bad.  I said so, too.  I
wanted, of course, to let him know I had a suspicion.'</p>

<p>'And do you think he knew?'</p>

<p>'Of course he did.  Of course he did.  &quot;She's much too dangerous,&quot;
I said, &quot;to be in a town where there are so many strange men:
married and unmarried.&quot;  And then he turned round to me and gave
himself away, oh, so plainly.  &quot;Why?&quot; he said.  But such a haughty,
distant tone.  I said to myself:  &quot;It's time, my dear boy, you were
removed out of the danger zone.&quot;  But I answered him:  Surely
somebody is bound to fall in love with her.  Not at all, he said,
she keeps to her own countrymen.  You don't tell ME, I answered
him, with her pretty broken English!  It is a wonder the two of
them are allowed to stay in the town.  And then again he rounded on
me.  Good gracious! he said.  Would you have them turned out just
because they're beautiful to look at, when they have nowhere else
to go, and they make their bit of a livelihood here?  I assure you,
he hasn't rounded on me in that overbearing way, not once before,
in all our married life.  So I just said quietly:  I should like to
protect OUR OWN MEN.  And he didn't say anything more.  But he
looked at me under his brows and went out of the room.'</p>

<p>There was a silence.  Hannele waited with her hands in her lap, and
Mrs Hepburn mused, with her hands in HER lap.  Her face looked
yellow, and VERY wrinkled.</p>

<p>'Well now,' she said, breaking again suddenly into life.  'What are
we to do?  I mean what is to be done?  You are the Baroness's
nearest friend.  And I wish her NO harm, none whatever.'</p>

<p>'What can we do?' said Hannele, in the pause.</p>

<p>'I have been urging my husband for some time to get his discharge
from the army,' said the little woman.  'I knew he could have it in
three months' time.  But like so many more men, he has no income of
his own, and he doesn't want to feel dependent.  Perfect nonsense!
So he says he wants to stay on in the army.  I have never known him
before go against my real wishes.'</p>

<p>'But it IS better for a man to be independent,' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'I know it is.  But it is also better for him to be AT HOME.  And I
could get him a post in one of the observatories.  He could do
something in meteorological work.'</p>

<p>Hannele refused to answer any more.</p>

<p>'Of course,' said Mrs Hepburn, 'if he DOES stay on here, it would
be much better if the Baroness left the town.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure she will never leave of her own choice,' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'I'm sure she won't either.  But she might be made to see that it
would be very much WISER of her to move of her own free will.'</p>

<p>'Why?' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'Why, because she might any time be removed by the British
authorities.'</p>

<p>'Why should she?' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'I think the women who are a menace to our men should be removed.'</p>

<p>'But she is NOT a menace to your men.'</p>

<p>'Well, I have my own opinion on that point.'</p>

<p>Which was a decided deadlock.</p>

<p>'I'm sure I've kept you an awful long time with my chatter,' said
Mrs Hepburn.  'But I did want to make everything as simple as
possible.  As I said before, I can't feel any ill-will against her.
Yet I can't let things just go on.  Heaven alone knows when they
may end.  Of course if I can persuade my husband to resign his
commission and come back to England - anyhow, we will see.  I'm sure
I am the last person in the world to bear malice.'</p>

<p>The tone in which she said it conveyed a dire threat.</p>

<p>Hannele rose from her chair.</p>

<p>'Oh, and one other thing,' said her hostess, taking out a tiny lace
handkerchief and touching her nose delicately with it.  'Do you
think' - dab, dab - 'that I might have that DOLL - you know - ?'</p>

<p>'That - ?'</p>

<p>'Yes, of my husband' - the little lady rubbed her nose with her
kerchief.</p>

<p>'The price is three guineas,' said Hannele.</p>

<p>'Oh indeed!' - the tone was very cold.  'I thought it was not for
sale.'</p>

<p>Hannele put on her wrap.</p>

<p>'You'll send it round - will you? - if you will be so kind.'</p>

<p>'I must ask my friend first.'</p>

<p>'Yes, of course.  But I'm sure she will be so kind as to send it
me.  It is a little - er - indelicate, don't you think!'</p>

<p>'No,' said Hannele.  'No more than a painted portrait.'</p>

<p>'Don't you?' said her hostess coldly.  'Well, even a painted
portrait I think I should like in my own possession.  This DOLL - '</p>

<p>Hannele waited, but there was no conclusion.</p>

<p>'Anyhow,' she said, 'the price is three guineas: or the equivalent
in marks.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' said the little lady, 'you shall have your three
guineas when I get the doll.'</p>
