<p>The broad streets of Vegas were swarming with traffic as Wiley glided
swiftly into town and he noticed that people looked at him curiously.
Perhaps it was all imagination but it seemed to him they eyed him
coldly. Yet what they thought or felt was nothing to him then--his
business was with Samuel J. Blount. The mine was unprotected--he had
not even told his foreman that he was leaving, or where he was
going--and there was no time for anything but business. If there was
any trouble for him, Samuel J. Blount was at the bottom of it, and he
drove straight up to the bank. It was a huge, granite structure with
massive onyx pillars and smiling young clerks at the grilles; but he
hurried past them all and turned down a hall to a room that was
marked: President--Private. This was no time for dallying or sending
in cards--he opened the door and stepped in.
</p><p>Samuel Blount was sitting at the head of a table with other men grouped
about him, but as Wiley Holman entered they were silent. He glanced at
Blount and then again at the men--they were the directors of the
Paymaster Mining and Milling Company!
</p><p>"Good morning, Mr. Holman," spoke up Blount with asperity. "Please wait
for me out in the hall."
</p><p>"Since when?" retorted Wiley and then, leaping to the point, "what about
that deed to the Paymaster?"
</p><p>"Why--you must be misinformed," replied Blount slowly, at the same time
pressing a button, "this is a meeting of the Board of Directors."
</p><p>"So I see," returned Wiley, "but I sent the money by Virginia to take up
the option on the mine. Did you receive it or did you not?"
</p><p>A broad-shouldered man, very narrow between the eyes, came in and stood
close to Wiley, and Blount smiled and cleared his throat.
</p><p>"No," he said, "we did not receive it?"
</p><p>"Oh, you didn't, eh?" said Wiley, glancing up at the janitor. "Perhaps
you will tell me if it was offered to you?"
</p><p>"No, it was not offered to us," replied Blount, smiling blandly,
"although Miss Huff did make a deposit."
</p><p>"Of fifty thousand dollars?"
</p><p>"No, it was more than that--fifty-two, I believe. It was deposited to
your account."
</p><p>"Oh," observed Wiley, and looked them over again as the directors turned
around to scowl. "Well, perhaps I can see Miss Huff?"
</p><p>"She is not here at present," replied Blount with finality, "and so I
must ask you to withdraw."
</p><p>"Just a moment," said Wiley, as the janitor moved expectantly. "I came
here on a matter of business with you and this Board of Directors and,
since the matter is urgent, I must request an immediate hearing. You
don't need to be alarmed--all I want is my answer and then I'll leave
you alone. In the first place, Mr. Blount, will you please tell me the
circumstances under which this deposit was made? I gave Miss Huff
instructions to offer the money to you in payment for the Paymaster
Mine."
</p><p>"Oh! Instructions, eh?" piped Blount with a satirical smile, and the
Board stirred and nodded significantly. "Well, since you've just come in
and are evidently unaware of the wide interest that has been taken in
this case, I'll tell you a few things, Mr. Holman. The people of this
town do not approve of the manner in which you have treated Mrs. Huff;
and as for your 'instructions' to Virginia, let me tell you right now
that we have saved her from becoming your victim."
</p><p>"My victim!" repeated Wiley, moving swiftly towards him, but the janitor
caught him by the arm.
</p><p>"Yes, your victim," answered Blount with a venomous sneer, "or, at
least, your intended victim. The people of Vegas had nothing to say when
you deprived Virginia and her mother of their livelihood--it was your
privilege as lessee of the mine to board your own men if you chose--but
when you had the effrontery to send Virginia to this Board with
'instructions' to jeopardize her own interests, we felt called on to
interfere."
</p><p>"Why, you're crazy!" burst out Wiley. "What interests did she jeopardize
by making that payment for me? As a matter of fact it was just the
contrary--I gave her the money to get back the stock that you had
practically stolen from her mother!"
</p><p>"Now! Now!" spoke up Blount, "we won't have any personalities, or I'll
ask Mr. Jepson to remove you. You must know if you know anything that
Virginia herself had over twelve thousand shares of stock; while her
mother left with me, as collateral on a note, more than two hundred
thousand shares more. Yet you asked this innocent girl, who trusted you
so fully, to wipe out her whole inheritance at one blow. You asked her
to come here and make a payment that would beat her out of half a
million dollars--_for fifty thousand dollars!_"
</p><p>He paused and the men about the table murmured threateningly among
themselves.
</p><p>"And now!" went on Blount with heavy irony, "you come here and ask for
your deed!"
</p><p>"Yes, you bet I do!" snapped back Wiley, "and I'm going to get it, too.
If Virginia came here and offered you that money, that's enough, in the
eyes of the law. It was a legal payment under a legal contract, entered
into by this Board of Directors; and I call you gentlemen to witness
that she came here and offered the money."
</p><p>"She came to <u>me</u>!" corrected Blount, "and in no wise as the
President of this Board!"
</p><p>"Well, you're the man that I told her to go to--and if she offered you
the money, that's enough!"
</p><p>"Oh, it's enough, is it? Well, it may be enough for you, but it is not
enough for the citizens of this town. We have organized a committee, of
which Mr. Jepson is a member, to escort you out of Vegas; and I would
say further that your bond and lease has lapsed and the Company will
take over the mine."
</p><p>"We'll discuss that later," returned Wiley grimly, "but I'll tell you
right now that there aren't men enough in Vegas to run me out of
town--not if you call in the whole town and the Janitors' Union--so
don't try to start anything rough. I'm a law-abiding citizen, and I
know my rights, and I'm going to see this through." He put his back to
the wall and the burly Jepson took the hint to move further away.
"Now," said Wiley, "if we understand each other let's get right down
to brass tacks. It's all very well to organize Vigilance Committees
for the protection of trusting young ladies, but you know and I know
that this is a matter of business, involving the title to a mine. And
I'd like to say further that, when a Board of Directors talks a
messenger out of her purpose and persuades her to disregard her
instructions----"
</p><p>"Instructions!" bellowed Blount.
</p><p>"Yes--instructions!" repeated Wiley, "--instructions as my agent. I sent
Miss Huff down here to make this payment and I gave her instructions
regarding it."
</p><p>"Do you realize," blustered Blount, "that if she had followed those
instructions she would have defrauded her own mother out of millions;
that she would have ruined her own life and conferred her father's
fortune upon the very man who was deceiving her?"
</p><p>"No, I do not," replied Wiley, "but even if I did, that has nothing to
do with the case. As to my relations with Miss Huff, I am fully
satisfied that she has nothing of which to complain; and since it was
you, and the rest of the gang, who stood to lose by the deal, your
indignation seems rather far-fetched. If you were sorry for Miss Huff
and wished to help her you have abundant private means for doing so; but
when you dissuade her from her purpose in order to save your own skin
you go up against the law. I'm going to take this to court and when the
evidence is heard I'm going to prove you a bunch of crooks. I don't
believe for a minute that Virginia turned against me. I know that she
offered you the money."
</p><p>"Oh, you know, do you?" sneered Blount as his Directors rallied about
him. "Well, how are you going to prove it?"
</p><p>"By her own word!" said Wiley. "I know her too well. You just talked her
out of it, afterward."
</p><p>"So you think," taunted Blount, "that she offered the money in payment,
and demanded the delivery of the deed? And will you stand or fall on her
testimony?"
</p><p>"Absolutely!" smiled Wiley, "and if she tells me she didn't do it I'll
never take the matter into court."
</p><p>"Very well," replied Blount and turned towards the door, but the
Directors rushed in and caught him. They thrust their heads together in
a whispered, angry conference, now differing among themselves and now
flying back to catch Blount, but in the end he shook them all off. "No,
gentlemen," he said, "I have absolute confidence in the justice of my
case. If you stand to lose a little I stand to lose a great deal--and I
know she never asked for that deed!"
</p><p>"Well, bring her in, then," they conceded reluctantly, and turned
venomous eyes upon Wiley. They knew him, and they feared him, and
especially with this girl; for he was smiling and waiting confidently.
But Blount was their czar, with his great block of stock pitted against
their tiny holdings, and they sat down to await the issue.
</p><p>She came at last, ushered in through the back door by Blount, who smiled
benevolently; and her eyes leapt on the instant to meet Wiley's.
</p><p>"Here is Miss Huff," announced Blount deliberately and the light died
in Wiley's shining eyes. He had waited for her confidently, but that
one defiant flash told him that Virginia had turned against him. She
had thrown in her lot with Blount, and against her lover, and by her
word he must stand or fall. She had been his agent, but if she had not
carried out her trust---- "Any questions you would like to ask," went
on Blount with ponderous calm, "I am sure Virginia will answer."
</p><p>He turned reassuringly and she nodded her head nervously, then stepped
out and stood facing Wiley.
</p><p>"It is a question," began Wiley, speaking like one in a dream, "of the
way you paid Mr. Blount that money. When you took it to him first,
before they had talked to you, did you tell him it was my payment on the
option?"
</p><p>Virginia glanced at Blount, then she took a deep breath and drew herself
up very straight.
</p><p>"No," she said, "I spoke to him first about buying back father's stock."
</p><p>"But after that," he said, "didn't you hand him over the money and say
it was sent by me?"
</p><p>"No, I didn't," she answered. "After the way you had treated me I didn't
think it was right."
</p><p>"Not right!" he repeated with a slow, dazed smile. "Why--why wasn't it
right, Virginia?"
</p><p>"Because," she went on, "you were trying to deceive me and beat me and
mother out of our rights. You knew all the time that father's stock was
still ours--and that Mr. Blount never even claimed it!"
</p><p>"Never claimed it!" cried Wiley, suddenly roused to resentment. "Well,
Virginia, he most certainly did! He offered to sell it to me for five
cents a share when I took out that option on the Paymaster!"
</p><p>"Now, now, Wiley!" began Blount, but Virginia cut him short with a
scornful wave of the hand.
</p><p>"Never mind," she said. "I'll attend to this myself. I just want to tell
him what I think!"
</p><p>"What you <u>think</u>!" raved Wiley, suddenly coming up fighting.
"You've been fooled by a bunch of crooks. Never mind what you think--did
you give him the money and tell him it came from me?"
</p><p>"I did not!" answered Virginia, her eyes flashing with hot anger, "and
while I may not be able to think, I certainly wasn't fooled by
<u>you</u>. No, I took your money and put it in the bank, and I let your
option expire!"
</p><p>"My--God!" moaned Wiley, and groped for the door, but in the hall he
stopped and turned back. There was some mistake--she had not understood.
He slipped back and looked in once more. She was shaking hands with
Blount--and smiling.
