<p>Unlike most other plants the International Machine Company paid on
Monday, and it was on the Monday following his assumption of his new
duties that Jimmy had his first clash with Bince. He had been talking
with Everett, the cashier, whom, in accordance with his "method," he was
studying. From Everett he had learned that it was pay-day and he had
asked the cashier to let him see the pay-roll.
</p><p>"I don't handle the pay-roll," replied Everett a trifle peevishly.
"Shortly after Mr. Bince was made assistant general manager a new rule
was promulgated, to the effect that all salaries and wages were to be
considered as confidential and that no one but the assistant general
manager would handle the pay-rolls. All I know is the amount of the
weekly check. He hires and fires everybody and pays everybody."
</p><p>"Rather unusual, isn't it?" commented Jimmy.
</p><p>"Very," said Everett. "Here's some of us have been with Mr. Compton
since Bince was in long clothes, and then he comes in here and says that
we are not to be trusted with the pay-roll."
</p><p>"Well," said Jimmy, "I shall have to go to him to see it then."
</p><p>"He won't show it to you," said Everett.
</p><p>"Oh, I guess he will," said Jimmy, and a moment later he knocked at
Bince's office door. When Bince saw who it was he turned back to his
work with a grunt.
</p><p>"I am sorry, Torrance," he said, "but I can't talk with you just now.
I'm very busy."
</p><p>"Working on the pay-roll?" said Jimmy.  "Yes," snarled Bince.
</p><p>"That's what I came in to see," said the efficiency expert.
</p><p>"Impossible," said Bince.  "The International Machine Company's pay-roll
is confidential, absolutely confidential. Nobody sees it but me or Mr.
Compton if he wishes to."
</p><p>"I understood from Mr. Compton," said Jimmy, "that I was to have full
access to all records."
</p><p>"That merely applied to operation records," said Bince.  "It had nothing
to do with the pay-roll."
</p><p>"I should consider the pay-roll very closely allied to operations,"
responded Jimmy.
</p><p>"I shouldn't," said Bince.
</p><p>"You won't let me see it then?" demanded Jimmy.
</p><p>"Look here," said Bince, "we agreed that we wouldn't interfere with each
other. I haven't interfered with you. Now don't you interfere with me.
This is my work, and my office is not being investigated by any
efficiency expert or any one else."
</p><p>"I don't recall that I made any such agreement," said Jimmy.  "I must
insist on seeing that pay-roll."
</p><p>Bince turned white with suppressed anger, and then suddenly slamming his
pen on the desk, he wheeled around toward the other.
</p><p>"I might as well tell you something," he said, "that will make your path
easier here, if you know it. I understand that you want a permanent job
with us. If you do you might as well understand now as any other time
that you have got to be satisfactory to me. Of course, it is none of
your business, but it may help you to understand conditions when I tell
you that I am to marry Mr. Compton's daughter, and when I do that he
expects to retire from business, leaving me in full charge here. Now, do
you get me?"
</p><p>Jimmy had involuntarily acquired antipathy toward Bince at their first
meeting, an antipathy which had been growing the more that he saw of the
assistant general manager. This fact, coupled with Bince's present
rather nasty manner, was rapidly arousing the anger of the efficiency
expert. "I didn't come in here," he said, "to discuss your matrimonial
prospects, Mr. Bince. I came in here to see the pay-roll, and you will
oblige me by letting me see it."
</p><p>"I tell you again," said Bince, "once and for all, that you don't see
the pay-roll nor anything else connected with my office, and you will
oblige me by not bothering me any longer. As I told you when you first
came in, I am very busy."
</p><p>Jimmy turned and left the room.  He was on the point of going to
Compton's office and asking for authority to see the pay-roll, and then
it occurred to him that Compton would probably not take sides against
his assistant general manager and future son-in-law.
</p><p>"I've got to get at it some other way," said Jimmy, "but you bet your
life I'm going to get at it. It looks to me as though there's something
funny about that pay-roll."
</p><p>On his way out he stopped at Everett's cage. "What was the amount of the
check for the pay-roll for this week, Everett?" he asked.
</p><p>"A little over ninety-six hundred dollars."
</p><p>"Thanks," said Jimmy, and returned to the shops to continue his study of
his men, and as he studied them he asked many questions, made many notes
in his little note-book, and always there were two questions that were
the same: "What is your name? What wages do you get?"
</p><p>"I guess," said Jimmy, "that in a short time I will know as much about
the payroll as the assistant general manager."
</p><p>Nor was it the pay-roll only that claimed Jimmy's attention. He found
that several handlings of materials could be eliminated by the adoption
of simple changes, and that a rearrangement of some of the machines
removed the necessity for long hauls from one part of the shop to
another. After an evening with the little volume he had purchased for
twenty-five cents in the second-hand bookshop he ordered changes that
enabled him to cut five men from the pay-roll and at the same time do
the work more expeditiously and efficiently.
</p><p>"Little book," he said one evening, "I take my hat off to you. You are
the best two-bits' worth I ever purchased."
</p><p>The day following the completion of the changes he had made in the shop
he was in Compton's office.
</p><p>"Patton was explaining some of the changes you have made," remarked
Compton. Patton was the shop foreman. "He said they were so simple that
he wondered none of us had thought of them before. I quite agree with
him."
</p><p>"So do I," returned Jimmy, "but, then, my whole method is based upon
simplicity." And his mind traveled to the unpretentious little book on
the table in his room on Indiana Avenue.
</p><p>"The feature that appeals to me most strongly is that you have been able
to get the cooperation of the men," continued Compton "that's what I
feared--that they wouldn't accept your suggestions. How did you do it?"
</p><p>"I showed them how they could turn out more work and make more money by
my plan. This appealed to the piece-workers. I demonstrated to the
others that the right way is the easiest way--I showed them how they
could earn their wages with less effort."
</p><p>"Good," said Compton. "You are running into no difficulties then?  Is
there any way in which I can help you?"
</p><p>"I am getting the best kind of cooperation from the men in the shop,
practically without exception," replied Jimmy, "although there is one
fellow, a straw boss named Krovac, who does not seem to take as kindly
to the changes I have made as the others, but he really doesn't amount
to anything as an obstacle." Jimmy also thought of Bince and the
pay-roll, but he was still afraid to broach the subject. Suddenly an
inspiration came to him.
</p><p>"Yes," he said, "I believe your accounting system could be improved--it
will take me months to get around to it, as my work is primarily in the
shop, at first, at least. You can save both time and money by having
your books audited by a firm of public accountants who can also suggest
a new and more up-to-date system."
</p><p>"Not a bad idea," said Compton. "I think we will do it."
</p><p>For another half-hour they discussed Jimmy's work, and then as the
latter was leaving Compton stopped him.
</p><p>"By the way, you don't happen to know of a good stenographer, do you?
Miss Withe is leaving me Saturday."
</p><p>Jimmy thought a moment.  Instantly he thought of Little Eva and what she
had said of her experience as a stenographer, and her desire to abandon
her present life for something in the line of her former work. Here was
a chance to repay her in some measure for her kindness to him.
</p><p>"Yes," he said, "I do know of a young lady who, I believe, could do the
work. Shall I have her call on you?"
</p><p>"If you will, please," replied Compton
</p><p>As Jimmy left the office Compton rang for Bince, and when the latter
came, told him of his plan to employ a firm of accountants to renovate
their entire system of bookkeeping.
</p><p>"Is that one of Torrance's suggestions?" asked Bince.
</p><p>"Yes, the idea is his," replied Compton, "and I think it is a good one."
</p><p>"It seems to me," said Bince, "that Torrance is balling things up
sufficiently as it is without getting in other theorizers who have no
practical knowledge of our business. The result of all this will be to
greatly increase our overhead by saddling us with a lot of red-tape in
the accounting department similar to that which Torrance is loading the
producing end with."
</p><p>"I am afraid that you are prejudiced, Harold," said Compton.  "I cannot
discover that Torrance is doing anything to in any way complicate the
shop work. As a matter of fact a single change which he has just made
has resulted in our performing certain operations in less time and to
better advantage with five less men than formerly. Just in this one
thing he has not only more than earned his salary, but is really paying
dividends on our investment."
</p><p>Bince was silent for a moment.  He had walked to the window and was
looking out on the street below, then he turned suddenly toward Compton.
</p><p>"Mr. Compton," he said, "you have made me assistant general manager here
and now, just when I am reaching a point where I feel I can accomplish
something, you are practically taking the authority out of my hands and
putting it in that of a stranger. I feel not only that you are making a
grave mistake, but that it is casting a reflection on my work. It is
making a difference in the attitude of the men toward me that I am
afraid can never be overcome, and consequently while lessening my
authority it is also lessening my value to the plant. I am going to ask
you to drop this whole idea. As assistant general manager, I feel that
it is working injury to the organization, and I hope that before it is
too late--that, in fact, immediately, you will discharge Torrance and
drop this idea of getting outsiders to come in and install a new
accounting system."
</p><p>"You're altogether too sensitive, Harold," replied Compton. "It is no
reflection on you whatsoever. The system under which we have been
working is, with very few exceptions, the very system that I evolved
myself through years of experience in this business. If there is any
reflection upon any one it is upon me and not you. You must learn to
realize, if you do not already, what I realize--that no one is
infallible. Just because the system is mine or yours we must not think
that no better system can be devised. I am perfectly satisfied with what
Mr. Torrance is doing, and I agree with his suggestion that we employ a
firm of accountants, but I think no less of you or your ability on that
account."
</p><p>Bince saw that it was futile to argue the matter further.
</p><p>"Very well, sir," he said. "I hope that I am mistaken and that no
serious harm will result. When do you expect to start these accountants
in?"
</p><p>"Immediately," replied Compton.  "I shall get in touch with somebody
today."
</p><p>Bince shook his head dubiously as he returned to his own office.
