<p>On the 1st of May, 1774, the anchor-ice, which for so many months
had silver-plated the river's bed with frosted crusts, was ripped
off and dashed into a million gushing flakes by the amber outrush
of the springtide flood.</p>

<p>On that day I had laid my plans for fishing the warm shallows
where the small fry, swarming in early spring, attract the great
lean fish which have lain benumbed all winter under their crystal
roof of ice.</p>

<p>So certain was I of a holiday undisturbed by school-room tasks
that I whistled up boldly as I sat on my cot bed, sorting hooks
according to their sizes, and smoothing out my feather-flies to
make sure the moths had not loosened wing or body. It was, therefore,
with misgiving that I heard Peter and Esk go into the school-room,
stamping their feet to make what noise they were able, and dragging
their horn-books along the balustrade.</p>

<p>Now we had no tasks set us for three weeks, for our schoolmaster,
Mr. Yost, journeying with the post to visit his mother in Pennsylvania,
had been shot and scalped at Eastertide near Fort Pitt&mdash;probably
by some drunken Delaware.</p>

<p>My guardian, Sir William Johnson, who, as all know, was Commissioner
of Indian Affairs for the Crown, had but recently returned from
the upper castle with his secretary, Captain Walter Butler; and,
preoccupied with the lamentable murder of Mr. Yost, had found
no time to concern himself with us or our affairs.</p>

<p>However, having despatched a messenger with strings and belts
to remonstrate with the sachems of the Lenni-Lenape&mdash;they being,
as I have said, suspected of the murder&mdash;we discovered that Sir
William had also written to Albany for another schoolmaster to
replace Mr. Yost; and it gave me, for one, no pleasure to learn
it, though it did please Silver Heels, who wearied me with her
devotion to her books.</p>

<p>So, hearing Esk and fat Peter on their way to the school-room,
I took alarm, believing that our new schoolmaster had arrived;
so seized my fish-rod and started to slip out of the house before
any one might summon me. However, I was seen in the hallway by
Captain Butler, Sir William's secretary, and ordered to find my
books and report to him at the school-room.</p>

<p>I, of course, paid no heed to Mr. Butler, but walked defiantly
down-stairs, although he called me twice in his cold, menacing
voice. And I should have continued triumphantly out of the door
and across the fields to the river had not I met Silver Heels
dancing through the lower hallway, her slate and pencil under
her arm, and loudly sucking a cone of maple sugar.</p>

<p>"Oh, Michael," she cried, "you don't know! Captain Butler has
consented to instruct us until the new schoolmaster comes from
Albany."</p>

<p>"Oh, has he?" I sneered. "What do I care for Mr. Butler? I'm
going out! Let go my coat!"</p>

<p>"No, you're not! No, you're not!" retorted Silver Heels, in that
teasing sing-song which she loved to make me mad withal. "Sir
William says you are to take your ragged old book of gods and
nymphs and be diligent lest he catch you tripping! So there, clumsy
foot!"&mdash;for I had tried to trip her.</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" I answered, sulkily, snatching at her sugar.</p>

<p>"Aunt Molly; she set me to seek you. So now who's going fishing,
my lord?"</p>

<p>The indescribable malice of her smile, her sing-song mockery
as she stood there swaying from her hips and licking her sugar-cone,
roused all the sullen obstinacy in me.</p>

<p>"If I go," said I, "I won't study my books anyway. I'm too old
to study with you and Peter, and I won't! You will see!"</p>

<p>Sir William's favourite ferret, Vix, with muzzle on, came sneaking
along the wall, and I grasped the lithe animal and thrust it at
Silver Heels, whereupon she kicked my legs with her moccasins,
which did not hurt, and ran up-stairs like a wild-cat.</p>

<p>There was nothing for me but to go to the school-room. I laid
my rod in the corner, pocketed the ferret, dragged my books from
under the library table, and went slowly up the stairs.</p>

<p>At sixteen I was as wilful a dunce as ever dangled feet in a
school-room, knowing barely sufficient Latin to follow CÃ¦sar through
Gaul, loathing mathematics, scorning the poets, and even obstinately
marring my pen-writing with a heavy backward stroke in defiance
of Sir William and poor Mr. Yost.</p>

<p>As for mythology, my tow-head was over-crammed with kennel-lore
and the multitude of small details bearing upon fishing and the
chase, to accommodate the classics.</p>

<p>Destined, against my will, for Dartmouth College by my guardian,
who very well understood that I desired to be a soldier, I had
resolutely set myself against every school-room accomplishment,
with the result that, at sixteen, I presented an ignorance which
should have shamed a lad of ten, but did not mortify me in the
least.</p>

<p>And now, to my dismay and rage, Sir William had set me once more
in the school-room&mdash;and under Mr. Butler, too!</p>

<p>"Master Cardigan," said Mr. Butler when I entered the room, "Sir
William desires you to prepare a recitation upon the story of
Proserpine."</p>

<p>I muttered rebelliously, but jerked my mythology from the pile
of books and began to thumb the leaves noisily. Presently tiring
of dingy print, I moved up to the bench where sat the children,
Peter and Esk, a-conning their horn-books.</p>

<p>Silver Heels pulled a face at me behind her French grammar book,
and I pinched her arm smartly for her impudence. Then, casting
about for something to do, I remembered the ferret in my pocket,
and dragged it out. Removing the silver bit I permitted the ferret
to bite Peter's tight breeches, not meaning to hurt him; but Peter
screeched and Mr. Butler birched him well, knowing all the while
it was no fault of Peter's; yet such was the nature of the man
that, when angry, the innocent must suffer when the guilty were
beyond his wrath.</p>

<p>I had remuzzled the ferret, and Peter was smearing the tears
from his cheeks, when Sir William came in, very angry, saying
that Mistress Molly could hear us in the nursery, and that the
infant had fallen a-roaring with his new teeth.</p>

<p>"I did it, sir," said I, "and Mr. Butler punished Peter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" said Sir William, sharply. "Put that ferret out the
window!"</p>

<p>"The ferret is your best one &mdash;Vix," I answered. "She will
run to the warren and we shall have to dig her out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pocket her, then," said Sir William, hastily. "Who gave you
leave to pouch my ferrets? Eh? What has a ferret to do in school?
Eh? Idle again? Captain Butler, is he idle?"</p>

<p>"He is a dunce," said Mr. Butler, with a shrug.</p>

<p>"Dunce!" echoed Sir William, quickly. "Why should he be a dunce
when I have taught him? Granted his Latin would shame a French
priest, and his mathematics sicken a Mohawk, have I not read the
poets with him?"</p>

<p>Mr. Butler, a gentleman and an officer of rank and fortune, whose
degraded whims led him now to instruct youth as a pastime, sharpened
a quill in silence.</p>

<p>"Gad," muttered Sir William, "have I not read mythology with
him till I dreamed of nymphs and satyrs and capered in my dreams
till Mistress Molly&mdash;but that's neither here nor there. Micky!"</p>

<p>"Sir," I replied, sulkily.</p>

<p>Then he began to question me concerning certain gods and demi-gods,
and I gaped and floundered as though I were no better than the
inky rabble ruled over by Mr. Butler.</p>

<p>Sir William lounged by the window in his spurred boots and scarlet
hunting-coat, and smelling foul of the kennels, which, God knows,
I do not find unpleasant; and at every slap of the whip over his
boots, he shot me through and through with a question which I
had neither information nor inclination to answer before the grinning
small fry.</p>

<p>Now to be hectored and questioned by Sir William like a sniffling
lad with one eye on the birch and the other on Mr. Butler, did
not please me. Moreover, the others were looking on &mdash;Esk
with ink on his nose, Peter in tears, a-licking his lump of spruce,
and that wild-cat thing, Silver Heels&mdash;</p>

<p>With every question of Sir William I felt I was losing caste
among them. Besides, there was Mr. Butler with his silent, deathly
laugh&mdash;a laugh that never reached his eyes&mdash;yellow, changeless
eyes, round as a bird's.</p>

<p>Slap came the whip on the polished boot-tops, and Sir William
was at it again with his gods and goddesses:</p>

<p>"Who carried off Proserpine? Eh?"</p>

<p>I looked sullenly at Esk, then at Peter, who put out his tongue
at me. I had little knowledge of mythology beyond what concerned
that long-legged goddess who loved hunting&mdash;as I did.</p>

<p>"Who carried off Proserpine?" repeated Sir William. "Come now,
you should know that; come now&mdash;a likely lass, Proserpine, out
in the bush pulling cowslips, bless her little fingers&mdash;when&mdash;ho!&mdash;up
pops&mdash;eh?&mdash;who, lad, who in Heaven's name?"</p>

<p>"Plato!" I muttered at hazard.</p>

<p>"What!" bawled Sir William.</p>

<p>I felt for my underlip and got it between my teeth, and for a
space not another word would I speak, although that hollow roar
began to sound in Sir William's voice which always meant a scene.
His whip, too, went slap-slap! on his boots, like the tail of
a big dog rapping its ribs.</p>

<p>He was perhaps a violent man, Sir William, yet none outside of
his own family ever suspected it or do now believe it, he having
so perfect a control over himself when he chose. And I often think
that his outbursts towards us were all pretence, and to test his
own capacity for temper lest he had lost it in a long lifetime
of self-control. At all events, none of us ever were the worse
for his roaring, although it frightened us when very young; but
we soon came to understand that it was as harmless as summer thunder.</p>

<p>"Come, sir! Come, Mr. Cardigan!" said Sir William, grimly. "Out
with the gentleman's name&mdash;d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>It was the first time in my life that Sir William had spoken
to me as Mr. Cardigan. It might have pleased me had I not seen
Mr. Butler sneer.</p>

<p>I glared at Mr. Butler, whose face became shadowy and loose,
without expression, without life, save for the fixed stare of
those round eyes.</p>

<p>Slap! went Sir William's whip on his boots.</p>

<p>"Damme!" he shouted, in a passion, "who carried off that slut
Proserpine?"</p>

<p>"The Six Nations, for aught I know!" I muttered, disrespectfully.</p>

<p>Sir William's face went redder than his coat; but, as it was
ever his habit when affronted, he stood up very straight and still;
and that tribute of involuntary silence which was always paid
to him at such moments, we paid, sitting awed and quiet as mice.</p>

<p>"Turn the children free, Captain Butler," said Sir William, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Butler flung back the door. The children followed him, Esk
bestowing a wink upon me, Peter grinning and toeing in like a
Devon duck, and that wild-cat thing, Silver Heels&mdash;</p>

<p>"You need not wait, Captain Butler," said Sir William, politely.</p>

<p>Mr. Butler retired, leaving the door swinging. Out in the dark
hallway I fancied I could still see his shallow eyes shining.
I may have been mistaken. But all men know now that Walter Butler
hath eyes that see as well by dark as by the light of the sun;
and none know it so well as the people of New York Province and
of Tryon County.</p>

<p>"Michael," said Sir William, "go to the slate."</p>

<p>I walked across the dusty school-room.</p>

<p>"Chalk!" shouted Sir William, irritated by my lagging steps.</p>

<p>I picked up a lump of chalk, balancing it in my palm as boys
do a pebble in a sling.</p>

<p>Something in my eyes may have infuriated Sir William.</p>

<p>The next moment he had me by the arm, then by the collar, whip
whistling like the chimney wind&mdash;and whistling quite as idly,
for the blow never fell.</p>

<p>I freed myself; he made no effort to hold me.</p>

<p>"Keep your lash for your hounds!" I stammered.</p>

<p>He did not seem to hear me, but I planted myself in a corner
and cried out that he dare not lay his whip on me, which was a
shameful thing to taunt him with, for he had promised me never
to lay rod to me; and I knew, as all the world knows, that Sir
William Johnson had never broken his word to man or savage.</p>

<p>But still I faced him, now hurling safe defiance, now muttering
revenge, until the scornful rebuke in his eyes began to shame
me into silence. Tingling already with self-contempt, I dropped
my head a little, not so low but what I could see Sir William's
bulk motionless before me.</p>

<p>Presently he said, as though to himself: "If the boy's a coward,
no man can lay the sin to me."</p>

<p>"I am not a coward!" I burst out, all a-quiver again, "and I
ask your pardon, sir, for daring you to lay whip on me,&mdash;knowing
your promise!"</p>

<p>Sir William scowled at me.</p>

<p>"To prove it," I went on, desperately, still trembling at the
word "coward," "I will give you leave to drive a fish-hook through
my hand and cut it out with your knife; and I'll laugh at the
pain&mdash;as did that Mohawk lad when you cut the pike-hook out of
his hand!"</p>

<p>"What the devil have I to do with your fish-hook and your Mohawks!"
shouted Sir William, with a hearty oath.</p>

<p>Mortified, I shrank back while he fumed and cracked his whip
and swore I was doomed to folly and a most vicious future.</p>

<p>"You assume the airs of a man," he roared&mdash;"you with your sixteen
unbirched years&mdash;you with your gross ignorance and grosser impudence!
A vicious lad, a bad, undutiful, sullen lad, ever at odds with
the others, never diligent save with the fishing-rod&mdash;a lazy,
quarrelsome rustic, a swaggering, forest-running fellow, without
the polish or the presence of a gentleman's son! Shame on you!"</p>

<p>I set my teeth and shut both eyes, opening one, however, when
I heard him move.</p>

<p>"I'll polish you yet!" he said, with an oath; "I'll polish you,
and I'll temper you like the edge on a Mohawk hatchet."</p>

<p>"One red belt," I added, impudently, meaning that I defied him.</p>

<p>"Which you will cover with a white belt before the fires in this
hearth are dead," he answered, gulping down the disrespect.</p>

<p>He laid his heavy hand on the door, then, turning, he bade me
write with the chalk on the slate the history of Proserpine in
verse, and await his further pleasure.</p>

<p>Sir William had shut the school-room door upon me. I listened.
Had he locked it I should have kicked the panelling out into the
hallway.</p>

<p>Standing there alone in the school-room beside the great slate,
I read in dull anger the names of those who, tasks ended, were
now free of the hateful place; here Esk had left his name above
his sum, all smears; here fat Peter had written seven times, "David
did die and so must I."</p>

<p>With a bit of buckskin I dusted these scrawls from the slate,
slowly, for I was not yet of a mind to begin my task.</p>

<p>I opened the window behind me. A sweet spring wind was blowing.
Putting up my nose to scent it, I saw the sky bluer than a heron's
egg, and a little white cloud a-sailing up there all alone.</p>

<p>That year the snow had gone out in April, and the same day the
blue-birds flew into the sheep-fold. Now, on this second day of
May, robins were already running over the ground below the school-room
window, a-tilting for worms like jack-snipes along the creek.</p>

<p>Folding my arms to lean on the sill, I could see a corner of
the northern block-house, with a soldier standing guard below
in the sunshine, and I peppered him well with spit-balls, he being
a friend of mine.</p>

<p>His mystified anger brought but temporary pleasure to me. Behind
me lay that villanous slate, and my task to deal with the ravishment
of that silly creature, Proserpine&mdash;and that, too, in verse! Had
it been my long-legged Diana with her view-halloo and her hounds
and shooting her arrows like a Huron squaw from the lakes! But
no!&mdash;my business lay with a puny, cowslip-pulling maid who had
strayed from the stockade and got her deserts, too, for aught
I know.</p>

<p>Leaning there in the breezy casement I tried to forget the jade,
attentively observing the birds and the young fruit-trees, Sir
William's pride. Now that the snow had melted I could see where
mice, working under the crust in midwinter, had fatally girdled
two young apple-trees; and I was sorry, loving apples as I do.</p>

<p>For a while my mind was occupied in devising a remedy against
girdling; then the distant sparkle of the river caught my eye,
and straightway my thoughts slipped into their natural channel,
smoothly as the river flowed there in the sunshine; and I laid
my plans for the taking of that bull-trout who had so grossly
deceived and flouted me the past year&mdash;ay, not only me, but also
that master of the craft, Sir William himself.</p>

<p>Thinking of Sir William, my lagging thoughts drifted back again
to my desk. It madded me to pine here, making rhymes, while outside
the sweet wind whispered: "Come out, Michael&mdash;come out into the
green delight!"</p>

<p>Now Sir William had bidden me, not only to write my verses, but
also to bide here awaiting his good pleasure. That meant he would
return by-and-by. I had no stomach for further quarrels. Besides,
I was ashamed of my disrespect and temper, and indeed, selfish,
idle beast that I was, I did truly love Sir William because I
knew he was the greatest man of our times&mdash;and because he loved
me.</p>

<p>Resolved at last to accomplish some verses as proof of a contrite
and diligent spirit, I set to work; and this is what I made:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Proserpine did roam the hills,<br/>
Intent on culling daffydills;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, in gleeful girlish sport,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She wandered too far from the fort,<br/>
Forgetting that no belt of peace,<br/>
Bound the people of Pluto from war to cease;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, old Pluto lay in wait,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To ambush all who stayed out late;<br/>
And with a dreadful war-whoop he<br/>
Ran after the doomed Proserpine&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>Absorbed in my task, and, moreover, considerably affected by
the piteous plight of the maid, I stepped back from the slate
and for a moment conceived a generous idea of introducing somebody
to rescue Proserpine and leave Pluto damaged&mdash;perhaps scalped.
Reflection, however, dissuaded me from such a liberty, not that
I found the anachronism at all discordant, for, living all my
life in a family where Indians were oftener seen than white men,
my hazy notions concerning classic myths were inextricably mixed
with the reality of my own life, and were also gayly coloured
by the legends I learned from my red neighbours. So, lazy dunce
that I was, with but a fraction of my attention fixed on my tasks,
mythology to me was but a GrÃ¦co-Mohawk medley of jumbled fables,
interesting only when they concerned war or the chase.</p>

<p>Still I did not feel at liberty to rescue Proserpine in my verses
or plump a war-arrow into Pluto. Besides I knew it would enrage
Sir William.</p>

<p>As I stood there, breathing hard, resolved to finish the wretched
maiden quickly and let the metre go a-limping, behind me I heard
the door stealthily open, and I knew that long-legged wild-cat
thing, Silver Heels, had crept in, her moccasins making no noise.</p>

<p>I pretended not to notice her, knowing she had come to taunt
me; and, for a space, she stood behind me, very still. Clearly,
she was reading my verses, and I became angry. Not to show it,
I made out to whistle and to draw a picture of a fish on the slate.
Then she knew I had seen her and laughed hatefully.</p>

<p>"Oh," said I, "if there is somebody come a-prying, it must be
Silver Heels!" And I turned around, pretending amazement at the
justness of my hazard.</p>

<p>"You saw me," she answered, disdainfully.</p>

<p>"It is your hour for the stocks," I hinted.</p>

<p>"I won't go," she retorted.</p>

<p>To secure that grace of carriage and elegance of presence necessary
for a young lady of quality, and to straighten her back, which
truly was as straight as a pine, Sir William and Mistress Molly
were accustomed to strap her to a pine plank and lock her in the
stocks for an hour at noon, forbidding Peter, Esk, and me to tickle
the soles of her feet.</p>

<p>It was noon now; I could hear the guard changing at the north
block-house, tramp! tramp! tramp! across the stony way.</p>

<p>"If you don't go to the stocks now," I said, "you'll be sorry
when you do go."</p>

<p>"If you tickle my feet, you great booby, I'll tell Sir William,"
she retorted, balancing defiantly from one heel to the other.</p>

<p>"Will you go, Silver Heels?" I insisted.</p>

<p>"My name isn't Silver Heels," she observed, still coolly tilting
back and forth on heels and toes. "Call me by my right name and
perhaps I'll go&mdash;and perhaps I won't. So there, Mr. Micky Dunce!"</p>

<p>"If I call you Felicity Warren, will you go?" I inquired cautiously.</p>

<p>"There! you have called me Felicity Warren!" she cried in triumph.</p>

<p>"I didn't," said I, in a temper; "I only said that there was
such a person. But you are not that person! Anyway, you toe in
like a Mohawk. Anyway, you're half wild-cat, half Mohawk."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" she flashed; "I'm all white to the bones of my
body!"</p>

<p>It was true. Indeed, she was kin to Sir William and niece to
Sir Peter Warren, but, to torment her, we feigned to believe her
one of Mistress Molly's brood, half Mohawk; and it madded her.
Besides, had not the Mohawks dubbed her Silver Heels, a year ago,
when, with naked flying feet, she had beaten us all in the foot-race
before Sir William and half the people of the Six Nations?</p>

<p>The prize had been a Barlow jack-knife, which, before the race,
I had looked upon as mine. Besides, I had rashly given my old
knife to Esk, and that left me without a blade to notch whistles.</p>

<p>"You are a Mohawk," I said, resentfully; "also you are a cat-child
beneath notice. When you are hungry you cry, 'Miau! <em>Eso cautfore!</em>'&mdash;like
Peter."</p>

<p>"I don't!" she said, stamping her moccasin.</p>

<p>"Anyway," said I, disdaining to torment her further, "the guard
is changed these ten minutes, and Sir William will come to find
you here a-prying. <em>Esogee cadagcariax</em>," I added, incautiously.</p>

<p>"Who is Mohawk, now!" she cried, clapping her hands. "Bah, Mister
Micky, it is spoon-meat <em>you</em> require to make you run the
faster after jack-knives!"</p>

<p>This outrageous taunt ruffled me, the more for her laughter.
I attempted to hold my head in the air and look down at the presumptuous
child, but it appeared she had grown very fast in the past months
since the race, and I was disturbed to find her eyes already on
a straight line with mine, though she was but fifteen and I sixteen.</p>

<p>"I'm as high as you," she said.</p>

<p>"I can jump and touch the ceiling," said I; and did so.</p>

<p>She strove in vain, then called me dunce, and vowed what brains
I had were in my feet. For that, and because she pushed me, I
seized the chalk and wrote high on the slate:</p>

<p>"Silver Heels is Mohock she toes in like ducks."</p>

<p>She caught up the buckskin to wipe out the taunt, jostling me
till the ferret in my pocket jumped out and ran round and round
the room.</p>

<p>I jostled her; then she gave me a blow and a quick shove, whereupon
I stumbled, pulling her to the floor to rub her face with chalk.
She twisted and turned, kicking and striking while I rubbed chalk
into her skin, till of a sudden she coiled up and bit me clean
through the hand.</p>

<p>I was on my feet with a bound; she also, all white in the face
and her eyes aflame.</p>

<p>The blood began welling up, running into my palm and along the
fingers to the floor. At that same instant I heard the door of
the nursery open, and I knew that Sir William was coming through
the hall to the school-room.</p>

<p>From instinct I thrust my wounded hand into my breeches-pocket.</p>

<p>"Don't tell!" whispered Silver Heels, in a fright; "don't tell&mdash;and
here is the jack-knife."</p>

<p>She thrust it into my right hand, then sped across the floor
to the open window, and over the sill, dropping light as a cat
on the grass below.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to follow her and give her such a spank
as Mistress Molly administered the day she trounced her for pushing
Peter into the creek. However, it was already too late; Sir William
came quickly along the hall, and I had scarce time to step to
the slate when he marched in.</p>

<p>Sir William had changed his clothing for the buckskin hunting-shirt
and breeches which he was accustomed to wear when angling. He
carried, too, that light, seasoned rod, fashioned for him by Thayendanegea,
and on his bosom he wore a bouquet of gayly coloured feather-flies,
made by Mistress Molly during the winter.</p>

<p>He approached the slate whereon my verses stared white and unfinished;
and at first his brows knitted and he said, "Fudge, fudge, fudge!"
Then of a sudden he sat down on the bench, clapping his hand to
his brow.</p>

<p>"Oh Lord!" said he, and fell a-laughing, while I, hot, ashamed,
and a little dizzy, my breeches-pocket being full of blood, gnawed
my lips and glowered askance.</p>

<p>"The Lord's will be done," said he, taking breath. "Who am I
to ordain, when He who fashioned yon tow-head designed it to hold
neither Latin nor the classics?"</p>

<p>"It pleases you to laugh, sir," I muttered.</p>

<p>"Pleases me! Pleases me, quotha! Lad, it stabs me like a French
dirk, nor can I guard the thrust in tierce! I have been wrong.
A friar is not made with a twisted rope nor a man hanged with
words. If you are not born a scholar, 'twas the mint-mark I could
not read aright; and no blame to you, lad, no blame to you. Micky
boy! Shall we leave CÃ¦sar to go marching with his impedimenta
and his Tenth Legion? Shall we consign the hypothenuse of all
triangles to those who mend pens from the quills of wild-geese
which better men have brought down with a single ball?"</p>

<p>I was regarding him wildly, uncertain of his meaning.</p>

<p>"Shall we," cried Sir William, heartily, "bid the nymphs and
dryads farewell forever, lad, and save our learning for Roderick
Random and a bowl of cider and the bitter nights of December?"</p>

<p>His meaning was dawning upon me slowly, for what with the pain
of my hand and the dizziness, I was perhaps more stupid than usual.</p>

<p>"No," said Sir William, with a thump of his fist on his knee,
"the college which my Lord Dartmouth has endowed is a haven for
those who seek it, not a prison for men to be driven to."</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"I should have sought it," he said, dropping his head. "No wilderness,
no wintry terrors, neither French scalping parties nor the savages
of all the Canadas could have kept me from instruction had I,
in my youth, been favoured by the opportunity I offer you."</p>

<p>I gazed at him in silence while the blood, overrunning my leather
pocket, ran down to my knee-buckles.</p>

<p>"I was poor, without means, without counsel, save for the letters
Sir Peter Warren wrote me. I traded for my daily bread; I read
Ovid by lighted pine splinters; I worked &mdash;God knows I worked
my flesh to the bone."</p>

<p>He sat, fingering the bunch of scarlet feather-flies in his breast.</p>

<p>"Our Lord gives us according to our needs&mdash;<em>when we take it</em>,"
he said, without irreverence. "I could have gone to England, to
Oxford; I had saved enough. I did neither; I did not take the
instruction I wished for, and God did not teach me Greek in my
dreams," he added, bitterly.</p>

<p>The blood was now stealing down my stocking towards my shoe.
I turned the leg so he could not observe it.</p>

<p>"Come, lad," he said, brightening up; "learning lies not always
between thumbed leaves. I only wish that you bear yourself modestly
and nobly through the world; that you keep faith with men, that
your word once given shall never be withdrawn.</p>

<p>"This is the foundation. It includes courage. Further than that,
I desire you, once a purpose formed and a course set, to steer
fearlessly to the goal.</p>

<p>"I know you to be brave and honest; I know you to be a very Mohawk
in the forest; I believe you to be merciful and tender underneath
that boy's thoughtless and cruel hide.</p>

<p>"As for learning, I can do no more for you than I have done and
have offered to do. If it pleases you, you may go to England,
and learn the arts, bearing, and deportment you can never acquire
here with us. No? Well, then, stay with us. I want you, Micky.
We Irish are fond of each other&mdash;and I am an old man now &mdash;I
am nigh sixty years, Michael&mdash;sixty years of battle. I would be
glad of rest&mdash;with those I love."</p>

<p>My heart was very soft now. I looked at Sir William with an affection
I had never before understood.</p>

<p>"There is one last thing I wish to add," he said, gravely, almost
sadly. "Perhaps I may again refer to it&mdash;but I pray that it may
not be necessary."</p>

<p>I sat up and rubbed my eyes to clear them from the sickly faintness
which stole upward from my throbbing hand.</p>

<p>"It is this," he continued, in a low voice. "If it ever comes
to you to choose between his Majesty our King and&mdash;and your native
land&mdash;which God forbid!&mdash;go to your closet and kneel down, and
stay there on your knees, hours, days!&mdash;until you have learned
your own heart. Then&mdash;then &mdash;God go with you, Michael Cardigan."</p>

<p>He rose, and his face was years older. Slowly the colour came
back into his cheeks; he fumbled with the brass-work on his fish-rod,
then smiled.</p>

<p>"That is all," he said; "let Pluto chase Proserpine to hell,
lad; and a devilish good place they say it is for those who like
it! Where is that ferret? What! Running about unmuzzled! Hey!
Vix! Vix! Come here, little reptile!"</p>

<p>"I'll catch her, sir," said I, stumbling forward.</p>

<p>But as I laid my hand on Vix the floor rose and struck me, and
there I lay sprawling and senseless, with the blood running over
the floor; and Sir William, believing me bitten by the ferret,
pouched the poor beast and lifted me to a bench.</p>

<p>He must have seen my hand, however, for, when a cup of cold water
set me spluttering and blinking, I found my hand tied up in Sir
William's handkerchief and Sir William himself eying me strangely.</p>

<p>"How came that wound?" he said, bluntly.</p>

<p>I could not reply&mdash;or would not.</p>

<p>He asked me again whether the ferret bit me, and I was tempted
to say yes. Treachery was abhorrent to me; I hated Silver Heels,
but could not betray her, and it was easy to clap the blame on
Vix.</p>

<p>"Sir?" I stammered.</p>

<p>"I asked what bit you," he said, icily.</p>

<p>I tried to say Vix, but the lie, too, stuck in my throat.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," I muttered.</p>

<p>"Then," said Sir William, with a strange smile of relief, "I
shall not force you, Michael. May I honourably ask you how you
come by this jack-knife?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. My face was on fire.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "Only remember that you are a man, now&mdash;a
man of sixteen, and that I have to-day treated you as a man, and
shall continue. And remember that a man's first duty is to protect
the weaker sex, and his second duty is to endure from them all
taunts, caprice, and torments without revenge. It is a hard lesson
to learn, Micky, and only the true and gallant gentleman can ever
learn it."</p>

<p>He smiled, then said:</p>

<p>"Pray find our little Silver Heels and return to her the jack-knife,
which was her wampum-belt of faith in the honour of a gentleman."</p>

<p>And so he walked away, smoothing the fur of the red-eyed ferret
against his breast.</p>
