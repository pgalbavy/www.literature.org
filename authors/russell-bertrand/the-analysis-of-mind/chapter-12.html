<p>Belief, which is our subject to-day, is the central problem in
the analysis of mind. Believing seems the most "mental" thing
we do, the thing most remote from what is done by mere matter.
The whole intellectual life consists of beliefs, and of the passage
from one belief to another by what is called "reasoning." Beliefs
give knowledge and error; they are the vehicles of truth and falsehood.
Psychology, theory of knowledge and metaphysics revolve about
belief, and on the view we take of belief our philosophical outlook
largely depends.</p>

<p>Before embarking upon the detailed analysis of belief, we shall
do well to note certain requisites which any theory must fulfil.</p>

<p>(1) Just as words are characterized by meaning, so beliefs are
characterized by truth or falsehood. And just as meaning consists
in relation to the object meant, so truth and falsehood consist
in relation to something that lies outside the belief. You may
believe that such-and-such a horse will win the Derby. The time
comes, and your horse wins or does not win; according to the outcome,
your belief was true or false. You may believe that six times
nine is fifty-six; in this case also there is a fact which makes
your belief false. You may believe that America was discovered
in 1492, or that it was discovered in 1066. In the one case your
belief is true, in the other false; in either case its truth or
falsehood depends upon the actions of Columbus, not upon anything
present or under your control. What makes a belief true or false
I call a "fact." The particular fact that makes a given belief
true or false I call its "objective,"* and the relation of the
belief to its objective I call the "reference" or the "objective
reference" of the belief. Thus, if I believe that Columbus crossed
the Atlantic in 1492, the "objective" of my belief is Columbus's
actual voyage, and the "reference" of my belief is the relation
between my belief and the voyage&mdash;that relation, namely, in virtue
of which the voyage makes my belief true (or, in another case,
false). "Reference" of beliefs differs from "meaning" of words
in various ways, but especially in the fact that it is of two
kinds, "true" reference and "false" reference. The truth or falsehood
of a belief does not depend upon anything intrinsic to the belief,
but upon the nature of its relation to its objective. The intrinsic
nature of belief can be treated without reference to what makes
it true or false. In the remainder of the present lecture I shall
ignore truth and falsehood, which will be the subject of Lecture
<em>XIII. </em>It is the intrinsic nature of belief that will
concern us to-day.</p>

* This terminology is suggested by Meinong, but is not<br/>
exactly the same as his.

</p>
</div>
<p>(2) We must distinguish between believing and what is believed.
I may believe that Columbus crossed the Atlantic, that all Cretans
are liars, that two and two are four, or that nine times six is
fifty-six; in all these cases the believing is just the same,
and only the contents believed are different. I may remember my
breakfast this morning, my lecture last week, or my first sight
of New York. In all these cases the feeling of memory-belief is
just the same, and only what is remembered differs. Exactly similar
remarks apply to expectations. Bare assent, memory and expectation
are forms of belief; all three are different from what is believed,
and each has a constant character which is independent of what
is believed.</p>

<p>In Lecture I we criticized the analysis of a presentation into
act, content and object. But our analysis of belief contains three
very similar elements, namely the believing, what is believed
and the objective. The objections to the act (in the case of presentations)
are not valid against the believing in the case of beliefs, because
the believing is an actual experienced feeling, not something
postulated, like the act. But it is necessary first to complete
our preliminary requisites, and then to examine the content of
a belief. After that, we shall be in a position to return to the
question as to what constitutes believing.</p>

<p>(3) What is believed, and the believing, must both consist of
present occurrences in the believer, no matter what may be the
objective of the belief. Suppose I believe, for example, "that
Caesar crossed the Rubicon." The objective of my belief is an
event which happened long ago, which I never saw and do not remember.
This event itself is not in my mind when I believe that it happened.
It is not correct to say that I am believing the actual event;
what I am believing is something now in my mind, something related
to the event (in a way which we shall investigate in Lecture <em>XIII),
</em>but obviously not to be confounded with the event, since
the event is not occurring now but the believing is. What a man
is believing at a given moment is wholly determinate if we know
the contents of his mind at that moment; but Caesar's crossing
of the Rubicon was an historical physical event, which is distinct
from the present contents of every present mind. What is believed,
however true it may be, is not the actual fact that makes the
belief true, but a present event related to the fact. This present
event, which is what is believed, I shall call the "content" of
the belief. We have already had occasion to notice the distinction
between content and objective in the case of memory-beliefs, where
the content is "this occurred" and the objective is the past event.</p>

<p>(4) Between content and objective there is sometimes a very wide
gulf, for example in the case of "Caesar crossed the Rubicon."
This gulf may, when it is first perceived, give us a feeling that
we cannot really "know" anything about the outer world. All we
can "know," it may be said, is what is now in our thoughts. If
Caesar and the Rubicon cannot be bodily in our thoughts, it might
seem as though we must remain cut off from knowledge of them.
I shall not now deal at length with this feeling, since it is
necessary first to define "knowing," which cannot be done yet.
But I will say, as a preliminary answer, that the feeling assumes
an ideal of knowing which I believe to be quite mistaken. It assumes,
if it is thought out, something like the mystic unity of knower
and known. These two are often said to be combined into a unity
by the fact of cognition; hence when this unity is plainly absent,
it may seem as if there were no genuine cognition. For my part,
I think such theories and feelings wholly mistaken: I believe
knowing to be a very external and complicated relation, incapable
of exact definition, dependent upon causal laws, and involving
no more unity than there is between a signpost and the town to
which it points. I shall return to this question on a later occasion;
for the moment these provisional remarks must suffice.</p>

<p>(5) The objective reference of a belief is connected with the
fact that all or some of the constituents of its content have
meaning. If I say "Caesar conquered Gaul," a person who knows
the meaning of the three words composing my statement knows as
much as can be known about the nature of the objective which would
make my statement true. It is clear that the objective reference
of a belief is, in general, in some way derivative from the meanings
of the words or images that occur in its content. There are, however,
certain complications which must be borne in mind. In the first
place, it might be contended that a memory-image acquires meaning
only through the memory-belief, which would seem, at least in
the case of memory, to make belief more primitive than the meaning
of images. In the second place, it is a very singular thing that
meaning, which is single, should generate objective reference,
which is dual, namely true and false. This is one of the facts
which any theory of belief must explain if it is to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>It is now time to leave these preliminary requisites, and attempt
the analysis of the contents of beliefs.</p>

<p>The first thing to notice about what is believed, i.e. about
the content of a belief, is that it is always complex: We believe
that a certain thing has a certain property, or a certain relation
to something else, or that it occurred or will occur (in the sense
discussed at the end of Lecture IX); or we may believe that all
the members of a certain class have a certain property, or that
a certain property sometimes occurs among the members of a class;
or we may believe that if one thing happens, another will happen
(for example, "if it rains I shall bring my umbrella"), or we
may believe that something does not happen, or did not or will
not happen (for example, "it won't rain"); or that one of two
things must happen (for example, "either you withdraw your accusation,
or I shall bring a libel action"). The catalogue of the sorts
of things we may believe is infinite, but all of them are complex.</p>

<p>Language sometimes conceals the complexity of a belief. We say
that a person believes in God, and it might seem as if God formed
the whole content of the belief. But what is really believed is
that God exists, which is very far from being simple. Similarly,
when a person has a memory-image with a memory-belief, the belief
is "this occurred," in the sense explained in Lecture IX; and
"this occurred" is not simple. In like manner all cases where
the content of a belief seems simple at first sight will be found,
on examination, to confirm the view that the content is always
complex.</p>

<p>The content of a belief involves not merely a plurality of constituents,
but definite relations between them; it is not determinate when
its constituents alone are given. For example, "Plato preceded
Aristotle" and "Aristotle preceded Plato" are both contents which
may be believed, but, although they consist of exactly the same
constituents, they are different, and even incompatible.</p>

<p>The content of a belief may consist of words only, or of images
only, or of a mixture of the two, or of either or both together
with one or more sensations. It must contain at least one constituent
which is a word or an image, and it may or may not contain one
or more sensations as constituents. Some examples will make these
various possibilities clear.</p>

<p>We may take first recognition, in either of the forms "this is
of such-and-such a kind" or "this has occurred before." In either
case, present sensation is a constituent. For example, you hear
a noise, and you say to yourself "tram." Here the noise and the
word "tram" are both constituents of your belief; there is also
a relation between them, expressed by "is" in the proposition
"that is a tram." As soon as your act of recognition is completed
by the occurrence of the word "tram," your actions are affected:
you hurry if you want the tram, or cease to hurry if you want
a bus. In this case the content of your belief is a sensation
(the noise) and a word ("tram") related in a way which may be
called predication.</p>

<p>The same noise may bring into your mind the visual image of a
tram, instead of the word "tram." In this case your belief consists
of a sensation and an image suitable related. Beliefs of this
class are what are called "judgments of perception." As we saw
in Lecture <em>VIII, </em>the images associated with a sensation
often come with such spontaneity and force that the unsophisticated
do not distinguish them from the sensation; it is only the psychologist
or the skilled observer who is aware of the large mnemic element
that is added to sensation to make perception. It may be objected
that what is added consists merely of images without belief. This
is no doubt sometimes the case, but is certainly sometimes not
the case. That belief always occurs in perception as opposed to
sensation it is not necessary for us to maintain; it is enough
for our purposes to note that it sometimes occurs, and that when
it does, the content of our belief consists of a sensation and
an image suitably related.</p>

<p>In a <em>PURE </em>memory-belief only images occur. But a mixture
of words and images is very common in memory. You have an image
of the past occurrence, and you say to yourself: "Yes, that's
how it was." Here the image and the words together make up the
content of the belief. And when the remembering of an incident
has become a habit, it may be purely verbal, and the memory-belief
may consist of words alone.</p>

<p>The more complicated forms of belief tend to consist only of
words. Often images of various kinds accompany them, but they
are apt to be irrelevant, and to form no part of what is actually
believed. For example, in thinking of the Solar System, you are
likely to have vague images of pictures you have seen of the earth
surrounded by clouds, Saturn and his rings, the sun during an
eclipse, and so on; but none of these form part of your belief
that the planets revolve round the sun in elliptical orbits. The
only images that form an actual part of such beliefs are, as a
rule, images of words. And images of words, for the reasons considered
in Lecture <em>VIII, </em>cannot be distinguished with any certainty
from sensations, when, as is often, if not usually, the case,
they are kinaesthetic images of pronouncing the words.</p>

<p>It is impossible for a belief to consist of sensations alone,
except when, as in the case of words, the sensations have associations
which make them signs possessed of meaning. The reason is that
objective reference is of the essence of belief, and objective
reference is derived from meaning. When I speak of a belief consisting
partly of sensations and partly of words, I do not mean to deny
that the words, when they are not mere images, are sensational,
but that they occur as signs, not (so to speak) in their own right.
To revert to the noise of the tram, when you hear it and say "tram,"
the noise and the word are both sensations (if you actually pronounce
the word), but the noise is part of the fact which makes your
belief true, whereas the word is not part of this fact. It is
the <em>MEANING </em>of the word "tram," not the actual word,
that forms part of the fact which is the objective of your belief.
Thus the word occurs in the belief as a symbol, in virtue of its
meaning, whereas the noise enters into both the belief and its
objective. It is this that distinguishes the occurrence of words
as symbols from the occurrence of sensations in their own right:
the objective contains the sensations that occur in their own
right, but contains only the meanings of the words that occur
as symbols.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, we may ignore the cases in which
sensations in their own right form part of the content of a belief,
and confine ourselves to images and words. We may also omit the
cases in which both images and words occur in the content of a
belief. Thus we become confined to two cases: (a) when the content
consists wholly of images, (b) when it consists wholly of words.
The case of mixed images and words has no special importance,
and its omission will do no harm.</p>

<p>Let us take in illustration a case of memory. Suppose you are
thinking of some familiar room. You may call up an image of it,
and in your image the window may be to the left of the door. Without
any intrusion of words, you may believe in the correctness of
your image. You then have a belief, consisting wholly of images,
which becomes, when put into words, "the window is to the left
of the door." You may yourself use these words and proceed to
believe them. You thus pass from an image-content to the corresponding
word-content. The content is different in the two cases, but its
objective reference is the same. This shows the relation of image-beliefs
to word-beliefs in a very simple case. In more elaborate cases
the relation becomes much less simple.</p>

<p>It may be said that even in this very simple case the objective
reference of the word-content is not quite the same as that of
the image-content, that images have a wealth of concrete features
which are lost when words are substituted, that the window in
the image is not a mere window in the abstract, but a window of
a certain shape and size, not merely to the left of the door,
but a certain distance to the left, and so on. In reply, it may
be admitted at once that there is, as a rule, a certain amount
of truth in the objection. But two points may be urged to minimize
its force. First, images do not, as a rule, have that wealth of
concrete detail that would make it <em>IMPOSSIBLE </em>to express
them fully in words. They are vague and fragmentary: a finite
number of words, though perhaps a large number, would exhaust
at least their <em>SIGNIFICANT </em>features. For&mdash;and this is
our second point&mdash;images enter into the content of a belief through
the fact that they are capable of meaning, and their meaning does
not, as a rule, have as much complexity as they have: some of
their characteristics are usually devoid of meaning. Thus it may
well be possible to extract in words all that has meaning in an
image-content; in that case the word-content and the image-content
will have exactly the same objective reference.</p>

<p>The content of a belief, when expressed in words, is the same
thing (or very nearly the same thing) as what in logic is called
a "proposition." A proposition is a series of words (or sometimes
a single word) expressing the kind of thing that can be asserted
or denied. "That all men are mortal," "that Columbus discovered
America," "that Charles I died in his bed," "that all philosophers
are wise," are propositions. Not any series of words is a proposition,
but only such series of words as have "meaning," or, in our phraseology,
"objective reference." Given the meanings of separate words, and
the rules of syntax, the meaning of a proposition is determinate.
This is the reason why we can understand a sentence we never heard
before. You probably never heard before the proposition "that
the inhabitants of the Andaman Islands habitually eat stewed hippopotamus
for dinner," but there is no difficulty in understanding the proposition.
The question of the relation between the meaning of a sentence
and the meanings of the separate words is difficult, and I shall
not pursue it now; I brought it up solely as being illustrative
of the nature of propositions.</p>

<p>We may extend the term "proposition" so as to cover the image-contents
of beliefs consisting of images. Thus, in the case of remembering
a room in which the window is to the left of the door, when we
believe the image-content the proposition will consist of the
image of the window on the left together with the image of the
door on the right. We will distinguish propositions of this kind
as "image-propositions" and propositions in words as "word-propositions."
We may identify propositions in general with the contents of actual
and possible beliefs, and we may say that it is propositions that
are true or false. In logic we are concerned with propositions
rather than beliefs, since logic is not interested in what people
do in fact believe, but only in the conditions which determine
the truth or falsehood of possible beliefs. Whenever possible,
except when actual beliefs are in question, it is generally a
simplification to deal with propositions.</p>

<p>It would seem that image-propositions are more primitive than
word-propositions, and may well ante-date language. There is no
reason why memory-images, accompanied by that very simple belief-feeling
which we decided to be the essence of memory, should not have
occurred before language arose; indeed, it would be rash to assert
positively that memory of this sort does not occur among the higher
animals. Our more elementary beliefs, notably those that are added
to sensation to make perception, often remain at the level of
images. For example, most of the visual objects in our neighbourhood
rouse tactile images: we have a different feeling in looking at
a sofa from what we have in looking at a block of marble, and
the difference consists chiefly in different stimulation of our
tactile imagination. It may be said that the tactile images are
merely present, without any accompanying belief; but I think this
view, though sometimes correct, derives its plausibility as a
general proposition from our thinking of explicit conscious belief
only. Most of our beliefs, like most of our wishes, are "unconscious,"
in the sense that we have never told ourselves that we have them.
Such beliefs display themselves when the expectations that they
arouse fail in any way. For example, if someone puts tea (without
milk) into a glass, and you drink it under the impression that
it is going to be beer; or if you walk on what appears to be a
tiled floor, and it turns out to be a soft carpet made to look
like tiles. The shock of surprise on an occasion of this kind
makes us aware of the expectations that habitually enter into
our perceptions; and such expectations must be classed as beliefs,
in spite of the fact that we do not normally take note of them
or put them into words. I remember once watching a cock pigeon
running over and over again to the edge of a looking-glass to
try to wreak vengeance on the particularly obnoxious bird whom
he expected to find there, judging by what he saw in the glass.
He must have experienced each time the sort of surprise on finding
nothing, which is calculated to lead in time to the adoption of
Berkeley's theory that objects of sense are only in the mind.
His expectation, though not expressed in words, deserved, I think,
to be called a belief.</p>

<p>I come now to the question what constitutes believing, as opposed
to the content believed.</p>

<p>To begin with, there are various different attitudes that may
be taken towards the same content. Let us suppose, for the sake
of argument, that you have a visual image of your breakfast-table.
You may expect it while you are dressing in the morning; remember
it as you go to your work; feel doubt as to its correctness when
questioned as to your powers of visualizing; merely entertain
the image, without connecting it with anything external, when
you are going to sleep; desire it if you are hungry, or feel aversion
for it if you are ill. Suppose, for the sake of definiteness,
that the content is "an egg for breakfast." Then you have the
following attitudes "I expect there will be an egg for breakfast";
"I remember there was an egg for breakfast"; "Was there an egg
for breakfast?" "An egg for breakfast: well, what of it?" "I hope
there will be an egg for breakfast"; "I am afraid there will be
an egg for breakfast and it is sure to be bad." I do not suggest
that this is a list of all possible attitudes on the subject;
I say only that they are different attitudes, all concerned with
the one content "an egg for breakfast."</p>

<p>These attitudes are not all equally ultimate. Those that involve
desire and aversion have occupied us in Lecture <em>III. </em>For
the present, we are only concerned with such as are cognitive.
In speaking of memory, we distinguished three kinds of belief
directed towards the same content, namely memory, expectation
and bare assent without any time-determination in the belief-feeling.
But before developing this view, we must examine two other theories
which might be held concerning belief, and which, in some ways,
would be more in harmony with a behaviourist outlook than the
theory I wish to advocate.</p>

<p>(1) The first theory to be examined is the view that the differentia
of belief consists in its causal efficacy I do not wish to make
any author responsible for this theory: I wish merely to develop
it hypothetically so that we may judge of its tenability.</p>

<p>We defined the meaning of an image or word by causal efficacy,
namely by associations: an image or word acquires meaning, we
said, through having the same associations as what it means.</p>

<p>We propose hypothetically to define "belief" by a different kind
of causal efficacy, namely efficacy in causing voluntary movements.
(Voluntary movements are defined as those vital movements which
are distinguished from reflex movements as involving the higher
nervous centres. I do not like to distinguish them by means of
such notions as "consciousness" or "will," because I do not think
these notions, in any definable sense, are always applicable.
Moreover, the purpose of the theory we are examining is to be,
as far as possible, physiological and behaviourist, and this purpose
is not achieved if we introduce such a conception as "consciousness"
or "will." Nevertheless, it is necessary for our purpose to find
some way of distinguishing between voluntary and reflex movements,
since the results would be too paradoxical, if we were to say
that reflex movements also involve beliefs.) According to this
definition, a content is said to be "believed" when it causes
us to move. The images aroused are the same if you say to me,
"Suppose there were an escaped tiger coming along the street,"
and if you say to me, "There is an escaped tiger coming along
the street." But my actions will be very different in the two
cases: in the first, I shall remain calm; in the second, it is
possible that I may not. It is suggested, by the theory we are
considering, that this difference of effects constitutes what
is meant by saying that in the second case I believe the proposition
suggested, while in the first case I do not. According to this
view, images or words are "believed" when they cause bodily movements.</p>

<p>I do not think this theory is adequate, but I think it is suggestive
of truth, and not so easily refutable as it might appear to be
at first sight.</p>

<p>It might be objected to the theory that many things which we
certainly believe do not call for any bodily movements. I believe
that Great Britain is an island, that whales are mammals, that
Charles I was executed, and so on; and at first sight it seems
obvious that such beliefs, as a rule, do not call for any action
on my part. But when we investigate the matter more closely, it
becomes more doubtful. To begin with, we must distinguish belief
as a mere <em>DISPOSITION </em>from actual active belief. We speak
as if we always believed that Charles I was executed, but that
only means that we are always ready to believe it when the subject
comes up. The phenomenon we are concerned to analyse is the active
belief, not the permanent disposition. Now, what are the occasions
when, we actively believe that Charles I was executed? Primarily:
examinations, when we perform the bodily movement of writing it
down; conversation, when we assert it to display our historical
erudition; and political discourses, when we are engaged in showing
what Soviet government leads to. In all these cases bodily movements
(writing or speaking) result from our belief.</p>

<p>But there remains the belief which merely occurs in "thinking."
One may set to work to recall some piece of history one has been
reading, and what one recalls is believed, although it probably
does not cause any bodily movement whatever. It is true that what
we believe always <em>MAY </em>influence action. Suppose I am
invited to become King of Georgia: I find the prospect attractive,
and go to Cook's to buy a third-class ticket to my new realm.
At the last moment I remember Charles I and all the other monarchs
who have come to a bad end; I change my mind, and walk out without
completing the transaction. But such incidents are rare, and cannot
constitute the whole of my belief that Charles I was executed.
The conclusion seems to be that, although a belief always <em>MAY
</em>influence action if it becomes relevant to a practical issue,
it often exists actively (not as a mere disposition) without producing
any voluntary movement whatever. If this is true, we cannot define
belief by the effect on voluntary movements.</p>

<p>There is another, more theoretical, ground for rejecting the
view we are examining. It is clear that a proposition can be either
believed or merely considered, and that the content is the same
in both cases. We can expect an egg for breakfast, or merely entertain
the supposition that there may be an egg for breakfast. A moment
ago I considered the possibility of being invited to become King
of Georgia, but I do not believe that this will happen. Now, it
seems clear that, since believing and considering have different
effects if one produces bodily movements while the other does
not, there must be some intrinsic difference between believing
and considering*; for if they were precisely similar, their effects
also would be precisely similar. We have seen that the difference
between believing a given proposition and merely considering it
does not lie in the content; therefore there must be, in one case
or in both, something additional to the content which distinguishes
the occurrence of a belief from the occurrence of a mere consideration
of the same content. So far as the theoretical argument goes,
this additional element may exist only in belief, or only in consideration,
or there may be one sort of additional element in the case of
belief, and another in the case of consideration. This brings
us to the second view which we have to examine.</p>

p. 268 (criticizing Bain, "The Emotions and the Will").

</p>
</div>
<p>(1) The theory which we have now to consider regards belief as
belonging to every idea which is entertained, except in so far
as some positive counteracting force interferes. In this view
belief is not a positive phenomenon, though doubt and disbelief
are so. What we call belief, according to this hypothesis, involves
only the appropriate content, which will have the effects characteristic
of belief unless something else operating simultaneously inhibits
them. James (Psychology, vol. ii, p. 288) quotes with approval,
though inaccurately, a passage from Spinoza embodying this view:</p>

<p>"Let us conceive a boy imagining to himself a horse, and taking
note of nothing else. As this imagination involves the existence
of the horse, <em>AND THE BOY HAS NO PERCEPTION WHICH ANNULS ITS
EXISTENCE [</em>James's italics], he will necessarily contemplate
the horse as present, nor will he be able to doubt of its existence,
however little certain of it he may be. I deny that a man in so
far as he imagines [percipit] affirms nothing. For what is it
to imagine a winged horse but to affirm that the horse [that horse,
namely] has wings? For if the mind had nothing before it but the
winged horse, it would contemplate the same as present, would
have no cause to doubt of its existence, nor any power of dissenting
from its existence, unless the imagination of the winged horse
were joined to an idea which contradicted [tollit] its existence"
("Ethics," vol. ii, p. 49, Scholium).</p>

<p>To this doctrine James entirely assents, adding in italics:</p>

<p>"<em>ANY OBJECT WHICH REMAINS UNCONTRADICTED IS IPSO FACTO BELIEVED
AND POSITED AS ABSOLUTE REALITY</em>."</p>

<p>If this view is correct, it follows (though James does not draw
the inference) that there is no need of any specific feeling called
"belief," and that the mere existence of images yields all that
is required. The state of mind in which we merely consider a proposition,
without believing or disbelieving it, will then appear as a sophisticated
product, the result of some rival force adding to the image-proposition
a positive feeling which may be called suspense or non-belief&mdash;a
feeling which may be compared to that of a man about to run a
race waiting for the signal. Such a man, though not moving, is
in a very different condition from that of a man quietly at rest
And so the man who is considering a proposition without believing
it will be in a state of tension, restraining the natural tendency
to act upon the proposition which he would display if nothing
interfered. In this view belief primarily consists merely in the
existence of the appropriate images without any counteracting
forces.</p>

<p>There is a great deal to be said in favour of this view, and
I have some hesitation in regarding it as inadequate. It fits
admirably with the phenomena of dreams and hallucinatory images,
and it is recommended by the way in which it accords with mental
development. Doubt, suspense of judgment and disbelief all seem
later and more complex than a wholly unreflecting assent. Belief
as a positive phenomenon, if it exists, may be regarded, in this
view, as a product of doubt, a decision after debate, an acceptance,
not merely of <em>THIS, </em>but of <em>THIS-RATHER-THAN-THAT.
</em>It is not difficult to suppose that a dog has images (possible
olfactory) of his absent master, or of the rabbit that he dreams
of hunting. But it is very difficult to suppose that he can entertain
mere imagination-images to which no assent is given.</p>

<p>I think it must be conceded that a mere image, without the addition
of any positive feeling that could be called "belief," is apt
to have a certain dynamic power, and in this sense an uncombated
image has the force of a belief. But although this may be true,
it accounts only for some of the simplest phenomena in the region
of belief. It will not, for example, explain memory. Nor can it
explain beliefs which do not issue in any proximate action, such
as those of mathematics. I conclude, therefore, that there must
be belief-feelings of the same order as those of doubt or disbelief,
although phenomena closely analogous to those of belief can be
produced by mere uncontradicted images.</p>

<p>(3) I come now to the view of belief which I wish to advocate.
It seems to me that there are at least three kinds of belief,
namely memory, expectation and bare assent. Each of these I regard
as constituted by a certain feeling or complex of sensations,
attached to the content believed. We may illustrate by an example.
Suppose I am believing, by means of images, not words, that it
will rain. We have here two interrelated elements, namely the
content and the expectation. The content consists of images of
(say) the visual appearance of rain, the feeling of wetness, the
patter of drops, interrelated, roughly, as the sensations would
be if it were raining. Thus the content is a complex fact composed
of images. Exactly the same content may enter into the memory
"it was raining" or the assent "rain occurs." The difference of
these cases from each other and from expectation does not lie
in the content. The difference lies in the nature of the belief-feeling.
I, personally, do not profess to be able to analyse the sensations
constituting respectively memory, expectation and assent; but
I am not prepared to say that they cannot be analysed. There may
be other belief-feelings, for example in disjunction and implication;
also a disbelief-feeling.</p>

<p>It is not enough that the content and the belief-feeling should
coexist: it is necessary that there should be a specific relation
between them, of the sort expressed by saying that the content
is what is believed. If this were not obvious, it could be made
plain by an argument. If the mere co-existence of the content
and the belief-feeling sufficed, whenever we were having (say)
a memory-feeling we should be remembering any proposition which
came into our minds at the same time. But this is not the case,
since we may simultaneously remember one proposition and merely
consider another.</p>

<p>We may sum up our analysis, in the case of bare assent to a proposition
not expressed in words, as follows: (a) We have a proposition,
consisting of interrelated images, and possibly partly of sensations;
(b) we have the feeling of assent, which is presumably a complex
sensation demanding analysis; (c) we have a relation, actually
subsisting, between the assent and the proposition, such as is
expressed by saying that the proposition in question is what is
assented to. For other forms of belief-feeling or of content,
we have only to make the necessary substitutions in this analysis.</p>

<p>If we are right in our analysis of belief, the use of words in
expressing beliefs is apt to be misleading. There is no way of
distinguishing, in words, between a memory and an assent to a
proposition about the past: "I ate my breakfast" and "Caesar conquered
Gaul" have the same verbal form, though (assuming that I remember
my breakfast) they express occurrences which are psychologically
very different. In the one case, what happens is that I remember
the content "eating my breakfast"; in the other case, I assent
to the content "Caesar's conquest of Gaul occurred." In the latter
case, but not in the former, the pastness is part of the content
believed. Exactly similar remarks apply to the difference between
expectation, such as we have when waiting for the thunder after
a flash of lightning, and assent to a proposition about the future,
such as we have in all the usual cases of inferential knowledge
as to what will occur. I think this difficulty in the verbal expression
of the temporal aspects of beliefs is one among the causes which
have hampered philosophy in the consideration of time.</p>

<p>The view of belief which I have been advocating contains little
that is novel except the distinction of kinds of belief-feeling&mdash;such
as memory and expectation. Thus James says: "Everyone knows the
difference between imagining a thing and believing in its existence,
between supposing a proposition and acquiescing in its truth...IN
<em>ITS INNER NATURE, BELIEF, OR THE SENSE OF REALITY, IS A SORT
OF FEELING MORE ALLIED TO THE EMOTIONS THAN TO ANYTHING ELSE"
("</em>Psychology," vol. ii, p. 283. James's italics). He proceeds
to point out that drunkenness, and, still more, nitrous-oxide
intoxication, will heighten the sense of belief: in the latter
case, he says, a man's very soul may sweat with conviction, and
he be all the time utterly unable to say what he is convinced
of. It would seem that, in such cases, the feeling of belief exists
unattached, without its usual relation to a content believed,
just as the feeling of familiarity may sometimes occur without
being related to any definite familiar object. The feeling of
belief, when it occurs in this separated heightened form, generally
leads us to look for a content to which to attach it. Much of
what passes for revelation or mystic insight probably comes in
this way: the belief-feeling, in abnormal strength, attaches itself,
more or less accidentally, to some content which we happen to
think of at the appropriate moment. But this is only a speculation,
upon which I do not wish to lay too much stress.</p>
