<P>
THE narrative leaves Lady Janet and Horace Holmcroft together,
and returns to Julian and Mercy in the library.
<P>
An interval passed--a long interval, measured by the impatient
reckoning of suspense--after the cab which had taken Grace
Roseberry away had left the house. The minutes followed each
other; and still the warning sound of Horace's footsteps was not
heard on the marble pavement of the hall. By common (though
unexpressed) consent, Julian and Mercy avoided touching upon the
one subject on which they were now both interested alike. With
their thoughts fixed secretly in vain speculation on the nature
of the interview which was then taking place in Lady Janet's
room, they tried to speak on topics indifferent to both of
them--tried, and failed, and tried again. In a last and longest
pause of silence between them, the next event happened. The door
from the hall was softly and suddenly opened.
<P>
Was it Horace? No--not even yet. The person who had opened the
door was only Mercy's maid.
<P>
"My lady's love, miss; and will you please to read this
directly?"
<P>
Giving her message in those terms, the woman produced from the
pocket of her apron Lady Janet's second letter to Mercy, with a
strip of paper oddly pinned round the envelope. Mercy detached
the paper, and found on the inner side some lines in pencil,
hurriedly written in Lady Janet's hand. They ran thus.
<P>
"Don't lose a moment in reading my letter. And mind this, when H.
returns to you--meet him firmly: say nothing."
<P>
Enlightened by the warning words which Julian had spoken to her,
Mercy was at no loss to place the right interpretation on those
strange lines. Instead of immediately opening the letter, she
stopped the maid at the library door. Julian's suspicion of the
most trifling events that were taking place in the house had
found its way from his mind to hers. "Wait!" she said. "I don't
understand what is going on upstairs; I want to ask you
something."
<P>
The woman came back--not very willingly.
<P>
"How did you know I was here?" Mercy inquired.
<P>
"If you please, miss, her ladyship ordered me to take the letter
to you some little time since. You were not in your room, and I
left it on your table."
<P>
"I understand that. But how came you to bring the letter here?"
<P>
"My lady rang for me, miss. Before I could knock at her door she
came out into the corridor with that morsel of paper in her
hand--"
<P>
"So as to keep you from entering her room?"
<P>
"Yes, miss. Her ladyship wrote on the paper in a great hurry, and
told me to pin it round the letter that I had left in your room.
I was to take them both together to you, and to let nobody see
me. 'You will find Miss Roseberry in the library' (her ladyship
says), 'and run, run, run! there isn't a moment to lose!' Those
were her own words, miss."
<P>
"Did you hear anything in the room before Lady Janet came out and
met you?"
<P>
The woman hesitated, and looked at Julian.
<P>
"I hardly know whether I ought to tell you, miss."
<P>
Julian turned away to leave the library. Mercy stopped him by a
motion of her hand.
<P>
"You know that I shall not get you into any trouble," she said to
the maid. "And you may speak quite safely before Mr. Julian
Gray."
<P>
Thus re-assured, the maid spoke.
<P>
"To own the truth, miss, I heard Mr. Holmcroft in my lady's room.
His voice sounded as if he was angry. I may say they were both
angry--Mr. Holmcroft and my lady." (She turned to Julian.) "And
just before her ladyship came out, sir, I heard your name, as if
it was you they were having words about. I can't say exactly what
it was; I hadn't time to hear. And I didn't listen, miss; the
door was ajar; and the voices were so loud nobody could help
hearing them."
<P>
It was useless to detain the woman any longer. Having given her
leave to withdraw, Mercy turned to Julian.
<P>
"Why were they quarreling about you?" she asked.
<P>
Julian pointed to the unopened letter in her hand.
<P>
"The answer to your question may be there," he said. "Read the
letter while you have the chance. And if I can advise you, say so
at once."
<P>
With a strange reluctance she opened the envelope. With a sinking
heart she read the lines in which Lady Janet, as "mother and
friend," commanded her absolutely to suppress the confession
which she had pledged herself to make in the sacred interests of
justice and truth. A low cry of despair escaped her, as the cruel
complication in her position revealed itself in all its unmerited
hardship. "Oh, Lady Janet, Lady Janet!" she thought, "there was
but one trial more left in my hard lot--and it comes to me from
_you!_"
<P>
She handed the letter to Julian. He took it from her in silence.
His pale complexion turned paler still as he read it. His eyes
rested on her compassionately as he handed it back.
<P>
"To my mind," he said, "Lady Janet herself sets all further doubt
at rest. Her letter tells me what she wanted when she sent for
Horace, and why my name was mentioned between them."
<P>
"Tell me!" cried Mercy, eagerly.
<P>
He did not immediately answer her. He sat down again in the chair
by her side, and pointed to the letter.
<P>
"Has Lady Janet shaken your resolution?" he asked.
<P>
"She has strengthened my resolution," Mercy answered. "She has
added a new bitterness to my remorse."
<P>
She did not mean it harshly, but the reply sounded harshly in
Julian's ears. It stirred the generous impulses, which were the
strongest impulses in his nature. He who had once pleaded with
Mercy for compassionate consideration for herself now pleaded
with her for compassionate consideration for Lady Janet. With
persuasive gentleness he drew a little nearer, and laid his hand
on her arm.
<P>
"Don't judge her harshly," he said. "She is wrong, miserably
wrong. She has recklessly degraded herself; she has recklessly
tempted you. Still, is it generous--is it even just--to hold her
responsible for deliberate sin? She is at the close of her days;
she can feel no new affection; she can never replace you. View
her position in that light, and you will see (as I see) that it
is no base motive which has led her astray. Think of her wounded
heart and her wasted life--and say to yourself forgivingly, She
loves me!"
<P>
Mercy's eyes filled with tears.
<P>
"I do say it!" she answered. "Not forgivingly--it is _I_ who have
need of forgiveness. I say it gratefully when I think of her--I
say it with shame and sorrow when I think of myself."
<P>
He took her hand for the first time. He looked, guiltlessly
looked, at her downcast face. He spoke as he had spoken at the
memorable interview between them which had made a new woman of
her.
<P>
"I can imagine no crueler trial," he said, "than the trial that
is now before you. The benefactress to whom you owe everything
asks nothing from you but your silence. The person whom you have
wronged is no longer present to stimulate your resolution to
speak. Horace himself (unless I am entirely mistaken) will not
hold you to the explanation that you have promised. The
temptation to keep your false position in this house is, I do not
scruple to say, all but irresistible. Sister and friend! can you
still justify my fa ith in you? Will you still own the truth,
without the base fear of discovery to drive you to it?"
<P>
She lifted her head, with the steady light of resolution shining
again in her grand, gray eyes. Her low, sweet voice answered him,
without a faltering note in it,
<P>
"I will!"
<P>
"You will do justice to the woman whom you have wronged--unworthy
as she is; powerless as she is to expose you?"
<P>
"I will!"
<P>
"You will sacrifice everything you have gained by the fraud to
the sacred duty of atonement? You will suffer anything--even
though you offend the second mother who has loved you and sinned
for you-- rather than suffer the degradation of yourself?"
<P>
Her hand closed firmly on his. Again, and for the last time, she
answered,
<P>
"I will!"
<P>
His voice had not trembled yet. It failed him now. His next words
were spoken in faint whispering tones--to himself; not to her.
<P>
"Thank God for this day!" he said. "I have been of some service
to one of the noblest of God's creatures!"
<P>
Some subtle influence, as he spoke, passed from his hand to hers.
It trembled through her nerves; it entwined itself mysteriously
with the finest sensibilities in her nature; it softly opened her
heart to a first vague surmising of the devotion that she had
inspired in him. A faint glow of color, lovely in its faintness,
stole over her face and neck. Her breathing quickened tremblingly
. She drew her hand away from him, and sighed when she had
released it.
<P>
He rose suddenly to his feet and left her, without a word or a
look, walking slowly down the length of the room. When he turned
and came back to her, his face was composed; he was master of
himself again.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Mercy was the first to speak. She turned the conversation from
herself by reverting to the proceedings in Lady Janet's room.
<P>
"You spoke of Horace just now," she said, "in terms which
surprised me. You appeared to think that he would not hold me to
my explanation. Is that one of the conclusions which you draw
from Lady Janet's letter?"
<P>
"Most assuredly," Julian answered. "You will see the conclusion
as I see it if we return for a moment to Grace Roseberry's
departure from the house."
<P>
Mercy interrupted him there. "Can you guess," she asked, "how
Lady Janet prevailed upon her to go?"
<P>
"I hardly like to own it," said Julian. "There is an expression
in the letter which suggests to me that Lady Janet has offered
her money, and that she has taken the bribe."
<P>
"Oh, I can't think that!"
<P>
"Let us return to Horace. Miss Roseberry once out of the house,
but one serious obstacle is left in Lady Janet's way. That
obstacle is Horace Holmcroft."
<P>
"How is Horace an obstacle?"
<P>
"He is an obstacle in this sense. He is under an engagement to
marry you in a week's time; and Lady Janet is determined to keep
him (as she is determined to keep every one else) in ignorance of
the truth. She will do that without scruple. But the inbred sense
of honor in her is not utterly silenced yet. She cannot, she dare
not, let Horace make you his wife under the false impression that
you are Colonel Roseberry's daughter. You see the situation? On
the one hand, she won't enlighten him. On the other hand, she
cannot allow him to marry you blindfold. In this emergency what
is she to do? There is but one alternative that I can discover.
She must persuade Horace (or she must irritate Horace) into
acting for himself, and breaking off the engagement on his own
responsibility."
<P>
Mercy stopped him. "Impossible!" she cried, warmly. "Impossible!"
<P>
"Look again at her letter," Julian rejoined. "It tells, you
plainly that you need fear no embarrassment when you next meet
Horace. If words mean anything, those words mean that he will not
claim from you the confidence which you have promised to repose
in him. On what condition is it possible for him to abstain from
doing that? On the one condition that you have ceased to
represent the first and foremost interest of his life."
<P>
Mercy still held firm. "You are wronging Lady Janet, " she said .
<P>
Julian smiled sadly.
<P>
"Try to look at it," he answered, ''from Lady Janet's point of
view. Do you suppose _she_ sees anything derogatory to her in
attempting to break off the marriage? I will answer for it, she
believes she is doing you a kindness. In one sense it _would_ be
a kindness to spare you the shame of a humiliating confession,
and to save you (possibly) from being rejected to your face by
the man you love. In my opinion, the thing is done already. I
have reasons of my own for believing that my aunt will succeed
far more easily than she could anticipate. Horace's temper will
help her."
<P>
Mercy's mind began to yield to him, in spite of herself.
<P>
"What do you mean by Horace's temper?" she inquired.
<P>
"Must you ask me that?" he said, drawing back a little from her.
<P>
"I must."
<P>
"I mean by Horace's temper, Horace's unworthy distrust of the
interest that I feel in you."
<P>
She instantly understood him. And more than that, she secretly
admired him for the scrupulous delicacy with which he had
expressed himself. Another man would not have thought of sparing
her in that way. Another man would have said, plainly, "Horace is
jealous of me."
<P>
Julian did not wait for her to answer him. He considerately went
on.
<P>
"For the reason that I have just mentioned," he said, "Horace
will be easily irritated into taking a course which, in his
calmer moments, nothing would induce him to adopt. Until I heard
what your maid said to you I had thought (for your sake) of
retiring before he joined you here. Now I know that my name has
been introduced, and has made mischief upstairs, I feel the
necessity (for your sake again) of meeting Horace and his temper
face to face before you see him. Let me, if I can, prepare him to
hear you without any angry feeling in his mind toward you. Do you
object to retire to the next room for a few minutes in the event
of his coming back to the library?"
<P>
Mercy's courage instantly rose with the emergency. She refused to
leave the two men together.
<P>
"Don't think me insensible to your kindness," she said. "If I
leave you with Horace I may expose you to insult. I refuse to do
that. What makes you doubt his coming back?"
<P>
"His prolonged absence makes me doubt it," Julian replied. "In my
belief, the marriage is broken off. He may go as Grace Roseberry
has gone. You may never see him again."
<P>
The instant the opinion was uttered, it was practically
contradicted by the man himself. Horace opened the library door.
