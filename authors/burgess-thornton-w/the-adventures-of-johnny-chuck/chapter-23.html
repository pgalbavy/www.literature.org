Little Foxes, little Chucks,<br/>
Little Squirrels, Mice and Mink,<br/>
Just like little boys and girls,<br/>
Go to school to learn to think.

<p>You didn't know that, did you? Well, it's a fact. Yes, Sir, it's
a fact. All the babies born in the Green Forest or on the Green
Meadows or around the Smiling Pool have to go to school just as
soon as they are big enough to leave their own doorsteps. They
go to the greatest school in the world, and it is called the School
of Experience.</p>

<p>Old Mother Nature has charge of it, but the teachers usually
are father and mother for the first few weeks, anyway. After that
Old Mother Nature herself gives them a few lessons, and a very
stern teacher she is. They just <em>HAVE </em>to learn her lessons.
If they don't, something dreadful is almost sure to happen.</p>

<p>Of course Sammy Jay knew all this, because he had had to go to
school when he was a little fellow. So Sammy was not much surprised
when, from his snug hiding-place in one of the old apple-trees,
he discovered that there was a school in Farmer Brown's old orchard.
Johnny Chuck was the teacher and his three baby Chucks were the
pupils. Sammy Jay was so interested in that funny little school
in the old orchard that he quite forgot to think about mischief.</p>

<p>The very first lesson that the three little Chucks had to learn
was obedience. Johnny Chuck was very particular about that. You
see he knew that unless they learned this first of all, none of
the other lessons would do them much good. They must first learn
to mind instantly, without asking questions. Dear me, dear me,
Johnny Chuck certainly did have his hands full, teaching those
three little Chucks to mind! They were such lively little chaps,
and there was so much that was new and wonderful to see, that
it was dreadfully hard work to sit perfectly still, just because
Johnny Chuck told them to. But if they didn't mind instantly,
they were sure to have their ears soundly boxed, and sometimes
were sent back to the house without a taste of the sweet, tender,
young clover of which they were so fond.</p>

<p>After a few lessons of this kind, they found out that it was
always best to obey instantly, and then Johnny began to teach
them other things, things which it is very important that every
Chuck should know.</p>

<p>First, there were signals. When Johnny whistled a certain way,
it meant "A stranger in sight; possible danger!"</p>

<p>Then each little Chuck would sit up very straight and not move
the teeniest, weeniest bit, so that from a little distance they
looked for all the world like tiny stumps. But all the time their
sharp little eyes would be looking this way and that way, to see
what the danger might be. After a while Johnny would give another
little whistle, which meant "Danger past." Then they would once
more begin to fill their little stomachs with sweet, tender, young
clover.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, Johnny would whistle sharply. That meant
"Run!" Then they would scamper as fast as they could along the
nearest little path to the house under the old apple-tree in the
far corner, and never once look around. They would dive head first,
one after the other, in at the doorway, and not show their noses
outside again until Johnny or Polly Chuck told them they could.</p>

<p>Then there was a still different whistle. It meant "Danger very
near; lie low!" When they heard that, they flattened themselves
right down in the grass just wherever they happened to be, and
held their breath and didn't move until Johnny signaled that they
might. Of course, there never was any real danger. Johnny was
just teaching them, so that when danger did come, as it surely
would, sooner or later, they would know just what to do.</p>

<p>It surely was a funny little school, and sometimes Sammy Jay
had hard work to keep from laughing right out.</p>
