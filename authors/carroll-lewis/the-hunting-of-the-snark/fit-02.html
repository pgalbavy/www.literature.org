<p>
The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!<br/>
Such solemnity, too!  One could see he was wise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment one looked in his face!

</p>
<p>
He had bought a large map representing the sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the least vestige of land:<br/>
And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A map they could all understand.

</p>
<p>
"What’s the good of Mercator’s North Poles and Equators,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?"<br/>
&nbsp;So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are merely conventional signs!

</p>
<p>
"Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we’ve got our brave Captain to thank:"<br/>
&nbsp;(So the crew would protest) "that he’s bought us the best&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A perfect and absolute blank!"

</p>
<p>
This was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Captain they trusted so well<br/>
Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was to tingle his bell.

</p>
<p>
He was thoughtful and grave&mdash;but the orders he gave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were enough to bewilder a crew.<br/>
When he cried "Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What on earth was the helmsman to do?

</p>
<p>
Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing, as the Bellman remarked,<br/>
That frequently happens in tropical climes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a vessel is, so to speak, "snarked."

</p>
<p>
But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,<br/>
Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the ship would not travel due West!

</p>
<p>
But the danger was past&mdash;they had landed at last,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:<br/>
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which consisted of chasms and crags.

</p>
<p>
The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And repeated in musical tone<br/>
Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the crew would do nothing but groan.

</p>
<p>
He served out some grog with a liberal hand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade them sit down on the beach:<br/>
And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he stood and delivered his speech.

</p>
<p>
"Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(They were all of them fond of quotations:<br/>
So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he served out additional rations).

</p>
<p>
"We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Four weeks to the month you may mark),<br/>
But never as yet [‘tis your Captain who speaks)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!

</p>
<p>
"We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Seven days to the week I allow),<br/>
But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have never beheld till now!

</p>
<p>
"Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five unmistakable marks<br/>
By which you may know, wheresoever you go,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warranted genuine Snarks.

</p>
<p>
"Let us take them in order.  The first is the taste,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:<br/>
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a flavour of Will-o’-the-wisp.

</p>
<p>
"Its habit of getting up late you’ll agree<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it carries too far, when I say<br/>
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o’clock tea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dines on the following day.

</p>
<p>
"The third is its slowness in taking a jest.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should you happen to venture on one,<br/>
It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it always looks grave at a pun.

</p>
<p>
"The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is constantly carries about,<br/>
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sentiment open to doubt.

</p>
<p>
"The fifth is ambition.  It next will be right<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To describe each particular batch:<br/>
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those that have whiskers, and scratch.

</p>
<p>
"For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, I feel it my duty to say,<br/>
Some are Boojums&mdash;" The Bellman broke off in alarm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Baker had fainted away.<br/>
