<p>The Pah Utah was the only member of the party that did not manifest
any alarm or excitement. Carelessly removing his pipe from his
mouth, he turned his head, looked at the animals a moment, and
then resumed smoking, without giving utterance to a single sound
or changing his posture in the least.</p>

<p>Tim O'Rooney, with an ejaculated prayer, caught up his rifle,
and turning his back toward the fire, stood like a person driven
at bay and waiting to decide in his mind the best way to strike
his last blow. In his haste and alarm his pipe fell from his mouth
and lay unheeded at his feet. Shasta quietly picked it up, handed
it to him, and motioned for him to seat himself upon the ground
again. Tim stared alternately at the animals, the Indian and his
pipe, and finally gathered the idea that no imminent danger threatened
them.</p>

<p>Howard and Elwood also held their rifles ready for it charge
from the growling wolverines, for such they were, while the Newfoundland
growled in turn, and glared defiantly at them. The intelligent
brute appeared to comprehend that it would not do for him to sally
out and charge upon the enemy's works, but he stood ready to fight
and die in the defense of his friends.</p>

<p>"Why don't they attack us?" asked Elwood, seeing that they didn't
advance nearer than a dozen feet.</p>

<p>"Don't you know that wild animals are afraid of fire? That is
what restrains them."</p>

<p>"Of course! I didn't think of that. How fortunate that we gathered
enough wood to last!"</p>

<p>"Just look at Shasta! He doesn't even stop smoking!"</p>

<p>"He must know there is no danger."</p>

<p>"Let us try our guns upon them!"</p>

<p>The proposal pleased both, especially as there was no fear but
what they could make every discharge tell. Each of them singled
out two of the largest wolverines, and fired their guns at the
same instant. An ear-splitting clamor succeeded, and as the brutes
scampered away in the darkness two of their number were seen stretched
out, quivering and dying.</p>

<p>The wolverine is an animal found in California which unites the
characteristics of the bear, weasel, fox and wolf. It is sullen
and ferocious, and one of the most troublesome of the wood-denizens.
When first seen it is apt to be mistaken for a small bear, or
rather heavy-looking wolf. The sensuous neck and head bespeak
the wolf and weasel nature, the sly persistency the fox, and the
savage stubbornness that of the bear; while a resemblance to all
four can be seen in the general contour, appearance and habits
of the animal.</p>

<p>Attracted, no doubt, by the smell of the cooking fish, a number
of these brutes had slyly gathered and crept to the camp, where,
finding their prey protected by the fire, they proclaimed their
furious disappointment by loud howls&mdash;half bark and half yell&mdash;springing
hither and thither among each other, sometimes vaulting over each
other's backs, and darting as close to the bristling dog as their
mortal dread of the fire would permit.</p>

<p>Terror stood on the outskirts of the camp, occasionally moving
forward toward the animals, as if to match his long white teeth
and massive strength against their glittering fangs and treacherous
ferocity.</p>

<p>When the two guns were discharged the rest disappeared as if
a bombshell had exploded in their midst; but scarcely a dozed
seconds elapsed ere they closed together again, fiercer and more
clamorous, if possible, than before.</p>

<p>In a few moments the boys had their guns reloaded, and they immediately
repeated their former proceeding with precisely the same result.
At this point a surprising occurrence came to pass. The dead wolverines
were pounced upon by their survivors and torn instantly to shreds,
and even devoured with as much avidity as if they were Terror
and his human companions.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of such a thing?" asked Elwood, watching them
in great amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes; I have read of wolves doing the same, even when one of
their number was not killed but only wounded slightly."</p>

<p>"Any animals that act in that manner deserve death; so let's
send a few more rifle-balls among them."</p>

<p>"If we keep this up for a few hours I don't see that there will
be any left, and we may rest in peace."</p>

<p>"They will keep on gathering until there are twice that number.
If it wasn't for our fire we should have to take to the trees;
and what, then, would become of poor Terror?"</p>

<p>"He will get into trouble as it is," said Howard, "if we don't
keep an eye on him."</p>

<p>The dog had continued advancing closer to the wolverines, until
there was an imminent probability of a collision occurring between
him and two of the largest, that sprung forward until they were
within a few inches of him, when they darted back again to repeat
the feint, seemingly with the purpose of drawing the Newfoundland
further toward their clutches.</p>

<p>Howard spoke sharply to Terror, but he paid no heed to the call.
The boy repeated it with the same uselessness, and he was beginning
to become seriously alarmed for his fate when Shasta laid down
his pipe and rose to his feet. The eyes of the three were now
centered upon him.</p>

<p>The Pah Utah left his gun and blanket upon the ground, so that
his arms and breast, excepting a few ornaments, were bare. He
then drew his keen hunting-knife and held it rigidly grasped in
his right hand. Stooping down, he caught a blazing brand with
his left, swung it rapidly over his head a few times to give it
additional blaze, and then darted away like a meteor directly
among the wolverines. The latter scattered in greater terror than
ever, but the Indian, instead of returning, actually followed
them.</p>

<p>The brand could only be seen flitting among the trees, its flaming
glare giving a wild, unearthly appearance to the face and breast
of the Savage as he sped swiftly in and out among the trunks and
vegetation, like an avenger bent on destroying the entire band.</p>

<p>One of the largest wolverines, in his wild fear, sprung so close
to Elwood that his tail whisked against him. Ere he could clear
himself the Indian burst upon him, his iron arm flashed out with
lightning-like swiftness, the wire-like fingers caught the brute
by the neck, and the knife was buried so deep in his throat that
when he was thrown back he fell limp and dead to the ground. After
which Shasta sat down upon the ground again, folded his blanket
over his shoulders and appeared much occupied in contemplating
the burning sticks before him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Shasta, that was well done!" exclaimed Tim in admiration.
"I very much doubt whether it could be excelled by your humble
servant, the undersigned."</p>

<p>"I very much doubt it also," said Elwood. "I shouldn't fancy
chasing those animals with a firebrand."</p>

<p>"No; if you should drop it or fall down unpleasant consequences
might follow."</p>

<p>The boys kept up their loading and firing among the wolverines
until they had slain over a dozen. But instead of diminishing,
the number continued to increase till there must have been nearly
two-score growling, snapping and snarling around the camp-fire.</p>
