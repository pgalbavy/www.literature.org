<p>The two young men slept soundly through the night. When Leslie
awoke it was broad day, and his companion was still asleep. He
suffered him to remain so until the day was well advanced. Then
each felt the pangs of hunger. Leland proposed that one should
land and go in quest of food, but Leslie answered:</p>

<p>"If Kent appears, it will be in the course of a few hours. We
had better wait and see what comes of patience."</p>

<p>Another hour of silence wore away. Leland was about to speak
when Leslie exclaimed, in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Hush!"</p>

<p>They listened intently. In a moment the steady measured dip of
paddles could be heard. Whoever was approaching had little fear
or apprehension of danger; for they came fearlessly along, and
were moving with considerable noise and swiftness.</p>

<p>Leland and Leslie held their breath as the sound came steadily
nearer. Not a whisper was exchanged. The former, from his position,
could not discern any object that might be passing, but the latter
had a full view of the river.</p>

<p>In a moment the whole force passed before Leslie's eyes. Two
canoes loaded with Indians glided past, unconscious of their proximity.
Each drew a long breath of relief; but for a considerable time
neither ventured a whisper.</p>

<p>"It appears to me that Indians are plenty in these parts," remarked
Leland.</p>

<p>"Rather more than I could wish," returned his companion.</p>

<p>"Confound it, it will soon be time to fire your gun, and of course
the savages will hear it."</p>

<p>"But for all that I shall risk it. It will not do to let Kent
escape us."</p>

<p>"How soon do you intend discharging your piece?"</p>

<p>"In an hour or so."</p>

<p>"Well, see here, Roland, if Kent comes, it can not be expected
that he will have any food. The report of your gun will doubtless
reach the ears of enemies as well as friends."</p>

<p>"I expect it will."</p>

<p>"And still further: if such be the case, we shall not dare to
land for fear of an encounter. We may be obliged to remain concealed
for a few days, and no means will be left to procure food during
that time. Now, what I am coming at is this: while we have an
opportunity to get it, let us do it."</p>

<p>"How do you propose obtaining it?"</p>

<p>"Easily enough. Just let me land, and I will insure you success
in a short time."</p>

<p>"But you have overlooked one thing."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"The report of your gun will be heard as well as mine, and will
be as likely to attract the attention of any enemies in the neighborhood."</p>

<p>"That is true, but I can reach the boat in time."</p>

<p>"And although Kent is within a short distance, I shall not dare
to apprise him of our situation."</p>

<p>"Such appears to be the case; but you must see that it is absolutely
necessary that <em>some</em> means should be taken to secure food."</p>

<p>"I admit it, and am willing that you should try."</p>

<p>"Hold!" exclaimed Leland, brightening up. "I have a plan. You
say that Kent, in the course of an hour or so, will probably be
near enough for you to fire. I will try and not bring down any
game until that time, and the minute you hear the report of my
gun you must discharge yours. This will have the effect that you
wish, and I shall have time to reach you before any one can come
up."</p>

<p>"A capital idea," said Leslie. "Hearing two guns, the Indians
will have a little more fear in approaching us, than they would
did they hear but one. You deserve credit, George, for the thought."</p>

<p>"Remember, and wait until you hear my gun, before you fire yours,"
replied he.</p>

<p>"I will wait an hour, George; and then, whether I hear yours
or not, I shall discharge mine. As I said a while ago, it won't
do to let Kent escape us, and I must be sure to warn him."</p>

<p>"I trust that I shall encounter game before that time; but should
I not, you must do as you said. I will return upon hearing you."</p>

<p>"And return instantly," said Leslie, impressively. "Don't wait
until the danger is increased. Although it may seem that a few
minutes will enable you to procure abundant food, don't wait a
single minute. It may cost you your life, if you do."</p>

<p>"I will remember your advice. Now shove in a little nearer shore
and I will be off."</p>

<p>Leslie brought the boat to the bank, and Leland stepped off.</p>

<p>"Try and not be gone long; do not wander too far, for it will
be an easy thing to get lost in this forest. Remember that it
will take you considerable time to reach me, and if the distance
be too great, an enemy may be ahead of you. Be careful in all
your movements, and be sure to return the instant that my gun
is heard."</p>

<p>"I will try and obey you," returned Leland. And George disappeared
in the mazes of the woods.</p>

<p>Leslie returned to his former position, and more to occupy his
mind than anything else, gazed out upon the broad bosom of the
Ohio, as it glided majestically along, through the dark shadows
of the forest. It then presented a far different appearance from
what it does at this day. No crowded cities then lined its banks.
The flaming steamboat had not broken its surface; the canoe, gliding
noiselessly over it, was all that gave token of the presence of
man. A rude cabin erected in some lone spot in the wilderness,
like a green spot in the desert, showed the feeble footing which
he had upon the soil.</p>

<p>Solemnly and silently the old Ohio rolled along through its hundreds
of miles until it as solemnly and silently united with the great
father of waters.</p>

<p>When one has recently passed through an exciting and momentous
occurrence, and is then left completely alone, it is difficult
to keep from falling into a reverie; the subject which interests
the mind most will finally occupy it to the exclusion of everything
else.</p>

<p>Thus it was with Roland Leslie. At first he began speculating
upon the probable success of Leland's enterprise; then upon the
probability of his arresting the attention of Kent, should he
chance to be in the vicinity. Having considered this for some
time, he reflected upon the dangers through which he had passed,
and upon the likelihood of further deliverance from them. This
thought called to mind his mishap among the rocks, and he proceeded
to examine his wounds, of which, for some time, he had entirely
ceased to think. These being not very severe, as we have shown,
had failed to trouble him, and he was glad to see that they needed
no more attention.</p>

<p>Again left to his thoughts, they shortly wandered to Rosalind
Leland. Where was she? Was she alive, or already slain? Was there
any hope of meeting her again? Could <em>he</em> do anything toward
rescuing her from bondage? He felt certain that she was alive,
although a close prisoner, and was confident that recovery was
possible. That he determined she <em>should be</em> rescued, and
that he should be the one that would do it, was not strange.</p>

<p>Love will upset the mind of any person, and at times play the
<em>wild</em> with him. Leslie was naturally clear-headed, far-sighted
and sagacious; yet, when he permitted his ideas to dwell upon
the object of his love, they sadly misused him. At such times
he was another person. He lost sight of the obstacles and dangers
which would have been apparent to any one gifted with ordinary
shrewdness; and he formed plans which, in his sober moments, would
have only excited his ridicule.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem for such a person to have been guilty
of such an idea, Leslie had not pondered upon the absorbing topic
for any length of time before he deliberately came to the conclusion
to rescue Rosalind in the course of three days, to rebuild her
old home, and settle down with her for the rest of his life! Of
course the savages would never disturb him, and he should be,
without doubt, the happiest mortal in existence!</p>

<p>He was suddenly awakened from his reverie by the faint report
of Leland's rifle. It sounded fully a mile distant, and the certainty
of his danger made him tremble with apprehension. George, as he
feared, had forgotten the warning given him, and, in the excitement,
had unconsciously wandered to a greater distance than he supposed.
In all probability he was lost, and would be obliged to seek the
river and follow it in order to find Leslie. This would require
time, and he had already exposed himself to danger by firing his
gun.</p>

<p>Although Roland had promised to fire upon hearing Leland, yet
he forebore to do it. The difference which a half-hour would make
in the probability of Kent's hearing his own gun, would be in
his favor. He supposed that Leland, upon discharging his piece,
had instantly set out to return, and he wished to give him almost
sufficient time to reach him.</p>

<p>Anxiously and painfully Roland listened, with his finger upon
the trigger of his gun; and, as minute after minute wore away
without a sound reaching him, he began to hope that Leland could
be at no great distance.</p>

<p>A few more minutes were passed, when Roland concluded that the
time for firing his signal had arrived. It would serve to guide
Leland, and, had he not deceived himself, would reach the ears
of Kent. Standing up in the boat, he raised the gun above his
head, and was already pressing the trigger, when he paused, as
he heard the sharp crack of Leland's rifle at no great distance.
He waited a few seconds, until the echo had died away, and then
discharged his own.</p>

<p>He remained stationary a moment, as though to permit the sound
to escape entirely from his rifle. Then, reseating himself, proceeded
to reload it. This done, he impatiently listened for a returning
signal. He had placed a great deal of reliance and hope upon that
shot, and, as he now was so soon to learn whether it had accomplished
what he wished, he could not keep down his fearful anxiety.</p>

<p>He was nervous, and listened with painful interest for the slightest
sound. The falling of a leaf startled him; and, at last, unable
to restrain himself, he determined again to fire his gun.</p>

<p>At that instant there came a crash of Leland's rifle, followed
by the maddened shouts of infuriated savages, so near that Leslie
sprung to his feet and gazed about him. Recovering himself, he
stooped, and, seizing a paddle, began shoving the boat toward
shore, fully determined to afford his friend all the assistance
that lay in his power.</p>

<p>The boat had hardly touched, when there was a rustling in the
bushes directly before him, and the next instant Kent stood beside
him.</p>

<p>"Quick&mdash;shove out! They are after me!" he exclaimed, springing
into the boat and grasping the oars.</p>

<p>"Where is George?" asked Leslie.</p>

<p>"They've got him, and came nigh getting me. Cuss the infernal
devils!"</p>

<p>In a moment the two had freed themselves from the bushes. As
the yells of their enemies were heard upon the shore, they had
reached the center of the stream, and were passing swiftly downward.</p>
