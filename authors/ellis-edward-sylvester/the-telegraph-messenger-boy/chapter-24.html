<p>"You say you have something to speak about," added the boy, looking
into the enchanting face, as it reflected the light from the windows
near at hand; "I have only to suggest that it took you a good
time to find it out."</p>

<p>"It is not I, but you who are to blame."</p>

<p>"Possibly I am to be blamed for being born poor while you are
rich; but I have paid for my mistake, and it is now too late to
correct it."</p>

<p>The conversation had reached this point when the two seemed to
conclude it was altogether too public to be in good taste. Several
persons, standing near, stepped a little closer, so as to catch
every word.</p>

<p>"It is so warm in there," said Dolly; "even with the windows
open, that I came outdoors to get the fresh air. Aunt Maggie put
my shawl about my shoulders so that I wouldn't take cold. Now,
Ben, if you will walk with me to the summer-house yonder, we can
sit down by ourselves, finish our talk, and then part forever."</p>

<p>The last expression sent a pang to the boy's heart, but he did
not allow her to see it. He followed her a short distance to one
of the romantic little lattice-work structures which Mr. Grandin
had placed on his grounds.</p>

<p>A few rays of silvery moonlight penetrated the leafy shelter,
so the two were not in complete darkness when they sat down on
the rustic seat.</p>

<p>"I am ready to listen to you," said Ben in his most frigid voice,
the two being separated by a space of several feet.</p>

<p>"In the first place, if you thought so lightly of me, you never
should have told me different nor asked me to correspond with
you."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you."</p>

<p>"How can you help understanding me?"</p>

<p>"Because I see no reason for your words. I thought all the world
of you; the greatest pleasure of my life was to write to you and
to receive your letters in return. All at once you stopped writing;
I sent you three letters, and you paid no attention&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Ben, how dare you! It was you who laughed at my letters, and
took no notice of them, except to show them to your friends and
ridicule what I put on paper."</p>

<p>Ben Mayberry sprang to his feet. Like a flash it came upon him
that some dreadful misunderstanding had been brought about by
other parties, for which Dolly was not to blame.</p>

<p>"Tell me the whole story, Dolly," he said in a kinder voice than
he had used since they met, as he resumed his seat.</p>

<p>"Well," said she, beginning to feel the same suspicion that thrilled
her companion, "there is a good deal to say, but I will make it
short. You know my father and Mr. Grandin are cousins, so the
girls are really my second cousins. Rutherford Richmond is the
son of an old friend of father, who lives in Boston. Father has
a large insurance office, and he agreed to take Rutherford until
he learned the business, so as to take charge of the same kind
of office in Boston, which his father is going to fix up for him.
That's how it is Rutherford has been living with us for some months.</p>

<p>"Well, a good while ago, I wrote you a letter, begging you to
come and visit me; father said I might do so. You didn't accept
the invitation. I wrote you again and got no answer to it; I was
frightened, and thought maybe you were ill, and wrote once more,
but there was no answer to it. I would have sent a letter to Cousin
Jane to find out about you, but she was in Europe. After a while
I sent a fourth letter, very long, and full of things which I
wouldn't have anyone else know for the world. I sent&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Who by?"</p>

<p>"Rutherford took it and several other letters, and placed them
in the mail-box at father's office, so they were sure to go. But
there was no answer to the last, and then I gave up. I felt awful
bad; but I was nearly wild when Rutherford came to me one day
and said he had something which he thought he ought to tell me.
When he said it was about you, I was dreadfully excited. He told
me that he had made the acquaintance of a young man from Damietta,
who was a close friend of yours. That young person, whose name
Rutherford would not give, said that you showed all my letters
to him and several others, and made fun of them. I wouldn't have
believed it if he hadn't proved what he said?"</p>

<p>"How did he prove it?"</p>

<p>"By repeating what I had written; he gave me half of what was
in that last letter, which he said was repeated to him by the
person you told. He had them so exactly that my face burned like
fire, and I was never so angry in all my life. I knew you must
have done what Rutherford said, for how could he know what I had
written you?"</p>

<p>"He knew it by opening your letter, reading the contents, and
then destroying it. That letter, Dolly, I never saw, nor did I
see the three which preceded it. I also sent you three letters,
of which I never heard."</p>

<p>Now that the way was opened, full explanations quickly followed.
There could be no earthly doubt that the last three letters sent
by Ben Mayberry to Dolly Willard had been intercepted by Rutherford
Richmond, who had not hesitated to do the same with those sent
by Dolly, though most probably he had simply destroyed the three,
and read only the last.</p>

<p>"You risked your life to save mine and that of my mother," she
said in a tremulous voice, "and it was an awful thing for you
to believe I could ever fail to think more of you than of anyone
else in the world."</p>

<p>"I guess I shall have to own up," laughed the happy Ben; "but
we were both placed in a false position."</p>

<p>"But we shall never be again&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Dolly, Dolly! Where are you?"</p>

<p>The cries came from a gay party of misses who came trooping forth
to look for the belle, whose absence so long from her friends
had attracted inquiry.</p>

<p>She sprang up.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Ben; I must go."</p>

<p>She caught his hand and returned the pressure, then hurried out
and met her young friends, who escorted her back to the house,
while Ben quietly departed without attracting attention.</p>

<p>It was past midnight, but Ben thought nothing of time. He had
turned off from the street and entered the main business avenue
of Damietta.</p>

<p>Just as he came opposite the large jewelry establishment of Mr.
Grandin he glanced through the plate-glass window. A light was
burning dimly in the rear of the store, as was the custom with
many of the merchants in the city, but at the instant of looking
Ben saw something like a shadow flit by the light. He looked again,
and was certain that another movement had taken place, though
he could not define its character.</p>

<p>He paused only an instant, when he walked on again; but in that
instant he became convinced that burglars were operating in the
jewelry establishment of Mr. Grandin.</p>

<p>He walked slowly forward, humming to himself, as was his custom,
but wide awake and alert. Fifty feet further, he detected the
shadowy figure of a man standing in one of the adjoining doorways.
Ben pretended not to see him, and continued humming gayly to himself.</p>

<p>Ben sauntered along in the same aimless fashion until sure he
was not watched, when he turned and made his way directly to the
police office. The chief was there and Ben quickly told him everything
he knew.</p>

<p>"Those are the parties who arranged to rob the bank year before
last," said the chief, "but found out they were suspected."</p>

<p>"They certainly managed it well this time; that is, so far, for
there hasn't a single cipher telegram passed through our office
since."</p>

<p>"Well, we are ready to move," said the chief, as he observed
that four of his best officers were awaiting his orders.</p>
