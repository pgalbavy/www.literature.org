<p>Athalie ventured to send some Madonna lilies with no card attached;
but even the thought of her white flowers crossing the threshold
of Clive's world&mdash;although it was because of her devotion to him
alone that she dared salute his dead&mdash;left her sensitively concerned,
wondering whether it had been a proper thing for her to do.</p>

<p>However, the day following she wrote him.</p>

<p>   "<em>CLIVE DEAR</em>,</p>

<p>   "I do not mean to intrude on your grief at such a time. This   
is merely a line to say that you are never absent from my    mind.</p>

<p>   "And Clive, nothing really dies. This is quite true. I am
not    speaking of what faith teaches us. Faith is faith. But
those    who 'see clearly' <em>know</em>. Nothing dies, Clive.
<em>Nothing.</em>    That is even more than faith teaches us.
Yet it, also, is    true.</p>

<p>   "Dear little boy of my childhood, dear lad of my girlhood,   
and, of my womanhood, dearest of men, I pray that God will   
comfort you and yours.</p>

<p>   "I was twelve years old the only time I ever saw your father.   
He spoke so sweetly to me&mdash;put his arm around my    shoulders&mdash;asked
me if I were Red Riding Hood or the Princess    Far Away.</p>

<p>   "And, to obey him, I went to find <em>my</em> father. And
found him    dead. Or what the world calls dead.</p>

<p>   "Later, as I stood there outside the door, stunned by what   
had happened, back through the doorway came running a boy.   
Clive, if you have forgotten what you said to that child    there
by the darkened doorway of life, the girl who writes    this has
never forgotten.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"And now, since sorrow has come to you, in my turn I seek you<br/>
where you stand by a darkened door alone, and I send to you<br/>
my very soul in this poor, inky letter,&mdash;all I can<br/>
offer<br/>
&mdash;Clive&mdash;all that I believe&mdash;all that I am.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>ATHALIE</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>So much for tribute and condolence as far as she could be concerned
where she remained among the other millions outside the sacred
threshold across which her letter and her flowers had gone, across
which the girl herself might never go.</p>

<p>After a few days he wrote and thanked her for her letter, not
of course knowing about the lilies:</p>

<p>   "It is the first time death has ever come very near me. I
had    been told and had always thought that we were a long-lived   
race.</p>

<p>   "I am still dazed by it. I suppose the sharper grief will   
come when this dull, unreal sense of stupefaction wears away.</p>

<p>   "We were very close together, my father and I. Oh, but we   
might have been closer, Athalie!    &mdash;I might have been with
him    oftener, seen more of him, spent less time away from him.</p>

<p>   "I <em>did</em> try to be a good son. I could have been far
better.    It's a bitter thing to realise at such a time.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"And I had so much to say to him. I cannot understand that I<br/>
can never say it now.... Athalie dear, my mother wishes me to<br/>
take her abroad. I made arrangements yesterday at the Cunard<br/>
office. We sail Saturday. Could I see you for a moment before<br/>
I go?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>CLIVE</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>To which she replied:</p>

<p>   "I shall be here every evening."</p>

<p>He came Friday night looking very sallow and thin in his black
clothes. Catharine, who was sewing by the centre table, rose to
shake hands with him in sympathetic silence, then went away to
her bedroom, where, once or twice she caught herself whistling
some gay refrain of the moment, and was obliged to check herself.</p>

<p>He had taken Athalie's slender hands and was standing by the
sofa, looking intently at her.</p>

<p>"That night," he said with an effort, "you sent me home&mdash;saying
that I was needed."</p>

<p>"Yes, Clive."</p>

<p>"How did you know?"</p>

<p>"I knew."</p>

<p>"Did you see&mdash;anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she said under her breath.</p>

<p>"Did you see <em>him</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, but his lips scarcely moved to form the words
he uttered.</p>

<p>"I recognised him at once. I had never forgotten him.... It is
difficult to explain how I knew that he was not&mdash;what we call
living."</p>

<p>"But you knew?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said gently.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;did he speak?" The young fellow turned away with a brusque,
hopeless gesture.</p>

<p>"God," he muttered&mdash;"and I couldn't either see or hear him!"</p>

<p>"He did not speak, Clive." The boy looked up at her, his haggard
features working.</p>

<p>She said: "When I first noticed him he was looking at you. Then
he caught my eye. Clive&mdash;it was this time as it had been before&mdash;when
I was twelve years old&mdash;his expression became so sweet and winning&mdash;like
yours when I amuse you&mdash;and you laugh at me but&mdash;like me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Athalie&mdash;I can't seem to endure it! I &mdash;I can't be
reconciled&mdash;" His head fell forward; she put her arms around him
and drew his face against her breast.</p>

<p>"I know," she whispered. "I also have passed that way."</p>

<p>After a few moments he lifted his head, looked around, almost
fearfully.</p>

<p>"Where was it that he stood, Athalie?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, then took one of his hands in hers and he followed
her until she stopped between the sofa and the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Clive."</p>

<p>"So <em>near</em>!" he said aloud to himself. "Couldn't he have
spoken to me?&mdash;just one word&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dearest&mdash;dearest!"</p>

<p>"God knows why you should see him and I shouldn't! I don't understand&mdash;when
I was his son&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not understand either, Clive."</p>

<p>He seemed not to hear her, standing there with blank gaze shifting
from object to object in the room. "I don't understand," he kept
repeating in a dull, almost querulous voice,&mdash;"I don't understand
why." And her heart responded in a passion of tenderness and grief.
But she found no further words to say to him, no explanation that
might comfort him.</p>

<p>"Will he ever come here&mdash;anywhere&mdash;again?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive, I don't know."</p>

<p>"Don't you know? Couldn't you find out?"</p>

<p>"How? I don't know how to find out. I never try to inquire."</p>

<p>"Isn't there some way?"</p>

<p>"I don't really know, Clive. How could I know?"</p>

<p>"But when you see such people&mdash;shadows&mdash;shapes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes.... They are not shadows."</p>

<p>"Do they seem real?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; as real as you are."</p>

<p>"Athalie, how <em>can</em> they be?"</p>

<p>"They are to me. There is nothing ghostly about them."</p>

<p>For a moment it almost seemed to her as though he resented her
clear seeing; then he said: "Have you always been able to see&mdash;this
way?"</p>

<p>"As long as I can remember."</p>

<p>"And you have never tried to cultivate the power?"</p>

<p>"I had rather you did not call it that."</p>

<p>"But it is a power.... Well, call it faculty, then. Have you?"</p>

<p>"No. I told you once that I did not wish to see more clearly
than others. It is all involuntary with me."</p>

<p>"Would you try to cultivate it because I ask you to?"</p>

<p>"Clive!"</p>

<p>"Will you, Athalie?"</p>

<p>The painful colour mantled her face and neck and she turned and
looked away from him as though he had said a shameful thing.</p>

<p>He continued, impatiently: "Why do you feel that way about it?
Why should you not cultivate such a delicate and wonderful sense
of perception? Why are you reluctant? What reason is there for
you to be ashamed?"</p>

<p>"I don't know why."</p>

<p>"There is no reason! If in you there happen to be faculties sensitive
beyond ours, senses more complex, more exquisitely attuned to
what others are blind and deaf to, intuitions that to us seem
miraculous, a spirituality, perhaps, more highly developed, what
is there in that to cause you either embarrassment or concern?
That in certain individualities such is the case is now generally
understood and recognised. You happen to be one of them."</p>

<p>She looked up at him very quietly, but still flushed.</p>

<p>"Why do you wish me to try&mdash;make any effort to develop this&mdash;thing?"</p>

<p>"So that&mdash;if you <em>could</em> see him again&mdash;and if, perhaps,
he had anything to say to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"Will you try, Athalie?"</p>

<p>"I'll try&mdash;if you wish it. And if I can learn how to try."</p>

<p>Had he asked her to strip her gown from her shoulders under his
steady gaze, it had been easier than the promise she gave him.</p>

<p>And now the hour had come for him to bid her good-bye. He said
that he and his mother would not remain abroad for more than the
summer. He said he would write often; spoke a little more vaguely
of seeing her as soon as he returned; drew her cool, white hands
together and kissed them, laid his cheek against them for a moment,
eyes closed wearily.</p>

<p>The door remained ajar behind him after he had gone. Lingering,
her hand heavy on the knob, she listened to the last echo of the
elevator as it dropped into lighted depths below.</p>

<p>Then, very far away, an iron grille clanged. And that ended it.</p>

<p>But she still lingered. There was one more shape to pass through
the door which she yet held open;&mdash;the phantom of her girlhood.
And when at last, it had passed across the threshold, never to
return, she shut the door softly, sinking to her knees there,
her pale cheek resting against the closed panels, her eyes fixed
on vacancy.</p>

<p>So departed those twain out of the room and out of her life,
together&mdash;her lover by brevet, and her lingering girlhood,&mdash;leaving
behind them a woman in a world of men suddenly strange and menacing
and very still.</p>

<p>But Clive went back into a familiar world&mdash;marred, obscured,
distorted for the moment by shock and sorrow&mdash;but still a familiar
world. Because neither his grief nor his love&mdash;as he had termed
it&mdash;had made of him more than he had been,&mdash;not yet a man, yet
no longer a boy, but something with all the infirmities of both
and the saving graces of neither.</p>

<p>In that borderland where he still lingered, morally and spiritually,
the development of character ceases for a while until such time
as the occult frontier be crossed. What is born in the cradle
is lowered into the grave, but always either in nobler or less
noble degrees. For none may linger in that borderland too long
because the unseen boundary moves for him who will not stir when
his time is up&mdash;moves slowly, inexorably nearer, nearer, passing
beneath his feet, until it is lost far in the misty years behind
him.</p>

<p>He wrote her from the steamer twice, the letters being mailed
from Plymouth; then he wrote once from London, once from Paris;
later again from Switzerland, where he had found it cooler, he
said, than anywhere else during that torrid summer.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "One lovely morning in May she arose early in
order to write to Clive."]</p>

<p>Winifred Stuart and her mother had joined them for a motor trip
through Dalmatia. He mentioned it in a letter to Athalie, but
after that he did not refer to them again. In fact he did not
write again for a month or two.</p>

<p>It proved to be a scorching summer in New York. May ended in
a blast of unseasonable weather, cooling off for a week or two
in June, but the furnace heat of July was terrible for the poor
and for the horses&mdash;both of which we have always with us.</p>

<p>Also, for Athalie, it seemed to be turning into one of those
curious, threatening years which begin with every promise but
which end without fulfilment, and in perplexity and care. She
had known such years; she already recognised the symptoms of changing
weather. She seemed to be conscious of premonitions in everybody
and everything. Little vexations and slight disappointments increased;
simple plans miscarried for no reason at all apparently.</p>

<p>Like one who still feels a fair wind blowing yet looking aloft,
sees the uneasy weather-cock veer and veer in varying flaws, so
she, sensitive and fine in mind and body, gradually became aware
of the trend of things; felt the premonition of the distant change
in the atmosphere&mdash;sensed it gathering vaguely, indefinitely disquieting.</p>

<p>One lovely morning in May she arose early in order to write to
Clive. Then, her long letter accomplished and safely mailed, she
went downtown to business, still delicately aglow, exhilarated
as always by her hour of communion with him.</p>

<p>Mr. Wahlbaum, as usual, received her with the jolly and kindly
humour which always characterised him, and they had their usual
friendly, half bantering chat while she was arranging the papers
which his secretary had laid on her desk.</p>

<p>All the morning she took dictation; the soft wind fluttered the
curtains; sparrows chirped noisily; the sky was very blue; Mr.
Wahlbaum smoked steadily.</p>

<p>And when the lunch hour arrived he did a thing which he had never
before done; he asked Athalie to lunch with him.</p>

<p>Which so completely astonished her that she found herself going
down in the private lift with him before she realised that she
was going at all.</p>

<p>The luncheon proved to be very simple but very good. There were
a number of other women in the ladies' annex of the Department
Club,&mdash;nice looking people, quiet, and well dressed. Mr. Wahlbaum
also was very quiet, very considerate, very attentive, and almost
gravely courteous. Their conversation concerned business. He offered
Athalie no cocktail and no wine, but a jug of chilled cider was
set at her elbow and she found it delicious. Mr. Wahlbaum drank
tea, very weak.</p>

<p>When they returned to the office, Athalie began to transcribe
her stenographic notes. It occupied most of the afternoon although
she was wonderfully rapid and accurate and her slim white fingers
hovered mistily over the keys like the vibrating wings of a snowy
moth.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Mr. Wahlbaum ... was very quiet, very considerate,
very attentive."]</p>

<p>Mr. Wahlbaum, always smoking, watched her toward the finish in
placid silence. And for a few moments, also, after she had finished
and had turned to him with a light smile and a lighter sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>"Miss Greensleeve," he said quietly, "I have now been here in
the same office with you, day after day&mdash;excepting our summer
vacations&mdash;for more than five years."</p>

<p>A trifle surprised and sobered by his gravity and deliberation
she nodded silent acquiescence and waited, wondering a little
what else was to come.</p>

<p>It came without preamble: "I have the honour," he said, "to ask
you to marry me."</p>

<p>Still as a stone she sat, gazing at him. And for a long while
his keen eyes sustained her gaze. But presently a slow, deep colour
began to gather on his face. And after a moment he said: "I am
sorry that the verdict is against me."</p>

<p>Tears filled her eyes; she tried to speak, could not, turned
on her pivot-chair, rested her arms on the back, and dropped her
face in them.</p>

<p>It was a long while before she was able to efface the traces
of emotion. She did all she could before she forced herself to
look at him again and say what she must say.</p>

<p>"If I could &mdash;I would, Mr. Wahlbaum," she faltered. "No
man has ever been kinder to me, none more courteous, none more
gentle."</p>

<p>He looked at her wistfully for a moment, and she thought he was
going to speak. But he was wise in the ways of the world. He had
lost. He understood it. Speech was superfluous. He was a quaint
combination of good sportsman and philosophic economist.</p>

<p>He held his peace.</p>

<p>When she left that evening after saying good night to him she
paused at the door, irresolutely, and then came back to his desk
where he was still standing. For he had never failed to rise when
she entered in the morning or took her leave at night.</p>

<p>In silence, now, she offered him her hand, the quick tears springing
to her eyes again; and he took it, bent, and touched the gloved
fingers with his lips, gravely, in silence.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>A few days later, for the first time in her experience there,
Mr. Wahlbaum was not at the office.</p>

<p>Mr. Grossman came in, leered at her, said that Mr. Wahlbaum would
be down next day, lingered furtively as long as he quite dared,
then took himself off, still leering.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Athalie was notified that her salary had been
raised. She went home, elated and deeply touched by the generosity
of Mr. Wahlbaum, scarcely able to wait for the morrow to express
her gratitude to this good, kind man.</p>

<p>But on the morrow Mr. Wahlbaum was not there; nor did he come
the day after, nor the day after that.</p>

<p>The following Tuesday she was seated in the office and generally
occupied with business provided for her by the thrifty Mr. Grossman,
when that same gentleman came into the office on tiptoe.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wahlbaum has just died," he said.</p>

<p>In the sudden shock and consternation she had risen from her
chair, and stood there, one hand resting on her desk top for support.</p>

<p>"Pneumonia," nodded Mr. Grossman. "Sam he smoked too much all
the time. That is what done it, Miss Greensleeve."</p>

<p>Her hands crept to her eyes, covered them convulsively. "Oh!"
she breathed&mdash;"Oh!"</p>

<p>And, for a moment was not aware of the arm of Mr. Grossman around
her waist,&mdash;until it tightened unctuously.</p>

<p>"Dearie," he murmured, "don't you take on so hard. You ain't
goin' to lose your job, because I'm a-goin' to be your best friend
same like he was&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a shudder she stepped clear of him; he caught her by the
waist again and kissed her; and she wrenched herself free and
turned fiercely on him as he advanced again, smirking, watery
of eye, arms outstretched.</p>

<p>Then in the overwhelming revulsion and horror of the act and
of the moment chosen for it when death's shadow already lay dark
upon this vast and busy monument to her dead friend, she turned
on him her dark blue eyes ablaze; and to her twisted, outraged
lips flew, unbidden, the furious anathema of her ragged childhood:</p>

<p>"Damn you!" she stammered,&mdash;"damn you!" And struck him across
the face.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Which impulsive and unconsidered proceeding left two at home
out of work, herself and Doris. Also there was very little more
for Catharine to do, the dull season at Winton's having arrived.</p>

<p>"Any honest job," repeated Doris when she and Athalie and Catharine
met at evening after an all-day's profitless search for that sort
of work; but honest jobs did not seem to be very plentiful in
June, although any number of the other sort were to be had almost
without the asking.</p>

<p>Doris continued to haunt agencies and theatrical offices, dawdling
all day from one to the next, sitting for hours in company with
other aspirants to histrionic honours and wages, gossiping, listening
to stage talk, professional patter, and theatrical scandal until
her pretty ears were buzzing with everything that ought not to
concern her and her moral fastidiousness gradually became less
delicate. Repetition is the great leveller, the great persuader.
The greatest power on earth, for good or evil, is incessant reiteration.</p>

<p>Catharine lost her position, worked at a cheap milliner's for
a week, addressed envelopes for another week, and was again left
unemployed.</p>

<p>Athalie accepted several offers; at one place they didn't pay
her for two weeks and then suggested she take half the salary
agreed upon; at another her employer became offensively familiar;
at another the manager made her position unendurable.</p>

<p>By July the financial outlook in the Greensleeve family was becoming
rather serious: Doris threatened gloomily to go into burlesque;
Catharine at first tearful and discouraged, finally grew careless
and made few real efforts to find employment. Also she began to
go out almost every evening, admitting very frankly that the home
larder had become too lean and unattractive to suit her.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Doris continued to haunt agencies and theatrical
offices."]</p>

<p>Doris always went out more or less; and what troubled Athalie
was not that the girl had opportunities for the decent nourishment
she needed, but that her reticence concerning the people she dined
with was steadily increasing.</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up! I can look out for myself," she always repeated
sullenly. "Anyway, Athalie, <em>you</em> are not the one to bully
me. Nobody ever presented me with a cosy flat and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doris!"</p>

<p>"Didn't your young man give you this flat?"</p>

<p>"Don't speak of him or of me in that manner," said Athalie, flushing
scarlet.</p>

<p>"Why are you so particular? It's the truth. He's given you about
everything a man can offer a girl, hasn't he?&mdash;jewellery, furniture,
clothing&mdash;cats&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you please not say anything more!"</p>

<p>But Doris was still smarting under recent admonition, and she
meant to make an end of Athalie's daily interference: "I will
say what I like when it's the truth," she retorted. "You are very
free with your unsolicited advice. And I'll say this, and it's
true, that not one girl in a thousand who accepts what you have
accepted from Clive Bailey, is straight!"</p>

<p>Athalie's tightening lips quivered: "Do you intimate that I am
not straight?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say that."</p>

<p>"You implied it."</p>

<p>There was a silence; Catharine lounged on the sofa, watching
and listening with interest. After a moment Doris shrugged her
young shoulders.</p>

<p>"Does it matter so much, anyway?" she said with a short, unpleasant
laugh.</p>

<p>"Does <em>what</em> matter&mdash;you little ninny!"</p>

<p>"Whether a girl <em>is</em> straight."</p>

<p>"Is that the philosophy you learn in your theatrical agencies?"
demanded Athalie fiercely. "What nauseating rot you do talk, Doris!"</p>

<p>"Very well. It may be nauseating. But what is a girl to do in
a world run entirely by men?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough what a girl is <em>not</em> to do, don't
you? All right then,&mdash;leave that undone and do what's left."</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> left?" demanded Doris with a mirthless laugh.
"There's scarcely a job that a girl can hold unless she squares
some man to keep it&mdash;and keep&mdash;her!"</p>

<p>"Shame on you! I held mine for over five years," said Athalie
with hot contempt.</p>

<p>"Yes, and then along came the junior partner. You wouldn't square
him: you lost your job! There's always a junior partner in every
business&mdash;when there isn't a senior. There's nothing to it if
you stand in with the firm. If you don't&mdash;good night!"</p>

<p>"You managed to remain at the Egyptian Garden during the entire
season."</p>

<p>"But the fights I had, my dear, and the tricks I employed and
the lies I told and the promises I made! Oh, it's sickening&mdash;sickening!
But&mdash;" she shrugged&mdash;"what are you to do? Thousands of girls go
queer because they're forced to by starvation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Athalie hotly, "that is all stage twaddle and
exaggerated sentimentalism! I don't believe that one girl in a
thousand is forced into a dishonourable life!"</p>

<p>"Then why do girls go queer?"</p>

<p>"Because they want to; that's why! When they don't want to they
don't!"</p>

<p>Catharine, very wide-eyed, said solemnly: "But think of all the
white slaves&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They'd be that if they had been born to millions!" retorted
Athalie. "Ignorance and aptitude, that is white slavery. It's
absolutely nothing else. And in cases where the ignorance is absent,
the aptitude is there. If a girl has an aptitude for becoming
some man's mistress she'll probably do it whether she's ignorant
or educated."</p>

<p>Doris, who had taken to chewing-gum furtively and in private,
discreetly rolled a morsel under her tongue.</p>

<p>"All I know is that your salary is advanced and you're given
a part at the Egyptian Garden if you stand in with Lewenbein or
go to supper with Shemsky. Of course," she added, "there <em>are</em>
theatres where you don't have to be horrid in order to succeed."</p>

<p>"Then," said Athalie drily, "you'd better find work in those
theatres."</p>

<p>Doris glanced sideways at Catharine, who silently returned her
glance as though an understanding and sympathy existed between
them not suspected or shared in by Athalie.</p>

<p>It was not very much of a secret. Some prowling genius of the
agencies whom Doris had met had offered to write a vaudeville
act for her and himself if she could find two other girls. And
she had persuaded Catharine and Genevieve Hunting to try it; and
Cecil Reeve and Francis Hargrave had gaily offered to back it.
They were rehearsing in Reeve's apartments&mdash;between a continuous
series of dinners and suppers.</p>

<p>And it had been her sister's going to Reeve's apartments to which
Athalie had seriously objected,&mdash;not knowing why she went there.</p>

<p>This was one of many scenes that torrid summer in New York, when
Athalie intuitively felt that the year which had begun so happily
for her with the entrance of Clive into her life, was growing
duller and greyer; and that each succeeding day seemed to be swinging
her into a tide of anxiety and mischance,&mdash;a current as yet merely
perceptible, but already increasing in speed toward something
swifter and more stormy.</p>

<p>Already, to her, the future had become overcast, obscure, disquieting.</p>

<p>Steer as she might toward any promising harbour, always she seemed
to be aware of some subtle resistance impeding her.</p>

<p>Every small economy attempted, every retrenchment planned, came
to nothing. Always she was met at some corner by an unlooked-for
necessity entailing further expense.</p>

<p>No money was coming in; her own and her sister's savings were
going steadily, every day, every week.</p>

<p>There seemed no further way to check expenditure. Athalie had
dismissed their servant as soon as she had lost her position at
Wahlbaum and Grossman's. Table expenses were reduced to Spartan
limits, much to the disgust of them all. No clothes were bought,
no luxuries, no trifles. They did their own marketing, their own
cooking, their own housework and laundry. And had it not been
that the apartment entailed no outlay for light, heat, and rent,
they would have been sorely perplexed that spring and summer in
New York.</p>

<p>Athalie permitted herself only one luxury, Hafiz. And one necessity;
stamps and letter paper for foreign correspondence.</p>

<p>The latter was costing her less and less recently. Clive wrote
seldom now. And always very sensitive where he was concerned,
she permitted herself the happiness of writing only after he had
taken the initiative, and a reply from her was due him.</p>

<p>No, matters were not going very well with Athalie. Also she was
frequently physically tired. Perhaps it was the lassitude consequent
on the heat. But at times she had an odd idea that she lacked
courage; and sometimes when lonely, she tried to reason with herself,
tried to teach her heart bravery&mdash;particularly during the long
interims which elapsed between Clive's letters.</p>

<p>As for her attitude toward him&mdash;whether or not she was in love
with him&mdash;she was too busy thinking about him to bother her head
about attitudes or degrees of affection. All the girl knew&mdash;when
she permitted herself to think of herself&mdash;was that she missed
him dreadfully. Otherwise her concern was chiefly for him, for
his happiness and well-being. Also she was concerned regarding
the promise she had made him&mdash;and to which he usually referred
in his letters,&mdash;the promise to try to learn more about this faculty
of hers for clear vision, and, if possible, to employ it for his
sake and in his unhappy service.</p>

<p>This often preoccupied her, troubled her. She did not know how
to go about it; she hesitated to seek those who advertised their
alleged occult powers for sale,&mdash;trance-mediums, mind-readers,
palmists&mdash;all the heterogeneous riffraff lurking always in metropolitan
purlieus, and always with a sly weather-eye on the police.</p>

<p>As usual in her career since the time she could first remember,
she continued to "see clearly" where others saw and heard nothing.</p>

<p>Faint voices in the dusk, a whisper in darkness; perhaps in her
bedroom the subtle intuition of another presence. And sometimes
a touch on her arm, a breath on her cheek, delicate, exquisite&mdash;sometimes
the haunting sweetness of some distant harmony, half heard, half
divined. And now and then a form, usually unknown, almost always
smiling and friendly, visible for a few moments&mdash;the space of
a fire-fly's incandescence&mdash;then fading&mdash;entering her orbit out
of nothing and, going into nothing, out of it.</p>

<p>Of these episodes she had never entertained any fear. Sometimes
they interested her, sometimes even slightly amused her. But they
had never saddened her, not even when they had been the flash-lit
harbingers of death. For only a sense of calmness and serenity
accompanied them: and to her they had always been part of the
world and of life, nothing to wonder at, nothing to fear, and
certainly nothing to intrude on&mdash;merely incidents not concerning
her, not remarkable, but natural and requiring no explanation.</p>

<p>But she herself did not know and could not explain why, even
as a child, she had been always reticent regarding these occurrences,&mdash;why
she had always been disinclined to discuss them. Unless it were
a natural embarrassment and a hesitation to discuss strangers,
as though comment were a species of indelicacy,&mdash;even of unwarranted
intrusion.</p>

<p>One night while reading&mdash;she had been scanning a newspaper column
of advertisements hoping to find a chance for herself or Catharine&mdash;glancing
up she again saw Clive's father seated near her. At the same moment
he lifted his head, which had been resting on one hand, and looked
across the hearthstone at her, smiling faintly.</p>

<p>Entirely unembarrassed, conscious of that atmosphere of serenity
which always was present when such visitors arrived, the girl
sat looking at what her eyes told her she perceived, a slight
and friendly smile curving her lips in silent response.</p>

<p>Presently she became aware that Hafiz, too, saw the visitor,
and was watching him. But this fact she had noticed before, and
it did not surprise her.</p>

<p>And that was all there was to the incident. He rose, walked to
the window, stood there. And after a little while he was not there.
That ended it. And Hafiz went to sleep again.</p>
