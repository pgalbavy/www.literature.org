<p>Captain Strathmore rewarded Abe Storms liberally for the service
he had rendered them, and the mate and captain of the schooner,
as we have said, were rowed back to the boat by Hyde Brazzier.</p>

<p>Reaching the deck of the <em>Coral</em>, they watched the progress
of the great steamer until she vanished from sight in the moonlight,
and then the two friends went into the cabin to "study the chart,"
as they expressed it.</p>

<p>It may be said that this had been the principal business of the
two since leaving the States, though the statement is not strictly
correct. The hum of conversation went on for hours; the night
gradually wore away, but still the two men sat talking in low
tones, and looking at the roll of paper spread out between them,
and which was covered with numerous curious drawings. The theme
must have been an absorbing one, since it banished all thought
of the passage of time from their minds.</p>

<p>"I tell you," said the captain, as he leaned back in his chair,
"there isn't the remotest doubt that a colossal fortune is awaiting
us, and unless some extraordinary accident intervenes, we shall
gather it up."</p>

<p>"So it would seem," replied the mate, with a weary look, "and
yet I sometimes feel certain that it will never be ours &mdash;Good
gracious!"</p>

<p>The two men almost leaped out of their chairs, and their hair
fairly rose on end. They were absolutely certain that no one else
was in the cabin besides themselves. Redvignez was at the wheel,
and Brazzier awaited his call in turn at the end of the watch.
But just then both heard a rustling, and saw a movement in the
berth of Captain Bergen, which showed something was there. It
couldn't be a dog or cat, for there was nothing of the kind on
board. Besides which, just then, the two men caught sight of the
little white hand which clearly belonged to some one of their
own species. Then the covering was thrown back; a mass of tangled
golden hair was observed, and instantly after, the fair face of
a young child peered wonderingly out, as if seeking to learn where
she was.</p>

<p>Of course the little one was Inez Hawthorne, though neither of
the two men had ever seen or heard of her before, and it is, therefore,
idle to attempt to picture their overwhelming astonishment when
they became aware so suddenly of her presence in the cabin.</p>

<p>Neither of the two men was superstitious; but there was good
excuse for their being wonder-struck. If an individual in the
middle of a desert should suddenly become aware of the appearance
of a strange person at his elbow, a situation apparently in which
he could only be placed by supernatural means, it would be a very
mild word to say he would be surprised.</p>

<p>Flinging the coverlet from her shoulders and throwing back her
mass of rich golden hair, Inez assumed the sitting position, with
her dimpled legs swinging over the side, and her little hands
resting on the rail, as if to steady herself during the long swells
of the sea, while she looked at the two men as if trying to recollect
where she was and who they were.</p>

<p>"Well, if that doesn't beat anything that was ever heard or read
of before!" exclaimed the captain, turning about and staring at
her. "Where in the name of the seven wonders did you come from?"</p>

<p>Abe Storms, the mate, did not speak, but seemed to be waiting
to see whether the child had a voice, and thus settle the question
in his mind as to whether it was mortal or not.</p>

<p>The problem was quickly solved, for Inez was never backward in
asserting her individuality.</p>

<p>"How did I come here? That's a great question to ask! I got tired
and lay down to sleep, and have just woke up. I think this is
a real nice boat. Are you the captain? My name is Inez Hawthorne&mdash;what
is yours?"</p>

<p>These questions, uttered with childish rapidity and ingenuousness,
threw some light upon the apparent mystery.</p>

<p>"She belongs to the steamer," said Abe Storms, with his eyes
fixed wonderingly upon her. "She has managed to get in our boat
in some way, and we have carried her off. Did you ever see anything
so pretty?"</p>

<p>As the reader has learned, there was good cause for this admiring
question. Both of the men were bachelors, but they possessed natural
refinement, and they could reverence the innocence and loveliness
of childhood. With the discovery that she was an actual human
being, the awe-struck wonder of the two men vanished, though their
curiosity was great to learn how it was she was carried away from
the steamer.</p>

<p>"Won't you come here and talk with me?" asked Storms, reaching
out his arms invitingly, but a little doubtful whether she would
respond, though the stoop-shouldered inventor was always popular
with children. The answer of Inez was a sudden spring, which landed
her plump into the lap of the mate, while she flung her arms around
his neck with a merry laugh, and then wheeled about on his knee,
so that she could look in the face of either of the men, who,
not unnaturally, felt a strange and strong attraction toward the
beautiful child.</p>

<p>Then the two began a series of questions that were answered in
the characteristic fashion of childhood, but from which the friends
succeeded in extracting something like a clear explanation of
her presence on board the <em>Coral</em>&mdash;so many miles from the
steamer on which she had set sail at San Francisco.</p>

<p>They learned that Inez&mdash;who was such a pet on the <em>Polynesia</em>
that she was allowed to do as she chose&mdash;was invited by one of
the crew to visit the <em>Coral</em>, while she lay so close to
the disabled steamer. The one who gave this invitation was Hyde
Brazzier, and he was struck with the wonderful loveliness of the
child, when she questioned him about the schooner.</p>

<p>There is no nature, however steeped in crime, in which there
is not a divine spark which may be fanned into a flame&mdash;which,
perchance, may illumine the whole soul; and but for the subsequent
strange events, little Inez Hawthorne might have proved, in the
most literal sense, a heaven-sent messenger upon that craft, which
carried so much wickedness in the forecastle.</p>

<p>Brazzier rowed the short intervening distance, and then took
the child by the hand and showed her through the schooner, there
being little to exhibit. Finally she was led into the cabin, where
she said she was tired and wished to lie down. Thereupon Brazzier
lifted her upon the captain's berth and drew the coverlet over
her. A minute later the weary eyes closed in slumber and he left
the cabin.</p>

<p>Brazzier had no intention, up to this time, of using any deception
in the matter; but, under the persuasion of Redvignez, he gave
way to the innate wickedness of his nature, and chuckled over
the lamentable occurrence. They felt pleasure in the certainty
that what they were doing was sure to make other hearts ache.</p>
