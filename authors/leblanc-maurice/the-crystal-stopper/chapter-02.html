<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Notwithstanding my friendly relations with Lupin and the many flattering
proofs of his confidence which he has given me, there is one thing which
I have never been quite able to fathom, and that is the organization of
his gang.
</p>
<p>The existence of the gang is an undoubted fact. Certain adventures can
be explained only by countless acts of devotion, invincible efforts of
energy and powerful cases of complicity, representing so many forces
which all obey one mighty will. But how is this will exerted? Through
what intermediaries, through what subordinates? That is what I do not
know. Lupin keeps his secret; and the secrets which Lupin chooses to
keep are, so to speak, impenetrable.
</p><p>The only supposition which I can allow myself to make is that this gang,
which, in my opinion, is very limited in numbers and therefore all the
more formidable, is completed and extended indefinitely by the addition
of independent units, provisional associates, picked up in every class
of society and in every country of the world, who are the executive
agents of an authority with which, in many cases, they are not even
acquainted. The companions, the initiates, the faithful adherents--men
who play the leading parts under the direct command of Lupin--move to
and fro between these secondary agents and the master.
</p><p>Gilbert and Vaucheray evidently belonged to the main gang. And that is
why the law showed itself so implacable in their regard. For the first
time, it held accomplices of Lupin in its clutches--declared, undisputed
accomplices--and those accomplices had committed a murder. If the murder
was premeditated, if the accusation of deliberate homicide could be
supported by substantial proofs, it meant the scaffold. Now there was,
at the very least, one self-evident proof, the cry for assistance which
Leonard had sent over the telephone a few minutes before his death:
</p><p>“Help!... Murder!... I shall be killed!...”
</p><p>The desperate appeal had been heard by two men, the operator on duty
and one of his fellow-clerks, who swore to it positively. And it was
in consequence of this appeal that the commissary of police, who was at
once informed, had proceeded to the Villa Marie-Therese, escorted by his
men and a number of soldiers off duty.
</p><p>Lupin had a very clear notion of the danger from the first. The fierce
struggle in which he had engaged against society was entering upon a new
and terrible phase. His luck was turning. It was no longer a matter of
attacking others, but of defending himself and saving the heads of his
two companions.
</p><p>A little memorandum, which I have copied from one of the note-books in
which he often jots down a summary of the situations that perplex him,
will show us the workings of his brain:
</p><p>“One definite fact, to begin with, is that Gilbert and Vaucheray
humbugged me. The Enghien expedition, undertaken ostensibly with the
object of robbing the Villa Marie-Therese, had a secret purpose. This
purpose obsessed their minds throughout the operations; and what they
were looking for, under the furniture and in the cupboards, was one
thing and one thing alone: the crystal stopper. Therefore, if I want to
see clear ahead, I must first of all know what this means. It is certain
that, for some hidden reason, that mysterious piece of glass possesses
an incalculable value in their eyes. And not only in theirs, for, last
night, some one was bold enough and clever enough to enter my flat and
steal the object in question from me.”
</p><p>This theft of which he was the victim puzzled Lupin curiously.
</p><p>Two problems, both equally difficult of solution, presented themselves
to his mind. First, who was the mysterious visitor? Gilbert, who enjoyed
his entire confidence and acted as his private secretary, was the only
one who knew of the retreat in the Rue Matignon. Now Gilbert was in
prison. Was Lupin to suppose that Gilbert had betrayed him and put the
police on his tracks? In that case, why were they content with taking
the crystal stopper, instead of arresting him, Lupin?
</p><p>But there was something much stranger still. Admitting that they had
been able to force the doors of his flat--and this he was compelled to
admit, though there was no mark to show it--how had they succeeded in
entering the bedroom? He turned the key and pushed the bolt as he did
every evening, in accordance with a habit from which he never departed.
And, nevertheless--the fact was undeniable--the crystal stopper had
disappeared without the lock or the bolt having been touched. And,
although Lupin flattered himself that he had sharp ears, even when
asleep, not a sound had waked him!
</p><p>He took no great pains to probe the mystery. He knew those problems too
well to hope that this one could be solved other than in the course of
events. But, feeling very much put out and exceedingly uneasy, he then
and there locked up his entresol flat in the Rue Matignon and swore that
he would never set foot in it again.
</p><p>And he applied himself forthwith to the question of corresponding with
Vaucheray or Gilbert.
</p><p>Here a fresh disappointment awaited him. It was so clearly understood,
both at the Sante Prison and at the Law Courts, that all communication
between Lupin and the prisoners must be absolutely prevented, that a
multitude of minute precautions were ordered by the prefect of police
and minutely observed by the lowest subordinates. Tried policemen,
always the same men, watched Gilbert and Vaucheray, day and night, and
never let them out of their sight.
</p><p>Lupin, at this time, had not yet promoted himself to the crowning honour
of his career, the post of chief of the detective-service, [*] and,
consequently, was not able to take steps at the Law Courts to insure the
execution of his plans. After a fortnight of fruitless endeavours, he
was obliged to bow.
</p><ul>
  <li>See 813, by Maurice Leblanc, translated by Alexander
     Teixeira de Mattos.</li></ul>
<p>He did so with a raging heart and a growing sense of anxiety.
</p><p>“The difficult part of a business,” he often says, “is not the finish,
but the start.”
</p><p>Where was he to start in the present circumstances? What road was he to
follow?
</p><p>His thoughts recurred to Daubrecq the deputy, the original owner of the
crystal stopper, who probably knew its importance. On the other hand,
how was Gilbert aware of the doings and mode of life of Daubrecq the
deputy? What means had he employed to keep him under observation? Who
had told him of the place where Daubrecq spent the evening of that day?
These were all interesting questions to solve.
</p><p>Daubrecq had moved to his winter quarters in Paris immediately after the
burglary at the Villa Marie-Therese and was now living in his own house,
on the left-hand side of the little Square Lamartine that opens out at
the end of the Avenue Victor-Hugo.
</p><p>First disguising himself as an old gentleman of private means, strolling
about, cane in hand, Lupin spent his time in the neighbourhood, on the
benches of the square and the avenue. He made a discovery on the first
day. Two men, dressed as workmen, but behaving in a manner that left no
doubt as to their aims, were watching the deputy’s house. When Daubrecq
went out, they set off in pursuit of him; and they were immediately
behind him when he came home again. At night, as soon as the lights were
out, they went away.
</p><p>Lupin shadowed them in his turn. They were detective-officers.
</p><p>“Hullo, hullo!” he said to himself. “This is hardly what I expected. So
the Daubrecq bird is under suspicion?”
</p><p>But, on the fourth day, at nightfall, the two men were joined by six
others, who conversed with them in the darkest part of the Square
Lamartine. And, among these new arrivals, Lupin was vastly astonished
to recognize, by his figure and bearing, the famous Prasville, the
erstwhile barrister, sportsman and explorer, now favourite at the
Elysee, who, for some mysterious reason, had been pitchforked into the
headquarters of police as secretary-general, with the reversion of the
prefecture.
</p><p>And, suddenly, Lupin remembered: two years ago, Prasville and Daubrecq
the deputy had had a personal encounter on the Place du Palais-Bourbon.
The incident made a great stir at the time. No one knew the cause of it.
Prasville had sent his seconds to Daubrecq on the same day; but Daubrecq
refused to fight.
</p><p>A little while later, Prasville was appointed secretary-general.
</p><p>“Very odd, very odd,” said Lupin, who remained plunged in thought, while
continuing to observe Prasville’s movements.
</p><p>At seven o’clock Prasville’s group of men moved away a few yards, in the
direction of the Avenue Henri-Martin. The door of a small garden on
the right of the house opened and Daubrecq appeared. The two detectives
followed close behind him and, when he took the Rue-Taitbout train,
jumped on after him.
</p><p>Prasville at once walked across the square and rang the bell. The
garden-gate was between the house and the porter’s lodge. The portress
came and opened it. There was a brief conversation, after which
Prasville and his companions were admitted.
</p><p>“A domiciliary visit,” said Lupin. “Secret and illegal. By the
strict rules of politeness, I ought to be invited. My presence is
indispensable.”
</p><p>Without the least hesitation he went up to the house, the door of which
had not been closed, and, passing in front of the portress, who was
casting her eyes outside, he asked, in the hurried tones of a person who
is late for an appointment:
</p><p>“Have the gentlemen come?”
</p><p>“Yes, you will find them in the study.”
</p><p>His plan was quite simple: if any one met him, he would pretend to be a
tradesman. But there was no need for this subterfuge. He was able, after
crossing an empty hall, to enter a dining-room which also had no one in
it, but which, through the panes of a glass partition that separated
the dining-room from the study, afforded him a view of Prasville and his
five companions.
</p><p>Prasville opened all the drawers with the aid of false keys. Next, he
examined all the papers, while his companions took down the books from
the shelves, shook the pages of each separately and felt inside the
bindings.
</p><p>“Of course, it’s a paper they’re looking for,” said Lupin. “Bank-notes,
perhaps...”
</p><p>Prasville exclaimed:
</p><p>“What rot! We shan’t find a thing!”
</p><p>Yet he obviously did not abandon all hope of discovering what he wanted,
for he suddenly seized the four bottles in a liqueur-stand, took out the
four stoppers and inspected them.
</p><p>“Hullo!” thought Lupin. “Now he’s going for decanter-stoppers! Then it’s
not a question of a paper? Well, I give it up.”
</p><p>Prasville next lifted and examined different objects; and he asked:
</p><p>“How often have you been here?”
</p><p>“Six times last winter,” was the reply.
</p><p>“And you have searched the house thoroughly?”
</p><p>“Every one of the rooms, for days at a time, while he was visiting his
constituency.”
</p><p>“Still... still...” And he added, “Has he no servant at present?”
</p><p>“No, he is looking for one. He has his meals out and the portress keeps
the house as best she can. The woman is devoted to us...”
</p><p>Prasville persisted in his investigations for nearly an hour and a half,
shifting and fingering all the knick-knacks, but taking care to put
everything back exactly where he found it. At nine o’clock, however, the
two detectives who had followed Daubrecq burst into the study:
</p><p>“He’s coming back!”
</p><p>“On foot?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“Have we time?”
</p><p>“Oh, dear, yes!”
</p><p>Prasville and the men from the police-office withdrew, without undue
haste, after taking a last glance round the room to make sure that there
was nothing to betray their visit.
</p><p>The position was becoming critical for Lupin. He ran the risk of
knocking up against Daubrecq, if he went away, or of not being able
to get out, if he remained. But, on ascertaining that the dining-room
windows afforded a direct means of exit to the square, he resolved to
stay. Besides, the opportunity of obtaining a close view of Daubrecq was
too good to refuse; and, as Daubrecq had been out to dinner, there was
not much chance of his entering the dining-room.
</p><p>Lupin, therefore, waited, holding himself ready to hide behind a velvet
curtain that could be drawn across the glazed partition in case of need.
</p><p>He heard the sound of doors opening and shutting. Some one walked into
the study and switched on the light. He recognized Daubrecq.
</p><p>The deputy was a stout, thickset, bull-necked man, very nearly bald,
with a fringe of gray whiskers round his chin and wearing a pair of
black eye-glasses under his spectacles, for his eyes were weak and
strained. Lupin noticed the powerful features, the square chin, the
prominent cheek-bones. The hands were brawny and covered with hair, the
legs bowed; and he walked with a stoop, bearing first on one hip and
then on the other, which gave him something of the gait of a gorilla.
But the face was topped by an enormous, lined forehead, indented with
hollows and dotted with bumps.
</p><p>There was something bestial, something savage, something repulsive about
the man’s whole personality. Lupin remembered that, in the Chamber of
Deputies, Daubrecq was nicknamed “The Wild Man of the Woods” and that
he was so labelled not only because he stood aloof and hardly ever
mixed with his fellow-members, but also because of his appearance, his
behaviour, his peculiar gait and his remarkable muscular development.
</p><p>He sat down to his desk, took a meerschaum pipe from his pocket,
selected a packet of caporal among several packets of tobacco which lay
drying in a bowl, tore open the wrapper, filled his pipe and lit it.
Then he began to write letters.
</p><p>Presently he ceased his work and sat thinking, with his attention fixed
on a spot on his desk.
</p><p>He lifted a little stamp-box and examined it. Next, he verified the
position of different articles which Prasville had touched and replaced;
and he searched them with his eyes, felt them with his hands, bending
over them as though certain signs, known to himself alone, were able to
tell him what he wished to know.
</p><p>Lastly, he grasped the knob on an electric bell-push and rang. The
portress appeared a minute later.
</p><p>He asked:
</p><p>“They’ve been, haven’t they?”
</p><p>And, when the woman hesitated about replying, he insisted:
</p><p>“Come, come, Clemence, did you open this stampbox?”
</p><p>“No, sir.”
</p><p>“Well, I fastened the lid down with a little strip of gummed paper. The
strip has been broken.”
</p><p>“But I assure you,...” the woman began.
</p><p>“Why tell lies,” he said, “considering that I myself instructed you to
lend yourself to those visits?”
</p><p>“The fact is...”
</p><p>“The fact is that you want to keep on good terms with both sides... Very
well!” He handed her a fifty-franc note and repeated, “Have they been?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“The same men as in the spring?”
</p><p>“Yes, all five of them... with another one, who ordered them about.”
</p><p>“A tall, dark man?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>Lupin saw Daubrecq’s mouth hardening; and Daubrecq continued:
</p><p>“Is that all?”
</p><p>“There was one more, who came after they did and joined them... and
then, just now, two more, the pair who usually keep watch outside the
house.”
</p><p>“Did they remain in the study?”
</p><p>“Yes, sir.”
</p><p>“And they went away when I came back? A few minutes before, perhaps?”
</p><p>“Yes, sir.”
</p><p>“That will do.”
</p><p>The woman left the room. Daubrecq returned to his letter-writing. Then,
stretching out his arm, he made some marks on a white writing-tablet, at
the end of his desk, and rested it against the desk, as though he wished
to keep it in sight. The marks were figures; and Lupin was able to read
the following subtraction-sum:
</p><p>   “9 - 8 = 1”
</p><p>And Daubrecq, speaking between his teeth, thoughtfully uttered the
syllables:
</p><p>“Eight from nine leaves one... There’s not a doubt about that,” he
added, aloud. He wrote one more letter, a very short one, and addressed
the envelope with an inscription which Lupin was able to decipher when
the letter was placed beside the writing-tablet:
</p><p>“To Monsieur Prasville, Secretary-general of the Prefecture of Police.”
</p><p>Then he rang the bell again:
</p><p>“Clemence,” he said, to the portress, “did you go to school as a child?”
</p><p>“Yes, sir, of course I did.”
</p><p>“And were you taught arithmetic?”
</p><p>“Why, sir...”
</p><p>“Well, you’re not very good at subtraction.”
</p><p>“What makes you say that?”
</p><p>“Because you don’t know that nine minus eight equals one. And that, you
see, is a fact of the highest importance. Life becomes impossible if you
are ignorant of that fundamental truth.”
</p><p>He rose, as he spoke, and walked round the room, with his hands behind
his back, swaying upon his hips. He did so once more. Then, stopping at
the dining-room, he opened the door:
</p><p>“For that matter, there’s another way of putting the problem. Take
eight from nine; and one remains. And the one who remains is here, eh?
Correct! And monsieur supplies us with a striking proof, does he not?”
</p><p>He patted the velvet curtain in which Lupin had hurriedly wrapped
himself:
</p><p>“Upon my word, sir, you must be stifling under this! Not to say that
I might have amused myself by sticking a dagger through the curtain.
Remember Hamlet’s madness and Polonius’ death: ‘How now! A rat? Dead,
for a ducat, dead!’ Come along, Mr. Polonius, come out of your hole.”
</p><p>It was one of those positions to which Lupin was not accustomed and
which he loathed. To catch others in a trap and pull their leg was all
very well; but it was a very different thing to have people teasing him
and roaring with laughter at his expense. Yet what could he answer back?
</p><p>“You look a little pale, Mr. Polonius... Hullo! Why, it’s the
respectable old gentleman who has been hanging about the square for some
days! So you belong to the police too, Mr. Polonius? There, there, pull
yourself together, I sha’n’t hurt you!... But you see, Clemence, how
right my calculation was. You told me that nine spies had been to the
house. I counted a troop of eight, as I came along, eight of them in the
distance, down the avenue. Take eight from nine and one remains: the one
who evidently remained behind to see what he could see. Ecce homo!”
</p><p>“Well? And then?” said Lupin, who felt a mad craving to fly at the
fellow and reduce him to silence.
</p><p>“And then? Nothing at all, my good man... What more do you want? The
farce is over. I will only ask you to take this little note to Master
Prasville, your employer. Clemence, please show Mr. Polonius out. And,
if ever he calls again, fling open the doors wide to him. Pray look upon
this as your home, Mr. Polonius. Your servant, sir!...”
</p><p>Lupin hesitated. He would have liked to talk big and to come out with
a farewell phrase, a parting speech, like an actor making a showy exit
from the stage, and at least to disappear with the honours of war. But
his defeat was so pitiable that he could think of nothing better than to
bang his hat on his head and stamp his feet as he followed the portress
down the hall. It was a poor revenge.
</p><p>“You rascally beggar!” he shouted, once he was outside the door, shaking
his fist at Daubrecq’s windows. “Wretch, scum of the earth, deputy, you
shall pay for this!... Oh, he allows himself...! Oh, he has the cheek
to...! Well, I swear to you, my fine fellow, that, one of these days...”
</p><p>He was foaming with rage, all the more as, in his innermost heart, he
recognized the strength of his new enemy and could not deny the masterly
fashion in which he had managed this business. Daubrecq’s coolness, the
assurance with which he hoaxed the police-officials, the contempt with
which he lent himself to their visits at his house and, above all, his
wonderful self-possession, his easy bearing and the impertinence of his
conduct in the presence of the ninth person who was spying on him: all
this denoted a man of character, a strong man, with a well-balanced
mind, lucid, bold, sure of himself and of the cards in his hand.
</p><p>But what were those cards? What game was he playing? Who held the
stakes? And how did the players stand on either side? Lupin could not
tell. Knowing nothing, he flung himself headlong into the thick of the
fray, between adversaries desperately involved, though he himself was in
total ignorance of their positions, their weapons, their resources and
their secret plans. For, when all was said, he could not admit that
the object of all those efforts was to obtain possession of a crystal
stopper!
</p><p>One thing alone pleased him: Daubrecq had not penetrated his disguise.
Daubrecq believed him to be in the employ of the police. Neither
Daubrecq nor the police, therefore, suspected the intrusion of a third
thief in the business. This was his one and only trump, a trump
that gave him a liberty of action to which he attached the greatest
importance.
</p><p>Without further delay, he opened the letter which Daubrecq had handed
him for the secretary-general of police. It contained these few lines:
</p><p> “Within reach of your hand, my dear Prasville, within reach of your
 hand!  You touched it!  A little more and the trick was done... But
 you’re too big a fool.  And to think that they couldn’t hit upon
 any one better than you to make me bite the dust.  Poor old France!
</p><p> “Good-bye, Prasville.  But, if I catch you in the act, it will be a
 bad lookout for you: my maxim is to shoot at sight.
</p><p><strong>“DAUBRECQ”</strong>
</p><p>“Within reach of your hand,” repeated Lupin, after reading the note.
“And to think that the rogue may be writing the truth! The most
elementary hiding-places are the safest. We must look into this, all
the same. And, also, we must find out why Daubrecq is the object of
such strict supervision and obtain a few particulars about the fellow
generally.”
</p><p>The information supplied to Lupin by a private inquiry-office consisted
of the following details:
</p><p>      “ALEXIS DAUBRECQ, deputy of the Bouches-du-Rhone for the past two
 years; sits among the independent members.  Political opinions not
 very clearly defined, but electoral position exceedingly strong,
 because of the enormous sums which he spends in nursing his
 constituency.  No private income.  Nevertheless, has a house in
 Paris, a villa at Enghien and another at Nice and loses heavily at
 play, though no one knows where the money comes from.  Has great
 influence and obtains all he wants without making up to ministers
 or, apparently, having either friends or connections in political
 circles.”
</p><p>“That’s a trade docket,” said Lupin to himself. “What I want is
a domestic docket, a police docket, which will tell me about the
gentleman’s private life and enable me to work more easily in this
darkness and to know if I’m not getting myself into a tangle by
bothering about the Daubrecq bird. And time’s getting short, hang it!”
</p><p>One of the residences which Lupin occupied at that period and which he
used oftener than any of the others was in the Rue Chateaubriand, near
the Arc de l’Etoile. He was known there by the name of Michel Beaumont.
He had a snug flat here and was looked after by a manservant, Achille,
who was utterly devoted to his interests and whose chief duty was to
receive and repeat the telephone-messages addressed to Lupin by his
followers.
</p><p>Lupin, on returning home, learnt, with great astonishment, that a woman
had been waiting to see him for over an hour:
</p><p>“What! Why, no one ever comes to see me here! Is she young?”
</p><p>“No... I don’t think so.”
</p><p>“You don’t think so!”
</p><p>“She’s wearing a lace shawl over her head, instead of a hat, and you
can’t see her face... She’s more like a clerk... or a woman employed in
a shop. She’s not well-dressed...”
</p><p>“Whom did she ask for?”
</p><p>“M. Michel Beaumont,” replied the servant.
</p><p>“Queer. And why has she called?”
</p><p>“All she said was that it was about the Enghien business... So I thought
that...”
</p><p>“What! The Enghien business! Then she knows that I am mixed up in that
business... She knows that, by applying here...”
</p><p>“I could not get anything out of her, but I thought, all the same, that
I had better let her in.”
</p><p>“Quite right. Where is she?”
</p><p>“In the drawing-room. I’ve put on the lights.”
</p><p>Lupin walked briskly across the hall and opened the door of the
drawing-room:
</p><p>“What are you talking about?” he said, to his man. “There’s no one
here.”
</p><p>“No one here?” said Achille, running up.
</p><p>And the room, in fact, was empty.
</p><p>“Well, on my word, this takes the cake!” cried the servant. “It wasn’t
twenty minutes ago that I came and had a look, to make sure. She was
sitting over there. And there’s nothing wrong with my eyesight, you
know.”
</p><p>“Look here, look here,” said Lupin, irritably. “Where were you while the
woman was waiting?”
</p><p>“In the hall, governor! I never left the hall for a second! I should
have seen her go out, blow it!”
</p><p>“Still, she’s not here now...”
</p><p>“So I see,” moaned the man, quite flabbergasted.
</p><p>“She must have got tired of waiting and gone away. But, dash it all, I
should like to know how she got out!”
</p><p>“How she got out?” said Lupin. “It doesn’t take a wizard to tell that.”
</p><p>“What do you mean?”
</p><p>“She got out through the window. Look, it’s still ajar. We are on the
ground-floor... The street is almost always deserted, in the evenings.
There’s no doubt about it.”
</p><p>He had looked around him and satisfied himself that nothing had been
taken away or moved. The room, for that matter, contained no knick-knack
of any value, no important paper that might have explained the
woman’s visit, followed by her sudden disappearance. And yet why that
inexplicable flight?
</p><p>“Has any one telephoned?” he asked.
</p><p>“No.”
</p><p>“Any letters?”
</p><p>“Yes, one letter by the last post.”
</p><p>“Where is it?”
</p><p>“I put it on your mantel-piece, governor, as usual.”
</p><p>Lupin’s bedroom was next to the drawing-room, but Lupin had permanently
bolted the door between the two. He, therefore, had to go through the
hall again.
</p><p>Lupin switched on the electric light and, the next moment, said:
</p><p>“I don’t see it...”
</p><p>“Yes... I put it next to the flower-bowl.”
</p><p>“There’s nothing here at all.”
</p><p>“You must be looking in the wrong place, governor.”
</p><p>But Achille moved the bowl, lifted the clock, bent down to the grate, in
vain: the letter was not there.
</p><p>“Oh blast it, blast it!” he muttered. “She’s done it... she’s taken
it... And then, when she had the letter, she cleared out... Oh, the
slut!...”
</p><p>Lupin said:
</p><p>“You’re mad! There’s no way through between the two rooms.”
</p><p>“Then who did take it, governor?”
</p><p>They were both of them silent. Lupin strove to control his anger and
collect his ideas. He asked:
</p><p>“Did you look at the envelope?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“Anything particular about it?”
</p><p>“Yes, it looked as if it had been written in a hurry, or scribbled,
rather.”
</p><p>“How was the address worded?... Do you remember?” asked Lupin, in a
voice strained with anxiety.
</p><p>“Yes, I remembered it, because it struck me as funny...”
</p><p>“But speak, will you? Speak!”
</p><p>“It said, ‘Monsieur de Beaumont, Michel.’”
</p><p>Lupin took his servant by the shoulders and shook him:
</p><p>“It said ‘de’ Beaumont? Are you sure? And ‘Michel’ after ‘Beaumont’?”
</p><p>“Quite certain.”
</p><p>“Ah!” muttered Lupin, with a choking throat. “It was a letter from
Gilbert!”
</p><p>He stood motionless, a little pale, with drawn features. There was no
doubt about it: the letter was from Gilbert. It was the form of address
which, by Lupin’s orders, Gilbert had used for years in corresponding
with him. Gilbert had at last--after long waiting and by dint of endless
artifices--found a means of getting a letter posted from his prison and
had hastily written to him. And now the letter was intercepted! What did
it say? What instructions had the unhappy prisoner given? What help was
he praying for? What stratagem did he suggest?
</p><p>Lupin looked round the room, which, contrary to the drawing-room,
contained important papers. But none of the locks had been forced; and
he was compelled to admit that the woman had no other object than to get
hold of Gilbert’s letter.
</p><p>Constraining himself to keep his temper, he asked:
</p><p>“Did the letter come while the woman was here?”
</p><p>“At the same time. The porter rang at the same moment.”
</p><p>“Could she see the envelope?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>The conclusion was evident. It remained to discover how the visitor had
been able to effect her theft. By slipping from one window to the other,
outside the flat? Impossible: Lupin found the window of his room shut.
By opening the communicating door? Impossible: Lupin found it locked and
barred with its two inner bolts.
</p><p>Nevertheless, a person cannot pass through a wall by a mere operation of
will. To go in or out of a room requires a passage; and, as the act was
accomplished in the space of a few minutes, it was necessary, in the
circumstances, that the passage should be previously in existence, that
it should already have been contrived in the wall and, of course, known
to the woman. This hypothesis simplified the search by concentrating
it upon the door; for the wall was quite bare, without a cupboard,
chimney-piece or hangings of any kind, and unable to conceal the least
outlet.
</p><p>Lupin went back to the drawing-room and prepared to make a study of the
door. But he at once gave a start. He perceived, at the first glance,
that the left lower panel of the six small panels contained within the
cross-bars of the door no longer occupied its normal position and that
the light did not fall straight upon it. On leaning forward, he saw two
little tin tacks sticking out on either side and holding the panel in
place, similar to a wooden board behind a picture-frame. He had only to
shift these. The panel at once came out.
</p><p>Achille gave a cry of amazement. But Lupin objected:
</p><p>“Well? And what then? We are no better off than before. Here is an empty
oblong, eight or nine inches wide by sixteen inches high. You’re not
going to pretend that a woman can slip through an opening which would
not admit the thinnest child of ten years old!”
</p><p>“No, but she can have put her arm through and drawn the bolts.”
</p><p>“The bottom bolt, yes,” said Lupin. “But the top bolt, no: the distance
is far too great. Try for yourself and see.”
</p><p>Achille tried and had to give up the attempt.
</p><p>Lupin did not reply. He stood thinking for a long time. Then, suddenly,
he said:
</p><p>“Give me my hat... my coat...”
</p><p>He hurried off, urged by an imperative idea. And, the moment he reached
the street, he sprang into a taxi:
</p><p>“Rue Matignon, quick!...”
</p><p>As soon as they came to the house where he had been robbed of the
crystal stopper, he jumped out of the cab, opened his private entrance,
went upstairs, ran to the drawing-room, turned on the light and crouched
at the foot of the door leading to his bedroom.
</p><p>He had guessed right. One of the little panels was loosened in the same
manner.
</p><p>And, just as in his other flat in the Rue Chateaubriand, the opening was
large enough to admit a man’s arm and shoulder, but not to allow him to
draw the upper bolt.
</p><p>“Hang!” he shouted, unable any longer to master the rage that had been
seething within him for the last two hours. “Blast! Shall I never have
finished with this confounded business?”
</p><p>In fact, an incredible ill-luck seemed to dog his footsteps, compelling
him to grope about at random, without permitting him to use the elements
of success which his own persistency or the very force of things placed
within his grasp. Gilbert gave him the crystal stopper. Gilbert sent him
a letter. And both had disappeared at that very moment.
</p><p>And it was not, as he had until then believed, a series of fortuitous
and independent circumstances. No, it was manifestly the effect of an
adverse will pursuing a definite object with prodigious ability and
incredible boldness, attacking him, Lupin, in the recesses of his safest
retreats and baffling him with blows so severe and so unexpected that he
did not even know against whom he had to defend himself. Never, in the
course of his adventures, had he encountered such obstacles as now.
</p><p>And, little by little, deep down within himself, there grew a haunting
dread of the future. A date loomed before his eyes, the terrible date
which he unconsciously assigned to the law to perform its work of
vengeance, the date upon which, in the light of a wan April morning, two
men would mount the scaffold, two men who had stood by him, two comrades
whom he had been unable to save from paying the awful penalty...
