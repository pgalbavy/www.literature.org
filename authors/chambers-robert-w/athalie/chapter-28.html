<p>Clive's enforced idleness had secretly humiliated him and made
him restless. Athalie in her tender wisdom understood how it was
with him before he did himself, and she was already deftly guiding
his balked energy into a brand new channel, the same being a bucolic
one.</p>

<p>At first he had demurred, alleging total ignorance of husbandry;
and, seated on the sill of an open window and looking down at
him in the garden, she tormented him to her heart's content:</p>

<p>"Ignorant of husbandry!" she mimicked,&mdash;"when any husband I ever
heard of could go to school to you and learn what a real husband
ought to be! Why <em>will</em> you pretend to be so painfully
modest, Clive, when you are really secretly pleased with yourself
and entirely convinced that, in you, the world might discover
a living pattern of model domesticity!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Think!</em> If I were only as certain of anything else!
Never had I dreamed that any man could become so cowed, so spiritless,
so perfectly house and yard broken&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I come upstairs," he said, "I'll settle <em>you</em>!"</p>

<p>Leaning from the window overlooking the garden she lazily defied
him; turned up her dainty nose at him; mocked at him until he
flung aside the morning paper and rose, bent on her punishment.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive, don't!" she pleaded, leaning low from the sill. "I
won't tease you any more,&mdash;and this gown is fresh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll come up and freshen it!" he threatened.</p>

<p>"Please don't rumple me. I'll come down if you like. Shall I?"</p>

<p>"All right, darling," he said, resuming his newspaper and cigarette.</p>

<p>She came, seated herself demurely beside him, twitched his newspaper
until he cast an ominous glance at his tormentor.</p>

<p>"Dear," she said, "I simply can't let you alone; you are so bland
and self-satisfied&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Athalie&mdash;if you persist in tormenting me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I torment you? <em>I?</em> An humble accessory in the scenery
set for you? I?&mdash;a stage property fashioned merely for the hero
of the drama to sit upon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right! I'll do that now!&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she nestled close to him, warding off wrath with both arms
clasping his, and looking up at him out of winning eyes in which
but a tormenting glint remained.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't rumple this very beautiful and brand new gown,
would you, darling? It was so frightfully expensive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must care. You must <em>become</em> thrifty and
shrewd and devious and close, or you'll never make a successful
farmer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dearest, that's nonsense. What do I know about farming?"</p>

<p>"Nothing yet. But you know what a wonderful man you are. Never
forget that, Clive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you don't stop laughing at me, you little wretch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you want me to remain young?" she asked reproachfully,
while two tiny demons of gaiety danced in her eyes. "If I can't
laugh I'll grow old. And there's nothing very funny here except
you and Hafiz &mdash;Oh, Clive! You <em>have</em> rumpled me!
Please don't do it again! Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;<em>yes!</em> I do surrender!
I <em>am</em> sorry&mdash;that you are so funny &mdash;Clive! You'll
ruin this gown!... I promise not to say another disrespectful
word.... I don't know whether I'll kiss you or not&mdash;<em>Yes!</em>
Yes I will, dear. Yes, I'll do it tenderly&mdash;you heartless wretch!
&mdash;I tell you I'll do it tenderly.... Oh wait, Clive! Is Mrs.
Connor looking out of any window? Where's Connor? Are you sure
he's not in sight?... And I shouldn't care to have Hafiz see us.
He's a moral kitty&mdash;"</p>

<p>She pretended to look fearfully around, then, with adorable tenderness,
she paid her forfeit and sat silent for a while with her slim
white fingers linked in his, in that breathless little revery
which always stilled her under the magic of his embrace.</p>

<p>He said at last: "Do you really suppose I could make this farm-land
pay?"</p>

<p>And that was really the beginning of it all.</p>

<p>Once decided he seemed to go rather mad about it, buying agricultural
paraphernalia recklessly and indiscriminately for a meditated
assault upon fields long fallow.</p>

<p>Connor already had as much as he could attend to in the garden;
but, like all Irishmen, he had a cousin, and the cousin possessed
agricultural lore and a pair of plough-horses.</p>

<p>So early fall ploughing developed into a mania with Clive and
Athalie; and they formed a habit of sitting side by side like
a pair of birds on fences in the early October sunshine, their
fascinated eyes following the brown furrows turning where one
T. Phelan was breaking up pasture and meadow too long sod-bound.</p>

<p>In intervals between tenderer and more intimate exchange of sentiments
they discussed such subjects as lime, nitrogen, phosphoric acid,
and the rotation of crops.</p>

<p>Also Athalie had accumulated much literature concerning incubators,
brooders, and the several breeds of domestic fowl; and on paper
they had figured out overwhelming profits.</p>

<p>The insidious land-hunger which attacks all who contemplate making
two dozen blades of grass grow where none grew before, now seized
upon Clive and gnawed him. And he extended the acreage, taking
in woods and uplands as far as the headwaters of Spring Pond Brook,
vastly to Athalie's delight.</p>

<p>So the October days burned like a procession of golden flames
passing in magic sequence amid yellowing woods and over the brown
and spongy gold of salt meadows which had been sheared for stable
bedding. And everywhere over their land lay the dun-coloured velvet
squares of freshly ploughed fields awaiting unfragrant fertilizer
and the autumn rains.</p>

<p>The rains came heavily toward the end of October; and November
was grey and wet and rather warm. But open fires became necessary
in the house, and now they regularly reddened the twilight in
library and living-room when the early November dusk brought Athalie
and Clive indoors.</p>

<p>Hither they came, the fire-lit hearth their trysting place after
they had exchanged their rain-drenched clothes for something dry;
and there they curled up on the wide sofas and watched the swift
darkness fall, and the walls and ceiling redden.</p>

<p>It was an hour which Athalie had once read of as the "Children's
Hour" and now she understood better its charming significance.
And she kept it religiously, permitting herself to do nothing,
and making Clive defer anything he had to do, until after dinner.
Then he might read his paper or book, and she could take up her
sewing if she chose, or study, or play, or write the few letters
that she cared to write.</p>

<p>Clive wrote no more, now. In this first year together they desired
each other only, indifferent to all else outside.</p>

<p>It was to her the magic year of fulfilment; to him an enchanted
interlude wherein only the girl beside him mattered.</p>

<p>Athalie sewed a great deal on odd, delicate, sheer materials
where narrowness and length ruled proportions, and where there
seemed to be required much lace and many little ribbons. Also
she hummed to herself as she sewed, singing under her breath endless
airs which had slipped into her head she scarce knew when or how.</p>

<p>An odd and fragrant freshness seemed to cling to her making her
almost absurdly youthful, as though she had suddenly dropped back
to her girlhood. Clive noticed it.</p>

<p>"You look about sixteen," he said.</p>

<p>"My heart is younger, dear."</p>

<p>"How young?"</p>

<p>"You know when it was born, don't you? Very well, it is as many
days old as I have been in love with you. Before that it was a
muscle capable merely of sturdy friendship."</p>

<p>One day a packet came from New York for her. It contained two
rings, one magnificent, the other a plain circlet. She kissed
him rather shyly, wore both that evening, but not again.</p>

<p>"I am not ashamed," she explained serenely. "Folkways are now
a matter of indifference to me. Civilisation must offer me a better
argument than it has offered hitherto before I resign to it my
right in you, or deny your right to me."</p>

<p>He knew that civilisation would lock them out and remain unconcerned
as to what became of them. Doubtless she knew it too, as she sat
there sewing on the frail garment which lay across her knee and
singing blithely under her breath some air with cadence like a
berceuse.</p>

<p>During the "Children's Hour" she sat beside him, always quiet;
or if stirred from her revery to a brief exchange of low-voiced
words, she soon relapsed once more into that happy, brooding silence
by the firelight.</p>

<p>Then came dinner, and the awakened gaiety of unquenched spirits;
then the blessed evening hours with him.</p>

<p>But the last hour of these she called <em>her</em> hour; and
always laid aside her book or sewing, and slipped from the couch
to the floor at his feet, laying her head against his knees.</p>

<p>Snow came in December; and Christmas followed. They kept the
mystic festival alone together; and Athalie had a tiny tree lighted
in the room between hers and Clive's, and hung it with toys and
picture books.</p>

<p>It was very pretty in its tinsel and tinted globes; and its faint
light glimmered on the walls and dainty furniture of the dim pink
room.</p>

<p>Afterward Athalie laid away tinsel and toy, wrapping all safely
in tissue, as though to be kept secure and fresh for another Christmas&mdash;the
most wonderful that any girl could dream of. And perhaps it was
to be even more wonderful than Athalie had dreamed.</p>

<p>December turned very cold. The ice thickened; and she skated
with Clive on Spring Pond. The ice also remained through January
and February that winter; but after December had ended Athalie
skated no more.</p>

<p>Clive, unknown to her, had sent for a Shaker cloak and hood of
scarlet; and when it arrived Athalie threw back her lovely head
and laughed till the tears dimmed her eyes.</p>

<p>"All the same," he said, "you don't look much older in it than
you looked in your red hood and cloak the first day I ever set
eyes on you."</p>

<p>"You poor darling!&mdash;as though even you could push back the hands
of Time! It's the funniest and sweetest thing you ever did&mdash;to
send for this red, hooded cloak."</p>

<p>However she wore it whenever she ventured out with him on foot
or in the sleigh which he had bought. Once, coming home, she was
still wearing it when Mrs. Connor brought to them two peach turnovers.</p>

<p>A fire had been lighted in the ancient stove; and they went out
to the sun-parlour,&mdash;once the bar&mdash;and sat in the same old arm-chairs
exactly as they had been seated that night so long ago; and there
they ate their peach turnovers, their enchanted eyes meeting,
striving to realise it all, and the intricate ways of Destiny
and Chance and Fate.</p>

<p>February was a month of heavy snows that year; great drifts buried
the fences and remained until well into March. April was April,&mdash;and
very much so; but they saw the blue waters of the bay sometimes;
and dogwood and willow stems were already aglow with colour; and
a premature blue-bird sang near Athalie's garden. Crocuses appeared
everywhere with grape hyacinths and snow-drops. Then jonquil and
narcissus opened in all their loveliness, and soft winds stirred
the waters of the fountain.</p>

<p>May found the garden uncovered, with tender amber-tinted shoots
and exquisite fronds of green wherever the lifted mulch disclosed
the earth. Also peonies were up and larkspur, and the ambitious
promise of the hollyhocks delighted Athalie.</p>

<p>Pink peach buds bloomed; cherry, pear, and apple covered the
trees with rosy snow; birds sang everywhere; and the waters of
the pool mirrored a sky of purest blue. But Athalie now walked
no further than the garden seat,&mdash;and walked slowly, leaning always
on Clive's arm.</p>

<p>In those days throughout May her mother was with her in her room
almost every night. But Athalie did not speak of this to Clive.</p>
