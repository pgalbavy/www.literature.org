<p>“You’re sure that’s a dog in the cavern?” demanded Ben as the three
crossed the summit and entered the gully, after leaving their machine on
the shelf to the east.
</p><p>“Sure it’s a dog in the cavern!” insisted Terry. “And look here,” he
went on, glancing keenly about, “there’s two fellows hanging around here
somewhere. They’re the chaps who set me to watching the Englishman early
last night. They claim to be connected with the business men who are
hunting over on the other side of the valley, but I guess they are just
plain mountain hoboes who have been hired to do the dirty work for the
sportsmen.”
</p><p>“I don’t see them anywhere around!” Ben suggested.
</p><p>“I don’t think they’re here, don’t you know!” DuBois put in, looking far
down the gully. “You see,” he continued, “the camp-fire has gone out,
and there hasn’t been any breakfast cooked here this morning.”
</p><p>“They probably made a sneak after you got away,” Ben replied. “They knew
they wouldn’t get any money for what they did after that, so they
probably took to their heels.”
</p><p>“They may be watching around, don’t you know,” the Englishman insisted.
“I don’t like the idea of hanging around here without knowing whether
they are watching us from some of these bloody rocks.”
</p><p>The three hunted faithfully for a long time, notwithstanding the fact
that Terry was constantly complaining that the dog would be almost
starved to death. At last, however, they gave over the quest and moved
on to the entrance to the cavern.
</p><p>Just before they entered, Ben caught the Englishman by the shoulder and
faced him around toward the valley.
</p><p>“Look who’s here!” he said.
</p><p>What they both saw was the <u>Ann</u> and a strange aeroplane moving swiftly
in their direction.
</p><p>“I guess Mr. Havens is moving the whole camp over!” Ben suggested. “And
I haven’t got a word to say against it if he is! It’s rotten the way
we’ve left him alone.”
</p><p>“I think that’s Mr. Havens in the <u>Ann</u>!” declared Jimmie handing the
field-glass to Ben. “And I think that’s Carl with him!”
</p><p>Ben inspected the approaching flying machines through the glass and
declared that Mr. Havens and Carl were on board the <u>Ann</u>, and that Dick
Sherman and two unknown men were on the strange machine.
</p><p>“I’d like to know what they’re coming here for!” Jimmie exclaimed. “Just
as we get the thing all ready to make a home run, and get a hungry dog
out of a hole in a wall, they come butting in to split the glory!”
</p><p>“And the reward!” added Ben with a grin.
</p><p>“I don’t know where the machines can land, don’t you know!” suggested
DuBois.
</p><p>The aviators, however, found landing-places. Mr. Havens lighting on the
shelf where the fire had been, and Dick Sherman coming to earth close
beside the machine Ben had brought.
</p><p>In a short time the two parties met almost directly in front of the
cavern. To the surprise of the other members of the party, Dick Sherman
called the Englishman aside and spoke to him earnestly for a few
moments. At the conclusion of the conversation, the Englishman’s face
fairly beamed with good nature.
</p><p>“I’d like to know what’s coming off here!” cried Jimmie.
</p><p>“That’s what I’d like to know,” put in Terry tipsily. “Here we’ve got a
perfectly good breakfast in this basket getting cold, and I don’t know
what that dog’ll say when we give him a frosty meal! I wish now that I’d
gone and fed him while you boys were hunting for those two outlaws you
didn’t find!”
</p><p>“What do you think, Mr. DuBois,” Carl broke in. “Dick Sherman arrested
Neil Howell and Chubby over there at the hunters’ camp and left them
handcuffed and tied up in one of our tents.”
</p><p>“Yes, he was just telling me about that, don’t you know,” replied the
Englishman.
</p><p>“Well, how the old scratch did he get any information against them?”
demanded Ben. “If he’s got them under arrest for complicity in the
abduction of inspector Colleton, why doesn’t he say so?”
</p><p>“Suppose they are implicated in the abduction case,” demanded Carl, “how
did Officer Sherman come to know anything about it? He hasn’t been
working on the case.”
</p><p>Ben broke into a shout of laughter, and Terry, who was beginning to
think the breakfast never would be needed, turned hastily into the
cavern.
</p><p>“Look here,” Ben said in a moment, “I didn’t tell you boys everything
that took place at Field last night. After I got done telegraphing, Mr.
DuBois took the wire and held a long conversation with Officer Sherman.
How he found Sherman I don’t know, but the operator seemed to help a
lot, after Mr. DuBois gave him a roll of bills that would choke a cow,
and in the end they routed out the officer, and the arrest of Howell and
Chubby is the result of that conference.”
</p><p>“Oh, come, don’t you know!” pleaded the Englishman. “I only told Mr.
Sherman what I suspected. You see this man Howell appeared to recognize
that bag, and his manner showed me that he was in cahoots with the man
in brown who was killed in the race.”
</p><p>“Come on, come on!” yelled Terry. “I’ve got a patient in here starving
to death!”
</p><p>“We really ought to hurry,” advised Ben. “I’m afraid we’ve been too full
of our own schemes to appreciate the exact situation.”
</p><p>“Come along, then,” advised Terry.
</p><p>The whole party, save Mr. Havens, trooped into the cavern and turned to
the left when they came to the rock which split the subterranean place
into two chambers. Keeping straight on, illuminating the cavern with
their searchlights as they went, they came to an opening in the south
wall which had been temporarily barricaded with rocks and timbers.
</p><p>When Ben held the searchlight to the small opening between the top
timber and the roof of the chamber a pale and frightened face looked
out.
</p><p>“Hello, Colleton!” exclaimed Ben.
</p><p>“Thank God!” was all the imprisoned man said.
</p><p>In a short time the barricade was down and the inspector, safe and
sound, was out in the open air, talking earnestly with Mr. Havens who,
of course, had not entered the cavern.
</p><p>“I never expected to see the light of day again!” the inspector said in
a trembling voice.
</p><p>“Now, don’t begin to tell us the story of your life,” warned old Terry,
advancing with the basket of provisions. “You eat this good breakfast!”
</p><p>“But, look here, Terry,” Jimmie grinned. “You said you wanted that
breakfast for a dog!”
</p><p>“Sure!” exclaimed the old crook. “I forgot all about the dog!”
</p><p>He raced back into the cavern and soon returned carrying a little puppy
in his arms.
</p><p>“He was asleep when you brought me out!” Colleton explained. “I forgot
all about him. He’s been a great deal of comfort to me!”
</p><p>“Do you mean to say, Terry, that you ordered all that breakfast for that
little puppy?” demanded Jimmie.
</p><p>“Well,” replied the old crook, “I really wanted the breakfast for the
dog, but I didn’t know but the man might eat part of it! You see,” he
continued, “I promised the outlaws that I wouldn’t tell where this man,”
pointing to Colleton, “was, and I promised that I wouldn’t lead any one
to him, so I had to keep my word, don’t you see?”
</p><p>“But you did tell us where he was and you did lead us to him!” laughed
Jimmie.
</p><p>“No, I didn’t,” argued Terry, “I told you where there was a hungry
little puppy, and I took you to where he was. Of course, if you
discovered the man when we went to feed the puppy, I’m not to blame for
that.”
</p><p>“You’re an old fraud, Terry!” cried Jimmie.
</p><p>“Yes, he’s an old fraud,” laughed Dick Sherman, “but I’m going to see
that he gets out of this little scrape and leads a decent life. He’ll be
all right if he only quits the booze act.”
</p><p>“I’ve quit now!” insisted Terry. “I’ve limited myself to two pint
bottles a day!”
</p><p>“Well,” Mr. Havens said, “so far as I can see, the case is closed. The
man who abducted Colleton is dead. Two of the men who assisted in his
abduction are under arrest, and the proof which points to the Kuro
mail-order company as the principal in the crime is complete. All that
remains for us to do is to see that the prisoners get to Washington and
that the proof is placed before the grand jury. That will close the case
so far as we are concerned.”
</p><p>“Then,” said Jimmie with a sly grin, “I move we stay in the mountains a
couple of weeks and have a little fun before we go to Washington.”
</p><p>“That would please me!” replied Dick Sherman, “but I’ve got to get busy
getting this whiskey out, and looking up proof against the smugglers now
under arrest.”
</p><p>All the others returned to the old camp, from which the prisoners were
taken that night by the officer, and a great feast was spread in honor
of the victory which had been gained.
</p><p>The boys hunted game, fished in the clear mountain streams, and sailed
over valley and mountain in their aeroplanes for two glorious weeks and
then returned to New York.
</p><p>When they reached the big city, the Colleton case was entirely disposed
of. Howell and Chubby had pleaded guilty and received long sentences,
and the members of the fraudulent mail-order company had been convicted
and sentenced to ten years each.
</p><p>The large reward which had been offered for the discovery of Colleton
and the arrest of the perpetrators of the outrage was paid to Mr.
Havens, according to his previous bargain with the secret service
department. In time, of course, the most of the cash found its way into
the hands of the three boys.
</p><p>When Colleton came to relate the story of his abduction it was
discovered that Ben and Jimmie had actually reasoned out the events
practically as they had taken place. The inspector had been drugged in
his office by a cigar, disguised there, forced to open the safe and desk
and bring out the papers, and had been taken across the continent in a
Pullman stateroom as stated. He remembered little or nothing after
opening the safe in his own office in Washington until he found himself
in the smugglers’ cavern, having been kept under the influence of
opiates during all that time. To this day Colleton occasionally asks
Jimmie if every one of the excerpts from his “dream-book” come true.
</p><p>The Englishman remained for some months in New York, the guest of Mr.
Havens at the hangar on Long Island, and on many occasions he was asked
to tell the story of the mysterious hand-bag bought of the porter on the
Pullman train, and to relate in full the adventures of the bag and its
contents until the day the disguise and the documents it had contained
landed a prominent and wealthy mail-order firm in the penitentiary, and
Mr. Havens was often called upon to relate the events leading up to the
Capture in the Air.

happened to the Patrol in their trip through the “mountains of the sky”
in the Moonshiners’ Paradise of the old Tar Heel State, North Carolina.
When you start to read you will not lay the book down until the last
word has been reached.
</p><p>THE BOY SCOUTS ON THE TRAIL; or, Scouting through the Big Game Country.
</p><p>In this story the Boy Scouts once more find themselves in camp and

trails, as well as the desperate men who had sought a refuge in this
lonely country, making most delightful reading for every lad who has red
blood in his veins. This is a story which every boy will be glad to read
and recommend to his chums.

Patrol.

Silver Fox Patrol are fast learning to take care of themselves when
abroad. Many of the secrets of the woods, usually known only to old
hunters and trappers, are laid bare to the eyes of the reader. Thad and
his chums have a wonderful experience when they are employed by the
State of Maine to act as Fire Wardens, since every year terrible
conflagrations sweep through the pine forests, doing great damage.
</p><p>THE BOY SCOUTS THROUGH THE BIG TIMBER; or, The Search for the Lost
Tenderfoot.
</p><p>A serious calamity threatens the Silver Fox Patrol when on one of their
vacation trips to the wonderland of the great Northwest. How apparent
disaster is bravely met and overcome by Thad and his friends, forms the
main theme of the story, which abounds in plenty of humor, rollicking
situations, hairbreadth escapes and thrilling adventures, such as all
boys like to read about. If you ever dream of camping out in the woods,
here you may learn how to do it.
</p><p>THE BOY SCOUTS IN THE ROCKIES; or, The Secret of The Hidden Silver Mine.
</p><p>By this time the boys of the Silver Fox Patrol have learned through
experience how to rough it upon a long hike. Their last tour takes them
into the wildest region of the great Rocky Mountains, and here they meet
with many strange adventures that severely test their grit, as well as
their ability to grapple with emergencies. This is one of the most
interesting of the stories in the Boy Scout Series,—the experiences of
Thad Brewster and his Cranford troop abounds in plenty of humor, and
hairbreadth escapes.
