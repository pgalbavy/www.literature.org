<p>It was, indeed, high time for them to run. On every side the company of
the Black Arrow was making for the hill. Some, being better runners, or
having open ground to run upon, had far outstripped the others, and were
already close upon the goal; some, following valleys, had spread out to
right and left, and outflanked the lads on either side.
</p><p>Dick plunged into the nearest cover. It was a tall grove of oaks, firm
underfoot and clear of underbrush, and as it lay down-hill, they made
good speed. There followed next a piece of open, which Dick avoided,
holding to his left. Two minutes after, and the same obstacle arising,
the lads followed the same course. Thus it followed that, while the
lads, bending continually to the left, drew nearer and nearer to the
highroad and the river which they had crossed an hour or two before, the
great bulk of their pursuers were leaning to the other hand, and running
towards Tunstall.
</p><p>The lads paused to breathe. There was no sound of pursuit. Dick put his
ear to the ground, and still there was nothing; but the wind, to be
sure, still made a turmoil in the trees, and it was hard to make
certain.
</p><p>"On again," said Dick; and, tired as they were, and Matcham limping
with his injured foot, they pulled themselves together, and once more
pelted down the hill.
</p><p>Three minutes later, they were breasting through a low thicket of
evergreen. High overhead, the tall trees made a continuous roof of
foliage. It was a pillared grove, as high as a cathedral, and except for
the hollies among which the lads were struggling, open and smoothly
swarded.
</p><p>On the other side, pushing through the last fringe of evergreen, they
blundered forth again into the open twilight of the grove.
</p><p>"Stand!" cried a voice.
</p><p>And there, between the huge stems, not fifty feet before them, they
beheld a stout fellow in green, sore blown with running, who instantly
drew an arrow to the head and covered them. Matcham stopped with a cry;
but Dick, without a pause, ran straight upon the forester, drawing his
dagger as he went. The other, whether he was startled by the daring of
the onslaught, or whether he was hampered by his orders, did not shoot;
he stood wavering; and before he had time to come to himself, Dick
bounded at his throat, and sent him sprawling backward on the turf. The
arrow went one way and the bow another with a sounding twang. The
disarmed forester grappled his assailant; but the dagger shone and
descended twice. Then came a couple of groans, and then Dick rose to his
feet again, and the man lay motionless, stabbed to the heart.
</p><p>"On!" said Dick; and he once more pelted forward, Matcham trailing in
the rear. To say truth, they made but poor speed of it by now, labouring
dismally as they ran, and catching for their breath like fish. Matcham
had a cruel stitch, and his head swam; and as for Dick, his knees were
like lead. But they kept up the form of running with undiminished
courage.
</p><p>Presently they came to the end of the grove. It stopped abruptly; and
there, a few yards before them, was the highroad from Risingham to
Shoreby, lying, at this point, between two even walls of forest.
</p><p>At the sight Dick paused; and as soon as he stopped running, he became
aware of a confused noise, which rapidly grew louder. It was at first
like the rush of a very high gust of wind, but soon it became more
definite, and resolved itself into the galloping of horses; and then, in
a flash, a whole company of men-at-arms came driving round the corner,
swept before the lads, and were gone again upon the instant. They rode
as for their lives, in complete disorder; some of them were wounded;
riderless horses galloped at their side with bloody saddles. They were
plainly fugitives from the great battle.
</p><p>The noise of their passage had scarce begun to die away towards Shoreby,
before fresh hoofs came echoing in their wake, and another deserter
clattered down the road; this time a single rider and, by his splendid
armour, a man of high degree. Close after him there followed several
baggage-waggons, fleeing at an ungainly canter, the drivers flailing at
the horses as if for life. These must have run early in the day; but
their cowardice was not to save them. For just before they came abreast
of where the lads stood wondering, a man in hacked armour, and seemingly
beside himself with fury, overtook the waggons, and with the truncheon
of a sword, began to cut the drivers down. Some leaped from their places
and plunged into the wood; the others he sabred as they sat, cursing
them the while for cowards in a voice that was scarce human.
</p><p>All this time the noise in the distance had continued to increase; the
rumble of carts, the clatter of horses, the cries of men, a great,
confused rumour, came swelling on the wind; and it was plain that the
rout of a whole army was pouring, like an inundation, down the road.
</p><p>Dick stood sombre. He had meant to follow the highway till the turn for
Holywood, and now he had to change his plan. But above all, he had
recognised the colours of Earl Risingham, and he knew that the battle
had gone finally against the rose of Lancaster. Had Sir Daniel joined,
and was he now a fugitive and ruined? or had he deserted to the side of
York, and was he forfeit to honour? It was an ugly choice.
</p><p>"Come," he said, sternly; and, turning on his heel, he began to walk
forward through the grove, with Matcham limping in his rear.
</p><p>For some time they continued to thread the forest in silence. It was now
growing late; the sun was setting in the plain beyond Kettley; the
tree-tops overhead glowed golden; but the shadows had begun to grow
darker and the chill of the night to fall.
</p><p>"If there were anything to eat!" cried Dick, suddenly, pausing as he
spoke.
</p><p>Matcham sat down and began to weep.
</p><p>"Ye can weep for your own supper, but when it was to save men's lives,
your heart was hard enough," said Dick, contemptuously. "Y' 'ave seven
deaths upon your conscience, Master John; I'll ne'er forgive you that."
</p><p>"Conscience!" cried Matcham, looking fiercely up. "Mine! And ye have the
man's red blood upon your dagger! And wherefore did ye slay him, the
poor soul? He drew his arrow, but he let not fly; he held you in his
hand, and spared you! 'Tis as brave to kill a kitten, as a man that not
defends himself."
</p><p>Dick was struck dumb.
</p><p>"I slew him fair. I ran me in upon his bow," he cried.
</p><p>"It was a coward blow," returned Matcham. "Y'are but a lout and bully,
Master Dick; ye but abuse advantages; let there come a stronger, we will
see you truckle at his boot! Ye care not for vengeance, neither--for
your father's death that goes unpaid, and his poor ghost that clamoureth
for justice. But if there come but a poor creature in your hands that
lacketh skill and strength, and would befriend you, down she shall go!"
</p><p>Dick was too furious to observe that "she."
</p><p>"Marry!" he cried, "and here is news! Of any two the one will still be
stronger. The better man throweth the worse, and the worse is well
served. Ye deserve a belting, Master Matcham, for your ill-guidance and
unthankfulness to meward; and what ye deserve ye shall have."
</p><p>And Dick, who, even in his angriest temper, still preserved the
appearance of composure, began to unbuckle his belt.
</p><p>"Here shall be your supper," he said, grimly.
</p><p>Matcham had stopped his tears; he was as white as a sheet, but he looked
Dick steadily in the face, and never moved. Dick took a step, swinging
the belt. Then he paused, embarrassed by the large eyes and the thin,
weary face of his companion. His courage began to subside.
</p><p>"Say ye were in the wrong, then," he said, lamely.
</p><p>"Nay," said Matcham, "I was in the right. Come, cruel! I be lame; I be
weary; I resist not; I ne'er did thee hurt; come, beat me--coward!"
</p><p>Dick raised the belt at this last provocation; but Matcham winced and
drew himself together with so cruel an apprehension, that his heart
failed him yet again. The strap fell by his side, and he stood
irresolute, feeling like a fool.
</p><p>"A plague upon thee, shrew!" he said. "An ye be so feeble of hand, ye
should keep the closer guard upon your tongue. But I'll be hanged before
I beat you!" and he put on his belt again. "Beat you I will not," he
continued; "but forgive you?--never. I knew ye not; ye were my master's
enemy; I lent you my horse; my dinner ye have eaten; y' 'ave called me a
man o' wood, a coward, and a bully. Nay, by the mass! the measure is
filled, and runneth over. 'Tis a great thing to be weak, I trow: ye can
do your worst, yet shall none punish you; ye may steal a man's weapons
in the hour of need, yet may the man not take his own again;--y'are
weak, forsooth! Nay, then, if one cometh charging at you with a lance,
and crieth he is weak, ye must let him pierce your body through! Tut!
fool words!"
</p><p>"And yet ye beat me not," returned Matcham.
</p><p>"Let be," said Dick--"let be. I will instruct you. Y' 'ave been
ill-nurtured, methinks, and yet ye have the makings of some good, and,
beyond all question, saved me from the river. Nay, I had forgotten it; I
am as thankless as thyself. But, come, let us on. An we be for Holywood
this night, ay, or to-morrow early, we had best set forward speedily."
</p><p>But though Dick had talked himself back into his usual good-humour,
Matcham had forgiven him nothing. His violence, the recollection of the
forester whom he had slain--above all, the vision of the upraised belt,
were things not easily to be forgotten.
</p><p>"I will thank you, for the form's sake," said Matcham. "But, in sooth,
good Master Shelton, I had liever find my way alone. Here is a wide
wood; prithee, let each choose his path; I owe you a dinner and a
lesson. Fare ye well!"
</p><p>"Nay," cried Dick, "if that be your tune, so be it, and a plague be with
you!"
</p><p>Each turned aside, and they began walking off severally, with no thought
of the direction, intent solely on their quarrel. But Dick had not gone
ten paces ere his name was called, and Matcham came running after.
</p><p>"Dick," he said, "it were unmannerly to part so coldly. Here is my hand,
and my heart with it. For all that wherein you have so excellently
served and helped me--not for the form, but from the heart, I thank you.
Fare ye right well."
</p><p>"Well, lad," returned Dick, taking the hand which was offered him, "good
speed to you, if speed you may. But I misdoubt it shrewdly. Y'are too
disputatious."
</p><p>So then they separated for the second time; and presently it was Dick
who was running after Matcham.
</p><p>"Here," he said, "take my cross-bow; shalt not go unarmed."
</p><p>"A cross-bow!" said Matcham. "Nay, boy, I have neither the strength to
bend nor yet the skill to aim with it. It were no help to me, good boy.
But yet I thank you."
</p><p>The night had now fallen, and under the trees they could no longer read
each other's face.
</p><p>"I will go some little way with you," said Dick. "The night is dark. I
would fain leave you on a path, at least. My mind misgiveth me, y'are
likely to be lost."
</p><p>Without any more words, he began to walk forward, and the other once
more followed him. The blackness grew thicker and thicker. Only here and
there, in open places, they saw the sky, dotted with small stars. In the
distance, the noise of the rout of the Lancastrian army still continued
to be faintly audible; but with every step they left it farther in the
rear.
</p><p>At the end of half an hour of silent progress they came forth upon a
broad patch of heathy open. It glimmered in the light of the stars,
shaggy with fern and islanded with clumps of yew. And here they paused
and looked upon each other.
</p><p>"Y'are weary?" Dick said.
</p><p>"Nay, I am so weary," answered Matcham, "that methinks I could lie down
and die."
</p><p>"I hear the chiding of a river," returned Dick. "Let us go so far forth,
for I am sore athirst."
</p><p>The ground sloped down gently; and, sure enough, in the bottom, they
found a little murmuring river, running among willows. Here they threw
themselves down together by the brink; and putting their mouths to the
level of a starry pool, they drank their fill.
</p><p>"Dick," said Matcham, "it may not be. I can no more."
</p><p>"I saw a pit as we came down," said Dick. "Let us lie down therein and
sleep."
</p><p>"Nay, but with all my heart!" cried Matcham.
</p><p>The pit was sandy and dry; a shock of brambles hung upon one hedge, and
made a partial shelter; and there the two lads lay down, keeping close
together for the sake of warmth, their quarrel all forgotten. And soon
sleep fell upon them like a cloud, and under the dew and stars they
rested peacefully.
