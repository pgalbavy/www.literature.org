<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

The morning of the second day of her incarceration
in the east tower of the palace of Astok, Prince of Dusar,
found Thuvia of Ptarth waiting in dull apathy the coming
of the assassin.
<P>
She had exhausted every possibility of escape, going
over and over again the door and the windows, the
floor and the walls.
<P>
The solid ersite slabs she could not even scratch;
the tough Barsoomian glass of the windows would have
shattered to nothing less than a heavy sledge in the hands
of a strong man.  The door and the lock were impregnable.
There was no escape.  And they had stripped her of her
weapons so that she could not even anticipate the hour
of her doom, thus robbing them of the satisfaction of
witnessing her last moments.
<P>
When would they come?  Would Astok do the deed with
his own hands?  She doubted that he had the courage
for it.  At heart he was a coward--she had known it since
first she had heard him brag as, a visitor at the court of
her father, he had sought to impress her with his valour.
<P>
She could not help but compare him with another.
And with whom would an affianced bride compare an
unsuccessful suitor?  With her betrothed?  And did Thuvia
of Ptarth now measure Astok of Dusar by the standards
of Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol?
<P>
She was about to die; her thoughts were her own to do
with as she pleased; yet furthest from them was Kulan Tith.
Instead the figure of the tall and comely Heliumite
filled her mind, crowding therefrom all other images.
<P>
She dreamed of his noble face, the quiet dignity of his bearing,
the smile that lit his eyes as he conversed with his friends,
and the smile that touched his lips as he fought with his enemies--
the fighting smile of his Virginian sire.
<P>
And Thuvia of Ptarth, true daughter of Barsoom, found
her breath quickening and heart leaping to the memory of
this other smile--the smile that she would never see again.
With a little half-sob the girl sank to the pile of
silks and furs that were tumbled in confusion beneath
the east windows, burying her face in her arms.
<P>
In the corridor outside her prison-room two men had
paused in heated argument.
<P>
"I tell you again, Astok," one was saying, "that I shall
not do this thing unless you be present in the room."
<P>
There was little of the respect due royalty in the tone
of the speaker's voice.  The other, noting it, flushed.
<P>
"Do not impose too far upon my friendship for you,
Vas Kor," he snapped.  "There is a limit to my patience."
<P>
"There is no question of royal prerogative here,"
returned Vas Kor.  "You ask me to become an assassin in
your stead, and against your jeddak's strict injunctions.
You are in no position, Astok, to dictate to me; but
rather should you be glad to accede to my reasonable
request that you be present, thus sharing the guilt
with me.  Why should I bear it all?"
<P>
The younger man scowled, but he advanced toward
the locked door, and as it swung in upon its hinges,
he entered the room beyond at the side of Vas Kor.
<P>
Across the chamber the girl, hearing them enter, rose
to her feet and faced them.  Under the soft copper of her
skin she blanched just a trifle; but her eyes were brave
and level, and the haughty tilt of her firm little chin was
eloquent of loathing and contempt.
<P>
"You still prefer death?" asked Astok.
<P>
"To YOU, yes," replied the girl coldly.
<P>
The Prince of Dusar turned to Vas Kor and nodded.
The noble drew his short-sword and crossed the room
toward Thuvia.
<P>
"Kneel!" he commanded.
<P>
"I prefer to die standing," she replied.
<P>
"As you will," said Vas Kor, feeling the point of his
blade with his left thumb.  "In the name of Nutus, Jeddak
of Dusar!" he cried, and ran quickly toward her.
<P>
"In the name of Carthoris, Prince of Helium!"
came in low tones from the doorway.
<P>
Vas Kor turned to see the panthan he had recruited at his
son's house leaping across the floor toward him. The fellow
brushed past Astok with an:  "After him, you--calot!"
<P>
Vas Kor wheeled to meet the charging man.
<P>
"What means this treason?" he cried.
<P>
Astok, with bared sword, leaped to Vas Kor's assistance.
The panthan's sword clashed against that of the noble,
and in the first encounter Vas Kor knew that he faced a
master swordsman.
<P>
Before he half realized the stranger's purpose he found
the man between himself and Thuvia of Ptarth, at bay
facing the two swords of the Dusarians.  But he fought
not like a man at bay.  Ever was he the aggressor, and
though always he kept his flashing blade between the girl
and her enemies, yet he managed to force them hither
and thither about the room, calling to the girl to follow
close behind him.
<P>
Until it was too late neither Vas Kor nor Astok dreamed
of that which lay in the panthan's mind; but at last as
the fellow stood with his back toward the door, both
understood--they were penned in their own prison, and
now the intruder could slay them at his will, for Thuvia
of Ptarth was bolting the door at the man's direction,
first taking the key from the opposite side, where
Astok had left it when they had entered.
<P>
Astok, as was his way, finding that the enemy did not
fall immediately before their swords, was leaving the
brunt of the fighting to Vas Kor, and now as his eyes
appraised the panthan carefully they presently went wider
and wider, for slowly he had come to recognize the
features of the Prince of Helium.
<P>
The Heliumite was pressing close upon Vas Kor.  The noble was
bleeding from a dozen wounds.  Astok saw that he could not
for long withstand the cunning craft of that terrible sword hand.
<P>
"Courage, Vas Kor!" he whispered in the other's ear.
"I have a plan.  Hold him but a moment longer and all
will be well," but the balance of the sentence,
"with Astok, Prince of Dusar," he did not voice aloud.
<P>
Vas Kor, dreaming no treachery, nodded his head,
and for a moment succeeded in holding Carthoris at bay.
Then the Heliumite and the girl saw the Dusarian prince
run swiftly to the opposite side of the chamber, touch
something in the wall that sent a great panel swinging
inward, and disappear into the black vault beyond.
<P>
It was done so quickly that by no possibility could
they have intercepted him.  Carthoris, fearful lest Vas Kor
might similarly elude him, or Astok return immediately
with reinforcements, sprang viciously in upon his
antagonist, and a moment later the headless body of
the Dusarian noble rolled upon the ersite floor.
<P>
"Come!" cried Carthoris.  "There is no time to be lost.
Astok will be back in a moment with enough warriors to
overpower me."
<P>
But Astok had no such plan in mind, for such a
move would have meant the spreading of the fact among
the palace gossips that the Ptarthian princess was a
prisoner in the east tower.  Quickly would the word have
come to his father, and no amount of falsifying could
have explained away the facts that the jeddak's
investigation would have brought to light.
<P>
Instead Astok was racing madly through a long corridor
to reach the door of the tower-room before Carthoris
and Thuvia left the apartment.  He had seen the girl
remove the key and place it in her pocket-pouch, and
he knew that a dagger point driven into the keyhole from
the opposite side would imprison them in the secret
chamber till eight dead worlds circled a cold, dead sun.
<P>
As fast as he could run Astok entered the main corridor
that led to the tower chamber.  Would he reach the
door in time?  What if the Heliumite should have already
emerged and he should run upon him in the passageway? 
Astok felt a cold chill run up his spine.  He had
no stomach to face that uncanny blade.
<P>
He was almost at the door.  Around the next turn of the
corridor it stood.  No, they had not left the apartment.
Evidently Vas Kor was still holding the Heliumite!
<P>
Astok could scarce repress a grin at the clever manner
in which he had outwitted the noble and disposed of
him at the same time.  And then he rounded the turn and
came face to face with an auburn-haired, white giant.
<P>
The fellow did not wait to ask the reason for his coming;
instead he leaped upon him with a long-sword, so that
Astok had to parry a dozen vicious cuts before he
could disengage himself and flee back down the runway.
<P>
A moment later Carthoris and Thuvia entered the corridor
from the secret chamber.
<P>
"Well, Kar Komak?" asked the Heliumite.
<P>
"It is fortunate that you left me here, red man,"
said the bowman.  "I but just now intercepted one who
seemed over-anxious to reach this door--it was he whom
they call Astok, Prince of Dusar."
<P>
Carthoris smiled.
<P>
"Where is he now?" he asked.
<P>
"He escaped my blade, and ran down this corridor,"
replied Kar Komak.
<P>
"We must lose no time, then!" exclaimed Carthoris.
"He will have the guard upon us yet!"
<P>
Together the three hastened along the winding passages
through which Carthoris and Kar Komak had tracked the
Dusarians by the marks of the latter's sandals in the
thin dust that overspread the floors of these seldom-
used passage-ways.
<P>
They had come to the chamber at the entrances to the
lifts before they met with opposition.  Here they found a
handful of guardsmen, and an officer, who, seeing that
they were strangers, questioned their presence in the
palace of Astok.
<P>
Once more Carthoris and Kar Komak had recourse to
their blades, and before they had won their way to one
of the lifts the noise of the conflict must have aroused
the entire palace, for they heard men shouting, and as
they passed the many levels on their quick passage to
the landing-stage they saw armed men running hither
and thither in search of the cause of the commotion.
<P>
Beside the stage lay the Thuria, with three warriors on guard.
Again the Heliumite and the Lotharian fought shoulder to shoulder,
but the battle was soon over, for the Prince of Helium alone
would have been a match for any three that Dusar could produce.
<P>
Scarce had the Thuria risen from the ways ere a hundred
or more fighting men leaped to view upon the landing-stage.
At their head was Astok of Dusar, and as he saw the two
he had thought so safely in his power slipping from his grasp,
he danced with rage and chagrin, shaking his fists and hurling
abuse and vile insults at them.
<P>
With her bow inclined upward at a dizzy angle, the Thuria
shot meteor-like into the sky.  From a dozen points swift
patrol boats darted after her, for the scene upon the
landing-stage above the palace of the Prince of Dusar
had not gone unnoticed.
<P>
A dozen times shots grazed the Thuria's side, and as
Carthoris could not leave the control levers, Thuvia of
Ptarth turned the muzzles of the craft's rapid-fire guns
upon the enemy as she clung to the steep and slippery
surface of the deck.
<P>
It was a noble race and a noble fight.  One against a score now,
for other Dusarian craft had joined in the pursuit; but Astok,
Prince of Dusar, had built well when he built the Thuria.
None in the navy of his sire possessed a swifter flier;
no other craft so well armoured or so well armed.
<P>
One by one the pursuers were distanced, and as the
last of them fell out of range behind, Carthoris dropped
the Thuria's nose to a horizontal plane, as with lever
drawn to the last notch, she tore through the thin air of
dying Mars toward the east and Ptarth.
<P>
Thirteen and a half thousand haads away lay Ptarth--a
stiff thirty-hour journey for the swiftest of fliers,
and between Dusar and Ptarth might lie half the navy
of Dusar, for in this direction was the reported seat of
the great naval battle that even now might be in progress.
<P>
Could Carthoris have known precisely where the great fleets
of the contending nations lay, he would have hastened
to them without delay, for in the return of Thuvia to
her sire lay the greatest hope of peace.
<P>
Half the distance they covered without sighting a
single warship, and then Kar Komak called Carthoris's
attention to a distant craft that rested upon the ochre
vegetation of the great dead sea-bottom, above which
the Thuria was speeding.
<P>
About the vessel many figures could be seen swarming.
With the aid of powerful glasses, the Heliumite saw that
they were green warriors, and that they were repeatedly
charging down upon the crew of the stranded airship.
The nationality of the latter he could not make out at
so great a distance.
<P>
It was not necessary to change the course of the Thuria
to permit of passing directly above the scene of
battle, but Carthoris dropped his craft a few hundred
feet that he might have a better and closer view.
<P>
If the ship was of a friendly power, he could do no less
than stop and direct his guns upon her enemies, though
with the precious freight he carried he scarcely felt
justified in landing, for he could offer but two swords
in reinforcement--scarce enough to warrant jeopardizing
the safety of the Princess of Ptarth.
<P>
As they came close above the stricken ship, they could
see that it would be but a question of minutes before the
green horde would swarm across the armoured bulwarks to
glut the ferocity of their bloodlust upon the defenders.
<P>
"It would be futile to descend," said Carthoris to Thuvia.
"The craft may even be of Dusar--she shows no insignia.
All that we may do is fire upon the hordesmen";
and as he spoke he stepped to one of the guns and deflected
its muzzle toward the green warriors at the ship's side.
<P>
At the first shot from the Thuria those upon the
vessel below evidently discovered her for the first time.
Immediately a device fluttered from the bow of the
warship on the ground.  Thuvia of Ptarth caught her breath
quickly, glancing at Carthoris.
<P>
The device was that of Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol--
the man to whom the Princess of Ptarth was betrothed!
<P>
How easy for the Heliumite to pass on, leaving his rival
to the fate that could not for long be averted!  No man
could accuse him of cowardice or treachery, for
Kulan Tith was in arms against Helium, and, further,
upon the Thuria were not enough swords to delay even
temporarily the outcome that already was a foregone
conclusion in the minds of the watchers.
<P>
What would Carthoris, Prince of Helium, do?
<P>
Scarce had the device broken to the faint breeze ere the bow
of the Thuria dropped at a sharp angle toward the ground.
<P>
"Can you navigate her?" asked Carthoris of Thuvia.
<P>
The girl nodded.
<P>
"I am going to try to take the survivors aboard," he continued.
"It will need both Kar Komak and myself to man the guns while
the Kaolians take to the boarding tackle.  Keep her bow
depressed against the rifle fire.  She can bear it better
in her forward armour, and at the same time the propellers
will be protected."
<P>
He hurried to the cabin as Thuvia took the control.
A moment later the boarding tackle dropped from the keel
of the Thuria, and from a dozen points along either side
stout, knotted leathern lines trailed downward.
At the same time a signal broke from her bow:
<P>
"Prepare to board us."
<P>
A shout arose from the deck of the Kaolian warship.
Carthoris, who by this time had returned from the cabin,
smiled sadly.  He was about to snatch from the jaws
of death the man who stood between himself and the
woman he loved.
<P>
"Take the port bow gun, Kar Komak," he called to the bowman,
and himself stepped to the gun upon the starboard bow.
<P>
*They could now feel the sharp shock of the explosions
of the green warriors vomited their hail of death and
destruction at the sides of the staunch Thuria.*
[This paragraph needs to be verified from early editions]
<P>
It was a forlorn hope at best.  At any moment the repulsive
ray tanks might be pierced.  The men upon the Kaolian
ship were battling with renewed hope.  In the bow stood
Kulan Tith, a brave figure fighting beside his brave warriors,
beating back the ferocious green men.
<P>
The Thuria came low above the other craft.  The Kaolians
were forming under their officers in readiness to board,
and then a sudden fierce fusillade from the rifles of the
green warriors vomited their hail of death and destruction
into the side of the brave flier.
<P>
Like a wounded bird she dived suddenly Marsward
careening drunkenly.  Thuvia turned the bow upward in an
effort to avert the imminent tragedy, but she succeeded
only in lessening the shock of the flier's impact as she
struck the ground beside the Kaolian ship.
<P>
When the green men saw only two warriors and a
woman upon the deck of the Thuria, a savage shout of
triumph arose from their ranks, while an answering groan
broke from the lips of the Kaolians.
<P>
The former now turned their attention upon the new arrival,
for they saw her defenders could soon be overcome and that
from her deck they could command the deck of the better-manned ship.
<P>
As they charged a shout of warning came from Kulan Tith,
upon the bridge of his own ship, and with it an
appreciation of the valour of the act that had put the
smaller vessel in these sore straits.
<P>
"Who is it," he cried, "that offers his life in the service
of Kulan Tith?  Never was wrought a nobler deed of self-
sacrifice upon Barsoom!"
<P>
The green horde was scrambling over the Thuria's
side as there broke from the bow the device of Carthoris,
Prince of Helium, in reply to the query of the
jeddak of Kaol.  None upon the smaller flier had
opportunity to note the effect of this announcement upon
the Kaolians, for their attention was claimed slowly now by
that which was transpiring upon their own deck.
<P>
Kar Komak stood behind the gun he had been operating,
staring with wide eyes at the onrushing hideous green warriors.
Carthoris, seeing him thus, felt a pang of regret that,
after all, this man that he had thought so valorous should prove,
in the hour of need, as spineless as Jav or Tario.
<P>
"Kar Komak--the man!" he shouted.  "Grip yourself!
Remember the days of the glory of the seafarers of
Lothar.  Fight!  Fight, man!  Fight as never man fought
before.  All that remains to us is to die fighting."
<P>
Kar Komak turned toward the Heliumite, a grim smile upon his lips.
<P>
"Why should we fight," he asked.  "Against such fearful odds?
There is another way--a better way.  Look!"  He pointed toward
the companion-way that led below deck.
<P>
The green men, a handful of them, had already reached
the Thuria's deck, as Carthoris glanced in the
direction the Lotharian had indicated.  The sight that
met his eyes set his heart to thumping in joy and relief
--Thuvia of Ptarth might yet be saved?  For from below
there poured a stream of giant bowmen, grim and terrible. 
Not the bowmen of Tario or Jav, but the bowmen of an
odwar of bowmen--savage fighting men, eager for the fray.
<P>
The green warriors paused in momentary surprise and
consternation, but only for a moment.  Then with horrid
war-cries they leaped forward to meet these strange, new foemen.
<P>
A volley of arrows stopped them in their tracks.
In a moment the only green warriors upon the deck of
the Thuria were dead warriors, and the bowmen of Kar
Komak were leaping over the vessel's sides to charge
the hordesmen upon the ground.
<P>
Utan after utan tumbled from the bowels of the Thuria
to launch themselves upon the unfortunate green men. 
Kulan Tith and his Kaolians stood wide-eyed and
speechless with amazement as they saw thousands of these
strange, fierce warriors emerge from the companion-way
of the small craft that could not comfortably have
accomodated more than fifty.
<P>
At last the green men could withstand the onslaught
of overwhelming numbers no longer.  Slowly, at first,
they fell back across the ochre plain.  The bowmen pursued
them.  Kar Komak, standing upon the deck of the Thuria,
trembled with excitement.
<P>
At the top of his lungs he voiced the savage war-cry
of his forgotten day.  He roared encouragement and
commands at his battling utans, and then, as they charged
further and further from the Thuria, he could no longer
withstand the lure of battle.
<P>
Leaping over the ship's side to the ground, he joined
the last of his bowmen as they raced off over the dead
sea-bottom in pursuit of the fleeing green horde.
<P>
Beyond a low promontory of what once had been an
island the green men were disappearing toward the west.
Close upon their heels raced the fleet bowmen of a bygone day,
and forging steadily ahead among them Carthoris and Thuvia
could see the mighty figure of Kar Komak, brandishing aloft
the Torquasian short-sword with which he was armed, as he
urged his creatures after the retreating enemy.
<P>
As the last of them disappeared behind the promontory,
Carthoris turned toward Thuvia of Ptarth.
<P>
"They have taught me a lesson, these vanishing bowmen
of Lothar," he said.  "When they have served their
purpose they remain not to embarrass their masters by
their presence.  Kulan Tith and his warriors are here
to protect you.  My acts have constituted the proof of
my honesty of purpose.  Good-bye," and he knelt at her
feet, raising a bit of her harness to his lips.
<P>
The girl reached out a hand and laid it upon the thick black
hair of the head bent before her.  Softly she asked:
<P>
"Where are you going, Carthoris?"
<P>
"With Kar Komak, the bowman," he replied.
"There will be fighting and forgetfulness."
<P>
The girl put her hands before her eyes, as though
to shut out some mighty temptation from her sight.
<P>
"May my ancestors have mercy upon me," she cried,
"if I say the thing I have no right to say; but I cannot
see you cast your life away, Carthoris, Prince of Helium! 
Stay, my chieftain.  Stay--I love you!"
<P>
A cough behind them brought both about, and there
they saw standing, not two paces from them Kulan Tith,
Jeddak of Kaol.
<P>
For a long moment none spoke.  Then Kulan Tith cleared his throat.
<P>
"I could not help hearing all that passed," he said.
"I am no fool, to be blind to the love that lies between you.
Nor am I blind to the lofty honour that has caused you,
Carthoris, to risk your life and hers to save mine,
though you thought that that very act would rob you of
the chance to keep her for your own.
<P>
"Nor can I fail to appreciate the virtue that has kept
your lips sealed against words of love for this Heliumite,
Thuvia, for I know that I have but just heard the first
declaration of your passion for him.  I do not condemn you.
Rather should I have condemned you had you entered a
loveless marriage with me.
<P>
"Take back your liberty, Thuvia of Ptarth," he cried,
"and bestow it where your heart already lies enchained,
and when the golden collars are clasped about your necks
you will see that Kulan Tith's is the first sword to be
raised in declaration of eternal friendship for the new
Princess of Helium and her royal mate!"
