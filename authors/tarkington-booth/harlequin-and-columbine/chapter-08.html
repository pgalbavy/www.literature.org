<p>With this sonorous bit of character reading still ringing in
his ears, Canby emerged from the cream-coloured apartment to find
the stoop-shouldered figure of the also hypocritical son leaning
wearily against the wall, waiting for a delaying elevator. The
attitude was not wholly devoid of pathos, to Canby's view of it.
Neither was the careworn, harried face, unharmoniously topped
by a green hat so sparklingly jaunty, not only in colour but in
its shape and the angle of its perch, that it was outright hilarious,
and, above the face of Packer, made the playwright think pityingly
of a St. Patrick's Day party holding a noisy celebration upon
a hearse.</p>

<p>Its wearer nodded solemnly as the elevator bounced up, flashing,
and settled to the level of the floor; but the quick drop through
the long shaft seemed to do the stage-manager a disproportionate
amount of good. Halfway down he emitted a heavy "Whew!" of relief
and threw back his shoulders. He seemed to swell, to grow larger;
lines verged into the texture of his face, disappearing; and with
them went care and seeming years. Canby had casually taken him
to be about forty, but so radical was the transformation of him
that, as the distance from his harrowing overlord increased, the
playwright beheld another kind of creature. In place of the placative,
middle-aged varlet, troubled and hurrying to serve, there stepped
out of the elevator, at the street level, a deep-chested, assertive,
manly adventurer, about thirty, kindly eyed, picturesque, and
careless. The green hat belonged to him perfectly.</p>

<p>He gave Canby a look of burlesque ruefulness over his shoulder,
the comedy appeal of one schoolboy to another as they leave a
scolding teacher on the far side of the door. "The governor does
keep himself worked up!" he laughed, as they reached the street
and paused. "If it isn't one thing, it's some thing!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's my play just now," said Canby. "I was afraid, earlier
this evening, he meant to drop it. Making so many changes may
have upset his nerves."</p>

<p>"Lord bless your soul! No!" exclaimed the new Packer. "His nerves
are all right! He's always the same! He can't help it!"</p>

<p>"I thought possibly he might have been more upset than usual,"
Canby said. "There was a critic or something that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, Mr. Canby!" Packer chuckled. "New plays and critics,
they don't worry him any more than anything else. Of course he
isn't going to be pleased with any critics. Most of them give
him splendid notices, but they don't please him. How could they?"</p>

<p>"He's always the same, you think?" Canby said blankly.</p>

<p>"Always&mdash;always at top pitch, that is, and always unexpected.
You'll see as you get to know him. You won't know him any better
than you do now, Mr. Canby; you'll only know him more. I've been
with him for four years&mdash;stage-manager&mdash;hired man&mdash;maid-of-all-work&mdash;order
his meals for him in hotels&mdash;and I guess old Tinker and I know
him as well as anybody does, but it's a mighty big job to handle
him just right. It keeps us hopping, but that's bread and butter.
Not much bread and butter anywhere these days unless you do hop!
We all have to hop for somebody!" He chuckled again, and then
unexpectedly became so serious he was almost truculent. "And I
tell you, Mr. Canby," he cried, "by George! I'd sooner hop for
Talbot Potter than for any other man that ever walked the earth!"</p>

<p>He took a yellow walking-stick from under his arm, thrust the
manuscript Potter had given him into the pocket of his light overcoat,
and bade his companion good-night with a genial flourish of the
stick. "Subway to Brooklyn for mine. Your play will go, all right;
don't worry about that, Mr. Canby. Good-night and good luck, Mr.
Canby."</p>

<p>Canby went the other way, marvelling.</p>

<p>It was eleven; and for half an hour the theatres had been releasing
their audiences to the streets;&mdash;the sidewalks were bobbing and
fluttering; automobiles cometed by bleating peevishly. Suddenly,
through the window of a limousine, brilliantly lighted within,
Canby saw the face of Wanda Malone, laughing, and embowered in
white furs. He stopped, startled; then he realized that Wanda
Malone's hair was not red. The girl in the limousine had red hair,
and was altogether unlike Wanda Malone in feature and expression.</p>

<p>He walked on angrily.</p>

<p>Immediately a slender girl, prettily dressed, passed him. She
clung charmingly to the arm of a big boy; and to Canby's first
glance she was Wanda Malone. Wrenching his eyes from her, he saw
Wanda Malone across the street getting into a taxicab, and then
he stumbled out of the way of a Wanda Malone who almost walked
into him. Wherever there was a graceful gesture or turn of the
head, there was Wanda Malone.</p>

<p>He wheeled, and walked back toward Broadway, and thought he caught
a glimpse of Packer going into a crowded drug-store near the corner.
The man he took to be Packer lifted his hat and spoke to a girl
who was sitting at a table and drinking soda-water, but when she
looked up and seemed to be Wanda Malone with a blue veil down
to her nose, Canby turned on his heel, face-about, and headed
violently for home.</p>

<p>When he reached quieter streets his gait slackened, and he walked
slowly, lost in deep reverie. By and by he came to a halt, and
stood still for several minutes without knowing it. Slowly he
came out of the trance, wondering where he was. Then he realized
that his staring eyes had halted him automatically; and as they
finally conveyed their information to his conscious mind, he perceived
that he was standing directly in front of a saloon, and glaring
at the sign upon the window:</p>

<p><em>ALES WINES LIQUORS AND CIGARS</em></p>

<p><em>TIM MALONE</em></p>

<p>At that, somewhere in his inside, he cried out, in a kind of
anguish: "Isn't there anything&mdash;anywhere&mdash;any more&mdash;except Wanda
Malone!"</p>
