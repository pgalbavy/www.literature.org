"And Heaven's rich instincts in him grew<br/>
As effortless as woodland nooks<br/>
Send violets up and paint them blue."<br/>
&mdash;<em>LOWELL</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>I do not mean to recount all the little troubles and annoyances
which thronged upon Tom at the beginning of this half-year, in
his new character of bear-leader to a gentle little boy straight
from home. He seemed to himself to have become a new boy again,
without any of the long-suffering and meekness indispensable for
supporting that character with moderate success. From morning
till night he had the feeling of responsibility on his mind, and
even if he left Arthur in their study or in the close for an hour,
was never at ease till he had him in sight again. He waited for
him at the doors of the school after every lesson and every calling-over;
watched that no tricks were played him, and none but the regulation
questions asked; kept his eye on his plate at dinner and breakfast,
to see that no unfair depredations were made upon his viands;
in short, as East remarked, cackled after him like a hen with
one chick.</p>

<p>Arthur took a long time thawing, too, which made it all the harder
work; was sadly timid; scarcely ever spoke unless Tom spoke to
him first; and, worst of all, would agree with him in everything&mdash;the
hardest thing in the world for a Brown to bear. He got quite angry
sometimes, as they sat together of a night in their study, at
this provoking habit of agreement, and was on the point of breaking
out a dozen times with a lecture upon the propriety of a fellow
having a will of his own and speaking out, but managed to restrain
himself by the thought that he might only frighten Arthur, and
the remembrance of the lesson he had learnt from him on his first
night at Number 4. Then he would resolve to sit still and not
say a word till Arthur began; but he was always beat at that game,
and had presently to begin talking in despair, fearing lest Arthur
might think he was vexed at something if he didn't, and dog-tired
of sitting tongue-tied.</p>

<p>It was hard work. But Tom had taken it up, and meant to stick
to it, and go through with it so as to satisfy himself; in which
resolution he was much assisted by the chafing of East and his
other old friends, who began to call him "dry-nurse," and otherwise
to break their small wit on him. But when they took other ground,
as they did every now and then, Tom was sorely puzzled.</p>

<p>"Tell you what, Tommy," East would say; "you'll spoil young Hopeful
with too much coddling. Why can't you let him go about by himself
and find his own level? He'll never be worth a button if you go
on keeping him under your skirts."</p>

<p>"Well, but he ain't fit to fight his own way yet; I'm trying
to get him to it every day, but he's very odd. Poor little beggar!
I can't make him out a bit. He ain't a bit like anything I've
ever seen or heard of&mdash;he seems all over nerves; anything you
say seems to hurt him like a cut or a blow."</p>

<p>"That sort of boy's no use here," said East; "he'll only spoil.
Now I'll tell you what to do, Tommy. Go and get a nice large band-box
made, and put him in with plenty of cotton-wool and a pap-bottle,
labelled 'With care&mdash;this side up,' and send him back to mamma."</p>

<p>"I think I shall make a hand of him though," said Tom, smiling,
"say what you will. There's something about him, every now and
then, which shows me he's got pluck somewhere in him. That's the
only thing after all that'll wash, ain't it, old Scud? But how
to get at it and bring it out?"</p>

<p>Tom took one hand out of his breeches-pocket and stuck it in
his back hair for a scratch, giving his hat a tilt over his nose,
his one method of invoking wisdom. He stared at the ground with
a ludicrously puzzled look, and presently looked up and met East's
eyes. That young gentleman slapped him on the back, and then put
his arm round his shoulder, as they strolled through the quadrangle
together. "Tom," said he, "blest if you ain't the best old fellow
ever was. I do like to see you go into a thing. Hang it, I wish
I could take things as you do; but I never can get higher than
a joke. Everything's a joke. If I was going to be flogged next
minute, I should be in a blue funk, but I couldn't help laughing
at it for the life of me."</p>

<p>"Brown and East, you go and fag for Jones on the great fives
court."</p>

<p>"Hullo, though, that's past a joke," broke out East, springing
at the young gentleman who addressed them, and catching him by
the collar.&mdash;"Here, Tommy, catch hold of him t'other side before
he can holla."</p>

<p>The youth was seized, and dragged, struggling, out of the quadrangle
into the School-house hall. He was one of the miserable little
pretty white-handed, curly-headed boys, petted and pampered by
some of the big fellows, who wrote their verses for them, taught
them to drink and use bad language, and did all they could to
spoil them for everything * in this world and the next. One of
the avocations in which these young gentlemen took particular
delight was in going about and getting fags for their protectors,
when those heroes were playing any game. They carried about pencil
and paper with them, putting down the names of all the boys they
sent, always sending five times as many as were wanted, and getting
all those thrashed who didn't go. The present youth belonged to
a house which was very jealous of the School-house, and always
picked out School-house fags when he could find them. However,
this time he'd got the wrong sow by the ear. His captors slammed
the great door of the hall, and East put his back against it,
while Tom gave the prisoner a shake up, took away his list, and
stood him up on the floor, while he proceeded leisurely to examine
that document.</p>

<p>
* A kind and wise critic, an old Rugboean, notes here in the<br/>
margin: "The small friend system was not so utterly bad from<br/>
1841-1847." Before that, too, there were many noble<br/>
friendships between big and little boys; but I can't strike<br/>
out the passage. Many boys will know why it is left in.

</p>
</div>
<p>"Let me out, let me go!" screamed the boy, in a furious passion.
"I'll go and tell Jones this minute, and he'll give you both the
&mdash;- thrashing you ever had."</p>

<p>"Pretty little dear," said East, patting the top of his hat.&mdash;"Hark
how he swears, Tom. Nicely brought up young man, ain't he, I don't
think."</p>

<p>"Let me alone, &mdash;- you," roared the boy, foaming with rage, and
kicking at East, who quietly tripped him up, and deposited him
on the floor in a place of safety.</p>

<p>"Gently, young fellow," said he; "'tain't improving for little
whippersnappers like you to be indulging in blasphemy; so you
stop that, or you'll get something you won't like."</p>

<p>"I'll have you both licked when I get out, that I will," rejoined
the boy, beginning to snivel.</p>

<p>"Two can play at that game, mind you," said Tom, who had finished
his examination of the list. "Now you just listen here. We've
just come across the fives court, and Jones has four fags there
already&mdash;two more than he wants. If he'd wanted us to change,
he'd have stopped us himself. And here, you little blackguard,
you've got seven names down on your list besides ours, and five
of them School-house." Tom walked up to him, and jerked him on
to his legs; he was by this time whining like a whipped puppy.
"Now just listen to me. We ain't going to fag for Jones. If you
tell him you've sent us, we'll each of us give you such a thrashing
as you'll remember." And Tom tore up the list and threw the pieces
into the fire.</p>

<p>"And mind you, too," said East, "don't let me catch you again
sneaking about the School-house, and picking up our fags. You
haven't got the sort of hide to take a sound licking kindly."
And he opened the door and sent the young gentleman flying into
the quadrangle with a parting kick.</p>

<p>"Nice boy, Tommy," said East, shoving his hands in his pockets,
and strolling to the fire.</p>

<p>"Worst sort we breed," responded Tom, following his example.
"Thank goodness, no big fellow ever took to petting me."</p>

<p>"You'd never have been like that," said East. "I should like
to have put him in a museum: Christian young gentleman, nineteenth
century, highly educated. Stir him up with a long pole, Jack,
and hear him swear like a drunken sailor. He'd make a respectable
public open its eyes, I think."</p>

<p>"Think he'll tell Jones?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"No," said East. "Don't care if he does."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Tom. And they went back to talk about Arthur.</p>

<p>The young gentleman had brains enough not to tell Jones, reasoning
that East and Brown, who were noted as some of the toughest fags
in the School, wouldn't care three straws for any licking Jones
might give them, and would be likely to keep their words as to
passing it on with interest.</p>

<p>After the above conversation, East came a good deal to their
study, and took notice of Arthur, and soon allowed to Tom that
he was a thorough little gentleman, and would get over his shyness
all in good time; which much comforted our hero. He felt every
day, too, the value of having an object in his life&mdash;something
that drew him out of himself; and it being the dull time of the
year, and no games going about for which he much cared, was happier
than he had ever yet been at school, which was saying a great
deal.</p>

<p>The time which Tom allowed himself away from his charge was from
locking-up till supper-time. During this hour or hour and a half
he used to take his fling, going round to the studies of all his
acquaintance, sparring or gossiping in the hall, now jumping the
old iron-bound tables, or carving a bit of his name on them, then
joining in some chorus of merry voices&mdash;in fact, blowing off his
steam, as we should now call it.</p>

<p>This process was so congenial to his temper, and Arthur showed
himself so pleased at the arrangement, that it was several weeks
before Tom was ever in their study before supper. One evening,
however, he rushed in to look for an old chisel, or some corks,
or other article essential to his pursuit for the time being,
and while rummaging about in the cupboards, looked up for a moment,
and was caught at once by the figure of poor little Arthur. The
boy was sitting with his elbows on the table, and his head leaning
on his hands, and before him an open book, on which his tears
were falling fast. Tom shut the door at once, and sat down on
the sofa by Arthur, putting his arm round his neck.</p>

<p>"Why, young un, what's the matter?" said he kindly; "you ain't
unhappy, are you?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Brown," said the little boy, looking up with the great
tears in his eyes; "you are so kind to me, I'm very happy."</p>

<p>"Why don't you call me Tom? Lots of boys do that I don't like
half so much as you. What are you reading, then? Hang it! you
must come about with me, and not mope yourself." And Tom cast
down his eyes on the book, and saw it was the Bible. He was silent
for a minute, and thought to himself, "Lesson Number 2, Tom Brown;"
and then said gently, "I'm very glad to see this, Arthur, and
ashamed that I don't read the Bible more myself. Do you read it
every night before supper while I'm out?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you'd wait till afterwards, and then we'd read
together. But, Arthur, why does it make you cry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't that I'm unhappy. But at home, while my father
was alive, we always read the lessons after tea; and I love to
read them over now, and try to remember what he said about them.
I can't remember all and I think I scarcely understand a great
deal of what I do remember. But it all comes back to me so fresh
that I can't help crying sometimes to think I shall never read
them again with him."</p>

<p>Arthur had never spoken of his home before, and Tom hadn't encouraged
him to do so, as his blundering schoolboy reasoning made him think
that Arthur would be softened and less manly for thinking of home.
But now he was fairly interested, and forgot all about chisels
and bottled beer; while with very little encouragement Arthur
launched into his home history, and the prayer-bell put them both
out sadly when it rang to call them to the hall.</p>

<p>From this time Arthur constantly spoke of his home, and above
all, of his father, who had been dead about a year, and whose
memory Tom soon got to love and reverence almost as much as his
own son did.</p>

<p>Arthur's father had been the clergyman of a parish in the Midland
counties, which had risen into a large town during the war, and
upon which the hard years which followed had fallen with fearful
weight. The trade had been half ruined; and then came the old,
sad story, of masters reducing their establishments, men turned
off and wandering about, hungry and wan in body, and fierce in
soul, from the thought of wives and children starving at home,
and the last sticks of furniture going to the pawnshop; children
taken from school, and lounging about the dirty streets and courts,
too listless almost to play, and squalid in rags and misery; and
then the fearful struggle between the employers and men&mdash;lowerings
of wages, strikes, and the long course of oft-repeated crime,
ending every now and then with a riot, a fire, and the county
yeomanry. There is no need here to dwell upon such tales: the
Englishman into whose soul they have not sunk deep is not worthy
the name. You English boys, for whom this book is meant (God bless
your bright faces and kind hearts!), will learn it all soon enough.</p>

<p>Into such a parish and state of society Arthur's father had been
thrown at the age of twenty-five&mdash;a young married parson, full
of faith, hope, and love. He had battled with it like a man, and
had lots of fine Utopian ideas about the perfectibility of mankind,
glorious humanity, and such-like, knocked out of his head, and
a real, wholesome Christian love for the poor, struggling, sinning
men, of whom he felt himself one, and with and for whom he spent
fortune, and strength, and life, driven into his heart. He had
battled like a man, and gotten a man's reward&mdash;no silver tea-pots
or salvers, with flowery inscriptions setting forth his virtues
and the appreciation of a genteel parish; no fat living or stall,
for which he never looked, and didn't care; no sighs and praises
of comfortable dowagers and well-got-up young women, who worked
him slippers, sugared his tea, and adored him as "a devoted man;"
but a manly respect, wrung from the unwilling souls of men who
fancied his order their natural enemies; the fear and hatred of
every one who was false or unjust in the district, were he master
or man; and the blessed sight of women and children daily becoming
more human and more homely, a comfort to themselves and to their
husbands and fathers.</p>

<p>These things, of course, took time, and had to be fought for
with toil and sweat of brain and heart, and with the life-blood
poured out. All that, Arthur had laid his account to give, and
took as a matter of course, neither pitying himself, nor looking
on himself as a martyr, when he felt the wear and tear making
him feel old before his time, and the stifling air of fever-dens
telling on his health. His wife seconded him in everything. She
had been rather fond of society, and much admired and run after
before her marriage; and the London world to which she had belonged
pitied poor Fanny Evelyn when she married the young clergyman,
and went to settle in that smoky hole Turley; a very nest of Chartism
and Atheism, in a part of the country which all the decent families
had had to leave for years. However, somehow or other she didn't
seem to care. If her husband's living had been amongst green fields
and near pleasant neighbours she would have liked it better&mdash;that
she never pretended to deny. But there they were. The air wasn't
bad, after all; the people were very good sort of people&mdash;civil
to you if you were civil to them, after the first brush; and they
didn't expect to work miracles, and convert them all off-hand
into model Christians. So he and she went quietly among the folk,
talking to and treating them just as they would have done people
of their own rank. They didn't feel that they were doing anything
out of the common way, and so were perfectly natural, and had
none of that condescension or consciousness of manner which so
outrages the independent poor. And thus they gradually won respect
and confidence; and after sixteen years he was looked up to by
the whole neighbourhood as the just man, the man to whom masters
and men could go in their strikes, and in all their quarrels and
difficulties, and by whom the right and true word would be said
without fear or favour. And the women had come round to take her
advice, and go to her as a friend in all their troubles; while
the children all worshipped the very ground she trod on.</p>

<p>They had three children, two daughters and a son, little Arthur,
who came between his sisters. He had been a very delicate boy
from his childhood; they thought he had a tendency to consumption,
and so he had been kept at home and taught by his father, who
had made a companion of him, and from whom he had gained good
scholarship, and a knowledge of and interest in many subjects
which boys in general never come across till they are many years
older.</p>

<p>Just as he reached his thirteenth year, and his father had settled
that he was strong enough to go to school, and, after much debating
with himself, had resolved to send him there, a desperate typhus
fever broke out in the town. Most of the other clergy, and almost
all the doctors, ran away; the work fell with tenfold weight on
those who stood to their work. Arthur and his wife both caught
the fever, of which he died in a few days; and she recovered,
having been able to nurse him to the end, and store up his last
words. He was sensible to the last, and calm and happy, leaving
his wife and children with fearless trust for a few years in the
hands of the Lord and Friend who had lived and died for him, and
for whom he, to the best of his power, had lived and died. His
widow's mourning was deep and gentle. She was more affected by
the request of the committee of a freethinking club, established
in the town by some of the factory hands (which he had striven
against with might and main, and nearly suppressed), that some
of their number might be allowed to help bear the coffin, than
by anything else. Two of them were chosen, who, with six other
labouring men, his own fellow-workmen and friends, bore him to
his grave&mdash;a man who had fought the Lord's fight even unto the
death. The shops were closed and the factories shut that day in
the parish, yet no master stopped the day's wages; but for many
a year afterwards the townsfolk felt the want of that brave, hopeful,
loving parson and his wife, who had lived to teach them mutual
forbearance and helpfulness, and had almost at last given them
a glimpse of what this old world would be if people would live
for God and each other instead of for themselves.</p>

<p>What has all this to do with our story? Well, my dear boys, let
a fellow go on his own way, or you won't get anything out of him
worth having. I must show you what sort of a man it was who had
begotten and trained little Arthur, or else you won't believe
in him, which I am resolved you shall do; and you won't see how
he, the timid, weak boy, had points in him from which the bravest
and strongest recoiled, and made his presence and example felt
from the first on all sides, unconsciously to himself, and without
the least attempt at proselytizing. The spirit of his father was
in him, and the Friend to whom his father had left him did not
neglect the trust.</p>

<p>After supper that night, and almost nightly for years afterwards,
Tom and Arthur, and by degrees East occasionally, and sometimes
one, sometimes another, of their friends, read a chapter of the
Bible together, and talked it over afterwards. Tom was at first
utterly astonished, and almost shocked, at the sort of way in
which Arthur read the book and talked about the men and women
whose lives were there told. The first night they happened to
fall on the chapters about the famine in Egypt, and Arthur began
talking about Joseph as if he were a living statesman&mdash;just as
he might have talked about Lord Grey and the Reform Bill, only
that they were much more living realities to him. The book was
to him, Tom saw, the most vivid and delightful history of real
people, who might do right or wrong, just like any one who was
walking about in Rugby&mdash;the Doctor, or the masters, or the sixth-form
boys. But the astonishment soon passed off, the scales seemed
to drop from his eyes, and the book became at once and for ever
to him the great human and divine book, and the men and women,
whom he had looked upon as something quite different from himself,
became his friends and counsellors.</p>

<p>For our purposes, however, the history of one night's reading
will be sufficient, which must be told here, now we are on the
subject, though it didn't happen till a year afterwards, and long
after the events recorded in the next chapter of our story.</p>

<p>Arthur, Tom, and East were together one night, and read the story
of Naaman coming to Elisha to be cured of his leprosy. When the
chapter was finished, Tom shut his Bible with a slap.</p>

<p>"I can't stand that fellow Naaman," said he, "after what he'd
seen and felt, going back and bowing himself down in the house
of Rimmon, because his effeminate scoundrel of a master did it.
I wonder Elisha took the trouble to heal him. How he must have
despised him!"</p>

<p>"Yes; there you go off as usual, with a shell on your head,"
struck in East, who always took the opposite side to Tom, half
from love of argument, half from conviction. "How do you know
he didn't think better of it? How do you know his master was a
scoundrel? His letter don't look like it, and the book don't say
so."</p>

<p>"I don't care," rejoined Tom; "why did Naaman talk about bowing
down, then, if he didn't mean to do it? He wasn't likely to get
more in earnest when he got back to court, and away from the prophet."</p>

<p>"Well, but, Tom," said Arthur, "look what Elisha says to him&mdash;'Go
in peace.' He wouldn't have said that if Naaman had been in the
wrong."</p>

<p>"I don't see that that means more than saying, 'You're not the
man I took you for.'"</p>

<p>"No, no; that won't do at all," said East. "Read the words fairly,
and take men as you find them. I like Naaman, and think he was
a very fine fellow."</p>

<p>"I don't," said Tom positively.</p>

<p>"Well, I think East is right," said Arthur; "I can't see but
what it's right to do the best you can, though it mayn't be the
best absolutely. Every man isn't born to be a martyr."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," said East; "but he's on one of his pet
hobbies. &mdash;How often have I told you, Tom, that you must
drive a nail where it'll go."</p>

<p>"And how often have I told you," rejoined Tom, "that it'll always
go where you want, if you only stick to it and hit hard enough.
I hate half-measures and compromises."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's a whole-hog man, is Tom. Must have the whole animal-hair
and teeth, claws and tail," laughed East. "Sooner have no bread
any day than half the loaf."</p>

<p>"I don't know;" said Arthur&mdash;"it's rather puzzling; but ain't
most right things got by proper compromises &mdash;I mean where
the principle isn't given up?"</p>

<p>"That's just the point," said Tom; "I don't object to a compromise,
where you don't give up your principle."</p>

<p>"Not you," said East laughingly.&mdash;"I know him of old, Arthur,
and you'll find him out some day. There isn't such a reasonable
fellow in the world, to hear him talk. He never wants anything
but what's right and fair; only when you come to settle what's
right and fair, it's everything that he wants, and nothing that
you want. And that's his idea of a compromise. Give me the Brown
compromise when I'm on his side."</p>

<p>"Now, Harry," said Tom, "no more chaff. I'm serious. Look here.
This is what makes my blood tingle." And he turned over the pages
of his Bible and read, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered
and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to
answer thee in this matter. If it be so, our God whom we serve
is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will
deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known
unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship
the golden image which thou hast set up." He read the last verse
twice, emphasizing the nots, and dwelling on them as if they gave
him actual pleasure, and were hard to part with.</p>

<p>They were silent a minute, and then Arthur said, "Yes, that's
a glorious story, but it don't prove your point, Tom, I think.
There are times when there is only one way, and that the highest,
and then the men are found to stand in the breach."</p>

<p>"There's always a highest way, and it's always the right one,"
said Tom. "How many times has the Doctor told us that in his sermons
in the last year, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Well, you ain't going to convince us&mdash;is he, Arthur? No Brown
compromise to-night," said East, looking at his watch. "But it's
past eight, and we must go to first lesson. What a bore!"</p>

<p>So they took down their books and fell to work; but Arthur didn't
forget, and thought long and often over the conversation.</p>
