<p>How it all happened was never clearly established, but it is
not to be supposed that in the tumult, the swirl, the confusion,
the firing, shouting and dashing to and fro, that the coolest-headed
Shawanoe or most self-possessed ranger could any more than keep
a general idea of the hurricane rush of events. Special incidents
were noted by different persons, as the circumstances favored
them, while others saw and knew nothing of what took place under
their very eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Ashbridge hurried down the wooded slope in the gloom,
each holding a hand of Mabel between them. At the side of the
flatboat, where there were crowding in increased excitement, the
parents released the child, and the father turned to help in the
defence against the Indians, who immediately attacked them. Mabel
entered the boat near the bow, and had crouched there several
minutes, in obedience to the order of the missionary, to avoid
the bullets that were whistling about, when the idea seized her
that there were much better quarters at the stern, where the pushing
was less.</p>

<p>The best way, as it struck her, to reach the spot, was by bounding
ashore and darting the few paces thither. She made the attempt,
and was in the act of leaping back when her arm was gripped by
a warrior, who hurried her from the spot.</p>

<p>Although bewildered and partly dazed by the rush of events, the
child resisted and screamed for help, but she was powerless in
the hands of the sinewy savage, who forced her from the edge of
the river.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, that in addition to the confusion it was
night, and the partial moon in the sky was obscured at intervals
by passing clouds. Beside, among the shadows of the wood the gloom
was so deepened that the wonder is, not that none of Mabel's friends
saw her capture but that Simon Kenton observed it.</p>

<p>He did so a minute later, and knew at once that the little one,
if saved at all, must be saved instantly. He cleared most of the
intervening space with his tremendous bound, and made for the
Shawanoe like a cyclone. He had noted the point where the warrior
had passed from view, as well as the general direction taken by
him; consequently a quick dash in the right course ought to overtake
him.</p>

<p>Such was the dash made by the ranger, at the imminent risk of
colliding with tree-trunks, limbs, and boulders, and with the
result that within twenty feet of the river he ran plump against
the Indian who had the terrified child in charge, and with no
suspicion of his furious pursuer.</p>

<p>The attack of the Bengal tiger upon the hunter that is throttling
its whining cubs, is no fiercer, more resistless and lightning-like,
than was the assault of Simon Kenton upon the buck that was making
off with the little daughter of Norman Ashbridge.</p>

<p>It mattered not that the gloom was well-nigh impenetrable, and
the eye could not direct or follow the blow. The ranger knew he
had his man in his grasp, and within a few seconds the affair
was over.</p>

<p>Had there been only the slightest illumination of the wood at
this point to aid the eye, the rescue of Mabel would have been
effected, but she knew not the meaning of the terrific struggle,
and the instant her captor loosened his grip upon her arm, so
as to defend himself, she hurried off in the gloom in the hope
of joining her friends on the flatboat.</p>

<p>"I say, gal, where be you?" called Kenton, grasping with one
hand, and expecting every moment to touch her form.</p>

<p>But the little one heard him not, or if she did, had no suspicion
of his identity, and a few moments only convinced the ranger that
the child once within his grasp was gone again, he knew not where.</p>

<p>He held a strong hope, however, that she had started on her return
for the boat from which she had been taken in such hot haste by
her abductor. If so, the attempt on her part offered a chance
of saving her if the ranger moved promptly; for, by hastening
to the same point he was sure to meet her, even though amid enemies;
but, if he delayed, she must inevitably fall into the hands of
the Shawanoes again.</p>

<p>It was apparent to Kenton that none of those on the boat were
aware of the loss of the child, and if it became known to her
friends they could give her no help. The ranger was fortunate,
indeed, that in the flurry he was not assaulted in turn by some
of the hostiles.</p>

<p>He picked his way as best he could to the river's margin, carefully
keeping himself back in the gloom while he made his observation.
The moon was still unobstructed, and showed him the flatboat fifty
feet away and increasing the space every minute.</p>

<p>Thus it came about, that as the craft was laboriously worked
into mid-stream and towards the Ohio shore, two of the whites
were left behind amid the merciless members of The Panther's band.</p>

<p>The situation was of little moment to Simon Kenton, for more
than once he had been in a situation of much greater peril. He
felt abundantly able to take care of himself, his great concern
being for the little one to whom fate had been so cruel.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as there was not one chance in a thousand of accomplishing
anything by groping in the gloom among the trees, he adopted the
single course that promised success, and that was only to a slight
degree indeed.</p>

<p>The flatboat was now so far out in the river that the firing
had ceased on both sides. Kenton did not know to what extent his
friends had suffered, but he was certain that in addition to the
warrior whom he had picked off in time to save Jethro Juggens,
several others must have gone down in the fusilade.</p>

<p>When The Panther brought his band together to effect the ambuscade
at Rattlesnake Gulch, he must have established some sort of camp
or headquarters beyond that point, where it could not be noted
by the fugitives until on the other side of the dangerous section.
Hoping, with a shudder of misgiving, that the little child would
be taken to this camp instead of being tomahawked, he began searching
for it.</p>

<p>The task was less difficult than would be supposed. A veteran
like Kenton had no trouble in avoiding the warriors moving about.
As he expected, he passed but a short distance beyond the gulch,
when he caught the twinkle of the campfire just beyond the hollow
in which the Shawanoes had arranged to blot out the whole company
of settlers and pioneers.</p>

<p>Carefully threading his way through the undergrowth and among
the trees, he reached a point from which he gained an unobstructed
view of the camp without any risk of discovery on his part. The
scene in many respects resembled that which he had looked upon
times without number.</p>

<p>There was the fire of sticks and branches that had been burning
several hours, for it contained many glowing embers, in the middle
of an open space. A circle of diminishing light was thrown out
several rods in all directions. Upon a fallen tree, on the other
side of the blaze, sat three warriors, painted and decked in the
hideous manner adopted by the people when upon the war-path. Armed
with rifles, tomahawks and knives, they were talking excitedly,
and one had just had his wounded arm bandaged, proving that he
failed to go through the battle unscathed.</p>

<p>Two other Shawanoes were standing at the right of the fire, also
talking with great animation. Further back, where the light was
less, were others, most of them seated on the ground. Kenton's
scrutiny satisfied him that more than one of these had been "hit
hard," and their companions were looking after them as best they
could.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen of those that had fallen, though the American
Indian is not the one to forget his stricken comrade, and the
warriors that had started on their journey to the happy hunting
grounds were certain to receive due attention. As nearly as the
spy could judge there were from twelve to fifteen Shawanoes in
camp. Since Boone had reported the party as about double that
number, several of them&mdash;not counting those that had fallen&mdash;were
still absent.</p>

<p>The ranger was profoundly interested in two of these absentees.
One was little Mabel Ashbridge, and the other The Panther, leader
of the Shawanoes. The closest scrutiny failed to reveal either
of them, and though he had no real cause for doing so, he could
not help connecting their absence with each other.</p>

<p>His suspicion proved right, for only a few minutes passed when
two figures strode from the gloom into the firelight. One was
Wa-on-mon, whose hand gripped the arm of the young captive. He
walked at a moderate pace to the fallen tree, where he motioned
to Mabel to take her seat. She obeyed with the same promptness
she would have shown had the command come from her father or mother.</p>

<p>The Panther remained standing, and the three who had been seated
on the log also rose and advanced, several others drawing near
and taking part in the conversation.</p>

<p>"Ah!" muttered Kenton, between his set teeth, with his flashing
eyes fixed upon The Panther, "if I could only have come 'cross
you and the little gal!"</p>

<p>Seated with the firelight falling upon her face, the ranger was
able to see it quite plainly. She had lost the cute little homemade
cap in the flurry, and her luxuriant hair hung loosely about her
shoulder. She was neatly clad in homespun, though the dress, the
stockings, and the shoes were of coarse texture.</p>

<p>The countenance wore the scared expression which showed that
the child suspected her dreadful peril. The marks of weeping were
noticed, but the ferocious Wa-on-mon had probably terrified her
to that extent that she was forced to deny herself the relief
of tears. Resting on the fallen tree, with her dimpled hands clasped,
she hardly removed her eyes from the chieftain and his immediate
companions. She appeared to feel they were about to decide her
fate.</p>

<p>From his concealment, not far off, Kenton allowed nothing in
his field of vision to escape him. He could not catch a word uttered
by the Shawanoes, but he did not believe the chief was discussing
with his warriors the question of what should be done with the
little captive, for the reason that it was not his habit to debate
such matters with his followers. His rule was so absolute that
he made his own decisions, leaving to others to obey or take the
consequences.</p>

<p>It was more probable that The Panther was seeking the views of
his followers on what was the best step to prevent the fugitives
from reaching the block-house, now that they had escaped the ambuscade
that had been set for them.</p>

<p>While the ranger held his position he did a deal of thinking.
The problem that wholly interested him was, as to what could be
done to save the child, for that she was doomed by her captors,
sooner or later, to death, he considered as certain as he did
his own existence. It simply remained to be decided when she should
be sacrificed.</p>

<p>Kenton was too much of a veteran to attempt anything rash. Had
Mabel been an adult, on the alert for something of the kind, possibly
he might have warned her of his presence without revealing himself
to the captors, but it would have been fatal folly to try to effect
an understanding with her.</p>

<p>He asked himself whether he could steal up behind the log, and
then, by a sudden dash, seize and make off with her. There were
a few minutes when he was much inclined to make the venture, but
the more he reflected the more hopeless did the chances of success
appear.</p>

<p>He could not run fast in the darkness among the trees, and burdened
with the care of Mabel, The Panther and half a dozen warriors
would be upon him by the time he was fairly started, with the
absolute result that child and would-be rescuer would not live
ten minutes.</p>

<p>"There's one thing powerful sartin'," muttered Kenton, keeping
his eye upon the party, "if they decide that the gal shall be
sent under while she's setting there on that log, the first move
to harm a hair of her head means death to him as tries it."</p>

<p>So it would have been. The silent, sinewy figure, standing as
rigid and motionless as the tree-trunk which sheltered him, let
nothing escape him. Had The Panther, or any of his warriors, turned
toward Mabel Ashbridge with hostile intent, he would have fallen
forward with a bullet through heart or brain before he could have
raised his hand to do evil.</p>

<p>The night wore along, with more hostiles returning at intervals,
and still the discussion continued between the chieftain and his
warriors. It was a puzzle to Kenton why the talk should continue
so long, for to him there was nothing in the situation to cause
much variance of opinion.</p>

<p>The ranger was still watching and wondering, when from the gloom
of the wood another party strode into view, and walked up to the
group gathered about The Panther, and, as he did so, it would
be hard to decide whether they or Simon Kenton were filled with
the greater amazement over the unexpected occurrence.</p>
