Next day brought the Admiral a cheque for L5,000 from
Mr. McAdam, and a stamped agreement by which he made over
his pension papers to the speculative investor.  It
was not until he had signed and sent it off that the full
significance of all that he had done broke upon him.  He
had sacrificed everything.  His pension was gone.  He had
nothing save only what he could earn.  But the stout old
heart never quailed.  He waited eagerly for a letter from
the Saint Lawrence Shipping Company, and in the meanwhile
he gave his landlord a quarter's notice.  Hundred pound
a year houses would in future be a luxury which he could
not aspire to.  A small lodging in some inexpensive part
of London must be the substitute for his breezy Norwood
villa.  So be it, then!  Better that a thousand fold than
that his name should be associated with failure and
disgrace.
<P>
On that morning Harold Denver was to meet the
creditors of the firm, and to explain the situation to
them.  It was a hateful task, a degrading task, but he
set himself to do it with quiet resolution.  At home they
waited in intense anxiety to learn the result of the
meeting.  It was late before he returned,
haggard pale, like a man who has done and suffered much.
<P>
"What's this board in front of the house? he asked.
<P>
"We are going to try a little change of scene," said
the Admiral.  "This place is neither town nor
country.  But never mind that, boy.  Tell us what
happened in the City."
<P>
"God help me!  My wretched business driving you out
of house and home!" cried Harold, broken down by this
fresh evidence of the effects of his misfortunes.  "It is
easier for me to meet my creditors than to see you two
suffering so patiently for my sake."
<P>
"Tut, tut!" cried the Admiral.  "There's no suffering
in the matter.  Mother would rather be near the theaters. 
That's at the bottom of it, isn't it, mother?  You come
and sit down here between us and tell us all about it."
<P>
Harold sat down with a loving hand in each of his.
<P>
"It's not so bad as we thought," said he, "and yet it
is bad enough. I have about ten days to find the money,
but I don't know which way to turn for it.  Pearson,
however, lied, as usual, when he spoke of L13,000.  The
amount is not quite L7,000."
<P>
The Admiral claped his hands.  "I knew we should
weather it after all!  Hurrah my boy!  Hip, hip, hip,
hurrah!"
<P>
Harold gazed at him in surprise, while the old seaman
waved his arm above his head and bellowed out three
stentorian cheers.  "Where am I to get seven thousand
pounds from, dad?" he asked.
<P>
"Never mind.  You spin your yarn."
<P>
"Well, they were very good and very kind, but of
course they must have either their money or their money's
worth.  They passed a vote of sympathy with me, and
agreed to wait ten days before they took any proceedings. 
Three of them, whose claim came to L3,500, told me that
if I would give them my personal I.O.U., and pay interest
at the rate of five per cent, their amounts might stand
over as long as I wished.  That would be a charge of L175
upon my income, but with economy I could meet it, and it
diminishes the debt by one-half."
<P>
Again the Admiral burst out cheering.
<P>
"There remains, therefore, about L3,200 which has to
be found within ten days.  No man shall lose by me.  I
gave them my word in the room that if I worked my soul
out of my body every one of them should be paid.  I shall
not spend a penny upon myself until it is done.  But some
of them can't wait.  They are poor men themselves, and
must have their money.  They have issued a warrant for
Pearson's arrest.  But they think that he has got away
the States."
<P>
"These men shall have their money," said the
Admiral.
<P>
"Dad!"
<P>
"Yes, my boy, you don't know the resources of the
family.  One never does know until one tries.  What have
you yourself now?"
<P>
"I have about a thousand pounds invested."
<P>
"All right.  And I have about as much more.  There's
a good start.  Now, mother, it is your turn.  What is
that little bit of paper of yours?"
<P>
Mrs. Denver unfolded it, and placed it upon Harold's
knee.
<P>
"Five thousand pounds!" he gasped.
<P>
"Ah, but mother is not the only rich one.  Look at
this!"  And the Admiral unfolded his cheque, and placed
it upon the other knee.
<P>
Harold gazed from one to the other in bewilderment. 
"Ten thousand pounds!" he cried.  "Good heavens! where
did these come from?"
<P>
"You will not worry any longer, dear," murmured his
mother, slipping her arm round him.
<P>
But his quick eye had caught the signature upon one
of the cheques.  "Doctor Walker!" he cried, flushing. 
"This is Clara's doing.  Oh, dad, we cannot take this
money.  It would not be right nor honorable."
<P>
"No, boy, I am glad you think so.  It is something,
however, to have proved one's friend, for a real good
friend he is.  It was he who brought it in, though
Clara sent him.  But this other money will be enough to
cover everything, and it is all my own."
<P>
"Your own?  Where did you get it, dad?"
<P>
"Tut, tut!  See what it is to have a City man to deal
with.  It is my own, and fairly earned, and that is
enough."
<P>
"Dear old dad!"  Harold squeezed his gnarled hand. 
"And you, mother!  You have lifted the trouble from my
heart.  I feel another man.  You have saved my honor, my
good name, everything.  I cannot owe you more, for I owe
you everything already."
<P>
So while the autumn sunset shone ruddily through the
broad window these three sat together hand in hand, with
hearts which were too full to speak.  Suddenly the soft
thudding of tennis balls was heard, and Mrs. Westmacott
bounded into view upon the lawn with brandished racket
and short skirts fluttering in the breeze.  The sight
came as a relief to their strained nerves, and they burst
all three into a hearty fit of laughter.
<P>
"She is playing with her nephew," said Harold at
last.  "The Walkers have not come out yet.  I think that
it would be well if you were to give me that cheque,
mother, and I were to return it in person."
<P>
"Certainly, Harold.  I think it would be very nice.
<P>
He went in through the garden.  Clara and the Doctor
were sitting together in the dining-room.  She sprang to
her feet at the sight of him.
<P>
"Oh, Harold, I have been waiting for you so
impatiently," she cried; "I saw you pass the front
windows half an hour ago.  I would have come in if I
dared.  Do tell us what has happened."
<P>
"I have come in to thank you both.  How can I repay
you for your kindness?  Here is your cheque, Doctor.  I
have not needed it.  I find that I can lay my hands on
enough to pay my creditors."
<P>
"Thank God!" said Clara fervently.
<P>
"The sum is less than I thought, and our resources
considerably more.  We have been able to do it with
ease."
<P>
"With ease!"  The Doctor's brow clouded and his
manner grew cold.  "I think, Harold, that you would do
better to take this money of mine, than to use that which
seems to you to be gained with ease."
<P>
"Thank you, sir.  If I borrowed from any one it would
be from you.  But my father has this very sum, five
thousand pounds, and, as I tell him, I owe him so much
that I have no compunction about owing him more."
<P>
"No compunction!  Surely there are some sacrifices
which a son should not allow his parents to make."
<P>
"Sacrifices!  What do you mean?"
<P>
"Is it possible that you do not know how this money
has been obtained?"
<P>
"I give you my word, Doctor Walker, that I have no
idea.  I asked my father, but he refused to tell me."
<P>
"I thought not," said the Doctor, the gloom clearing
from his brow.  "I was sure that you were not a man who,
to clear yourself from a little money difficulty, would
sacrifice the happiness of your mother and the health of
your father."
<P>
"Good gracious! what do you mean?"
<P>
"It is only right that you should know.  That money
represents the commutation of your father's pension.  He
has reduced himself to poverty, and intends to go to sea
again to earn a living."
<P>
"To sea again!  Impossible!"
<P>
"It is the truth.  Charles Westmacott has told Ida. 
He was with him in the City when he took his poor pension
about from dealer to dealer trying to sell it.  He
succeeded at last, and hence the money."
<P>
"He has sold his pension!" cried Harold, with his
hands to his face.  "My dear old dad has sold his
pension!"  He rushed from the room, and burst wildly into
the presence of his parents once more.  "I cannot take
it, father," he cried.  "Better bankruptcy than that. 
Oh, if I had only known your plan!  We must have
back the pension.  Oh, mother, mother, how could you
think me capable of such selfishness?  Give me the
cheque, dad, and I will see this man to-night, for I
would sooner die like a dog in the ditch than touch a
penny of this money."
