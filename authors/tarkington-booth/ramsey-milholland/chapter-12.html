<p>"The way I look at it, Ramsey," Fred Mitchell said, when they
reached their apartment, whither the benevolent Colburn accompanied
them, "the way I look at it, this Linski kind of paid you a compliment,
after all, when he called you a fake. He must have thought you
anyway <em>looked</em> as if you could make a better speech than
you did. Oh, golly!"</p>

<p>And as Ramsey groaned, the jovial Mitchell gave himself up to
the divan and the mirth. "Oh, oh, oh, <em>golly</em>!" he sputtered.</p>

<p>"Never you mind, Brother Milholland," Colburn said gently. "The
Lumen is used to nervous beginners. I've seen dozens in my time,
just like you; and some of 'em got to be first rate before they
quit. Besides, this crazy Linski is all that anybody'll ever remember
about to-night's meeting, anyhow. There never was any such outbreak
as that in <em>my</em> time, and I guess there never was in the
whole history of the society. We'll probably suspend him until
he apologizes to the society &mdash;I'm on the board, and I'm
in favour of it. Who is the bird, anyhow? He's in your class."</p>

<p>"I never saw him before," Ramsey responded from the deep chair,
where he had moodily thrown himself; and, returning to his brooding
upon his oratory. "Oh, murder!" he moaned.</p>

<p>"Well," said the senior, "you'll know him when you see him again.
You put your mark on him where you can see it, all right!" He
chuckled. "I suppose I really ought to have interfered in that,
but I decided to do a little astronomical observation, about fifty
feet away, for a few minutes. I'm 'way behind in my astronomy,
anyhow. Do you know this Linski, Brother Mitchell?"</p>

<p>"I've talked to him a couple o' times on the campus," said Fred.
"He's in one of my classes. He's about the oldest in our class,
I guess&mdash;a lot older than us, anyhow. He's kind of an anarchist
or something; can't talk more'n five minutes any time without
gettin off some bug stuff about 'capitalism.' He said the course
in political economy was all 'capitalism' and the prof was bought
by Wall Street."</p>

<p>"Poor old Prof. Craig!" Colburn laughed. "He gets fifteen hundred
a year."</p>

<p>"Yes; I'd heard that myself, and I told Linski, and he said he
had an uncle workin' in a steel mill got twice that much; but
it didn't make any difference, ole Craig was bought by Wall Street.
He said 'capitalism' better look out; he and the foreign-born
workmen were goin' to <em>take</em> this country some day, and
that was one of the reasons he was after an education. He talked
pretty strong pro-German, too&mdash;about the war in Europe&mdash;but I
sort of thought that was more because he'd be pro-anything that
he thought would help upset the United States than because he
cared much about Germany."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Colburn, "that's how he sounded to-night. I guess
there's plenty more like him in the cities, too. That reminds
me, I'd better arrange a debate on immigration for the Lumen.
We'll put Brother Milholland for the negative, this time."</p>

<p>Ramsey started violently. "See here&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the senior reassured him. "Just wanted to see you jump,"
he explained. "Don't fear; you've done your share."</p>

<p>"I should think I have!" Ramsey groaned.</p>

<p>"Yes, you won't be called on again this term. By the way," said
Colburn, thoughtfully, "that was a clever girl you had against
you to-night. I don't believe in pacificism much, myself, but
she used it very niftily for her argument. Isn't she from your
town, this Miss Yocum?"</p>

<p>Fred nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, she's a clever young thing," said the senior, still thoughtful.
And he added: "Graceful girl, she is."</p>

<p>At this, the roommates looked at him with startled attention.
Ramsey was so roused as to forget his troubles and sit forward
in his chair.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the musing Colburn, "she's a mighty pretty girl."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>This exclamation was a simultaneous one; the astounded pair stared
at him in blank incredulity.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you think so?" Colburn mildly inquired. "She seems
to me very unusual looking."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," Fred assented, emphatically. "We're with you there!"</p>

<p>"Extraordinary eyes," continued Colburn. "Lovely figure, too;
altogether a strikingly pretty girl. Handsome, I should say, perhaps.
Yes, 'handsome' rather than 'pretty'." He looked up from a brief
reverie. "You fellows known her long?"</p>

<p>"You bet!" said Ramsey.</p>

<p>"She made a splendid impression on the Lumen," Colburn went on.
"I don't remember that I ever saw a first appearance there that
quite equalled it. She'll probably have a brilliant career in
the society, and in the university, too. She must be a very fine
sort of person." He deliberated within himself a few moments longer,
then, realizing that his hosts and Brethren did not respond with
any heartiness&mdash;or with anything at all&mdash;to the theme, he changed
it, and asked them what they thought about the war in Europe.</p>

<p>They talked of the war rather drowsily for a while; it was an
interesting but not an exciting topic: the thing they spoke of
was so far away. It was in foreign countries where they had never
been and had no acquaintances; and both the cause and the issue
seemed to be in confusion, though evidently Germany had "started"
the trouble. Only one thing emerged as absolutely clear and proved:
there could be no disagreement about Germany's "dirty work," as
Fred defined it, in violating Belgium. And this stirred Ramsey
to declare with justice that "dirty work" had likewise been done
upon himself by the official person, whoever he or she was, who
had given him the German side of the evening's debate. After this
moment of fervour, the conversation languished, and Brother Colburn
rose to go.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you gave that Linski a fine little punch, Brother
Milholland," he said, at the door. "It won't do you any harm in
the 'frat,' or with the Lumen either. And don't be discouraged
about your debating. You'll learn. Anybody might have got rattled
by having to argue against as clever and good-looking a girl as
that!"</p>

<p>The roommates gave each other a look of serious puzzlement as
the door closed. "Well, Brother Colburn is a mighty nice fellow,"
Fred said. "He's kind of funny, though."</p>

<p>Ramsey assented, and then, as the two prepared for bed, they
entered into a further discussion of their senior friend. They
liked him "all right," they said, but he certainly must be kind
of queer, and they couldn't just see how he had "ever managed
to get where he was" in the "frat" and the Lumen and the university.</p>
