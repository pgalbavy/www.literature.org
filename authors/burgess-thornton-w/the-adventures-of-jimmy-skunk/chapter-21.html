'Tis little things that often seem<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce worth a passing thought<br/>
Which in the end may prove that they<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With big results are fraught.

<p>Farmer Brown's boy watched Jimmy Skunk calmly and peacefully
go his way and grinned as he watched him. He scratched his head
thoughtfully. "I suppose," said he, "that that is as perfect an
example of the value of preparedness as there is. Jimmy knew he
was all ready for trouble if I chose to make it, and that because
of that I wouldn't make it. So he has calmly gone his way as if
he were as much bigger than I as I am bigger than he. There certainly
is nothing like being prepared if you want to avoid trouble."</p>

<p>Then Farmer Brown's boy once more turned to the henhouse and
entered it. He looked to make sure that no hen had been foolish
enough to go to sleep where Jimmy could have caught her, and satisfied
of this, he would have gone about his usual morning work of feeding
the hens but for one thing. That one thing was the china nest-egg
on the floor.</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Farmer Brown's boy when he saw it. "Now how
did that come there? It must be that Jimmy Skunk pulled it out
of one of those lower nests."</p>

<p>Now he knew just which nests had contained nest-eggs, and it
didn't take but a minute to find that none was missing in any
of the lower nests. "That's queer," he muttered. "That egg must
have come from one of the upper nests. Jimmy couldn't have got
up to those. None of the hens could have kicked it out last night,
because they were all on the roosts when I shut them up. They
certainly didn't do it this morning, because they wouldn't have
dared leave the roosts with Jimmy Skunk here. I'll have to look
into this."</p>

<p>So he began with the second row of nests and looked in each.
Then he started on the upper row, and so he came to the nest in
which Unc' Billy Possum was hiding under the hay and holding his
breath. Now Unc' Billy had covered himself up pretty well with
the hay, but he had forgotten one thing; he had forgotten his
tail. Yes, Sir, Unc' Billy had forgotten his tail, and it hung
just over the edge of the nest. Of course, Farmer Brown's boy
saw it. He couldn't help but see it.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" he exclaimed right away. "Ho, ho! So there was more
than one visitor here last night. This henhouse seems to be a
very popular place. I see that the first thing for me to do after
breakfast is to nail a board over that hole in the floor. So it
was you, Unc' Billy Possum, who kicked that nest-egg out. Found
it a little hard for your teeth, didn't you? Lost your temper
and kicked it out, didn't you? That was foolish, Unc' Billy, very
foolish indeed. Never lose your temper over trifles. It doesn't
pay. Now I wonder what I'd better do with you."</p>

<p>All this time Unc' Billy hadn't moved. Of course, he couldn't
understand what Farmer Brown's boy was saying. Nor could he see
what Farmer Brown's boy was doing. So he held his breath and hoped
and hoped that he hadn't been discovered. And perhaps he wouldn't
have been but for that telltale nest-egg on the floor. That was
the cause of all his troubles. First it had angered Jimmy Skunk
because as you remember, it had fallen on Jimmy's head. Then it
had led Farmer Brown's boy to look in all the nests. It had seemed
a trifle, kicking that egg out of that nest, but see what the
results were. Truly, little things often are not so little as
they seem.</p>
