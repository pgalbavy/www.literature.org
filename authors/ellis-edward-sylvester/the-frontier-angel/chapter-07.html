<p><em>PETERSON'S </em>destination being the Sciota valley, he left
the settlement and proceeded eastward, up the Ohio, until the
mouth of the Sciota was reached, when he prosecuted his journey
in a northerly direction, making it all on foot. Leaving him to
continue his duty, we will follow the fortunes of the other two.</p>

<p>Dingle had two reasons for taking Jenkins with him. The first
was for his own good, and the second was for his own&mdash;that is
the ranger's&mdash;amusement. He counted on little difficulty in ascertaining
all that he wished, and believed that his companion would be so
tractable in his hands that little trouble need be apprehended
from his erratic disposition. His plan was to proceed westward,
following the course of the Ohio, until the mouth of the Little
Miami was reached, up which he would proceed in a canoe. As he
had often visited the same town, he took occasion, when upon one
of his expeditions, to "borrow" an Indian canoe, as he expressed
it, and concealing it at the mouth of this river, to be used for
the purpose named.</p>

<p>"Confound it! what did you want to take me along for?" demanded
Jenkins, spitefully, after they were fairly in the wood.</p>

<p>"Why, to scout around, and obsarve the pecooliarities of the
Shawnees," replied Dingle.</p>

<p>"Yes, s'pose so! darned if I don't shoot every one I see!"</p>

<p>"Good! give us your paw on that, Jenkins, you're some, after
all."</p>

<p>"After all what?" demanded the wrathful man, not at all relishing
the eagerness with which the ranger took his threat.</p>

<p>"After all the dodgin' and sneakin' you've done when the reds
war around."</p>

<p>"See here now!" exclaimed Jenkins, stepping in front of and confronting
the ranger. "I want to know what you mean by that? That's a reflection
upon my courage which I never intend to permit."</p>

<p>Dingle, concluding it best not to offend him at present, answered,
"I meant the time you fell down so flat when the Frontier Angel
fired her arrer at you."</p>

<p>"Do you know what made me do it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes &mdash;I mind me now, you had a fit just then."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, don't let me hear anything more about that then;
I have explained all about them fits, and you must remember."</p>

<p>"Wal, never mind, Jenkins, it won't do to git them now, coz why,
if you do, when you come to again, you'll find you've cotched
another kind of fits&mdash;wal, you will, ole feller."</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose, Dick, they'll watch us close?" asked Jenkins,
in a tone so changed from his braggadocio style to that of earnest
inquiry, that Dingle could not conceal a smile.</p>

<p>"Mighty clus, you'll find out. Howsumever, ef you tend to your
business and mind what I tell you, you'll come out all right,
I guess."</p>

<p>"My gracious! I wish we was only on our way back. I don't like
Injins no way you can fix it."</p>

<p>"I don't neither, so let's pike ahead and hold in for a while."</p>

<p>The journey continued in silence. They were on the Ohio side
of the river, having crossed it at the commencement of their expedition.
Late in the afternoon they were obliged to swim a small stream
that put in from the Ohio. This was accomplished easily, as both
were excellent swimmers, Jenkins fully equal to the ranger. On
the shore of this they halted, spent a few moments in eating a
portion of the food they had brought with them. By this time darkness
had settled over the forest, but the moon was quite strong, and
they kept on for several hours. At the end of that time they reached
a solitary block-house, standing on a clearing, where it was the
intention to shortly commence a settlement. There was a small
force stationed there by the governor of the territory some months
previous. The sentinel was on the look-out and detected the approach
of Dingle as soon as the latter became aware of the block-house.
He was instantly challenged, but a word set the matter right,
and in a moment one of the force descended, unbarred the gate,
and joyfully welcomed him in. Lew Whetzel, to whom we have before
referred, was in the block-house, and the meeting between him
and Dingle was cordial on both sides. There were eight soldiers
besides, all adepts in Indian warfare. The commander produced
his cups, poured out whisky, and none, save Jenkins, needed an
invitation to drink. The latter was a perfect novice, and with
wondering eyes followed the motions and actions of Dingle. The
consequence was, before any one suspected it, he commenced nodding,
and shortly dropped upon the floor. One of the men rolled him
into the corner, where he slept until morning.</p>

<p>Dingle, Whetzel, and several others kept up the conversation
all through the night. They drank enough to make each communicative,
and related stories and anecdotes almost without end. Lew Whetzel
gave that incident in his experience to which we have before alluded.
At its conclusion, he sprang to his feet with a regular Shawnee
yell.</p>

<p>"And here is Lew Whetzel! ready for a bear-fight, Indian hug,
or a hair raise."</p>

<p>As he uttered these words, he gave Jenkins a kick that thoroughly
awakened him.</p>

<p>"Gracious alive! what's the matter?" exclaimed the latter, starting
to his feet.</p>

<p>"Day has broke, and it's time to be trampin'," said Dingle.</p>

<p>"Yas," added Whetzel; "and I must go up the river to see the
boys."</p>

<p>The appearance of this Lewis Whetzel was most extraordinary.
He was below the medium height, with a square massive breast,
very broad shoulders, and arms as powerful as piston-rods. His
face was nearly as dark as an Indian's, and marked with the small-pox.
His eyes were of the fiercest blackness imaginable, and there
were few who could stand their terrible glance when angry. It
is said that he never allowed his hair to be cut. At any rate,
at the time mentioned, it was so long, that when allowed to flow
unrestrained, it reached down below his knees.</p>

<p>Dingle and Jenkins passed outside, and after a hasty good-by,
plunged resolutely into the forest. The ranger led the advance,
in his usual cautious manner, proceeding rapidly, and yet so stealthily
that their approach could not have been heard a dozen feet distant,
excepting now and then, when Jenkins caught his foot in some vine,
and tumbled with a suppressed exclamation upon his hands and knees,
or forgot himself so much as to undertake to commence a conversation.</p>

<p>The journey was continued without incident worthy of note until
nightfall. Not an Indian or white man was encountered through
the day. Just at dusk, they reached a river, which, as Dingle
informed Jenkins, was the Little Miami.</p>

<p>"My gracious! has that got to be swam, too?" asked the latter,
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"No! we'll row over, I guess."</p>

<p>"Row over? how can we do that?"</p>

<p>"Don't ax too many questions and you'll see."</p>

<p>With this, Dingle proceeded some distance upstream, and then
halted before a large, tangled mass of undergrowth. Here he stooped
down, and pulled out a small birchen canoe, almost as light as
paper. An Indian's paddle lay beside it, which he instructed Jenkins
to bring forth. As he dropped the boat in the river, it danced
as uneasily and buoyantly as an eggshell.</p>

<p>"Where under the sun did you get that thing?" asked Jenkins.</p>

<p>"That belongs to the Frontier Angel. It's the one we used to
go sparking in when we was young."</p>

<p>"Pshaw, Dick, you're joking," replied Jenkins, incredulously.</p>

<p>"I should think you knowed enough of me to know that I never
joke when I'm scouting it. Jest jump in while I give it a shove."</p>

<p>Now if any of our readers have ever seen a small Indian canoe,
they will detect at once the mischievous object of Dingle in asking
his companion to "jump into" this one. It is an impossibility
for a person who does not understand them, to spring in without
going overboard. It is precisely similar to putting on a pair
of skates for the first time. Unless you have tried it before,
and know how to do it, you are sure to be deceived. But Jenkins
had no suspicions, judging from the last remark of Dingle that
he was perfectly serious.</p>

<p>So he made a spring, struck the thing near the bow, and it shot
like a bolt backward into the shore, and he disappeared with a
loud splash beneath the surface of the water.</p>

<p>"Blast that boat! what made it do that?" he spluttered, scrambling
into shore again.</p>

<p>"You're a smart one!" remarked Dingle, without changing a muscle
of his face. "I'd 'vise you to practice a little at gettin' in
a boat, when you've got time. I s'pose I'll have to hold it for
you, this time."</p>

<p>And so he did, seizing it by the stern, and holding it firmly
while Jenkins carefully deposited himself in the front part. Dingle
then stepped in, seated himself near the middle, and dipping his
paddle in the water, shot rapidly toward the opposite bank.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, and by keeping near the center of the
stream, he felt secure from observation from either shore. An
hour or two, he sped swiftly forward, encountering no suspicious
object, and exchanging not a syllable with his companion. After
a time, the moon arose; and, as it slowly rolled above the wilderness,
it shed such a flood of light as to make it extremely dangerous
to continue as heretofore. The tall forest trees towered upon
both sides, throwing a wall of shadow far out into the stream.
Dingle ran his canoe in under protection of these, upon the left
bank, and dipped his oars more deeply and silently, commanding
Jenkins not to utter a syllable.</p>

<p>Dingle paddled hour after hour, until toward midnight, he touched
the bank, sprung out, and exchanged places with Jenkins, who took
his turn at the paddle. At first he made several feints, nearly
upsetting the canoe, but, in a short time, he became quite an
expert, and did his duty without a murmur. Another exchange, another
long pull, and the ranger ran his canoe again into shore, pulling
it up and concealing it on the bank. Day was dawning, and they
had reached that point where it was necessary to take to the forest
again, and strike across toward Mad river.</p>

<p>In doing this, our friends were compelled to pass the Indian
village mentioned as being a short distance below where Xenia
now stands. This being a smaller and less important one than Piqua,
Dingle concluded to visit it upon his return. The river, at the
point where they disembarked, made a bend to the eastward; so
that, by taking a direct northwest course toward Mad river, it
was not even necessary to make a detour to avoid it.</p>

<p>They had now progressed so far upon their journey, that Dingle
knew they could reach Piqua long before night. Accordingly, he
crawled into a dense mass of undergrowth, followed by Jenkins,
who carefully restored the bushes behind him to their upright
position, so as to remove all signs of their trail. Here they
both lay down and slept soundly.</p>

<p>Dingle possessed that power, which is so singular and yet so
easily acquired, of waking at the precise moment he wished. About
noon he opened his eyes, arose to the sitting position, gave Jenkins
a kick, and ordered him to make ready to start. After a hearty
meal upon the last of the venison they had brought with them,
they emerged from their resting-place, and once more resumed their
journey.</p>

<p>As they gradually approached the neighborhood of the Indian settlement,
Dingle became more and more cautious in his movements, until Jenkins
was in a perfect tremor of apprehension.</p>

<p>"Don't fall behind!" admonished the ranger, unmercifully.</p>

<p>"My gracious, I won't! Every time you stop, I bump against you.
I've mashed my nose already."</p>

<p>"Never mind; we're gettin' nigher every minute."</p>

<p>"I know we are, and that's what troubles me so much. If we were
only going the other way, I wouldn't mind it so much."</p>

<p>Several times they came upon Indian trails, some of which were
so fresh that Dingle made several detours, painfully tedious to
Jenkins, who every minute was getting into a feverish state. Before
dark, they ascended a sort of ridge, which seemed the boundary
of a valley on the left. Jenkins followed his guide so closely,
that he hardly took his eyes off of him, much less did he know
where he was going. He saw they were ascending a rising ground,
and that, after about an hour's labor, he came to a halt.</p>

<p>"Take a look down there!" whispered Dingle, parting the bushes
in front of him. Jenkins followed the direction of his finger,
and saw, spread out before him, in the valley below, the entire
Indian village.</p>

<p>"My gracious! don't that look funny!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It don't strike me as rather funny, when you understand what
they're making all that fuss for."</p>

<p>"Not for us, you don't mean."</p>

<p>"Yes, for us."</p>

<p>"Let's be gettin' out of here, then."</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean for us here, but for the settlement&mdash;the block-house."</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought you meant they were coming here."</p>

<p>It was evident to any eye, that the savages below them were making
preparations for some hostile expedition. Dingle judged it was
against their own village from what the Frontier Angel had said.
Most of the warriors were collected upon a large open space near
one end of the village. Here several of their orators&mdash;<em>stump
speakers</em> is a better term&mdash;were constantly haranguing them.
The excited gesticulation, the bobbing of the head, and now and
then a word could be heard by our two friends in concealment.
The men were arrayed in the gaudy hideousness of war-paint, and
to all appearances hugely delighted with the oratory that greeted
their ears. Men were continually arriving and departing, sometimes
nearly a score passing into the wood, and then reappearing in
a short time again. Every second several shouts or yells pierced
the air. The whole village was in commotion, and Dingle could
as well have departed at once with the information that the Shawnees
were again taking the war-path, and the settlement was most probably
the object of their fury. But he determined to know more before
he went back.</p>

<p>As it was getting darker, and the shrubbery and undergrowth were
so dense as to afford a sure concealment in spite of the moon,
which rose at a late hour, he felt no hesitation at making a much
nearer approach.</p>

<p>In a short time they were within a hundred yards of the upper
end. Here they both nestled down, and waited some time before
making a further movement.</p>

<p>"Keep powerful quiet, while I look around!" admonished Dingle,
crouching down and commencing to move off in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Here, hold on a minute," whispered Jenkins, eagerly catching
the skirt of his hunting-dress; "how long are you going to be
gone?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;sh!"</p>

<p>The footsteps of some one were now heard, breaking through the
bushes. Dingle and Jenkins bent low, and in a moment discerned,
looming up against the light in the village, the dark form of
an Indian.</p>

<p>"By gracious! he's coming right onto us. Where's my gun?"</p>

<p>"Shut up, or I'll break it over your head," replied Dingle.</p>

<p>The hunter loosened his knife in his belt, for an encounter seemed
unavoidable. The Indian came right straight ahead, in a line toward
them; but when within ten feet, unconsciously to himself perhaps,
he turned to the left and passed on, thus escaping a collision
and his own doom at the same time.</p>

<p>"Now don't stir from hyer till I come back," whispered Dingle,
again.</p>

<p>"Just wait a minute, Dick; I want to ask a question or two."</p>

<p>"Spit them out, quick then!"</p>

<p>"How long are you going to be gone?"</p>

<p>"P'r'aps an hour or two."</p>

<p>"What must I do all that time?"</p>

<p>"Why, lay still&mdash;don't budge an inch, 'cept you want to lose
your ha'r."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't want to lose it. S'pose the Injins come poking round
here, what's to be done then?"</p>

<p>"Keep docile, and like as not they won't see you; but if they
does, why, jump up, give 'em a lunge with your knife, and put
to the woods. You can run fast 'nough to give 'em the slip. In
course, you'll have to make some tall dodgin' to do it, but I
guess you are able."</p>

<p>"I'll try it, Dick, though I'd much rather you'd stay."</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;so don't bother me agin."</p>

<p>With this, Dingle moved away as silently as a snake, and disappeared
instantly. He made his way toward the opposite side of the village.
It was not his intention to proceed thus far at first, but circumstances
compelled him. It seemed impossible to gain the view he wished.
At every point, some obstruction presented itself. The Indians,
too, were so continually passing through the wood, that discovery
sometimes appeared inevitable. They made their appearance so suddenly,
that they were not seen until almost upon him, and then it was
only by the most labored caution that they could be avoided. Several
times, indeed, had it come to that point, that he clutched his
knife, and stooped to spring; but kind fortune still screened
him.</p>

<p>Dingle had been absent about a couple of hours, and had reached
a spot from which he believed he could obtain all the information
he wished, when he was startled by the report of a rifle, and
a series of yells from the quarter in which he had left Jenkins!
He heard the rush of feet through the bushes and the signals of
alarm all about him.</p>

<p>"That cussed fool has got himself into a fix, I'll swear!" muttered
the ranger retreating several yards, so as to be concealed by
the wood, and hurrying around toward the spot in which he had
left him. He reached it in a few minutes, but all signs of commotion
had ceased. An extraordinary stillness reigned over the village.
He signaled for Jenkins, but no answer was returned. He found,
at last, the precise spot in which he had left him. But he was
gone, most certainly.</p>

<p>"Yas, the fool's in a fix, sure. Sarved him right. He'll larn
sunkthin' afore he gets back to the settlement again."</p>
