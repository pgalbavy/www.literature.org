<p>Ben Mayberry was sitting at his desk in the Damietta office,
one beautiful day in Indian summer, attentive as ever to his duties,
when a carriage drove up to the door containing a young gentleman
and a lady. The former sprang lightly out and ran into the office,
after the manner of one who was in a hurry to send an important
telegram.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while Ben was looking at the youth he recognized him
as Rutherford Richmond, with whom he had had several important
meetings.</p>

<p>"Why, Rutherford, you have grown so much I didn't recognize you;
I am glad to see you; how have you been?"</p>

<p>Ben reached his hand over the counter as he greeted the young
man, but the latter affected not to hear him. Turning to the desk,
he wrote out a message with great rapidity, wheeled about, and,
without the slightest evidence of ever having seen Ben, handed
him the paper and ordered the dispatch to be sent to New York.</p>

<p>This was the telegram:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"Richard Willard, No.&mdash; Avenue, New York:

</p>
<p>
"Dolly and I reached here safe. Big party at Grandin's<br/>
to-morrow; sure of grand time. Will take good care of<br/>
Dolly.

</p>
<p>
"Rutherford Richmond."

</p>

<p>As the writer hurried out the door, Ben followed him with his
eyes. There, in a handsome, single-seated carriage, sat a beautiful
miss of thirteen or fourteen, elegantly dressed and looking straight
toward him. It was Dolly Willard, more enchanting than ever, her
eyes luminous with health and her cheeks as pink and rosy as the
delicate tint of the coral.</p>

<p>Ben was too shocked to salute her, and probably it was as well
he did not do so, for she simply stared with scarcely less directness
than did her companion.</p>

<p>Only by the most supreme exertion was the youth enabled to choke
down his rebellious emotions, so that none in the office noticed
his excitement.</p>

<p>It was the same on the morrow, and, as if the fates had combined
to crush him in absolute wretchedness, he encountered Rutherford
and Dolly riding out as he was making his way homeward. He affected
not to see them, but he could not avoid furtively watching Dolly,
who certainly was the most winsome-looking young miss he had ever
seen.</p>

<p>"To-night another party is given by the Grandins. Their girls
are ladies, and they treated me well when I was there more than
two years ago, but in this matter Dolly has had all to say&mdash;that
is, she and Rutherford. Well, if she is that sort of girl, I don't
want anything to do with her."</p>

<p>That night, in spite of himself, Ben could not stay at home;
he strolled along, a prey to his bitter thoughts, and mechanically
walked in the direction of the splendid grounds of the wealthy
jeweler, Mr. Grandin. The sound of music from within aroused him.</p>

<p>He saw the lights glimmering through the beautiful shade trees,
and could catch sight of the gayly-dressed figures flitting by
the open windows.</p>

<p>"I can't feel any worse," muttered Ben, walking through the open
gate, confident that he would attract no special attention.</p>

<p>He sauntered up the graveled walk, turning off to the right and
moving slowly along, with his gaze fixed upon the gay lads and
lasses within, who seemed to be in the very height of enjoyment.</p>

<p>At that instant someone caught his arm, and Ben turned with an
apology for his forgetfulness.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, but I was so interested in the scene that I did
not notice where I stepped&#11834;"</p>

<p>He paused, fairly gasping for breath, for there stood Dolly Willard
at his side, with her hand upon his arm. The light streaming from
the windows fell upon her charming face, on which there was an
expression that young Mayberry did not understand.</p>

<p>"Ben," said she, in a voice that sounded unnatural, "I've got
something I want to say to you."</p>

<p>"And I have a good deal that I would like to say to you," he
retorted, firing up, now that the little empress stood before
him.</p>
