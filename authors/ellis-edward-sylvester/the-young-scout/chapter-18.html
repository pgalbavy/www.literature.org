<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Lieutenant James Decker had been warned more than once by the
older and more experienced officers of his regiment that, sooner
or later, his ardor would bring him to grief. He was so eager
for a brush with the Apaches, that he charged headlong into the
affray, forgetful that the foe was the most cunning, brave and
skillful of any tribe on the American continent.</p>

<p>It was Decker who, on his first campaign against Geronimo, brought
a sharp reprimand upon himself from the captain, for his recklessness
in front of a rocky edge, at a time when it was known the wily
chieftain and his band had been brought to bay. The command had
dismounted, and were lying on the ground, behind their prostrate
steeds, or whatever protection they could secure, waiting for
a chance at the miscreants, among the rocks, but a short distance
away. And while they were lying thus, what did the lieutenant
do but spur his pony forward, and deliberately gallop back and
forth, between the two lines, where it would seem it was the easiest
thing in the world for Geronimo or one of his men to tumble him
from the saddle.</p>

<p>At first Captain Grindle could hardly believe his eyes; then
he thought the young officer was "rattled" to that extent that
he was unaware of what he was doing; but he quickly saw the true
state of affairs, and Decker was ordered instantly to fall back.
As he turned to obey the peremptory command, several shots were
fired from the rocks behind him, but, scorning to throw himself
forward on the neck of his animal, he rode slowly back, freely
expressing his opinion of the timidity of the other officers and
men.</p>

<p>It was Decker, too, who, on another occasion of still greater
peril, pretended he did not hear the order of his superior officer
to withdraw, and spurred his horse straight at a group of red
men, using his revolver and sword with a vigor and effect that
thrilled the veteran campaigners who witnessed the scene. It took
a charge of a dozen cavalrymen to extricate the fellow, but he
came back without a scratch. He did good service, too, as has
been told, in checking the raid of Geronimo the previous winter.</p>

<p>Somehow or other, the best of fortune had attended Lieutenant
Decker thus far. He had played the part of target for Apache rifles
more times than he could count, but the astonishing fact remained
that not a hair of his head had as yet been harmed.</p>

<p>But this could not last, however. Unless he mended his ways and
showed more discretion, he must go down as many a brave man had
gone before him. But, as I have said, he was liked by his command
and associates; for, aside from his fine personal qualities, he
was a leader, instead of a follower, in all emergencies where
dashing heroism was required.</p>

<p>Every one of the six men who gave their steeds rein and charged
southward toward the Gila in pursuit of the fleeing Apaches was
splendidly mounted. It would have been folly to take up the pursuit
under any other conditions. The time was likely to come when their
animals could not serve them, and they would have to dismount
and push on afoot, but until then they must ride hard and unceasingly.</p>

<p>The well-known qualities of the leader of the little company
caused Maurice Freeman keen misgiving. He knew that if ever the
moment should arrive when Maroz and Ceballos saw they could not
hold their little prisoner, they would put him to death with no
more compunction than they would crush the rattlesnake in their
path. In an enterprise of this kind there was urgent call for
subtlety of the highest order. The father was so impressed with
the fact that he reminded the lieutenant of it while they were
riding side by side. Decker nodded his head, and said:</p>

<p>"I won’t forget it; I wish the boy was somewhere else, not only
for his own sake, but that his presence among the Apaches might
not handicap us. I would like to drive those fellows into a corner
before they could cross, and then sail into them! There would
be three less Apaches to raise the mischief than now."</p>

<p>"But what do you intend to do?" asked the parent, unable to understand
his plans without more enlightenment.</p>

<p>The lieutenant turned his frank face toward the anxious one on
his left, and replied:</p>

<p>"The prime object of this business is to save your boy; I know
how you feel, and I feel for you; the colonel and the rest condemn
me for being reckless, but that is only where <em>men</em> are
involved; I’ll show that I can be as cautious and as patient as
any of them, when there is need of being so."</p>

<p>"But—lieutenant——"</p>

<p>"I know what you are going to say; my actions just now don’t
indicate that, for they mean a fight. Nevertheless, I’ll prove
my earnestness if I have the chance. My plan is to bring them
to bay this side of the river. Then, before we fire a shot, I’ll
let them know that, if they surrender and give up the boy, they
won’t be punished."</p>

<p>"But how can you do <em>that</em>?" was the astonished inquiry
of Freeman.</p>

<p>"Easily; I’ve been in the country long enough to pick up a fair
knowledge of their lingo, and you’ll admit that I am the proprietor
of a pretty good voice."</p>

<p>"But will the murder of Captain Murray and his family be allowed
to go unpunished?"</p>

<p>"It ought not to, but that will have to be a condition. The colonel
told me when I left the fort to get word to Maroz and Ceballos
that they would be treated leniently if they stopped at once and
returned to the reservation. We knew they had slain Cemuri, but
that would be overlooked."</p>

<p>"Think of Captain Murray and his family!"</p>

<p>"I have done so; the colonel, if he knew that, would not permit
the offer on my part, but I have his warrant for giving the pledge,
and I’ll do it for the sake of your child, if the chance is given.
There is dishonesty among the traders and some of the settlers,
but the renegades know as well as you that when the army makes
a pledge it will be kept, no matter at what cost."</p>

<p>Maurice Freeman always admired the dashing lieutenant, but he
never appeared so handsome to him as when, with a glowing face,
he uttered these words. The heart of the brave fellow was as tender
as a woman’s and the prime purpose of the dangerous business on
which he had entered was to save the innocent child from the fate
that impended over it.</p>

<p>Meantime the chase was pushed with all possible vigor. Every
pony was doing his level best, and neither he nor his rider cared
for the pitiless rays that darted down upon their heads like spears
of fire. There was scarcely a tree between them and the river
flowing across their course. A couple of brooks were passed, but
the major portion of the route was an undulating plain, sandy
in most places, but rich and fertile in others, with a surprising
luxuriance of grass, which rendered it a favorite grazing resort
for animals.</p>

<p>Further to the west and north, where many extensive ranches were
to be found, the grazing was no better, and often not so good.
Miles to the southward, beyond the calmly flowing river, the ragged
Apache range lifted its crest against the sky, stretching east
and west, further than the eye could reach, and forming one of
the wildest spurs of the Rocky Mountain system.</p>

<p>It was toward the fastnesses of this range that the hostiles
were making with the desperate energy of men who knew that success
meant life and failure the opposite. If they could place the river
between them and their pursuers, they would be safe: could they
do it?</p>

<p>The dusky horsemen were about a mile from the river when the
first sight of them was obtained. Lieutenant Decker, who had forged
slightly ahead of the rest, thundered up one of the numerous slopes,
only a few feet in height, at the moment that the fugitives shot
over the crest of a similar one. They were seen distinctly riding
close together, and with their ponies at the highest speed.</p>

<p>"We are gaining!" shouted the lieutenant; "don’t spare your horses!
we shall catch them!"</p>

<p>In truth the animals had not been spared from the first. It was
cruel to push them thus, but the stakes warranted it. That little
life was worth more than the lives of any multitude of mustangs.</p>

<p>The fact that the whites had gained up to this time was ground
for belief they would continue to do so, and much ought to be
done before the stream was reached.</p>

<p>Hardly a word was exchanged, except now and then, between the
lieutenant and Mr. Freeman. Peyser, Colgate and Redfield kept
their ponies at the high pace, while they sat grimly in their
saddles leaning forward to catch the earliest sight possible of
the fugitives. Mendez rode his own mustang, a wiry little mare
of coal black color, that was one of the hardiest and fleetest
of her kind.</p>

<p>The White Mountain Apache kept a little to the left of the rest,
as if he preferred the companionship of his thoughts to that of
men. The speed of his animal lifted the coarse black hair, that
generally dangled about his shoulders, and caused it to flutter
in a gale, like the mane and tail of his steed. His stolid face
was without pain, and it must be confessed that it was not pleasant
to look upon. It was broad, with protruding cheek bones, the mouth
was wide, and the nose was scarred and broken years before in
some ugly affray of which he never spoke.</p>

<p>The American Indian always shows little muscular development,
but those half-bare arms and legs were like tempered steel. Mendez,
more than once, had trotted up the side of a mountain, for a quarter
of a mile, and, when he stopped, his respiration was no faster
than at starting. Many others of his people have done the same
thing and can do it to-day.</p>

<p>He had ridden his mustang into the mountains as far as he could
go, and when three days passed, with not a mouthful of food, he
slew his pony, devoured what he wanted, and then pushed on for
three days more, without eating, during two of which he did not
taste a drop of water.</p>

<p>And through all that period, the temperature during the day never
sank below a hundred degrees. The swarthy foe whose trail he was
following (and whom he ultimately bagged) did almost precisely
the same thing, and the endurance of neither was greater than
that of the majority of their people at this very hour.</p>

<p>Mendez rode without saddle, and his only bridle was a piece of
lariat loosely looped about the neck of his mustang, just back
of the head. There was little need of that, for he readily guided
the movements of the animal by the touch of the hand or heel or
his voice.</p>

<p>Whether the renegades to the southward had seen their pursuers
before the latter caught sight of them cannot be known, but within
the succeeding five minutes a most unpleasant truth became manifest:
they were fully as well mounted as the whites. Lieutenant Decker
muttered impatiently when the fact could no longer be ignored:</p>

<p>"Their outbreak and flight were no sudden impulse," he concluded,
"for had it been they could not have made such complete preparations.
There are no better ponies in the country than those they are
riding."</p>

<p>Shortly after this decision was reached another unpleasant discovery
broke upon the whites, or rather upon Mendez, for he was the first
to notice it, and told the rest in a few words of his broken English.</p>

<p>When first seen there were three of the flying Apaches, corresponding
with the number that had fired the home and destroyed the family
of Captain Murray. The second scrutiny of the band revealed the
astonishing fact that there were now four, who were pushing desperately
for the river.</p>

<p>Where in the name of all that was wonderful the fourth horseman
had come from was beyond the understanding of the pursuers, unless
a glimmer of the truth stole through the brain of Mendez. If so,
he kept it to himself.</p>

<p>The first thought of the lieutenant and Freeman was that the
lifeless warrior, which the Apaches were bearing away, had been
set upon a pony, and so fixed that he could keep upright during
the flight; but to do that an additional animal was necessary,
and his sudden appearance was as amazing as that of his rider.</p>

<p>The most probable theory was that the new reinforcement had been
waiting somewhere along the line of flight, and fell into line
when the proper time arrived; but the disquieting conviction could
not be avoided that Maroz and Ceballos had not only made deliberate
preparations for their crimes, but had more allies than at first
was suspected.</p>

<p>All this was bad enough, but still worse was to come.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker shook his head:</p>

<p>"There’s no stopping them; they’ll cross the river in the face
of all we can do; they must be followed into the mountains, and
by that time there is likely to be a dozen of them together."</p>

<p>Freeman made no answer, for he had none to make, but he observed
that the officer now abated the killing pace of his horse. Since
it was impossible to overtake the Apaches in a fair pursuit, and
there was no possible way of preventing them from crossing the
river, it was cruel to hold the animals at such exhausting speed.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when the horsemen struck the northern bank of the
stream, the others were emerging on the southern shore. Their
animals had swam most of the way, for the river was deep. The
enemies were now in plainer sight of each other than ever.</p>

<p>Reining up his horse, Lieutenant Decker leveled his glass and
studied the Apaches with the utmost care during the few minutes
the opportunity presented. He had no difficulty in identifying
Maroz and Ceballos, who, halting their ponies in plain sight,
made tantalizing gestures and uttered defiant shouts in a mixture
of Apache and English.</p>

<p>The other bucks were strangers to the officer, though he was
quite sure he had seen one of them at the fort. It was the latter
who still supported the body of his fallen friend on his horse,
as if resolved that it should not fall into the hands of their
pursuers.</p>

<p>Maroz held young Fulton Freeman on the mustang in front of him.
Not only that, but he raised the lad, and steadied him on his
feet, so as so make sure his friends saw him. The boy stared wonderingly
across the river, as if searching for some one whom he knew. He
would have recognized his father had not the latter shrank behind
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Don’t move," he said to the officer in a husky voice; "I can’t
stand it if he sees and calls to me. Tell me when he is gone!"</p>

<p>The strong man bowed his head, while the others silently watched
the scene on the other shore.</p>

<p>In reply to the taunts of Maroz and his companions, the lieutenant
now called back, that if they would return to the reservation,
restoring their prisoner unharmed to his friends, and would promise
henceforth to be good Indians, they should not suffer for what
they had already done.</p>

<p>The answer to this offer was so insulting that the officer ground
his teeth, and prayed that he might once get within arm’s reach
of the miscreant before the business ended. Possibly, had the
Apaches been checked in their flight before reaching the river,
they might have accepted the offer; but then, had such good fortune
befallen the pursuers, it is unlikely the offer would have been
made, unless necessary to save the life of the young prisoner.</p>

<p>Having scorned the olive branch, Maroz and Ceballos emphasized
the refusal by deliberately firing a couple of shots at their
pursuers, the bullets whistling uncomfortably near their ears.
Then, to show how much they despised the soldiers, they rode away
at a walk, instead of dashing off at full speed.</p>

<p>The strongest proof that Lieutenant Decker could give to Maurice
Freeman of his self-restraint was when he forbade any of his men
to return the fire. The conclusion was fair that one or more of
the hostiles could be hit, for there was not a poor marksman in
the party; but little Fulton Freeman was as likely to be struck
as they, and, if not, his captors would show their characteristic
enmity against him.</p>

<p>"You can look up now, Freeman!" said Decker to the parent, sitting
motionless and with bowed head behind him.</p>

<p>The father did so, without a word, and observed the Apaches riding
off, Maroz and Ceballos bearing to the left, while the other two,
with their inanimate burden, trended to the right. The fugitives
had split into two equal divisions, which, if they continued to
diverge, must soon lose sight of each other.</p>

<p>The most direct course for the pursuers was to ride into the
water and follow the fugitives, but the lieutenant hesitated.</p>

<p>"They expect us to do it," said he, consulting with his companions,
as was his custom, at a perplexing point.</p>

<p>"Then why not do it?" asked Budge Colgate.</p>

<p>"Because we can gain nothing and may lose a great deal. I would
give all I have, which isn’t much, for a chance at them, but this
is a case where we must try their own tactics: we must hide our
plan of campaign from them, if it can possibly be done."</p>

<p>"What method do you propose?"</p>

<p>"We’ll turn back and ride off, as if we had given up a useless
task, or have started after reinforcements. The Apaches will vote
us sensible men for doing so. Then we must manage to get to the
other side without discovery, and with the help of Mendez will
try to track them to their hiding place."</p>

<p>A comparison of views showed a unanimous agreement that this
was the best course to follow. Mendez, to whom the others looked
with special confidence, nodded his head several times and told
them nothing else would do. They would probably have to wait until
night before setting out in earnest, but that was far better than
to swim the river, when sure of being seen.</p>

<p>To emphasize his words, the dusky scout now pointed across the
stream and uttered the single exclamation:</p>

<p>"See dere!"</p>

<p>All eyes followed the direction of the extended finger and their
hearts sank at what met their gaze.</p>

<p>"The very thing I have been dreading from the start!" was the
disappointed exclamation of Lieutenant Decker.</p>
