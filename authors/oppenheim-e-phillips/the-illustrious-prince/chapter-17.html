<P>
Mr. James B. Coulson was almost as much at home at the Grand 
Hotel, Paris, as he had been at the Savoy in London. His
headquarters were at the American Bar, where he approved of the
cocktails,patronized the highballs, and continually met
fellow-countrymen with whom he gossiped and visited various
places of amusement. His business during the daytime he kept to
himself, but he certainly was possessed of a bagful of documents
and drawings relating to sundry patents connected with the
manufacture of woollen goods, the praises of which he was always
ready to sing in a most enthusiastic fashion.
<P>
Mr. Coulson was not a man whose acquaintance it was difficult to
make. From five to seven every afternoon, scorning the
attractions of the band outside  and the generally festive air
which pervaded the great tea rooms, he sat at the corner of the
bar  upon an article of furniture which resembled more than
anything else an office stool, dividing  his attention between
desultory conversation with any other gentleman who might be
indulging in a drink, and watching the billiards in which some of
his compatriots were usually competing. It was not, so far as one
might judge, a strenuous life which Mr. Coulson was leading. He
had been known once or twice to yawn, and he had somewhat the
appearance of a man engaged in an earnest but at times not
altogether successful attempt to kill time. Perhaps for that
reason he made acquaintances with a little more than his
customary freedom. There was a young Englishman, for instance,
whose name, it appeared, was Gaynsforth, with whom, after a drink
or two at the bar, he speedily became on almost intimate terms.
<P>
Mr. Gaynsforth was a young man, apparently of good breeding and
some means. He was well dressed, of cheerful disposition, knew
something about the woollen trade, and appeared to take a
distinct liking to his new friend. The two men, after having
talked business together for some time, arranged to dine together
and have what they called a gay evening. They retired to their
various apartments to change, Mr. Gaynsforth perfectly well
satisfied with his progress, Mr. James B. Coulson with a broad
grin upon his face.
<P>
After a very excellent dinner, for which Mr. Gaynsforth insisted
upon paying, they went to the Folies Bergeres, where the
Englishman developed a thirst which, considering the coolness of
the evening, was nothing short of amazing. Mr. Coulson, however,
kept pace with him steadily, and toward midnight their
acquaintance had steadily progressed until they were certainly on
friendly if not affectionate terms. A round of the supper places,
proposed by the Englishman, was assented to by Mr. Coulson with
enthusiasm. About three o'clock in the morning Mr. Coulson had
the appearance of a man for whom the troubles of this world are
over, and who was realizing the ecstatic bliss of a temporary
Nirvana. Mr. Gaynsforth, on the other hand, although half an hour
ago he had been boisterous and unsteady, seemed suddenly to have
become once more the quiet, discreet-looking young Englishman who
had first bowed to Mr. Coulson in the bar of the Grand Hotel and
accepted with some diffidence his offer of a drink. To prevent
his friend being jostled by the somewhat mixed crowd in which
they then were, Mr. Gaynsforth drew nearer and nearer to him. He
even let his hand stray over his person, as though to be sure
that he was not carrying too much in his pockets.
<P>
"Say, old man," he whispered in his ear,--they were sitting side
by side now in the Bal Tabarin,--"if you are going on like this,
Heaven knows where you'll land at the end of it all! I'll look
after you as well as I can,--where you go, I'll go--but we can't
be together every second of the time. Don't you think you'd be
safer if you handed over your pocketbook to me?"
<P>
"Right you are!" Mr. Coulson declared, falling a little over on
one side. "Take it out of my pocket. Be careful of it now.
There's five hundred francs there, and the plans of a loom which
I wouldn't sell for a good many thousands."
<P>
Mr. Gaynsforth possessed himself quickly of the pocketbook, and
satisfied himself that his friend's description of its contents
was fairly correct.
<P>
"You've nothing else upon you worth taking care of?" he
whispered. "You can trust me, you know. You haven't any papers,
or anything of that sort?"
<P>
Then Mr. James B. Coulson, who was getting tired of his part,
suddenly sat up, and a soberer man had never occupied that
particular chair in the Bal Tabarin.
<P>
"And if I have, my young friend," he said calmly, "what the devil
business is it of yours?"
<P>
Mr. Gaynsforth was taken aback and showed it. He recovered
himself as quickly as possible, and realized that he had been
living in a fool's paradise so far as the condition of his
companion was concerned. He realized, also, that the first move
in the game between them had been made and that he had lost.
<P>
"You are too good an actor for me, Mr. Coulson," he said.
"Suppose we get to business."
<P>
"That's all right," Mr. Coulson answered. "Let's go somewhere
where we can get some supper. We'll go to the Abbaye Theleme, and
you shall have the pleasure of entertaining me."
<P>
Mr. Gaynsforth handed back the pocketbook and led the way out of
the place without a word. It was only a few steps up the hill,
and they found themselves then in a supper place of a very
different class. Here Mr. Coulson, after a brief visit to the
lavatory, during which he obliterated all traces of his recent
condition, seated himself at one of the small flower-decked
tables and offered the menu to his new friend.
<P>
"It's up to you to pay," he said, "so you shall choose the
supper. Personally, I'm for a few oysters, a hot bird, and a cold
bottle."
<P>
Mr. Gaynsforth, who was still somewhat subdued, commanded the
best supper procurable on these lines. Mr. Coulson, having waved
his hand to a few acquaintances and chaffed the Spanish dancing
girls in their own language,--not a little to his companion's
astonishment,--at last turned to business.
<P>
"Come," he said, "you and I ought to understand one another. You
are over here from London either to pump me or to rob me. You are
either a detective or a political spy or a secret service agent
of some sort, or you are on a lay of your own. Now, put it in a
business form, what can I do for you? Make your offer, and let's
see where we are."
<P>
Mr. Gaynsforth began to recover himself. It did not follow,
because he had made one mistake, that he was to lose the game.
<P>
"I am neither a detective, Mr. Coulson," he said, "nor a secret
service agent,--in fact, I am nothing of that sort at all. I have
a friend, however, who for certain reasons does not care to
approach you himself, but who is nevertheless very much
interested in a particular event, or rather incident, in which
you are concerned."
<P>
"Good!" Mr. Coulson declared. "Get right on."
<P>
"That friend," Mr. Gaynsforth continued calmly, "is prepared to
pay a thousand pounds for full information and proof as to the
nature of those papers which were stolen from Mr. Hamilton Fynes
on the night of March 22nd."
<P>
"A thousand pounds," Mr. Coulson repeated. "Gee whiz!"
<P>
"He is also," the Englishman continued, "prepared to pay another
thousand for a satisfactory explanation of the murder of Mr.
Richard Vanderpole on the following day.
<P>
"Say, your friend's got the stuff!" Mr. Coulson remarked
admiringly.
<P>
"My friend is not a poor man," Mr. Gaynsforth admitted. "You see,
there's a sort of feeling abroad that these two things are
connected. I am not working on behalf of the police. I am not
working on behalf of any one who desires the least publicity. But
I am working for some one who wants to know and is prepared to
pay."
<P>
"That's a very interesting job you're on, and no mistake," Mr.
Coulson declared. "I wonder you waste time coming over here on
the spree when you've got a piece of business like that to look
after.""I came over here," Mr. Gaynsforth replied, "entirely on
the matter I have mentioned to you."
<P>
"What, over here to Paris?" Mr. Coulson exclaimed.
<P>
"Not only to Paris," the other replied dryly, "but to discover
one Mr. James B. Coulson, whose health I now have the pleasure of
drinking."
<P>
Mr. Coulson drained the glass which the waiter had just filled.
<P>
"Well, this licks me!" he exclaimed. "How any one in their senses
could believe that there was any connection between me and
Hamilton Fynes or that other young swell, I can't imagine."
<P>
"You knew Hamilton Fynes," Mr. Gaynsforth remarked. "That fact
came out at the inquest. You appeared to have known him better
than most men. Mr. Vanderpole had just left you when he was
murdered,--that also came out at the inquest."
<P>
"Kind of queer, wasn't it," Mr. Coulson remarked meditatively,
"how I seemed to get hung up with both of them? You may also
remember that at the inquest Mr. Vanderpole's business with me
was testified to by the chief of his department."
<P>
"Certainly," Mr. Gaynsforth answered. "However, that's neither
here nor there. Everything was properly arranged, so far as you
were concerned, of course. That doesn't alter my friend's
convictions. This is a business matter with me, and if the two
thousand pounds don't sound attractive enough, well, the amount
must be revised, that's all. But I want you to understand this,
Mr. Coulson, I represent a man or a syndicate, or call it what
you will."
<P>
"Call it a Government," Mr. Coulson muttered under his breath.
<P>
"Call it what you will," Mr. Gaynsforth continued, with an air of
not having heard the interruption, "we have the money and we want
the information. You can give it to us if you like. We don't ask
for too much. We don't even ask for the name of the man who
committed these crimes. But we do want to know the nature of
those papers, exactly what position Mr. Hamilton Fynes occupied
in the Stamp and Excise Duty department at Washington, and,
finally, what the mischief you are doing over here in Paris."
<P>
"Have you ordered the supper?" Mr. Coulson inquired anxiously.
<P>
"I have ordered everything you suggested," Mr. Gaynsforth
answered,--"some oysters, a chicken en casserole, lettuce salad,
some cheese, and a magnum of Pommery."
<P>
"It is understood that you are my host?" Mr. Coulson insisted.
<P>
"Absolutely," his companion declared. "I consider it an honor."
<P>
"Then," Mr. Coulson said, pointing out his empty glass to the
SOMMELIER, "we may as well understand one another. To you I am
Mr. James B. Coulson, travelling in patents for woollen
machinery. If you put a quarter of a million of francs upon that
table, I am still Mr. James B. Coulson, travelling in woollen
machinery. And if you add a million to that, and pile up the
notes so high that they touch the ceiling, I remain Mr. James B.
Coulson, travelling in patents for woollen machinery. Now, if
you'll get that firmly into your head and stick to it and believe
it, there's no reason why you and I shouldn't have a pleasant
evening."
<P>
Mr. Gaynsforth, although he was an Englishman and young, showed
himself to be possessed of a sense of humor. He leaned back in
his seat and roared with laughter.
<P>
"Mr. Coulson," he said, "I congratulate you and your employers.
To the lower regions with business! Help yourself to the oysters
and pass the wine."
