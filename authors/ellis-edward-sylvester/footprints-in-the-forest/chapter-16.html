<p>Jack Carleton stealthily pressed his left hand against his breast;
his knife was where he could whip it out when wanted.</p>

<p>Why couldn't he draw it, and leaping forward, bury it in the
side of his captor before he could save himself?</p>

<p>"It will be a dreadful thing," he reflected, compressing his
lips, "but it is the only chance I have; <em>I'll try it!</em>"</p>

<p>He began insinuating his hand under his coat, and groped for
the only weapon on which he could now rely. In his eagerness he
stepped more softly and slightly crouched, as one is apt to do
at such a time.</p>

<p>It may have been that his captor took the lead for a short distance
with a view of tempting him to make some such demonstration; but
more than likely, the excessive caution of the lad betrayed him;
for, before he could draw his knife, the face was turned, and
stepping aside, he motioned Jack to assume the leadership&mdash;that
is, under his direction.</p>

<p>The captive did not think it wise to refuse, but moved promptly
to the front and continued the march in the same direction they
had followed from the first.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he is deaf and dumb," said Jack to himself;
"he acts just as though he had no use of his tongue. Well, I don't
know as it will make any difference, for I can't understand a
word he says, and it isn't likely he knows any thing about English.
But these redskins have a way of talking with their hands, heads
and shoulders which almost any one can comprehend."</p>

<p>The change of positions caused Jack Carleton a new uneasiness.
Having made ready for an attack on the Indian in front, it was
only natural that he should suspect his captor would take the
same course toward him. As indifferently as he could, the youth
again slid his right hand under his coat, until it grasped the
bone-handle of his hunting knife. He held it firmly, and listened
closely for the first movement which would betray the other's
intention.</p>

<p>But the youth erred as to the immediate purpose of the warrior.
He strode along in his deliberate way, stepping in the footprints
of his captive, so as neither to recede from nor approach him.
Less than ten feet intervened between the two.</p>

<p>The couple were so near the river, that, when not able to catch
a glimpse of its shining surface, it was located by the sparseness
of the trees. Jack was so anxious to avoid the stream, that he
began bearing to the left, hoping the individual behind him would
not notice the deviation, but the lad was unwise to think such
a thing possible.</p>

<p>The result of this weak piece of strategy was the proof that
the red man was the owner of a voice.</p>

<p>"<em>Waoof!</em>"</p>

<p>The sound resembled the cough of a wild beast, and startled Jack.
Glancing around, he saw the eyes of the warrior snapping, while
his right arm was extended, and the finger pointing toward the
river.</p>

<p>"All right," responded the lad, as though glad to be reminded
of his forgetfulness; "we won't quarrel over the matter."</p>

<p>Jack, however, was too prudent to make an abrupt turn, which
would bring him to the shore before going more than several rods.
His divergence was perceptible, though the angle was obtuse.</p>

<p>The prisoner was astonished and mystified by what followed, and
it may be said that he never fully understood its meaning.</p>

<p>"The rascal has proven that he has the use of his tongue&mdash;that's
certain. I don't like the idea of keeping in front of him and
leading the way to the river's edge. When we reach that, he can
call to the others and bring over all he wants to help him&mdash;that
is, if he feels he needs the help, which isn't likely. I'll keep
on till we are close to the river, and then I'll make a fight!"</p>

<p>When only a few yards separated him from the river, the warrior
emitted an exclamation precisely like that which first arrested
the footsteps of the youth. He stopped, as before, and awaited
the will of his captor. The latter advanced to the front, and,
while the other stood still, the Indian made his way to the water's
margin, parted the bushes and looked out.</p>

<p>The feature of the movement was its caution. The redskin acted
as if his whole care was to escape being seen by any on the other
side. Why he wished to do so was beyond the power of the youth
to guess.</p>

<p>"They are his friends, and I should think he would want to let
them know of his success."</p>

<p>The warrior stood fully two minutes leaning over the water, one
hand grasping the gun and the other holding the undergrowth apart,
while his eyes roved up and down, as if searching for that which
he expected and yet dreaded to find. He was but a brief distance
below the camp of the Pawnees, who were in sight. The sun had
set and twilight was creeping through the wood and over the river.
Soon objects would become indistinct; but, for a few minutes at
least, it would be to the warrior as if the sun were in the sky.</p>

<p>The view was unsatisfactory, for he drew back, allowing the bushes
to come together, and muttered some impatient expression. Looking
angrily at Jack, he extended his arm and finger so as to point
away from the stream, and signified by gesture that the youth
was to take that course.</p>

<p>"Nothing will suit me better," was the thought of the latter,
as he obeyed; "I don't understand what the mischief you are driving
at, but I am glad to get as far as I can from the river."</p>

<p>As nearly as Jack could judge, this odd march lasted until he
had tramped a hundred yards, when it was terminated by another
emphatic "<em>Waoof!</em>"</p>

<p>They were in the woods, where the trees were close and there
was little undergrowth. So far as could be seen, the nearest water
was the river, but the captor showed that his purpose was to go
into camp, as may be said, for a time at least. He broke off some
dead limbs, threw them on the ground at the base of a large oak,
and motioned to the captive to do the same. Jack's previous experience
had taught him that the wisest course, under such circumstances,
is promptly to obey, and he sprang to work with such vigor that
it did not take him long to collect a large pile. As he always
carried a flint and steel with him, he hoped to conciliate his
captor to a slight extent by starting the fire, though the latter
had also a stone in hand, from which, it is probable, he would
have extracted fire with but little trouble. He stood still and
watched the lad.</p>

<p>It was many years before such a thing as a lucifer match was
known, and our ancestors acquired a deftness in igniting a flame
from the simple contrivance named, which leads us to doubt whether
they gained a great advantage when they threw it aside for the
modern invention.</p>

<p>With the help of dried leaves, small dead twigs, and the swift
blows of the steel across the face of the flint, a spark speedily
darted to the combustible material and stuck there. Jack did not
use the rag soaked in chemicals, which was common among the settlers,
but caught the fire from the direct source, as it may be called.
The tiny twist of flame was fanned and nursed by gently blowing
until, in a brief space, a big fire was roaring, and scorching
the shaggy bark of the oak.</p>

<p>It was impossible to tell from the looks of the Indian whether
he was pleased or not. He stood a few paces off, watching the
operation, and, when the fire was well under way, sat down cross-legged
like a Turk, where he could feel the warmth, though, as I have
stated in another place, the weather was not cold.</p>

<p>It was now growing dark. The shadows were on every hand, and
the trunks of the trees looked grim and ghostly, as revealed by
the fire, which Jack continually fed, until the circle of illumination
was several rods in extent.</p>

<p>"I would give a good deal to know what he is thinking about,"
said the lad to himself, furtively watching the face on the other
side of the fire; "something seems to have gone wrong with him,
though why he should want to keep his movements from his friends
across the river is more than I can guess; may be he has had a
quarrel; they have taken his gun and set him adrift."</p>

<p>This theory, however, did not sound reasonable, and the lad was
unsatisfied; whatever the cause of the redskin's erratic conduct,
his captive could not explain it.</p>

<p>For a half hour the warrior was as mute and motionless as the
oak against which the fire had been kindled. All that time, he
sat six or eight feet from the flames and about the same distance
from the captive. The fire, the Indian and the youth, each formed
the corner of a triangle. He who was master of the situation retained
his Turk-like pose, the captured gun between his arms and knees
and his small eyes fixed on the flames, which the industry of
the prisoner never allowed to grow less.</p>

<p>Strange musings must have stirred within the bronzed skull, but
it is useless to speculate, since we have no more means of knowing
their nature than had Jack Carleton, who wondered and guessed
without satisfying himself.</p>

<p>But one thing was certain: whatever the thoughts of the warrior,
they were of a disturbing nature. Jack could not mistake the scowl
which wrinkled the brow, while now and then an evil light shone
in the eyes.</p>

<p>"He doesn't think of supper, or, if he does, he knows there is
no way of getting any thing to eat. He must make up his mind pretty
soon what he intends to do with <em>me</em>. If he decides to
stay here all night, I know I shan't close my eyes for a single
second."</p>

<p>But the test did not come, and it can not be known, therefore,
what the result would have been. The Indian seemed to rouse all
at once to a sense of the situation, probably concluding that
he was wasting time by indulging in such musings. His awaking
was characteristic. He sprang to his feet, threw his gun aside,
and placed his hand on the knife at his girdle. As he did so,
his countenance flamed with ferocity, and the meaning of the look
he bent on Jack Carleton could not be misjudged.</p>

<p>"It has been decided that mine shall be the same fate as that
of poor Otto," was the thought of Jack, who displayed genuine
Kentucky pluck in facing the peril.</p>

<p>He was only a second or two behind the warrior in bounding to
his feet, and as he came up he whipped out his hunting knife from
under his coat, and confronted his foe. The latter probably was
unaware until then that his captive had a weapon about him, for
otherwise he would have deprived him of it at the muzzle of the
rifle; but surely it would seem he had no cause to fear the youth,
who could not have been his equal in strength, activity or skill
in handling such a weapon, though much his superior in courage.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton was as self-possessed as if he were awaiting a
friendly wrestling bout with Otto Relstaub, though he knew that
the assault meant death to one, and the chances were against himself.</p>

<p>"He will bound like a dog at me," was the thought of Jack, who,
after the manner of a skillful boxer, kept his eye fixed on that
of his foe, in the hope of reading his purpose; "and I will make
believe I am bewildered by his style of attack (and may be I will
be), but I'll jump to one side, as he comes, and, with the help
of heaven, will show what a Kentucky boy can do when cornered."</p>

<p>Just then Jack Carleton smiled, and right good cause had he for
doing so.</p>
