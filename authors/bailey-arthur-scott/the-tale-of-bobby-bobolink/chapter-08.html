<p>BOBBY BOBOLINK and his wife had talked a good deal about the home they
were going to have.
</p>
<p>And unlike some people, who are forever planning things but never begin
the actual doing of them, they soon set to work to build their nest.
</p><p>First, of course, they had to find a pleasant place for it. So they
looked the ground over carefully. Bobby Bobolink favored the exact
center of the big meadow building site, for he said that if Johnnie
Green ever came into the meadow he was more likely to take a short cut
across a corner of it than he was to walk straight through the middle.
</p><p>"You may not know," he said to his wife, "that Farmer Green doesn't care
to have the grass on the farm trampled down."
</p><p>But Mrs. Bobolink replied that there were other things to think of. She
said that she liked to live in a rather moist place--that such a spot
was comfortable in hot weather. And furthermore she wanted to be near
water. "If you need a drink on a warm day it's not always convenient to
go far out of your way for it," she pointed out.
</p><p>Well, Bobby Bobolink saw at once that Mrs. Bobolink had made up her
mind, and there was no use trying to change it. Besides, he wanted to
please her.
</p><p>"Then, my dear, where would you like to have our house built?" he
asked.
</p><p>"I should prefer to settle in the lower end of the meadow, near Cedar
Swamp," she replied. "The ground thereabouts is just damp enough to suit
me. And there's always plenty of water to drink in the swamp....
Besides," she added, "it's somewhat marshy in that part of the meadow.
</p><p>"And you won't find Johnny Green trespassing down there. He might get
his feet wet!"
</p><p>Bobby Bobolink turned his head away so that his wife wouldn't notice the
smile that flitted across his face. He saw that Mrs. Bobolink didn't
know Johnnie Green very well.
</p><p>In summer Johnnie almost always went barefooted. And he never minded
getting his feet wet any more than Paddy Muskrat did.
</p><p>But if his wife wanted their nest near the swamp, Bobby Bobolink was
willing to oblige her.
</p><p>"Very well!" he said. "Let's go down there now and look for the best
place to build."
</p><p>So off they flew. And after a careful search they discovered a snug
little hollow in the ground that entirely suited them both.
</p><p>Since the spot was somewhat moist, early in the season as it was the
grass grew thick and high all around, making a fine screen to prevent
prying eyes from seeing what was to be hidden there.
</p><p>Having decided on their building site, Bobby Bobolink and his wife began
to gather weed stems, leaves and coarse grasses, all left over from the
year before and dried by the spring sunshine. Those served for the
outside of the nest. As for the inside, they lined that with soft, fine
grasses, because they expected to keep something precious in that nest
before a great while.
