<P>
Tarzan of the Apes, returning from a successful hunt, with
the body of Bara, the deer, across one sleek, brown shoul-
der, paused in the branches of a great tree at the edge of
a clearing and gazed ruefully at two figures walking from the
river to the boma-encircled hut a short distance away.
<P>
The ape-man shook his tousled head and sighed. His eyes
wandered toward the west and his thoughts to the far-away
cabin by the land-locked harbor of the great water that washed
the beach of his boyhood home -- to the cabin of his long-dead
father to which the memories and treasures of a happy child-
hood lured him. Since the loss of his mate, a great longing had
possessed him to return to the haunts of his youth -- to the
untracked jungle wilderness where he had lived the life he
loved best long before man had invaded the precincts of his
wild stamping grounds. There he hoped in a renewal of the
old life under the old conditions to win surcease from sorrow
and perhaps some measure of forgetfulness.
<P>
But the little cabin and the land-locked harbor were many
long, weary marches away, and he was handicapped by the
duty which he felt he owed to the two figures walking in the
clearing before him. One was a young man in a worn and
ragged uniform of the British Royal Air Forces, the other, a
young woman in the even more disreputable remnants of what
once had been trim riding togs.
<P>
A freak of fate had thrown these three radically different
types together. One was a savage, almost naked beast-man,
one an English army officer, and the woman, she whom the
ape-man knew and hated as a German spy.
<P>
How he was to get rid of them Tarzan could not imagine
unless he accompanied them upon the weary march back to
the east coast, a march that would necessitate his once more
retracing the long, weary way he already had covered towards
his goal, yet what else could be done? These two had neither
the strength, endurance, nor jungle-craft to accompany him
through the unknown country to the west, nor did he wish
them with him. The man he might have tolerated, but he could
not even consider the presence of the girl in the far-off cabin,
which had in a way become sacred to him through its mem-
ories, without a growl or anger rising to his lips. There re-
mained, then, but the one way, since he could not desert them.
He must move by slow and irksome marches back to the east
coast, or at least to the first white settlement in that
direction.
<P>
He had, it is true, contemplated leaving the girl to her fate
but that was before she had been instrumental in saving him
from torture and death at the hands of the black Wamabos.
He chafed under the obligation she had put upon him, but no
less did he acknowledge it and as he watched the two, the
rueful expression upon his face was lightened by a smile as
he thought of the helplessness of them. What a puny thing,
indeed, was man! How ill equipped to combat the savage forces
of nature and of nature's jungle. Why, even the tiny balu of
the tribe of Go-lat, the great ape, was better fitted to survive
than these, for a balu could at least escape the numerous crea-
tures that menaced its existence, while with the possible excep-
tion of Kota, the tortoise, none moved so slowly as did helpless
and feeble man.
<P>
Without him these two doubtless would starve in the midst
of plenty, should they by some miracle escape the other forces
of destruction which constantly threatened them. That morning
Tarzan had brought them fruit, nuts, and plantain, and now
he was bringing them the flesh of his kill, while the best that
they might do was to fetch water from the river. Even now, as
they walked across the clearing toward the boma, they were in
utter ignorance of the presence of Tarzan near them. They did
not know that his sharp eyes were watching them, nor that
other eyes less friendly were glaring at them from a clump of
bushes close beside the boma entrance. They did not know
these things, but Tarzan did. No more than they could he see
the creature crouching in the concealment of the foliage, yet
he knew that it was there and what it was and what its inten-
tions, precisely as well as though it had been lying in the open.
<P>
A slight movement of the leaves at the top of a single stem
had apprised him of the presence of a creature there, for the
movement was not that imparted by the wind. It came from
pressure at the bottom of the stem which communicates a dif-
ferent movement to the leaves than does the wind passing
among them, as anyone who has lived his lifetime in the jun-
gle well knows, and the same wind that passed through the
foliage of the bush brought to the ape-man's sensitive nos-
trils indisputable evidence of the fact that Sheeta, the panther,
waited there for the two returning from the river.
<P>
They had covered half the distance to the boma entrance
when Tarzan called to them to stop. They looked in surprise
in the direction from which his voice had come to see him
drop lightly to the ground and advance toward them.
<P>
"Come slowly toward me," he called to them. "Do not run
for if you run Sheeta will charge."
<P>
They did as he bid, their faces filled with questioning won-
derment.
<P>
"What do you mean?" asked the young Englishman. "Who
is Sheeta?" but for answer the ape-man suddenly hurled
the carcass of Bara, the deer, to the ground and leaped quickly
toward them, his eyes upon something in their rear; and then
it was that the two turned and learned the identity of Sheeta,
for behind them was a devil-faced cat charging rapidly toward
them.
<P>
Sheeta with rising anger and suspicion had seen the ape-man
leap from the tree and approach the quarry. His life's expe-
riences backed by instinct told him that the Tarmangani was
about to rob him of his prey and as Sheeta was hungry, he had
no intention of being thus easily deprived of the flesh he al-
ready considered his own.
<P>
The girl stifled an involuntary scream as she saw the prox-
imity of the fanged fury bearing down upon them. She shrank
close to the man and clung to him and all unarmed and de-
fenseless as he was, the Englishman pushed her behind him
and shielding her with his body, stood squarely in the face of
the panther's charge. Tarzan noted the act, and though accus-
tomed as he was to acts of courage, he experienced a thrill
from the hopeless and futile bravery of the man.
<P>
The charging panther moved rapidly, and the distance which
separated the bush in which he had concealed himself from the
objects of his desire was not great. In the time that one might
understandingly read a dozen words the strong-limbed cat
could have covered the entire distance and made his kill, yet
if Sheeta was quick, quick too was Tarzan. The English lieu-
tenant saw the ape-man flash by him like the wind. He saw
the great cat veer in his charge as though to elude the naked
savage rushing to meet him, as it was evidently Sheeta's inten-
tion to make good his kill before attempting to protect it from
Tarzan.
<P>
Lieutenant Smith-Oldwick saw these things and then with
increasing wonder he saw the ape-man swerve, too, and leap
for the spotted cat as a football player leaps for a runner. He
saw the strong, brown arms encircling the body of the car-
nivore, the left arm in front of the beast's left shoulder and
the right arm behind his right foreleg, and with the impact the
two together rolling over and over upon the turf. He heard
the snarls and growls of bestial combat, and it was with a feel-
ing of no little horror that he realized that the sounds com-
ing from the human throat of the battling man could scarce
be distinguished from those of the panther.
<P>
The first momentary shock of terror over, the girl released
her grasp upon the Englishman's arm. "Cannot we do some-
thing?" she asked. "Cannot we help him before the beast
kills him?"
<P>
The Englishman looked upon the ground for some missile
with which to attack the panther and then the girl uttered an
exclamation and started at a run toward the hut. "Wait there,"
she called over her shoulder. "I will fetch the spear that he
left
me."
<P>
Smith-Oldwick saw the raking talons of the panther search-
ing for the flesh of the man and the man on his part straining
every muscle and using every artifice to keep his body out of
range of them. The muscles of his arms knotted under the
brown hide. The veins stood out upon his neck and forehead
as with ever-increasing power he strove to crush the life from
the great cat. The ape-man's teeth were fastened in the back
of Sheeta's neck and now he succeeded in encircling the beast's
torso with his legs which he crossed and locked beneath the
cat's belly. Leaping and snarling, Sheeta sought to dislodge
the ape-man's hold upon him. He hurled himself upon the
ground and rolled over and over. He reared upon his hind
legs and threw himself backwards but always the savage
creature upon his back clung tenaciously to him, and always
the mighty brown arms crushed tighter and tighter about his
chest.
<P>
And then the girl, panting from her quick run, returned with
the short spear Tarzan had left her as her sole weapon of pro-
tection. She did not wait to hand it to the Englishman who
ran forward to receive it, but brushed past him and leaped
into close quarters beside the growling, tumbling mass of yel-
low fur and smooth brown hide. Several times she attempted
to press the point home into the cat's body, but on both occa-
sions the fear of endangering the ape-man caused her to de-
sist, but at last the two lay motionless for a moment as the
carnivore sought a moment's rest from the strenuous exertions
of battle, and then it was that Bertha Kircher pressed the point
of the spear to the tawny side and drove it deep into the savage
heart.
<P>
Tarzan rose from the dead body of Sheeta and shook him-
self after the manner of beasts that are entirely clothed with
hair. Like many other of his traits and mannerisms this was
the result of environment rather than heredity or reversion, and
even though he was outwardly a man, the Englishman and
the girl were both impressed with the naturalness of the act.
It was as though Numa, emerging from a fight, had shaken
himself to straighten his rumpled mane and coat, and yet, too,
there was something uncanny about it as there had been when
the savage growls and hideous snarls issued from those clean-
cut lips.
<P>
Tarzan looked at the girl, a quizzical expression upon his
face. Again had she placed him under obligations to her, and
Tarzan of the Apes did not wish to be obligated to a German
spy; yet in his honest heart he could not but admit a certain
admiration for her courage, a trait which always greatly im-
pressed the ape-man, he himself the personification of courage.
<P>
"Here is the kill," he said, picking the carcass of Bara from
the ground. "You will want to cook your portion, I presume,
but Tarzan does not spoil his meat with fire."
<P>
They followed him to the boma where he cut several pieces
of meat from the carcass for them, retaining a joint for him-
self. The young lieutenant prepared a fire, and the girl pre-
sided over the primitive culinary rights of their simple meal.
As she worked some little way apart from them, the lieuten-
ant and the ape-man watched her.
<P>
"She is wonderful. Is she not?" murmured Smith-Oldwick.
<P>
"She is a German and a spy," replied Tarzan.
<P>
The Englishman turned quickly upon him. "What do you
mean?" he cried.
<P>
"I mean what I say," replied the ape-man. "She is a German
and a spy."
<P>
"I do not believe it!" exclaimed the aviator.
<P>
"You do not have to," Tarzan assured him. "It is nothing to
me what you believe. I saw her in conference with the Boche
general and his staff at the camp near Taveta. They all knew
her and called her by name and she handed him a paper. The
next time I saw her she was inside the British lines in disguise,
and again I saw her bearing word to a German officer at
Wilhelmstal. She is a German and a spy, but she is a woman
and therefore I cannot destroy her."
<P>
"You really believe that what you say is true?" asked the
young lieutenant. "My God! I cannot believe it. She is so sweet
and brave and good."
<P>
The ape-man shrugged his shoulders. "She is brave," he
said, "but even Pamba, the rat, must have some good quality,
but she is what I have told you and therefore I hate her and
you should hate her."
<P>
Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick buried his face in
his hands. "God forgive me," he said at last. "I cannot hate
her."
<P>
The ape-man cast a contemptuous look at his companion
and arose. "Tarzan goes again to hunt," he said. "You have
enough food for two days. By that time he will return."
<P>
The two watched him until he had disappeared in the foliage
of the trees at the further side of the clearing.
<P>
When he had gone the girl felt a vague sense of apprehen-
sion that she never experienced when Tarzan was present. The
invisible menaces lurking in the grim jungle seemed more real
and much more imminent now that the ape-man was no longer
near. While he had been there talking with them, the little
thatched hut and its surrounding thorn boma had seemed as
safe a place as the world might afford. She wished that he had
remained -- two days seemed an eternity in contemplation --
two days of constant fear, two days, every moment of which
would be fraught with danger. She turned toward her com-
panion.
<P>
"I wish that he had remained," she said. "I always feel so
much safer when he is near. He is very grim and very terrible,
and yet I feel safer with him than with any man I ever have
known. He seems to dislike me and yet I know that he would
let no harm befall me. I cannot understand him."
<P>
"Neither do I understand him," replied the Englishman;
"but I know this much -- our presence here is interfering with
his plans. He would like to be rid of us, and I half imagine
that he rather hopes to find when he returns that we have
succumbed to one of the dangers which must always confront
us in this savage land.
<P>
"I think that we should try to return to the white settle-
ments. This man does not want us here, nor is it reasonable
to assume that we could long survive in such a savage wilder-
ness. I have traveled and hunted in several parts of Africa,
but never have I seen or heard of any single locality so over-
run with savage beasts and dangerous natives. If we set out
for the east coast at once we would be in but little more danger
than we are here, and if we could survive a day's march, I
believe that we will find the means of reaching the coast in a
few hours, for my plane must still be in the same place that
I landed just before the blacks captured me. Of course there
is no one here who could operate it nor is there any reason
why they should have destroyed it. As a matter of fact, the
natives would be so fearful and suspicious of so strange and
incomprehensible a thing that the chances are they would not
dare approach it. Yes, it must be where I left it and all ready
to carry us safely to the settlements."
<P>
"But we cannot leave," said the girl, "until he returns. We
could not go away like that without thanking him or bidding
him farewell. We are under too great obligations to him."
<P>
The man looked at her in silence for a moment. He won-
dered if she knew how Tarzan felt toward her and then he
himself began to speculate upon the truth of the ape-man's
charges. The longer he looked at the girl, the less easy was
it to entertain the thought that she was an enemy spy. He was
upon the point of asking her point-blank but he could not bring
himself to do so, finally determining to wait until time and
longer acquaintance should reveal the truth or falsity of the
accusation.
<P>
"I believe," he said as though there had been no pause in
their conversation, "that the man would be more than glad
to find us gone when he returns. It is not necessary to jeop-
ardize our lives for two more days in order that we may thank
him, however much we may appreciate his services to us. You
have more than balanced your obligations to him and from
what he told me I feel that you especially should not remain
here longer."
<P>
The girl looked up at him in astonishment. "What do you
mean?" she asked.
<P>
"I do not like to tell," said the Englishman, digging nerv-
ously at the turf with the point of a stick, "but you have my
word that he would rather you were not here."
<P>
"Tell me what he said," she insisted, "I have a right to
know."
<P>
Lieutenant Smith-Oldwick squared his shoulders and raised
his eyes to those of the girl. "He said that he hated you," he
blurted. "He has only aided you at all from a sense of duty
because you are a woman."
<P>
The girl paled and then flushed. "I will be ready to go,"
she said, "in just a moment. We had better take some of this
meat with us. There is no telling when we will be able to get
more."
<P>
And so the two set out down the river toward the south.
The man carried the short spear that Tarzan had left with
the girl, while she was entirely unarmed except for a stick
she had picked up from among those left after the building of
the hut. Before departing she had insisted that the man leave
a note for Tarzan thanking him for his care of them and
bidding him goodbye. This they left pinned to the inside wall of
the hut with a little sliver of wood.
<P>
It was necessary that they be constantly on the alert since
they never knew what might confront them at the next turn
of the winding jungle trail or what might lie concealed in the
tangled bushes at either side. There was also the ever-present
danger of meeting some of Numabo's black warriors and as
the village lay directly in their line of march, there was the
necessity for making a wide detour before they reached it in
order to pass around it without being discovered.
<P>
"I am not so much afraid of the native blacks," said the girl,
"as I am of Usanga and his people. He and his men were all
attached to a German native regiment. They brought me
along with them when they deserted, either with the inten-
tion of holding me ransom or selling me into the harem
of one of the black sultans of the north. Usanga is much
more to be feared than Numabo for he has had the advantage
of European military training and is armed with more or less
modern weapons and ammunition."
<P>
"It is lucky for me," remarked the Englishman, "that it was
the ignorant Numabo who discovered and captured me rather
than the worldly wise Usanga. He would have felt less fear
of the giant flying machine and would have known only too
well how to wreck it."
<P>
"Let us pray that the black sergeant has not discovered it,"
said the girl.
<P>
They made their way to a point which they guessed was
about a mile above the village, then they turned into the
trackless tangle of undergrowth to the east. So dense was the
verdure at many points that it was with the utmost difficulty
they wormed their way through, sometimes on hands and
knees and again by clambering over numerous fallen tree
trunks. Interwoven with dead limbs and living branches were
the tough and ropelike creepers which formed a tangled net-
work across their path.
<P>
South of them in an open meadowland a number of black
warriors were gathered about an object which elicited much
wondering comment. The blacks were clothed in fragments
of what had once been uniforms of a native German com-
mand. They were a most unlovely band and chief among
them in authority and repulsiveness was the black sergeant
Usanga. The object of their interest was a British aeroplane.
<P>
Immediately after the Englishman had been brought to
Numabo's village Usanga had gone out in search of the plane,
prompted partially by curiosity and partially by an intention
to destroy it, but when he had found it, some new thought had
deterred him from carrying out his design. The thing repre-
sented considerable value as he well knew and it had occurred
to him that in some way he might turn his prize to profit.
Every day he had returned to it, and while at first it had filled
him with considerable awe, he eventually came to look upon
it with the accustomed eye of a proprietor, so that he now
clambered into the fuselage and even advanced so far as to
wish that he might learn to operate it.
<P>
What a feat it would be indeed to fly like a bird far above
the highest tree top! How it would fill his less favored com-
panions with awe and admiration! If Usanga could but fly,
so great would be the respect of all the tribesmen throughout
the scattered villages of the great interior, they would look
upon him as little less than a god.
<P>
Usanga rubbed his palms together and smacked his thick
lips. Then indeed, would he be very rich, for all the villages
would pay tribute to him and he could even have as many as
a dozen wives. With that thought, however, came a mental
picture of Naratu, the black termagant, who ruled him with
an iron hand. Usanga made a wry face and tried to forget
the extra dozen wives, but the lure of the idea remained and
appealed so strongly to him that he presently found himself
reasoning most logically that a god would not be much of a
god with less than twenty-four wives.
<P>
He fingered the instruments and the control, half hoping
and half fearing that he would alight upon the combination
that would put the machine in flight. Often had he watched
the British air-men soaring above the German lines and it
looked so simple he was quite sure that he could do it him-
self if there was somebody who could but once show him
how. There was, of course, always the hope that the white
man who came in the machine and who had escaped from
Numabo's village might fall into Usanga's hands and then
indeed would he be able to learn how to fly. It was in this hope
that Usanga spent so much time in the vicinity of the plane,
reasoning as he did that eventually the white man would
return in search of it.
<P>
And at last he was rewarded, for upon this very day after
he had quit the machine and entered the jungle with his war-
riors, he heard voices to the north and when he and his men
had hidden in the dense foliage upon either side of the trail,
Usanga was presently filled with elation by the appearance of
the British officer and the white girl whom the black sergeant
had coveted and who had escaped him.
<P>
The Negro could scarce restrain a shout of elation, for he
had not hoped that fate would be so kind as to throw these
two whom he most desired into his power at the same time.
<P>
As the two came down the trail all unconscious of impending
danger, the man was explaining that they must be very close
to the point at which the plane had landed. Their entire
attention was centered on the trail directly ahead of them, as
they momentarily expected it to break into the meadowland
where they were sure they would see the plane that would
spell life and liberty for them.
<P>
The trail was broad, and they were walking side by side
so that at a sharp turn the parklike clearing was revealed to
them simultaneously with the outlines of the machine they
sought.
<P>
Exclamations of relief and delight broke from their lips, and
at the same instant Usanga and his black warriors rose from
the bushes all about them.
