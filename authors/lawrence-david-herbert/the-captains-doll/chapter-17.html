<p>In the hotel was a buzz of tourists.  Alexander and Hannele sat in
the restaurant drinking hot coffee and milk, and watching the
maidens in cotton frocks and aprons and bare arms, and the fair
youths with maidenly necks and huge voracious boots, and the many
Jews of the wrong sort and the wrong shape.  These Jews were all
being very Austrian, in Tyrol costume that didn't sit on them,
assuming the whole gesture and intonation of aristocratic Austria,
so that you might think they WERE Austrian aristocrats, if you
weren't properly listening, or if you didn't look twice.  Certainly
they were lords of the Alps, or at least lords of the Alpine hotels
this summer, let prejudice be what it might.  Jews of the wrong
sort.  And yet even they imparted a wholesome breath of sanity,
disillusion, unsentimentality to the excited 'Bergheil' atmosphere.
Their dark-eyed, sardonic presence seemed to say to the maidenly-
necked mountain youths:  'Don't sprout wings of the spirit too
much, my dears.'</p>

<p>The rain had ceased.  There was a wisp of sunshine from a grey sky.
Alexander left the knapsack, and the two went out into the air.
Before them lay the last level of the up-climb, the Lammerboden.
It was a rather gruesome hollow between the peaks, a last shallow
valley about a mile long.  At the end the enormous static stream of
the glacier poured in from the blunt mountain-top of ice.  The ice
was dull, sullen-coloured, melted on the surface by the very hot
summer: and so it seemed a huge, arrested, sodden flood, ending in
a wave-wall of stone-speckled ice upon the valley bed of rocky
d&eacute;bris.  A gruesome descent of stone and blocks of rock, the little
valley bed, with a river raving through.  On the left rose the grey
rock, but the glacier was there, sending down great paws of ice.
It was like some great, deep-furred ice-bear lying spread upon the
top heights, and reaching down terrible paws of ice into the
valley: like some immense sky-bear fishing in the earth's solid
hollows from above.  Hepburn it just filled with terror.  Hannele
too it scared, but it gave her a sense of ecstasy.  Some of the
immense, furrowed paws of ice held down between the rock were vivid
blue in colour, but of a frightening, poisonous blue, like crystal
copper sulphate.  Most of the ice was a sullen, semi-translucent
greeny grey.</p>

<p>The two set off to walk through the massy, desolate stone-bed,
under rocks and over waters, to the main glacier.  The flowers were
even more beautiful on this last reach.  Particularly the dark
harebells were large and almost black and ice-metallic: one could
imagine they gave a dull ice-chink.  And the grass of Parnassus
stood erect, white-veined big cups held terribly naked and open to
their ice air.</p>

<p>From behind the great blunt summit of ice that blocked the distance
at the end of the valley, a pale-grey, woolly mist or cloud was
fusing up, exhaling huge, like some grey-dead aura into the sky,
and covering the top of the glacier.  All the way along the valley
people were threading, strangely insignificant, among the grey
dishevel of stone and rock, like insects.  Hannele and Alexander
went ahead quickly, along the tiring track.</p>

<p>'Are you glad now that you came?' she said, looking at him
triumphant.</p>

<p>'Very glad I came,' he said.  His eyes were dilated with excitement
that was ordeal or mystic battle rather than the Bergheil ecstasy.
The curious vibration of his excitement made the scene strange,
rather horrible to her.  She too shuddered.  But it still seemed to
her to hold the key to all glamour and ecstasy, the great silent,
living glacier.  It seemed to her like a grand beast.</p>

<p>As they came near they saw the wall of ice: the glacier end, thick
crusted and speckled with stone and dirt debris.  From underneath,
secret in stones, water rushed out.  When they came quite near,
they saw the great monster was sweating all over, trickles and
rivulets of sweat running down his sides of pure, slush-translucent
ice.  There it was, the glacier, ending abruptly in the wall of ice
under which they stood.  Near to, the ice was pure, but water-
logged, all the surface rather rotten from the hot summer.  It was
sullenly translucent, and of a watery, darkish bluey-green colour.
But near the earth it became again bright coloured, gleams of green
like jade, gleams of blue like thin, pale sapphire, in little
caverns above the wet stones where the walls trickled for ever.</p>

<p>Alexander wanted to climb on to the glacier.  It was his one
desire - to stand upon it.  So under the pellucid wet wall they
toiled among rock upwards, to where the guide-track mounted the
ice.  Several other people were before them - mere day tourists - and
all uncertain about venturing any farther.  For the ice-slope rose
steep and slithery, pure, sun-locked, sweating ice.  Still, it was
like a curved back.  One could scramble on to it, and on up to the
first level, like the flat on top of some huge paw.</p>

<p>There stood the little cluster of people, facing the uphill of
sullen, pure, sodden-looking ice.  They were all afraid: naturally.
But being human, they all wanted to go beyond their fear.  It was
strange that the ice looked so pure, like flesh.  Not bright,
because the surface was soft like a soft, deep epidermis.  But pure
ice away down to immense depths.</p>

<p>Alexander, after some hesitation, began gingerly to try the ice.
He was frightened of it.  And he had no stick, and only smooth-
soled boots.  But he had a great desire to stand on the glacier.
So, gingerly and shakily, he began to struggle a few steps up the
pure slope.  The ice was soft on the surface, he could kick his
heel in it and get a little sideways grip.  So, staggering and
going sideways he got up a few yards, and was on the naked ice-
slope.</p>

<p>Immediately the youths and the fat man below began to tackle it
too: also two maidens.  For some time, however, Alexander gingerly
and scramblingly led the way.  The slope of ice was steeper, and
rounded, so that it was difficult to stand up in any way.
Sometimes he slipped, and was clinging with burnt finger-ends to
the soft ice mass.  Then he tried throwing his coat down, and
getting a foot-hold on that.  Then he went quite quickly by bending
down and getting a little grip with his fingers, and going
ridiculously as on four legs.</p>

<p>Hannele watched from below, and saw the ridiculous exhibition, and
was frightened and amused, but more frightened.  And she kept
calling, to the great joy of the Austrians down below:</p>

<p>'Come back.  Do come back.'</p>

<p>But when he got on to his feet again he only waved his hand at her,
half crossly, as she stood away down there in her blue frock.  The
other fellows with sticks and nail-boots had now taken heart and
were scrambling like crabs past our hero, doing better than he.</p>

<p>He had come to a rift in the ice.  He sat near the edge and looked
down.  Clean, pure ice, fused with pale colour, and fused into
intense copper-sulphate blue away down in the crack.  It was not
like crystal, but fused as one fuses a borax bead under a blow-
flame.  And keenly, wickedly blue in the depths of the crack.</p>

<p>He looked upwards.  He had not half mounted the slope.  So on he
went, upon the huge body of the soft-fleshed ice, slanting his way
sometimes on all fours, sometimes using his coat, usually hitting-
in with the side of his heel.  Hannele down below was crying him to
come back.  But two other youths were now almost level with him.</p>

<p>So he struggled on till he was more or less over the brim.  There
he stood and looked at the ice.  It came down from above in a great
hollow world of ice.  A world, a terrible place of hills and
valleys and slopes, all motionless, all of ice.  Away above the
grey mist-cloud was looming bigger.  And near at hand were long,
huge cracks, side by side, like gills in the ice.  It would seem as
if the ice breathed through these great ridged gills.  One could
look down into the series of gulfs, fearful depths, and the colour
burning that acid, intense blue, intenser as the crack went deeper.
And the crests of the open gills ridged and grouped pale blue above
the crevices.  It seemed as if the ice breathed there.</p>

<p>The wonder, the terror, and the bitterness of it.  Never a warm
leaf to unfold, never a gesture of life to give off.  A world
sufficient unto itself in lifelessness, all this ice.</p>

<p>He turned to go down, though the youths were passing beyond him.
And seeing the naked translucent ice heaving downwards in a vicious
curve, always the same dark translucency underfoot, he was afraid.
If he slipped, he would certainly slither the whole way down, and
break some of his bones.  Even when he sat down he had to cling
with his finger-nails in the ice, because if he had started to
slide he would have slid the whole way down on his trouser-seat,
precipitously, and have landed heaven knows how.</p>

<p>Hannele was watching from below.  And he was frightened, perched,
seated on the shoulder of ice and not knowing how to get off.
Above he saw the great blue gills of ice ridging the air.  Down
below were two blue cracks - then the last wet level claws of ice
upon the stones.  And there stood Hannele and the three or four
people who had got so far.</p>

<p>However, he found that by striking in his heels sideways with
sufficient sharpness he could keep his footing, no matter how steep
the slope.  So he started to jerk his way zig-zag downwards.</p>

<p>As he descended, arrived a guide with a black beard and all the
paraphernalia of ropes and pole and bristling boots.  He and his
gentlemen began to strike their way up the ice.  With those
bristling nails like teeth in one's boots, it was quite easy: and a
pole to press on to.</p>

<p>Hannele, who had got sick of waiting, and who was also frightened,
had gone scuttling on the return journey.  He hurried after her,
thankful to be off the ice, but excited and gratified.  Looking
round, he saw the guide and the men on the ice watching the ice-
world and the weather.  Then they too turned to come down.  The day
wasn't safe.</p>
