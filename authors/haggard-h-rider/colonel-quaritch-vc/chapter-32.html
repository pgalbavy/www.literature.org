<p>Six weeks passed, and in that time several things happened. In the first
place the miserly old banker, Edward Cossey's father, had died, his
death being accelerated by the shock of his son's accident. On his will
being opened, it was found that property and money to no less a value
than 600,000 pounds passed under it to Edward absolutely, the only
condition attached being that he should continue in the house of Cossey
and Son and leave a certain share of his fortune in the business.
</p><p>Edward Cossey also, thanks chiefly to Belle's tender nursing, had almost
recovered, with one exception--he was, and would be for life, stone deaf
in the right ear. The paralysis which the doctors feared had not shown
itself. One of his first questions when he became convalescent was
addressed to Belle Quest.
</p><p>As in a dream, he had always seen her sweet face hanging over him, and
dimly known that she was ministering to him.
</p><p>"Have you nursed me ever since the accident, Belle?" he said.
</p><p>"Yes," she answered.
</p><p>"It is very good of you, considering all things," he murmured. "I wonder
that you did not let me die."
</p><p>But she turned her face to the wall and never said a word, nor did any
further conversation on these matters pass between them.
</p><p>Then as his strength came back so did his passion for Ida de la Molle
revive. He was not allowed to write or even receive letters, and with
this explanation of her silence he was fain to content himself. But
the Squire, he was told, often called to inquire after him, and once or
twice Ida came with him.
</p><p>At length a time came--it was two days after he had been told of his
father's death--when he was pronounced fit to be moved into his own
rooms and to receive his correspondence as usual.
</p><p>The move was effected without any difficulty, and here Belle bade him
good-bye. Even as she did so George drove his fat pony up to the
door, and getting down gave a letter to the landlady, with particular
instructions that it was to be delivered into Mr. Cossey's own hands. As
she passed Belle saw that it was addressed in the Squire's handwriting.
</p><p>When it was delivered to him Edward Cossey opened it with eagerness. It
contained an inclosure in Ida's writing, and this he read first. It ran
as follows:
</p>
<p> "Dear Mr. Cossey,--<br/>
 "I am told that you are now able to read letters, so I hasten to
  write to you. First of all, let me say how thankful I am that you
  are in a fair way to complete recovery from your dreadful
  accident. And now I must tell you what I fear will be almost as
  painful to you to read as it is for me to write, namely, that the
  engagement between us is at an end. To put the matter frankly, you
  will remember that I rightly or wrongly became engaged to you on a
  certain condition. That condition has not been fulfilled, for Mr.
  Quest, to whom the mortgages on my father's property have been
  transferred by you, is pressing for their payment. Consequently
  the obligation on my part is at an end, and with it the engagement
  must end also, for I grieve to tell you that it is not one which
  my personal inclination will induce me to carry out. Wishing you a
  speedy and complete recovery, and every happiness and prosperity
  in your future life, believe me, dear Mr. Cossey,
</p><pre>
                                     "Very truly yours,
                                                 "Ida de la Molle."</pre>

<p>He put down this uncompromising and crushing epistle and nervously
glanced at the Squire's, which was very short.
</p>
<p> "My dear Cossey," it began,--<br/>
 "Ida has shown me the inclosed letter. I think that you did unwisely
  when you entered into what must be called a money bargain for my
  daughter's hand. Whether under all the circumstances she does
  either well or wisely to repudiate the engagement after it has
  once been agreed upon, is not for me to judge. She is a free agent
  and has a natural right to dispose of her life as she thinks fit.
  This being so I have of course no option but to endorse her
  decision, so far as I have anything to do with the matter. It is a
  decision which I for some reasons regret, but which I am quite
  powerless to alter.
</p><pre>
                             "Believe me, with kind regards,
                                        "Truly yours,
                                               "James de la Molle."</pre>

<p>Edward Cossey turned his face to the wall and indulged in such
meditations as the occasion gave rise to, and they were bitter enough.
He was as bent upon this marriage as he had ever been, more so in fact,
now that his father was out of the way. He knew that Ida disliked him,
he had known that all along, but he had trusted to time and marriage to
overcome the dislike. And now that accursed Quest had brought about the
ruin of his hopes. Ida had seen her chance of escape, and, like a bold
woman, had seized upon it. There was one ray of hope, and one only. He
knew that the money would not be forthcoming to pay off the mortgages.
He could see too from the tone of the Squire's letter that he did not
altogether approve of his daughter's decision. And his father was dead.
Like Caesar, he was the master of many legions, or rather of much money,
which is as good as legions. Money can make most paths smooth to the
feet of the traveller, and why not this? After much thought he came to
a conclusion. He would not trust his chance to paper, he would plead his
cause in person. So he wrote a short note to the Squire acknowledging
Ida's and his letter, and saying that he hoped to come and see them as
soon as ever the doctor would allow him out of doors.
</p><p>Meanwhile George, having delivered his letter, had gone upon another
errand. Pulling up the fat pony in front of Mr. Quest's office he
alighted and entered. Mr. Quest was disengaged, and he was shown
straight into the inner office, where the lawyer sat, looking more
refined and gentlemanlike than ever.
</p><p>"How do you do, George?" he said cheerily; "sit down; what is it?"
</p><p>"Well, sir," answered that lugubrious worthy, as he awkwardly took a
seat, "the question is what isn't it? These be rum times, they be, they
fare to puzzle a man, they du."
</p><p>"Yes," said Mr. Quest, balancing a quill pen on his finger, "the times
are bad enough."
</p><p>Then came a pause.
</p><p>"Dash it all, sir," went on George presently, "I may as well get it out;
I hev come to speak to you about the Squire's business."
</p><p>"Yes," said Mr. Quest.
</p><p>"Well, sir," went on George, "I'm told that these dratted mortgages hev
passed into your hands, and that you hev called in the money."
</p><p>"Yes, that is correct," said Mr. Quest again.
</p><p>"Well, sir, the fact is that the Squire can't git the money. It can't be
had nohow. Nobody won't take the land as security. It might be so much
water for all folk to look at it."
</p><p>"Quite so. Land is in very bad odour as security now."
</p><p>"And that being so, sir, what is to be done?"
</p><p>Mr. Quest shrugged his shoulders. "I do not know. If the money is not
forthcoming, of course I shall, however unwillingly, be forced to take
my legal remedy."
</p><p>"Meaning, sir----"
</p><p>"Meaning that I shall bring an action for foreclosure and do what I can
with the lands."
</p><p>George's face darkened.
</p><p>"And that reads, sir, that the Squire and Miss Ida will be turned out of
Honham, where they and theirs hev been for centuries, and that you will
turn in?"
</p><p>"Well, that is what it comes to, George. I am sincerely sorry to press
the Squire, but it's a matter of thirty thousand pounds, and I am not in
a position to throw away thirty thousand pounds."
</p><p>"Sir," said George, rising in indignation, "I don't rightly know how you
came by them there mortgages. There is some things as laryers know and
honest men don't know, and that's one on them. But it seems that you've
got 'em and are a-going to use 'em--and that being so, Mr. Quest, I have
summut to say to you--and that is that no good won't come to you from
this here move."
</p><p>"What do you mean by that, George?" said the lawyer sharply.
</p><p>"Niver you mind what I mean, sir. I means what I says. I means that
sometimes people has things in their lives snugged away where nobody
can't see 'em, things as quiet as though they was dead and buried, and
that ain't dead nor buried neither, things so much alive that they fare
as though they were fit to kick the lid off their coffin. That's what
I means, sir, and I means that when folk set to work to do a hard and
wicked thing those dead things sometimes gits up and walks where they is
least wanting; and mayhap if you goes on for to turn the old Squire and
Miss Ida out of the Castle, mayhap, sir, summut of that sort will happen
to you, for mark my word, sir, there's justice in the world, sir, as
mebbe you will find out. And now, sir, begging your pardon, I'll wish
you good-morning, and leave you to think on what I've said," and he was
gone.
</p><p>"George!" called Mr. Quest after him, rising from his chair, "George!"
but George was out of hearing.
</p><p>"Now what did he mean by that--what the devil did he mean?" said Mr.
Quest with a gasp as he sat down again. "Surely," he thought, "that man
cannot have got hold of anything about Edith. Impossible, impossible;
if he had he would have said more, he would not have confined himself to
hinting, that would take a cleverer man, he would have shown his hand.
He must have been speaking at random to frighten me, I suppose. By
heaven! what a thing it would be if he <u>had</u> got hold of something.
Ruin! absolute ruin! I'll settle up this business as soon as I can and
leave the country; I can't stand the strain, it's like having a sword
over one's head. I've half a mind to leave it in somebody else's hands
and go at once. No, for that would look like running away. It must be
all rubbish; how could he know anything about it?"
</p><p>So shaken was he, however, that though he tried once and yet again, he
found it impossible to settle himself down to work till he had taken a
couple of glasses of sherry from the decanter in the cupboard. Even as
he did so he wondered if the shadow of the sword disturbed him so much,
how he would be affected if it ever was his lot to face the glimmer of
its naked blade.
</p><p>No further letter came to Edward Cossey from the Castle, but, impatient
as he was to do so, another fortnight elapsed before he was able to see
Ida and her father. At last one fine December morning for the first time
since his accident he was allowed to take carriage exercise, and his
first drive was to Honham Castle.
</p><p>When the Squire, who was sitting in the vestibule writing letters, saw
a poor pallid man, rolled up in fur, with a white face scarred with shot
marks and black rings round his large dark eyes, being helped from a
closed carriage, he did not know who it was, and called to Ida, who was
passing along the passage, to tell him.
</p><p>Of course she recognised her admirer instantly, and wished to leave the
room, but her father prevented her.
</p><p>"You got into this mess," he said, forgetting how and for whom she got
into it, "and now you must get out of it in your own way."
</p><p>When Edward, having been assisted into the room, saw Ida standing there,
all the blood in his wasted body seemed to rush into his pallid face.
</p><p>"How do you do, Mr. Cossey?" she said. "I am glad to see you out, and
hope that you are better."
</p><p>"I beg your pardon, I cannot hear you," he said, turning round; "I am
stone deaf in my right ear."
</p><p>A pang of pity shot through her heart. Edward Cossey, feeble, dejected,
and limping from the jaws of Death, was a very different being to Edward
Cossey in the full glow of his youth, health, and strength. Indeed, so
much did his condition appeal to her sympathies that for the first
time since her mental attitude towards him had been one of entire
indifference, she looked on him without repugnance.
</p><p>Meanwhile her father had shaken him by the hand, and led him to an
armchair before the fire.
</p><p>Then after a few questions and answers as to his accident and merciful
recovery there came a pause.
</p><p>At length he broke it. "I have come to see you both," he said with a
faint nervous smile, "about the letters you wrote me. If my condition
had allowed I should have come before, but it would not."
</p><p>"Yes," said the Squire attentively, while Ida folded her hands in her
lap and sat still with her eyes fixed upon the fire.
</p><p>"It seems," he went on, "that the old proverb has applied to my case as
to so many others--being absent I have suffered. I understand from these
letters that my engagement to you, Miss de la Molle, is broken off."
</p><p>She made a motion of assent.
</p><p>"And that it is broken off on the ground that having been forced by a
combination of circumstances which I cannot enter into to transfer the
mortgages to Mr. Quest, consequently I broke my bargain with you?"
</p><p>"Yes," said Ida.
</p><p>"Very well then, I come to tell you both that I am ready to find the
money to meet those mortgages and to pay them off in full."
</p><p>"Ah!" said the Squire.
</p><p>"Also that I am ready to do what I offered to do before, and which, as
my father is now dead, I am perfectly in a position to do, namely,
to settle two hundred thousand pounds absolutely upon Ida, and indeed
generally to do anything else that she or you may wish," and he looked
at the Squire.
</p><p>"It is no use looking to me for an answer," said he with some
irritation. "I have no voice in the matter."
</p><p>He turned to Ida, who put her hand before her face and shook her head.
</p><p>"Perhaps," said Edward, somewhat bitterly, "I should not be far wrong
if I said that Colonel Quaritch has more to do with your change of mind
than the fact of the transfer of these mortgages."
</p><p>She dropped her hand and looked him full in the face.
</p><p>"You are quite right, Mr. Cossey," she said boldly. "Colonel Quaritch
and I are attached to each other, and we hope one day to be married."
</p><p>"Confound that Quaritch," growled the Squire beneath his breath.
</p><p>Edward winced visibly at this outspoken statement.
</p><p>"Ida," he said, "I make one last appeal to you. I am devoted to you
with all my heart; so devoted that though it may seem foolish to say so,
especially before your father, I really think I would rather not have
recovered from my accident than that I should have recovered for this.
I will give you everything that a woman can want, and my money will make
your family what it was centuries ago, the greatest in the country
side. I don't pretend to have been a saint--perhaps you may have heard
something against me in that way--or to be anything out of the common. I
am only an ordinary every-day man, but I am devoted to you. Think, then,
before you refuse me altogether."
</p><p>"I have thought, Mr. Cossey," answered Ida almost passionately: "I have
thought until I am tired of thinking, and I do not consider it fair that
you should press me like this, especially before my father."
</p><p>"Then," he said, rising with difficulty, "I have said all I have to say,
and done all that I can do. I shall still hope that you may change your
mind. I shall not yet abandon hope. Good-bye."
</p><p>She touched his hand, and then the Squire offering him his arm, he went
down the steps to his carriage.
</p><p>"I hope, Mr. de la Molle," he said, "that bad as things look for me, if
they should take a turn I shall have your support."
</p><p>"My dear sir," answered the Squire, "I tell you frankly that I wish my
daughter would marry you. As I said before, it would for obvious reasons
be desirable. But Ida is not like ordinary women. When she sets her mind
upon a thing she sets it like a flint. Times may change, however, and
that is all I can say. Yes, if I were you, I should remember that this
is a changeable world, and women are the most changeable things in it."
</p><p>When the carriage was gone he re-entered the vestibule. Ida, who was
going away much disturbed in mind, saw him come, and knew from the
expression of his face that there would be trouble. With characteristic
courage she turned, determined to brave it out.
