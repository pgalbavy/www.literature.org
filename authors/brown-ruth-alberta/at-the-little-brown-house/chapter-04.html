<p>In the hot room, high up under the eaves of the little brown
house, Peace sobbed out her anguish of soul, and then faced the
problem of shoes with a dauntless spirit.</p>

<p>"We'll <em>have</em> to have new ones when school begins again,
and if we could just get some of these canvas things to wear during
the summer, our old ones would last quite a while longer. Mercy,
where does the money go? Seems as if there never was any to buy
things we need with. Wish my tramp would come back and leave us
another bill. Wish&mdash;why didn't I think of that before? The woods
are full of flowers yet. I'll get Hope and Cherry to help me make
a lot of birch bark baskets and then Allee and me will sell them
in the city. My tramp said lots of folks would buy them if they
got a chance. Oh, Cherry, let's go down to the creek and get some
more bark. Tomorrow's Sunshine Club day and we will take Miss
Dunbar some baskets for her flowers."</p>

<p>Glad to distract Peace's thoughts from her great woe, Cherry
agreed, and the two made a hurried trip to the woods for material,
getting not only a big armful of bark, but also quite a bunch
of moccasin flowers and tiger lilies, which they had chanced upon
in an unexpected nook.</p>

<p>"These will be lovely for tomorrow, and ought to sell better
than the violets would, 'cause they aren't so common," said Peace,
as she looked lovingly down at the mass of red, gold and pink.</p>

<p>"Ought to what?" asked Cherry.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, what have I said?" thought Peace in dismay; but quickly
concealing her confusion, she replied, "They ought to look nice&mdash;make
better dec'rations, 'cause these are the first I've seen this
year."</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought you said <em>sell</em>, and I wondered if you
thought Miss Dunbar would pay us for them."</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy, no!" laughed Peace, and Cherry questioned no further.</p>

<p>But she would have been surprised had she seen this young sister
stealing out of the house the next morning with baskets and flowers
in her arms, headed in the opposite direction from Miss Dunbar's
village home. Once out of sight of the house, Peace broke into
a wild run and never stopped until the old stone bridge was reached.
Here Allee was waiting for her&mdash;a queer little figure in a faded
blue gown of long, long ago, hatless, barefooted, but looking
oh, so sweet, with her sparkling blue eyes and her mop of tangled
yellow curls crowned with a wreath of fragrant clover blossoms.
"How long you've been!" she greeted Peace. "I thought you would
never come. Where's Cherry?"</p>

<p>"I came as soon as I could," was the panting reply, as Peace
dropped her burden on the grass and smoothed out a rumpled pink
dress of as ancient a style as Allee's. "I had to help with the
dishes, and then Faith made me take the milk to Abbott's so's
Hope could do something for her. I didn't want Cherry. It takes
such a long time to knock any sense into her head that we never
would get into town today if she had to be coaxed. Besides, I
thought if there were three of us, folks might think the whole
family was out peddling, and maybe wouldn't buy like they would
of just two. There, don't those boats look lovely? The only thing
is, our basket won't hold as many as I hoped it would. I couldn't
jam in but fifteen. That will be enough, though, if we can sell
them at ten cents each. Oh, I've got a scheme! We will lay our
flowers in the basket on the moss and hitch these horns on our
dresses. I've got as many as ten pins in my dress which I don't
need for anything else." While she spoke she emptied the birch
bark boats of their brilliant cargo again, and deftly pinned the
quaint devices to their gowns, so they dangled fantastically from
their ribbon handles.</p>

<p>"Now are we ready?" asked Allee, as the last flower was tucked
carefully away in its bed of moss, and covered over with newspapers.</p>

<p>"Yes, and well have to hurry or miss the car. It's quite a ways
through the woods to the track. I wish they would run clear into
Parker, don't you?"</p>

<p>They scrambled down the bank of the creek and scurried away through
the trees to the little clearing where the city cars stopped at
the end of the line.</p>

<p>"There's a car just ready to start," panted Peace, and she waved
her hand frantically at the conductor who was lustily shouting,
"All aboard!" and jangling the bell to hurry up any belated passengers.</p>

<p>"Nearly missed it, didn't you, kids?" he said genially, as they
clambered up the steps and the car moved slowly away toward the
city.</p>

<p>"Yes," breathed the older girl, settling her luggage on the seat
and sitting down beside it. "I am very glad you waited for us.
We're anxious to get down town while our flowers are fresh."</p>

<p>"Going to sell 'em?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You better buy a basketful. You can have a horn or a boat,
and choose your own kind of flowers. We've got pink and yellow
lady's-slippers, tiger lilies, Johnny-jump-ups, baby's tears,
and a few Jack-in-the-pulpits."</p>

<p>As she made her explanation, she drew aside the paper protecting
her precious blossoms, and the man exclaimed in delight, "The
woods! My, aren't they scrumptious? I'll take a boat. What is
your price?"</p>

<p>"Ten cents."</p>

<p>"Ten cents? Why, child, that isn't enough! Here's a quarter.
Gimme lady's-slippers. And say, the motorman would like one, too.
He's got a girl. Give him something swell&mdash;a little of everything.
There, that's right! Stick a tiger lily right in the middle and
plaster up the edges like you did mine. Whee! ain't that gorgeous?
I'll bring you the dough right away." Snatching up the mass of
vivid colors, he dashed up the length of the car, thrust his head
into the motorman's vestibule, and after a moment's conversation
came back and dropped a half-dollar into Peace's trembling hand,
saying, "That's his contribution. It's worth it. Why, there ain't
a florist in the city who can show such beauties!"</p>

<p>"Mercy!" exclaimed the bewildered Peace, looking at her money
and trying to figure out how much more was needed for her wants.
"That means a pair of shoes and one over. Why, Allee, if everybody
would just pay like that, we will get through quick, won't we?
But I 'xpect lots of 'em will try to make us take only a nickel.
Just s'posing we get enough money to buy shoes for the whole family!
Wouldn't they be s'prised? Thank you, Mister Conductor, and thank
the motorman, too. We would like to know his girl. Does she ever
ride on his car and do you s'pose he would bring her over to play
with us some day? We'd meet her at the end of the line. Or maybe
she is too big for us."</p>

<p>The conductor laughed in boyish delight, "Yes, I am afraid she
is too big. In fact, she is quite a lady&mdash;" Here the car stopped
for passengers, and their new friend went out on the platform
where he stayed most of the time until they reached the heart
of the city. But as he helped them off the car at the busy corner
nearest Cameron's Shoe Store, he said, "If I was you, I would
go right over there in the door of that big building. I think
you can sell all the flowers you have."</p>

<p>So they took up their stand as he had suggested, and waited for
customers; but though many passers-by idly wondered at the odd
little figures so overhung with birch bark trifles, no one stopped
to inquire their business until a big, burly policeman, who had
been watching the wistful, almost frightened little faces, strolled
up to them and kindly asked, "Are you lost, little girls?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," promptly responded Peace, jerking aside the cover
of her basket and briskly beginning to fill one of the birch bark
canoes hitched to Allee's dress. "We are selling flowers. Would
you like a chance to buy some that grew in the real woods? We've
got money enough now for three shoes, but we need three more to
have enough to go around. They are only ten cents each unless
you want to pay more, but we won't sell them for a nickel."</p>

<p>Seeing the blue-coated officer talking with such odd little waifs,
a crowd had quickly gathered about the trio, and a host of friendly
voices echoed the policeman's hearty laugh at the jumbled recital.</p>

<p>"I'll take one," shouted a fashionably dressed man, elbowing
his way to the front. "Give me a horn and fill it up with those
little pansies. I haven't seen any of them since I was a kid."</p>

<p>"Those are Johnny-jump-ups," responded Peace gravely, detaching
a horn from Allee's gown and heaping it up with the tiny flowers.
"It's ten cents or more."</p>

<p>He laughed. "How much does 'or more' mean?"</p>

<p>"Much as you think they're worth. They came from the woods, you
know."</p>

<p>"And you think that makes them more valuable&mdash;worth more, I mean?"
And he dropped a shining dollar into the small, brown hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! City folks can't often get wild flowers, my tramp says,
and they ought to be glad for a chance to pay high for them."</p>

<p>The crowd shouted, and the policeman ventured to ask, "So you
think lots of the woods, do you?"</p>

<p>"You bet!" was the emphatic reply. "It's next best to heaven.
Just s'posing the whole world was made up of these great, high,
dirty houses, without any woods or flowers or trees anywhere.
Wouldn't it be dreadful?" The dismal picture she painted was singularly
effective, and other purchasers gathered around, clamoring for
her wares.</p>

<p>"I will give you a dime for one of those pink lady's-slippers,"
said a bent, old man.</p>

<p>"Here's a quarter for a spray of those white blossoms," another
voice broke in; and very quickly the fresh, beautiful, woodland
flowers changed hands, while the pile of coins in Peace's lap
grew amazingly.</p>

<p>A little, ragged, wan-looking bootblack edged through the crowd,
and stood with wistful eyes fixed on the rapidly diminishing bouquets,
drinking in their beauty, and wishing with all his heart that
one of them might be his. He fingered the few pennies in his pocket
longingly, and finally, unable to curb his desire longer, he touched
Peace's arm and timidly faltered, "Say, lady, will ye gimme one
o' them red fellers for a cent? I &mdash;I'd like one mighty well,
and I ain't got no more money to spare."</p>

<p>Peace lifted her big eyes to the pale, drawn, wistful face of
the boy, possibly as old as Cherry, but no older, and a great
wave of pity swept through her heart. "You can have it for nothing.
Here, take this whole bunch," she said, emptying her basket and
thrusting the last handful of gorgeous bloom into his trembling
hands. "I am sorry all the birch bark is gone, but I am sold out.
You haven't any shoes, either. Cameron's are selling canvas shoes
today at forty-nine cents a pair. We've got lots more'n enough
money for Cherry and Allee and me&mdash;you can have this to get yourself
some with." And before her interested audience could realize what
she was doing, she had selected a silver dollar from the jingling
mass in her apron, and pressed it into the bootblack's grimy fist,
while he stood like one turned to stone, staring at the money,
unable to believe his senses. Then he took a step toward the little
flower girl, but a gentleman in the throng, deeply touched by
the unusual scene, said, "Keep it, sonny, and thank the good God
for such sweet spirits as hers. Here is another dollar to keep
it company. Better run home now and take a little vacation. You
are sick."</p>

<p>Then how the men cheered! And to Peace's utter bewilderment,
one tall, dignified old gentleman, whose face looked strangely
familiar, slipped a shining gold coin into her hand and another
into Allee's, saying reverently, "For the Peace which passeth
understanding!"</p>

<p>She sat in puzzled silence for a moment, gazing first at the
glittering heap in her lap, and then at the sea of friendly faces
about her, while the crowd waited in curious expectancy to hear
what she had to say. Her lips opened once or twice as if to speak,
then closed again; but at last she said simply, "You've paid lots
better'n I thought you would, and not a single once has anyone
tried to buy a boat for a nickel. I &mdash;I wish we could have
brought you the whole woods, birds and all. You would have liked
it better. I b'lieve I said 'thank you' to every one who has bought
any flowers, but if I did forget, Allee hasn't. That was to be
her part&mdash;just to say 'thank you,' so folks would know we had
some manners and were glad to have you buy. But somehow, it feels
here"&mdash;putting her hand over her heart&mdash;"as if that wasn't enough,
and so we will sing you a little song&mdash;that is, Allee will sing,
and I'll whistle. I can't really sing anything, Faith says, 'cept
the tune the old cow died on. But Mike taught me how to whistle,
and our minister says I do real well for a girl. I tried to think
of some thankful song to sing, but I can't remember a one just
now, so we'll sing a lullabye. Are you ready, Allee?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then begin!" Peace puckered her rosy lips, Allee opened her
baby mouth, and this is the song they sang:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Baby-bye, bye-oh-bye,<br/>
Baby-bye, baby-bye,<br/>
Mother's darling, don't you cry,<br/>
Close your eyes for night is nigh;<br/>
Baby-bye, oh, baby,<br/>
Baby-bye, oh, bye."

</p>
</div>
<p>"Amen," said Peace reverently. "Now we are going to Cameron's
Shoe Store for canvas shoes. What size do you s'pose a girl two
years older'n I would wear? I forgot to ask Cherry."</p>

<p>"The clerk will know," suggested someone; and the crowd went
their separate ways with smiles on their lips, while the two odd,
childish figures trudged around the corner to Cameron's Shoe Store
to make their important purchases. An obliging young man fitted
the little feet with the precious canvas slippers, and sent them
away rejoicing with a pair for Cherry, promising to exchange them
for others if they failed to fit.</p>

<p>"Now we'll go home," said Peace, as they stepped out onto the
sidewalk again. "Won't Gail and Faith be s'prised? I guess we've
got 'most money enough left to get shoes for the whole family
after all. Well, sir, if they haven't changed those cars since
we went into the shoe store! We came down on a big yellow one
that said, 'Twentieth Avenue North' on it, and here they are running
two little bits of cars hitched together that say, 'Onion Depot!'"
Peace employed the phonetic method of pronouncing words, and to
her young eyes u-n-i-o-n was easily <em>onion</em>.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?" asked puzzled Allee.</p>

<p>"Sit down here on the sidewalk and wait till they change them
back again," was the reply; and Peace plumped herself down in
a bunch on the curbing to watch for the yellow car which did not
come. One hour dragged by,&mdash;two, three. Allee was getting restless.
Dinner hour had long since passed, and she was very hungry. "It's
getting pretty late, I guess," she ventured at last. "When do
you s'pose the car will come?"</p>

<p>"I s'pect there's been a fire somewhere and stopped it. That
happened once when Gail was in town."</p>

<p>"Maybe we better start to walk, then," quavered the little voice.
"I am tired of sitting here, and Gail will fret if we don't come
pretty quick."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps we better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace Greenfield! What on earth are you doing here?"</p>

<p>The two children flew to their feet with a cry of relief, "Oh,
Mrs. Grinnell, our car is never coming!"</p>

<p>"No, I guess it won't on these tracks," she replied grimly, guessing
from the children's appearance something of the truth. "Does your
mother or Gail know you are here? Pile in and ride home with me.
Like as not your folks are half crazy with fright."</p>

<p>So the weary duet climbed thankfully into the buggy and were
driven safely back to Parker, where they were met by four white-faced
sisters and a swarm of anxious neighbors.</p>

<p>"Got shoes for the whole outfit!" cried Peace by way of greeting;
"and if Cherry's don't fit, the clerk said bring 'em back and
he'd change 'em. We've sold all our flowers, and one man gave
each of us some funny yellow quarters&mdash;or I guess they are half
dollars. It says on one side, 'Five D.' and I suppose that means
five dimes, doesn't it? Why, Gail, what are you crying for? I
sh'd think you'd laugh to think there are three pair of shoes
already bought, and money enough for the rest of you."</p>
