<p>"Now, Jack, do your best, for everything depends on you."</p>

<p>Jennie Whitney looked around in the darkness and saw the glimmer
of the rustlers' camp-fire, fully two hundred yards to the rear,
with the shadowy figures moving to and fro.</p>

<p>"They may change their minds," she added, recalling the words
of Larch Cadmus, "and decide to bring me back. Let them do it
if they can!"</p>

<p>The intelligent pony acted as if he understood what was expected
of him. With a light whinny at the pleasure he felt because of
the opportunity of stretching out his beautiful limbs he broke
into a swift canter, heading straight for the point where his
rider believed the friendly camp was to be found.</p>

<p>She held the reins loose, knowing the danger of attempting to
guide him where it was impossible to keep the points of the compass
in mind. The way was smooth and even, although there is always
danger in going at such speed in the night. She deemed the stake
warranted it, however, and did not check the rapid pace.</p>

<p>Night on every hand and not a shining star overhead. If she could
find the party of stockmen in time, so as to bring them back to
her home, their strength would overawe the rustlers, and the whole
difficulty could be arranged without the conflict which she looked
upon with unspeakable dread.</p>

<p>"It will save him, too," she added, hesitating to pronounce the
name that was in her heart, which would have throbbed more painfully
had she known that in a brief while he would be helpless in the
power of the men eager for his life. "I am glad he did not venture
out of the house, when his friend could have done him no good.
What will he think of me on learning what I have done? He will
say that I am rash and foolish, and perhaps I am; will he suspect
that it was to save him that I undertook this errand, which, after
all, is attended with no risk to me worth mentioning?"</p>

<p>These were pleasant musings, but the task before her was too
serious and made too close demands on her mental and physical
energies for her to indulge in them. The delightful reverie could
be deferred to a more convenient season.</p>

<p>Jennie Whitney had lived long enough in the West to understand
that in times like the present it is safer to depend on the instinct
of one's heart than upon one's reason. It seemed now and then
that Jack was following the wrong direction, but she was wise
in not interfering.</p>

<p>The gloom was so deep that she could see barely a few paces beyond
the pointed ears in front, but when the ground showed an abrupt
rise she recalled the location and knew he had followed the exact
course she desired.</p>

<p>She pulled slightly on the reins and he dropped to a walk. At
the same moment something dark moved aside, the pony diverting
his own steps to avoid it. She experienced a slight shock of fright,
but recognized the object as one of the cattle probably belonging
to their own herd. Others showed dimly here and there as the horse
carefully picked his way forward.</p>

<p>"Halloo, who's that?" called a gruff voice from the darkness,
the hail proving more startling than the first surprise.</p>

<p>"It is I, Jennie Whitney," replied the young lady, "and I am
searching for help."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged! What's up, Miss Jennie?"</p>

<p>It was Budd Hankinson who came forward on foot, his figure appearing
of gigantic proportions in the gloom. He was more alarmed than
she, as he had warrant for being, knowing, as he did, that some
extraordinary cause must have brought the girl to this place alone
at that hour of the night.</p>

<p>She quickly told her story, explaining that Fred was held a prisoner
by the rustlers, else he would have hastened back to secure the
assistance for which she was looking.</p>

<p>"You're a brave girl," said the honest fellow, as he laid his
hand on the reins of the pony; "there are mighty few that would
have done what you've done to-night."</p>

<p>"Never mind about that, Budd, but tell me what to do."</p>

<p>"Why, you mustn't do anything; I'll do the rest."</p>

<p>"No, you may help me, but what is it to be?"</p>

<p>"Luck's running your way, Jennie; the stockmen have moved their
camp since Fred left this morning."</p>

<p>"Mercy! I thought I had only two or three miles farther to go."</p>

<p>"Their camp isn't more'n half a mile off, right over the swell
yonder; we'll be there in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"And you will go with me?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I reckon; what sort of a chap do you take me for?"</p>

<p>"Where is Weber?"</p>

<p>"Three miles to the south, which is in t'other direction; we
won't have time to look him up, and it wouldn't do any good if
we did. We made a change of grazing grounds, as I s'pose Fred
told you, but some of the cattle strayed off here and I was looking
'em up when I heard your pony."</p>

<p>"Where's your horse?"</p>

<p>"Not far; wait here and I'll be right back."</p>

<p>He was gone but a few minutes, when he returned in the saddle.</p>

<p>"It won't do to go too fast," he explained, moving forward with
his animal on a walk, "but we can keep beside each other."</p>

<p>Riding thus carefully, he questioned her about the stirring incidents
at the house, and she gave him the particulars. The sagacious
fellow had seen before this how matters stood between her and
Monteith Sterry, and he knew her anxiety, but his good taste prevented
any reference to it further than to say:</p>

<p>"I hope Mont will be too wise to try to slip out of the house,
for if he does he's sure to be grabbed up by them, and they won't
give him a chance for his life."</p>

<p>"Do you think he will make the attempt, Budd?"</p>

<p>"No, now that he knows you have started, for you've got a mighty
sight better chance to succeed than he could have. Of course he
has too much sense for anything of the kind."</p>

<p>It was well that neither of them suspected the truth.</p>

<p>"There they are!"</p>

<p>They had reached the top of the elevation, and saw before them
the twinkling lights of several camp-fires. The stockmen, fully
understanding the nature of the work they had undertaken, conducted
themselves like a force invading a hostile country. Regular sentinels
were stationed, to prevent the insidious approach of an enemy.</p>

<p>The couple rode down the hill, and, as they expected, were challenged
on the edge of the camp. Inasmuch as Budd had visited the men
during the day and formed numerous acquaintances, he had little
difficulty in making himself known. All, excepting the guards,
had retired for the night, but the visitor was conducted to the
place where Maj. Sitgraves was asleep, Jennie remaining on the
outskirts with one of the sentinels, who treated her with all
courtesy.</p>

<p>Maj. Sitgraves was a brave man, who had only to hear the story
brought to him by the honest cowboy to understand the urgency
of the case. It was now near midnight, and the attack at the ranch
was liable to be made at any moment. The stockmen could not reach
the scene of danger too soon.</p>

<p>Almost instantly the camp was astir. It looked as if the men
had received orders to attack a force of Indians, whose location
was just made known to them, and, in point of fact, the situation
was somewhat similar, for a brisk fight appeared inevitable. Three
rustlers whom the major was particularly anxious to arrest were
Ira Inman, Larch Cadmus and Duke Vesey, and he especially wanted
the first two. They were with the party not far off, and, aside
from the call for help of the imperilled stockmen, the prospect
of capturing those fellows was sufficient warrant for a prompt
movement.</p>

<p>Within half an hour after Jennie Whitney's meeting with Budd
Hankinson the party of half a hundred were galloping westward,
she riding at the head, with Maj. Sitgraves and Budd, who acted
as guide to the expedition.</p>

<p>Hope arose with every rod advanced, for if fighting had begun
the reports of the guns would be heard, but the listening ears
failed to catch the first hostile sound from the Whitney ranch.
By and by a point was reached which would have shown them the
flash of the guns, but the gloom remained impenetrable.</p>

<p>The twinkling camp-fire, at the base of the ridge, gave just
the guidance needed, and, with Budd Hankinson's intimate knowledge
of the country, enabled the force to tell exactly where they were.</p>

<p>Maj. Sitgraves decided to defer his attack until daylight, unless
the safety of the beleaguered cattlemen should force him to assault
sooner. In the darkness, with the open country around, and the
excellent animals at the command of the rustlers, most of them
would escape upon learning the strength of the assailants. At
the earliest dawn the stockmen could be so placed that, as the
commander believed, nearly if not quite all of the law-breakers
would be corralled.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a halt was made while yet a considerable way off,
and Budd Hankinson went forward on foot to reconnoitre. Upon his
report must depend the action of the stockmen.</p>

<p>The fellow was gone more than three-quarters of an hour, and
when he came back he brought astounding news.</p>

<p>Not a solitary rustler was to be found anywhere near the ranch.</p>

<p>Hardly able to credit the fact, Budd picked his way to the building,
knocked, and was admitted. There the amazing truth was made known.
Capt. Ira Inman and all his men had been gone for an hour, and
were probably miles distant at that moment.</p>

<p>The detention of Duke Vesey as a hostage for the safety of Monteith
Sterry proved the key to the whole situation. When Inman learned
how he had been outwitted he was enraged to the point of ordering
an attack at once, with the resolve to give mercy to no one. He
even threatened to visit his fury upon Fred Whitney, who had shown
such punctilious regard for his parole, for it would seem that
under the circumstances he would have been warranted in staying
behind with his friends.</p>

<p>But before taking so rash a step, the cooler judgment of the
leader came to his rescue &mdash;He placed a high value on Duke
Vesey, who had been associated with him in several dangerous enterprises,
and he knew that any harm done to Sterry would recoil on him,
just as the grim Capt. Asbury had threatened.</p>

<p>After prolonged discussion with Cadmus and others, it was decided
to offer to exchange Sterry for Vesey. The proposition was accepted,
and the exchange faithfully made, though considerable more delay
was involved.</p>

<p>But while it was under way Inman learned of Jennie Whitney's
flight toward the Big Horn Mountains. Keener of wit than Larch
Cadmus, he suspected the truth at once, though he knew nothing
of the proximity of the stockmen.</p>

<p>Before making the attack and attempt to burn the building he
sent out two of his best mounted men in the direction taken by
her, to investigate. They did so with such skill that neither
Budd Hankinson nor any of the stockmen suspected them. They returned
with news of the approach of a body too powerful for them to think
of combating. They therefore fled in the darkness, the promptness
of the leaders probably hastened by the knowledge that they were
the parties for whom the stockmen were looking.</p>

<p>And so ended the campaign. The situation had been critical for
a long time, and there were moments, time and again, when the
most trifling incident intervened to avert a fearful conflict
between men of the same race and blood; but all had now passed,
and it may be said that not so much as a hostile shot had been
exchanged.</p>

<p>The main events of the troubles in Wyoming between the cowmen
and rustlers are too well remembered to require recital at our
hands. The expedition referred to in another place left Cheyenne
in April for Nolan's Ranch, a hundred or more miles distant. Within
the following month, the Sixth <em>U.S. </em>Cavalry brought all
of them back to Cheyenne as prisoners of war, thus saving them
from extermination at the hands of the indignant rustlers, who
had them hemmed in on all sides.</p>

<p>Fred Whitney sold out his ranch, near the headwaters of Powder
River, and moved eastward. He was not actuated by fear, for it
will be conceded that he proved his courage, but he desired to
take his loved mother and sister away from the sorrowful memories
that must always cling to the place.</p>

<p>It will not surprise the reader to learn, further, that Monteith
Sterry found it quite convenient to make his home in the same
neighborhood with the Whitneys, and it was but a short time after
this removal eastward that a most pleasing incident occurred in
the lives of the young man and Miss Whitney, of the nature of
which we are sure the reader does not need to be told.</p>
