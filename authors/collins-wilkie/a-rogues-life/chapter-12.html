<P>
FOR a couple of hours I walked on briskly, careless in what
direction I went, so long as I kept my back turned on Barkingham.
<P>
By the time I had put seven miles of ground, according to my
calculations, between me and the red-brick house, I began to look
upon the doctor's writing-desk rather in the light of an
incumbrance, and determined to examine it without further delay.
Accordingly I picked up the first large stone I could find in the
road, crossed a common, burst through a hedge, and came to a
halt, on the other side, in a thick wood. Here, finding myself
well screened from public view, I broke open the desk with the
help of the stone, and began to look over the contents.
<P>
To my unspeakable disappointment I found but few papers of any
kind to examine. The desk was beautifully fitted with all the
necessary materials for keeping up a large correspondence; but
there were not more than half a dozen letters in it altogether.
Four were on business matters, and the other two were of a
friendly nature, referring to persons and things in which I did
not feel the smallest interest. I found besides half a dozen
bills receipted (the doctor was a mirror of punctuality in the
payment of tradesmen), note and letter-paper of the finest
quality, clarified pens, a pretty little pin-cushion, two small
account-books filled with the neatest entries, and some leaves of
blotting-paper. Nothing else; absolutely nothing else, in the
treacherous writing-desk on which I had implicitly relied to
guide me to Alicia's hiding-place.
<P>
I groaned in sheer wretchedness over the destruction of all my
dearest plans and hopes. If the Bow Street runners had come into
the plantation just as I had completed the rifling of the desk I
think I should have let them take me without making the slightest
effort at escape. As it was, no living soul appeared within sight
of me. I must have sat at the foot of a tree for full half an
hour, with the doctor's useless bills and letters before me, with
my head in my hands, and with all my energies of body and mind
utterly crushed by despair.
<P>
At the end of the half hour, the natural restlessness of my
faculties began to make itself felt.
<P>
Whatever may be said about it in books, no emotion in this world
ever did, or ever will, last for long together. The strong
feeling may return over and over again; but it must have its
constant intervals of change or repose. In real life the
bitterest grief doggedly takes its rest and dries its eyes; the
heaviest despair sinks to a certain level, and stops there to
give hope a chance of rising, in spite of us. Even the joy of an
unexpected meeting is always an imperfect sensation, for it never
lasts long enough to justify our secret anticipations--our
happiness dwindles to mere every-day contentment before we have
half done with it.
<P>
I raised my head, and gathered the bills and letters together,
and stood up a man again, wondering at the variableness of my own
temper, at the curious elasticity of that toughest of all the
vital substances within us, which we call Hope. "Sitting and
sighing at the foot of this tree," I thought, "is not the way to
find Alicia, or to secure my own safety. Let me circulate my
blood and rouse my ingenuity, by taking to the road again."
<P>
Before I forced my way back to the open side of the hedge, I
thought it desirable to tear up the bills and letters, for fear
of being traced by them if they were found in the plantation. The
desk I left where it was, there being no name on it. The
note-paper and pens I pocketed--forlorn as my situation was, it
did not authorize me to waste stationery. The blotting-paper was
the last thing left to dispose of: two neatly-folded sheets,
quite clean, except in one place, where the impression of a few
lines of writing appeared. I was about to put the blotting-paper
into my pocket after the pens, when something in the look of the
writing impressed on it, stopped me.
<P>
Four blurred lines appeared of not more than two or three words
each, running out one beyond another regularly from left to
right. Had the doctor been composing poetry and blotting it in a
violent hurry? At a first glance, that was more than I could
tell. The order of the written letters, whatever they might be,
was reversed on the face of the impression taken of them by the
blotting-paper. I turned to the other side of the leaf. The order
of the letters was now right, but the letters themselves were
sometimes too faintly impressed, sometimes too much blurred
together to be legible. I held the leaf up to the light--and
there was a complete change: the blurred letters grew clearer,
the invisible connecting lines appeared--I could read the words
from first to last.
<P>
The writing must have been hurried, and it had to all appearance
been hurriedly dried toward the corner of a perfectly clean leaf
of the blotting-paper. After twice reading, I felt sure that I
had made out correctly the following address:
<P>
Miss Giles, 2 Zion Place, Crickgelly, N. Wales.
<P>
It was hard under the circumstances, to form an opinion as to the
handwriting; but I thought I could recognize the character of
some of the doctor's letters, even in the blotted impression of
them. Supposing I was right, who was Miss Giles?
<P>
Some Welsh friend of the doctor's, unknown to me? Probably
enough. But why not Alicia herself under an assumed name? Having
sent her from home to keep her out of my way, it seemed next to a
certainty that her father would take all possible measures to
prevent my tracing her, and would, therefore, as a common act of
precaution, forbid her to travel under her own name. Crickgelly,
North Wales, was assuredly a very remote place to banish her to;
but then the doctor was not a man to do things by halves: he knew
the lengths to which my cunning and resolution were capable of
carrying me; and he would have been innocent indeed if he had
hidden his daughter from me in any place within reasonable
distance of Barkingham. Last, and not least important, Miss Giles
sounded in my ears exactly like an assumed name.
<P>
Was there ever any woman absolutely and literally named Miss
Giles? However I may have altered my opinion on this point since,
my mind was not in a condition at that time to admit the possible
existence of any such individual as a maiden Giles. Before,
therefore, I had put the precious blotting-paper into my pocket,
I had satisfied myself that my first duty, under all the
circumstances, was to shape my flight immediately to Crickgelly.
I could be certain of nothing--not even of identifying the
doctor's handwriting by the impression on the blotting-paper. But
provided I kept clear of Barkingham, it was all the same to me
what part of the United Kingdom I went to; and, in the absence of
any actual clew to her place of residence, there was consolation
and encouragement even in following an imaginary trace. My
spirits rose to their natural height as I struck into the
highroad again, and beheld across the level plain the smoke,
chimneys, and church spires of a large manufacturing town. There
I saw the welcome promise of a coach--the happy chance of making
my journey to Crickgelly easy and rapid from the very outset.
<P>
On my way to the town, I was reminded by the staring of all the
people I passed on the road, of one important consideration which
I had hitherto most unaccountably overlooked--the necessity of
making some radical change in my personal appearance.
<P>
I had no cause to dread the Bow Street runners, for not one of
them had seen me; but I had the strongest possible reasons for
distrusting a meeting with my enemy, Screw. He would certainly be
made use of by the officers for the purpose of identifying the
companions whom he had betrayed; and I had the best reasons in
the world to believe that he would rather assist in the taking of
me than in the capture of all the rest of the coining gang put
together--the doctor himself not excepted. My present costume was
of the dandy sort--rather shabby, but gay in color and outrageous
in cut. I had not altered it for an artisan's suit in the
doctor's house, because I never had any intention of staying
there a day longer than I could possibly help. The apron in which
I had wrapped the writing-desk was the only approach I had made
toward wearing the honorable uniform of the workingman.
<P>
Would it be wise now to make my transformation complete, by
adding to the apron a velveteen jacket and a sealskin cap? No: my
hands were too white, my manners too inveterately gentleman-like,
for all artisan disguise. It would be safer to assume a serious
character--to shave off my whiskers, crop my hair, buy a modest
hat and umbrella, and dress entirely in black. At the first
slopshop I encountered in the suburbs of the town, I got a
carpet-bag and a clerical-looking suit. At the first easy
shaving-shop I passed, I had my hair cropped and my whiskers
taken off. After that I retreated again to the country--walked
back till I found a convenient hedge down a lane off the
highroad--changed my upper garments behind it, and emerged,
bashful, black, and reverend, with my cotton umbrella tucked
modestly under my arm, my eyes on the ground, my head in the air,
and my hat off my forehead. When I found two laborers touching
their caps to me on my way back to the town, I knew that it was
all right, and that I might now set the vindictive eyes of Screw
himself safely at defiance.
<P>
I had not the most distant notion where I was when I reached the
High Street, and stopped at The Green Bull Hotel and
Coach-office. However, I managed to mention my modest wishes to
be conveyed at once in the direction of Wales, with no more than
a becoming confusion of manner.
<P>
The answer was not so encouraging as I could have wished. The
coach to Shrewsbury had left an hour before, and there would be
no other public conveyance running in my direct ion until the
next morning. Finding myself thus obliged to yield to adverse
circumstances, I submitted resignedly, and booked a place outside
by the next day's coach, in the name of the Reverend John Jones.
I thought it desirable to be at once unassuming and Welsh in the
selection of a traveling name; and therefore considered John
Jones calculated to fit me, in my present emergency, to a hair.
<P>
After securing a bed at the hotel, and ordering a frugal curate's
dinner (bit of fish, two chops, mashed potatoes, semolina
pudding, half-pint of sherry), I sallied out to look at the town.
<P>
Not knowing the name of it, and not daring to excite surprise by
asking, I found the place full of vague yet mysterious interest.
Here I was, somewhere in central England, just as ignorant of
localities as if I had been suddenly deposited in Central Africa.
My lively fancy revelled in the new sensation. I invented a name
for the town, a code of laws for the inhabitants, productions,
antiquities, chalybeate springs, population, statistics of crime,
and so on, while I walked about the streets, looked in at the
shop-windows, and attentively examined the Market-place and
Town-hall. Experienced travelers, who have exhausted all
novelties, would do well to follow my example; they may be
certain, for one day at least, of getting some fresh ideas, and
feeling a new sensation.
<P>
On returning to dinner in the coffee-room, I found all the London
papers on the table.
<P>
The <i>Morning Post</i> happened to lie uppermost, so I took it away
to my own seat to occupy the time, while my unpretending bit of
fish was frying. Glancing lazily at the advertisements on the
first page, to begin with, I was astonished by the appearance of
the following lines, at the top of a column:
<P>
<P>
<P>
"If F-- --K S--FTL--Y will communicate with his distressed and
alarmed relatives, Mr. and Mrs. B--TT--RB--RY, he will hear of
something to his advantage, and may be assured that all will be
once more forgiven. A--B--LLA entreats him to write."
<P>
<P>
<P>
What, in the name of all that is most mysterious, does this mean!
was my first thought after reading the advertisement. Can Lady
Malkinshaw have taken a fresh lease of that impregnable vital
tenement, at the door of which Death has been knocking vainly for
so many years past? (Nothing more likely.) Was my felonious
connection with Doctor Dulcifer suspected? (It seemed
improbable.) One thing, however, was certain: I was missed, and
the Batterburys were naturally anxious about me--anxious enough
to advertise in the public papers.
<P>
I debated with myself whether I should answer their pathetic
appeal or not. I had all my money about me (having never let it
out of my own possession during my stay in the red-brick house),
and there was plenty of it for the present; so I thought it best
to leave the alarm and distress of my anxious relatives
unrelieved for a little while longer, and to return quietly to
the perusal of the <i>Morning Post</i>.
<P>
Five minutes of desultory reading brought me unexpectedly to an
explanation of the advertisement, in the shape of the following
paragraph:
<P>
<P>
<P>
"ALARMING ILLNESS OF LADY MALKINSHAW.--We regret to announce that
this venerable lady was seized with an alarming illness on
Saturday last, at her mansion in town. The attack took the
character of a fit--of what precise nature we have not been able
to learn. Her ladyship's medical attendant and near relative,
Doctor Softly, was immediately called in, and predicted the most
fatal results. Fresh medical attendance was secured, and her
ladyship's nearest surviving relatives, Mrs. Softly, and Mr. and
Mrs. Batterbury, of Duskydale Park, were summoned. At the time of
their arrival her ladyship's condition was comatose, her
breathing being highly stertorous. If we are rightly informed,
Doctor Softly and the other medical gentlemen present gave it as
their opinion that if the pulse of the venerable sufferer did not
rally in the course of a quarter of au hour at most, very
lamentable results might be anticipated. For fourteen minutes, as
our reporter was informed, no change took place; but, strange to
relate, immediately afterward her ladyship's pulse rallied
suddenly in the most extraordinary manner. She was observed to
open her eyes very wide, and was heard, to the surprise and
delight of all surrounding the couch, to ask why her ladyship's
usual lunch of chicken-broth with a glass of Amontillado sherry
was not placed on the table as usual. These refreshments having
been produced, under the sanction of the medical gentlemen, the
aged patient partook of them with an appearance of the utmost
relish. Since this happy alteration for the better, her
ladyship's health has, we rejoice to say, rapidly improved; and
the answer now given to all friendly and fashionable inquirers
is, in the venerable lady's own humorous phraseology, 'Much
better than could be expected.' "
<P>
<P>
<P>
Well done, my excellent grandmother! my firm, my unwearied, my
undying friend! Never can I say that my case is desperate while
you can swallow your chicken-broth and sip your Amontillado
sherry. The moment I want money, I will write to Mr. Batterbury,
and cut another little golden slice out of that possible
three-thousand-pound-cake, for which he has already suffered and
sacrificed so much. In the meantime, O venerable protectress of
the wandering Rogue! let me gratefully drink your health in the
nastiest and smallest half-pint of sherry this palate ever
tasted, or these eyes ever beheld!
<P>
I went to bed that night in great spirits. My luck seemed to be
returning to me; and I began to feel more than hopeful of really
discovering my beloved Alicia at Crickgelly, under the alias of
Miss Giles.
<P>
The next morning the Rev. John Jones descended to breakfast so
rosy, bland, and smiling, that the chambermaids simpered as he
tripped by them in the passage, and the landlady bowed graciously
as he passed her parlor door. The coach drove up, and the
reverend gentleman (after waiting characteristically for the
woman's ladder) mounted to his place on the roof, behind the
coachman. One man sat there who had got up before him--and who
should that man be, but the chief of the Bow Street runners, who
had rashly tried to take Doctor Dulcifer into custody!
<P>
There could not be the least doubt of his identity; I should have
known his face again among a hundred. He looked at me as I took
my place by his side, with one sharp searching glance--then
turned his head away toward the road. Knowing that he had never
set eyes on my face (thanks to the convenient peephole at the
red-brick house), I thought my meeting with him was likely to be
rather advantageous than otherwise. I had now an opportunity of
watching the proceedings of one of our pursuers, at any rate--and
surely this was something gained.
<P>
"Fine morning, sir," I said politely.
<P>
"Yes," he replied in the gruffest of monosyllables.
<P>
I was not offended: I could make allowance for the feelings of a
man who had been locked up by his own prisoner.
<P>
"Very fine morning, indeed," I repeated, soothingly and
cheerfully.
<P>
The runner only grunted this time. Well, well! we all have our
little infirmities. I don't think the worse of the man now, for
having been rude to me, that morning, on the top of the
Shrewsbury coach.
<P>
The next passenger who got up and placed himself by my side was a
florid, excitable, confused-looking gentleman, excessively
talkative and familiar. He was followed by a sulky agricultural
youth in top-boots--and then, the complement of passengers on our
seat behind the coachman was complete.
<P>
"Heard the news, sir?" said the florid man, turning to me.
<P>
"Not that I am aware of," I answered.
<P>
"It's the most tremendous thing that has happened these fifty
years," said the florid man. "A gang of coiners, sir, discovered
at Barkingham--in a house they used to call the Grange. All the
dreadful lot of bad silver that's been about, they're at the
bottom of. And the head of the gang not taken! --escaped, sir,
like a ghost on the stage, through a trap-door, after actually
locking the runners into his workshop. The blacksmiths from
Barkingham had to break them out; the whole house was found full
of iron doors, back staircases , and all that sort of thing, just
like the  Inquisition. A most respectable man, the original
proprietor! Think what a misfortune to have let his house to a
scoundrel who has turned the whole inside into traps, furnaces,
and iron doors. The fellow's reference, sir, was actually at a
London bank, where he kept a first-rate account. What is to
become of society? where is our protection? Where are our
characters, when we are left at the mercy of scoundrels? The
times are awful--upon my soul, the times we live in are perfectly
awful!"
<P>
"Pray, sir, is there any chance of catching this coiner?" I
inquired innocently.
<P>
"I hope so, sir; for the sake of outraged society, I hope so,"
said the excitable man. "They've printed handbills at Barkingham,
offering a reward for taking him. I was with my friend the mayor,
early this morning, and saw them issued. 'Mr. Mayor,' says I,
'I'm going West--give me a few copies--let me help to circulate
them--for the sake of outraged society, let me help to circulate
them. Here they are--take a few, sir, for distribution. You'll
see these are three other fellows to be caught besides the
principal rascal--one of them a scamp belonging to a respectable
family. Oh! what times! Take three copies, and pray circulate
them in three influential quarters. Perhaps that gentleman next
you would like a few. Will you take three, sir?"
<P>
"No, I won't," said the Bow Street runner doggedly. "Nor yet one
of 'em--and it's my opinion that the coining-gang would be nabbed
all the sooner, if you was to give over helping the law to catch
them."
<P>
This answer produced a vehement expostulation from my excitable
neighbor, to which I paid little attention, being better engaged
in reading the handbill.
<P>
It described the doctor's personal appearance with remarkable
accuracy, and cautioned persons in seaport towns to be on the
lookout for him. Old File, Young File, and myself were all
dishonorably mentioned together in a second paragraph, as
runaways of inferior importance Not a word was said in the
handbill to show that the authorities at Barkingham even so much
as suspected the direction in which any one of us had escaped.
This would have been very encouraging, but for the presence of
the runner by my side, which looked as if Bow Street had its
suspicions, however innocent Barkingham might be.
<P>
Could the doctor have directed his flight toward Crickgelly? I
trembled internally as the question suggested itself to me.
Surely he would prefer writing to Miss Giles to join him when he
got to a safe place of refuge, rather than encumber himself with
the young lady before he was well out of reach of the
far-stretching arm of the law. This seemed infinitely the most
natural course of conduct. Still, there was the runner traveling
toward Wales--and not certainly without a special motive. I put
the handbills in my pocket, and listened for any hints which
might creep out in his talk; but he perversely kept silent. The
more my excitable neighbor tried to dispute with him, the more
contemptuously he refused to break silence. I began to feel
vehemently impatient for our arrival at Shrewsbury; for there
only could I hope to discover something more of my formidable
fellow-traveler's plans.
<P>
The coach stopped for dinner; and some of our passengers left us,
the excitable man with the handbills among the number. I got
down, and stood on the doorstep of the inn, pretending to be
looking about me, but in reality watching the movements of the
runner.
<P>
Rather to my surprise, I saw him go to the door of the coach and
speak to one of the inside passengers. After a short
conversation, of which I could not hear one word, the runner left
the coach door and entered the inn, called for a glass of brandy
and water, and took it out to his friend, who had not left the
vehicle . The friend bent forward to receive it at the window. I
caught a glimpse of his face, and felt my knees tremble under
me--it was Screw himself!
<P>
Screw, pale and haggard-looking, evidently not yet recovered from
the effect of my grip on his throat! Screw, in attendance on the
runner, traveling inside the coach in the character of an
invalid. He must be going this journey to help the Bow Street
officers to identify some one of our scattered gang of whom they
were in pursuit. It could not be the doctor--the runner could
discover him without assistance from anybody. Why might it not be
me?
<P>
I began to think whether it would be best to trust boldly in my
disguise, and my lucky position outside the coach, or whether I
should abandon my fellow-passengers immediately. It was not easy
to settle at once which course was the safest--so I tried the
effect of looking at my two alternatives from another point of
view. Should I risk everything, and go on resolutely to
Crickgelly, on the chance of discovering that Alicia and Miss
Giles were one and the same person--or should I give up on the
spot the only prospect of finding my lost mistress, and direct my
attention entirely to the business of looking after my own
safety?
<P>
As the latter alternative practically resolved itself into the
simple question of whether I should act like a man who was in
love, or like a man who was not, my natural instincts settled the
difficulty in no time. I boldly imitated the example of my
fellow-passengers, and went in to dinner, determined to go on
afterward to Crickgelly, though all Bow Street should be
following at my heels.
