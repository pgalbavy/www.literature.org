<p><em>THE </em>loss of Deerfoot’s horse was received more seriously
by the friends of the young Shawanoe than by himself. There were
several ways of meeting the difficulty. George Shelton proposed
that the load carried by Zigzag should be divided among the others
and the animal used by the dismounted one. The latter shook his
head, and Victor suggested that he and his brother take turns
with him in riding their horses. Before that proposition was made
Mul-tal-la came forward with a similar one affecting only him
and his comrade.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe declined them all.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will walk," he calmly said. "He has done so many times.
He will not grow tired as soon as the horses. Let us go forward."</p>

<p>To show that the question was settled he strode off across the
prairie, carrying his rifle in a trailing position and stepping
with his elastic gait, which he could maintain hour after hour
without fatigue. Moreover, it would have been no hardship for
him to strike into a lope which would have kept the animals at
a trot throughout the day. You know that a man, trained to the
exercise, can walk farther than a horse, and no person was ever
better trained than the young Shawanoe.</p>

<p>The oppression caused by his loss showed itself for a long time.
He held his place in advance of the others, rarely speaking and
often acting as if unaware that he had companions with him. They
respected his moods, and though they chatted among themselves,
said little or nothing to him.</p>

<p>About the middle of the afternoon the boys descried an object
in the horizon to the northeast, which at first they took to be
a white cloud heaped against the sky. But its stationary position
and its peculiar form revealed that it was a mountain peak whose
summit was covered with snow. Seen against the sky it had a soft
bluish tint which made it a most striking figure in the landscape.
The clear air of these regions makes distances deceptive, objects
seeming to be much nearer the spectator than they are. When Victor
said he thought they might camp that night at its base, the Blackfoot
told him that by traveling all of next day they would hardly be
able to reach the mountain, which is one of the loftiest of that
section.</p>

<p>The truth of Mul-tal-la’s words was evident when, after fully
four hours of brisk walking, they camped on the bank of a small
creek and saw the sun sink behind the mountain peak, which appeared
to be as far away as ever. The plain was still treeless, and the
fire kindled on the gently sloping bank was of dry buffalo chips
such as had already done them service. Before daylight had departed
the horizon was scanned with the aid of the spyglass without discovering
anything of an unusual character.</p>

<p>It was the turn of the red men to act as sentinels, and Deerfoot
quietly said that he would take the first watch, calling the Blackfoot
when he thought proper. As usual, he read a chapter from his Bible.
After he had finished and the devotions of all were over, he again
took out the book, placing himself so that enough light fell upon
the pages to permit him to read. The last sight that the boys
had of him was in this motionless posture and occasionally turning
a leaf. Thus he sat when the three sank into restful slumber.
The succulent grass was so abundant that the horses, relieved
of saddles, bridles and burdens, were left free to crop as long
as they chose and to sleep when the notion came to them.</p>

<p>A half hour after his friends had fallen asleep Deerfoot put
away his book and rose to his feet. It was profoundly still. On
his right flowed the slightly muddy stream, no more than fifty
feet wide and of shallow depth. In other directions stretched
the slightly rolling prairie until lost in the gloom. The moon
was near the full, but its light was treacherous and uncertain
because of the masses of clouds that slowly drifted across its
face. At times one could see quite clearly for a hundred yards
or more, and then the shadows crept up to the camp, whose fire
threw out comparatively little light. Now and then the watchful
sentinel was able to detect the dim outlines of the farther shore,
even when the surface of the stream did not reflect the mild glow
of the fire.</p>

<p>Nothing escaped his vigilant eye. It was not yet midnight when
Bug, the horse of Mul-tal-la, showed a strange restlessness. He
whinnied softly two or three times, and finally came to his feet.
Deerfoot moved silently to his side, patted his neck and spoke
soothingly. The animal showed no alarm, but rather curiosity.
His nose was pointed to the south, where he seemed to scent something
unusual.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe waited till the moon emerged from the clouds and
then peered in that direction. He could detect nothing out of
the common. He walked a little way and again waited for the moon’s
face to become unveiled. Still all looked the same as before.
He went back to Bug and found him in the former position, with
ears pricked forward, nose thrust slightly out and breathing more
rapidly than was his wont. The other horses gave no sign of disturbance.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was puzzled. He felt that if this dumb brute was
able to detect the approach of danger he ought to do the same.
Kneeling, he pressed one ear against the damp ground.</p>

<p>As he did so he was sensible of a faint rhythmic, velvet-like
tremor, which was inaudible when he raised his head. Using the
earth again as a medium, he listened and brought all his faculties
into play. The singular pulsation neither increased nor diminished.
The best comparison he could make was to that of the multitudinous
tramping of thousands of tiny feet upon the earth miles away,
recalling the gradual subsidence of the racket created by the
stamping of the bison. Deerfoot knew it was not produced by those
animals. It could not have been elk or deer, for they never herded
in such vast numbers, nor could it have been made by wolves, since
their tread was too soft for the sound to penetrate far.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was mystified. Rising to his feet again he stood
gazing southward, wondering what strange thing was to come out
of the flickering moonlight. But none appeared, and hearing a
movement of Bug, he turned and saw him disposing himself for the
night. He lay down on the grassy earth, prepared to continue the
rest which had been broken so curiously. [Illustration: "‘Helloa!’"]</p>

<p>This looked as if the uneasiness of the horse was over. A few
minutes later Deerfoot again placed his ear against the ground.
Immediately he was aware that that faint, tremulous throbbing
which had so mystified him was passing away. Whatever had caused
it was receding, and soon the silence became as profound as before.
He was still at a loss to understand its nature, though he thought
it was produced by animals treading the earth in immense numbers.</p>

<p>Walking back to camp, he noted the three unconscious forms wrapped
in their blankets, for there was enough sharpness in the air to
make the warmth pleasant and little heat was given out by the
fire. The Shawanoe paused just far enough away to be revealed
dimly in the subdued glow, and was leaning on his rifle, listening,
looking and meditating, when the stillness was broken by a single
exclamation:</p>

<p>"<em>Helloa!</em>"</p>

<p>It was the voice of a white man on the other side of the stream
which ran close to the camp. The face of the moon happened to
be clear at that moment, and glancing across, Deerfoot saw a shadowy
figure standing on the edge of the water. The head and front of
a horse showed at his side, and he was evidently studying the
camp upon which he had come.</p>

<p>Deerfoot straightened up and promptly called back:</p>

<p>"Helloa! Come over and see us."</p>

<p>As he spoke he walked down to the edge of the stream, as if to
meet the stranger, who in a cheery voice replied:</p>

<p>"That suits me. I was thinkin’ of doin’ that same thing,"</p>

<p>He was seen to swing himself upon the back of his horse, whose
ribs he kicked with his heels and ordered forward. The animal
stepped with some hesitation into the water, snuffing and feeling
his way. He had advanced only two or three paces when Deerfoot
observed that he was followed by two other horses, each of which
carried a large pack on his back. The distance was short, but
it took some time for the three animals to ford the stream, which
was no more than two or three feet deep, with a bottom of soft
mud.</p>

<p>The moment the leader touched dry land the man slipped from the
saddle and extended his hand.</p>

<p>"Why, you’re an Injin!" he exclaimed. "I didn’t think that, but
I’m powerful glad to see you."</p>

<p>"And Deerfoot is glad to see his brother," replied the smiling
Shawanoe, returning the pressure of the other.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the white man, peering closely into the
countenance as dimly seen in the firelight.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot, and a Shawanoe by birth."</p>

<p>"Shawanoe," repeated the white man. "I don’t remember havin’
heerd tell of them varmints—that is of that <em>tribe</em>," he
corrected with a laugh; "no offence."</p>

<p>"Their home is a good many miles from here, in Ohio."</p>

<p>"Ah! that explains it. I’ve seed worse lookin’ redskins than
you."</p>

<p>"And plenty better ones," said Deerfoot rather taken with the
off-hand manner of the newcomer.</p>

<p>"Dunno ’bout that. There are a few good ones among the redskins
and some powerful mean ones. I’m suited with you so fur, from
the ground up."</p>

<p>The visitor was of massive frame, fully six feet high, broad
in proportion, with a grizzly beard that covered his face to the
eyes and flowed over his breast. He was dressed like a half-civilized
Indian, wearing a fur cap, thick shoes instead of moccasins, and
with a heavy, loose coat flung over his deerskin hunting shirt.
He had a strong, well-formed nose and bright gray eyes, which
peered keenly from under his shaggy brows. His voice was deep,
and with a genial musical tone which was pleasing and fitted well
his frank manner. He shifted his long rifle to his left hand when
he extended the other to the Shawanoe and scanned him with a sharpness
evidently acquired by his long experience on the prairies and
in the mountains.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is glad to meet his brother. He hopes he will stay
for the rest of the night with him and his friends."</p>

<p>"Who mought they be?" asked the man, looking around at the three
forms wrapped in blankets near the fire. The boys were sleeping
quietly, and even the Blackfoot did not seem to have been disturbed
by the rather boisterous greeting of the visitor.</p>

<p>"Afore you tell me about ’em, I guess I may as well unship my
rudder," added the latter, who proceeded deliberately to remove
the loads from the other two horses and place them on the ground.
Then each was freed from his belongings and given a resounding
slap in turn:</p>

<p>"Off with you and none of your tricks. If I haven’t cured you
of tryin’ to sneak off I’ll cure you in the mornin’, and don’t
you forget it."</p>

<p>His own horse kicked up his heels, flirted his head and led the
way, the others soberly following out into the gloom till they
came to the place where the animals of our friends were reposing.
There was some neighing, meant for greetings, and then no further
attention was given by them to one another.</p>

<p>Deerfoot flung some chips on the blaze and sat down, inviting
his visitor by a gesture to do the same. He assumed a lolling
posture and produced a short black clay pipe. Crumbling some plug
tobacco in the palm of his hand, he poked it into the bowl with
his forefinger and lit it from the fire.</p>

<p>"My name is Jack Halloway," he said, after several puffs. "I’ve
spent the winter in the mountains, trapping beaver and foxes and
sich, and am on my way to St. Louis with a good load of peltries.
I’ve had better luck than usual and am later in gettin’ back than
is gin’rally the case, but it paid to wait, though I did have
some trouble with the Snake Injins. Howsumever, you said you was
goin’ to tell me ’bout your friends that seem to be sleepin’ powerful
heavy like."</p>

<p>Deerfoot had decided that no harm could come from telling this
man the truth about himself and his companions, and he now did
so. The Indian belonged to the Blackfoot tribe, and had been on
a visit a long way to the east. Deerfoot had agreed to accompany
him on his return home, but hoped to be with his own friends again
the following year. Then he told of the twin boys, sons of a friend
of his. One was going into a decline because of grief over the
loss of his parent, and it was agreed that the only cure was through
diverting his thoughts and energies by this long and hard journey.
That no mistake had been made was proved long before, for the
lad had gained so rapidly in strength and spirits that he was
his former self again and physically the equal of his brother
in every respect.</p>

<p>Jack Halloway listened with close interest, for the story was
remarkable. He sagely remarked, however, that if the boys had
been so greatly benefited the wisest thing to do was for the three
to turn back and allow the Blackfoot to finish his journey alone.</p>

<p>"I jedge from what I’ve heerd that you’re a powerful cute Injin
and know that, though you’re a good many miles from St. Louis,
you ain’t half way to the Pacific yit. I’ve never been there myself,
but I know ’nough of the mountains and Injins to know that the
job is the biggest thing in all creation. Depend upon it, Shawanoe,
<em>you’ll never get home onless you turn back now</em>!"</p>

<p>This was said with great earnestness, the trapper nodding his
head and slapping his knee with his palm.</p>

<p>"The words of my brother are wise, but it would sadden the hearts
of my brothers if we went home, and he who was ill would become
ill again and die."</p>

<p>"See here, younker, own up now; it’s <em>you</em> who’d feel
the worst."</p>

<p>And to help make his meaning clear, Jack Halloway leaned over
and thrust his thumb into the ribs of Deerfoot and chuckled. The
Shawanoe could not help smiling.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot can never be happy till he looks upon the face of the
great water that lies far toward the setting sun. He must go on."</p>

<p>"Wal, you’re boss of the job, as I can see from what you say,
but I want to tell you one thing that you don’t know."</p>

<p>"There are many things that Deerfoot doesn’t know."</p>

<p>The trapper glanced around, as if afraid of being overheard,
and then lowered his voice almost to a whisper as he leaned toward
him:</p>

<p>"The varmints in the mountains that you’ve got to git through
are gettin’ more cantankerous than ever. I’ve trapped and hunted
among ’em for nigh onto twenty year, and never had as much trouble
as last winter. I’ve been told by the boys that come down the
Missouri in the spring that there’s just as good huntin’ and trappin’
up that way, and the varmints don’t bother ’em half as much as
out here; so I’ve made up my mind to strike out for that part
of the world next fall when I go for the beaver runs agin."</p>

<p>Jack Halloway was not slow to see that his warnings were thrown
away on the young Shawanoe, and was discreet enough to take another
line. He puffed his lips for some minutes, continually glancing
at Deerfoot, who tried to act as if unconscious of this scrutiny,
which at times became embarrassing. Suddenly the trapper started
like a man who had forgotten something.</p>

<p>"That’s powerful qu’ar," he said, "and I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>While speaking he was groping hurriedly through an interior pocket
of his coat, and now brought forth a flask and twisted the cork
from it.</p>

<p>"I allers take a keg of it into the mountains, for there’s no
thin’ like it when you find the weather a bit too cold, and it’s
just as good when it’s too hot or you’ve got the blue devils and
don’t feel right. After you."</p>

<p>And he leaned over and reached the flask to Deerfoot.</p>
