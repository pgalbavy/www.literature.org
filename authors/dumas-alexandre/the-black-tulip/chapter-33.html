<P>Van Baerle, led by four guards, who pushed their way through 
the crowd, sidled up to the black tulip, towards which his 
gaze was attracted with increasing interest the nearer he 
approached to it.</P>
<P>He saw it at last, that unique flower, which he was to see 
once and no more. He saw it at the distance of six paces, 
and was delighted with its perfection and gracefulness; he 
saw it surrounded by young and beautiful girls, who formed, 
as it were, a guard of honour for this queen of excellence 
and purity. And yet, the more he ascertained with his own 
eyes the perfection of the flower, the more wretched and 
miserable he felt. He looked all around for some one to whom 
he might address only one question, but his eyes everywhere 
met strange faces, and the attention of all was directed 
towards the chair of state, on which the Stadtholder had 
seated himself.</P>
<P>William rose, casting a tranquil glance over the 
enthusiastic crowd, and his keen eyes rested by turns on the 
three extremities of a triangle formed opposite to him by 
three persons of very different interests and feelings.</P>
<P>At one of the angles, Boxtel, trembling with impatience, and 
quite absorbed in watching the Prince, the guilders, the 
black tulip, and the crowd.</P>
<P>At the other, Cornelius, panting for breath, silent, and his 
attention, his eyes, his life, his heart, his love, quite 
concentrated on the black tulip.</P>
<P>And thirdly, standing on a raised step among the maidens of 
Haarlem, a beautiful Frisian girl, dressed in fine scarlet 
woollen cloth, embroidered with silver, and covered with a 
lace veil, which fell in rich folds from her head-dress of 
gold brocade; in one word, Rosa, who, faint and with 
swimming eyes, was leaning on the arm of one of the officers 
of William.</P>
<P>The Prince then slowly unfolded the parchment, and said, 
with a calm clear voice, which, although low, made itself 
perfectly heard amidst the respectful silence, which all at 
once arrested the breath of fifty thousand spectators.  - </P>
<P>&quot;You know what has brought us here?</P>
<P>&quot;A prize of one hundred thousand guilders has been promised 
to whosoever should grow the black tulip.</P>
<P>&quot;The black tulip has been grown; here it is before your 
eyes, coming up to all the conditions required by the 
programme of the Horticultural Society of Haarlem.</P>
<P>&quot;The history of its production, and the name of its grower, 
will be inscribed in the book of honour of the city.</P>
<P>&quot;Let the person approach to whom the black tulip belongs.&quot;</P>
<P>In pronouncing these words, the Prince, to judge of the 
effect they produced, surveyed with his eagle eye the three 
extremities of the triangle.</P>
<P>He saw Boxtel rushing forward. He saw Cornelius make an 
involuntary movement; and lastly he saw the officer who was 
taking care of Rosa lead, or rather push her forward towards 
him.</P>
<P>At the sight of Rosa, a double cry arose on the right and 
left of the Prince.</P>
<P>Boxtel, thunderstruck, and Cornelius, in joyful amazement, 
both exclaimed,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Rosa! Rosa!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This tulip is yours, is it not, my child?&quot; said the Prince.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Monseigneur,&quot; stammered Rosa, whose striking beauty 
excited a general murmur of applause.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh!&quot; muttered Cornelius, &quot;she has then belied me, when she 
said this flower was stolen from her. Oh! that's why she 
left Loewestein. Alas! am I then forgotten, betrayed by her 
whom I thought my best friend on earth?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh!&quot; sighed Boxtel, &quot;I am lost.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This tulip,&quot; continued the Prince, &quot;will therefore bear the 
name of its producer, and figure in the catalogue under the 
title, Tulipa nigra Rosa Barlaensis, because of the name Van 
Baerle, which will henceforth be the name of this damsel.&quot;</P>
<P>And at the same time William took Rosa's hand, and placed it 
in that of a young man, who rushed forth, pale and beyond 
himself with joy, to the foot of the throne saluting 
alternately the Prince and his bride; and who with a 
grateful look to heaven, returned his thanks to the Giver of 
all this happiness.</P>
<P>At the same moment there fell at the feet of the President 
van Systens another man, struck down by a very different 
emotion.</P>
<P>Boxtel, crushed by the failure of his hopes, lay senseless 
on the ground.</P>
<P>When they raised him, and examined his pulse and his heart, 
he was quite dead.</P>
<P>This incident did not much disturb the festival, as neither 
the Prince nor the President seemed to mind it much.</P>
<P>Cornelius started back in dismay, when in the thief, in the 
pretended Jacob, he recognised his neighbour, Isaac Boxtel, 
whom, in the innocence of his heart, he had not for one 
instant suspected of such a wicked action.</P>
<P>Then, to the sound of trumpets, the procession marched back 
without any change in its order, except that Boxtel was now 
dead, and that Cornelius and Rosa were walking triumphantly 
side by side and hand in hand.</P>
<P>On their arriving at the Hotel de Ville, the Prince, 
pointing with his finger to the purse with the hundred 
thousand guilders, said to Cornelius,  - </P>
<P>&quot;It is difficult to say by whom this money is gained, by you 
or by Rosa; for if you have found the black tulip, she has 
nursed it and brought it into flower. It would therefore be 
unjust to consider it as her dowry; it is the gift of the 
town of Haarlem to the tulip.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius wondered what the Prince was driving at. The 
latter continued,  - </P>
<P>&quot;I give to Rosa the sum of a hundred thousand guilders, 
which she has fairly earned, and which she can offer to you. 
They are the reward of her love, her courage, and her 
honesty. As to you, Sir  -  thanks to Rosa again, who has 
furnished the proofs of your innocence  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>And, saying these words, the Prince handed to Cornelius that 
fly-leaf of the Bible on which was written the letter of 
Cornelius de Witt, and in which the third bulb had been 
wrapped,  - </P>
<P>&quot;As to you, it has come to light that you were imprisoned 
for a crime which you had not committed. This means, that 
you are not only free, but that your property will be 
restored to you; as the property of an innocent man cannot 
be confiscated. Cornelius van Baerle, you are the godson of 
Cornelius de Witt and the friend of his brother John. Remain 
worthy of the name you have received from one of them, and 
of the friendship you have enjoyed with the other. The two 
De Witts, wrongly judged and wrongly punished in a moment of 
popular error, were two great citizens, of whom Holland is 
now proud.&quot;</P>
<P>The Prince, after these last words, which contrary to his 
custom, he pronounced with a voice full of emotion, gave his 
hands to the lovers to kiss, whilst they were kneeling 
before him.</P>
<P>Then heaving a sigh, he said,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Alas! you are very happy, who, dreaming only of what 
perhaps is the true glory of Holland, and forms especially 
her true happiness, do not attempt to acquire for her 
anything beyond new colours of tulips.&quot;</P>
<P>And, casting a glance towards that point of the compass 
where France lay, as if he saw new clouds gathering there, 
he entered his carriage and drove off.</P>
<P>Cornelius started on the same day for Dort with Rosa, who 
sent her lover's old housekeeper as a messenger to her 
father, to apprise him of all that had taken place.</P>
<P>Those who, thanks to our description, have learned the 
character of old Gryphus, will comprehend that it was hard 
for him to become reconciled to his son-in-law. He had not 
yet forgotten the blows which he had received in that famous 
encounter. To judge from the weals which he counted, their 
number, he said, amounted to forty-one; but at last, in 
order, as he declared, not to be less generous than his 
Highness the Stadtholder, he consented to make his peace.</P>
<P>Appointed to watch over the tulips, the old man made the 
rudest keeper of flowers in the whole of the Seven 
Provinces.</P>
<P>It was indeed a sight to see him watching the obnoxious 
moths and butterflies, killing slugs, and driving away the 
hungry bees.</P>
<P>As he had heard Boxtel's story, and was furious at having 
been the dupe of the pretended Jacob, he destroyed the 
sycamore behind which the envious Isaac had spied into the 
garden; for the plot of ground belonging to him had been 
bought by Cornelius, and taken into his own garden.</P>
<P>Rosa, growing not only in beauty, but in wisdom also, after 
two years of her married life, could read and write so well 
that she was able to undertake by herself the education of 
two beautiful children which she had borne in 1674 and 1675, 
both in May, the month of flowers.</P>
<P>As a matter of course, one was a boy, the other a girl, the 
former being called Cornelius, the other Rosa.</P>
<P>Van Baerle remained faithfully attached to Rosa and to his 
tulips. The whole of his life was devoted to the happiness 
of his wife and the culture of flowers, in the latter of 
which occupations he was so successful that a great number 
of his varieties found a place in the catalogue of Holland.</P>
<P>The two principal ornaments of his drawing-room were those 
two leaves from the Bible of Cornelius de Witt, in large 
golden frames; one of them containing the letter in which 
his godfather enjoined him to burn the correspondence of the 
Marquis de Louvois, and the other his own will, in which he 
bequeathed to Rosa his bulbs under condition that she should 
marry a young man of from twenty-six to twenty-eight years, 
who loved her and whom she loved, a condition which was 
scrupulously fulfilled, although, or rather because, 
Cornelius did not die.</P>
<P>And to ward off any envious attempts of another Isaac 
Boxtel, he wrote over his door the lines which Grotius had, 
on the day of his flight, scratched on the walls of his 
prison:  - </P>
<P>&quot;Sometimes one has suffered so much that he has the right 
never to be able to say, 'I am too happy.'&quot; </P></article>
