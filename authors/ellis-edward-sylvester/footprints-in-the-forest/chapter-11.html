<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The situation was most peculiar for all three concerned. Despite
the vigilance and woodcraft of Deerfoot the Shawanoe, he had allowed
an enemy to creep up behind him and secure an advantage which
could not be overcome. In the common parlance of the West, the
Pawnee had the drop on the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>But Hay-uta the Sauk was too deeply attached to the matchless
young warrior to permit harm to befall him. He learned from his
companion that it was not his purpose to shoot Deerfoot, but simply
to keep him covered with his gun until he surrendered. Hay-uta
decided to permit this, because he believed no harm to his friend
could result, and he saw the possibility of showing a chivalry
toward the Pawnee which might win his friendship.</p>

<p>Having made sure the warrior did not mean to fire, Hay-uta kept
a few paces in the background, while the two noiselessly advanced
a half-dozen steps or more. It would have been the easiest thing
in the world for the Sauk to apprise Deerfoot of his danger! a
slight rustling of the leaves was all that was wanted. But it
was not done, for, as I have said, Hay-uta was convinced that
no immediate danger threatened his friend.</p>

<p>Sauk and Pawnee stood motionless until Deerfoot was seen to be
shaking with silent laughter. The sight of the two warriors running
for life from the camp-fire in the open space satisfied the Pawnee
that the youth had done his best to kill them, and was amused
to see their fright at the moment when they were not in the slightest
peril.</p>

<p>The Pawnee now purposely rustled the leaves with his moccasin.
The Shawanoe faced about like a flash. As he did so, Hay-uta,
standing just back of the captor, made a gesture to his friend.
Deerfoot "caught on", and dropped his hands to his side, to signify
his surrender. He divined the situation, and, schooled as he was
in self-control, it was hard for him to restrain a smile over
the thought of the trick played on the Pawnee. Probably no man
was ever "fooled" to a more astounding extent than he was at that
moment.</p>

<p>The only thing feared by Deerfoot was that some of the other
Pawnees would soon reach the spot and complicate matters, but,
while the apparent conqueror was sanguine that he commanded the
situation, Deerfoot knew he was master from the first.</p>

<p>Looking straight at the Pawnee, he slowly said:</p>

<p>"My brother the Sauk is wise; his companion is a Pawnee; let
no harm befall him, for he has done no harm to us; but other Pawnees
may soon be here; let Hay-uta point his rifle at the Pawnee so
that he will turn his gun away from Deerfoot."</p>

<p>While speaking the Shawanoe kept his eyes fixed on those of the
Pawnee, who, of course, supposed the words were addressed to him.
He could not catch their meaning, but no doubt believed they referred
to the completeness of the surrender just made. Had he been an
aboriginal linguist, how different would have been his feelings!</p>

<p>Having dropped his hands, and spoken his sentences, Deerfoot
waited the action of Hay-uta.</p>

<p>The latter still held the hammer of his rifle at full cock, and
he instantly leveled it at the Pawnee, harshly ordering him to
lower his weapon.</p>

<p>The Pawnee was surprised. I am aware that this is stating it
mildly, but so would it be if I used the strongest words at command.
He seemed transfixed, and actually was unable to stir or even
to lower his gun. But the action of his companion told the truth,
and it must be believed that he was filled with biting chagrin
because he was not acute enough to know that the aliens (one of
whom seemed to come from the east and the other from the west)
were allies.</p>

<p>However, the tables were turned and no choice was left him. Down
came his gun, the hammer was lowered and the stock dropped spitefully
to the ground. It was the Shawanoe and Sauk who now "had the drop"
on the Pawnee.</p>

<p>By way of putting matters in a business-like shape, Deerfoot
called to Hay-uta to keep his gun at a level, while he disarmed
the prisoner. The Sauk obeyed, and Deerfoot walked quietly forward,
and in the most matter-of-fact manner drew the knife of the Pawnee
from its sheath at his girdle, extracted his tomahawk, and then
gently removed the rifle from his nerveless grasp. Distributing
the first two weapons about his person, the Shawanoe stepped back
several paces, holding his bow in one hand and the gun in the
other.</p>

<p>Supposing Hay-uta had not been present, what would have been
the result?</p>

<p>I haven't a particle of doubt that the Pawnee would have been
vanquished by Deerfoot. The former could not have stood forever
with his gun aimed, and when he lowered it he would have presented
an "opening" of which the Shawanoe would have availed himself
with the quickness of the lighting stroke.</p>

<p>While Deerfoot was disarming the sinewy warrior, Hay-uta explained
his wish to show him such consideration as to win his friendship.
That being done, probably some way would open by which he could
be used in tracing Otto Relstaub.</p>

<p>"My brother is wise," commented Deerfoot, who admired the cleverness
of the Sauk, "but let him beware that the Pawnee does not betray
him."</p>

<p>No one would have supposed from the deliberation of the Shawanoe
that he was in fear of any thing, but, if it can be said that
he was ever nervous over any thing, such was his condition now,
through fear of irruption by a part or all of the Pawnee war-party.
He felt that the danger increased every moment.</p>

<p>No time, therefore, was lost. The Pawnee was directed to move
on, the course taken being directly away from the camp-fire, and
close to the open space between the woods and river. No fault
could be found with the promptness displayed by the captive, who
strode off as though on his way to a marriage feast.</p>

<p>It was not necessary to keep a close watch over the prisoner,
since the most he could do was to try to ran away, and he was
not likely to attempt that when two loaded guns almost touched
him.</p>

<p>But the Pawnee did do something, which, under the circumstances,
was a daring act.</p>

<p>The procession had proceeded for a hundred feet or so, when he
gave utterance to a ringing whoop, which could have been heard
a half mile. Deerfoot was astounded, and half raised the gun with
the intention of shooting him, but he changed his mind before
the weapon reached his shoulder.</p>

<p>But never did the Shawanoe display quicker readiness of resource
than then. The Pawnee acted as though he believed his life would
pay for what he had done, for, being a barbarian, he must have
felt from the first that no mercy awaited him. Wheeling around,
he folded his arms, straightened up and looked defiantly at the
Shawanoe, saying plainly by his actions:</p>

<p>"I am ready; look and see a warrior die!"</p>

<p>But Deerfoot did a much wiser thing. Convinced that the whoop
was a summons for help, he managed to impress the Pawnee with
the fact, that the only way to save his life was to send a second
signal, the import of which would be that he was in no need of
help and had no news to give, but would be glad to receive any
tidings his friends possessed.</p>

<p>It required some vigorous sign language on the part of Deerfoot
to bring the Pawnee to his views. One of the most convincing arguments,
however, was the thunder-cloud on the face of the Shawanoe, and
the upraised tomahawk, poised and ready to be buried in the skull
of the captive.</p>

<p>And so the desired message was sent from the throat of the frightened
Pawnee. Deerfoot could not be certain that the cry conveyed the
meaning he desired, but he noticed that the modulation of the
voice was different and he was almost satisfied on the point.</p>

<p>As a matter of precaution, he now fell to the rear, directing
Hay-uta to take care of the captive. He was at liberty to shoot
him if he made a break for freedom, and there was little doubt
that Hay-uta would do so.</p>

<p>As for the Shawanoe, he meant to keep watch for the other Pawnees,
who were now all behind them. Even if their prisoner had countermanded
his call for help, little time could elapse before Lone Bear and
Red Wolf would make known how recently they had seen the dusky
demon. Of course they would suppress the part they had played
in the proceeding, but would be likely to send a large party after
the Shawanoe, as soon as it could be brought together.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, therefore, dropped a hundred feet to the rear, still
carrying the captured gun and his bow, and half disposed to make
a compulsory trade with the Pawnee. He could hardly convince himself,
however, that such a proceeding would be pleasing to the Great
Spirit, and he put the temptation behind him.</p>

<p>He was on the lookout for the warriors who had shown themselves
so plentiful only a short time before. His purpose was to apprise
Hay-uta the moment they appeared, when without a second's delay,
the two would dash off, leaving their prisoner to return to his
friends. In the event of such an issue, as it would be impossible
to make a friend of their captive, the Sauk favored sending a
bullet through him before parting; but Deerfoot was so emphatic
in protesting against such savagery, that Hay-uta promised to
obey him.</p>

<p>Succeeding events left no doubt that the prisoner did precisely
as ordered by his captor; that is to say, he recalled his first
signal and notified his comrades that he had no need of their
presence.</p>

<p>When, some minutes later, several of the Pawnees straggled back
to camp, they found Red Wolf and Lone Bear awaiting them. The
former looked as if he had been put to soak for several days in
the river, while Lone Bear was weak from the fright he had received.
He did not blush, when he made the statement that the young demon
had appeared but a few minutes before on the margin of the wood,
accompanied by seven warriors, and that they instantly opened
by launching arrow after arrow in the direction of the Pawnees.</p>

<p>Red Wolf said that he hastened to the river bank with a view
of securing a spot from which to reconnoiter their enemies, but
he caught his foot in a root and fell into the water; that accounted
for his moist condition.</p>

<p>The warrior had hardly reached that point in his narrative, when
he perceived that he had gone too far. Indian scouts, when stealing
along the banks of a stream, are not apt to roll into it and under
the surface, either accidentally or for the fun of the thing.
The Pawnee, therefore, told the truth, except that he joined Lone
Bear in declaring that their foe was accompanied by seven others,
who seemed as eager as he to slay them.</p>

<p>It would seem that the fact that none of the other Pawnees had
discovered any of the seven, would have discredited the statement
of Red Wolf and Lone Bear; but the two were so strenuous in their
declaration that it produced the effect desired. Some of the listeners
believed there was a large party of enemies at hand, and prudence
demanded that their own warriors should be called together and
precautions taken against surprise.</p>

<p>It was accordingly so done.</p>
