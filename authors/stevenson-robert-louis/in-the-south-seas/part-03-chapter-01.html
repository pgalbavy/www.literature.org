<p>At Honolulu we had said farewell to the <u>Casco</u> and to Captain Otis, and
our next adventure was made in changed conditions.  Passage was taken for
myself, my wife, Mr. Osbourne, and my China boy, Ah Fu, on a pigmy
trading schooner, the <u>Equator</u>, Captain Dennis Reid; and on a certain
bright June day in 1889, adorned in the Hawaiian fashion with the
garlands of departure, we drew out of port and bore with a fair wind for
Micronesia.
</p>
<p>The whole extent of the South Seas is a desert of ships; more especially
that part where we were now to sail.  No post runs in these islands;
communication is by accident; where you may have designed to go is one
thing, where you shall be able to arrive another.  It was my hope, for
instance, to have reached the Carolines, and returned to the light of day
by way of Manila and the China ports; and it was in Samoa that we were
destined to re-appear and be once more refreshed with the sight of
mountains.  Since the sunset faded from the peaks of Oahu six months had
intervened, and we had seen no spot of earth so high as an ordinary
cottage.  Our path had been still on the flat sea, our dwellings upon
unerected coral, our diet from the pickle-tub or out of tins; I had
learned to welcome shark’s flesh for a variety; and a mountain, an onion,
an Irish potato or a beef-steak, had been long lost to sense and dear to
aspiration.
</p><p>The two chief places of our stay, Butaritari and Apemama, lie near the
line; the latter within thirty miles.  Both enjoy a superb ocean climate,
days of blinding sun and bracing wind, nights of a heavenly brightness.
Both are somewhat wider than Fakarava, measuring perhaps (at the widest)
a quarter of a mile from beach to beach.  In both, a coarse kind of
<u>taro</u> thrives; its culture is a chief business of the natives, and the
consequent mounds and ditches make miniature scenery and amuse the eye.
In all else they show the customary features of an atoll: the low
horizon, the expanse of the lagoon, the sedge-like rim of palm-tops, the
sameness and smallness of the land, the hugely superior size and interest
of sea and sky.  Life on such islands is in many points like life on
shipboard.  The atoll, like the ship, is soon taken for granted; and the
islanders, like the ship’s crew, become soon the centre of attention.
The isles are populous, independent, seats of kinglets, recently
civilised, little visited.  In the last decade many changes have crept
in; women no longer go unclothed till marriage; the widow no longer
sleeps at night and goes abroad by day with the skull of her dead
husband; and, fire-arms being introduced, the spear and the shark-tooth
sword are sold for curiosities.  Ten years ago all these things and
practices were to be seen in use; yet ten years more, and the old society
will have entirely vanished.  We came in a happy moment to see its
institutions still erect and (in Apemama) scarce decayed.
</p><p>Populous and independent—warrens of men, ruled over with some rustic
pomp—such was the first and still the recurring impression of these tiny
lands.  As we stood across the lagoon for the town of Butaritari, a
stretch of the low shore was seen to be crowded with the brown roofs of
houses; those of the palace and king’s summer parlour (which are of
corrugated iron) glittered near one end conspicuously bright; the royal
colours flew hard by on a tall flagstaff; in front, on an artificial
islet, the gaol played the part of a martello.  Even upon this first and
distant view, the place had scarce the air of what it truly was, a
village; rather of that which it was also, a petty metropolis, a city
rustic and yet royal.
</p><p>The lagoon is shoal.  The tide being out, we waded for some quarter of a
mile in tepid shallows, and stepped ashore at last into a flagrant
stagnancy of sun and heat.  The lee side of a line island after noon is
indeed a breathless place; on the ocean beach the trade will be still
blowing, boisterous and cool; out in the lagoon it will be blowing also,
speeding the canoes; but the screen of bush completely intercepts it from
the shore, and sleep and silence and companies of mosquitoes brood upon
the towns.
</p><p>We may thus be said to have taken Butaritari by surprise.  A few
inhabitants were still abroad in the north end, at which we landed.  As
we advanced, we were soon done with encounter, and seemed to explore a
city of the dead.  Only, between the posts of open houses, we could see
the townsfolk stretched in the siesta, sometimes a family together veiled
in a mosquito-net, sometimes a single sleeper on a platform like a corpse
on a bier.
</p><p>The houses were of all dimensions, from those of toys to those of
churches.  Some might hold a battalion, some were so minute they could
scarce receive a pair of lovers; only in the playroom, when the toys are
mingled, do we meet such incongruities of scale.  Many were open sheds;
some took the form of roofed stages; others were walled and the walls
pierced with little windows.  A few were perched on piles in the lagoon;
the rest stood at random on a green, through which the roadway made a
ribbon of sand, or along the embankments of a sheet of water like a
shallow dock.  One and all were the creatures of a single tree; palm-tree
wood and palm-tree leaf their materials; no nail had been driven, no
hammer sounded, in their building, and they were held together by
lashings of palm-tree sinnet.
</p><p>In the midst of the thoroughfare, the church stands like an island, a
lofty and dim house with rows of windows; a rich tracery of framing
sustains the roof; and through the door at either end the street shows in
a vista.  The proportions of the place, in such surroundings, and built
of such materials, appeared august; and we threaded the nave with a
sentiment befitting visitors in a cathedral.  Benches run along either
side.  In the midst, on a crazy dais, two chairs stand ready for the king
and queen when they shall choose to worship; over their heads a hoop,
apparently from a hogshead, depends by a strip of red cotton; and the
hoop (which hangs askew) is dressed with streamers of the same material,
red and white.
</p><p>This was our first advertisement of the royal dignity, and presently we
stood before its seat and centre.  The palace is built of imported wood
upon a European plan; the roof of corrugated iron, the yard enclosed with
walls, the gate surmounted by a sort of lych-house.  It cannot be called
spacious; a labourer in the States is sometimes more commodiously lodged;
but when we had the chance to see it within, we found it was enriched
(beyond all island expectation) with coloured advertisements and cuts
from the illustrated papers.  Even before the gate some of the treasures
of the crown stand public: a bell of a good magnitude, two pieces of
cannon, and a single shell.  The bell cannot be rung nor the guns fired;
they are curiosities, proofs of wealth, a part of the parade of the
royalty, and stand to be admired like statues in a square.  A straight
gut of water like a canal runs almost to the palace door; the containing
quay-walls excellently built of coral; over against the mouth, by what
seems an effect of landscape art, the martello-like islet of the gaol
breaks the lagoon.  Vassal chiefs with tribute, neighbour monarchs come
a-roving, might here sail in, view with surprise these extensive public
works, and be awed by these mouths of silent cannon.  It was impossible
to see the place and not to fancy it designed for pageantry.  But the
elaborate theatre then stood empty; the royal house deserted, its doors
and windows gaping; the whole quarter of the town immersed in silence.
On the opposite bank of the canal, on a roofed stage, an ancient
gentleman slept publicly, sole visible inhabitant; and beyond on the
lagoon a canoe spread a striped lateen, the sole thing moving.
</p><p>The canal is formed on the south by a pier or causeway with a parapet.
At the far end the parapet stops, and the quay expands into an oblong
peninsula in the lagoon, the breathing-place and summer parlour of the
king.  The midst is occupied by an open house or permanent marquee—called
here a maniapa, or, as the word is now pronounced, a maniap’—at the
lowest estimation forty feet by sixty.  The iron roof, lofty but
exceedingly low-browed, so that a woman must stoop to enter, is supported
externally on pillars of coral, within by a frame of wood.  The floor is
of broken coral, divided in aisles by the uprights of the frame; the
house far enough from shore to catch the breeze, which enters freely and
disperses the mosquitoes; and under the low eaves the sun is seen to
glitter and the waves to dance on the lagoon.
</p><p>It was now some while since we had met any but slumberers; and when we
had wandered down the pier and stumbled at last into this bright shed, we
were surprised to find it occupied by a society of wakeful people, some
twenty souls in all, the court and guardsmen of Butaritari.  The court
ladies were busy making mats; the guardsmen yawned and sprawled.  Half a
dozen rifles lay on a rock and a cutlass was leaned against a pillar: the
armoury of these drowsy musketeers.  At the far end, a little closed
house of wood displayed some tinsel curtains, and proved, upon
examination, to be a privy on the European model.  In front of this, upon
some mats, lolled Tebureimoa, the king; behind him, on the panels of the
house, two crossed rifles represented fasces.  He wore pyjamas which
sorrowfully misbecame his bulk; his nose was hooked and cruel, his body
overcome with sodden corpulence, his eye timorous and dull: he seemed at
once oppressed with drowsiness and held awake by apprehension: a pepper
rajah muddled with opium, and listening for the march of a Dutch army,
looks perhaps not otherwise.  We were to grow better acquainted, and
first and last I had the same impression; he seemed always drowsy, yet
always to hearken and start; and, whether from remorse or fear, there is
no doubt he seeks a refuge in the abuse of drugs.
</p><p>The rajah displayed no sign of interest in our coming.  But the queen,
who sat beside him in a purple sacque, was more accessible; and there was
present an interpreter so willing that his volubility became at last the
cause of our departure.  He had greeted us upon our entrance:—‘That is
the honourable King, and I am his interpreter,’ he had said, with more
stateliness than truth.  For he held no appointment in the court, seemed
extremely ill-acquainted with the island language, and was present, like
ourselves, upon a visit of civility.  Mr. Williams was his name: an
American darkey, runaway ship’s cook, and bar-keeper at <u>The Land we Live
in</u> tavern, Butaritari.  I never knew a man who had more words in his
command or less truth to communicate; neither the gloom of the monarch,
nor my own efforts to be distant, could in the least abash him; and when
the scene closed, the darkey was left talking.
</p><p>The town still slumbered, or had but just begun to turn and stretch
itself; it was still plunged in heat and silence.  So much the more vivid
was the impression that we carried away of the house upon the islet, the
Micronesian Saul wakeful amid his guards, and his unmelodious David, Mr.
Williams, chattering through the drowsy hours.
