<p>Lingard's soul was exalted by his talk with Mrs. Travers, by
the strain of incertitude and by extreme fatigue. On returning
on board he asked after Hassim and was told that the Rajah and
his sister had gone off in their canoe promising to return before
midnight. The boats sent to scout between the islets north and
south of the anchorage had not come back yet. He went into his
cabin and throwing himself on the couch closed his eyes thinking:
"I must sleep or I shall go mad."</p>

<p>At times he felt an unshaken confidence in Mrs. Travers&mdash;then
he remembered her face. Next moment the face would fade, he would
make an effort to hold on to the image, fail&mdash;and then become
convinced without the shadow of a doubt that he was utterly lost,
unless he let all these people be wiped off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>"They all heard that man order me out of his ship," he thought,
and thereupon for a second or so he contemplated without flinching
the lurid image of a massacre. "And yet I had to tell her that
not a hair of her head shall be touched. Not a hair."</p>

<p>And irrationally at the recollection of these words there seemed
to be no trouble of any kind left in the world. Now and then,
however, there were black instants when from sheer weariness he
thought of nothing at all; and during one of these he fell asleep,
losing the consciousness of external things as suddenly as if
he had been felled by a blow on the head.</p>

<p>When he sat up, almost before he was properly awake, his first
alarmed conviction was that he had slept the night through. There
was a light in the cuddy and through the open door of his cabin
he saw distinctly Mrs. Travers pass out of view across the lighted
space.</p>

<p>"They did come on board after all," he thought&mdash;"how is it I
haven't been called!"</p>

<p>He darted into the cuddy. Nobody! Looking up at the clock in
the skylight he was vexed to see it had stopped till his ear caught
the faint beat of the mechanism. It was going then! He could not
have been asleep more than ten minutes. He had not been on board
more than twenty!</p>

<p>So it was only a deception; he had seen no one. And yet he remembered
the turn of the head, the line of the neck, the colour of the
hair, the movement of the passing figure. He returned spiritlessly
to his state-room muttering, "No more sleep for me to-night,"
and came out directly, holding a few sheets of paper covered with
a high, angular handwriting.</p>

<p>This was Jorgenson's letter written three days before and entrusted
to Hassim. Lingard had read it already twice, but he turned up
the lamp a little higher and sat down to read it again. On the
red shield above his head the gilt sheaf of thunderbolts darting
between the initials of his name seemed to be aimed straight at
the nape of his neck as he sat with bared elbows spread on the
table, poring over the crumpled sheets. The letter began:</p>

<p>Hassim and Immada are going out to-night to look for you. You
are behind your time and every passing day makes things worse.</p>

<p>Ten days ago three of Belarab's men, who had been collecting
turtles' eggs on the islets, came flying back with a story of
a ship stranded on the outer mudflats. Belarab at once forbade
any boat from leaving the lagoon. So far good. There was a great
excitement in the village. I judge it must be a schooner&mdash;probably
some fool of a trader. However, you will know all about her when
you read this. You may say I might have pulled out to sea to have
a look for myself. But besides Belarab's orders to the contrary,
which I would attend to for the sake of example, all you are worth
in this world, Tom, is here in the Emma, under my feet, and I
would not leave my charge even for half a day. Hassim attended
the council held every evening in the shed outside Belarab's stockade.
That holy man Ningrat was for looting that vessel. Hassim reproved
him saying that the vessel probably was sent by you because no
white men were known to come inside the shoals. Belarab backed
up Hassim. Ningrat was very angry and reproached Belarab for keeping
him, Ningrat, short of opium to smoke. He began by calling him
"O! son,"  and ended by shouting, "O! you worse than an unbeliever!"
There was a hullabaloo. The followers of Tengga were ready to
interfere and you know how it is between Tengga and Belarab. Tengga
always wanted to oust Belarab, and his chances were getting pretty
good before you turned up and armed Belarab's bodyguard with muskets.
However, Hassim stopped that row, and no one was hurt that time.
Next day, which was Friday, Ningrat after reading the prayers
in the mosque talked to the people outside. He bleated and capered
like an old goat, prophesying misfortune, ruin, and extermination
if these whites were allowed to get away. He is mad but then they
think him a saint, and he had been fighting the Dutch for years
in his young days. Six of Belarab's guard marched down the village
street carrying muskets at full cock and the crowd cleared out.
Ningrat was spirited away by Tengga's men into their master's
stockade. If it was not for the fear of you turning up any moment
there would have been a party-fight that evening. I think it is
a pity Tengga is not chief of the land instead of Belarab. A brave
and foresighted man, however treacherous at heart, can always
be trusted to a certain extent. One can never get anything clear
from Belarab. Peace! Peace! You know his fad. And this fad makes
him act silly. The peace racket will get him into a row. It may
cost him his life in the end. However, Tengga does not feel himself
strong enough yet to act with his own followers only and Belarab
has, on my advice, disarmed all villagers. His men went into the
houses and took away by force all the firearms and as many spears
as they could lay hands on. The women screamed abuse of course,
but there was no resistance. A few men were seen clearing out
into the forest with their arms. Note this, for it means there
is another power beside Belarab's in the village: the growing
power of Tengga.</p>

<p>One morning&mdash;four days ago &mdash;I went to see Tengga. I found
him by the shore trimming a plank with a small hatchet while a
slave held an umbrella over his head. He is amusing himself in
building a boat just now. He threw his hatchet down to meet me
and led me by the hand to a shady spot. He told me frankly he
had sent out two good swimmers to observe the stranded vessel.
These men stole down the creek in a canoe and when on the sea
coast swam from sandbank to sandbank until they approached unobserved
&mdash;I think&mdash;to about fifty yards from that schooner What can
that craft be? I can't make it out. The men reported there were
three chiefs on board. One with a glittering eye, one a lean man
in white, and another without any hair on the face and dressed
in a different style. Could it be a woman? I don't know what to
think. I wish you were here. After a lot of chatter Tengga said:
"Six years ago I was ruler of a country and the Dutch drove me
out. The country was small but nothing is too small for them to
take. They pretended to give it back to my nephew&mdash;may he burn!
I ran away or they would have killed me. I am nothing here&mdash;but
I remember. These white people out there can not run away and
they are very few. There is perhaps a little to loot. I would
give it to my men who followed me in my calamity because I am
their chief and my father was the chief of their fathers." I pointed
out the imprudence of this. He said: "The dead do not show the
way." To this I remarked that the ignorant do not give information.
Tengga kept quiet for a while, then said: "We must not touch them
because their skin is like yours and to kill them would be wrong,
but at the bidding of you whites we may go and fight with people
of our own skin and our own faith&mdash;and that is good. I have promised
to Tuan Lingard twenty men and a prau to make war in Wajo. The
men are good and look at the prau; it is swift and strong." I
must say, Tom, the prau is the best craft of the kind I have ever
seen. I said you paid him well for the help. "And I also would
pay," says he, "if you let me have a few guns and a little powder
for my men. You and I shall share the loot of that ship outside,
and Tuan Lingard will not know. It is only a little game. You
have plenty of guns and powder under your care." He meant in the
Emma. On that I spoke out pretty straight and we got rather warm
until at last he gave me to understand that as he had about forty
followers of his own and I had only nine of Hassim's chaps to
defend the Emma with, he could very well go for me and get the
lot. "And then," says he, "I would be so strong that everybody
would be on my side." I discovered in the course of further talk
that there is a notion amongst many people that you have come
to grief in some way and won't show up here any more. After this
I saw the position was serious and I was in a hurry to get back
to the Emma, but pretending I did not care I smiled and thanked
Tengga for giving me warning of his intentions about me and the
Emma. At this he nearly choked himself with his betel quid and
fixing me with his little eyes, muttered: "Even a lizard will
give a fly the time to say its prayers." I turned my back on him
and was very thankful to get beyond the throw of a spear. I haven't
been out of the Emma since.</p>
