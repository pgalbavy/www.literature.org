<p>In the meantime Abram Storms was acting the part of a vigilant
sentinel at his station on deck.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in his mind that the mutineers were fearful
the schooner would sail away and leave them on the lonely coral
island, and they were certain, as he viewed it, to make some effort
to prevent such a disaster to them. But precisely how this was
to be done was a serious question. They knew that the captain,
having reached the <em>Coral</em>, had several rifles at command,
and would not hesitate to shoot them the instant any attempt was
made against him or little Inez, under his charge.</p>

<p>Nothing was more certain than that an unremitting watch would
be kept upon the <em>Coral</em>, and, though they might believe
there was but the single man there, yet unquestionably he commanded
the situation.</p>

<p>"They will try some trick," muttered the mate; "but I shall have
a very small opinion of myself if they win. Pomp Cooper's affection
for Inez led him to interfere, when his interference accomplished
a good deal more than he imagined. Ah!"</p>

<p>At that moment the mate heard a ghostly "Halloo!" from the shore,
and he recognized the voice as belonging to Pomp.</p>

<p>"Just as I suspected," said Storms, to himself; "they're using
the negro as a cat's-paw. Well, I'll see what they are driving
at."</p>

<p>Imitating the tones of Captain Bergen as closely as possible,
the mate shouted:</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Am you dere?" was the rather superfluous question.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Won't you let me come on board?"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I'm sick ob dis business. I hab quarreled wid Redvig an' Brazzier,
an' I want to jine you an' git away from dis place."</p>

<p>Abe Storms was not deceived for a moment by this transparent
story. He knew there had been no quarrel, but that the mutineers
had planned to get the negro on the schooner with the hope of
deceiving the captain and gaining a chance to overpower him when
off his guard.</p>

<p>"Come on out here, then," replied the mate, who quickly determined
his course of action.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant a loud splash was heard, and the head
of Pomp was descried in the moonlight, swimming toward the boat.
The mate kept himself concealed as much as he could, stepping
back when the negro began clambering up the fore-chains. Panting
from his exertion, he speedily came over the gunwale upon the
deck.</p>

<p>"Yes, cap'in, I's tired ob dem willains, an' I'm gwine-&mdash;Oh!
oh! oh!"</p>

<p>At that instant his eyes fell upon the figure of the mate, clad
in his diving-armor, with the exception of his face, which was
so clearly revealed in the moonlight that there could be no mistaking
his identity.</p>

<p>Worse than that, the mate, standing as rigid as iron, had a gleaming
revolver pointed straight at him. Pomp sank on his knees in the
most abject terror.</p>

<p>"Oh, my heben!" he chattered, clasping his hands, "I t'ought
dat you was drowned. Am you sartin dat you ain't?"</p>

<p>"I am quite well satisfied on that point. But, Pomp, get up;
I've got a word or two to say to you."</p>

<p>"I will, I will; but please p'int dat weepon some oder way."</p>

<p>The mate complied, and the African, somewhat reassured, though
still considerably frightened, listened to the words of the man
who he supposed was drowned hours before.</p>

<p>"I am alive and well, Pomp, as you can see, and so is the captain,
who is taking a short nap in the cabin. We are well armed, as
you know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yas! yas! yas!" chattered the negro.</p>

<p>"And we can sail away in the morning, at the turning of the tide,
and leave you here&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Dat's what I want you to do, an' I'll go wid you."</p>

<p>"You can't go! I know well enough what you came out here for.
You thought you would find a chance to get the upper hand of the
captain, and would let the other villains on board. There! you
needn't deny it. I understand the matter too well to be deceived."</p>

<p>"Didn't I sabe de cap'in's life?" quavered Pomp, still fearful
of the cold, measured tones of the mate.</p>

<p>"You befriended him at a critical moment, and therefore I won't
shoot you, when I have such a good chance to do so. But you have
regretted your interference more than once, and you are seeking
now to undo all the good you have done. We have it in our power
not only to go away, but to bring back a force which shall hang
every one of you three, as you deserve to be, but&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh! oh-o-o-o!"</p>

<p>"But we don't propose to do it. We are not going away to leave
you here. To-morrow we shall have a proposal to offer to your
mates, which they will be glad to accept. That is about all I
have to say to you."</p>
