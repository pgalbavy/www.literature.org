<p>"Will you make me a berry pie if I will get the berries to-morrow?"
asked Farmer Brown's boy of his mother.</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. Brown promised that she would, and so that night
Farmer Brown's boy went to bed very early that he might get up
early in the morning, and all night long he dreamed of berries
and berry pies. He was awake even before jolly, round, red Mr.
Sun thought it was time to get up, and he was all ready to start
for the Old Pasture when the first Jolly Little Sunbeams came
dancing across the Green Meadows. He carried a big tin pail, and
in the bottom of it, wrapped up in a piece of paper, was a lunch,
for he meant to stay until he filled that pail, if it took all
day.</p>

<p>Now the Old Pasture is very large. It lies at the foot of the
Big Mountain, and even extends a little way up on the Big Mountain.
There is room in it for many people to pick berries all day without
even seeing each other, unless they roam about a great deal. You
see, the bushes grow very thick there, and you cannot see very
far in any direction. Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had climbed a
little way up in the sky by the time Farmer Brown's boy reached
the Old Pasture, and was smiling down on all the Great World,
and all the Great World seemed to be smiling back. Farmer Brown's
boy started to whistle, and then he stopped.</p>

<p>"If I whistle," thought he, "everybody will know just where I
am, and will keep out of sight, and I never can get acquainted
with folks if they keep out of sight."</p>

<p>You see, Farmer Brown's boy was just beginning to understand
something that Peter Rabbit and the other little people of the
Green Meadows and the Green Forest learned almost as soon as they
learned to walk,&mdash;that if you don't want to be seen, you mustn't
be heard. So he didn't whistle as he felt like doing, and he tried
not to make a bit of noise as he followed an old cow-path towards
a place where he knew the berries grew thick and oh, so big, and
all the time he kept his eyes wide open, and he kept his ears
open too.</p>

<p>That is how he happened to hear a little cry, a very faint little
cry. </p>
