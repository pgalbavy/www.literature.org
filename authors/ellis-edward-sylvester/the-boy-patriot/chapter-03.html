<p>No loving friends came to inquire after the fate of Hal Hutchings,
the English boy. His efforts to save his basket of clean linen
had been as vain as his struggles to free himself from the hands
of his persecutors. The garments that had been starched and ironed
with such scrupulous care were scattered along the wharf, and
trampled under the feet of the thoughtless young mob. The old
washerwoman on whose errand Hal had been sent forth, was too indignant
at the destruction which had befallen her handiwork, to give one
kindly thought to the poor boy who had so honorably striven to
spare her the misfortune over which she lamented so dolorously.
Her Sunday thoughts strayed far more frequently to the dingy,
stained garments soaking in her back kitchen, than to Hal Hutchings,
quietly lying in Mrs. Robertson's best bedroom.</p>

<p>"I wonder no one comes to inquire after him. Has he no friends,
Blair?" said Mrs. Robertson as evening was drawing on.</p>

<p>"I dare say not, mother. I never saw him with anybody. He does
errands round town, and has been sleeping at Mrs. McKinstry's,
the washerwoman's. He didn't take his meals there, I know, for
I've seen him eating bread and cheese in some corner just when
other folks were sitting down to dinner. They call him 'Hal the
English boy;' but I guess nobody knows much about him."</p>

<p>"A stranger in a strange land," said Mrs. Robertson thoughtfully;
and then she rose up and went into the room where Hal was still
lying.</p>

<p>Blair took up his Bible. How precious that Bible seemed to him
now&mdash;the light for his feet, the lamp for his path. With reverence
he turned the sacred pages until he found the fifty-first psalm,
which he read with solemn earnestness, making its humble petitions
truly his own.</p>

<p>While Blair was thus employed, Mrs. Robertson was talking in
her own kindly way to the stranger.</p>

<p>"So you are an English boy, Hal," she said. "That will not keep
me from loving you, for you know the Bible says we must 'love
our enemies;' but I don't believe you are such a very dangerous
enemy, after all." Her pleasant smile was like sunshine to the
heart of the lonely boy, and his reserve melted away before it.</p>

<p>"I'm Hinglish, because I was born in Hingland," said the boy.
"I couldn't help that; and I couldn't blame my father and mother
for it neither, for I never knowed them. I've been an orphan always.
But I'm an American, because I chose this for my country, and
I worked my passage over here, and I haven't begged from anybody."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you want to be an American," said Mrs. Robertson gently;
"it is a great privilege. But there is something more to do for
every boy who wants to be an American citizen, than just landing
in this country and earning his own living, and then by and by
voting for our rulers."</p>

<p>Hal opened his large pale blue eyes in confused expectation,
and was silent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robertson was not easily discouraged, and she went on. "You
would think it very rude, Hal, if I were to invite a poor stranger
to my house to dinner, and he should jump and laugh while I was
asking God's blessing before eating; and then toss the plates
about, breaking my dishes and scattering the food over my clean
floor. You would think the least he could do would be to be civil,
and keep the rules of my house while he was in it."</p>

<p>"Such a chap as that ought to have the door showed him right
straight," said Hal warmly.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, this is what I mean: When we welcome strangers
to our free country, which our fathers fought for and gave their
blood to win, we expect those strangers to fall in with our ways,
and not disturb the peace and order of the pleasant home they
have come to. Is not that right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am; and I haven't disturbed anybody's peace nor order,"
said Hal with another blank look of the blue eyes.</p>

<p>"No, and I do not believe you ever will; but I have not done
yet. A free people, to be a safe people, must be a Christian people.
Are you a Christian boy, Hal?" The question was asked with deep
seriousness.</p>

<p>"I a'n't a heathen," said Hal in surprise.</p>

<p>"No, you don't bow down to a wooden idol, or worship snakes and
bulls, as some heathen people do. But are you trying to serve
God in all you think and do and say? Have you asked him to forgive
you all your sins, for the sake of his dear Son; and do you believe
he has forgiven you, and taken you to be his own dear child?"</p>

<p>"I never had anybody talk to me so before," said Hal with a confused
look; "but I take it, I a'n't what you call a Christian."</p>

<p>"I dare say you do not understand me very well," said Mrs. Robertson.
"God can make these things plain to you. Close your eyes, and
I will kneel down here and ask him to teach you to know and love
his holy will."</p>

<p>Hal had been at church many times in his life, and looked curiously
on at the whole proceeding, as at a "show." Now for the first
time he heard prayer made for him, for poor Hal Hutchings, to
the great God of heaven. He gathered but little of the burden
of the prayer; yet his first remark after Mrs. Robertson resumed
her seat beside him was a proof that he appreciated the sincerity
of her interest in him.</p>

<p>"You are very kind, ma'am," he said. "I'd like to be such an
American as you. I take it you are the best sort, not like them
boys on the wharf."</p>

<p>"Those boys are very sorry for their mischief by this time,"
said Mrs. Robertson. "My own son would gladly do any thing for
you. He says he never shall forget what he suffered when he thought
you might be drowned in consequence of his folly. But I think
he has learned a lesson he will never forget. He has seen how
far wrong he might go if he followed his own foolish ways. I trust
he will hereafter be a faithful, humble child of God."</p>

<p>"He pulled me out of the water," said Hal warmly. "He's true
grit. I'd go to the death for him."</p>

<p>"He will be very glad to have you for a faithful friend," said
Mrs. Robertson; "but look, you must not teach him any thing bad,
or tempt him to do wrong. He is my only child, and my dearest
wish is to see him a noble, pure, Christian man."</p>

<p>"I wont teach him any 'arm as I knows to be 'arm," said Hal,
putting out his hand to ratify the bargain.</p>

<p>It was a rough, hard hand, but Mrs. Robertson took it kindly
as she answered, "God help you to keep your promise, Hal;" and
so their interview closed.</p>

<p>When Monday morning came, Hal Hutchings was up and dressed almost
as early as Mrs. Robertson herself. Into the kitchen he walked,
hearing the good lady's voice in that direction. "I'm going now,"
he said, "and I just looked in to bid you good-by."</p>

<p>"Stop and take breakfast with us, wont you, Hal? You shall not
go away hungry."</p>

<p>Some crisp cakes of codfish and potatoes were getting the last
coat of brown in a frying-pan over the fire, and a huge loaf of
Boston "brown bread" was on the table near at hand.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind a slice of that bread and one of them cakes,
if you would let me sit down here and eat 'em," said Hal.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robertson understood the boy's unwillingness to take a meal
with strangers who had been raised in habits of greater refinement
than his own. She kindly made a place for him where he was, and
he soon rendered it evident that bashfulness had not taken away
his appetite. "I don't want you to leave us," said Mrs. Robertson.
"I should like to have you stay here until we can find something
for you to do. I want to teach you to be a good Christian boy,
the right kind of an American."</p>

<p>"I don't want to be beholden to anybody," said Hal with decision.
"I worked my way over, and I haven't begged a penny since I came.
I don't mean to, unless I'm starving. Mrs. McKinstry has let me
her little room. I've paid for it for this month, and I don't
mean to lose my money. But I like your teaching, ma'am. It takes
hold of me different from any thing I ever heard before."</p>

<p>"Come in on Sunday evenings then, Hal. I am always at home then,
and I should love dearly to teach you, and help you to be a good
boy. Will you come?" said Mrs. Robertson.</p>

<p>"I will, ma'am, I will," said Hal; and making a rude attempt
at a bow, he took his leave.</p>
