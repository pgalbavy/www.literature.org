This physical loathing for alcohol I have never got over.  But I
have conquered it.  To this day I conquer it every time I take a
drink.  The palate never ceases to rebel, and the palate can be
trusted to know what is good for the body.  But men do not drink
for the effect alcohol produces on the body.  What they drink for
is the brain-effect; and if it must come through the body, so much
the worse for the body.
<P>
And yet, despite my physical loathing for alcohol, the brightest
spots in my child life were the saloons.  Sitting on the heavy
potato wagons, wrapped in fog, feet stinging from inactivity, the
horses plodding slowly along the deep road through the sandhills,
one bright vision made the way never too long.  The bright vision
was the saloon at Colma, where my father, or whoever drove, always
got out to get a drink.  And I got out to warm by the great stove
and get a soda cracker.  Just one soda cracker, but a fabulous
luxury.  Saloons were good for something.  Back behind the
plodding horses, I would take an hour in consuming that one
cracker.  I took the smallest nibbles, never losing a crumb, and
chewed the nibble till it became the thinnest and most delectable
of pastes.  I never voluntarily swallowed this paste.  I just
tasted it, and went on tasting it, turning it over with my tongue,
spreading it on the inside of this cheek, then on the inside of
the other cheek, until, at the end, it eluded me and in tiny drops
and oozelets, slipped and dribbled down my throat.  Horace
Fletcher had nothing on me when it came to soda crackers.
<P>
I liked saloons.  Especially I liked the San Francisco saloons. 
They had the most delicious dainties for the taking--strange
breads and crackers, cheeses, sausages, sardines--wonderful foods
that I never saw on our meagre home-table.  And once, I remember,
a barkeeper mixed me a sweet temperance drink of syrup and soda-
water.  My father did not pay for it.  It was the barkeeper's
treat, and he became my ideal of a good, kind man.  I dreamed day-
dreams of him for years.  Although I was seven years old at the
time, I can see him now with undiminished clearness, though I
never laid eyes on him but that one time.  The saloon was south of
Market Street in San Francisco.  It stood on the west side of the
street.  As you entered, the bar was on the left.  On the right,
against the wall, was the free lunch counter.  It was a long,
narrow room, and at the rear, beyond the beer kegs on tap, were
small, round tables and chairs.  The barkeeper was blue-eyed, and
had fair, silky hair peeping out from under a black silk skull-
cap.  I remember he wore a brown Cardigan jacket, and I know
precisely the spot, in the midst of the array of bottles, from
which he took the bottle of red-coloured syrup.  He and my father
talked long, and I sipped my sweet drink and worshipped him.  And
for years afterward I worshipped the memory of him.
<P>
Despite my two disastrous experiences, here was John Barleycorn,
prevalent and accessible everywhere in the community, luring and
drawing me.  Here were connotations of the saloon making deep
indentations in a child's mind.  Here was a child, forming its
first judgments of the world, finding the saloon a delightful and
desirable place.  Stores, nor public buildings, nor all the
dwellings of men ever opened their doors to me and let me warm by
their fires or permitted me to eat the food of the gods from
narrow shelves against the wall.  Their doors were ever closed to
me; the saloon's doors were ever open.  And always and everywhere
I found saloons, on highway and byway, up narrow alleys and on
busy thoroughfares, bright-lighted and cheerful, warm in winter,
and in summer dark and cool.  Yes, the saloon was a mighty fine
place, and it was more than that.
<P>
By the time I was ten years old, my family had abandoned ranching
and gone to live in the city.  And here, at ten, I began on the
streets as a newsboy.  One of the reasons for this was that we
needed the money.  Another reason was that I needed the exercise. 
I had found my way to the free public library, and was reading
myself into nervous prostration.  On the poor ranches on which I
had lived there had been no books.  In ways truly miraculous, I
had been lent four books, marvellous books, and them I had
devoured.  One was the life of Garfield; the second, Paul du
Chaillu's African travels; the third, a novel by Ouida with the
last forty pages missing; and the fourth, Irving's "Alhambra."
This last had been lent me by a school-teacher.  I was not a
forward child.  Unlike Oliver Twist, I was incapable of asking for
more.  When I returned the "Alhambra" to the teacher I hoped she
would lend me another book.  And because she did not--most likely
she deemed me unappreciative--I cried all the way home on the
three-mile tramp from the school to the ranch. I waited and
yearned for her to lend me another book.  Scores of times I nerved
myself almost to the point of asking her, but never quite reached
the necessary pitch of effrontery.
<P>
And then came the city of Oakland, and on the shelves of that free
library I discovered all the great world beyond the skyline.  Here
were thousands of books as good as my four wonder-books, and some
were even better.  Libraries were not concerned with children in
those days, and I had strange adventures.  I remember, in the
catalogue, being impressed by the title, "The Adventures of
Peregrine Pickle." I filled an application blank and the librarian
handed me the collected and entirely unexpurgated works of
Smollett in one huge volume.  I read everything, but principally
history and adventure, and all the old travels and voyages.  I
read mornings, afternoons, and nights.  I read in bed, I read at
table, I read as I walked to and from school, and I read at recess
while the other boys were playing.  I began to get the "jerks." To
everybody I replied: "Go away.  You make me nervous."
<P>
And so, at ten, I was out on the streets, a newsboy.  I had no
time to read.  I was busy getting exercise and learning how to
fight, busy learning forwardness, and brass and bluff.  I had an
imagination and a curiosity about all things that made me plastic. 
Not least among the things I was curious about was the saloon. 
And I was in and out of many a one.  I remember, in those days, on
the east side of Broadway, between Sixth and Seventh, from corner
to corner, there was a solid block of saloons.
<P>
In the saloons life was different.  Men talked with great voices,
laughed great laughs, and there was an atmosphere of greatness. 
Here was something more than common every-day where nothing
happened.  Here life was always very live, and, sometimes, even
lurid, when blows were struck, and blood was shed, and big
policemen came shouldering in.  Great moments, these, for me, my
head filled with all the wild and valiant fighting of the gallant
adventurers on sea and land.  There were no big moments when I
trudged along the street throwing my papers in at doors.  But in
the saloons, even the sots, stupefied, sprawling across the tables
or in the sawdust, were objects of mystery and wonder.
<P>
And more, the saloons were right.  The city fathers sanctioned
them and licensed them.  They were not the terrible places I heard
boys deem them who lacked my opportunities to know.  Terrible they
might be, but then that only meant they were terribly wonderful,
and it is the terribly wonderful that a boy desires to know.  In
the same way pirates, and shipwrecks, and battles were terrible;
and what healthy boy wouldn't give his immortal soul to
participate in such affairs?
<P>
Besides, in saloons I saw reporters, editors, lawyers, judges,
whose names and faces I knew.  They put the seal of social
approval on the saloon.  They verified my own feeling of
fascination in the saloon.  They, too, must have found there that
something different, that something beyond, which I sensed and
groped after.  What it was, I did not know; yet there it must be,
for there men focused like buzzing flies about a honey pot.  I had
no sorrows, and the world was very bright, so I could not guess
that what these men sought was forgetfulness of jaded toil and
stale grief.
<P>
Not that I drank at that time.  From ten to fifteen I rarely
tasted liquor, but I was intimately in contact with drinkers and
drinking places.  The only reason I did not drink was because I
didn't like the stuff.  As the time passed, I worked as boy-helper
on an ice-wagon, set up pins in a bowling alley with a saloon
attached, and swept out saloons at Sunday picnic grounds.
<P>
Big jovial Josie Harper ran a road house at Telegraph Avenue and
Thirty-ninth Street.  Here for a year I delivered an evening
paper, until my route was changed to the water-front and
tenderloin of Oakland.  The first month, when I collected Josie
Harper's bill, she poured me a glass of wine.  I was ashamed to
refuse, so I drank it.  But after that I watched the chance when
she wasn't around so as to collect from her barkeeper.
<P>
The first day I worked in the bowling alley, the barkeeper,
according to custom, called us boys up to have a drink after we
had been setting up pins for several hours.  The others asked for
beer.  I said I'd take ginger ale.  The boys snickered, and I
noticed the barkeeper favoured me with a strange, searching
scrutiny.  Nevertheless, he opened a bottle of ginger ale. 
Afterward, back in the alleys, in the pauses between games, the
boys enlightened me.  I had offended the barkeeper.  A bottle of
ginger ale cost the saloon ever so much more than a glass of steam
beer; and it was up to me, if I wanted to hold my job, to drink
beer.  Besides, beer was food.  I could work better on it.  There
was no food in ginger ale.  After that, when I couldn't sneak out
of it, I drank beer and wondered what men found in it that was so
good.  I was always aware that I was missing something.
<P>
What I really liked in those days was candy. For five cents I
could buy five "cannon-balls"--big lumps of the most delicious
lastingness.  I could chew and worry a single one for an hour. 
Then there was a Mexican who sold big slabs of brown chewing taffy
for five cents each.  It required a quarter of a day properly to
absorb one of them.  And many a day I made my entire lunch off one
of those slabs.  In truth, I found food there, but not in beer.
