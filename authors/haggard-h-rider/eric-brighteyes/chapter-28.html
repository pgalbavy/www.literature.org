<p>Now Eric’s strength came back to him and his heart opened in the light
of Gudruda’s eyes like a flower in the sunshine. For all day long she
sat at his side, holding his hand and talking to him, and they found
much to say.
</p>
<p>But on the fifth day from the day of his awakening she spoke thus:
</p><p>“Eric, now I must go back to Middalhof. Thou art safe and it is not well
that I should stay here.”
</p><p>“Not yet, Gudruda,” he said; “leave me not yet.”
</p><p>“Yes, love, I must leave thee. The moon is bright, the sky has cleared,
and the snow is hard with frost and fit for the hoofs of horses. I must
go before more storms come. Listen now: in the second week of spring,
if all is well, I will send thee a messenger with words of token, then
shalt thou come down secretly to Middalhof, and there, Eric, we will be
wed. Then, on the next day, we will sail for England in a trading-ship
that I shall get ready, to seek our fortune there.”
</p><p>“It will be a good fortune if thou art by my side,” said Eric, “so
good that I doubt greatly if I may find it, for I am Eric the Unlucky.
Swanhild must yet be reckoned with, Gudruda. Yes, thou art right: thou
must go hence, Gudruda, and swiftly, though it grieves me much to part
with thee.”
</p><p>Then Eric called Skallagrim and bade him make things ready to ride down
to Middalhof with the Lady Gudruda.
</p><p>This Skallagrim did swiftly, and afterwards Eric and Gudruda kissed and
parted, and they were sad at heart to part.
</p><p>Now on the fifth day after the going of Gudruda, Skallagrim came back
to Mosfell somewhat cold and weary. And he told Eric, who could now walk
and grew strong again, that he and Jon had ridden with Gudruda the Fair
to Horse-Head Heights, seeing no man, and had left her there to go on
with her thralls. He had come back also seeing no one, for the weather
was too cold for the men of Gizur to watch the fell in the snows.
</p>
<p>Now Gudruda came safely to Middalhof, having been eleven days gone, and
found that few had visited the house, and that these had been told that
she lay sick abed. Her secret had been well kept, and, though Swanhild
had no lack of spies, many days went by before she learned that Gudruda
had gone up to Mosfell to nurse Eric.
</p><p>After this Gudruda began to make ready for her flight from Iceland. She
called in the moneys that she had out at interest, and with them bought
from a certain chapman a good trading-ship which lay in its shed under
the shelter of Westman Isles. This ship she began to make ready for sea
so soon as the heart of the winter was broken, putting it about that she
intended to send her on a trading voyage to Scotland in the spring. And
also to give colour to this tale she bought many pelts and other goods,
such as chapmen deal in.
</p><p>Thus the days passed on--not so badly for Gudruda, who strove to fill
their emptiness in making ready for the full and happy time; but for
Eric in his cave they were very heavy, for he could find nothing to do
except to sleep and eat, and think of Gudruda, whom he might not see.
</p><p>For Swanhild also, sitting at Coldback, the days did not go well. She
was weary of the courting of Gizur, whom she played with as a cat plays
with a rat, and her heart was sick with love, hate, and jealousy. For
she well knew that Gudruda and Eric still clung to each other and found
means of greeting, if not of speech. At that time she wished to kill
Eric if she could, though she would rather kill Gudruda if she dared.
Still, she could not come at Eric, for her men feared to try the narrow
way of Mosfell, and when they met him in the open they fled before him.
</p><p>Presently it came to her ears that Gudruda made a ship ready to sail to
Scotland on a trading voyage, and she was perplexed by this tale, for
she knew that Gudruda had no love of trading and never thought of gain.
So she set spies to watch the ship. Still, the slow days drew on, and
at length the air grew soft with spring, and flowers showed through the
snow.
</p><p>Eric sat in his mountain nest waiting for tidings, and watched the
nesting eagles wheel about the cliffs. At length news came. For one
morning, as he rose, Skallagrim told him that a man wanted to speak with
him. He had come to the mountain in the darkness, and had lain in a dell
till the breaking of the light, for, now that the snows were melting,
the men of Gizur and Swanhild watched the ways.
</p><p>Eric bade them bring the man to him. When he saw him he knew that he was
a thrall of Gudruda’s and welcomed him heartily.
</p><p>“What tidings?” he asked.
</p><p>“This, lord,” said the thrall: “Gudruda the Fair bids me say that she is
well and that the snows melt on the roof of Middalhof.”
</p><p>Now this was the signal word that had been agreed upon between Eric and
Gudruda, that she should send him when all was ready.
</p><p>“Good,” said Eric, “ride back to Gudruda the Fair and say that Eric
Brighteyes is well, but on Hecla the snows melt not.”
</p><p>By this answer he meant that he would be with her presently, though the
thrall could make nothing of it. Then Skallagrim asked tidings of the
man, and learned that Swanhild was still at Middalhof, and with her
Gizur, and that they gave out that they wished to make an end of waiting
and slay Eric.
</p><p>“First snare your bird, then wring his neck,” laughed Skallagrim.
</p><p>Then Eric did this: among his men were some who he knew were not willing
to sail from Iceland, and Jon, his thrall, was of them, for Jon did not
love the angry sea. He bade these bide a while on Mosfell and make fires
nightly on the platform of rock which is in front of the cave, that the
spies of Gizur and Swanhild might be deceived by them, and think that
Eric was still on the fell. Then, when they heard that he had sailed,
they were to come down and hide themselves with friends till Gizur and
his following rode north. But he told two of the men who would sail with
him to make ready.
</p><p>That night before the moon rose Eric said farewell to Jon and the others
who stayed on Mosfell, and rode away with Skallagrim and the two who
went with him. They passed the plain of black sand in safety, and so
on to Horse-Head Heights. Now at length, as the afternoon drew on to
evening, from Stonefell’s crest they saw the Hall of Middalhof before
them, and Eric’s heart swelled in his breast. Yet they must wait till
darkness fell before they dared enter the place, lest they should be
seen and notice of their coming should be carried to Gizur and Swanhild.
And this came into the mind of Eric, that of all the hours of his life
that hour of waiting was the longest. Scarcely, indeed, could Skallagrim
hold him back from going down the mountain side, he was so set on coming
to Gudruda whom he should wed that night.
</p><p>At length the darkness fell, and they went on. Eric rode swiftly down
the rough mountain path, while Skallagrim and the two men followed
grumbling, for they feared that their horses would fall. At length they
came to the place, and riding into the yard, Eric sprang from his
horse and strode to the women’s door. Now Gudruda stood in the porch,
listening; and while he was yet some way off, she heard the clang of
Brighteyen’s harness, and the colour came and went upon her cheek. Then
she turned and fled to the high seat of the hall, and sat down there.
Only two women were left in Middalhof with her, and some thralls who
tended the kine and horses. But these slept, not in the hall, but in an
outhouse. Gudruda had sent the rest of her people down to the ship to
help in the lading, for it was given out that the vessel sailed on the
morrow. She had done this that there might be no talk of the coming of
Eric to Middalhof.
</p><p>Now Brighteyes came to the porch, and, finding the door wide, walked
in. But Skallagrim and the men stayed without a while, and tended the
horses. A fire burned upon the centre hearth in the hall, and threw
shadows on the panelling. Eric walked on by its light, looking to left
and right, but seeing neither man nor woman. Then a great fear took
him lest Gudruda should be gone, or perhaps slain of Swanhild, Groa’s
daughter, and he trembled at the thought. He stood by the fire, and
Gudruda, watching from the shadow of the high seat, saw the dull light
glow upon his golden helm, and a sigh of joy broke from her lips. Eric
heard the sigh and looked, and as he looked a stick of pitchy driftwood
fell into the fire and flared up fiercely. Then he saw. There, in the
carved high seat, robed all in bridal white, sat Gudruda the Fair,
his love. Her golden hair flowed about her breast, her white arms were
stretched towards him, and on her sweet face shone such a look of love
as he had never seen.
</p><p>“_Eric!_” she whispered softly, and the breath of her voice ran down the
empty panelled hall, that from all sides seemed to answer, “<u>Eric.</u>”
</p><p>Slowly he drew near to her. He saw nothing but the glory of Gudruda’s
face and the light shining on Gudruda’s hair; he heard nothing save the
sighing of her breath; he knew nothing except that before him sat his
fair bride, won after many years.
</p><p>Now he had climbed the high seat, and now, wrapped in each other’s arms,
they sat and gazed into each other’s eyes, and lo! the air of the great
hall rolled round them a sea of glory, and sweet voices whispered in
their ears. Now Freya smiled upon them and led them through her gates of
love, and they were glad that they had been born.
</p><p>Thus then they were wed.
</p>
<p>Now the story tells that Swanhild spoke with Gizur, Ospakar’s son, in
the house at Coldback.
</p><p>“I tire of this slow play,” she said. “We have tarried here for many
weeks, and Atli’s blood yet cries out for vengeance, and cries for
vengeance the blood of black Ospakar, thy father, and the blood of many
another, dead at great Eric’s hand.”
</p><p>“I tire also,” said Gizur, “and I am much needed in the north. I say
this to thee, Swanhild, that, hadst thou not so strictly laid it on me
that Eric must die ere thou weddest me, I had flitted back to Swinefell
before now, and there bided my time to bring Brighteyes to his end.”
</p><p>“I will never wed thee, Gizur, till Eric is dead,” said Swanhild
fiercely.
</p><p>“How shall we come at him then?” he answered. “We may not go up that
mountain path, for two men can hold it against all our strength, and
folk do not love to meet Eric and Skallagrim in a narrow way.”
</p><p>“The place has been badly watched,” said Swanhild. “I am sure of this,
that Eric has been down to Middalhof and seen Gudruda, my half-sister.
She is shameless, who still holds commune with him who slew her brother
and my husband. Death should be her reward, and I am minded to slay her
because of the shame that she has brought upon our blood.”
</p><p>“That is a deed which thou wilt do alone, then,” said Gizur, “for I will
have no hand in the murder of that fair maid--no, nor will any who live
in Iceland!”
</p><p>Swanhild glanced at him strangely. “Hearken, Gizur!” she said: “Gudruda
makes a ship ready to sail with goods to Scotland and bring a cargo
thence before winter comes again. Now I find this strange, for never
before did I know Gudruda turn her thoughts to trading. I think that she
has it in her mind to sail from Iceland with this outlaw Eric, and seek
a home over seas, and that I will not bear.”
</p><p>“It may be,” said Gizur, “and I should not be sorry to see the last of
Brighteyes, for I think that more men will die at his hand before he
stiffens in his barrow.”
</p><p>“Thou art cowardly-hearted, thou son of Ospakar!” Swanhild said. “Thou
sayest thou lovest me and wouldest win me to wife: I tell thee that
there is but one road to my arms, and it leads over the corpse of Eric.
Now this is my counsel: that we send the most of our men to watch that
ship of Gudruda’s, and, when she lifts anchor, to board her and search,
for she is already bound for sea. Also among the people here I have a
carle who was born near Hecla, and he swears this to me, that, when
he was a lad, searching for an eagle’s eyrie, he found a path by which
Mosfell might be climbed from the north, and that in the end he came
to a large flat place, and, looking over, saw that platform where Eric
dwells with his thralls. But he could not see the cave, because of the
overhanging brow of the rock. Now we will do this: thou and I, and the
carle alone--no more, for I do not wish that our search should be
noised abroad--to-morrow at the dawn we will ride away for Mosfell, and,
passing under Hecla, come round the mountain and see if this path may
still be scaled. For, if so, we will return with men and make an end of
Brighteyes.”
</p><p>This plan pleased Gizur, and he said that it should be so.
</p><p>So very early on the following morning Swanhild, having sent many men to
watch Gudruda’s ship, rode away secretly with Gizur and the thrall, and
before it was again dawn they were on the northern slopes of Mosfell.
It was on this same night that Eric went down from the mountain to wed
Gudruda.
</p><p>For a while the climbing was easy, but at length they came to a great
wall of rock, a hundred fathoms high, on which no fox might find a
foothold, nor anything that had not wings.
</p><p>“Here now is an end of our journey,” said Gizur, “and I only pray this,
that Eric may not ride round the mountain before we are down again.” For
he did not know that Brighteyes already rode hard for Middalhof.
</p><p>“Not so,” said the thrall, “if only I can find the place by which, some
thirty summers ago, I won yonder rift, and through it the crest of the
fell,” and he pointed to a narrow cleft in the face of the rock high
above their heads, that was clothed with grey moss.
</p><p>Then he moved to the right and searched, peering behind stones and
birch-bushes, till presently he held up his hand and whistled. They
passed along the slope and found him standing by a little stream of
water which welled from beneath a great rock.
</p><p>“Here is the place,” the man said.
</p><p>“I see no place,” answered Swanhild.
</p><p>“Still, it is there, lady,” and he climbed on to the rock, drawing her
after him. At the back of it was a hole, almost overgrown with moss.
“Here is the path,” he said again.
</p><p>“Then it is one that I have no mind to follow,” answered Swanhild.
“Gizur, go thou with the man and see if his tale is true. I will stay
here till ye come back.”
</p><p>Then the thrall let himself down into the hole and Gizur went after him.
But Swanhild sat there in the shadow of the rock, her chin resting on
her hand, and waited. Presently, as she sat, she saw two men ride round
the base of the fell, and strike off to the right towards a turf-booth
which stood the half of an hour’s ride away. Now Swanhild was the
keenest-sighted of all women of her day in Iceland, and when she looked
at these two men she knew one of them for Jon, Eric’s thrall, and she
knew the horse also--it was a white horse with black patches, that Jon
had ridden for many years. She watched them go till they came to the
booth, and it seemed to her that they left their horses and entered.
</p><p>Swanhild waited upon the side of the fell for nearly two hours in all.
Then, hearing a noise above her, she looked up, and there, black with
dirt and wet with water, was Gizur, and with him was the thrall.
</p><p>“What luck, Gizur?” she asked.
</p><p>“This, Swanhild: Eric may hold Mosfell no more, for we have found a way
to bolt the fox.”
</p><p>“That is good news, then,” said Swanhild. “Say on.”
</p><p>“Yonder hole, Swanhild, leads to the cleft above, having been cut
through the cliff by fire, or perhaps by water. Now up that cleft a man
may climb, though hardly, as by a difficult stair, till he comes to the
flat crest of the fell. Then, crossing the crest, on the further side,
perhaps six fathoms below him, he sees that space of rock where is
Eric’s cave; but he cannot see the cave itself, because the brow of the
cliff hangs over. And so it is that, if any come from the cave on to the
space of rock, it will be an easy matter to roll stones upon them from
above and crush them.”
</p><p>Now when Swanhild heard this she laughed aloud.
</p><p>“Eric shall mock us no more,” she said, “and his might can avail nothing
against rocks rolled on him from above. Let us go back to Coldback and
summon men to make an end of Brighteyes.”
</p><p>So they went on down the mountain till they came to the place where they
had hidden their horses. Then Swanhild remembered Jon and the other man
whom she had seen riding to the booth, and she told Gizur of them.
</p><p>“Now,” she said, “we will snare these birds, and perchance they will
twitter tidings when we squeeze them.”
</p><p>So they turned and rode for the booth, and drawing near, they saw two
horses grazing without. Now they got off their horses, and creeping up
to the booth, looked in through the door which was ajar. And they saw
this, that one man sat on the ground with his back to the door, eating
stock-fish, while Jon made bundles of fish and meal ready to tie on the
horses. For it was here that those of his quarter who loved Eric brought
food to be carried by his men to the cave on Mosfell.
</p><p>Now Swanhild touched Gizur on the arm, pointing first to the man who sat
eating the fish and then to the spear in Gizur’s hand. Gizur thought a
while, for he shrank from this deed.
</p><p>Then Swanhild whispered in his ear, “Slay the man and seize the other; I
would learn tidings from him.”
</p><p>So Gizur cast the spear, and it passed through the man’s heart, and he
was dead at once. Then he and the thrall leapt into the booth and threw
themselves on Jon, hurling him to the ground, and holding swords over
him. Now Jon was a man of small heart, and when he saw his plight and
his fellow dead he was afraid, and prayed for mercy.
</p><p>“If I spare thee, knave,” said Swanhild, “thou shalt do this: thou shalt
lead me up Mosfell to speak with Eric.”
</p><p>“I may not do that, lady,” groaned Jon; “for Eric is not on Mosfell.”
</p><p>“Where is he, then?” asked Swanhild.
</p><p>Now Jon saw that he had said an unlucky thing, and answered:
</p><p>“Nay, I know not. Last night he rode from Mosfell with Skallagrim
Lambstail.”
</p><p>“Thou liest, knave,” said Swanhild. “Speak, or thou shalt be slain.”
</p><p>“Slay on,” groaned Jon, glancing at the swords above him, and shutting
his eyes. For, though he feared much to die, he had no will to make
known Eric’s plans.
</p><p>“Look not at the swords; thou shalt not die so easily. Hearken: speak,
and speak truly, or thou shalt seek Hela’s lap after this fashion,” and,
bending down, she whispered in his ear, then laughed aloud.
</p><p>Now Jon grew faint with fear; his lips turned blue, and his teeth
chattered at the thought of how he should be made to die. Still, he
would say nothing.
</p><p>Then Swanhild spoke to Gizur and the thrall, and bade them bind him with
a rope, tear the garments from him, and bring snow. They did this, and
pushed the matter to the drawing of knives. But when he saw the steel
Jon cried aloud that he would tell all.
</p><p>“Now thou takest good counsel,” said Swanhild.
</p><p>Then in his fear Jon told how Eric had gone down to Middalhof to wed
Gudruda, and thence to fly with her to England.
</p><p>Now Swanhild was mad with wrath, for she had sooner died than that this
should come about.
</p><p>“Let us away,” she said to Gizur. “But first kill this man.”
</p><p>“Nay,” said Gizur, “I will not do that. He has told his tidings; let him
go free.”
</p><p>“Thou art chicken-hearted,” said Swanhild, who, after the fashion of
witches, had no mercy in her. “At the least, he shall not go hence to
warn Eric and Gudruda of our coming. If thou wilt not kill him, then
bind him and leave him.”
</p><p>So Jon was bound, and there in the booth he sat two days before anyone
came to loose him.
</p><p>“Whither away?” said Gizur to Swanhild.
</p><p>“To Middalhof first,” Swanhild answered.
