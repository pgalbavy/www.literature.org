<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>During her week's absence from town Jacqueline's mail had accumulated;
a number of business matters had come into the office, the disposal
of which now awaited her decision&mdash;requests from wealthy connoisseurs
for expert opinion, offers to dispose of collections entire or
in part, invitations to dealers' secret conferences, urgent demands
for appraisers, questions concerning origin or authenticity, commissions
to buy, sell, advertise, or send searchers throughout the markets
at home or abroad for anything from a tiny shrine of Limoges enamel
to a complete suit of equestrian armour to fill a gap in a series
belonging to some rich man's museum.</p>

<p>On the evening of her arrival at the office, she was beset by
her clerks and salesmen, bringing to her hundreds of petty routine
details requiring her personal examination. Also, it appeared
that one of her clients had been outrageously swindled by a precious
pair of fly-by-nights; and the matter required immediate investigation.
So she was obliged to telephone to Mrs. Hammerton that she could
not dine with her at the Ritz, and to Desboro that she could not
see him for a day or two. In Desboro's case, a postscript added:
"Except for a minute, dearest, whenever you come."</p>

<p>She did not even take the time to dine that evening, but settled
down at her office desk as soon as the retail shop below was closed;
and, with the tea urn and a rack of toast at her elbow, plunged
straight into the delightfully interesting chaos confronting her.</p>

<p>As far as the shop was concerned, the New Year, as usual, had
brought to that part of the business a lull in activity. It always
happened so after New Years; and the stagnation steadily increased
as spring approached, until by summer time the retail business
was practically dead.</p>

<p>But a quiet market did not mean that there was nothing for her
to do. Warehouse sales must be watched, auctions, public and private,
in town and country, must be attended by one or more of her representatives;
private clients inclined to sell always required tactful handling
and careful consideration; her confidential agents must always
be alert.</p>

<p>Also, always her people were continually searching for various
objects ardently desired by all species of acquisitive clients;
she must keep in constant touch with everything that was happening
in her business abroad; she must keep abreast of her times at
home, which required much cleverness, intuition, and current reading,
and much study in the Museum and among private collections to
which she had access. She was a very, very busy girl, almost too
busy at moments to remember that she had fallen in love.</p>

<p>That night she worked alone in her office until long after midnight;
and all the next day until noon she was busy listening to or instructing
salesmen, clerks, dealers, experts, auctioneers, and clients.
Also, the swindle and the swindlers were worrying her extremely.</p>

<p>Luncheon had been served on a tray beside her desk, and she was
still absent-mindedly going over the carbon files of business
letters, which she had dictated and dispatched that morning, when
Desboro's card was brought to her. She sent word that she would
receive him.</p>

<p>"Will you lunch with me, Jim?" she asked demurely, when he had
appeared and shaken hands vigorously. "I've a fruit salad and
some perfectly delicious sherbet! Please sit on the desk top and
help me consume the banquet."</p>

<p>"Do you call that a banquet, darling?" he demanded. "Come out
to the Ritz with me this instant&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Dearest! I can't! Oh, you don't know what an exciting and interesting
mess my business affairs are in! A girl always has to pay for
her pleasure. But in this case it's a pleasure to pay. Bring up
that chair and share my luncheon like a good fellow, so we can
chat together for a few minutes. It's all the time I can give
you to-day, dearest."</p>

<p>He pulled up a chair and seated himself, experiencing somewhat
mixed emotions in the presence of such bewildering business capability.</p>

<p>"You make me feel embarrassed and ashamed," he said. "Rotten
loafer that I am! And you so energetic and industrious&mdash;you darling
thing!"</p>

<p>"But, dear, your farmer can't plow frozen ground, you know; all
your men can do just now is to mend fences and dump fertiliser
and lime and gypsum over everything. And I believe they were doing
that when I left."</p>

<p>"If," he said, "I were a real instead of a phony farmer, I'd
read catalogues about wire fences; I'd find plenty to do if I
were not a wretched sham. It's only, I hope, because you're in
town that I can't drive myself back where I belong. I ought to
be sitting in a wood-shed, in overalls, whittling sticks and yelling
bucolic wisdom at Ezra Vail&#11834; Oh, you needn't laugh, darling,
but that's where I ought to be, and what I ought to be doing if
I'm ever going to support a wife!"</p>

<p>"Jim! You're <em>not</em> going to support a wife! You absurd
boy!"</p>

<p>"What!" he demanded, losing countenance.</p>

<p>"Did you think you were obliged to support me? How ridiculous!
I'd be perfectly miserable&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Jacqueline! What on earth do you mean? We are going to live
on my income."</p>

<p>"Indeed we are not! What use would I be to you if I brought you
nothing except an idle, useless, lazy girl to support! It's unthinkable!"</p>

<p>"Do you expect to <em>remain</em> in business?" he asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Certainly I expect it!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;darling&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Jim! I <em>love</em> my business. It was father's business;
it represents my childhood, my girlhood, my maturity. Every detail
of it is inextricably linked with memories of him&mdash;the dearest
memories, the tenderest associations of my life! Do you wish me
to give them up?"</p>

<p>"How can you be my wife, Jacqueline, and still remain a business
woman?"</p>

<p>"Dear, I am certainly going to marry you. Permit me to arrange
the rest. It will not interfere with my being your devoted and
happy wife. It wouldn't ever interfere with&mdash;with my being a&mdash;a
perfectly good mother&mdash;if that's what you fear. If it did, do
you suppose I'd hesitate to choose?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, adoring her.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I wouldn't! But remaining in business will give me what
every girl should have as a right&mdash;an object in life apart from
her love for her husband&mdash;and children&mdash;apart from her proper
domestic duties. It is her right to engage in the business of
life; it makes the contract between you and me fairer. I love
you more than anything in the world, but I simply couldn't keep
my self-respect and depend on you for everything I have."</p>

<p>"But, my darling, everything I have is already yours."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. We can pretend it is. I know I <em>could</em> have
it&mdash;just as you could have this rather complicated business of
mine&mdash;if you want it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" he exclaimed. "Imagine the fury of a connoisseur
who engaged me to identify his priceless penates!"</p>

<p>He was laughing, too, now. They had finished their fruit salad
and sherbet; she lighted a cigarette for him, taking a dainty
puff and handing it to him with an adorable shudder.</p>

<p>"I <em>don't</em> like it! I don't like any vices! How women
can enjoy what men enjoy is a mystery to me. Smoke slowly, darling,
because when that cigarette is finished you must make a very graceful
bow and say good-bye to me until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"This is simply devilish, Jacqueline! I never see you any more."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You have plenty to do to amuse you&mdash;haven't you, dear?"</p>

<p>But the things that once occupied his leisure so casually and
so agreeably no longer attracted him.</p>

<p>"I don't want to read seed catalogues," he protested. "Couldn't
I be of use to you, Jacqueline? I'll do anything you say&mdash;take
off my coat and sweep out your office, or go behind the counter
in the shop and sell gilded gods&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Imagine the elegant Mr. Desboro selling antiquities to the dangerous
monomaniacs who haunt such shops as mine! Dear, they'd either
drive you crazy or have you arrested for fraud inside of ten minutes.
No; you will make a perfectly good husband, Jim, but you were
never created to decorate an antique shop."</p>

<p>He tried to smile, but only flushed rather painfully. A sudden
and wholly inexplicable sense of inferiority possessed him.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "I'm not going to stand around idle while
you run a prosperous business concern. And anyway, I can't see
it, Jacqueline. You and I are going to have a lot of social obligations
to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"We are likely to have all kinds of obligations," she interrupted
serenely, "and our lives are certain to be very full, and you
and I are going to be equal to every opportunity, every demand,
every responsibility&mdash;and still have leisure to love each other,
and to be to each other everything that either could desire."</p>

<p>"After all," he said, serious and unconvinced, "there are only
twenty-four hours in a day for us to be together."</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, but there will be no wasted time in those twenty-four
hours. That is where we save a sufficient number of minutes to
attend to the business of life."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you intend to come into this office every day?"</p>

<p>"For a while, yes. Less frequently when I have trained my people
a little longer. What do you suppose my father was doing all his
life? What do you suppose I have been doing these last three years?
Why, Jim, except that hitherto I have loved to fuss over details,
this office and this business could almost run itself for six
months at a time. Some day, except for special clients here and
there, Lionel Sissly will do what expert work I now am doing;
and this desk will be his; and his present position will be filled
by Mr. Mirk. That is how it is planned. And if you had given me
two or three months, I might have been able to go on a bridal
trip with you!"</p>

<p>"We <em>are</em> going, aren't we?" he asked, appalled.</p>

<p>"If I've got to marry you offhand," she said seriously, "our
wedding trip will have to wait. Don't you know, dear, that it
always costs heavily to do anything in a hurry? At this time of
year, and under the present conditions of business, and considering
my contracts and obligations, it would be utterly impossible for
me to go away again until summer."</p>

<p>He sprang up irritated, yet feeling utterly helpless under her
friendly but level gaze. Already he began to realise the true
significance of her position and his own in the world; how utterly
at a moral disadvantage he stood before this young girl&mdash;moral,
intellectual, spiritual&mdash;he was beginning to comprehend it all
now.</p>

<p>A dull flush of anger made his face hot and altered his expression
to sullenness. Where was all this leading them, anyway&mdash;this reversal
of rôles, this self-dependent attitude of hers&mdash;this calm self-reliance&mdash;this
freedom of decision?</p>

<p>Once he had supposed there was something in her to protect, to
guide, advise, make allowance for&mdash;perhaps to persuade, possibly,
even, to instruct. Such has been the immemorial attitude of man;
it had been instinctively, and more or less unconsciously, his.</p>

<p>And now, in spite of her youth, her soft pliability, her almost
childish grace and beauty, he was experiencing a half-dazed sensation
as though, in full and confident career, he had come, slap! into
collision with an occult barrier. And the impact was confusing
him and even beginning to hurt him.</p>

<p>He looked around him uneasily. Everything in the office, somehow,
seemed to be in subtle league with her to irritate him&mdash;her desk,
her loaded letter-files, her stacks of ledgers&mdash;all these accused
and offended him. But most of all his own helpless inferiority
made him angry and ashamed&mdash;the inferiority of idleness confronted
by industry; of aimlessness face to face with purpose; of irresolution
and degeneracy scrutinised by fearlessness, confidence, and happy
and innocent aspiration. And the combination silenced him.</p>

<p>And every mute second that he stood there, he felt as though
something imperceptible, intangible, was slipping away from him&mdash;perhaps
his man's immemorial right to lead, to decide, to direct the common
destiny of this slim, sweet-lipped young girl and himself.</p>

<p>For it was she who was serenely deciding&mdash;who had already laid
out the business of life for herself without hesitation, without
resort to him, to his man's wisdom, experience, prejudices, wishes,
desires. Moreover, she was leaving him absolutely free to decide
his own business in life for himself; and that made her position
unassailable. For if she had presumed to advise him, to suggest,
even hint at anything interfering with his own personal liberty
to decide for himself, he might have found some foothold, some
niche, something to sustain him, to justify him, in assuming man's
immemorial right to leadership.</p>

<p>"Dear," she said wistfully, "you look at me with such very troubled
eyes. Is there anything I have said that you disapprove?"</p>

<p>"I had not expected you to remain in business," was all he found
to say.</p>

<p>"If my remaining in business ever interferes with your happiness
or with my duty to you, I will give it up. You know that, don't
you?"</p>

<p>He reddened again.</p>

<p>"It looks queer," he muttered, "&mdash;your being in business and
<em>I&mdash;</em>playing farmer&mdash;like one of those loafing husbands
of celebrated actresses."</p>

<p>"Jim!" she exclaimed, scarlet to the ears. "What a horrid simile!"</p>

<p>"It's myself I'm cursing out," he said, almost angrily. "I can't
cut such a figure. Don't you understand, Jacqueline? I haven't
anything to occupy me! Do you expect me to hang around somewhere
while you work? I tell you, I've got to find something to do as
soon as we're married&mdash;or I couldn't look you in the face."</p>

<p>"That is for you to decide. Isn't it?" she asked sweetly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but on what am I to decide?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you decide, don't do it in a hurry, dear," she said,
smiling.</p>

<p>The sullen sense of resentment returned, reddening his face again:</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have to hurry if you'd give up this business and
live on our income and be free to travel and knock about with
me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Can't you understand that I <em>will</em> be free to be with
you&mdash;free in mind, in conscience, in body, to travel with you,
be with you, be to you whatever you desire&mdash;but only if I keep
my self-respect! And I can't keep that if I neglect the business
of life, which, in my case, lies partly here in this office."</p>

<p>She rose and laid one slim, pretty hand on his shoulder. She
rarely permitted herself to touch him voluntarily.</p>

<p>"Don't you wish me to be happy?" she asked gently.</p>

<p>"It's all I wish in the world, Jacqueline."</p>

<p>"But I couldn't be happy and remain idle; remain dependent on
you for anything&mdash;except love. Life to the full&mdash;every moment
filled&mdash;that is what living means to me. And only one single thing
never can fill one's life&mdash;not intellectual research alone; not
spiritual remoteness; nor yet the pursuit of pleasure; nor the
swift and endless hunt for happiness; nor even love, dearest among
men! Only the business of life can quite fill life to the brimming
for me; and that business is made up of everything worthy&mdash;of
the pleasures of effort, duty, aspiration, and noble repose, but
never of the pleasures of idleness. Jim, have I bored you with
a sermon? Forgive me; I am preaching only to instruct myself."</p>

<p>He took her hand from his shoulder and stood holding it and looking
at her with a strange expression. So dazed, yet so terribly intent
he seemed at moments that she laid her other hand over his, pressing
it in smiling anxiety.</p>

<p>"What is it, dearest?" she murmured. "Don't you approve of me
as much as you thought you did? Am I disappointing you already?"</p>

<p>"Good God!" he muttered to himself. "If there is a heaven, and
your sort inhabit it, hell was reformed long ago."</p>

<p>"What are you muttering all to yourself, Jim?" she insisted.
"What troubles you?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. You've picked the wrong man. I'm absolutely unfit
for you. I know about all those decent things you believe in&mdash;all
the things you <em>are</em>! But I don't know about them from
personal experience; I never did anything decent because it was
my duty to do it&mdash;except by accident. I never took a spiritual
interest in anything or anybody, including myself! I never made
a worthy effort; I never earned one second's worth of noble repose.
And now&mdash;if there's anything in me to begin on&mdash;it's probably
my duty to release you until I have made something of myself,
before I come whining around asking you to marry a man not fit
to marry&#11834;"</p>

<p>"My darling!" she protested, half laughing, half in tears, and
closing his angry lips with both her hands. "I want <em>you</em>,
not a saint or a holy man, or an archangel fresh from paradise!
I want you as you <em>are</em>&mdash;as you have been&mdash;as you are going
to be dear! Did any girl who ever lived find pleasure in perfection?
Even in art it is undesirable. That's the beauty of aspiration;
the pleasures of effort never pall. I don't know whether I'm laughing
or crying, Jim! You look so solemn and miserable, and&mdash;and funny!
But if you try to look dignified now, I'll certainly laugh! You
dear, blessed, overgrown boy&mdash;just as bad as you possibly can
be! Just as funny and unreasonable and perverse as are all boys!
But Jacqueline loves you dearly&mdash;oh, dearly&mdash;and she trusts you
with her heart and her happiness and with every beauty yet undreamed
and unrevealed that a girl could learn to desire on earth! Are
you contented? Oh, Jim! Jim! If you knew how I adore you! You
must go, dear. It will mean a long night's work for me if you
don't. But it's so hard to let you go&mdash;when <em>I&mdash;</em>love you
so! When I love you so! Good-bye. Yes, to-morrow. Don't call at
noon; Mrs. Hammerton is coming for a five-minute chat. And I do
want you to myself for the few moments we may have together. Come
about five and we can have tea here beside my desk."</p>

<p>He came next day at five. The day after that he arrived at the
same hour, bringing with him her ring; and, as he slipped it over
her finger, for the first time her self-control slipped, too,
and she bent swiftly and kissed the jewel that he was holding.</p>

<p>Then, flushed and abashed, she shrank away, an exquisite picture
of confusion, and stood turning and turning the ring around, her
head obstinately lowered, absolutely unresponsive again to his
arm around her and his cheek resting close against hers.</p>

<p>"What a beauty of a ring, Jim!" she managed to say at last. "No
other engagement ring ever existed half as lovely and splendid
as my betrothal ring. I am sorry for all the empresses and queens
and princesses who can never hope to possess a ring to equal the
ring of Jacqueline Nevers, dealer in antiquities."</p>

<p>"Nor can they hope to possess such a hand to adorn it," he said,
"&mdash;the most beautiful, the purest, whitest, softest, most innocent
hand in the world! The magic hand of Jacqueline!"</p>

<p>"Do you like it?" she asked, shyly conscious of its beauty.</p>

<p>"It is matchless, darling. Let empresses shriek with envy."</p>

<p>"I'm listening very intently, but I don't hear them. Jim. Also,
I've seen a shop-girl with far lovelier hands. But please go on
thinking so and hearing crowned heads shriek. I rather like your
imagination."</p>

<p>He laughed from sheer happiness:</p>

<p>"I've got something to whisper to you. Shall I?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Shall I whisper it?"</p>

<p>She inclined her small head daintily, then:</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, startled and blushing to the tips of her
ears.</p>

<p>"Will you be ready?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>yes. Yes &mdash;I'll be ready&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Does it make you happy?"</p>

<p>"I can't realise &mdash;I didn't know it was to be so soon&mdash;so
immediate&#11834;"</p>

<p>"We'll go to Silverwood. We can catch the evening express&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Dearest!"</p>

<p>"You can go away with me for <em>one</em> week, can't you?"</p>

<p>"I can't go now!" she faltered.</p>

<p>"For how long can you go, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I've got to be back on Tuesday morning."</p>

<p>"Tuesday!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it dreadful, Jim. But I can't avoid it if we are to be
married on Monday next. I must deal honourably by my clients who
trust me. I warned you that our wedding trip would have to be
postponed if you married me this way&mdash;didn't I, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She stood looking at him timidly, almost fearfully, as he took
two or three quick, nervous steps across the floor, turned and
came back to her.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "Our wedding trip will have to wait, then;
but our wedding won't. We'll be married Monday, go to Silverwood,
and come back Tuesday&mdash;if it's a matter of honour. I never again
mean to interfere with your life's business, Jacqueline. You know
what is best; you are free and entitled to the right of decision."</p>

<p>"Yes. But because I <em>must</em> decide about things that concern
myself alone, you don't think I adore you any the less, do you,
Jim?"</p>

<p>"Nor do I love you the less, Jacqueline, because I can decide
nothing for you, do nothing for you."</p>

<p>"Jim! You <em>can</em> decide everything for me&mdash;do everything!
And you <em>have</em> done everything for me&mdash;by giving me my
freedom to decide for myself!"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> gave it to you, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Did you think I would have taken it if you had refused it?"</p>

<p>"But you said your happiness depended on it."</p>

<p>"Which is why you gave it to me, isn't it?" she asked seriously.</p>

<p>He laughed. "You wonderful girl, to make me believe that any
generosity of mine is responsible for your freedom!"</p>

<p>"But it is! Otherwise, I would have obeyed you and been disgraced
in my own estimation."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that mine is to be the final decision always?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, Jim."</p>

<p>He laughed again. "Empty authority, dear&mdash;a shadowy symbol of
traditional but obsolete prerogative."</p>

<p>"You are wrong. Your decision is final. But&mdash;as I know it will
always be for my happiness, I can always appeal from your prejudice
to your intelligence," she added naïvely. And for a moment was
surprised at his unrestrained laughter.</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" she admitted, laughing, too. "Between
you and me the right thing always will be done sooner or later."</p>

<p>His laughter died out; he said soberly: "Always, God willing.
It may be a little hard for me to learn&mdash;as it's hard, now, for
example, to say good-bye."</p>

<p>"Jim!"</p>

<p>"You know I must, darling."</p>

<p>"But I don't mind sitting up a few minutes later to-night&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know you don't. But here's where I exercise my harmlessly
arbitrary authority for your happiness and for the sake of your
good digestion."</p>

<p>"What a brute you are!"</p>

<p>"I know it. Back to your desk, darling! And go to bed early."</p>

<p>"I wanted you to stay&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Ha! So you begin to feel the tyranny of man! I'm going! I've
got a job, too, if you want to know."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Certainly! How long did you suppose I could stand it to see
you at that desk and then go and sit in a silly club?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, darling?" she asked, radiant.</p>

<p>"I mean that Jack Cairns, who is a broker, has offered me a job
at a small but perfectly proper salary, with the usual commission
on all business I bring in to the office. And I've taken it!"</p>

<p>"But, dear&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Vail can run my farm without any advice from me. I'm going
to give him more authority and hold him responsible. If the place
can pay for itself and let us keep the armour and jades, that's
all I ask of it. But I am asking more of myself&mdash;since I have
begun to really know you. And I'm going to work for our bread
and butter, and earn enough to support us both and lay something
aside. You know we've got to think of that, because&#11834;" He looked
very serious, hesitated, bent and whispered something that sent
the bright colour flying in her cheeks; then he caught her hand
and kissed the ring-finger.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she murmured, clinging for an instant to his hand.</p>

<p>The next moment he was gone; and she stood alone for a while
by her desk, his ring resting against her lips, her eyes closed.</p>

<p>Sunday she spent with him. They went together to St. John's Cathedral
in the morning&mdash;the first time he had been inside a church in
years. And he was in considerable awe of the place and of her
until they finally emerged into the sunshine of Morningside Park.</p>

<p>Under a magnificent and cloudless sky, they walked together,
silent or loquacious by turns, bold and shy, confident and timid.
And she was a little surprised to find that, in the imminence
of marriage, her trepidation was composure itself compared to
the anxiety which seemed to assail him. All he had thought of
was the license and the clergyman; and they had attended to those
matters together. But she had wished him to have Jack Cairns present,
and had told him that she desired to ask some friend of her girlhood
to be her bridesmaid.</p>

<p>"Have you done so?" he inquired, as they descended the heights
of Morningside, the beautiful weather tempting them to a long
homeward stroll through Central Park.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jim, I must tell you about her. She, like myself, is not
a girl that men of your sort might expect to meet&#11834;"</p>

<p>"The loss is ours, Jacqueline."</p>

<p>"That is very sweet of you. Only I had better tell you about
Cynthia Lessler&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Who?" he asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"Cynthia Lessler, my girlhood friend."</p>

<p>"She is an actress, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Her home life was very unhappy. But I think she has much
talent, too."</p>

<p>"She has."</p>

<p>"I am glad you think so. Anyway, she is my oldest friend, and
I have asked her to be my bridesmaid to-morrow."</p>

<p>He continued silent beside her so long that she said timidly:</p>

<p>"Do you mind, Jim?"</p>

<p>"I was only thinking&mdash;how it might look in the papers&mdash;and there
are other girls you already know whose names would mean a lot&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But I don't want to pretend to be what I am not,
even in the papers. I suppose I do need all the social corroboration
I can have. I know what you mean, dear. But there were reasons.
I thought it all over. Cynthia is an old friend, not very happy,
not the fortunate and blessed girl that your love is making of
me. But she is good and sweet and loyal to me, and I can't abandon
old friends, especially one who is not very fortunate&mdash;and I &mdash;I
thought perhaps it might help her a little&mdash;in various ways&mdash;to
be my bridesmaid."</p>

<p>"That is like you," he said, reddening. "You never say or do
anything but there lies in it some primary lesson in decency to
me."</p>

<p>"You goose! Isn't it natural for a girl to wish for her oldest
friend at such a time? That's really all there is to the matter.
And I do hope you will like Cynthia."</p>

<p>He nodded, preoccupied. After a few moments he said:</p>

<p>"Did you know that Jack Cairns had met her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh!" His troubled eyes sought hers, then shifted.</p>

<p>"That was another reason I wish to ask her," she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"What reason?"</p>

<p>"Because Mr. Cairns knew her only as a very young, very lonely,
very unhappy girl, inexperienced, friendless, poor, almost shelterless;
and engaged in a profession upon which it is almost traditional
for men to prey. And I wish him to know her again as a girl who
is slowly advancing in an honest profession&mdash;as a modest, sweet,
self-respecting woman&mdash;and as my friend."</p>

<p>"And mine," he said.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;darling!" she whispered.</p>
