<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>We looked at one another.
</p>
<p>‘Thou seest,’ I said, ‘they have taken away the door. Is there aught
with which we may fill the place? Speak quickly for they will be on us
ere the daylight.’ I spoke thus, because I knew that we must hold this
place or none, as there were no inner doors in the palace, the rooms
being separated one from another by curtains. I also knew that if
we could by any means defend this doorway the murderers could get in
nowhere else; for the palace is absolutely impregnable, that is, since
the secret door by which Sorais had entered on that memorable night of
attempted murder had, by Nyleptha’s order, been closed up with masonry.
</p><p>‘I have it,’ said Nyleptha, who, as usual with her, rose to the
emergency in a wonderful way. ‘On the farther side of the courtyard are
blocks of cut marble--the workmen brought them there for the bed of the
new statue of Incubu, my lord; let us block the door with them.’
</p><p>I jumped at the idea; and having despatched one of the remaining maidens
down the great stair to see if she could obtain assistance from the
docks below, where her father, who was a great merchant employing
many men, had his dwelling-place, and set another to watch through the
doorway, we made our way back across the courtyard to where the hewn
marble lay; and here we met Kara returning from despatching the first
two messengers. There were the marble blocks, sure enough, broad,
massive lumps, some six inches thick, and weighing about eighty pounds
each, and there, too, were a couple of implements like small stretchers,
that the workmen used to carry them on. Without delay we got some of the
blocks on to the stretchers, and four of the girls carried them to the
doorway.
</p><p>‘Listen, Macumazahn,’ said Umslopogaas, ‘if those low fellows come, it
is I who will hold the stair against them till the door is built up.
Nay, nay, it will be a man’s death: gainsay me not, old friend. It has
been a good day, let it now be good night. See, I throw myself down to
rest on the marble there; when their footsteps are nigh, wake thou me,
not before, for I need my strength,’ and without a word he went outside
and flung himself down on the marble, and was instantly asleep.
</p><p>At this time, I too was overcome, and was forced to sit down by the
doorway, and content myself with directing operations. The girls
brought the block, while Kara and Nyleptha built them up across the
six-foot-wide doorway, a triple row of them, for less would be useless.
But the marble had to be brought forty yards and then there were forty
yards to run back, and though the girls laboured gloriously, even
staggering along alone, each with a block in her arms, it was slow work,
dreadfully slow.
</p><p>The light was growing now, and presently, in the silence, we heard a
commotion at the far-bottom of the stair, and the faint clinking of
armed men. As yet the wall was only two feet high, and we had been eight
minutes at the building of it. So they had come. Alphonse had heard
aright.
</p><p>The clanking sound came nearer, and in the ghostly grey of the dawning
we could make out long files of men, some fifty or so in all, slowly
creeping up the stair. They were now at the half-way standing place that
rested on the great flying arch; and here, perceiving that something
was going on above, they, to our great gain, halted for three or four
minutes and consulted, then slowly and cautiously advanced again.
</p><p>We had been nearly a quarter of an hour at the work now, and it was
almost three feet high.
</p><p>Then I woke Umslopogaas. The great man rose, stretched himself, and
swung Inkosi-kaas round his head.
</p><p>‘It is well,’ he said. ‘I feel as a young man once more. My strength has
come back to me, ay, even as a lamp flares up before it dies. Fear not,
I shall fight a good fight; the wine and the sleep have put a new heart
into me.
</p><p>‘Macumazahn, I have dreamed a dream. I dreamed that thou and I stood
together on a star, and looked down on the world, and thou wast as a
spirit, Macumazahn, for light flamed through thy flesh, but I could not
see what was the fashion of mine own face. The hour has come for us,
old hunter. So be it: we have had our time, but I would that in it I had
seen some more such fights as yesterday’s.
</p><p>‘Let them bury me after the fashion of my people, Macumazahn, and set
my eyes towards Zululand;’ and he took my hand and shook it, and then
turned to face the advancing foe.
</p><p>Just then, to my astonishment, the Zu-Vendi officer Kara clambered over
our improvised wall in his quiet, determined sort of way, and took his
stand by the Zulu, unsheathing his sword as he did so.
</p><p>‘What, comest thou too?’ laughed out the old warrior. ‘Welcome--a
welcome to thee, brave heart! Ow! for the man who can die like a man;
ow! for the death grip and the ringing of steel. Ow! we are ready. We
wet our beaks like eagles, our spears flash in the sun; we shake our
assegais, and are hungry to fight. Who comes to give greeting to the
Chieftainess [Inkosi-kaas]? Who would taste her kiss, whereof the fruit
is death? I, the Woodpecker, I, the Slaughterer, I the Swiftfooted! I,
Umslopogaas, of the tribe of the Maquilisini, of the people of Amazulu,
a captain of the regiment of the Nkomabakosi: I, Umslopogaas, the son
of Indabazimbi, the son of Arpi the son of Mosilikaatze, I of the royal
blood of T’Chaka, I of the King’s House, I the Ringed Man, I the Induna,
I call to them as a buck calls, I challenge them, I await them. Ow! it
is thou, it is thou!’
</p><p>As he spake, or rather chanted, his wild war-song, the armed men,
among whom in the growing light I recognized both Nasta and Agon, came
streaming up the stair with a rush, and one big fellow, armed with a
heavy spear, dashed up the ten semicircular steps ahead of his comrades
and struck at the great Zulu with the spear. Umslopogaas moved his
body but not his legs, so that the blow missed him, and next instant
Inkosi-kaas crashed through headpiece, hair and skull, and the
man’s corpse was rattling down the steps. As he dropped, his round
hippopotamus-hide shield fell from his hand on to the marble, and the
Zulu stooped down and seized it, still chanting as he did so.
</p><p>In another second the sturdy Kara had also slain a man, and then began a
scene the like of which has not been known to me.
</p><p>Up rushed the assailants, one, two, three at a time, and as fast as they
came, the axe crashed and the sword swung, and down they rolled again,
dead or dying. And ever as the fight thickened, the old Zulu’s eye
seemed to get quicker and his arm stronger. He shouted out his war-cries
and the names of chiefs whom he had slain, and the blows of his awful
axe rained straight and true, shearing through everything they fell on.
There was none of the scientific method he was so fond of about this
last immortal fight of his; he had no time for it, but struck with his
full strength, and at every stroke a man sank in his tracks, and went
rattling down the marble steps.
</p><p>They hacked and hewed at him with swords and spears, wounding him in a
dozen places till he streamed red with blood; but the shield protected
his head and the chain-shirt his vitals, and for minute after minute,
aided by the gallant Zu-Vendi, he still held the stair.
</p><p>At last Kara’s sword broke, and he grappled with a foe, and they rolled
down together, and he was cut to pieces, dying like the brave man that
he was.
</p><p>Umslopogaas was alone now, but he never blenched or turned. Shouting
out some wild Zulu battle-cry, he beat down a foe, ay, and another, and
another, till at last they drew back from the slippery blood-stained
steps, and stared at him with amazement, thinking that he was no mortal
man.
</p><p>The wall of marble block was four feet six high now, and hope rose in my
teeth as I leaned there against it a miserable helpless log, and ground
my teeth, and watched that glorious struggle. I could do no more for I
had lost my revolver in the battle.
</p><p>And old Umslopogaas, he leaned too on his good axe, and, faint as he
was with wounds, he mocked them, he called them ‘women’--the grand old
warrior, standing there one against so many! And for a breathing space
none would come against him, notwithstanding Nasta’s exhortations, till
at last old Agon, who, to do him justice, was a brave man, mad with
baffled rage, and seeing that the wall would soon be built and his plans
defeated, shook the great spear he held, and rushed up the dripping
steps.
</p><p>‘Ah, ah!’ shouted the Zulu, as he recognized the priest’s flowing white
beard, ‘it is thou, old “witch-finder”! Come on! I await thee, white
“medicine man”; come on! come on! I have sworn to slay thee, and I ever
keep my faith.’
</p><p>On he came, taking him at his word, and drave the big spear with such
force at Umslopogaas that it sunk right through the tough shield and
pierced him in the neck. The Zulu cast down the transfixed shield, and
that moment was Agon’s last, for before he could free his spear
and strike again, with a shout of ‘_There’s for thee, Rain-maker!_’
Umslopogaas gripped Inkosi-kaas with both hands and whirled on high and
drave her right on to his venerable head, so that Agon rolled down dead
among the corpses of his fellow-murderers, and there was an end to him
and his plots altogether. And even as he fell, a great cry rose from the
foot of the stair, and looking out through the portion of the doorway
that was yet unclosed, we saw armed men rushing up to the rescue, and
called an answer to their shouts. Then the would-be murderers who yet
remained on the stairway, and amongst whom I saw several priests, turned
to fly, but, having nowhere to go, were butchered as they fled. Only one
man stayed, and he was the great lord Nasta, Nyleptha’s suitor, and
the father of the plot. For a moment the black-bearded Nasta stood with
bowed face leaning on his long sword as though in despair, and then,
with a dreadful shout, he too rushed up at the Zulu, and, swinging the
glittering sword around his head, dealt him such a mighty blow beneath
his guard, that the keen steel of the heavy blade bit right through the
chain armour and deep into Umslopogaas’ side, for a moment paralysing
him and causing him to drop his axe.
</p><p>Raising the sword again, Nasta sprang forward to make an end of him,
but little he knew his foe. With a shake and a yell of fury, the Zulu
gathered himself together and sprang straight at Nasta’s throat, as I
have sometimes seen a wounded lion spring. He struck him full as his
foot was on the topmost stair, and his long arms closing round him like
iron bands, down they rolled together struggling furiously. Nasta was a
strong man and a desperate, but he could not match the strongest man in
Zululand, sore wounded though he was, whose strength was as the strength
of a bull. In a minute the end came. I saw old Umslopogaas stagger
to his feet--ay, and saw him by a single gigantic effort swing up the
struggling Nasta and with a shout of triumph hurl him straight over the
parapet of the bridge, to be crushed to powder on the rocks two hundred
feet below.
</p><p>The succour which had been summoned by the girl who had passed down the
stair before the assassins passed up was at hand, and the loud shouts
which reached us from the outer gates told us that the town was also
aroused, and the men awakened by the women were calling to be admitted.
Some of Nyleptha’s brave ladies, who in their night-shifts and with
their long hair streaming down their backs, just as they had been
aroused from rest, went off to admit them at the side entrance, whilst
others, assisted by the rescuing party outside, pushed and pulled down
the marble blocks they had placed there with so much labour.
</p><p>Soon the wall was down again, and through the doorway, followed by a
crowd of rescuers, staggered old Umslopogaas, an awful and, in a way, a
glorious figure. The man was a mass of wounds, and a glance at his wild
eye told me that he was dying. The ‘keshla’ gum-ring upon his head was
severed in two places by sword-cuts, one just over the curious hole in
his skull, and the blood poured down his face from the gashes. Also on
the right side of his neck was a stab from a spear, inflicted by
Agon; there was a deep cut on his left arm just below where the mail
shirt-sleeve stopped, and on the right side of his body the armour was
severed by a gash six inches long, where Nasta’s mighty sword had bitten
through it and deep into its wearer’s vitals.
</p><p>On, axe in hand, he staggered, that dreadful-looking, splendid savage,
and the ladies forgot to turn faint at the scene of blood, and
cheered him, as well they might, but he never stayed or heeded. With
outstretched arms and tottering gait he pursued his way, followed by us
all along the broad shell-strewn walk that ran through the courtyard,
past the spot where the blocks of marble lay, through the round arched
doorway and the thick curtains that hung within it, down the
short passage and into the great hall, which was now filling with
hastily-armed men, who poured through the side entrance. Straight up
the hall he went, leaving behind him a track of blood on the marble
pavement, till at last he reached the sacred stone, which stood in the
centre of it, and here his strength seemed to fail him, for he stopped
and leaned upon his axe. Then suddenly he lifted up his voice and cried
aloud--
</p><p>‘I die, I die--but it was a kingly fray. Where are they who came up the
great stair? I see them not. Art thou there, Macumazahn, or art thou
gone before to wait for me in the dark whither I go? The blood blinds
me--the place turns round--I hear the voice of waters.’
</p><p>Next, as though a new thought had struck him, he lifted the red axe and
kissed the blade.
</p><p>‘Farewell, Inkosi-kaas,’ he cried. ‘Nay, nay, we will go together; we
cannot part, thou and I. We have lived too long one with another, thou
and I.
</p><p>‘One more stroke, only one! A good stroke! a straight stroke! a
strong stroke!’ and, drawing himself to his full height, with a wild
heart-shaking shout, he with both hands began to whirl the axe round his
head till it looked like a circle of flaming steel. Then, suddenly, with
awful force he brought it down straight on to the crown of the mass
of sacred stone. A shower of sparks flew up, and such was the almost
superhuman strength of the blow, that the massive marble split with
a rending sound into a score of pieces, whilst of Inkosi-kaas there
remained but some fragments of steel and a fibrous rope of shattered
horn that had been the handle. Down with a crash on to the pavement fell
the fragments of the holy stone, and down with a crash on to them, still
grasping the knob of Inkosi-kaas, fell the brave old Zulu--<u>dead</u>.
</p><p>And thus the hero died.
</p><p>A gasp of wonder and astonishment rose from all those who witnessed
the extraordinary sight, and then somebody cried, ‘_The prophecy! the
prophecy!_ He has shattered the sacred stone!’ and at once a murmuring
arose.
</p><p>‘Ay,’ said Nyleptha, with that quick wit which distinguishes her.
‘Ay, my people, he has shattered the stone, and behold the prophecy is
fulfilled, for a stranger king rules in Zu-Vendis. Incubu, my lord, hath
beat Sorais back, and I fear her no more, and to him who hath saved the
Crown it shall surely be. And this man,’ she said, turning to me and
laying her hand upon my shoulder, ‘wot ye that, though wounded in the
fight of yesterday, he rode with that old warrior who lies there, one
hundred miles ‘twixt sun set and rise to save me from the plots of cruel
men. Ay, and he has saved me, by a very little, and therefore because of
the deeds that they have done--deeds of glory such as our history cannot
show the like--therefore I say that the name of Macumazahn and the name
of dead Umslopogaas, ay, and the name of Kara, my servant, who aided him
to hold the stair, shall be blazoned in letters of gold above my throne,
and shall be glorious for ever while the land endures. I, the Queen,
have said it.’
</p><p>This spirited speech was met with loud cheering, and I said that after
all we had only done our duty, as it is the fashion of both Englishmen
and Zulus to do, and there was nothing to make an outcry about; at
which they cheered still more, and then I was supported across the outer
courtyard to my old quarters, in order that I might be put to bed. As
I went, my eyes lit upon the brave horse Daylight that lay there, his
white head outstretched on the pavement, exactly as he had fallen on
entering the yard; and I bade those who supported me take me near him,
that I might look on the good beast once more before he was dragged
away. And as I looked, to my astonishment he opened his eyes and,
lifting his head a little, whinnied faintly. I could have shouted for
joy to find that he was not dead, only unfortunately I had not a shout
left in me; but as it was, grooms were sent for and he was lifted up
and wine poured down his throat, and in a fortnight he was as well and
strong as ever, and is the pride and joy of all the people of Milosis,
who, whenever they see him, point him out to the little children as the
‘horse which saved the White Queen’s life’.
</p><p>Then I went on and got off to bed, and was washed and had my mail shirt
removed. They hurt me a great deal in getting it off, and no wonder, for
on my left breast and side was a black bruise the size of a saucer.
</p><p>The next thing that I remember was the tramp of horsemen outside the
palace wall, some ten hours later. I raised myself and asked what was
the news, and they told me that a large body of cavalry sent by Curtis
to assist the Queen had arrived from the scene of the battle, which they
had left two hours after sundown. When they left, the wreck of Sorais’
army was in full retreat upon M’Arstuna, followed by all our effective
cavalry. Sir Henry was encamping the remains of his worn-out forces on
the site (such is the fortune of war) that Sorais had occupied the night
before, and proposed marching to M’Arstuna on the morrow. Having heard
this, I felt that I could die with a light heart, and then everything
became a blank.
</p>
<p>When next I awoke the first thing I saw was the round disc of a
sympathetic eyeglass, behind which was Good.
</p><p>‘How are you getting on, old chap?’ said a voice from the neighbourhood
of the eyeglass.
</p><p>‘What are you doing here?’ I asked faintly. ‘You ought to be at
M’Arstuna--have you run away, or what?’
</p><p>‘M’Arstuna,’ he replied cheerfully. ‘Ah, M’Arstuna fell last
week--you’ve been unconscious for a fortnight, you see--with all the
honours of war, you know--trumpets blowing, flags flying, just as though
they had had the best of it; but for all that, weren’t they glad to go.
Israel made for his tents, I can tell you--never saw such a sight in my
life.’
</p><p>‘And Sorais?’ I asked.
</p><p>‘Sorais--oh, Sorais is a prisoner; they gave her up, the scoundrels,’ he
added, with a change of tone--‘sacrificed the Queen to save their skins,
you see. She is being brought up here, and I don’t know what will happen
to her, poor soul!’ and he sighed.
</p><p>‘Where is Curtis?’ I asked.
</p><p>‘He is with Nyleptha. She rode out to meet us today, and there was
a grand to-do, I can tell you. He is coming to see you tomorrow; the
doctors (for there is a medical “faculty” in Zu-Vendis as elsewhere)
thought that he had better not come today.’
</p><p>I said nothing, but somehow I thought to myself that notwithstanding the
doctors he might have given me a look; but there, when a man is newly
married and has just gained a great victory, he is apt to listen to the
advice of doctors, and quite right too.
</p><p>Just then I heard a familiar voice informing me that ‘Monsieur must
now couch himself,’ and looking up perceived Alphonse’s enormous black
mustachios curling away in the distance.
</p><p>‘So you are here?’ I said.
</p><p>‘Mais oui, Monsieur; the war is now finished, my military instincts are
satisfied, and I return to nurse Monsieur.’
</p><p>I laughed, or rather tried to; but whatever may have been Alphonse’s
failings as a warrior (and I fear that he did not come up to the level
of his heroic grandfather in this particular, showing thereby how true
is the saying that it is a bad thing to be overshadowed by some great
ancestral name), a better or kinder nurse never lived. Poor Alphonse! I
hope he will always think of me as kindly as I think of him.
</p><p>On the morrow I saw Curtis and Nyleptha with him, and he told me the
whole history of what had happened since Umslopogaas and I galloped
wildly away from the battle to save the life of the Queen. It seemed
to me that he had managed the thing exceedingly well, and showed great
ability as a general. Of course, however, our loss had been dreadfully
heavy--indeed, I am afraid to say how many perished in the desperate
battle I have described, but I know that the slaughter has appreciably
affected the male population of the country. He was very pleased to see
me, dear fellow that he is, and thanked me with tears in his eyes
for the little that I had been able to do. I saw him, however, start
violently when his eyes fell upon my face.
</p><p>As for Nyleptha, she was positively radiant now that ‘her dear lord’ had
come back with no other injury than an ugly scar on his forehead. I do
not believe that she allowed all the fearful slaughter that had taken
place to weigh ever so little in the balance against this one fact, or
even to greatly diminish her joy; and I cannot blame her for it, seeing
that it is the nature of loving woman to look at all things through the
spectacles of her love, and little does she reck of the misery of the
many if the happiness of the <u>one</u> be assured. That is human nature,
which the Positivists tell us is just perfection; so no doubt it is all
right.
</p><p>‘And what art thou going to do with Sorais?’ I asked her.
</p><p>Instantly her bright brow darkened to a frown.
</p><p>‘Sorais,’ she said, with a little stamp of the foot; ‘ah, but Sorais!’
</p><p>Sir Henry hastened to turn the subject.
</p><p>‘You will soon be about and all right again now, old fellow,’ he said.
</p><p>I shook my head and laughed.
</p><p>‘Don’t deceive yourselves,’ I said. ‘I may be about for a little, but
I shall never be all right again. I am a dying man, Curtis. I may die
slow, but die I must. Do you know I have been spitting blood all the
morning? I tell you there is something working away into my lung; I can
feel it. There, don’t look distressed; I have had my day, and am ready
to go. Give me the mirror, will you? I want to look at myself.’
</p><p>He made some excuse, but I saw through it and insisted, and at last he
handed me one of the discs of polished silver set in a wooden frame like
a hand-screen, which serve as looking-glasses in Zu-Vendis. I looked and
put it down.
</p><p>‘Ah,’ I said quietly, ‘I thought so; and you talk of my getting all
right!’ I did not like to let them see how shocked I really was at my
own appearance. My grizzled stubby hair was turned snow-white, and my
yellow face was shrunk like an aged woman’s and had two deep purple
rings painted beneath the eyes.
</p><p>Here Nyleptha began to cry, and Sir Henry again turned the subject,
telling me that the artists had taken a cast of the dead body of old
Umslopogaas, and that a great statue in black marble was to be erected
of him in the act of splitting the sacred stone, which was to be matched
by another statue in white marble of myself and the horse Daylight as he
appeared when, at the termination of that wild ride, he sank beneath me
in the courtyard of the palace. I have since seen these statues, which
at the time of writing this, six months after the battle, are nearly
finished; and very beautiful they are, especially that of Umslopogaas,
which is exactly like him. As for that of myself, it is good, but they
have idealized my ugly face a little, which is perhaps as well, seeing
that thousands of people will probably look at it in the centuries to
come, and it is not pleasant to look at ugly things.
</p><p>Then they told me that Umslopogaas’ last wish had been carried out, and
that, instead of being cremated, as I shall be, after the usual custom
here, he had been tied up, Zulu fashion, with his knees beneath his
chin, and, having been wrapped in a thin sheet of beaten gold, entombed
in a hole hollowed out of the masonry of the semicircular space at the
top of the stair he defended so splendidly, which faces, as far as we
can judge, almost exactly towards Zululand. There he sits, and will sit
for ever, for they embalmed him with spices, and put him in an air-tight
stone coffer, keeping his grim watch beneath the spot he held alone
against a multitude; and the people say that at night his ghost rises
and stands shaking the phantom of Inkosi-kaas at phantom foes. Certainly
they fear during the dark hours to pass the place where the hero is
buried.
</p><p>Oddly enough, too, a new legend or prophecy has arisen in the land in
that unaccountable way in which such things to arise among barbarous
and semi-civilized people, blowing, like the wind, no man knows whence.
According to this saying, so long as the old Zulu sits there, looking
down the stairway he defended when alive, so long will the New House of
the Stairway, springing from the union of the Englishman and Nyleptha,
endure and flourish; but when he is taken from thence, or when, ages
after, his bones at last crumble into dust, the House will fall, and the
Stairway shall fall, and the Nation of the Zu-Vendi shall cease to be a
Nation.
