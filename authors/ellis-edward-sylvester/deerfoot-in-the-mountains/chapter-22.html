<p>If you will examine the map of the State of Montana you will
note that the central county bears the name of Fergus, while one
of the counties lying directly south is Yellowstone. The boundary
between these two is the Musselshell River, which, flowing directly
northward, separates Custer and Dawson counties, joining the Missouri
at the northeastern corner of Fergus County. It was in the latter
part of May, 1805, that Deerfoot and the two Shelton boys, after
a long, wearisome ride and tramp through a wild and unknown region,
broken by mountain spurs and crossed by numberless streams, arrived
at the mouth of the Musselshell.</p>

<p>Even with summer hardly a fortnight off, ice formed at night,
flurries of snow filled the air at times and the camp fire became
a necessity. And yet our friends were plagued by mosquitoes, grass
was plentiful, and there was no lack of game. The party seemed
to be sharing the summer and winter seasons, with the most disagreeable
features of both.</p>

<p>Having followed the Missouri so far, Deerfoot said that a crossing
place must be found before the morrow, for it was inevitable that
the farther they went down stream the larger it would become,
because of its numerous tributaries. The Missouri was an eighth
of a mile across at its junction with the Musselshell, but its
current was gentle. Not an Indian had been seen for four days,
and Deerfoot was on foot searching the northern shore for a good
crossing place when George Shelton called out:</p>

<p>"Look! There are white men on the other side of the river!"</p>

<p>Deerfoot had observed them and had halted and scrutinized them
with no little interest and wonder. The first sight was of six
or eight men coming round a bend in the Missouri, all having hold
of a long elk-skin rope which, passing over the shoulder of each,
was fastened to a large pirogue. Directly behind them was a similar
boat, and then six small canoes, the whole string being towed
by fully a score of men. The boats contained a large amount of
luggage, while a dozen men, one of whom was a negro servant, took
turns at the labor.</p>

<p>Since the afternoon was drawing to a close the party came to
a pause, and the next minute were looking across the stream at
the three youths with their four animals, the riders having dismounted,
each party much impressed by sight of the other. At the suggestion
of Deerfoot, Victor Shelton acted as spokesman.</p>

<p>"Helloa!" called the lad, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>A man answered in a clear voice:</p>

<p>"This is a United States expedition under Captains Lewis and
Clark, on its way to the Pacific Ocean. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"This is an American expedition under Deerfoot the Shawanoe,
on its way from the Pacific Ocean."</p>

<p>The man turned and said something to a companion near him. They
seemed amused by the reply, and the former speaker called back:</p>

<p>"Won't you join us in camp?"</p>

<p>"We shall be glad to do so. We are hunting for a ford."</p>

<p>"I don't think you will find any. We will send our canoes to
you and you can swim your horses over."</p>

<p>"We shall be very much obliged, and shall be glad to stay with
you till morning."</p>

<p>A few minutes later two canoes, each in charge of a single man,
put out from the southern shore and were paddled across the Missouri
to our friends. The luggage was removed from the back of Zigzag
and placed in one of the boats, which was so deeply laden that
it could carry no one beside the white man. The other was buoyant
enough, though severely taxed, to sustain the four. The horses
swam beside the boats.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot took his place he said to the white man:</p>

<p>"My brother has worked hard. Will he not let Deerfoot take the
paddle?"</p>

<p>"I have no objection," replied the other, with a grin, "if you
think you know how to do it better than I."</p>

<p>"No better than my brother, but I hope nearly as well."</p>

<p>"Just watch him," added Victor. "If there's anybody on either
side of the Mississippi that can beat that Shawanoe handling a
canoe, I'll eat him, boots and all."</p>

<p>Deerfoot had no wish to display his skill, but since it was impossible
for him to paddle without doing that he quickly won the admiration
of the fellow, who was tired and glad to be relieved from work.
He noted the easy grace and slight effort with which the dusky
youth drove the craft athwart the current, quickly leaving the
other boat behind, and called to his companion:</p>

<p>"Pete, he knows his business! Never seen his like. Hitch your
canoe fast and he'll tow you over without using more than one
hand and with both eyes shet."</p>

<p>Deerfoot acted as if he did not understand the words, and impelled
the craft so accurately that when it touched shore it did so at
a point precisely opposite the spot where he and his companions
had entered the craft.</p>

<p>While our friends were crossing the Missouri the explorers completed
their preparations for the evening. They had toiled hard all day
in pulling, pushing and paddling the boats up stream, for there
were not many places where progress could be made by any other
means. The pirogues were furnished with sails, and now and then
a strong favorable wind lightened the toil of the men.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot and the boys stepped out of the boat and came up
the low but steep bank, two persons, attired in rough garb resembling
that worn by hunters, came forward and cordially received them.
The one in advance extended his hand and said:</p>

<p>"I am Captain Meriwether Lewis, and this is my friend, Captain
William Clark. We are glad to meet you."</p>

<p>As he spoke he offered his hand to George Shelton, who introduced
himself and then his companions.</p>

<p>"This is my twin brother Victor, though he hardly looks it. This
is our guide, Deerfoot the Shawanoe."</p>

<p>The two officers welcomed the little party, and Captain Lewis
added:</p>

<p>"We should be glad to have you spend several days with us, but
you seem to be traveling in the opposite direction."</p>

<p>"Yes," said George, "we are homeward bound, and have been gone
so long that we feel in somewhat of a hurry."</p>

<p>"May I ask where your home is?"</p>

<p>"In southern Ohio, at the settlement of Woodvale, near the mouth
of the Miami."</p>

<p>"You are a long way from there."</p>

<p>"Yes," Victor took it upon himself to remark, "but we have been
a good deal farther."</p>

<p>"When did you leave Woodvale?"</p>

<p>"About a year ago."</p>

<p>"And how far west have you been?"</p>

<p>"Far enough to get a glimpse of the Pacific Ocean."</p>

<p>"That is <em>our</em> destination. We thought we were to be the
first white men to make the journey."</p>

<p>"So you will be, for we did not go all the way to the coast.
I suppose you will do that?"</p>

<p>"Such are our instructions from President Jefferson."</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on other members of the exploring
party gathered round. George had yielded the place of spokesman
to his brother, and Deerfoot stood a few paces behind him. He
was conscious of the curious scrutiny he was under from several
of the members, but he acted as if unaware of it and held his
peace. But he, too, was using his eyes and listening to the talk
of the leaders, in whom he was much interested.</p>

<p>Victor fancied he detected just a shade of disappointment in
the last remark of Captain Lewis, and he hastened to add:</p>

<p>"We amount to nothing. Only two of us belong to your race, and
we cannot ask to be considered as men for a few years to come."</p>

<p>"You are husky-looking youngsters," added Captain Clark, from
his place beside his associate, as he looked admiringly at the
two lads.</p>

<p>"Where did you spend the winter?" continued Lewis.</p>

<p>"In the Blackfoot country, to the northwest. We reached there
last autumn and stayed until a few weeks ago."</p>

<p>"I need not ask you if you were well treated, for your looks
show that."</p>

<p>"They were all our friends. We should have perished so far north
had we not found refuge among them."</p>

<p>"But we are forgetting our hospitality. We will have your horses
looked after. Come over by the camp for supper, which will soon
be ready. That is the finest horse I ever saw. Which of you is
his owner?"</p>

<p>"He belongs to Deerfoot."</p>

<p>"Where did he get him?"</p>

<p>"Last year the Shawanoe's horse was hurt so badly that he had
to kill him. Soon after we came across this stallion and Deerfoot
managed to capture and tame him."</p>

<p>"He looks as if he might have been the king of a drove."</p>

<p>"He was. The Shawanoe cut him out and conquered him."</p>

<p>Now Deerfoot, while crossing the river, had warned the boys not
to indulge in any boasts about him, as you know they were fond
of doing. Despite his matchless prowess and skill, he disliked,
above everything else, to be paraded before others and to be forced
into showing what he was able to do. It was painful to George
and Victor to be compelled to suppress their feelings in this
way, but they meant to obey their friend, so far as they possibly
could.</p>

<p>It was evident that neither Captain Lewis nor Clark nor any of
the listeners believed the statement just made by Victor Shelton.
The latter glanced at the Shawanoe for permission to explain.
Deerfoot wrinkled his brow and shook his head. So the explanation
was not made&mdash;just then.</p>

<p>The group now sauntered over to the large fire that had been
kindled a few rods back from the river bank. Three men were busy
preparing the evening meal, the others sauntering here and there,
looking after the luggage, a portion of which had been brought
ashore. Deerfoot walked over to Whirlwind, who was expecting such
attention, and guided him some distance inland, where there was
plenty of succulent grass and he could graze apart from the common
herd. That equine would never lose his pride until he died. Patting
his nose and softly bidding him good-bye, the Shawanoe hastened
back to his friends, who had seated themselves on a fallen tree
on one side of the fire, while Captains Lewis and Clark were similarly
placed opposite. Two of the men were passing around ordinary tin
plates, but no knives and no forks were called into use, one's
fingers serving in their stead.</p>

<p>[Illustration: A Visit from Captains Lewis and Clark.]</p>

<p>The explorers had not suffered from any lack of game. The catfish
taken from the river weighed three or four pounds apiece, and
several deer, elks and bears had been shot. Among the latter was
one belonging to the grizzly species. To show the tenacity of
these mammoth brutes, the journal of the explorers records that
after the beast had been shot through the heart "he ran at his
usual pace nearly a quarter of a mile before he fell." Wild geese
were seen in such numbers that their killing often became so easy
that it could not be called sport.</p>

<p>By the time our friends had completed their meal night had fully
come, and the drop in the temperature made the warmth of the blaze
pleasant. A second fire had been started at some distance, where
most of the men gathered. Being apart from their leaders, there
was more freedom of action and speech. In the course of the evening
the boys heard the strains of a violin coming from the other camp,
and, turning their heads, saw one of the men seated on a boulder
with his head thrown back and vigorously sawing on his fiddle,
while his companions were dancing in the open space in front,
which was lit up by the firelight. Most of the hardy fellows solemnly
swayed their bodies and shuffled back and forth with their arms
akimbo, but others were more lively and dashed off jigs, reels
and rigadoons. A French <em>voyageur</em> suddenly threw up his
heels, supporting himself on his hands, and kept excellent time
to the notes of the fiddle.</p>

<p>Neither Lewis nor Clark had ever heard of Deerfoot, but it soon
developed that three of their men, Joseph and Reuben Shields and
George Shannon, of Kentucky, knew a good deal about him. Shannon
was but a boy himself, being only seventeen years old, but had
once met the Shawanoe along the Ohio, when he was in the company
of Simon Kenton. Deerfoot recalled the incident, and was glad
to renew the acquaintance. At the invitation of Shannon he walked
with him to the farther camp fire, and became a pleased witness
of the boisterous sport of the men.</p>
