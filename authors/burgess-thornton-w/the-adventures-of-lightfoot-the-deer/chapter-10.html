<p>Lightfoot the Deer is smart. Yes, Sir, Lightfoot the Deer is
smart. He has to be, especially in the hunting season, to save
his life. If he were not smart he would have been killed long
ago. He never makes the foolish mistake of thinking that other
people are not smart. He knew that the hunter who had started
out to follow him early that morning was not one to be easily
discouraged or to be fooled by simple tricks. He had a very great
respect for the smartness of that hunter. He knew that he couldn't
afford to be careless for one little minute.</p>

<p>The certainty of danger is sometimes easier to bear than the
uncertainty of not knowing whether or not there really is any
danger. Lightfoot felt that if he could know just where the hunter
was, he himself would know better what to do. The hunter might
have become discouraged and given up following him. In that case
he could rest and stop worrying. It would be better to know that
he was being followed than not to know. But how was he to find
out? Lightfoot kept turning this over and over in his mind as
he traveled through the Green Forest. Then an idea came to him.</p>

<p>"I know what I'll do. I know just what I'll do," said Lightfoot
to himself. "I'll find out whether or not that hunter is still
following me and I'll get a little rest. Goodness knows, I need
a rest."</p>

<p>Lightfoot bounded away swiftly and ran for some distance, then
he turned and quickly, but very, very quietly, returned in the
direction from which he had just come but a little to one side
of his old trail. After a while he saw what he was looking for,
a pile of branches which woodchoppers had left when they had trimmed
the trees they had cut down. This was near the top of a little
hill. Lightfoot went up the hill and stopped behind the pile of
brush. For a few moments he stood there perfectly still, looking
and listening. Then, with a little sigh of relief, he lay down,
where, without being in any danger of being seen himself, he could
watch his old trail through the hollow at the bottom of the hill.
If the hunter were still following him, he would pass through
that hollow in plain sight.</p>

<p>For a long time Lightfoot rested comfortably behind the pile
of brush. There was not a suspicious movement or a suspicious
sound to show that danger was abroad in the Green Forest. He saw
Mr. and Mrs. Grouse fly down across the hollow and disappear among
the trees on the other side. He saw Unc' Billy Possum looking
over a hollow tree and guessed that Unc' Billy was getting ready
to go into winter quarters. He saw Jumper the Hare squat down
under a low-hanging branch of a hemlock-tree and prepare to take
a nap. He heard Drummer the Woodpecker at work drilling after
worms in a tree not far away. Little by little Lightfoot grew
easy in his mind. It must be that that hunter had become discouraged
and was no longer following him.</p>
