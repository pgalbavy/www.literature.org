<p>
Black are the brooding clouds and troubled the deep waters, when
the Sea of Thought,  first heaving from a calm, gives up its
Dead. Monsters uncouth and wild, arise in premature, imperfect
resurrection, the several parts and shapes of different things are
joined and mixed by chance; and when, and how, and by what wonderful
degrees, each separates from each, and every sense and object of the
mind resumes its usual form and lives again, no man -- though
every man is every day the casket of this type of the Great Mystery
-- can tell. 

<p>So, when and how the darkness of the night-black steeple changed to
shining light; when and how the solitary tower was peopled with a
myriad figures; when and how the whispered ``Haunt and hunt
him,'' breathing monotonously through his sleep or swoon, became a
voice exclaiming in the waking ears of Trotty, ``Break his
slumbers;'' when and how he ceased to have a sluggish and confused
idea that such things were, companioning a host of others that were
not; there are no dates or means to tell. But: awake and standing on
his feet upon the boards where he had lately lain: he saw this Goblin
Sight. 

<p>He saw the tower, whither his charmed footsteps had brought him,
swarming with dwarf phantoms,  spirits, elfin creatures of
the Bells. He saw them leaping, flying, dropping, pouring from the
Bells wlthout a pause. He saw them, round him on the ground; above
him, in the air, clambering from him, by the ropes below; looking down
upon him, from the massive iron-girded beams; peeping in upon him, 
through the chinks and loopholes in the walls, spreading away and away
from him in enlarging circles, as the water ripples give way to a huge
stone that suddenly comes plashing in among them. He saw them, of all
aspects and all shapes. He saw them ugly, handsome, crippled,
exquisitely formed. He saw them young, he saw them old, he saw them
kind, he saw them cruel, he saw them merry, he saw them grim; he saw
them dance, and heard them sing; he saw them tear their hair, and
heard them howl. He saw the air thick with them. He saw them come and
go, incessantly. He saw them riding downward, soaring upward, sailing
off afar, perching near at hand, all restless and all violently
active. Stone, and brick, and slate, and tile, became transparent to
him as to them. He saw them <STRONG>in</STRONG> the houses, busy at the
sleepers' beds. He saw them soothing people in their dreams; he saw 
 them beating them with knotted whips; he saw them yelling in
their ears; he saw them playing softest music on their pillows; he saw
them cheering some with the songs of birds and the perfume of flowers;
 he saw them flashing awful faces on the troubled rest of others, from
enchanted mirrors which they carried in their hands. 

<p>He saw these creatures, not only among sleeping men but waking
also, active in pursuits irreconcilable with one another, and
possessing or assuming natures the most opposite. He saw one buckling
on innumerable wings to increase his speed; another loading himself
with chains and weights, to retard his. He saw some putting the hands
of clocks forward, some putting the hands of clocks backward, some
endeavouring to stop the clock entirely. He saw them representing, 
here a marriage ceremony, there a funeral; in this chamber an
election, in that a ball; he saw, everywhere, restless and untiring
motion. 

<p>Bewildered by the host of shifting and extraordinary figures, as
well as by the uproar of the Bells, which all this while were ringing,
Trotty clung to a wooden  pillar for support, and turned his
white face here and there, in mute and stunned astonishment. 

<p>As he gazed, the Chimes stopped. Instantaneous change! The whole
swarm fainted! their forms collapsed, their speed deserted them; they
sought to fly but in the act of falling died and melted into air. No 
fresh supply succeeded them. One straggler leaped down pretty briskly
from the surface of the Great Bell, and alighted on his feet, but he
was dead and gone before he could turn round. Some few of the late
company who had gambolled in the tower, remained there, spinning over
and over a little longer; but these became at every turn more faint,
and few, and feeble, and soon went the way of the rest. The last of
all was one small hunchback, who had got into an echoing corner, where
he twirled and twirled, and floated by himself a long time; showing
such perseverance, that at last he dwindled to a leg and even to a
foot, before he finally returned; but he vanished in the end, and then
the tower was silent. 

<p>Then and not before, did Trotty see in every Bell a bearded figure
of the bulk and stature of the Bell  --
incomprehensibly, a figure and the Bell itself. Gigantic, grave, and
darkly watchful of him, as he stood rooted to the ground. 

<p>Mysterious and awful figures! Resting on nothing; poised in the
night air of the tower, with their draped and hooded heads merged in
the dim roof; motionless and shadowy. Shadowy and dark, although he
saw them by some light belonging to themselves -- none else was
there -- each with its muffled hand upon its goblin mouth. 

<p>He could not plunge down wildly through the opening in the floor;
for all power of motion had deserted him. Otherwise he would have done
so -- aye, would have thrown himself, head-foremost, from the
steeple-top, rather than have seen them watching him with eyes that
would have waked and watched although the pupils had been taken out. 

<p>Again, again, the dread and terror of the lonely place, and of the
wild and fearful night that reigned there, touched him like a spectral
hand. His dlstance from all help; the long, dark, winding,
ghost-beleaguered way that lay between him and the earth on 
which men lived; his being high, high, high, up there, where it had
made him dizzy to see the birds fly in the day; cut off from all good
people, who at such an hour were safe at home and sleeping in their
beds; all this struck coldly through him, not as a reflection but a
bodily sensation. Meantime his eyes and thoughts and fears, were fixed
upon the watchful figures; which, rendered unlike any figures of this 
world by the deep gloom and shade enwrapping and enfolding them, as
well as by their looks and forms and supernatural hovering above the
floor, were nevertheless as plainly to be seen as were the stalwart 
oaken frames, cross-pieces, bars and beams, set up there to support
the Bells. These hemmed them in a very forest of hewn timber; from the
entanglements, intricacies, and depths of which, as from among the 
boughs of a dead wood blighted for their Phantom use, they kept their
darksome and unwinking watch. 

<p>A blast of air -- how cold and shrill! -- came moaning 
through the tower. As it died away, the Great Bell, or the Goblin of
the Great Bell, spoke.  <p>``What visitor is this!'' it
said. The voice was low and deep, and Trotty fancied that it sounded
in the other figures as well. 

<p>``I thought my name was called by the Chimes!'' said Trotty,
raising his hands in an attitude of supplication. ``I hardly know
why I am here, or how I came. I have listened to the Chimes these many
 years. Thev have cheered me often.'' 

<p>``And you have thanked them?'' said the Bell. 

<p>``A thousand times!'' cried Trotty. 

<p>``How?'' 

<p>``I am a poor man,'' faltered Trotty, ``and could only 
thank them in words.'' 

<p>``And always so?'' inquired the Goblin of the Bell. ``Have
you never done us wrong in words?'' 

<p>``No!'' cried Trotty eagerly. 

<p>``Never done us foul, and false, and wicked wrong, in
words?'' pursued the Goblin of the Bell. 

<p>Trotty was about to answer, ``Never!'' But he stopped, and
was confused. 

<p>``The voice of Time,'' said the Phantom, ``cries <pb
n=100> to man, Advance! Time is for his advancement and improvement;
for his greater worth, his greater happiness, his better life; his
progress onward to that goal within its knowledge and its view, and
set there, in the period when Time and He began. Ages of darkness,
wickedness, and violence, have come and gone -- millions
uncountable, have suffered, lived, and died -- to point the way
before him. Who seeks to turn him back, or stay him on his course,
arrests a mighty engine which will strike the meddler dead; and be
the fiercer and the wilder, ever, for its momentary check!'' 

<p>``I never did so to my knowledge, sir,'' said Trotty. ``It
was quite by accident if I did. I wouldn't go to do it, I'm sure.''


<p>``Who puts into the mouth of Time, or of its servants,'' said
the Goblin of the Bell, ``a cry of lamentation for days which have
had their trial and their failure, and have left deep traces of it
which the blind may see -- a cry that only serves the present
time, by showing men how much it needs their help when any ears can
listen to regrets for such a past --  who does this,
does a wrong. And you have done that wrong, to us, the Chimes.'' 

<p>Trotty's first excess of fear was gone. But he had felt tenderly
and gratefully towards the Bells, as you have seen; and when he heard
himself arraigned as one who had offended them so weightily, his heart
 was touched with penitence and grief. 

<p>``If you knew,'' said Trotty, clasping his hands earnestly 
-- ``or perhaps you do know -- if you know how often you
have kept me company; how often you have cheered me up when I've been
low; how you were quite the plaything of my little daughter Meg
(almost the only one she ever had) when first her mother died, and
she and me were left alone -- you won't bear malice for a hasty
word!'' 

<p>``Who hears in us, the Chimes, one note bespeaking disregard, or
stern regard, of any hope, or joy, or pain, or sorrow, of the
many-sorrowed throng; who hears us make response to any creed that
gauges human passions and affections, as it gauges the amount of
miserable food on which humanity may pine and  wither; does
us wrong. That wrong you have done us!'' said the Bell. 

<p>``I have!'' said Trotty. ``Oh forgive me!'' 

<p>``Who hears us echo the dull vermin of the earth: the Putters
Down of crushed and broken natures, formed to be raised up higher than
such maggots of the time can crawl or can conceive,'' pursued the
Goblin of the Bell; ``who does so, does us wrong. And you have
done us wrong!'' 

<p>``Not meaning it,'' said Trotty. ``In my ignorance, not
meaning it!'' 

<p>``Lastly, and most of all,'' pursued the Bell. ``Who turns
his back upon the fallen and disfigured of his kind; abandons them as
Vile; and does not trace and track with pitying eyes the unfenced
precipice by which they fell from Good -- grasping in their fall 
some tufts and shreds of that lost soil, and clinging to them still
when bruised and dying in the gulf below; does wrong to Heaven and
Man, to Time and to Eternity. And you have done that wrong!'' 

<p>``Spare me,'' cried Trotty, falling on his knees; ``for 
Mercy's sake!''  <p>``Listen!'' said the Shadow 

<p>``Listen!'' cried the other Shadows 

<p>``Listen!'' said a clear and childlike voice, which Trotty
thought he recognised as having heard before 

<p>The organ sounded faintly in the church below. Swelling by degrees,
the melody ascended to the roof and filled the choir and nave.
Expanding more and more, it rose up, up; up, up; higher, higher,
higher up; awakening agitated hearts within the burly piles of oak,
the hollow bells, the iron-bound doors, the stairs of solid stone;
until the tower walls were insufficient to contain it, and it soared
into the sky 

<p>No wonder that, an old man's breast could not contain a sound so
vast and mighty. It broke from that weak prison in a rush of tears;
and Trotty put his hands before his face. 

<p>``Listen!'' said the Shadow. 

<p>``Listen!'' said the other Shadows.

<p>``Listen!'' said the child's voice. 

<p>A solemn strain of blended voices, rose into the tower. 
<p>It was a very low and mournful strain : a Dirge : and as he
listened, Trotty heard his child among the singers. 

<p>``She is Dead!'' exclaimed the old man. ``Meg is dead! Her
Spirit calls to me. I hear it!'' 

<p>``The Spirit of your child bewails the dead, and mingles with
the dead -- dead hopes, dead fancies dead imaginings of
youth,'' returned the Bell, ``but she is living. Learn from her
life, a living truth. Learn from the creature dearest to your heart,
how bad the Bad are born. See every bud and leaf plucked one by one
from off the rarest stem, and know how bare and wretched it may be.
Follow her! To Desperation!'' 

<p>Each of the shadowy figures stretched its right arm forth, and
pointed downward. 

<p>``The Spirit of the Chimes is your companion, said the figure.
``Go! It stands behind you!'' 

<p>Trotty turned, and saw -- the child? The child Will Fern had
carried in the street; the child whom Meg had watched, but now,
asleep!  <p>``I carried her myself, to-night,'' said
Trotty. ``In these arms!'' 

<p>``Show him what he calls himself,'' said the dark figures,
one and all. 

<p>The tower opened at his feet. He looked down, and beheld his own
form, lying at the bottom, on the outside: crushed and motionless. 

<p>``No more a living man!'' cried Trotty. ``Dead!'' 

<p>``Dead!'' said the figures all together. 

<p>``Gracious Heaven! And the New Year --'' 

<p>``Past,'' said the figures. 

<p>``What!'' he cried, shuddering. ``I missed my way, and
coming on the outside of this tower in the dark, fell down -- a
year ago?'' 

<p>``Nine years ago!'' replied the figures. 

<p>As they gave the answer, they recalled their outstretched hands;
and where their figures had been, there the Bells were. 

<p>And they rung; their time being come again. And once again, vast
multitudes of phantoms sprung into existence; once again, were
incoherently engaged, as they had been before; once again, faded <pb
n=106> on the stopping of the Chimes; and dwindled into nothing. 

<p>``What are these?'' he asked his guide. ``If I am not mad,
what are these?'' 

<p>``Spirits of the Bells. Their sound upon the air,'' returned
the child. ``They take such shapes and occupations as the hopes and
thoughts of mortals, and the recollections they have stored up, give
them.'' 

<p>``And you,'' said Trotty wildly. ``What are you?'' 

<p>``Hush, hush!'' returned the child. ``Look here!'' 

<p>In a poor, mean room: working at the same kind of embroidery which
he had often, often, seen before her; Meg, his own dear daughter, was
presented to his view. He made no effort to imprint his kisses on her
face; he did not strive to clasp her to his loving heart; he knew that
such endearments were, for him, no more. But, he held his trembling
breath, and brushed away the blinding tears, that he might look upon
her; that he might only see her. 

<p>Ah! Changed. Changed. The light of the clear eye, how dimmed. The
bloom, how faded from the cheek. Beautiful she was, as she had ever
been, but Hope, Hope, Hope, oh where was the fresh Hope that had
spoken to him like a voice! 

<p>She looked up from her work, at a companion. Fol- lowing her eyes,
the old man started back. 

<p>In the woman grown, he recognised her at a glance. In the long
silken hair, he saw the self-same curls; around the lips, the child's
expression lingering still. See! In the eyes, now turned inquiringly
on Meg, there shone the very look that scanned those features when he
brought her home! 

<p>Then what was this, beside him! 

<p>Looking with awe into its face, he saw a something reigning there:
a lofty something, undefined and in- distinct, which made it hardly
more than a remembrance of that child -- as yonder figure might
be -- yet it was the same: the same: and wore the dress. 

<p>Hark. They were speaking! 

<p>``Meg,'' said Lilian, hesitating. ``How often you raise 
your head from your work to look at me!''         . <pb
n=108> <p>``Are my looks so altered, that they frighten you?'' 
asked Meg. 

<p>``Nay, dear! But you smile at that, yourself! Why not smile,
when you look at me, Meg?'' 

<p>``I do so. Do I not?'' she answered: smiling on her. 

<p>``Now you do,'' said Lilian, ``but not usually. When you
think I'm busy, and don't see you, you look so anxious and so
doubtful, that I hardly like to raise my eyes. There is little cause
for smiling in this hard and toilsome life, but you were once so
cheerful.'' 

<p>``Am I not now!'' cried Meg, speaking in a tone of strange
alarm, and rising to embrace her. ``Do <STRONG>I</STRONG> make our
weary life more weary to you, Lilian!'' 

<p>``You have been the only thing that made it life,'' said
Lilian, fervently kissing her; ``sometimes the only thing that made
me care to live so, Meg. Such work, such work! So many hours, so many
days, so many long, long nights of hopeless, cheerless, never-ending 
work -- not to heap up riches, not to live grandly or gaily, not
to live upon enough, however coarse; but  to earn bare
bread: to scrape together just enough to toil upon, and want upon, and
keep alive in us the consciousness of our hard fate! Oh Meg, Meg!''
she raised her voice and twined her arms about her as she spoke, like
one in pain. ``How can the cruel world go round, and bear to look
upon such lives!'' 

<p>``Lilly!'' said Meg, soothing her, and putting back her hair
from her wet face. ``Why Lilly! You! So pretty and so young!'' 

<p>``Oh Meg!'' she interrupted, holding her at arm's-length, and
looking in her face imploringly. ``The worst of all, the worst of
all! Strike me old, Meg! Wither me, and shrivel me, and free me from
the dreadful thoughts that tempt me in my youth!'' 

<p>Trotty turned to look upon his guide. But, the Spirit of the child
had taken flight. Was gone. Neither did he himself remain in the same
place; for, Sir Joseph Bowley, Friend and Father of the Poor, held a
great festivity at Bowley Hall, in honour of the natal day of Lady
Bowley. And as Lady Bowley had been born on New Year's Day (which the
local newspapers considered an especial pointing of the finger of <pb
n=110> Providence to number One, as Lady Bowley's destined figure in
Creation). it was on a New Year's Day that this festivity took place. 

<p>Bowley Hall was full of visitors. The red-faced gentleman was
there, Mr. Filer was there, the great Alderman Cute was there --
Alderman Cute had a sympathetic feeling with great people, and had
considerably improved his acquaintance with Sir Joseph Bowley on the
strength of his attentive letter: indeed had become quite a friend of
the family since then -- and many guests were there. Trotty's
ghost was there, wandering about, poor phantom, drearily; and looking
for its guide. 

<p>There was to be a great dinner in the Great Hall. At which Sir
Joseph Bowley, in his celebrated character of Friend and Father, of
the Poor, was to make his great speech. Certain plum-puddings were to
be eaten by his Friends and Children in another Hall first; and, at a
given signal, Friends and Children flocking in among their Friends and
Fathers, were to form a family assemblage, with not one manly eye 
therein unmoistened by emotion.  <p>But, there was more than
this to happen. Even more than this. Sir Joseph Bowley, Baronet and 
Member of Parliament, was to play a match at skittles -- real
skittles -- with his tenants! 

<p>``Which quite reminds me,'' said Alderman Cute, ``of the
days of old King Hal, stout King Hal, bluff King Hal. Ah. Fine
character!'' 

<p>``Very,'' said Mr. Filer, dryly. ``For marrying women and
murdering 'em. Considerably more than the average number of wives by
the bye.'' 

<p>``You'll marry the beautiful ladies, and not murder 'em,
eh?'' said Alderman Cute to the heir of Bowley, aged twelve.
``Sweet boy! We shall have this little gentleman in Parliament
now,'' said the Alderman, holding him by the shoulders, and looking
as reflective as he could, ``before we know where we are. We shall
hear of his successes at the poll; his speeches in the House; his
overtures from Governments; his brilliant achievements of all kinds;
ah! we shall make our little orations about him in the Common Council,
 I'll be bound; before we have time to look about us!'' 

<p>``Oh, the difference of shoes and stockings!'' 
Trotty thought. But his heart yearned towards the child, for the love
of those same shoeless and stockingless boys, predestined (by the
Alderman) to turn out bad, who might have been the children of poor
Meg. 

<p>``Richard,'' moaned Trotty, roaming among the company, to and
fro; ``where is he? I can't find Richard! Where is Richard?'' 

<p>Not likely to be there, if still alive! But Trotty's grief and
solitude confused him; and he still went wandering among the gallant
company, looking for his guide, and saying, ``Where is Richard?
Show me Richard!'' 

<p>He was wandering thus, when he encountered Mr. Fish, the
confidential Secretary: in great agitation. 

<p>``Bless my heart and soul!'' cried Mr. Fish. ``Where's 
Alderman Cute? Has anybody seen the Alderman?'' 

<p>Seen the Alderman? Oh dear! Who could ever help seeing the
Alderman? He was so considerate, so affable, he bore so much in mind
the natural desires of folks to see him, that if he had a fault, it
was the being constantly On View. And  wherever the great 
people were, there, to be sure, attracted by the kindred sympathy
between great souls, was Cute. 

<p>Several voices cried that he was in the circle round Sir Joseph.
Mr. Fish made way there; found him; and took him secretly into a
window near at hand. Trotty joined them. Not of his own accord. He 
felt that his steps were led in that direction. 

<p>``My dear Alderman Cute,'' said Mr. Fish. ``A little more
this way. The most dreadful circumstance has occurred. I have this
moment received the intelligence. I think it will be best not to
acquaint Sir Joseph with it till the day is over. You understand Sir
Joseph, and will give me your opinion. The most frightful and
deplorable event!'' 

<p>``Fish!'' returned the Alderman. ``Fish! My good fellow
what is the matter? Nothing revolutionary, I hope! No -- no
attempted interference with the magistrates?'' 

<p>``Deedles, the banker,'' gasped the Secretary. ``Deedles
Brothers -- who was to have been here to-day -- high in
office in the Goldsmiths' Company --'' 

<p>``Not stopped!'' exclaimed the Alderman. ``It can't 
be!''  <p>``Shot himself!'' 

<p>``Good God!'' 

<p>``Put a double-barrelled pistol to his mouth, in his own
counting-house,'' said Mr. Fish, ``and blew his brains out. No
motive. Princely circumstances!'' 

<p>``Circumstances!'' exclaimed the Alderman. ``A man of
noble fortune. One of the most respectable of men. Suicide, Mr. Fish!
By his own hand!'' 

<p>``This very morning,'' returned Mr. Fish. 

<p>``Oh the brain, the brain!'' exclaimed the pious Alderman, 
lifting up his hands. ``Oh the nerves, the nerves; the mysteries of
this machine called Man! Oh the little that unhinges it: poor
creatures that we are! Perhaps a dinner, Mr. Fish. Perhaps the conduct
 of his son, who, I have heard, ran very wild, and was in the habit of
drawing bills upon him without the least authority! A most respectable
man. One of the most respectable men I ever knew! A lamentable 
instance, Mr. Fish. A public calamity! I shall make a point of wearing
the deepest mourning. A most respectable man! But there is One above.
We must submit, Mr. Fish. We must submit!''  <p>What,
Alderman! No word of Putting Down? Remember, Justice, your high moral
boast and pride. Come, Alderman! Balance those scales. Throw me into
this, the empty one, No Dinner, and Nature's Founts in some poor
woman, dried by starving misery and rendered obdurate to claims for
which her offspring <STRONG>has</STRONG> authority in holy mother Eve.
Weigh me the two, you Daniel, going to judgement, when your day shall
come! Weigh them, in the eyes of suffering thousands, audience (not
unmindful) of the grim farce you play. Or supposing that you strayed
from your five wits -- it's not so far to go, but that it might 
be -- and laid hands upon that throat of yours, warning your
fellows (if you have a fellow) how they croak their comfortable
wickedness to raving heads and stricken hearts. What then? 

<p>The words rose up in Trotty's breast, as if they had been spoken by
some other voice within him. Alderman Cute pledged himself to Mr. Fish
that he would assist him in breaking the melancholy catastrophe to 
Sir Joseph when the day was over. Then, before they parted, wringing
Mr. Fish's hand in  bitterness of soul, he said, ``The
most respectable of men!'' And added that he hardly knew : not even
he: why such afflictions were allowed on earth. 

<p>``It's almost enough to make one think, if one didn't know
better,'' said Alderman Cute, ``that at times some motion of a
capsizing nature was going on in things, which affected the general
economy of the social fabric. Deedles Brothers!'' 

<p>The skittle-playing came off which immense success. Sir Joseph
knocked the pins about quite skilfully; Master Bowley took an innings
at a shorter distance also; and everybody said that now, when a 
Baronet and the Son of a Baronet played at skittles, the country was
coming round again, as fast as it could come. 

<p>At its proper time, the Banquet was served up. Trotty involuntarily
repaired to the Hall with the rest, for he felt himself conducted
thither by some stronger impulse than his own free will. The sight 
was gay in the extreme; the ladies were very handsome; the visitors
delighted, cheerful, and good-tempered. When the lower doors were
opened, and the people flockcd in, in their rustic dresses, the <pb
n=117> beauty of the spectacle was at its height; but Trotty only 
murmured more and more, ``Where is Richard! He should help and
comfort her! I can't see Richard!'' 

<p>There had been some speeches made; and Lady Bowley's health had
been proposed; and Sir Joseph Bowley had returned thanks, and had made
his great speech, showing by various pieces of evidence that he was
the born Friend and Father, and so forth; and had given as a Toast,
his Friends and Children, and the Dignity of Labour; when a slight
disturbance at the bottom of the Hall attracted Toby's notice. After 
some confusion, noise, and opposition, one man broke through the rest,
and stood forward by himself. 

<p>Not Richard. No. But one whom he had thought of, and had looked
for, many times. In a scantier supply of light, he might have doubted
the identity of that worn man, so old, and grey, and bent; but with a
blaze of lamps upon his gnarled and knotted head, he knew Will Fern as
soon as he stepped forth. 

<p>``What is this!'' exclaimed Sir Joseph, rising. ``Who gave
this man admittance? This is a criminal  from prison! Mr.
Fish, sir, <STRONG>will</STRONG> you have the goodness --'' 

<p>``A minute!'' said Will Fern. ``A minute! My Lady, you was
born on this day along with a New Year. Get me a minute's leave to
speak.'' 

<p>She made some intercession for him. Sir Joseph took his seat again,
with native dignity. 

<p>The ragged visitor -- for he was miserably dressed --
looked round upon the company, and made his homage to them with a
humble bow 

<p>``Gentlefolks!'' he said. ``You've drunk the Labourer. 
Look at me!'' 

<p>``Just come from jail,'' said Mr. Fish. 

<p>``Just come from jail,'' said Will. ``And neither for the
first time, nor the second, nor the third, nor yet the fourth.'' 

<p>Mr. Filer was heard to remark testily, that four times was over the
average; and he ought to be ashamed of himself. 

<p>``Gentlefolks!'' repeated Will Fern. ``Look at me! You see
I'm at the worst. Beyond all hurt or harm; beyond your help; for the
time when your  kind words or kind actions could have done
<emph rend=sc>me</STRONG> good,'' -- he struck his hand upon his
breast, and shook his head, ``is gone, with the scent of last
year's beans or clover on the air. Let me say a word for these,''
pointing to the labouring people in the Hall; ``and when you're met
 together, hear the real Truth spoke out for once.'' 

<p>``There's not a man here,'' said the host, ``who would 
have him for a spokesman.'' 

<p>``Like enough, Sir Joseph. I believe it. Not the less true,
perhaps, is what I say. Perhaps that's a proof on it. Gentlefolks,
I've lived many a year in this place. You may see the cottage from the
sunk fence over yonder. I've seen the ladies draw it in their books,
a hundred times. It looks well in a picter, I've heerd say; but there
an't weather in picters, and maybe 'tis fitter for that, than for a
place to live in. Well! I lived there. How hard -- how bitter 
hard, I lived there, I won't say. Any day in the year, and every day,
you can judge for your own selves.'' 

<p>He spoke as he had spoken on the night when  <illus>
Trotty found him in the street. His voice was deeper and more husky,
and had a trembling in it now and then; but he never raised it
passionately, and seldom lifted it above the firm stern level of the
homely facts he stated. 

<p>``'Tis harder than you think for, gentlefolks, to grow up
decent: commonly decent: in such a place. That I growed up a man and
 not a brute, says something for me -- as I was then.
As I am now, there's nothing can be said for me or done for me. I'm 
past it.'' 

<p>``I am glad this man has entered,'' observed Sir Joseph,
looking round serenely. ``Don't disturb him. It appears to be
Ordained. He is an Example: a living example. I hope and trust, and
confidently expect, that it will not be lost upon my Friends
here.'' 

<p>``I dragged on,'' said Fern, after a moment's silence, 
``somehow. Neither me nor any other man knows how; but so heavy,
that I couldn't put a cheerful face upon it, or make believe that I
was anything but what I was. Now, gentlemen -- you gentlemen that
sits at Sessions -- when you see a man with discontent writ on
his face, you says to one another, &onq;He's suspicious. I has my
doubts,&cnq; says you, &onq;about Will Fern Watch that fellow!&cnq; I
don't say, gentlemen, it an't quite nat'ral, but I say 'tis so; and
from that hour, whatever Will Fern does, or lets alone -- all one
-- it goes against him.'' 

<p>Alderman Cute stuck his thumbs in his waistcoat  pockets, 
and leaning back in his chair, and smiling winked at a neighbouring
chandelier. As much as to say, ``Of course! I told you so. The
common cry! Lord bless you, we are up to all this sort of thing
-- myself and human nature.'' 

<p>``Now, gentlemen,'' said Will Fern, holding out his hands,
and flushing for an instant in his haggard face, ``see how your
laws are made to trap and hunt us when we're brought to this. I tries
to live elsewhere. And I'm a vagabond. To jail with him! I comes back
here. I goes a-nutting in your woods, and breaks -- who don't?
-- a limber branch or two. To jail with him! One of your keepers
sees me in the broad day, near my own patch of garden, with a gun. To
jail with him! I has a nat'ral angry word with that man, when I'm
free again! To jail with him! I cuts a stick. To jail with him! I eats
a rotten apple or a turnip. To jail with him! It's twenty mile away; 
and coming back I begs a trifle on the road. To jail with him! At
last, the constable, the keeper -- anybody -- finds me
anywhere, a-doing anything. To jail with him, for he's a vagrant, <pb
n=123> and a jail-bird known; and the jail's the only home he's
got.'' 

<p>The Alderman nodded sagaciously, as who should say, ``A very
good home too!'' 

<p>``Do I say this to serve <emph rend=sc>my</STRONG> cause!''
cried Fcrn. ``Who can give me back my liberty, who can give me 
back my good name, who can give me back my innocent niece? Not all the
Lords and Ladies in wide England. But gentlemen, gentlemen, dealing
with other men like me, begin at the right end. Give us, in mercy,
better homes when we're a-lying in our cradles; give us better food
when we're a-working for our lives; give us kinder laws to bring us
back where we're a-going wrong; and don't set Jail, Jail, Jail, afore
us, everywhere we turn. There an't a condescension you can show the
Labourer then, that he won't take, as ready and as grateful as a man
can be; for, he has a patient, peaceful, willing heart. But you must
put his rightful spirit in him first; for, whether he's a wreck and
ruin such as me, or is like one of them that stand here now, his
spirit is divided from you at this time. Bring it back,
gentlefolks, bring it back! Bring it back, afore the day comes when
even his Bible changes in his altered mind, and the words seem to him
to read, as they have sometimes read in my own eyes -- in Jail:
&onq;Whither thou goest, I can Not go; where thou lodgest, I do Not 
lodge; thy people are Not my people; Nor thy God my God!&cnq;'' 

<p>A sudden stir and agitation took place in the Hall. Trotty though
at first, that several had risen to eject the man; and hence this
change in its appearance. But, another moment showed him that the room
and all the company had vanished from his sight, and that his
daughter was again before him, seated at her work. But in a poorer,
meaner garret than before; and with no Lilian by her side. 

<p>The frame at which she had worked, was put away upon a shelf and
covered up. The chair in which she had sat, was turned against the
wall. A history was written in these little things, and in Meg's
grief-worn face. Oh! who could fail to read it! 

<p>Meg strained her eyes upon her work until it was  <illus>
too dark to see the threads; and when the night closed in, she lighted
her feeble candle and worked on. Still her old father was invisible
about her;  looking down upon her; loving her -- how
dearly loving her! -- and talking to her in a tender voice about
the old times, and the Bells. Though he knew, poor Trotty, though he
knew she could not hear him. 

<p>A great part of the evening had worn away, when a knock came at her
door. She opened it. A man was on the threshold. A slouching, moody,
drunken sloven, wasted by intemperance and vice, and with his matted
hair and unshorn beard in wild disorder; but, with some traces on him,
too, of having been a man of good proportion and good features in his
youth. 

<p>He stopped until he had her leave to enter; and she, retiring a
pace or two from the open door, silently and sorrowfully looked upon
him. Trotty had his wish. He saw Richard. 

<p>``May I come in, Margaret?'' 

<p>``Yes! Come in. Come in!'' 

<p>It was well that Trotty knew him before he spoke; for with any
doubt remaining on his mind, the harsh discordant voice would have
persuaded him that it was not Richard but some other man. 

<p>There were but two chairs in the room. She gave  him
hers, and stood at some short distance from him, waiting to hear what
he had to say. 

<p>He sat, however, staring vacantly at the floor; with a lustreless
and stupid smile. A spectacle of such deep degradation, of such abject
hopelessness, of such a miserable downfall, that she put her hands
before her face and turned away, lest he should see how much it moved
her.         . 

<p>Roused by the rustling of her dress, or some such trifling sound,
he lifted his head, and began to speak as if there had been no pause
since he entered. 

<p>``Still at work, Margaret? You work late.'' 

<p>``I generally do.'' 

<p>``And early?'' 

<p>``And early.'' 

<p>``So she said. She said you never tired; or never owned that you
tired. Not all the time you lived together. Not even when you fainted,
between work and fasting. But I told you that, the last time I 
came.'' 

<p>``You did,'' she answered. ``And I implored you to tell me
nothing more; and you made me a solemn promise, Richard, that you
never would.''  <p>``A solemn promise,'' he
repeated, with a drivelling laugh and vacant stare. ``A solemn
promise. To be sure. A solemn promise!'' Awakening, as it were, 
after a time; in the same manner as before; he said with sudden
animation: 

<p>``How can I help it, Margaret? What am I to do? She has been to
me again!'' 

<p>``Again!'' cried Meg, clasping her hands. ``0, does she
think of me so often! Has she been again!'' 

<p>``Twenty times again,'' said Richard. ``Margaret, she 
haunts me. She comes behind me in the street, and thrusts it in my
hand. I hear her foot upon the ashes when I'm at my work (ha, ha! that
an't often), and before I can turn my head, her voice is in my ear, 
saying, &onq;Richard, don't look round. For Heaven's love, give her
this!&cnq; She brings it where I live; she sends it in letters; she
taps at the window and lays it on the sill. What can I do? Look at
it!'' 

<p>He held out in his hand a little purse, and chinked the money it
enclosed. 

<p>``Hide it,'' said Meg. ``Hide it! When she comes again,
tell her, Richard, that I love her in my soul.  That I never
lie down to sleep, but I bless her, and pray for her. That, in my
solitary work, I never cease to have her in my thoughts. That she is
with me, night and day. That if I died to-morrow, I would remember
her with my last breath. But, that I cannot look upon it!'' 

<p>He slowly recalled his hand, and crushing the purse together, said
with a kind of drowsy thoughtfulness: 

<p>``I told her so. I told her so, as plain as words could speak.
I've taken this gift back and left it at her door, a dozen times since
then. But when she came at last, and stood before me, face to face,
what could I do?'' 

<p>``You saw her!'' exclaimed Meg. ``You saw her! Oh Lilian,
my sweet girl! Oh, Lilian, Lilian!'' 

<p>``I saw her,'' he went on to say, not answering, but engaged
in the same slow pursuit of his own thoughts. ``There she stood:
trembling! &onq;How does she look, Richard? Does she ever speak of me?
Is she thinner? My old place at the table: what's in my old place?
And the frame she taught me our  old work on -- has she
burnt it, Richard!&cnq; There she was. I heard her say it.'' 

<p>Meg checked her sobs, and with the tears streaming from her eyes,
bent over him to listen. Not to lose a breath. 

<p>With his arms resting on his knees; and stooping forward in his
chair, as if what he said were written on the ground in some half
legible character, which it was his occupation to decipher and
connect; he went on. 

<p>`` &onq;Richard, I have fallen very low; and you may guess how
much I have suffered in having this sent back, when I can bear to
bring it in my hand to you. But you loved her once, even in my memory,
dearly. Others stepped in between you; fears, and jealousies, and
doubts, and vanities, estranged you from her; but you did love her,
even in my memory!&cnq; I suppose I did,'' he said, interrupting
himself for a moment. ``I did! That's neither here nor there.
&onq;O Richard, if you ever did: if you have any memory for what is 
gone and lost, take it to her once more. Once more! Tell her how I
begged and prayed.  Tell her how I laid my head upon your
shoulder, where her own head might have lain, and was so humble to
you, Richard. Tell her that you looked into my face, and saw the
beauty which she used to praise, all gone: all gone: and in its place,
a poor, wan, hollow cheek, that she would weep to see. Tell her 
everything, and take it back and she will not refuse again. She will
not have the heart!&cnq;'' 

<p>So he sat musing, and repeating the last words, until he woke
again, and rose. 

<p>``You won't take it, Margaret?'' 

<p>She shook her head, and motioned an entreaty to him to leave her. 

<p>``Good-night, Margaret.'' 

<p>``Good-night!'' 

<p>He turned to look upon her; struck by her sorrow, and perhaps by
the pity for himself which trembled in her voice. It was a quick and
rapid action; and for the moment some flash of his old bearing kindled
 in his form. In the next he went as he had come. Nor did this glimmer
of a quenched fire seem to light him to a quicker sense of his
debasement.  <p>In any mood, in any grief, in any torture of
the mind or body, Meg's work must be done. She sat down to her task,
and plied it. Night, midnight. Still she worked. 

<p>She had a meagre fire, the night being very cold; and rose at
intervals to mend it. The Chimes rang half-past twelve while she was
thus engaged; and when they ceased she heard a gentle knocking at the 
door. Before she could so much as wonder who was there, at that
unusual hour, it opened. 

<p>Oh Youth and Beauty, happy as ye should be, look at this! Oh Youth
and Beauty, blest and blessing all within your reach, and working out
the ends of your Beneficent Creator, look at this! 

<p>She saw the entering figure; screamed its name; cried
``Lilian!'' 

<p>It was swift, and fell upon its knees before her: clinging to her
dress. 

<p>``Up, dear! Up! Lilian! My own dearest!'' 

<p>``Never more, Meg; never more! Here! Here! Close to you, holding
to you, feeling your dear breath upon my face! '' 
<p>``Sweet Lilian! Darling Lilian! Child of my heart -- no
mother's love can be more tender -- lay your head upon my
breast!'' 

<p>``Never more, Meg. Never more! When I first looked into your
face, you knelt before me. On my knees before you, let me die. Let it
be here!'' 

<p>``You have come back. My Treasure! We will live together, work
together, hope together, die together!'' 

<p>``Ah! Kiss my lips, Meg; fold your arms about me; press me to
your bosom; look kindly on me; but don't raise me. Let it be here. Let
me see the last of your dear face upon my knees!'' 

<p>Oh Youth and Beauty, happy as ye should be, look at this! Oh Youth
and Beauty, working out the ends of your Beneficent Creator, look at
this! 

<p>``Forgive me, Meg! So dear, so dear! Forgivo me! I know you do,
I see you do, but say so, Meg!'' 

<p>She said so, with her lips on Lilian's cheek. And with her arms
twined round -- she knew it now -- a broken heart. 

<p>``His blessing on you, dearest love. Kiss me  once 
more! He suffered her to sit beside His feet, and dry them with her
hair. O Meg, what Mercy and Compassion!'' 

<p>As she died, the Spirit of the child returning, innocent and
radiant, touched the old man with its hand, and beckoned him away.
