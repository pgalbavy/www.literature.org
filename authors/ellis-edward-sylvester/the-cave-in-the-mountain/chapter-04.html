<p>By clinging to the tail of the terrified wolf, Fred Munson had
been assisted, dragged, and pulled from the Cimmerian gloom of
the mountain cave into the glorious sunlight again. When the glare
of light burst upon him, he let go of the queer aid to freedom,
and the mystified animal skurried away with increased speed.</p>

<p>For a time the lad was so dazed and bewildered that he scarcely
comprehended his good fortune. His eyes had been totally unaccustomed
to light for so long a time that the retina was overpowered by
the sudden flood of it and required time to accommodate itself
to the new order of things. A few minutes were sufficient. And
then, when he looked about and saw that he was indeed outside
of the cave which had been such an appalling prison to him, Fred
was fairly wild with joy.</p>

<p>It was all he could do to restrain himself from shouting, whooping
and hurrahing at the top of his voice. It was only the recollection
that there were a number of Apaches near at hand that sufficed
to keep his voice toned down. But he danced and swung his arms,
and threw himself here and there in a way that would have made
a spectator certain that he was hilariously crazy. Not until he
was thoroughly used up did he consent to pause and take a breathing
spell. Then he gasped out, as well as he could, during his hurried
breathing:</p>

<p>"Thank the good Lord! I knew He would not forget me. He let me
hunt around for a while, long enough to make me feel I couldn't
do anything, and then He stepped in. The wolf came. I didn't think
I could make anything out of him, but I grabbed his tail. I held
on and here I am. Thank the good Lord again."</p>

<p>When able to control himself still further, Fred made a survey
of his surroundings. In the first place, he observed that the
forenoon was only fairly under way, the sun having risen just
high enough to be visible. The sky was clear of clouds and the
day promised to be a beautiful one, without being oppressively
warm.</p>

<p>"It is strange that I could not find the opening when the wolf
scampered straight to it."</p>

<p>However, he did not stop to puzzle over the matter. It was sufficient
to know and feel that he was back again in the busy, bustling
world, saved from being buried in a living tomb.</p>

<p>An examination of the point where he had debouched from these
Plutonian regions showed Fred that he was considerably below the
general regions of the earth. He was in a sort of valley, surrounded
by rocks and boulders, and the opening through which he had scrambled
was situated sidewise, so that at a distance of ten feet it could
not be seen. This accounted for the fact that none of the Indians
knew any other means of ingress and egress excepting the opening
in the roof of the cave. It was almost impossible to discover,
except by accident or long continued and systematic search.</p>

<p>Fred's next thought was regarding Mickey O'Rooney, and he questioned
himself as to the best means of reaching him, and assisting him
to the same remarkably good fortune which had attended himself.
The immediate suggestion, naturally, was to re-enter the cave
and, after hunting up his old friend, conduct Mickey to the outer
world, but it required only brief deliberation to convince him
of the utter folly of such an attempt. In the first place, should
he re-enter the cave, he would be lost again, not knowing in what
direction to turn to find his friend and entirely unable to communicate
with him by signal, as had been their custom when separated and
looking for each other. Should he venture away from the tunnel
to renew his search, it was scarcely possible that he could find
his way back again. He would not only lose Mickey, but he would
lose himself, with not the remotest chance of finding his way
into the outer world again. So it was clearly apparent that, having
been delivered from prison, it would not do for him to go back
under any circumstances. He must remain where he was, and whatever
assistance he could render his friend, must be given from the
outside. How was this to be done?</p>

<p>To begin with, he felt the necessity of getting out of the circumscribing
valley and of taking his bearings. He wished to learn where the
opening through which he had fallen was situated. It was no difficult
matter to work his way upward until he found himself up on a level
with the main plateau. There, his view, although broken and interrupted
in many directions, was quite extended in others, and his eye
roamed over a large extent of that broken section of the country.
He was utterly unable to recognize anything he saw, but he was
confident that he was no great distance from the spot for which
he was searching. It was only through the entrance that he could
hold communication with Mickey, whenever the way should be left
clear for him to do so. But he was fully mindful of the necessity
for caution in every movement.</p>

<p>It was not to be supposed that the Apaches, having struck what
might be called a gold-mine, intended to abandon it at the very
time the richest of results were promised. And so, after long
deliberation, the boy decided upon the direction in which the
opening lay, and he made toward a small peak from which, in case
his calculations were correct, he knew he would see it. Strange
to say, his reckoning was correct in this instance; and when he
stealthily made his way to the elevation and looked down over
the slope, he saw the clump of bushes covering the "skylight,"
not more than a hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>He saw something else, which was not quite so pleasant. Six Apache
warriors were guarding the same entrance.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they think Mickey expects to make a jump up through
there!" was the thought which came to Fred, as he peered down
upon the savages, and counted them over several times. "I don't
see what they are to gain by waiting there, unless they mean to
go down pretty soon."</p>

<p>He could not be too careful in the vicinity of such characters,
and, stretching out flat upon his face, he peeped over the top,
taking the precaution first to remove his cap, and then to permit
no more of his head than was indispensable to appear above the
surface. The six redskins were lounging in as many different lazy
attitudes. One seemed sound asleep, with his face turned to the
ground, and looking like a warrior that had fallen from some balloon,
and, striking on his stomach, lay just as he was flattened out.
Another was half-sitting and half-reclining, smoking a pipe with
a very long stem. His face was directly toward Fred, who noticed
that his eyes were cast downward, as though he were gazing into
the bowl of his pipe, while Fred could plainly see the ugly lips,
as they parted at intervals and emitted their pulls in a fashion
as indolent as that of some wealthy Turk. A third was seated a
little further off, examining his rifle, which he had probably
injured in some way, and which occupied his attention to the exclusion
of everything else.</p>

<p>The bushes surrounding the opening had been torn away, although
it was difficult to conceive what the Indians expected to accomplish
by such an act, as it only served to make them plainer targets
to the Irishman, whenever he chose to crack away from below.</p>

<p>The remaining trio of Apaches were occupied in some way with
the cavern. They were stretched out upon the ground, with their
heads close to the orifice, down which they seemed to be peering,
and doing something, the nature of which the lad could not even
guess.</p>

<p>"That don't look as though they had caught Mickey," he muttered,
with a feeling of inexpressible relief; "for, if they had, they
wouldn't be loafing around there."</p>

<p>Nothing of their horses could be seen, although he knew they
must have a number of them somewhere in the neighborhood. An Apache
or Comanche without his mustang would be like a soldier in battle
without weapons.</p>

<p>"I'd like to find them," thought Fred, lowering his head, and
looking back of him. "I'd take one and start all the others away,
and then there would be fun."</p>

<p>The lad had it in his power to take an important step toward
his return to his friends. Nothing was more likely than that a
little search through the immediate neighborhood would discover
the mustangs of his enemies, which, as a matter of course, were
unguarded, the owners anticipating no trouble from any such source.
Mounted upon the fleetest of prairie rangers, it would not require
long to reach the open country, when he could speed away homeward.</p>

<p>But to do this required the abandonment of his friend, Mickey
O'Rooney, who would not have been within the cavern at that minute
but for his efforts to rescue him from the same prison. It was
hard to tell in what way the lad expected to benefit him by staying,
and yet nothing would have persuaded him to do otherwise.</p>

<p>"I may get a chance to do something for him, and if I should
be gone and never see him again, I should blame myself forever.
So I'll wait here and watch."</p>

<p>The three redskins on the edge of the opening remained occupied
with something, but the curiosity of the lad continued unsatisfied
until one of them raised up and moved backward several steps.
Then Fred saw that he had a lasso in his hand, and was drawing
it up from the cave. He pulled it up with one hand, while he caught
and looped it with the other, until he had nearly a score of the
coils in his grasp. This could not have been the cord which held
the blanket when the shot of Mickey O'Rooney cut it and let the
bundle drop, for that was much smaller, while this was sufficient
to bear a weight of several hundred pounds, it having been used
to lasso the fleet-footed and powerful mustangs of the prairies.</p>

<p>"They've been fishing with it," concluded the youngster; "but
I don't believe that Mickey would bite. What are they going to
do now?"</p>

<p>After drawing up the rope, the whole half dozen Apaches seemed
to become very attentive. They gathered in a group and began discussing
matters in their earnest fashion, gesticulating and grunting so
loud that Fred distinctly heard them from where he lay. This discussion,
however, speedily resulted in action.</p>

<p>Another of the blankets already described was very artistically
doubled and folded into the resemblance of a man, and then the
lasso was attached to it. The Apaches experimented with it for
several minutes before putting it to the test, but at last everything
was satisfactory, and it was launched. The aborigines seemed to
comprehend what the trouble was with the other, and they avoided
repeating the error.</p>

<p>When they began cautiously lowering the bundle, the six gathered
as close to the margin as was prudent to await the result. Their
interest was intense, for they had mapped out their programme,
and much depended upon the result of this venture. But among the
half dozen there was no one who was more nervously interested
than Fred Munson, who felt that the fate of Mickey O'Rooney was
trembling in the balance.</p>
