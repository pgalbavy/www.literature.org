<p>At a little after six o'clock on the evening of Saturday, 12th
October, in the year 1678, the man known commonly as Edward Copshaw
came to a halt opposite the narrow entry of the Savoy, just west
of the Queen's palace of Somerset House. He was a personage of
many names. In the register of the Benedictine lay-brothers he
had been entered as James Singleton. Sundry Paris tradesmen had
known him as Captain Edwards, and at the moment were longing to
know more of him. In a certain secret and tortuous correspondence
he figured as Octavius, and you may still read his sprawling script
in the Record Office. His true name, which was Nicholas Lovel,
was known at Weld House, at the White Horse Tavern, and the town
lodgings of my lords Powis and Bellasis, but had you asked for
him by that name at these quarters you would have been met by
a denial of all knowledge. For it was a name which for good reasons
he and his patrons desired to have forgotten.</p>

<p>He was a man of not yet forty, furtive, ill-looking and lean
to emaciation. In complexion he was as swarthy as the King, and
his feverish black eyes were set deep under his bushy brows. A
badly dressed peruke concealed his hair. His clothes were the
remnants of old finery, well cut and of good stuff, but patched
and threadbare. He wore a sword, and carried a stout rustic staff.
The weather was warm for October, and the man had been walking
fast, for, as he peered through the autumn brume into the dark
entry, he mopped his face with a dirty handkerchief.</p>

<p>The exercise had brought back his ailment and he shivered violently.
Punctually as autumn came round he had these fevers, the legacy
of a year once spent in the Pisan marshes. He had doped himself
with Jesuits' powder got from a woman of Madame Carwell's, so
that he was half deaf and blind. Yet in spite of the drug the
fever went on burning.</p>

<p>But to anyone looking close it would have seemed that he had
more to trouble him than a malarial bout. The man was patently
in an extreme terror. His lantern-jaw hung as loose as if it had
been broken. His lips moved incessantly. He gripped savagely at
his staff, and next moment dropped it. He fussed with the hilt
of his sword.... He was a coward, and yet had come out to do murder.</p>

<p>It had taken real panic to bring him to the point. Throughout
his tattered life he had run many risks, but never a peril so
instant as this. As he had followed his quarry that afternoon
his mind had been full of broken memories. Bitter thoughts they
were, for luck had not been kind to him. A childhood in cheap
lodgings in London and a dozen French towns, wherever there was
a gaming-table and pigeons for his father to pluck. Then drunken
father and draggletailed mother had faded from the scene, and
the boy had been left to a life of odd jobs and fleeting patrons.
His name was against him, for long before he reached manhood the
King had come back to his own, and his grandfather's bones had
jangled on a Tyburn gibbet. There was no hope for one of his family,
though Heaven knew his father had been a stout enough Royalist.
At eighteen the boy had joined the Roman Church, and at twenty
relapsed to the fold of Canterbury. But his bread-and-butter lay
with Rome, and in his trade few questions were asked about creed
provided the work were done. He had had streaks of fortune, for
there had been times when he lay soft and ate delicately and scattered
money. But nothing lasted. He had no sooner made purchase with
a great man and climbed a little than the scaffolding fell from
his feet. He thought meanly of human nature for in his profess
he must cringe or snarl, always the undermost dog. Yet he had
some liking for the priests, who had been kind to him, and there
was always a glow in his heart for the pale wife who dwelt with
his child in the attic in Billingsgate. Under happier circumstances
Mr. Nicholas Lovel might have shone with the domestic virtues.</p>

<p>Business had been good of late, if that could ever be called
good which was undertaken under perpetual fear. He had been given
orders which took him into Whig circles, and had made progress
among the group of the King's Head Tavern. He had even won an
entrance into my Lord Shaftesbury's great house in Aldersgate
Street. He was there under false colours, being a spy of the other
camp, but something in him found itself at home among the patriots.
A resolve had been growing to cut loose from his old employers
and settle down among the Whigs in comparative honesty. It was
the winning cause, he thought, and he longed to get his head out
of the kennels.... But that had happened yesterday which scattered
his fine dreams and brought him face to face with terror. God's
curse on that ferrety Justice, Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey.</p>

<p>He had for some time had his eye on the man. The year before
he had run across him in Montpelier, being then engaged in a very
crooked business, and had fancied that the magistrate had also
his eye on him. Taught by long experience to watch potential enemies,
he had taken some trouble over the lean high-beaked dignitary.
Presently he had found out curious things. The austere Protestant
was a friend of the Duke's man, Ned Coleman, and used to meet
him at Colonel Weldon's house. This hinted at blackmailable stuff
in the magistrate, so Lovel took to haunting his premises in Hartshorn
Lane by Charing Cross, but found no evidence which pointed to
anything but a prosperous trade in wood and sea-coal. Faggots,
but not the treasonable kind! Try as he might, he could-get no
farther with that pillar of the magistracy, my Lord Danly's friend,
the beloved of Aldermen. He hated his solemn face, his prim mouth,
his condescending stoop. Such a man was encased in proof armour
of public esteem, and he heeded Mr. Lovel no more than the rats
in the gutter.</p>

<p>But the day before had come a rude awakening. All this talk of
a Popish plot, discovered by the Salamanca Doctor, promised a
good harvest to Mr. Lovel. He himself had much to tell and more
to invent. Could he but manage it discreetly, he might assure
his fortune with the Whigs and get to his feet at last. God knew
it was time, for the household in the Billingsgate attic was pretty
threadbare. His busy brain had worked happily on the plan. He
would be the innocent, cursed from childhood with undesired companions,
who would suddenly awaken in horror to the guilt of things he
had not understood. There would be a welcome for a well-informed
penitent.... But he must move slowly and at his own time.... And
now he was being himself hustled into the dock, perhaps soon to
the gallows.</p>

<p>For the afternoon before he had been sent for by Godfrey and
most searchingly examined. He had thought himself the spy, when
all the while he had been the spied upon. The accursed Justice
knew everything. He knew a dozen episodes each enough to hang
a poor man. He knew of Mr. Lovel's dealings with the Jesuits Walsh
and Phayre, and of a certain little hovel in Battersea whose annals
were not for the public ear. Above all, he knew of the great Jesuit
consult in April at the Duke of York's house. That would have
mattered little&mdash;indeed the revelation of it was part of Mr. Lovel's
plans&mdash;but he knew Mr. Lovel's precise connection with it, and
had damning evidence to boot. The spy shivered when he remembered
the scene in Hartshorn Lane. He had blundered and stuttered and
confessed his alarm by his confusion, while the Justice recited
what he had fondly believed was known only to the Almighty and
some few whose mortal interest it was to be silent.... He had
been amazed that he had not been there and then committed to Newgate.
He had not gone home that night, but wandered the streets and
slept cold under a Marylebone hedge. At first he had thought of
flight, but the recollection of his household detained him. He
would not go under. One pompous fool alone stood between him and
safety&mdash;perhaps fortune. Long before morning he had resolved that
Godfrey should die.</p>

<p>He had expected a difficult task, but lo! it was unbelievably
easy. About ten o'clock that day he had found Sir Edmund in the
Strand. He walked hurriedly as if on urgent business, and Lovel
had followed him up through Covent Garden, across the Oxford road,
and into the Marylebone fields. There the magistrate's pace had
slackened, and he had loitered like a truant schoolboy among the
furze and briars. His stoop had deepened, his head was sunk on
his breast, his hands twined behind him.</p>

<p>Now was the chance for the murderer lurking in the brambles.
It would be easy to slip behind and give him the sword-point.
But Mr. Lovel tarried. It may have been compunction, but more
likely it was fear. It was also curiosity, for the magistrate's
face, as he passed Lovel's hiding-place, was distraught and melancholy.
Here was another man with bitter thoughts&mdash;perhaps with a deadly
secret. For a moment the spy felt a certain kinship.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason he let the morning go by. About two in the
afternoon Godfrey left the fields and struck westward by a bridle-path
that led through the Paddington Woods to the marshes north of
Kensington. He walked slowly, but with an apparent purpose. Lovel
stopped for a moment at the White House, a dirty little hedge
tavern, to swallow a mouthful of ale, and tell a convincing lie
to John Rawson, the innkeeper, in case it should come in handy
some day. Then occurred a diversion. Young Mr. Forset's harriers
swept past, a dozen riders attended by a ragged foot following.
They checked by the path, and in the confusion of the halt Godfrey
seemed to vanish. It was not till close on Paddington village
that Mr. Lovel picked him up again. He was waiting for the darkness,
for he knew that he could never do what he purposed in cold daylight.
He hoped that the magistrate would make for Kensington, for that
was a lonely path.</p>

<p>But Sir Edmund seemed to be possessed of a freakish devil. No
sooner was he in Paddington than, after buying a glass of milk
from a milk-woman, he set off citywards again by the Oxford road.
Here there were many people, foot travellers and coaches, and
Mr. Lovel began to fear for his chance. But at Tyburn Godfrey
struck into the fields and presently was in the narrow lane called
St. Martin's Hedges, which led to Charing Cross. Now was the occasion.
The dusk was falling, and a light mist was creeping up from Westminster.
Lovel quickened his steps, for the magistrate was striding at
a round pace. Then came mischance. First one, then another of
the Marylebone cow-keepers blocked the lane with their driven
beasts. The place became as public as Bartholomew's Fair. Before
he knew it he was at Charing Cross.</p>

<p>He was now in a foul temper. He cursed his weakness in the morning,
when fate had given him every opportunity. He was in despair too.
His case was hopeless unless he struck soon. If Godfrey returned
to Hartshorn Lane he himself would be in Newgate on the morrow....
Fortunately the strange man did not seem to want to go home. He
moved east along the Strand, Lovel a dozen yards behind him.</p>

<p>Out from the dark Savoy entry ran a woman, screaming, and with
her hair flying. She seized on Godfrey and clutched his knees.
There was a bloody fray inside, in which her husband fought against
odds. The watch was not to be found. Would he, the great magistrate,
intervene? The very sight of his famous face would quell riot.</p>

<p>Sir Edmund looked up and down the street, pinched his chin and
peered down the precipitous Savoy causeway. Whatever the burden
on his soul he did not forget his duty.</p>

<p>"Show me," he said, and followed her into the gloom.</p>

<p>Lovel outside stood for a second hesitating. His chance had come.
His foe had gone of his own will into the place in all England
where murder could be most safely done. But now that the moment
had come at last, he was all of a tremble and his breath choked.
Only the picture, always horribly clear in his mind, of a gallows
dark against a pale sky and the little fire beneath where the
entrails of traitors were burned&mdash;a nightmare which had long ridden
him&mdash;nerved him to the next step. "His life or mine," he told
himself, as he groped his way into a lane as steep, dank, and
black as the sides of a well.</p>

<p>For some twenty yards he stumbled in an air thick with offal
and garlic. He heard steps ahead, the boots of the doomed magistrate
and the slipshod pattens of the woman. Then they stopped; his
quarry seemed to be ascending a stair on the right. It was a wretched
tenement of wood, two hundred years old, once a garden house attached
to the Savoy palace. Lovel scrambled up some rickety steps and
found himself on the rotten planks of a long passage, which was
lit by a small window giving to the west. He heard the sound of
a man slipping at the other end, and something like an oath. Then
a door slammed violently, and the place shook. After that it was
quiet. Where was the bloody fight that Godfrey had been brought
to settle?</p>

<p>It was very dark there; the window in the passage was only a
square of misty grey. Lovel felt eerie, a strange mood for an
assassin. Magistrate and woman seemed to have been spirited away....
He plucked up courage and continued, one hand on the wall on his
left. Then a sound broke the silence&mdash;a scuffle, and the long
grate of something heavy dragged on a rough floor. Presently his
fingers felt a door. The noise was inside that door. There were
big cracks in the panelling through which an eye could look, but
all was dark within. There were human beings moving there, and
speaking softly. Very gingerly he tried the hasp, but it was fastened
firm inside.</p>

<p>Suddenly someone in the room struck a flint and lit a lantern.
Lovel set his eyes to a crack and stood very still. The woman
had gone, and the room held three men. One lay on the floor with
a coarse kerchief, such as grooms wear, knotted round his throat.
Over him bent a man in a long coat with a cape, a man in a dark
peruke, whose face was clear in the lantern's light. Lovel knew
him for one Bedloe, a led-captain and cardsharper, whom he had
himself employed on occasion. The third man stood apart and appeared
from his gesticulations to be speaking rapidly. He wore his own
sandy hair, and every line of his mean freckled face told of excitement
and fear. Him also Lovel recognised &mdash;Carstairs, a Scotch
informer who had once made a handsome living through spying on
conventicles, but had now fallen into poverty owing to conducting
an affair of Buckingham's with a brutality which that fastidious
nobleman had not bargained for.... Lovel rubbed his eyes and looked
again. He knew likewise the man on the floor. It was Sir Edmund
Godfrey, and Sir Edmund Godfrey was dead.</p>

<p>The men were talking. "No blood-letting," said Bedloe. "This
must be a dry job. Though, by God, I wish I could stick my knife
into him&mdash;once for Trelawney, once for Frewen, and a dozen times
for myself. Through this swine I have festered a twelvemonth in
Little Ease."</p>

<p>Lovel's first thought, as he stared, was an immense relief. His
business had been done for him, and he had escaped the guilt of
it. His second, that here lay a chance of fair profit. Godfrey
was a great man, and Bedloe and Carstairs were the seediest of
rogues. He might make favor for himself with the Government if
he had them caught red-handed. It would help his status in Aldersgate
Street.... But he must act at once or the murderers would be gone.
He tiptoed back along the passage, tumbled down the crazy steps,
and ran up the steep entry to where he saw a glimmer of light
from the Strand.</p>

<p>At the gate he all but fell into the arms of a man&mdash;a powerful
fellow, for it was like running against a brick wall. Two strong
arms gripped Lovel by the shoulder, and a face looked into his.
There was little light in the street, but the glow from the window
of a Court perruquier was sufficient to reveal the features. Lovel
saw a gigantic face, with a chin so long that the mouth seemed
to be only half-way down it. Small eyes, red and fiery, were set
deep under a beetling forehead. The skin was a dark purple, and
the wig framing it was so white and fleecy that the man had the
appearance of a malevolent black-faced sheep.</p>

<p>Lovel gasped, as he recognised the celebrated Salamanca Doctor.
He was the man above all others whom he most wished to see.</p>

<p>"Dr. Oates!" he cried. "There's bloody work in the Savoy. I was
passing through a minute agone and I saw that noble Justice, Sir
Edmund Berry Godfrey, lie dead, and his murderers beside the body.
Quick, let us get the watch and take them red-handed."</p>

<p>The big paws, like a gorilla's, were withdrawn from his shoulders.
The purple complexion seemed to go nearly black, and the wide
mouth opened as if to bellow. But the sound which emerged was
only a whisper.</p>

<p>"By the maircy of Gaad we will have 'em!... A maist haarrid and
unnaitural craime. I will take 'em with my own haands. Here is
one who will help." And he turned to a man who had come up and
who looked like a city tradesman. "Lead on, honest fellow, and
we will see justice done. 'Tis pairt of the bloody Plaat.... I
foresaw it. I warned Sir Edmund, but he flouted me. Ah, poor soul,
he has paid for his unbelief."</p>

<p>Lovel, followed by Oates and the other whom he called Prance,
dived again into the darkness. Now he had no fears. He saw himself
acclaimed with the Doctor as the saviour of the nation, and the
door of Aldersgate Street open at his knocking. The man Prance
produced a lantern, and lighted them up the steps and into the
tumbledown passage. Fired with a sudden valour, Lovel drew his
sword and led the way to the sinister room. The door was open,
and the place lay empty, save for the dead body.</p>

<p>Oates stood beside it, looking, with his bandy legs great shoulders,
and bull neck, like some forest baboon.</p>

<p>"Oh, maist haunourable and noble victim!" he cried. "England
will maarn you, and the spawn of Raam will maarn you, for by this
deed they have rigged for thaimselves the gallows. Maark ye, Sir
Edmund is the proto-martyr of this new fight for the Praatestant
faith. He has died that the people may live, and by his death
Gaad has given England the sign she required.... Ah, Prance, how
little Tony Shaston will exult in our news! 'Twill be to him like
a bone to a cur-dog to take his ainemies thus red-haanded."</p>

<p>"By your leave, sir," said Lovel, "those same enemies have escaped
us. I saw them here five minutes since, but they have gone to
earth. What say you to a hue-and-cry&mdash;though this Savoy is a snug
warren to hide vermin."</p>

<p>Oates seemed to be in no hurry. He took the lantern from Prance
and scrutinised Lovel's face with savage intensity.</p>

<p>"Ye saw them, ye say.... I think, friend, I have seen ye before,
and I doubt in no good quaarter. There's a Paapist air about you."</p>

<p>"If you have seen me, 'twas in the house of my Lord Shaftesbury,
whom I have the honour to serve," said Lovel stoutly.</p>

<p>"Whoy, that is an haanest house enough. Whaat like were the villains,
then? Jaisuits, I'll warrant? Foxes from St. Omer's airth?"</p>

<p>"They were two common cutthroats whose names I know."</p>

<p>"Tools, belike. Fingers of the Paape's hand.... Ye seem to have
a good acquaintance among rogues, Mr. Whaat's-you-name."</p>

<p>The man Prance had disappeared, and Lovel suddenly saw his prospects
less bright. The murderers were being given a chance to escape,
and to his surprise he found himself in a fret to get after them.
Oates had clearly no desire for their capture, and the reason
flashed on his mind. The murder had come most opportunely for
him, and he sought to lay it at Jesuit doors. It would ill suit
his plans if only two common rascals were to swing for it. Far
better let it remain a mystery open to awful guesses. Omne ignotum
pro horrifico.... Lovel's temper was getting the better of his
prudence, and the sight of this monstrous baboon with his mincing
speech stirred in him a strange abhorrence.</p>

<p>"I can bear witness that the men who did the deed were no more
Jesuits than you. One is just out of Newgate, and the other is
a blackguard Scot late dismissed the Duke of Buckingham's service."</p>

<p>"Ye lie," and Oates' rasping voice was close to his ear. "'Tis
an incraidible tale. Will ye outface me, who alone discovered
the Plaat, and dispute with me on high poalicy?... Now I come
to look at it, ye have a true Jaisuit face. I maind of ye at St.
Omer. I judge ye an accoamplice..."</p>

<p>At that moment Prance returned and with him another, a man in
a dark peruke, wearing a long coat with a cape. Lovel's breath
went from him as he recognised Bedloe.</p>

<p>"There is the murderer," he cried in a sudden fury "I saw him
handle the body. I charge you to hold him."</p>

<p>Bedloe halted and looked at Oates, who nodded. Then he strode
up to Lovel and took him by the throat.</p>

<p>"Withdraw your words, you dog," he said, "or I will cut your
throat. I have but this moment landed at the river stairs and
heard of this horrid business. If you say you have ever seen me
before you lie most foully. Quick, you ferret. Will Bedloe suffers
no man to charge his honour."</p>

<p>The strong hands on his neck, the fierce eyes of the bravo, brought
back Lovel's fear and with it his prudence. He saw very plainly
the game, and he realised that he must assent to it. His contrition
was deep and voluble.</p>

<p>"I withdraw," he stammered, "and humbly crave pardon. I have
never seen this honest gentleman before."</p>

<p>"But ye saw this foul murder, and though the laight was dim ye
saw the murderers, and they had the Jaisuitical air?"</p>

<p>Oates' menacing voice had more terror for Lovel than Bedloe's
truculence. "Beyond doubt," he replied.</p>

<p>"Whoy, that is so far good," and the Doctor laughed. "Ye will
be helped later to remember the names for the benefit of his Maajesty's
Court.... 'Tis time we set to work. Is the place quiet?"</p>

<p>"As the grave, doctor," said Prance.</p>

<p>"Then I will unfold to you my pairpose. This noble magistrate
is foully murdered by pairsons unknown as yet, but whom this haanest
man will swear to have been disguised Jaisuits. Now in the sairvice
of Goad and the King 'tis raight to pretermit no aiffort to bring
the guilty to justice. The paiple of England are already roused
to a holy fairvour, and this haarrid craime will be as the paistol
flash to the powder caask. But that the craime may have its full
effaict on the paapulace 'tis raight to take some trouble with
the staging. 'Tis raight so to dispose of the boady that the complaicity
of the Paapists will be clear to every doubting fool. I, Taitus
Oates, take upon myself this responsibility, seeing that under
Goad I am the chosen ainstrument for the paiple's salvation. To
Soamersait Haase with it, say I, which is known for a haaunt of
the paapistically-minded.... The postern ye know of is open, Mr.
Prance?"</p>

<p>"I have seen to it," said the man, who seemed to conduct himself
in this wild business with the decorum of a merchant in his shop.</p>

<p>"Up with him, then," said Oates.</p>

<p>Prance and Bedloe swung the corpse on their shoulders and moved
out, while the doctor, gripping Lovel's arm like a vice, followed
at a little distance.</p>

<p>The Savoy was very quiet that night, and very dark. The few loiterers
who observed the procession must have shrugged their shoulders
and turned aside, zealous only to keep out of trouble. Such sights
were not uncommon in the Savoy. They entered a high ruinous house
on the east side, and after threading various passages reached
a door which opened on a flight of broken steps where it was hard
for more than one to pass at a time. Lovel heard the carriers
of the dead grunting as they squeezed up with their burden. At
the top another door gave on an outhouse in the yard of Somerset
House between the stables and the west water-gate.... Lovel, as
he stumbled after them with Oates' bulk dragging at his arm, was
in a confusion of mind such as his mean time-serving life had
never known.</p>

<p>He was in mortal fear, and yet his quaking heart would suddenly
be braced by a gust of anger. He knew he was a rogue, but there
were limits to roguery, and something in him&mdash;conscience, maybe,
or forgotten gentility&mdash;sickened at this outrage. He had an impulse
to defy them, to gain the street and give the alarm to honest
men. These fellows were going to construct a crime in their own
way which would bring death to the innocent.... Mr. Lovel trembled
at himself, and had to think hard on his family in the Billingsgate
attic to get back to his common-sense. He would not be believed
if he spoke out. Oates would only swear that he was the culprit,
and Oates had the ear of the courts and the mob. Besides, he had
too many dark patches in his past. It was not for such as he to
be finicking.</p>

<p>The body was pushed under an old truckle-bed which stood in the
corner, and a mass of frails, such as gardeners use, flung over
it for concealment. Oates rubbed his hands.</p>

<p>"The good work goes merrily," he said. "Sir Edmund dead, and
for a week the good fawk of London are a-fevered. Then the haarrid
discovery, and such a Praatestant uprising as will shake the maightiest
from his pairch. Wonderful are Goad's ways and surprising His
jaidgements! Every step must be weighed, since it is the Laard's
business. Five days we must give this city to grow uneasy, and
then ... The boady will be safe here?"</p>

<p>"I alone have the keys," said Prance.</p>

<p>The doctor counted on his thick fingers. "Monday&mdash;Tuesday &mdash;Waidnesday&mdash;aye,
Waidneday's the day. Captain Bedloe, ye have chairge of the removal.
Before dawn by the water-gate, and then a chair and a trusty man
to cairry it to the plaace of discovery. Ye have appainted the
spoat?"</p>

<p>"Any ditch in the Marylebone fields," said Bedloe.</p>

<p>"And before ye remove it&mdash;on the Tuesday naight haply&mdash;ye will
run the boady through with his swaard &mdash;Sir Edmund's swaard."</p>

<p>"So you tell me," said Bedloe gruffly, "but I see no reason in
it. The foolishest apothecary will be able tell how the man met
his death."</p>

<p>Oates grinned and laid his finger to his nose. "Ye laack subtelty,
fraiend. The priests of Baal must be met with their own waipons.
Look ye. This poor man is found with his swaard in his braist.
He has killed himself, says the fool. Not so, say the apothecaries.
Then why the swaard, asks the coroner. Because of the daivilish
cunning of his murderers, says Doctor Taitus Oates. A clear proof
that the Jaisuits are in it, says every honest Praatistant. D'ye
take me?"</p>

<p>Bedloe declared with oaths his admiration of the Doctor's wit,
and good humour filled the hovel; All but Lovel, who once again
was wrestling with something elemental in him that threatened
to ruin every thing. He remembered the bowed stumbling figure
that had gone before him in the Marylebone meadows. Then he had
been its enemy; now by a queer contortion of the mind he thought
of himself as the only protector of that cold clay under the bed&mdash;honoured
in life, but in death a poor pawn in a rogue's cause. He stood
a little apart from the others near the door, and his eyes sought
it furtively. He was not in the plot, and yet the plotters did
not trouble about him. They assumed his complaisance. Doubtless
they knew his shabby past.</p>

<p>He was roused by Oates' voice. The Doctor was arranging his plan
of campaign with gusto. Bedloe was to disappear to the West Country
till the time came for him to offer his evidence. Prance was to
go about his peaceful trade till Bedloe gave him the cue. It was
a masterly stratagem &mdash;Bedloe to start the ball, Prance to
be accused as accomplice and then on his own account to give the
other scoundrel corroboration.</p>

<p>"Attend, you sir," the doctor shouted to Lovel. "Ye will be called
to swear to the murderers whom this haanest man will name. If
ye be a true Praatestant ye will repeat the laisson I taich you.
If not, ye will be set down as one of the villains and the good
fawk of this city will tear the limbs from ye at my nod. Be well
advaised, my friend, for I hold ye in my haand." And Oates raised
a great paw and opened and shut it.</p>

<p>Lovel mumbled assent. Fear had again descended on him. He heard
dimly the Doctor going over the names of those to be accused.</p>

<p>"Ye must bring in one of the sairvants of this place," he said.
"Some common paarter, who has no friends."</p>

<p>"Trust me," said Prance. "I will find a likely fellow among the
Queen's household. I have several in my mind for the honour."</p>

<p>"Truly the plaace is a nest of Paapists," said Oates. "And not
such as you, Mr. Prance, who putt England before the Paape. Ye
are worth a score of Praatestants to the good caause, and it will
be remaimbered. Be assured it will be remaimbered.... Ye are clear
about the main villains? Walsh, you say, and Pritchard and the
man called Le Fevre?"</p>

<p>"The last most of all. But they are sharp-nosed as hounds, and
unless we go warily they will give us the slip, and we must fall
back on lesser game."</p>

<p>"Le Fevre." Oates mouthed the name. "The Queen's confessor. I
was spit upon by him at St. Omer, and would waipe out the affront.
A dog of a Frainch priest! A man I have long abhaarred."</p>

<p>"So also have I." Prance had venom in his level voice. "But he
is no Frenchman. He is English as you&mdash;a Phayre out of Huntingdon."</p>

<p>The name penetrated Lovel's dulled wits. Phayre! It was the one
man who in his father's life had shown him unselfish kindness.
Long ago in Paris this Phayre had been his teacher, had saved
him from starvation, had treated him with a gentleman's courtesy.
Even his crimes had not estranged this friend. Phayre had baptized
his child, and tended his wife when he was in hiding. But a week
ago he had spoken a kindly word in the Mall to one who had rarely
a kind word from an honest man.</p>

<p>That day had been to the spy a revelation of odd corners in his
soul. He had mustered in the morning the resolution to kill one
man. Now he discovered a scruple which bade him at all risks avert
the killing of another. He perceived very clearly what the decision
meant&mdash;desperate peril, perhaps ruin and death. He dare not delay,
for in a little he would be too deep in the toils. He must escape
and be first with the news of Godfrey's death in some potent quarter.
Buckingham, who was a great prince. Or Danby. Or the King himself....</p>

<p>The cunning of a lifetime failed him in that moment. He slipped
through the door, but his coat caught in a splinter of wood, and
the rending of it gave the alarm. As with quaking heart he ran
up the silent stable-yard towards the Strand gate he felt close
on him the wind of the pursuit. In the dark he slipped on a patch
of horse-dung and was down. Something heavy fell atop of him,
and the next second a gross agony tore the breath from him.</p>

<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>Five minutes later Bedloe was unknotting a coarse kerchief and
stuffing it into his pocket. It was the same that had strangled
Godfrey.</p>

<p>"A good riddance," said Oates. "The fool had seen too much and
would have proved but a saarry witness. Now by the mairciful dispensation
of Goad he has ceased to trouble us. Ye know him, Captain Bedloe?"</p>

<p>"A Papistical cur, and white-livered at that," the bravo answered.</p>

<p>"And his boady? It must be praamptly disposed of."</p>

<p>"An easy task. There is the Savoy water-gate and in an hour the
tide will run. He has no friends to inquire after him."</p>

<p>Oates rubbed his hands and cast his eyes upward. "Great are the
doings of the Laard," he said, "and wonderful in our saight!"</p>
