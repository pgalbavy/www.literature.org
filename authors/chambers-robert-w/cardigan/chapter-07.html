<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Now the dark pages turning in the book of fate were flying faster
than young eyes could mark. First to the Hall came Thayendanegea,
brother to Mistress Molly, and embraced us all, eagerly admiring
my uniform with an Indian's frank naïveté, caressing Silver Heels's
curly pate and praising her beauty, and fondling Esk and Peter
with Albany sweets till I forbade them to approach, for their
stickiness did disgust me.</p>

<p>I had always been greatly attached to Thayendanegea, for he was
a frank, affectionate youth, though a blooded Mohawk, and possessing
the courtesy, gentleness, and graces of true quality.</p>

<p>Clothed like an English gentleman, bearing himself like a baronet,
he conducted to the admiration and respect of all, and this though
he was the great war-chief of the Mohawks, and already an honoured
leader in the council of the Six Nations.</p>

<p>He never became a sachem, but remained always the most respected
and powerful leader in the Long House. Even Huron and Delaware
listened when he spoke. He never treated the Lenni-Lenape as women,
and for this reason they listened always willingly to the voice
of Joseph Brant, called Thayendanegea.</p>

<p>Now, though Sir William had hitherto trusted Brant in all things,
I noticed he spoke not to Brant of Quider's mission, though Mr.
Butler had already scented a mystery in the Cayuga's visit, and
often asked why Quider had never spoken his message; for he was
not aware that both message and answer had been delivered long
ago.</p>

<p>That week there were three council fires at the Lower Castle,
which Brant and Mr. Butler attended in company with a certain
thin little Seneca chief called Red Jacket, a filthy, sly, and
sullen creature, who was, perhaps, a great orator, but all the
world knew him for a glutton and a coward.</p>

<p>Brant despised him, and it was Brant, too, who had given to Red
Jacket that insulting title, "The Cow-Killer," which even the
Mohawk children shouted when Red Jacket came to Johnson Hall after
the council fires had been covered at the Lower Castle.</p>

<p>Our house had now been thronged with Indians for a week. Eleven
hundred Mohawks, Cayugas, Senecas, Onondagas, and a few Tuscaroras
lay encamped around us, holding long talks with Red Jacket, Mr.
Butler, and Brant; but Sir William attended no fires, and very
soon I discovered the reason. For suddenly Sir John Johnson arrived
at the Hall, and with him Colonel Daniel Claus and his lady from
Albany, which abrupt advents began a stir and bustle among us
that increased as, day by day, new guests arrived at our house.
Johnson Hall, Colonel Guy Johnson's house, and the house of Colonel
John Butler were now crowded to overflow with guests. Sachems
and chiefs of the Oneidas arrived, officers from the Royal Americans
and from the three regiments of militia which Tryon County maintained,
officers from my own troop of irregular horse quartered at Albany,
and whom I now met for the first time; and finally, in prodigious
state, came our Governor Tryon from New York, with a troop of
horse which, for beauty of clothing and impudence of deportment,
I had never seen equalled.</p>

<p>The house rang with laughter and the tinkle of glasses from morning
until night; on the stairs there swept a continuous rush and rustle
of ladies' petticoats like the wind blowing through corn. Ladies
filled the house; there were maids and lackeys and footmen and
chair-bearers and slaves thronging porch and hallway, new faces
everywhere, new uniforms, new gowns, new phrases, new dishes at
table, new airs at the spinet, new songs.</p>

<p>"Tiddle tinkle" went our spinet all day and night, with some
French ladies from Saint Sacrement a-singing la-la-la.</p>

<p>As by a magic touch the old homely life had vanished, old faces
disappeared, old voices were silent. I looked in vain for Silver
Heels, for Peter, for Esk. They were drowned in this silken sea.</p>

<p>And now, piling confusion on confusion, comes from the south
my Lord Dunmore from Virginia, satin-coated, foppish, all powder
and frill, and scented like a French lady. But oh, the gallant
company he brought to Johnson Hall&mdash;those courtly Virginians with
their graces and velvet voices, with their low bows and noiseless
movements, elegant as panthers, suave as Jesuits, and proud as
heirs to kingdoms all.</p>

<p>Some lodged at the inns in town, some with us, some with Sir
John Johnson, and others with Colonel Butler. But they all thronged
our house, day and night, till I was like to stifle with the perfumes
and scented clothes of our white guests and the wild-animal aroma
of the Indians.</p>

<p>For two days, indeed, I saw little of the company, for I lodged
at the block-house with Mr. Duncan, keeping an eye on the pest-hut
where lay the stricken Cayuga; this by Sir William's orders, though
warning me to approach the hut no nearer than the sentries, and
that with my hanker to my nose and a lump of sulphur in my mouth.</p>

<p>As for Silver Heels, I saw her but twice, and then she disappeared
entirely. I was sorry for her, believing she had been cooped within
the limits of nursery and play-room; but I had my pity for my
pains, as it turned out.</p>

<p>It came about in this way: I had been relieved of duties at the
block-house to receive reports of Quider's sickness, as it was
now believed certain that the Cayuga must die; and I had been
ordered to dress in my new uniform, to accompany Sir William to
a review of our honest Tryon County militia, now assembling at
Johnstown and Schenectady.</p>

<p>It was early morning, with the fields all dewy and a west wind
blowing the daisies into furrows, when I left my chamber, booted,
hair powdered in a club and tied with black, and my new silver
gorget shining like the sun on my breast. I was in dress uniform,
scarlet coat, buff smalls, sash and sword glittering, and I meant
to cut a figure that day which people might remember. But Lord!
Even on the staircase I found myself in a crowd of officers all
laces and sashes and gold brocade, and buttons like yellow stars
dancing on cuff and collar. My uniform was but a spark in the
fire; I was obscured, nay snuffed out in the midst of the Virginians
with their flame-colored scarfs and cockades, and the New York
officers of the Governor's dragoon guard, gorgeous as the drummers
of the French grenadiers.</p>

<p>Smothered by the hot air, the perfumes and pomatum on stock and
queue, the warm cloying odour of dressed leather and new gloves
of kid-skin, I made my way into the hall, but found it packed
with ladies, all a-fanning and rustling, with maids tying on sun-masks
and pinning plumes to rolls of hair that towered like the Adirondacks,
all vegetation and birds.</p>

<p>Hat under arm, hand on hilt, I did bow and smile and beseech
for a free passage to the fresh air, and it made me think of edging
through the barn-yard with the feathered flock crowding and ruffling
a thousand feathers. And as I threaded my way, minding my steps
as well I might, it was: "Oh, la! My lady's skirt!" and "Lud!
The lad's spur's in the lace!" "My mantua!" "Ah! my scarf's a-trail
on the creature's sword!" "Grand dieu! et ma robe, monsieur!"</p>

<p>Standing at last in the portico with the fresh wind in my face,
I perceived Sir William, attended by Sir John and Colonel Claus,
inspecting the guard at the north block-house, and I made haste
to join them, running fast, to the danger of my powdered hair,
which scattered a small snowy cloud in the wind.</p>

<p>"Gad! The lad's powdered like a Virginian!" said Sir William,
laughing and drawing me to him, pinching my ears and chin. Then
he dusted the powder from my shoulders and turned me around, muttering
to himself, "A proper officer, damme! a well-groomed lad; eh,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sir John, with his slow, reserved eyes shifting from
my hat to my spurs. He gave me a damp finger to press, then his
indifferent gaze wandered to the meadows below, where the brown
and yellow uniforms of Colonel Butler's militia regiment spread
out like furrows of autumn leaves.</p>

<p>I paid my respects to Colonel Claus, who honoured me with a careless
nod, and passed before me to greet Colonel John Butler and his
son, Captain Walter Butler.</p>

<p>The Butlers were of a stripe; there was the blank fixed eye of
the night-bird in father and son, the deathly grimace to do duty
as a smile, the mechanical observances of polite company, the
compliments, the bows, the carriage of gentlemen, but back of
it something lifeless, something slow and terrifying in voice
and step &mdash;God knows what I mean! Yet often and often it
came to me that inside their bodies something was lying dead&mdash;their
souls, perhaps.</p>

<p>I stood behind Sir William, drawing on my gloves of kid-skin,
observing the officers as they came up to join the staff, and
stand and watch the two remaining regiments marching into the
meadow below. These regiments were clothed in brown, green, and
scarlet, one wearing green coats, t'other bright red with yellow
facings, an over-gaudy effect and disturbing to my senses like
the sounds of a spinet when Peter pounded on the keys.</p>

<p>They had built a gayly painted wooden pavilion in the meadow
for the ladies and Governor Tryon and my Lord Dunmore, and now
came the coaches and calashes burdened with beauty and tickled
and tricked out in ribbons, and the Virginians all a-horse, caracoling
beside the vehicles, a brave, bright company, by Heaven!&mdash;for
they rode perfectly and with a gracious carelessness which contrasted
favourably with the stiff, solid gallop of our Governor Tryon's
dragoon guard.</p>

<p>Behind us the grooms were bringing up our mounts, and I slyly
looked for Warlock, doubting lest he be 'portioned to some horseless
guest. But there the dear fellow stood, ears pointed straight
at me, and snorting for the caress of my hand on his muzzle.</p>

<p>"Mount, gentlemen!" said Sir William, briskly, setting toe to
the stirrup held by young Bareshanks; and up into our saddles
we popped, while the trumpet blew from the block-house, and down
in the meadow the long painted drums boomed out the salute.</p>

<p>As we entered the meadow at a trot I caught a good, quick picture
of the pavilion with its flags, its restless rows of ladies unmasking,
fluttering kerchiefs and fans and scarfs; and my Lord Dunmore
all over gold and blue, blinking like a cat in the sun, and the
crimson of the Governor's mantle, clasped with gilt, falling from
his solid epaulets. This I saw clearly, but as we broke into a
gallop across the clover, the colours ran like tinted fires; the
dull reds and blues of the Indians, the shimmer on gorgets and
buckles, the rippling flags; yet it seemed as I flew past that
I had seen a face up there which I knew well yet did not know,
like those familiar eyes that look at us in dreams. Surely it
was not Silver Heels. But there was no time for speculation now.
Rub-a-dub-dub! Bang! Bang! Our brigade band was marching past
with our head groom playing a French horn very badly, and old
Norman McLeod a-fifing it, wrong foot foremost, which caused Sir
William to mutter "damn!" and rub his nose in mortification.</p>

<p>  [Illustration: "'<em>SILVER HEELS!' I STAMMERED</em>"]</p>

<p>"Hay-foot! Straw-foot!" simpered a cornet of dragoons behind
me, and I turned on him, and gave him a look.</p>

<p>"Did you say you were hungry?" I whispered, backing my horse
gently against the horse of the insolent cornet.</p>

<p>"Hungry?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"You mentioned hay, sir," I said, fiercely.</p>

<p>He turned red as a pippin but did not reply.</p>

<p>Swallowing my anger and my shame for our militia yokels, I glared
at the head of Colonel Butler's regiment, now passing, and was
comforted, for the clod-hoppers marched like regulars with a solid
double rank of fifers shrilling out "Down, Derry, down!" as smart
as you please.</p>

<p>After them came the green-coated varlets, with a good round stench
of the stables from their ranks, yet footing it proudly, and their
fifes ringing a barbarous tune which is lately somewhat in vogue
among us, the same being called "Yankee Doodle."</p>

<p>Followed our three companies of Royal Americans, drums beating
"The Huron," a most warming march and loudly applauded by the
long lines of country folk and Indians, sitting on the stone walls;
and after them the inharmonious regiment in yellow and red, with
two men drunk and a dog-fight in the rear, soberly observed by
my Lord Dunmore, who laid a bet with our Governor, and lost on
the spotted dog, they say.</p>

<p>There was a sham battle of the troops, too; half a gill to every
fifth man, and fifty pounds for the cannon on the hill, which
cost Sir William a pretty penny, our Governor refusing to allow
for the powder burned. However, it was a fine pageant, and pleased
all; and I was sorry when the last cartridge was spent and the
brigade band played, "God Save the King."</p>

<p>We followed Sir William to the pavilion, dismounting there to
ascend the stairs and pay our respects to the Governor and to
Lord Dunmore.</p>

<p>"Come with me, Michael," said Sir William, wiping his face with
his hanker till it glistened; and I followed the Baronet into
the enclosure.</p>

<p>Lord Dunmore was tricked out like a painted actor, neither old
nor young, but too white and pink and without any red blood in
him, as far as I could see. He wore a wig&mdash;it was said he possessed
twenty and valued at six thousand pounds&mdash;and his fingers, which
I could see through the lace on his cuffs, were like white bird's
claws loaded with jewels.</p>

<p>When Lord Dunmore saw Sir William he fell a-tapping his snuff-box
and bobbing and smiling, nor did he rise until we had made our
way to him.</p>

<p>"Lud! Lud!" he said, and fell a-simpering, with hands raised
in feigned amazement at the magnificence of the review. "Lud!
Lud! Sir William! A gallant fête! A brave defilé! Militia, not
regulars, you say! Vive Dieu, Sir William, a most creditable entraining!
Permettez&mdash;mes compliments le plus distinguée!"</p>

<p>"My aide-de-camp, Lord Dunmore," said Sir William, bluntly; "your
Lordship will remember Captain Cardigan who died before Quebec?
His son, my Lord!&mdash;and my dear kinsman, Michael Cardigan, cornet
in the Borderers."</p>

<p>"Strike me!" simpered Lord Dunmore. "Strike me, now, Sir William!
He has his father's eyes &mdash;Vrai Dieu! Curse me, if he has
not his father's eyes, Sir William!"</p>

<p>At this remarkable discovery I bowed and said it was an honour
to be considered like my father in any particular.</p>

<p>"Burn me!" murmured his Lordship, in an ecstasy at my natural
response. "Burn me, Sir William, what a wit he has, now!" And
he peeped at me, squeezing his eyes into two weak slits, and laid
his snuff-box against his nose. Lord! What a false face he pulled
at me!</p>

<p>Apparently surfeited with admiration, he invited Sir William
to take snuff with him, then turning to Governor Tryon, who had
just come into the stall, he fell to smirking and exclaiming and
vapouring about God knows what, until I, weary and cloyed, glanced
around me at the crowd on the seats above us.</p>

<p>There were a hundred pair of bright eyes fixed on us, and without
vanity I perceived a few to meet mine, but the faces were not
distinct, and I found it disconcerting.</p>

<p>Then a deep, pleasant voice sounded close beside me, and looking
around, I saw our Governor Tryon smiling at me.</p>

<p>"I knew your father," he said; "it was a privilege, Mr. Cardigan,
and one I take advantage of to address the son of so gallant a
gentleman."</p>

<p>I replied warmly and gratefully, yet with military deference,
and I saw Sir William observing me, well pleased at my bearing.</p>

<p>"In these times," said the Governor, clasping his cloak over
his epaulets, "it is a pleasure to meet with modest loyalty in
the younger generation. Loyal to parent, loyal to King! I predict
we shall hear from you, Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>"Please God, sir," I replied, blushing scarlet; for into my mind
crept that wavering doubt which, since Sir William had talked
with me, haunted me like a shadow.</p>

<p>The Governor passed by with his clanking dragoons, among them
the young jackanapes who had presumed to sneer at our yeomanry,
and we delivered a pair of scornful glances at each other which
crossed like broadswords.</p>

<p>And now my Lord Dunmore's boudoir on wheels drove up, and his
purring Lordship minced off in the midst of his flame-coloured
Virginians, for all the world like a white cat dancing through
hell fire.</p>

<p>The ladies were rising, tying on sun-masks, standing in rows
between the seats, and the officers loitered and whispered and
played with their snuff-boxes, while the silent Mohawk chiefs
looked on, standing like statues till the crowd gave them their
liberty.</p>

<p>One lady there was, in a mask and silvery cloak, who looked at
me so long through the eye-holes that I felt my heart begin a-beating;
and another, too, in mask and rose mantle, who lifted the linen
a trifle, displaying a fresh, sweet, smiling mouth. This one in
rose turned twice to look at me, and it amused me to feel my heart
go a-bumping at my ribs so loud, for she did truly resemble Marie
Livingston.</p>

<p>Sir William and Colonel Claus had joined Lord Dunmore in his
coach; Sir John and Colonel Butler attached themselves to our
Governor Tryon. I, abandoned, rode back to the Hall with a company
of Virginians and dragoons, wondering if ever I might acquire
such horsemanship as the Southerners displayed.</p>

<p>Coming to the Hall, I met Sir William, whose smiling face grew
haggard at sight of me, and he drew me apart, asking of news from
Quider.</p>

<p>"He is not yet dead, sir," I replied, my heart aching for Sir
William.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood staring at the ground, then bidding me
report to Mr. Duncan at the block-house, walked away to disguise
his anxious visage again with the oldest mask in the world&mdash;a
smile.</p>

<p>That night Sir William provided two great banquets for our guests,
one at the court-house in Johnstown, the other at Johnson Hall.</p>

<p>The splendid banquet at the court-house was given to all the
visiting officers except Lord Dunmore, Governor Tryon, and their
particular aides. To it were invited the Virginians, the New-Yorkers,
the important Mohawk, Seneca, and Onondaga sachems, and chiefs
of the Long House. Also were bidden the officers of our Royal
Americans, such officers of the Border House as had come with
Governor Tryon, and all gentlemen of distinction who had brought
their ladies.</p>

<p>Colonel Claus and his lady presided as host and hostess, representing
Sir William and Mistress Molly, and our brigade band played in
the gallery during the banquet, and later on the portico of the
court-house, where a great crowd of people had collected to cheer.</p>

<p>The other banquet was given at the same hour in our house, to
honour Lord Dunmore and Governor Tryon.</p>

<p>There were gathered in the hallway and on the stairs a vast company
of ladies and gentlemen when I came down from my little chamber
to wait on Sir William. Here was the great Earl of Dunmore in
a ring of fluttering ladies, peering, bobbing, tapping his snuff-box,
preening the lace on his cuffs&mdash;and I thought he resembled one
of those irksome restless birds from the Canaries in a painted
cage.</p>

<p>There was our Governor Tryon in purple silk from head to foot,
with the broad sash and star on his breast, leaning over, hands
clasped behind his back, to whisper jest or flattery to a young
girl who tapped at him with her fan. There was my kinsman, Sir
John Johnson, with his indifferent eyes and ungracious carriage,
and old Colonel Butler watching the gay company as hawks, from
sheer habit, watch peacocks, meaning no attack. There also strolled
my impudent dragoon lad who had offended at the pavilion, and
I will not deny he appeared to be an elegant and handsome officer,
possessing those marked characteristics of fashion and assurance
which one observes in all gentlemen from the city of New York.</p>

<p>Making my way carefully amid rustling petticoats and a forest
of painted fans all waving like the wings of a swarm of moths
drawn by the candle-light, I passed Mistress Molly on the arm
of Sir William, touching my lips to her pretty fingers, which
she held out to me behind her back.</p>

<p>Next I encountered Mr. Butler and honoured him with a scowl,
which displayed my country breeding, it being the fashion among
quality to greet one's enemy with more elaborate courtesy than
one accords to friends.</p>

<p>People passed and repassed with laughter and whisper, and the
scented wind from their fans swept my cheek.</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed as though the voice of Silver Heels sounded
in my ears, and for a moment I stared about me, astonished that
she should be here. But I could not find her. Then her voice sounded
again, clear as a pebbled spring in all that chatter, and turning,
I saw it came from a young girl standing behind me. She was very
delicate and pretty in her powder and patches, truly somewhat
pale and lacking in plumpness, but with a pair of great hazel
eyes like Silver Heels's, and the child's full lips. Certainly
she had Silver Heels's voice, and her trick of widening her eyes,
too, for now she perceived me, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, Micky!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Silver Heels!" I stammered, striving to believe my eyes. What
miracle of miracles had set her to grow tall and turn into a woman
in a single week?</p>

<p>I stared almost piteously at her, trying to find my own familiar
comrade in this whispering shower of silk and ribbon, this delicate
stranger, smiling breathlessly at me with sparkling teeth set
on the edge of her painted fan.</p>

<p>In her triumph she laughed that laugh of silver which sounded
ever of woodlands and birds, the same laugh, the same gray eyes,
and the same satin fingers laid on my wrist.</p>

<p>"Silly," she whispered, "I told you so. And it has come true;
my gown is silk, my stockings silk, my shoes are Paddington's
make and silken to the soles!"</p>

<p>"How did you grow?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Have I grown? Oh, my gown and shoes count, too, and my hair
rolled by Betty till I vowed she meant to scalp me! See my egrettes!
Are they straight, Micky?"</p>

<p>Ere I could attempt to compose my thoughts, comes mincing my
impudent dragoon, who seemed to know her, for he brought her a
ribbon to tie above her elbow, explaining it was a new conceit
from New York.</p>

<p>"It's this way," he explained, utterly ignoring my presence;
"I tie this bow of blue above your elbow, so!&mdash;with your gracious
consent. Now for a partner to lead you to the table I seek some
gentleman and tie a blue bow to his sword-hilt."</p>

<p>"Pray tie it to Mr. Cardigan's," said Silver Heels, mischievously.
"I have much to say to him for his peace of mind."</p>

<p>The dragoon and I, face to face, regarded each other with menacing
composure.</p>

<p>"To deprive you of such an honour, sir," said he, coolly, "I
protest reduces me to despair; but the light blue bows have already
been awarded, Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>Instinctively I glanced at his own sword-hilt, and there fluttered
a light blue ribbon. At the same moment I perceived that Silver
Heels had been perfectly aware of this.</p>

<p>Mortified as I was, and stinging under the dragoon's impudence,
I controlled myself sufficiently to congratulate him and courteously
deplore my own ill fortune, without a grimace, though it stuck
in my throat to say it.</p>

<p>"Let not your lady hear that!" said Silver Heels, with her fan
hiding her lips. "How do you know, sir, which partner fate and
Mr. Bevan may allot you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bevan and I regarded each other in solemn hostility.</p>

<p>"May I have the honour of attaching this ribbon to your hilt,
sir?" he asked, stiffly.</p>

<p>"You may, sir," said I, still more stiffly, "if it is necessary."</p>

<p>He tied a red bow-knot to my hilt; we bowed to each other, then
with a smile and a word to Silver Heels which I did not catch,
he saluted us again and strolled off with his nose in the air
and his hands full of ribbons of every hue&mdash;the fop!</p>

<p>"Who is that pitiful ass?" I said, turning to Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"Why, Michael!" she protested, reproachfully, yet smiling, too.</p>

<p>"Oh, if he's one of your friends, I ask indulgence," said I,
mad enough to pluck the blue knot from her arm.</p>

<p>"Truly, Michael," she sniffed, "you are still very young."</p>

<p>She seated herself by the big clock; I sat beside her, sullenly,
and for a time I peered at her sideways. Verily, the impossible
had overtaken us; she appeared to be fully as tall as half the
ladies gathered around us; her self-possession and obvious indifference
to me completed my growing discomfort. I looked at her small,
silk-covered toes pushing out under her petticoat.</p>

<p>"Is the dandelion juice on them yet?" I asked, with piteous playfulness.</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that!" she said, sharply, drawing her feet in.
And with that petulant movement the playmate I had so often bullied,
slipped away from me forever, leaving in her place a dainty thing
of airs and laces to flout me, whom I knew not, but whom I meant
to be avenged on; for at moments, as I sat there, I could have
yelled aloud in my vexation.</p>

<p>Lord! how they all ogled her, and came a-mincing, gentlemen and
ladies, old and young, and I heard whispers around me that she
was a beauty and would be rich one day. My Lord Dunmore, too,
came a-dancing pit-pat! till I thought to hear his bones creak
inside his white silk; and the dragoon jackanapes was there, having
tied up everything with his ribbons save his own long ears, and
it infuriated me to see him standing guard protector over Silver
Heels, with jealous smiles for all who approached.</p>

<p>Now what the devil had seized all these gentlemen to set them
smirking and vapouring over Silver Heels, I did not know, or rather,
I knew perfectly well, because it was as plain as a Mohawk moccasin
on a spotted trail that Silver Heels had suddenly become a beauty.
Even I could see that. Granted her bosom lacked somewhat in fulness,
granted a childish leanness of arm and neck, granted even a pallor
which adorned her not, and which, to tell the truth, I knew came
from fright, there was something in the frail moulding of her
that drew eyes, something in the arm's slim contours that touched
even me.</p>

<p>I might have taken a pride in her, had not all these bobbing
pigeons come crowding about to share openly my unconfessed admiration.
But they bowed and strutted and posed and flattered, pressing
closer until she was shut from my sight by a circle of coat-skirts,
tilted swords, and muscular calves in silken stockings.</p>

<p>Presently our fiddlers and bassoons started the "Huron;" there
was a flutter to find ribbons that matched, and a world of bustle
and laughter, with gentlemen and ladies comparing colours and
bowing and curtseying without regard to neighbors' toes and petticoats&mdash;the
tittering popinjays!</p>

<p>Truly, if this mode of choosing one's lady prevailed in New York,
I at least found it smacked something of silliness and French
frivolity.</p>

<p>I had now been crowded up against our tall clock in the hall,
and stood there striving to get a glimpse of Silver Heels, completely
forgetting that somewhere in the crush a lady with a scarlet ribbon
on her arm might be waiting for me. And doubtless I should have
remained there, gnawing my lip, till doomsday, had not Silver
Heels espied me and come fluttering through the crowd with:</p>

<p>"Oh, Micky! Have you seen your lady? Your old friend Marie Livingston!
But she is wedded now; she is that pretty Mrs. Hamilton from Saint
Sacrement. Oh, you lucky boy! All the officers are raving over
her! But I asked her if she remembered you, and she said she didn't,
so there!"</p>

<p>"Silver Heels," I began, with the first appealing glance I had
ever bestowed on a woman; "Silver Heels, I want to tell you something."</p>

<p>I do not believe she was listening, or perhaps the chatter around
us drowned my voice, which was husky and over-fond, for she cried:
"You must not detain me, Michael. Mr. Bevan is waiting for me."</p>

<p>And with that she was gone into the whirl, leaving me high and
dry against my clock, and furious over I knew not what. For truly
I myself did not know what it was I had been about to say to Silver
Heels. As for this Mrs. Hamilton, it madded me to hear of her.
I had long forgotten Marie Livingston&mdash;save as a name to goad
Silver Heels withal.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton, forsooth! What the foul fiend had I to do with
another man's wife, whether Hamilton or Smith or Jones I cared
not, while that ape of a New-Yorker had set himself in my rightful
place beside Silver Heels! And what stabbed deepest was that Silver
Heels found pleasure in his foolish company&mdash;ay, plainly preferred
him to me&mdash;the ungrateful minx! I prayed fervently she might live
to repent it. I pictured her remorse when she came to her senses.
And in a moment more I had slipped into one of my waking dreams
wherein justice was dealt out by the jugful all around, and I
emerged from some scenes of carnage, calm, triumphant, gently
forgiving Silver Heels the accumulated sins of her misspent life.</p>

<p>Sullenly dreaming there under the tall clock, and happening to
lift my eyes towards heaven for some of its spare vengeance, I
perceived on the stairs that same lady who had half raised her
sun-mask at the review &mdash;I mean the one in the rose mantle,
not the other in the silvery cloak, whom I now knew had been Silver
Heels.</p>

<p>Down the stairs rustled my lady of the rose mantle, finger-tips
playing a tattoo over the mahogany balustrade, and on her lips
a smile, as I fancied, though later I came to know that it was
only the natural expression of her mouth. Something in my memory
stirred at that smiling face.</p>

<p>Now she was looking straight at me, with that delicate curve
of her lips which sets men thinking, and at the same moment I
perceived that she wore my colours. Marie Livingston! I should
never have known her; so we were quits, the affected minx! This
was Mrs. Hamilton!&mdash;this bright-eyed girl with her smooth rose-petal
skin and her snowy hand on the balustrade. Could I be mistaken?
Surely she wore my colours! I glanced at the knot on my sword-hilt,
then pressed through the throng to the stairway. Now at last I
could pay Silver Heels in her own wampum, and I meant to do it
under her very nose.</p>

<p>I met Mrs. Hamilton at the foot of the stairs, but she did not
appear to see me. Truly she was a miracle of innocence not to
have perceived her colours on my hilt, or perhaps she was over-timid.
So I addressed her reassuringly and made her a bow that I knew
must be impressive. However, I found her less confused than I,
for she insisted on matching ribbons very carefully, which hurt
my pride somewhat. But when she could no longer doubt that our
ribbons matched, she made me a whimsical reverence, and took my
arm with a smile, and a cool: "Oh, I faintly recall you now, Mr.
Cardigan. How you have grown!"</p>

<p>Out into the wilderness of silver and candle-light we passed,
fiddle and bassoon a-playing with might and main, and we stood
behind our chairs while my Lord Dunmore chattered a blessing,
then seated ourselves amid a gale of whispers.</p>

<p>Through the flare of the candles I saw Brant and Sir John Johnson
near us, and also that filthy Indian, Red Jacket, both hands already
in a dish of jelly, a-gobbling and grunting to himself, which
sent Lord Dunmore into peals of shrill laughter, though Sir William
took no notice. Presently I perceived Silver Heels and Mr. Bevan,
nearly opposite to us, and strove to catch her eye. But Silver
Heels took small notice of me; her cheeks had gone red with her
first sip of wine, and she sat there rosy and silent, head a little
lowered, while that insufferable coxcomb whispered into her ear,
and smirked, and played with his wine-glass till the very sight
of the man sickened me.</p>

<p>Stung to the quick by her indifference to my presence, smarting
in my fancied isolation, I resolved to show her that I cared not
a whit for her or her dragoon. So I loosened my tongue and set
it wagging so smartly that I think I astonished Mrs. Hamilton,
who had been observing Mr. Bevan with her fixed smile. At any
rate, she gave me a long, pleasant stare, and presently her fixed
smile became very sweet and pretty, although I thought a trifle
mocking.</p>

<p>"Is it not amusing?" she said, coolly; "here you sit with me,
when you would give your tow-head to be prattling into Mistress
Warren's ears; and here sit I at twiddle-thumbs, devising vengeance
on Mr. Bevan, who belongs to me!"</p>

<p>Perplexed and disconcerted, I found no words to answer such an
amazing sally. It shamed me, too. Perhaps my countenance had betrayed
me, but her confession concerning Mr. Bevan was a bold one, and
not at all to my taste.</p>

<p>"I thought you had a husband," said I, with boyish bluntness.</p>

<p>She coloured up like fire for a moment, and I was sorry I spoke,
but I had my pity for my pains, for the next instant she was laughing
at me as though I were a ninny, and I could discover no reason
for her mirth.</p>

<p>"Please tell me your Christian name," she said, sweetly. "I really
do desire to recall it."</p>

<p>"My name is Michael," said I, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Was it not Saint Michael who so soundly spanked the devil?"
she asked, with her innocent smile. "Truly, Mr. Cardigan, you
were well named to chastise the wicked with such sturdy innocence!"</p>

<p>I fumed inwardly, for I had no mind to be considered a gaby among
women.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly aware, madam, that it is the fashion for charming
women to turn boys' heads," said I, "and I wish you might turn
Mr. Bevan's head till you twisted it off his neck!"</p>

<p>"I'd rather twist yours," she said, looking up from her plate
of broiled troutlings.</p>

<p>"Twist it off?" I asked, curiously.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I don't know. Look at me, Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>I met her pretty eyes.</p>

<p>"No, not quite off," she said, thoughtfully. "You are a nice
boy, but not very bright. If you were you would pay me compliments
instead of admonition. Perhaps you will after the Madeira. Perhaps
you will even make love to me."</p>

<p>"I will do it before the Madeira," said I. "You are certainly
the prettiest woman in Johnson Hall to-night, and if you've a
mind for vengeance on your faithless dragoon yonder, pray take
me for the instrument, Mrs. Hamilton."</p>

<p>"Hush!" she said, with a startled smile. "I may take you at your
word."</p>

<p>"I am taking you at yours," said I, recklessly, and loud enough
for Silver Heels to hear.</p>

<p>In the dull din of voices around us I heard Silver Heels's laugh,
but the laugh was strained, and I knew she was looking at me and
listening.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," said Mrs. Hamilton, reddening,
"but I know you to be a somewhat indiscreet young man who handles
a woman as he would a club to beat his rival to the earth withal."</p>

<p>"I mean," said I, in a low voice, "to make love to you and so
serve us both. Look at me, Mrs. Hamilton."</p>

<p>"I will not," she said, between her teeth.</p>

<p>"Tell me," I pleaded, "what is your Christian name. I do really
wish to know, Mrs. Hamilton."</p>

<p>Spite of the angry red in her cheeks she laughed outright, glanced
sideways at me, and laughed again, so blithely that I thought
I had truly never seen such careless ripened healthy beauty in
any woman.</p>

<p>"My name is Marie Hamilton, of Saint Sacrement, please you, kind
sir," she lisped, with an affected simper which set us both a-laughing
again.</p>

<p>"If you ever had your heart stormed you had best prepare for
no quarter now!" I said, coolly.</p>

<p>"Insolent!" she murmured, covering her bright cheeks with her
hands, and giving me a glance in which amusement, contempt, curiosity,
and invitation were not inharmoniously blended.</p>

<p>The Madeira had now turned my blood to little rivers of fire,
I being but lately enfranchised from the children's pewters and
small-beer; but yet I am so made that never then nor since have
the delicate vapours of wines stifled such wits as I possess.
It is my conscience only that wine dulls.</p>

<p>So amid the low tumult, the breezy gush of whispers, the laughter,
and the crystal tinkle of silver and glass, I made indiscreet,
clear-headed love to Mistress Marie Hamilton, retreating under
her cruel satire, rallying in the bright battery of her eyes,
charging the citadel of her heart with that insincere and gay
abandon which harasses, disconcerts, and piques a woman who understands
better how to repel true passion.</p>

<p>"In what school have you been taught to make love, sir?" she
said, at last, breathless, amused, yet exasperated.</p>

<p>"In the school of necessity, madam," I replied.</p>

<p>"I pray you teach something of your art to Mr. Bevan," said she,
spitefully, over her fan's silk edge.</p>

<p>"I am teaching him now," said I.</p>

<p>It was true. The dragoon was staring at Mrs. Hamilton in undisguised
displeasure. As for Silver Heels, she observed us with a scornful
amazement which roused all the cruelty in me, though I knew I
was losing her innocent belief in me and tearing my respectability
to shreds under her clear gray eyes.</p>

<p>For a bud from Mrs. Hamilton's caushet I threw away the pure
faith of my little comrade; for a touch of her hand I blighted
her trust; and laughed as I did it.</p>

<p>Only once was Mrs. Hamilton off her guard, when my earnest acting
had suddenly become real to me&mdash;a danger, I have since found,
that no actors are too clever to escape sometimes.</p>

<p>"If for one moment you could be in earnest," she ventured, with
a smile.</p>

<p>I was on guard again before she finished, and she saw it, but
was too wise to betray regret or anger for her mistake.</p>

<p>"Pray, cease," she said; "you weary me, Mr. Cardigan. The coldest
among us reflect fire, even though it be as false as the dead
fires of the moon. You are prettily revenged; let us have peace."</p>

<p>Now the healths flew thick and fast from Sir William and Lord
Dunmore, the titled toast-masters, and we drank his Majesty George
the Third in bumpers which set the Indians a-howling like timber
wolves at Candlemas.</p>

<p>Indeed, our forest of lights might have served for the Romish
feast itself.</p>

<p>Toast followed toast in a tempest of cheers, through which the
yelps of the Indians sounded faintly. I saw Brant take a silver
plate and a solid candle-stick from under Red Jacket's shirt,
while that great orator, very drunk, sat a-hacking the cloth with
a table-knife. I saw my Lord Dunmore, all in white silk and blazing
with stars, rise to pledge the ladies, and stand swaying and leering
and gumming his glass till it upset on his chin, and the jewels
in his lace front dripped wine.</p>

<p>Mistress Molly we pledged with a shout, and she returned our
courtesy with gentle gravity, but her eyes were for Sir William
alone.</p>

<p>Then Lord Dunmore gave:</p>

<p>"Our lovely heiress, Mistress Warren!" ending in a hiccough,
and poor Silver Heels, pale as a white blossom, half rose from
her seat as though to fly to Mistress Molly.</p>

<p>Red Jacket was on his feet now, slavering and mouthing and hacking
at the air, and Brant and I dragged him out into the garden where
his squaw took charge, leading him lurching and howling down the
hill. Before I returned, the ladies were in the hallway and the
card-room, the gentlemen following in groups from the table, some
shamefully unsteady of leg, and feebly scattering snuff in amiable
invitation to their neighbours.</p>

<p>But Sir William had disappeared, and I hunted vainly for him
until I encountered Mrs. Hamilton, who directed me to the library,
whither, she averred, Sir William, Governor Tryon, and Lord Dunmore
had retired.</p>

<p>"State secrets, Master Michael," she added, saucily. "You had
best find Mr. Bevan and start those same lessons we have discussed."</p>

<p>"Let me instruct him by proxy," said I, drawing her under the
stairs, and ere she could protest or escape, I kissed her lips
three separate times.</p>

<p>She was in tears in an instant, which I had not counted on, and
it needed my most earnest acting to subdue her indignation.</p>

<p>I had my arm around her, and my coat was all powder and rouge,
when something made me look around. There was Silver Heels going
towards the pantry with Betty, doubtless to pouch some sweets
for her black nurse. Her head was steadily lowered, her lashes
rested on her cheeks, but face and neck and bosom were glowing
in a deep colour, and I knew she had perceived us, and that she
despised us with all the strength of her innocent soul.</p>

<p>Stunned with the conviction that I had gone too far, I made out
to play my miserable farce to an end and led Mrs. Hamilton out
where Mr. Bevan could pounce upon her, which he did with an insolence
that I had little spirit to notice or resent.</p>

<p>Then I hastened to the pantry where Silver Heels stood before
the rifled dishes, hands to her face, and black Betty a-petting
her. But at sight of me she turned scarlet and shrank back, nor
would she listen to one word.</p>

<p>"What yoh done to mah li'l Miss Honey-bee?" exclaimed Betty,
wrathfully, shaking her turban till the rings in her big ears
jingled like sledge-bells in December. "I done 'spec' yoh, Mars
Ca'digan, suh! Yaas, I 'spec' yoh is lak all de young gemmen!"</p>

<p>Then the old witch began a-crooning over Silver Heels with deadly
glances at me:</p>

<p>"Doan yoh cyah, li'l Miss Honey-bee, doan yoh mind nuff'n! Huh!
Had mah s'picions 'bout dat young Mars Ca'digan. Doan yoh mind
him no moh'n a blue-tail fly!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said I, angrily, "you can do as you choose, and
think what you like. As for your fool of a dragoon, Mrs. Hamilton
will settle him, and if she doesn't I will."</p>

<p>My foolish outburst seemed to rouse a panther in Silver Heels,
and for a moment I believed she meant to strike me. But the storm
swept over, leaving her with limbs a-quiver and eyes wet.</p>

<p>"You have spoiled my first pleasure," she said, in a low, trembling
voice. "You have conducted like a clown and a libertine where
all beheld you making shameful love to a wedded woman! Oh, Betty,
Betty, send him away!" she sobbed, burying her head in the black
woman's breast.</p>

<p>"Silver Heels," I said, choking, "can you not understand that
it is I who wish to wed you?"</p>

<p>Again the panther blazed in her gray eyes, but her lips were
bloodless as she gasped: "Oh, the insult! Betty&mdash;do you hear?
He would marry me out of pity! That is twice he has said it!"</p>

<p>"I said it before because I would not have you marry Mr. Butler,"
said I, wincing at her scorn. "But I say it now because&mdash;because
&mdash;I love you, Silver Heels."</p>

<p>All her horror of me was in her eyes. I saw it and set my teeth
hard, hopeless now forever, even of her careless affection.</p>

<p>And so I left her there, with Betty's arms around her, and the
hot scorn in her eyes. But as I went away, chilled with self-contempt
and mortification, heedless, utterly careless what I did to further
degrade myself in her eyes, came black Betty a-waddling to pluck
me by the sleeve and whisper:</p>

<p>"Doan yoh go to wed wif nobody, Mars Ca'digan, suh! Doan yoh
go foh to co't nobody. Mah li'l chile&mdash;mah li'l Miss Honey-bee
ain't done growed up yet, suh. Bime-by she'll know moh'n she 'specs
'bout gemmens, suh."</p>

<p>But my evil nature was uppermost, and I laughed and bade Betty
mind her own affairs, leaving her there grumbling and mumbling
about "fool boys" and "li'l fool Honey-bees," till the clatter
and din from the card-room shut her voice from my ears.</p>
