<p>We must not forget our young friend, Avon Burnet, who volunteered
so willingly to run every risk for the sake of helping his relatives
out of the most imminent peril of their lives.</p>

<p>At the moment he saw Captain Shirril start forward to smother
the fire, by throwing one of his heavy blankets over it, he lifted
the heavy bolt from its place, and leaned it against the wall
at the side of the door. Having decided on the step, he was wise
in not permitting a minute's unnecessary delay.</p>

<p>He stepped outside in the manner hinted, drawing the door gently
to after him. He did not do this until he saw that the interior
was veiled in impenetrable gloom.</p>

<p>He felt that everything now depended upon his being prompt, unfaltering,
and yet not rash. It may be said that the whole problem was to
learn the right step to take, and then to take it, not an instant
too soon nor too late. That, however, sums up the task of life
itself, and the knowledge was no more attainable in one instance
than in the other.</p>

<p>Finding himself in the outer air, Avon stood a few seconds, striving,
as may be said, to get his bearings. He heard the trampling of
horses' hoofs, several guarded signals passing between the Indians,
and was quite sure he saw the shadowy outlines of a warrior moving
within a few paces of him.</p>

<p>While all this was not calculated to add to his comfort of body
and mind, it was pleasing to the extent that it proved his presence
on the outside was as yet neither known nor suspected. As my friend
Coomer would say, he was standing "With the World Before Him."</p>

<p>But he dare not think he was so much as on the edge of safety
until he reached the mesquite bush, whose location he knew so
well, and whose dark outlines were dimly discernible in front,
and at the distance of only a few rods.</p>

<p>The youth was thinking rapidly and hard. It seemed to him that
the Comanches would naturally keep the closest watch of the front
of the cabin, and, therefore, he was less liable to discovery
if he made a dash from another point.</p>

<p>This conclusion was confirmed by the sudden taking shape of not
only the figure of a horseman, but of a warrior on foot, who approached
at right angles, the two halting in such a manner just before
him that he know it was but momentary, and that they would come
still nearer in a very brief while.</p>

<p>So long as he stood erect, with his back against the side of
the dwelling, he was invisible to anyone who was not almost upon
him. Retaining this posture, and with the rear of his clothing
brushing against the building, he glided softly to the right until
he reached the corner.</p>

<p>At the moment he arrived there, he saw that the horseman had
slipped from his mustang, and he and the other warrior approached
close to the door, where, as it will be remembered, Captain Shirril
heard them talking together in low tones.</p>

<p>This was altogether too near for comfort, and Avon, with the
same noiseless movement, slipped beyond the corner of the house.</p>

<p>As he did so, he felt for an instant that all was over. An Indian
brushed so near that the youth could have touched him by extending
his hand.</p>

<p>How he escaped discovery was more than he could understand. It
must have been that the warrior's attention was so fixed upon
the two figures at the front of the house that he did not glance
to the right or left. Even such an explanation hardly makes clear
the oversight on the part of one belonging to a race proverbial
for its alertness and keen vision.</p>

<p>Before the young man recovered from his shock, he was astounded
by another occurrence a hundred-fold more inexplicable. The profound
stillness was suddenly broken by the ringing report of a rifle
on the other side of the building, accompanied by the wild cry
which caused the listening Captain Shirril and his wife to believe
it meant the death of their devoted nephew.</p>

<p>While the captain committed a grave mistake, for which he was
excusable, Avon was equally at fault, and with as good if not
a better reason. Not dreaming it possible that he could have a
friend near the cabin and on the outside, he supposed the shot
was fired by the captain to create a diversion in his favor.</p>

<p>While such, as the reader knows, was not the case, yet it served
that commendable purpose.</p>

<p>The death-shriek of the stricken Comanche was still in the air,
when, assuming a crouching posture, the youth made a dash for
cover. He expected every moment that other rifles would be fired
and he would be headed off. He could hardly understand it, therefore,
when he felt the bushes strike his face, and he knew that he was
among the mesquite, without suffering harm.</p>

<p>He would have continued his flight, had not the sounds in front
shown that while he had been wonderfully fortunate up to this
point, he had run almost into a group of his enemies.</p>

<p>The dense shadows of the bushes prevented him from seeing them,
else they assuredly would have observed him, but, determined to
go forward now at all hazards, and eager to seize the flimsiest
thread of hope, he sank down on his hands and knees, anxious to
continue his flight, but waiting to learn in what direction it
should be made, if indeed it could be made at all.</p>

<p>There was one hope which he felt he must give up. The possibility
of finding Thunderbolt, and using the matchless steed in his flight
to the camp of the cowboys, had occurred to him more than once,
though it would seem that it was altogether too much to look for
any such good fortune as that.</p>

<p>"If I can only get clear of the parties, who seem to be everywhere,"
was his thought, "I will run all the way to camp and bring the
boys back in a twinkling."</p>

<p>He could have drawn Thunderbolt to him by a single emission of
the well-known signal, but such an attempt would have been the
before the mustang, even if he was not already in their possession,
and the act would secure the capture of rider and steed beyond
peradventure.</p>

<p>"Can it be that my flight is unsuspected?" he asked himself,
while he crouched on the ground, uncertain which way to move,
and yet feeling that something of the kind must be done.</p>

<p>It was useless to speculate, and, since his foes appeared to
be directly in his front, he turned to the right, and began gliding
slowly forward, fearful that the beating of his heart would betray
him at every inch.</p>

<p>But the marvellous good fortune which had attended him thus far
was not quite ready to desert him. With a care and caution beyond
description, he advanced foot by foot until he drew a deep sigh
of relief at the knowledge that that particular group of red men
was no longer in front, but to the left and somewhat to the rear.</p>

<p>"If there are no more," he thought, "it begins to look as if
I might succeed after all."</p>

<p>But his rejoicing was premature. Not only did he catch the sound
of a horse's hoofs, but they were directly before him, and coming
as straight for the spot where he was crouching as if the animal
were following a mathematical line.</p>

<p>One of the Comanches was riding through the mesquite bush, and
if the youth stayed where he was he must be trampled by the mustang,
unless the animal was frightened into leaping aside and thus betraying
him to his master.</p>

<p>"Very well," muttered Avon, "if it comes to <em>that</em>, I
know how to manage you."</p>

<p>As the thought passed through his mind, he reached to his holster
and drew his revolver.</p>

<p>At this moment the steed halted, though he gave no sniff or sign
that he had learned of the stranger so close in front. Believing
a collision inevitable, Avon straightened up, with his weapon
firmly grasped.</p>

<p>But before he could use it the rider slipped to the ground, and
the next moment drew a match along the side of his leggings. As
the tiny flame shone out in the gloom, he held it up in front
of his face to light the cigarette between his lips.</p>
