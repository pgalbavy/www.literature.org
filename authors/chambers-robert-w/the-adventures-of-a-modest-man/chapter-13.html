<p>Well, then, the way that Ellis and Jones met each other&mdash;and
several other things&mdash;was this. It chanced to be in the northern
forests, I believe&mdash;both were fishing, neither knew the other
nor was even aware of their mutual proximity.</p>

<p>Then the wind changed abruptly, blowing now from the south; and
with the change of wind Ellis fancied that he smelled green wood
burning. A few minutes later he was sure of it; he stood knee-deep
in the stream sniffing uneasily, then he lifted his trout-rod,
reeled in his line, and waded silently shoreward, his keen nose
twitching.</p>

<p>Ah! There it was&mdash;that misty bluish bloom belting a clump of
hemlocks. And the acrid odor grew, impregnating the filtered forest
air. He listened, restless eyes searching. The noise of the stream
filled his ears; he tightened the straps of his pack, shortened
his trout rod, leaving line and cast on, and crawled up the ravine,
shoulder-deep in fragrant undergrowth, until the dull clash of
flashing spray and the tumult of the falls were almost lost in
the leafy depths behind.</p>

<p>Ranker, stronger, came the pungent odor of smoke; halting to
listen he heard the hissing whisper of green wood afire; then,
crawling up over an enormous boulder, he saw, just beyond and
below, a man in tweeds, squatting on his haunches, and attempting
to toss a flapjack over a badly constructed camp-fire.</p>

<p>The two young men caught sight of one another at the same instant;
alert, mistrustful, each stared at the other in questioning silence
while the first instinct of unpleasant surprise lasted.</p>

<p>"How are you?" said the man, cautiously.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," replied Ellis. "When the wind turned I scented
your fire down the stream. Thought I'd see what was burning."</p>

<p>"Are you up here fishing?" inquired he of the tweeds.</p>

<p>"Yes; came here by canoe to the forks below. I am out for a week
by myself. The Caranay water is my old-time trail.... Looks like
a storm, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Anything doing with the trout?"</p>

<p>"Not much; two in the falls pool that come an ounce short of
the pound. I should be glad to divide&mdash;if you are shy on trout."</p>

<p>Again they regarded one another carefully.</p>

<p>"My name," said the man by the fire, "is Jones&mdash;but that can't
be helped now. So if you'll overlook such matters I'll be glad
of a trout if you can spare one."</p>

<p>"My name is Ellis; help yourself."</p>

<p>The man by the fire glanced at the burnt flapjack, scraped it
free from the pan, tossed it into the bushes, and straightened
to his full height.</p>

<p>"Come into camp, Mr. Ellis," he said, politely. The freemasonry
of caste operates very quickly in the wilderness; Ellis slid down
the boulder on the re-enforced seat of his knickerbockers, landing,
with hob-nailed shoes foremost, almost at the edge of the fire.
Then he laid his rod aside, slipped the pack to the ground, unslung
his creel, and, fishing out a handkerchief, mopped his sunburnt
countenance.</p>

<p>"Anything else you're short of, Mr. Jones?" he asked, pleasantly.
"I'm just in from the settlements, and I can let you have a pinch
of almost anything."</p>

<p>"Have you plenty of salt?" inquired Jones, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Plenty; isn't there anything else? Bacon? Sugar?"</p>

<p>"Matches?"</p>

<p>Ellis looked at him keenly; good woodsmen don't run short of
matches; good woodsmen don't build such fires.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said. "Did you have an accident?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that is, several boxes got wet, and I've been obliged to
sit around this confounded fire for fear it might go out&mdash;didn't
dare fish very far from it."</p>

<p>He looked gloomily around, rubbed his forehead as though trying
to recollect something, and finally sat down on a log.</p>

<p>"Fact is," he said, "I don't know very much about the woods.
Do you? Everything's gone wrong; I tore my canoe in the Ledge
Rapids yesterday. I'm in a fix."</p>

<p>Ellis laughed; and his laugh was so pleasant, so entirely without
offence, that young Jones laughed, too, for a while, then checked
himself to adjust his eyeglasses, which his mirth had displaced.</p>

<p>"Can you cook?" he asked, so seriously that Ellis only nodded,
still laughing.</p>

<p>"Then, for Heaven's love, would you, when you cook your own breakfast
over that fire, cook enough for two?"</p>

<p>"Why, man, I believe you're hungry," said Ellis, sharply.</p>

<p>"Hungry? Well, I don't know whether you would call it exactly
hunger, because I have eaten several things which I cooked. I
ought not to be hungry; I tried to toss a flapjack, but it got
stuck to the pan. Fact is, I'm a rotten cook, and I guess it's
simply that I'm half starved for a decent meal."</p>

<p>"Why, see here," said Ellis, rising to his feet, "I can fix up
something pretty quick if you like."</p>

<p>"I <em>do</em> like. Yonder is my cornmeal, coffee, some damp
sugar, flour, and what's left of the pork. You see I left it in
a corner of the lean-to, and while I was asleep a porcupine got
busy with it; then I hung it on a tree, and some more porcupines
invited their relatives, and they all climbed up and nearly finished
it. Did you suppose that a porcupine could climb a tree?"</p>

<p>"I've heard so," said Ellis, gravely, busy with the stores which
he was unrolling from his own blanket. The guilelessness of this
stray brother appalled him. Here was a babe in the woods. A new
sort of babe, too, for, in the experience of Ellis, the incompetent
woodsman is ever the loudest-mouthed, the tyro, the most conceited.
But this forest-squatting innocent not only knew nothing of the
elements of woodcraft, but had called a stranger's attention to
his ignorance with a simplicity that silenced mirth, forestalled
contempt, and aroused a curious respect for the unfortunate.</p>

<p>"He is no liar, anyway," thought Ellis, placing a back-log, mending
the fire, emptying the coffee pot, and settling the kettle to
boil. And while he went about culinary matters with a method born
of habit, Jones watched him, aided when he saw a chance; and they
chatted on most animatedly together as the preparations for breakfast
advanced.</p>

<p>"The very first day I arrived in the woods," said Jones, "I fell
into the stream and got most of my matches wet. I've had a devil
of a time since."</p>

<p>"It's a good idea to keep reserve matches in a water-tight glass
bottle," observed Ellis, carelessly, and without appearing to
instruct anybody about anything.</p>

<p>"I'll remember that. What is a good way to keep pork from porcupines?"</p>

<p>Ellis mentioned several popular methods, stirred the batter,
shoved a hot plate nearer the ashes, and presently began the manufacture
of flapjacks.</p>

<p>"Don't you toss 'em?" inquired Jones, watching the process intently.</p>

<p>"Oh, they can be tossed&mdash;like this! But it is easier for me to
turn them with a knife&mdash;like this. I have an idea that they toss
flapjacks less often in the woods than they do in fiction."</p>

<p>"I gathered my idea from a book," said Jones, bitterly; "it told
how to build a fire without matches. Some day I shall destroy
the author."</p>

<p>Presently Jones remarked in a low, intense voice: "Oh, the fragrance
of that coffee and bacon!" which was all he said, but its significance
was pathetically unmistakable.</p>

<p>"Pitch in, man," urged Ellis, looking back over his shoulder.
"I'll be with you in a second." But when his tower of browned
and smoking flapjacks was ready, and he came over to the log,
he found that his host, being his host, had waited. That settled
his convictions concerning Jones; and that was doubtless why,
inside of half an hour, he found himself calling him Jones and
not Mr. Jones, and Jones calling him Ellis. They were a pair of
well knit, clean-limbed young men, throat and face burnt deeply
by wind and sun. Jones did not have much hair; Ellis's was thick
and short, and wavy at the temples. They were agreeable to look
at.</p>

<p>"Have another batch of flapjacks?" inquired Ellis, persuasively.</p>

<p>Jones groaned with satisfaction at the prospect, and applied
himself to a crisp trout garnished with bacon.</p>

<p>"I've tried and tried," he said, "but I cannot catch any trout.
When I found that I could not I was horrified, Ellis, because,
you see, I had supposed that the forest and stream were going
to furnish me with subsistence. Nature hasn't done a thing to
me since I've tried to shake hands with her."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Ellis, "why you came into the woods alone?"</p>

<p>Jones coyly pounced upon another flapjack, folded it neatly and
inserted one end of it into his mouth. This he chewed reflectively;
and when it had vanished according to Fletcher, he said:</p>

<p>"If I tell you why I came here I'll begin to get angry. This
breakfast is too heavenly to spoil. Pass the bacon and help yourself."</p>

<p>Ellis, however, had already satisfied his hunger. He set the
kettle on the coals again, dumped into it cup and plate and fork,
wiped his sheath-knife carefully, and, curling up at the foot
of a hemlock, lighted his pipe, returning the flaming branch to
the back-log.</p>

<p>Jones munched on; smile after smile spread placidly over his
youthful face, dislodging his eyeglasses every time. He resumed
them, and ate flapjacks.</p>

<p>"The first time my canoe upset," he said, "I lost my book of
artificial flies. I brought a box of angle-worms with me, too,
but they fell into the stream the second time I upset. So I have
been trying to snare one of those big trout under the ledge below&#11834;"</p>

<p>Ellis's horrified glance cut him short; he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"My friend, I know it's dead low-down, but it was a matter of
pure hunger with me. At all events, it's just as well that I caught
nothing; I couldn't have cooked it if I had."</p>

<p>He sighed at the last flapjack, decided he did not require it,
and settling down with his back against the log blissfully lighted
his pipe.</p>

<p>For ten minutes they smoked without speaking, dreamily gazing
at the blue sky through the trees. Friendly little forest birds
came around, dropping from twig to branch; two chipmunks crept
into the case of eggs to fill their pouched chops with the oats
that the eggs were packed in. The young men watched them lazily.</p>

<p>"The simpler life is the true existence," commented Ellis, drawing
a long, deep breath.</p>

<p>"What the devil is the simpler life?" demanded Jones, with so
much energy that the chipmunks raced away in mad abandon, and
the flock of black-capped birds scattered to neigbouring branches,
remarking in unison, "<em>Chick-a-dee-dee-dee</em>."</p>

<p>"Why, you're leading the simpler life now," said Ellis, laughing,
"are you not?"</p>

<p>"Am I? No, I'm not. I'm not leading a simple life; I'm leading
a pace-killing, nerve-racking, complex one. I tell you, Ellis,
that it has taken just one week in the woods to reveal to me the
complexity of simplicity!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't like the life?"</p>

<p>"I like it all right, but it's too complex. Listen to me. You
asked me why anybody ever let me escape into the woods. I'll tell
you.... You're a New Yorker, are you not?"</p>

<p>Ellis nodded.</p>

<p>"All right. First look on this picture: I live in the Sixties,
near enough to the Park to see it. It's green, and I like it.
Besides, there are geraniums and other posies in my back yard,
and I can see them when the laundress isn't too busy with the
clothes-line. So much for the <em>mise en scène</em>; me in a
twenty-by-one-hundred house, perfectly contented; Park a stone's
toss west, back yard a few feet north. My habits? Simple enough
to draw tears from a lambkin! I breakfast at nine&mdash;an egg, fruit,
coffee and &mdash;I hate to admit it&mdash;the <em>Sun</em>. At eleven
I go down-town to see if there's anything doing. There never is,
so I smoke one cigar with my partner and then we lunch together.
I then walk uptown&mdash;<em>walk</em>, mind you. At the club I look
at the ticker, or out of the window. Later I play cowboy or billiards
for an hour. I take one cocktail&mdash;<em>one</em>, if you please.
I converse." He waved his pipe; Ellis nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>"Then," continued Jones, "what do I do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Ellis.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. I call a cab&mdash;one taxi, or one hansom, as the
state of the weather may suggest &mdash;I drive through the Park,
pleasantly aware of the verdure, the squirrels, and the babies;
I arrive at my home; I mount to the library and there I select
from my limited collection some accursed book I've always heard
of but have never read&mdash;not fiction, but something stupefying
and worth while. This I read for exactly one hour. I then need
a drink. I then dress; and if I'm dining out, out I go&mdash;if not,
I dine at home. Twice a week I attend the theatre, but I neutralise
that by doing penance at the opera every Monday during the season....
There, Ellis, is the story of a simple life! Look on <em>that</em>
picture. Now look on <em>this</em>: Me in the backwoods, fly-bitten,
smoke-choked, a half-charred flapjack in my fist, a porcupine-gnawed
rind of pork on a stick, attempting to broil the same at a fire,
the smoke of which blinds me. Me, again, belly down, peering hungrily
over the bank of a stream, attempting to snatch a trout with a
bare hook, my glasses slipping off repeatedly, the spectre of
starvation scourging on me. Me, once more, frantic with indigestion
and mosquitoes, lurking under a blanket, the root of a tree bruising
my backbone; me in the morning, done up, shaving in icy water
and cutting my chin; me, half shaved, searching for a scrap of
nourishment, gauntly prowling among cold and greasy fry-pans!
Ellis! <em>Which</em> is the simpler life, in Heaven's name?"</p>

<p>Ellis's laughter was the laughter of a woodsman, full, infectious,
but almost noiseless. The birds came back and teetered on adjacent
twigs, cheeping in friendly unison; a chipmunk, chops distended,
popped up from the case of eggs like a striped jack-in-a-box,
not at all afraid of a man who laughed that way.</p>

<p>"<em>How</em> did you ever come into the woods?" he asked at
length.</p>

<p>"Lunatic friends and fool books persuaded me I was missing something.
I read all about how to tell a woodcock from a peacock; how to
dig holes in the ground and raise little pea vines, and how to
make two blades of grass grow where the laundress had set a devastating
shoe. Then I tired of it. But friends urged me on, and one idiot
said that I looked like the victim of a rare disease and gave
me a shotgun&mdash;whether to shoot myself or the dicky birds I'm not
perfectly certain yet. Besides, as I have a perfect hatred of
taking life, I had no temptation to shoot guides in Maine or niggers
in South Carolina, where the quail come from. Still, I was awake
to the new idea. I read more books on bats and woodchucks; I smelled
every flower I saw; I tried to keep up," he said, earnestly; "by
Heaven, I did my best! And now, look at me! Nature hands me the
frozen mitt!"</p>

<p>Ellis could only laugh, cradling his knees in his clasped and
sun-tanned hands.</p>

<p>"I am fond of Nature; I admire the geraniums in my backyard,"
continued Jones, excitedly. "I like a simple life, too; but I
don't wish to pursue a live thing and eat it for my dinner. The
idea is perfectly obnoxious to me. I like flowers on a table or
in the Park, but I don't want to know their names, or the names
of the creatures that buzz and crawl over them, or the names of
the birds that feed on the buzzy things! I don't; I know I don't,
and I won't! Nature has strung me; I shall knock Nature hereafter.
This is all for mine. I'll lock up and leave the key of the fields
to the next Come-on lured into the good green goods by that most
accomplished steerer, Mrs. Nature. I've got my gilt brick, Ellis
&mdash;I'm going home to buy a card to hang over my desk; and
on it will be the wisest words ever written:</p>

<p>  "'Who's Loony Now?'"</p>

<p>"But, my dear fellow&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, you don't. You're an accomplice of this Nature dame; I can
tell by the way you cook and catch trout and keep your matches
in bottles. One large and brilliant brick is enough for one New
York man. The asphalt for mine&mdash;and a Turkish bath."</p>

<p>After a grinning silence, Ellis arose, stretched, tapped his
pipe against a tree trunk, and sauntered over to where his rod
lay. "Come on; I'll guarantee you a trout in the first reach,"
he said, affably, slipping ferrule into socket, disentangling
the cast and setting the line free.</p>

<p>So they strolled off toward the long amber reach which lay a
few yards below the camp, Jones explaining that he didn't wish
to take life from anything except a mosquito.</p>

<p>"We've got to eat; we'd better stock up while we can, because
it's going to rain," observed Ellis.</p>

<p>"Going to rain? How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I smell it. Besides, look there&mdash;yonder above the mountains.
Do you see the sky behind the Golden Dome?"</p>
