<p>After the departure of Hardman, Jeff explained to Tim why he
had driven him from their company. He told what Frank had seen
when crossing Lake Lindeman, and how the fellow afterward, when
he thought all were asleep within the tent, went out to meet his
confederate.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to turn him loose on the road," added Jeff, "though
I had half a mind to tell him to hunt up his friends and join
them. But he now has the same chance as the rest of us, and must
look out for himself."</p>

<p>"Begorra, but ye are right, Jiff," was the hearty response of
the Irishman. "I'm beginning to suspict that he didn't intind
to give back that money he borrered&mdash;that is, if he should iver
lay hands on the same."</p>

<p>Jeff looked pityingly at his friend; but reading in the expression
of his face that he was jesting, he made no response. Instead,
he spoke impressively:</p>

<p>"You never would have lost that money if you hadn't been in liquor."</p>

<p>"That's the fact, Jiff; but how did ye find it out?"</p>

<p>"My own common sense told me. You've been looking 'round the
last hour for a chance to indulge agin."</p>

<p>"I'll admit," was the frank response, "that a dim idea of the
kind has been flickerin' through me brain; but I cast the timptation
indignantly behind me. Do you know why?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nobody offered to pay for the drinks, and I haven't a cint to
pay for any mesilf."</p>

<p>"And you won't get a cent from me; you must earn it by taking
out gold. If you succeed it'll be yours, and you can do as you
please with it."</p>

<p>Tim removed his cap and scratched his head.</p>

<p>"I've gone a good many wakes without it, and I feel so much better
that I'm thinking of keeping up the good work."</p>

<p>"I hope you will, and prove yourself a man of sense. But we have
no time to waste; we oughter be on our way now."</p>

<p>The sentiment suited all, and was followed without delay. Amid
the crush and hustle it was impossible to hire a horse, mule,
donkey, or boat. Everything had been engaged long before, and
there were hundreds of disappointed applicants who, like our friends,
were obliged to make the tramp eastward on foot, carrying their
utensils with them, and leaving behind all that was not necessary
in the work of placer mining.</p>

<p>During the brief stay at Dawson City the four attentively studied
such maps as they could secure, and gathered all information from
the many who were qualified and willing to give it. As a consequence,
when they started up the Klondike, they had a well-defined idea
of their destination.</p>

<p>The first stream which flows into the river from the southward
is the Bonanza, some twenty-five miles long. This itself has numerous
small tributaries emptying into it; but hearing that all claims
had been located, and not believing it possible that any valuable
ones had been overlooked, they pushed on to Twelve Mile Creek,
also flowing from the south. There the same facts confronted them,
and camping on the road when necessary, our friends finally reached
Too Much Gold Creek, thirty-five miles from Dawson.</p>

<p>Gold-hunters were all around them, and frequently the men and
boys tramped for miles in the company of men whom they had never
seen before; but such a life levels social distinctions, and they
were soon upon as friendly terms as if they had come from Seattle
in company.</p>

<p>At the mouth of Too Much Gold Creek they encountered two grizzly
miners, each mounted on a mule that was so covered with additional
luggage that little besides his head, ears, and forefeet was visible.
They intended to cross the Klondike and prospect on the other
side. Jeff asked whether there was no gold along the creek which
they had just descended.</p>

<p>"It's full of it," was the reply of the elder; "but we're too
late; all the claims have been taken up."</p>

<p>"Did you go to the headwaters?"</p>

<p>"No; we didn't want to waste the time, when all the claims are
gone; there are other places as good as that, and we'll strike
one; so good-by, friends."</p>

<p>Laughing and in high spirits, the two miners struck their boot
heels against the ribs of their mules and were off. It may be
worth recording that both of them struck it rich within the following
week, and a month later started for home rich men.</p>

<p>"It ain't likely," said Jeff, "that there are many claims left
along this river; but there must be some. Anyhow, we'll try it;
I'm sure there are places among those mountains that nobody has
visited."</p>

<p>To the east and south towered a spur of the Rocky Mountains.
It would take hundreds of men a long time thoroughly to explore
their recesses, and it was the intention of the leader to push
in among them. The region resembled that to which he had been
accustomed in California, and he would feel more at home there.</p>

<p>So the wearisome tramp was resumed and continued, with occasional
rests, until late at night. Other parties were continually encountered,
and all had the same story to tell of there not being a foot of
desirable land that was not pre-empted. Some of these people were
returning, but most of them pressed on, hopeful of striking some
spot that was awaiting them.</p>

<p>Encamping under the shelter of a rock, the journey was resumed
early the next morning, and, some twenty miles from the Klondike,
a turn was made eastward among the mountains, which stretch far
beyond the farthest range of vision. They were following a small
stream that showed no signs of having been visited, and by noon
had reached a point where they seemed as much alone as if in the
depths of Africa.</p>

<p>"I guess we may as well try it here," said Jeff, and he began
to unload his pack, in which he was promptly imitated by his companions.
They quickly finished, and sat down for a long rest.</p>

<p>It had been a steady climb almost from the first. But for their
previous severe training the boys would have succumbed, but they
stood it well. The stream which flowed in front of them was little
more than a brook, that seemed to be made by the melting snows
above. It was clear and cold, and they drank deeply from it. Rocks
and bowlders were above, below, in front, and at the rear.</p>

<p>When their utensils and equipage were laid in a pile, Jeff went
off in one direction, Tim in another, while the boys plunged deeper
into the mountains, all engaged in prospecting as best they could.
Inasmuch as the boys had never had any experience in that sort
of work, their only chance of success was through accident.</p>

<p>They followed up the stream, as nearly as they could judge, for
about an eighth of a mile, still among the huge rocks, when they
sat down to rest.</p>

<p>"We may as well go back," cried Roswell, "for Jeff and Tim are
the only ones who know when they have come upon signs of gold;
we may have passed a half-dozen places where it can be taken out
by the bushel&mdash;"</p>

<p>Frank touched his cousin's arm and indicated by a nod of his
head a pile of rocks a few rods away and a short distance above
them. Looking thither, they saw the head and shoulders of a man
intently studying them. When he found he was observed he lowered
his head and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" asked Frank, in an undertone.</p>

<p>"No; I never saw him before."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have. He crossed Lake Lindeman with us. He's the one
that signalled to Hardman and afterward met him at night outside
of our tent."</p>
