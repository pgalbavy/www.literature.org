<P>
A gleam of day was in the sky as Hamel, with Mrs.  Fentolin by his
side, passed along the path which led from the Tower to St. David's
Hall.  Lights were still burning from its windows; the outline of
the building itself was faintly defined against the sky.  Behind
him, across the sea, was that one straight line of grey merging
into silver.   The rain had ceased and the wind had dropped.  On
either side of them stretched the brimming creeks.
<P>
"Can we get into the house without waking any one?" he asked.
<P>
"Quite easily," she assured him.  "The front door is never barred."
<P>
She walked by his side, swiftly and with surprising vigour.  In the
still, grey light, her face was more ghastly than ever, but there
was a new firmness about her mouth, a new decision in her tone.
They reached the Hall without further speech, and she led the way
to a small door on the eastern side, through which they entered
noiselessly and passed along a little passage out into the hall.
A couple of lights were still burning.  The place seemed full of
shadows.
<P>
"What are you going to do now?" she whispered.
<P>
"I want to ring up London on the telephone," he replied.  "I know
that there is a detective either in the neighbourhood or on his
way here, but I shall tell my friend that he had better come down
himself."
<P>
She nodded.
<P>
"I am going to release Esther," she said.  "She is locked in her
room.  The telephone is in the study.  I will come down there to
you."
<P>
She passed silently up the broad staircase.  Hamel groped his way
across the hail into the library.  He turned on the small electric
reading-lamp and drew up a chair to the side of the telephone.  Even
as he lifted the receiver to his ear, he looked around him half
apprehensively.  It seemed as though every moment he would hear the
click of Mr. Fentolin's chair.
<P>
He got the exchange at Norwich without difficulty, and a few minutes
later a sleepy reply came from the number he had rung up in London.
It was Kinsley's servant who answered.
<P>
"I want to speak to Mr. Kinsley at once upon most important
business," Hamel announced.
<P>
"Very sorry, sir," the man replled.  "Mr. Kinsley left town last
night for the country."
<P>
"Where has he gone?" Hamel demanded quickly.  "You can tell me.
You know who I am; I am Mr. Hamel."
<P>
"Into Norfolk somewhere, sir.  He went with several other gentlemen."
<P>
"Is that Bullen?" Hamel asked.
<P>
The man admitted the fact.
<P>
"Can you tell me if any of the people with whom Mr. Kinsley left
London were connected with the police?" he inquired.
<P>
The man hesitated.
<P>
"I believe so, sir," he admitted.  "The gentlemen started in a
motor-car and were going to drive all night."
<P>
Hamel laid down the receiver.  At any rate, he would not be left
long with this responsibility upon him.  He walked out into the hall.
The house was still wrapped in deep silence.  Then, from somewhere
above him, coming down the stairs, he heard the rustle of a woman's
gown.  He looked up, and saw Miss Price, fully dressed, coming
slowly towards him.  She held up her finger and led the way back
into the library.  She was dressed as neatly as ever, but there
was a queer light in her eyes.
<P>
"I have seen Mrs. Seymour Fentolin," she said.  "She tells me that
you have left Mr.  Fentolin and the others in the subterranean room
of the Tower."
<P>
Hamel nodded.
<P>
"They have Dunster down there," he told her.  "I followed them in;
it seemed the best thing to do.  I have a friend from London who is
on his way down here now with some detective officers, to enquire
into the matter of Dunster's disappearance."
<P>
"Are you going to leave them where they are until these people
arrive?" she asked.
<P>
"I think so," he replied, after a moment's hesitation.  "I don't
seem to have had time to consider even what to do.  The opportunity
came, and I embraced it.  There they are, and they won't dare to
do any further harm to Dunster now.  Mrs. Fentolin was down in my
room, and I thought it best to bring her back first before I even
parleyed with them again.
<P>
" You must be careful," she advised slowly.  The man Dunster has
been drugged, he has lost some of his will; he may have lost some
of his mental balance.  Mr. Fentolin is clever.  He will find a
dozen ways to wriggle out of any charge that can be brought against
him.  You know what he has really done?"
<P>
"I can guess."
<P>
"He has kept back a document signed by the twelve men in America
who control the whole of Wall Street, who control practically the
money markets of the world.  That document is a warning to Germany
that they will have no war against England.  Owing to Mr. Fentolin,
it has not been delivered, and the Conference is sitting now.  War
may be declared at any moment."
<P>
"But as a matter of common sense," Hamel asked, "why does Mr.
Fentolin desire war?"
<P>
"You do not understand Mr.  Fentolin," she told him quietly.  "He
is not like other men.  There are some who live almost entirely for
the sake of making others happy, who find joy in seeing people
content and satisfied.  Mr.  Fentolin is the reverse of this.  He
has but one craving in life: to see pain in others.  To see a human
being suffer is to him a debauch of happiness.  A war which laid
this country waste would fill him with a delight which you could
never understand.  There are no normal human beings like this.  It
is a disease in the man, a disease which came upon him after his
accident."
<P>
"Yet you have all been his slaves," Hamel said curiously.
<P>
"We have all been his slaves," she admitted, "for different reasons.
Before his accident came, Mr. Fentolin was my master and the only
man in the world for me.  After his accident, I think my feelings
for him, if anything, grew stronger.  I became his slave.  I sold
my conscience, my self-respect, everything in life worth having, to
bring a smile to his lips, to help him through a single moment of
his misery.  And just lately the reaction has come.  He has played
with me just as he would sit and pull the legs out of a spider to
watch its agony.  I have been one of his favourite amusements.  And
even now, if he came into this room I think that I should be
helpless.  I should probably fall at his feet and pray for
forgiveness."
<P>
Hamel looked at her wonderingly.
<P>
"I have come down to warn you," she went on.  "It is possible that
this is the beginning of the end, that his wonderful fortune will
desert him, that his star has gone down.  But remember that he has
the brains and courage of genius.  You think that you have him in
a trap.  Don't be surprised, when you go back, to find that he has
turned the tables upon you."
<P>
"Impossible!" Hamel declared.  "I looked all round the place.  There
isn't a window or opening anywhere.  The trap-door is in the middle
of the ceiling and it is fifteen feet from the floor.  It shuts
with a spring."
<P>
"It may be as you say," she observed.  "It may be that he is safe.
Remember, though, if you go near him, that he is desperate."
<P>
"Do you know where Miss Fentolin is?" he interrupted.
<P>
"She is with her mother," the woman replied, impatiently.  "She is
coming down.  Tell me, what are you going to do with Mr. Fentolin?
Nothing else matters."
<P>
"I have a friend," Hamel answered, "who will see to that."
<P>
"If you are relying upon the law," she said, "I think you will find
that the law cannot touch him.  Mr.  Dunster was brought to the
house in a perfectly natural manner.  He was certainly injured, and
injured in a railway accident.  Doctor Sarson is a fully qualified
surgeon, and he will declare that Mr. Dunster was unfit to travel.
If necessary, they will have destroyed `the man's intelligence.  If
you think that you have him broken, let me warn you that you may be
disappointed.  Let me, if I may, give you one word of advice."
<P>
"Please do," Hamel begged.
<P>
She looked at him coldly.  Her tone was still free from any sort of
emotion.
<P>
"You have taken up some sort of position here," she continued, "as
a friend of Mrs. Seymour Fentolin, a friend of the family.  Don't
let them come back under the yoke.  You know the secret of their
bondage?"
<P>
"I know it," he admitted.
<P>
"They have been his slaves because their absolute obedience to his
will was one of the conditions of his secrecy.  He has drawn the
cords too tight.  Better let the truth be known, if needs be, than
have their three lives broken.  Don't let them go back under his
governance.  For me, I cannot tell.  If he comes back, as he will
come back, I may become his slave again, but let them break away.
Listen - that is Mrs.  Fentolin."
<P>
She left him.  Hamel followed her out into the hail.  Esther and
her mother were already at the foot of the stairs.  He drew them
into the study.  Esther gave him her hands, but she was trembling
in every limb.
<P>
"I am terrified!" she whispered.  "Every moment I think I can hear
the click of that awful carriage.  He will come back; I am sure he
will come back!"
<P>
"He may," Hamel answered sturdily, "but never to make you people
his slaves again.  You have done enough.  You have earned your
freedom."
<P>
"I agree," Mrs.  Fentolin said firmly.  "We have gone on from
sacrifice to sacrifice, until it has become a habit with us to
consider him the master of our bodies and our souls.  To-day,
Esther, we have reached the breaking point.  Not even for the sake
of that message from the other side of the grave, not even to
preserve his honour and his memory, can we do more."
<P>
Hamel held up his finger.  He opened the French windows, and they
followed him out on to the terrace.  The grey dawn had broken now
over the sea.  There were gleams of fitful sunshine on the marshes.
Some distance away a large motor-car was coming rapidly along the
road.
