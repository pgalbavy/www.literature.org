<p>It was precisely as one might have given the command of attack to a dog,
and under the sting of indignity, my reason once more slipped from me. I
dived for Dawson and saw him reel backward under the blow I planted on
his sneering mouth, but at the same instant the second pair of arms went
round me from behind. Bud had "taken hold" of me and I am forced to say
he did it with the effective enthusiasm of an octopus. I fancy that had
there been an audience, that would have been pronounced a good fight.
Sometimes the three of us swayed from side to side of the road in a
triangular wrestling match; sometimes we rolled about and clawed at each
other on the ground.
</p><p>The moon had set and between gasping breaths, out of sweat-blinded and
battered eyes, I was occasionally conscious of a steel-blue sky in which
the stars seemed to dance about and of unsteady silhouetted trees. But
I was more sensible of the cruel ruttiness of the road on which our
feet slipped and our ankles twisted. Curt Dawson was one of those
rough-and-tumble battlers who laugh as they fight. His companion kept up
a running string of muttered curses, but both of them were strong,
wolf-like huskies of tireless sinews and savage determination. There
was, of course, no fairness of combat, but I had the advantage of trying
to kill while they were fighting to take me alive, though with odds of
two to one. I suppose it did not last long, but it seemed to me as
interminable as the wars of Valhalla. I was very dizzy and nauseated
from their kicks in the stomach and blind from blood that ran down out
of a cut in my forehead--Curt Dawson wore a heavy ring--still I had the
satisfaction of seeing that "Bud" was badly lamed, possibly from a
twisted ankle, and that the gun-fighter himself was far from fresh. At
last Garvin's head villain came into a clinch with his arms about me and
under his vice-like grip I felt my ribs creaking. Bud thought me whipped
and had drawn off for a moment of much-needed rest. Then I got my hands
up and had the satisfaction of feeling my fingers close on Dawson's
throat. The touch of flesh in my grasp seemed to rally my ebbing
strength and I closed down with all the vicious force I could muster,
until my nails sunk deep under the skin and his own arms relaxed and his
agonized breath rattled in his windpipe. We went down locked together,
but my grasp at his throat held, and as we rolled and wallowed I found
myself on top and gripped the harder. I knew only one desire--to choke
the last breath from his lungs, and I should have accomplished it had
not the second man recognized the situation in time. If I had been
fighting sanely I might have risen in time to meet him, and in his
condition could have disposed of him, but I had forgotten his existence
and remembered only the enemy upon whose chest my knee was pressing and
whose life was fast waning under my ten clinging fingers. The mania to
kill with bare hands is strong when it has once obsessed, and the second
feudist found it an easy thing in my absorbed condition to throw his
handkerchief about my neck and strangle me first into helplessness and
finally into unconsciousness.
</p><p>I came to my senses lying at the roadside, trussed up like a pig being
taken to market. On either side of me lay my captors stretched at full
length and resting, though a line of gray over the eastern peaks bespoke
the coming of dawn, and a thin ribbon of rosy pinkness was edging the
gray at the margin of the morning.
</p><p>When I endeavored to rise Curt Dawson also sat up and gazed at me. His
face wore scars that gave me a moment of sincere pleasure, and he found
only one eye available for his scrutiny. His open shirt showed upon his
neck the deep-written autograph of my finger nails, but his lips wore a
grin as he reached for his broad-brimmed felt hat and placed it on the
back of his head.
</p><p>"Well, stranger," he drawled as good naturedly as though our combat had
partaken only of elements of friendly sport, "I want ter name it to yer
that you ain't noways er cripple in er fight. I told yer yer'd haf' ter
come along, an' I reckon I was about right. Ef yer ready ter ride we'll
heave yer up an' hike."
</p><p>"What are you going to do with me?" I demanded.
</p><p>"We'll figger on that by an' by," he assured me; "the fust thing we do
will be plum friendly. We'll take yer where yer kin git a drink of
licker."
</p><p>I found that prospect grateful, for from head to foot I ached with
bruises and a great weakness possessed me, but I did not propose to
submit tamely at any point.
</p><p>"I don't see how you are to keep me out of court unless you kill me," I
suggested, "and if you are going to kill me you've got to do it here and
now."
</p><p>"What fer?" he queried with his tantalizing coolness. "Ef we're ergoin'
ter kill yer, I reckon we'll pick our own time and place. But mebby we
won't haf ter."
</p><p>He rose indolently and came over with an effort to conceal the hobble of
a limp, and propping my bound body against his knee proceeded to wrap
his blue cotton bandana around my eyes. This being accomplished to his
satisfaction, the two of them loosened my ankles and raised me to one of
the saddles, leaving my hands fast bound, and passing straps around my
legs. Then Dawson mounted behind me, holding me in place, for I found
myself reeling feebly and in danger of collapse. The other man led the
horse that carried the double burden and we started on a journey of
which I have no clear remembrance, since from time to time I drifted
into a condition bordering on unconsciousness.
</p><p>It was full daylight but still very early when they took me from the
saddle, and of course I had no idea of the road by which we had come or
the country through which we had passed. The blindfold was not removed
until we had entered a house and I had been helped up a steep stairway
and laid on a bare, corn-shuck mattress. Then I was allowed to look on
the bare walls of a loft-like room. The mattress was stretched on the
floor; a tin basin surmounted a box. Otherwise there were no furnishings
of any sort. Dawson was grinning down on me with a stone jug supported
in the crotch of his right elbow and a tin cup in his left hand.
</p><p>"Say when, stranger," he invited as he began to pour the white whiskey.
"This here is your domicile fer ther present time. Yer victuals will be
along presently." At the door he paused and looked back. "Ef yer needs
anything," he added, "kick like hell on the flo'. They ain't nobody
here that minds a little noise. The latch string hangs outside, but yer
kin see fer yerself there ain't none on this side the do'."
</p><p>I was for an hour satisfied to lie quietly on the mattress and rest and
after they had brought me a meal of cold bread, greasy bacon and coffee,
I continued inactive except for thinking. The trial was two days off and
the least hardship I need expect would be imprisonment until it was
over. After that I was at a loss to forecast their designs. Even then I
could not be set free to tell my story, but I felt sure that nothing
would be done until the arch-conspirator and dictator, Jim Garvin
himself, had been consulted and had issued his imperial decree.
</p><p>Shortly before noon I heard footsteps on the stairs, and since one set
of feet came with the creaking caution of a person who did not wish to
be heard, I feigned sleep and breathed with a deep regularity that was
almost a snore. The door opened and Dawson entered. By this time I knew
his delicate tread. He crossed the room and looked at me for a while,
bending low down to listen to my breathing. I did not stir nor open my
eyes and after a time he went again to the door and announced in a
carefully guarded voice, "He's asleep all right enough."
</p><p>There was no reply, so my straining ears, seeking to do duty also for
the eyes I dared not open, could make no identification, but my face was
turned toward the door and some inner sense declared to me with
insistent conviction that the silent visitor was no other than the
county judge himself. Finally Dawson turned and I counted his steps
until they stopped, as I presumed, at his companion's side. At that
juncture, and with infinite caution I stole a momentary peep between
closely drawn lids, and the brief glimpse revealed the broad back and
shoulders of the man who had so affably chatted with us at the store on
the day when Weighborne and myself had arrived. Even in so cursory a
survey, I knew that I was taking a decided risk, but it seemed
necessary.
</p><p>My room never had more than a half-light, which filtered through shutter
slats so slanted that I could see nothing between them save the sky and
a few stark sycamore branches. Consequently I lay in comparative
darkness while they were etched against the full light of the partly
open door. Now, should I regain my liberty--a thing highly improbable--I
could testify that Garvin himself had knowledge of my imprisonment.
</p><p>Outside my door there was silence and I told myself that they were
listening. My simulated sleeping breath stole out to them and reassured
them, for finally I heard Garvin's low voice. "That's the man," he said.
"Just keep him here till I let you know what to do." Then their
descending footsteps on the stairs drowned the words and I was once more
alone.
</p><p>The next day Dawson and his understrapper, "Bud," whose last name I had
never learned, permitted me to accompany them to the lower floor of the
house and a somewhat larger measure of freedom.
</p><p>Among the many activities of his young life, Mr. Dawson had at one time
enjoyed that expression of public confidence which is dear to the
mountain man. He had held office as a deputy sheriff. That honor had
been short-lived, but as a memento of his days of power he retained a
very good pair of heavy nickeled handcuffs, and when I was made free of
the lower floor these ornaments adorned my wrists. The connecting chain
was long enough to give my hands a limited scope. My two jailers and
myself beguiled an hour or two with a game of casino, and I was able to
shuffle the cards when the deal fell to me, but the manacles were
sufficiently hampering to give them a sense of entire security.
</p><p>I welcomed with some eagerness an opportunity to visualize my
environment, since there was now only one day left before the calling of
the Marcus cases on the county court docket, and if I was to learn
anything which might facilitate my escape it must be shortly
accomplished.
</p><p>I presumed that I had been brought to some remote and isolated point in
the hills, and that even if I could rid myself of handcuffs and
guardians, there still lay ahead of me the problem of a journey,
probably a long one, through an unknown country.
</p><p>I had still much to learn, and one of the things which did not occur to
me, but which time made clear, was that Garvin never played his game
twice in the same fashion. He had known that my disappearance would wake
into frantic activity the smaller, but no less vigilant force of private
investigators who served Cal Marcus. All the inaccessible hiding places
in the heart of the timbered hills would be under espionage. He
accordingly decided that the best method of keeping me under cover would
be somewhat similar to that of the man in the story who knew his rooms
were to be searched for a document he sought to conceal, and who adopted
the method of putting it in full sight on the mantel shelf, where the
searchers into corners and secret places did not take the trouble to
open its envelope.
</p><p>I had, in fact, been brought to a cabin which, although it nestled in a
deep gorge a half-mile from the public road, and was invisible to
passers-by, was still less than a mile and a quarter from the town
itself. These things I was to discover on the morning of the trial when,
feeling secure that it was now too late for me to avail myself of the
information, Curt Dawson yielded to the temptation of informing me just
how fully I had been stung.
</p><p>But on my first visit to the ground floor I saw little that added to my
knowledge. For months the place had palpably been swept by winds and
battered by hail, tenantless and dilapidated. Indeed, the loft where I
had been confined was more habitable than the lower floor. I at once
recognized that they meant to leave the cabin with its air of desertion
unchanged, so that any straggling investigator would pass it by with
unaroused curiosity. There were two rooms, and the walls were vulnerable
to windy gusts through cracks between rotting logs. The windows were
glassless and an insufficient heat came from a fire which burned feebly
on an open and smoke-blackened hearth. My two jailers rose constantly to
fall back shivering on the jug of moonshine. There was no sign of beds
or furniture of any sort. Until we arrived there the house had been
abandoned.
</p><p>Dawson permitted me to walk to the door and look out. The morning was
gray and chilling. A slight rise in temperature had brought cold
moisture and under a raw sky the hills stretched up all about us in
reeking veils of foggy desolation. I saw only rattling weed stalks
feeding on the decayed skeleton of what had been a fence-line before the
days of abandonment, and a basin choked with volunteer timber, around
which the hill-sides rose like a spite-fence, cutting off whatever lay
beyond. A small front porch had graced the cabin in earlier times, but
of that there now remained only one upright, and a few broken planks. I
tried to locate the stable, but there was no evidence of any outhouse
except some charred and over-grown timbers. Palpably the mountaineers
had not kept their horses with them. If I escaped I must do so on foot.
