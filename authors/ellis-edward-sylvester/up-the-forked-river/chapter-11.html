<p>Since every one in tropical America called Warrenia Rowland by
the surname of Major Jack Starland and the two were accepted as
brother and sister we will do the same for the present, and thus
avoid possible confusion.</p>

<p>These two had been on the Forked River but a short time, when
they awoke to a most unpleasant fact, in addition to that which
has already been mentioned. While the climate was wholesome enough
to those accustomed to it, it was highly dangerous to visitors.
The air was damp, oppressive and miasmatic, probably because of
the rank vegetation that grew everywhere. Still further, the insect
pests were intolerable at times. Several cases of illness among
the crew of the yacht, though fortunately none was fatal, alarmed
Aunt Cynthia and caused some uneasiness on the part of Major Starland,
as well as of Captain Winton. In the circumstances, the Major
felt warranted in urging the plea of business as a legitimate
one for haste in leaving the detestable country.</p>

<p>It has been intimated that after Miss Starland had been delivered
over to her dearest friend, the yacht dropped down the river to
Zalapata, and left Jack there. Captain Winton, who was a cousin
of Aunt Cynthia, intended to steam some twenty miles farther eastward
to the city of San Luis, where a few needed supplies would be
taken aboard. Then the boat would return to Zalapata for its owner,
and continue on to Atlamalco, there to receive the young woman
for the homeward voyage.</p>

<p>Major Jack Starland was considerate enough to decide to remain
most of the time at the capital of General Bambos, knowing the
school mates would wish to devote the all too-brief period to
each other. Consequently he would only be in the way. The Major
gave no specific instructions to Captain Winton, but left much
to his discretion. It was intimated to him that he might return
to Atlamalco in the course of a few days,&mdash;an elastic term which
might be halved or doubled without any blame attaching to the
skipper.</p>

<p>General Bambos was delighted for the time with the companionship
of a man who had received the thorough military training of his
visitor. Ignorant as most of the prominent South Americans are,
the majority have heard of West Point, and all know something
of the courage and achievements of the greatest nation in all
the world. The General consulted often with his guest and Major
Starland never did, or rather never attempted to do, a more praiseworthy
thing than when he strove to impress upon the bulky Dictator the
folly and crime of war.</p>

<p>"It was truthfully characterized by our General Sherman as 'hell';
it has been the curse of the ages and brought misery and death
to millions, besides turning back the hands on the dial of progress
for centuries. Shun it as you would the pestilence that stalks
at noonday."</p>

<p>Such discourse is thrown away upon the South American leader
to whom revolutions are as the breath of his life. General Bambos
blandly smiled and cordially agreed with the wise sentiments,
but laid the blame eternally on the other fellow. If <em>he</em>
would only do that which is just, wars would cease and blessed
peace would brood forever over all nations and peoples.</p>

<p>Major Starland took another tack. There had been hostilities
between Zalapata and Atlamalco in the past, with no special advantage
accruing to either side. On the whole perhaps the latter Republic
had been the gainer, since the last treaty ceded to General Yozarro
a small strip of territory on which <em>Castillo Descanso</em>
stood, the same having been a bone of contention for a long time.</p>

<p>The purchase of a tugboat by General Yozarro had unquestionably
tipped the scales in his favor. The American did his best to show
Bambos this fact and to warn him that in case of another war between
the republics, Zalapata was sure to be the chief sufferer. Bambos
could not gainsay this and he was now seeking to balance things,
by floating a loan which was to be used in arming his troops with
modern weapons. He made a tempting offer to Major Starland to
enter his service, agreeing to pay him an enormous salary in gold,
though one might well question where he was to obtain a fractional
part of it, and to place him in supreme command of the military
forces of the Republic.</p>

<p>While the American was illimitably the superior in mentality
to the gross Dictator, he failed to perceive an important truth,
which did not become clear to him until after his plain talk with
Captain Guzman. The great object of the obese nuisance in warring
against Yozarro was to place Miss Starland under deep obligations
to him, though he was too cunning to intimate anything of that
nature. When Jack Starland kindly but firmly declined his offer,
he feared that he would become an obstacle to his scheme; and
although he hid any such feeling, he would have been glad to have
him disappear from the stage of action. What galled Bambos was
the fact that the American lady was the guest of his rival, who
he knew would do his utmost to woo and win her. To bring to naught
anything of that nature, he determined to wage war against Yozarro
and shatter the opportunity that fortune had placed in the hands
of that detested individual. It cannot be said that the logic
of Bambos was of the best, but it must be remembered that the
gentle passion plays the mischief with numskulls as well as with
men of wisdom.</p>

<p>Such in brief was the situation, when Major Jack Starland yielded
to his growing unrest over the visit of his sister to her friend.
He had learned that General Yozarro was a widower&mdash;though as in
the case of Bambos that would have made little difference in his
wayward promptings&mdash;and he decided that it would be well to shorten
the visit of Miss Starland or to bear her company, so long as
she stayed in Atlamalco. He would be welcomed by the young women
themselves, and, although Yozarro might wish him to the uttermost
parts of the earth, he, too, would be gracious. So the sail of
the American and Captain Guzman up the forked river becomes clear
to the reader.</p>

<p>Never was mortal man more infatuated with woman than was General
Yozarro, from the moment he first laid eyes on the "Flower of
the North," as he poetically named her. His passion was too absorbing
to be concealed, and in the sanctity of their apartments the niece
rallied her friend on the conquest she had made.</p>

<p>"But it is the very one I do not wish to make," protested the
annoyed American; "I like General Yozarro, chiefly because he
is your relative, but absolutely my feeling can never go beyond
that."</p>

<p>"I thought your heart had not wandered elsewhere."</p>

<p>"It has not, and it can never pass to him, my dear Manuela."</p>

<p>"May I not say that you might go farther and fare worse? He is
one of the kindest-hearted of men, is wealthy and would always
be your slave."</p>

<p>"You name the very quality I cannot tolerate in the one whom
I love; I care nothing for wealth, for I do not need it; I want
no man to be my slave, and I shall never marry any one who is
not an American like myself."</p>

<p>"But many of your young women marry titles abroad."</p>

<p>"And too often hate themselves afterward for doing so. Misery
and wretchedness generally follow, for there is something unnatural
in such a union, with nothing of love on either side. Then, too,
your uncle is double my age, and it is impossible&mdash;utterly impossible
for me to return any affection on his part, if it really exists."</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of <em>that</em>," replied the impulsive
Atlamalcan, throwing her arms around her friend and affectionately
kissing her. "Be assured I shall never urge you to do anything
contrary to your own pure nature. More than that, I shall take
the first opportunity to impress upon General Yozarro the hopelessness
of any love he may feel toward you."</p>

<p>"That is just like your true self!" exclaimed the American, returning
the ardent caresses of her friend; "my stay with you is to be
too brief to allow any such cloud to come between us. Much as
I hate to cause you distress, Manuela, I shall not stay another
day if he persists in forcing his attentions upon me."</p>

<p>"Have no fear of that. He is too good, too considerate, too honorable
to bring pain to any one. He will be grieved when I tell him the
truth, as I shall lose no time in doing, and will hasten to repair
the injustice. So let us kiss again, and say and think no more
about it."</p>

<p>True to her promise, Se√±orita Estacardo took the first occasion
to explain frankly the situation to her uncle. He listened thoughtfully,
admitted his grief that his new-born hope should be crushed, but
declared he would accept the facts like an honorable man and take
every pains that their visitor should not be annoyed in any way
by him.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more delightful than the few days that
followed. General Yozarro took his niece and her friend on several
voyages down the Rio Rubio, and far enough westward to give her
glimpses of the magnificent fauna and flora of that interesting
region. There were times when the exuberance of vegetation and
foliage, the sweep of the mighty waters, and the superabundance
of animal life filled her with awe and a certain fear, but her
wonder never abated. The guns on the craft were fired several
times for her entertainment, but the General prudently refrained
from pointing out the target until he had made sure where the
missile had struck, when he found no difficulty in doing so.</p>

<p>No knight of the Crusades could have been more attentive to her
slightest wish. Indeed he was so gracious and thoughtful that
she felt at times a certain compunction. She wished she could
give her affection to one who possessed so many admirable qualities,
but compressing her lips, she shook her head and said again and
again: "It can never be."</p>

<p>Now and then spots showed on the sun. She caught glimpses of
the volcano-like nature of the man, when some of the crew or his
people displeased him. She was horrified to overhear some words
which made known the shooting of the brother of Martella for a
trifling fault, and she learned, too, of Yozarro's ferocious cruelties
to others, including some who had been taken prisoners in honorable
warfare. Underneath that suave, smiling exterior lurked Satan
himself.</p>
