<p>At six o'clock came the inquiry of the soldiers:  Had anything been
seen of Bachmann?  Fr&auml;ulein Hesse answered, pleased to be playing a
r&ocirc;le:</p>

<p>&quot;No, I've not seen him since Sunday - have you, Emilie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I haven't seen him,&quot; said Emilie, and her awkwardness was
construed as bashfulness.  Ida Hesse, stimulated, asked questions,
and played her part.</p>

<p>&quot;But it hasn't killed Sergeant Huber?&quot; she cried in consternation.</p>

<p>&quot;No.  He fell into the water.  But it gave him a bad shock, and
smashed his foot on the side of the moat.  He's in hospital.  It's
a bad look-out for Bachmann.&quot;</p>

<p>Emilie, implicated and captive, stood looking on.  She was no
longer free, working with all this regulated system which she could
not understand and which was almost god-like to her.  She was put
out of her place.  Bachmann was in her room, she was no longer the
faithful in service serving with religious surety.</p>

<p>Her situation was intolerable to her.  All evening long the burden
was upon her, she could not live.  The children must be fed and put
to sleep.  The Baron and Baroness were going out, she must give
them light refreshment.  The man-servant was coming in to supper
after returning with the carriage.  And all the while she had the
insupportable feeling of being out of the order, self-responsible,
bewildered.  The control of her life should come from those above
her, and she should move within that control.  But now she was out
of it, uncontrolled and troubled.  More than that, the man, the
lover, Bachmann, who was he, what was he?  He alone of all men
contained for her the unknown quantity which terrified her beyond
her service.  Oh, she had wanted him as a distant sweetheart, not
close, like this, casting her out of her world.</p>

<p>When the Baron and Baroness had departed, and the young manservant
had gone out to enjoy himself, she went upstairs to Bachmann.  He
had wakened up, and sat dimly in the room.  Out in the open he
heard the soldiers, his comrades, singing the sentimental songs of
the nightfall, the drone of the concertina rising in accompaniment.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;Wenn ich zu mei . . . nem Kinde geh' . . .<br />
 In seinem Au . . . g die Mutter seh'. . . .&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>But he himself was removed from it now.  Only the sentimental cry
of young, unsatisfied desire in the soldiers' singing penetrated
his blood and stirred him subtly.  He let his head hang; he had
become gradually roused: and he waited in concentration, in another
world.</p>

<p>The moment she entered the room where the man sat alone, waiting
intensely, the thrill passed through her, she died in terror, and
after the death, a great flame gushed up, obliterating her.  He sat
in trousers and shirt on the side of the bed.  He looked up as she
came in, and she shrank from his face.  She could not bear it.  Yet
she entered near to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you want anything to eat?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered, and as she stood in the twilight of the room
with him, he could only hear his heart beat heavily.  He saw her
apron just level with his face.  She stood silent, a little
distance off, as if she would be there for ever.  He suffered.</p>

<p>As if in a spell she waited, standing motionless and looming there,
he sat rather crouching on the side of the bed.  A second will in
him was powerful and dominating.  She drew gradually nearer to him,
coming up slowly, as if unconscious.  His heart beat up swiftly.
He was going to move.</p>

<p>As she came quite close, almost invisibly he lifted his arms and
put them round her waist, drawing her with his will and desire.  He
buried his face into her apron, into the terrible softness of her
belly.  And he was a flame of passion intense about her.  He had
forgotten.  Shame and memory were gone in a whole, furious flame of
passion.</p>

<p>She was quite helpless.  Her hands leapt, fluttered, and closed
over his head, pressing it deeper into her belly, vibrating as she
did so.  And his arms tightened on her, his hands spread over her
loins, warm as flame on her loveliness.  It was intense anguish of
bliss for her, and she lost consciousness.</p>

<p>When she recovered, she lay translated in the peace of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was what she had had no inkling of, never known could be.  She
was strong with eternal gratitude.  And he was there with her.
Instinctively with an instinct of reverence and gratitude, her arms
tightened in a little embrace upon him who held her thoroughly
embraced.</p>

<p>And he was restored and completed, close to her.  That little,
twitching, momentary clasp of acknowledgment that she gave him in
her satisfaction, roused his pride unconquerable.  They loved each
other, and all was whole.  She loved him, he had taken her, she was
given to him.  It was right.  He was given to her, and they were
one, complete.</p>

<p>Warm, with a glow in their hearts and faces, they rose again,
modest, but transfigured with happiness.</p>

<p>&quot;I will get you something to eat,&quot; she said, and in joy and
security of service again, she left him, making a curious little
homage of departure.  He sat on the side of the bed, escaped,
liberated, wondering, and happy.</p>
