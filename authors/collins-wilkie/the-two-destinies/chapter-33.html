<P>
RETURNING to the cottage parlor, I took a chair by the window and
opened my pocket-book at a blank page. I had certain directions
to give to my representatives, which might spare them some
trouble and uncertainty in the event of my death. Disguising my
last instructions under the commonplace heading of "Memoranda on
my return to London," I began to write.
<P>
I had filled one page of the pocket-book, and had just turned to
the next, when I became conscious of a difficulty in fixing my
attention on the subject that was before it. I was at once
reminded of the similar difficulty which I felt in Shetland, when
I had tried vainly to arrange the composition of the letter to my
mother which Miss Dunross was to write. By way of completing the
parallel, my thoughts wandered now, as they had wandered then, to
my latest remembrance of Mrs. Van Brandt. In a minute or two I
began to feel once more the strange physical sensations which I
had first experienced in the garden at Mr. Dunross's house. The
same mysterious trembling shuddered through me from head to foot.
I looked about me again, with no distinct consciousness of what
the objects were on which my eyes rested. My nerves trembled, on
that lovely summer night, as if there had been an electric
disturbance in the atmosphere and a storm coming. I laid my
pocket-book and pencil on the table, and rose to go out again
under the trees. Even the trifling effort to cross the room was
an effort made in vain. I stood rooted to the spot, with my face
turned toward the moonlight streaming in at the open door.
<P>
An interval passed, and as I still looked out through the door, I
became aware of something moving far down among the trees that
fringed the shore of the lake. The first impression produced on
me was of two gray shadows winding their way slowly toward me
between the trunks of the trees. By fine degrees the shadows
assumed a more and more marked outline, until they presented
themselves in the likeness of two robed figures, one taller than
the other. While they glided nearer and nearer, their gray
obscurity of hue melted away. They brightened softly with an
inner light of their own as they slowly approached the open space
before the door. For the third time I stood in the ghostly
presence of Mrs. Van Brandt; and with her, holding her hand, I
beheld a second apparition never before revealed to me, the
apparition of her child.
<P>
Hand-in-hand, shining in their unearthly brightness through the
bright moonlight itself, the two stood before me. The mother's
face looked at me once more with the sorrowful and pleading eyes
which I remembered so well. But the face of the child was
innocently radiant with an angelic smile. I waited in unutterable
expectation for the word that was to be spoken, for the movement
that was to come. The movement came first. The child released its
hold on the mother's hand, and floating slowly upward, remained
poised in midair--a softly glowing presence shining out of the
dark background of the trees. The mother glided into the room,
and stopped at the table on which I had laid my pocket-book and
pencil when I could no longer write. As before, she took the
pencil and wrote on the blank page. As before, she beckoned to me
to step nearer to her. I approached her outstretched hand, and
felt once more the mysterious rapture of her touch on my bosom,
and heard once more her low, melodious tones repeating the words:
"Remember me. Come to me." Her hand dropped from my bosom. The
pale light which revealed her to me quivered, sunk, vanished. She
had spoken. She had gone.
<P>
I drew to me the open pocket-book. And this time I saw, in the
writing of the ghostly hand, these words only:
<P>
                    _"Follow the Child."_
<P>
I looked out again at the lonely night landscape.
<P>
There, in mid-air, shining softly out of the dark background of
the trees, still hovered the starry apparition of the child.
<P>
Advancing without conscious will of my own, I crossed the
threshold of the door. The softly glowing vision of the child
moved away before me among the trees. I followed, like a man
spellbound. The apparition, floating slowly onward, led me out of
the wood, and past my old home, back to the lonely by-road along
which I had walked from the market-town to the house. From time
to time, as we two went on our way, the bright figure of the
child paused, hovering low in the cloudless sky. Its radiant face
looked down smiling on me; it beckoned with its little hand, and
floated on again, leading me as the Star led the Eastern sages in
the olden time.
<P>
I reached the town. The airy figure of the child paused, hovering
over the house at which I had left my traveling-carriage in the
evening. I ordered the horses to be harnessed again for another
journey. The postilion waited for his further directions. I
looked up. The child's hand was pointing southward, along the
road that led to London. I gave the man his instructions to
return to the place at which I had hired the carriage. At
intervals, as we proceeded, I looked out through the window. The
bright figure of the child still floated on before me gliding low
in the cloudless sky. Changing the horses stage by stage, I went
on till the night ended--went on till the sun rose in the eastern
heaven. And still, whether it was dark or whether it was light,
the figure of the child floated on before me in its changeless
and mystic light. Mile after mile, it still led the way
southward, till we left the country behind us, and passing
through the din and turmoil of the great city, stopped under the
shadow of the ancient Tower, within view of the river that runs
by it.
<P>
The postilion came to the carriage door to ask if I had further
need of his services. I had called to him to stop, when I saw the
figure of the child pause on its airy course. I looked upward
again. The child's hand pointed toward the river. I paid the
postilion and left the carriage. Floating on before me, the child
led the way to a wharf crowded with travelers and their luggage.
A vessel lay along-side of the wharf ready to sail. The child led
me on board the vessel and paused again, hovering over me in the
smoky air.
<P>
I looked up. The child looked back at me with its radiant smile,
and pointed eastward down the river toward the distant sea. While
my eyes were still fixed on the softly glowing figure, I saw it
fade away upward and upward into the higher light, as the lark
vanishes upward and upward in the morning sky. I was alone again
with my earthly fellow-beings--left with no clew to guide me but
the remembrance of the child's hand pointing eastward to the
distant sea.
<P>
A sailor was near me coiling the loosened mooring-rope on the
deck. I asked him to what port the vessel was bound. The man
looked at me in surly amazement, and answered:
<P>
"To Rotterdam."
