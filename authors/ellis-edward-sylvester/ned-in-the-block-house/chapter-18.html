<p>Every one in the block-house, with the exception of the two little
girls of Colonel Preston, was wide awake. The conviction was so
strong that the crisis was at hand, that even Blossom Brown hunted
out his young master Ned Preston, and placing himself by his side,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I's awoke, suah's yo' bo'n."</p>

<p>"It is best that you keep awake too," replied Ned, "for it is
a good deal better than to be awakened by fire and Indians."</p>

<p>"I can't understood why de Injines don't fight fair," said Blossom,
with a tone of impatience; "we don't use fire on dem, and why
can't dey do de same wid us? If I could talk de Injine language,
I'd go down dar and try to argy de matter wid 'em; I'd show 'em
de&mdash;de&mdash;onscrupulousness ob usin' de flames to burn us out. If
we could only make 'em 'shamed, dat would be a big p'int gained."</p>

<p>"It is nonsense to think of anything like that, Blossom; the
Wyandots are determined to burn down the block-house if there
is any way to do it&#11834;"</p>

<p>He abruptly stopped, for the tramp of feet was heard outside,
close to the front door. Megill and Stinger instantly fired down
in the darkness, guided only by the sense of sound; but the cry
that rang out on the snowy air, proved that execution was done.</p>

<p>Instantly there followed such a prodigious shock, from a blow
against the door, that the whole building shook. Before the men
could bring their guns to bear, the sound of rapidly running feet
showed that the Indians had dropped their battering ram and hurried
off in the darkness.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment Mrs. Preston, who was peering through
the loopholes on the eastern side, saw an Indian arrow, wrapped
with blazing tow, shoot upward from the edge of the woods, and
going slower and slower, as it curved over, sweep downward with
a whizzing rush, and strike the roof overhead, with the same abrupt
thud that had been heard several times.</p>

<p>It was followed immediately by a second from the same point,
which seemed to take the same course, for it lodged very close
beside it, and also held its place.</p>

<p>Then another flaming missile rose from the northern side, then
from the south, and then from behind the river bank, with still
others mounting from intervening points, until a beautiful and
terrifying scene presented itself.</p>

<p>The blazing shafts followed each other in such rapid succession,
that there were fully twenty ascending and descending at the same
moment. These made all manner of fiery parabolas in the snowy
atmosphere. One archer, who sent his missiles from the upper window
of the cabin near the block-house, and another, who discharged
his from behind the pickets close at hand, pointed them so nearly
perpendicularly that they seemed to shoot downward almost directly
through the fiery trail they made in their ascent. Others came
from such distant points that their parabolas were lengthy, and
they only rose a short distance above the block-house itself,
before they plunged into the slabs of the roof.</p>

<p>These struck the latter at every possible angle, and with every
imaginable result. In some cases the arrow was so warped in its
flight that it took a path almost as erratic as that of the Australian
boomerang. Impinging against the roof at an acute angle, it would
glance far upward, and, turning over and over, come tumbling to
the earth, where it flickered a minute and died out.</p>

<p>Others hit the planks, and, like a mountaineer among the rocks,
who could not retain his hold, slid down the steep incline to
the ground. Still others missed the building altogether, and,
plunging their flinty heads in the earth, were quickly extinguished.</p>

<p>But the alarming fact remained that the majority of the flaming
missiles found a lodgment in the roof, where they burned with
a fierceness which showed they were an improvement on those first
sent. One could not but wonder where the Wyandots obtained all
these weapons: they must have started on the expedition with the
expectation of using this peculiar mode of warfare.</p>

<p>The fiery shower lasted but a few minutes, but at the end of
that time there were fully thirty shafts sticking in the roof
and burning vigorously. Viewed from the outside the block-house
looked like some vast monster whose hide was pierced with flaming
spears, but who slumbered on in the darkness, unmindful of the
pests.</p>

<p>This lavish distribution of fire showed that the ground was covered
with a fine sprinkling of snow, which was still floating downward
at an almost imperceptible rate. There was no such mantle on the
roof. It was so smooth and steep that most of the particles ran
downward and off. A thin tiny line of snow-points was continually
pouring over the eaves, where the wind blew it to atoms again.</p>

<p>The twists of flame made the air about the cabin luminous, and
the millions of snow-flakes twinkled and glistened with starlike
brilliancy, as they came out of the darkness and fluttered in
the glow for a moment, ere they vanished again.</p>

<p>Several of the burning arrows were fired against the sides of
the block-house, where they flickered a brief while. These, added
to the other missiles on the ground, threw a dull reflection through
the loopholes, that enabled the garrison to see each other "as
through a glass darkly."</p>

<p>Their figures were easily distinguishable, as they moved carefully
about, and now and then the glimpse of a face was so ghastly and
unnatural that it was hard to recognize it. Blossom Brown was
the only one who was distinguishable at the first glance, and
even he scarcely looked like himself.</p>

<p>One unusually strong reflection from an arrow that imbedded itself
in a corner disclosed the faces of the little sisters Mary and
Susie, sleeping beside each other, with the warm comfortable blankets
drawn close about them.</p>

<p>Each had thrown her arm over the other, and their dimpled cheeks
almost touched, as they slumbered sweetly and peacefully, secure
in that trust in their heavenly Father, whom they had asked to
take care of them and their friends, while the wicked Indians
tried so hard to hurt them.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the illumination, six or eight of the Wyandots
fired at the loopholes thus made visible; but the garrison knew
the danger and kept out of range.</p>

<p>The most alarming fact about the attack was the numerous burning
arrows on the roof. Colonel Preston and Jo Stinger agreed that,
after all, this was the most vulnerable point of the block-house,
and it was more than likely to ignite, if only a moderate number
of the fiery shafts could be made to hold their place a short
time.</p>

<p>Although some of the snow found a lodgment under the overlapping
slabs, there was not enough to affect the bits of flame that were
burning in many places.</p>

<p>"This is bad business!" exclaimed the Colonel, "and must be checked
at once."</p>

<p>As he had done in the previous instances the commandant drew
a stool under the trap-door on one side of the roof, while Jo
Stinger did the same on the other. When these were lifted a few
inches, the sight which greeted them was enough to cause consternation.
The light which entered the upper story through the opening thus
made disclosed every object with great distinctness.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger saw that most of the coils of flame were not of a
dangerous nature and would soon expire of themselves; but there
were two or three that were gaining a headway that was likely
to do alarming injury, unless checked.</p>

<p>"Be keerful, Colonel," said Jo, "the varmints are watching us,
and you'll get a shot afore you know it."</p>

<p>The warning was none too soon. Several of the Wyandots were waiting
a movement of the trap-door. They had stationed themselves in
the upper story of the cabin, which gave them the necessary elevation,
while the flaming missiles themselves afforded all the view required.</p>

<p>Two shots were fired at the slight gap made by the lifting of
the covering, and the Colonel dropped it with a bang and an exclamation.
But he quickly rallied and called into play some of the strategy
he had learned during a long experience on the border.</p>

<p>The really dangerous shots (that is, those from the upper story
of the cabin) must necessarily come from one side of the structure.
The Colonel held a piece of planking so that it would act as a
shield, and catch any of the bullets from that point. Grasping
the stock of his rifle with one hand, he then stealthily reached
out, and with much difficulty and labor managed to dislodge the
most threatening brands in that direction.</p>

<p>This left only one in his "jurisdiction" which he really feared.
With a skill that Jo Stinger could not restrain himself from praising,
Colonel Preston managed to send this arrow with its fiery mane
sliding down the roof, without receiving any harm, though more
than one shot was fired at him.</p>

<p>Much the same task confronted Jo Stinger, and he performed it
with the expertness that was to be expected of such a veteran;
but when he had done all he could, there remained the most dangerous
shaft of all. It had lodged in the very peak of the roof, near
the southern end, which was the closest to the cabin that sheltered
the Wyandots, and in direct range of their fire.</p>

<p>This was burning with a persistency which looked as if the tow
had been soaked with some chemical, although such could not be
the fact; but, having found a lodgment, there it stuck and grew,
with every prospect of kindling a blaze that would soon spread
to the entire roof and building.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger fortified himself as best he could, and took every
precaution. Then, amid the dropping shots of the Wyandots, he
carefully felt his way forward with his rifle, until he could
not extend it an inch further: he still lacked more than a foot
of reaching the dangerous spot.</p>

<p>The red men, who saw the failure, raised a shout, and the scout
was compelled to draw back his weapon and muffled arm, without
accomplishing anything toward the extinguishment of the blaze
that threatened the destruction of the block-house and all within.</p>

<p>"You think 'cause Jo Stinger has played the fool, there's nothing
left of his wit, but you'll soon larn he hasn't forgot everything
he once knowed."</p>

<p>"Is it the only one that endangers the roof?" asked Colonel Preston,
as Jo joined them.</p>

<p>"Yes; if we can get that out, the trouble is over for the present,
though I don't know how long it will stay so."</p>

<p>"Suppose you cannot extinguish it?" asked Mrs. Preston.</p>

<p>"Then the block-house has got to burn."</p>

<p>This announcement caused dismay, for all felt that the few blunt
words of the scout were the simple truth. They so affected Blossom
Brown that he dropped back on a stool, and set up a howling that
must have reached the ears of the Wyandots outside.</p>

<p>"It's all de fault ob dat Deerhead &mdash;I mean Deerfoot, dat
was so orful anxious to run us into dis old place, when I told
'em it wasn't wise. I wanted to go back to Wild Oaks where I had
some chores to do, but he obsisted, but took mighty good care
to keep out de block-house hisself, as I took notice&#11834;"</p>

<p>Blossom Brown would have gone on for an indefinite time with
his loud wailing, had not Stinger checked him by the threat to
throw him out the trap-door upon the roof.</p>

<p>Afraid that his bluff answer to Mrs. Preston's question might
have caused too much alarm, the scout added&mdash;</p>

<p>"If the varmints don't do any more than <em>that</em>, we're
all right, for I'm going to put the blaze out."</p>

<p>"You know the risk," said Colonel Preston, apprehensive that
Jo intended some effort that would expose him to extra peril.</p>

<p>"I reckon I do," was the response of the scout, who was the coolest
one of the whole company.</p>

<p>The situation could not have been more trying to the bravest
persons. In a manner almost unaccountable, a blaze had fastened
itself in a point of the roof beyond the reach of those within.
There it was burning and growing steadily, with the certainty
that, unless checked pretty soon, it would be beyond control.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger was the only member of the garrison who appeared equal
to the task, and more than one feared that to save the block-house
he must assume a risk that was certain to prove fatal.</p>

<p>Ned Preston caught the arm of the man in the darkness and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can't you put it out with a wet blanket?"</p>

<p>"Well, you're a boy that <em>does</em> know something!" exclaimed
Jo, adding with a burst of admiration, "Give me your hand, younker;
that's the very idee I had in mind."</p>

<p>This "idee," as the hunter termed it, was the ordinary one of
spreading a blanket, soaked with water, over the spaces endangered
by fire. Probably nothing more effective could have been devised,
but it should have been adopted when the peril involved was much
less. One-half of the entire roof was illuminated by the crackling
blaze which was steadily eating its way into the solid timber.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger, having determined on his course, spent no time in
useless conversation. Under his direction one of the blankets
was saturated with water from the precious supply in the barrel.
As it was necessary to see what they were doing, a tallow dip
was lit and placed where it threw a faint illumination through
the interior. The garrison could distinguish each other's figures,
and no one needed any advice to keep out of the path of such bullets
as might enter through the loopholes.</p>

<p>The scene was picturesque and striking. Mary and Susie still
lay wrapped in slumber, and their closed eyes and innocent faces
subdued every step and word, lest they should be awakened. Father
and mother glanced fondly at them many times, and wondered how
long that refreshing unconsciousness would continue.</p>

<p>By general agreement the entire party centered their attention
on Jo Stinger, who, having soaked the blanket, made ready to throw
it over the stubborn fire. The task of necessity was attended
by such extreme peril that all held their peace, oppressed by
the gravity of the danger. At the same time the crackling of the
flames and the unmistakable presence of smoke in the room showed
that, if the extinguishment was delayed much longer, the attempt
would be too late.</p>

<p>Jo placed the chair directly under the trap-door on the eastern
side of the block-house and was about to set foot on it, when
Colonel Preston stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Jo, you've forgotten; the blaze is further over on the other
side."</p>

<p>"That's the reason I'm going to take <em>this</em> side."</p>

<p>The Colonel stepped back, and the scout laid the dripping blanket
upon one arm, as though it were an overcoat. Grasping the edge
of the opening, and helped by Megill from below, he quickly climbed
upward, opening the door at the proper moment by the pressure
of his head against it.</p>

<p>It was not raised an inch more than necessary, when he slowly
crept out, like a crab casting its shell.</p>

<p>The blaze which was the cause of all this alarm and care was
started, as will be remembered, in the very peak of the roof,
but from some cause it had worked its way down the western side,
which was necessarily illuminated through its entirety by the
light therefrom.</p>

<p>The shifting of the fire threw the eastern half of the roof in
comparative shadow, though the flickering glow was quite certain
to reveal the figure of any large object on it. The fact that
Jo emerged with his dripping blanket without drawing a shot, led
him to hope that his action was unsuspected.</p>

<p>In order to "play every point," Colonel Preston cautiously raised
the trap-door on the other side a few inches, and, guarding his
face and arm, extended the stock of his rifle toward the blaze,
as if he expected to pound it out.</p>

<p>He advanced the weapon quite slowly and with a movement intended
to impress the sharpshooters with the belief that he had perfected
an arrangement by which he was able to reach the endangered point.</p>

<p>As he anticipated, this diversion drew several shots, which whistled
about his head with a vigor that gave him a vivid idea of the
vigilance of the besieging Wyandots.</p>

<p>While this counter-movement was in progress, Jo Stinger was carefully
making his way along the roof on the other side. The unusual steepness
made this difficult, and had he not grasped the peak and held
on, he would have shot along the slope to the ground, as if sliding
down the side of a tree.</p>

<p>Inch by inch he progressed, expecting every minute that a bullet
would be fired at him. He kept the saturated blanket well rolled
together and in front, so that it served the purpose of a shield
against any shot from the cabin, where the sharpshooters seemed
to have gathered for the purpose of keeping the roof clear of
all persons.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger had nearly reached the point from which he expected
to "ring down the curtain" on the flame, when he was confronted
by an experience altogether novel and unexpected.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the burning arrows had done such good service, one
of the Wyandots on the edge of the woods launched another, which
went high in the air and, curving gracefully over, plunged downward
toward the roof.</p>

<p>Jo had no knowledge of its approach, until he heard the whizzing
rush of the flaming shaft, as it drove its head against the wet
blanket, glanced off and slid to the earth.</p>

<p>"It won't do to loaf 'round here," he muttered, "or I'll be crawling
over the roof with a dozen blazing arrers, and if Jo Stinger knows
hisself, he don't mean to play walkin' lantern for the Wyandot
varmints."</p>

<p>He had attained the position he was seeking, and a most delicate
piece of work was before him, but he was equal to it.</p>

<p>The Indians, who were gathered in the cabin, and collected at
different points in the woods and along the stockade, watching
the flame with no little exultation, saw it creeping downward
and spreading with a rapidity which boded ill for the garrison
huddled beneath.</p>

<p>The fine, silver-like snowflakes glistened in the fire-light,
and floated shudderingly down the roof, without affecting the
blaze; but at the moment when scores of eyes were gleaming like
those of so many wild beasts, a dark shadow suddenly disclosed
itself&mdash;what seemed an immense black hand spread out and closed
over the dangerous fire, which was instantly extinguished.</p>
