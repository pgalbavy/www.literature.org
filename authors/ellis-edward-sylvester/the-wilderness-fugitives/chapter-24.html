<p>Minturn looked in the face of his sister a moment, as if he would
read her very thoughts. Then he asked in a whisper that not even
Ned Clinton overheard:</p>

<p>"Do you mistrust him, Rosa?"</p>

<p>She regretted her words, and answered:</p>

<p>"I ought not to have said it, Jo, but I didn't like his looks
when he first joined us; have you ever seen him before?"</p>

<p>"I think I have, though I can't recall the place or occasion."</p>

<p>"Well, that makes a different matter of it; do as you think best."</p>

<p>Believing that his sister had come to his view of the case, Jo
so stated to Ned, and there was no further hesitation. While this
little conference was going on, Worrell remained seated, acting
as if he had no concern in the matter. He busied himself in examining
his rifle, and making sure it was in order. A minute or so before
Jo was prepared to make a definite proposition to him, he rose
to his feet, and assumed an attitude of intense attention, as
though some faint signal had fallen on his ear. Then as the young
scout turned to address him, he spoke first:</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I'll have to bid you good-morning."</p>

<p>"And why so?" asked Jo, in some surprise.</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, this is too dangerous a place to stay any
longer. I hear sounds in the woods that lead me to think there
are some of the redskins not very far off, and I prefer to dig
out; maybe it'll be safer and better for you to wait till Lena-Wingo
comes back, and he'll get you out better than I can."</p>

<p>"No one could do better than the Mohawk if he were only here,
but the trouble is he isn't here just now, and we've come to the
conclusion that it is not safe to wait for him. Where do you mean
to go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a little hiding-place up here a way, where I'll
crawl into, for, when I'm in there, you may trot out all the redskins
in the valley, and I'll go to sleep while they're hunting. I don't
care if Lena-Wingo is among them. I ca'c'late to spend some time
there till the Indians get a little scarcer."</p>

<p>"What will you do for food?"</p>

<p>"I've got <em>that</em> fixed," replied Worrell, in a voice and
with a manner that implied there was nothing to fear on that score.</p>

<p>"Well, if you will allow us to go with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Allow you!" exclaimed the man, in a gushing mood. "Haven't I
been wanting you to go with me ever since I stopped and found
in what trouble you were? Why, come along, and I'll put you in
a place where you can stay a month, if you want to, without a
living soul finding out where you are."</p>

<p>"We'll do it, and be forever grateful for your kindness; but
you say even Lena-Wingo will be unable to find out where we are
hiding. We must let him know where we are when he returns and
misses us."</p>

<p>"That can be fixed. When we see him looking for us, we can step
out and let him know we are around, and he'll be there in a second,
of course."</p>

<p>"All right, then; lead the way."</p>

<p>The man placed himself at the head of the party, Jo following,
while Ned and Rosa brought up the rear. The first move of Worrell
impressed the youths in his favor, for he headed toward the mountain
close at hand, a course that would suggest itself to one who was
hunting a hiding-place. It looked as if he understood his business,
and knew where to take them to find what they wanted. There was
no material change in the appearance of the forest through which
they were making their way, except that it grew somewhat rougher
and more difficult to traverse, though the company continued to
journey without any hesitation in their rate of progress.</p>

<p>They pushed along for quite a distance in this manner, when their
guide halted, as if he had again detected something that did not
suit him. He stood with his head bent in the way they noticed
before starting, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"What's up now?" asked Jo, who thought they might as well understand
everything as they went along.</p>

<p>"It's queer," replied their companion, in a low voice, "but I've
fancied once or twice that I heard signals in the woods just such
as have caught my ear when I knew the redskins were looking for
some of us. Night before last, I picked up a poor chap &mdash;Tom
Haley, a settler living near me, and was on my way to another
place to hide him, when we heard the same sort of sounds, and
we stopped to listen to 'em, but we hadn't stood more than five
minutes when they come down on us. The first notice we had was
the banging of about a dozen rifles, and that was the last of
poor Tom. I was lucky enough to get away, but I don't want to
meet any more neighbors like that."</p>

<p>This was not cheerful or soothing information, and the three
fugitives felt anything but comfortable.</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard the sounds?" asked Worrell, addressing the
three.</p>

<p>None of them had noticed anything, and Rosa asked:</p>

<p>"What do they resemble?"</p>

<p>"Nothing so much as the faint call of the whip-o'-will, so low
and soft that the ear can hardly catch it."</p>

<p>"It is strange that you should be the only one to notice it,"
she continued; "are you sure that you weren't mistaken?"</p>

<p>"It may be I was, but my experience with the Iroquois has made
me very suspicious; but I do hope I was off the track, for it
may prove a bad thing if I wasn't."</p>

<p>"Do you hear it now?"</p>

<p>"Hark! let us listen."</p>

<p>All stood motionless, and scarcely breathing. But nothing resembling
the sounds described by their guide was noticed.</p>

<p>"It <em>does</em> look as if I was mistaken," said Worrell, brightening
up. "I hope I was."</p>

<p>"It could be very well the other way," said Ned Clinton. "The
Indians may have made a dozen calls to each other, but they were
not likely to keep it up very long. A few signals would accomplish
all they want."</p>

<p>Nothing was to be gained by argument over the question, in which
all was conjecture, and they moved on once more. It was not five
minutes before their guide paused again, but it was only for a
moment, and he said nothing. He acted as if he fancied he caught
something suspicious, but seeing the whites with the appearance
of attention, concluded he was mistaken, so long as nothing of
the kind fell upon their ears. By that time the afternoon was
well advanced, and the day was somewhat warmer than before.</p>

<p>None of the fugitives had gained a moment's sleep during the
preceding night, while the exhaustion and privation of the past
few days were so severe that they experienced the need of rest
and food. Ned and Jo felt that the man could not do them a greater
favor and kindness than to lead them into some retreat where they
could recuperate in this respect,&mdash;sleep being needed more than
anything else. Jo turned about while they were walking cautiously
forward, and whispered to Ned immediately behind:</p>

<p>"Watch the route we take."</p>

<p>Ned nodded his head to signify he understood him. At intervals
they reached and crossed small spaces of natural clearings, where
Rosa and the youths scanned all the country that could be brought
under their field of vision. In no instance were these very extensive,
and the view resulted in nothing tangible as regarded the movements
of their enemies. Much of the ground which was passed was rough
and covered with stones. Upon these they stepped so carefully
that they left a trail which it would require the keenest eye
of the Indian warrior to detect and follow.</p>
