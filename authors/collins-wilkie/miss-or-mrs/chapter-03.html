<P>
Let us be serious.--Business!
<P>
The new scene plunges us head foremost into the affairs of the
Levant trading-house of Pizzituti, Turlington & Branca. What on
earth do we know about the Levant Trade? Courage! If we have ever
known what it is to want money we are perfectly familiar with the
subject at starting. The Levant Trade does occasionally get into
difficulties.--Turlington wanted money.
<P>
The letter which had been handed to him on board the yacht was
from his third partner, Mr. Branca, and was thus expressed:
<P>
"A crisis in the trade. All right, so far--except our business
with the small foreign firms. Bills to meet from those quarters,
(say) forty thousand pounds--and, I fear, no remittances to cover
them. Particulars stated in another letter addressed to you at
Post-office, Ilfracombe. I am quite broken down with anxiety, and
confined to my bed. Pizzituti is still detained at Smyrna. Come
back at once."
<P>
The same evening Turlington was at his office in Austin Friars,
investigating the state of affairs, with his head clerk to help
him.
<P>
Stated briefly, the business of the firm was of the widely
miscellaneous sort. They plied a brisk trade in a vast variety of
commodities. Nothing came amiss to them, from Manchester cotton
manufactures to Smyrna figs. They had branch houses at Alexandria
and Odessa, and correspondents here, there, and everywhere, along
the shores of the Mediterranean, and in the ports of the East.
These correspondents were the persons alluded to in Mr. Branca's
letter as "small foreign firms;" and they had produced the
serious financial crisis in the affairs of the great house in
Austin Friars, which had hurried Turlington up to London.
<P>
Every one of these minor firms claimed and received the privilege
of drawing bills on Pizzituti, Turlington & Branca for amounts
varying from four to six thousand pounds--on no better security
than a verbal understanding that the money to pay the bills
should be forwarded before they fell due. Competition, it is
needless to say, was at the bottom of this insanely reckless
system of trading. The native firms laid it down as a rule that
they would decline to transact business with any house in the
trade which refused to grant them their privilege. In the ease of
Turlington's house, the foreign merchants had drawn their bills
on him for sums large in the aggregate, if not large in
themselves; had long since turned those bills into cash in their
own markets, for their own necessities; and had now left the
money which their paper represented to be paid by their London
correspondents as it fell due. In some instances, they had sent
nothing but promises and excuses. In others, they had forwarded
drafts on firms which had failed already, or which were about to
fail, in the crisis. After first exhausting his resources in
ready money, Mr. Branca had provided for the more pressing
necessities by pledging the credit of the house, so far as he
_could_ pledge it without exciting suspicion of the truth. This
done, there were actually left, between that time and Christmas,
liabilities to be met to the extent of forty thousand pounds,
without a farthing in hand to pay that formidable debt.
<P>
After working through the night, this was the conclusion at which
Richard Turlington arrived, when the rising sun looked in at him
through the windows of his private room.
<P>
The whole force of the blow had fallen on _him_. The share of his
partners in the business was of the most trifling nature. The
capital was his, the risk was his. Personally and privately, _he_
had to find the money, or to confront the one other alternative--
ruin.
<P>
How was the money to be found?
<P>
With his position in the City, he had only to go to the famous
money-lending and discounting house of Bulpit Brothers--reported
to "turn over" millions in their business every year--and to
supply himself at once with the necessary funds. Forty thousand
pounds was a trifling transaction to Bulpit Brothers.
<P>
Having got the money, how, in the present state of his trade, was
the loan to be paid back?
<P>
His thoughts reverted to his marriage with Natalie.
<P>
"Curious!" he said to himself, recalling his conversation with
Sir Joseph on board the yacht. "Graybrooke told me he would give
his daughter half his fortune on her marriage. Half Graybrooke's
fortune happens to be just forty thousand pounds!" He took a turn
in the room. No! It was impossible to apply to Sir Joseph. Once
shake Sir Joseph's conviction of his commercial solidity, and the
marriage would be certainly deferred--if not absolutely broken
off. Sir Joseph's fortune could be made available, in the present
emergency, in but one way--he might use it to repay his debt. He
had only to make the date at which the loan expired coincide with
the date of his marriage, and there was his father-in-law's money
at his disposal, or at his wife's disposal--which meant the same
thing. "It's well I pressed Graybrooke about the marriage when I
did!" he thought. "I can borrow the money at a short date. In
three months from this Natalie will be my wife."
<P>
He drove to his club to get breakfast, with his mind cleared, for
the time being, of all its anxieties but one.
<P>
Knowing where he could procure the loan, he was by no means
equally sure of being able to find the security on which he could
borrow the money. Living up to his income; having no expectations
from any living creature; possessing in landed property only some
thirty or forty acres in Somersetshire, with a quaint little
dwelling, half farm house, half-cottage, attached-- he was
incapable of providing the needful security from his own personal
resources. To appeal to wealthy friends in the City would be to
let those friends into the secret of his embarrassments, and to
put his credit in peril. He finished his breakfast, and went back
to Austin Friars--failing entirely, so far, to see how he was to
remove the last obstacle now left in his way.
<P>
The doors were open to the public; business had begun. He had not
been ten minutes in his room before the shipping-clerk knocked at
the door and interrupted him, still absorbed in his own anxious
thoughts.
<P>
"What is it?" he asked, irritably.
<P>
"Duplicate Bills of Lading, sir," answered the clerk, placing the
documents on his ma ster's table.
<P>
Found! There was the security on his writing-desk, staring him in
the face! He dismissed the clerk and examined the papers.
<P>
They contained an account of goods shipped to the London house on
board vessels sailing from Smyrna and Odessa, and they were
signed by the masters of the ships, who thereby acknowledged the
receipt of the goods, and undertook to deliver them safely to the
persons owning them, as directed. First copies of these papers
had already been placed in the possession of the London house.
The duplicates had now followed, in case of accident. Richard
Turlington instantly determined to make the duplicates serve as
his security, keeping the first copies privately under lock and
key, to be used in obtaining possession of the goods at the
customary time. The fraud was a fraud in appearance only. The
security was a pure formality. His marriage would supply him with
the funds needed for repaying the money, and the profits of his
business would provide, in course of time, for restoring the
dowry of his wife. It was simply a question of preserving his
credit by means which were legitimately at his disposal. Within
the lax limits of mercantile morality, Richard Turlington had a
conscience. He put on his hat and took his false security to the
money-lenders, without feeling at all lowered in his own
estimation as an honest man.
<P>
Bulpit Brothers, long desirous of having such a name as his on
their books, received him with open arms. The security (covering
the amount borrowed) was accepted as a matter of course. The
money was lent, for three months, with a stroke of the pen.
Turlington stepped out again into the street, and confronted the
City of London in the character of the noblest work of mercantile
creation--a solvent man.*
<P>
The Fallen Angel, walking invisibly behind, in Richard's shadow,
flapped his crippled wings in triumph. From that moment the
Fallen Angel had got him. ----------- * It may not be amiss to
remind the incredulous reader that a famous firm in the City
accepted precisely the same security as that here accepted by
Bulpit Brothers, with the same sublime indifference to troubling
themselves by making any inquiry about it.
