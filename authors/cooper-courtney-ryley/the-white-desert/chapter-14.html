<p>It was a blow greater, far greater than one that could have been struck
in mere physical contact.  Houston reeled with the effect of it; he
gasped, he struggled aimlessly, futilely, for words to answer it.
Vaguely, dizzily, knowing nothing except a dim, hazy desire to rid
himself of the loathsomeness of it, Houston started to the door, only
to be pulled back in the gigantic grip of Ba'tiste Renaud.  The old
Canadian was glaring now, his voice was thunderous.
</p>
<p>"No!  No!  You shall not go!  You hear Ba'teese, huh?  You tell Medaine
that is a lie!  Un'stan'?  That is a lie!"
</p><p>"It is," Houston heard his voice as though coming from far away, "but I
don't know how to answer it.  I--I--can't answer it.  Where is Miss
Jierdon?  Is she here?  May I see her?"
</p><p>"Miss Jierdon," Medaine Robinette answered him as though with an
effort, "went back to camp last night."
</p><p>"May I bring her here, to repeat that before me?  There's been some
sort of a horrible mistake--she didn't know what she was saying.  She--"
</p><p>"I'm afraid, Mr. Houston, that I would need stronger evidence--now.
Oh, I want to be fair about this," she burst out suddenly.  "I--I
shouldn't ever have been drawn into it.  It's nothing of my concern;
certainly, I shouldn't be the one to be called upon to judge the
innocence or guilt of some one I hardly know!  I--"
</p><p>"I realize that, Miss Robinette.  I withdraw my request for anything
you can give me."  Again he started toward the door, and this time
Ba'tiste did not detain him.  But abruptly he halted, a sudden thought
searing its way through his brain.  "Just one moment more, Miss
Robinette.  Then I'll go.  But this question means a great deal.  You
passed me one night on the road.  Would it be impertinent to ask where
you had been?"
</p><p>"Certainly not.  To Tabernacle.  Lost Wing went with me, as usual.  You
may ask him."
</p><p>"Your word is enough.  May I inquire if on that night you saw Fred
Thayer?"
</p><p>"I did not."
</p><p>"Thank you."  Dully he reached for the knob.  The woman who had
appeared that night in the clearing, her head upon a man's shoulder,
had been Agnes Jierdon!
</p><p>He stepped to the veranda, waiting for Ba'tiste, who was making a last
effort in his behalf.  Then he called:
</p><p>"I'd rather you'd not say anything more, Ba'tiste.  Words aren't much
use--without something to back them up."
</p><p>And he knew that this possibility was all but gone.  Tricked!  For now
he realized that Agnes Jierdon had stood by him at a time when her
supposed confidence and trust could do no more for him than cheer him
and cause him to trust her to the end that,--what?
</p><p>Had it been she who had slipped the necessary papers of the contract
and the lease into the mass of formalities which he had signed without
even looking at the contents of more than the first page or two of the
pile?  They had been so many technical details, merely there for
signature; he had signed dozens before.  It would have been easy.
</p><p>But Houston forced back the thought.  He himself knew what it meant to
be unjustly accused.  Time was but of little moment now; his theories
could wait until he had seen Agnes Jierdon, until he had talked to her
and questioned her regarding the statements made to Medaine Robinette.
Besides, Ba'tiste already was in the buggy, striving to cover his
feelings by a stream of badinage directed toward Golemar, the wolf-dog,
and waiting for Houston to take his place beside him.  A moment more
and they were driving away, Ba'tiste humped over the reins as usual,
Houston striving to put from him the agony of the new accusation.
Finally, the trapper cocked his head and spoke, rather to the horse and
Golemar than to Houston.
</p><p>"Eet is the one, big lie!"
</p><p>"Yes, but there's not much way of proving it, Ba'tiste."
</p><p>"Proof?  Bah!  And does Ba'teese need proof?  Ba'teese no like this
woman, Jierdon.  She say Ba'teese burn the mill."
</p><p>"I didn't know you heard that."
</p><p>"She have a bad mouth.  She have a bad eye.  She have a bad tongue.
Yes, <u>oui</u>!  She have a bad tongue!"
</p><p>"Let's wait, Ba'tiste.  There may be some mistake about it.  Of course,
it's possible.  She had worked for my father for six months at the
time--she could have been placed there for a purpose.  Her testimony
was of the sort that the jury could take either as for me or against
me; she established, as an eyewitness, that we had quarreled and that
the mallet played a part in it.  Naturally, though, I looked to her as
my friend.  I thought that her testimony helped me."
</p><p>"And the taxi-driver?  What did he say?  Eh?"
</p><p>"We never were able to find him."
</p><p>"Oh, ho!  Golemar!  You hear?"  The old trapper's voice was stinging
with sarcasm.  "They nev' fin' heem.  But the woman she was in a taxi.
Ah, <u>oui</u>.  She could pass, just at the moment.  She could put in the
mind of the jury the fact that there was a quarrel, while she preten'
to help M'sieu Houston.  But the taxi-driver--no, they nev' fin' heem!"
</p><p>"Let's wait, Ba'tiste."
</p><p>"Oh--ah, <u>oui</u>."
</p><p>On they drove in silence, talking of trivial things, each fencing away
from the subject that was on their minds and from mention of the
unfortunate interview with Medaine Robinette.  The miles faded slowly,
at last to bring the camp into view.  Ten minutes later, Houston leaped
from the buggy and knocked at the door of the cottage.
</p><p>"I want to see Miss Jierdon," he told the cook who had opened the door.
That person shook her head.
</p><p>"She's gone."
</p><p>"Gone?  Where?"
</p><p>"To town, I guess.  She came back here from Miss Robinette's last night
and packed her things and left.  She didn't say where she was going.
She left a note for you."
</p><p>"Let me have it!"  There was anxiety in the command.  The cook bustled
back into the house, to return with a sealed envelope addressed to
Houston.  He slit it with a trembling finger.
</p><p>"What she say?"  Ba'tiste was leaning from the buggy.  Houston took his
place beside him, and as the horse was turned back toward the trapper's
cabin, read aloud:
</p>
<p>"Dearest Barry:
</p><p>"Hate awfully to run away like this without seeing you, but it can't be
helped.  Have an offer of a position in St. Louis that I can't very
well refuse.  Will write you from there.
</p><p>"Love and kisses.
</p><p><strong>"AGNES."</strong>
</p>
<p>Ba'tiste slapped the reins on the horse's back.
</p><p>"She is like the Judas, eh?" he asked quietly, and Houston cringed with
the realization that he had spoken the truth.  Judas!  A feminine
Judas, who had come to him when his guard had been lowered, who had
pretended that she believed in him, that she even loved him, that she
might wreck his every plan and hope in life.  A Judas, a--
</p><p>"Let's don't talk about it, Ba'tiste!" Houston's voice was hoarse,
weary.  "It's a little too much to take, all in one day."
</p><p>"<u>Tres bien</u>," answered the old French-Canadian, not to speak again
until they had reached his cabin and, red-faced, he had turned from the
stove to place the evening meal on the table.  Then, his mouth full of
crisply fried bacon, he waved a hand and spluttered with a sudden
inspiration:
</p><p>"What you do, now?"
</p><p>"Queer question, isn't it?"  The grim humor of it brought a smile, in
spite of the lead in Houston's heart.  "What is there to do?"
</p><p>"What?"  Ba'tiste gulped his food, rose and waved a hand with a sudden
flash of emphasis.  "Peuff!  And there is ever'thin'.  You have a mill."
</p><p>"Such as it is."
</p><p>"But eet is a mill.  And eet can saw timber--enough to keep the wolf
from the door.  You have yourself.  Your arm, he is near' well.  And
there is alway'--" he gestured profoundly--"the future.  He is like a
woman, the future," he added, with a little smile.  "He always look
good when he is in the far away."
</p><p>The enthusiasm of the trapper found a faint echo in Houston's heart.
"I'm not whipped yet, Ba'tiste.  But I'm near it.  I've had some pretty
hard knocks."
</p><p>"Ah, <u>oui</u>!  But so have Ba'teese!"  The shadows were falling, and the
old French-Canadian walked to the window.  "<u>Oui, oui, oui</u>!  Look."
And he pointed to the white cross, still faintly visible, like a
luminous thing, beneath the pines.  "Ev' day, Ba'teese, he see that.
Ev' day, Ba'teese remember--how he work for others, how he is <u>L'
M'sieu Doctaire</u>, how he help and help and help--but how he cannot help
his own.  Ev' day, Ba'teese, he live again that night in the cathedral
when he call, so, 'Pierre!  Pierre!'  But Pierre does not answer.  Ev'
day, he remind how he come home, and how his heart, eet is cold, but
how he hope that his Julienne, she will warm eet again--to fin' that.
But does Ba'teese stop?  Does Ba'teese fol' his hands?  No!  No!"  He
thundered the words and beat his heavy chest.  "Some day, Ba'teese will
fin' what he look for!  When the cloud, he get heavy, Ba'teese, he go
out there--out to his Julienne--and he kneel down and he pray that she
give to heem the strength to go on--to look and look and look until he
find eet--the thing he is want'!  Ba'teese, he too have had his
trouble.  Ba'teese, he too would like to quit!  But no, he shall not!
And you shall not!  By the cross of my Julienne, you shall not!  Eet is
to the end--and not before!  You look like my Pierre!  My Pierre had in
heem the blood of Ba'teese--Ba'teese, who had broke' the way.  And
Pierre would not quit, and you will not quit.  And--"
</p><p>"I will not quit!"  Barry Houston said the words slowly, in a voice
heightened by feeling and by a new strength, a sudden flooding of a
reserve power that he did not know he possessed.  "That is my absolute
promise to you, Ba'tiste.  I will not quit!"
</p><p>"<u>Bon</u>!  Good!  Golemar, you hear, eh?  <u>Mon ami</u>, he come to the
barrier, and he look at the trouble, but he say he will not quit.
<u>Veritas</u>!  <u>Bon</u>!  He is my Pierre!  He speak like my Pierre would
speak!  He will not quit!"
</p><p>"No," and then Houston repeated it, a strange light shining in his
eyes, his hands clenched, breath pulling deep into his lungs.  "I will
not quit."
</p><p>"Ah, <u>oui</u>!  Eet is now the, what-you-say, the swing-around point.
To-night Ba'teese go out.  Where?  Ah, you shall wait an' see.
Ba'teese go--Ba'teese come back.  Then you shall see.  Ah, <u>oui</u>!  Then
you shall see."
</p><p>For an hour or so after that he boomed about the cabin, singing queer
old songs in a <u>patois</u>, rumbling to the faithful Golemar, washing the
dishes while Houston wiped them, joking, talking of everything but the
troubles of the day and the plans of the night.  Outside the shadows
grew heavier, finally to turn to pitch darkness.  The bull bats began
to circle about the cabin.  Ba'tiste walked to the door.
</p><p>"<u>Bon</u>!  Good!" he exclaimed.  "The sky, he is full of cloud'.  The
star, he do not shine.  <u>Bon</u>!  Ba'teese shall go."
</p><p>And with a final wave of the hand, still keeping his journey a mystery,
he went forth into the night.
</p><p>Long Houston waited for his return, but he did not come.  The old,
creaking clock on the rustic ledge ticked away the minutes and the
hours until midnight, but still no crunching of gravel relieved his
anxious ears, still no gigantic form of the grizzled, bearded trapper
showed in the doorway.  One o'clock came and went.  Two--three.
Houston still waited.  Four--and a scratch on the door.  It was
Golemar, followed a moment later by a grinning, twinkling-eyed Ba'tiste.
</p><p>"<u>Bon</u>!  Good!" he exclaimed.  "See, Golemar?  What I say to you?  He
wait up for Ba'teese.  <u>Bon</u>!  Now--<u>alert, mon ami</u>!  The pencil and
the paper!"
</p><p>He slumped into a chair and dived into a pocket of his red shirt, to
bring forth a mass of scribbled sheets, to stare at them, striving
studiously to make out the writing.
</p><p>"Ba'teese, he put eet down by a match in the shelter of a lumber pile,"
came at last.  "Eet is all, what-you-say, scramble up.  But we shall
see--ah, <u>oui</u>--we shall see.  Now," he looked toward Houston, waiting
anxiously with paper and pencil, "we shall put eet in the list.  So.
One million ties, seven by eight by eight feet, at the one dollar and
the forty cents.  Put that down."
</p><p>"I have it.  But what--"
</p><p>"Wait!  Five thousan' bridge timber, ten by ten by sixteen feet, at the
three dollar and ninety cents."
</p><p>"Yes--"
</p><p>"Ten thousand feet of the four by four, at--"
</p><p>"Ba'tiste!" Houston had risen suddenly.  "What have you got there?"
</p><p>The trapper grinned and pulled at his gray-splotched beard.
</p><p>"Oh, ho!  Golemar!  He wan' to know.  Shall we tell heem, eh?  Ah,
<u>oui</u>--" he shook his big shoulders and spread his hands.  "Eet is--the
copy of the bid!"
</p><p>"The copy?  The bid?"
</p><p>"From the Blackburn mill.  There is no one aroun'.  Ba'teese, he go
through a window.  Ba'teese, he find heem--in a file.  And he bring
back the copy."
</p><p>"Then--"
</p><p>"M'sieu Houston, he too will bid.  But he will make it lower.  And
this," he tapped the scribbled scraps of paper, "is cheaper than any
one else.  Eet is because of the location.  M'sieu Houston--he know
what they bid.  He will make eet cheaper."
</p><p>"But what with, Ba'tiste?  We haven't a mill to saw the stuff, in the
first place.  This ramshackle thing we're setting up now couldn't even
begin to turn out the ties alone.  The bid calls for ten thousand laid
down at Tabernacle, the first of June.  We might do that, but how on
earth would we ever keep up with the rest?  The boxings, the rough
lumber, the two by fourteen's finished, the dropped sidings and groved
roofing, and lath and ceiling and rough fencings and all the rest?
What on earth will we do it with?"
</p><p>"What with?"  Ba'tiste waved an arm grandiloquently.  "With the future!"
</p><p>"It's taking the longest kind of a chance--"
</p><p>"Ah, <u>oui</u>!  But the man who is drowning, he will, what-you-say, grab
at a haystack."
</p><p>"True enough.  Go ahead.  I'll mark our figures down too, as you read."
</p><p>And together they settled to the making of a bid that ran into the
millions, an overture for a contract for which they had neither mill,
nor timber, nor flume, nor resources to complete!
