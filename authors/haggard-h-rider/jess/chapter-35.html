<p>When the rain ceased and the moon began to shine, Jess was still fleeing
like a wild thing across the plain on the top of the mountain. She felt
no sense of exhaustion now or even of weariness; her only idea was to
get away, right away somewhere, where she could lose herself and nobody
would ever see her again. Presently she reached to top of Leeuwen Kloof,
and recognising the spot in a bewildered way she began to descend it.
Here was a place where she might lie till she died, for no one ever came
there, except now and again some wandering Kafir herd. On she sprang,
from rock to rock, a wild and eerie figure, well in keeping with the
solemn and titanic sadness of the place.
</p><p>Twice she fell, once right into the stream, but she took no heed,
she did not even seem to feel it. At last she was at the bottom, now
creeping like a black dot across the wide spaces of moonlight, and now
swallowed up in the shadow. There before her gaped the mouth of the
little cave; her strength was leaving her at last, and she was fain to
crawl into it, broken-hearted, crazed, and--<u>dying</u>.
</p><p>“Oh, God forgive me! God forgive me!” she moaned as she sank upon the
rocky floor. “Bessie, I sinned against you, but I have washed away my
sin. I did it for you, Bessie love, not for myself. I had rather have
died than kill him for myself. You will marry John now, and you will
never, never know what I did for you. I am going to die. I know that.
I am dying. Oh, if only I could see his face once more before I
die--before I die!”
</p><p>Slowly the westering moonlight crept down the blackness of the rock. Now
at last it peeped into the little cave and played upon John’s sleeping
face lying within six feet of her. Her prayer had been granted; there
was her lover by her side.
</p><p>With a start and a great sigh of doubt she recognised him. Was it a
vision? Was he dead? She dragged herself to him upon her hands and knees
and listened for his breathing, if perchance he still breathed and was
not a wraith. Then it came, strong and slow, the breath of a man in deep
sleep.
</p><p>So he lived. Should she try to wake him? What for? To tell him she was
a murderess and then to let him see her die? For instinct told her that
nature was exhausted; and she knew that she was certainly going--going
fast. No, a hundred times no!
</p><p>Only she put her hand into her breast, and drawing out the pass on the
back of which she had written her last message to him, she thrust it
between his listless fingers. It should speak for her. Then she leant
over him, and watched his sleeping face, a very incarnation of infinite,
despairing tenderness, and love that is deeper than the grave. And as
she watched, gradually her feet and legs grew cold and numb, till at
length she could feel nothing below her bosom. She was dead nearly to
the heart. Well, it was better so!
</p><p>The rays of the moon faded slowly from the level of the little cave, and
John’s face grew dark to her darkening sight. She bent down and kissed
him once--twice--thrice.
</p><p>At last the end came. There was a great flashing of light before her
eyes, and within her ears the roaring as of a thousand seas, and her
head sank gently on her lover’s breast as on a pillow; and there Jess
died and passed upward towards the wider life and larger liberty, or, at
the least, downward into the depths of rest.
</p><p>Poor dark-eyed, deep-hearted Jess! This was the fruition of her love,
and this her bridal bed.
</p><p>It was done. She had gone, taking with her the secret of her
self-sacrifice and crime, and the night-winds moaning amidst the rocks
sang their requiem over her. Here she first had learned her love, and
here she closed its book on earth.
</p><p>She might have been a great and a good woman. She might even have been a
happy woman. But fate had ordained it otherwise. Women such as Jess are
rarely happy in the world. It is not worldly wise to stake all one’s
fortune on a throw, and lack the craft to load the dice. Well, her
troubles are done with. Think gently of her and let her pass in peace!
</p>
<p>The hours grew on towards the evening, but John, the dead face of the
woman he had loved still pillowed on his breast, neither dreamed nor
woke. There was a strange and dreadful irony in the situation, an irony
which sometimes finds its counterpart in our waking life, but still the
man slept, and the dead girl lay till the night turned into the morning
and the earth woke up as usual. The sunbeams slid into the cave, and
played indifferently upon the ashen face and tangled curls, and on the
broad chest of the living man whereon they rested. An old baboon peeped
round the rocky edge and manifested no surprise, only indignation, at
the intrusion of humanity, dead or alive, into his dominions. Yes, the
world woke up as usual, and recked not and troubled not because Jess was
dead.
</p><p>It is so accustomed to such sights.
</p><p>At last John woke up also. He stretched his arms yawning, and for the
first time became aware of the weight upon his breast. He glanced down
and saw dimly at first--then more clearly.
</p>
<p>There are some things into which it is wisest not to pry, and one of
them is the first agony of a strong man’s grief.
</p><p>Happy was it for John that his brain did not give way in that lonely
hour of bottomless despair. But he lived through it, as we do live
through such things, and was sane and sound after it, though it left its
mark upon his life.
</p>
<p>Two hours later a gaunt, haggard figure stumbled down the hill-side
towards the site of Mooifontein, bearing something in his arms. The
whole place was in commotion. Here and there were knots of Boers talking
excitedly, who, when they saw the man coming, hurried up to learn who
it was and what he carried. But when they knew, they fell back awed and
without a word, and John too passed through them without a word. For
a moment he hesitated, seeing that the house was burnt down. Then he
turned into the waggon-shed, and laid his burden down on the saw-bench
where Frank Muller had sat as judge upon the previous day.
</p><p>Now at last John spoke in a hoarse voice: “Where is the old man?”
</p><p>One of them pointed to the door of the little room.
</p><p>“Open it!” he said, so fiercely that again they fell back and obeyed him
without a word.
</p><p>“John! John!” cried Silas Croft, rising amazed from his seat upon a
sack. “Thank God--you have come back to us from the dead!” and trembling
with joy and surprise he would have fallen on his neck.
</p><p>“Hush!” he answered; “I have brought the dead with me.”
</p><p>And he led him to where Jess lay.
</p>
<p>During the day all the Boers went away and left them alone. Now that
Frank Muller lay dead there was no thought among them of carrying out
the sentence upon their old neighbour. Besides, there was no warrant for
the execution, even had they desired so to do, for their commandant
died leaving it unsigned. So they held an informal inquest upon their
leader’s body, and buried him in the little graveyard that was walled in
on the hill-side at the back of where the house had stood, and planted
with the four red gums, one at each corner. Rather than be at the pains
of hollowing another grave, they buried him in the very place that he
had caused to be dug to receive the body of Silas Croft.
</p><p>Who had murdered Frank Muller was and remains a mystery among them
to this day. The knife was identified by natives about the farm as
belonging to the Hottentot Jantje, and a Hottentot had been seen running
away from the place of the deed and hunted for some way, but he could
not be caught or heard of again. Therefore many of them are of the
opinion that he is the guilty man. Others, again, believe that the crime
rests upon the shoulders of the villainous one-eyed Kafir, Hendrik,
Muller’s own servant, who had also vanished. But as they have never
found either of them, and are not likely to do so, the point remains a
moot one. Nor, indeed, did they take any great pains to hunt for them.
Frank Muller was not a popular character, and the fact of a man coming
to a mysterious end does not produce any great sensation among a rough
people and in rough times.
</p>
<p>On the following day, old Silas Croft, Bessie, and John Niel also buried
their dead in the little graveyard on the hill-side, and there Jess
lies, with some ten feet of earth only between her and the man upon whom
she was the instrument of vengeance. But they never knew this, or even
guessed it. They never knew indeed that she had been near Mooifontein on
that awful night. Nobody knew it except Jantje; and Jantje, haunted by
the footfall of the pursuing Boers, was gone from the ken of the white
man far into the heart of Central Africa.
</p><p>“John,” said the old man when they had filled in the grave, “this is no
country for Englishmen. Let us go home to England.” John bowed his head
in assent, for he could not speak. Fortunately means were not wanting,
although practically they were both ruined. The thousand pounds that
John had paid to Silas as the price of a third interest in the farm
still lay to the credit of the latter in the Standard Bank at Newcastle,
in Natal, together with another two hundred and fifty pounds in cash.
</p><p>And so in due course they went.
</p><p>Now what more is there to tell? Jess, to those who read what has been
written as it is meant to be read, was the soul of it all, and Jess--is
dead. It is useless to set a lifeless thing upon its feet, rather let us
strive to follow the soarings of the spirit. Jess is dead and her story
at an end.
</p><hr/>
<p>So but one word more.
</p><p>After some difficulty, John Niel, within three months of his arrival
in England, obtained employment as a land agent to a large estate
in Rutlandshire, which position he fills to this day, with credit to
himself and such advantage to the property as can be expected in these
times. Also, in due course he became the beloved husband of sweet Bessie
Croft, and on the whole he may be considered a happy man. At times,
however, a sorrow overcomes him of which his wife knows nothing, and for
a while he is not himself.
</p><p>He is not a man much addicted to sentiment or speculation, but sometimes
when his day’s work is done, and he strays to his garden gate and looks
out at the dim and peaceful English landscape beyond, and thence to the
wide star-strewn heavens above, he wonders if the hour will ever come
when once more he will see those dark and passionate eyes, and hear that
sweet remembered voice.
</p><p>For John feels as near to his lost love now that she is dead as he
felt while she was yet alive. From time to time indeed he seems to know
without possibility of doubt that if, when death is done with, there
should prove to be an individual future for us suffering mortals, as he
for one believes, certainly he will find Jess waiting to greet him at
its gates.
