<p>At the first warning of Haldidge, Haverland comprehended the
threatened danger in an instant. Catching Ina in his arms, he
sprang into the wood, sheltering himself behind a tree so quickly
that Ina, till that moment, did not comprehend the meaning of
the startling movements around her.</p>

<p>"What is it, father?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, daughter, and don’t move."</p>

<p>She said no more but shrank beneath his sheltering form, believing
that his strong arm was capable of protecting her against any
foe, however formidable.</p>

<p>Graham, at the alarm, had leaped toward Haldidge, and the two
sheltered themselves within a few feet of each other. The shot
of the hunter had been fatal, for that yell, which the North American
Indian, like the animal, gives when he receives his death-wound,
was heard, and the fall had also reached his ears.</p>

<p>Minute after minute passed away and nothing further was heard
of the savages. This silence was as full of meaning, and as dangerous
as any open demonstration upon the part of the Indian. What new
plan they might be concocting was a mystery to all but themselves.
At length Graham ventured to speak:</p>

<p>"What do you suppose they’re up to, Haldidge?"</p>

<p>"Hatching some devilish plot, I expect."</p>

<p>"It seems it requires a good while to do it."</p>

<p>"Don’t get impatient; they’ll show themselves in time."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea of their number?"</p>

<p>"There were something like a half-dozen prowling around."</p>

<p>"There is one less now at any rate."</p>

<p>"I suppose so; but there’s enough left to occasion a little trouble
at least. Where did Alf go with the gal?"</p>

<p>"Off yonder, a short distance. Hadn’t we better get closer together?"</p>

<p>"No; I don’t know as there is any necessity for it. We’re as
safe, drawn up in this style, as in any other I can imagine."</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Haldidge, they will make an attempt to surround
us. In such a case, wouldn’t Haverland be in great peril?"</p>

<p>"They can’t get around him without running their heads in range
with our rifles, and Alf is a man who’ll be pretty sure to discover
such a trick without any help."</p>

<p>"Where can Seth be?"</p>

<p>"Not very far off; that shot of mine will be pretty sure to bring
him."</p>

<p>"Haldidge, how was it that you discovered these Mohawks? Did
you know of their presence before you fired?"</p>

<p>"Yes, long before. I’ve an idea they’ve been tracking you for
an hour or two."</p>

<p>"Why, then, was their attack deferred?"</p>

<p>"They have made no attack, remember. I don’t believe they had
any such intention. There is an ambush somewhere ahead that they
have laid, and it was their idea to walk you into that."</p>

<p>"What was their notion in watching us so closely."</p>

<p>"They were hunting for me, for I heard them say as much, and,
I suppose, in case you didn’t walk into their trap, why they were
going to make the attack."</p>

<p>"Can it be that Seth has fallen into the snare?" asked Graham
in anxious tones.</p>

<p>"No, sir; such a thing can’t be. He isn’t such a fool as that
amounts to. He is making himself generally useful; you can make
your mind to that. He is a smart chap, for all he is the most
awkward, long-legged, gawky person I ever came across."</p>

<p>"I am puzzled to know who he is. It seems to me that he is only
playing a part. Several times in conversing with him, he has used
language such as none but a scholar and polished gentleman would
use. At others and most of the time, he uses that ungainly mode
of expression, which in itself, is laughable. At any rate, whoever
he may be, he is a friend, and the interest which he takes in
the safety of Haverland and his family is as efficient as it is
singular."</p>

<p>"Maybe the interest is in Ina," said Haldidge with a sly look.</p>

<p>"I understand you, but you are mistaken. He has assured me as
much. No; there seems nothing of that feeling at all in him. He
loves her as he would a child, but no more."</p>

<p>"How was it that he made that awkward tumble into the Indians
hands, when they gave you such a hard run for it?"</p>

<p>"That was all through my own blundering. He was cautious enough,
but I became so impatient and careless that I precipitated him
into the danger which would have been fatal to any one else. It
was no fault of his."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it, for it seemed odd to me."</p>

<p>This conversation which we have recorded, it must not be supposed,
was not carried on in an ordinary tone, and with that earnestness
which would have lessened their habitual caution. It was in whispers,
and hardly once during its progress did the two look at each other.
Sometimes they would not speak for several minutes, and then exchange
but a single question and answer.</p>

<p>It was now toward the middle of the afternoon, and it became
pretty evident that the night would have to be spent in this neighborhood.</p>

<p>"I do hope that Seth will make his appearance before dark," remarked
Graham.</p>

<p>"Yes; I hope he will, for it will be dangerous when we can’t
see him."</p>

<p>"He must be aware of the threatened danger."</p>

<p>"Yes; I am pretty confident that he is not very distant."</p>

<p>"Hallo! what’s that?" whispered Graham.</p>

<p>"Ah! keep quiet; there’s something going on there."</p>

<p>A death-like silence reigned for a few minutes; then, a slight
rustling was heard close by Haldidge, and as he turned his alarmed
gaze toward it, the form of Seth Jones rose to his feet beside
him.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?" asked Graham in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I have been watching you. In a little trouble, eh?"</p>

<p>"We’ve found out we’ve got neighbors."</p>

<p>"They’re not very nigh neighbors leastways."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"There isn’t one in a quarter of a mile."</p>

<p>Haldidge and Graham looked at the speaker in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I tell <em>you</em>, it’s so. Hallo, Haverland!" he called,
stepping out from his concealment. "Come out here; there is nothing
to be afraid of."</p>

<p>The manner of the speaker was singular, but the others well knew
that he was not one to expose either himself or others to danger,
and accordingly all gathered around him.</p>

<p>"Are you not running great risk?" asked Haverland, still experiencing
some slight misgivings at stepping upon a spot which he well knew
was so dangerous a short time before.</p>

<p>"No, sir; I reckon you needn’t be at all skeerish, for if there
was any danger of them Mohawks, I wouldn’t be standing here."</p>

<p>"It’s getting toward night, Seth, and we should make up our minds
at once as to what we are going to do or how we are going to spend
it."</p>

<p>"Can you shoot a gun?" asked Seth suddenly, of Ina.</p>

<p>"I don’t believe you can beat me," she answered lightly.</p>

<p>"That is good."</p>

<p>So saying, he stepped into the bushes, where the dead body of
the Indian was lying. Stooping over him, he removed the rifle
from his rigid grasp, took his bullet-pouch and powder, and handed
them to Ina.</p>

<p>"Now, there are five of us, all well armed," said he, "and if
any of them infarnal Mohawks gets ahead of us, we all desarve
red night-caps for it."</p>

<p>"How are we to prevent it, when there seems to be ten times our
number following us?" asked Haverland.</p>

<p>"The way on it is this ere: there is about a dozen trying to
sarcumvent us. They’re now ahead of us, and have laid an ambush
for us. If we can pass that ambush we’re safe as if we was home
fair and sure. And there must be no <em>if</em> about it, for
that ambush must be passed to-night."</p>
