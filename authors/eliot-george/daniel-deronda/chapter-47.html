<p>
  &quot;And you must love him ere to you
  He will seem worthy of your love.&quot;
                         - WORDSWORTH.</p>

<p>One might be tempted to envy Deronda providing new clothes for Mordecai,
and pleasing himself as if he were sketching a picture in imagining the
effect of the fine gray flannel shirts and a dressing-gown very much like
a Franciscan's brown frock, with Mordecai's head and neck above them. Half
his pleasure was the sense of seeing Mirah's brother through her eyes, and
securing her fervid joy from any perturbing impression. And yet, after he
had made all things ready, he was visited with doubt whether he were not
mistaking her, and putting the lower effect for the higher: was she not
just as capable as he himself had been of feeling the impressive
distinction in her brother all the more for that aspect of poverty which
was among the memorials of his past? But there were the Meyricks to be
propitiated toward this too Judaic brother; and Deronda detected himself
piqued into getting out of sight everything that might feed the ready
repugnance in minds unblessed with that precious &quot;seeing,&quot; that bathing of
all objects in a solemnity as of sun-set glow, which is begotten of a
loving reverential emotion.</p>

<p>And his inclination would have been the more confirmed if he had heard the
dialogue round Mrs. Meyrick's fire late in the evening, after Mirah had
gone to her room. Hans, settled now in his Chelsea rooms, had stayed late,
and Mrs. Meyrick, poking the fire into a blaze, said - </p>

<p>&quot;Now, Kate, put out your candle, and all come round the fire cosily. Hans,
dear, do leave off laughing at those poems for the ninety-ninth time, and
come too. I have something wonderful to tell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As if I didn't know that, ma. I have seen it in the corner of your eye
ever so long, and in your pretense of errands,&quot; said Kate, while the girls
came up to put their feet on the fender, and Hans, pushing his chair near
them, sat astride it, resting his fists and chin on the back.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, if you are so wise, perhaps you know that Mirah's brother is
found!&quot; said Mrs. Meyrick, in her clearest accents.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, confound it!&quot; said Hans, in the same moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Hans, that is wicked,&quot; said Mab. &quot;Suppose we had lost you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">cannot</span> help being rather sorry,&quot; said Kate. &quot;And her mother? - where is
she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her mother is dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope the brother is not a bad man,&quot; said Amy.</p>

<p>&quot;Nor a fellow all smiles and jewelry - a Crystal Palace Assyrian with a hat
on,&quot; said Hans, in the worst humor.</p>

<p>&quot;Were there ever such unfeeling children?&quot; said Mrs. Meyrick, a little
strengthened by the need for opposition. &quot;You don't think the least bit of
Mirah's joy in the matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know, ma, Mirah hardly remembers her brother,&quot; said Kate.</p>

<p>&quot;People who are lost for twelve years should never come back again,&quot; said
Hans. &quot;They are always in the way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hans!&quot; said Mrs. Meyrick, reproachfully. &quot;If you had lost me for <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">twenty</span>
years, I should have thought - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said twelve years,&quot; Hans broke in. &quot;Anywhere about twelve years is the
time at which lost relations should keep out of the way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, but it's nice finding people - there is something to tell,&quot; said
Mab, clasping her knees. &quot;Did Prince Camaralzaman find him?&quot;</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Meyrick, in her neat, narrative way, told all she knew without
interruption. &quot;Mr. Deronda has the highest admiration for him,&quot; she ended
 - &quot;seems quite to look up to him. And he says Mirah is just the sister to
understand this brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Deronda is getting perfectly preposterous about those Jews,&quot; said Hans
with disgust, rising and setting his chair away with a bang. &quot;He wants to
do everything he can to encourage Mirah in her prejudices.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, for shame, Hans! - to speak in that way of Mr. Deronda,&quot; said Mab. And
Mrs. Meyrick's face showed something like an under-current of expression
not allowed to get to the surface.</p>

<p>&quot;And now we shall never be all together,&quot; Hans went on, walking about with
his hands thrust into the pockets of his brown velveteen coat, &quot;but we
must have this prophet Elijah to tea with us, and Mirah will think of
nothing but sitting on the ruins of Jerusalem. She will be spoiled as an
artist - mind that - she will get as narrow as a nun. Everything will be
spoiled - our home and everything. I shall take to drinking.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, really, Hans,&quot; said Kate, impatiently. &quot;I do think men are the most
contemptible animals in all creation. Every one of them must have
everything to his mind, else he is unbearable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, oh, oh, it's very dreadful!&quot; cried Mab. &quot;I feel as if ancient Nineveh
were come again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should like to know what is the good of having gone to the university
and knowing everything, if you are so childish, Hans,&quot; said Amy. &quot;You
ought to put up with a man that Providence sends you to be kind to. <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">We</span>
shall have to put up with him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you will all of you like the new Lamentations of Jeremiah - 'to be
continued in our next' - that's all,&quot; said Hans, seizing his wide-awake.
&quot;It's no use being one thing more than another if one has to endure the
company of those men with a fixed idea, staring blankly at you, and
requiring all your remarks to be small foot-notes to their text. If you're
to be under a petrifying wall, you'd better be an old boot. I don't feel
myself an old boot.&quot; Then abruptly, &quot;Good night, little mother, bending to
kiss her brow in a hasty, desperate manner, and condescendingly, on his
way to the door, &quot;Good-night, girls.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose Mirah knew how you are behaving,&quot; said Kate. But her answer was a
slam of the door. &quot;I <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">should</span> like to see Mirah when Mr. Deronda tells
her,&quot; she went on to her mother. &quot;I know she will look so beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>But Deronda, on second thoughts, had written a letter, which Mrs. Meyrick
received the next morning, begging her to make the revelation instead of
waiting for him, not giving the real reason - that he shrank from going
again through a narrative in which he seemed to be making himself
important and giving himself a character of general beneficence - but
saying that he wished to remain with Mordecai while Mrs. Meyrick would
bring Mirah on what was to be understood as a visit, so that there might
be a little interval before that change of abode which he expected that
Mirah herself would propose.</p>

<p>Deronda secretly felt some wondering anxiety how far Mordecai, after years
of solitary preoccupation with ideas likely to have become the more
exclusive from continual diminution of bodily strength, would allow him to
feel a tender interest in his sister over and above the rendering of pious
duties. His feeling for the Cohens, and especially for little Jacob,
showed a persistent activity of affection; but these objects had entered
into his daily life for years; and Deronda felt it noticeable that
Mordecai asked no new questions about Mirah, maintaining, indeed, an
unusual silence on all subjects, and appearing simply to submit to the
changes that were coming over his personal life. He donned the new clothes
obediently, but said afterward to Deronda, with a faint smile, &quot;I must
keep my old garments by me for a remembrance.&quot; And when they were seated,
awaiting Mirah, he uttered no word, keeping his eyelids closed, but yet
showing restless feeling in his face and hands. In fact, Mordecai was
undergoing that peculiar nervous perturbation only known to those whose
minds, long and habitually moving with strong impetus in one current, are
suddenly compelled into a new or reopened channel. Susceptible people,
whose strength has been long absorbed by dormant bias, dread an interview
that imperiously revives the past, as they would dread a threatening
illness. Joy may be there, but joy, too, is terrible.</p>

<p>Deronda felt the infection of excitement, and when he heard the ring at
the door, he went out, not knowing exactly why, that he might see and
greet Mirah beforehand. He was startled to find that she had on the hat
and cloak in which he had first seen her - the memorable cloak that had
once been wetted for a winding-sheet. She had come down-stairs equipped in
this way; and when Mrs. Meyrick said, in a tone of question, &quot;You like to
go in that dress, dear?&quot; she answered, &quot;My brother is poor, and I want to
look as much like him as I can, else he may feel distant from me&quot; - 
imagining that she should meet him in the workman's dress. Deronda could
not make any remark, but felt secretly rather ashamed of his own
fastidious arrangements. They shook hands silently, for Mirah looked pale
and awed.</p>

<p>When Deronda opened the door for her, Mordecai had risen, and had his eyes
turned toward it with an eager gaze. Mirah took only two or three steps,
and then stood still. They looked at each other, motionless. It was less
their own presence that they felt than another's; they were meeting first
in memories, compared with which touch was no union. Mirah was the first
to break the silence, standing where she was.</p>

<p>&quot;Ezra,&quot; she said, in exactly the same tone as when she was telling of her
mother's call to him.</p>

<p>Mordecai with a sudden movement advanced and laid his hand on her
shoulders. He was the head taller, and looked down at her tenderly while
he said, &quot;That was our mother's voice. You remember her calling me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and how you answered her - 'Mother!' - and I knew you loved her.&quot;
Mirah threw her arms round her brother's neck, clasped her little hands
behind it, and drew down his face, kissing it with childlike lavishness,
Her hat fell backward on the ground and disclosed all her curls.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, the dear head, the dear head?&quot; said Mordecai, in a low loving tone,
laying his thin hand gently on the curls.</p>

<p>&quot;You are very ill, Ezra,&quot; said Mirah, sadly looking at him with more
observation.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear child, I shall not be long with you in the body,&quot; was the quiet
answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I will love you and we will talk to each other,&quot; said Mirah, with a
sweet outpouring of her words, as spontaneous as bird-notes. &quot;I will tell
you everything, and you will teach me: - you will teach me to be a good
Jewess - what she would have liked me to be. I shall always be with you
when I am not working. For I work now. I shall get money to keep us. Oh, I
have had such good friends.&quot;</p>

<p>Mirah until now had quite forgotten that any one was by, but here she
turned with the prettiest attitude, keeping one hand on her brother's arm
while she looked at Mrs. Meyrick and Deronda. The little mother's happy
emotion in witnessing this meeting of brother and sister had already won
her to Mordecai, who seemed to her really to have more dignity and
refinement than she had felt obliged to believe in from Deronda's account.</p>

<p>&quot;See this dear lady!&quot; said Mirah. &quot;I was a stranger, a poor wanderer, and
she believed in me, and has treated me as a daughter. Please give my
brother your hand,&quot; she added, beseechingly, taking Mrs. Meyrick's hand
and putting it in Mordecai's, then pressing them both with her own and
lifting them to her lips.</p>

<p>&quot;The Eternal Goodness has been with you,&quot; said Mordecai. &quot;You have helped
to fulfill our mother's prayer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think we will go now, shall we? - and return later,&quot; said Deronda,
laying a gentle pressure on Mrs. Meyrick's arm, and she immediately
complied. He was afraid of any reference to the facts about himself which
he had kept back from Mordecai, and he felt no uneasiness now in the
thought of the brother and sister being alone together.</p>
