<p>Through the gloom of evening, and the flare of torches of the night
before the fair, through the still fogs of the succeeding dawn came
paddling the weary geese, lifting their poor feet that had been
dipped in tar for shoes, and trailing them along the cobble-stones
into the town.  Last of all, in the afternoon, a country girl drove
in her dozen birds, disconsolate because she was so late.  She was
a heavily built girl, fair, with regular features, and yet
unprepossessing.  She needed chiselling down, her contours were
brutal.  Perhaps it was weariness that hung her eyelids a little
lower than was pleasant.  When she spoke to her clumsily lagging
birds it was in a snarling nasal tone.  One of the silly things sat
down in the gutter and refused to move.  It looked very ridiculous,
but also rather pitiful, squat there with its head up, refusing to
be urged on by the ungentle toe of the girl.  The latter swore
heavily, then picked up the great complaining bird, and fronting
her road stubbornly, drove on the lamentable eleven.</p>

<p>No one had noticed her.  This afternoon the women were not sitting
chatting on their doorsteps, seaming up the cotton hose, or swiftly
passing through their fingers the piled white lace; and in the high
dark houses the song of the hosiery frames was hushed:  &quot;Shackety-
boom, Shackety-shackety-boom, Z - zzz!&quot;  As she dragged up Hollow
Stone, people returned from the fair chaffed her and asked her what
o'clock it was.  She did not reply, her look was sullen.  The Lace
Market was quiet as the Sabbath: even the great brass plates on the
doors were dull with neglect.  There seemed an afternoon atmosphere
of raw discontent.  The girl stopped a moment before the dismal
prospect of one of the great warehouses that had been gutted with
fire.  She looked at the lean, threatening walls, and watched her
white flock waddling in reckless misery below, and she would have
laughed out loud had the wall fallen flat upon them and relieved
her of them.  But the wall did not fall, so she crossed the road,
and walking on the safe side, hurried after her charge.  Her look
was even more sullen.  She remembered the state of trade - Trade,
the invidious enemy; Trade, which thrust out its hand and shut the
factory doors, and pulled the stockingers off their seats, and left
the web half-finished on the frame; Trade, which mysteriously
choked up the sources of the rivulets of wealth, and blacker and
more secret than a pestilence, starved the town.  Through this
morose atmosphere of bad trade, in the afternoon of the first day
of the fair, the girl strode down to the Poultry with eleven sound
geese and one lame one to sell.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen were at the bottom of it!  So everybody said, though
nobody quite knew how.  At any rate, they had gone to war with the
Prussians and got beaten, and trade was ruined in Nottingham!</p>

<p>A little fog rose up, and the twilight gathered around.  Then they
flared abroad their torches in the fair, insulting the night.  The
girl still sat in the Poultry, and her weary geese unsold on the
stones, illuminated by the hissing lamp of a man who sold rabbits
and pigeons and such-like assorted live-stock.</p>
