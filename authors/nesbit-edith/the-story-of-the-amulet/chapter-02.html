Long ago - that is to say last summer - the children, finding
themselves embarrassed by some wish which the Psammead had
granted them, and which the servants had not received in a proper
spirit, had wished that the servants might not notice the gifts
which the Psammead gave.  And when they parted from the Psammead
their last wish had been that they should meet it again. 
Therefore they HAD met it (and it was jolly lucky for the
Psammead, as Robert pointed out).  Now, of course, you see that
the Psammead's being where it was, was the consequence of one of
their wishes, and therefore was a Psammead-wish, and as such
could not be noticed by the servants.  And it was soon plain that
in the Psammead's opinion old Nurse was still a servant, although
she had now a house of her own, for she never noticed the
Psammead at all.  And that was as well, for she would never have
consented to allow the girls to keep an animal and a bath of sand
under their bed.</p>

<p>When breakfast had been cleared away - it was a very nice
breakfast with hot rolls to it, a luxury quite out of the common
way - Anthea went and dragged out the bath, and woke the Psammead.</p>

<p>It stretched and shook itself.</p>

<p>'You must have bolted your breakfast most unwholesomely,' it
said, 'you can't have been five minutes over it.'</p>

<p>'We've been nearly an hour,' said Anthea.  'Come - you know you
promised.'</p>

<p>'Now look here,' said the Psammead, sitting back on the sand and
shooting out its long eyes suddenly, 'we'd better begin as we
mean to go on.  It won't do to have any misunderstanding, so I
tell you plainly that - '</p>

<p>'Oh, PLEASE,' Anthea pleaded, 'do wait till we get to the others. 
They'll think it most awfully sneakish of me to talk to you
without them; do come down, there's a dear.'</p>

<p>She knelt before the sand-bath and held out her arms.  The
Psammead must have remembered how glad it had been to jump into
those same little arms only the day before, for it gave a little
grudging grunt, and jumped once more.</p>

<p>Anthea wrapped it in her pinafore and carried it downstairs.  It
was welcomed in a thrilling silence.  At last Anthea said, 'Now
then!'</p>

<p>'What place is this?' asked the Psammead, shooting its eyes out
and turning them slowly round.</p>

<p>'It's a sitting-room, of course,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'Then I don't like it,' said the Psammead.</p>

<p>'Never mind,' said Anthea kindly; 'we'll take you anywhere you
like if you want us to.  What was it you were going to say
upstairs when I said the others wouldn't like it if I stayed
talking to you without them?'</p>

<p>It looked keenly at her, and she blushed.</p>

<p>'Don't be silly,' it said sharply.  'Of course, it's quite
natural that you should like your brothers and sisters to know
exactly how good and unselfish you were.'</p>

<p>'I wish you wouldn't,' said Jane.  'Anthea was quite right.  What
was it you were going to say when she stopped you?'</p>

<p>'I'll tell you,' said the Psammead, 'since you're so anxious to
know.  I was going to say this.  You've saved my life - and I'm
not ungrateful - but it doesn't change your nature or mine. 
You're still very ignorant, and rather silly, and I am worth a
thousand of you any day of the week.'</p>

<p>'Of course you are!' Anthea was beginning but it interrupted her.</p>

<p>'It's very rude to interrupt,' it said; 'what I mean is that I'm
not going to stand any nonsense, and if you think what you've
done is to give you the right to pet me or make me demean myself
by playing with you, you'll find out that what you think doesn't
matter a single penny.  See?  It's what <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> think that matters.'</p>

<p>'I know,' said Cyril, 'it always was, if you remember.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said the Psammead, 'then that's settled.  We're to be
treated as we deserve.  I with respect, and all of you with - but
I don't wish to be offensive.  Do you want me to tell you how I
got into that horrible den you bought me out of?  Oh, I'm not
ungrateful!  I haven't forgotten it and I shan't forget it.'</p>

<p>'Do tell us,' said Anthea.  'I know you're awfully clever, but
even with all your cleverness, I don't believe you can possibly
know how - how respectfully we do respect you.  Don't we?'</p>

<p>The others all said yes - and fidgeted in their chairs.  Robert
spoke the wishes of all when he said - </p>

<p>'I do wish you'd go on.' So it sat up on the green-covered table
and went on.</p>

<p>'When you'd gone away,' it said, 'I went to sand for a bit, and
slept.  I was tired out with all your silly wishes, and I felt as
though I hadn't really been to sand for a year.'</p>

<p>'To sand?' Jane repeated.</p>

<p>'Where I sleep.  You go to bed.  I go to sand.'</p>

<p>Jane yawned; the mention of bed made her feel sleepy.</p>

<p>'All right,' said the Psammead, in offended tones.  'I'm sure <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span>
don't want to tell you a long tale.  A man caught me, and I bit
him.  And he put me in a bag with a dead hare and a dead rabbit. 
And he took me to his house and put me out of the bag into a
basket with holes that I could see through.  And I bit him again. 
And then he brought me to this city, which I am told is called
the Modern Babylon - though it's not a bit like the old
Babylon - and he sold me to the man you bought me from, and then I
bit them both.  Now, what's your news?'</p>

<p>'There's not quite so much biting in our story,' said Cyril
regretfully; 'in fact, there isn't any.  Father's gone to
Manchuria, and Mother and The Lamb have gone to Madeira because
Mother was ill, and don't I just wish that they were both safe
home again.'</p>

<p>Merely from habit, the Sand-fairy began to blow itself out, but
it stopped short suddenly.</p>

<p>'I forgot,' it said; 'I can't give you any more wishes.'</p>

<p>'No - but look here,' said Cyril, 'couldn't we call in old Nurse
and get her to say SHE wishes they were safe home.  I'm sure she
does.'</p>

<p>'No go,' said the Psammead.  'It's just the same as your wishing
yourself if you get some one else to wish for you.  It won't
act.'</p>

<p>'But it did yesterday - with the man in the shop,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'Ah yes,' said the creature, 'but you didn't ASK him to wish, and
you didn't know what would happen if he did.  That can't be done
again.  It's played out.'</p>

<p>'Then you can't help us at all,' said Jane; 'oh - I did think you
could do something; I've been thinking about it ever since we
saved your life yesterday.  I thought you'd be certain to be able
to fetch back Father, even if you couldn't manage Mother.'</p>

<p>And Jane began to cry.</p>

<p>'Now DON'T,' said the Psammead hastily; 'you know how it always
upsets me if you cry.  I can't feel safe a moment.  Look here;
you must have some new kind of charm.'</p>

<p>'That's easier said than done.'</p>

<p>'Not a bit of it,' said the creature; 'there's one of the
strongest charms in the world not a stone's throw from where you
bought me yesterday.  The man that I bit so - the first one, I
mean - went into a shop to ask how much something cost - I think he
said it was a concertina - and while he was telling the man in the
shop how much too much he wanted for it, I saw the charm in a
sort of tray, with a lot of other things.  If you can only buy
THAT, you will be able to have your heart's desire.'</p>

<p>The children looked at each other and then at the Psammead.  Then
Cyril coughed awkwardly and took sudden courage to say what
everyone was thinking.</p>

<p>'I do hope you won't be waxy,' he said; 'but it's like this: when
you used to give us our wishes they almost always got us into
some row or other, and we used to think you wouldn't have been
pleased if they hadn't.  Now, about this charm - we haven't got
over and above too much tin, and if we blue it all on this charm
and it turns out to be not up to much - well - you see what I'm
driving at, don't you?'</p>

<p>'I see that YOU don't see more than the length of your nose, and
THAT'S not far,' said the Psammead crossly.  'Look here, I HAD to
give you the wishes, and of course they turned out badly, in a
sort of way, because you hadn't the sense to wish for what was
good for you.  But this charm's quite different.  I haven't GOT
to do this for you, it's just my own generous kindness that makes
me tell you about it.  So it's bound to be all right.  See?'</p>

<p>'Don't be cross,' said Anthea, 'Please, PLEASE don't.  You see,
it's all we've got; we shan't have any more pocket-money till
Daddy comes home - unless he sends us some in a letter.  But we DO
trust you.  And I say all of you,' she went on, 'don't you think
it's worth spending ALL the money, if there's even the chanciest
chance of getting Father and Mother back safe NOW?  Just think of
it!  Oh, do let's!'</p>

<p>'<span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> don't care what you do,' said the Psammead; 'I'll go back to
sand again till you've made up your minds.'</p>

<p>'No, don't!' said everybody; and Jane added, 'We are quite mind
made-up - don't you see we are?  Let's get our hats.  Will you
come with us?'</p>

<p>'Of course,' said the Psammead; 'how else would you find the
shop?'</p>

<p>So everybody got its hat.  The Psammead was put into a flat
bass-bag that had come from Farringdon Market with two pounds of
filleted plaice in it.  Now it contained about three pounds and a
quarter of solid Psammead, and the children took it in turns to
carry it.</p>

<p>'It's not half the weight of The Lamb,' Robert said, and the
girls sighed.</p>

<p>The Psammead poked a wary eye out of the top of the basket every
now and then, and told the children which turnings to take.</p>

<p>'How on earth do you know?' asked Robert.  'I can't think how you
do it.'</p>

<p>And the Psammead said sharply, 'No - I don't suppose you can.'</p>

<p>At last they came to THE shop.  It had all sorts and kinds of
things in the window - concertinas, and silk handkerchiefs, china
vases and tea-cups, blue Japanese jars, pipes, swords, pistols,
lace collars, silver spoons tied up in half-dozens, and
wedding-rings in a red lacquered basin.  There were officers'
epaulets and doctors' lancets.  There were tea-caddies inlaid
with red turtle-shell and brass curly-wurlies, plates of
different kinds of money, and stacks of different kinds of
plates.  There was a beautiful picture of a little girl washing a
dog, which Jane liked very much.  And in the middle of the window
there was a dirty silver tray full of mother-of-pearl card
counters, old seals, paste buckles, snuff-boxes, and all sorts of
little dingy odds and ends.</p>

<p>The Psammead put its head quite out of the fish-basket to look in
the window, when Cyril said - </p>

<p>'There's a tray there with rubbish in it.'</p>

<p>And then its long snail's eyes saw something that made them
stretch out so much that they were as long and thin as new
slate-pencils.  Its fur bristled thickly, and its voice was quite
hoarse with excitement as it whispered - </p>

<p>'That's it!  That's it!  There, under that blue and yellow
buckle, you can see a bit sticking out.  It's red.  Do you see?'</p>

<p>'Is it that thing something like a horse-shoe?' asked Cyril. 
'And red, like the common sealing-wax you do up parcels with?'
'Yes, that's it,' said the Psammead.  'Now, you do just as you
did before.  Ask the price of other things.  That blue buckle
would do. Then the man will get the tray out of the window.  I
think you'd better be the one,' it said to Anthea.  'We'll wait
out here.'</p>

<p>So the others flattened their noses against the shop window, and
presently a large, dirty, short-fingered hand with a very big
diamond ring came stretching through the green half-curtains at
the back of the shop window and took away the tray.</p>

<p>They could not see what was happening in the interview between
Anthea and the Diamond Ring, and it seemed to them that she had
had time - if she had had money - to buy everything in the shop
before the moment came when she stood before them, her face
wreathed in grins, as Cyril said later, and in her hand the
charm.</p>

<p>It was something like this: [Drawing omitted.] and it was made of
a red, smooth, softly shiny stone.</p>

<p>'I've got it,' Anthea whispered, just opening her hand to give
the others a glimpse of it.  'Do let's get home.  We can't stand
here like stuck-pigs looking at it in the street.'</p>

<p>So home they went.  The parlour in Fitzroy Street was a very flat
background to magic happenings.  Down in the country among the
flowers and green fields anything had seemed - and indeed had
been - possible.  But it was hard to believe that anything really
wonderful could happen so near the Tottenham Court Road.  But the
Psammead was there - and it in itself was wonderful.  And it could
talk - and it had shown them where a charm could be bought that
would make the owner of it perfectly happy.  So the four children
hurried home, taking very long steps, with their chins stuck out,
and their mouths shut very tight indeed.  They went so fast that
the Psammead was quite shaken about in its fish-bag, but it did
not say anything - perhaps for fear of attracting public notice.</p>

<p>They got home at last, very hot indeed, and set the Psammead on
the green tablecloth.</p>

<p>'Now then!' said Cyril.</p>

<p>But the Psammead had to have a plate of sand fetched for it, for
it was quite faint.  When it had refreshed itself a little it
said - </p>

<p>'Now then!  Let me see the charm,' and Anthea laid it on the
green table-cover.  The Psammead shot out his long eyes to look
at it, then it turned them reproachfully on Anthea and said - </p>

<p>'But there's only half of it here!'</p>

<p>This was indeed a blow.</p>

<p>'It was all there was,' said Anthea, with timid firmness.  She
knew it was not her fault. 'There should be another piece,' said
the Psammead, 'and a sort of pin to fasten the two together.'</p>

<p>'Isn't half any good?' - 'Won't it work without the other
bit?' - 'It cost seven-and-six.' - 'Oh, bother, bother,
bother!' - 'Don't be silly little idiots!' said everyone and the
Psammead altogether.</p>

<p>Then there was a wretched silence.  Cyril broke it - </p>

<p>'What shall we do?'</p>

<p>'Go back to the shop and see if they haven't got the other half,'
said the Psammead.  'I'll go to sand till you come back.  Cheer
up! Even the bit you've got is SOME good, but it'll be no end of
a bother if you can't find the other.'</p>

<p>So Cyril went to the shop.  And the Psammead to sand.  And the
other three went to dinner, which was now ready.  And old Nurse
was very cross that Cyril was not ready too.</p>

<p>The three were watching at the windows when Cyril returned, and
even before he was near enough for them to see his face there was
something about the slouch of his shoulders and set of his
knickerbockers and the way he dragged his boots along that showed
but too plainly that his errand had been in vain.</p>

<p>'Well?' they all said, hoping against hope on the front-door
step.</p>

<p>'No go,' Cyril answered; 'the man said the thing was perfect.  He
said it was a Roman lady's locket, and people shouldn't buy
curios if they didn't know anything about arky - something or
other, and that he never went back on a bargain, because it
wasn't business, and he expected his customers to act the same. 
He was simply nasty - that's what he was, and I want my dinner.'</p>

<p>It was plain that Cyril was not pleased.</p>

<p>The unlikeliness of anything really interesting happening in that
parlour lay like a weight of lead on everyone's spirits.  Cyril
had his dinner, and just as he was swallowing the last mouthful
of apple-pudding there was a scratch at the door.  Anthea opened
it and in walked the Psammead.</p>

<p>'Well,' it said, when it had heard the news, 'things might be
worse.  Only you won't be surprised if you have a few adventures
before you get the other half.  You want to get it, of course.'</p>

<p>'Rather,' was the general reply.  'And we don't mind adventures.'</p>

<p>'No,' said the Psammead, 'I seem to remember that about you. 
Well, sit down and listen with all your ears.  Eight, are there? 
Right - I am glad you know arithmetic.  Now pay attention, because
I don't intend to tell you everything twice over.'</p>

<p>As the children settled themselves on the floor - it was far more
comfortable than the chairs, as well as more polite to the
Psammead, who was stroking its whiskers on the hearth-rug - a
sudden cold pain caught at Anthea's heart.  Father - Mother - the
darling Lamb - all far away.  Then a warm, comfortable feeling
flowed through her.  The Psammead was here, and at least half a
charm, and there were to be adventures.  (If you don't know what
a cold pain is, I am glad for your sakes, and I hope you never
may.)</p>

<p>'Now,' said the Psammead cheerily, 'you are not particularly
nice, nor particularly clever, and you're not at all
good-looking.  Still, you've saved my life - oh, when I think of
that man and his pail of water! - so I'll tell you all I know.  At
least, of course I can't do that, because I know far too much. 
But I'll tell you all I know about this red thing.'</p>

<p>'Do!  Do!  Do!  Do!' said everyone.</p>

<p>'Well, then,' said the Psammead.  'This thing is half of an
Amulet that can do all sorts of things; it can make the corn
grow, and the waters flow, and the trees bear fruit, and the
little new beautiful babies come.  (Not that babies ARE
beautiful, of course,' it broke off to say, 'but their mothers
think they are - and as long as you think a thing's true it IS
true as far as you're concerned.)'</p>

<p>Robert yawned.</p>

<p>The Psammead went on.</p>

<p>'The complete Amulet can keep off all the things that make people
unhappy - jealousy, bad temper, pride, disagreeableness,
greediness, selfishness, laziness.  Evil spirits, people called
them when the Amulet was made.  Don't you think it would be nice
to have it?'</p>

<p>'Very,' said the children, quite without enthusiasM.</p>

<p>'And it can give you strength and courage.'</p>

<p>'That's better,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'And virtue.'</p>

<p>'I suppose it's nice to have that,' said Jane, but not with much
interest.</p>

<p>'And it can give you your heart's desire.'</p>

<p>'Now you're talking,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'Of course I am,' retorted the Psammead tartly, 'so there's no
need for you to.'</p>

<p>'Heart's desire is good enough for me,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'Yes, but,' Anthea ventured, 'all that's what the WHOLE charm can
do.  There's something that the half we've got can win off its
own bat - isn't there?'  She appealed to the Psammead.  It nodded.</p>

<p>'Yes,' it said; 'the half has the power to take you anywhere you
like to look for the other half.'</p>

<p>This seemed a brilliant prospect till Robert asked - </p>

<p>'Does it know where to look?'</p>

<p>The Psammead shook its head and answered, 'I don't think it's
likely.'</p>

<p>'Do you?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Then,' said Robert, 'we might as well look for a needle in a
bottle of hay.  Yes - it IS bottle, and not bundle, Father said
so.'</p>

<p>'Not at all,' said the Psammead briskly-, 'you think you know
everything, but you are quite mistaken.  The first thing is to
get the thing to talk.'</p>

<p>'Can it?' Jane questioned.  Jane's question did not mean that she
thought it couldn't, for in spite of the parlour furniture the
feeling of magic was growing deeper and thicker, and seemed to
fill the room like a dream of a scented fog.</p>

<p>'Of course it can.  I suppose you can read.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes!'  Everyone was rather hurt at the question.</p>

<p>'Well, then - all you've got to do is to read the name that's
written on the part of the charm that you've got.  And as soon as
you say the name out loud the thing will have power to do - well,
several things.'</p>

<p>There was a silence.  The red charm was passed from hand to hand.</p>

<p>'There's no name on it,' said Cyril at last.</p>

<p>'Nonsense,' said the Psammead; 'what's that?'</p>

<p>'Oh, THAT!' said Cyril, 'it's not reading.  It looks like
pictures of chickens and snakes and things.'</p>

<p>This was what was on the charm: [Hieroglyphics omitted.]</p>

<p>'I've no patience with you,' said the Psammead; 'if you can't
read you must find some one who can.  A priest now?'</p>

<p>'We don't know any priests,' said Anthea; 'we know a
clergyman - he's called a priest in the prayer-book, you know - but
he only knows Greek and Latin and Hebrew, and this isn't any of
those - I know.'</p>

<p>The Psammead stamped a furry foot angrily.</p>

<p>'I wish I'd never seen you,' it said; 'you aren't any more good
than so many stone images.  Not so much, if I'm to tell the
truth.  Is there no wise man in your Babylon who can pronounce
the names of the Great Ones?'</p>

<p>'There's a poor learned gentleman upstairs,' said Anthea, 'we
might try him.  He has a lot of stone images in his room, and
iron-looking ones too - we peeped in once when he was out.  Old
Nurse says he doesn't eat enough to keep a canary alive.  He
spends it all on stones and things.'</p>

<p>'Try him,' said the Psammead, 'only be careful.  If he knows a
greater name than this and uses it against you, your charm will
be of no use.  Bind him first with the chains of honour and
upright dealing.  And then ask his aid - oh, yes, you'd better all
go; you can put me to sand as you go upstairs.  I must have a few
minutes' peace and quietness.'</p>

<p>So the four children hastily washed their hands and brushed their
hair - this was Anthea's idea - and went up to knock at the door of
the 'poor learned gentleman', and to 'bind him with the chains of
honour and upright dealing'.</p>
