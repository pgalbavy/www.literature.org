<p>"He hasn't changed a bit.... His complexion is as fresh as ever.... The
eyes are a little tired, perhaps ... but he's looking very well...."
</p><p>"When you've finished picking me to pieces, between you!" said Philippe,
laughing. "What an inspection! Why don't you give my wife a kiss? That's
more to the point!"
</p><p>Marthe flung herself into Mme. Morestal's arms and into her
father-in-law's and was examined from head to foot in her turn.
</p><p>"I say, I say, we're thinner in the face than we were!... We want
picking up.... But, my poor children, you're soaked to the skin!"
</p><p>"We were out all through the storm," said Philippe.
</p><p>"And what do you think happened to me?" asked Marthe. "I got
frightened!... Yes, frightened, like a little girl ... and I fainted....
And Philippe had to carry me ... for half an hour at least...."
</p><p>"What do you say to that?" said Morestal to his wife. "For half an
hour! He's the same strong chap he was.... And why didn't you bring the
boys? It's a pity. Two fine little fellows, I feel sure. And well
brought up too: I know my Marthe!... How old are they now? Ten and nine,
aren't they? By the way, mother got two rooms ready. Do you have
separate rooms now?"
</p><p>"Oh, no," said Marthe, "only down here!... Philippe wants to get up
before day-break and ramble about the roads ... whereas I need a little
rest."
</p><p>"Capital! Capital! Show them to their rooms, mother ... and, when you're
ready, children, come down to lunch. As soon as we've finished, I'll
take the carriage and go and fetch your trunks at Saint-Élophe: the
railway-omnibus will have brought them there by this time. And, if I
meet my friend Jorancé, I'll bring him back with me. I expect he's in
the dumps. His daughter left for Lunéville this morning. But she said
she had written to you...."
</p><p>"Yes," said Marthe, "I had a letter from Suzanne the other day. She
didn't seem to like the idea, either, of going away...."
</p><pre>

                                  * *</pre>
<p>Two hours later, Philippe and his wife settled themselves in two pretty,
adjoining bedrooms on the second floor, looking out on the French side.
Marthe threw herself on her bed and fell asleep almost immediately,
while her husband, with his elbows on the window-sill, sat gazing at the
peaceful valley where the happiest days of his boyhood had been spent.
</p><p>It was over yonder, in the straggling village of Saint-Élophe-la-Côte,
in the modest dwelling which his parents occupied before they moved to
the Old Mill. He was at the boarding-school at Noirmont and used to have
glorious holidays playing in the village or roaming about the Vosges
with his father: Papa Trompette, as he always called him, because of all
the trumpets, bugles, horns and cornets which, together with drums of
every shape and kind, swords and dirks, helmets and breast-plates, guns
and pistols, were the only presents that his childhood knew. Morestal
was a little strict; a little too fond of everything that had to do with
principle, custom, discipline, exactness; a little quick-tempered; but,
at the same time, he was the kindest of men and had no difficulty in
winning his son's love, his frank and affectionate respect.
</p><p>Their only quarrel was on the day when Philippe, who was then in the top
form, announced his intention of continuing his studies after he had
passed his examination and of entering the Normal School. The father's
whole dream was shattered, his great dream of seeing Philippe in
uniform, with his sword at his side and the gold braid on the sleeve of
his loose jacket.
</p><p>It came as a violent and painful shock; and Morestal was stupefied to
find himself faced by an obstinate, deliberate Philippe, a Philippe
wholly master of himself and firmly resolved to lead his life according
to his own views and his own ambitions. For a week on end, the two
argued, hurt each other's feelings, made it up again, only to fall out
once more. Then the father suddenly yielded, in the middle of a
discussion and as though he had all at once realized the futility of his
efforts:
</p><p>"You have made up your mind?" he cried. "Very well! An usher you shall
be, since that is your ideal; but I warn you that I decline all
responsibility for the future and that I wash my hands of anything that
happens."
</p><p>What happened was simply that Philippe's career was swift and brilliant
and that, after a probationary term at Lunéville and another at
Châteauroux, he was appointed professor of history at Versailles. He
then published, at a few months' interval, two remarkable books, which
caused much heated controversy: <u>The Idea of Country in Ancient Greece</u>
and <u>The Idea of Country before the Revolution</u>. Three years later, he
was promoted to Paris, to the Lycée Carnot.
</p><p>Philippe was now approaching his fortieth year. Day-work and night-work
seemed to have no effect upon his sturdy highland constitution.
Possessing a set of powerful muscles and built on the same strong lines
as his father, he found rest and recreation from study in violent
exercise, in long bicycle-rides into the country or through the woods on
the outskirts of Paris. The boys at the school, who held him in a sort
of veneration, told stories of his exploits and his feats of strength.
</p><p>With all this, a great look of gentleness, especially about the eyes, a
pair of very good, blue eyes, which smiled when he spoke and which, when
at rest, were candid, childish almost, filled with dreams and kindness.
</p><p>By this time, old Morestal was proud of his son. On the day when he
heard of his nomination to Carnot, he wrote, frankly:
</p>
<pre>
     "Well done, my dear Philippe! So you're prospering now and in a
     fair way to obtain anything you like to ask for. Let me tell you
     that I am not in the least surprised, for I always expected that,
     with your great qualities, your perseverance and your serious way
     of looking at life, you would win the place which you deserved. So,
     once more, well done!
     "I confess, however, that your last book, on the idea of country
     in France, puzzled me not a little. I know, of course, that you
     will not change your opinions on this subject; but it seems to me
     that you are trying to explain the idea of patriotism as due to
     rather inferior motives and that this idea strikes you not as
     natural and inherent to human societies, but as though it were a
     momentary and passing phase of civilization. No doubt I have
     misunderstood you. Still, your book is not very clear. You almost
     appear to be hesitating. I shall look forward eagerly to the new
     work, on the idea of country in our own times and in the future,
     which I see that you are announcing...."</pre>

<p>The book to which Morestal alluded had been finished for over a year,
during which Philippe, for reasons which he kept to himself, refused to
deliver the manuscript to his publishers.
</p><pre>
                                   *
                                  * *</pre>
<p>"Are you glad to be here?"
</p><p>Marthe had come up and folded her two hands over his arm.
</p><p>"Very," he said. "And I should be still more pleased if I had not that
explanation with my father before me ... the explanation which I came
down here to have."
</p><p>"It will be all right, my own Philippe. Your father is so fond of you.
And then you are so sincere!..."
</p><p>"My dear Marthe," he said, kissing her affectionately on the forehead.
</p><p>He had first met her at Lunéville, through M. Jorancé, who was her
distant cousin; and he had at once felt that she was the ideal companion
of his life, who would stand by him in hours of trouble, who would bear
him comely children, who would understand how to bring them up and how,
with his assistance and with his principles, to make sturdy men of them,
worthy to bear his name.
</p><p>Perhaps Marthe would have liked something more; perhaps, as a girl, she
had dreamt that a married woman is not merely the wife and mother, but
also her husband's lover. But she soon saw that love went for little
with Philippe, a studious man, much more interested in mental
speculation and social problems than in any manifestation of sentimental
feeling. She therefore loved him as he wished to be loved, stifling
within herself, like smothered flames, a whole throbbing passion made up
of unsatisfied longings, restrained ardours and needless jealousies and
allowing only just so much of this to escape her as was needed to give
him fresh courage at times of doubt and defeat.
</p><p>Short, slender and of delicate build, she was plucky, hardened to
trouble, fearless in the face of obstacles, proof against disappointment
after a check. Her bright, dark eyes betokened her energy. In spite of
all the influence which Philippe wielded over her, in spite of the
admiration with which he inspired her, she retained her personality, her
own standpoint towards life, her likes and dislikes. And, to such a man
as Philippe, nothing could be more precious.
</p><p>"Won't you try and sleep a little?" she asked.
</p><p>"No. I am going down to him."
</p><p>"To your father?" she asked, anxiously.
</p><p>"Yes, I don't want to put it off any longer. As it is, I have almost
done wrong in coming here and embracing him without first letting him
know the exact truth about me."
</p><p>They were silent for a while. Philippe seemed undecided and worried.
</p><p>He said to her:
</p><p>"Don't you agree with me? Or do you think I ought to wait till
to-morrow?..."
</p><p>She opened the door for him to pass:
</p><p>"No," she said, "you are right."
</p><p>She often had those unexpected movements which cut short hesitation and
put you face to face with events. Another would have launched out into
words. But Marthe never shirked responsibility, even where it concerned
but the smallest facts of ordinary life. Philippe used to laugh and
call it her daily heroism.
</p><p>He kissed her and felt strengthened by her confidence.
</p><p>Downstairs, he was told that his father was not yet back and he resolved
to wait for him in the drawing-room. He lit a cigarette, let it go out
again and, at first in a spirit of distraction and then with a growing
interest, looked around him, as though he were trying to gather from
inanimate objects particulars relating to the man who lived in their
midst.
</p><p>He examined the rack containing the twelve rifles. They were all loaded,
ready for service. Against what foe?
</p><p>He saw the flag which he had so often gazed upon in the old house at
Saint-Élophe, the old, torn flag whose glorious history he knew so well.
</p><p>He saw the maps hanging on the wall, all of which traced the frontier in
its smallest details, together with the country adjoining it on either
side of the Vosges.
</p><p>He bent over the shelves of the little book-case and read the titles of
the works: <u>The War of 1870, prepared in the historical section of the
German General Staff</u>; <u>The Retreat of Bourbaki</u>; <u>The Way to prepare
our Revenge</u>; <u>The Crime of the Peace-at-any-Price Party</u>....
</p><p>But one volume caught his attention more particularly. It was his own
book on the idea of country. He turned the pages and, seeing that some
of them were covered and scored with pencil-marks, he sat down and began
to read:
</p><p>"It's as I thought," he muttered, presently. "How are he and I to
understand each other henceforth? What common ground is there between
us? I cannot expect him to accept my ideas. And how can I submit to
his?"
</p><p>He went on reading and noticed comments the harshness of which
distressed him beyond measure. Twenty minutes passed in this way,
disturbed by no sound but that of the leaves which he turned as he read.
</p><p>And, suddenly, he felt two bare arms round his head, two cool, bare arms
stroking his face. He tried to release himself. The two arms clasped him
all the tighter.
</p><p>He made an abrupt effort and rose to his feet:
</p><p>"You!" he cried, stepping back. "You here, Suzanne!"
</p><p>A most attractive creature stood before him, at once smiling and
bashful, in an attitude of provocation and fear, with hands clasped,
then with arms again outstretched, beautiful, white, fragrant arms that
showed below the short sleeves of her fine cambric blouse. Her fair hair
was divided into two loose waves, whose rebellious curls played about
at random. She had grey, almond-shaped eyes, half-veiled by their dark
lashes; and her tiny teeth laughed at the edge of her red lips, lips so
red that one would have thought--and been quite wrong in thinking--that
they were painted.
</p><p>It was Suzanne Jorancé, the daughter of Jorancé the special commissary
and a friend of Marthe, who knew her when she was quite a child at
Lunéville. Suzanne had spent four months, last winter, in Paris with the
Philippe Morestals.
</p><p>"You!" he repeated. "You, Suzanne!"
</p><p>She replied, gaily:
</p><p>"Myself. Your father came to call on us at Saint-Élophe. And, as mine
was out for a walk, he brought me back with him. I have just got out of
the carriage. And here I am."
</p><p>He seized her by the wrists, in a fit of anger, and, in a hollow voice:
</p><p>"You had no business to be at Saint-Élophe. You wrote to Marthe that you
were going away this morning. You ought not to have stayed. You know
quite well that you ought not to have stayed."
</p><p>"Why?" she asked, quite confused.
</p><p>"Why? Because, at the end of your visit to Paris, you spoke to me in
words which I was entitled to interpret ... which I took to mean ...
And I would not have come, if you had not written that you were...."
</p><p>He broke off, embarrassed by the violence of his own outburst. The tears
stood in Suzanne's eyes and her face had flushed so deep a red that her
crimson lips seemed hardly red at all.
</p><p>Petrified by the words which he had uttered and still more by those
which he had been on the verge of uttering, Philippe suddenly, in the
girl's presence, felt a need to be gentle and friendly and to make
amends for his inexplicable rudeness. An unexpected sense of pity
softened him. He took the small, ice-cold hands between his own and
said, kindly, with the intonation of a big brother scolding a younger
sister:
</p><p>"Why did you stay, Suzanne?"
</p><p>"May I tell you, Philippe?"
</p><p>"Certainly, or I shouldn't ask you," he replied, a little nervously.
</p><p>"I wanted to see you, Philippe.... When I knew that you were coming ...
and that, by delaying my departure by one day ... just one day.... You
understand, don't you?..."
</p><p>He was silent, rightly thinking that, if he answered the least word, she
would at once say something that he did not want to hear. And they no
longer knew how to stand opposite each other and they no longer dared
look each other in the face. But Philippe felt those small hands turn
warm at the touch of his and felt all the life rush once more through
that turbulent young being, like a source that is released and brings
back joy and strength and hope.
</p><p>Steps were heard and a sound of voices rose in the hall outside.
</p><p>"M. Morestal," Suzanne whispered.
</p><p>And old Morestal shouted, long before entering the room:
</p><p>"Where are you, Suzanne? Here's your father coming. Quick, Jorancé, the
children are here. Yes, yes, your daughter, too.... I brought her back
with me from Saint-Élophe.... But how did you come? Through the woods?"
</p><p>Suzanne slipped on a pair of long suède gloves and, at the moment when
the door opened, said, in a tone of implacable resolve and as though the
promise must needs fill Philippe's heart with delight:
</p><p>"No one shall ever see my bare arms again.... No one, Philippe, I swear
to you.... No one shall ever stroke them...."
