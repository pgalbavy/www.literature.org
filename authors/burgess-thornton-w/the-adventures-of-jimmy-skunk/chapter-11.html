<p>  Keep your word, whate'er you do,   And to your inmost self
be true.</p>

<p>When Jimmy Skunk shouted down the hall of Johnny Chuck's old
house to Peter Rabbit that he would come back at dark, he was
half joking. He did it to make Peter uneasy and to worry him.
The truth is, Jimmy was no longer angry at all. He had quite recovered
his good nature and was very much inclined to laugh himself over
Peter's trick. But he felt that it wouldn't do to let Peter off
without some kind of punishment, and so he decided to frighten
Peter a little. He knew that Peter wouldn't dare come out during
the daytime because of the Yellow Jackets whose home was just
inside the doorway of that old house; and he knew that Peter wouldn't
dare face him, for he would be afraid of being treated as Reddy
Fox had been. So that is why he told Peter that he was coming
back at dark. He felt that if Peter was kept a prisoner in there
for a while, all the time worrying about how he was to get out,
he would be very slow to try such a trick again.</p>

<p>As Jimmy ambled away to look for some beetles, he chuckled and
chuckled and chuckled. "I guess that by this time Peter wishes
he hadn't thought of that joke on Reddy Fox and myself," said
he. "Perhaps I'll go back there tonight and perhaps I won't. He
won't know whether I do or not, and he won't dare come out."</p>

<p>Then he stopped and scratched his head thoughtfully. Then he
sighed. Then he scratched his head again and once more sighed.
"I really don't want to go back there tonight," he muttered, "but
I guess I'll have to. I said I would, and so I'll have to do it.
I believe in keeping my word. If I shouldn't and some day he should
find it out, he wouldn't believe me the next time I happened to
say I would do a thing. Yes, Sir, I'll have to go back. There
is nothing like making people believe that when you say a thing
you mean it. There is nothing like keeping your word to make people
respect you."</p>

<p>Being naturally rather lazy, Jimmy decided not to go any farther
than the edge of the Old Orchard, which was only a little way
above Johnny Chuck's old house, where Peter was a prisoner. There
Jimmy found a warm, sunny spot and curled up for a nap. In fact,
he spent all the day there. When jolly, round, red Mr. Sun went
to bed behind the Purple Hills, and the Black Shadows came trooping
across the Green Meadows, Jimmy got up, yawned, chuckled, and
then slowly ambled down to Johnny Chuck's old house. A look at
the footprints in the sand on the doorstep told him that Peter
had not come out. Jimmy sat down and waited until it was quite
dark. Then he poked his head in at the doorway. The Yellow Jackets
had gone to bed for the night.</p>

<p>"Come out, Peter. I'm waiting for you!" he called down the hall,
and made his voice sound as angry as he could. But inside he was
chuckling. Then Jimmy Skunk calmly turned and went about his business.
He had kept his word.</p>

<p>As for Peter Rabbit, that had been one of the very worst days
he could recall. He had ached and smarted from the stings of the
Yellow Jackets; he had worried all day about what would happen
to him if he did meet Jimmy Skunk, and he was hungry. He had had
just a little bit of hope, and this was that Jimmy Skunk wouldn't
come back when it grew dark. He had crept part way up the hall
at the first hint of night and stretched himself out to wait until
he could be sure that those dreadful Yellow Jackets had gone to
sleep. He had just about made up his mind that it was safe for
him to scamper out when Jimmy Skunk's voice came down the hall
to him. Poor Peter! The sound of that voice almost broke his heart.</p>

<p>"He has come back. He's kept his word," he half sobbed as he
once more went back to Johnny Chuck's old bedroom.</p>

<p>There he stayed nearly all the rest of the night, though his
stomach was so empty it ached. Just before it was time for Mr.
Sun to rise, Peter ventured to dash out of Johnny Chuck's old
house. He got past the home of the Yellow Jackets safely, for
they were not yet awake. With his heart in his mouth, he sprang
out of the doorway. Jimmy Skunk wasn't there. With a sigh of relief,
Peter started for the dear, safe Old Briar-patch, lipperty-lipperty-lip,
as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>"I'll never, never play another joke," he said, over and over
again as he ran.</p>
