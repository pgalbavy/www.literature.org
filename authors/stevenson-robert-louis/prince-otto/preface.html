<p><strong>TO NELLY VAN DE GRIFT</strong><br/>
<strong>(MRS. ADULFO SANCHEZ, OF MONTEREY)</strong>
</p>
<p>At last, after so many years, I have the pleasure of re-introducing you
to ‘Prince Otto,’ whom you will remember a very little fellow, no bigger
in fact than a few sheets of memoranda written for me by your kind hand.
The sight of his name will carry you back to an old wooden house
embowered in creepers; a house that was far gone in the respectable
stages of antiquity and seemed indissoluble from the green garden in
which it stood, and that yet was a sea-traveller in its younger days, and
had come round the Horn piecemeal in the belly of a ship, and might have
heard the seamen stamping and shouting and the note of the boatswain’s
whistle.  It will recall to you the nondescript inhabitants now so widely
scattered:—the two horses, the dog, and the four cats, some of them still
looking in your face as you read these lines;—the poor lady, so
unfortunately married to an author;—the China boy, by this time, perhaps,
baiting his line by the banks of a river in the Flowery Land;—and in
particular the Scot who was then sick apparently unto death, and whom you
did so much to cheer and keep in good behaviour.
</p><p>You may remember that he was full of ambitions and designs: so soon as he
had his health again completely, you may remember the fortune he was to
earn, the journeys he was to go upon, the delights he was to enjoy and
confer, and (among other matters) the masterpiece he was to make of
‘Prince Otto’!
</p><p>Well, we will not give in that we are finally beaten.  We read together
in those days the story of Braddock, and how, as he was carried dying
from the scene of his defeat, he promised himself to do better another
time: a story that will always touch a brave heart, and a dying speech
worthy of a more fortunate commander.  I try to be of Braddock’s mind.  I
still mean to get my health again; I still purpose, by hook or crook,
this book or the next, to launch a masterpiece; and I still
intend—somehow, some time or other—to see your face and to hold your
hand.
</p><p>Meanwhile, this little paper traveller goes forth instead, crosses the
great seas and the long plains and the dark mountains, and comes at last
to your door in Monterey, charged with tender greetings.  Pray you, take
him in.  He comes from a house where (even as in your own) there are
gathered together some of the waifs of our company at Oakland: a
house—for all its outlandish Gaelic name and distant station—where you
are well-beloved.
</p><p>                                                                  R. L. S.
</p><p><u>Skerryvore</u>,
</p><p>      Bournemouth.
