<p>The indistinct object gradually took shape, and the boys then
saw Shasta sitting in his small canoe, while directly behind him
was Tim O'Rooney, his left hand extended backward and grasping
the prow of his own boat, which was being towed by the Indian.</p>

<p>The next moment the foremost lightly touched the shore and the
savage sprung out, quickly followed by the Irishman.</p>

<p>"I beg yez pardon, boys, for the time I tuk to git your dinner;
but to shpake the thruth, I was unavoidably detained, as me brother
writ me when he was locked up in Tipperary jail on his way to
visit me."</p>

<p>"We are glad enough to see you again, but where is your game?"</p>

<p>"Worrah, worrah, but I had bad luck wid it. When I tuk it ashore,
I sat it down for a minit, and I hadn't the time to pick it up
again."</p>

<p>"But tell us all about it."</p>

<p>This was quickly done, up to the point where Tim was saved by
the timely appearance of the grizzly bear, when, as may well be
supposed, the expressions of wonder were loud and continued.</p>

<p>"You saw nothing more of your pursuers?" asked Howard.</p>

<p>"Not a bit&mdash;nor be the same towken do I think they saw me."</p>

<p>"How did you and Shasta meet?"</p>

<p>"That was shtrange, was the same. After I found I was cl'ar of
the varmints, from the raisin that their exclusive attention was
occupied by the b'ar, I stopped and went to thinking&mdash;did I. I
could saa the great necessity of our having me own canoe and I
went back to whom I left the same. It took me some time to find
it, and when I did find it, it wasn't it, but the one that belonged
to the red gintlemen.</p>

<p>"There was little difference atwixt the two and I thought the
best thing was to make a thrade, and just as I thought that I
spied another canoe coming along the shore as though it was looking
for something. I stepped back and raised the hammer of my gun,
when I obsarved there was but one Injin in the same&mdash;was there.
So, 'Tim,' says I, ''twould be a shame,' and I lowered me gun
agin.</p>

<p>"Just then, and fur the life of me I don't know what put it into
me head, I thought it was Shasta, though I knowed I had lift him
with a big pain all through him. So I give a low whistle like,
and called out 'Shasta,' and with one whip of his paddle he sent
his canoe right at my faat, though I was sure he didn't saa me,
and then waited fur me to step in.</p>

<p>"But he's a quaar fellow, is Shasta," added Tim. "I rached out
me hand to shake his own, but he never noticed it, but motioned
fur me to stow mesilf into the bottom of the canoe; and thin,
after some muttering and throwing of his arms, I could saa he
wanted me to howld on to the other canoe."</p>

<p>"And I did the same, and the way he towed us over the water would
have frightened a steamboat."</p>

<p>"He is a smart fellow, indeed."</p>

<p>The Indian upon landing had just pulled his canoe slightly up
the bank and then had gone at once to the opposite side of the
island where he had lain when sick. They could see him walking
slowly back and forth us if searching for something which he had
some difficulty in finding.</p>

<p>"Well, boys, I shpose you are hungry," said Tim, "If yez isn't
I begins to howld a very strong suspicion that it's meself that
is."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Elwood, "we are both very hungry, but we had little
appetite so long as we knew you were in danger."</p>

<p>"It was very kind of yez to restrain your appetite out of respict
to me, and I'll not forgit to do the same when yez git into throuble."</p>

<p>"We can afford to go supperless to-night," remarked Howard, "and
feast on the contemplation of our good fortune. There was a time
when our prospects looked pretty dark."</p>

<p>"Yis, sir; you may well say that. When I had the big bear walking
at me from one direction and the three red gintlemen from the
other, I thought to mesilf what a shplendid opportunity there
was for the illigant exercise of one's idaas. But it was all the
doings of the good Lord above," added Tim very reverently.</p>

<p>"Yes; there can be no doubt of that," replied Howard. "He has
cared for us all the time."</p>

<p>Tim now gave an account of his adventures in his hunt after the
deer, previous to when he was first seen from the island. When
he had finished Elwood asked:</p>

<p>"Are we to stay here over night?"</p>

<p>"I think not, but I defers to the judgment of Mr. Shasta. It's
just as he says about it."</p>

<p>"He appears to be taken up with something over yonder."</p>

<p>"He is searching for some object that he left when he made up
his mind to get well," said Howard.</p>

<p>"He must know all that has occurred, for when we came back from
watching you, there he stood with his arms folded, and a look
in his eye that said he understood more about matters and things
than we imagined he did."</p>

<p>"He must know that we are in danger so long as we are upon this
island, and I should think he would leave it while it is dark."'</p>

<p>"Do yez rest on that pint?" said Tim. "The red gintlemen will
attind to the same&mdash;will he."</p>

<p>At this juncture the Pah Utah was observed walking slowly toward
them, his long blanket grasped at the breast by his left hand,
while his right was free. As soon as he came up he pointed at
the canoes and muttered something.</p>

<p>"What does he mean?" asked Elwood.</p>

<p>"Terror understands him better than we do," replied Howard, as
the Newfoundland sprung into the larger boat and nestled down
near the stern.</p>

<p>Our friends were not long in imitating the action of the dog.
Tim made as if to step into the Indian's boat, but he motioned
him back, and took his seat in the front of the larger canoe.
The savage now produced a cord, probably the tendon of some wild
animal, with which he speedily fastened the prow of the larger
canoe to the stem of his own.</p>

<p>This done he turned the head down stream and began using his
paddle with the same wonderful dexterity he had displayed during
the afternoon. The boys watched and admired his skill for a long
time. The faint moon barely revealed the shores on either hand,
stretching away in misty gloom, while all before and behind them
was darkness.</p>

<p>The muscular arms of Shasta appeared to be as tireless as the
piston-rods of an engine, and at last our friends grow weary of
watching him. The boys became drowsy, and they finally lay down
in the bottom of the boat, with their blanket over them, and went
to sleep.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour Tim did the same, and the Pah Utah was
this left alone to ply the canoe, the Newfoundland now and then
raising his head and looking over the edge as if to satisfy himself
that all was right.</p>

<p>Once near the middle of the night Elwood awoke, and pushing his
blanket from his face, raised himself on his elbow and looked
around. The same picture met his eye&mdash;the dark-hued Shasta, his
long hair streaming over his shoulders, the blanket down to his
waist, and his bronzed arms working with the silence, skill and
regularity of a perfect machine.</p>
