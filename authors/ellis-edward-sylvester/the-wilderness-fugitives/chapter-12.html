<p>Ear and eye were strained to catch sound or sight that would
tell something of their enemies. All, even the Mohawk, expected
to hear the ripple of the paddles of the Iroquois in pursuit,
but the stillness of the tomb was not more profound than that
in which they were now enfolded. Probably a half mile below them
another light was seen shining, and almost directly opposite was
a similar one. It looked as if the Iroquois were signaling to
one another; and, if it so happened that this scow, with its occupants,
was the object of these communications, the latter might well
feel anxiety about their situation.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo seemed puzzled to find that there was no evidence
of his enemies being immediately behind them, for he was confident
that the light which had arrested the forward movement of the
boat was not only in the hands of one of the Iroquois, but was
intended as a signal to apprise others that the fugitives had
been discovered, and the time had come to close in upon them.
What, therefore, meant this profound stillness, at a time when
the sounds of the most active pursuit ought to have been heard?
Could it mean, after all, that the light was an accident, and
the redmen had seen nothing of the fugitives stealing in upon
them? While the Mohawk was revolving the matter in his mind, Rosa
Minturn uttered a suppressed exclamation:</p>

<p>"See there!"</p>

<p>It so happened, at that moment, that she was the only one of
the party gazing in the direction of the shore which they had
originally left, and she alone made the discovery that instantly
turned all eyes in that direction. Exactly at the spot where they
would have been landed by the Mohawk&mdash;allowing for the inevitable
dropping down stream&mdash;was still another light, resembling the
first that had startled them.</p>

<p>This was complicating matters, indeed, and the alarm of the whites
became greater than at any time since starting. It looked as if
they had not only been detected, but that the Iroquois had quietly
perfected their preparations for capturing them. The Mohawk, as
was his peculiarity under all circumstances, was as cool as ever,
and he looked back and forth as if not particularly desirous of
learning who were the torch-bearers.</p>

<p>"Don't stand up," he whispered, fearing that some of his companions
would rise to their feet in their excitement.</p>

<p>There was a possibility that the fugitives had not been detected,
though the probabilities were against such a hopeful fact. It
would have seemed to an uninterested spectator that if the Iroquois
were aware that the party whom they were seeking had embarked,
they would have kept them under surveillance until they learned
where they were likely to land, and then would have made preparations
to capture them as they left the boat. Such was the simplest plan,
and it would have been more effective than any other. That they
had neglected to do so was ground for the hope of the Mohawk that
he and his friends were still undiscovered.</p>

<p>It was equally probable that the redmen on the southeastern shore,
having learned that their game was coming into their hands, had
signaled the fact to their allies across the Susquehanna, so that
they might be prepared for the retrograde movement which was actually
made. Under the circumstances, there was but one thing remaining
for the Mohawk to do, and that was to drift with the current until
below the point where the last light had shown itself, and then
to make an effort to land. Fortunately, the woods were dense at
this place, so that if they could secure a foothold once more,
there was a good prospect that this natural protection could be
turned to account. And this was what the guide now attempted to
do.</p>

<p>Stooping low in the boat, so that his head and shoulders barely
appeared above the gunwale, he held the pole ready to use any
instant it might be required, and patiently awaited the moment
when the flat-bottomed craft should reach the point desired. The
excitement was the more intense because none dared move, and all
were in a state of expectancy that made the suspense of the most
trying nature. It seemed to the whites as they peeped cautiously
over the low gunwale of the scow, that the moon threw double the
light that it did when they were in the middle of the river and
anxious to gain a view of the land they were seeking to reach.
Again and again Rosa was sure she saw shadowy figures stealing
along in the darkness, watching them with the keenness of so many
lynxes, and quite as frequently she was equally sure she detected
stealthy movements by the sound of the moccasin-covered feet on
the bank.</p>

<p>Before they were a dozen feet below the point where the light
was seen, it vanished from sight and the gloom enveloped them
on every hand. While this was taken as another ominous sign by
the whites, the Mohawk did not accept it as such. If the torches
were meant as signals, nothing was more natural than that, having
performed their duty, they should be withdrawn. The four parties
in the scow maintained their cramped positions until the boat
was a hundred yards below where the alarming light was seen. At
this time, the Mohawk rose partly to his feet still keeping the
greater portion of his body concealed, and the pole was carefully
thrust over the side into the water.</p>

<p>No noise accompanied the cautious movement, but the others noticed
that the boat felt the impulse at once. Lena-Wingo was using it
for its legitimate purpose, and was gradually, but none the less
certainly, working in toward the land. It seemed to the others
that such a proceeding was dangerous in the highest degree, for
the boat, on account of its size, was likely to attract attention.
It was impossible that the others should keep their own persons
out of sight when the situation was so critical. Ned and Jo closed
their hands upon their rifles, ready to use them at an instant's
notice, for to them nothing was more probable than that they would
be called upon to resist an attack as soon as, if not before,
they placed their feet on the shore.</p>

<p>When they were within a rod or so, the Mohawk ceased work with
the pole, and devoted himself to listening for a short time. Unlike
the others, he did not confine his observations to a single spot,
but peered toward every point of the compass, on the watch for
some canoe creeping down upon them from the other side of the
stream. His keen vision was unable to detect anything upon the
surface of the stream itself, but he saw once more the light that
had caused them to turn back from landing. It was in very nearly
the same spot, too, where it was first seen, and, what was more,
it was moving precisely as if intended to convey a hasty message
to parties on the opposite side the stream.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo studied the action closely, for he was capable of
reading many of the signs of the Iroquois unknowable to others,
and there was a chance for him to gain important information.
The torch was not merely vibrating as if carried by a person walking
along the margin of the river, but it was swung round in a circle,
slowly and impressively, beginning in this fashion, and increasing
until it resembled a fiery wheel. Suddenly it disappeared, and
all was darkness and stillness again on both sides of the Susquehanna.</p>

<p>"The whites and the Mohawk scout are on the river, and will try
to return to the shore which they left."</p>

<p>This was the interpretation of Lena-Wingo, and it was about impossible
for him to make any mistake. The retrogression of the fugitives
had been detected, and the confederates on the bank toward which
they were working their way were notified to be prepared for their
coming. Certainly it was high time that the little party in the
scow looked to what they were doing.</p>
