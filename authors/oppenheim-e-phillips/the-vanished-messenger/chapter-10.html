<P>
Mr. Fentolin raised to his lips the little gold whistle which hung
from his neck and blew it.  He seemed to devote very little effort
to the operation, yet the strength of the note was wonderful.  As
the echoes died away, he let it fall by his side and waited with
a pleased smile upon his lips.  In a few seconds there was the
hurried flutter of skirts and the sound of footsteps.  The girl who
had just completed her railway journey entered, followed by her
brother.  They were both a little out of breath, they both
approached the chair without a smile, the girl in advance, with a
certain expression of apprehension in her eyes.  Mr. Fentolin sighed.
He appeared to notice these things and regret them.
<P>
"My child," he said, holding out his hands, "my dear Esther, welcome
home again!  I heard the car outside.  I am grieved that you did not
at once hurry to my side."
<P>
"I have not been in the house two minutes," Esther replied, "and I
haven't seen mother yet.  Forgive me."
<P>
She had come to a standstill a few yards away.  She moved now very
slowly towards the chair, with the air of one fulfilling a hateful
task.  The fingers which accepted his hands were extended almost
hesitatingly.  He drew her closer to him and held her there.
<P>
"Your mother, my dear Esther, is, I regret to say, suffering from
a slight indisposition," he remarked.  "She has been confined to
her room for the last few days.  Just a trifling affair of the
nerves; nothing more, Doctor Sarson assures me.  But my dear child,"
he went on, "your fingers are as cold as ice.  You look at me so
strangely, too.  Alas! you have not the affectionate disposition
of your dear mother.  One would scarcely believe that we have been
parted for more than a week."
<P>
"For more than a week," she repeated, under her breath.
<P>
"Stoop down, my dear.  I must kiss your forehead - there!  Now
bring up a chair to my side.  You seem frightened - alarmed.  Have
you ill news for me?"
<P>
"I have no news," she answered, gradually recovering herself.
<P>
"The gaieties of London, I fear," he protested gently, "have proved
a little unsettling."
<P>
"There were no gaieties for me," the girl replied bitterly.  "Mrs.
Sargent obeyed your orders very faithfully.  I was not allowed to
move out except with her."
<P>
"My dear child, you would not go about London unchaperoned!"
<P>
"There is a difference," she retorted, "between a chaperon and a
jailer."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin sighed.  He shook his head slowly. He seemed pained.
<P>
"I am not sure that you repay my care as it deserves, Esther," he
declared.  "There is something in your deportment which disappoints
me.  Never mind, your brother has made some atonement.  I entrusted
him with a little mission in which I am glad to say that he has
been brilliantly successful."
<P>
"I cannot say that I am glad to hear it," Esther replied quietly.
<P>
Mr. Fentolin sat back in his chair.  His long fingers played
nervously together, he looked at her gravely.
<P>
"My dear child," he exclaimed, in a tone of pained surprise, "your
attitude distresses me!"
<P>
"I cannot help it.  I have told you what I think about Gerald and
the life he is compelled to live here.  I don't mind so much for
myself, but for him I think it is abominable."
<P>
"The same as ever," Mr. Fentolin sighed.  "I fear that this little
change has done you no good, dear niece.
<P>
"Change!" she echoed.  "It was only a change of prisons."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin shook his head slowly - a distressful gesture.  Yet
all the time he had somehow the air of a man secretly gratified.
<P>
"You are beginning to depress me," he announced.  "I think that
you can go away.  No, stop for just one moment.  Stand there in
the light.  Dear me, how unfortunate!  Who would have thought that
so beautiful a mother could have so plain a daughter!"
<P>
She stood quite still before him, her hands crossed in front of
her, something of the look of the nun from whom the power of
suffering has gone in her still, cold face and steadfast eyes.
<P>
"Not a touch of colour," he continued meditatively, "a figure
straight as my walking-stick.  What a pity!  And all the taste,
nowadays, they tell me, is in the other direction.  The lank
damsels have gone completely out.  We buried them with Oscar Wilde.
Run along, my dear child.  You do not amuse me.  You can take Gerald
with you, if you will.  I have nothing to say to Gerald just now.
He is in my good books.  Is there anything I can do for you, Gerald?
Your allowance, for instance - a trifling increase or an advance?
I am in a generous humour."
<P>
"Then grant me what I begged for the other day," the boy answered
quickly.  "Let me go to Sandhurst.  I could enter my name next week
for the examinations, and I could pass to-morrow."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin tapped the table thoughtfully with his forefinger.
<P>
"A little ungrateful, my dear boy," he declared, "a little ungrateful
that, I think.  Your confidence in yourself pleases me, though.  You
think you could pass your examinations?"
<P>
"I did a set of papers last week," the boy replied.  "On the given
percentages I came out twelfth or better.  Mr.  Brown assured me
that I could go in for them at any moment.  He promised to write
you about it before he left."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin nodded gently.
<P>
"Now I come to think of it, I did have a letter from Mr.  Brown,"
he remarked.  "Rather an impertinence for a tutor, I thought it.
He devoted three pages towards impressing upon me the necessity of
your adopting some sort of a career."
<P>
"He wrote because he thought it was his duty," the boy said doggedly.
<P>
"So you want to be a soldier," Mr. Fentolln continued musingly.
"Well, well, why not?  Our picture galleries are full of them.
There has been a Fentolin in every great battle for the last five
hundred years.  Sailors, too - plenty of them - and just a few
diplomatists.  Brave fellows!  Not one, I fancy," he added, "like
me - not one condemned to pass their days in a perambulator.  You
are a fine fellow, Gerald - a regular Fentolin.  Getting on for
six feet, aren't you?
<P>
" Six feet two, sir."
<P>
"A very fine fellow," Mr. Fentolin repeated.  "I am not so sure
about the army, Gerald.  You see, there are some people who say,
like your American friend, that we are even now almost on the brink
of war."
<P>
"All the more reason for me to hurry," the boy begged.
<P>
Mr. Fentolin closed his eyes.
<P>
"Don't!" he insisted.  "Have you ever stopped to think what war
means - the war you speak of so lightly?  The suffering, the misery
of it!  All the pageantry and music and heroism in front; and behind,
a blackened world, a trail of writhing corpses, a world of weeping
women for whom the sun shall never rise again.  Ugh!  An ugly thing
war, Gerald.  I am not sure that you are not better at home here.
Why not practise golf a little more assiduously?  I see from the
local paper that you are still playing at two handicap.  Now with
your physique, I should have thought you would have been a scratch
player long before now."
<P>
"I play cricket, sir," the boy reminded him, a little impatiently,
"and, after all, there are other things in the world besides games."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin's long finger shot suddenly out.  He was leaning a
little from his chair.  His expression of gentle immobility had
passed away.  His face was stern, almost stony.
<P>
"You have spoken the truth, Gerald," he said.  "There are other
things in the world besides games.  There is the real, the tragical
side of life, the duties one takes up, the obligations of honour.
You have not forgotten, young man, the burden you carry?"
<P>
The boy was paler, but he had drawn himself to his full height.
<P>
"I have not forgotten, sir," he answered bitterly.  "Do I show any
signs of forgetting?  Haven't I done your bidding year by year?
Aren't I here now to do it?"
<P>
"Then do it !" Mr. Fentolin retorted sharply.  "When I am ready for
you to leave here, you shall leave.  Until then, you are mine.
Remember that.  Ah! this is Doctor Sarson who comes, I believe.
That must mean that it is five o'clock.  Come in, Doctor.  I am not
engaged.  You see, I am alone with my dear niece and nephew.  We
have been having a little pleasant conversation."
<P>
Doctor Sarson bowed to Esther, who scarcely glanced at him.  He
remained in the background, quietly waiting.
<P>
"A very delightful little conversation," Mr. Fentolin concluded.
"I have been congratulating my nephew, Doctor, upon his wisdom in
preferring the quiet country life down here to the wearisome routine
of a profession.  He escapes the embarrassing choice of a career by
preferring to devote his life to my comfort.  I shall not forget it.
I shall not be ungrateful.  I may have my faults, but I am not
ungrateful Run away now, both of you.  Dear children you are, but
one wearies, you know, of everything.  I am going out.  You see,
the twilight is coming.  The tide is changing.  I am going down to
meet the sea."
<P>
His little carriage moved towards the door.  The brother and sister
passed out.  Esther led Gerald into the great dining-room, and from
there, through the open windows, out on to the terrace.  She gripped
his shoulder and pointed down to the Tower.
<P>
"Something," she whispered in his ear, "is going to happen there."
