<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>"Why have I been brought here, your worships?" I asked, with
a great deal of firmness.</p>

<p>There were two figures in black, the one beside, the other behind
a large black table. I was placed in front of them, between two
soldiers, in the centre of a large, gaunt room, with bare, dirty
walls, and the arms of Spain above the judge's seat.</p>

<p>"You are before the <em>Juez de la Primiera Instancia</em>,"
said the man in black beside the table. He wore a large and shadowy
tricorn. "Be silent, and respect the procedure."</p>

<p>It was, without doubt, excellent advice. He whispered some words
in the ear of the Judge of the First Instance. It was plain enough
to me that the judge was a quite inferior official, who merely
decided whether there were any case against the accused; he had,
even to his clerk, an air of timidity, of doubt.</p>

<p>I said, "But I insist on knowing...."</p>

<p>The clerk said, "In good time...." And then, in the same tone
of disinterested official routine, he spoke to the <em>Lugareño</em>,
who, from beside the door, rolled very frightened eyes from the
judges and the clerk to myself and the soldiers&mdash;"Advance."</p>

<p>The judge, in a hurried, perfunctory voice, put questions to
the <em>Lugareño</em>; the clerk scratched with a large quill
on a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"The town of Rio Medio, Excellency."</p>

<p>"Of what occupation?"</p>

<p>"Excellency&mdash;a few goats...."</p>

<p>"Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"My daughter, Excellency, married Pepe of the posada in the Calle...."</p>

<p>The judge said, "Yes, yes," with an unsanguine impatience. The
<em>Lugareño's</em> dirty hands jumped nervously on the large
rim of his limp hat.</p>

<p>"You lodge a complaint against the senor there."</p>

<p>The clerk pointed the end of his quill towards me.</p>

<p>"I? God forbid, Excellency," the <em>Lugareño</em> bleated. "The
<em>Alguazil</em> of the Criminal Court instructed me to be watchful.</p>

<p>"You lodge an information, then?" the <em>juez</em> said.</p>

<p>"Maybe it is an information, Excellency," the <em>Lugareño</em>
answered, "as regards the senor there."</p>

<p>The <em>Alguazil</em> of the Criminal Court had told him, and
many other men of Rio Medio, to be on the watch for me, "undoubtedly
touching what had happened, as all the world knew, in Rio Medio."</p>

<p>He looked me full in the face with stupid insolence, and said:</p>

<p>"At first I much doubted, for all the world said this man was
dead&mdash;though others said worse things. Perhaps, who knows?"</p>

<p>He had seen me, he said, many times in Rio Medio, outside the
Casa; on the balcony of the Casa, too. And he was sure that I
was a heretic and an evil person.</p>

<p>It suddenly struck me that this man &mdash;I was undoubtedly
familiar with his face&mdash;must be the lieutenant of Manuel-del-Popolo,
his boon companion. Without doubt, he had seen me on the balcony
of the Casa.</p>

<p>He had gained a lot of assurance from the conciliatory manner
of the <em>Juez</em>, and said suddenly, in a tentative way:</p>

<p>"An evil person; a heretic? Who knows? Perhaps it was he who
incited some people there to murder his señoria, the illustrious
Don."</p>

<p>I said almost contemptuously, "Surely the charge against me is
most absurd? Everyone knows who I am."</p>

<p>The old judge made a gentle, tired motion with his hand.</p>

<p>"Señor," he said, "there is no charge against you&mdash;except that
no one knows who you are. You were in a place where very lamentable
and inexplicable things happened; you are now in Havana: you have
no passport. I beg of you to remain calm. These things are all
in order."</p>

<p>I hadn't any doubt that, as far as he knew, he was speaking the
truth. He was a man, very evidently, of a weary and naïve simplicity.
Perhaps it was really true&mdash;that I should only have to explain;
perhaps it was all over.</p>

<p>O'Brien came into the room with the casual step of an official
from an office entering another's room.</p>

<p>It was as if seeing me were a thing that he very much disliked&mdash;that
he came because he wanted to satisfy himself of my existence,
of my identity, and my being alone. The slow stare that he gave
me did not mitigate the leisureliness of his entry. He walked
behind the table; the judge rose with immense deference; with
his eternal smile, and no word spoken, he motioned the judge to
resume the examination; he stood looking at the clerk's notes
meditatively, the smile still round lips that had a nervous tremble,
and eyes that had dark marks beneath them. He seemed as if he
were still smiling just after having been violently shaken.</p>

<p>The judge went on examining the <em>Lugareño</em>.</p>

<p>"Do you know whence the señor came?"</p>

<p>"Excellency, Excellency...." The man stuttered, his eyes on O'Brien's
face.</p>

<p>"Nor how long he was in the town of Rio Medio?" the judge went
on.</p>

<p>O'Brien suddenly drooped towards his ear. "All those things are
known, senor, my colleague," he said, and began to whisper.</p>

<p>The old judge showed signs of very naïve astonishment and joy.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" he exclaimed. "This man? He is very young to
have committed such crimes."</p>

<p>The clerk hurriedly left the room. He returned with many papers.
O'Brien, leaning over the judge's shoulder, emphasized words with
one finger. What new villainies could O'Brien be meditating? It
wasn't possibly the <em>Lugareño's</em> suggestion that I had
lured men to murder Don Balthasar? Was it merely that I had infringed
some law in carrying off Seraphina?</p>

<p>The old judge said, "How lucky, Don Patricio! We may now satisfy
the English admiral. What good fortune!"</p>

<p>He suddenly sat straight in his chair; O'Brien behind him scrutinized
my face&mdash;to see how I should bear what was coming.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" the judge asked peremptorily.</p>

<p>I said, "Juan &mdash;John Kemp. I am of noble English family;
I am well enough known. Ask the Señor O'Brien."</p>

<p>On O'Brien's shaken face the smile hardened.</p>

<p>"I heard that in Rio Medio the senor was called... was called..."
He paused and appealed to the <em>Lugareño</em>.</p>

<p>"What was he called&mdash;the <em>capataz</em> the man who led the
picaroons?"</p>

<p>The <em>Lugareño</em> stammered, "Nikola... Nikola el Escoces,
Señor Don Patricio."</p>

<p>"You hear?" O'Brien asked the judge. "This villager identifies
the man."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly&mdash;undoubtedly," the <em>Juez</em> said. "We need
no more evidence.... You, Señor, have seen this villain in Rio
Medio, this villager identifies him by name."</p>

<p>I said, "This is absurd. A hundred witnesses can say that I am
John Kemp...."</p>

<p>"That may be true," the <em>Juez</em> said dryly, and then to
his clerk:</p>

<p>"Write here, 'John Kemp, of noble British family, called, on
the scene of his crimes, Nikola el Escoces, otherwise El Demonio.'"</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. I did not, at the moment, realize to
what this all tended.</p>

<p>The judge said to the clerk, "Read the Act of Accusation. Read
here...."  He was pointing to a paragraph of the papers the clerk
had brought in. They were the Act of Accusation, prepared long
before, against the man Nichols.</p>

<p>This particular villainy suddenly became grotesquely and portentously
plain. The clerk read an appalling catalogue of sordid crimes,
working into each other like kneaded dough&mdash;the testimony of witnesses
who had signed the record. Nikola had looted fourteen ships, and
had apparently murdered twenty-two people with his own hand&mdash;two
of them women&mdash;and there was the affair of Rowley's boats. "The
pinnace," the clerk read, "of the British came within ten yards.
The said Nikola then exclaimed, 'Curse the bloodthirsty hounds,'
and fired the grapeshot into the boat. Seven were killed by that
discharge. This I saw with my own eyes.... Signed, Isidoro Alemanno."
And another swore, "The said Nikola was below, but he came running
up, and with one blow of his knife severed the throat of the man
who was kneeling on the deck...."</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Nikola had committed these crimes; that
the witnesses had sworn to them and signed the deposition....
The old judge had evidently never seen him, and now O'Brien and
the <em>Lugareño</em> had sworn that I was Nikola el Escoces,
alias El Demonio.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to shout with rage; but I checked it because
I knew I should be silenced. I said:</p>

<p>"I am not Nikola el Escoces. That I can easily prove."</p>

<p>The Judge of the First Instance shrugged his shoulders and looked,
with implicit trust, up into O'Brien's face.</p>

<p>"That man," I pointed at the <em>Lugareño</em>, "is a pirate.
And, what is more, he is in the pay of the Señor Juez O'Brien.
He was the lieutenant of a man called Manuel-del-Popolo, who commanded
the <em>Lugareños</em> after Nikola left Rio Medio."</p>

<p>"You know very much about the pirates," the <em>Juez</em> said,
with the sardonic air of a very stupid man. "Without doubt you
were intimate with them. I sign now your order for committal to
the <em>carcel</em> of the Marine Court."</p>

<p>I said, "But I tell you I am not Nikola...."</p>

<p>The <em>Juez</em> said impassively, "You pass out of my hands
into those of the Marine Court. I am satisfied that you are a
person deserving of a trial. That is the limit of my responsibility."</p>

<p>I shouted then, "But I tell you this O'Brien is my personal enemy."</p>

<p>The old man smiled acidly.</p>

<p>"The señor need fear nothing of our courts. He will be handed
over to his own countrymen. Without doubt of them he will obtain
justice." He signed to the <em>Lugareño</em> to go, and rose,
gathering up his papers; he bowed to O'Brien. "I leave the criminal
at the disposal of your worship," he said, and went out with his
clerk.</p>

<p>O'Brien sent out the two soldiers after him, and stood there
alone. He had never been so near his death. But for sheer curiosity,
for my sheer desire to know what he <em>could</em> say, I would
have smashed in his brains with the clerk's stool. I was going
to do it; I made one step towards the stool. Then I saw that he
was crying.</p>

<p>"The curse&mdash;the curse of Cromwell on you," he sobbed suddenly.
"You send me back to hell again." He writhed his whole body. "Sorrow!"
he said, "I know it. But what's this? What's <em>this?</em>"</p>

<p>The many reasons he had for sorrow flashed on me like a procession
of sombre images.</p>

<p>"Dead and done with a man can bear," he muttered. "But this &mdash;Not
to know&mdash;perhaps alive&mdash;perhaps hidden &mdash;She may be dead...."
With a change like a flash he was commanding me.</p>

<p>"Tell me how you escaped."</p>

<p>I had a vague inspiration of the truth.</p>

<p>"You aren't fit for a decent man's speaking to," I said.</p>

<p>"You let her drown."</p>

<p>It gave me suddenly the measure of his ignorance; he did not
know anything&mdash;nothing. His hell was uncertainty. Well, let him
stay there.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" he said. "Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Where she's no need to fear you," I answered.</p>

<p>He had a sudden convulsive gesture, as if searching for a weapon.</p>

<p>"If you'll tell me she's alive..." he began.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not dead," I answered.</p>

<p>"Never a drowned puppy was more," he said, with a flash of vivacity.
"You hang here&mdash;for murder&mdash;or in England for piracy."</p>

<p>"Then I've little to want to live for," I sneered at him.</p>

<p>"You let her drown," he said. "You took her from that house,
a young girl, in a little boat. And you can hold up your head."</p>

<p>"I was trying to save her from you," I answered.</p>

<p>"By God," he said. "These English &mdash;I've seen them, spit
the child on the mother's breast. I've seen them set fire to the
thatch of the widow and childless. But this.... But this.... I
can save you, I tell you."</p>

<p>"You can't make me go through worse than I've borne," I answered.
Sorrow and all he might wish on my head, my life was too precious
to him till I spoke. I wasn't going to speak.</p>

<p>"I'll search every ship in the harbour," he said passionately.</p>

<p>"Do," I said. "Bring your <em>Lugareños</em> to the task."</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I wasn't much afraid. Unless he got definite
evidence he couldn't&mdash;in the face of the consul's protests, and
the presence of the admiral&mdash;touch the <em>Lion</em> again. He
fixed his eyes intently upon me.</p>

<p>"You came in the American brigantine," he said. "It's known you
landed in her boat."</p>

<p>I didn't answer him; it was plain enough that the <em>drogher's</em>
arrival had either not been reported to him, or it had been searched
in vain.</p>

<p>"In her boat," he repeated. "I tell you I know she is not dead;
even you, an Englishman, must have a different face if she were."</p>

<p>"I don't at least ask you for life," I said, "to enjoy with her."</p>

<p>"She's alive," he said. "Alive! As for where, it matters little.
I'll search every inch of the island, every road, every <em>hacienda</em>.
You don't realize my power."</p>

<p>"Then search the bottom of the sea," I shouted.</p>

<p>"Let's look at the matter in the right light."</p>

<p>He had mastered his grief, his incertitude. He was himself again,
and the smile had returned&mdash;as if at the moment he forced his
features to their natural lines.</p>

<p>"Send one of your friars to heaven&mdash;you'll never go there yourself
to meet her."</p>

<p>"If you will tell me she's alive, I'll save you."</p>

<p>I made a mute, obstinate gesture.</p>

<p>"If she's alive, and you don't tell me, I can't but find her.
And I'll make you know the agonies of suspense&mdash;a long way from
here."</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>"If she's dead, and you'll tell me, I'll save you some trouble.
If she's dead and you don't, you'll have your own remorse and
the rest, too."</p>

<p>I said, "You're too Irish mysterious for me to understand. But
you've a choice of four evils for me&mdash;choose yourself."</p>

<p>He continued with a quivering, taut good-humour: "Prove to me
she's dead, and I'll let you die sharply and mercifully."</p>

<p>"You won't believe!" I said; but he took no notice.</p>

<p>"I tell you plainly," he smiled. "If we find... if we find her
dear body&mdash;and I can't help; but I've men on the watch all along
the shores &mdash;I'll give you up to your admiral for a pirate.
You'll have a long slow agony of a trial; I know what English
justice is. And a disgraceful felon's death."</p>

<p>I was thinking that, in any case, a day or so might be gained,
the <em>Lion</em> would be gone; they could not touch her while
the flagship remained outside. I certainly didn't want to be given
up to the admiral; I might explain the mistaken identity. But
there was the charge of treason in Jamaica. I said:</p>

<p>"I only ask to be given up; but you daren't do it for your own
credit. I can show you up."</p>

<p>He said, "Make no mistake! If he gets you, he'll hang you. He's
going home in disgrace. Your whole blundering Government will
work to hang you."</p>

<p>"They know pretty well," I answered, "that there are queer doings
in Havana. I promise you, I'll clear things up. I know too much...."</p>

<p>He said, with a sudden, intense note of passion, "Only tell me
where her grave is, I'll let you go free. You couldn't, you dare
not, dastard that you are, go away from where she died&mdash;without...
without making sure."</p>

<p>"Then search all the new graves in the island," I said, "I'll
tell you nothing.... Nothing!"</p>

<p>He came at me again and again, but I never spoke after that.
He made all the issues clearer and clearer&mdash;his own side involuntarily
and all the griefs I had to expect. As for him, he dared not kill
me&mdash;and he dared not give me up to the admiral. In his suspense,
since, for him, I was the only person in the world who knew Seraphina's
fate, he dared not let me out of his grip. And all the while he
had me he must keep the admiral there, waiting for the surrender
either of myself or of some other poor devil whom he might palm
off as Nikola el Escoces. While the admiral was there the <em>Lion</em>
was pretty safe from molestation, and she would sail pretty soon.</p>

<p>At the same time, except for the momentary sheer joy of tormenting
a man whom I couldn't help regarding as a devil, I had more than
enough to fear. I had suffered too much; I wanted rest, woman's
love, slackening off. And here was another endless coil&mdash;endless.
If it didn't end in a knife in the back, he might keep me for
ages in Havana; or he might get me sent to England, where it would
take months, an endless time, to prove merely that I wasn't Nikola
el Escoces. I should prove it; but, in the meantime, what would
become of Sera-phina? Would she follow me to England? Would she
even know that I had gone there? Or would she think me dead and
die herself? O'Brien knew nothing; his spies might report a hundred
uncertainties. He was standing rigidly still now, as if afraid
to move for fear of breaking down. He said suddenly:</p>

<p>"You came in some ship; you can't deceive me, I shall have them
all searched again."</p>

<p>I said desperately, "Search and be damned&mdash;whatever ships you
like."</p>

<p>"You cold, pitiless, English scoundrel," he shrieked suddenly.
The breaking down of his restraint had let him go right into madness.
"You have murdered her. You cared nothing; you came from nowhere.
A beggarly fool, too stupid to be even an adventurer. A miserable
blunderer, coming in blind; coming out blind; and leaving ruin
and worse than hell. What good have you done yourself? What could
you? What did you see? What did you hope?... Sorrow? Ruin? Death?
I am acquainted with them. It is in the blood; 'tis in the tone;
in the entrails of us, in our mother's milk. Your accursed land
has brought always that on our own dear and sorrowful country....
You waste, you ruin, you spoil. What for?... Tell me what for?
Tell me? Tell me? What did you gain? What will you ever gain?
An unending curse!... But, ah, ye've no souls."</p>

<p>He called very loudly, as if with a passionate relief, his voice
giving life to an unsuspected, misgiving echo:</p>

<p>"Guards! Soldiers!... You shall be shot, now!"</p>

<p>He was going to cut the knot that way. Two soldiers pushed the
door noisily open, their muskets advanced. He took no notice of
them; and they retained an attitude of military stupidity, their
eyes upon him. He whispered:</p>

<p>"No, no! Not yet!"</p>

<p>Then he looked at me searchingly, as if he still hoped to get
some certainty from my face, some inkling, perhaps some inspiration
of what would persuade me to speak. Then he shook his wrists violently,
as if in fear of himself.</p>

<p>"Take him away," he said. "Away! Out of reach of my hands. Out
of reach of my hands."</p>

<p>I was trembling a good deal; when the soldiers entered I thought
I had got to my last minute. But, as it was, he had not learnt
a thing from me. Not a thing. And I did not see where else he
could go for information.</p>
