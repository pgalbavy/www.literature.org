<p>It was no wonder that Turkey Proudfoot was angry. Everybody in the
farmyard was laughing and looking his way--or so it seemed to him.
</p>
<p>Since he couldn't see any joke, he decided to leave his silly neighbors
and go off into the fields where he could be alone. So he walked slowly
away, holding his head high and stepping in his most elegant manner.
</p><p>To his great disgust peals of laughter followed him. And though he had
intended to march off without saying a word, this last outburst so
filled him with rage that he couldn't resist spinning about to glare
and gobble at his tormentors.
</p><p>He turned so quickly that he surprised Master Meadow Mouse with one of
his tiny feet lifted high in the air. He surprised him so much that
Master Meadow Mouse stood stock still and didn't even bring his foot
down, but held it off the ground as if it had frozen stiff and couldn't
be moved.
</p><p>At first there was a most joyful look on Master Meadow Mouse's face. But
it faded instantly into one of doubt and dismay. To tell the truth,
Master Meadow Mouse hadn't expected Turkey Proudfoot to turn around and
catch him right in his mimicking act.
</p><p>"Ah, ha!" cried Turkey Proudfoot. "So it's you that they're laughing at,
eh?"
</p><p>Master Meadow Mouse was so upset that he murmured faintly, "Yes, it's
me."
</p><p>"Well, I don't blame them," said Turkey Proudfoot. "You certainly look
very queer. Why are you holding your foot off the ground like that?"
</p><p>"I was in the midst of taking a step when you turned around and startled
me," Master Meadow Mouse explained. "And I don't know whether to set my
foot down ahead of me, or to put it behind me."
</p><p>"Don't be alarmed!" Turkey Proudfoot said. "I never fight folks of your
size. You're too little for me to pay much attention to. I must say,
however, that you have a very odd way of walking."
</p><p>By this time Master Meadow Mouse had recovered from his surprise and
wasn't afraid in the least. Now he laughed heartily.
</p><p>"I was walking the way you walk," he cried.
</p><p>"Oh, no!" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed. "No, indeed! You certainly
weren't." He didn't ask Master Meadow Mouse's pardon for contradicting.
</p><p>"I'd like to know why I wasn't," Master Meadow Mouse replied somewhat
hotly. "I was strutting right behind you, all the way across the yard.
That's why everybody was giggling."
</p><p>"It's no wonder they were poking fun at you," Turkey Proudfoot told him.
"You amused the neighbors because you thought you were strutting, while
you really weren't."
</p><p>Master Meadow Mouse put his foot down on the ground. He was puzzled.
</p><p>"I don't know why I wasn't strutting," he retorted. "I was raising my
feet just as high as I could lift them."
</p><p>"Ah, yes?" said Turkey Proudfoot. "But you forgot one thing."
</p><p>"What was that?"
</p><p>"You didn't spread your tail," Turkey Proudfoot explained. "And that's
half of strutting."
</p><p>"I--I didn't know it," Master Meadow Mouse stammered. And then he darted
away, to hide in the grass beyond the fence.
</p><p>He felt much ashamed to have made such a mistake.
