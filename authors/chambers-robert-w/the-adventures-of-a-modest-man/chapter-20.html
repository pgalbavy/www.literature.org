<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>My daughter Alida and my daughter Dulcima had gone to drive with
the United States Ambassador and his daughter that morning, leaving
me at the Hôtel with instructions as to my behaviour in their
absence, and injunctions not to let myself be run over by any
cab, omnibus, automobile, or bicycle whatever.</p>

<p>Considerably impressed by their solicitude, I retired to the
smoking-room, believing myself safe there from any form of vehicular
peril. But the young man from Chicago sauntered in and took a
seat close beside me, with benevolent intentions toward relieving
my isolation.</p>

<p>I preferred any species of juggernaut to his rough riding over
the English language, so I left him murkily enveloped in the fumes
of his own cigar and sauntered out into the street.</p>

<p>The sky was cloudless; the air was purest balm. Through fresh
clean streets I wandered under the cool shadows of flowering chestnuts,
and presently found myself on the quay near the Pont des Arts,
leaning over and looking at the river slipping past between its
walls of granite.</p>

<p>In a solemn row below me sat some two dozen fishermen dozing
over their sport. Their long white bamboo poles sagged, their
red and white quill-floats bobbed serenely on the tide. Truly
here was a company of those fabled Lotus-eaters, steeped in slumber;
a dreamy, passionless band of brothers drowsing in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Looking east along the grey stone quays I could see hundreds
and hundreds of others, slumbering over their fishpoles; looking
west, the scenery was similar.</p>

<p>"The fishing must be good here," I observed to an aged man, leaning
on the quay-wall beside me.</p>

<p>"<em>Comme ça</em>," he said.</p>

<p>I leaned there lazily, waiting to see the first fish caught.
I am an angler myself, and understand patience; but when I had
waited an hour by my watch I looked suspiciously at the aged man
beside me. He was asleep, so I touched him.</p>

<p>He roused himself without resentment. "Have you," said I, sarcastically,
"ever seen better fishing than this, in the Seine?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "I once saw a fish caught."</p>

<p>"And when was that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That," said the aged man, "was in 1853."</p>

<p>I strolled down to the lower quay, smoking. As I passed the row
of anglers I looked at them closely. They all were asleep.</p>

<p>Just above was anchored one of those floating <em>lavoirs</em>
in which the washerwomen of Paris congregate to beat your linen
into rags with flat wooden paddles, and soap the rags snow-white
at the cost of a few pennies.</p>

<p>The soapsuds from the washing floated off among the lines of
the slumbering fishermen. Perhaps that was one reason why the
fish were absent from the scenery. On the other hand, however,
I was given to understand that a large sewer emptied into the
river near the Pont des Arts, and that the fishing was best in
such choice spots. Still something certainly was wrong somewhere,
for either the sewer and the soapsuds had killed the fish, or
they had all migrated up the sewer on an inland and subterranean
picnic to meet the elite among the rats of Paris, and spend the
balance of the day.</p>

<p>The river was alive with little white saucy steamboats, rushing
up and down the Seine with the speed of torpedo craft. There was
a boat-landing within a few paces of where I stood, so, when a
boat came along and stopped to discharge a few passengers, I stepped
aboard, bound for almost anywhere, and not over-anxious to get
there too quickly. Neither did I care to learn my own destination,
and when the ticket agent in naval uniform came along to inquire
where I might be going, I told him to sell me a pink ticket because
it looked pretty. As all Frenchmen believe that all Americans
are a little mad, my request, far from surprising the ticket agent,
simply confirmed his national theory; and he gave me my ticket
very kindly, with an air of protection such as one involuntarily
assumes toward children and invalids.</p>

<p>"You are going to Saint Cloud," he said. "I'll tell you when
to get off the boat."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said I.</p>

<p>"You ought to be going the other way," he added.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because Charenton lies the other way," he replied, politely,
and passed on to sell his tickets.</p>

<p>Now I had forgotten much concerning Paris in my twenty years
of absence.</p>

<p>There was a pretty girl sitting on the bench beside me, with
elbows resting on the railing behind. I glanced at her. She was
smiling.</p>

<p>"Pardon, madame," said I, knowing enough to flatter her, though
she had "mademoiselle" written all over her complexion of peaches
and cream&mdash;"pardon, madame, but may I, a stranger, venture to
address you for a word of information?"</p>

<p>"You may, monsieur," she said, with a smile which showed an edge
of white teeth under her scarlet lips.</p>

<p>"Then, if you please, where is Charenton?"</p>

<p>"Up the river," she replied, smiling still.</p>

<p>"And what," said I, "is the principal feature of the town of
Charenton?"</p>

<p>"The Lunatic Asylum, monsieur."</p>

<p>I thanked her and looked the other way.</p>

<p>Our boat was now flying past the Louvre. Above in the streets
I could see cabs and carriages passing, and the heads and shoulders
of people walking on the endless stone terraces. Below, along
the river bank, our boat passed between an almost unbroken double
line of dozing fishermen.</p>

<p>Now we shot out from the ranks of <em>lavoirs</em> and bathhouses,
and darted on past the Champ de Mars; past the ugly sprawling
Eiffel Tower, past the twin towers of the Trocadero, and out under
the huge stone viaduct of the Point du Jour.</p>

<p>Here the banks of the river were green and inviting. Cafés, pretty
suburban dance-houses, restaurants, and tiny hotels lined the
shores. I read on the signs such names as "The Angler's Retreat,"
"At the Great Gudgeon," "The Fisherman's Paradise," and I saw
sign-boards advertising fishing, and boats to let.</p>

<p>"I should think," said I, turning to my pretty neighbor, "that
it would pay to remove these fisherman's signs to Charenton."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Because," said I, "nobody except a Charentonian would ever believe
that any fish inhabit this river."</p>

<p>"Saint Cloud! Saint Cloud!" called out the ticket-agent as the
boat swung in to a little wooden floating pier on the left bank
of the river.</p>

<p>The ticket-agent carefully assisted me over the bridge to the
landing-dock, and I whispered to him that I was the Duke of Flatbush
and would be glad to receive him any day in Prospect Park.</p>

<p>Then, made merry at my own wit, I strolled off up the steps that
led to the bank above.</p>

<p>There, perched high above the river, I found a most delightful
little rustic restaurant where I at once ordered luncheon served
for me on the terrace, in the open air.</p>

<p>The bald waiter sped softly away to deliver my order, and I sipped
an Amer-Picon, and bared my head to the warm breeze which swept
up the river from distant meadows deep in clover.</p>

<p>There appeared to be few people on the terrace. One young girl,
however, whom I had seen on the boat, I noticed particularly because
she seemed to be noticing me. Then, fearing that my stare might
be misunderstood, I turned away and soon forgot her when the bald
waiter returned with an omelet, bread and butter, radishes and
a flask of white wine.</p>

<p>Such an omelet! such wine! such butter! and the breeze from the
west blowing sweet as perfume from a nectarine, and the green
trees waving and whispering, and the blessed yellow sunshine over
all&#11834;</p>

<p>"Pardon, monsieur."</p>

<p>I turned. It was my pretty little Parisienne of the steamboat,
seated at the next small table, demurely chipping an egg.</p>

<p>"I beg <em>your</em> pardon," said I, hastily, for the leg of
my chair was pinning her gown to the ground.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," she said brightly, with a mischievous glance
under her eyes.</p>

<p>"My child," said I, "it was very stupid of me, and I am certainly
old enough to know better."</p>

<p>"Doubtless, monsieur; and yet you do not appear to be very, very
old."</p>

<p>"I am very aged," said <em>I&mdash;"</em>almost forty-five." And I
smiled a retrospective smile, watching the bubbles breaking in
my wine-glass.</p>

<p>Memory began to work, deftly, among the debris of past years.
I saw myself a student of eighteen, gayly promenading Paris with
my tutor, living a monotonous colourless life in a city of which
I knew nothing and saw nothing save through the windows of my
English pension or in the featureless streets of the American
quarter, under escort of my tutor and my asthmatic aunt, Miss
Janet Van Twiller.</p>

<p>That year spent in Paris, to "acquire the language" in a house
where nothing but English was spoken, had still a vague, tender
charm for me, because in that year I was young. I grew older when
I shook the tutor, side-stepped my aunt, and moved across the
river.</p>

<p>Once, only once, had the placid serenity of that year been broken.
It was one day&mdash;a day like this in spring&mdash;when, for some reason,
even now utterly unknown to me, I deliberately walked out of the
house alone in defiance of my tutor and my aunt, and wandered
all day long through unknown squares and parks and streets intoxicated
with my own freedom. And I remember, that day&mdash;which was the twin
of this&mdash;sitting on the terrace of a tiny café in the Latin Quarter,
I drifted into idle conversation with a demure little maid who
was sipping a red syrup out of a tall thin glass.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven years ago! And here I was again, in the scented
spring sunshine, with the same west wind whispering of youth and
freedom, and my heart not a day older.</p>

<p>"My child," said I to the little maid, "twenty-seven years ago
you drank pink strawberry syrup in a tall iced glass."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, monsieur," she faltered.</p>

<p>"You cannot, mademoiselle. I am drinking to the memory of my
dead youth."</p>

<p>And I touched my lips to the glass.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said, under her breath, "what I am to do with
the rest of the day?"</p>

<p>"I could have told you," said <em>I&mdash;"</em>twenty-seven years
ago."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you could tell me better now?" she said, innocently.</p>

<p>I looked out into the east where the gold dome of the Tomb rose
glimmering through a pale-blue haze. "Under that dome lies an
Emperor in his crypt of porphyry," said I. "Deeper than his dust,
bedded in its stiff shroud of gold, lies my dead youth, sleeping
forever in the heart of this fair young world of spring."</p>

<p>I touched my glass idly, then lifted it.</p>

<p>"Yet," said I, "the pale sunshine of winter lies not unkindly
on snow and ice, sometimes. I drink to your youth and beauty,
my child."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" she asked, wonder-eyed.</p>

<p>I thought a moment: "No, not all. Williams isn't the only autocratic
interpreter of Fate, Chance, and Destiny."</p>

<p>"Williams!" she repeated, perplexed.</p>

<p>"You don't know him. He writes stories for a living. But he'll
never write the story I might very easily tell you in the sunshine
here."</p>

<p>After a pause she said: "Are you going to?"</p>

<p>"I think I will," I said. And my eyes fixed smiling upon the
sunny horizon, I began:</p>

<p>Now, part of this story is to be vague as a mirrored face at
dusk; and part is to be as precise as the reflection of green
trees in the glass of the stream; and all is to be as capricious
as the flight of that wonderful butterfly of the South which is
called Ajax by the reverent, and The White Devil by the profane.
Incidentally, it is the story of Jones and the Dryad.</p>

<p>The profession of Jones was derided by the world at large. He
collected butterflies; and it may be imagined what the American
public thought of him when they did not think he was demented.
But a large, over-nourished and blasé millionaire, wearied of
collecting pigeon-blood rubies, first editions and Rembrandts,
through sheer <em>ennui</em> one day commissioned Jones to gather
for him the most magnificent and complete collection of American
butterflies that could possibly be secured&mdash;not only single perfect
specimens of the two sexes in each species, but series on series
of every kind, showing local varieties, seasonal variations in
size and colour, strange examples of albinism and polymorphic
phenomena&mdash;in fact, this large, benevolent and intellectual capitalist
wanted something which nobody else had, so he selected Jones and
damned the expense. Nobody else had Jones: that pleased him; Jones
was to secure specimens that nobody else had: and that would be
doubly gratifying. Therefore he provided Jones with a five-year
contract, an agreeable salary, turned him loose on a suspicious
nation, and went back to hunt up safe investments for an income
the size of which had begun to annoy him.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>"This part of the story is clear enough, is it not, my child?"</p>

<p>"Are <em>you</em> Jones?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask questions," I said, seriously.</p>

<p>"The few delirious capers cut by Jones subsequent to the signing
of the contract consisted of a debauch at the Astor Library, a
mad evening with seven aged gentlemen at the Entomological Society,
and the purchase of a ticket to Florida. This last spasm was his
undoing; he went for butterflies, and the first thing he did was
to trip over the maliciously extended foot of Fate and fall plump
into the open arms of Destiny. And in a week he was playing golf.
This part is sufficiently vague, I hope. Is it?"</p>

<p>She said it was; so I continued:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>The Dryad, with her sleeves rolled up above her pretty elbows,
was preparing to assault a golf ball; Jones regarded the proceedings
with that inscrutable expression which, no doubt, is bestowed
upon certain creatures as a weapon for self-protection.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me while I'm driving," said the Dryad.</p>

<p>"No," said Jones.</p>

<p>"Don't even say 'no'!" insisted the Dryad.</p>

<p>A sharp thwack shattered the silence; the golf ball sailed away
toward the fifth green, landing in a gully. "Oh, bother!" exclaimed
the Dryad, petulantly, as the small black caddie pattered forward,
irons rattling in his quiver. "Now, Mr. Jones, it is up to you"&mdash;doubtless
a classically mythological form of admonition common to Dryads
but now obsolete.</p>

<p>The Dryad, receiving no reply, looked around and beheld Jones,
net poised, advancing on tiptoe across the green.</p>

<p>"What is it&mdash;a snake?" inquired the Dryad in an unsteady voice.</p>

<p>"It is The White Devil!" whispered Jones.</p>

<p>The Dryad's skirts were short enough as it was, but she hastily
picked them up. She had a right to. "Does it bite?" she whispered,
looking carefully around in the grass. But all she could see was
a strangely beautiful butterfly settled on a blue wild blossom
which swayed gently in the wind on the edge of the jungle. So
she dropped her skirts. She had a right to.</p>

<p>Now, within a few moments of the hour when Jones had first laid
eyes on her, and she on Jones, he had confided to her his family
history, his ambitions, his ethical convictions, and his theories
concerning the four known forms of the exquisite Ajax butterfly
of Florida. She had been young enough to listen without yawning&mdash;which
places her age somewhere close to eighteen. Besides, she had remembered
almost everything that Jones had said, which confirms a diagnosis
of her disease. There could be no doubt about it; the Dryad was
afflicted with extreme Youth, for she now recognized the butterfly
from the eulogy of Jones, and her innocent heart began a steady
tattoo upon her ribs as Jones, on tiptoe, crept nearer and nearer,
net outstretched.</p>

<p>The moment was solemn; breathless, hatless, bare-armed, the Dryad
advanced, skirts spread as though to shoo chickens.</p>

<p>"Don't," whispered Jones.</p>

<p>But the damage had been accomplished; Ajax jerked his pearl and
ashen banded wings, shot with the fiery crimson bar, flashed into
the air, and was gone like the last glimmer of a fading sun-spot.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" cried the Dryad, clasping her highly ornamental
hands; "what on earth will you think of my stupidity?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Jones, resolutely, swallowing hard and gazing
at the tangled jungle.</p>

<p>"It was too stupid," insisted the Dryad; and, as the silence
of Jones assented, she added, "but it is not very nice of you
to say so."</p>

<p>"Why, I didn't," cried Jones.</p>

<p>"You did," said the Dryad, tears of vexation in her blue eyes.
"And to pay for your discourtesy you shall make me a silk net
and I shall give up golf and spend my entire time in hunting for
White Devils, to make amends."</p>

<p>The suggested penance appeared to attract Jones.</p>

<p>"Give up golf&mdash;which I am perfectly mad about," repeated the
Dryad, "just because you were horrid when I tried to help you."</p>

<p>"That will be delightful," said Jones, naïvely. "We will hunt
Ajax together&mdash;all day, every day&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall catch&mdash;something&mdash;the first time I try," observed
the Dryad, airily. She teed up a practice ball, hit it a vicious
whack, followed its flight with narrowing blue eyes, and, turning
placidly upon Jones, smiled a dangerous smile.</p>

<p>"If I don't catch an Ajax before you do I'll forfeit anything
you please," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll take it," said Jones.</p>

<p>"But," cried the Dryad, "what do you offer against it?"</p>

<p>"Whatever I ask from you," he said, deliberately.</p>

<p>"You are somewhat vague, Mr. Jones."</p>

<p>"I won't be when I win."</p>

<p>"Tell me what you want&mdash;if you win!"</p>

<p>"What? With this caddie hanging around and listening?" The Dryad,
wide-eyed and flushed, regarded him in amazement.</p>

<p>Jones picked up a pinch of wet sand from the box, moulded it
with great care into a tiny truncated cone, set it on the tee,
set his ball on top of it, whipped the air persuasively with his
driver once or twice, and, settling himself into the attitude
popularly attributed to the Colossus of Rhodes, hit the ball for
the longest, cleanest drive he had ever perpetrated.</p>

<p>"Dryad," he said, politely, "it is now up to you."</p>

</div>
<p>Of all the exquisite creatures that float through the winter
sunshine of the semi-tropics this is the most exquisite and spirituelle.
Long, slender, swallow-tailed wings, tinted with pearl and primrose,
crossed with ashy stripes and double-barred with glowing crimson&mdash;this
is the shy, forest-haunting creature that the Dryad sought to
snare, and sought in vain.</p>

<p>Sometimes, standing on the long, white shell roads, where myriads
of glittering dragon-flies sailed, far away a pale flash would
catch the sun for an instant; and "Ready! Look out!" would cry
the Dryad. Vanity! Swifter than a swallow the Ajax passed, a pearly
blurr against the glare of the white road; swish! swish! the silken
nets swung in vain.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother," sighed the Dryad.</p>

<p>Again, in the dim corridors of the forest, where tall palms clustered
and green live oaks spread transparent shadows across palmetto
thickets, far in some sunlit glade a tiny wing-flash would bring
the Dryad's forest cry: "Quick! Oh, quick!" But the woodland ghost
was gone.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother, bother!" sighed the Dryad. "There are flowers&mdash;the
sparkleberry is in blossom&mdash;there is bloom on the China tree,
but this phantom never stops! Can nothing stop it?"</p>

<p>Day after day, guarding the long, white road, the Dryad saw the
phantom pass&mdash;always flying north; day after day in the dim forest,
the hurrying, pale-winged, tireless creatures fled away, darting
always along some fixed yet invisible aërial path. Nothing lured
them, neither the perfumed clusters of the China-berry, nor the
white forest flowers; nothing checked them, neither the woven
curtain of creepers across the forest barrier, nor the jungle
walled with palms.</p>

<p>To the net of the Dryad and of Jones had fallen half a thousand
jewelled victims; the exquisite bronzed Berenice, the velvet and
yellow Palamedes, the great orange-winged creatures brilliant
as lighted lanterns. But in the gemmed symmetry of the casket
the opalescent heart was missing; and the Dryad, uncomforted,
haunted the woodlands, roaming in defiance of the turquoise-tinted
lizards and the possible serpent whose mouth is lined with snow-white
membranes&mdash;prowling in contempt of that coiled horror that lies
waiting, S shaped, a mass of matted grey and velvet diamond pattern
from which two lidless eyes glitter unwinking.</p>

<p>"How on earth did anybody ever catch an Ajax?" inquired the Dryad
at the close of one fruitless, bootless day's pursuit.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Jones, "that every year or so the Ajax alights."
That was irony.</p>

<p>"On what?" insisted the Dryad.</p>

<p>"Oh, on&mdash;something," said Jones, vaguely. "Butterflies are, no
doubt, like the human species; flowers tempt some butterflies,
mud-puddles attract others. One or the other will attract our
Ajax some day."</p>

<p>That night Jones, with book open upon his knees, sat in the lamplight
of the great veranda and read tales of Ajax to the Dryad; how
that, in the tropics, Ajax assumes four forms, masquerading as
Floridensis in winter and as Telamonides in summer, and how he
wears the exquisite livery of Marcellus, too, and even assumes,
according to a gentleman named Walsh, a fourth form. Beautiful
pictures of Ajax illumined the page where were also engraved the
signs of Mars and of Venus. The Dryad looked at these; Jones looked
at her; the rest of the hotel looked at them. Jones read on.</p>

<p>Sleepy-eyed the Dryad listened; outside in the burnished moonlight
the whippoorwill's spirit call challenged the star-set silence;
and far away in the blue night she heard the deep breathing of
the sea. Presently the Dryad slept in her rocking-chair, curved
wrist propping her head; Jones was chagrined. He need not have
been, for the Dryad was dreaming of him.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>There came a day late in April when, knee deep in palmetto scrub,
the Dryad and Jones stood leaning upon their nets and scanning
the wilderness for the swift-winged forest phantom they had sought
so long. Ajax was on the wing; glimpse after glimpse they had
of him, a pale shadow in the sun, a misty spot in the shadow,
then nothing but miles of palmetto scrub and the pink stems of
tall pines.</p>

<p>Suddenly an Ajax darted into the sunny glade where they stood,
and a ragged, faded brother Ajax fluttered up from the ground
and, Ajax-like, defied the living lightning.</p>

<p>Wing beating wing they closed in battle, whirling round and round
one another above the palmetto thicket. The ragged and battered
butterfly won, the other darted away with the speed of a panic-stricken
jacksnipe, and his shabby opponent quietly settled down on a sun-warmed
twig.</p>

<p>Then it was that inspiration seized the Dryad: "Mr. Jones, you
trick wild ducks into gunshot range by setting painted wooden
ducks afloat close to the shore where you lie hidden. Catch that
ragged Ajax, place him upon a leaf, and who knows?"</p>

<p>Decoy a butterfly? Decoy the forest phantom drunk with the exhilaration
of his own mad flight! It was the invention of a new sport.</p>

<p>Scarcely appearing to move at all, so cautious was his progress,
Jones slowly drew near the basking and battle-tattered creature
that had once been Ajax. There was a swift drop of the silken
net, a flutter, and all was over. In the palm of Jones's hand,
dead, lay the faded and torn insect with scarce a vestige of former
beauty on the motionless wings.</p>

<p>Doubting, yet stirred to hope, he placed the dead butterfly on
a palmetto frond, wings expanded to catch the sun; and then, standing
within easy net-stroke, the excited Dryad and Jones strained their
eyes to catch the first far glimpse of Ajax in the wilderness.</p>

<p>What was that distant flash of light? A dragon-fly sailing? There
it is again! And there again! Nearer, nearer, following the same
invisible aërial path.</p>

<p>"Quick!" whispered the Dryad. A magnificent Ajax flashed across
the glade, turned an acute angle in mid-air, and in an instant
hung hovering over the lifeless insect on the palm leaf.</p>

<p>Swish-h! A wild fluttering in the net, a soft cry of excitement
from the Dryad, and there, dead, in the palm of the hand of Jones,
lay the first perfect specimen, exquisite, flawless, beautiful
beyond words.</p>

<p>Before the Dryad could place the lovely creature in safety another
Ajax darted into the glade, sheered straight for the decoy, and
the next instant was fluttering, a netted captive.</p>

<p>Then the excitement grew; again and again Ajax appeared in the
vicinity; and the tension only increased as the forest phantom,
unseeing or unheeding the decoy, darted on in a mad ecstasy of
flight.</p>

<p>No hunter, crouched in the reeds, could find keener excitement
watching near his decoys than the Dryad found that April day,
motionless, almost breathless, scanning the forest depths for
the misty-winged phantom of the tropic wilderness. One in six
turned to the decoy; there were long, silent intervals of waiting
and of strained expectancy; there were false alarms as a distant
drifting dragon-fly glimmered in the sun; but one by one the swift-winged
victims dashed at the decoy and were taken in their strength and
pride and all their unsullied beauty. And when the sport of that
April morning was over, and when Denis, the Ethiopian, turned
the horses' heads homeward, Ajax Floridensis, Ajax Marcellus and
Ajax Telamonides were no longer mysteries to the Dryad and to
Jones.</p>

<p>But there was a deeper mystery to solve before returning to the
vast caravansary across the river; and while they hesitated to
attack it, I, mademoiselle, having met and defeated Ajax in fair
and open trial of cunning and of wit, think fit to throw a ray
of modern light upon this archaic tale.</p>

<p>It is true that Ajax, of the family of Papilio, rivals the wind
in flight, and seldom, in spring and summer, deigns to alight.
Yet I have seen Ajax Telamonides alight in the middle of the roadway,
and, netting him, have found him fresh from the chrysalis, and
therefore weak and inexperienced. Ajax Floridensis I have taken
with a net as he feasted on the bunches of white sparkleberry
on the edge of the jungle.</p>

<p>Rarely have I seen Ajax seduced by the wild phlox blossoms, but
I have sometimes caught him sipping there.</p>

<p>As for the decoy, I have used it and taken with it scores and
scores of Ajax butterflies which otherwise I could not have hoped
to capture. This is not all; the great Tiger Swallowtail of the
orange groves can be decoyed by a dead comrade of either sex;
so, too, can the royal, velvet-robed Palamedes butterfly; and
when the imperial Turnus sails high among the magnolias' topmost
branches, a pebble cast into the air near him will sometimes bring
him fluttering down, following the stone as it falls to the ground.
These three butterflies, however, are generally easily decoyed,
and all love flowers. Yet, in experimenting with decoys, I have
never seen an Ajax decoy to any dead butterfly except an Ajax;
and the dead butterfly may be of either sex, and as battered as
you please.</p>

<p>It is supposed by some that butterflies can distinguish colour
and form at no greater distance than five feet; and experiments
in decoying appear to bear out this theory. Butterflies decoy
to their own species, even to faded and imperfect ones.</p>

<p>Of half a dozen specimens set out on leaves and twigs, among
which were Papilio Palamedes, Cresphontes, and Turnus, Ajax decoyed
only to an imperfect and faded Ajax, and finally, when among that
brilliant array of specimens a single upper wing of a dead Ajax
was placed on a broad leaf, Ajax came to it, ignoring the other
perfect specimens.</p>

<p>Yet Ajax will fight in single combat with any live butterfly,
and so will Palamedes, Turnus, and Cresphontes.</p>

<p>If a female Luna moth is placed in a cage of mosquito netting
and hung out of the window at night she is almost certain to attract
all the male Luna moths in the neighbourhood before morning. In
this case, as it is in the case of the other moths of the same
group, it is the odor that attracts.</p>

<p>But in the case of a dead Ajax butterfly it appears to be colour
even more than form; and it can scarcely be odor, because the
Ajax butterflies of both sexes decoy to a dead and dried butterfly
of either sex. With this abstruse observation, mademoiselle, I,
personally, retire into the jungle to peep out at a passing vehicle
driven by an Ethiopian known as Denis, and containing two young
people of sexes diametrically opposed. And I am pleasantly conscious
that I can no longer conceal their identity from you, mademoiselle.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I know who they are. Please continue about them."</p>

<p>So I smiled and continued:</p>

<p>"And after all these weeks, during which I have so faithfully
accompanied you, are you actually going to insist that I lost
my bet?" asked the Dryad in a low voice.</p>

<p>"But you didn't, did you?" said the pitiless Jones.</p>

<p>"I let you catch the first Ajax. I might have prevented you;
I might have even caught it myself!"</p>

<p>"But you didn't, did you?" said the pitiless Jones.</p>

<p>"Because," continued the Dryad, flushing, "I was generous enough
to think only of capturing the butterflies, while all the time
it appears <em>you</em> were thinking of something else. How sordid!"
she added, scornfully.</p>

<p>"You admit I won the bet?" persisted that meanest of men.</p>

<p>"I admit nothing, Mr. Jones."</p>

<p>"Didn't I win the bet?"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Didn't I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Goodness, yes!" cried the Dryad. "Now what are you going to
do about it?"</p>

<p>"You said," observed Jones, "that you would forfeit anything
I desired. Didn't you?"</p>

<p>The Dryad looked at him, then looked away.</p>

<p>"Didn't you?"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Di&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"Then I am to ask what I desire?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"So," continued Jones in a low voice, "I do ask it."</p>

<p>Still no answer.</p>

<p>"Will you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones," she said, turning a face toward him on which was
written utter consternation.</p>

<p>"Will you," continued Jones, "permit me to name the first new
butterfly that I capture, after you?"</p>

<p>Her eyes widened.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is <em>that</em> all you desire?" she faltered. Suddenly
her eyes filled.</p>

<p>"Absolutely all," said Jones simply&mdash;"to name a new species of
butterfly after my wife&#11834;"</p>

<p>However, that was the simplest part of the whole matter; the
trouble was all ahead, waiting for them on the veranda&mdash;two hundred
pounds of wealthy trouble sitting in a rocking-chair, tatting,
and keeping tabs upon the great clock and upon the trolley cars
as they arrived in decorous procession from the golf links.</p>

<p>There was a long, long silence.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is that all?" inquired my little neighbour.</p>

<p>"Can't you guess the rest?"</p>

<p>But she only sighed, looking down at the lace handkerchief which
she had been absently twisting in her lap.</p>

<p>"You know," said I, "what keys unlock the meaning of all stories?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"The keys of The Past," I said.</p>

<p>She sighed, looking down into her smooth little empty hands:</p>

<p>"I threw them away, long ago," she said. "For me there remains
only one more door. And that unlocks of itself."</p>

<p>And we sat there, thinking, through the still summer afternoon.</p>
