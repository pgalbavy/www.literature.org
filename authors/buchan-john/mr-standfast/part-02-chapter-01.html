<p>I returned to France on 13 September, and took over my old brigade
on the 19th of the same month. We were shoved in at the Polygon
Wood on the 26th, and after four days got so badly mauled that
we were brought out to refit. On 7 October, very much to my surprise,
I was given command of a division and was on the fringes of the
Ypres fighting during the first days of November. From that front
we were hurried down to Cambrai in support, but came in only for
the last backwash of that singular battle. We held a bit of the
St Quentin sector till just before Christmas, when we had a spell
of rest in billets, which endured, so far as I was concerned,
till the beginning of January, when I was sent off on the errand
which I shall presently relate.</p>

<p>That is a brief summary of my military record in the latter part
of 1917. I am not going to enlarge on the fighting. Except for
the days of the Polygon Wood it was neither very severe nor very
distinguished, and you will find it in the history books. What
I have to tell of here is my own personal quest, for all the time
I was living with my mind turned two ways. In the morasses of
the Haanebeek flats, in the slimy support lines at Zonnebeke,
in the tortured uplands about Flesquieres, and in many other odd
places I kept worrying at my private conundrum. At night I would
lie awake thinking of it, and many a toss I took into shell-holes
and many a time I stepped off the duckboards, because my eyes
were on a different landscape. Nobody ever chewed a few wretched
clues into such a pulp as I did during those bleak months in Flanders
and Picardy.</p>

<p>For I had an instinct that the thing was desperately grave, graver
even than the battle before me. Russia had gone headlong to the
devil, Italy had taken it between the eyes and was still dizzy,
and our own prospects were none too bright. The Boche was getting
uppish and with some cause, and I foresaw a rocky time ahead till
America could line up with us in the field. It was the chance
for the Wild Birds, and I used to wake in a sweat to think what
devilry Ivery might be engineering. I believe I did my proper
job reasonably well, but I put in my most savage thinking over
the other. I remember how I used to go over every hour of every
day from that June night in the Cotswolds till my last meeting
with Bullivant in London, trying to find a new bearing. I should
probably have got brain-fever, if I hadn’t had to spend most of
my days and nights fighting a stiffish battle with a very watchful
Hun. That kept my mind balanced, and I dare say it gave an edge
to it; for during those months I was lucky enough to hit on a
better scent than Bullivant and Macgillivray and Blenkiron, pulling
a thousand wires in their London offices.</p>

<p>I will set down in order of time the various incidents in this
private quest of mine. The first was my meeting with Geordie Hamilton.
It happened just after I rejoined the brigade, when I went down
to have a look at our Scots Fusilier battalion. The old brigade
had been roughly handled on 31st July, and had had to get heavy
drafts to come anywhere near strength. The Fusiliers especially
were almost a new lot, formed by joining our remnants to the remains
of a battalion in another division and bringing about a dozen
officers from the training unit at home.</p>

<p>I inspected the men and my eyes caught sight of a familiar face.
I asked his name and the colonel got it from the sergeant-major.
It was Lance-Corporal George Hamilton.</p>

<p>Now I wanted a new batman, and I resolved then and there to have
my old antagonist. That afternoon he reported to me at brigade
headquarters. As I looked at that solid bandy-legged figure, standing
as stiff to attention as a tobacconist’s sign, his ugly face hewn
out of brown oak, his honest, sullen mouth, and his blue eyes
staring into vacancy, I knew I had got the man I wanted.</p>

<p>"Hamilton," I said, "you and I have met before."</p>

<p>"Sirr?" came the mystified answer.</p>

<p>"Look at me, man, and tell me if you don’t recognise me."</p>

<p>He moved his eyes a fraction, in a respectful glance.</p>

<p>"Sirr, I don’t mind of you."</p>

<p>"Well, I’ll refresh your memory. Do you remember the hall in
Newmilns Street and the meeting there? You had a fight with a
man outside, and got knocked down."</p>

<p>He made no answer, but his colour deepened.</p>

<p>"And a fortnight later in a public-house in Muirtown you saw
the same man, and gave him the chase of his life."</p>

<p>I could see his mouth set, for visions of the penalties laid
down by the King’s Regulations for striking an officer must have
crossed his mind. But he never budged.</p>

<p>"Look me in the face, man," I said. "Do you remember me now?"</p>

<p>He did as he was bid.</p>

<p>"Sirr, I mind of you."</p>

<p>"Have you nothing more to say?"</p>

<p>He cleared his throat. "Sirr, I did not ken I was hittin’ an
officer."</p>

<p>"Of course you didn’t. You did perfectly right, and if the war
was over and we were both free men, I would give you a chance
of knocking me down here and now. That’s got to wait. When you
saw me last I was serving my country, though you didn’t know it.
We’re serving together now, and you must get your revenge out
of the Boche. I’m going to make you my servant, for you and I
have a pretty close bond between us. What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>This time he looked me full in the face. His troubled eye appraised
me and was satisfied. "I’m proud to be servant to ye, sirr," he
said. Then out of his chest came a strangled chuckle, and he forgot
his discipline. "Losh, but ye’re the great lad!" He recovered
himself promptly, saluted, and marched off.</p>

<p>The second episode befell during our brief rest after the Polygon
Wood, when I had ridden down the line one afternoon to see a friend
in the Heavy Artillery. I was returning in the drizzle of evening,
clanking along the greasy <em>pavé</em> between the sad poplars,
when I struck a Labour company repairing the ravages of a Boche
<em>strafe</em> that morning. I wasn’t very certain of my road
and asked one of the workers. He straightened himself and saluted,
and I saw beneath a disreputable cap the features of the man who
had been with me in the Coolin crevice.</p>

<p>I spoke a word to his sergeant, who fell him out, and he walked
a bit of the way with me.</p>

<p>"Great Scot, Wake, what brought you here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Same thing as brought you. This rotten war."</p>

<p>I had dismounted and was walking beside him, and I noticed that
his lean face had lost its pallor and that his eyes were less
hot than they used to be.</p>

<p>"You seem to thrive on it," I said, for I did not know what to
say. A sudden shyness possessed me. Wake must have gone through
some violent cyclones of feeling before it came to this. He saw
what I was thinking and laughed in his sharp, ironical way.</p>

<p>"Don’t flatter yourself you’ve made a convert. I think as I always
thought. But I came to the conclusion that since the fates had
made me a Government servant I might as well do my work somewhere
less cushioned than a chair in the Home Office.... Oh, no, it
wasn’t a matter of principle. One kind of work’s as good as another,
and I’m a better clerk than a navvy. With me it was self-indulgence:
I wanted fresh air and exercise."</p>

<p>I looked at him—mud to the waist, and his hands all blistered
and cut with unaccustomed labour. I could realise what his associates
must mean to him, and how he would relish the rough tonguing of
non-coms.</p>

<p>"You’re a confounded humbug," I said. "Why on earth didn’t you
go into an <em>O.T.C. </em>and come out with a commission? They’re
easy enough to get."</p>

<p>"You mistake my case," he said bitterly. "I experienced no sudden
conviction about the justice of the war. I stand where I always
stood. I’m a non-combatant, and I wanted a change of civilian
work.... No, it wasn’t any idiotic tribunal sent me here. I came
of my own free will, and I’m really rather enjoying myself."</p>

<p>"It’s a rough job for a man like you," I said.</p>

<p>"Not so rough as the fellows get in the trenches. I watched a
battalion marching back today and they looked like ghosts who
had been years in muddy graves. White faces and dazed eyes and
leaden feet. Mine’s a cushy job. I like it best when the weather’s
foul. It cheats me into thinking I’m doing my duty."</p>

<p>I nodded towards a recent shell-hole. "Much of that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"Now and then. We had a good dusting this morning. I can’t say
I liked it at the time, but I like to look back on it. A sort
of moral anodyne."</p>

<p>"I wonder what on earth the rest of your lot make of you?"</p>

<p>"They don’t make anything. I’m not remarkable for my <em>bonhomie</em>.
They think I’m a prig—which I am. It doesn’t amuse me to talk
about beer and women or listen to a gramophone or grouse about
my last meal. But I’m quite content, thank you. Sometimes I get
a seat in a corner of a <em>Y.M.C.A. </em>hut, and I’ve a book
or two. My chief affliction is the padre. He was up at Keble in
my time, and, as one of my colleagues puts it, wants to be ‘too
bloody helpful’.... What are you doing, Hannay? I see you’re some
kind of general. They’re pretty thick on the ground here."</p>

<p>"I’m a sort of general. Soldiering in the Salient isn’t the softest
of jobs, but I don’t believe it’s as tough as yours is for you.
D’you know, Wake, I wish I had you in my brigade. Trained or untrained,
you’re a dashed stout-hearted fellow."</p>

<p>He laughed with a trifle less acidity than usual. "Almost thou
persuadest me to be combatant. No, thank you. I haven’t the courage,
and besides there’s my jolly old principles. All the same I’d
like to be near you. You’re a good chap, and I’ve had the honour
to assist in your education.... I must be getting back, or the
sergeant will think I’ve bolted."</p>

<p>We shook hands, and the last I saw of him was a figure saluting
stiffly in the wet twilight.</p>

<p>The third incident was trivial enough, though momentous in its
results. Just before I got the division I had a bout of malaria.
We were in support in the Salient, in very uncomfortable trenches
behind Wieltje, and I spent three days on my back in a dug-out.
Outside was a blizzard of rain, and the water now and then came
down the stairs through the gas curtain and stood in pools at
my bed foot. It wasn’t the merriest place to convalesce in, but
I was as hard as nails at the time and by the third day I was
beginning to sit up and be bored.</p>

<p>I read all my English papers twice and a big stack of German
ones which I used to have sent up by a friend in the <em>G.H.Q.
</em>Intelligence, who knew I liked to follow what the Boche was
saying. As I dozed and ruminated in the way a man does after fever,
I was struck by the tremendous display of one advertisement in
the English press. It was a thing called "Gussiter’s Deep-breathing
System," which, according to its promoter, was a cure for every
ill, mental, moral, or physical, that man can suffer. Politicians,
generals, admirals, and music-hall artists all testified to the
new life it had opened up for them. I remember wondering what
these sportsmen got for their testimonies, and thinking I would
write a spoof letter myself to old Gussiter.</p>

<p>Then I picked up the German papers, and suddenly my eye caught
an advertisement of the same kind in the <em>Frankfurter Zeitung</em>.
It was not Gussiter this time, but one Weissmann, but his game
was identical—"deep breathing". The Hun style was different from
the English—all about the Goddess of Health, and the Nymphs of
the Mountains, and two quotations from Schiller. But the principle
was the same.</p>

<p>That made me ponder a little, and I went carefully through the
whole batch. I found the advertisement in the <em>Frankfurter</em>
and in one or two rather obscure <em>Volkstimmes</em> and <em>Volkszeitungs</em>.
I found it too in <em>Der Grosse Krieg</em>, the official German
propagandist picture-paper. They were the same all but one, and
that one had a bold variation, for it contained four of the sentences
used in the ordinary English advertisement.</p>

<p>This struck me as fishy, and I started to write a letter to Macgillivray
pointing out what seemed to be a case of trading with the enemy,
and advising him to get on to Mr Gussiter’s financial backing.
I thought he might find a Hun syndicate behind him. And then I
had another notion, which made me rewrite my letter.</p>

<p>I went through the papers again. The English ones which contained
the advertisement were all good, solid, bellicose organs; the
kind of thing no censorship would object to leaving the country.
I had before me a small sheaf of pacifist prints, and they had
not the advertisement. That might be for reasons of circulation,
or it might not. The German papers were either Radical or Socialist
publications, just the opposite of the English lot, except the
<em>Grosse Krieg</em>. Now we have a free press, and Germany has,
strictly speaking, none. All her journalistic indiscretions are
calculated. Therefore the Boche has no objection to his rags getting
to enemy countries. He wants it. He likes to see them quoted in
columns headed "Through German Glasses", and made the text of
articles showing what a good democrat he is becoming.</p>

<p>As I puzzled over the subject, certain conclusions began to form
in my mind. The four identical sentences seemed to hint that "Deep
Breathing’ had Boche affiliations. Here was a chance of communicating
with the enemy which would defy the argus-eyed gentlemen who examine
the mails. What was to hinder Mr A at one end writing an advertisement
with a good cipher in it, and the paper containing it getting
into Germany by Holland in three days? Herr B at the other end
replied in the <em>Frankfurter</em>, and a few days later shrewd
editors and acute Intelligence officers—and Mr A—were reading
it in London, though only Mr A knew what it really meant.</p>

<p>It struck me as a bright idea, the sort of simple thing that
doesn’t occur to clever people, and very rarely to the Boche.
I wished I was not in the middle of a battle, for I would have
had a try at investigating the cipher myself. I wrote a long letter
to Macgillivray putting my case, and then went to sleep. When
I awoke I reflected that it was a pretty thin argument, and would
have stopped the letter, if it hadn’t gone off early by a ration
party.</p>

<p>After that things began very slowly to happen. The first was
when Hamilton, having gone to Boulogne to fetch some mess-stores,
returned with the startling news that he had seen Gresson. He
had not heard his name, but described him dramatically to me as
"the wee red-headed devil that kicked Ecky Brockie’s knee yon
time in Glesca, sirr," I recognised the description.</p>

<p>Gresson, it appeared, was joy-riding. He was with a party of
Labour delegates who had been met by two officers and carried
off in <em>chars-à-bancs</em>. Hamilton reported from inquiries
among his friends that this kind of visitor came weekly. I thought
it a very sensible notion on the Government’s part, but I wondered
how Gresson had been selected. I had hoped that Macgillivray had
weeks ago made a long arm and quodded him. Perhaps they had too
little evidence to hang him, but he was the blackest sort of suspect
and should have been interned.</p>

<p>A week later I had occasion to be at <em>G.H.Q. </em>on business
connected with my new division. My friends in the Intelligence
allowed me to use the direct line to London, and I called up Macgillivray.
For ten minutes I had an exciting talk, for I had had no news
from that quarter since I left England. I heard that the Portuguese
Jew had escaped—had vanished from his native heather when they
went to get him. They had identified him as a German professor
of Celtic languages, who had held a chair in a Welsh college—a
dangerous fellow, for he was an upright, high-minded, raging fanatic.
Against Gresson they had no evidence at all, but he was kept under
strict observation. When I asked about his crossing to France,
Macgillivray replied that that was part of their scheme. I inquired
if the visit had given them any clues, but I never got an answer,
for the line had to be cleared at that moment for the War Office.</p>

<p>I hunted up the man who had charge of these Labour visits, and
made friends with him. Gresson, he said, had been a quiet, well-mannered,
and most appreciative guest. He had wept tears on Vimy Ridge,
and—strictly against orders—had made a speech to some troops he
met on the Arras road about how British Labour was remembering
the Army in its prayers and sweating blood to make guns. On the
last day he had had a misadventure, for he got very sick on the
road—some kidney trouble that couldn’t stand the jolting of the
car—and had to be left at a village and picked up by the party
on its way back. They found him better, but still shaky. I cross-examined
the particular officer in charge about that halt, and learned
that Gresson had been left alone in a peasant’s cottage, for he
said he only needed to lie down. The place was the hamlet of Eaucourt
Sainte-Anne.</p>

<p>For several weeks that name stuck in my head. It had a pleasant,
quaint sound, and I wondered how Gresson had spent his hours there.
I hunted it up on the map, and promised myself to have a look
at it the next time we came out to rest. And then I forgot about
it till I heard the name mentioned again.</p>

<p>On 23rd October I had the bad luck, during a tour of my first-line
trenches, to stop a small shell-fragment with my head. It was
a close, misty day and I had taken off my tin hat to wipe my brow
when the thing happened. I got a long, shallow scalp wound which
meant nothing but bled a lot, and, as we were not in for any big
move, the <em>M.O. </em>sent me back to a clearing station to
have it seen to. I was three days in the place and, being perfectly
well, had leisure to look about me and reflect, so that I recall
that time as a queer, restful interlude in the infernal racket
of war. I remember yet how on my last night there a gale made
the lamps swing and flicker, and turned the grey-green canvas
walls into a mass of mottled shadows. The floor canvas was muddy
from the tramping of many feet bringing in the constant dribble
of casualties from the line. In my tent there was no one very
bad at the time, except a boy with his shoulder half-blown off
by a whizz-bang, who lay in a drugged sleep at the far end. The
majority were influenza, bronchitis, and trench-fever—waiting
to be moved to the base, or convalescent and about to return to
their units.</p>

<p>A small group of us dined off tinned chicken, stewed fruit, and
ration cheese round the smoky stove, where two screens manufactured
from packing cases gave some protection against the draughts which
swept like young tornadoes down the tent. One man had been reading
a book called the <em>Ghost Stories of an Antiquary</em>, and
the talk turned on the unexplainable things that happen to everybody
once or twice in a lifetime. I contributed a yarn about the men
who went to look for Kruger’s treasure in the bushveld and got
scared by a green wildebeeste. It is a good yarn and I’ll write
it down some day. A tall Highlander, who kept his slippered feet
on the top of the stove, and whose costume consisted of a kilt,
a British warm, a grey hospital dressing-gown, and four pairs
of socks, told the story of the Camerons at First Ypres, and of
the Lowland subaltern who knew no Gaelic and suddenly found himself
encouraging his men with some ancient Highland rigmarole. The
poor chap had a racking bronchial cough, which suggested that
his country might well use him on some warmer battle-ground than
Flanders. He seemed a bit of a scholar and explained the Cameron
business in a lot of long words.</p>

<p>I remember how the talk meandered on as talk does when men are
idle and thinking about the next day. I didn’t pay much attention,
for I was reflecting on a change I meant to make in one of my
battalion commands, when a fresh voice broke in. It belonged to
a Canadian captain from Winnipeg, a very silent fellow who smoked
shag tobacco.</p>

<p>"There’s a lot of ghosts in this darned country," he said.</p>

<p>Then he started to tell about what happened to him when his division
was last back in rest billets. He had a staff job and put up with
the divisional command at an old French château. They had only
a little bit of the house; the rest was shut up, but the passages
were so tortuous that it was difficult to keep from wandering
into the unoccupied part. One night, he said, he woke with a mighty
thirst, and, since he wasn’t going to get cholera by drinking
the local water in his bedroom, he started out for the room they
messed in to try to pick up a whisky-and-soda. He couldn’t find
it, though he knew the road like his own name. He admitted he
might have taken a wrong turning, but he didn’t think so. Anyway
he landed in a passage which he had never seen before, and, since
he had no candle, he tried to retrace his steps. Again he went
wrong, and groped on till he saw a faint light which he thought
must be the room of the <em>G.S.O., </em>a good fellow and a friend
of his. So he barged in, and found a big, dim salon with two figures
in it and a lamp burning between them, and a queer, unpleasant
smell about. He took a step forward, and then he saw that the
figures had no faces. That fairly loosened his joints with fear,
and he gave a cry. One of the two ran towards him, the lamp went
out, and the sickly scent caught suddenly at his throat. After
that he knew nothing till he awoke in his own bed next morning
with a splitting headache. He said he got the General’s permission
and went over all the unoccupied part of the house, but he couldn’t
find the room. Dust lay thick on everything, and there was no
sign of recent human presence.</p>

<p>I give the story as he told it in his drawling voice. "I reckon
that was the genuine article in ghosts. You don’t believe me and
conclude I was drunk? I wasn’t. There isn’t any drink concocted
yet that could lay me out like that. I just struck a crack in
the old universe and pushed my head outside. It may happen to
you boys any day."</p>

<p>The Highlander began to argue with him, and I lost interest in
the talk. But one phrase brought me to attention. "I’ll give you
the name of the darned place, and next time you’re around you
can do a bit of prospecting for yourself. It’s called the Château
of Eaucourt Sainte-Anne, about seven kilometres from Douvecourt.
If I was purchasing real estate in this country I guess I’d give
that location a miss."</p>

<p>After that I had a grim month, what with the finish of Third
Ypres and the hustles to Cambrai. By the middle of December we
had shaken down a bit, but the line my division held was not of
our choosing, and we had to keep a wary eye on the Boche doings.
It was a weary job, and I had no time to think of anything but
the military kind of intelligence—fixing the units against us
from prisoners’ stories, organizing small raids, and keeping the
Royal Flying Corps busy. I was keen about the last, and I made
several trips myself over the lines with Archie Roylance, who
had got his heart’s desire and by good luck belonged to the squadron
just behind me. I said as little as possible about this, for <em>G.H.Q.
</em>did not encourage divisional generals to practise such methods,
though there was one famous army commander who made a hobby of
them. It was on one of these trips that an incident occurred which
brought my spell of waiting on the bigger game to an end.</p>

<p>One dull December day, just after luncheon, Archie and I set
out to reconnoitre. You know the way that fogs in Picardy seem
suddenly to reek out of the ground and envelop the slopes like
a shawl. That was our luck this time. We had crossed the lines,
flying very high, and received the usual salute of Hun Archies.
After a mile or two the ground seemed to climb up to us, though
we hadn’t descended, and presently we were in the heart of a cold,
clinging mist. We dived for several thousand feet, but the confounded
thing grew thicker and no sort of landmark could be found anywhere.
I thought if we went on at this rate we should hit a tree or a
church steeple and be easy fruit for the enemy.</p>

<p>The same thought must have been in Archie’s mind, for he climbed
again. We got into a mortally cold zone, but the air was no clearer.
Thereupon he decided to head for home, and passed me word to work
out a compass course on the map. That was easier said than done,
but I had a rough notion of the rate we had travelled since we
had crossed the lines and I knew our original direction, so I
did the best I could. On we went for a bit, and then I began to
get doubtful. So did Archie. We dropped low down, but we could
hear none of the row that’s always going on for a mile on each
side of the lines. The world was very eerie and deadly still,
so still that Archie and I could talk through the speaking-tube.</p>

<p>"We’ve mislaid this blamed battle," he shouted.</p>

<p>"I think your rotten old compass has soured on us," I replied.</p>

<p>We decided that it wouldn’t do to change direction, so we held
on the same course. I was getting as nervous as a kitten, chiefly
owing to the silence. It’s not what you expect in the middle of
a battle-field.... I looked at the compass carefully and saw that
it was really crocked. Archie must have damaged it on a former
flight and forgotten to have it changed.</p>

<p>He had a very scared face when I pointed this out.</p>

<p>"Great God!" he croaked—for he had a fearsome cold—"we’re either
about Calais or near Paris or miles the wrong side of the Boche
line. What the devil are we to do?"</p>

<p>And then to put the lid on it his engine went wrong. It was the
same performance as on the Yorkshire moors, and seemed to be a
speciality of the Shark-Gladas type. But this time the end came
quick. We dived steeply, and I could see by Archie’s grip on the
stick that he was going to have his work cut out to save our necks.
Save them he did, but not by much for we jolted down on the edge
of a ploughed field with a series of bumps that shook the teeth
in my head. It was the same dense, dripping fog, and we crawled
out of the old bus and bolted for cover like two ferreted rabbits.</p>

<p>Our refuge was the lee of a small copse.</p>

<p>"It’s my opinion," said Archie solemnly, "that we’re somewhere
about La Cateau. Tim Wilbraham got left there in the Retreat,
and it took him nine months to make the Dutch frontier. It’s a
giddy prospect, sir."</p>

<p>I sallied out to reconnoitre. At the other side of the wood was
a highway, and the fog so blanketed sound that I could not hear
a man on it till I saw his face. The first one I saw made me lie
flat in the covert.... For he was a German soldier, field-grey,
forage cap, red band and all, and he had a pick on his shoulder.</p>

<p>A second’s reflection showed me that this was not final proof.
He might be one of our prisoners. But it was no place to take
chances. I went back to Archie, and the pair of us crossed the
ploughed field and struck the road farther on. There we saw a
farmer’s cart with a woman and child in it. They looked French,
but melancholy, just what you would expect from the inhabitants
of a countryside in enemy occupation.</p>

<p>Then we came to the park wall of a great house, and saw dimly
the outlines of a cottage. Here sooner or later we would get proof
of our whereabouts, so we lay and shivered among the poplars of
the roadside. No one seemed abroad that afternoon. For a quarter
of an hour it was as quiet as the grave. Then came a sound of
whistling, and muffled steps.</p>

<p>"That’s an Englishman," said Archie joyfully. "No Boche could
make such a beastly noise."</p>

<p>He was right. The form of an Army Service Corps private emerged
from the mist, his cap on the back of his head, his hands in his
pockets, and his walk the walk of a free man. I never saw a welcomer
sight than that jam-merchant.</p>

<p>We stood up and greeted him. "What’s this place?" I shouted.</p>

<p>He raised a grubby hand to his forelock.</p>

<p>"Ockott Saint Anny, sir," he said. "Beg pardon, sir, but you
ain’t whurt, sir?"</p>

<p>Ten minutes later I was having tea in the mess of an <em>M.T.
</em>workshop while Archie had gone to the nearest Signals to
telephone for a car and give instructions about his precious bus.
It was almost dark, but I gulped my tea and hastened out into
the thick dusk. For I wanted to have a look at the Château.</p>

<p>I found a big entrance with high stone pillars, but the iron
gates were locked and looked as if they had not been opened in
the memory of man. Knowing the way of such places, I hunted for
the side entrance and found a muddy road which led to the back
of the house. The front was evidently towards a kind of park;
at the back was a nest of outbuildings and a section of moat which
looked very deep and black in the winter twilight. This was crossed
by a stone bridge with a door at the end of it.</p>

<p>Clearly the Château was not being used for billets. There was
no sign of the British soldier; there was no sign of anything
human. I crept through the fog as noiselessly as if I trod on
velvet, and I hadn’t even the company of my own footsteps. I remembered
the Canadian’s ghost story, and concluded I would be imagining
the same sort of thing if I lived in such a place.</p>

<p>The door was bolted and padlocked. I turned along the side of
the moat, hoping to reach the house front, which was probably
modern and boasted a civilised entrance. There must be somebody
in the place, for one chimney was smoking. Presently the moat
petered out, and gave place to a cobbled causeway, but a wall,
running at right angles with the house, blocked my way. I had
half a mind to go back and hammer at the door, but I reflected
that major-generals don’t pay visits to deserted châteaux at night
without a reasonable errand. I should look a fool in the eyes
of some old concierge. The daylight was almost gone, and I didn’t
wish to go groping about the house with a candle.</p>

<p>But I wanted to see what was beyond the wall—one of those whims
that beset the soberest men. I rolled a dissolute water-butt to
the foot of it, and gingerly balanced myself on its rotten staves.
This gave me a grip on the flat brick top, and I pulled myself
up.</p>

<p>I looked down on a little courtyard with another wall beyond
it, which shut off any view of the park. On the right was the
Château, on the left more outbuildings; the whole place was not
more than twenty yards each way. I was just about to retire by
the road I had come, for in spite of my fur coat it was uncommon
chilly on that perch, when I heard a key turn in the door in the
Château wall beneath me.</p>

<p>A lantern made a blur of light in the misty darkness. I saw that
the bearer was a woman, an oldish woman, round-shouldered like
most French peasants. In one hand she carried a leather bag, and
she moved so silently that she must have worn rubber boots. The
light was held level with her head and illumined her face. It
was the evillest thing I have ever beheld, for a horrible scar
had puckered the skin of the forehead and drawn up the eyebrows
so that it looked like some diabolical Chinese mask.</p>

<p>Slowly she padded across the yard, carrying the bag as gingerly
as if it had been an infant. She stopped at the door of one of
the outhouses and set down the lantern and her burden on the ground.
From her apron she drew something which looked like a gas-mask,
and put it over her head. She also put on a pair of long gauntlets.
Then she unlocked the door, picked up the lantern and went in.
I heard the key turn behind her.</p>

<p>Crouching on that wall, I felt a very ugly tremor run down my
spine. I had a glimpse of what the Canadian’s ghost might have
been. That hag, hooded like some venomous snake, was too much
for my stomach. I dropped off the wall and ran—yes, ran till I
reached the highroad and saw the cheery headlights of a transport
wagon, and heard the honest speech of the British soldier. That
restored me to my senses, and made me feel every kind of a fool.</p>

<p>As I drove back to the line with Archie, I was black ashamed
of my funk. I told myself that I had seen only an old countrywoman
going to feed her hens. I convinced my reason, but I did not convince
the whole of me. An insensate dread of the place hung around me,
and I could only retrieve my self-respect by resolving to return
and explore every nook of it.</p>
