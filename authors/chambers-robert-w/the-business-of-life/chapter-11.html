<p>Nobody, apparently, was yet astir; not a breakfast tray had yet
tinkled along the dusky corridors when Desboro, descending the
stairs in the dim morning light, encountered Jacqueline coming
from the general direction of the east wing, her arms loaded with
freshly cut white carnations.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he whispered, in smiling surprise, taking her
and her carnations into his arms very reverently, almost timidly.</p>

<p>She endured the contact shyly and seriously, as usual, bending
her head aside to avoid his lips.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," he said laughingly, "that you could ever bring
yourself to kiss me, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>She did not answer, and presently he released her, saying: "You
never have yet; and now that we're engaged&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Engaged!"</p>

<p>"You <em>know</em> we are!"</p>

<p>"Is that what you think, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! I asked you to marry me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, dear, <em>I</em> asked <em>you</em>. But I wasn't certain
you had quite accepted me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Are you laughing at me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know &mdash;I don't know what I am doing any more; laughter
and tears seem so close to each other&mdash;sometimes&mdash;and I can never
be certain which it is going to be any more."</p>

<p>Her eyes remained grave, but her lips were sweet and humourous
as she stood there on the stairs, her chin resting on the sheaf
of carnations clasped to her breast.</p>

<p>"What is troubling you, Jacqueline?" he asked, after a moment's
silence.</p>

<p>"Nothing. If you will hold these flowers a moment I'll decorate
you."</p>

<p>He took the fragrant sheaf from her; she selected a magnificent
white blossom, drew the stem through the lapel of his coat, patted
the flower into a position which suited her, regarded the effect
critically, then glanced up out of her winning blue eyes and found
him watching her dreamily.</p>

<p>"I try to realise it, and I can't," he said vaguely. "Can you,
dear?"</p>

<p>"Realise what?" she asked, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"That we are engaged."</p>

<p>"Are you so sure of me, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I could live life through without you <em>now</em>?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Try it for two minutes anyway; these flowers must
stand in water. Will you wait here for me?"</p>

<p>He stepped forward to aid her, but she passed him lightly, avoiding
his touch, and sped across the corridor. In a few minutes she
returned and they descended the stairs together, and entered the
empty library. She leaned back against the table, both slender
hands resting on the edge behind her, and gazed out at the sparrows
in the snow. And she did not even appear to notice his arm, which
ventured around her waist, or his lips resting against the lock
of bright hair curling on her cheek, so absorbed she seemed to
be in her silent reflections.</p>

<p>After a few moments she said, still looking out of the window:
"I must tell you something now."</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell me that you love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;perhaps I had better begin that way."</p>

<p>"Then begin, dearest."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I love you."</p>

<p>His arm tightened around her, but she gently released herself.</p>

<p>"There is a&mdash;a little more to say, Jim. I love you enough to
give you back your promise."</p>

<p>"My promise!"</p>

<p>"To marry me," she said steadily. "I scarcely knew what I was
saying yesterday &mdash;I was so excited, so much in love with
you&mdash;so fearful that you might sometime be unhappy if things continued
with us as they threatened to continue. I'm afraid I overvalued
myself&mdash;made you suspect that I am more than I really am&mdash;or can
ever be. Besides, I frightened you&mdash;and myself&mdash;unnecessarily.
I never could be in any danger of&mdash;of loving you&mdash;unwisely. It
was not perfectly fair to you to hint such a thing&mdash;because, after
all, there is a third choice for you. A worthy one. For you <em>could</em>
let me go my way out of your life, which is already so full, and
which would fill again very easily, even if my absence left a
little void for a while. And if it was any kind of pity you felt
for me&mdash;for what I said to you&mdash;that stirred you to&mdash;ask of me
what I begged you to ask&mdash;then I give you back your promise. I
have not slept for thinking over it. I must give it back."</p>

<p>He remained silent for a while, then his arms slipped down around
her body and he dropped on one knee beside her and laid his face
close against her. She had to bend over to hear what he was saying,
he spoke so low and with such difficulty.</p>

<p>"How can you care for me?" he said. "How <em>can</em> you? Don't
you understand what a beast I was&mdash;what lesser impulse possessed
me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Hush, Jim! Am I different?"</p>

<p>"Good God! Yes!"</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're saying!"</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> don't know. Do you suppose I am immune to&mdash;to the&mdash;lesser
love&mdash;at moments&#11834;"</p>

<p>He lifted his head and looked up at her, dismayed.</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"I. How else could I understand <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"Because you are so far above everything unworthy."</p>

<p>"No, dear. If I were, you would only have angered and frightened
me&mdash;not made me sorry for us both. Because women and men are something
alike at moments; only, somehow, women seem to realise that&mdash;somehow&mdash;they
are guardians of&mdash;of something&mdash;of civilisation, perhaps. And
it is their instinct to curb and silence and ignore whatever unworthy
threatens it or them. It is that way with us, Jim."</p>

<p>She looked out of the window at the sky and the trees, and stood
thinking for a while. Then: "Did you suppose it is always easy
for a girl in love&mdash;whose instinct is to love&mdash;and to give? Especially
such a girl as I am, especially when she is so dreadfully afraid
that her lover may think her cold-blooded&mdash;self-seeking&mdash;perhaps
a&mdash;a schemer&#11834;"</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hand&mdash;the quick, adorable gesture
he knew so well.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em><em>did</em> ask you to marry me," she said, in
a stifled voice, "but I am not a schemer; my motive was not self-interest.
It was for you I asked it, Jim, far more than for myself&mdash;or I
never could have found the courage&mdash;perhaps not even the wish.
Because, somehow, I am too proud to wish for anything that is
not offered."</p>

<p>As he said nothing, she broke out suddenly with a little sob
of protest in her voice: "I am <em>not</em> a self-seeking, calculating
woman! I am not naturally cold and unresponsive! I am&mdash;inclined
to be&mdash;otherwise. And you had better know it. But you won't believe
it, I am afraid, because I &mdash;I have never responded to&mdash;to
you."</p>

<p>Tears fell between her fingers over the flushed cheeks. She spoke
with increasing effort: "You don't understand; and I can't explain&mdash;except
to say that to be demonstrative seemed unworthy in me."</p>

<p>He put his arms around her shoulders very gently; she rested
her forehead against his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't think me calculating and cold-blooded&mdash;or a fool," she
whispered. "Probably everybody kisses or is kissed. I know it
as well as you do. But I haven't the&mdash;effrontery&mdash;to permit myself&mdash;such
emotions. I couldn't, Jim. I'd hate myself. And I thought of that,
too, when I asked you to marry me. Because if you had refused&mdash;and&mdash;matters
had gone on&mdash;you would have been sorry for me sooner or later&mdash;or
perhaps hated me. Because I would have been&mdash;been too much ashamed
of myself to have&mdash;loved you&mdash;unwisely."</p>

<p>He stood with head bent, listening; and, as he listened, the
comparison between this young girl and himself forced itself into
his unwilling mind&mdash;how that all she believed and desired ennobled
her, and how what had always governed him had made of him nothing
more admirable than what he was born, a human animal. For what
he began as he still was&mdash;only cleverer.</p>

<p>What else was he&mdash;except a trained animal, sufficiently educated
to keep out of jail? What had he done with his inheritance? His
body was sane and healthy; he had been at pains to cultivate that.
How was it with his mind? How was it with his spiritual beliefs?
Had he cultivated and added to either? He had been endowed with
a brain. Had he made of it anything except an instrument for idle
caprice and indolent passions to play upon?</p>

<p>"Do you understand me now?" she whispered, touching wet lashes
with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>He replied impetuously, hotly; her hands dropped from her face
and she looked up at him with sweet, confused eyes, blushing vividly
under his praise of her.</p>

<p>He spoke of himself, too, with all the quick, impassioned impulse
of youthful emotion, not sparing himself, promising better things,
vowing them before the shrine of her innocence. Yet, a stronger
character might have registered such vows in silence. And his
fervour and incoherence left her mute; and after he had ceased
to protest too much she stood quiet for a while, striving to search
herself so that nothing unworthy should remain&mdash;so that heart
and soul should be clean under the magic veil of happiness descending
before her enraptured eyes.</p>

<p>Gently his arms encircled her; her clasped hands rested on his
shoulder, and she gazed out at the blue sky and sun-warmed snow
as at a corner of paradise revealed.</p>

<p>Later, when the household was astir, she went out with him into
the greenhouse, where the enchanted stillness of growing things
thrilled her, and the fragrance and sunlight made the mystery
of love and its miracle even more exquisitely unreal to her.</p>

<p>At first they did not speak; her hand lay loosely in his, her
blue eyes remained remote; and together they slowly paced the
long, glass-sheeted galleries between misty, scented mounds of
bloom, to and fro, under the flood of pallid winter sunshine,
pale as the yellow jasmine flowers overhead.</p>

<p>After a while a fat gardener came into one of the further wings.
Presently the sound of shovelled coal from the furnace-pit aroused
them from their dream; and they looked at each other gravely.</p>

<p>After a moment, he said: "Does it make a difference to you, Jacqueline,
what I was before I knew you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I was only wondering what you really think of me."</p>

<p>"You know already, Jim."</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"Jim! Of course you know!" she insisted hotly. "What you may
have been before I knew you I refuse to consider. Anyway, it was
<em>you</em>&mdash;part of you&mdash;and belongs to me now! Because I choose
to make it mine&mdash;all that you were and are&mdash;good and evil! For
I won't give up one atom of you&mdash;even to the devil himself!"</p>

<p>He tried to laugh: "What a fierce little partisan you are," he
said.</p>

<p>"Very&mdash;where it concerns you," she said, unsmiling.</p>

<p>"Dear &mdash;I had better tell you now; you may hear things about
me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I won't listen to them!"</p>

<p>"No; but one sometimes hears without listening. People may say
things. They <em>will</em> say things. I wish I could spare you.
If I had known&mdash;if I had only known&mdash;that you were in the world&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't, Jim! It&mdash;it isn't best for me to hear. It doesn't concern
me," she insisted excitedly. "And if anybody dares say one word
to me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Wait, dear. All I want to be sure of is that you <em>do</em>
love me enough to&mdash;to go on loving me. I want to be certain, and
I want you to be certain before you are a bride&#11834;"</p>

<p>She was growing very much excited, and suddenly near to tears,
for the one thing that endangered her self-control seemed to be
his doubt of her.</p>

<p>"There is nothing that I haven't forgiven you," she said. "Nothing!
There is nothing I won't forgive&mdash;except&mdash;one thing&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I can't say it. I can't even think it. All I know is that <em>now</em>
I couldn't forgive it." Suddenly she became perfectly quiet.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes. It is what no wife can forgive." She looked at him, clear
eyed, intelligent, calm; for the moment without any illusion;
and he seemed to feel that, in the light of what she knew of him,
she was coolly weighing the danger of the experiment. Never had
he seen so cold and lustrous a brow, such limpid clarity of eye,
searching, fearless, direct. Then, in an instant, it all seemed
to melt into flushed and winsome loveliness; and she was murmuring
that she loved him, and asking pardon for even one second's hesitation.</p>

<p>"It never could be; it is unthinkable," she whispered. "And it
is too late anyway for me &mdash;I would love you now, whatever
you killed in me. Because I must go on loving you, Jim; for that
is the way it is with me, and I know it now. As long as there
is life in me I'll strive for you in my own fashion&mdash;even against
yourself&mdash;to keep you for mine, to please you, to be to you and
to the world what you wish me to be&mdash;for your honour and your
happiness&mdash;which also must be my own&mdash;the only happiness, now,
that I can ever understand."</p>

<p>He held her in his arms, smoothing the bright hair, touching
the white brow with his lips at moments, happy because he was
so deeply in love, fearful because of it&mdash;and, deep in his soul,
miserable, afraid lest aught out of his past life return again
to mock her&mdash;lest some echo of folly offend her ears&mdash;some shadow
fall&mdash;some phantom of dead days rise from their future hearth
to stand between them.</p>

<p>It is that way with a man who has lived idly and irresponsibly,
and who has gone lightly about the pleasure of life and not its
business. For sometimes there arrives an hour of unbidden clairvoyance&mdash;not
necessarily a spiritual awakening&mdash;but a moment of balanced intelligence
and sanity and clear vision. And when it arrives, the road to
yesterday suddenly becomes visible for its entire length; and
when a man looks back he sees it stretching away behind him, peopled
with every shape that has ever traversed it, and every spectre
that ever has haunted it.</p>

<p>Sorrow for what need not have been, regret and shame for what
had been&mdash;and the bitterness of the folly&mdash;the knowledge, too
late, of what he could have been to the girl he held now in his
arms&mdash;how he could have met her on more equal terms had he saved
his youth and strength and innocence and pride for her alone&mdash;how
he could have given it unsullied into her keeping. All this Desboro
was beginning to realise now. And many men have realised it when
the tardy understanding came too late. For what has been is still
and will be always; and shall appear here or hereafter, or after
that&mdash;somewhere, sometime, inevitably, inexorably. There is no
such thing as expunging what has been, or of erasing what is to
be. All records stand; hope lies only in lengthening the endless
chapters&mdash;chapters which will not be finished when the sun dies,
and the moon fails, and the stars go out forever.</p>

</div>
<p>Walking slowly back together, they passed Herrendene in the wing
hall, and his fine and somewhat melancholy face lighted up at
the encounter.</p>

<p>"I'm <em>so</em> sorry you are going to-day," said Jacqueline,
with all her impulsive and sweet sincerity. "Everybody will miss
you and wish you here again."</p>

<p>"To be regretted is one of the few real pleasures in life," he
said, smiling. His quick eye had rested on Desboro and then reverted
to her, and his intuition was warning him with all the brutality
and finality of reason that his last hope of her must end.</p>

<p>Desboro said: "I hate to have you go, Herrendene, but I suppose
you must."</p>

<p>"Must you?" echoed Jacqueline, wistful for the moment. But the
irresistible radiance of happiness had subtly transfigured her,
and Herrendene looked into her eyes and saw the new-born beauty
in them, shyly apparent.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I must be about the business of life&mdash;the business
of life, Miss Nevers. Everybody is engaged in it; it has many
names, but it's all the same business. You, for example, pass
judgment on beautiful things; Desboro, here, is a farmer, and
I play soldier with sword and drum. But it's all the same business&mdash;the
business of life; and one can work at it or idle through it, but
never escape it, because, at the last, every soul in the world
must die in harness. And the idlest are the heaviest laden." He
laughed. "That's quite a sermon, isn't it, Miss Nevers? And shall
I make my adieux now? Were you going anywhere? You see I am leaving
Silverwood directly after breakfast&#11834;"</p>

<p>"As though Mr. Desboro and I would go off anywhere and not say
good-bye to <em>you</em>!" she exclaimed indignantly, quite unconscious
of being too obvious.</p>

<p>So they all three returned to the breakfast room together, where
Clydesdale, who had come over from the Hammertons' for breakfast,
was already tramping hungrily around the covered dishes on the
sideboard, hot plate in hand, evidently meditating a wholesale
assault. He grinned affably as Jacqueline and Desboro came in,
and they all helped themselves from the warmers, returning laden
to the table with whatever suited their fancy. Other guests, to
whom no trays had been sent, arrived one after another to prowl
around the browse and join in the conversation if they chose,
or sulk, as is the fashion with some perfectly worthy souls at
breakfast-tide.</p>

<p>"This thaw settles the skating for good and all," remarked Reggie
Ledyard. "Will you go fishing with me, Miss Nevers? It's our last
day, you know."</p>

<p>Cairns growled over his grape-fruit: "You can't make dates with
Miss Nevers at the breakfast table. It isn't done. I was going
to ask her to do something with me, anyway."</p>

<p>"I hate breakfast," said Van Alstyne. "When I see it I always
wish I were dead or that everybody else was. Zooks! This cocktail
helps some! Try one, Miss Nevers."</p>

<p>"There's reason in your grouch," remarked Bertie Barkley, with
his hard-eyed smile, "considering what Aunt Hannah and I did to
you and Helsa at auction last night."</p>

<p>"Aunt Hannah will live in luxury for a year on it," added Cairns
maliciously. "Doesn't it make you happy, Stuyve?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;blub!" muttered Van Alstyne, hating everybody and himself&mdash;and
most of all hating to think of his losses and of the lady who
caused them. Only the really rich know how card losses rankle.</p>

<p>Cairns glanced banteringly across at Jacqueline. It was his form
of wit to quiz her because she neither indulged in cocktails nor
cigarettes, nor played cards for stakes. He lifted his eyebrows
and tapped the frosted shaker beside him significantly.</p>

<p>"I've a new kind of mountain dew, warranted to wake the dead,
Miss Nevers. I call it the 'Aunt Hannah,' in her honour&mdash;honour
to whom honour is dew," he added impudently. "Won't you let me
make you a cocktail?"</p>

<p>"Wait until Aunt Hannah hears how you have honoured her and tempted
me," laughed Jacqueline.</p>

<p>  "I never tempted maid or wife   Or suffragette in all my life&#11834;"</p>

<p>sang Ledyard, beating time on Van Alstyne, who silently scowled
his displeasure.</p>

<p>Presently Ledyard selected a grape-fruit, with a sour smile at
one of Desboro's cats which had confidently leaped into his lap.</p>

<p>"Is this a zoo den in the Bronx, or a breakfast room, Desboro?
I only ask because I'm all over cats."</p>

<p>Bertie Barkley snapped his napkin at an intrusive yellow pup
who was sniffing and wagging at his elbow.</p>

<p>Jacqueline comforted the retreating animal, bending over and
crooning in his floppy ear:</p>

<p>"They gotta stop kickin' my dawg aroun'."</p>

<p>"What do <em>you</em> care what they do to Jim's live stock,
Miss Nevers?" demanded Ledyard suspiciously.</p>

<p>She laughed, but to her annoyance a warmer colour brightened
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Heaven help us!" exclaimed Reggie. "Miss Nevers is blushing
at the breakfast table. Gentlemen, <em>are</em> we done for without
even suspecting it? And by that&mdash;that"&mdash;pointing a furious finger
at Desboro&mdash;"<em>that</em>!"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Desboro, smiling. "Did you imagine I'd ever
let Miss Nevers escape from Silverwood?"</p>

<p>Ledyard heaved a sigh of relief: "Gad," he muttered, "I suspected
you both for a moment. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Every man here
would have murdered you in turn. Come on, Miss Nevers; you've
made a big splash with me, and I'll play you a game of rabbit&mdash;or
anything on earth, if you'll let me run along beside you."</p>

<p>"No, I'm driving with Captain Herrendene to the station," she
said; and that melancholy soldier looked up in grateful surprise.</p>

<p>And she did go with him; and everybody came out on the front
steps to wish him <em>bon voyage</em>.</p>

<p>"Are you coming back, Miss Nevers?" asked Ledyard, in pretended
alarm.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Is Manila worth seeing, Captain Herrendene?" she
asked, laughingly.</p>

<p>"If you sail for Manila with that tin soldier I'll go after you
in a hydroplane!" called Reggie after them, as the car rolled
away. He added frankly, for everybody's benefit: "I hate any man
who even looks at her, and I don't care who knows it. But what's
the use? Going to night-school might help me, but I doubt it.
No; she's for a better line of goods than the samples at Silverwood.
She shines too far above us. Mark that, James Desboro! And take
what comfort you can in your reflected glory. For had she not
been the spotlight, you'd look exactly like the rest of us. And
that isn't flattering anybody, I'm thinking."</p>

<p>It was to be the last day of the party. Everybody was leaving
directly after luncheon, and now everybody seemed inclined to
do nothing in particular. Mrs. Clydesdale came over from the Hammerton's.
The air was soft and springlike; the snow in the fields was melting
and full of golden pools. People seemed to be inclined to stroll
about outdoors without their hats; a lively snowball battle began
between Cary Clydesdale on one side and Cairns and Reggie Ledyard
on the other&mdash;and gradually was participated in by everybody except
Aunt Hannah, who grimly watched it from the library window. But
her weather eye never left Mrs. Clydesdale.</p>

<p>She was still standing at the window when somebody entered the
library behind her, and somebody else followed. She knew who they
were; the curtains screened her. For one second the temptation
to listen beset her, but she put it away with a sniff, and had
already turned to disclose herself when she heard Mrs. Clydesdale
say something that stiffened her into a rigid silence.</p>

<p>What followed stiffened her still more&mdash;and there were only a
few words, too&mdash;only:</p>

<p>"For God's sake, what are you thinking of?" from Desboro; and
from Elena Clydesdale:</p>

<p>"This has got to end &mdash;I can't stand it, Jim&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Stand what?"</p>

<p>"Him! And what you are doing!"</p>

<p>"Be careful! Do you want people to overhear us?" he said, in
a low voice of concentrated anger.</p>

<p>"Then where&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Wait until these people leave&#11834;"</p>

<p>"To-night?"</p>

<p>"How can we see each other to-night!"</p>

<p>"Cary is going to New York&#11834;"</p>

<p>Voices approaching through the hall warned him:</p>

<p>"All right, to-night," he said, desperately. "Go out into the
hall."</p>

<p>"To-night, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She turned and walked out into the hall. He heard her voice calmly
joining in the chatter now approaching, and, without any reason,
he walked to the window. And found Mrs. Hammerton there.</p>

<p>Astonishment and anger left him dumb and scarlet to the roots
of his hair.</p>

<p>"It isn't my fault," she hissed. "You and that other fool had
already committed yourselves before I could stir to warn you.
What do I care for your vile little intrigues, anyway! I don't
have to listen behind curtains to learn what anybody could have
seen at the Metropolitan Opera&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You are absolutely mistaken&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No doubt, James. But whether I am or not makes absolutely no
difference to me&mdash;or to Jacqueline Nevers&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"What I say, exactly. It will make no difference to Jacqueline,
because you are going to keep your distance."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"If you don't keep away from her I'll tell her a few things.
Listen to me very carefully, James. You think I'm fond of you,
don't you? Well, I am. But I've taken a fancy to Jacqueline Nevers
that&mdash;well, if I were not childless I might feel it less deeply.
I've put my arms around her once and for all. Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I tell you," he said steadily, "you are mistaken in believing&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Very well. Granted. What of it? One dirty little intrigue more
or less doesn't alter what you are and have been. The plain point
of the matter is this, James: you are not fit to aspire seriously
to Jacqueline Nevers. Are you? I ask you, now, honestly; are you?"</p>

<p>"Does that concern you?"</p>

<p>She fairly snapped her teeth and her eyes sparkled:</p>

<p>"Yes; it concerns me! Keep away! I warn you&mdash;you and the rest
of the Jacks and Reggies and similar assorted pups. Your hunting
ground is elsewhere."</p>

<p>A sort of cold fury possessed him: "You had better not say anything
to Miss Nevers about what you overheard in this room," he said
in a colourless voice.</p>

<p>"I'll use my own judgment," she retorted tartly.</p>

<p>"Use mine. It is perhaps better. Don't interfere."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, James."</p>

<p>"Will you listen to me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"About Elena Clydesdale?" she asked maliciously.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to tell about her."</p>

<p>"Naturally. I never heard the Desboros were blackguards&mdash;only
a trifle airy, James&mdash;a trifle gallant! Dear child, don't anger
me. You know it wouldn't be well for you."</p>

<p>"I ask you merely to mind your business."</p>

<p>"That I shall do. My life's business is Jacqueline. You yourself
made her so&#11834;" Malice indescribable snapped in her tiny black
eyes, and she laughed harshly. "You made that motherless girl
my business. Ask yourself if you've ever, inadvertently, done
as decent a thing?"</p>

<p>"Do you understand that I wish to marry her?" he asked, white
with passion.</p>

<p>"<em>You!</em> What do I care what your patronising intentions
may be? And, James, if you drive me to it&#11834;" she fairly glared
at him, " &mdash;I'll destroy even your acquaintanceship with
her. And I possess the means to do it!"</p>

<p>"Try it!" he motioned with dry lips.</p>

<p>A moment later the animated chatter of young people filled the
room, and among them sounded Jacqueline's voice.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, laughing, when she saw Mrs. Hammerton and Desboro
coming from the embrasure of the window. "Have you been flirting
again, Aunt Hannah!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old lady grimly, "and I think I've taken him
into camp."</p>

<p>"Then it's my turn," said Jacqueline. "Come on, Mr. Desboro,
you can't escape me. I'm going to beat you a game of rabbit!"</p>

<p>Everybody drifted into the billiard-room at their heels, and
found them already at their stations on either side of the pool
table, each one covering the side pocket with left hand spread
wide. Jacqueline had the cue-ball; it lay on the cloth in front
of her, and her slim right hand covered it.</p>

<p>"Ready?" she asked of Desboro.</p>

<p>"Ready," he said, watching her.</p>

<p>She made a feint; he sprang to the left; she shot the ball toward
the right corner pocket, missed, carromed, and tried to recover
it; but Desboro's arm shot out across the cloth and he seized
it and shot it at her left corner pocket. It went in with a plunk!</p>

<p>"One for Jim!" said Reggie gravely, and, picking up a cue, scored
with a button overhead.</p>

<p>"Plunk!" went the ball again into the same pocket; and Jacqueline
gave a little cry of dismay as Desboro leaned far over the table,
threatening, feinting, moving the ball so fast she could scarcely
follow his hand. Then she thought she saw the crisis coming, sprang
toward the left corner pocket, gave a cry of terror, and plunk!
went the ball into her side pocket.</p>

<p>Flushed, golden hair in pretty disorder, she sprang back on guard
again, and the onlookers watched the movement of her hands, fascinated
by their grace and beauty as she defended her side of the table
and, finally, snatched the ball from the very jaws of the right
corner.</p>

<p>It was a breathless, exciting game, even for rabbit, and was
fought to a furious finish; but she went down to defeat, and Desboro
came around the table to condole with her, and together they stepped
aside to leave the arena free for Katharine Frere and Reggie.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, dear," he said under his breath.</p>

<p>"It's what I want, Jim. Never let me take the lead again&mdash;in
anything."</p>

<p>His laugh was not genuine. He glanced across the room and saw
Aunt Hannah pretending not to watch him. Near her stood Elena
Clydesdale beside her husband, making no such pretence.</p>

<p>He said in a low voice: "Jacqueline, would you marry me as soon
as I can get a license&mdash;if I asked you to do it?"</p>

<p>She blushed furiously; then walked over to the window and gazed
out, dismayed and astounded. He followed.</p>

<p>"Will you, dear? I have the very best of reasons for asking you."</p>

<p>"Could you tell me the reasons, Jim?" she asked, still dazed.</p>

<p>"I had rather not&mdash;if you don't mind. Will you trust me when
I say it is better for us to marry quietly and at once?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him dumbly, the scarlet slowly fading from brow
and cheek.</p>

<p>"Do you trust me?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I trust you."</p>

<p>"Will you marry me, then, as soon as I can arrange for it?"</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"Will you?" he urged.</p>

<p>"Jim&mdash;darling&mdash;I wanted to be equipped &mdash;I wanted to have
some pretty things, in order to&mdash;to be at my very best&mdash;for you.
A girl is a bride only once in her life; a man remembers her as
she came to him first."</p>

<p>"Dearest, as I saw you first, so I will always think of you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jim! In that black gown and cuffs and collar!"</p>

<p>"You don't understand men, dear. No coronation robe ever could
compete with that dress in my affections. You always are perfect;
I never saw you when you weren't bewitching&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But, dear, there are other things&#11834;"</p>

<p>"We'll buy them together!"</p>

<p>"Jim, <em>must</em> we do it this way? I don't mean that I wished
for any ostentation&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I did! I would have wished for a ceremony suited to your beauty
and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, no! I didn't expect&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But I did&mdash;damn it!" he said between his teeth. "I wished it;
I expected it. Don't you think I know what a girl ought to have?
Indeed I do, Jacqueline. And in New York town another century
will never see a bride to compare with you! But, my darling, I
cannot risk it!"</p>

<p>"Risk it?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me any more."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;will you do it&mdash;for my sake?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was a silence between them; he lighted a cigarette, turned
coolly around, and glanced across the room. Elena instantly averted
her gaze. Mrs. Hammerton sustained his pleasant inspection with
an unchanging stare almost insolent.</p>

<p>After a moment he smiled at her. It was a mistake to do it.</p>

<p>After luncheon, Elena Clydesdale found an opportunity for a word
with him.</p>

<p>"Will you remember that you have an engagement to-night?" she
said in a guarded voice.</p>

<p>"I shall break it," he replied.</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"This is going to end here and now! Your business is with your
husband. He's a decent fellow; he's devoted to you. I won't even
discuss it with you. Break with him if you want to, but don't
count on me!"</p>

<p>"I can't break with him unless I can count on you. Are you going
to lie to me, Jim?"</p>

<p>"You can call it what you like. But if you break with him it
will end our friendship."</p>

<p>"I tell you I've <em>got</em> to break with him. I've got to
do it now&mdash;at once!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because I've got to. I can't go on fencing with him."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>She crimsoned and set her little white teeth.</p>

<p>"I've got to leave him or be what &mdash;I won't be!"</p>

<p>"Then break with him," he said contemptuously, "and give a decent
man another chance in life!"</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;unless you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Good God! I'd sooner cut my throat. My sympathy is for your
husband. You're convicting yourself, I tell you! I've always had
a dim idea that he was all right. Now I know it&mdash;and my obligations
to you are ended."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;you leave me&mdash;to him? Answer me, Jim. You refuse to stand
between me and my&mdash;my degradation? Is that what you mean to do?
Knowing I have no other means of escaping it except through you&mdash;except
by defying the world with you!"</p>

<p>She broke off with a sob.</p>

<p>"Elena," he said, "your one salvation in this world is to have
children! It will mean happiness and honour for you both&mdash;mutual
respect, and, if not romantic love, at least a cordial understanding
and mutual toleration. If you have such a chance, don't throw
it away. Your husband is a slow, intelligent, kind, and patient
man, who has borne much from you because he is honestly in love
with you. Don't mistake his consideration for weakness, his patience
for acquiescence. What kindness you have pretended to show him
recently has given him courage. He is trying to make good because
he believes that he can win you. This is clear reason; it is logic,
Elena."</p>

<p>She turned on him in a flash of tears and exasperation.</p>

<p>"Logic! Do you think a woman wants that?" she stammered. "Do
you think a woman arrives at any conclusion through the kind of
reasoning that satisfies men? What difference does what you say
make to me, when I hate <em>him</em> and I love <em>you</em>?
How does your logic help me to escape what is&mdash;is abhorrent to
me! Do you suppose your reasoning makes it more endurable? Oh,
Jim! For heaven's sake don't leave me to that&mdash;that man! Let me
come here this evening after he has gone, and try to explain to
you how I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You won't!"</p>

<p>"No. I am going to town with Mrs. Hammerton and Miss Nevers on
the evening train. And some day I am going to marry Miss Nevers."</p>
