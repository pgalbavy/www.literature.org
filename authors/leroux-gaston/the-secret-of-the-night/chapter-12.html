<p>Koupriane jumped into his carriage and hurried toward St. Petersburg.
On the way he spoke to three agents who only he knew were posted
in the neighborhood of Eliaguine. They told him the route Rouletabille
had taken. The reporter had certainly returned into the city.
He hurried toward Troitski Bridge. There, at the corner of the
Naberjnaia, Koupriane saw the reporter in a hired conveyance.
Rouletabille was pounding his coachman in the back, Russian fashion,
to make him go faster, and was calling with all his strength one
of the few words he had had time to learn, "Naleva, naleva" (to
the left). The driver was forced to understand at last, for there
was no other way to turn than to the left. If he had turned to
the right (naprava) he would have driven into the river. The conveyance
clattered over the pointed flints of a neighborhood that led to
a little street, Aptiekarski-Pereoulok, at the corner of the Katharine
canal. This "alley of the pharmacists" as a matter of fact contained
no pharmacists, but there was a curious sign of a herbarium, where
Rouletabille made the driver stop. As the carriage rolled under
the arch Rouletabille recognized Koupriane. He did not wait, but
cried to him, "Ah, here you are. All right; follow me." He still
had the flask and the glasses in his hands. Koupriane couldn’t
help noticing how strange he looked. He passed through a court
with him, and into a squalid shop.</p>

<p>"What," said Koupriane, "do you know Pere Alexis?"</p>

<p>They were in the midst of a curious litter. Clusters of dried
herbs hung from the ceiling, and all among them were clumps of
old boots, shriveled skins, battered pans, scrap-iron, sheep-skins,
useless touloupes, and on the floor musty old clothes, moth-eaten
furs, and sheep-skin coats that even a moujik of the swamps would
not have deigned to wear. Here and there were old teeth, ragged
finery, dilapidated hats, and jars of strange herbs ranged upon
some rickety shelving. Between the set of scales on the counter
and a heap of little blocks of wood used for figuring the accounts
of this singular business were ungilded ikons, oxidized silver
crosses, and Byzantine pictures representing scenes from the Old
and New Testaments. Jars of alcohol with what seemed to be the
skeletons of frogs swimming in them filled what space was left.
In a corner of this large, murky room, under the vault of mossed
stone, a small altar stood and the light burned in a hanging glass
of oil before the holy images. A man was praying before the altar.
He wore the costume of old Russia, the caftan of green cloth,
buttoned at the shoulder and tucked in at the waist by a narrow
belt. He had a bushy beard and his hair fell to his shoulders.
When he had finished his prayer he rose, perceived Rouletabille
and came over to take his hand. He spoke French to the reporter:</p>

<p>"Well, here you are again, lad. Do you bring poison again to-day?
This will end by being found out, and the police..."</p>

<p>Just then he discerned Koupriane’s form in the shadow, drew close
to make out who it was, and fell to his knees as he saw who it
was. Rouletabille tried to raise him, but he insisted on prostrating
himself. He was sure the Prefect of Police had come to his house
to hang him. Finally he was reassured by Rouletabille’s positive
assertions and the great chief’s robust laugh. The Prefect wished
to know how the young man came to be acquainted with the "alchemist"
of the police. Rouletabille told him in a few words.</p>

<p>Maitre Alexis, in his youth, went to France afoot, to study pharmacy,
because of his enthusiasm for chemistry. But he always remained
countrified, very much a Russian peasant, a semi-Oriental bear,
and did not achieve his degree. He took some certificates, but
the examinations were too much for him. For fifty years he lived
miserably as a pharmacist’s assistant in the back of a disreputable
shop in the Notre Dame quarter. The proprietor of the place was
implicated in the famous affair of the gold ingots, which started
Rouletabille’s reputation, and was arrested along with his assistant,
Alexis. It was Rouletabille who proved, clear as day, that poor
Alexis was innocent, and that he had never been cognizant of his
master’s evil ways, being absorbed in the depths of his laboratory
in trying to work out a naive alchemy which fascinated him, though
the world of chemistry had passed it by centuries ago. At the
trial Alexis was acquitted, but found himself in the street. He
shed what tears remained in his body upon the neck of the reporter,
assuring him of paradise if he got him back to his own country,
because he desired only the one thing more of life, that he might
see his birth-land before he died. Rouletabille advanced the necessary
means and sent him to St. Petersburg. There he was picked up at
the end of two days by the police, in a petty gambling-game, and
thrown into prison, where he promptly had a chance to show his
talents. He cured some of his companions in misery, and even some
of the guards. A guard who had an injured leg, whose healing he
had despaired of, was cured by Alexis. Then there was found to
be no actual charge against him. They set him free and, moreover,
they interested themselves in him. They found meager employment
for him in the Stchoukine-dvor, an immense popular bazaar. He
accumulated a few roubles and installed himself on his own account
at the back of a court in the Aptiekarski-Pereoulok, where he
gradually piled up a heap of old odds and ends that no one wanted
even in the Stchoukine-dvor. But he was happy, because behind
his shop he had installed a little laboratory where he continued
for his pleasure his experiments in alchemy and his study of plants.
He still proposed to write a book that he had already spoken of
in France to Rouletabille, to prove the truth of "Empiric Treatment
of Medicinal Herbs, the Science of Alchemy, and the Ancient Experiments
in Sorcery." Between times he continued to cure anyone who applied
to him, and the police in particular. The police guards protected
him and used him. He had splendid plasters for them after "the
scandal," as they called the October riots. So when the doctors
of the quarter tried to prosecute him for illegal practice, a
deputation of police-guards went to Koupriane, who took the responsibility
and discontinued proceedings against him. They regarded him as
under protection of the saints, and Alexis soon came to be regarded
himself as something of a holy man. He never failed every Christmas
and Easter to send his finest images to Rouletabille, wishing
him all prosperity and saying that if ever he came to St. Petersburg
he should be happy to receive him at Aptiekarski-Pereoulok, where
he was established in honest labor. Pere Alexis, like all the
true saints, was a modest man.</p>

<p>When Alexis had recovered a little from his emotion Rouletabille
said to him:</p>

<p>"Pere Alexis, I do bring you poison again, but you have nothing
to fear, for His Excellency the Chief of Police is with me. Here
is what we want you to do. You must tell us what poison these
four glasses have held, and what poison is still in this flask
and this little phial."</p>

<p>"What is that little phial?" demanded Koupriane, as he saw Rouletabille
pull a small, stoppered bottle out of his pocket.</p>

<p>The reporter replied, "I have put into this bottle the vodka
that was poured into Natacha’s glass and mine and that we barely
touched."</p>

<p>"Someone has tried to poison you!" exclaimed Pere Alexis.</p>

<p>"No, not me," replied Rouletabille, in bored fashion. "Don’t
think about that. Simply do what I tell you. Then analyze these
two napkins, as well."</p>

<p>And he drew from his coat two soiled napkins.</p>

<p>"Well," said Koupriane, "you have thought of everything."</p>

<p>"They are the napkins the general and his wife used."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I understand that," said the Chief of Police.</p>

<p>"And you, Alexis, do you understand?" asked the reporter. "When
can we have the result of your analysis?</p>

<p>"In an hour, at the latest."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Koupriane. "Now I need not tell you to hold
your tongue. I am going to leave one of my men here. You will
write us a note that you will seal, and he will bring it to head-quarters.
Sure you understand? In an hour?"</p>

<p>"In an hour, Excellency."</p>

<p>They went out, and Alexis followed them, bowing to the floor.
Koupriane had Rouletabille get into his carriage. The young man
did as he was told. One would have said he did not know where
he was or what he did. He made no reply to the chief’s questions.</p>

<p>"This Pere Alexander," resumed Koupriane, "is a character, really
quite a figure. And a bit of a schemer, I should say. He has seen
how Father John of Cronstadt succeeded, and he says to himself,
‘Since the sailors had their Father John of Cronstadt, why shouldn’t
the police-guard have their Father Alexis of Aptiekarski-Pereoulok?’"</p>

<p>But Rouletabille did not reply at all, and Koupriane wound up
by demanding what was the matter with him.</p>

<p>"The matter is," replied Rouletabille, unable longer to conceal
his anguish, "that the poison continues."</p>

<p>"Does that astonish you?" returned Koupriane. "It doesn’t me."</p>

<p>Rouletabille looked at him and shook his head. His lips trembled
as he said, "I know what you think. It is abominable. But the
thing I have done certainly is more abominable still."</p>

<p>"What have you done, then, Monsieur Rouletabille?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have caused the death of an innocent man."</p>

<p>"So long as you aren’t sure of it, you would better not fret
about it, my dear friend."</p>

<p>"It is enough that the doubt has arisen," said the reporter,
"almost to kill me;" and he heaved so gloomy a sigh that the excellent
Monsieur Koupriane felt pity for the lad. He tapped him on the
knee.</p>

<p>"Come, come, young man, you ought to know one thing by this time&mdash;‘you
can’t make omelettes without breaking eggs,’ as they say, I think,
in Paris."</p>

<p>Rouletabille turned away from him with horror in his heart. If
there should be another, someone besides Michael! If it was another
hand than his that appeared to Matrena and him in the mysterious
night! If Michael Nikolaievitch had been innocent! Well, he would
kill himself, that was all. And those horrible words that he had
exchanged with Natacha rose in his memory, singing in his ears
as though they would deafen him.</p>

<p>"Do you doubt still?" he had asked her, "that Michael tried to
poison your father?"</p>

<p>And Natacha had replied, "I wish to believe it! I wish to believe
it, for your sake, my poor boy." And then he recalled her other
words, still more frightful now! "Couldn’t someone have tried
to poison my father and not have come by the window?" He had faced
such a hypothesis with assurance then&mdash;but now, now that the poison
continued, continued within the house, where he believed himself
so fully aware of all people and things&mdash;continued now that Michael
Nikolaievitch was dead&mdash;ah, where did it come from, this poison?&mdash;and
what was it? Pere Alexis would hurry his analysis if he had any
regard for poor Rouletabille.</p>

<p>For Rouletabille to doubt, and in an affair where already there
was one man dead through his agency, was torment worse than death.</p>

<p>When they arrived at police-headquarters, Rouletabille jumped
from Koupriane’s carriage and without saying a word hailed an
empty isvotchick that was passing. He had himself driven back
to Pere Alexis. His doubt mastered his will; he could not bear
to wait away. Under the arch of Aptiekarski-Pereoulok he saw once
more the man Koupriane had placed there with the order to bring
him Alexis’s message. The man looked at him in astonishment. Rouletabille
crossed the court and entered the dingy old room once more. Pere
Alexis was not there, naturally, engaged as he was in his laboratory.
But a person whom he did not recognize at first sight attracted
the reporter’s attention. In the half-light of the shop a melancholy
shadow leaned over the ikons on the counter. It was only when
he straightened up, with a deep sigh, and a little light, deflected
and yellow from passing through window-panes that had known no
touch of cleaning since they were placed there, fell faintly on
the face, that Rouletabille ascertained he was face to face with
Boris Mourazoff. It was indeed he, the erstwhile brilliant officer
whose elegance and charm the reporter had admired as he saw him
at beautiful Natacha’s feet in the datcha at Eliaguine. Now, no
more in uniform, he had thrown over his bowed shoulders a wretched
coat, whose sleeves swayed listlessly at his sides, in accord
with his mood of languid desperation, a felt hat with the rim
turned down hid a little the misery in his face in these few days,
these not-many hours, how he was changed! But, even as he was,
he still concerned Rouletabille. What was he doing there? Was
he not going to go away, perhaps? He had picked up an ikon from
the counter and carried it over to the window to examine its oxidized
silver, giving such close attention to it that the reporter hoped
he might reach the door of the laboratory without being noticed.
He already had his hand on the knob of that door, which was behind
the counter, when he heard his name called.</p>

<p>"It is you, Monsieur Rouletabille," said the low, sad voice of
Boris. "What has brought you here, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, well, Monsieur Boris Mourazoff, unless I’m mistaken? I
certainly didn’t expect to find you here in Pere Alexis’s place."</p>

<p>"Why not, Monsieur Rouletabille? One can find anything here in
Pere Alexis’s stock. See; here are two old ikons in wood, carved
with sculptures, which came direct from Athos, and can’t be equaled,
I assure you, either at Gastini-Dvor nor even at Stchoukine-Dvor."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that is possible," said Rouletabille, impatiently.
"Are you an amateur of such things?" he added, in order to say
something.</p>

<p>"Oh, like anybody else. But I was going to tell you, Monsieur
Rouletabille, I have resigned my commission. I have resolved to
retire from the world; I am going on a long voyage." (Rouletabille
thought: ‘Why not have gone at once?’) "And before going, I have
come here to supply myself with some little gifts to send those
of my friends I particularly care for, although now, my dear Monsieur
Rouletabille, I don’t care much for anything."</p>

<p>"You look desolate enough, monsieur."</p>

<p>Boris sighed like a child.</p>

<p>"How could it be otherwise?" he said. "I loved and believed myself
beloved. But it proved to be&mdash;nothing, alas!"</p>

<p>"Sometimes one only imagines things," said Rouletabille, keeping
his hand on the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the other, growing more and more melancholy.
"So a man suffers. He is his own tormentor; he himself makes the
wheel on which, like his own executioner, he binds himself."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary, monsieur; it is not necessary," counseled
the reporter.</p>

<p>"Listen," implored Boris in a voice that showed tears were not
far away. "You are still a child, but still you can see things.
Do you believe Natacha loves me?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it, Monsieur Boris; I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it, too. But I don’t know what to think now. She
has let me go, without trying to detain me, without a word of
hope."</p>

<p>"And where are you going like that?"</p>

<p>"I am returning to the Orel country, where I first saw her."</p>

<p>"That is good, very good, Monsieur Boris. At least there you
are sure to see her again. She goes there every year with her
parents for a few weeks. It is a detail you haven’t overlooked,
doubtless."</p>

<p>"Certainly I haven’t. I will tell you that that prospect decided
my place of retreat."</p>

<p>"See!"</p>

<p>"God gives me nothing, but He opens His treasures, and each takes
what he can."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; and Mademoiselle Natacha, does she know it is to Orel
you have decided to retire?"</p>

<p>"I have no reason for concealing it from her, Monsieur Rouletabille."</p>

<p>"So far so good. You needn’t feel so desolate, my dear Monsieur
Boris. All is not lost. I will say even that I see a future for
you full of hope."</p>

<p>"Ah, if you are able to say that truthfully, I am happy indeed
to have met you. I will never forget this rope you have flung
me when all the waters seemed closing over my head. ‘What do you
advise, then?"</p>

<p>"I advise you to go to Orel, monsieur, and as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"Very well. You must have reasons for saying that. I obey you,
monsieur, and go."</p>

<p>As Boris started towards the entrance-arch, Rouletabille slipped
into the laboratory. Old Alexis was bent over his retorts. A wretched
lamp barely lighted his obscure work. He turned at the noise the
reporter made.</p>

<p>"Ah!-you, lad!"</p>

<p>"‘Well?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing so quick. Still, I have already analyzed the two
napkins, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes? The stains? Tell me, for the love of God!"</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, it is arsenate of soda again."</p>

<p>Rouletabille, stricken to the heart, uttered a low cry and everything
seemed to dance around him. Pere Alexis in the midst of all the
strange laboratory instruments seemed Satan himself, and he repulsed
the kindly arms stretched forth to sustain him; in the gloom,
where danced here and there the little blue flames from the crucibles,
lively as flickering tongues, he believed he saw Michael Nikolaievitch’s
ghost come to cry, "The arsenate of soda continues, and I am dead."
He fell against the door, which swung open, and he rolled as far
as the counter, and struck his face against it. The shock, that
might well have been fatal, brought him out of his intense nightmare
and made him instantly himself again. He rose, jumped over the
heap of boots and fol-de-rols, and leaped to the court. There
Boris grabbed him by his coat. Rouletabille turned, furious:</p>

<p>"What do you want? You haven’t started for the Orel yet?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I am going, but I will be very grateful if you will
take these things yourself to&mdash;to Natacha." He showed him, still
with despairing mien, the two ikons from Mount Athos, and Rouletabille
took them from him, thrust them in his pocket, and hurried on,
crying, "I understand."</p>

<p>Outside, Rouletabille tried to get hold of himself, to recover
his coolness a little. Was it possible that he had made a mortal
error? Alas, alas, how could he doubt it now! The arsenate of
soda continued. He made a superhuman effort to ward off the horror
of that, even momentarily&mdash;the death of innocent Michael Nikolaievitch&mdash;and
to think of nothing except the immediate consequences, which must
be carefully considered if he wished to avoid some new catastrophe.
Ah, the assassin was not discouraged. And that time, what a piece
of work he had tried! What a hecatomb if he had succeeded! The
general, Matrena Petrovna, Natacha and Rouletabille himself (who
almost regretted, so far as he was concerned, that it had not
succeeded)&mdash;and Koupriane! Koupriane, who should have been there
for luncheon. What a bag for the Nihilists! That was it, that
was it. Rouletabille understood now why they had not hesitated
to poison everybody at once: Koupriane was among them.</p>

<p>Michael Nikolaievitch would have been avenged!</p>

<p>The attempt had failed this time, but what might they not expect
now! From the moment he believed Michael Nikolaievitch no longer
guilty, as he had imagined, Rouletabille fell into a bottomless
abyss.</p>

<p>Where should he go? After a few moments he made the circuit of
the Rotunda, which serves as the market for this quarter and is
the finest ornament of Aptiekarski-Pereoulok. He made the circuit
without knowing it, without stopping for anything, without seeing
or understanding anything. As a broken-winded horse makes its
way in the treadmill, so he walked around with the thought that
he also was lost in a treadmill that led him nowhere. Rouletabille
was no longer Rouletabille.</p>
