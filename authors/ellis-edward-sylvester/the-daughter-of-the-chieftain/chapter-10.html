<p>Anyone who is used to the woods knows how apt he is to wander
in a circle unless he keeps his wits about him. There have been
many causes named for this curious fact, and the one that strikes
me as the most reasonable is that we are all either right or left
handed. It is rare that you meet a person who is ambidextrous,&mdash;that
is, who uses both hands equally well. When, therefore, he sets
out to travel through the woods without any guide, he unconsciously
exerts his right or left limb, as the case may be, more than the
other, and this makes his course circular.</p>

<p>There are three "signboards" by which a hunter can keep trace
of the points of the compass when in the woods, without noticing
the sun, which of itself is often a great help. Three fourths
of the moss on trees grows on the north side; the heaviest boughs
on spruce trees are always on the south side, and the topmost
twig of every uninjured hemlock tree tips to the east.</p>

<p>Now, while these signs never err, you can see that it is almost
impossible to turn them to account at night.</p>

<p>Ben Ripley had led his friends in an irregular circle, and brought
them back to within a brief distance of the starting point. This
was the camp fire from which they fled in such panic before the
approach of the three red men.</p>

<p>The discovery filled him with dismay, and he darted out in the
darkness for the rocks where the others were sleeping. His first
intention was to rouse them and plunge into the woods again, but
a few minutes served to make him cooler and more collected in
mind.</p>

<p>The night was well spent, and a flight of that kind could not
do much for them. It might be all in vain. It would be trying
to the last degree. He decided not to disturb the sleepers.</p>

<p>By and by he persuaded himself that matters were not as bad as
they first appeared. Inasmuch as the fugitives had not returned
over their own trail, the Indians, in case they took it in the
morning, must make the same circuit, and thus be forced to go
just as far as if the flight had been in a direct line.</p>

<p>It was a mystery, however, what had become of the three warriors.
They could not be near the camp, or they would have appeared when
the lad returned to it. They had left, but who could say whither
they had gone?</p>

<p>While Ben was debating the painful question, a growing light
in the direction of the Delaware told him the night was ended
and the new day dawning.</p>

<p>The fourth day of July, the second anniversary of the Declaration
of Independence, had passed. He thought of it, standing alone
in the dismal forest with danger on every hand, and oppressed
by the great fear that those whom he loved more than his own life
must perish in that gloomy wilderness.</p>

<p>He did not dare, however, to give way to his sad thoughts. At
the first streakings of light among the trees, he roused his mother
and told her the alarming truth.</p>

<p>"I do not understand it," she replied, alluding to the absence
of the Iroquois; "it must be they are in the neighborhood."</p>

<p>The children were still sleeping quietly on the blanket. No food
or water was at command, and they could not take the time to look
for any. Indeed, the two elder ones felt no hunger or thirst.</p>

<p>The mother rose to her feet and looked around, her interest centring
on the rock and boulders, which stretched away to the rear further
than they could penetrate with the eye.</p>

<p>"I know they are skilful in following footprints," she remarked;
"but if we walk carefully over those rocks, I think they will
not be able to track us. We will try it."</p>

<p>The children were roused and quickly learned what was to be done,
the mother adding that the prayer which she was accustomed to
offer up every morning would be given when they reached a spot
where it was safe to do so.</p>

<p>For fully a hundred yards the four were able to make their way
without resting their feet on the ground. Then the boulders ended
as abruptly as they began.</p>

<p>All now kneeled on the granite floor and asked Heaven to deliver
them safely out of the dangers by which they were surrounded.</p>

<p>If the Indians chose to make search, after tracing the little
party to the stony place, they must eventually come upon the new
trail, where it began again on the ground; but unless they struck
it by accident, they must use a good deal of time in hunting for
it.</p>

<p>"Come on," called Ben in a low voice, but with a renewal of hope;
"we shall get somewhere one of these days."</p>

<p>To their surprise, not far from the rocks they came upon a faintly
marked path among the trees.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of that?" Ben asked, looking inquiringly
at his mother and Linna.</p>

<p>"Men don't do dat&mdash;wild beasts," replied the dusky child.</p>

<p>"She is right," added the mother; "the animals follow it to water;
let us do the same."</p>

<p>The haunting fear of the red men made the words between the fugitives
few, and all their movements guarded. They kept glancing to right
and left, in front and to the rear, Linna being probably the most
active. It was as if she inherited from her parents their surprising
woodcraft, and was now calling it into play for the benefit of
her friends.</p>

<p>Suddenly something flickered in the path ahead, and Ben stopped
short, those behind him doing the same.</p>

<p>Just in advance&mdash;less than fifty yards indeed&mdash;a beautiful fawn
had come to a halt. Its graceful head, with its soft brown eyes,
was lifted high, and it looked wonderingly at the people, as if
not knowing the meaning, and too innocent to feel fear. Ben drew
up his rifle, for it was a tempting chance for a delicious breakfast.
But almost instantly he lowered the weapon again.</p>

<p>The fawn was so trusting, so unsuspicious, that a feeling of
pity came to the young hunter. The animal suggested his own little
sister, for it was wandering through the unfriendly woods, with
none to protect it from cruel enemies.</p>

<p>"Go," whispered Ben; "I haven't the heart to harm you; I will
starve first."</p>

<p>"Remember the result of the shot yesterday," said his mother
warningly. "We are in too much peril to increase it."</p>

<p>The lad advanced along the path, and every one of the company
smiled at the fawn, when it stood motionless, staring until they
were almost to it. Then the timid creature turned nimbly and trotted
over the trail, its head so high that, as it turned it from side
to side, it saw every thing done by the strange beings following.</p>

<p>Had the situation been less serious, Ben would have had some
sport with the lovely creature, but he dared not give it much
attention. It continued trotting a short way, and then sprang
gracefully aside among the trees, leaving no scent on the leaves
by which the most highly trained hound could trace it.</p>

<p>A little way beyond they came upon the largest stream seen since
leaving the mountains east of the Susquehanna. It was a dozen
feet in width, quite deep, rapid, and clear.</p>

<p>"Here is enough drink for us all," said Ben, and they proceeded
to help themselves in the primitive fashion described elsewhere.</p>

<p>"That must contain fish," observed the mother; "but we are without
the means of catching them."</p>

<p>"Unless Linna will jump in and haul them out for us. But if we
are to continue our journey, we must find some way of getting
to the other side; it is too deep and wide to ford or jump."</p>

<p>"It must be narrower in other places."</p>

<p>"Oh! look mamma!"</p>

<p>It was Alice who first saw a terrifying sight. An immense black
bear, the largest any of the party had ever seen, swung from among
the trees and came to the water's edge on the other side.</p>

<p>He was so enormous that all started and recoiled a step, even
Linna uttering an exclamation in her own tongue. Ben grasped his
rifle, and held it ready to use the instant it became necessary.</p>

<p>But Bruin was in a gracious mood that morning. He looked at the
party with stupid curiosity, then reared on his hind legs, and
swung his beam-.like paws in an odd way.</p>

<p>"He is inviting us to come over and be hugged to death," laughed
Ben.</p>

<p>"He will come over and eat us all up," said Alice, clinging to
the dress of her mother.</p>

<p>"No," replied the parent, soothingly patting her head; "Ben won't
let him do that. Do not be frightened."</p>

<p>"Climb tree," suggested Linna; "not big tree, 'cause bear climb
dat too&mdash;climb little tree, den he can't climb it."</p>

<p>"You are right, but we will wait and see what he does. I don't
want to fire my gun unless I have to, and if he will let us alone
we won't hurt him. There! he is going to drink."</p>

<p>The huge creature bent his head down to the water and helped
himself. When he had had enough, he raised his snout and again
looked at the party, who were closely watching him.</p>

<p>This was the critical moment. If he meant to attack them, he
would plunge into the water and either swim or wade across. Ben
raised the hammer of his rifle and awaited his action.</p>

<p>Had Bruin been hungry, he would not have dallied so long; but
he did not seem to see anything specially tempting in the group,
and lumbered off among the trees.</p>

<p>"A lucky move for you." remarked Ben.</p>

<p>"And just as lucky for us," added the mother; "for though you
might have slain him, as I have no doubt you would, the report
of the gun must have brought more dangerous enemies to us."</p>

<p>"I would give a good deal to know what has become of them. It
begins to look as if they did not consider us worth bothering
with."</p>

<p>"I wish I could believe that, but I cannot. I think it more likely
that they know where we are, and are trifling with us, as a cat
does with a mouse."</p>

<p>"That makes me anxious to push on. We must find some place where
we can cross the stream. Let's go further up the bank."</p>

<p>He took the course named, leading away from the great bear with
which they had so narrowly escaped an encounter.</p>

<p>To their surprise, they had not far to go before the spot they
were seeking was found. The stream narrowed between some rocks,
so much that even Alice could spring across without wetting her
feet.</p>

<p>"I am afraid Linna can't leap it," remarked Ben with a smile.</p>

<p>"Me show you."</p>

<p>And, without recoiling a step, the nimble little one made a graceful
bound, which landed her several feet beyond the other margin.</p>

<p>"Well done!" said Ben; "I couldn't do much better myself. Now,
Alice, you are not going to let her beat you?"</p>

<p>Alice was timid at first, but with a good start she cleared the
space. She landed, however, so near the water that had not the
watchful Linna caught one of the hands thrown up to save herself,
she would have fallen back in the stream.</p>

<p>Mother and son imitated them, and all stood on the other side
of the obstruction without having suffered any inconvenience.</p>

<p>While they were congratulating themselves, a startling reminder
of their danger came in the near report of a rifle. It was from
the direction in which they had seen the bear, and in the stillness
of the woods all heard a snarling growl, which proved that the
beast had received his death wound.</p>

<p>"The Indians are there!" whispered the frightened Ben; "what
shall we do, mother?"</p>

<p>"What can we do?" she asked, helpless and at her wits' end for
the moment; "there seems to be no escaping them."</p>

<p>"Me go talk with them," was the amazing remark of the little
Delaware girl.</p>

<p>"You talk with them!" repeated Mrs. Ripley; "what can you do?"</p>

<p>"Don't know&mdash;me try."</p>

<p>And without waiting for permission, Linna started on a light
run toward the point whence came the report of the rifle that
gave Bruin his death wound. Mother and son looked in each other's
face in mute wonderment for a full minute after the departure
of the girl.</p>

<p>"She's a remarkable child," finally said the mother; "she has
done us more than one good turn, and, it may be, Heaven intends
to make use of her again, though I cannot see how."</p>

<p>"The Iroquois will recognise her as one of their own race. Perhaps
one or more of them belong to her tribe: they will know her as
the child of Omas, and may listen to her pleadings."</p>

<p>"Alas! they will give little heed to them; my heart misgives
me, son: I feel that the end is at hand."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, let us follow Linna, the Delaware, upon her strange
mission.</p>
