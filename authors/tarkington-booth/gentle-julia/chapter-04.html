<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Mrs. Dill, Noble's mother, talked of organizing a Young Men's
Mothers' Club against Julia, nevertheless she acknowledged that
in one solitary way Noble was being improved by the experience.
His two previous attacks of love (one at twelve, and the other
at eighteen) had been incomparably lighter, and the changes in
him, noted at home, merely a slight general irritability and a
lack of domestic punctuality due to too much punctuality elsewhere.
But, when his Julia Atwater trouble came, the very first symptom
he manifested was a strange new effort to become beautiful; his
mother even discovered that he sometimes worked with pumice stone
upon the cigarette stains on his fingers.</p>

<p>The most curious thing about his condition was that for a long
time he took it for granted that his family did not know what
was the matter with him; and this shows as nothing else could
the meekness and tact of the Dills; for, excluding bad cooks and
the dangerously insane, the persons most disturbing to the serenity
of households are young lovers. But the world has had to accommodate
itself to them because young lovers cannot possibly accommodate
themselves to the world. For the young lover there is no general
life of the species; for him the universe is a delicate blush
under a single bonnet. He has but an irritated perception of every
vital thing in nature except the vital thing under this bonnet;
all else is trivial intrusion. But whatever does concern the centrifugal
bonnet, whatever concerns it in the remotest&mdash;ah, <em>then</em>
he springs to life! So Noble Dill sat through a Sunday dinner
at home, seemingly drugged to a torpor, while the family talk
went on about him; but when his father, in the course of some
remarks upon politics, happened to mention the name of the county-treasurer,
Charles J. Patterson, Noble's startled attention to the conversation
was so conspicuous as to be disconcerting. Mrs. Dill signalled
with her head that comment should be omitted, and Mr. Dill became,
for the moment, one factor in a fairly clear example of telepathic
communication, for it is impossible to believe that his wife's
almost imperceptible gesture was what caused him to remember that
Charles J. Patterson was Julia Atwater's uncle.</p>

<p>That name, Charles J. Patterson, coming thus upon Noble's ear,
was like an unexpected shrine on the wayside where plods the fanatic
pilgrim; and yet Mr. Patterson was the most casual of Julia's
uncles-by-marriage: he neither had nor desired any effect upon
her destiny. To Noble he seemed a being ineffably privileged and
fateful, and something of the same quality invested the wooden
gateposts in front of Julia's house; invested everything that
had to do with her. What he felt about her father, that august
old danger, himself, was not only the uncalled-for affection inevitable
toward Julia's next of kin, but also a kind of horror due to the
irresponsible and awful power possessed by a sacred girl's parent.
Florence's offer of protection had not entirely reassured the
young lover, and, in sum, Noble loved Mr. Atwater, but often,
in his reveries, when he had rescued him from drowning or being
burned to death, he preferred to picture the peculiar old man's
injuries as ultimately fatal.</p>

<p>For the other Atwaters his feeling held less of apprehension,
more of tenderness; and whenever he saw one of them he became
deferential and a little short of breath. Thus, on a sunny afternoon,
having been home to lunch after his morning labour downtown, he
paused in passing young Herbert's place of residence and timidly
began a conversation with this glamoured nephew. It happened that
during the course of the morning Herbert had chosen a life career
for himself; he had decided to become a scientific specialist,
an entomologist; and he was now on his knees studying the manners
and customs of the bug inhabitants of the lawn before the house,
employing for his purpose a large magnifying lens, or "reading
glass." (His discovery of this implement in the attic, coincidentally
with his reading a recent "Sunday Supplement" article on bugs,
had led to his sudden choice of a vocation.)</p>

<p>"Did somebody&mdash;ah, have any of the family lost anything, Herbert?"
Noble asked in a gentle voice, speaking across the fence.</p>

<p>Herbert did not look up, nor did he relax the scientific frown
upon his brow. "No," he said. "They always <em>are</em> losin'
things, espesh'ly Aunt Julia, when she comes over here, or anywheres
else; but I wouldn't waste <em>my</em> time lookin' for any old
earrings or such. I got more important things to do on my hands."</p>

<p>"<em>Has</em> your Aunt Julia lost an earring, Herbert?"</p>

<p>"Her? Well, she nearly always <em>has</em> lost somep'n or other,
but that isn't bother'n' <em>me</em> any. I got better things
to do with my time." Herbert spoke without interrupting his occupation
or relaxing his forehead. "Nacher'l history is a <em>little</em>
more important to the inhabitants of our universe than a lot o'
worthless jew'lry, I guess," he continued; and his pride in discovering
that he could say things like this was so great that his frown
gave way temporarily to a look of pleased surprise, then came
back again to express an importance much increased. He rose, approached
the fence, and condescended to lean upon it. "I don't guess there's
one person in a thousand," he said, "that knows what they <em>ought</em>
to know about our inseck friends."</p>

<p>"No," Mr. Dill agreed readily. "I guess that's so. I guess you're
right about that, Herbert. When did your Aunt Julia lose the earring,
Herbert?"</p>

<p>"I d' know," said Herbert. "Now, you take my own father and mother:
What do they know? Well, mighty little. They may have had to learn
a little teeny bit about insecks when they were in school, but
whatever little it was they went and forgot it proba'ly long before
they were married. Well, that's no way. F'r instance, you take
a pinchin' bug: What do you suppose my father and mother know
about its position in the inseck world?"</p>

<p>"Well&#11834;" said Noble uneasily. "Well&#11834;" He coughed, and hastened
to add: "But as I was saying, if she lost her earring somewhere
in your yard, or&#11834;"</p>

<p>The scientific boy evidently did not follow this line of thought,
for he interrupted: "Why, they wouldn't know a thing about it,
and a pinchin' bug isn't one of the highest insecks at all. Ants
are way up compared to most pinchin' bugs. Ants are way up anyway.
Now, you take an ant&#11834;" He paused. "Well, everybody ought to
know a lot more'n they do about ants. It takes time, and you got
to study 'em the right way, and of course there's lots of people
wouldn't know how to do it. I'm goin' to get a book I been readin'
about. It's called 'The Ant.'"</p>

<p>For a moment Noble was confused; he followed his young friend's
discourse but hazily, and Herbert pronounced the word "ant" precisely
as he pronounced the word "aunt." The result was that Noble began
to say something rather dreamy concerning the book just mentioned,
but, realizing that he was being misunderstood, he changed his
murmur into a cough, and inquired:</p>

<p>"When was she over here, Herbert?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Your Aunt Julia."</p>

<p>"Yesterday evening," said Herbert. "Now, f'r instance, you take
a common lightning-bug&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Did she lose it, then?"</p>

<p>"Lose what?"</p>

<p>"Her earring."</p>

<p>"I d' know," said Herbert. "You take the common lightning-bug
or, as it's called in some countries, the firefly&#11834;"</p>

<p>He continued, quoting and misquoting the entomological authority
of the recent "Sunday Supplement"; but his friend on the other
side of the fence was inattentive to the lecture. Noble's mind
was occupied with a wonder; he had realized, though dimly, that
here was he, trying to make starry Julia the subject of a conversation
with a person who had the dear privilege of being closely related
to her&mdash;and preferred to talk about bugs.</p>

<p>Herbert talked at considerable length about lightning-bugs, but
as his voice happened rather precociously to be already in a state
of adolescent change, the sound was not soothing; yet Noble lingered.
Nephews were queer, but this one was Julia's, and he finally mentioned
her again, as incidental to lightning-bugs; whereupon the mere
hearer of sounds became instantly a listener to words.</p>

<p>"Well, and then I says," Herbert continued;&mdash;"I says: 'It's phosphorus,
Aunt Julia.' I guess there's hardly anybody in the world doesn't
know more than Aunt Julia, except about dresses and parasols and
every other useless thing under the sun. She says: 'My! I always
thought it was sulphur!' Said nobody ever <em>told</em> her it
wasn't sulphur! I asked her: I said: 'You mean to sit there and
tell me you don't know the difference?' And she says: 'I don't
care one way or the other,' she says. She said she just as soon
a lightning-bug made his light with sulphur as with phosphorus;
it didn't make any difference to her, she says, and they could
go ahead and make their light any way they wanted, <em>she</em>
wouldn't interfere! I had a whole hatful of 'em, and she told
me not to take 'em into their house, because grandpa hates insecks
as much as he does animals and violets, and she said they never
owned a microscope or a magnifying-glass in their lives, and wouldn't
let me hunt for one. All in the world she knows is how to sit
on the front porch and say: 'Oh you don't mean <em>that!</em>'
to somebody like Newland Sanders or that ole widower!"</p>

<p>"When?" Noble asked impulsively. "When did she say that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I d' know," said Herbert. "I expect she proba'ly says it
to somebody or other about every evening there is."</p>

<p>"She does?"</p>

<p>"Florence says so," Herbert informed him carelessly. "Florence
goes over to grandpa's after dark and sits on the ground up against
the porch and listens."</p>

<p>Noble first looked startled then uneasily reminiscent. "I don't
believe Florence ought to do that," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> wouldn't do it!" Herbert was emphatic.</p>

<p>"That's right, Herbert. I'm glad you wouldn't."</p>

<p>"No, sir," the manly boy declared. "You wouldn't never catch
<em>me</em> takin' my death o' cold sittin' on the damp grass
in the night air just to listen to a lot o' tooty-tooty about
'I've named a star for you,' and all such. You wouldn't catch
me&#11834;"</p>

<p>Noble partly concealed a sudden anguish. "Who?" he interrupted.
"Who did she say <em>that</em> to?"</p>

<p>"She didn't. They say it to her, and she says? 'Oh, you don't
mean that!' and of course then they haf to go on and say some
more. Florence says&#11834;" He checked himself. "Oh, I forgot! I
promised Florence I wouldn't tell anything about all this."</p>

<p>"It's safe," Noble assured him quickly. "I'm quite a friend of
Florence's and it's absolutely safe with me. I won't speak of
it to anybody, Herbert. Who was it told her he'd named a star
for her?"</p>

<p>"It was the way some ole poem began. Newland Sanders wrote it.
Florence found it under Aunt Julia's sofa-cushions and read it
all through, but <em>I</em> wouldn't wade through all that tooty-tooty
for a million dollars, and I told her to put it back before Aunt
Julia noticed. Well, about every day he writes her a fresh one,
and then in the evening he stays later than the rest, and reads
'em to her&mdash;and you ought to hear grandpa when <em>he</em> gets
to talkin' about it!"</p>

<p>"He's perfectly right," said Noble. "Perfectly! What does he
say when he talks about it, Herbert?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he says all this and that; and then he kind of mutters around,
and you can't tell just what all the words are exactly, so't he
can deny it if any o' the family accuses him of swearing or anything."
And Herbert added casually: "He was kind of goin' on like that
about you, night before last."</p>

<p>"About <em>me</em>! Why, what could he say about <em>me</em>?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all this and that."</p>

<p>"But what did he find to say?"</p>

<p>"Well, he heard her tellin' you how you oughtn't to smoke so
many cigarettes and all about how it was killin' you, and you
sayin' you guessed it wouldn't matter if you <em>did</em> die,
and Aunt Julia sayin' 'Oh, you don't mean that,' and all this
and such and so on, you know. He can hear anything on the porch
pretty good from the lib'ary; and Florence told me about that,
besides, because she was sittin' in the grass and all. She told
Great-Uncle Joe and Aunt Hattie about it, too."</p>

<p>"My heavens!" Noble gasped, as for the first time he realized
to what trumpeting publicity that seemingly hushed and moonlit
bower, sacred to Julia, had been given over. He gulped, flushed,
repeated "My heavens!" and then was able to add, with a feeble
suggestion of lightness: "I suppose your grandfather understood
it was just a sort of joke, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"No," said Herbert, and continued in a friendly way, for he was
flattered by Noble's interest in his remarks, and began to feel
a liking for him. "No. He said Aunt Julia only talked like that
because she couldn't think of anything else to say, and it was
wearin' him out. He said all the good it did was to make you smoke
more to make her think how reckless you were; but the worst part
of it was, he'd be the only one to suffer, because it blows all
through the house and he's got to sit in it. He said he just could
stand the smell of <em>some</em> cigarettes, but if you burned
any more o' yours on his porch he was goin' to ask your father
to raise your salary for collectin' real-estate rents, so't you'd
feel able to buy some real tobacco. He&#11834;"</p>

<p>But the flushed listener felt that he had heard as much as he
was called upon to bear; and he interrupted, in a voice almost
out of control, to say that he must be "getting on downtown."
His young friend, diverted from bugs, showed the greatest willingness
to continue the narrative indefinitely, evidently being in possession
of copious material; but Noble turned to depart. An afterthought
detained him. "Where was it she lost her earring?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Your Aunt Julia."</p>

<p>"Why, <em>I</em> didn't say she lost any earring," Herbert returned.
"I said she always <em>was</em> losin' 'em: I didn't say she did."</p>

<p>"Then you didn't mean&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No," said Herbert, "<em>I</em> haven't heard of her losin' anything
at all, lately." Here he added: "Well, grandpa kept goin' on about
you, and he told her-&mdash;Well, so long!" And gazed after the
departing Mr. Dill in some surprise at the abruptness of the latter's
leave-taking. Then, wondering how the back of Noble's neck could
have got itself so fiery sunburnt, Herbert returned to his researches
in the grass.</p>

<p>The peaceful street, shady and fragrant with summer, was so quiet
that the footfalls of the striding Noble were like an interruption
of coughing in a silent church. As he seethed adown the warm sidewalk
the soles of his shoes smote the pavement, for mentally he was
walking not upon cement but upon Mr. Atwater.</p>

<p>Unconsciously his pace presently became slower for a more concentrated
brooding upon this slanderous old man who took advantage of his
position to poison his daughter's mind against the only one of
her suitors who cared in the highest way. And upon this there
came an infinitesimal consolation in the midst of anguish, for
he thought of what Herbert had told him about Mr. Newland Sanders's
poems to Julia, and he had a strong conviction that one time or
another Mr. Atwater must have spoken even more disparagingly of
these poems and their author than he had of Orduma cigarettes
and their smoker. Perhaps the old man was not altogether vile.</p>

<p>This charitable moment passed. He recalled the little moonlit
drama on the embowered veranda, when Julia, in her voice of plucked
harp strings, told him that he smoked too much, and he had said
it didn't matter; nobody would care much if he died&mdash;and Julia
said gently that his mother would, and other people, too; he mustn't
talk so recklessly. Out of this the old eavesdropper had viciously
represented him to be a poser, not really reckless at all; had
insulted his cigarettes and his salary. Well, Noble would show
him! He had doubts about being able to show Mr. Atwater anything
important connected with the cigarettes or the salary, but he
<em>could</em> prove how reckless he was. With that, a vision
formed before him: he saw Julia and her father standing spellbound
at a crossing while a smiling youth stood directly between the
rails in the middle of the street and let a charging trolley-car
destroy him&mdash;not instantly, for he would live long enough to whisper,
as the stricken pair bent over him: "Now, Julia, which do you
believe: your father, or me?" And then with a slight, dying sneer:
"Well, Mr. Atwater, is <em>this</em> reckless enough to suit you?"</p>

<p>Town squirrels flitted along their high paths in the shade-tree
branches above the embittered young lover, and he noticed them
not at all, which was but little less than he noticed the elderly
human couple who observed him from a side-yard as he passed by.
Mr. and Mrs. Burgess had been happily married for fifty-three
years and four months. Mr. Burgess lay in a hammock between two
maple trees, and was soothingly swung by means of a string connecting
the hammock and the rocking-chair in which sat Mrs Burgess, acting
as a mild motor for both the chair and the hammock. "That's Noble
Dill walking along the sidewalk," Mrs. Burgess said, interpreting
for her husband's failing eyes. "I bowed to him, but he hardly
seemed to see us and just barely lifted his hat. He needn't be
cross with <em>us</em> because some other young man's probably
taking Julia Atwater out driving!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he need!" Mr. Burgess declared. "A boy in his condition
needs to be cross with everything. Sometimes they get so cross
they go and drink liquor. Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>She laughed. "I remember once!" she assented, and laughed again.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a terrible time of life," her husband went on. "Poets
and suchlike always take on about young love as if it were a charming
and romantic experience, but really it's just a series of mortifications.
The young lover is always wanting to do something dashing and
romantic and Sir Walter Raleigh-like, but in ordinary times about
the wildest thing he can do, if he can afford it, is to learn
to run a Ford. And he can't stand a word of criticism; he can't
stand being made the least little bit of fun of; and yet all the
while his state of mind lays him particularly open to all the
things he can't stand. He can't stand anything, and he has to
stand everything. Why, it's a <em>horrible</em> time of life,
mamma!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," she assented placidly. "I'm glad we don't have
to go through it again, Freddie; though you're only eighty-two,
and with a girl like Julia Atwater around nobody ought to be sure."</p>
