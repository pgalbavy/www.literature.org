<p>IT will be recalled that during these incidents Monteith Sterry
and Fred Whitney were sitting at the front of the long, low building,
which was the home of the latter, discussing the incidents of
the last day or two, as well as the matter of Whitney removing,
with his family, to the East, in order to prevent any addition
to the affliction they had just suffered.</p>

<p>Besides this, Whitney had turned on his young friend, and impressed
upon him that he, too, was incurring unjustifiable risk by remaining
in Wyoming during the inflamed state of public feeling. There
was much less excuse in the case of Sterry than of his host. He
ought to be at home prosecuting the study of his profession, as
his parents wished him to do. His health was fully restored, and
it cannot be denied that he was wasting his precious days. He
was fond of his father, mother, brothers and sisters, and it would
grieve them beyond expression if he should uselessly sacrifice
himself.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "I cannot deny the truth of what you say,
Fred. I ought to leave this part of the country."</p>

<p>"Of course; you're not needed; your future has been mapped for
you, and it is hard to make up lost time."</p>

<p>"We found that out at the high school," returned Mont, with a
light laugh; "but the pearl of great price, in a worldly sense,
is good health, and I have been repaid in securing it."</p>

<p>"And having secured it, it remains &mdash;Mont," added his companion
abruptly, but without the slightest change of tone, "don't stop
to ask me why, but step quickly through the door and into the
house, and keep out of sight for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Sterry, obeying without an instant's hesitation.</p>

<p>The prompt, unquestioning compliance with the request of Fred
Whitney showed that Monteith Sterry understood the reason that
it was made of him.</p>

<p>The truth was, that during the last few minutes the young men
were talking in front of the house, each descried something suspicious
on the broad plain. They instinctively lowered their voices, and
though neither made reference to it, both gave more attention
to it than to their own words.</p>

<p>They heard nothing of the tramp of horses, but saw the shadowy
figures of several men hovering on what may be termed the line
of invisibility. Sometimes they were distinguished quite clearly,
and then seemed to vanish; but the youths could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>A number of persons were out there, not mounted, but on foot,
and moving about, without approaching any closer, for the space
of several minutes. It looked as if they were reconnoitering the
house from a distance and debating the best manner of procedure.</p>

<p>The suspicions of the friends were the same. They were rustlers
looking for the inspector.</p>

<p>Mont Sterry would have preferred to stay where he was and have
it out with them, but the circumstances were so peculiar that
he could not refuse to do as his comrade requested.</p>

<p>The cause of Whitney's wish was the abrupt increasing distinctness
of the figures, proof that they had reached a decision and were
approaching the house.</p>

<p>They speedily came into plain sight, four men, in the garb of
cowmen, and they were rustlers beyond question.</p>

<p>Conscious that they were seen, they now advanced directly, as
if coming from a distance, though the fact that they were on foot
showed that such was not the case.</p>

<p>With feelings which it would be hard to describe, Fred Whitney
recognized the first as Larch Cadmus, wearing the same whiskers
as before. Had he been thoughtful enough to disguise his voice
the young man would not have suspected his identity.</p>

<p>The moon had worked around into that quarter of the heavens that
its light shone on the figure of Fred, who rose to his feet, as
was his custom, and advanced a few paces to meet the newcomers.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" he said. "How happens it that you are afoot at
this time of night?"</p>

<p>"Our horses ain't fur off," replied Cadmus; "the rest of the
boys didn't think it worth while to trouble you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by troubling me?" asked Fred, though he understood
the meaning.</p>

<p>"We're on an unpleasant errand," continued Cadmus, acting as
the spokesman of the party, the others remaining in the background
and maintaining silence.</p>

<p>"Shall I bring chairs for you? It is so unusually mild to-night
that I am sitting out doors from choice, and I do not wish to
disturb my mother and sister, who retired some time ago."</p>

<p>"No, we'll stand," was the curt response. "Whitney, as I suppose
it is, are you accustomed to sit out here alone?"</p>

<p>"Not when I can have company."</p>

<p>"Were you alone before we came up?"</p>

<p>"When you were here earlier in the evening, as you saw for yourself,
I had my sister and a friend."</p>

<p>"Exactly; who was that friend?"</p>

<p>"Mont Sterry, the gentleman who is on a little tour through some
parts of Wyoming and Montana to try to help make you fellows behave
yourselves."</p>

<p>"Yes; wal, we're looking for him."</p>

<p>"Why do you come here?"</p>

<p>"Because he spends a good deal of his time here; he seems to
be interested in Miss Whitney."</p>

<p>"Well, if he is, that is no business of yours," retorted Fred,
angered by the reference to his sister.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but it would be well for you to keep a civil tongue
in your head, Fred Whitney; we're not in a pleasant mood to-night,
for we've had trouble."</p>

<p>"It matters not to me what trouble you've had; you have no right
to name any member of my family. They are in affliction; my father
was shot down by your gang yesterday, and, though we made several
of you fellows bite the dust, the whole of them weren't worth
his little finger."</p>

<p>"We'll let them matters drop; I told you we're looking for Mont
Sterry, and we're going to have him."</p>

<p>"And I ask you again, why do you come here after him? I don't
deny that he was with me, but he left fully two hours ago."</p>

<p>"We know that; he gave us the slip, but we believe he came back."</p>

<p>"And I ask what reason you have for such belief; why did he bid
us good-by and ride away? I know that he had not the slightest
intention of returning for several days," said Fred, sticking
to the technical truth.</p>

<p>"We don't care what his intention was, he did come back."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"He was sitting in that chair alongside of you less than ten
minutes ago; you were smoking and talking, though you didn't speak
loud enough for us to catch your words."</p>

<p>"Where is the proof, Larch Cadmus, of what you say?"</p>

<p>Without noticing this penetration of his disguise, the rustler
turned and spoke to the nearest of his companions:</p>

<p>"Spark Holly, how was it?"</p>

<p>"I seen 'em both and heard 'em talking," was the prompt response
of the individual appealed to.</p>

<p>"Are your eyes better than the others'?" asked Fred.</p>

<p>"They don't have to be," replied Cadmus, speaking for him. "While
we stayed in front of the house, Spark stole round to the rear,
where none of your family seen him. He got to the corner and had
a good look at both of you."</p>

<p>"Does he know Sterry?" inquired Fred, purposely raising his voice,
that his friend, standing a few feet away within the house, should
not miss a word.</p>

<p>"He don't know him, but I do, and the description Spark gives
fits the man we're after to a T. We want him."</p>

<p>"But the notice you gave Sterry allowed him twenty-four hours'
grace. Why do you ask for him now?"</p>

<p>"Them was my sentiments, but when I joined the party under Inman,
a little while ago, he told me the boys had reconsidered that
matter, and decided that after what Sterry has done, and tried
to do, I hadn't any right to make the promise."</p>

<p>"That may be their decision, but it cannot affect yours; you
are bound by the pledge you made in writing to him."</p>

<p>Larch Cadmus, like his companions, was growing impatient. He
said:</p>

<p>"I haven't come here to argue the matter with you; I've come
after my man, and am going to have him."</p>

<p>"And I repeat what I said: he left more than two hours ago, and
you have no business to come here."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me he isn't in the house?" demanded Cadmus,
with rising temper.</p>

<p>"I refuse to answer, but I do say that neither you nor any of
your gang shall enter my home, where are my mother and sister,
their hearts stricken by your murderous doings of yesterday, except
over my dead body."</p>

<p>"We don't like to disturb the ladies," said Cadmus, "but we mean
business; we have promised the boys to bring back that fellow;
but I'll make a proposition."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"If you will say that Mont Sterry is not in there, we'll go away
without disturbing any one; we'll take your word."</p>

<p>"I recognize no right of yours to question me," was the scornful
reply of Fred Whitney.</p>

<p>"Boys," said Cadmus, turning again to his companions, "that's
only another way of owning up that the coward is hiding here,
afraid to meet us; he's our game."</p>
