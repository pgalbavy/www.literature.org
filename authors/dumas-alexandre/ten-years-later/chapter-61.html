<P>At two o'clock the next day fifty thousand spectators had
taken their position upon the Place, around the two gibbets
which had been elevated between the Quai de la Greve and the
Quai Pelletier; one close to the other, with their backs to
the embankment of the river. In the morning also, all the
sworn criers of the good city of Paris had traversed the
quarters of the city, particularly the halles and the
faubourgs, announcing with their hoarse and indefatigable
voices, the great justice done by the king upon two
speculators, two thieves, devourers of the people. And these
people, whose interests were so warmly looked after, in
order not to fail in respect for their king quitted shops,
stalls, and ateliers to go and evince a little gratitude to
Louis XIV., absolutely like invited guests, who feared to
commit an impoliteness in not repairing to the house of him
who had invited them. According to the tenor of the
sentence, which the criers read aloud and incorrectly, two
farmers of the revenues, monopolists of money, dilapidators
of the royal provisions, extortioners, and forgers, were
about to undergo capital punishment on the Place de Greve,
with their names blazoned over their heads, according to
their sentence. As to those names, the sentence made no
mention of them. The curiosity of the Parisians was at its
height, and, as we have said, an immense crowd waited with
feverish impatience the hour fixed for the execution. The
news had already spread that the prisoners, transferred to
the Chateau of Vincennes, would be conducted from that
prison to the Place de Greve. Consequently, the faubourg and
the Rue Saint Antoine were crowded, for the population of
Paris in those days of great executions was divided into two
categories: those who came to see the condemned pass  - 
these were of timid and mild hearts, but philosophically
curious  -  and those who wished to see the condemned die  - 
these had hearts that hungered for sensation. On this day M.
d'Artagnan received his last instructions from the king, and
made his adieus to his friends, the number of whom was, at
the moment, reduced to Planchet, traced the plan of his day,
as every busy man whose moments are counted ought to do
because he appreciates their importance.</P>
<P>&quot;My departure is to be,&quot; said he, &quot;at break of day, three
o'clock in the morning; I have then fifteen hours before me.
Take from them the six hours of sleep which are
indispensable for me  -  six; one hour for repasts  -  seven;
one hour for a farewell visit to Athos  -  eight; two hours
for chance circumstances  - -total, ten. There are then five
hours left. One hour to get my money,  -  that is, to have
payment refused by M. Fouquet; another hour to go and
receive my money of M. Colbert, together with his questions
and grimaces; one hour to look over my clothes and arms, and
get my boots cleaned. I have still two hours left. Mordioux!
how rich I am!&quot; And so saying, D'Artagnan felt a strange
joy, a joy of youth, a perfume of those great and happy
years of former times mount into his brain and intoxicate
him. &quot;During these two hours I will go,&quot; said the musketeer,
&quot;and take my quarter's rent of the Image-de-Notre-Dame. That
will be pleasant. Three hundred and seventy-five livres.
Mordioux! but that is astonishing! If the poor man who has
but one livre in his pocket, found a livre and twelve
deniers, that would be justice, that would be excellent; but
never does such a godsend fall to the lot of the poor man.
The rich man, on the contrary, makes himself revenues with
his money, which he does not even touch. Here are three
hundred and seventy-five livres which fall to me from
heaven. I will go then to the Image-de-Notre-Dame, and drink
a glass of Spanish wine with my tenant, which he cannot fail
to offer me. But order must be observed, Monsieur
d'Artagnan, order must be observed! Let us organize our
time, then, and distribute the employment of it! Art. 1st,
Athos; Art. 2d, the Image-de-Notre-Dame; Art. 3d, M.
Fouquet, Art. 4th, M. Colbert; Art. 5th, supper; Art. 6th,
clothes, boots, horse, portmanteau; Art. 7th and last,
sleep.&quot;</P>
<P>In consequence of this arrangement, D'Artagnan went straight
to the Comte de la Fere, to whom modestly and ingenuously he
related a part of his fortunate adventures. Athos had not
been without uneasiness on the subject of D'Artagnan's visit
to the king; but few words sufficed for an explanation of
that. Athos divined that Louis had charged D'Artagnan with
some important mission, and did not even make an effort to
draw the secret from him. He only recommended him to take
care of himself, and offered discreetly to accompany him if
that were desirable.</P>
<P>&quot;But, my dear friend,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;I am going
nowhere.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What! you come and bid me adieu, and are going nowhere?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! yes, yes,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, coloring a little, &quot;I am
going to make an acquisition.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is quite another thing. Then I change my formula.
Instead of `Do not get yourself killed,' I will say,  -  `Do
not get yourself robbed.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My friend, I will inform you if I set eyes on any property
that pleases me, and shall expect you will favor me with
your opinion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said Athos, too delicate to permit himself even
the consolation of a smile. Raoul imitated the paternal
reserve. But D'Artagnan thought it would appear too
mysterious to leave his friends under a pretense, without
even telling them the route he was about to take.</P>
<P>&quot;I have chosen Le Mans,&quot; said he to Athos. &quot;Is it a good
country?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Excellent, my friend,&quot; replied the count, without making
him observe that Le Mans was in the same direction as La
Touraine, and that by waiting two days, at most, he might
travel with a friend. But D'Artagnan, more embarrassed than
the count, dug, at every explanation, deeper into the mud,
into which he sank by degrees. &quot;I shall set out to-morrow at
daybreak,&quot; said he at last. &quot;Till that time, will you come
with me, Raoul?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur le chevalier,&quot; said the young man, &quot;if
monsieur le comte does not want me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, Raoul I am to have an audience to-day of Monsieur, the
king's brother; that is all I have to do.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul asked Grimaud for his sword, which the old man brought
him immediately. &quot;Now then,&quot; added D'Artagnan, opening his
arms to Athos, &quot;adieu, my dear friend!&quot; Athos held him in a
long embrace, and the musketeer, who knew his discretion so
well, murmured in his ear  -  &quot;An affair of state,&quot; to which
Athos only replied by a pressure of the hand, still more
significant. They then separated. Raoul took the arm of his
old friend, who led him along the Rue-Saint-Honore. &quot;I am
conducting you to the abode of the god Plutus,&quot; said
D'Artagnan to the young man; &quot;prepare yourself. The whole
day you will witness the piling up of crowns. Heavens! how I
am changed!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! what numbers of people there are in the street!&quot; said
Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;Is there a procession to-day?&quot; asked D'Artagnan of a
passer-by.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur, it is a hanging,&quot; replied the man.</P>
<P>&quot;What! a hanging at the Greve?&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The devil take the rogue who gets himself hung the day I
want to go and take my rent!&quot; cried D'Artagnan. &quot;Raoul, did
you ever see anybody hung?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never, monsieur  -  thank God!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! how young that sounds! If you were on guard in the
trenches, as I was, and a spy! But, pardon me, Raoul, I am
doting  -  you are quite right, it is a hideous sight to see
a person hung! At what hour do they hang them, monsieur, if
you please?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; replied the stranger respectfully, delighted at
joining conversation with two men of the sword, &quot;it will
take place about three o'clock.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Aha! it is now only half-past one; let us step out, we
shall be there in time to touch my three hundred and
seventy-five livres, and get away before the arrival of the
malefactor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Malefactors, monsieur,&quot; continued the bourgeois; &quot;there are
two of them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur, I return you many thanks,&quot; said D'Artagnan, who,
as he grew older, had become polite to a degree. Drawing
Raoul along, he directed his course rapidly in the direction
of La Greve. Without that great experience musketeers have
of a crowd, to which were joined an irresistible strength of
wrist, and an uncommon suppleness of shoulders, our two
travelers would not have arrived at their place of
destination. They followed the line of the Quai, which they
had gained on quitting the Rue Saint-Honore, where they left
Athos. D'Artagnan went first; his elbow, his wrist, his
shoulder formed three wedges which he knew how to insinuate
with skill into the groups, to make them split and separate
like firewood. He made use sometimes of the hilt of his
sword as an additional help: introducing it between ribs
that were too rebellious, making it take the part of a lever
or crowbar, to separate husband from wife, uncle from
nephew, and brother from brother. And all this was done so
naturally, and with such gracious smiles, that people must
have had ribs of bronze not to cry thank you when the wrist
made its play, or hearts of diamond not to be enchanted when
such a bland smile enlivened the lips of the musketeer.
Raoul, following his friend, cajoled the women who admired
his beauty, pushed back the men who felt the rigidity of his
muscles, and both opened, thanks to these maneuvers, the
compact and muddy tide of the populace. They arrived in
sight of the two gibbets, from which Raoul turned away his
eyes in disgust. As for D'Artagnan, he did not even see
them; his house with its gabled roof, its windows crowded
with the curious, attracted and even absorbed all the
attention he was capable of. He distinguished in the Place
and around the houses a good number of musketeers on leave,
who, some with women, others with friends, awaited the
crowning ceremony. What rejoiced him above all was to see
that his tenant, the cabaretier, was so busy he hardly knew
which way to turn. Three lads could not supply the drinkers.
They filled the shop, the chambers, and the court, even.
D'Artagnan called Raoul's attention to this concourse,
adding: &quot;The fellow will have no excuse for not paying his
rent. Look at those drinkers, Raoul, one would say they were
jolly companions. Mordioux! why, there is no room anywhere!&quot;
D'Artagnan, however, contrived to catch hold of the master
by the corner of his apron, and to make himself known to
him.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, monsieur le chevalier,&quot; said the cabaretier, half
distracted, &quot;one minute if you please. I have here a hundred
mad devils turning my cellar upside down.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The cellar, if you like, but not the money-box.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, monsieur, your thirty-seven and a half pistoles are all
counted out ready for you, upstairs in my chamber, but there
are in that chamber thirty customers, who are sucking the
staves of a little barrel of Oporto which I tapped for them
this very morning. Give me a minute,  -  only a minute.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So be it; so be it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will go,&quot; said Raoul, in a low voice, to D'Artagnan;
&quot;this hilarity is vile!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, sternly, &quot;you will please to
remain where you are. The soldier ought to familiarize
himself with all kinds of spectacles. There are in the eye,
when it is young, fibers which we must learn how to harden;
and we are not truly generous and good save from the moment
when the eye has become hardened, and the heart remains
tender. Besides, my little Raoul, would you leave me alone
here? That would be very wrong of you. Look, there is yonder
in the lower court a tree, and under the shade of that tree
we shall breathe more freely than in this hot atmosphere of
spilt wine.&quot;</P>
<P>From the spot on which they had placed themselves the two
new guests of the Image-de-Notre-Dame heard the
ever-increasing hubbub of the tide of people, and lost
neither a cry nor a gesture of the drinkers, at tables in
the cabaret, or disseminated in the chambers. If D'Artagnan
had wished to place himself as a vidette for an expedition,
he could not have succeeded better. The tree under which he
and Raoul were seated covered them with its already thick
foliage; it was a low, thick chestnut-tree, with inclined
branches, that cast their shade over a table so dilapidated
the drinkers had abandoned it. We said that from this post
D'Artagnan saw everything. He observed the goings and
comings of the waiters; the arrival of fresh drinkers; the
welcome, sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile, given to the
newcomers by others already installed. He observed all this
to amuse himself, for the thirty-seven and a half pistoles
were a long time coming. Raoul recalled his attention to it.
&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said he, &quot;you do not hurry your tenant, and the
condemned will soon be here. There will then be such a press
we shall not be able to get out.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are right,&quot; said the musketeer; &quot;Hola! oh! somebody
there! Mordioux!&quot; But it was in vain he cried and knocked
upon the wreck of the old table, which fell to pieces
beneath his fist; nobody came.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan was preparing to go and seek the cabaretier
himself, to force him to a definite explanation, when the
door of the court in which he was with Raoul, a door which
communicated with the garden situated at the back, opened,
and a man dressed as a cavalier, with his sword in the
sheath, but not at his belt, crossed the court without
closing the door; and having cast an oblique glance at
D'Artagnan and his companion, directed his course towards
the cabaret itself, looking about in all directions with his
eyes capable of piercing walls of consciences. &quot;Humph!&quot; said
D'Artagnan, &quot;my tenants are communicating. That, no doubt,
now, is some amateur in hanging matters.&quot; At the same moment
the cries and disturbance in the upper chambers ceased.
Silence, under such circumstances, surprises more than a
twofold increase of noise. D'Artagnan wished to see what was
the cause of this sudden silence. He then perceived that
this man, dressed as a cavalier, had just entered the
principal chamber, and was haranguing the tipplers, who all
listened to him with the greatest attention. D'Artagnan
would perhaps have heard his speech but for the dominant
noise of the popular clamors, which made a formidable
accompaniment to the harangue of the orator. But it was soon
finished, and all the people the cabaret contained came out,
one after the other, in little groups, so that there only
remained six in the chamber; one of these six, the man with
the sword, took the cabaretier aside, engaging him in
discourse more or less serious, whilst the others lit a
great fire in the chimney-place  -  a circumstance rendered
strange by the fine weather and the heat.</P>
<P>&quot;It is very singular,&quot; said D'Artagnan to Raoul, &quot;but I
think I know those faces yonder.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't you think you can smell the smoke here?&quot; said Raoul</P>
<P>&quot;I rather think I can smell a conspiracy,&quot; replied
D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>He had not finished speaking, when four of these men came
down into the court, and without the appearance of any bad
design, mounted guard at the door of communication, casting,
at intervals, glances at D'Artagnan, which signified many
things.</P>
<P>&quot;Mordioux!&quot; said D'Artagnan, in a low voice, &quot;there is
something going on. Are you curious, Raoul?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;According to the subject, chevalier.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I am as curious as an old woman. Come a little more
in front; we shall get a better view of the place. I would
lay a wager that view will be something curious.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But you know, monsieur le chevalier, that I am not willing
to become a passive and indifferent spectator of the death
of the two poor devils.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And I, then  -  do you think I am a savage? We will go in
again, when it is time to do so. Come along!&quot; And they made
their way towards the front of the house, and placed
themselves near the window which, still more strangely than
the rest, remained unoccupied. The two last drinkers,
instead of looking out at this window, kept up the fire. On
seeing D'Artagnan and his friend enter:  -  &quot;Ah! ah! a
reinforcement,&quot; murmured they.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan jogged Raoul's elbow. &quot;Yes, my braves, a
reinforcement,&quot; said he; &quot;cordieu! there is a famous fire.
Whom are you going to cook?&quot;</P>
<P>The two men uttered a shout of jovial laughter, and, instead
of answering, threw on more wood. D'Artagnan could not take
his eyes off them.</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose,&quot; said one of the fire-makers, &quot;they sent you to
tell us the time  -  did not they?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Without doubt they have,&quot; said D'Artagnan, anxious to know
what was going on; &quot;why should I be here else, if it were
not for that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then place yourself at the window, if you please, and
observe.&quot; D'Artagnan smiled in his mustache, made a sign to
Raoul, and placed himself at the window.</P></article>
