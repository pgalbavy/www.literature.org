<p>There was a terrible mix-up. Some sheep were trying to cross the stone
wall in one direction. Some were trying to cross it in the other. And in
the midst of the fleecy tangle Snowball struggled in vain. He found
himself face to face with Aunt Nancy Ewe, who was so huge that he
couldn't budge her. He pushed and shoved until she cried out, "Where are
your manners, young man?"
</p>
<p>"I--I don't know," Snowball stammered. "Maybe I left them in the berry
bushes, with the bear."

</p><p>Well, the moment she heard the word <u>bear</u> Aunt Nancy blatted at the
top of her lungs. With a mighty heave she turned about on the top of the
wall, sweeping Snowball off it as if he were nothing but a fly.
</p><p>He fell backwards among the raspberry bushes, fully expecting to be
eaten by the bear. He shut his eyes and held his breath, and lay with
his feet in the air, waiting for the bear to seize him.
</p><p>"Oh, dear!" he groaned. "I wonder if he'll begin with my head or my
tail!"
</p><p>Just then he felt a terrible nip at the end of his tail.
</p><p>"He's begun! The bear has begun to eat me!" Snowball thought.
</p><p>As for the bear, he didn't say a single word. And that seemed odd.
Somehow Snowball didn't quite like it because the bear didn't exclaim
how nice and tender he was. His tail was still held fast. And that was
as much as Snowball knew.
</p><p>At last he slowly opened his eyes. To his astonishment he saw no bear.
In fact he saw nobody at all. For the last of Farmer Green's flock of
sheep had vanished. And Snowball noticed, resting on the tip of his
tail, a stone. Though he did not know it, the last sheep to leave had
kicked it down upon him purely by accident.
</p><p>Snowball gave a <u>baa</u> of surprise and relief. With a little effort he
managed to jerk his tail from under the stone. Then he sprang to his
feet. And since there was no knowing where the bear was, Snowball made
all haste to get on the other side of the stone wall and join the flock
of sheep once more.
</p><p>When Aunt Nancy saw him she did not act half as pleased as he had
expected she would.
</p><p>"You got us into a pickle, young man!" she greeted him.
</p><p>"It seems to me," he replied, "that you are the one that made all the
trouble. If you hadn't made me jump the wall----"
</p><p>"If _I_ hadn't made <u>you</u>----" Aunt Nancy interrupted. And turning to
her companions she cried, "Did you ever hear anything like that in all
your days?"
</p><p>And everybody said, "No!"
</p><p>And then somebody asked, "Where's the bear?"
</p><p>But nobody could answer that question.
</p><p>The only one that could have answered it was Cuffy Bear himself. And he
was way up under the mountain--and still running.
</p><p>There wasn't a sheep in the flock that had been more frightened than
he.
