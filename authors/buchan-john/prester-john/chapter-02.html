<p>In this plain story of mine there will be so many wild doings
ere the end is reached, that I beg my reader's assent to a prosaic
digression. I will tell briefly the things which happened between
my sight of the man on the Kirkcaple sands and my voyage to Africa.
I continued for three years at the burgh school, where my progress
was less notable in my studies than in my sports.  One by one
I saw my companions pass out of idle boyhood and be set to professions. 
Tam Dyke on two occasions ran off to sea in the Dutch schooners
which used to load with coal in our port; and finally his father
gave him his will, and he was apprenticed to the merchant service. 
Archie Leslie, who was a year my elder, was destined for the law,
so he left Kirkcaple for an Edinburgh office, where he was also
to take out classes at the college.  I remained on at school till
I sat alone by myself in the highest class&mdash;a position of little
dignity and deep loneliness.  I had grown a tall, square-set lad,
and my prowess at Rugby football was renowned beyond the parishes
of Kirkcaple and Portincross.  To my father I fear I was a disappointment. 
He had hoped for something in his son more bookish and sedentary,
more like his gentle, studious self.</p>

<p>On one thing I was determined: I should follow a learned profession.
The fear of being sent to an office, like so many of my schoolfellows,
inspired me to the little progress I ever made in my studies. 
I chose the ministry, not, I fear, out of any reverence for the
sacred calling, but because my father had followed it before me. 
Accordingly I was sent at the age of sixteen for a year's finishing
at the High School of Edinburgh, and the following winter began
my Arts course at the university.</p>

<p>If Fate had been kinder to me, I think I might have become a
scholar. At any rate I was just acquiring a taste for philosophy
and the dead languages when my father died suddenly of a paralytic
shock, and I had to set about earning a living.</p>

<p>My mother was left badly off, for my poor father had never been
able to save much from his modest stipend.  When all things were
settled, it turned out that she might reckon on an income of about
fifty pounds a year.  This was not enough to live on, however
modest the household, and certainly not enough to pay for the
colleging of a son.  At this point an uncle of hers stepped forward
with a proposal.  He was a well-to-do bachelor, alone in the world,
and he invited my mother to live with him and take care of his
house.  For myself he proposed a post in some mercantile concern,
for he had much influence in the circles of commerce.  There was
nothing for it but to accept gratefully.  We sold our few household
goods, and moved to his gloomy house in Dundas Street.  A few
days later he announced at dinner that he had found for me a chance
which might lead to better things.</p>

<p>'You see, Davie,' he explained, 'you don't know the rudiments
of business life.  There's no house in the country that would
take you in except as a common clerk, and you would never earn
much more than a hundred pounds a year all your days.  If you
want to better your future you must go abroad, where white men
are at a premium.  By the mercy of Providence I met yesterday
an old friend, Thomas Mackenzie, who was seeing his lawyer about
an estate he is bidding for.  He is the head of one of the biggest
trading and shipping concerns in the world &mdash;Mackenzie, Mure,
and Oldmeadows&mdash;you may have heard the name. Among other things
he has half the stores in South Africa, where they sell everything
from Bibles to fish-hooks.  Apparently they like men from home
to manage the stores, and to make a long story short, when I put
your case to him, he promised you a place.  I had a wire from
him this morning confirming the offer.  You are to be assistant
storekeeper at&mdash;' (my uncle fumbled in his pocket, and then read
from the yellow slip) 'at Blaauwildebeestefontein.  There's a
mouthful for you.'</p>

<p>In this homely way I first heard of a place which was to be the
theatre of so many strange doings.</p>

<p>'It's a fine chance for you,' my uncle continued.  'You'll only
be assistant at first, but when you have learned your job you'll
have a store of your own.  Mackenzie's people will pay you three
hundred pounds a year, and when you get a store you'll get a percentage
on sales.  It lies with you to open up new trade among the natives. 
I hear that Blaauw&mdash;something or other, is in the far north of
the Transvaal, and I see from the map that it is in a wild, hilly
country. You may find gold or diamonds up there, and come back
and buy Portincross House.'  My uncle rubbed his hands and smiled
cheerily.</p>

<p>Truth to tell I was both pleased and sad.  If a learned profession
was denied me I vastly preferred a veld store to an Edinburgh
office stool. Had I not been still under the shadow of my father's
death I might have welcomed the chance of new lands and new folk. 
As it was, I felt the loneliness of an exile. That afternoon I
walked on the Braid Hills, and when I saw in the clear spring
sunlight the coast of Fife, and remembered Kirkcaple and my boyish
days, I could have found it in me to sit down and cry.</p>

<p>A fortnight later I sailed.  My mother bade me a tearful farewell,
and my uncle, besides buying me an outfit and paying my passage
money, gave me a present of twenty sovereigns. 'You'll not be
your mother's son, Davie,' were his last words, 'if you don't
come home with it multiplied by a thousand.'  I thought at the
time that I would give more than twenty thousand pounds to be
allowed to bide on the windy shores of Forth.</p>

<p>I sailed from Southampton by an intermediate steamer, and went
steerage to save expense.  Happily my acute homesickness was soon
forgotten in another kind of malady.  It blew half a gale before
we were out of the Channel, and by the time we had rounded Ushant
it was as dirty weather as ever I hope to see.  I lay mortal sick
in my bunk, unable to bear the thought of food, and too feeble
to lift my head.  I wished I had never left home, but so acute
was my sickness that if some one had there and then offered me
a passage back or an immediate landing on shore I should have
chosen the latter.</p>

<p>It was not till we got into the fair-weather seas around Madeira
that I recovered enough to sit on deck and observe my fellow-passengers.
There were some fifty of us in the steerage, mostly wives and
children going to join relations, with a few emigrant artisans
and farmers.  I early found a friend in a little man with a yellow
beard and spectacles, who sat down beside me and remarked on the
weather in a strong Scotch accent.  He turned out to be a Mr Wardlaw
from Aberdeen, who was going out to be a schoolmaster.  He was
a man of good education, who had taken a university degree, and
had taught for some years as an under-master in a school in his
native town.  But the east winds had damaged his lungs, and he
had been glad to take the chance of a poorly paid country school
in the veld.  When I asked him where he was going I was amazed
to be told, 'Blaauwildebeestefontein.'</p>

<p>Mr Wardlaw was a pleasant little man, with a sharp tongue but
a cheerful temper.  He laboured all day at primers of the Dutch
and Kaffir languages, but in the evening after supper he would
walk with me on the after-deck and discuss the future.  Like me,
he knew nothing of the land he was going to, but he was insatiably
curious, and he affected me with his interest.  'This place, Blaauwildebeestefontein,'
he used to say, 'is among the Zoutpansberg mountains, and as far
as I can see, not above ninety miles from the railroad.  It looks
from the map a well-watered country, and the Agent-General in
London told me it was healthy or I wouldn't have taken the job. 
It seems we'll be in the heart of native reserves up there, for
here's a list of chiefs&mdash;'Mpefu, Sikitola, Majinje, Magata; and
there are no white men living to the east of us because of the
fever.  The name means the "spring of the blue wildebeeste," whatever
fearsome animal that may be.  It sounds like a place for adventure,
Mr Crawfurd.  You'll exploit the pockets of the black men and
I'll see what I can do with their minds.' There was another steerage
passenger whom I could not help observing because of my dislike
of his appearance.  He, too, was a little man, by name Henriques,
and in looks the most atrocious villain I have ever clapped eyes
on.  He had a face the colour of French mustard&mdash;a sort of dirty
green&mdash;and bloodshot, beady eyes with the whites all yellowed
with fever. He had waxed moustaches, and a curious, furtive way
of walking and looking about him.  We of the steerage were careless
in our dress, but he was always clad in immaculate white linen,
with pointed, yellow shoes to match his complexion.  He spoke
to no one, but smoked long cheroots all day in the stern of the
ship, and studied a greasy pocket-book. Once I tripped over him
in the dark, and he turned on me with a snarl and an oath.  I
was short enough with him in return, and he looked as if he could
knife me.</p>

<p>'I'll wager that fellow has been a slave-driver in his time,'
I told Mr Wardlaw, who said, 'God pity his slaves, then.'</p>

<p>And now I come to the incident which made the rest of the voyage
pass all too soon for me, and foreshadowed the strange events
which were to come.  It was the day after we crossed the Line,
and the first-class passengers were having deck sports.  A tug-of-war
had been arranged between the three classes, and a half-dozen
of the heaviest fellows in the steerage, myself included, were
invited to join.  It was a blazing hot afternoon, but on the saloon
deck there were awnings and a cool wind blowing from the bows. 
The first-class beat the second easily, and after a tremendous
struggle beat the steerage also.  Then they regaled us with iced-drinks
and cigars to celebrate the victory.</p>

<p>I was standing at the edge of the crowd of spectators, when my
eye caught a figure which seemed to have little interest in our
games.  A large man in clerical clothes was sitting on a deck-chair
reading a book.  There was nothing novel about the stranger, and
I cannot explain the impulse which made me wish to see his face. 
I moved a few steps up the deck, and then I saw that his skin
was black.  I went a little farther, and suddenly he raised his
eyes from his book and looked round. It was the face of the man
who had terrified me years ago on the Kirkcaple shore.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the day in a brown study.  It was clear to
me that some destiny had prearranged this meeting.  Here was this
man travelling prosperously as a first-class passenger with all
the appurtenances of respectability.  I alone had seen him invoking
strange gods in the moonlight, I alone knew of the devilry in
his heart, and I could not but believe that some day or other
there might be virtue in that knowledge.</p>

<p>The second engineer and I had made friends, so I got him to consult
the purser's list for the name of my acquaintance. He was down
as the Rev. John Laputa, and his destination was Durban. The next
day being Sunday, who should appear to address us steerage passengers
but the black minister.  He was introduced by the captain himself,
a notably pious man, who spoke of the labours of his brother in
the dark places of heathendom. Some of us were hurt in our pride
in being made the target of a black man's oratory.  Especially
Mr Henriques, whose skin spoke of the tar-brush, protested with
oaths against the insult. Finally he sat down on a coil of rope,
and spat scornfully in the vicinity of the preacher.</p>

<p>For myself I was intensely curious, and not a little impressed. 
The man's face was as commanding as his figure, and his voice
was the most wonderful thing that ever came out of human mouth. 
It was full and rich, and gentle, with the tones of a great organ. 
He had none of the squat and preposterous negro lineaments, but
a hawk nose like an Arab, dark flashing eyes, and a cruel and
resolute mouth.  He was black as my hat, but for the rest he might
have sat for a figure of a Crusader.  I do not know what the sermon
was about, though others told me that it was excellent.  All the
time I watched him, and kept saying to myself, 'You hunted me
up the Dyve Burn, but I bashed your face for you.' Indeed, I thought
I could see faint scars on his cheek.</p>

<p>The following night I had toothache, and could not sleep.  It
was too hot to breathe under cover, so I got up, lit a pipe, and
walked on the after-deck to ease the pain.  The air was very still,
save for the whish of water from the screws and the steady beat
of the engines. Above, a great yellow moon looked down on me,
and a host of pale stars.</p>

<p>The moonlight set me remembering the old affair of the Dyve Burn,
and my mind began to run on the Rev. John Laputa.  It pleased
me to think that I was on the track of some mystery of which I
alone had the clue. I promised myself to search out the antecedents
of the minister when I got to Durban, for I had a married cousin
there, who might know something of his doings.  Then, as I passed
by the companion-way to the lower deck, I heard voices, and peeping
over the rail, I saw two men sitting in the shadow just beyond
the hatch of the hold.</p>

<p>I thought they might be two of the sailors seeking coolness on
the open deck, when something in the figure of one of them made
me look again. The next second I had slipped back and stolen across
the after-deck to a point just above them.  For the two were the
black minister and that ugly yellow villain, Henriques.</p>

<p>I had no scruples about eavesdropping, but I could make nothing
of their talk.  They spoke low, and in some tongue which may have
been Kaffir or Portuguese, but was in any case unknown to me. 
I lay, cramped and eager, for many minutes, and was just getting
sick of it when a familiar name caught my ear.  Henriques said
something in which I caught the word 'Blaauwildebeestefontein.' 
I listened intently, and there could be no mistake.  The minister
repeated the name, and for the next few minutes it recurred often
in their talk.  I went back stealthily to bed, having something
to make me forget my aching tooth. First of all, Laputa and Henriques
were allies.  Second, the place I was bound for had something
to do with their schemes.</p>

<p>I said nothing to Mr Wardlaw, but spent the next week in the
assiduous toil of the amateur detective.  I procured some maps
and books from my friend, the second engineer, and read all I
could about Blaauwildebeestefontein.  Not that there was much
to learn; but I remember I had quite a thrill when I discovered
from the chart of the ship's run one day that we were in the same
latitude as that uncouthly-named spot.  I found out nothing, however,
about Henriques or the Rev. John Laputa.  The Portuguese still
smoked in the stern, and thumbed his greasy notebook; the minister
sat in his deck-chair, and read heavy volumes from the ship's
library.  Though I watched every night, I never found them again
together.</p>

<p>At Cape Town Henriques went ashore and did not return. The minister
did not budge from the ship the three days we lay in port, and,
indeed, it seemed to me that he kept his cabin.  At any rate I
did not see his great figure on deck till we were tossing in the
choppy seas round Cape Agulhas. Sea-sickness again attacked me,
and with short lulls during our stoppages at Port Elizabeth and
East London, I lay wretchedly in my bunk till we sighted the bluffs
of Durban harbour.</p>

<p>Here it was necessary for me to change my ship, for in the interests
of economy I was going by sea to Delagoa Bay, and thence by the
cheap railway journey into the Transvaal.  I sought out my cousin,
who lived in a fine house on the Berea, and found a comfortable
lodging for the three days of my stay there.  I made inquiries
about Mr Laputa, but could hear nothing.  There was no native
minister of that name, said my cousin, who was a great authority
on all native questions.  I described the man, but got no further
light.  No one had seen or heard of such a being, 'unless,' said
my cousin, 'he is one of those American Ethiopian rascals.'</p>

<p>My second task was to see the Durban manager of the firm which
I had undertaken to serve.  He was a certain Mr Colles, a big
fat man, who welcomed me in his shirt-sleeves, with a cigar in
his mouth.  He received me pleasantly, and took me home to dinner
with him.</p>

<p>'Mr Mackenzie has written about you,' he said.  'I'll be quite
frank with you, Mr Crawfurd.  The firm is not exactly satisfied
about the way business has been going lately at Blaauwildebeestefontein.
There's a grand country up there, and a grand opportunity for
the man who can take it.  Japp, who is in charge, is an old man
now and past his best, but he has been long with the firm, and
we don't want to hurt his feelings.  When he goes, which must
be pretty soon, you'll have a good chance of the place, if you
show yourself an active young fellow.'</p>

<p>He told me a great deal more about Blaauwildebeestefontein, principally
trading details.  Incidentally he let drop that Mr Japp had had
several assistants in the last few years.  I asked him why they
had left, and he hesitated.</p>

<p>'It's a lonely place, and they didn't like the life.  You see,
there are few white men near, and young fellows want society.
They complained, and were moved on.  But the firm didn't think
the more of them.'</p>

<p>I told him I had come out with the new schoolmaster.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said reflectively, 'the school.  That's been vacant
pretty often lately.  What sort of fellow is this Wardlaw?  Will
he stay, I wonder?'</p>

<p>'From all accounts,' I said, 'Blaauwildebeestefontein does not
seem popular.'</p>

<p>'It isn't.  That's why we've got you out from home.  The colonial-born
doesn't find it fit in with his idea of comfort.  He wants society,
and he doesn't like too many natives.  There's nothing up there
but natives and a few back-veld Dutchmen with native blood in
them.  You fellows from home are less set on an easy life, or
you wouldn't be here.'</p>

<p>There was something in Mr Colles's tone which made me risk another
question.</p>

<p>'What's the matter with the place?  There must be more wrong
with it than loneliness to make everybody clear out.  I have taken
on this job, and I mean to stick to it, so you needn't be afraid
to tell me.'</p>

<p>The manager looked at me sharply.  'That's the way to talk, my
lad. You look as if you had a stiff back, so I'll be frank with
you.  There is something about the place.  It gives the ordinary
man the jumps. What it is, I don't know, and the men who come
back don't know themselves.  I want you to find out for me.  You'll
be doing the firm an enormous service if you can get on the track
of it.  It may be the natives, or it may be the takhaars, or it
may be something else.  Only old Japp can stick it out, and he's
too old and doddering to care about moving.  I want you to keep
your eyes skinned, and write privately to me if you want any help. 
You're not out here for your health, I can see, and here's a chance
for you to get your foot on the ladder.</p>

<p>'Remember, I'm your friend,' he said to me again at the garden
gate. 'Take my advice and lie very low.  Don't talk, don't meddle
with drink, learn all you can of the native jabber, but don't
let on you understand a word.  You're sure to get on the track
of something.  Good-bye, my boy,' and he waved a fat hand to me.</p>

<p>That night I embarked on a cargo-boat which was going round the
coast to Delagoa Bay.  It is a small world&mdash;at least for us far-wandering
Scots.  For who should I find when I got on board but my old friend
Tam Dyke, who was second mate on the vessel?  We wrung each other's
hands, and I answered, as best I could, his questions about Kirkcaple. 
I had supper with him in the cabin, and went on deck to see the
moorings cast.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a bustle on the quay, and a big man with a
handbag forced his way up the gangway.  The men who were getting
ready to cast off tried to stop him, but he elbowed his way forward,
declaring he must see the captain.  Tam went up to him and asked
civilly if he had a passage taken.  He admitted he had not, but
said he would make it right in two minutes with the captain himself. 
The Rev. John Laputa, for some reason of his own, was leaving
Durban with more haste than he had entered it.</p>

<p>I do not know what passed with the captain, but the minister
got his passage right enough, and Tam was even turned out of his
cabin to make room for him.  This annoyed my friend intensely.</p>

<p>'That black brute must be made of money, for he paid through
the nose for this, or I'm a Dutchman.  My old man doesn't take
to his black brethren any more than I do.  Hang it all, what are
we coming to, when we're turning into a blooming cargo boat for
niggers?'</p>

<p>I had all too little of Tam's good company, for on the afternoon
of the second day we reached the little town of Lourenco Marques. 
This was my final landing in Africa, and I mind how eagerly I
looked at the low, green shores and the bush-covered slopes of
the mainland.  We were landed from boats while the ship lay out
in the bay, and Tam came ashore with me to spend the evening. 
By this time I had lost every remnant of homesickness.  I had
got a job before me which promised better things than colleging
at Edinburgh, and I was as keen to get up country now as I had
been loth to leave England.  My mind being full of mysteries,
I scanned every Portuguese loafer on the quay as if he had been
a spy, and when Tam and I had had a bottle of Collates in a cafe
I felt that at last I had got to foreign parts and a new world.</p>

<p>Tam took me to supper with a friend of his, a Scot by the name
of Aitken, who was landing-agent for some big mining house on
the Rand. He hailed from Fife and gave me a hearty welcome, for
he had heard my father preach in his young days. Aitken was a
strong, broad-shouldered fellow who had been a sergeant in the
Gordons, and during the war he had done secret-service work in
Delagoa.  He had hunted, too, and traded up and down Mozambique,
and knew every dialect of the Kaffirs. He asked me where I was
bound for, and when I told him there was the same look in his
eyes as I had seen with the Durban manager.</p>

<p>'You're going to a rum place, Mr Crawfurd,' he said.</p>

<p>'So I'm told.  Do you know anything about it?  You're not the
first who has looked queer when I've spoken the name.'</p>

<p>'I've never been there,' he said, 'though I've been pretty near
it from the Portuguese side.  That's the funny thing about Blaauwildebeestefontein. 
Everybody has heard of it, and nobody knows it.'</p>

<p>'I wish you would tell me what you have heard.'</p>

<p>'Well, the natives are queer up thereaways.  There's some kind
of a holy place which every Kaffir from Algoa Bay to the Zambesi
and away beyond knows about.  When I've been hunting in the bush-veld
I've often met strings of Kaffirs from hundreds of miles distant,
and they've all been going or coming from Blaauwildebeestefontein. 
It's like Mecca to the Mohammedans, a place they go to on pilgrimage. 
I've heard of an old man up there who is believed to be two hundred
years old. Anyway, there's some sort of great witch or wizard
living in the mountains.'</p>

<p>Aitken smoked in silence for a time; then he said, 'I'll tell
you another thing.  I believe there's a diamond mine.  I've often
meant to go up and look for it.'</p>

<p>Tam and I pressed him to explain, which he did slowly after his
fashion.</p>

<p>'Did you ever hear of <em>I.D.B.&mdash;</em>illicit diamond broking?'
he asked me. 'Well, it's notorious that the Kaffirs on the diamond
fields get away with a fair number of stones, and they are bought
by Jew and Portuguese traders.  It's against the law to deal in
them, and when I was in the intelligence here we used to have
a lot of trouble with the vermin. But I discovered that most of
the stones came from natives in one part of the country&mdash;more
or less round Blaauwildebeestefontein&mdash;and I see no reason to
think that they had all been stolen from Kimberley or the Premier. 
Indeed some of the stones I got hold of were quite different from
any I had seen in South Africa before.  I shouldn't wonder if
the Kaffirs in the Zoutpansberg had struck some rich pipe, and
had the sense to keep quiet about it.  Maybe some day I'll take
a run up to see you and look into the matter.'</p>

<p>After this the talk turned on other topics till Tam, still nursing
his grievance, asked a question on his own account. 'Did you ever
come across a great big native parson called Laputa?  He came
on board as we were leaving Durban, and I had to turn out of my
cabin for him.'  Tam described him accurately but vindictively,
and added that 'he was sure he was up to no good.'</p>

<p>Aitken shook his head.  'No, I don't know the man.  You say he
landed here?  Well, I'll keep a look-out for him.  Big native
parsons are not so common.'</p>

<p>Then I asked about Henriques, of whom Tam knew nothing. I described
his face, his clothes, and his habits.  Aitken laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>'Tut, my man, most of the subjects of his Majesty the King of
Portugal would answer to that description.  If he's a rascal,
as you think, you may be certain he's in the <em>I.D.B. </em>business,
and if I'm right about Blaauwildebeestefontein you'll likely have
news of him there some time or other.  Drop me a line if he comes,
and I'll get on to his record.'</p>

<p>I saw Tam off in the boat with a fairly satisfied mind.  I was
going to a place with a secret, and I meant to find it out.  The
natives round Blaauwildebeestefontein were queer, and diamonds
were suspected somewhere in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Henriques had something to do with the place, and so had the
Rev. John Laputa, about whom I knew one strange thing.  So did
Tam by the way, but he had not identified his former pursuer,
and I had told him nothing.  I was leaving two men behind me,
Colles at Durban and Aitken at Lourenco Marques, who would help
me if trouble came.  Things were shaping well for some kind of
adventure.</p>

<p>The talk with Aitken had given Tam an inkling of my thoughts. 
His last words to me were an appeal to let him know if there was
any fun going.</p>

<p>'I can see you're in for a queer job.  Promise to let me hear
from you if there's going to be a row, and I'll come up country,
though I should have to desert the service.  Send us a letter
to the agents at Durban in case we should be in port.  You haven't
forgotten the Dyve Burn, Davie?'</p>
