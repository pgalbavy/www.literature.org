<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>For it meant that. Imprisoned! Castro's derisive shriek meant
that. And I had known it before. He emerged back out of the black
depths, with livid, swollen features, and foam about his mouth,
to splutter:</p>

<p>"Their corpses, you say.... Ha! Our corpses," and retreated again,
where I could only hear incoherent mutters.</p>

<p>Seraphina clutched my arm. "Juan&mdash;together&mdash;no separation."</p>

<p>I had known it, even as I spoke of selling our lives dearly.
They could only be surrendered. Surrendered miserably to these
wretches, or to the everlasting darkness in which Castro muttered
his despair. I needed not to hear this ominous and sinister sound&mdash;nor
yet Seraphina's cry. She understood, too. They would never come
down unless to look upon us when we were dead. I need not have
gone to the entrance of the cave to understand all the horror
of our fate. The <em>Lugareños</em> had already lighted a fire.
Very near the brink, too.</p>

<p>It was burning some thirty feet above my head; and the sheer
wall on the other side caught up and sent across into my face
the crackling of dry branches, the loud excited talking, the arguments,
the oaths, the laughter; now and then a very shriek of joy. Manuel
was giving orders. Some advanced the opinion that the cursed <em>Inglez</em>,
the spy who came from Jamaica to see whom he could get for a hanging
without a priest, was down there, too. So that was it! O'Brien
knew how to stir their hate. I should get a short shrift. "He
was a fiend, the <em>Inglez</em>: look how many of us he has killed!"
they cried; and Manuel would have loved to cut my flesh, in small
pieces, off my bones&mdash;only, alas! I was now beyond his vengeance,
he feared. However, somebody was left.</p>

<p>He must have thrown himself flat, with his head over the brink,
for his yell of "Castro!" exploded, and rolled heavily between
the rocks.</p>

<p>"Castro! Castro! Castro!" he shouted twenty times, till he set
the whole ravine in an uproar. He waited, and when the clamour
had quieted down amongst the bushes below, called out softly,
"Do you hear me, Castro, my victim? Thou art my victim, Castro."</p>

<p>Castro had crept into the passage after me. He pushed his head
beyond my shoulder.</p>

<p>"I defy thee, Manuel," he screamed.</p>

<p>A hubbub arose. "He's there! He is there!"</p>

<p>"Bravo, Castro," Manuel shouted from above. "I love thee because
thou art my victim. I shall sing a song for thee. Come up. Hey!
Castro! Castro! Come up.... No? Then the dead to their grave,
and the living to their feast."</p>

<p>Sometimes a little earth, detached from the layer of soil covering
the rock, would fall streaming from above. The men told off to
guard the cornice walked to and fro near the edge, and the confused
murmur of voices hung subdued in the air of the cleft, like a
modulated tremor. Castro, moaning gently, stumbled back into the
cave.</p>

<p>Seraphina had remained sitting on the stone seat. The twilight
rested on her knees, on her face, on the heap of cold ashes at
her feet. But Castro, who had stood stock-still, with a hand to
his forehead, turned to me excitedly:</p>

<p>"The peons, <em>for Dios!</em>" Had I ever thought of the peons
belonging to the <em>estancia?</em></p>

<p>Well, that was a hope. I did not know exactly how matters stood
between them and the <em>Lugareños</em>. There was no love lost.
A fight was likely; but, even if no actual collision took place,
they would be sure to visit the camp above in no very friendly
spirit; a chance might offer to make our position known to these
men, who had no reason to hate either me or Castro&mdash;and would
not be afraid of thwarting the miserable band of ghouls sitting
above our grave. How our presence could be made known I was not
sure. Perhaps simply by shouting with all our might from the mouth
of the cave. We could offer rewards&mdash;say who we were, summon them
for the service of their own Señorita. But, probably, they had
never heard of her. No matter. The news would soon reach the <em>hacienda</em>,
and Enrico had two hundred slaves at his back. One of us must
always remain at the mouth of the cave listening to what went
on above. There would be the trampling of horses' hoofs&mdash;quarrelling,
no doubt&mdash;anyway, much talk&mdash;new voices&mdash;something to inform us.
Only, how soon would they come? They were not likely to be riding
where there were no cattle. Had Castro seen any signs of a herd
on the uplands near by?</p>

<p>His face fell. He had not. There were many <em>savannas</em>
within the belt of forests, and the herds might be miles away,
stampeded inland by the storm. Sitting down suddenly, as if overcome,
he averted his eyes and began to scratch the rock between his
legs with the point of his blade.</p>

<p>We were all silent. How long could we wait? How long could people
live?... I looked at Seraphina. How long could she live?... The
thought seared my heart like a hot iron. I wrung my hands stealthily.</p>

<p>"Ha! my blade!" muttered Castro. "My sting.... Old scorpion!
They did not take my sting away.... Only&mdash;bah!"</p>

<p>He, a man, had not risen to the fortitude of a venomous creature.
He was defeated. He groaned profoundly. Life was too much. It
clung to one. A scorpion&mdash;an insect&mdash;within a ring of flames,
would lift its sting and stab venom into its own head. And he
&mdash;Castro&mdash;a man&mdash;a man, <em>por Dios</em>&mdash;had less firmness
than a creeping thing. Why&mdash;why, did he not stab this dishonoured
old heart?</p>

<p>"Señorita," he cried agonizingly, "I swear I did shout to them
to fire&mdash;so&mdash;in to my breast&mdash;and then..."</p>

<p>Seraphina leaned over him pityingly.</p>

<p>"Enough, Castro. One lives because of hope. And grieve not. Thy
death would have done no good."</p>

<p>Her face had a splendid pallor, the radiant whiteness and majesty
of marble; it had never before appeared to me more beautiful:
and her hair unrolling its dark undulations, as if tinged deep
with the funereal gloom of the background, covered her magnificently
right down to her elbows. Her eyes were incredibly profound. Her
person had taken on an indefinable beauty, a new beauty, that,
like the comeliness that comes from joy, love, or success, seemed
to rise from the depths of her being, as if an unsuspected and
sombre quality of her soul had responded to the horror of our
situation. The fierce trials had gradually developed her, as burning
sunshine opens the bud of a flower; and I beheld her now in the
plenitude of her nature. From time to time Castro would raise
up to her his blinking old eyes, full of timidity and distress.</p>

<p>He had not been young enough to throw himself over&mdash;he had worn
the chain for too many years, had lived well and softly too long,
was too old a slave. And yet&mdash;if he had had the courage of the
act! Who knows? I rejected the thought far from me. It returned,
and I caught myself looking at him with irritated eyes. But this
first day passed not intolerably. We ignored our sufferings. Indeed,
I felt none for my part. We had kept our thoughts bound to the
slow blank minutes. And if we exchanged a few words now and then,
it was to speak of patience, of resolution to endure and to hope.</p>

<p>At night, from the hot ravine full of shadows, came the cool
fretting of the stream. The big blaze they kept up above crackled
distinctly, throwing a fiery, restless stain on the face of the
rock in front of the cave, high up under the darkness and the
stars of the sky&mdash;and a pair of feet would appear stamping, the
shadow of a pair of ankles and feet, fantastic, sustaining no
gigantic body, but enormous, tramping slowly, resembling two coffins
leaping to a slow measure. I see them in my dreams now, sometimes.
They disappeared.</p>

<p>Manuel would sing; far in the night the monotonous staccato of
the guitar went on, accompanying plaintive murmurs, outbursts
of anger and cries of pain, the tremulous moans of sorrow. My
nerves vibrated, I broke my nails on the rock, and seemed to hear
once more the parody of all the transports and of every anguish,
even to death&mdash;a tragic and ignoble rendering of life. He was
a true artist, powerful and scorned, admired with derision, obeyed
with jeers. It was a song of mourning; he sat on the brink with
his feet dangling over the precipice that sent him back his inspired
tones with a confused noise of sobs and desolation.... His idol
had been snatched from the humility of his adoring silence, like
a falling star from the sight of the worm that crawls.... He stormed
on the strings; and his voice emerged like the crying of a castaway
in the tumult of the gale. He apostrophized his instrument....
Woe! Woe! No more songs. He would break it. Its work was done.
He would dash it against the rock.... His palm slapped the hollow
wood furiously.... So that it should lie shattered and mute like
his own heart!</p>

<p>A frenzied explosion of yells, jests, and applause covered the
finale.</p>

<p>A complete silence would follow, as if in the acclamations they
had exhausted at once every bestial sound. Somebody would cough
pitifully for a long time&mdash;and when he had done spluttering and
cursing, the world outside appeared lost in an even more profound
stillness. The red stain of the fire wavered across to play under
the dark brow of the rock. The irritated murmur of the torrent,
tearing along below, returned timidly at first, expanded, filled
the ravine, ran through my ears in an angry babble. The deadened
footfalls on the brink sometimes dislodged a pebble: it would
start with a feeble rattle and be heard no more.</p>

<p>In the daytime, too, there were silences up there, perfect, profound.
No prowl of feet disturbed them; the sun blazed between the rocks,
and even the hum of insects could be heard. It seemed impossible
not to believe that they had all died by a miracle, or else had
been driven away by a silent panic. But two or more were always
on the watch, directly above, with their heads over the edge;
and suddenly they would begin to talk together in drowsy tones.
It was as if some barbarous somnambulists had mumbled in the daytime
the bizarre atrocity of their thoughts.</p>

<p>They discussed Williams' flask, which had been picked up. Was
the cup made of silver, they wondered. Manuel had appropriated
it for his own use, it seems. Well&mdash;he was the <em>capataz</em>.
The <em>Inglez</em>, should he appear by an impossible chance,
was to be shot down at once; but Castro must be allowed to give
himself up. And they would snigger ferociously. Sometimes quarrels
arose, very noisy, a great hubbub of bickerings touching their
jealousies, their fears, their unspeakable hopes of murder and
rapine. They did not feel very safe where they were. Some would
maintain that Castro could not have saved himself, alone. The
<em>Inglez</em> was there, and even the senorita herself... Manuel
scouted the idea with contempt. He advanced the violence of the
storm, the fury of the waves, the broken mast, the position of
the boat. How could they expect a woman!.... No. It was as his
song had it. And he defended his point of view angrily, as though
he could not bear being robbed of that source of poetical inspiration.
He emitted profound sighs and superb declamations.</p>

<p>Castro and I listened to them at the mouth of the cave. Our tongues
were dry and swollen in our mouths, there was the pressure of
an iron clutch on our windpipes, fire in our throats, and the
pangs of hunger that tore at us like iron pincers. But we could
hear that the bandits above were anxious to be gone; they had
but very few charges for their guns, and it was apparent that
they were afraid of a collision with the peons of the <em>hacienda</em>.
Glaring at each other with bloodshot, uncertain eyes, Castro and
I imagined longingly a vision of men in <em>ponchos</em> spurring
madly out of the woods, bent low, and swinging <em>riatas</em>
over the necks of their horses&mdash;with the thunder of the galloping
hoofs in the cave. Seraphina had withdrawn further into the darkness.
And, with a shrinking fear, I would join her, to eat my heart
out by the side of her tense and mute contemplation.</p>

<p>Sometimes Manuel would begin again, "Castro! Castro! Castro!"
till he seemed to stagger the rocks and disturb the placid sunshine
with an immense wave of sound. He called upon his victim to drink
once more before he died. Long shrieks of derision rent the air,
as if torn out of his breast by far greater torments than any
his fancy delighted to invent. There was something terrible and
weird in the abundance of words screeched continuously, without
end, as if in desperation. No wonder Castro fled from the passage.
And Seraphina and I, within, would be startled out of our half-delirious
state by the sudden appearance of that old man, disordered, sordid,
with a white beard sprouting, who wandered, weeping aloud in the
twilight.</p>

<p>More than once I would stagger off far away into the depths of
the cavern in an access of rage, fling myself on the floor, bite
my arms, beat my head on the rock. I would give myself up. She
must be saved from this tortured death. She had said she would
throw herself over if I left her. But would she have the strength?
It was impossible to know. For days it seemed she had been lying
perfectly still, on her side, one hand under her wan cheek, and
only answering "Juan" when I pronounced her name. There was something
awful in our dry whispers. They were lifeless, like the tones
of the dead, if the dead ever speak to each other across the earth
separating the graves. The moral suffering, joined to the physical
torture of hunger and thirst, annihilated my will in a measure,
but also kindled a vague, gnawing feeling of hostility against
her. She asked too much of me. It was too much. And I would drag
myself back to sit for hours, and with an aching heart look towards
her couch from a distance.</p>

<p>My eyes, accustomed to obscurity, traced an indistinct and recumbent
form. Her forehead was white; her hair merged into the darkness
which was gathering slowly upon her eyes, her cheeks, her throat.
She was perfectly still. It was cruel, it was odious, it was intolerable
to be so still. This must end. I would carry her out by main force.
She said no word, but there was in the embrace of those arms instantly
thrown around my neck, in the feel of those dry lips pressed upon
mine, in the emaciated face, in the big shining eyes of that being
as light as a feather, a passionate mournfulness of seduction,
a tenacious clinging to the appointed fate, that suddenly overawed
my movement of rage. I laid her down again, and covered my face
with my hands. She called out to Castro. He reeled, as if drunk,
and waited at the head of her couch, with his chin dropped on
his breast. "<em>Vuestra, Señoria</em>," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Listen well, Castro." Her voice was very faint, and each word
came alone, as if shrunk and parched. "Can my gold&mdash;the promise
of much gold&mdash;you know these men&mdash;save the lives...?"</p>

<p>He uttered a choked cry, and began to tremble, groping for her
hand.</p>

<p>"<em>Si, Señorita</em>. Excellency, <em>si</em>. It would. Mercy.
Save me. I am too old to bear this. Gold, yes; much gold. Manuel...."</p>

<p>"Listen, Castro.... And Don Juan?" His head fell again. "Speak
the truth, Castro."</p>

<p>He struggled with himself; then, rattling in his throat, shrieked
"No!"  with a terrible effort. "No. Nothing can save thy English
lover." "Why?"  she breathed feebly. He raged at her in his weakness.
Why? Because the order had gone forth; because they dared not
disobey. Because she had only gold in the palm of her hand, while
Señor O'Brien held all their lives in his. The accursed <em>Juez</em>
was for them like death itself that walks amongst men, taking
this one, leaving another.</p>

<p>He was their life, and their law, and their safety, and their
death&mdash;and the <em>caballero</em> had not killed him....</p>

<p>His voice seemed to wither and dry up gradually in his throat.
He crawled away, and we heard him chuckling horribly somewhere,
like a madman. Seraphina stretched out her hand.</p>

<p>"Then, Juan&mdash;why not together&mdash;like this?"</p>

<p>If she had the courage of this death, I must have even more.
It was a point of honour. I had no wish, and no right, to seek
for some easier way out of life. But she had a woman's capacity
for passive endurance, a serenity of mind in this martyrdom confessing
to something sinister in the power of love that, like faith, can
move mountains and order cruel sacrifices. She could have walked
out in perfect safety&mdash;and it was that thought that maddened me.
And there was no sleep; there were only intervals in which I could
fall into a delirious reverie of still lakes, of vast sheets of
water. I waded into them up to my lips. Never further. They were
smooth and cold as ice; I stood in them shivering and straining
for a draught, burning within with the fire of thirst, while a
phantom all pale, and with its hair streaming, called to me "Courage!" 
from the brink in Seraphina's voice. As to Castro, he was going
mad. He was simply going mad, as people go mad for want of food
and drink. And yet he seemed to keep his strength. He was never
still. It was a factitious strength, the restlessness of incipient
insanity. Once, while I was trying to talk with him about our
only hope&mdash;the peons&mdash;he gave me a look of such sombre distraction
that I left off, intimidated, to wonder vaguely at this glimpse
of something hidden and excessive springing from torments which
surely could be no greater than mine.</p>

<p>He had the strength, and sometimes he could find the voice, to
hurl abuse, curses, and imprecations from the mouth of the cave.
Great shouts of laughter exploded above, and they seemed to hold
their breath to hear more; or Manuel, hanging over, would praise
in mocking, mellifluous accents the energy of his denunciations.
I tried to pull him away from there, but he turned upon me fiercely;
and from prudence&mdash;for all hope was not dead in me yet &mdash;I
left him alone.</p>

<p>That night I heard him make an extraordinary sound chewing; at
the same time he was sobbing and cursing stealthily. He had found
something to eat, then! I could not believe my ears, but I began
to creep towards the sound, and suddenly there was a short, mad
scuffle in the darkness, during which I nearly spitted myself
on his blade. At last, trembling in every limb, with my blood
beating furiously in my ears, I scrambled to my feet, holding
a small piece of meat in my hands. Instantly, without hesitating,
without thinking, I plunged my teeth into it only to fling it
far away from me with a frantic execration. This was the first
sound uttered since we had grappled. Lying prone near me, Castro,
with a rattle in his throat, tried to laugh.</p>

<p>This was a supreme touch of Manuel's art; they were pressed for
time, and he had hit upon that deep and politic invention to hasten
the surrender of his beloved victim. I nearly cried with the fiery
pain on my cracked lips. That piece of half-putrid flesh was salt&mdash;horribly
salt&mdash;salt like salt itself. Whenever they heard him rave and
mutter at the mouth of the cave, they would throw down these prepared
scraps. It was as if I had put a live coal into my mouth.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he croaked feebly. "Have you thrown it away? I, too; the
first piece. No matter. I can no more swallow anything, now."</p>

<p>His voice was like the rustling of parchment at my feet.</p>

<p>"Do not look for it, Don Juan. The sinners in hell.... Ha! Fiend.
I could not resist."</p>

<p>I sank down by his side. He seemed to be writhing on the floor
muttering, "Thirst&mdash;thirst&mdash;thirst." His blade clicked on the
rock; then all was still. Was he dead? Suddenly he began with
an amazingly animated utterance.</p>

<p>"Señor! For this they had to kill cattle."</p>

<p>This thought had kept him up. Probably, they had been firing
shots. But there was a way of hamstringing a stalked cow silently;
and the plains were vast, the grass on them was long; the carcasses
would lie hidden out of sight; the herds were rounded up only
twice every year. His despairing voice died out in a mournful
fall, and again he was as still as death.</p>

<p>"No! I can bear this no longer," he uttered with force. He refused
to bear it. He suffered too much. There was no hope. He would
overwhelm them with maledictions, and then leap down from the
ledge. "<em>Adios, Señor</em>."</p>

<p>I stretched out my arm and caught him by the leg. It seemed to
me I could not part with him. It would have been disloyal, an
admission that all was over, the beginning of the end. We were
exhausting ourselves by this sort of imbecile wrestling. Meantime,
I kept on entreating him to be a man; and at last I managed to
clamber upon his chest. "A man!" he sighed. I released him. For
a space, unheard in the darkness, he seemed to be collecting all
his remaining strength.</p>

<p>"Oh, those strange <em>Inglez!</em> Why should I not leap? and
whom do you love best or hate more, me or the senorita? Be thou
a man, also, and pray God to give thee reason to understand men
for once in thy life. Ha! Enamoured woman&mdash;he is a fool! But I,
Castro...."</p>

<p>His whispering became appallingly unintelligible, then ceased,
passing into a moan. My will to restrain him abandoned me. He
had brought this on us. And if he really wished to give up the
struggle....</p>

<p>"Señor," he mumbled brokenly, "a thousand thanks. Br-r-r! Oh,
the ugly water&mdash;water&mdash;water&mdash;water&mdash;salt water&mdash;salt! You saved
me. Why? Let God be the Judge. I would have preferred a malignant
demon for a friend. I forgive you. <em>Adios!</em> And&mdash;Her
Excellency&mdash;poor Castro.... Ha! Thou old scorpion, encircled by
fire&mdash;by fire and thirst. No. No scorpion, alas! Only a man&mdash;not
like you&mdash;therefore&mdash;a Mass&mdash;or two&mdash;perhaps...."</p>

<p>The freshness of the night penetrated through the arch, as far
as the faint twilight of the day. I heard his tearful muttering
creep away from my side. "Thirst&mdash;thirst&mdash;thirst." I did not stir;
and an incredulity, a weariness, the sense of our common fate,
mingled with an unconfessed desire&mdash;the desire of seeing what
would come of it&mdash;a desire that stirred my blood like a glimmer
of hope, and prevented me from making a movement or uttering a
whisper. If his sufferings were so great, who was I to... Mine,
too. I almost envied him. He was free.</p>

<p>As if an inward obscurity had parted in two I looked to the very
bottom of my thoughts. And his action appeared like a sacrifice.
It could liberate us two from this cave before it was too late.
He, he alone, was the prey they had trapped. They would be satisfied,
probably. Nay! There could be no doubt. Directly he was dead they
would depart. Ah! he wanted to leap. He must not be allowed. Now
that I understood perfectly what this meant, I had to prevent
him. There was no choice. I must stop him at any cost.</p>

<p>The awakening of my conscience sent me to my feet; but before
I had stumbled halfway through the passage I heard his shout in
the open air, "Behold me!"</p>

<p>A man outside cried excitedly, "He is out!"</p>

<p>An exulting tumult fell into the arch, the clash of twenty voices
yelling in different keys, "He is out&mdash;the traitor! He is out!"
I was too late, but I made three more hesitating steps and stood
blinded. The flaming branches they were holding over the precipice
showered a multitude of sparks, that fell disappearing continuously
in the lurid light, shutting out the night from the mouth of the
cave. And in this light Castro could be seen kneeling on the other
side of the sill.</p>

<p>With his fingers clutching the edge of the slab, he hung outwards,
his head falling back, his spine arched tensely, like a bow; and
the red sparks coming from above with the dancing whirl of snowflakes,
vanished in the air before they could settle on his face.</p>

<p>"Manuel! Manuel!"</p>

<p>They answered with a deep, confused growl, jostling and crowding
on the edge to look down into his eyes. Meantime I stared at the
convulsive heaving of his breast, at his upturned chin, his swelling
throat. He defied Manuel. He would leap. Behold! he was going
to leap&mdash;to his own death&mdash;in his own time. He challenged them
to come down on the ledge; and the blade of the maimed arm waved
to and fro stiffly, point up, like a red-hot weapon in the light.
He devoted them to pestilence, to English gallows, to the infernal
powers: while all the time commenting murmurs passed over his
head, as though he had extorted their sinister appreciation.</p>

<p>"<em>Canalla!</em> dogs, thieves, prey of death, vermin of hell
&mdash;I spit on you&mdash;like this!"</p>

<p>He had not the force, nor the saliva, and remained straining
mutely upwards while they laughed at him all together, with something
sombre, and as if doomed in their derision.... "He will jump!
No, he will not!"  "Yes! Leap, Castro! Spit, Castro!" "He will
run back into the cave! <em>Maladetta!</em>"... Manuel's voiced
cooed lovingly on the brink:</p>

<p>"Come to us and drink, Castro."</p>

<p>I waited for his leap with doubt, with disbelief, in the helpless
agitation of the weak. Gradually he seemed to relax all over.</p>

<p>"Drink deep; drink, and drink, and drink, Castro. Water. Clear
water, cool water. Taste, Castro!"</p>

<p>He called on him in tones that were almost tender in their urgency,
to come and drink before he died. His voice seemed to cast a spell,
like an incantation, upon the tubby little figure, with something
yearning in the upward turn of the listening face.</p>

<p>"Drink!" Manuel repeated the word several times; then, suddenly
he called, "Taste, Castro, taste," and a descending brightness,
as of a crystal rod hurled from above, shivered to nothing on
the upturned face. The light disappearing from before the cave
seemed scared away by the inhuman discord of his shriek; and I
flung myself forward to lick the splash of moisture on the sill.
I did not think of Castro, I had forgotten him. I raged at the
deception of my thirst, exploring with my tongue the rough surface
of the stone till I tasted my own blood. Only then, raising my
head to gasp, and clench my fists with a baffled and exasperated
desire, I noticed how profound was the silence, in which the words,
"Take away his sting," seemed to pronounce themselves over the
ravine in the impersonal austerity of the rock, and with the tone
of a tremendous decree.</p>
