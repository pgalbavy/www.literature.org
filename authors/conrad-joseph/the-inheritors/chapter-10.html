<p><em>NINE</em></p>

<p>I had a pretty bad night after that, and was not much in the
mood for Fox on the morrow. The sight of her had dwarfed everything;
the thought of her disgusted me with everything, made me out of
conceit with the world&mdash;with that part of the world that had become
my world. I wanted to get up into hers&mdash;and I could not see any
way. The room in which Fox sat seemed to be hopelessly off the
road&mdash;to be hopelessly off any road to any place; to be the end
of a blind alley. One day I might hope to occupy such a room&mdash;in
my shirt-sleeves, like Fox. But that was not the end of my career&mdash;not
the end that I desired. She had upset me.</p>

<p>"You've just missed Polehampton," Fox said; "wanted to get hold
of your 'Atmospheres.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn Polehampton," I said, "and particularly damn the 'Atmospheres.'"</p>

<p>"Willingly," Fox said, "but I told Mr. P. that you were willing
if...."</p>

<p>"I don't want to know," I repeated. "I tell you I'm sick of the
things."</p>

<p>"What a change," he asserted, sympathetically, "I <em>thought</em>
you would."</p>

<p>It struck me as disgusting that a person like Fox should think
about me at all. "Oh, I'll see it through," I said. "Who's the
next?"</p>

<p>"We've got to have the Duc de Mersch now," he answered, "De Mersch
as State Founder&mdash;written as large as you can&mdash;all across the
page. The moment's come and we've got to rope it in, that's all.
I've been middling good to you.... You understand...."</p>

<p>He began to explain in his dark sentences. The time had come
for an energetically engineered boom in de Mersch&mdash;a boom all
along the line. And I was to commence the campaign. Fox had been
good to me and I was to repay him. I listened in a sort of apathetic
indifference.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," I said. I was subconsciously aware that, as
far as I was concerned, the determining factor of the situation
was the announcement that de Mersch was to be in Paris. If he
had been in his own particular grand duchy I wouldn't have gone
after him. For a moment I thought of the interview as taking place
in London. But Fox&mdash;ostensibly, at least&mdash;wasn't even aware of
de Mersch's visit; spoke of him as being in Paris&mdash;in a flat in
which he was accustomed to interview the continental financiers
who took up so much of his time.</p>

<p>I realised that I wanted to go to Paris because she was there.
She had said that she was going to Paris on the morrow of yesterday.
The name was pleasant to me, and it turned the scale.</p>

<p>Fox's eyes remained upon my face.</p>

<p>"Do you good, eh?" he dimly interpreted my thoughts. "A run over.
I thought you'd like it and, look here, Polehampton's taken over
the <em>Bi-Monthly</em>; wants to get new blood into it, see?
He'd take something. I've been talking to him&mdash;a short series....
'Aspects.' That sort of thing." I tried to work myself into some
sort of enthusiasm of gratitude. I knew that Fox had spoken well
of me to Polehampton&mdash;as a sort of set off.</p>

<p>"You go and see Mr. P.," he confirmed; "it's really all arranged.
And then get off to Paris as fast as you can and have a good time."</p>

<p>"Have I been unusually cranky lately?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, you've been a little off the hooks, I thought, for the last
week or so."</p>

<p>He took up a large bottle of white mucilage, and I accepted it
as a sign of dismissal. I was touched by his solicitude for my
health. It always did touch me, and I found myself unusually broad-minded
in thought as I went down the terra-cotta front steps into the
streets. For all his frank vulgarity, for all his shirt-sleeves
&mdash;I somehow regarded that habit of his as the final mark
of the Beast&mdash;and the Louis Quinze accessories, I felt a warm
good-feeling for the little man.</p>

<p>I made haste to see Polehampton, to beard him in a sort of den
that contained a number of shelves of books selected for their
glittering back decoration. They gave the impression that Mr.
Polehampton wished to suggest to his visitors the fitness and
propriety of clothing their walls with the same gilt cloth. They
gave that idea, but I think that, actually, Mr. Polehampton took
an aesthetic delight in the gilding. He was not a publisher by
nature. He had drifted into the trade and success, but beneath
a polish of acquaintance retained a fine awe for a book as such.
In early life he had had such shining things on a shiny table
in a parlour. He had a similar awe for his daughter, who had been
born after his entry into the trade, and who had the literary
flavour&mdash;a flavour so pronounced that he dragged her by the heels
into any conversation with us who hewed his raw material, expecting,
I suppose, to cow us. For the greater good of this young lady
he had bought the <em>Bi-Monthly</em>&mdash;one of the portentous political
organs. He had, they said, ideas of forcing a seat out of the
party as a recompense.</p>

<p>It didn't matter much what was the nature of my series of articles.
I was to get the atmosphere of cities as I had got those of the
various individuals. I seemed to pay on those lines, and Miss
Polehampton commended me.</p>

<p>"My daughter likes ... eh ... your touch, you know, and...."
His terms were decent&mdash;for the man, and were offered with a flourish
that indicated special benevolence and a reference to the hundred
pounds. I was at a loss to account for his manner until he began
to stammer out an indication. Its lines were that I knew Fox,
and I knew Churchill and the Duc de Mersch, and the <em>Hour</em>.
"And those financial articles ... in the <em>Hour</em> ... were
they now?... <em>Were</em> they ... was the Trans -Greenland railway
actually ... did I think it would be worth one's while ... in
fact...." and so on.</p>

<p>I never was any good in a situation of that sort, never any good
at all. I ought to have assumed blank ignorance, but the man's
eyes pleaded; it seemed a tremendous matter to him. I tried to
be non-committal, and said: "Of course I haven't any right." But
I had a vague, stupid sense that loyalty to Churchill demanded
that I should back up a man he was backing. As a matter of fact,
nothing so direct was a-gate, it couldn't have been. It was something
about shares in one of de Mersch's other enterprises. Polehampton
was going to pick them up for nothing, and they were going to
rise when the boom in de Mersch's began&mdash;something of the sort.
And the boom would begin as soon as the news of the agreement
about the railway got abroad.</p>

<p>I let him get it out of me in a way that makes the thought of
that bare place with its gilt book-backs and its three uncomfortable
office-chairs and the ground-glass windows through which one read
the inversion of the legend "Polehampton," all its gloom and its
rigid lines and its pallid light, a memory of confusion. And Polehampton
was properly grateful, and invited me to dine with him and his
phantasmal daughter&mdash;who wanted to make my acquaintance. It was
like a command to a state banquet given by a palace official,
and Lea would be invited to meet me. Miss Polehampton did not
like Lea, but he had to be asked once a year&mdash;to encourage good
feeling, I suppose. The interview dribbled out on those lines.
I asked if it was one of Lea's days at the office. It was not.
I tried to put in a good word for Lea, but it was not very effective.
Polehampton was too subject to his assistant's thorns to be responsive
to praise of him.</p>

<p>So I hurried out of the place. I wanted to be out of this medium
in which my ineffectiveness threatened to proclaim itself to me.
It was not a very difficult matter. I had, in those days, rooms
in one of the political journalists' clubs&mdash;a vast mausoleum of
white tiles. But a man used to pack my portmanteau very efficiently
and at short notice. At the station one of those coincidences
that are not coincidences made me run against the great Callan.
He was rather unhappy&mdash;found it impossible to make an already
distracted porter listen to the end of one of his sentences with
two-second waits between each word. For that reason he brightened
to see me&mdash;was delighted to find a through-journey companion who
would take him on terms of greatness. In the railway carriage,
divested of troublesome bags that imparted anxiety to his small
face and a stagger to his walk, he swelled to his normal dimensions.</p>

<p>"So you're&mdash;going to &mdash;Paris," he meditated, "for the <em>Hour</em>."</p>

<p>"I'm going to Paris for the <em>Hour</em>," I agreed.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he went on, "you're going to interview the Elective Grand
Duke...."</p>

<p>"We call him the Duc de Mersch," I interrupted, flippantly. It
was a matter of nuances. The Elective Grand Duke was a philanthropist
and a State Founder, the Duc de Mersch was the hero as financier.</p>

<p>"Of Holstein-Launewitz," Callan ignored. The titles slipped over
his tongue like the last drops of some inestimable oily vintage.</p>

<p>"I might have saved you the trouble. I'm going to see him myself."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em>," I italicised. It struck me as phenomenal and
rather absurd that everybody that I came across should, in some
way or other, be mixed up with this portentous philanthropist.
It was as if a fisherman were drawing in a ground line baited
with hundreds of hooks. He had a little offended air.</p>

<p>"He, or, I should say, a number of people interested in a philanthropic
society, have asked me to go to Greenland."</p>

<p>"Do they want to get rid of you?" I asked, flippantly. I was
made to know my place.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," Callan said, in his most deliberate, most Olympian
tone. "I believe you're entirely mistaken, I believe ... I've
been informed that the Système Groënlandais is one of the healthiest
places in the Polar regions. There are interested persons who...."</p>

<p>"So I've heard," I interrupted, "but I can assure you I've heard
nothing but good of the Système and the ... and its philanthropists.
I meant nothing against them. I was only astonished that you should
go to such a place."</p>

<p>"I have been asked to go upon a mission," he explained, seriously,
"to ascertain what the truth about the Système really is. It is
a new country with, I am assured, a great future in store. A great
deal of English money has been invested in its securities, and
naturally great interest is taken in its affairs."</p>

<p>"So it seems," I said, "I seem to run upon it at every hour of
the day and night."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," Callan rhapsodised, "it has a great future in store,
a great future. The Duke is a true philanthropist. He has taken
infinite pains&mdash;infinite pains. He wished to build up a model
state, <em>the</em> model protectorate of the world, a place where
perfect equality shall obtain for all races, all creeds, and all
colours. You would scarcely believe how he has worked to ensure
the happiness of the native races. He founded the great society
to protect the Esquimaux, the Society for the Regeneration of
the Arctic Regions&mdash;the <em>S.R.A.R.&mdash;</em>as you called it, and
now he is only waiting to accomplish his greatest project&mdash;the
Trans-Greenland railway. When that is done, he will hand over
the Système to his own people. That is the act of a great man."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," I said.</p>

<p>"Well," Callan began again, but suddenly paused. "By-the-bye,
this must go no farther," he said, anxiously, "I will let you
have full particulars when the time is ripe."</p>

<p>"My dear Callan," I said, touchily, "I can hold my tongue."</p>

<p>He went off at tangent.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to take my word &mdash;I haven't seen it yet.
But I feel assured about it myself. The most distinguished people
have spoken to me in its favour. The celebrated traveller, Aston,
spoke of it with tears in his eyes. He was the first governor-general,
you know. Of course I should not take any interest in it, if I
were not satisfied as to that. It is percisely because I feel
that the thing is one of the finest monuments of a grand century
that I am going to lend it the weight of my pen."</p>

<p>"I quite understand," I assured him; then, solicitously, "I hope
they don't expect you to do it for nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no," Callan answered.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, I wish you luck," I said. "They couldn't have got
a better man to win over the National conscience. I suppose it
comes to that."</p>

<p>Callan nodded.</p>

<p>"I fancy I have the ear of the public," he said. He seemed to
get satisfaction from the thought.</p>

<p>The train entered Folkestone Harbour. The smell of the sea and
the easy send of the boat put a little heart into me, but my spirits
were on the down grade. Callan was a trying companion. The sight
of him stirred uneasy emotions, the sound of his voice jarred.</p>

<p>"Are you coming to the Grand?" he said, as we passed St. Denis.</p>

<p>"My God, no," I answered, hotly, "I'm going across the river."</p>

<p>"Ah," he murmured, "the Quartier Latin. I wish I could come with
you. But I've my reputation to think of. You'd be surprised how
people get to hear of my movements. Besides, I'm a family man."</p>

<p>I was agitatedly silent. The train steamed into the glare of
the electric lights, and, getting into a fiacre, I breathed again.
I seemed to be at the entrance of a new life, a better sort of
paradise, during that drive across the night city. In London one
is always a passenger, in Paris one has reached a goal. The crowds
on the pavements, under the plane-trees, in the black shadows,
in the white glare of the open spaces, are at leisure&mdash;they go
nowhere, seek nothing beyond.</p>

<p>We crossed the river, the unwinking towers of Notre Dame towering
pallidly against the dark sky behind us; rattled into the new
light of the resuming boulevard; turned up a dark street, and
came to a halt before a half-familiar shut door. You know how
one wakes the sleepy concierge, how one takes one's candle, climbs
up hundreds and hundreds of smooth stairs, following the slipshod
footfalls of a half-awakened guide upward through Rembrandt's
own shadows, and how one's final sleep is sweetened by the little
inconveniences of a strange bare room and of a strange hard bed.</p>
