<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It had been decided that Giuseppe Nicoli was to live at the stone
house and be educated as the Lilac Lady's protégé.</p>

<p>The Humane Society had thoroughly investigated the case and found
that the poor little waif was an orphan, whom greedy-eyed Petri
had taken in charge on account of his unusual musical talent.
There were no relatives on this side of the water to claim the
homeless lad, and those in old Italy were too poor to be burdened
with his keep; so the Society gladly listened to the lame girl's
plea, and gave Giuseppe into her keeping.</p>

<p>It would be hard to tell which was the more jubilant over his
good fortune, the child himself, or Peace, who was never tired
of rehearsing the story of his rescue from the brutal organ-grinder's
clutches. So the minute she knew that the big house was to be
his future home, she raced off to the corner drug store to telephone
the good news to Allee and the rest at home, who were much interested
in the doings at the little parsonage, and only regretted that
the Hill Street Church was not yet able to afford a telephone
of its own, for Peace could make only one trip daily to the drug
store, and often the girls thought of something else they wanted
to ask her after she had rung off. Also, the drug clerk was sometimes
impolite enough to tell Peace that she was talking too long, and
that does leave one so embarrassed.</p>

<p>This day, however, he had no occasion for uttering a word of
complaint, for after a surprised exclamation and three or four
rapid questions of the speaker at the other end of the line, Peace
banged the receiver on its hook, and turned rebellious eyes on
the idle clerk lolling behind the counter, saying, "Now, what
do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"What?" drawled the man, who was in his element when he could
tease someone. "Do you take me for a mind reader?"</p>

<p>"I sh'd say not!" she answered crossly. "It takes folks with
brains to read other folks' minds."</p>

<p>"Whew!" he whistled, delighted with the encounter. "Your claws
are out today. What seems to be the matter?"</p>

<p>"Grandpa has taken grandma and the little girls to the Pine Woods
without so much as saying a word to me about it; and Gail and
Faith have gone to the lake with the Sherrars and never invited
me."</p>

<p>"If the whole family is away, who is keeping house?"</p>

<p>"Gussie and Marie, of course. Who'd you s'pose? Grandma told
Gussie that when I called up she was to 'xplain matters to me
so's I'd understand how it all happened and not feel bad about
their going off. Gail and Faith went first. I 'xpected that part
of it, but none of 'em ever hinted a word to me about the Pine
Woods. I s'pose they've lived so long without me at home that
they've got used to it and so don't care any more about me."</p>

<p>Two tears stole out from under the twitching lids and rolled
down the chubby cheeks. The clerk moved uneasily. He did hate
to see anyone cry, but had not the slightest idea how to avert
the threatened deluge. As his eye roved about the small store
for something to divert her attention, it chanced to rest upon
the candy cabinet, and hastily diving into the case, he brought
forth a handful of tempting chocolates, and presented them with
the tactful remark, "Aw, you're cross; have some candy to sweeten
you up!"</p>

<p>The brown eyes winked away the tears and blazed scornfully up
at the face above her. "Keep it yourself! You need it!" she growled
savagely, pushing the extended hand away from her so fiercely
that the candy was scattered all about the floor, and without
a backward glance, she flounced out of the store.</p>

<p>"Well, I vum!" exclaimed the astonished clerk. "Next time I'll
let her bawl." Stooping over to collect the hapless chocolate
drops before they should be tramped upon, he began to whistle,
and the notes followed Peace out on the street&mdash;just a bar of
her sunshine song, but the woe-begone face brightened a bit, although
the girl said to herself, "Oh, dear, seems 'sif that song chases
me wherever I go. I get it sung or whistled or spoke at me a dozen
times a day. And it's hard work always to remember it, 'specially
when folks go off and forget all about you when you've just been
counting the <em>days</em> till 'twas time to go home and see
Allee and grandpa after being away so long. S'posing I should
die 'fore they get back, I wonder how they'll feel. Why, Peace
Greenfield, you hateful little tike! Ain't you ashamed of yourself?
Yes, I am. Of course they didn't run away a-purpose. Grandpa didn't
know he had to go until an hour 'fore the train went, and there
wasn't time to send for me and get my clo'es ready to go, too.
It was awful nice of him to think of taking the girls and grandma
to the Pine Woods to get real well and rested while he did up
his business in Dolliver. They'll come back lots better than they'd
be if they had to stay here through all this hot.</p>

<p>"Think of being shut up three months in the house so's they couldn't
plant gardens or go flower-hunting, or have picnics, or even go
to school! I've been doing all those things while they've been
sick. I'm truly 'shamed of myself to be so cross about their going
off. Elizabeth and Saint John are just the dearest people to me,
and the Lilac Lady really cried tears in her eyes when she thought
I was going to leave here Monday. She'll be glad to know that
I am to stay two or three weeks longer. And it will be such fun
to get letters from the girls in the woods all the while they
are gone. After all, I b'lieve I'll have a better time here anyway."</p>

<p>The cloud had passed over without the threatened storm, and the
round face, though still a little sober, looked quite contented
again. But during this silent soliloquy, the young philosopher
had been wandering aimlessly through the streets, without any
thought of the direction she was taking, and was suddenly roused
from her revery by the mingled shouts and laughter of a throng
of boys and girls playing noisily in a great yard fenced in by
tall iron pickets.</p>

<p>"Why, school is closed for the summer!" murmured Peace to herself,
pressing her face against the iron bars in order that she might
watch the lively games on the other side of the palings. "Elizabeth
says all the Martindale schools close at the same time. What can
these children be doing here then? P'raps this is where the old
lady who lived in a shoe had to move to when the shoe got too
small for her fambly. Do you s'pose it is?"</p>

<p>"Yup, I guess that's how it happened," answered a voice close
beside her, and she jumped almost out of her shoes in her surprise,
for unconsciously she had spoken her thoughts aloud, and a merry-faced
urchin, sprawled in the shade of a low-limbed box-elder, had answered
her. His peal of delight at having startled her so brought another
lad and two girls to see the cause of his glee, and Peace was
shocked to behold in the smaller of the girls her own double,
only the stranger child was dressed in a long blue apron, which
made her look much older than she really was. As the children
stood staring at each other through the close-set pickets, the
boy in the grass discovered the likeness of the two faces, and
with a startled whoop sat up to ask excitedly of Peace, "Did you
ever have a twin?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I was sure you must have! You're just the <em>yimage</em>
of Lottie. She's a <em>norphan</em>, and the folks that brought
her here didn't even know what her real name was or anything about
her, and we've always 'magined that some day her truly people
would come and find her and she'd have a mother of her own."</p>

<p>"Is this a&mdash;a school?" asked Peace. She wanted to say orphan
asylum, but was afraid it would be impolite, and she did not wish
to offend any of these friendly appearing children.</p>

<p>"It's the Children's Home."</p>

<p>"Who owns it?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er &mdash;I don't know," stammered the second youth, who
seemed the oldest of the quartette inside the fence.</p>

<p>"I guess the splintered ladies do," remarked the cherub in the
grass.</p>

<p>"The wh-at?"</p>

<p>"Tony's trying to be smart now," said the larger girl scornfully.
"The Lady Board is meeting today, and he always calls them the
splintered ladies."</p>

<p>"What is a Lady Board?" inquired mystified Peace, thinking this
was the queerest home she had ever heard tell of.</p>

<p>"Why, they are the ladies who say how things shall be done here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The number of times we can have butter each week and how much
milk each of us can drink, and the number of potatoes the cook
shall fix," put in the boy called Tony.</p>

<p>"Don't you have butter every day!" cried Peace in shocked surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess not! We have it Sunday noons and sometimes holiday
nights."</p>

<p>"And we never have sugar on our oatmeal, or sauce to eat with
our bread," added Lottie, shaking her curls dolefully.</p>

<p>"What do you eat, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, bread and milk, and mush of some kind, or rice, and potatoes
and vegetables and meat once a week and pie or pudding real seldom."</p>

<p>"Who takes care of you?" asked Peace again after a slight pause.</p>

<p>"The matron and nurses."</p>

<p>"What's a matron?"</p>

<p>"The boss of the caboose," grinned Tony irreverently.</p>

<p>"Is she nice?"</p>

<p>"That's what we're waiting to find out. She's just come, you
see, and we don't know her real well yet. The other one was a
holy fright."</p>

<p>"But the new one <em>looks</em> nice," said Lottie loyally. "She
smiles all the time, and Miss Cooper never did. She always looked
froze."</p>

<p>"She must be like Miss Peyton. She was my teacher at Chestnut
School and I didn't like her a bit till the day school ended.
She did get thawed out then, though, and I b'lieve she'll be nicer
after this."</p>

<p>"Do you live near here?" asked Tony, thinking it was their turn
to ask questions of this debonair little stranger, who evidently
belonged to rich people, because her brown curls were tied back
with a huge pink ribbon, a dainty white pinafore covered her pretty
gingham dress, and her feet were shod in patent leather slippers.</p>

<p>"No, grandpa's house is three miles away, but I am staying at
the Hill Street parsonage." Briefly she explained how it had all
come about, and the story seemed like a fairy tale to the four
eager listeners.</p>

<p>"Then you are an orphan, too," cried Tony triumphantly, when
she had finished. "How do you know Lottie ain't your twin sister?"</p>

<p>"'Cause there never were any twins in our family, and if there
had been, do you s'pose mother'd have let one loose like that,
to get put in a Children's Home? I guess not!"</p>

<p>"Maybe she's a cousin, then."</p>

<p>"We haven't got any. Papa was the only child Grandpa Greenfield
had, and mother's only brother died when he was little."</p>

<p>"But Lottie's just the <em>yimage</em> of you," insisted Tony,
bent on discovering some tie of relationship between the two.</p>

<p>"I can't help that. I guess it's just a queerity, though I'd
like to find out I had some sure-enough cousins which I didn't
know anything about. Besides, Lottie is lots darker than me. Her
hair is black and so are her eyes. Least I guess they are what
you'd call black. Mine are only brown."</p>

<p>"You're the same size. Ain't they, Ethel?" asked the older lad.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was what I was thinking. I don't believe many folks
would know them apart if they changed clothes."</p>

<p>"Oh, let's do it!" cried Peace, charmed with the suggestion.
"We've got a book at home that tells how a little beggar boy changed
places with a prince, and they had the strangest 'xperiences!
It'll be lots of fun to fool the others. They haven't been paying
any 'tention to our talking here. Where's the gate?"</p>

<p>"At the other side of the yard. There's only one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But visitors aren't allowed to come and play with us without
a permit from the matron," began the larger boy, cautiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother, George," Tony cried impatiently. "We can't get a
permit now with all the Lady Boards here, and you know it."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Peace.</p>

<p>"'Cause Miss Chase is busy with them in the parlors and we can't
see her till they are gone."</p>

<p>"How long will that be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hours, maybe."</p>

<p>"Then I'll come in now and get my permit later."</p>

<p>Without waiting to hear what comments they might have to make
about this plan, she flew around the corner Tony had indicated
a moment before, and in through the great iron gates, standing
slightly ajar. Following the wide walks leading from the front
yard to the back, she came to another lower gate, where Ethel
and Lottie met her; and in a jiffy the white apron was exchanged
for the long, blue pinafore of the black-eyed child.</p>

<p>"You'll have to give her your hair-ribbon, too," said Ethel,
surveying the two figures critically. "We don't wear ribbons here
on common days, and that would give away that you weren't really
Lottie."</p>

<p>Peace gleefully jerked off her rampant pink bow, and the older
girl deftly tied it among the raven locks of the other orphan.</p>

<p>Tony and George now came slowly around the corner of the building,
to discover whether the visitor had really kept her promise, and
were themselves puzzled to know which was their mate and which
the stranger child until Peace laughed. "That's where you are
different," said George, critically. "You don't sound a bit alike.
Come on and see who will be first to find out the secret."</p>

<p>So the masqueraders were led laughingly away to meet the other
children, still boisterously playing at games under the trees.
It did not take the fifty pair of sharp eyes as long to discover
the difference as the five plotters had hoped, but they were all
just as charmed with the result, and gave Peace a royal time.
She was a natural leader and her lively imagination delighted
her new playmates. But Lottie, in her borrowed finery, received
scant attention, and being, unfortunately, rather a spoiled child,
she resented the fact that Peace had usurped her place. So she
retired to the fence and pouted. At first no one noticed her sullen
looks, but finally Ethel missed her, and finding her standing
cross and glum in the corner, she tried to draw her into the lively
game of last couple out, which the stranger had organized.</p>

<p>"I won't play at all," declared the jealous girl. "No one cares
whether I'm here or not, and 's long as you'd rather have <em>her</em>,
you can just have her!"</p>

<p>"But we wouldn't rather," fibbed the older girl. "She's our comp'ny
and we have to be nice to her."</p>

<p>"'Cause you like her better'n you do me," insisted the other.</p>

<p>"No such thing! Come on and see!"</p>

<p>"I won't, either!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Peace, hearing the excited voices
and stepping out of line to learn the cause.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lottie's spunky," answered Ethel carelessly, turning back
to join her companions.</p>

<p>"I'm not! You horrid thing, take that!" Out shot one little hand
and the sharp nails dug vicious, cruel scratches down Ethel's
cheek.</p>

<p>"You cat!" cried Peace, horrified at the uncalled-for act, and
springing at the white-aproned figure, she caught her by the shoulder,
and shook her till her teeth rattled. Lottie doubled up like a
jack-knife and buried her sharp teeth in the brown hand gripping
her so tightly, biting so viciously that the blood ran and Peace
screamed with pain.</p>

<p>Frightened at the sight of the two girls clinched in battle,
the other children danced excitedly about the yard and shrieked
wildly. Tony even started for the matron, but remembered the Lady
Board meeting, and flew instead for the new cook, busy preparing
refreshments for the distinguished visitors, gasping out as he
stumbled into the kitchen, "Oh, come quick! There's a strange
girl in the yard and Lottie's chewing her into shoe-strings!"</p>

<p>Bridget was new at the business, or she would never have meddled
in the affair. Glancing out of the window, she saw what looked
to be a small riot in the corner, and knowing that the matron
and her assistants were engaged with their visitors in the other
wing of the building, she dropped her plate of sandwiches, and
rushed to the rescue as fast as her avoirdupois would permit.
She was familiar enough with the rules of the institution to know
that the Home children did not wear white aprons and pink hair-ribbons
except on special occasions, and also that fighting was severely
punished. It never occurred to her that the matron was the proper
authority to whom to report trouble. She made a lunge for the
two struggling children, jerked them apart, shook them impartially,
and blazed out in rich, Irish brogue, "Ye dirty spalpeens, phwat
d'ye mane by sich disorderly conduct? It'll be a long toime afore
ye'll iver git inside this fince again to play, ye black-eyed
miss! Make tracks now or I'll call the p'lice! You, ye little
beggar, march straight inter the house! The matron'll settle with
ye good and plenty whin she gits toime!"</p>

<p>Both girls tried to explain, and the frightened, excited Home
children shouted in vain. Irish Bridget seized the resisting Lottie,
thrust her forcibly out through the gate, and hustled poor Peace
into the dark entry, in spite of her protests and frantic kicking.
"I'm not Lottie, I'm not Lottie!" she wailed. "I don't b'long
here, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"I don't care if ye're Lottie or Lillie," screamed the angry
cook, pinioning the struggling child and carrying her bodily up
a short flight of stairs into a wide hall. "Ye've been breaking
the rules by fightin' and in that room ye go! The matron'll settle
with ye afther a bit. An' ye'll catch it good, too, if ye kape
on screeching loike that."</p>

<p>Peace was dumped into a small, office-like apartment, the key
turned in the lock, and she was left alone. Frantic with excitement
and fear, she let out three or four piercing screams, rattled
the knob, and pounded the door until her fists were sore, but
no one came to release her, and after a few moments she seemed
to realize how useless it was to expect help from that quarter.
She looked around her prison hopefully, curiously, for some other
avenue of escape. A window stood open across the room, but the
screen was fastened so tightly that she could not move it even
when she threw her whole weight upon it. Besides, it was a long
way to the ground below. Would she dare jump if the screen were
not in her way?</p>

<p>Then her restless eyes spied the telephone on the desk behind
her, and with a shriek of triumph she seized the receiver and
called breathlessly over the wire, "Hello, central! Give me the
drug store where I telephone every day. Number? I don't know the
number. It's on Hill Street and Twenty-ninth Avenue. What information
do you want? Well, I've thunk of the drug store's name now. It's
Teeter's Pharmacy, and it's on the corner &mdash;Well, I'm giving
you the information 's fast as I can. My name is Peace Greenfield,
and the crazy cook's taken me for someone else and shut me in
when I don't b'long to this Home at all. I changed clothes with&mdash;well,
what is the matter now? If you'll give me that drug store &mdash;Teeter's
Pharmacy, corner of Hill Street and Twenty-ninth Avenue, &mdash;I'll
have them go after Saint John, so's he can come and get me out
of here. <em>A&mdash;</em>what? Policeman? Are you a p'liceman? No,
I ain't one, and I don't want one! Do you s'pose I want to be
'rested for getting bit? Oh, dear, I don't know what you are trying
to say! Ain't you central? Then why don't you give me Teeter's
Pharmacy, corner of Hill Street and&mdash;now she's clicked her old
machine up! Oh, how will I ever get out of here?"</p>

<p>Dismayed to find that central had deserted her, she puckered
her face to cry, but at that moment there were hasty steps in
the hall, a key grated in the lock, and the door flew open, showing
a startled, white-faced woman and frightened Tony in the doorway,
while a whole string of curious-eyed ladies were gathered in the
hall behind them.</p>

<p>Silently Peace stared from one to another, and then as no one
offered to speak, she asked, "Where's the cook? Have you seen
her lately?"</p>

<p>"No," laughed the matron, very evidently relieved at her reception.
"Tony tells me that a mistake has been made and that you don't
belong to the Home."</p>

<p>"He is right, I'm thankful to say," returned Peace with such
a comical, grown-up air that the ladies in the hall giggled and
nudged each other, and one of them ventured to ask, "Why?"</p>

<p>"Just think of having to live here day after day without any
butter on your bread, or gravy for your potatoes, or sugar in
your oatmeal, without any pies or cakes or puddings 'cept on Sundays
and special holidays,&mdash;with only mush, mush, mush all the time,
and not even all the milk you wanted, maybe! Hm! I'm glad I live
in a house where there ain't any Lady Boards to tell us what we
have to do and what we can have to eat. Come to think of it, I'm
part of a <em>norphan</em> 'sylum, really. There's six of us at
Grandpa Campbell's but he doesn't bring us up on mush. We have
all the butter and sugar and gravy and pudding and sauce that
we want&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This isn't an orphan asylum," said the matron kindly, wondering
what kind of a creature this queer child was, but already convinced
that Bridget had blundered, in spite of her startling resemblance
to Lottie.</p>

<p>"It isn't? What do you call it then?"</p>

<p>"It is a Home for the purpose of taking care of children who
have one or both parents living, but who, for some reason, cannot
be taken care of in their own homes for a time."</p>

<p>"Oh! Then you take the place of mother to them?"</p>

<p>"I try to."</p>

<p>"Do you like your job?"</p>

<p>"Very, very much!"</p>

<p>"You do sound 'sif you did, but I sh'd think you'd hate to sit
all those little children down to butterless bread and gravyless
potato and sugarless mush. Oh, I forgot! That ain't your fault.
It's the Lady Board which says what you have to feed your children.
Did you ever ask them&mdash;the ladies, I mean&mdash;to be common visitors
and eat just what the rest of you had? I bet if you'd just try
that, they'd soon send you something different! I don't see how
you stay so fat and rosy with&mdash;but then you've only just come,
haven't you? I s'pose there's lots of time to get thin in. I wonder
if that's what is the matter with Lottie," Peace chattered relentlessly
on. "She is awfully ugly today; but then I'd be, too, if I had
to live on such grub. It's worse than we had at the little brown
house in Parker&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you will slip off that apron and come with me," interrupted
the matron desperately, not daring to look at the faces of her
dismayed "Lady Board," "we will find Lottie and get your own clothes
so you can go home. The next time you come, be sure to get a permit
first. Then this trouble won't happen again."</p>

<p>"Oh, will you let me come some more?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you Dr. Campbell's granddaughter? Tony said you were."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's my adopted grandpa now."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Campbell is interested in the Home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is she a splinter?"</p>

<p>"A <em>what</em>?"</p>

<p>Tony giggled and dodged behind the matron to hide his tell-tale
face, and Peace, remembering Ethel's explanation, said hastily,
"I mean a piece of the Lady's Board?"</p>

<p>"No, she is not one of the Board of Directors, if that is what
you mean; but she often sends the children little treats&mdash;candy
and nuts at Christmas time, or flowers from the greenhouse after
the summer blossoms are gone."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. She told me one time that she would take us to visit
the Children's Home, but I didn't know it was this. We've got
scarlet fever at our house&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Child alive! What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I ain't got it, and anyway, I haven't been home since our
spring vacation in March. I am staying with Saint John, the new
preacher at Hill Street Church, and I 'xpect if I don't get home
pretty soon, he'll think I am lost, sure. I went down to the drug
store to telephone grandma, and when Gussie told me they had gone
to the Pine Woods, I was so mad for a time that I just boiled
over. So I walked on and on till I came to this place. I never
have been so far before, and I didn't know there was such a Home
around here. I know they'll let me come often. There aren't many
children up our way to play with and sometimes it gets lonesome.
There's Lottie now! Cook must have found out that I knew what
I was talking about. Here's your apron, Lottie; and say, I'm awful
sorry I shook you. Will you pretend I didn't do it, and be friends
with me again?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I bit you," stammered the child, as much astonished
at this greeting as were the matron and the "Lady Board," who
still lingered in the hall, fascinated with this frank creature,
who so fearlessly voiced her own opinions of their work.</p>

<p>"So you did!" exclaimed Peace, in genuine surprise, glancing
down at the ugly, purple bruise on her hand, which she had completely
forgotten. "Well, I won't remember that any more, either. Two
folks which look so much alike ought to be friends, and I want
you to like me."</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>do&mdash;like you," faltered the embarrassed child. "I'm
sorry I was hateful. Here are your apron and ribbon."</p>

<p>"Keep the ribbon," responded Peace generously. "I s'pose I've
got to take the apron back, 'cause grandpa says I mustn't give
away my clothes without asking him or grandma about it, and I
can't now, 'cause they are both gone away. But a hair-ribbon ain't
clothes, and, anyway, that's one Frances Sherrar gave me, so I
know you can have it." She pressed the pink bow back into Lottie's
hand, and throwing both arms around her, kissed her fervently,
saying, "I am coming again some time soon, and I'll bring you
a bag of sugar and some real butter so's you can have it extra
for once, even if the Lady Boards didn't order it for that p'tic'lar
day. Good-bye, Mrs. Matron, and Tony, and&mdash;all the rest. I've
had a good time here&mdash;till I run up against the cook, I mean.
Mercy! She's strong! But I'm glad grandpa adopted us so's I didn't
have to come here to live." She waved her hand gaily at them,
and danced away down the walk, whistling cheerily.</p>

<p>"She's a quaint child!" murmured the lady who had questioned
her.</p>

<p>"She's a trump!" declared Tony to Lottie, as they departed together
for the playgrounds.</p>

<p>And in her heart the matron whispered, "She's a darling!"</p>
