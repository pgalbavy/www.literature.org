<p>Twilight had come when Harvey Hamilton, with Bohunkus Johnson
seated behind him, descended in the same spot in Chesterton that
he had used upon his disastrous visit of the night before. A similar
crowd greeted him, and he hired several of their number to drag
the aeroplane to the primitive hangar in which the wrecked one
had been sheltered.</p>

<p>He learned that Paul Mitchell had shipped the engine and other
valuable parts to Garden City, while the shattered framework had
been piled to one side to serve as kindling wood for the hotel.
Thus vanished one aeroplane to be succeeded speedily by another.
Harvey announced that he intended to stay until the morrow. He
first engaged two reliable men, upon the recommendation of the
landlord, to stay by the machine all night, with instructions
to challenge any one who approached and to shoot if necessary.</p>

<p>"We’ll likely shoot first and challenge afterward," remarked
one with a grin; "I only hope the same fellow will try his hand
on this that splintered t’other one."</p>

<p>Nine guests were at supper, that being the name of the meal which
was served at the close of the day. One of them was Simmons Pendar,
who hardly glanced in the direction of Harvey Hamilton seated
opposite. The youth made no attempt to catch his eye, though aware
that the detective glanced at him several times. When certain
the action would be observed, the young aviator committed a breach
of decorum by deliberately scratching his head with one hand.
While this was not the precise telegram that had been agreed upon
the night before, it was sufficiently to the point, and Harvey
was confident it had accomplished its purpose.</p>

<p>The two lads lingered at the table after Pendar and most of the
others had left the dining hall. Then they strolled outside on
the porch, where by that time the full moon was shining in an
unclouded sky. The air was so balmy and soft that few lingered
indoors. The gas had been lighted in the sitting-room to which
Harvey sauntered, and mosquitoes and other insects hovered in
the glare. Three men were seated in lounging positions, one smoking
a cigarette, while the others nodded as if yielding to drowsiness.
Harvey identified two as having been present when the bit of paper
was flipped upon the pad he was using for his crude sketches.
The three looked like drummers, but a couple were distinctively
foreign in appearance. One had a black curled mustache, with eyes
and hair of midnight hue, a second was almost as dark, while the
third was an unmistakable blond. They appeared to be unacquainted
with one another, but Harvey was almost certain that two if not
the three were the men who were watching Pendar while he in turn
was keeping them under scrutiny. The officer, however, was nowhere
to be seen and the youth did not think it prudent to make any
search for him.</p>

<p>"I think I’ll go to my room," he remarked, rising to his feet
with a yawn; "we have had a pretty strenuous day and shall want
to leave early to-morrow."</p>

<p>"All right," grunted Bohunkus; "I feels sorter sleepy myself,
and if dese blamed ’skeeters don’t lebe me alone I’ll tumble into
bed likewise."</p>

<p>As Harvey passed out of the door, he carelessly lifted his cap
and scratched his head, thus making the full signal previously
arranged. He still failed to see the detective and doubted whether
he was near.</p>

<p>The youth did not light the gas in his room, though he lacked
the pretext of wishing to keep out the insects, since each window
was furnished with a screen. He sat down and listened.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, without the slightest preliminary warning,
a soft, almost inaudible tap sounded on the door. He drew it noiselessly
inward, and recognized the form of Detective Pendar against the
soft yellow background. Neither spoke at first. The caller shoved
the door shut and with extreme care turned the key. Then he whispered:</p>

<p>"Let’s take the other side of the room."</p>

<p>Carrying their chairs thither they placed them side by side.
Enough illumination came through the transom for them dimly to
discern each other.</p>

<p>"You caught on at the table?" remarked Harvey inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Of course; I noticed your signal, too, when you walked out of
the sitting-room."</p>

<p>"Where were you?"</p>

<p>"On the porch, with my eyes on you. I knew you wished to speak
with me, but I preferred first to receive your notice."</p>

<p>"I caught your wink to-day when about to start off with my new
machine, but I couldn’t guess what you meant."</p>

<p>"I meant nothing except to wish you good luck; of course I was
aware what you had set out to do and I shall be glad to know what
success you met."</p>

<p>"Far better than I expected; I found the place."</p>

<p>"You mean where the little girl is held a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Harvey was surprised that the detective did not show excitement
over the news. He remained cool and deliberate and spoke in low-toned
words as before.</p>

<p>"Then you saw the child?"</p>

<p>"No, but I sailed over the house."</p>

<p>"How do you know the child is there?"</p>

<p>"Bohunkus, my colored companion, saw her just after we had passed
and waved his cap in reply to her salutation with her handkerchief."</p>

<p>"Did he see any of the men?"</p>

<p>"No; they kept out of sight, at least so long as we could have
seen them."</p>

<p>"How did your boy describe the girl?"</p>

<p>"He didn’t describe her," replied Harvey, a bit chagrined over
the pointed questions, "except to say she was a little girl."</p>

<p>"Didn’t tell how she was dressed or how old she appeared to be?
The last might have been hard to answer, but he should have noticed
her apparel."</p>

<p>"Probably he did, but I did not think of asking him."</p>

<p>"It was hardly necessary," remarked the detective, as if regretting
his incisive queries. "Now, if you will be good enough to locate
the spot I shall be infinitely obliged."</p>

<p>Harvey was able to do this with so much accuracy that his friend
complimented him.</p>

<p>"You have done remarkably well; if we succeed in restoring the
child to her parents, much of the credit will be due you. I know
the exact spot and can go to it without trouble."</p>

<p>"Will you do so?"</p>

<p>"I shall make the effort, but I am in a delicate situation. You
noticed those three men in the sitting-room when you were there
a little while ago. Two are members of the Black Hand and are
acting as scouts."</p>

<p>"I set down all three as being such."</p>

<p>"The blond has nothing to do with the others. He is a genuine
commercial traveler for a Philadelphia clothing house and will
leave to-morrow. It is the others who belong to the worst gang
in the country."</p>

<p>"Do you think they have any suspicion of me?"</p>

<p>Detective Pendar chuckled softly.</p>

<p>"Why should they? You have not given the first cause."</p>

<p>"But they suspect you?"</p>

<p>"I can say I have reason to hope not; I have behaved so well
and sold so much hardware stuff in this town that they ought to
believe I am what I pretend to be."</p>

<p>"What further help can I give you, Mr. Pendar?"</p>

<p>"None, so far as I see at this moment. But you mustn’t minimize
your share; the location of the prison is a great and invaluable
exploit of itself."</p>

<p>"What will you next do?"</p>

<p>"It is impossible to say, so much depends upon circumstances
as they develop."</p>

<p>This answer was so vague that it reminded Harvey he was asking
questions which he had not the right to ask. The man before him
was a professional detective, whose calling required him to be
secretive. While such persons often reveal their secrets in stories,
they are the last ones in the world to do so in real life.</p>

<p>"I need not remind you," he continued, "not to drop a hint of
these matters to your colored companion."</p>

<p>"I shall not forget your warning on that point. He means well,
but in some respects he is as stupid as a child of five years.
What do you think?" asked Harvey with a light laugh, "he asked
me to start with him and the aeroplane for Africa to call on his
father, Chief Bohunkus Foozleum."</p>

<p>"He may make the journey yet," was the remarkable response of
the detective.</p>

<p>"Do you think it possible?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, but it isn’t safe to declare anything impossible in
our twentieth century. This navigation of the air will make miraculous
advancements in the next ten years. Well," abruptly added the
caller, "if the coast is clear, I must bid you good night."</p>

<p>"When shall I see you again?" asked Harvey.</p>

<p>"Will you return to Chesterton to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Is it advisable?"</p>

<p>"I see no objection to your doing so. If you do, and I am here,
we may signal each other as before. I’ll raise my hat and scratch
my head as notice that I wish to have a talk with you in your
room, and you will do the same with me if necessary. Please keep
your seat."</p>

<p>Harvey saw the dim figure move across the room like a shadow.
Pendar waited two or three minutes with his hand on the knob,
as if he had heard something, though the listening youth did not
detect the slightest sound. Then the door opened as noiselessly
as before and he vanished into the hall, leaving the same dead
quiet behind him.</p>

<p>Harvey waited some time before preparing for bed. Then he gave
expression to his impatience with himself:</p>

<p>"He got everything I knew about this business from me, and I
didn’t worm a single fact from him. I meant to ask his opinion
of the wrecking of my machine, how father learned so early of
it, what course Pendar means to follow, and lots of other things,
but I know no more than before he came into the room. There’s
one thing certain, he understands his business through and through,
and I don’t know the a-b-c of it." </p>
