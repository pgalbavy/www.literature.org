<p>Tom Vanrevel always went to the post-office soon after the morning
distribution of the mail; that is to say, about ten o'clock, and
returned with the letters for the firm of Gray and Vanrevel, both
personal and official. Crailey and he shared everything, even
a box at the post-office; and in front of this box, one morning,
after a night of rain, Tom stood staring at a white envelope bearing
a small, black seal. The address was in a writing he had never
seen before, but the instant it fell under his eye he was struck
with a distinctly pleasurable excitement.</p>

<p>Whether through some spiritual exhalation of the writer fragrant
on any missive, or because of a hundred microscopic impressions,
there are analysts who are able to select, from a pile of letters
written by women (for the writing of women exhibits certain phenomena
more determinably than that of men) those of the prettiest or
otherwise most attractive. And out upon the lover who does not
recognize his mistress's hand at the first glimpse ever he has
of it, without post-mark or other information to aid him! Thus
Vanrevel, worn, hollow-eyed, and sallow, in the Rouen post-office,
held the one letter separate from a dozen (the latter not, indeed,
from women), and stared at it until a little color came back to
his dark skin and a great deal of brightness to his eye. He was
no analyst of handwritings, yet it came to him instantly that
this note was from a pretty woman. To see that it was from a woman
was simple, but that he knew&mdash;and he did know&mdash;that she was pretty,
savors of the occult. More than this: there was something about
it that thrilled him. Suddenly, and without reason, he knew that
it came from Elizabeth Carewe.</p>

<p>He walked back quickly to his office with the letter in the left
pocket of his coat, threw the bundle of general correspondence
upon his desk, went up to the floor above, and paused at his own
door to listen. Deep breathing from across the hall indicated
that Mr. Gray's soul was still encased in slumber, and great was
its need, as Tom had found his partner, that morning at five,
stretched upon the horsehair sofa in the office, lamenting the
emptiness of a bottle which had been filled with fiery Bourbon
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Vanrevel went to his own room, locked the door, and took the
letter from his pocket. He held it between his fingers carefully,
as though it were alive and very fragile, and he looked at it
a long time, holding it first in one hand, then in the other,
before he opened it. At last, however, after examining all the
blades of his pocketknife, he selected one brighter than the others,
and loosened the flap of the envelope as gently and carefully
as if it had been the petal of a rose-bud that he was opening.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Vanrevel:</p>

<p>"I believed you last night, though I did not understand. But
I understand, now&mdash;everything&mdash;and, bitter to me as the truth
is, I must show you plainly that I know all of it, nor can I rest
until I do show you. I want you to answer this letter&mdash;though
I must not see you again for a long time&mdash;and in your answer you
must set me right if I am anywhere mistaken in what I have learned.</p>

<p>"At first, and until after the second time we met, I did not
believe in your heart, though I did in your mind and humor. Even
since then, there have come strange, small, inexplicable mistrustings
of you, but now I throw them all away and trust you wholly, Monsieur
Citizen Georges Meilbac! &mdash;I shall always think of you in
those impossible garnishments of my poor great-uncle, and I persuade
myself that he must have been a little like you.</p>

<p>"I trust you because I have heard the story of your profound
goodness. The first reason for my father's dislike was your belief
in freedom as the right of all men. Ah, it is not your pretty
exaggerations and flatteries (I laugh at them!) that speak for
you, but your career, itself, and the brave things you have done.
My father's dislike flared into hatred because you worsted him
when he discovered that he could not successfully defend the wrong
against you and fell back upon sheer insult.</p>

<p>"He is a man whom I do not know&mdash;strange as that seems as I write
it. It is only to you, who have taught me so much, that I could
write it. I have tried to know him and to realize that I am his
daughter, but we are the coldest acquaintances, that is all; and
I cannot see how a change could come. I do not understand him;
least of all do I understand why he is a gambler. It has been
explained to me that it is his great passion, but all I comprehend
in these words is that they are full of shame for his daughter.</p>

<p>"This is what was told me: he has always played heavily and skillfully&mdash;adding
much to his estate in that way&mdash;and in Rouen always with a certain
coterie, which was joined, several years ago, by the man you came
to save last night.</p>

<p>"Your devotion to Mr. Gray has been the most beautiful thing
in your life. I know all that the town knows of that, except the
thousand hidden sacrifices you have made for him, those things
which no one will ever know. (And yet, you see, I know them after
all!) For your sake, because you love him, I will not even call
him unworthy.</p>

<p>"I have heard&mdash;from one who told unwillingly&mdash;the story of the
night two years ago, when the play ran so terribly high; and how,
in the morning when they went away, all were poorer except one,
their host!&mdash;how Mr. Gray had nothing left in the world, and owed
my father a great sum which was to be paid in twenty-four hours;
how you took everything you had saved in the years of hard work
at your profession, and borrowed the rest on your word, and brought
it to my father that afternoon; how, when you had paid your friend's
debt, you asked my father not to play with Mr. Gray again; and
my father made that his excuse to send you a challenge. You laughed
at the challenge&mdash;and you could afford to laugh at it.</p>

<p>"But this is all shame, shame for Robert Carewe's daughter. It
seems to me that I should hide and not lift my head; that I, being
of my father's blood, could never look you in the face again.
It is so unspeakably painful and ugly. I think of my father's
stiff pride and his look of the eagle,&mdash;and he still plays with
your friend, almost always 'successfully!' And your friend still
comes to play!&mdash;but I will not speak of that side of it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray has made you poor, but I know it was not that which
made you come seeking him last night, when I found you there in
the hail. It was for his sake you came&mdash;and you went away for
mine. Now that I know, at last&mdash;now that I have heard what your
life has been (and oh I heard so much more than I have written!)&mdash;now
that my eyes have been opened to see you as you are, I am proud,
and glad and humble that I can believe that you felt a friendship
for me strong enough to have made you go 'for my sake.' You will
write to me just once, won't you? and tell me if there was any
error in what I listened to; but you must not come to the garden.
Now that I know you, I cannot meet you clandestinely again. It
would hurt the dignity which I feel in you now, and my own poor
dignity&mdash;such as it is! I have been earnestly warned of the danger
to you. Besides, you must let me test myself. I am all fluttering
and frightened and excited. You will obey me, won't you?&mdash;do not
come until I send for you. Elizabeth Carewe."</p>

<p>Mr. Gray, occupied with his toilet about noon, heard his partner
descending to the office with a heavy step, and issued from his
room to call a hearty greeting. Tom looked back over his shoulder
and replied cheerily, though with a certain embarrassment; but
Crailey, catching sight of his face, uttered a sharp ejaculation
and came down to him.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter, Tom? You're not going to be sick? You
look like the devil and all!"</p>

<p>"I'm all right, never fear!" Tom laughed, evading the other's
eye. "I'm going out in the country on some business, and I dare
say I shall not be back for a couple of days; it will be all up
and down the county."  He set down a travelling-bag he was carrying,
and offered the other his hand. "Good-by."</p>

<p>"Can't I go for you? You don't look able."</p>

<p>"No, no. It's something I'll have to attend to myself."</p>

<p>"Ah, I suppose," said Crailey, gently, "I suppose it's important,
and you couldn't trust me to handle it. Well &mdash;God knows
you're right! I've shown you often enough how incompetent I am
to do anything but write jingles!"</p>

<p>"You do some more of them&mdash;without the whiskey, Crailey. They're
worth more than all the lawing Gray and Vanrevel have ever done
or ever will do. Good-by&#11834;and be kind to yourself."</p>

<p>He descended to the first landing, and then, "Oh, Crailey," he
called, with the air of having forgotten something he had meant
to say.</p>

<p>"Yes, Tom?"</p>

<p>"This morning at the post-office I found a letter addressed to
me. I opened it and&mdash;" He hesitated, and uneasily shifted his
weight from one foot to the other, with a feeble, deprecatory
laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, what of it?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;there seemed to be a mistake. I think it must have been
meant for you. Somehow, she&mdash;she's picked up a good many wrong
impressions, and, Lord knows how, but she's mixed our names up
and&mdash;and I've left the letter for you. It's on my table."</p>

<p>He turned and calling a final good-by over his shoulder, went
clattering noisily down to the street and vanished from Crailey's
sight.</p>

<p>Noon found Tom far out on the National Road, creaking along over
the yellow dust in a light wagon, between bordering forests that
smelt spicily of wet underbrush and May-apples; and, here and
there, when they would emerge from the woods to cleared fields,
liberally outlined by long snake-fences of black walnut, the steady,
jog-trotting old horse lifted his head and looked interested in
the world, but Tom never did either. Habitually upright, walking
or sitting, straight, keen, and alert, that day's sun saw him
drearily hunched over, mile after mile, his forehead laced with
lines of pain. He stopped at every farm-house and cabin, and,
where the young men worked in the fields, hailed them from the
road, or hitched his horse to the fence and crossed the soft furrows
to talk with them. At such times he stood erect again, and spoke
stirringly, finding eager listeners. There was one question they
asked him over and over:</p>

<p>"But are you sure the call will come?"</p>

<p>"As sure as that we stand here; and it will come before the week
is out. We must be ready!"</p>

<p>Often, when he left them, they would turn from the work in hand,
leaving it as it was, to lie unfinished in the fields, and make
their way slowly and thoughtfully to their homes, while Tom climbed
into his creaking little wagon once more, only to fall into the
same dull, hunched-over attitude. He had many things to think
out before he faced Rouen and Crailey Gray again, and more to
fight through to the end with himself. Three days he took for
it, three days driving through the soft May weather behind the
kind, old jog-trotting horse; three days on the road, from farm-house
to farm-house and from field to field, from cabin of the woods
to cabin in the clearing. Tossing unhappily at night, he lay sleepless
till dawn, though not because of the hard beds; and when daylight
came, journeyed steadily on again, over the vagabond little hills
that had gypsied it so far into the prairie-land in their wanderings
from their range on the Ohio, and, passing the hills, went on
through the flat forest-land, always hunched over dismally in
the creaking wagon.</p>

<p>But on the evening of the third day he drove into town, with
the stoop out of his shoulders and the lustre back in his eyes.
He was haggard, gray, dusty, but he had solved his puzzle, and
one thing was clear in his mind as the thing that he would do.
He patted the old horse a hearty farewell as he left him with
the liveryman from whom he had hired him, and strode up Main Street
with the air of a man who is going somewhere. It was late, but
there were more lights than usual in the windows and more people
on the streets. Boys ran shouting, while, here and there, knots
of men argued loudly, and in front of the little corner drug-store
a noisily talkative, widely gesticulative crowd of fifty or more
had gathered. An old man, a cobbler, who had left a leg at Tippecanoe
and replaced it with a wooden one, chastely decorated with designs
of his own carving, came stumping excitedly down the middle of
the street, where he walked for fear of the cracks in the wooden
pavement, which were dangerous to his art-leg when he came from
the Rouen House bar, as on the present occasion. He hailed Tom
by name.</p>

<p>"You're the lad, Tom Vanrevel," he shouted. "You're the man to
lead the boys out for the glory of the State! You git the whole
blame Fire De-partment out and enlist 'em before morning! Take
'em down to the Rio Grande, you hear me?</p>

<p>"And you needn't be afraid of their puttin' it out, if it ketches
afire, neither!"</p>

<p>Tom waved his hand and passed on; but at the open doors of the
Catholic Church he stopped and looked up and down the street,
and then, unnoticed, entered to the dim interior, where the few
candles showed only a bent old woman in black kneeling at the
altar. Tom knew where Elizabeth Carewe knelt each morning; he
stepped softly through the shadowy silence to her place, knelt,
and rested his head upon the rail of the bench before him.</p>

<p>The figure at the altar raised itself after a time, and the old
woman limped slowly up a side aisle, mumbling her formulas, courtesying
to the painted saints, on her way out. The very thinnest lingerings
of incense hung on the air, seeming to Tom like the faint odor
that might exhale from a heavy wreath of marguerites, worn in
dark-brown hair. Yet, the place held nothing but peace and good-will.
And he found nothing else in his own heart. The street was quiet
when he emerged from that lorn vigil; the corner groups had dissolved;
shouting youths no longer patrolled the sidewalks. Only one quarter
showed signs of life: the little clubhouse, where the windows
still shown brightly, and whence came the sound of many voices
settling the destinies of the United States of America. Thither
Tom bent his steps, thoughtfully, and with a quiet mind. There
was a small veranda at the side of the house; here he stood unobserved
to look in upon his noisy and agitated friends.</p>

<p>They were all there, from the old General and Mr. Bareaud, to
the latter's son, Jefferson, and young Frank Chenoweth. They were
gathered about a big table upon which stood a punch-bowl and Trumble,
his brow as angry red as the liquor in the cup he held, was proposing
a health to the President in a voice of fury.</p>

<p>"In spite of all the Crailey Grays and traitors this side of
hell!" he finished politely.</p>

<p>Crailey emerged instantaneously from the general throng and mounted
a chair, tossing his light hair back from his forehead, his eyes
sparkling and happy. "You find your own friends already occupying
the place you mentioned, do you, General?" he asked.</p>

<p>General Trumble stamped and shook his fist.</p>

<p>"You're a spawn of Aaron Burr!" he vociferated. "There's not
a man here to stand by your infernal doctrines. You sneer at your
own State, you sneer at your own country, you defile the sacred
ground! What are you, by the Almighty, who attack your native
land in this, her hour of peril!"</p>

<p>"Peril to my native land!" laughed Crailey. "From Santa Anna?"</p>

<p>"The General's right, sir," exclaimed the elder Chenoweth indignantly,
and most of the listeners appeared to agree with him. "It's a
poor time to abuse the President when he's called for volunteers
and our country is in danger, sir!"</p>

<p>"Who is in danger?" answered Crailey, lifting his hand to still
the clamor of approbation that arose. "Is Polk in danger? Or Congress?
But that would be too much to hope! Do you expect to see the Greasers
in Washington? No, you idiots, you don't! Yet there'll be plenty
of men to suffer and die; and the first should be those who thrust
this war on us and poor little Mexico; but it won't be they; the
men who'll do the fighting and dying will be the country boys
and the like of us from the towns, while Mr. Polk sits planning
at the White House how he can get elected again. I wish Tom were
here, confound you! You listen to him because he always has the
facts and I'm just an embroiderer, you think. What's become of
the gaudy campaign cry you were all wearing your lungs out with
a few months ago? 'Fifty-four-forty or fight!' Bah! Polk twisted
the lion's tail with that until after election. Then he saw he
had to make you forget it, or fight England and be ruined, so
he forces war on Mexico, and the country does forget it. That's
it: he asks three regiments of volunteers from this State to die
of fevers and get shot, so that he can steal another country and
make his own elect him again. And you ask me to drink the health
of the politician who sits at home and sends his fellowmen to
die to fix his rotten jobs for him?" Crailey had persuaded himself
into such earnestness, that the depth of his own feeling almost
choked him, but he finished roundly in his beautiful, strong voice:
"I'll drink for the good punch's sake&mdash;but that health? &mdash;I'll
see General Trumble in heaven before I'll drink it!"</p>

<p>There rose at once a roar of anger and disapproval, and Crailey
became a mere storm centre amid the upraised hands gestulating
madly at him as he stood, smiling again, upon his chair.</p>

<p>"This comes of living with Tom Vanrevel!" shouted the General
furiously. "This is his damned Abolition teaching! You're only
his echo; you spend half your life playing at being Vanrevel!"</p>

<p>"Where is Vanrevel?" said Tappingham Marsh.</p>

<p>"Ay, where is he!" raged Trumble, hammering the table till the
glasses rang. "Let him come and answer for his own teaching; it's
wasted time to talk to this one; he's only the pupil. Where is
the traitor?"</p>

<p>"Here," answered a voice from the doorway; and though the word
was spoken quietly it was nevertheless, at that juncture, silencing.
Everyone turned toward the door as Vanrevel entered. But the apoplectic
General, whom Crailey's speech had stirred to a fury beyond control,
almost leaped at Tom's throat.</p>

<p>"Here's the tea-sipping old Granny," he bellowed hoarsely. (He
was ordinarily very fond of Tom.) "Here's the master! Here's the
man whose example teaches Crailey Gray to throw mud at the flag.
He'll stay here at home with Crailey, of course, and throw more,
while the others boys march out to die under it."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," answered Tom, raising his voice, "I think
you'll find Crailey Gray the first to enlist, and as for myself,
I've raised sixty men in the country, and I want forty more from
Rouen, in order to offer the Governor a full company. So it's
come to 'the King, not the man'; Polk is a pitiful trickster,
but the country needs her sons; that's enough for us to know;
and while I won't drink to James Polk "&mdash;he plunged a cup in the
bowl and drew it out brimming&mdash;"I'll empty this to the President!"</p>

<p>It was then that from fifty throats the long, wild shout went
up that stirred Rouen, and woke the people from their midnight
beds for half a mile around.</p>
