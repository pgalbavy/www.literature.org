<p>Doris came in about midnight, her coat and hat plastered with
sleet, her shoes soaking. She looked rather forlornly at the bowl
of hot milk and crackers which Athalie brought from the kitchenette.</p>

<p>"I'd give next week's salary for a steak," she said, taking the
bowl and warming her chilled hands on it.</p>

<p>"You know what meat costs," said Athalie. "I'd give it to you
for supper if I could."</p>

<p>Doris seated herself by the radiator; Athalie knelt and drew
off the wet shoes, unbuttoned the garters and rolled the stockings
from the icy feet.</p>

<p>"I had another chance to-night: they were college boys: some
of the girls went&mdash;" remarked Doris disjointedly, forcing herself
to eat the crackers and milk because it was hot, and snuggling
into the knitted slippers which Athalie brought. After a moment
or two she lifted her pretty, impudent face and sniffed inquiringly.</p>

<p>"<em>Who's</em> been smoking? You?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Who? Genevieve?"</p>

<p>"No. Who do you suppose called?"</p>

<p>"Search <em>me</em>."</p>

<p>"C. Bailey, Junior!"</p>

<p>Doris looked blank, then: "Oh, that boy you had an affair with
about a hundred years ago?"</p>

<p>"That same boy," said Athalie, smiling.</p>

<p>"He'll come again next century I suppose&mdash;like a comet," shrugged
Doris, nestling closer to the radiator.</p>

<p>Athalie said nothing; her sister slowly stirred the crackers
in the milk and from time to time took a spoonful.</p>

<p>"Next time," she said presently, "I shall go out to supper when
an attractive man asks me. I know how to take care of myself&mdash;and
the supper, too."</p>

<p>Athalie started to say something, and stopped. Perhaps she remembered
C. Bailey, Jr., and that she had promised to dine and sup with
him, "anywhere."</p>

<p>She said in a low voice: "It's all right, I suppose, if you know
the man."</p>

<p>"I don't care whether I know him or not as long as it's a good
restaurant."</p>

<p>"Don't talk that way, Doris!"</p>

<p>"Why not? It's true."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Doris set aside the empty bowl, yawned,
looked at the clock, yawned again.</p>

<p>"This is too late for Catharine," she said, drowsily.</p>

<p>"I know it is. Who are the people she's with?"</p>

<p>"Genevieve Hunting &mdash;I don't know the men:&mdash;some of Genevieve's
friends."</p>

<p>"I hope it's nobody from Winton's."</p>

<p>There had been in the Greensleeve family, a tacit understanding
that it was not the thing to accept social attentions from anybody
connected with the firm which employed them. Winton, the male
milliner and gown designer, usually let his models alone, being
in perpetual dread of his wife; but one of the unhealthy looking
sons had become a nuisance to the girls employed there. Recently
he had annoyed Catharine, and the girl was afraid she might have
to lunch with him or lose her position.</p>

<p>Doris yawned again, then shivered.</p>

<p>"Go to bed, ducky," said Athalie. "I'll wait up for Catharine."</p>

<p>So Doris took herself off to bed and Athalie sank into the shabby
arm-chair by the radiator to wait for her other sister.</p>

<p>It was two o'clock when she came in, flushed, vague-eyed, a rather
silly and fixed smile on her doll-like face. Athalie, on the verge
of sleep, rose from her chair, rubbing her eyes:</p>

<p>"What on earth, Catharine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We had supper,&mdash;that's why I'm late.... I've got to have a dinner
gown I tell you. Genevieve's is the smartest thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where did you go?"</p>

<p>"To the Regina. I didn't want to&mdash;dressed this way but Cecil
Reeve said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Cecil &mdash;Mr. Reeve&mdash;one of Genevieve's friends&mdash;the man
who was so crazy to meet me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! Who else was there?" asked Athalie drily.</p>

<p>"A Mr. Ferris &mdash;Harry Ferris they call him. He's quite mad
about Genevieve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why did you drink anything?"</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"You did, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I had a glass of champagne."</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;except something pink in a glass&mdash;before we sat down
to supper.... And something violet coloured, afterward."</p>

<p>"Your breath is dreadful; do you realise it?"</p>

<p>Catharine seemed surprised, then her eyes wandered vaguely, drowsily,
and she laid her gloved hand on Athalie's arm as though to steady
herself.</p>

<p>"What sort of man is your new friend, Cecil Reeve?" inquired
Athalie.</p>

<p>"He's nice&mdash;a gentleman. And they were so amusing;&mdash;we laughed
so much.... I told him he might call.... He's really all right,
Athalie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Mr. Ferris?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I don't know about him; he's Genevieve's friend; &mdash;I
don't know him so well.... But of course he's all right&mdash;a gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's the trouble," said Athalie in a low voice.</p>

<p>"What is the trouble?"</p>

<p>"These friends of yours&mdash;and of Doris, and of mine ... they're
gentlemen.... And that is why we find them agreeable, socially....
But when they desire social amusement they know where to find
it."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Where girls who work for a living are unknown. Where they never
are asked, never go, never are expected to go. But that is where
such men are asked, where such men are expected; and it is where
they go for social diversion&mdash;not to the Regina with two of Winton's
models, nor to the Caf√© Arabesque with an Egyptian Garden chorus
girl, nor&mdash;" she hesitated, flushed, and was silent, staring mentally
at the image of C. Bailey, Jr., which her logic and philosophy
had inevitably evoked.</p>

<p>"Then, what is a business girl to do?" asked Catharine, vaguely.</p>

<p>Athalie shook her golden head, slowly: "Don't ask me."</p>

<p>Catharine said, still more vaguely: "She must do something&mdash;pleasant&mdash;before
she's too old and sick to&mdash;to care what happens."</p>

<p>"I know it.... Men, of that kind, <em>are</em> pleasant.... I
don't see why we shouldn't go out with them. It's all the chance
we have. Or will ever have.... I've thought it over. I don't see
that it helps for us to resent their sisters and mothers and friends.
Such women would never permit us to know them. The nearest we
can get to them is to know their sons."</p>

<p>"I don't want to know them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you do. Be honest, Catharine. Every girl does. And really
I believe if the choice were offered a business girl, she would
rather know the mothers and sisters than the sons."</p>

<p>"There's no use thinking about it," said Catharine.</p>

<p>"No, there is no use.... And so I don't see any harm in being
friends with their sons.... It will hurt at times&mdash;humiliate us&mdash;maybe
embitter us.... But it's that or nothing."</p>

<p>"We needn't be silly about their sons."</p>

<p>Athalie opened her dark blue eyes, then laughed confidently:
"Oh, as for anything like <em>that</em>! I should hope not. We
three ought to know <em>something</em> by this time."</p>

<p>"I should think so," murmured Catharine; and her warm, wine-scented
breath fell on Athalie's cheek.</p>
