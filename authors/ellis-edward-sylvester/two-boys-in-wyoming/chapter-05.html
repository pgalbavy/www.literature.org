<p>One of the singular features connected with the experience of
our young friends during the first night they spent in Wyoming
was that all the danger which threatened them came from one Indian
and from one <em>lupus</em>. After Jack Dudley had expelled the
prowling buck, the intruder took good care to remain away. Neither
he nor any of his companions troubled the campers further. The
presumption, therefore, was that this solitary specimen was a
"dog Indian," or vagrant, wandering over the country on his own
account. Such fellows, as already explained, claim no kinship
with any tribe, but are, like the tramps of civilized society,
agents for themselves alone.</p>

<p>Had the season been winter, with the snow deep on the ground,
the trouble from the wolves would have been more serious. Those
gaunt creatures, when goaded by hunger, become exceedingly daring,
and do not hesitate to attack even armed bodies of men; but it
was autumn time, when the ravenous brutes, who seem always to
be hungry, find the least difficulty in procuring food, and they
remained true to their cowardly disposition and refrained from
everything in the nature of true courage.</p>

<p>The curious fact, as we have remarked, was that, as in the case
of the Indian, only a single wolf intruded upon the little company.
The animals generally travel in droves, and when one is seen it
is quite safe to count upon a dozen, or a score, or even more.
It is possible that the victim of Fred Greenwood's Winchester
was also a sort of tramp, prospecting for his own benefit. It
is more likely, however, that he was what might be considered
a scout or advance agent of others. His pack was probably waiting
among the foot-hills for him to return with his report. If so,
the report is now considerably overdue.</p>

<p>Fred was a model sentinel for the remaining hours that he continued
on duty. He continued circling about the camp-fire, silent, stealthy,
peering here and there, and listening for the first evidence of
danger. Nothing of the kind was seen or heard, and he finally
came back to the smouldering fire and looked at the face of his
watch.</p>

<p>Could it be possible? It lacked a few minutes of three o'clock.
According to agreement, he should have called Hazletine an hour
before.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose he will object," said Fred, aloud; "I'm sure
I shouldn't, if allowed to sleep an hour beyond my time&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I ain't doing any kicking, am I?"</p>

<p>Looking around, he saw the guide had flung aside his blanket
and was sitting erect, with a quizzical expression on his face.</p>

<p>"What made you fire your gun 'bout two hours ago?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Did you hear me?"</p>

<p>"How'd I know if I hadn't heard it?" was the pertinent question.</p>

<p>"A wolf was sneaking among the trees. I followed him out to the
edge of the timber and let him have it between the eyes."</p>

<p>"Did you hurt him?"</p>

<p>"Since he flopped over and died, I have reason to believe he
<em>was</em> hurt."</p>

<p>"Good! That's the style&mdash;always to shoot. Never waste your ammunition.
You didn't kill any Injins?"</p>

<p>"I saw none at all."</p>

<p>Hank looked at the unconscious figure of Jack Dudley.</p>

<p>"Wonder how it was with him?"</p>

<p>"He did not fire his gun at anything."</p>

<p>Fred did not wish to tell his friend about that alarming visit
earlier in the evening. That was Jack's concern.</p>

<p>"But he may have seed something. Howsumever, we can wait till
morning. Wal, younker, if you've no 'bjection you can lay down
and snooze till morning. I go on duty now."</p>

<p>There was vast comfort in this knowledge. It relieved the youth
from the last remnant of anxiety, and he lost no time in abandoning
himself to slumber. The man who was now acting as sentinel was
a past master at the art, and there need be no misgiving while
he was on duty. Thus it came about that neither Jack Dudley nor
Fred Greenwood opened his eyes until the sun was shining into
the grove.</p>

<p>Each had had a refreshing night, but it cannot be said that their
awakening was of the most pleasant nature. The hunger that had
been twice satisfied the day before was not to be compared to
that which now got hold of them. With the insatiate craving was
the knowledge that there was not a scrap of meat, a crumb of bread
nor a drop of milk in camp.</p>

<p>"We can fill up on water," remarked Jack, after they had bathed
faces and hands and quaffed their fill.</p>

<p>"But what good will that do? We might bubble over, but we should
be just as hungry as ever."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that when a fellow is chock-full of anything
he oughtn't to feel much hunger."</p>

<p>"I've often thought that, but you can't fool nature that way."</p>

<p>"If it gets any worse we can shoot the ponies and devour them."</p>

<p>"Why both of them?"</p>

<p>"Because it would take a whole one to satisfy me. I don't know
how <em>you</em> feel, Jack, but if we are to have appetites like
this I shall go in for buying a drove of cattle and spending the
few weeks we have in these parts in eating."</p>

<p>The youths looked in each other's face and laughed. Truly they
were ahungered, but could never quite lose their waggishness.</p>

<p>"I wonder what's become of Hank," suddenly exclaimed Fred, looking
beside and behind them; "the fire is nearly burned out, and he
is nowhere in sight. <em>HALLOOH</em>!"</p>

<p>The hail was uttered in a loud voice, and was responded to, but
from a point a considerable distance out upon the prairie, in
the direction of the foot-hills. The open nature of the wood permitted
the boys to see quite clearly in that direction.</p>

<p>"Yonder he comes," said Jack.</p>

<p>"And, by gracious, he's carrying something on his shoulders.
I wonder if it is that Indian you chatted with last night."</p>

<p>"Better than that. It's <em>something to eat</em>!"</p>

<p>Jack Dudley was right. The guide was laden with the carcass of
some animal. Its bulk was proof that he possessed an accurate
idea of the appetite of these young gentlemen.</p>

<p>"How careless in him to leave us thus alone," remarked Fred,
with mock reproof.</p>

<p>"Do you wish he hadn't done so?"</p>

<p>"Don't name it!" exclaimed Fred, with a shudder; "he knew the
only way of saving our lives. It wouldn't have done for him to
postpone it another hour."</p>

<p>Hank Hazletine was never more welcome than when he entered the
grove and let fall from his shoulders the carcass of a half-grown
calf, plump, juicy, tender, and in the best of condition.</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose you care much 'bout it, but I feel like having
something worth while for breakfast," he remarked, proceeding
to prepare the coals, for he had dressed the veal before starting
on his return.</p>

<p>"Well," said Fred, with assumed indifference, "I suspect that
since you intend to partake of food yourself, we may as well join
you for the sake of sociability."</p>

<p>Men like the old hunter are adepts at preparing a meal. The smouldering
fire was in good condition for broiling, and when raked apart
afforded a bed of live coals, over which generous slices were
suspended on green twigs, cut from the nearest trees. It took
but a few minutes to prepare the meat. Hank always carried with
him a box of mixed pepper and salt, whose contents were sprinkled
over the toothsome food, of which the three ate their fill.</p>

<p>"Are there any more of these animals left in the neighborhood?"
asked Jack, when their appetites were fully satisfied.</p>

<p>"S'pose you go out on the edge of the timber and larn for yourselves."</p>

<p>The lads followed the suggestion. Looking off in the direction
of the Wind River Mountains, it seemed to them that tens of thousands
of cattle were browsing among the foot-hills and on the grassy
plain, while many more must have been beyond sight. This was one
of the choicest regions of Wyoming, so widely celebrated for its
grazing facilities.</p>

<p>It was an impressive sight, and the boys, each of whom was provided
with a good spy-glass, surveyed the scene for some minutes in
wondering silence. The cattle were several miles distant, and
seemed to be brown, undulating hummocks of dirt, kept in constant
motion by some force beneath. On the outer fringe they were more
scattered, but were constantly moving, as if the pasturage was
so excellent that they were continually tempted to give up that
which was good for that which looked better.</p>

<p>"Are they left wholly to themselves?" asked Fred, as the youths
came back to where the guide was saddling his pony.</p>

<p>"No. There are always two or three men looking after them. I
seed Bart Coinjock, one of our own cowboys, 'tending our animals,
and he told me to take my ch'ice from the lot. You mustn't forgit
that we're purty close to the Wind River Injin Reservation, where
the Government has several tribes under charge."</p>

<p>This was news to the boys. Hazletine explained that a large tract
of land to the northwest and close to the mountains had been set
apart some years before by the United States Government for exclusive
occupancy by several tribes of Indians. They owned the land, and
no white man had the right to intrude upon them.</p>

<p>In the Southwest, where the Apaches were placed on reservations,
there had been the most frightful trouble, for those Indians are
the worst in North America. All our readers know how many times
the fierce Geronimo and a few of his hostiles broke away from
their reservation, and, riding swiftly through Arizona and New
Mexico, spread desolation, woe and death in their path. Not until
Geronimo and his worst bucks were run down in old Mexico and transported
bodily to the East was the danger to the Southwest terminated.</p>

<p>Nothing of the kind has taken place in Wyoming, Montana, the
Dakotas and other reservations further east, but there is always
a certain number of malcontents on the reservations who cause
trouble. They steal away unnoticed by the authorities, and engage
in thieving, and, when the chances are favorable against detection,
commit graver crimes.</p>

<p>"That Injin that come into the timber last night was a sort of
dog Injin that had come down from the Wind River Reservation to
find out what he could steal."</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other in astonishment. They had made
no reference to the visitor in the hearing of the guide, and could
not understand where he had gained his knowledge. He noticed their
surprise, and smiled.</p>

<p>"I seed the tracks of his pony, as well as his own. It was as
plain to me as the words of a printed book. Why didn't you shoot
the chap?"</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Jack told the story. Hazletine listened with
an expression of amused contempt on his bearded face.</p>

<p>"You'll git over that afore you've been here long. I think I
know who he was. Tell me how he looked."</p>

<p>Jack was able to give a good description of his visitor, and
before it was finished the guide nodded his head several times.</p>

<p>"It was him, Motoza, one of the worst scamps west of the Mississippi."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose he was after?"</p>

<p>"He'll steal anything he can lay his hands on. If he'd found
us all asleep he'd shot every one of us. That's the kind of a
feller Motoza is. You played it well on him, catching him as you
did, but you'd played it a hanged sight better if you'd put a
bullet through him afore you asked any questions."</p>

<p>"What tribe does he belong to?"</p>

<p>"That's a queer part of it. Gin'rally it's easy to tell from
the dress, paint and style of an Injin what his tribe or totem
is, but there's nothing of the kind 'bout Motoza to guide you.
I think he's a Sioux."</p>

<p>"I understood those red men live further to the eastward."</p>

<p>"So they do; but Motoza has wandered from his people. He was
under Sitting Bull, and went with him into British America when
it got too hot on this side of the line; but Sitting Bull come
back, and Motoza follered. He tries to make b'leve he's a good
Injin, and sometimes he is for months at a time on the reservation.
Then the devil gits into him, and he's off somewhere."</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on the three had mounted their
ponies and were galloping northward, this time trending to the
right, so as to draw away from the mountains and follow an almost
direct line to Bowman's ranch, their destination. The animals
were so fresh and spirited that Hazletine said he was hopeful
of sleeping that night in the ranch itself, as he called the low,
flat building where he and several cowmen made their home when
in that part of the country attending to their duties.</p>

<p>It would take hard riding, and would lead them into the night
to accomplish the long journey, but the guide saw no reason why
it should not be done. If a storm came up&mdash;and they break with
amazing suddenness at times in that part of the world&mdash;or if any
mishap befell their ponies, a stop would have to be made for the
night before reaching the ranch.</p>

<p>Jack Dudley decided to ask a question that had been in his mind
for some time.</p>

<p>"Hank, that Indian last night was in my power, and he knew it
as well as I, but I spared his life and allowed him to ride away
without a hair of his head harmed. Now, don't you think he will
feel some gratitude for that?"</p>

<p>Hazletine threw back his head with uproarious laughter. He seemed
to have heard the best joke of a twelvemonth.</p>

<p>"What give you that idee?" he asked, when he succeeded in mastering
his exuberant mirth.</p>

<p>"Why, the event itself. I know that an Indian is revengeful by
nature, but I have always believed that he was capable of gratitude
for kindness."</p>

<p>"You've read that in story-books, but you never seed it in life.
I won't be quite as rough as that," added the guide, in the same
breath; "I have seen a redskin that didn't furgit that a man had
saved him from dying or being shot, but such redskins are as scarce
as hen's teeth. The rule is that they take all such kindnesses
as signs of cowardice, and despise the one that shows 'em. Let
me tell you something that I know," continued Hazletine, seriously.
"Three years ago, when I was down in Arizona, Jim Huber was the
owner of the ranch where I was working. He b'leved in treating
Injins kindly. I've seen him give the 'Paches water to drink when
they was thirsty, meat to eat, 'bacca to smoke, and even powder
and ball for their guns. He kept that up right along, and when
he was warned agin it, he said an Injin was human like the rest
of us, and he was willing to take his chances. The 'Paches wouldn't
furgit what he'd done fur 'em.</p>

<p>"Wal, they didn't. The fust thing we knowed, Geronimo and a dozen
of his devils was off their reservation and coming down through
them parts like a Kansas cyclone. It happened that me and the
boys was several miles off when we heerd the news, and knowing
that Huber was alone at the ranch, we rid like all mad fur the
place. We got there too late to save him. The ranch was on fire,
and he was mangled so we hardly knowed him. But he had died game,
and killed two of the 'Paches afore he went under. The three laid
aside one another, and the two Injins was the very ones that had
set at his table, eat of his food, been given powder and ball,
and been treated like brothers."</p>

<p>"Are all red men as bad as that?"</p>

<p>"I've just said they wasn't. There's lots of 'em that would make
an ordinary white man ashamed of himself. But most of 'em are
alike. What I'm driving at is to knock out of your head any idee
that this Motoza that you let up on last night thinks any more
of you for it. It's t'other way. He despises you fur a coward,
and if he ever gits the chance he'll prove what I say is true."</p>

<p>This was depressing information for the youths, but they did
not think it seeming to express any doubts of the sentiments of
one who was so much better informed than they. They hoped that
their own experience would be of a different nature.</p>

<p>Having set out with the intention of reaching the ranch that
evening, the guide had made the necessary preparations. He rolled
up enough cooked pieces of veal to avert the need of starting
another fire and looking for more food. So it came about that
when the boys began to consult their watches and hint of it being
near meal time, he drew rein at another stream of water, where
the ponies were allowed to rest and graze while their masters
refreshed themselves. The animals had been pressed as much as
was prudent; and Hazletine, looking at the sky and their surroundings,
said they were making better progress than he had counted upon.</p>

<p>The weather remained all that could be desired, though he assured
them that a heavy rain-storm was impending, and would break within
twenty-four hours&mdash;an additional incentive for pushing forward.</p>

<p>They were hardly ever out of sight of cattle. Sometimes they
were few in numbers, and then they suggested the droves of buffaloes,
which, before the animals were extirpated, numbered hundreds of
thousands. Once the horsemen approached so close that the cattle
were frightened and a partial stampede followed. That Hazletine
was among acquaintances was proved by the hails which he received
from cowmen, most of whom were so distant that the wonder was
how they recognized one another. The boys studied them through
their spy-glasses, but, of course, all were strangers to them.</p>

<p>When the afternoon was about half gone they came upon a stream
that looked formidable. It was a hundred yards in width, with
a roiled and rapid current, which, so far as the eye could determine,
might be a score of feet in depth. The prospect of having to swim
their ponies across was anything but pleasant, but the boys saw
that a well-marked trail led down to the bank where they approached
it, showing that it had been crossed and recrossed many times.</p>

<p>"There are places in that stream, which flows into the Platte,"
said the guide, "where it is a hundred feet deep. It has whirlpools
and eddies where the best swimmer couldn't save himself, and even
a grizzly bear would drown."</p>

<p>"I hope those places are a good way off," said Jack.</p>

<p>"There's one of 'em right over there to the left."</p>

<p>"How are we going to reach the other side?" asked Fred, in dismay.</p>

<p>"Foller me."</p>

<p>As he spoke the guide spurred his animal into the muddy water,
with the boys timidly at his heels and closely watching him.</p>

<p>At no time during the fording did the ponies sink above their
knees. It was a surprise and vast relief when they rode out on
the other side without having been compelled to draw up their
feet during the passage.</p>

<p>"And yet," explained their companion, "if you'd gone three yards
to the right or left your critters would have had to swim for
their lives, and you'd have had the worst soaking you ever knowed.
Now fur the ranch!"</p>
