<p><em>THERE </em>were three of them &mdash;Jerry, Jimmy, and Kathleen.
Of course, Jerry's name was Gerald, and not Jeremiah, whatever
you may think; and Jimmy's name was James; and Kathleen was never
called by her name at all, but Cathy, or Catty, or Puss Cat, when
her brothers were pleased with her, and Scratch Cat when they
were not pleased. And they were at school in a little town in
the West of England&mdash;the boys at one school, of course, and the
girl at another, because the sensible habit of having boys and
girls at the same school is not yet as common as I hope it will
be some day. They used to see each other on Saturdays and Sundays
at the house of a kind maiden lady; but it was one of those houses
where it is impossible to play. You know the kind of house, don't
you? There is a sort of a something about that kind of house that
makes you hardly able even to talk to each other when you are
left alone, and playing seems unnatural and affected. So they
looked forward to the holidays, when they should all go home and
be together all day long, in a house where playing was natural
and conversation possible, and where the Hampshire forests and
fields were full of interesting things to do and see. Their Cousin
Betty was to be there too, and there were plans. Betty's school
broke up before theirs, and so she got to the Hampshire home first,
and the moment she got there she began to have measles, so that
my three couldn't go home at all. You may imagine their feelings.
The thought of seven weeks at Miss Hervey's was not to be borne,
and all three wrote home and said so. This astonished their parents
very much, because they had always thought it was so nice for
the children to have dear Miss Hervey's to go to. However, they
were "jolly decent about it," as Jerry said, and after a lot of
letters and telegrams, it was arranged that the boys should go
and stay at Kathleen's school, where there were now no girls left
and no mistresses except the French one.</p>

<p>"It'll be better than being at Miss Hervey's," said Kathleen,
when the boys came round to ask Mademoiselle when it would be
convenient for them to come; "and, besides, our school's not half
so ugly as yours. We do have tablecloths on the tables and curtains
at the windows, and yours is all deal boards, and desks, and inkiness."</p>

<p>When they had gone to pack their boxes Kathleen made all the
rooms as pretty as she could with flowers in jam jars, marigolds
chiefly, because there was nothing much else in the back garden.
There were geraniums in the front garden, and calceolarias and
lobelias; of course, the children were not allowed to pick these.</p>

<p>"We ought to have some sort of play to keep us going through
the holidays," said Kathleen, when tea was over, and she had unpacked
and arranged the boys' clothes in the painted chests of drawers,
feeling very grown-up and careful as she neatly laid the different
sorts of clothes in tidy little heaps in the drawers. "Suppose
we write a book."</p>

<p>"You couldn't," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean me, of course," said Kathleen, a little injured;
"I meant us."</p>

<p>"Too much fag," said Gerald briefly.</p>

<p>"If we wrote a book," Kathleen persisted, "about what the insides
of schools really <em>are</em> like, people would read it and
say how clever we were."</p>

<p>"More likely expel us," said Gerald. "No; we'll have an out-of-doors
game&mdash;bandits, or something like that. It wouldn't be bad if we
could get a cave and keep stores in it, and have our meals there."</p>

<p>"There aren't any caves," said Jimmy, who was fond of contradicting
every one. "And, besides, your precious Mamselle won't let us
go out alone, as likely as not."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll see about that," said Gerald. "I'll go and talk to
her like a father."</p>

<p>"Like that?" Kathleen pointed the thumb of scorn at him, and
he looked in the glass.</p>

<p>"To brush his hair and his clothes and to wash his face and hands
was to our hero but the work of a moment," said Gerald, and went
to suit the action to the word.</p>

<p>It was a very sleek boy, brown and thin and interesting-looking,
that knocked at the door of the parlour where Mademoiselle sat
reading a yellow-covered book and wishing vain wishes. Gerald
could always make himself look interesting at a moment's notice,
a very useful accomplishment in dealing with strange grown-ups.
It was done by opening his grey eyes rather wide, allowing the
corners of his mouth to droop, and assuming a gentle, pleading
expression, resembling that of the late little Lord Fauntleroy&mdash;who
must, by the way, be quite old now, and an awful prig.</p>

<p>"Entrez!" said Mademoiselle, in shrill French accents. So he
entered.</p>

<p>"Eh bien?" she said rather impatiently.</p>

<p>"I hope I am not disturbing you," said Gerald, in whose mouth,
it seemed, butter would not have melted.</p>

<p>"But no," she said, somewhat softened. "What is it that you desire?"</p>

<p>"I thought I ought to come and say how do you do," said Gerald,
"because of you being the lady of the house."</p>

<p>He held out the newly-washed hand, still damp and red. She took
it.</p>

<p>"You are a very polite little boy," she said.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Gerald, more polite than ever. "I am so sorry
for you. It must be dreadful to have us to look after in the holidays."</p>

<p>"But not at all," said Mademoiselle in her turn. "I am sure you
will be very good childrens."</p>

<p>Gerald's look assured her that he and the others would be as
near angels as children could be without ceasing to be human.</p>

<p>"We'll try," he said earnestly.</p>

<p>"Can one do anything for you?" asked the French governess kindly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, thank you," said Gerald. "We don't want to give you
any trouble at all. And I was thinking it would be less trouble
for you if we were to go out into the woods all day to-morrow
and take our dinner with us&mdash;something cold, you know&mdash;so as not
to be a trouble to the cook."</p>

<p>"You are very considerate," said Mademoiselle coldly. Then Gerald's
eyes smiled; they had a trick of doing this when his lips were
quite serious. Mademoiselle caught the twinkle, and she laughed
and Gerald laughed too.</p>

<p>"Little deceiver!" she said. "Why not say at once you want to
be free of <em>surveillance</em>, how you say&mdash;overwatching&mdash;without
pretending it is me you wish to please?"</p>

<p>"You have to be careful with grown-ups," said Gerald, "but it
isn't all pretence either. We <em>don't</em> want to trouble you&mdash;and
we don't want you to<hr>"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>LITTLE DECEIVER!" SHE SAID</em>.]</p>

<p>"To trouble you. Eh bien! Your parents, they permit these days
at woods?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Gerald truthfully.</p>

<p>"Then I will not be more a dragon than the parents. I will forewarn
the cook. Are you content?"</p>

<p>"Rather!" said Gerald. "Mademoiselle, you are a dear."</p>

<p>"A deer?" she repeated&mdash;"a stag?"</p>

<p>"No, a&mdash;a <em>chérie</em>," said Gerald&mdash;"a regular A1 <em>chérie</em>.
And you shan't repent it. Is there anything we can do for you&mdash;wind
your wool, or find your spectacles, or<hr>?"</p>

<p>"He thinks me a grandmother!" said Mademoiselle, laughing more
than ever. "Go then, and be not more naughty than you must."</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>"Well, what luck?" the others asked.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Gerald indifferently. "I told you it would
be. The ingenuous youth won the regard of the foreign governess,
who in her youth had been the beauty of her humble village."</p>

<p>"I don't believe she ever was. She's too stern," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Gerald, "that's only because you don't know how to
manage her. She wasn't stern with <em>me</em>."</p>

<p>"I say, what a humbug you are though, aren't you?" said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"No, I'm a dip&mdash;what's-its-name? Something like an ambassador.
Dipsoplomatist&mdash;that's what I am. Anyhow, we've got our day, and
if we don't find a cave in it my name's not Jack Robinson."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle, less stern than Kathleen had ever seen her, presided
at supper, which was bread and treacle spread several hours before,
and now harder and drier than any other food you can think of.
Gerald was very polite in handing her butter and cheese, and pressing
her to taste the bread and treacle.</p>

<p>"Bah! it is like sand in the mouth&mdash;of a dryness! Is it possible
this pleases you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Gerald, "it is not possible, but it is not polite
for boys to make remarks about their food!"</p>

<p>She laughed, but there was no more dried bread and treacle for
supper after that.</p>

<p>"How <em>do</em> you do it?" Kathleen whispered admiringly as
they said good-night.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's quite easy when you've once got a grown-up to see what
you're after. You'll see, I shall drive her with a rein of darning
cotton after this."</p>

<p>Next morning Gerald got up early and gathered a little bunch
of pink carnations from a plant which he found hidden among the
marigolds. He tied it up with black cotton and laid it on Mademoiselle's
plate. She smiled and looked quite handsome as she stuck the flowers
in her belt.</p>

<p>"Do you think it's quite decent," Jimmy asked later&mdash;"sort of
bribing people to let you do as you like with flowers and things
and passing them the salt?"</p>

<p>"It's not that," said Kathleen suddenly. "<em>I</em> know what
Gerald means, only I never think of the things in time myself.
You see, if you want grown-ups to be nice to you the least you
can do is to be nice to them and think of little things to please
them. I never think of any myself. Jerry does; that's why all
the old ladies like him. It's not bribery. It's a sort of honesty&mdash;like
paying for things."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," said Jimmy, putting away the moral question,
"we've got a ripping day for the woods."</p>

<p>They had.</p>

<p>The wide High Street, even at the busy morning hour almost as
quiet as a dream-street, lay bathed in sunshine; the leaves shone
fresh from last night's rain, but the road was dry, and in the
sunshine the very dust of it sparkled like diamonds. The beautiful
old houses, standing stout and strong, looked as though they were
basking in the sunshine and enjoying it.</p>

<p>"But <em>are</em> there any woods?" asked Kathleen as they passed
the market-place.</p>

<p>"It doesn't much matter about woods," said Gerald dreamily, "we're
sure to find <em>something</em>. One of the chaps told me his
father said when he was a boy there used to be a little cave under
the bank in a lane near the Salisbury Road; but he said there
was an enchanted castle there too, so perhaps the cave isn't true
either."</p>

<p>"If we were to get horns," said Kathleen, "and to blow them very
hard all the way, we might find a magic castle."</p>

<p>"If you've got the money to throw away on horns ..." said Jimmy
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Well, I have, as it happens, so there!" said Kathleen. And the
horns were bought in a tiny shop with a bulging window full of
a tangle of toys and sweets and cucumbers and sour apples.</p>

<p>And the quiet square at the end of the town where the church
is, and the houses of the most respectable people, echoed to the
sound of horns blown long and loud. But none of the houses turned
into enchanted castles.</p>

<p>So they went along the Salisbury Road, which was very hot and
dusty, so they agreed to drink one of the bottles of gingerbeer.</p>

<p>"We might as well carry the gingerbeer inside us as inside the
bottle," said Jimmy, "and we can hide the bottle and call for
it as we come back."</p>

<p>Presently they came to a place where the road, as Gerald said,
went two ways at once.</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> looks like adventures," said Kathleen; and they
took the right-hand road, and the next time they took a turning
it was a left-hand one, so as to be quite fair, Jimmy said, and
then a right-hand one and then a left, and so on, till they were
completely lost.</p>

<p>"_Com_pletely," said Kathleen; "how jolly!"</p>

<p>And now trees arched overhead, and the banks of the road were
high and bushy. The adventurers had long since ceased to blow
their horns. It was too tiring to go on doing that, when there
was no one to be annoyed by it.</p>

<p>"Oh, kriky!" observed Jimmy suddenly, "let's sit down a bit and
have some of our dinner. We might call it lunch, you know," he
added persuasively.</p>

<p>So they sat down in the hedge and ate the ripe red gooseberries
that were to have been their dessert.</p>

<p>And as they sat and rested and wished that their boots did not
feel so full of feet, Gerald leaned back against the bushes, and
the bushes gave way so that he almost fell over backward. Something
had yielded to the pressure of his back, and there was the sound
of something heavy that fell.</p>

<p>"O Jimminy!" he remarked, recovering himself suddenly; "there's
something hollow in there&mdash;the stone I was leaning against simply
<em>went</em>!"</p>

<p>"I wish it was a cave," said Jimmy; "but of course it isn't."</p>

<p>"If we blow the horns perhaps it will be," said Kathleen, and
hastily blew her own.</p>

<p>Gerald reached his hand through the bushes. "I can't feel anything
but air," he said; "it's just a hole full of emptiness." The other
two pulled back the bushes. There certainly was a hole in the
bank. "I'm going to go in," observed Gerald.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" said his sister. "I wish you wouldn't. Suppose there
were snakes!"</p>

<p>"Not likely," said Gerald, but he leaned forward and struck a
match. "It <em>is</em> a cave!" he cried, and put his knee on
the mossy stone he had been sitting on, scrambled over it, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>A breathless pause followed.</p>

<p>"You all right?" asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Yes; come on. You'd better come feet first&mdash;there's a bit of
a drop."</p>

<p>"I'll go next," said Kathleen, and went&mdash;feet first, as advised.
The feet waved wildly in the air.</p>

<p>"Look out!" said Gerald in the dark; "you'll have my eye out.
Put your feet <em>down</em>, girl, not up. It's no use trying
to fly here&mdash;there's no room."</p>

<p>He helped her by pulling her feet forcibly down and then lifting
her under the arms. She felt rustling dry leaves under her boots,
and stood ready to receive Jimmy, who came in head first, like
one diving into an unknown sea.</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> a cave," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"The young explorers," explained Gerald, blocking up the hole
of entrance with his shoulders, "dazzled at first by the darkness
of the cave, could see nothing."</p>

<p>"Darkness doesn't dazzle," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I wish we'd got a candle," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Yes, it does," Gerald contradicted&mdash;"could see nothing. But
their dauntless leader, whose eyes had grown used to the dark
while the clumsy forms of the others were bunging up the entrance,
had made a discovery."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>JIMMY CAME IN HEAD FIRST, LIKE ONE DIVING
INTO AN UNKNOWN SEA</em>.]</p>

<p>"Oh, what!" Both the others were used to Gerald's way of telling
a story while he acted it, but they did sometimes wish that he
didn't talk quite so long and so like a book in moments of excitement.</p>

<p>"He did not reveal the dread secret to his faithful followers
till one and all had given him their word of honour to be calm."</p>

<p>"We'll be calm all right," said Jimmy impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Gerald, ceasing suddenly to be a book and
becoming a boy, "there's a light over there&mdash;look behind you!"</p>

<p>They looked. And there was. A faint greyness on the brown walls
of the cave, and a brighter greyness cut off sharply by a dark
line, showed that round a turning or angle of the cave there was
daylight.</p>

<p>"Attention!" said Gerald; at least, that was what he meant, though
what he said was "'Shun!" as becomes the son of a soldier. The
others mechanically obeyed.</p>

<p>"You will remain at attention till I give the word 'Slow march!'
on which you will advance cautiously in open order, following
your hero leader, taking care not to tread on the dead and wounded."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't!" said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"There aren't any," said Jimmy, feeling for her hand in the dark;
"he only means, take care not to tumble over stones and things."</p>

<p>Here he found her hand, and she screamed.</p>

<p>"It's only me," said Jimmy. "I thought you'd like me to hold
it. But you're just like a girl."</p>

<p>Their eyes had now begun to get accustomed to the darkness, and
all could see that they were in a rough stone cave, that went
straight on for about three or four yards and then turned sharply
to the right.</p>

<p>"Death or victory!" remarked Gerald. "Now, then &mdash;Slow march!"</p>

<p>He advanced carefully, picking his way among the loose earth
and stones that were the floor of the cave. "A sail, a sail!"
he cried, as he turned the corner.</p>

<p>"How splendid!" Kathleen drew a long breath as she came out into
the sunshine.</p>

<p>"I don't see any sail," said Jimmy, following.</p>

<p>The narrow passage ended in a round arch all fringed with ferns
and creepers. They passed through the arch into a deep, narrow
gully whose banks were of stones, moss-covered; and in the crannies
grew more ferns and long grasses. Trees growing on the top of
the bank arched across, and the sunlight came through in changing
patches of brightness, turning the gully to a roofed corridor
of goldy-green. The path, which was of greeny-grey flagstones
where heaps of leaves had drifted, sloped steeply down, and at
the end of it was another round arch, quite dark inside, above
which rose rocks and grass and bushes.</p>

<p>"It's like the outside of a railway tunnel," said James.</p>

<p>"It's the entrance to the enchanted castle," said Kathleen. "Let's
blow the horns."</p>

<p>"Dry up!" said Gerald. "The bold Captain, reproving the silly
chatter of his subordinates<hr>"</p>

<p>"I like that!" said Jimmy, indignant.</p>

<p>"I thought you would," resumed Gerald&mdash;"of his subordinates,
bade them advance with caution and in silence, because after all
there might be somebody about, and the other arch might be an
ice-house or something dangerous."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Kathleen anxiously.</p>

<p>"Bears, perhaps," said Gerald briefly.</p>

<p>"There aren't any bears without bars&mdash;in England, anyway," said
Jimmy. "They call bears bars in America," he added absently.</p>

<p>"Quick march!" was Gerald's only reply.</p>

<p>And they marched. Under the drifted damp leaves the path was
firm and stony to their shuffling feet. At the dark arch they
stopped.</p>

<p>"There are steps down," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> an ice-house," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"Don't let's," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Our hero," said Gerald, "who nothing could dismay, raised the
faltering hopes of his abject minions by saying that he was jolly
well going on, and they could do as they liked about it."</p>

<p>"If you call names," said Jimmy, "you can go on by yourself."
He added, "So there!"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "IT'S <em>THE ENTRANCE TO THE ENCHANTED CASTLE,"
SAID KATHLEEN</em>.]</p>

<p>"It's part of the game, silly," explained Gerald kindly. "You
can be Captain to-morrow, so you'd better hold your jaw now, and
begin to think about what names you'll call us when it's your
turn."</p>

<p>Very slowly and carefully they went down the steps. A vaulted
stone arched over their heads. Gerald struck a match when the
last step was found to have no edge, and to be, in fact, the beginning
of a passage, turning to the left.</p>

<p>"This," said Jimmy, "will take us back into the road."</p>

<p>"Or under it," said Gerald. "We've come down eleven steps."</p>

<p>They went on, following their leader, who went very slowly for
fear, as he explained, of steps. The passage was very dark.</p>

<p>"I don't half like it!" whispered Jimmy.</p>

<p>Then came a glimmer of daylight that grew and grew, and presently
ended in another arch that looked out over a scene so like a picture
out of a book about Italy that every one's breath was taken away,
and they simply walked forward silent and staring. A short avenue
of cypresses led, widening as it went, to a marble terrace that
lay broad and white in the sunlight. The children, blinking, leaned
their arms on the broad, flat balustrade and gazed. Immediately
below them was a lake&mdash;just like a lake in "The Beauties of Italy"&mdash;a
lake with swans and an island and weeping willows; beyond it were
green slopes dotted with groves of trees, and amid the trees gleamed
the white limbs of statues. Against a little hill to the left
was a round white building with pillars, and to the right a waterfall
came tumbling down among mossy stones to splash into the lake.
Steps led from the terrace to the water, and other steps to the
green lawns beside it. Away across the grassy slopes deer were
feeding, and in the distance where the groves of trees thickened
into what looked almost a forest were enormous shapes of grey
stone, like nothing that the children had ever seen before.</p>

<p>"That chap at school<hr>" said Gerald.</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> an enchanted castle," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"I don't see any castle," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"What do you call that, then?" Gerald pointed to where, beyond
a belt of lime-trees, white towers and turrets broke the blue
of the sky.</p>

<p>"There doesn't seem to be any one about," said Kathleen, "and
yet it's all so tidy. I believe it is magic."</p>

<p>"Magic mowing machines," Jimmy suggested.</p>

<p>"If we were in a book it would be an enchanted castle&mdash;certain
to be," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> an enchanted castle," said Gerald in hollow tones.</p>

<p>"But there aren't any." Jimmy was quite positive.</p>

<p>"How do you know? Do you think there's nothing in the world but
what <em>you've</em> seen?" His scorn was crushing.</p>

<p>"I think magic went out when people began to have steam-engines,"
Jimmy insisted, "and newspapers, and telephones and wireless telegraphing."</p>

<p>"Wireless is rather like magic when you come to think of it,"
said Gerald.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>that</em> sort!" Jimmy's contempt was deep.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there's given up being magic because people didn't believe
in it any more," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Well, don't let's spoil the show with any silly old not believing,"
said Gerald with decision. "I'm going to believe in magic as hard
as I can. This is an enchanted garden, and that's an enchanted
castle, and I'm jolly well going to explore. The dauntless knight
then led the way, leaving his ignorant squires to follow or not,
just as they jolly well chose." He rolled off the balustrade and
strode firmly down towards the lawn, his boots making, as they
went, a clatter full of determination.</p>

<p>The others followed. There never was such a garden&mdash;out of a
picture or a fairy tale. They passed quite close by the deer,
who only raised their pretty heads to look, and did not seem startled
at all. And after a long stretch of turf they passed under the
heaped-up heavy masses of lime-trees and came into a rose-garden,
bordered with thick, close-cut yew hedges, and lying red and pink
and green and white in the sun, like a giant's many-coloured,
highly-scented pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I know we shall meet a gardener in a minute, and he'll ask what
we're doing here. And then what will you say?" Kathleen asked
with her nose in a rose.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>THIS IS AN ENCHANTED GARDEN AND THAT'S AN
ENCHANTED CASTLE</em>."]</p>

<p>"I shall say we've lost our way, and it will be quite true,"
said Gerald.</p>

<p>But they did not meet a gardener or anybody else, and the feeling
of magic got thicker and thicker, till they were almost afraid
of the sound of their feet in the great silent place. Beyond the
rose garden was a yew hedge with an arch cut in it, and it was
the beginning of a maze like the one in Hampton Court.</p>

<p>"Now," said Gerald, "you mark my words. In the middle of this
maze we shall find the secret enchantment. Draw your swords, my
merry men all, and hark forward tallyho in the utmost silence."</p>

<p>Which they did.</p>

<p>It was very hot in the maze, between the close yew hedges, and
the way to the maze's heart was hidden well. Again and again they
found themselves at the black yew arch that opened on the rose
garden, and they were all glad that they had brought large, clean
pocket-handkerchiefs with them.</p>

<p>It was when they found themselves there for the fourth time that
Jimmy suddenly cried, "Oh, I wish<hr>" and then stopped short
very suddenly. "Oh!" he added in quite a different voice, "where's
the dinner?" And then in a stricken silence they all remembered
that the basket with the dinner had been left at the entrance
of the cave. Their thoughts dwelt fondly on the slices of cold
mutton, the six tomatoes, the bread and butter, the screwed-up
paper of salt, the apple turnovers, and the little thick glass
that one drank the gingerbeer out of.</p>

<p>"Let's go back," said Jimmy, "now this minute, and get our things
and have our dinner."</p>

<p>"Let's have one more try at the maze. I hate giving things up,"
said Gerald.</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> so hungry!" said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so before?" asked Gerald bitterly.</p>

<p>"I wasn't before."</p>

<p>"Then you can't be now. You don't get hungry all in a minute.
What's that?"</p>

<p>"That" was a gleam of red that lay at the foot of the yew hedge&mdash;a
thin little line, that you would hardly have noticed unless you
had been staring in a fixed and angry way at the roots of the
hedge.</p>

<p>It was a thread of cotton. Gerald picked it up. One end of it
was tied to a thimble with holes in it, and the other<hr></p>

<p>"There <em>is</em> no other end," said Gerald, with firm triumph.
"It's a clue&mdash;that's what it is. What price cold mutton now? I've
always felt something magic would happen some day, and now it
has."</p>

<p>"I expect the gardener put it there," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"With a Princess's silver thimble on it? Look! there's a crown
on the thimble."</p>

<p>There was.</p>

<p>"Come," said Gerald in low, urgent tones, "if you are adventurers
<em>be</em> adventurers; and anyhow, I expect some one has gone
along the road and bagged the mutton hours ago."</p>

<p>He walked forward, winding the red thread round his fingers as
he went. And it <em>was</em> a clue, and it led them right into
the middle of the maze. And in the very middle of the maze they
came upon the wonder.</p>

<p>The red clue led them up two stone steps to a round grass plot.
There was a sun-dial in the middle, and all round against the
yew hedge a low, wide marble seat. The red clue ran straight across
the grass and by the sun-dial, and ended in a small brown hand
with jewelled rings on every finger. The hand was, naturally,
attached to an arm, and that had many bracelets on it, sparkling
with red and blue and green stones. The arm wore a sleeve of pink
and gold brocaded silk, faded a little here and there but still
extremely imposing, and the sleeve was part of a dress, which
was worn by a lady who lay on the stone seat asleep in the sun.
The rosy gold dress fell open over an embroidered petticoat of
a soft green colour. There was old yellow lace the colour of scalded
cream, and a thin white veil spangled with silver stars covered
the face.</p>

<p>"It's the enchanted Princess," said Gerald, now really impressed.
"I told you so."</p>

<p>"It's the Sleeping Beauty," said Kathleen. "It is&mdash;look how old-fashioned
her clothes are, like the pictures of Marie Antoinette's ladies
in the history book. She has slept for a hundred years. Oh, Gerald,
you're the eldest; you must be the Prince, and we never knew it."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE RED CLUE RAN STRAIGHT ACROSS THE GRASS
AND BY THE SUN-DIAL, AND ENDED IN A SMALL BROWN HAND</em>.]</p>

<p>"She isn't really a Princess," said Jimmy. But the others laughed
at him, partly because his saying things like that was enough
to spoil any game, and partly because they really were not at
all sure that it was not a Princess who lay there as still as
the sunshine. Every stage of the adventure&mdash;the cave, the wonderful
gardens, the maze, the clue, had deepened the feeling of magic,
till now Kathleen and Gerald were almost completely bewitched.</p>

<p>"Lift the veil up, Jerry," said Kathleen in a whisper; "if she
isn't beautiful we shall know she can't be the Princess."</p>

<p>"Lift it yourself," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"I expect you're forbidden to touch the figures," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"It's not wax, silly," said his brother.</p>

<p>"No," said his sister, "wax wouldn't be much good in this sun.
And, besides, you can see her breathing. It's the Princess right
enough." She very gently lifted the edge of the veil and turned
it back. The Princess's face was small and white between long
plaits of black hair. Her nose was straight and her brows finely
traced. There were a few freckles on cheek-bones and nose.</p>

<p>"No wonder," whispered Kathleen, "sleeping all these years in
all this sun!" Her mouth was not a rosebud. But all the same&mdash;</p>

<p>"Isn't she lovely!" Kathleen murmured.</p>

<p>"Not so dusty," Gerald was understood to reply.</p>

<p>"Now, Jerry," said Kathleen firmly, "you're the eldest."</p>

<p>"Of course I am," said Gerald uneasily.</p>

<p>"Well, you've got to wake the Princess."</p>

<p>"She's not a Princess," said Jimmy, with his hands in the pockets
of his knickerbockers; "she's only a little girl dressed up."</p>

<p>"But she's in long dresses," urged Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Yes, but look what a little way down her frock her feet come.
She wouldn't be any taller than Jerry if she was to stand up."</p>

<p>"Now then," urged Kathleen. "Jerry, don't be silly. You've got
to do it."</p>

<p>"Do what?" asked Gerald, kicking his left boot with his right.</p>

<p>"Why, kiss her awake, of course."</p>

<p>"Not me!" was Gerald's unhesitating rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Well, some one's got to."</p>

<p>"She'd go for me as likely as not the minute she woke up," said
Gerald anxiously.</p>

<p>"I'd do it like a shot," said Kathleen, "but I don't suppose
it ud make any difference me kissing her."</p>

<p>She did it; and it didn't. The Princess still lay in deep slumber.</p>

<p>"Then you must, Jimmy. I daresay you'll do. Jump back quickly
before she can hit you."</p>

<p>"She won't hit him, he's such a little chap," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"Little yourself!" said Jimmy. "<em>I</em> don't mind kissing
her. I'm not a coward, like Some People. Only if I do, I'm going
to be the dauntless leader for the rest of the day."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE THREE STOOD BREATHLESS, AWAITING THE RESULT</em>.]</p>

<p>"No, look here&mdash;hold on!" cried Gerald, "perhaps I'd better<hr>"
But, in the meantime, Jimmy had planted a loud, cheerful-sounding
kiss on the Princess's pale cheek, and now the three stood breathless,
awaiting the result.</p>

<p>And the result was that the Princess opened large, dark eyes,
stretched out her arms, yawned a little, covering her mouth with
a small brown hand, and said, quite plainly and distinctly, and
without any room at all for mistake:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then the hundred years are over? How the yew hedges have grown!
Which of you is my Prince that aroused me from my deep sleep of
so many long years?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Jimmy fearlessly, for she did not look as though
she were going to slap any one.</p>

<p>"My noble preserver!" said the Princess, and held out her hand.
Jimmy shook it vigorously.</p>

<p>"But I say," said he, "you aren't really a Princess, are you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am," she answered; "who else could I be? Look at
my crown!" She pulled aside the spangled veil, and showed beneath
it a coronet of what even Jimmy could not help seeing to be diamonds.</p>

<p>"But<hr>" said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Why," she said, opening her eyes very wide, "you must have known
about my being here, or you'd never have come. How <em>did</em>
you get past the dragons?"</p>

<p>Gerald ignored the question. "I say," he said, "do you really
believe in magic, and all that?"</p>

<p>"I ought to," she said, "if anybody does. Look, here's the place
where I pricked my finger with the spindle." She showed a little
scar on her wrist.</p>

<p>"Then this really <em>is</em> an enchanted castle?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said the Princess. "How stupid you are!" She
stood up, and her pink brocaded dress lay in bright waves about
her feet.</p>

<p>"I said her dress would be too long," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"It was the right length when I went to sleep," said the Princess;
"it must have grown in the hundred years."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you're a Princess at all," said Jimmy; "at least<hr>"</p>

<p>"Don't bother about believing it, if you don't like," said the
Princess. "It doesn't so much matter what you believe as what
I am." She turned to the others.</p>

<p>"Let's go back to the castle," she said, "and I'll show you all
my lovely jewels and things. Wouldn't you like that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gerald with very plain hesitation. "But<hr>"</p>

<p>"But what?" The Princess's tone was impatient.</p>

<p>"But we're most awfully hungry."</p>

<p>"Oh, so am I!" cried the Princess.</p>

<p>"We've had nothing to eat since breakfast."</p>

<p>"And it's three now," said the Princess, looking at the sun-dial.
"Why, you've had nothing to eat for hours and hours and hours.
But think of me! I haven't had anything to eat for a hundred years.
Come along to the castle."</p>

<p>"The mice will have eaten everything," said Jimmy sadly. He saw
now that she really <em>was</em> a Princess.</p>

<p>"Not they," cried the Princess joyously. "You forget everything's
enchanted here. Time simply stood still for a hundred years. Come
along, and one of you must carry my train, or I shan't be able
to move now it's grown such a frightful length."</p>
