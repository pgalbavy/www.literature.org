<p>Every one sat very still lest an excited movement or gesture precipitate
the storm. From my place on the slightly elevated witness chair I had a
full view of the scene in all its ominous tensity. It was as though
breathing had not alone stopped, but all living animation had for the
second been suspended. The body of men had been fixed as though
photographed. An incautious start or the sweep of a hand pocket-ward,
and the outburst would be inevitable.
</p><p>There were three exceptions among those whom I may term non-combatants.
One reporter began edging down behind the table. Weighborne
unostentatiously shifted his position so as to place his bulky shoulders
between Frances Weighborne and the crowd, and She with an impatient
shifting declined his shielding and sat steadily looking to the front.
She was pale, as I suppose we all were, but perfectly composed.
</p><p>Then Marcus wheeled and faced the rear of the room, deliberately turning
his back on the enemies who might kill him as they had killed his
partner. With both hands raised above his head and his thin, cuffless
wrists stretching out of his threadbare sleeves, he stood for a tense
moment in silence. His rugged countenance was black with the vehemence
of feeling and his deep eyes were burning.
</p><p>"_Sit down!_" he thundered. He said no other word, but as he ripped out
that crisp and brief command he swept both arms and hands downward, and,
like hypnotic subjects answering the gesture of the demonstrator, his
clansmen dropped into their seats. Garvin took the cue. He pounded on
his desk with the gavel. "Order in the court-room," he shouted, and his
henchmen also subsided into their benches.
</p><p>A deep breath of relief swept over the place. The crisis was averted.
Garvin beckoned Marcus and the opposing counsel to his side.
"Gentlemen," he said coolly, "the boys seem a little excited. Unless
there is an objection I'm goin' to adjourn co'te for a half-hour, and
then keep this room clear of spectators." But the moment of peril had
passed and when I reached the square with the attorney, who hastily
spirited me out by the back door, I saw the two elements mingling with a
semblance of entire peace.
</p><p>Marcus took me directly to his office where we were busied with a
supplemental and more exact affidavit, and I did not see the
Weighbornes. I knew that any meeting must be a most unhappy occasion,
and until this matter was disposed of I was willing to postpone that
final clash. We were shortly interrupted by the arrival of the county
attorney, who announced that at the reconvening of court he would move
to dismiss the cases. He said he realized that there could be no
conviction and would not risk precipitating a conflict. Marcus could
hardly refuse to allow his clients to go free, and so for the time he
had to accept that surrender and reserve his ammunition for later
effectiveness.
</p><p>To the Marcus house we rode in cort√®ge. I had not intended running at
all, but when I came out of the law office I found that Weighborne had
been much fatigued and had already started back with another guard, and
I could hardly run away without facing the two of them. Marcus too,
insisted that I must return, even if only for a day. Much of our
business remained unfinished, and I inferred from his attitude that he
knew nothing of the inevitable reckoning which I must face at the hands
of my business partner. We started late and our small army arrived after
nine o'clock. It was again a night of sparkle and starlight and frost.
We learned that supper had been saved for us and the attorney and I ate
it in silence. The Weighbornes had not waited for us. I quite
understood that they might not care to break bread with me, and yet I
was puzzled, because in that paralyzed moment in the court-room when I
had, for the only time during the day, looked full in the lady's eyes, I
had seen no anger in them. I had almost fancied that her lips
half-shaped a smile. But she was a remarkable woman, and whatever her
feeling, she might be magnanimous enough and big enough at such a
moment, when we were all in equal danger, to lay aside for the nonce her
just resentment. Now we should meet again as though that had not
happened, and I had no hope of seeing her smile on me again.
</p><p>Probably she had retired and I should not have to meet her until
to-morrow. I rose from the table and turned to Marcus.
</p><p>"Where do I sleep to-night?" I inquired.
</p><p>"Your same place, sir," he answered, and when I had said good-night I
turned and walked along the porch and opened the door of the room which
served jointly as parlor and bedroom.
</p><p>Once more, precisely as on that other night, I halted in surprise.
Indeed, it might have been the other night, except that Weighborne lay
where he had thrown himself down fully dressed across the big bed. But
just as before, he was sleeping, and just as before She sat before the
fire alone, in much the same attitude. On her face was the same trace of
wistful loneliness.
</p><p>I could not escape the feeling that this was in reality a part of the
other evening--that it had been momentarily interrupted and that all
which had transpired since I had opened this same door in this exact
way, and seen this precise picture, was only the figment of disordered
imagination. But it was now too late to turn back, and after all there
was nothing to gain by deferring the reckoning. The three of us were
here, and it would take only a moment to wake the sleeping man.
</p><p>I closed the door, and my heart began the wild beating that meeting her
must always bring. As I started across the room she looked up and rose.
I halted where I stood, waiting for her to speak. This evening she wore
a very simple gingham dress, and the chill of the room had led her to
add the sweater. For a breathing space we stood there, she as slender
and youthful as a school-girl; I as awkward and disheveled as a bumpkin,
with my head hanging shamefacedly--awaiting sentence.
</p><p>Then to my total bewilderment she smiled and held out her hand.
</p><p>Had she stricken me down with a lightning bolt as the savages thought
she had stricken down the profaning native, I should have been less
astonished. I stood there unable to understand such forgiveness, and
while I waited, she spoke.
</p><p>"Now," said the voice which had been ringing in my heart ever since I
had last heard it, "will you be good enough to explain things, or are
you still to be the man of mystery?"
</p><p>How could I explain things? How could I make a commencement? And yet it
was just that which I had come to attempt.
</p><p>"If I can explain at all," I said, very miserably, "it will be in one
word--madness."
</p><p>"Is that all?" she questioned. In her eyes was the whimsical challenge
that had, on the previous occasion, swept me away from my moorings. The
question that I had asked myself once before came back to my mind. Could
it be that my goddess was so far from my ideal that, after all, what had
occurred needed no explanation? I would not admit such a possibility,
and yet her next words seemed to confirm it.
</p><p>"When I first came here," she mused reflectively and only half-aloud,
"you stayed outside for an hour, and then you disappeared. Of course you
were a prisoner, but to-day you had the opportunity to see us. You
didn't--and yet--" she flushed deeply, and I knew that her thoughts too
were going back to the moment when I had, without words, avowed myself
so savagely.
</p><p>"I stayed out there that night," I said bluntly, "because I could hardly
be an interloper, when you had ridden these infernal hills to be with
<u>him</u>--" I jerked my head savagely toward the bed. Then I went doggedly
on, determined that since she had forced me this far we should hereafter
stand in the certain light of understanding. "I also stayed out there
because, as it happens, I'm a fool. I couldn't endure witnessing a
reunion between yourself and your husband." It seemed to me that she
should first have called on me for other explanations.
</p><p>At the last word her face clouded with an expression of absolute
bewilderment, and her eyes widened as she gazed at me.
</p><p>"My--my <u>what</u>?" she demanded.
</p><p>"Your husband," I repeated. "Mr. Weighborne."
</p><p>She contemplated me as though I were a new and rather interesting
variety of maniac, then her laugh was long and delicious. Her clouded
eyes cleared and danced like skies in which the sun has suddenly burst
through rain.
</p><p>"Oh," she said finally. "I understand now." Once more her face grew
grave and she added with a catch in her voice.
</p><p>"And, thank God, I <u>do</u> understand."
</p><p>"For Heaven's sake," I implored, "tell me what you understand! As for
me, I understand nothing."
</p><p>"Why, you totally unspeakable idiot," she explained, as though she had
known me always, and as though we had long been close comrades, "I
haven't any husband--yet. That's my brother. Didn't you know that?"
</p><p>I stood at gaze, dazed, stupefied, open-mouthed; every thing that
denotes the gawky fool. Then I dropped fervently on my knees at her feet
and shamelessly seized her hands in mine and kissed them. She made no
effort to release them and I crushed them greedily while my tongue could
find no words, until, as I afterward learned, her rings cut into the
flesh.
</p><p>"But," I stammered finally, "you are Frances Weighborne. His wife is
Frances Weighborne. Bob Maxwell told me--"
</p><p>She laughed again, and Weighborne's heavy breathing became almost a
snore. After all, first impressions are best. Weighborne was a capital
fellow, one could not help liking him.
</p><p>"Correct," said the lady indulgently, as though she were teaching a
small boy his primer lessons. "I am Frances Weighborne. My sister-in-law
was also christened Frances in baptism, and acquired the surname of
Weighborne in matrimony. There may, so far as I know, be various other
Frances Weighbornes. We have never copyrighted the name."
</p><p>"Oh, my God!" I groaned helplessly. "What an unspeakable imbecile I've
been--but you're wrong, dearest, you <u>are</u> the only one."
</p><p>"Do you think it necessary to swear about it?" she inquired. "And are
you now quite certain that I'm the right one?"
</p><p>"There isn't any time to swear," I assured her, "there is so infinitely
much to say--but not here. Come out under the stars, where one can
breathe. Give me five minutes. Unless I speak now I shall die of
suppressed emotion. All my life I've been a supposedly extinct volcano.
I'm no longer extinct." I halted my rush of words; then added, "Yes,
you're the right one." I rose and, still holding her hands, lifted her
to her feet. At the door, with my hand on the latch, I paused.
</p><p>"No," I exclaimed, hardly realizing that I was speaking aloud. "You open
it. In the dream it is always you who open the door into the other
world."
</p><p>She wheeled and looked me in the eyes, her own pupils wide and
incredulous.
</p><p>"Do you have it, too?" she demanded breathlessly. "Do you dream my
dream? Do I come to you in some vague danger and lead you through a
door?"
</p><p>She laid her hand on the bolt, just as I had so often seen her do in my
vision, and we stepped together out into the glory of the frost and
moon.
</p><p>"As you are doing now," I answered; then with a new wonder I demanded,
"But tell me, how in Heaven's name could you dream of me before you knew
me?"
</p><p>She laughed mockingly.
</p><p>"Perhaps," she vouchsafed, "if you make yourself very agreeable I may
tell you."
