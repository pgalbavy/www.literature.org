<p>It was an astounding discovery.</p>

<p>With never a thought of the grotesque mistake, both youths had
boarded the launch believing it to be the <em>Deerfoot</em>; they
had pursued the imaginary fugitive only to awaken to the fact
that she was not a fugitive, and that they had unconsciously stolen
the property of the burglars, which must have been lying so near
their own craft that the slight difference of location was not
noticed.</p>

<p>Chester stepped down and seated himself at the elbow of his chum.</p>

<p>"Here are only four seats instead of six. Why didn't we notice
it before?"</p>

<p>"Because we were too much occupied with other things, or rather
were both struck with blindness just then. As Mike would say,
I'm completely flabbergasted."</p>

<p>"And I'm with you. What's to be done now?"</p>

<p>"Tell me where the <em>Deerfoot</em> is."</p>

<p>"Ask me something easier. She may be lying where we left her,
or twenty miles away."</p>

<p>"We should have heard her if she came down stream."</p>

<p>"She may have gone up the river and around into the Sheepscot."</p>

<p>"And back to the former hiding place of this boat or to a different
one&mdash;the 'Beautiful Isle of Somewhere,'" said Alvin grimly.</p>

<p>"One place will serve as well as another. I wonder whether there
was ever so wonderful a mix-up of launches since such craft were
known."</p>

<p>Alvin shut off power and the two listened. From some point miles
away came the hoarse growl of a steam whistle, but all else was
still. He had hoped that they would hear the <em>Deerfoot's</em>
exhaust, but nothing of the kind came to their ears. He flirted
the switch around and resumed the speed which was not above half
a dozen miles an hour.</p>

<p>One of the plagues of the Maine coast is the dense fogs which
sometimes creep far up the rivers. Such an obscurity now began
settling over Montsweag Bay and Back River, shutting out the moonlight
as well as the rays of the rising sun. Before Alvin was aware,
he could not see either shore until he had run far over to the
right and caught a shadowy sight of the pines, spruce and firs
which lined the bank. The air dripped moisture and, though it
was summer, it grew chilly.</p>

<p>While gliding slowly forward they heard a steamer's bell, accompanied
by occasional blasts from her whistle. She was feeling her way
down stream and sounding warnings to other craft. By and by the
beat of her screw and the ripple of the water from her bow sounded
so near that Alvin edged closer to land. In the heavy mist loomed
a minute later a bulky steamer, surging southward at sluggish
speed, the crew, as seen for an instant, looking like saturated
ghosts.</p>

<p>The boat was quickly swallowed up, her bell still tolling, with
blasts from her whistle at short intervals.</p>

<p>Seated as described, the two youths discussed what was the best
thing to do. It seemed advisable to return to the point from which
they started, that is, near Beartown landing. There was not one
chance in a hundred that they would find the <em>Deerfoot</em>
there, but such a thing was not impossible. That which made this
policy seem wise was the likelihood of again meeting Detective
Calvert. The news of the attempted robbery of the Beartown post
office would be telegraphed far and wide, and he would be sure
to hear of it at Wiscasset. It would not take him and his brother
officer long to reach the village, where the lads could hope to
see him.</p>

<p>It was certainly a singular coincidence that the launch should
be twice stolen in so brief a time, and the owner grimly asked
himself whether fate had not ordained that he was to lose it after
all.</p>

<p>There was no light in the maze of conjecture that opened before
them. Chester suggested an alarming complication.</p>

<p>"The <em>Deerfoot</em> can outspeed any craft in the Maine waters.
These burglars must have a hiding place, and we know there is
no end to them among the bays, inlets, coves and islands that
stud the rivers. Suppose they board the launch and speed away
till all pursuit is thrown off the scent&mdash;something they can easily
do&mdash;and then abandon the boat."</p>

<p>"We shall find her sooner or later, and Calvert will perhaps
in this way get on their track."</p>

<p>"They can avert such danger by sinking her in deep water, where
she may not be found for years."</p>

<p>"I have not thought of that. It looks as if they had the whip-hand.
These fellows may have blundered last night, but it was solely
through the sudden appearance of Mike on the spot, for they are
no fools. If we try to get the best of them we shall get the worst,
unless we have the help of Mr. Calvert."</p>

<p>"And the only way to gain that is to go back to Beartown."</p>

<p>"So it seems to me. What do you think?" asked the Captain.</p>

<p>"I know of nothing better. Wouldn't it be well to hit up the
pace a little?"</p>

<p>"If this fog would only lift! But it seems to be growing thicker.
We must feel our way."</p>

<p>While the Captain was doing this, his second mate looked over
the <em>Water Witch</em>. Its resemblance to the <em>Deerfoot</em>
was remarkable. It was probably two or three feet shorter, but
that was the only noticeable difference. The model was the same,
even to the color of the paint used. As has already been said,
however, there were only four seats while the <em>Deerfoot</em>
had six. The similarity of the craft was proved by the fact that
Alvin Landon boarded and ran it for quite a number of miles before
even the slightest suspicion entered his mind.</p>

<p>All landmarks were shut from view until, as may be said, the
launch ran against them. The boys had little or no acquaintance
with the river they were ascending, and only here and there were
they able to identify certain landings or towns from their previous
study of the map. Alvin knew he was creeping northward, and sooner
or later must reach the point which he left during the latter
part of the night. Even the landing would not be recognized without
close study, and possibly not even then.</p>

<p>Had not the noise made by the progress of the launch shut out
a certain sound and had not the dense fog hidden something from
sight, the two would have made a startling discovery within the
hour which followed their turning back. But no knowledge of that
nature came to them.</p>

<p>The boys agreed that they would not reach their destination until
long after their change of course. Neither noted when this was
done, but Chester now looked at his watch and found it showed
a few minutes to seven.</p>

<p>"A good hour for breakfast," he remarked, "and my appetite is
with me, as I am sure yours is with you."</p>

<p>Alvin nodded and kept his eye on the receding shore and the water
ahead.</p>

<p>"Mike is to be envied, for the good woman and especially the
daughter will give him the best their house can afford. These
boats don't carry a large stock of provisions&mdash;who knows but there's
something of the kind on board?"</p>

<p>He asked the Captain to rise while he lifted the cushioned lid
of the locker upon which he had been sitting. The next moment
Chester uttered a joyous cry.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! we're in luck!"</p>

<p>He held up a large paper bag into which he had peeped. It contained
half a dozen plump ham sandwiches.</p>

<p>"While we are about it suppose we see what other treasures are
in the ship's chest."</p>

<p>They found a most interesting stock indeed. Five black pieces
of muslin, each with two peep-holes, several sets of false whiskers,
two pairs of brass knuckles, three metal rings from each of which
dangled more than a dozen keys of varying sizes, a box of revolver
cartridges, a formidable knife, some twine and a number of articles
of no importance.</p>

<p>"They tell their story," said Chester, holding them up one after
another for his chum's inspection. "If the officers of the law
arrest us, we shall have to depend upon our friends to prove an
alibi."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile there is no need to keep those sandwiches waiting."</p>

<p>"Wonder if they are poisoned," laughed Chester, as he passed
one to his chum, and sank his teeth in another. "Anyhow, I'm going
to take chances."</p>

<p>"So am I. They don't seem to have any cooking utensils on board,
so coffee and warm food are to be denied us."</p>

<p>The Captain ate with one hand on the steering wheel, and frequent
glances ahead. Now and then they would find themselves approaching
a sharp projection of land, around which the launch was steered,
and then perhaps would glide past a cunning looking cove, too
narrow to admit a boat of large size. Once, while doubling a cape,
they came within a hair of running down a small rowboat propelled
by a single occupant. He shouted angrily for the steersman to
keep a better lookout.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry!" called back Alvin; "but the fog bothers us. Will
you please tell me how far it is to Beartown landing?"</p>

<p>"'Bout half a mile, mebbe a little more. Who are you?"</p>

<p>Alvin gave his right name and thanked the man for his information.</p>

<p>"I thought that was about the distance," said Chester, as he
resumed the duty of sentinel. "I can't recognize any landmark,
and couldn't if there was no fog to play the mischief with our
sight."</p>

<p>Alvin stopped the engine two or three times while approaching
the spot, in order to listen for sounds of the other boat. They
heard nothing, but had they not waited too long to make the experiment,
they would have picked up some exceedingly interesting information.</p>

<p>"Here's the spot!" called Chester a few minutes later, as he
identified the spiderlike landing from which a road led to Beartown.</p>

<p>"Then we have passed the place where the launch lay up last night.
We may as well go beyond and be out of the way of folks."</p>

<p>A hundred yards north of the wharf, too far to see it when they
looked back, the <em>Water Witch</em> came gently to rest, the
waiting Chester sprang ashore with a line in hand and made fast.</p>
