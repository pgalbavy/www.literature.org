<p>Jack Carleton was too sensible a youth to suppose that the Lost
Trail could be found by a blind wandering through the immense
expanse of wilderness, which stretched hundreds of miles in almost
every direction from the little settlement of Martinsville. Both
he and Otto had a strong hope, when they reached home after their
stirring adventure with Deerfoot, that the colt Toby would follow
them of his own accord. He belonged to a species possessing such
unusual intelligence that there would have been nothing remarkable
in such a proceeding, and the fact that he did not do so, gave
ground for the belief that he had fallen into the hands of parties
who prevented the animal from doing as he chose.</p>

<p>One fact was clearly established; Toby had been within a comparatively
short distance of the settlement, and, if he had remained anywhere
in the neighborhood during the late storm, traces of him must
be found without much difficulty. But one of the easiest things
in the world is to theorize over any problem; to push that theory
to a successful conclusion is altogether another matter.</p>

<p>While it lacked a couple of hours of noon, the boys reached an
elevated section which gave them an extended view in every direction.
Looking to the eastward, Otto fancied he could detect the gleam
of the distant Mississippi, but Jack assured him he was mistaken.
Too many miles lay between them and the mighty Father of Waters
for the eye to traverse the space.</p>

<p>Young Carleton took off his cap and drew his handkerchief across
his perspiring forehead. Then he sighed and smiled.</p>

<p>"This doesn't appear so hopeful to me as it did last night, when
we sat around the fire and talked it over; but of course we won't
give up so long as there's the least hope."</p>

<p>"And it won't do for me to give him up then," replied Otto, with
a meaning shake of his head; "you don't know my fader as well
as me."</p>

<p>"I don't want to either," remarked Jack, who did not think it
his duty to refrain from showing the contempt he felt for the
miserly, cruel parent of his friend.</p>

<p>"No," observed Otto, with a touch of that grim humor which he
sometimes displayed, "I doesn't dinks dot you and him could have
much fun together."</p>

<p>The young friends were too accustomed to the immensity of nature,
as displayed on every hand, to feel specially impressed by the
scene which would have held any one else enthralled. It may be
said they were "on business," though it had very much the appearance
of sport.</p>

<p>"Halloo! I expected it!" called out Jack Carleton, whose gaze
abruptly rested on a point due southwest, and more than a mile
away.</p>

<p>His companion did not need the guidance of the outstretched arm
and index finger leveled toward the distant spot, where the smoke
of a camp-fire was seen climbing toward the blue sky. The scene
on which the boys looked was similar to that which met the eye
of Ned Preston and Deerfoot when they lay on the broad flat rock
and gazed across at the signal-fire in the distance.</p>

<p>The wooded country gradually sloped to the south and west from
the elevation whereon the young friends had halted, slowly rising
and undulating until the eye could follow the blue wavy outlines
no further. At the point already named, and in the lowest portion
of the intervening country, a camp-fire was burning. The smoke,
as it filtered upward through the branches of the trees, and gradually
dissolved in the pure air above, was seen with such distinctness
that it caught the eye of Jack the moment it was turned in that
direction.</p>

<p>It was not a signal-fire, such as one is likely to detect when
journeying through an Indian country, but the vapor from the camp
of some body of men who were not making the slightest attempt
to conceal themselves, for it cannot be conceived that they had
any reason for doing so.</p>

<p>If the party were Indians, they surely had no necessity for stationing
a sentinel on the outskirts of their camp to watch for danger.</p>

<p>Jack and Otto looked in each other's faces and smiled; the natural
question had presented itself at the same moment. It was, "Can
it be that the horse we are seeking is with them?"</p>

<p>"The only way to find out is to go forward and see for ourselves,"
said Jack, after they had discussed the question for several minutes.</p>

<p>"'Spose dot de horse is with them&mdash;what den?"</p>

<p>Jack shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot used to say that he could never answer such a question
until he knew exactly how everything stood. Now, we can't be certain
whether they are Indians or white men, and I don't know as it
makes much difference one way or the other, for our own horse
thieves over in Kentucky were dreaded as much as were the Shawanoes.
They were a good deal meaner, too, for they oppressed their own
race."</p>

<p>"Dot is vot I sometimes dinks of fader," was the unexpected remark
of Otto; "if he was only a colored man or Injin I would have more
respect for him; dot is so."</p>

<p>"Come on; we have started out to do something, and we can't gain
anything by staying here."</p>

<p>The brief halt had refreshed the boys, and they now moved forward
with their naturally vigorous and almost bounding steps. While
they had much curiosity, and a somewhat singular misgiving, yet
they were in no particular fear, for it was impossible to believe
they were in any real peril.</p>

<p>It was quite a tramp to reach the camp in which just then they
felt so much interest, and the sun was close to meridian when
Jack, who was slightly in advance, slackened his gait, and remarked
in an undertone:</p>

<p>"It can't be far&mdash;halloo!"</p>

<p>While picking their way through the valley, they lost sight of
the wavering column of vapor, except once or twice when they were
able to catch a glimpse of it through the tree-tops. Jack's exclamation
was caused by another sight of the murky column, which, as he
suspected, proved to be little more than a hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>There was so much undergrowth that nothing of the fire itself
could be observed, though the smoke showed itself distinctly in
the clear air above.</p>

<p>"Vell, vot does we does now?" was the natural query of Otto,
as he placed himself beside his young friend.</p>

<p>"I guess we may as well keep on, until we find out who they are."</p>

<p>"After we finds out vot we does den?"</p>

<p>"We shall see&mdash;come on."</p>

<p>It was simple prudence that they should speak in whispers, and
step with as much care as if they were scouts entering the camp
of an enemy. It would have been rashness to neglect so simple
a precaution, no matter how favorable the circumstances.</p>

<p>"Holds on!" whispered Otto, "I dinks I goes around the oder side
while you takes a look on dis side."</p>

<p>"There is no need of doing that," interposed Jack; "we found
out the consequence of separating when in danger. You needn't
keep behind me, but you may walk at my side."</p>

<p>"All right," responded Otto, obeying the suggestion.</p>

<p>A rod or two further, and something red gleamed, among the trees
and undergrowth. Smoke was observed at the same moment, and immediately
after came the hum of voices and the sight of persons stretched
on the ground in lolling, indolent positions, while some were
sitting on a fallen tree, and two were engaged in broiling some
venison, which evidently was meant to furnish dinner for the rest.
The majority were smoking a species of red clay pipe, and the
appearance of the party suggested that they were resting after
a laborious tramp through the woods.</p>

<p>There were precisely ten, and they were Indians&mdash;every one. Jack
could not be certain of the tribe to which they belonged, but
inasmuch as it was apparent they were neither Shawanoes nor Hurons,
he was confident they were Osages, though it was not impossible
that their totem was another altogether.</p>

<p>Several peculiarities about the strange Indians interested the
youth. They were noticeably shorter in stature than the Hurons
and Shawanoes whom they had been accustomed to meet on the other
side of the Mississippi. The poetical American Indian is far different
from the one in real life. It is rarely that a really handsome
warrior or squaw is met. They are, generally a slouchy, frowsy,
lazy, unclean people, of whom nothing is truer than that distance
lends enchantment to their view.</p>

<p>Those upon whom Jack and Otto gazed with natural curiosity, were
not only shorter in stature, but of homelier countenance. Their
eyes were smaller, more piggish, and further apart, their cheek-bones
more prominent, the foreheads lower and more sloping, while Jack
always asserted that they had much larger mouths than the Indians
with whom he was familiar.</p>

<p>While asking themselves whether it was wise to go any closer
and to make their acquaintance, the lads stood side by side, each
with the stock of his gun resting on the earth, while their whole
attention was absorbed by the curious scene before them.</p>

<p>It would naturally follow that if the Indian party was in such
plain sight of the boys, they themselves must have been visible
to the red men had they chosen to cast their searching glances
towards the spot where the two were standing, even though the
latter were partially hidden by the undergrowth.</p>

<p>Had Jack and Otto been as vigilant and suspicious as they ought
to have been, their misgivings would have been awakened by what
took place within the next ten minutes. Two of the warriors, leaving
their rifles where they were leaning against a fallen tree, leisurely
rose and sauntered into the woods, taking a course directly opposite
to that which would have led them to where the boys stood. The
latter observed the movement, but thought nothing of it.</p>

<p>"What do you say?" finally asked Jack, in a guarded voice; "shall
we go forward and make their acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"Dey haven't any horses that we can see, and I dinks dot we better
goes away till some other time."</p>

<p>"I am inclined to believe you are right&#11834;"</p>

<p>At that moment, and without the least warning, a brawny, coppery
arm shot over the shoulder of Jack Carleton, and, grasping his
rifle with an iron grip, snatched it from him. At the same instant,
a precisely similar movement deprived Otto Relstaub of his most
important weapon, the two friends being made prisoners before
they dreamed they were in the least danger.</p>
