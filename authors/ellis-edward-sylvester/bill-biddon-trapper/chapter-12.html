<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I took a direction nearly due east toward the Black Hills. Near
the middle of the day I reached the shore of a lake. It was a
small, beautiful sheet of water, its glistening surface unruffled
by a single ripple, and I stood a long time gazing upon its placid
bosom. The blue outline of the opposite shore was faintly visible
in the distance, and here and there the green face of a tiny island
protruded from its surface adding greatly to the picturesqueness
of the scene.</p>

<p>As I stood looking dreamily out upon this lake, my eyes rested
upon a small speck, just discernible far toward the other side.
It was too small and dark to be an island, and, furthermore, I
fancied it was moving. A moment more satisfied me that it was
a canoe crossing the lake nearly to the point upon which I was
standing. So small and black was it, that for a long time I was
tempted to believe it was nothing but a bird floating upon the
surface; but the flashing of the oars in the sunshine showed its
true nature, and I waited anxiously its approach.</p>

<p>On it came, slowly and steadily, its form gradually increasing
as it approached, until I could discover the outlines of a single
man propelling it over the water. A sudden hope that it might
be Nat himself came over me, but as it came nigher, the dazzling
plumes of a savage convinced me of my mistake. It struck me as
a little singular that the Indian, solitary and alone, should
approach so unhesitatingly a stranger, and I was upon the point
of concealing myself; but, knowing that I must have been seen,
and that such a proceeding would only awaken suspicion upon his
part, I remained boldly in view.</p>

<p>A few minutes later and the canoe grated upon the sand a few
yards from me; and, daubed in all the glittering paraphernalia
of savage war-paint and plumes, no less a personage than Nat stepped
ashore and approached me!</p>

<p>I was upon the point of calling out to him, when I saw he did
not recognize me. Since we had last been together my beard had
grown considerably, and my dress was also changed to that of a
semi-barbarous one. I drew my hat down to my eyes, and spoke in
a changed voice.</p>

<p>"A pleasant day this, my friend."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "No less personage than Nat stepped ashore."]</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," replied the same natural, cracked voice.</p>

<p>"A fine country this, too,"</p>

<p>"Yes, that’s so; didn’t expect to see you."</p>

<p>"And why not, my friend?"</p>

<p>"’Cause ’tain’t often you see a white man in these parts; you’re
the first one I’ve seen."</p>

<p>"And how is it you are here yourself?"</p>

<p>"Wal, stranger, there’s a long story fastened to that question&mdash;a
longer one than I care about spinning at present."</p>

<p>"You are not a prisoner, I hope."</p>

<p>"It was some time last fall I got tuk, and I’ve been with them,
of course, ever since."</p>

<p>"And why have you remained with them so long? It strikes me that
if I had the fine opportunity you have, I should not be long waiting
to bid them farewell."</p>

<p>"You see, when I landed down here, it was winter, and if you’re
any hunter, as I calculate you are, from your dress, you must
know that a fellow from the States would make poor work tramping
a thousand miles at such a time. So I concluded to wait till spring,
and have been thinking about going for the last month or two,
but, somehow or other I haven’t got started; I suppose ’cause
I haven’t had a good start."</p>

<p>"What were you doing on the lake?"</p>

<p>"I came down this morning to fish, and seeing you on t’other
side, took you to be an Injin fishin’ and so I paddled across."</p>

<p>"You are allowed considerable liberty, it seems, after all."</p>

<p>"Well, I have considerable, though it hain’t done me much good
so fur."</p>

<p>"You wish to return to the States, I presume."</p>

<p>"I guess I do; I am about as homesick a dog as you ever laid
eyes on, and there’s a gal home that I want to see amazingly."</p>

<p>At this remark I was compelled to cough several times, to prevent
bursting into a loud, boisterous laugh. I felt like dropping upon
the grass and rolling over and over, and yelling like an Indian.
But I restrained myself, and determined to carry the deception
further.</p>

<p>"She most likely has given you up as dead by this time."</p>

<p>"I’m a little afraid she has, and that’s the reason I want to
go down and tell her her mistake. But I don’t know as it would
be any use, by gracious!" he added, in a desponding tone.</p>

<p>"And why not, pray?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there’s a chap named Bill Hawkins, who thinks he’s mighty
smart, all the time flourishing round there. I’d just like to
lay hands on him once," and Nat clinched his hands and shook his
head menacingly. Then resuming his natural manner, he added, quickly,
and with a sort of desperation, "I don’t care though. If Sal wants
him, she can have him."</p>

<p>"That’s it. Take things philosophically is my motto, when you
are compelled to."</p>

<p>In making this last remark, I unwittingly dropped my voice to
its natural key. Nat started and raised those large, blue innocent
eyes of his, and stared wonderingly at me.</p>

<p>"Did my remark surprise you?" I asked, working harder than I
ever did to restrain my gravity.</p>

<p>"It weren’t what you said, but your voice sounded amazingly like
a person I used to know, and I thought maybe you might be him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am."</p>

<p>"No; you don’t look like him. He was about your size, but didn’t
dress like you, nor didn’t have such whiskers."</p>

<p>"What was his name?"</p>

<p>"William Relmond, from New Jersey."</p>

<p>"William Relmond, from New Jersey," I repeated, as though trying
to recall some half-forgotten remembrance.</p>

<p>"He used to be called ‘Jarsey’ by Bill Biddon," added Nat, quickly,
as if to aid my recollection.</p>

<p>"And do you know Bill Biddon, a trapper?" I demanded, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I am of the opinion that I do, being as I have hunted with him
a long time."</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed. He is an old friend of mine. I saw him some time
since, and he was then in the service of the Hudson Bay Company."</p>

<p>"Didn’t he say anything about ‘Jarsey?’"</p>

<p>"I’ve hit it now! There’s where I heard the name. Yes; he said
a great deal about him, and he also mentioned a person called
Nathan Todd, I think."</p>

<p>"I am the man, sir," responded Nat, with considerable dignity.</p>

<p>"You are! I recall now that he mentioned the fact of your captivity,
although he was more inclined to say you were dead and gone long
since."</p>

<p>"Bill is a pretty ’cute chap, but he’s mistaken there."</p>

<p>"Yes; he seemed to cherish a warm friendship for you."</p>

<p>"You see the way of it was this: Me and Bill Relmond started
from Independence last summer for California. The company we was
with ran away from us, taking my knife and mare with them. So
we started fur Californy on our own hook. We came across this
Bill Biddon and changed our minds, or, rather, Relmond did, and
concluded to go on a hunt up in these parts. Well, we did, and
this is the end of that hunt. We fixed on a place down on the
Yellowstone, and would have spent a good time if it hadn’t been
for that Relmond. He was a good fellow, but betwixt you and me
(you needn’t say nothing about it, you know), he was rather soft,
and I had to keep a clus watch over him to prevent his getting
into danger. There used to come some Injins down the stream in
a canoe, and they set his head crazy. It wasn’t the Injins, though,
but a white gal they had. She was pretty, I allow, but he ought
to have knowed better than to chase her as he did; he might have
knowed what would have come of it. We used to go down and watch
this canoe. One day I went a little lower down the stream than
he did, and hid in some bushes beside the water to take a good
look at the gal and the Injins. Pretty soon they came, and as
they got along by me, by gracious if they didn’t start right into
the bushes after me! I was so fast in the roots and limbs that
I hadn’t time to git out before they got right on to me. I then
up and blazed away to keep them off, but I forgot to take aim,
and didn’t hit them, and the first thing I knowed I didn’t know
anything. One of them smashed his tomahawk square at me, grabbed
me by the neck, whopped me into the canoe, paddled to the other
side, and made me walk all the way here. I haven’t seen Relmond
or Biddon since, and I should like to know what has become of
them."</p>

<p>"Biddon is safe, of course; and Relmond was a captive, I believe,
awhile, but he managed to make his escape some time since."</p>

<p>"How do you know that much, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Simply for the reason that I am William Relmond."</p>

<p>Nathan Todd started as if struck by a thunderbolt. His eyes and
mouth opened, his rifle fell unheeded to his feet, and he stared
all agape at me. His face was such an embodiment of wonder, doubt,
then certainty and pleasure, that I gave way completely to my
feelings, and, seating myself upon the ground rolled over and
laughed one of those laughs which rack our whole being, and make
us as weak as an infant. When I again resumed my feet, my old
friend approached and extended his hand.</p>

<p>"What you laughing at? I knowed it was you all the time."</p>

<p>It is hardly worth time to dwell upon the words which passed
between Nat and myself after my identity became known to him.
Of course he was half frantic with joy in turn, and overwhelmed
me with questions and explanations, and in the course of half
an hour we both came to a full understanding.</p>

<p>I had acquainted Nat with my separation from Imogene, and that
she was waiting for me at "Death Rock." He knew the place well
and without losing time we hastened forward. He had become acquainted
with Imogene, and had often conversed with her about her lost
sister, and of me, little dreaming that she had ever seen me.</p>

<p>Nat proved his knowledge of the country, for his course toward
the Death Rock was direct, and, ere we had traveled many miles
it loomed up to view. It seemed a long while to reach it, but
before dark we were both conversing with Imogene.</p>

<p>The night was spent within the cave, Nat and I conversing around
the fire, while Imogene, wrapped in our blankets, slumbered unconsciously
beside it. Nat succeeded in catching several fine trout from a
small mountain-stream, and when we resumed our journey, I hardly
think three more hopeful people could have been found in the universe.</p>

<p>Our progress was less rapid than usual, as we feared for Imogene,
although her life had been such as to make her the very embodiment
of health and activity. At night we reached a bend of the Yellowstone,
and camped upon its banks. A fire was again kindled, and while
Nat kept watch, I concluded to take a little rest. He allowed
me to sleep heavily until morning, when I was aroused by one of
the most terrific, unearthly shrieks that ever greeted mortal
ear.</p>

<p>"God of heaven! what does that mean?" I exclaimed, springing
to my feet.</p>

<p>"Sounds like the ‘Snorter,’ the engine that I heard on the Boston
road," answered Nat, rubbing his eyes, and listening.</p>

<p>"Hush!" I admonished, as again that hideous scream burst upon
us.</p>

<p>"Wonder if the Pacific Railroad’s built yet?" remarked Nat, with
the utmost <em>nonchalance</em>; "or, maybe, some of their engines
have run away from them."</p>

<p>As I stood wondering and waiting, the gray light of morning commenced
appearing through the forest, and shortly the day dawned. A moment
after, as I was about to awaken Imogene, the awful scream was
repeated, seemingly directly across the river. It was different
from a human voice, but sounded like the cry of a wild animal
in extremity of the direst agony.</p>

<p>As if our terror was still too faint, we now heard the loud ring
of a <em>bell</em>, apparently from the very forest.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Imogene, pale with horror.</p>

<p>"Heaven knows!" I answered.</p>

<p>"Sounds like the old bell up in Lubec," remarked Nat; who, singularly
enough, was the least agitated.</p>

<p>"Listen!" whispered Imogene, raising her hand.</p>

<p>Now was heard a dead sound like the distant heave of the stormy
sea, growing stronger and nearer each second, and at intervals
that wild, unearthly shriek reverberated through the forest arches
with a horrid power.</p>

<p>Matters were now assuming such an inexplicable form I began to
fear I was losing my senses. I looked around upon the faces of
others; but no&mdash;it was all a terrible reality.</p>

<p>"Look!" spoke Imogene, in a husky whisper, pointing down the
river.</p>

<p>I did look and what was seen? There, just rounding the curve
of the Yellowstone below us, burst the broad flaming hull of a
steamboat.</p>

<p>For a moment I could scarce believe my senses. Nat was the first
to recover himself.</p>

<p>"I knowed what it was all the time, by gracious! Hilloa, you!"</p>

<p>The latter exclamation was addressed in vociferous tones to the
steamboat; and, fearing lest he might still escape notice, he
sprang into the water and waved his plumes excitedly over his
head, yelling at the top of his voice all the time. We had been
seen, however, and heeded by those on the boat. A small bell tinkled,
and instantly the huge wheel of the steamer reversed, plowing
the water into foamy waves, and quickly bringing it to a stand
still. The captain then stepped from his wheelhouse and hailed
us:</p>

<p>"What’s wanted?"</p>

<p>"Supper and lodging," answered Nat.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"White men of course."</p>

<p>"White men; I see only one, and you’re an Injin, sure as I’m
Captain Garbold."</p>

<p>I now stepped forward from the shelter of the forest, to which
I had instinctively retreated with the trembling Imogene, upon
the appearance of the boat.</p>

<p>"Ah! who are those?" called the captain, instantly.</p>

<p>"We are whites, as you can readily see, and only ask to be taken
to our friends."</p>

<p>The captain immediately turned and spoke to several beside him.
A few minutes afterward a small boat put out from the steamer,
and Imogene, followed by myself, stepped into the boat, but Nat
lingered.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Hilloa, you!"]</p>

<p>"Come, hurry, Nat, don’t keep them waiting," said I.</p>

<p>"<em>I’m going to remain!</em>" he remarked, quietly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked, in astonishment.</p>

<p>He approached, and whispered in my ear:</p>

<p>"<em>I’m going to hunt up Irene Merment!</em>"</p>

<p>"Why&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don’t say anything," he interrupted, with a smile. "I will do
it. There is no use of trying to persuade me to go with you. My
mind is made up, and has been made up a long time."</p>

<p>Imogene joined her entreaties with mine, but he could not be
made to change his resolution. Not wishing to detain our friends,
I extended my hand.</p>

<p>"If you are determined to remain, I must now bid you good-by,
Nat. Your determination is so new to me that I can hardly realize
it. It is a hopeless search upon which you are going, I fear.
May the One who has so mercifully watched over all of us, still
protect you. If you ever see Biddon, don’t forget me to him. Good-by."</p>

<p>"Nor me either," said Imogene, taking his hand. "I long to see
him, to pour out my heart’s gratitude to him. I hope we shall
see you again."</p>

<p>"Oh! you will, sure. I shall be down in the States one of these
days, and like enough bring a wife with me, and several little
Nat Todds, as good-looking as your heirs will be. You mustn’t
think this is a last farewell, for I know it isn’t."</p>

<p>We exchanged farewells once more, and then were rowed out to
the steamboat. As we were received on board, Nat swung his plume
over his head, and shouted:</p>

<p>"Long life to you! the fust news you will receive from Nat Todd
will be a telegraphic dispatch from the Rocky Mountains, ‘that
he is making a sensation in that neighborhood.’"</p>

<p>Another and a last farewell, and the eccentric being had vanished
in the forest.</p>

<p>Imogene had no suspicion of the true cause of Nat Todd’s erratic
course, and I judged it best to let her remain in ignorance until
Nat should inform her himself. Whether that time was ever to come
or not, no one could tell; but I had strong hope that it would.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, our advent created an infinite amount of
questioning and wonderment for our new-found friends. The boat
was the steamer "Shooting Star," which had been sent to trace
the Yellowstone, as far as it was navigable, by a company in St.
Louis. They proposed opening trade in this section, and knowing
well the prodigious resources of the country watered by its tributaries,
had sent a skillful captain and crew to ascertain its character
and availability. This river had, however, been ascended before.</p>

<p>The "Shooting Star" ascended the Yellowstone several hundred
miles further, until brought to a stand still by the rapids in
its upper part. Several days were spent in running up Clark’s
Fork, the Big Horn, Tongue, Powder, and numerous other streams,
many of which, as yet, have received no names though of considerable
size. All along the banks of these gathered crowds of wondering
Indians, who surveyed us with mingled terror and amazement. On
two occasions, when halting to wood, the crew were attacked by
them, and one of their number was slain. At other points they
manifested a friendly disposition and bartered extensively with
us.</p>

<p>Finally the bow of the boat was turned home, and on a glorious
morning, in the latter part of June, 1850, we glided into the
turbid waters of the mad Missouri, and a few days later "Shooting
Star" sunk to rest at the wharves in St. Louis. Accompanied by
Imogene, I made my way home as rapidly as possible. As may be
supposed, my return was a never-to-be forgotten day to my friends.
The caravan which I had joined at Independence, had been attacked,
a few days subsequent to my separation from it, by an overwhelming
body of Apache Indians. Rumors reached the States that all had
fallen in the massacre, and my reappearance was like the dead
returning to life. The reader, I trust, can imagine the few remaining
incidents. After inducing Imogene to return to the States, I do
not think I should have ever forgiven myself had I not offered
her all the protection within my power. She was like an exotic
at first, taken from a distant clime; but love works wonders.
To-day there are few accomplishments of her sex which she does
not possess. True there was no great romances or mystery yet to
be developed in her history. She had been orphaned when a young
child, in the terrible manner described by the trapper at the
commencement of this tale. I had gained no princess or wealthy
heroine, but simply a <em>wife</em>, in the truest sense of the
word.</p>

<p>The history of Nat Todd’s adventures and journey to the Rocky
Mountains, together with a further account of Bill Biddon, the
Trapper, and of Irene Merment, the lost sister, will be given
the reader in another volume.</p>
