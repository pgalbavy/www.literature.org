<p>When Alice woke next morning the cool upland air was flooding
through the window, and a great dazzle of sunlight made the world
glorious. She dressed and ran out to the lawn, then past the loch
right to the very edge of the waste country. A high fragrance
of heath and bog-myrtle was in the wind, and the mouth grew cool
as after long draughts of spring water. Mists were crowding in
the valleys, each bald mountain top shone like a jewel, and far
aloft in the heavens were the white streamers of morn. Moorhens
were plashing at the loch's edge, and one tall heron rose from
his early meal. The world was astir with life: sounds of the <em>plonk-plonk</em>
of rising trout and the endless twitter of woodland birds mingled
with the far-away barking of dogs and the lowing of the full-uddered
cows in the distant meadows. Abashed and enchanted, the girl listened.
It was an elfin land where the old witch voices of hill and river
were not silenced. With the wind in her hair she climbed the slope
again to the garden ground, where she found a solemn-eyed collie
sniffing the fragrant wind in his morning stroll.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the forenoon hung heavy on her hands. It was
Lady Manorwater's custom to let her guests sit idle in the morning
and follow their own desire, but in the afternoon she would plan
subtle and far-reaching schemes of enjoyment. It was a common
saying that in her large good-nature she amused people regardless
of their own expense. She would light-heartedly make town-bred
folk walk twenty miles or bear the toil of infinite drives. But
this was after lunch; before, her guests might do as they pleased.
Lord Manorwater went off to see some tenant; Arthur, after vain
efforts to decoy Alice into a fishing expedition, went down the
stream in a canoe, because to his fool's head it seemed the riskiest
means of passing the time at his disposal; Bertha and her sister
were writing letters; the spectacled people had settled themselves
below shady trees with voluminous papers and a pile of books.
Alice alone was idle. She made futile expeditions to the library,
and returned with an armful of volumes which she knew in her heart
she would never open. She found the deepest and most comfortable
chair and placed it in a shady place among beeches. But she could
not stay there, and must needs wander restlessly about the gardens,
plucking flowers and listlessly watching the gardeners at their
work.</p>

<p>Lunch-time found this young woman in a slightly irritable frame
of mind. The cause direct and indirect was Mr. Stocks, who had
found her alone, and had saddled her with his company for the
space of an hour and a half. His vein had been <em>badinage</em>
of the serious and reproving kind, and the girl had been bored
to distraction. But a misspent hour is soon forgotten, and the
sight of her hostess's cheery face would have restored her to
good humour had it not been for a thought which could not be exorcised.
She knew of Lady Manorwater's reputation as an inveterate matchmaker,
and in some subtle way the suspicion came to her that that goddess
had marked herself as a quarry. She found herself next Mr. Stocks
at meals, she had already listened to his eulogy from her hostess's
own lips, and to her unquiet fancy it seemed as if the others
stood back that they two might be together. Brought up in an atmosphere
of commerce, she was perfectly aware that she was a desirable
match for an embryo politician, and that sooner or later she would
be mistress of many thousands. The thought was a barbed vexation.
To Mr. Stocks she had been prepared to extend the tolerance of
a happy aloofness; now she found that she was driven to dislike
him with all the bitterness of unwelcome proximity.</p>

<p>The result of such thoughts was that after lunch she disregarded
her hostess's preparations and set out for a long hill walk. Like
all perfectly healthy people, much exercise was as welcome to
her as food and sleep; ten miles were refreshing; fifteen miles
in an afternoon an exaltation. She reached the moor beyond the
policies, and, once past this rushy wilderness, came to the Avelin-side
and a single plank bridge which she crossed lightly without a
tremor. Then came the highway, and then a long planting of firs,
and last of all the dip of a rushing stream pouring down from
the hills in a lonely wooded hollow. The girl loved to explore,
and here was a field ripe for adventure.</p>

<p>Soon she grew flushed with the toil and the excitement; climbing
the bed of the stream was no child's play, for ugly corners had
to be passed, slippery rocks to be skirted, and many breakneck
leaps to be effected. Her spirits rose as the spray from little
falls brushed her face and the thick screen of the birches caught
in her hair. When she reached a vantage-rock and looked down on
the chain of pools and rapids by which she had come, a cry of
delight broke from her lips. This was living, this was the zest
of life! The upland wind cooled her brow; she washed her hands
in a rocky pool and arranged her tangled tresses. What did she
care for Mr. Stocks or any man? He was far down on the lowlands
talking his pompous nonsense; she was on the hills with the sky
above her and the breeze of heaven around her, free, sovereign,
the queen of an airy land.</p>

<p>With fresh wonder she scrambled on till the trees began to grow
sparser and an upland valley opened in view. Now the burn was
quiet, running in long shining shallows and falling over little
rocks into deep brown pools where the trout darted. On either
side rose the gates of the valley&mdash;two craggy knolls each with
a few trees on its face. Beyond was a green lawnlike place with
a great confusion of blue mountains hemmed around its head. Here,
if anywhere, primeval peace had found its dwelling, and Alice,
her eyes bright with pleasure, sat on a green knoll, too rapt
with the sight for word or movement.</p>

<p>Then very slowly, like an epicure lingering at a feast, she walked
up the banks of the burn, now high above a trough of rock, now
down in a green winding hollow. Suddenly she came on the spirits
of the place in the shape of two boys down on their faces groping
among the stones of a pool.</p>

<p>One was very small and tattered, one about sixteen; both were
barefoot and both were wet and excited. "Tam, ye stot, ye've let
the muckle yin aff again," groaned the smaller. "Oh, be canny,
man! If we grip him it'll be the biggest trout that the laird
will have in his basket." The elder boy, who was bearing the heat
and burden of the work, could only groan "Heather!" at intervals.
It seemed to be his one exclamation.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the two ragamuffins lifted their eyes and
saw to their amazement a girl walking on the bank above them,
a girl who smiled comrade-like on them and seemed in no way surprised.
They propped themselves on their elbows and stared. "Heather!"
they ejaculated in one breath. Then they, too, grinned broadly,
for it was impossible to resist so good-humoured an intruder.
She held her head high and walked like a queen, till a turn of
the water hid her. "It's a wumman," gasped the smaller boy. "And
she's terrible bonny," commented the more critical brother. Then
the two fell again to the quest of the great trout.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the girl pursued her way till she came to a fall where
the bank needed warier climbing. As she reached the top a little
flushed and panting, she became conscious that the upland valley
was not without inhabitants. For, not six paces off, stood a man's
figure, his back turned towards her, and his mind apparently set
on mending a piece of tackle.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment hesitating. How could she pass without
being seen? The man was blissfully unconscious of her presence,
and as he worked he whistled Schubert's "Wohin," and whistled
it very badly. Then he fell to apostrophizing his tackle, and
then he grew irritable. "Somebody come and keep this thing taut,"
he cried. "Tam, Jock! where on earth are you?"</p>

<p>The thing in question was lying at Alice's feet in wavy coils.</p>

<p>"Jock, you fool, where are you?" cried the man, but he never
looked round and went on biting and tying. Then an impulse took
the girl and she picked up the line. "That's right," cried the
man, "pull it as tight as you can," and Alice tugged heroically
at the waterproof silk. She felt horribly nervous, and was conscious
that she must look a very flushed and untidy young barbarian.
Many times she wanted to drop it and run away, but the thought
of the menaces against the absent Jock and of her swift discovery
deterred her. When he was done with her help he might go on working
and never look round. Then she would escape unnoticed down the
burn.</p>

<p>But no such luck befell her. With a satisfied tug he pronounced
the thing finished and wheeled round to regard his associates.
"Now, you young wretches&mdash;" and the words froze on his lips, for
in the place of two tatterdemalion boys he saw a young girl holding
his line limply and smiling with much nervousness.</p>

<p>"Oh," he cried, and then became dumb and confused. He was shy
and unhappy with women, save the few whom he had known from childhood.
The girl was no better. She had blushed deeply, and was now minutely
scanning the stones in the burn. Then she raised her eyes, met
his, and the difficulty was solved by both falling into fits of
deep laughter. She was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry I surprised you. I did not see you till I was
close to you, and then you were abusing somebody so terribly that
to stop such language I had to stop and help you. I saw Tam and
Jock at a pool a long way down, so they couldn't hear you, you
know."</p>

<p>"And I'm very much obliged to you. You held it far better than
Tam or Jock would have done. But how did you get up here?"</p>

<p>"I climbed up the burn," said Alice simply, putting up a hand
to confine a wandering tress. The young man saw a small, very
simply dressed girl, with a flushed face and bright, deep eyes.
The small white hat crowned a great tangle of wonderful reddish
gold hair. She held herself with the grace which is born of natural
health and no modish training; the strong hazel stick, the scratched
shoes, and the wet fringes of her gown showed how she had spent
the afternoon. The young man, having received an excellent education,
thought of Dryads and Oreads.</p>

<p>Alice for her part saw a strong, well-knit being, with a brown,
clean-shaven face, a straight nose, and a delicate, humorous mouth.
He had large grey eyes, very keen, quizzical, and kindly. His
raiment was disgraceful&mdash;an old knickerbocker suit with a ruinous
Norfolk jacket, patched at the elbows and with leather at wrist
and shoulder. Apparently he scorned the June sun, for he had no
cap. His pockets seemed bursting with tackle, and a discarded
basket lay on the ground. The whole figure pleased her, its rude
health, simplicity, and disorder. The atrocious men who sometimes
came to her father's house had been miracles of neatness, and
Mr. Stocks was wont to robe his person in the most faultless of
shooting suits.</p>

<p>A fugitive memory began to haunt the girl. She had met or heard
of this man before. The valley was divided between Glenavelin
and Etterick. He was not the Doctor, and he was not the minister.
Might not he be that Lewie, the well-beloved, whose praises she
had heard consistently sung since her arrival? It pleased her
to think that she had been the first to meet the redoubtable young
man.</p>

<p>To them there entered the two boys, the younger dangling a fish.
"It is the big trout ye lost," he cried. "We guddled 'um. We wad
has gotten 'um afore, but a wumman frichted 'um." Then turning
unabashed to Alice, he said in accusing tones, "That's the wumman!"</p>

<p>The elder boy gently but firmly performed on his brother the
operation known as "scragging." It was a subdued spirit which
emerged from the fraternal embrace.</p>

<p>"Pit the fush in the basket, Tam," said he, "and syne gang away
wide up the hill till I cry ye back." The tones implied that his
younger brother was no fit company for two gentlemen and a lady.</p>

<p>"I won't spoil your fishing," said Alice, fearing fratricidal
strife. "You are fishing up, so I had better go down the burn
again." And with a dignified nod to the others she turned to go.</p>

<p>Jock sprang forward with a bound and proceeded to stone the small
Tam up the hill. He coursed that young gentleman like a dog, bidding
him "come near," or "gang wide," or "lie down there," to all of
which the culprit, taking the sport in proper spirit, gaily responded.</p>

<p>"I think you had better not go down the burn," said the man reflectively.
"You should keep the dry hillside. It is safer."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not afraid," said the girl, laughing.</p>

<p>"But then I might want to fish down, and the trout are very shy
there," said he, lying generously.</p>

<p>"Well, I won't then, but please tell me where Glenavelin is,
for the stream-side is my only direction."</p>

<p>"You are staying there?" he asked with a pleased face. "We shall
meet again, for I shall be over to-morrow. That fence on the hillside
is their march, and if you follow it you will come to the footbridge
on the Avelin. Many thanks for taking Jock's place and helping
me."</p>

<p>He watched her for a second as she lightly jumped the burn and
climbed the peaty slope. Then he turned to his fishing, and when
Alice looked back from the vantage-ground of the hill shoulder
she saw a figure bending intently below a great pool. She was
no coquette, but she could not repress a tinge of irritation at
so callous and self-absorbed a young man. Another would have been
profuse in thanks and would have accompanied her to point out
the road, or in some way or other would have declared his appreciation
of her presence. He might have told her his name, and then there
would have been a pleasant informal introduction, and they could
have talked freely. If he came to Glenavelin to-morrow, she would
have liked to appear as already an acquaintance of so popular
a guest.</p>

<p>But such thoughts did not long hold their place. She was an honest
young woman, and she readily confessed that fluent manners and
the air of the <em>cavaliere servente</em> were things she did
not love. Carelessness suited well with a frayed jacket and the
companionship of a hill burn and two ragged boys. So, comforting
her pride with proverbs, she returned to Glenavelin to find the
place deserted save for dogs, and in their cheering presence read
idly till dinner.</p>
