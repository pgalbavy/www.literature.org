<p>Baron Barrat was suspicious by education--his experience of life and
his own conduct had tended to render him so; and accordingly when,
three hours after he had seen Gordon apparently commit the French
officer to jail, he found them leaving a cafe in the most friendly and
amicable spirit, he wasted no time in investigation, but hurried at
once to warn the King.
</p>
<p>"What we feared would happen, has happened," he said.  "The Frenchman
has told Gordon that Zara and Kalonay sold the secret of the
expedition, and Gordon will be coming here to warn you of it.  Now,
what are you going to do?  We must act quickly."
</p><p>"I shall refuse to believe the Frenchman, of course," said the King.
"I shall ask Zara in his presence to answer his charges, and she will
tell him he lies.  That is all there will be of it.  What does it
matter what he says?  We sail at midnight.  We can keep him quiet until
then."
</p><p>"If he is troublesome I can call for help from this room, and the
servants of the hotel and the guards will rush in and find us
struggling together.  We will charge him with an attempt at
assassination, and this time he surely will go to jail.  By to-morrow
morning we shall be many miles at sea."
</p><p>"But he can cable to Messina, by way of Gibraltar, and head us off,"
objected Barrat.
</p><p>"What can he cable?" demanded the King.  "Nothing the people of the
Republic do not already know.  It is our friends here that must not
find us out.  That is the main thing.  Thank Heaven!" he exclaimed,
"Kalonay and Paul are out of the way, and those crazy boys from Paris.
We will settle it here among ourselves in five minutes."
</p><p>"And the American?" asked Zara.  "He knows, he will come with him.
Suppose he believes, suppose he believes that Kalonay and I have sold
you out, but suspects that you know it?"
</p><p>"The American can go to the devil," said the King.  "Confound him and
his insolence.  I'll have him in the prison too, if he interferes.  Or
Erhaupt can pick a quarrel with him here and fight it out behind the
sand-hills before the others get back from their picnic.  He has done
as much for me before."
</p><p>Zara stood up.  She was trembling slightly, and she glanced fearfully
from Erhaupt to the King.
</p><p>"You will not do that," she said.
</p><p>"And why not, madame?" demanded Louis.
</p><p>"Because it will be murder," Zara whispered.  "He will murder him as he
did that boy in the Park at Pesth."
</p><p>"What does the woman mean?" growled the German.  "Is she mad?  Send her
to her room, Louis."
</p><p>"You know what I mean," Zara answered, her voice rising, in her
excitement.  "You fired before they gave the word.  I know you did.
Oh, Louis," she cried, "you never warned me it might come to this.  I
am afraid.  I am afraid to meet that man----"
</p><p>She gave a sudden cry.  "And Kalonay!"  She held out her hands
appealingly.  "Indeed," she cried, "do not let Kalonay question me."
</p><p>"Silence!" commanded the King.  "You are acting like a fool." He
advanced toward her, and clasped her wrist firmly in his hand.  "No
nerves, now," he said.  "I'll not have it.  You shall meet Kalonay, and
you shall swear that he is in the plot against me.  If you fail us now,
we are ruined.  As it is, we are sure to lose the bribe from the
Republic, but we may still get Miss Carson's money if you play your
part.  It is your word and the word of the Frenchman against Kalonay's.
And we have the paper signed by you for Kalonay as evidence.  Have you
got it with you?"
</p><p>Zara bowed her head.  "It is always with me," she answered.
</p><p>"Good," said the King.  "It will be a difficult chance, but if you
stand to your story, and we pretend to believe you, the others may
believe you, too."
</p><p>"But I cannot," Zara cried.  "I know I cannot.  I tell you if you put
me face to face with Kalonay, I shall fail you.  I shall break down.
They will see that I am lying.  Send me away.  Send me away before they
come.  Tell them I saw the Frenchman, and suspected I had been found
out, and that I have gone away.  Tell them you don't know where I am."
</p><p>"I believe she's right," Erhaupt said.  "She will do us more harm than
good.  Let her go to her room and wait there."
</p><p>"She will remain where she is," said the King, sternly.  "And she will
keep her courage and her wits about her, or----"
</p><p>He was interrupted by an exclamation from Barrat.  "Whatever you mean
to do, you must do it at once," he said, grimly.  He was standing at
the window which overlooked the beach.  "Here they come now," he
continued.  "The American has taken no chances, he is bringing an
audience with him."
</p><p>The King and Erhaupt ran to the window, and peered over Barrat's
shoulder.
</p><p>Advancing toward them along the beach, some on foot, and some on
horseback, were all the members of the expedition, those who had been
of the riding-party and those who had remained in Tangier.  Gordon and
the Frenchman Renauld were far in the lead, walking by themselves and
speaking earnestly together; Father Paul was walking with Mrs. Carson
and her daughter, and Kalonay was riding with two of the volunteers,
the Count de Rouen and Prince Henri of Poitiers.
</p><p>When the King and Erhaupt turned from the window the Countess Zara had
disappeared.  "It is better so," said Erhaupt; "she was so badly
frightened she would have told the truth."
</p><p>The King stood leaning on the back of a large arm-chair.  "Well, the
moment has come, it is our last chance," he said.  "Send for the Crown
Prince, Baron.  I shall be discovered in the act of taking a tender
farewell of my son."
</p><p>Barrat made an eager gesture of dissent.
</p><p>"I would not do that," he cried.  "If we are to make charges against
the jackal do not have the boy present; the boy must not hear them.
You know how Kalonay worships the child, and it would enrage him more
to be exposed before the Prince than before all the rest of the world.
He will be hard enough to handle without that.  Don't try him too far."
</p><p>"You are absurd, Barrat," exclaimed the King.  "The boy won't
understand what is said."
</p><p>"No, but the Jackal will," Barrat returned.  "You don't understand him,
Louis, he is like a woman; he has sentiment and feelings, and when we
all turn on him he will act like a madman.  Keep the boy out of his
sight, I tell you.  It's the only thing he cares for in the world.  He
has been a better father to him than you ever have been."
</p><p>"That was quite natural; that was because it was his duty," said the
King, calmly.  "A Kalonay has always been the protector and tutor of
the heir-apparent.  If this one chooses to give his heart with his
service, that is not my concern.  Why, confound them, they all think
more of the child than they do of me.  That is why I need him by me
now."
</p><p>Barrat shook his head.  "I tell you it will make trouble," he
persisted.  "Kalonay will not stand it. He and the child are more like
comrades than a tutor and his pupil.  Why, Kalonay would rather sit
with the boy in the Champs-Elysees and point out the people as they go
by than drive at the side of the prettiest woman in Paris.  He always
treats him as though he saw the invisible crown upon his head; he will
throw over any of us to stay in the nursery and play tin soldiers with
him.  And when he was ill--" Barrat nodded his head significantly.
"You remember."
</p><p>"That will do," said the King.  "We have no time to consider the finer
feelings of the jackal; he is to be sacrificed, and that is all there
is of it.  The presence of the child may make him more unmanageable,
but it will certainly make it easier for me.  So go, bring the boy here
as I bid you."
</p><p>Barrat left the room and returned immediately, followed by the Crown
Prince and his nurse.  The Prince was a dark, handsome little fellow of
four years.  His mother had died when he was born, and he had never
played with children of his own age, and his face was absurdly wise and
wistful; but it lighted with a sweet and grateful smile when anyone
showed him kindness or sought to arouse his interest.  To the Crown
Prince Kalonay was an awful and wonderful being.  He was the one person
who could make him laugh out of pure happiness and for no reason, as a
child should laugh.  And people who had seen them together asked which
of the princes was the older of the two.  When the child entered the
room, clinging to Barrat's finger, he carried in his other hand a
wooden spade and bucket, still damp with sand, and he was dressed in a
shabby blue sailor suit which left his little legs bare, and exposed
the scratches and bruises of many falls.  A few moments later, when the
conspirators entered the King's salon, preceded by Erhaupt, they found
the boy standing by his father's knee.  The King had his hand upon the
child's head, and had been interrupted apparently in a discourse on the
dignity of kingship, for the royal crown of Messina had been brought
out and stood beside him on the table, and his other hand rested on it
reverently.  It was an effective tableau, and the visitors observed it
with varying emotions, but with silence.
</p><p>The King rose, taking his son's hand in his, and bowed, looking
inquiringly from Barrat to the Prince Kalonay.
</p><p>"To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?" he asked.  "Was it
discreet of you to come together in this way?  But you are most
welcome.  Place chairs for the ladies, Barrat."
</p><p>Kalonay glanced at the others, and they nodded to him as though to make
him their spokesman.  He pointed at Gordon with his cap.
</p><p>"We are here on the invitation of this gentleman, your Majesty," he
said.  "He took it upon himself to send after those of us who had gone
into the country, and came in person for the others who remained in
town.  He tells us he has news of the greatest importance to
communicate, which he cannot disclose except to you, and in the
presence of all of those who are to take part in the expedition.  We
decided to accompany him here, as he asked us, and to leave it to your
Majesty to say whether or not you wished us to remain." Kalonay smiled
in apology at the King, and the King answered him with a smile.
</p><p>"The procedure is perhaps unconventional," the King said, "but in
America they move quickly.  No doubt our young companion has acted as
he thought was for the best.  If he has taken a liberty, the nature of
his news will probably excuse him.  Perhaps, Mr. Gordon," he added,
turning to the American, "you had better first tell me what this
discovery is, and I will decide whether it is best to discuss it in
open council."
</p><p>Gordon did not appear to be the least disturbed by the criticism
Kalonay and the King had passed upon his conduct.  He only smiled
pleasantly when the King had finished speaking, and showed no
inclination to accept a private audience.
</p><p>"What I have to say, your Majesty," he began, "is this.  I have learned
that all the secrets of your expedition have been sold to the Republic
of Messina.  One of those now present in this room is charged with
having sold them.  Shall I go on," he asked, "or do you still think it
advisable for anyone to leave the room?"
</p><p>He paused and glanced from the King to the double row of conspirators,
who were standing together in a close semicircle facing the King and
himself.  The instant he ceased speaking there rose from their ranks an
outburst of consternation, of anger, and of indignant denial.  The
King's spirits rose within him at the sound, although he frowned and
made a gesture as though to command silence.
</p><p>"Mr. Gordon, this is a serious charge you make," he said, smiling
grimly.  "One that may cost you a great deal--it might cost you your
life perhaps."  He paused significantly, and there was a second
outburst, this time from the younger men, which came so suddenly that
it was as though Louis had played upon certain chords on a keyboard,
and the sounds he wanted had answered to his touch.
</p><p>"Pardon me, that is not the question," said Gordon.  "That I make
charges or run risks in making charges is not important.  That your
expedition has failed before it has even started is, however, of great
importance, at least so it sees to me."
</p><p>There was a movement in the circle, and Father Paul pushed his way
forward from his place beside Miss Carson's chair.  He was so greatly
moved that when he spoke his voice was harsh and broken.  "What is your
authority for saying we have failed?" he demanded.
</p><p>Gordon bowed gravely and turned and pointed to the Frenchman.  "This
gentleman," he said, "is General Renauld, Commander-in-Chief of the
army of Messina.  He is my authority.  He knows all that you mean to
do.  If he knows it, it is likely, is it not, that his army and the
President of the Republic know it also, and that when we attempt to
land they will be waiting for us."
</p><p>The King silenced the second outburst that followed this by rising and
holding up his hand.
</p><p>"Silence!  I believe I can explain," he said.  He was smiling, and his
bearing was easy and so full of assurance that the exclamations and
whispers died away on the instant.  "I am afraid I see what has
happened," the King said.  "But there need be no cause for alarm.  This
gentleman is, as Mr. Gordon says, the Commander-in-Chief of the
Messinian army, and it is true he suspected that an armed force would
invade the island.  It is not strange that he should have suspected it,
and it needed no traitor to enlighten him.  The visit of Father Paul
and the Prince Kalonay in the yacht, and their speeches inciting the
people to rebellion, would have warned the government that an
expedition might soon follow.  The return of our yacht to this place
has no doubt been made known in Messina through the public press, and
General Renauld followed the yacht here to learn what he could of our
plans--of our intended movements.  He came here to spy on us, and as a
spy I ordered Mr. Gordon to arrest him this morning on any charge he
pleased, and to place him out of our way until after to-night, when we
should have sailed.  I chose Mr. Gordon to undertake this service
because he happened to speak the language of the country, and it was
necessary to deal directly with the local authorities without the
intervention of an outsider.  What has happened is only too evident.
The spy, who when he came here only suspected, now, as Mr. Gordon says,
knows the truth, and he could have learned it only from one person, to
whom he has no doubt paid a pretty price for the information."  The
King took a step forward and pointed with his hand at the American.  "I
gave that man into your keeping, sir," he cried, "but I had you
watched.  Instead of placing him in jail you took him to a cafe and
remained there with him for three hours, and from that cafe you came
directly here to this room.  If he knows the truth, he learned it in
that cafe, and he learned it from you!"  There was a ring of such
earnestness and sincerity in the King's speech, and he delivered it
with such indignation and bitter contempt that a shout of relief, of
approbation and conviction, went up from his hearers, and fell as
quickly on the words as the applause of an audience drowns out the last
note of a great burst of song.  Barrat, in the excess of his relief,
turned his back sharply on the King, glancing sideways at Erhaupt and
shaking his head in speechless admiration.
</p><p>"He is wonderful, simply wonderful," Erhaupt muttered; "he would have
made a great actor or a great diplomat."
</p><p>"He is wasted as a King," whispered Barrat.
</p><p>There was a menacing movement on the part of the younger men toward
Gordon and General Renauld, which the King noted, but which he made no
effort to check.  Neither Gordon nor General Renauld gave any sign that
they observed it. The American was busily engaged in searching his
pockets, and from one of these he produced two pieces of paper, which
he held up above his head, so that those in the room might see them.
</p><p>"One moment, please," he began, and then waited until the tumult in the
room had ceased.  "Again, I must point out to you," he said, in brisk,
business-like tones, "that we are digressing.  The important thing is
not who did, or did not, sell out the expedition, but that it is in
danger of failing altogether.  What his Majesty says is in part
correct.  I did not take this gentleman to jail; I did take him to a
cafe, and there he told me much more concerning the expedition than I
had learned from those directly interested.  His information, he told
me, had been sold to the Republic by one who visited the island and who
claimed to act for one other.  I appreciated the importance of what he
said, and I also guessed that my word and his unsupported might be
doubted, as you have just doubted it.  So I took the liberty of
verifying what General Renauld told me by cabling to the President of
Messina."
</p><p>There was a shout of consternation at these words, but Gordon's manner
was so confident and the audacity of his admission so surprised his
hearers that they were silent again immediately, and waited, with
breathless interest, while Gordon unfolded one of the pieces of paper.
</p><p>"This is a copy of the cablegram I sent the President," he said, "and
to which, with his permission, I signed General Renauld's name.  It is
as follows:--
</p>
<p>The President.  The Palace, Messina.--They will not believe you are
fully informed.  Cable at once the exact hour when they will leave
Tangier, at what hour they expect to land, at what place they expect to
land, what sum you have promised to pay for this information, and the
names of those to whom it is to be paid.
</p><p><strong>RENAULD.</strong>
</p>
<p>Gordon lowered the paper.  "Is that quite clear?" he asked.  "Do you
follow me? I have invited the enemy himself to inform you of your
plans, and to tell you who has betrayed them.  His answer, which was
received a half hour ago, removes all suspicion from any save those he
names.  General Renauld and myself cease to be of the least consequence
in the matter; we are only messengers.  It is the President of Messina
who will speak to you now.  If you still doubt that the secret of your
expedition is known to the President you will have to doubt him."
</p><p>The King sprang quickly to his feet and struck the arm of his chair
sharply with his open hand.
</p><p>"I shall not permit that message to be read," he said.  "If we have a
traitor here, he is a traitor against me.  And I shall deal with him as
I see fit, in private."
</p><p>There was a murmur of disappointment and of disapproval even, and the
King again struck the arm of his chair for silence.  Kalonay advanced
toward him, shaking his head and holding out his hands in protest.
</p><p>"Your Majesty, I beseech you," he began.  "This concerns us all," he
cried.  "It is too evident that we have been betrayed; but it is not
fair to any of us that we should all lie under suspicion, as we must
unless it is told who has been guilty of this infamy.  I beg your
Majesty to reconsider.  There is no one in this room who is not in our
secret, and whoever has betrayed us must be with us here and now.  I,
who have an interest second only to your own, ask that that cablegram
be read."
</p><p>There was a murmur of approbation from the conspirators, and
exclamations of approval and entreaty.  Miss Carson, in her excitement,
had risen to her feet and was standing holding her mother's hand.  The
King glanced uncertainly at Kalonay, and then turned to Barrat and
Erhaupt as if in doubt.
</p><p>Gordon's eyes were fixed for a moment on Kalonay with a strange and
puzzled expression.  Then he gave a short sigh of relief, and turning
quickly searched the faces of those around him.  What he saw seemed to
confirm him in his purpose, for he folded the paper and placed it in
his pocket.  "His Majesty is right," he said.  "I shall not read this."
</p><p>Kalonay and Father Paul turned upon him angrily.  "You have no choice
in the matter, sir," Kalonay cried.  "It has passed entirely out of
your hands."
</p><p>"I beg your Majesty that the cablegram be read," the priest demanded,
in a voice that held less the tone of a request than of a command.
</p><p>"I shall not read it," persisted Gordon, "because the person chiefly
concerned is not present."
</p>
<p>"That is all the more reason for reading it," said Kalonay.  "Your
Majesty must reconsider."
</p><p>The King whispered to Barrat, and the others waited in silence that
expressed their interest more clearly than a chorus of questions would
have done.
</p><p>"It shall be as you ask," the King said, at last.  "You may read the
message, Mr. Gordon."
</p><p>Gordon opened the paper and looked at it for some seconds of time with
a grave and perplexed expression, and then, with a short breath, as one
who takes a plunge, read it aloud.  "This is it," he said.
</p>
<p>To General Renauld.  Cable Office, Tangier.--They leave Tangier Tuesday
at midnight, they land at daybreak Thursday morning on the south beach
below the old breakwater.  The secret of the expedition was sold us for
three hundred thousand francs by the Countess Zara and the Prince
Kalonay.
</p>
<p>Gordon stuck the paper in his pocket, and, crossing to Kalonay, held
out his hand, with a smile.  "I don't believe it, of course," he said;
"but you would have it."
</p><p>Kalonay neither saw the gesture nor heard the words.  He was turning in
bewilderment from the King to Father Paul, and he laughed uncertainly.
</p><p>"What nonsense is this?" he demanded.  "Whose sorry trick is this?  The
lie is not even ingenious."
</p><p>General Renauld had not spoken since he had entered the room, but now
he advanced in front of Kalonay and faced him with a threatening
gesture.
</p><p>"The President of Messina does not lie, sir," he said, sternly.  "I
myself saw the Countess Zara write out that paper, which I and others
signed, and in which we agreed to pay to her and to you the money you
asked for betraying your King."
</p><p>Father Paul pressed his hand heavily on Kalonay's shoulder.  "Do not
answer him," he commanded.  Gordon had moved to Kalonay's other side,
and the three men had unconsciously assumed an attitude of defence, and
stood back to back in a little group facing the angry circle that
encompassed them.  The priest raised his arm to command a hearing.
</p><p>"Where is Madame Zara?" he cried.
</p><p>"Ah, where indeed?" echoed the King, sinking back into his chair.  "She
has fled.  It is all too evident now; she has betrayed us and she has
fled."
</p><p>But on his words, as if in answer to the priest's summons, the curtains
that hid the door into the King's private room were pulled to one side,
and Madame Zara appeared between them, glancing fearfully at the
excited crowd before her.  As she stood hesitating on the threshold,
she swayed slightly and clutched the curtains for a moment as though
for support.  The priest advanced, and led her to the centre of the
room.  She held a folded paper in her hand, which she gave to him in
silence.
</p><p>"You have heard what has passed?" he asked, with a toss of his head
toward the heavy curtains.  The woman raised her head and bowed.  The
priest unfolded the paper.
</p><p>"Am I to read this?" he asked.  The woman bowed again.
</p><p>There was silence in the room while the priest's eyes ran quickly over
the paper.  He crushed it in his hand.
</p><p>"It is as General Renauld says," he exclaimed.  "In this the Republic
of Messina agrees to pay the Countess Zara and the Prince Kalonay three
hundred thousand francs, if the expedition is withdrawn after it has
made a pretence of landing on the shores of Messina."
</p><p>He took a step forward.  "Madame Zara," he cried, in a tone of warning,
"do you pretend that the Prince Kalonay was your accomplice in this;
that he knew what you meant to do?"
</p><p>Madame Zara once more bowed her head.
</p><p>"No! You must speak," commanded the priest.  "Answer me!"
</p><p>Zara hesitated, in evident distress, and glanced appealingly at the
King; but the expression on his face was one of grief and of
unrelenting virtue.  "I do," she said, at last, in a low voice.
"Kalonay did know.  He thought the revolution would not succeed; he
thought it would fail, and so--and so--and we needed money.  They made
me--I, O my God, I cannot--I cannot!" she cried, suddenly, sinking on
her knees and hiding her face with her hands.
</p><p>Kalonay stepped toward her and lifted her gently to her feet; but when
she looked and saw who it was that held her, she gave a cry and pulled
herself free.  She staggered and would have fallen, had not Gordon
caught and held her by the arm.  The King rose from his chair and
pointed at the shrinking figure of the woman.
</p><p>"Stand aside from her," he said, sternly.  "Why should we pity her,
what pity has she shown for us--for me?  She has robbed me of my
inheritance.  But let her go, she is a woman; we cannot punish her.
Her sins rest on her own head.  But you--you," he cried, turning
fiercely on Kalonay, his voice rising to a high and melancholy key,
"you whom I have heaped with honors, whom I have leaned upon as on the
arm of a brother, that you should have sold me for silver, that you
should have turned Judas!"
</p><p>The crowd of volunteers, bewildered by the rapid succession of events,
and confused and rendered desperate by the failure of their expedition,
caught up the word, and pressing forward with a rush, surrounded
Kalonay in an angry circle, crying "Judas!" "Traitor!" and "Coward!"
</p><p>Kalonay turned from side to side.  On some he smiled bitterly in
silence, and at others he broke out into swift and fierce
denunciations; but the men around him crowded closer and would not
permit him to be heard.  He had turned upon them, again challenging
them to listen, when there was an opening in the circle and the men
stepped back, and Miss Carson pushed her way among them and halted at
Kalonay's side.  She did not look at him, but at the men about him.
She was the only calm figure in the group, and her calmness at such a
crisis, and her youth, and the fineness and fearlessness of her beauty,
surprised them into a sudden quiet.  There was instantly a cry for
order, and the men stood curious and puzzled, watching to see what she
would do.
</p><p>"Gentlemen," she said, in a clear, grave voice.  "Gentlemen," she
repeated, sharply, as a few murmurs still greeted her, "if you are
gentlemen, let this lady speak.  She has not finished."  She crossed
quickly and took the Countess Zara by the hand.  "Go on, madame," she
urged, gently.  "Do not be afraid.  You say they made you do it.  Who
made you do it?  You have told us a part of the truth.  Now tell us the
whole truth."  For a moment the girl seemed much the older of the two,
and as Zara glanced up at her fearfully, she smiled to reassure her,
and stroked the woman's hand with her own.  "Who made you do it?" she
repeated.  "Not the Prince Kalonay, surely.  You cannot hope to make us
believe that.  We trust him absolutely.  Who was it, then?"
</p><p>The King sprang forward with an oath; his apathy and mock dignity had
fallen from him like a mask.  His face was mottled, and his vicious
little eyes flashed with fear and anger.  Erhaupt crowded close behind
him, crouching like a dog at his heels.
</p><p>"She has lied enough already," the King cried.  "We will not listen to
her.  Take her away."
</p><p>"Yes, let her go," shouted Erhaupt, with a laugh.  "If she had been a
decent woman----"
</p><p>There was a quick parting in the group and the sound of a heavy blow as
Kalonay flung himself upon Erhaupt and struck him in the face, so that
he staggered and fell at length upon the floor.  Gordon stood over him,
his fingers twitching at his side.
</p><p>"Stand up, you bully," he said, "and get out of this, before we throw
you out."
</p><p>Zara's face had turned a pitiful crimson, but her eyes flashed and
burned with resolve and indignation.  She stood erect and menacing,
like an angry goddess, and more beautiful in her indignation than they
had ever seen her.
</p><p>"Now, I shall tell them the truth," she said, sternly.  "That man," she
cried, pointing her finger at the King, "that man whom they call a
King--that man who would have sacrificed the only friend who serves him
unselfishly--is the man who sold your secret to the enemy.  It was he
who made me do it.  He sent me to Messina, and while the priest and the
Prince Kalonay were working in the south, I sold them to the government
at the capital.  Barrat knew it, Erhaupt knew it, the King himself
planned it--to get money.  He has robbed all of his own people; he had
meant to rob this young girl; and he is so mean and pitiful a creature
that to save himself he now tries to hide behind the skirts of a woman,
and to sacrifice her,--the woman who has given her soul to him.  And
for this--my God!" she cried, her voice rising in an accent of agony
and bitter contempt--"for this!"
</p><p>There was a grim and momentous silence in the room while Zara turned,
and without waiting to learn what effect her words might have, made her
way swiftly through the crowd and passed on out of the room and on to
the terrace beyond.
</p><p>The King crouched back in his chair like a common criminal in the dock,
glancing fearfully from under his lowered eyebrows at the faces about
him, and on none did he see the least question of doubt but that Zara
had at last spoken the truth.
</p><p>"She lies," the King muttered, as though answering their unspoken
thoughts, "the woman lies."
</p><p>There was no movement from the men about him.  Shame for him, and grief
and bitter disappointment for themselves, showed on the face of each.
From outside a sea-breeze caught up the sand of the beach and drove it
whispering against the high windows, and the beat of the waves upon the
shores filled out and marked the silence of the room.
</p><p>The Prince Kalonay stepped from the circle and stood for a moment
before the King, regarding him with an expression of grief and bitter
irony.  The King's eyes rose insolently, and faltered, and sank.
</p><p>"For many years, your Majesty," the Prince said, but so solemnly that
it was as though he were a judge upon the bench, or a priest speaking
across an open grave, "the Princes of my house have served the Kings of
yours.  In times of war they fought for the King in battle, they
beggared themselves for him in times of peace; our women sold their
jewels for the King, our men gave him their lives, and in all of these
centuries the story of their loyalty, of their devotion, has had but
one sequel, and has met with but one reward,--ingratitude and
selfishness and treachery.  You know how I have served you, Louis.  You
know that I gave up my fortune and my home to go into exile with you,
and I did that gladly.  But I did more than that.  I did more than any
king or any man has the right to expect of any other man.  I served
your idle purposes so well that you, yourself, called me your jackal,
the only title your Majesty has ever bestowed that was deserved.  There
is no low thing nor no base thing that I have not done for you.  To
serve your pleasures, to gain you money, I have sunken so low that all
the royal blood in Europe could not make me clean.  But there is a
limit to what a man may do for his King, and to the loyalty a King may
have the right to demand.  And to-day and here, with me, the story of
our devotion to your House ends, and you go your way and I go mine, and
the last of my race breaks his sword and throws it at your feet, and is
done with you and yours forever."
</p><p>Even those in the room who held no sympathy in their hearts for the
sentiment that had inspired the young man, felt that at that moment and
in their hearing he had renounced what was to him his religion and his
faith, and on the faces of all was the expression of a deep pity and
concern.  Their own adventure, in the light of his grief and bitterness
of spirit, seemed selfish and little, and they stood motionless, in an
awed and sorrowful silence.
</p><p>The tense strain of the moment was broken suddenly by the advent on the
scene of an actor who had, in the rush of events, been neglected and
forgotten.  The little Crown Prince had stood clinging to his nurse's
skirts, an uncomprehending spectator of what was going forward.  But he
now advanced slowly, feeling that the silence invited him to claim his
father's notice.  He halted beside the chair in which Louis sat, his
head bent on his hands, and made an effort to draw himself up to his
father's knee.
</p><p>But the King pushed him down, and hid his face from him.  The child
turned irresolutely, with a troubled countenance, and, looking up, saw
that the attention of all was fixed upon him.  At this discovery a
sudden flood of shyness overtook him, and he retreated hastily until
his eyes fell on the Prince Kalonay, standing alone, with his own eyes
turned resolutely away.  There was a breathless hush in the room as the
child, with a happy sigh, ran to his former friend and comrade, and
reached up both his arms.  The tableau was a familiar one to those who
knew them, and meant only that the child asked to be lifted up and
swung to the man's shoulder; but following as it did on what had just
passed, the gesture and the attitude carried with them the significance
of an appeal.  Kalonay, as though with a great effort, lowered his eyes
to the upturned face of the child below him, but held himself back and
stood stiffly erect.  A sharp shake of the head, as though he argued
with himself, was the only sign he gave of the struggle that was going
on within him.
</p><p>At this second repulse, the child's arms dropped to his side, his lips
quivered, and he stood, a lonely little figure, glancing up at the
circle of men about him, and struggling to press back the tears that
came creeping to his eyes.
</p><p>Kalonay regarded him steadfastly for a brief moment, as though he saw
him as a stranger, searching his face with eyes as pitiful as the
child's own; and then, with a sudden, sharp cry, the Prince dropped on
his knee and caught the child toward him, crushing him against his
heart, and burying his face on his shoulder.  There was a shout of
exultation from the nobles, and an uttered prayer from the priest, and
in a moment the young men had crowded in around them, struggling to be
the first to kiss the child's hands, and to ask pardon of the man who
held him in his arms.
</p><p>"Gentlemen," Kalonay cried, his voice laughing through his tears, "we
shall still sail for the island of Messina.  They shall not say of us
that we visited the sins of the father on a child.  I was weak, my
friends, and I was credulous.  I thought I could break the tradition of
centuries.  But our instincts are stronger than our pride, and the
House I have always served I shall serve to the last."  He swung the
Crown Prince high upon his shoulder, and held his other arm above his
head.  "You will help me place this child upon his throne," he
commanded, and the room rang with cheers.  "You will appeal to his
people," he cried.  "Do you not think they will rise to this
standard-bearer, will they not rally to his call?  For he is a true
Prince, my comrades, who comes to them with no stain of wrong or
treachery, without a taint, as untarnished as the white snow that lies
summer and winter in the hollow of our hills, `and a child shall lead
us, and a child shall set them free.'  To the yacht!" he shouted.  "We
will sail at once, and while they wait for us to be betrayed into their
hands at the north, we shall be landing in the south, and thousands
will be hurrying to our standard."
</p><p>His last words were lost in a tumult of cheers and cries, and the young
men poured out upon the terrace, running toward the shore, and filling
the soft night-air with shouts of "Long live the Prince Regent!"  "Long
live our King!"
</p><p>As the room grew empty Kalonay crossed it swiftly and advancing to Miss
Carson took her hand.  His face was radiant with triumph and content.
He regarded her steadily for a moment, as though he could not find
words to tell his feelings.
</p><p>"You had faith in me," he said, at last.  "Can I ever make you
understand how much that means to me?  When all had turned against me
you trusted me, you had faith in me, in the King's jackal."
</p><p>"Silence; you must never say that again," the girl commanded, gently.
"You have shown it to be the lie it always was.  We shall call you the
Defender of the Faith now; you are the guardian of a King."  She smiled
at the little boy in his arms, and made a slight courtesy to them both.
"You have outgrown your old title," she said; "you have a proud one
now, you will be the Prince Regent."
</p><p>Kalonay, with the child in his arms, and Miss Carson were standing
quite alone.  General Renauld had been led away, guarded by a merry
band of youngsters; the King still crouched in his chair, with Barrat
bowed behind him, but pulling, with philosophic calm, on a cigarette,
and Father Paul and Gordon were in close conversation with Mrs. Carson
at the farther end of the room.  The sun had set, and the apartment was
in semi-darkness.  Kalonay moved closer to Miss Carson and looked
boldly into her eyes, "There is a prouder title than that of the
Regent," he whispered; "will you ever give it me?"
</p><p>The girl started, breathing quickly, and turned her head aside, making
an effort to free her hand, but Kalonay held it closer in his own.
"Will you give it me?" he begged.
</p><p>Then the girl looked up at him smiling, but with such confidence and
love in her eyes that he read his answer, though she shook her head, as
though to belie the truth her eyes had told him.
</p><p>"When you have done your work," she said, "come to me or send for me,
and I shall come and give you my answer; and whether you fail or
succeed the answer will be the same."
</p><p>Kalonay stooped quickly and kissed her hand, and when he raised his
face his eyes were smiling with such happiness that the little child in
his arms read it there, and smiled too in sympathy, and pressed his
face closer against his comrade's shoulder.
</p><p>Gordon at this moment moved across the room and bowed, making a deep
obeisance to the child.
</p><p>"Might I be permitted," he asked, "to kiss his Royal Highness?  I
should like to boast of the fact, later," he explained.
</p><p>The Crown Prince turned his sad, wise eyes on him in silence, and
gravely extended a little hand.
</p><p>"You may kiss his Highness's hand," said Kalonay, smiling.
</p><p>Gordon laughed and pressed the fingers in his own.
</p><p>"When you talk like that, Kalonay," he said, "you make me feel like
Alice in the court-room with the Kings and Queens around her.  A dozen
times this afternoon I've felt like saying, `After all, they are only a
pack of cards.'"
</p><p>Kalonay shook his head and glanced toward Miss Carson for enlightenment.
</p><p>"I don't understand," he said.
</p><p>"No, you couldn't be expected to," said Gordon; "You have not been
educated up to that.  It is the point of view."
</p><p>He stuck out the middle finger of his hand, and drove it three times
deliberately into the side of the Crown Prince.  The child gasped and
stared open-mouthed at the friendly stranger, and then catching the
laugh in Gordon's eyes, laughed with him.
</p><p>"Now," said Gordon, "I shall say that I have dug the King of Messina in
the ribs--that is even better than having kissed him.  God bless your
Royal Highness," he said, bowing gravely.  "You may find me
disrespectful at times," he added; "but then, you must remember, I am
going to risk a valuable life for you.  At least it's an extremely
valuable one to me."
</p><p>Kalonay looked at Gordon for a moment with serious consideration, and
then held out his hand.  "You also had faith in me," he said.  "I thank
you.  Are you in earnest; do you really wish to serve us?"
</p><p>"I mean to stay by you until the boy is crowned," said the American,
"unless we separate on our several paths of glory--where they will lead
depends, I imagine, on how we have lived."
</p><p>"Or on how we die," Kalonay added.  "I am glad to hear you speak so.
If you wish, I shall attach you to the person of the Crown Prince.  You
shall be on the staff with the rank of Colonel."
</p><p>Gordon made a low and sweeping bow.
</p><p>"Rise, Sir Archibald Gordon," he said.  "I thank you," he added. "We
shall strive to please."
</p><p>Miss Carson shook her head at him, and sighed in protest.
</p><p>"Will you always take everything as a joke, Archie?" she said.
</p><p>"My dear Patty," he answered, "the situation is much too serious to
take in any other way."
</p><p>They moved to the door, and there the priest and Mrs. Carson joined
them; but on the threshold Kalonay stopped and looked for the first
time since he had addressed him at the King.
</p><p>He regarded him for some seconds sternly in silence, and then pointed,
with his free hand, at the crown of Messina, which still rested on the
table at the King's elbow.  "Colonel Gordon," he said, in a tone of
assured authority, "I give the crown of Messina into your keeping.  You
will convey it, with all proper regard for its dignity, safely on board
the yacht, and then bring it at once to me."
</p><p>When he had finished speaking the Prince turned and, without looking at
the King, passed on with the others across the terrace and disappeared
in the direction of the shore, where the launch lay waiting.
</p><p>Gordon crossed the room and picked up the crown from the table, lifting
it with both hands, the King and Barrat watching him in silence as he
did so.  He hesitated, and held it for a moment, regarding it with much
the same expression of awe and amusement that a man shows when he is
permitted to hold a strange baby in his arms.  Turning, he saw the
sinister eyes of the King and of Barrat fastened upon him, and he
smiled awkwardly, and in some embarrassment turned the crown about in
his hands, so that the jewels in its circle gleamed dully in the dim
light of the room.  Gordon raised the crown and balanced it on his
finger-tips, regarding it severely and shaking his head.
</p><p>"There are very few of these left in the world now, your Majesty," he
said, cheerfully, "and the number is getting smaller every year.  We
have none at all in my country, and I should think--seeing they are so
few--that those who have them would take better care of them, and try
to keep them untarnished, and brushed up, and clean."  He turned his
head and looked inquiringly at the King, but Louis made no sign that he
heard him.
</p><p>"I have no desire, you understand me," continued Gordon, unabashed, "to
take advantage of a man when he is down, but the temptation to say `I
told you so' seems almost impossible to resist.  What?" he asked--"I
beg your pardon, I thought you spoke."  But the King continued
scornfully silent, and only a contemptuous snort from Barrat expressed
his feelings.
</p><p>Gordon placed the crown carefully under his arm, and then removed it
quickly, with a guilty look of dismay at its former owner, and let it
swing from his hand; but this fashion of carrying it seemed also
lacking in respect, so he held it up again with both hands and glanced
at the King in some perplexity.
</p><p>"There ought to be a sofa-cushion to go with this, or something to
carry it on," he said, in a grieved tone.  "You see, I am new at this
sort of thing.  Perhaps your Majesty would kindly give me some expert
information.  How do you generally carry it?"
</p><p>The King's eyes snapped open and shut again.
</p><p>"On my head," he said, grimly.
</p><p>Gordon laughed in great relief.
</p><p>"Now, do you know, I like that," he cried.  "That shows spirit.  I am
glad to see you take it so cheerfully.  Well, I must be going, sir," he
added, nodding, and moving toward the door.  "Don't be discouraged.  As
someone says, `It's always morning somewhere,' and in my country
there's just as good men out of office as there are in it.  Good-night."
</p><p>While the sound of Gordon's footsteps died away across the marble
terrace, the King and Barrat remained motionless and silent.  The
darkness in the room deepened and the silence seemed to deepen with it;
and still they remained immovable, two shadowy figures in the deserted
apartment where the denunciations of those who had abandoned them still
seemed to hang and echo in the darkness.  What thoughts passed through
their minds or for how long a time they might still have sat in bitter
contemplation can only be guessed, for they were surprised by the sharp
rattle of a lock, the two great doors of the adjoining room were thrown
wide open, and a broad and brilliant light flooded the apartment.
Niccolas, the King's majordomo, stood  between the doors, a black
silhouette against the glare of many candles.
</p><p>"His Majesty is served!" he said.
</p><p>The King lifted his head sharply, as though he found some lurking
mockery in the words, or some fresh affront; but in the obsequious bow
of his majordomo there was no mockery, and the table beyond glistened
with silver, while a pungent and convincing odor of rich food was
wafted insidiously through the open doors.
</p><p>The King rose with a gentle sigh, and nodded to his companion.
</p><p>"Come, Barrat," he said, taking the baron's arm in his.  "The rascals
have robbed us of our throne, but, thank God, they have had the grace
to leave me my appetite."
