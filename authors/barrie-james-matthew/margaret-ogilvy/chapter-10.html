For years I had been trying to prepare myself for my mother's 
death, trying to foresee how she would die, seeing myself when she 
was dead.  Even then I knew it was a vain thing I did, but I am 
sure there was no morbidness in it.  I hoped I should be with her 
at the end, not as the one she looked at last but as him from whom 
she would turn only to look upon her best-beloved, not my arm but 
my sister's should be round her when she died, not my hand but my 
sister's should close her eyes.  I knew that I might reach her too 
late; I saw myself open a door where there was none to greet me, 
and go up the old stair into the old room.  But what I did not 
foresee was that which happened.  I little thought it could come 
about that I should climb the old stair, and pass the door beyond 
which my mother lay dead, and enter another room first, and go on 
my knees there.
<P>
My mother's favourite paraphrase is one known in our house as 
David's because it was the last he learned to repeat.  It was also 
the last thing she read-
<P>
<P>
Art thou afraid his power shall fail
When comes thy evil day?
And can an all-creating arm
Grow weary or decay?
<P>
<P>
I heard her voice gain strength as she read it, I saw her timid 
face take courage, but when came my evil day, then at the dawning, 
alas for me, I was afraid.
<P>
In those last weeks, though we did not know it, my sister was dying 
on her feet.  For many years she had been giving her life, a little 
bit at a time, for another year, another month, latterly for 
another day, of her mother, and now she was worn out.  'I'll never 
leave you, mother.' - 'Fine I know you'll never leave me.'  I 
thought that cry so pathetic at the time, but I was not to know its 
full significance until it was only the echo of a cry.  Looking at 
these two then it was to me as if my mother had set out for the new 
country, and my sister held her back.  But I see with a clearer 
vision now.  It is no longer the mother but the daughter who is in 
front, and she cries, 'Mother, you are lingering so long at the 
end, I have ill waiting for you.'
<P>
But she knew no more than we how it was to be; if she seemed weary 
when we met her on the stair, she was still the brightest, the most 
active figure in my mother's room; she never complained, save when 
she had to depart on that walk which separated them for half an 
hour.  How reluctantly she put on her bonnet, how we had to press 
her to it, and how often, having gone as far as the door, she came 
back to stand by my mother's side.  Sometimes as we watched from 
the window, I could not but laugh, and yet with a pain at my heart, 
to see her hasting doggedly onward, not an eye for right or left, 
nothing in her head but the return.  There was always my father in 
the house, than whom never was a more devoted husband, and often 
there were others, one daughter in particular, but they scarce 
dared tend my mother - this one snatched the cup jealously from 
their hands.  My mother liked it best from her.  We all knew this.  
'I like them fine, but I canna do without you.'  My sister, so 
unselfish in all other things, had an unwearying passion for 
parading it before us.  It was the rich reward of her life.
<P>
The others spoke among themselves of what must come soon, and they 
had tears to help them, but this daughter would not speak of it, 
and her tears were ever slow to come.  I knew that night and day 
she was trying to get ready for a world without her mother in it, 
but she must remain dumb; none of us was so Scotch as she, she must 
bear her agony alone, a tragic solitary Scotchwoman.  Even my 
mother, who spoke so calmly to us of the coming time, could not 
mention it to her.  These two, the one in bed, and the other 
bending over her, could only look long at each other, until slowly 
the tears came to my sister's eyes, and then my mother would turn 
away her wet face.  And still neither said a word, each knew so 
well what was in the other's thoughts, so eloquently they spoke in 
silence, 'Mother, I am loath to let you go,' and 'Oh my daughter, 
now that my time is near, I wish you werena quite so fond of me.'  
But when the daughter had slipped away my mother would grip my hand 
and cry, 'I leave her to you; you see how she has sown, it will 
depend on you how she is to reap.'  And I made promises, but I 
suppose neither of us saw that she had already reaped.
<P>
In the night my mother might waken and sit up in bed, confused by 
what she saw.  While she slept, six decades or more had rolled back 
and she was again in her girlhood; suddenly recalled from it she 
was dizzy, as with the rush of the years.  How had she come into 
this room?  When she went to bed last night, after preparing her 
father's supper, there had been a dresser at the window: what had 
become of the salt-bucket, the meal-tub, the hams that should be 
hanging from the rafters?  There were no rafters; it was a papered 
ceiling.  She had often heard of open beds, but how came she to be 
lying in one?  To fathom these things she would try to spring out 
of bed and be startled to find it a labour, as if she had been 
taken ill in the night.  Hearing her move I might knock on the wall 
that separated us, this being a sign, prearranged between us, that 
I was near by, and so all was well, but sometimes the knocking 
seemed to belong to the past, and she would cry, 'That is my father 
chapping at the door, I maun rise and let him in.'  She seemed to 
see him - and it was one much younger than herself that she saw - 
covered with snow, kicking clods of it from his boots, his hands 
swollen and chapped with sand and wet.  Then I would hear - it was 
a common experience of the night - my sister soothing her lovingly, 
and turning up the light to show her where she was, helping her to 
the window to let her see that it was no night of snow, even 
humouring her by going downstairs, and opening the outer door, and 
calling into the darkness, 'Is anybody there?' and if that was not 
sufficient, she would swaddle my mother in wraps and take her 
through the rooms of the house, lighting them one by one, pointing 
out familiar objects, and so guiding her slowly through the sixty 
odd years she had jumped too quickly.  And perhaps the end of it 
was that my mother came to my bedside and said wistfully, 'Am I an 
auld woman?'
<P>
But with daylight, even during the last week in which I saw her, 
she would be up and doing, for though pitifully frail she no longer 
suffered from any ailment.  She seemed so well comparatively that 
I, having still the remnants of an illness to shake off, was to 
take a holiday in Switzerland, and then return for her, when we 
were all to go to the much-loved manse of her much-loved brother in 
the west country.  So she had many preparations on her mind, and 
the morning was the time when she had any strength to carry them 
out.  To leave her house had always been a month's work for her, it 
must be left in such perfect order, every corner visited and 
cleaned out, every chest probed to the bottom, the linen lifted 
out, examined and put back lovingly as if to make it lie more 
easily in her absence, shelves had to be re-papered, a strenuous 
week devoted to the garret.  Less exhaustively, but with much of 
the old exultation in her house, this was done for the last time, 
and then there was the bringing out of her own clothes, and the 
spreading of them upon the bed and the pleased fingering of them, 
and the consultations about which should be left behind.  Ah, 
beautiful dream! I clung to it every morning; I would not look when 
my sister shook her head at it, but long before each day was done I 
too knew that it could never be.  It had come true many times, but 
never again.  We two knew it, but when my mother, who must always 
be prepared so long beforehand, called for her trunk and band-boxes 
we brought them to her, and we stood silent, watching, while she 
packed.
<P>
The morning came when I was to go away.  It had come a hundred 
times, when I was a boy, when I was an undergraduate, when I was a 
man, when she had seemed big and strong to me, when she was grown 
so little and it was I who put my arms round her.  But always it 
was the same scene.  I am not to write about it, of the parting and 
the turning back on the stair, and two people trying to smile, and 
the setting off again, and the cry that brought me back.  Nor shall 
I say more of the silent figure in the background, always in the 
background, always near my mother.  The last I saw of these two was 
from the gate.  They were at the window which never passes from my 
eyes.  I could not see my dear sister's face, for she was bending 
over my mother, pointing me out to her, and telling her to wave her 
hand and smile, because I liked it so.  That action was an epitome 
of my sister's life.
<P>
I had been gone a fortnight when the telegram was put into my 
hands.  I had got a letter from my sister, a few hours before, 
saying that all was well at home.  The telegram said in five words 
that she had died suddenly the previous night.  There was no 
mention of my mother, and I was three days' journey from home.
<P>
The news I got on reaching London was this: my mother did not 
understand that her daughter was dead, and they were waiting for me 
to tell her.
<P>
I need not have been such a coward.  This is how these two died - 
for, after all, I was too late by twelve hours to see my mother 
alive.
<P>
Their last night was almost gleeful.  In the old days that hour 
before my mother's gas was lowered had so often been the happiest 
that my pen steals back to it again and again as I write: it was 
the time when my mother lay smiling in bed and we were gathered 
round her like children at play, our reticence scattered on the 
floor or tossed in sport from hand to hand, the author become so 
boisterous that in the pauses they were holding him in check by 
force.  Rather woful had been some attempts latterly to renew those 
evenings, when my mother might be brought to the verge of them, as 
if some familiar echo called her, but where she was she did not 
clearly know, because the past was roaring in her ears like a great 
sea.  But this night was a last gift to my sister.  The joyousness 
of their voices drew the others in the house upstairs, where for 
more than an hour my mother was the centre of a merry party and so 
clear of mental eye that they, who were at first cautious, 
abandoned themselves to the sport, and whatever they said, by way 
of humorous rally, she instantly capped as of old, turning their 
darts against themselves until in self-defence they were three to 
one, and the three hard pressed.  How my sister must have been 
rejoicing.  Once again she could cry, 'Was there ever such a 
woman!'  They tell me that such a happiness was on the daughter's 
face that my mother commented on it, that having risen to go they 
sat down again, fascinated by the radiance of these two.  And when 
eventually they went, the last words they heard were, 'They are 
gone, you see, mother, but I am here, I will never leave you,' and 
'Na, you winna leave me; fine I know that.'  For some time 
afterwards their voices could be heard from downstairs, but what 
they talked of is not known.  And then came silence.  Had I been at 
home I should have been in the room again several times, turning 
the handle of the door softly, releasing it so that it did not 
creak, and standing looking at them.  It had been so a thousand 
times.  But that night, would I have slipped out again, mind at 
rest, or should I have seen the change coming while they slept?
<P>
Let it be told in the fewest words.  My sister awoke next morning 
with a headache.  She had always been a martyr to headaches, but 
this one, like many another, seemed to be unusually severe.  
Nevertheless she rose and lit my mother's fire and brought up her 
breakfast, and then had to return to bed.  She was not able to 
write her daily letter to me, saying how my mother was, and almost 
the last thing she did was to ask my father to write it, and not to 
let on that she was ill, as it would distress me.  The doctor was 
called, but she rapidly became unconscious.  In this state she was 
removed from my mother's bed to another.  It was discovered that 
she was suffering from an internal disease.  No one had guessed it.  
She herself never knew.  Nothing could be done.  In this 
unconsciousness she passed away, without knowing that she was 
leaving her mother.  Had I known, when I heard of her death, that 
she had been saved that pain, surely I could have gone home more 
bravely with the words,
<P>
<P>
Art thou afraid His power fail
When comes thy evil day?
<P>
<P>
Ah, you would think so, I should have thought so, but I know myself 
now.  When I reached London I did hear how my sister died, but 
still I was afraid.  I saw myself in my mother's room telling her 
why the door of the next room was locked, and I was afraid.  God 
had done so much, and yet I could not look confidently to Him for 
the little that was left to do.  'O ye of little faith!'  These are 
the words I seem to hear my mother saying to me now, and she looks 
at me so sorrowfully.
<P>
He did it very easily, and it has ceased to seem marvellous to me 
because it was so plainly His doing.  My timid mother saw the one 
who was never to leave her carried unconscious from the room, and 
she did not break down.  She who used to wring her hands if her 
daughter was gone for a moment never asked for her again, they were 
afraid to mention her name; an awe fell upon them.  But I am sure 
they need not have been so anxious.  There are mysteries in life 
and death, but this was not one of them.  A child can understand 
what happened.  God said that my sister must come first, but He put 
His hand on my mother's eyes at that moment and she was altered.
<P>
They told her that I was on my way home, and she said with a 
confident smile, 'He will come as quick as trains can bring him.'  
That is my reward, that is what I have got for my books.  
Everything I could do for her in this life I have done since I was 
a boy; I look back through the years and I cannot see the smallest 
thing left undone.
<P>
They were buried together on my mother's seventy-sixth birthday, 
though there had been three days between their deaths.  On the last 
day, my mother insisted on rising from bed and going through the 
house.  The arms that had so often helped her on that journey were 
now cold in death, but there were others only less loving, and she 
went slowly from room to room like one bidding good-bye, and in 
mine she said, 'The beautiful rows upon rows of books, ant he said 
every one of them was mine, all mine!' and in the east room, which 
was her greatest triumph, she said caressingly, 'My nain bonny 
room!'  All this time there seemed to be something that she wanted, 
but the one was dead who always knew what she wanted, and they 
produced many things at which she shook her head.  They did not 
know then that she was dying, but they followed her through the 
house in some apprehension, and after she returned to bed they saw 
that she was becoming very weak.  Once she said eagerly, 'Is that 
you, David?' and again she thought she heard her father knocking 
the snow off his boots.  Her desire for that which she could not 
name came back to her, and at last they saw that what she wanted 
was the old christening robe.  It was brought to her, and she 
unfolded it with trembling, exultant hands, and when she had made 
sure that it was still of virgin fairness her old arms went round 
it adoringly, and upon her face there was the ineffable mysterious 
glow of motherhood.  Suddenly she said, 'Wha's bairn's dead? is a 
bairn of mine dead?' but those watching dared not speak, and then 
slowly as if with an effort of memory she repeated our names aloud 
in the order in which we were born.  Only one, who should have come 
third among the ten, did she omit, the one in the next room, but at 
the end, after a pause, she said her name and repeated it again and 
again and again, lingering over it as if it were the most exquisite 
music and this her dying song.  And yet it was a very commonplace 
name.
<P>
They knew now that she was dying.  She told them to fold up the 
christening robe and almost sharply she watched them put it away, 
and then for some time she talked of the long lovely life that had 
been hers, and of Him to whom she owed it.  She said good-bye to 
them all, and at last turned her face to the side where her best-
beloved had lain, and for over an hour she prayed.  They only 
caught the words now and again, and the last they heard were 'God' 
and 'love.'  I think God was smiling when He took her to Him, as He 
had so often smiled at her during those seventy-six years.
<P>
I saw her lying dead, and her face was beautiful and serene.  But 
it was the other room I entered first, and it was by my sister's 
side that I fell upon my knees.  The rounded completeness of a 
woman's life that was my mother's had not been for her.  She would 
not have it at the price.  'I'll never leave you, mother.' - 'Fine 
I know you'll never leave me.'  The fierce joy of loving too much, 
it is a terrible thing.  My sister's mouth was firmly closed, as if 
she had got her way.
<P>
And now I am left without them, but I trust my memory will ever go 
back to those happy days, not to rush through them, but dallying 
here and there, even as my mother wanders through my books.  And if 
I also live to a time when age must dim my mind and the past comes 
sweeping back like the shades of night over the bare road of the 
present it will not, I believe, be my youth I shall see but hers, 
not a boy clinging to his mother's skirt and crying, 'Wait till I'm 
a man, and you'll lie on feathers,' but a little girl in a magenta 
frock and a white pinafore, who comes toward me through the long 
parks, singing to herself, and carrying her father's dinner in a 
flagon.
