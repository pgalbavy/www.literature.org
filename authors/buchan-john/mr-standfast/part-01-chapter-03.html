<p>Thirty-five hours later I found myself in my rooms in Westminster.
I thought there might be a message for me there, for I didn’t
propose to go and call openly on Blenkiron at Claridge’s till
I had his instructions. But there was no message—only a line from
Peter, saying he had hopes of being sent to Switzerland. That
made me realise that he must be pretty badly broken up.</p>

<p>Presently the telephone bell rang. It was Blenkiron who spoke.
"Go down and have a talk with your brokers about the War Loan.
Arrive there about twelve o’clock and don’t go upstairs till you
have met a friend. You’d better have a quick luncheon at your
club, and then come to Traill’s bookshop in the Haymarket at two.
You can get back to Biggleswick by the 5.16."</p>

<p>I did as I was bid, and twenty minutes later, having travelled
by Underground, for I couldn’t raise a taxi, I approached the
block of chambers in Leadenhall Street where dwelt the respected
firm who managed my investments. It was still a few minutes before
noon, and as I slowed down a familiar figure came out of the bank
next door.</p>

<p>Ivery beamed recognition. "Up for the day, Mr Brand?" he asked.
"I have to see my brokers," I said, "read the South African papers
in my club, and get back by the 5.16. Any chance of your company?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes—that’s my train. <em>Au revoir</em>. We meet at the
station." He bustled off, looking very smart with his neat clothes
and a rose in his button-hole.</p>

<p>I lunched impatiently, and at two was turning over some new books
in Traill’s shop with an eye on the street-door behind me. It
seemed a public place for an assignation. I had begun to dip into
a big illustrated book on flower-gardens when an assistant came
up. "The manager’s compliments, sir, and he thinks there are some
old works of travel upstairs that might interest you." I followed
him obediently to an upper floor lined with every kind of volume
and with tables littered with maps and engravings. "This way,
sir," he said, and opened a door in the wall concealed by bogus
book-backs. I found myself in a little study, and Blenkiron sitting
in an armchair smoking.</p>

<p>He got up and seized both my hands. "Why, Dick, this is better
than good noos. I’ve heard all about your exploits since we parted
a year ago on the wharf at Liverpool. We’ve both been busy on
our own jobs, and there was no way of keeping you wise about my
doings, for after I thought I was cured I got worse than hell
inside, and, as I told you, had to get the doctor-men to dig into
me. After that I was playing a pretty dark game, and had to get
down and out of decent society. But, holy Mike! I’m a new man.
I used to do my work with a sick heart and a taste in my mouth
like a graveyard, and now I can eat and drink what I like and
frolic round like a colt. I wake up every morning whistling and
thank the good God that I’m alive. It was a bad day for Kaiser
when I got on the cars for White Springs."</p>

<p>"This is a rum place to meet," I said, "and you brought me by
a roundabout road."</p>

<p>He grinned and offered me a cigar.</p>

<p>"There were reasons. It don’t do for you and me to advertise
our acquaintance in the street. As for the shop, I’ve owned it
for five years. I’ve a taste for good reading, though you wouldn’t
think it, and it tickles me to hand it out across the counter....
First, I want to hear about Biggleswick."</p>

<p>"There isn’t a great deal to it. A lot of ignorance, a large
slice of vanity, and a pinch or two of wrong-headed honesty—these
are the ingredients of the pie. Not much real harm in it. There’s
one or two dirty literary gents who should be in a navvies’ battalion,
but they’re about as dangerous as yellow Kaffir dogs. I’ve learned
a lot and got all the arguments by heart, but you might plant
a Biggleswick in every shire and it wouldn’t help the Boche. I
can see where the danger lies all the same. These fellows talked
academic anarchism, but the genuine article is somewhere about
and to find it you’ve got to look in the big industrial districts.
We had faint echoes of it in Biggleswick. I mean that the really
dangerous fellows are those who want to close up the war at once
and so get on with their blessed class war, which cuts across
nationalities. As for being spies and that sort of thing, the
Biggleswick lads are too callow."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Blenkiron reflectively. "They haven’t got as much
sense as God gave to geese. You’re sure you didn’t hit against
any heavier metal?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There’s a man called Launcelot Wake, who came down to speak
once. I had met him before. He has the makings of a fanatic, and
he’s the more dangerous because you can see his conscience is
uneasy. I can fancy him bombing a Prime Minister merely to quiet
his own doubts."</p>

<p>"So," he said. "Nobody else?"</p>

<p>I reflected. "There’s Mr Ivery, but you know him better than
I. I shouldn’t put much on him, but I’m not precisely certain,
for I never had a chance of getting to know him."</p>

<p>"Ivery," said Blenkiron in surprise. "He has a hobby for half-baked
youth, just as another rich man might fancy orchids or fast trotters.
You sure can place him right enough."</p>

<p>"I dare say. Only I don’t know enough to be positive."</p>

<p>He sucked at his cigar for a minute or so. "I guess, Dick, if
I told you all I’ve been doing since I reached these shores you
would call me a romancer. I’ve been way down among the toilers.
I did a spell as unskilled dilooted labour in the Barrow shipyards.
I was barman in a hotel on the Portsmouth Road, and I put in a
black month driving a taxicab in the city of London. For a while
I was the accredited correspondent of the <em>Noo York Sentinel</em>
and used to go with the rest of the bunch to the pow-wows of under-secretaries
of State and War Office generals. They censored my stuff so cruel
that the paper fired me. Then I went on a walking-tour round England
and sat for a fortnight in a little farm in Suffolk. By and by
I came back to Claridge’s and this bookshop, for I had learned
most of what I wanted.</p>

<p>"I had learned," he went on, turning his curious, full, ruminating
eyes on me, "that the British working-man is about the soundest
piece of humanity on God’s earth. He grumbles a bit and jibs a
bit when he thinks the Government are giving him a crooked deal,
but he’s gotten the patience of Job and the sand of a gamecock.
And he’s gotten humour too, that tickles me to death. There’s
not much trouble in that quarter for it’s he and his kind that’s
beating the Hun.... But I picked up a thing or two besides that."</p>

<p>He leaned forward and tapped me on the knee. "I reverence the
British Intelligence Service. Flies don’t settle on it to any
considerable extent. It’s got a mighty fine mesh, but there’s
one hole in that mesh, and it’s our job to mend it. There’s a
high-powered brain in the game against us. I struck it a couple
of years ago when I was hunting Dumba and Albert, and I thought
it was in Noo York, but it wasn’t. I struck its working again
at home last year and located its head office in Europe. So I
tried Switzerland and Holland, but only bits of it were there.
The centre of the web where the old spider sits is right here
in England, and for six months I’ve been shadowing that spider.
There’s a gang to help, a big gang, and a clever gang, and partly
an innocent gang. But there’s only one brain, and it’s to match
that that the Robson Brothers settled my duodenum."</p>

<p>I was listening with a quickened pulse, for now at last I was
getting to business.</p>

<p>"What is he—international socialist, or anarchist, or what?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Pure-blooded Boche agent, but the biggest-sized brand in the
catalogue—bigger than Steinmeier or old Bismarck’s Staubier. Thank
God I’ve got him located.... I must put you wise about some things."</p>

<p>He lay back in his rubbed leather armchair and yarned for twenty
minutes. He told me how at the beginning of the war Scotland Yard
had had a pretty complete register of enemy spies, and without
making any fuss had just tidied them away. After that, the covey
having been broken up, it was a question of picking off stray
birds. That had taken some doing. There had been all kinds of
inflammatory stuff around, Red Masons and international anarchists,
and, worst of all, international finance-touts, but they had mostly
been ordinary cranks and rogues, the tools of the Boche agents
rather than agents themselves. However, by the middle of 1915
most of the stragglers had been gathered in. But there remained
loose ends, and towards the close of last year somebody was very
busy combining these ends into a net. Funny cases cropped up of
the leakage of vital information. They began to be bad about October
1916, when the Hun submarines started on a special racket. The
enemy suddenly appeared possessed of a knowledge which we thought
to be shared only by half a dozen officers. Blenkiron said he
was not surprised at the leakage, for there’s always a lot of
people who hear things they oughtn’t to. What surprised him was
that it got so quickly to the enemy.</p>

<p>Then after last February, when the Hun submarines went in for
frightfulness on a big scale, the thing grew desperate. Leakages
occurred every week, and the business was managed by people who
knew their way about, for they avoided all the traps set for them,
and when bogus news was released on purpose, they never sent it.
A convoy which had been kept a deadly secret would be attacked
at the one place where it was helpless. A carefully prepared defensive
plan would be checkmated before it could be tried. Blenkiron said
that there was no evidence that a single brain was behind it all,
for there was no similarity in the cases, but he had a strong
impression all the time that it was the work of one man. We managed
to close some of the bolt-holes, but we couldn’t put our hands
near the big ones. "By this time," said he, "I reckoned I was
about ready to change my methods. I had been working by what the
highbrows call induction, trying to argue up from the deeds to
the doer. Now I tried a new lay, which was to calculate down from
the doer to the deeds. They call it deduction. I opined that somewhere
in this island was a gentleman whom we will call Mr X, and that,
pursuing the line of business he did, he must have certain characteristics.
I considered very carefully just what sort of personage he must
be. I had noticed that his device was apparently the Double Bluff.
That is to say, when he had two courses open to him, A and B,
he pretended he was going to take B, and so got us guessing that
he would try A. Then he took B after all. So I reckoned that his
camouflage must correspond to this little idiosyncrasy. Being
a Boche agent, he wouldn’t pretend to be a hearty patriot, an
honest old blood-and-bones Tory. That would be only the Single
Bluff. I considered that he would be a pacifist, cunning enough
just to keep inside the law, but with the eyes of the police on
him. He would write books which would not be allowed to be exported.
He would get himself disliked in the popular papers, but all the
mugwumps would admire his moral courage. I drew a mighty fine
picture to myself of just the man I expected to find. Then I started
out to look for him."</p>

<p>Blenkiron’s face took on the air of a disappointed child. "It
was no good. I kept barking up the wrong tree and wore myself
out playing the sleuth on white-souled innocents."</p>

<p>"But you’ve found him all right," I cried, a sudden suspicion
leaping into my brain.</p>

<p>"He’s found," he said sadly, "but the credit does not belong
to John S. Blenkiron. That child merely muddied the pond. The
big fish was left for a young lady to hook."</p>

<p>"I know," I cried excitedly. "Her name is Miss Mary Lamington."</p>

<p>He shook a disapproving head. "You’ve guessed right, my son,
but you’ve forgotten your manners. This is a rough business and
we won’t bring in the name of a gently reared and pure-minded
young girl. If we speak to her at all we call her by a pet name
out of the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>.... Anyhow she hooked the
fish, though he isn’t landed. D’you see any light?"</p>

<p>"Ivery," I gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes. Ivery. Nothing much to look at, you say. A common, middle-aged,
pie-faced, golf-playing high-brow, that you wouldn’t keep out
of a Sunday school. A touch of the drummer, too, to show he has
no dealings with your effete aristocracy. A languishing silver-tongue
that adores the sound of his own voice. As mild, you’d say, as
curds and cream."</p>

<p>Blenkiron got out of his chair and stood above me. "I tell you,
Dick, that man makes my spine cold. He hasn’t a drop of good red
blood in him. The dirtiest <em>apache</em> is a Christian gentleman
compared to Moxon Ivery. He’s as cruel as a snake and as deep
as hell. But, by God, he’s got a brain below his hat. He’s hooked
and we’re playing him, but Lord knows if he’ll ever be landed!"</p>

<p>"Why on earth don’t you put him away?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We haven’t the proof—legal proof, I mean; though there’s buckets
of the other kind. I could put up a morally certain case, but
he’d beat me in a court of law. And half a hundred sheep would
get up in Parliament and bleat about persecution. He has a graft
with every collection of cranks in England, and with all the geese
that cackle about the liberty of the individual when the Boche
is ranging about to enslave the world. No, sir, that’s too dangerous
a game! Besides, I’ve a better in hand, Moxon Ivery is the best-accredited
member of this State. His <em>dossier</em> is the completest thing
outside the Recording Angel’s little note-book. We’ve taken up
his references in every corner of the globe and they’re all as
right as Morgan’s balance sheet. From these it appears he’s been
a high-toned citizen ever since he was in short-clothes. He was
raised in Norfolk, and there are people living who remember his
father. He was educated at Melton School and his name’s in the
register. He was in business in Valparaiso, and there’s enough
evidence to write three volumes of his innocent life there. Then
he came home with a modest competence two years before the war,
and has been in the public eye ever since. He was Liberal candidate
for a London constitooency and he has decorated the board of every
institootion formed for the amelioration of mankind. He’s got
enough alibis to choke a boa constrictor, and they’re water-tight
and copper-bottomed, and they’re mostly damned lies.... But you
can’t beat him at that stunt. The man’s the superbest actor that
ever walked the earth. You can see it in his face. It isn’t a
face, it’s a mask. He could make himself look like Shakespeare
or Julius Caesar or Billy Sunday or Brigadier-General Richard
Hannay if he wanted to. He hasn’t got any personality either—he’s
got fifty, and there’s no one he could call his own. I reckon
when the devil gets the handling of him at last he’ll have to
put sand on his claws to keep him from slipping through."</p>

<p>Blenkiron was settled in his chair again, with one leg hoisted
over the side.</p>

<p>"We’ve closed a fair number of his channels in the last few months.
No, he don’t suspect me. The world knows nothing of its greatest
men, and to him I’m only a Yankee peace-crank, who gives big subscriptions
to loony societies and will travel a hundred miles to let off
steam before any kind of audience. He’s been to see me at Claridge’s
and I’ve arranged that he shall know all my record. A darned bad
record it is too, for two years ago I was violent pro-British
before I found salvation and was requested to leave England. When
I was home last I was officially anti-war, when I wasn’t stretched
upon a bed of pain. Mr Moxon Ivery don’t take any stock in John
S. Blenkiron as a serious proposition. And while I’ve been here
I’ve been so low down in the social scale and working in so many
devious ways that he can’t connect me up.... As I was saying,
we’ve cut most of his wires, but the biggest we haven’t got at.
He’s still sending stuff out, and mighty compromising stuff it
is. Now listen close, Dick, for we’re coming near your own business."</p>

<p>It appeared that Blenkiron had reason to suspect that the channel
still open had something to do with the North. He couldn’t get
closer than that, till he heard from his people that a certain
Abel Gresson had turned up in Glasgow from the States. This Gresson
he discovered was the same as one Wrankester, who as a leader
of the Industrial Workers of the World had been mixed up in some
ugly cases of <em>sabotage</em> in Colorado. He kept his news
to himself, for he didn’t want the police to interfere, but he
had his own lot get into touch with Gresson and shadow him closely.
The man was very discreet but very mysterious, and he would disappear
for a week at a time, leaving no trace. For some unknown reason—he
couldn’t explain why—Blenkiron had arrived at the conclusion that
Gresson was in touch with Ivery, so he made experiments to prove
it.</p>

<p>"I wanted various cross-bearings to make certain, and I got them
the night before last. My visit to Biggleswick was good business."</p>

<p>"I don’t know what they meant," I said, "but I know where they
came in. One was in your speech when you spoke of the Austrian
socialists, and Ivery took you up about them. The other was after
supper when he quoted the <em>Weser Zeitung</em>."</p>

<p>"You’re no fool, Dick," he said, with his slow smile. "You’ve
hit the mark first shot. You know me and you could follow my process
of thought in those remarks. Ivery, not knowing me so well, and
having his head full of just that sort of argument, saw nothing
unusual. Those bits of noos were pumped into Gresson that he might
pass them on. And he did pass them on—to Ivery. They completed
my chain."</p>

<p>"But they were commonplace enough things which he might have
guessed for himself."</p>

<p>"No, they weren’t. They were the nicest tit-bits of political
noos which all the cranks have been reaching after."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, they were quotations from German papers. He might have
had the papers themselves earlier than you thought."</p>

<p>"Wrong again. The paragraph never appeared in the <em>Weser Zeitung</em>.
But we faked up a torn bit of that noospaper, and a very pretty
bit of forgery it was, and Gresson, who’s a kind of a scholar,
was allowed to have it. He passed it on. Ivery showed it me two
nights ago. Nothing like it ever sullied the columns of Boche
journalism. No, it was a perfectly final proof.... Now, Dick,
it’s up to you to get after Gresson."</p>

<p>"Right," I said. "I’m jolly glad I’m to start work again. I’m
getting fat from lack of exercise. I suppose you want me to catch
Gresson out in some piece of blackguardism and have him and Ivery
snugly put away."</p>

<p>"I don’t want anything of the kind," he said very slowly and
distinctly. "You’ve got to attend very close to your instructions,
I cherish these two beauties as if they were my own white-headed
boys. I wouldn’t for the world interfere with their comfort and
liberty. I want them to go on corresponding with their friends.
I want to give them every facility."</p>

<p>He burst out laughing at my mystified face.</p>

<p>"See here, Dick. How do we want to treat the Boche? Why, to fill
him up with all the cunningest lies and get him to act on them.
Now here is Moxon Ivery, who has always given them good information.
They trust him absolutely, and we would be fools to spoil their
confidence. Only, if we can find out Moxon’s methods, we can arrange
to use them ourselves and send noos in his name which isn’t quite
so genooine. Every word he dispatches goes straight to the Grand
High Secret General Staff, and old Hindenburg and Ludendorff put
towels round their heads and cipher it out. We want to encourage
them to go on doing it. We’ll arrange to send true stuff that
don’t matter, so as they’ll continue to trust him, and a few selected
falsehoods that’ll matter like hell. It’s a game you can’t play
for ever, but with luck I propose to play it long enough to confuse
Fritz’s little plans."</p>

<p>His face became serious and wore the air that our corps commander
used to have at the big pow-wow before a push.</p>

<p>"I’m not going to give you instructions, for you’re man enough
to make your own. But I can give you the general hang of the situation.
You tell Ivery you’re going North to inquire into industrial disputes
at first hand. That will seem to him natural and in line with
your recent behaviour. He’ll tell his people that you’re a guileless
colonial who feels disgruntled with Britain, and may come in useful.
You’ll go to a man of mine in Glasgow, a red-hot agitator who
chooses that way of doing his bit for his country. It’s a darned
hard way and darned dangerous. Through him you’ll get in touch
with Gresson, and you’ll keep alongside that bright citizen. Find
out what he is doing, and get a chance of following him. He must
never suspect you, and for that purpose you must be very near
the edge of the law yourself. You go up there as an unabashed
pacifist and you’ll live with folk that will turn your stomach.
Maybe you’ll have to break some of these two-cent rules the British
Government have invented to defend the realm, and it’s up to you
not to get caught out.... Remember, you’ll get no help from me.
You’ve got to wise up about Gresson with the whole forces of the
British State arrayed officially against you. I guess it’s a steep
proposition, but you’re man enough to make good."</p>

<p>As we shook hands, he added a last word. "You must take your
own time, but it’s not a case for slouching. Every day that passes
Ivery is sending out the worst kind of poison. The Boche is blowing
up for a big campaign in the field, and a big effort to shake
the nerve and confuse the judgement of our civilians. The whole
earth’s war-weary, and we’ve about reached the danger-point. There’s
pretty big stakes hang on you, Dick, for things are getting mighty
delicate."</p>

<p>I purchased a new novel in the shop and reached St Pancras in
time to have a cup of tea at the buffet. Ivery was at the bookstall
buying an evening paper. When we got into the carriage he seized
my <em>Punch</em> and kept laughing and calling my attention to
the pictures. As I looked at him, I thought that he made a perfect
picture of the citizen turned countryman, going back of an evening
to his innocent home. Everything was right—his neat tweeds, his
light spats, his spotted neckcloth, and his aquascutum.</p>

<p>Not that I dared look at him much. What I had learned made me
eager to search his face, but I did not dare show any increased
interest. I had always been a little off-hand with him, for I
had never much liked him, so I had to keep on the same manner.
He was as merry as a grig, full of chat and very friendly and
amusing. I remember he picked up the book I had brought off that
morning to read in the train—the second volume of Hazlitt’s <em>Essays</em>,
the last of my English classics—and discoursed so wisely about
books that I wished I had spent more time in his company at Biggleswick.</p>

<p>"Hazlitt was the academic Radical of his day," he said. "He is
always lashing himself into a state of theoretical fury over abuses
he has never encountered in person. Men who are up against the
real thing save their breath for action."</p>

<p>That gave me my cue to tell him about my journey to the North.
I said I had learned a lot in Biggleswick, but I wanted to see
industrial life at close quarters. "Otherwise I might become like
Hazlitt," I said.</p>

<p>He was very interested and encouraging. "That’s the right way
to set about it," he said. "Where were you thinking of going?"</p>

<p>I told him that I had half thought of Barrow, but decided to
try Glasgow, since the Clyde seemed to be a warm corner.</p>

<p>"Right," he said. "I only wish I was coming with you. It’ll take
you a little while to understand the language. You’ll find a good
deal of senseless bellicosity among the workmen, for they’ve got
parrot-cries about the war as they used to have parrot-cries about
their labour politics. But there’s plenty of shrewd brains and
sound hearts too. You must write and tell me your conclusions."</p>

<p>It was a warm evening and he dozed the last part of the journey.
I looked at him and wished I could see into the mind at the back
of that mask-like face. I counted for nothing in his eyes, not
even enough for him to want to make me a tool, and I was setting
out to try to make a tool of him. It sounded a forlorn enterprise.
And all the while I was puzzled with a persistent sense of recognition.
I told myself it was idiocy, for a man with a face like that must
have hints of resemblance to a thousand people. But the idea kept
nagging at me till we reached our destination.</p>

<p>As we emerged from the station into the golden evening I saw
Mary Lamington again. She was with one of the Weekes girls, and
after the Biggleswick fashion was bareheaded, so that the sun
glinted from her hair. Ivery swept his hat off and made her a
pretty speech, while I faced her steady eyes with the expressionlessness
of the stage conspirator.</p>

<p>"A charming child," he observed as we passed on. "Not without
a touch of seriousness, too, which may yet be touched to noble
issues."</p>

<p>I considered, as I made my way to my final supper with the Jimsons,
that the said child was likely to prove a sufficiently serious
business for Mr Moxon Ivery before the game was out.</p>
