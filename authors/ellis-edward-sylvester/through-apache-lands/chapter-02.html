<p>Hardynge was too skillful a hunter to place himself directly
in the way of the Apache whom he knew to be the most treacherous
kind of an enemy. His purpose was to indulge in a little strategy
and to seek to outwit the redskin, as he had done on many an occasion
before. It required but a second for him to slide his rifle over
upon his back, the stock being hastily wrapped with a leathern
sheath, which he always carried for such an emergency, when he
gently let himself over the stern of the canoe, taking care to
make no splash or noise in doing so. He then permitted his body
with the exception of his head to sink entirely beneath the surface,
while he floated with the boat, lying in such a position that
he made it effectually screen him from the view of any one who
might be upon the bank above. It was hardly to be expected, however,
that if the Indian saw the boat, he would permit it to pass unquestioned.
Tom did not anticipate it, and he was prepared for that which
followed. For several minutes the most perfect silence prevailed.
At the end of that time, the scout knew that he was exactly beneath
the spot whereon he had seen the answering signal, and scarcely
stirred a muscle, keeping his head as close as possible to the
boat, and so nearly submerged, that he could scarcely breathe.</p>

<p>"Hooh! hooh!"</p>

<p>The Apache had noted the empty canoe drifting below him in the
shadow, and surveyed it with something of the feeling of the detective
who suddenly stumbles upon a clue, the precise meaning of which
is at first a mystery to him.</p>

<p>It is hardly to be supposed that he intended this outcry as a
hail to the boat, which he must have seen contained no one. Its
appearance would naturally suggest to one in his situation that
the occupant had been alarmed by the signs of danger and had taken
to the land. This supposition was so natural that Hardynge would
probably have got safely by the dangerous point but for a totally
unlooked-for mishap. The water, which up to this time had been
fully six feet in depth, suddenly shallowed to less than a quarter
of that, so that he struck his knees against the bottom. The shock
was very slight, and scarcely caused a ripple; but it takes only
the slightest noise to alarm an Indian, especially when he is
on the watch. That faint plash caused by the jar of the body caught
the ear of the listening, peering redskin, who instantly slid
his body over the bluff, and balancing himself for an instant,
dropped with such precision that he struck the canoe in the very
center, and preserved its gravity so well that it tipped neither
to the right nor left.</p>

<p>At the very moment the Apache dropped, the hunter rose to his
feet, knife in hand. The water rose scarcely to his knees, and
the bottom was hard, so that it was almost the same as if he stood
upon dry land. The warrior had not time to recover from the slight
shock of his leap, when Tom grasped him by the throat and used
his weapon with such effect that it was all over in a few seconds.</p>

<p>"There! I reckon you won't go into the telegraph business again
very soon!" he growled, as the inanimate body disappeared down
the stream, and he coolly re-entered the canoe, which had floated
but a short distance away.</p>

<p>He had scarcely done this when a new idea struck him, and, hastening
after the receding body, he carefully drew it into the boat again.
Here it was the work of but a few minutes to place it in a sitting
position in the stern in the most natural posture imaginable,
so that any one looking upon the figure would not have suspected
for an instant that it was anything but an animate being. Making
sure that its pose could not be improved, the scout then turned
the boat directly away from the bank, never changing its course
until the very middle of the Gila was reached, when he began paddling
in as leisurely a manner as if no danger threatened. It was a
daring stratagem, but it is only by such means that men are enabled
to escape from peril, and although fully aware of the danger he
was incurring, he kept on his way with that coolness that years
of experience had given him.</p>

<p>As he approached a point opposite that where he had seen the
first signal he did not turn his head, but he looked sideways
and scanned the bank with the most searching scrutiny. Sure enough,
at this moment he plainly discerned the figures of fully a half-dozen
Indians standing upon the bluff and apparently watching the canoe
with a curiosity that was natural.</p>

<p>"All right," thought the hunter; "so long as you let me alone
I won't hurt you."</p>

<p>Had there been but the single occupant of the canoe the Apaches
would not have stood debating in this fashion as to what they
should do, if, indeed, they should do anything at all. Unity in
the question would have shown that it was the identical individual
for whom they were searching, for they knew that he was alone;
but the fact that there were two, and both in the guise of Indians,
could be explained upon no other hypothesis than that they were
really what they seemed to be.</p>

<p>"Hooh! Hooh!"</p>

<p>It was precisely the same exclamation which had been uttered
by the warrior who sat so cold and inanimate in the stern of the
canoe, and Tom, without the least hesitancy, ceased paddling for
the instant, straightened up, and responded in the same gutteral
fashion, resuming the use of the oar at the same time, as if he
meant that that should be the end of it. But the Apaches immediately
followed up their ejaculations with some other sounds, which were
doubtless intended as a summons for the craft to heave to and
"show her papers." Tom did not understand the Apache tongue well
enough to comprehend the precise meaning of these words, although
he was pretty well convinced of what the others were driving at.
He did not dare to attempt to reply, nor did he dare to move faster;
so he did the only dignified thing possible under the circumstances.
He continued that automatic paddling, and, assisted by the current,
was rapidly leaving his enemies in the rear when they called to
him again, moving at the same time down the bank in a fashion
which showed that they meant business. The hunter, not yet ready
to make the desperate dash which he had reserved for the last
final effort, if he should be driven to the wall, ceased work
again and called out:</p>

<p>"Hooh!"</p>

<p>He said it as impatiently as he could in the hope of "cutting
off further debate," and resumed paddling, knowing that a comparatively
short distance down the river the banks were so depressed that
he could readily make his way from the boat to the land, so that
after getting fairly below the Apaches his chances of ultimate
escape were greatly increased.</p>

<p>The Indians must have been exasperated at the refusal, for Tom
had taken scarcely a dozen strokes when he saw the flash of several
guns upon the bank, and the whizzing of the bullets around his
head left no doubt of the target at which they aimed.</p>

<p>"I can do somethin' of that myself," growled the hunter, as he
laid down his paddle and took up his gun.</p>

<p>Without the least hesitation, he fired directly into the group,
and the wild cry that instantly followed told with what a fatal
result also. All diplomacy was ended by this act, and without
pausing to reload his piece, he dropped his gun and bent to the
task. The long ashen paddle was dipped deep into the water, and
the light vessel shot like an arrow down stream. It seemed, indeed,
to be imbued with life, and fairly skimmed over the surface. The
unexpected and defiant response to the summons of the Apaches
threw them into temporary bewilderment, and the minutes thus lost
to them were golden ones gained to the fugitive, who shot the
canoe as close to the opposite shore as was prudent, and wielded
the paddle with the skill of a veteran.</p>

<p>Having now no need of the dummy that had stood him so well for
the time, Tom did not hesitate to throw him overboard as a useless
incumbrance, and, thus relieved of the dead weight, he sped forward
with wonderful speed. In a short time after that the redskins
had vanished from view, and almost any one would have supposed
that the danger was passed; but Tom was well aware that it was
only a temporary lull in the storm. The Apaches were like bloodhounds,
who, having once taken the trail of their prey, would relax no
effort so long as there was a chance of capturing him, and so
he abated not a jot of his tremendous exertions.</p>
