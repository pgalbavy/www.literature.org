<p>IT <em>WAS </em>late in the afternoon when the explosion occurred,
and it was just beginning to grow dark when the three friends
began drifting down the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>This fact was greatly in their favor, although there remained
an hour or two of great danger, in case the Indians made any search
for them. In case of discovery, there was hardly an earthly chance
for escape.</p>

<p>The log or raft, as it might be termed, had floated very quietly
down-stream for about half an hour, when the wonderfully acute
ears of the trapper detected danger.</p>

<p>'Thar be some of the skunks that are creep-in 'long shore,' said
he; 'you'd better run in under this yar tree and hold fast awhile.'</p>

<p>The warning was heeded. Just below them, the luxuriant branches
of an oak, dipped in the current, formed an impenetrable screen.
As the log, guided thither, floated beneath this, Mickey and Ethan
both caught hold of the branches and held themselves motionless.</p>

<p>'Now wait till it's dark, and then thar'll be no fear of the
varmints,' added the trapper.</p>

<p>''Sh! I haars sumfin'!' whispered the Irishman</p>

<p>'What is it?' asked Ethan.</p>

<p>'How does I know till yees kaaps still?'</p>

<p>'It's the reds goin' long the banks,' said the trapper.</p>

<p>The words were yet in his mouth, when the voice of one Indian
was heard calling to another. Neither Mickey nor Ethan had the
remotest idea of the meaning of the words uttered, but the trapper
told them that they were inquiring of each other whether anything
had been discovered of more fugitives. The answer being in the
negative, our friends considered their present position safe.</p>

<p>When it was fairly dark, and nothing more was seen or heard of
the Indians, the raft was permitted to float free, and they drifted
with the current. They kept the river until daylight, when, having
been in the water so long, they concluded it best to land and
rest themselves. By the aid of their revolvers they succeeded
in' kindling a fire, the warmth of which proved exceedingly grateful
to all.</p>

<p>They would have had a very rough time had they not encountered
a party of hunters who accompanied them to St. Louis, where the
trapper had friends, and where, also, he had a good sum of money
in the bank.</p>

<p>Here Baldy remained all winter, before he entirely recovered
from the hurt which he received during the explosion and sinking
of the steamer. When the Irishman and Yankee were about to depart,
he asked them where they were going.</p>

<p>'I'm goin' home in Connecticut and goin' to work on the farm,
and that's where I'm goin' to stay. I was a fool ever to leave
it for this confounded place. I could live decent put there, and
that's more than I can do in this blamed country.'</p>

<p>'And I shall go back to work on the Erie railroad, at thirty-siven
cents a day and boord myself,' replied the Irishman.</p>

<p>'If yer were sartin of findin' all the gold yor want, would yer
go back to Califony?''</p>

<p>'Arrah. Now, what are yees talkin' about?' asked McSquizzle,
somewhat impatiently. 'What is the good of talkin'?'</p>

<p>'I didn't ax yer to fool with yer,' replied the trapper, 'thar's
a place that I know away out West, that I call Wolf Ravine, whar
thar's enough gold to make both of yer richer than yer ever war
afore, and then leave some for yer children.'</p>

<p>'Jerusalem! but you're a lucky dog!' exclaimed Ethan Hopkins,
not daring to hope that he would reveal the place. 'Why don't
you dig it up naow, yourself?'</p>

<p>'I only found it a month ago, and I made a purty good haul of
it, as it was. When that old boss of mine went down with the steamer,
he carried a powerful heft of gold with him, and if anybody finds
his carcass, it'll be the most vallyable one they ever come across.'</p>

<p>'Jingo! if I'd know'd that, I'd taken a hunt for him myself.'</p>

<p>'Howsumever, that's neither yar nor thar. You both done me a
good turn when I got into trouble on the river, and I mud' up
my mind to do what I could toward payin' it back the first chance
I got. I didn't say nothin' of it when we was on our way, 'cause
I was afeard it would make you too crazy to go back ag'in: but
if you'll come back this way next spring I'll make the trip with
you.'</p>

<p>'Why not go naow?' eagerly inquired Hopkins.</p>

<p>'It's too late in the season. I don't want to be thar when thar's
too much snow onto the ground, and then I must stay yar till I
git well over that whack I got on the boat.'</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the offer of the kind-hearted
trapper was accepted with the utmost enthusiasm. Mickey and Ethan
were more anxious to go out upon the prairies than they had been
a year and a half before, when they started so full of fife and
hope for that vast wilderness, and had come back with such discouragement
and disgust.</p>

<p>It was arranged that as soon as the succeeding spring had fairly
set in, they would set out on their return for St. Louis, where
the trapper would meet and accompany them to the wonderful gold
region of which he had spoken.</p>

<p>Before continuing their journey homeward, Baldy presented each
with a complete outfit, paid their passage to their homes, and
gave them a snug sum over. Like the Indian, he never could forget
a kindness shown him, nor do too great a favor to those who had
so signally benefited him.</p>

<p>So the separation took place again; and, on the following spring
Mickey and Ethan appeared in St. Louis, where they had no difficulty
in finding their old friend, the trapper.</p>

<p>He had recovered entirely from his prostrating blow, and was
expecting them, anxious and glad to join in the promised search
for gold. As the fair weather had really begun, there was no time
lost in unnecessary delay. The purse of Baldy Bicknell was deep,
and he had not the common habit of intoxication, which takes so
much substance from a man. He purchased a horse and accouterments
for each of his friends; and, before they started westward, saw
that nothing at all was lacking in their outfit.</p>

<p>Three weeks later the men drew rein in a tort of valley, very
deep but not very wide. It was on the edge of an immense prairie,
while a river of considerable size flowed by the rear, and by
a curious circuit found its way into the lower portion of the
ravine, dashing and roaring forward in a furious canyon.</p>

<p>The edge and interior of the ravine was lined with immense bowlders
and rocks, while large and stunted trees seemed to grow everywhere.</p>

<p>'Yar's what I call Wolf Ravine,' said Baldy when they had spent
some time in looking; about them.</p>

<p>'And be the same towken, where is the goold?' inquired Mickey.</p>

<p>'Yes, that there is what I call the important question,' added
Ethan.</p>

<p>'That it is, of the greatest account, as me grandmither observed,
whin she fell off the staaple, and axed whether her pipe was broke.'</p>

<p>'It's in thar,' was the reply of the hunter, as he pointed to
the wildest-looking portion of the ravine.</p>

<p>'Let's geit it then.'</p>

<p>'Thar be some other things that have got to be looked after first,'
was the reply, 'and we've got to find a place to stow ourselves
away.'</p>

<p>This was a matter of considerable difficulty: but they succeeded
at last in discovering a retreat in the rocks, where they were
secure from any attack, no matter by how formidable a number made.</p>

<p>After this, they hunted up a grazing place for their animals,
which were turned loose.</p>

<p>They soon found that the trapper had not deceived them. There
was an unusually rich deposit of gold in one portion of the ravine,
and the men fell to work with a will, conscious that they would
reap a rich reward for their labor.</p>

<p>The name, Wolf Ravine, had been given to it by the trapper, because
on his first discovery of it he had shot a large mountain wolf,
that was clambering up the side; but none others were seen afterward.</p>

<p>But there was one serious drawback to this brilliant prospect
of wealth. Indians of the most treacherous and implacable kind
were all around them, and were by no means disposed to-let them
alone.</p>

<p>On the second day after their labor, a horde of them came screeching
down upon them; and had it not been for the safe retreat, which
the trapper's foresight had secured, all three would have been
massacred.</p>

<p>As it was, they had a severe fight, and were penned up for the
better part of two days, by which time they had slain too many
of their enemies that the remaining ones were glad to withdraw.</p>

<p>But when the trapper stole out on a visit to his horses he found
that every one had been completely riddled by balls. The treacherous
dogs had taken every means of revenge at hand.</p>

<p>'Skin me fur a skunk, but we've stood this long as we ought to!'
exclaimed Baldy Bicknell, when he returned. 'You take care of
yourselves till I come back again!'</p>

<p>With which speech he slung his rifle over his shoulder and started
for St. Louis. </p>
