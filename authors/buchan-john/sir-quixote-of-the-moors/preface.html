<p>The narrative, now for the first time presented to the world,
was written by the Sieur de Rohaine to while away the time during
the long period and painful captivity, borne with heroic resolution,
which preceded his death. He chose the English tongue, in which
he was extraordinarily proficient, for two reasons: first, as
an exercise in the language; second, because he desired to keep
the passages here recorded from the knowledge of certain of his
kins-folk in France. Few changes have been made in his work. Now
and then an English idiom has been substituted for a French; certain
tortuous expressions have been emended; and in general the portions
in the Scots dialect have been rewritten, since the author's knowledge
of this manner of speech seems scarcely to have been so great
as he himself thought.</p>
