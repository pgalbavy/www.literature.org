<P>
In the middle of that night Hamel sat up in bed, awakened with a
sudden start by some sound, only the faintest echo of which remained
in his consciousness.   His nerves were tingling with a sense of
excitement.  He sat up in bed and listened.  Suddenly it came again
- a long, low moan of pain, stifled at the end as though repressed
by some outside agency.  He leaped from his bed, hurried on a few
clothes, and stepped out on to the landing.  The cry had seemed
to him to come from the further end of the long corridor - in the
direction, indeed, of the room where Mr. Dunster lay.  He made his
way there, walking on tiptoe, although his feet fell noiselessly
upon the thick carpet.  A single light was burning from a bracket
in the wall, insufficient to illuminate the empty spaces, but enough
to keep him from stumbling.  The corridor towards the south end
gradually widened, terminating in a splendid high window with
stained glass, a broad seat, and a table.  On the right, the end
room was Mr. Dunster's apartment, and on the left a flight of
stairs led to the floor above.  Hamel stood quite still, listening.
There was a light in the room, as he could see from under the door,
but there was no sound of any one moving.  Hamel listened intently,
every sense strained.  Then the sound of a stair creaking behind
diverted his attention.  He looked quickly around.  Gerald was
descending.  The boy's face was white, and his eyes were filled
with fear.  Hamel stepped softly back from the door and met him at
the foot of the stairs.
<P>
"Did you hear that cry?" he whispered.
<P>
Gerald nodded.
<P>
"It woke me up.  What do you suppose it was?"  Hamel shook his head.
<P>
"Some one in pain," he replied.  "I don't understand it.  It came
from this room."
<P>
"You know who sleeps there?" Gerald asked hoarsely.
<P>
Hamel nodded.
<P>
"A man with concussion of the brain doesn't cry out like that.
Besides, did you hear the end of it?   It sounded as though some one
were choking him.  Hush!"
<P>
They had spoken only in bated breath, but the door of the room
before which they were standing was suddenly opened.  Meekins stood
there, fully dressed, his dark, heavy face full of somber warning.
He started a little as he saw the two whispering together.  Gerald
addressed him almost apologetically. 
<P>
"We both heard the same sound, Meekins.  Is any one ill?   It sounded
like some one in pain."
<P>
The man hesitated.  Then from behind his shoulder came Mr.
Fentolin's still, soft voice.  There was a little click, and Meekins,
as though obeying an unseen gesture, stepped back.  Mr. Fentolin
glided on to the threshold.  He was still dressed.  He propelled his
chair a few yards down the corridor and beckoned them to approach.
<P>
"I am so sorry," he said softly, "that you should have been
disturbed, Mr. Hamel.  We have been a little anxious about our
mysterious guest.  Doctor Sarson fetched me an hour ago.  He
discovered that it was necessary to perform a very slight operation,
merely the extraction of a splinter of wood.  It is all over now,
and I think that he will do very well."
<P>
Notwithstanding this very plausible explanation, Hamel was conscious
of the remains of an uneasiness which he scarcely knew how to put
into words.
<P>
"It was a most distressing cry," he observed doubtfully, "a cry of
fear as well as of pain."
<P>
"Poor fellow!" Mr. Fentolin remarked compassionately.  "I am afraid
that for a moment or two he must have suffered acutely.  Doctor
Sarson is very clever, however, and there is no doubt that what
he did was for the best.  His opinion is that by to-morrow morning
there will be a marvellous change.  Good night, Mr. Hamel.  I am
quite sure that you will not be disturbed again."
<P>
Hamel neither felt nor showed any disposition to depart.
<P>
"Mr. Fentolin," he said, "I hope that you will not think that I am
officious or in any way abusing your hospitality, but I cannot help
suggesting that as Dr. Sarson is purely your household physician,
the relatives of this man Dunster might be better satisfied if some
second opinion were called in.  Might I suggest that you telephone
to Norwich for a surgeon?"
<P>
Mr. Fentolin showed no signs of displeasure.  He was silent for a
moment, as though considering the matter.
<P>
"I am not at all sure, Mr. Hamel, that you are not right," he
admitted frankly.  "I believe that the case is quite a simple one,
but on the other hand it would perhaps be more satisfactory to have
an outside opinion.  If Mr. Dunster is not conscious in the morning,
we will telephone to the Norwich Infirmary."
<P>
"I think it would be advisable," Hamel agreed.
<P>
"Good night!" Mr. Fentolin said once more.  I am sorry that your 
rest has been disturbed."
<P>
Hamel, however, still refused to take the hint.  His eyes were fixed
upon that closed door.
<P>
"Mr. Fentolin," he asked, "have you any objection to my seeing Mr.
Dunster?"
<P>
There was a moment's intense silence.  A sudden light had burned in
Mr. Fentolin's eyes.  His fingers gripped the side of his chair.
Yet when he spoke there were no signs of anger in his tone.  It was
a marvellous effort of self-control.
<P>
"There is no reason, Mr. Hamel," he said, "why your curiosity should
not be gratified.  Knock softly at the door, Gerald."
<P>
The boy obeyed.  In a moment or two Doctor Sarson appeared on the
threshold.
<P>
"Our guest, Mr. Hamel," Mr. Fentolin explained in a whisper, "has
been awakened by this poor fellow's cry.  He would like to see him
for a moment."
<P>
Doctor Sarson opened the door.  They all passed in on tiptoe.  The
doctor led the way towards the bed upon which Mr. Dunster was lying,
quite still.  His head was bandaged, and his eyes closed.  His face
was ghastly.  Gerald gave vent to a little muttered exclamation.
Mr. Fentolin turned to him. quickly.
<P>
"Gerald!"
<P>
The boy stood still, trembling, speechless.  Mr. Fentolin's eyes
were riveted upon him.  The doctor was standing, still and dark, a
motionless image.
<P>
"Is he asleep?" Hamel asked.
<P>
"He is under the influence of a mild anaesthetic," Doctor Sarson
explained.  "He is doing very well.  His case is quite simple.  By
to-morrow morning he will be able to sit up and walk about if he
wishes to."
<P>
Hamel looked steadily at the figure upon the bed.  Mr. Dunster's
breathing was regular, and his eyes were closed, but his colour was
ghastly.
<P>
"He doesn't look like getting up for a good many days to come,"
Hamel observed.
<P>
The doctor led the way towards the door.
<P>
"The man has a fine constitution," he said.  "I feel sure that if
you wish you will be able to talk to him to-morrow."
<P>
They separated outside in the passage.  Mr. Fentolin bade his guest
a somewhat restrained good night, and Gerald mounted the staircase
to his room.  Hamel, however, had scarcely reached his door before
Gerald reappeared.  He had descended the stair-case at the other
end of the corridor.  He stood for a moment looking down the passage.
The doors were all closed.  Even the light had been extinguished.
<P>
"May I come in for a moment, please?" he whispered.
<P>
Hamel nodded.
<P>
"With pleasure!  Come in and have a cigarette if you will.  I shan't
feel like sleep for some time."
<P>
They entered the room, and Gerald threw himself into an easy-chair
near the window.  Hamel wheeled up another chair and produced a box
of cigarettes.
<P>
"Queer thing your dropping across that fellow in the way you did,"
he remarked.  "Just shows how one may disappear from the world
altogether, and no one be a bit the wiser."
<P>
The boy was sitting with folded arms.  His expression was one of
deep gloom.
<P>
"I only wish I'd never brought him here," he muttered.  "I ought
to have known better."
<P>
Hamel raised his eyebrows.  "Isn't he as well off here as anywhere
else?"
<P>
"Do you think that he is?" Gerald demanded, looking across at Hamel.
<P>
There was a brief silence.
<P>
"We can scarcely do your uncle the injustice," Hamel remarked, "of
imagining that he can possibly have any reason or any desire to deal
with that man except as a guest."
<P>
"Do you really believe that?" Gerald asked.
<P>
Hamel rose to his feet.
<P>
"Look here, young man," he said, "this is getting serious.  You and
I are at cross-purposes.  If you like, you shall have the truth
from me."
<P>
"Go on."
<P>
"I was warned about your uncle before I came down into this part of
the world," Hamel continued quietly.  "I was told that he is a
dangerous conspirator, a man who sticks at nothing to gain his ends,
a person altogether out of place in these days.  It sounds
melodramatic, but I had it straight from a friend.  Since I have
been here, I have had a telegram - you brought it to me yourself
- asking for information about this man Dunster.  It was I who wired
to London that he was here.  It was through me that Scotland Yard
communicated with the police station at Wells, through me that a
man is to be sent down from London.  I didn't come here as a spy
- don't think that; I was coming here, anyhow.  On the other hand,
I believe that your uncle is playing a dangerous game.  I am going
to have Mr. John P. Dunster put in charge of a Norwich physician
to-morrow."
<P>
"Thank God!" the boy murmured.
<P>
"Look here," Hamel continued, "what are you doing in this business,
anyway?  You are old enough to know your own mind and to go your
own way."
<P>
"You say that because you don't know," Gerald declared bitterly.
<P>
"In a sense I don't," Hamel admitted, "and yet your sister hinted
to me only this afternoon that you and she -"
<P>
"Oh, I know what she told you!" the boy interrupted.  "We've worn
the chains for the last eight years.  They are breaking her.
They've broken my mother.  Sometimes I think they are breaking me.
But, you know, there comes a time - there comes a time when one
can't go on.  I've seen some strange things here, some that I've
half understood, some that I haven't understood at all.  I've closed
my eyes.  I've kept my promise.  I've done his bidding, where ever
it has led me.  But you know there is a time - there is a limit to
all things.  I can't go on.  I spied on this man Dunster.  I brought
him here.  It is I who am responsible for anything that may happen to
him.  It's the last time!"
<P>
Gerald's face was white with pain.  Hamel laid his hand upon his
shoulder.
<P>
"My boy," he said, "there are worse things in the world than
breaking a promise.  When you gave it, the conditions which were
existing at the time made it, perhaps, a right and reasonable
undertaking, but sometimes the whole of the conditions under which
a promise was given, change.  Then one must have courage enough to
be false even to one's word."
<P>
"Have you talked to my sister like that?" Gerald asked eagerly.
<P>
"I have and I will again," Hamel declared.  "To-morrow morning I
leave this house, but before I go I mean to have the affair of this
man Dunster cleared up.  Your uncle will be very angry with me,
without a doubt.  I don't care.  But I do want you to trust me, if
you will, and your sister.  I should like to be your friend."
<P>
"God knows we need one!" the boy said simply.  "Good night!"
<P>
Once more the house was quiet.  Hamel pushed his window wide open
and looked out into the night.  The air was absolutely still, there
was no wind.  The only sound was the falling of the low waves upon
the stony beach and the faint scrunching of the pebbles drawn back
by the ebb.  He looked along the row of windows, all dark and silent
now.  A rush of pleasant fancies suddenly chased away the grim
depression of the last few minutes.  Out of all this sordidness and
mystery there remained at least something in life for him to do.  A
certain aimlessnessn of purpose which had troubled him during the
last few months had disappeared.  He had found an object in life.
