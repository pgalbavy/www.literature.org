<p>Let us be just to all. I therefore make haste to say that when
Kit Woodford thus threw Mike Murphy into the Back River he did
not doubt for an instant that he was a swimmer, for whoever heard
of a lusty youth seventeen years old who could not take care of
himself in water? Of course there are such, but they are so few
that they are a negligible number.</p>

<p>Graff Miller was startled when he heard the splash, and turning
his head saw the lad disappear, but his belief was the same as
his companion's, and turning on more power, he shot beyond sight
before the lad could come to the surface.</p>

<p>Now I wish to say further that it is a fact within the knowledge
of more than one that a person who did not know how to swim has,
upon being precipitated into deep water, struck out like a master
of the natatorial art. A father standing on the shore of a lake
in northern England saw a boat upset when a hundred yards off
and his little boy flung clear of the support. The lad had never
even tried to swim, but as he was going down the parent shouted
to him:</p>

<p>"If you don't come right to land, I'll whip you within an inch
of your life!"</p>

<p>And the little fellow swam to where the frantic parent awaited
him.</p>

<p>Moreover, I once witnessed the same strange occurrence. I was
not six years old when I was waiting at the side of a deep pond,
and watching my brother, four years older, construct a raft, with
which he had promised to come over and take me a-sailing. He put
a number of boards loosely together, and using a shingle for a
paddle, worked out from shore and began making his way toward
me, who was in high spirits over the promised treat.</p>

<p>In the very middle of the pond, where the water was fully twenty
feet deep, the primitive raft began disintegrating. The boards
slipped apart, so that those upon which my brother stood sank
under his weight. Had he been older and more sensible, he would
have known that this need not mean danger to him, for the smallest
board was buoyant enough to hold his head above water, and he
could have worked his way to land with such support. But the sight
of the structure breaking apart threw him into a panic. He made
a frenzied leap as far out as he could, came up instantly, blew
the water from his mouth and swam so easily to where I was standing
that I never dreamed he was in peril. I should have said that
never before had he tried to swim.</p>

<p>The explanation of what seems unaccountable is simple. Now and
then it happens that when a sudden demand is made upon a person
to save his life by swimming he instinctively does the right thing.
He adjusts his body correctly, and uses his legs and arms properly&mdash;his
action being exactly like those of a bullfrog when he starts on
a voyage to the other side of the spring where he makes his home.</p>

<p>This thing does not often occur, but, as I have said, it does
now and then. Let me beg you never to make the experiment unless
it is forced upon you, for I dread what the result would be.</p>

<p>You have already guessed that this is what took place with Mike
Murphy. I cannot think of a more startling awaking than that of
a sleeping person who is flung into a deep stream of very cold
water. Mike's momentum took him several feet below the surface,
but he quickly rose again, shook the water from his eyes, blew
it out of his mouth, and then swam straight for land with the
skill that you would show in a similar situation. Even in taking
the right direction he was providentially guided, for at first
the dense fog shut everything from sight, but after a few strokes,
he saw the dim outlines of the trees, and never stopped the vigorous
swimming until he reached up, grasped an overhanging limb of a
near-by tree and felt his feet touch bottom.</p>

<p>And then he was so overcome by what had taken place and it was
so beyond his comprehension that he believed it was a miracle.
Standing on the bank in his dripping clothing, he was mute for
a full minute. Then he sank on his knees and looking reverently
upward said:</p>

<p>"I thank Thee, my Heavenly Father, for saving me life when I
didn't desarve it. Why Ye took the trouble is beyond me, but I
niver can thank Thee enough. I'm going to try me bist to be more
desarving of Yer kindness, and now if it's all the same to Yer
blissed silf, plaise give me a chance at that spalpeen that treated
me as he did."</p>

<p>From down the river came the sound of the <em>Deerfoot's</em>
exhaust, growing fainter as the boat sped on its way. The hoarse
blast of a steamer's whistle shuddered through the mist, but the
lad saw nothing of either craft. It was fog, fog on every hand.</p>

<p>He could not straighten out in his mind all that had taken place.
More than one phase of the occurrences was beyond explanation.
Overcoming in a degree the awe he felt for what had occurred in
his own person, he thought:</p>

<p>"If the Captain and second mate didn't know I couldn't swim,
I'd belave it was them that dropped me overboard by way of a joke,
as the Barry brithers explained to the Judge was their raison
for hanging Black Mike. It was thim spalpeens that wint fur the
Captain whin he was journeying through the woods. Begorra! but
they are piling up a big debt fur me to pay! But I'll sittle the
same wid int'rist at siven thousand per cent.</p>

<p>"Where's Alvin and Chester all this time? Why didn't they git
to the <em>Deerfut</em> before me instead of laving it fur them
chaps? What does it all maan, anyway?"</p>

<p>One of the singular coincidences of this series of adventures
was that the <em>Deerfoot</em> in going down the Back River passed
within a few rods of the <em>Water Witch</em> coming up. The noise
of the respective engines prevented either party hearing the other,
and the fog would have veiled them had the space between been
considerably less.</p>

<p>Not knowing that the launch of their enemies had been moored
anywhere near, Mike did not look for it. Ignorant also of how
far he had been carried while asleep, he could not guess the distance
to Beartown landing. It might be half a mile or ten times as much.
In truth, the former distance was about right.</p>

<p>The pressing question was as to what he should do. His clothing
even to his cap was saturated. The morning was chilly, and he
shivered. He must find a place where he could obtain warmth until
his garments dried. When that was done he would decide upon the
next step to take.</p>

<p>Had he suspected that he was so close to the landing, he would
have picked his way thither and then followed the road to the
home of Mrs. Friestone. It seemed to him that there must be a
good many scattered houses, any one of which would give him welcome.
He remembered that a broad highway runs the whole length of big
Westport Island. Necessarily this was parallel with the course
of Back River. If he therefore turned away from the latter and
held a direct course, he must sooner or later reach the road named,
where he would be sure soon to receive hospitality.</p>

<p>No doubt you know from experience how hard it is to hold a straight
course when going through a wilderness, without landmarks to guide
you and ignorant also of the "signs" which are as plain as print
to the veteran hunter. The fog inclosed Mike on every hand, but
his activity imparted a pleasant warmth to his frame, which otherwise
would not have been felt, even though it was summer time.</p>

<p>He zigzagged sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left,
but, on the whole, held substantially to the right direction and
gradually drew near the dusty avenue which, once reached, would
bring the end of his discomforts. Good fortune stayed with him,
for when he was beginning to feel somewhat discouraged with his
failure to free himself from the dripping woods, he abruptly came
upon a clearing, in the midst of which stood a small house, surrounded
by a well-tilled garden and several smaller buildings. Chickens
were scratching and picking at the earth, and a big dog, fortunately
restrained by a chain, scrambled out of his kennel at sight of
the stranger and barked and tugged to get at him.</p>

<p>Between him and Mike stretched a clothesline supported at intervals
by leaning props, and despite the fact that the humidity in the
air must have been close to ninety-nine degrees, a corpulent woman
was hanging out clothes. Two or three wooden pins were in her
mouth, and every now and then she reached up with one hand and
squeezed the little conveniences over the cord which supported
the flapping clothes. She wore no bonnet or hat, and the untied
shoes evidently were an old pair belonging to her husband.</p>

<p>Hearing the dog bark, she looked around to learn the cause. She
saw a freckle-faced youth in the act of doffing his cap and bowing.</p>

<p>"The top of the morning to yer ladyship, and would ye be willing
to hang me across yer line till me clothes be dried?"</p>

<p>The woman snatched the pins from between her teeth and stared
at him. Her face was broad, homely and good-natured.</p>

<p>"G'way now," she answered; "I don't hang up any clothes till
the same is <em>claan</em>. It will take a waak's washing to rinder
ye fit. If I straddle ye over the line wid yer faat and rid head
hanging down and bumping togither, ye'll cut a purty figger a-flapping
in the wind."</p>

<p>Mike's laughter rang out. She was Irish like him and his heart
warmed to her.</p>

<p>"Begorra! I've met a leddy after me own heart. She's from the
'owld sod' and it's not mesilf that is going to have me own way
in gay conversation wid the charming beauty."</p>

<p>True enough, the woman was his match and Mike was glad to learn
it.</p>
