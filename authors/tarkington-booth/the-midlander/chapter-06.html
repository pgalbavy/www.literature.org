<p><em>THAT </em>green bronze swan of the fountain in the broad
yard next door to the Oliphants’ should have been given a new
interpretation this season; the open beak, forever addressing
itself obliquely to the eastern sky, might well have been thought
to complain to heaven of the spiteful hanging on of winter. It
was a winter that long outwore its welcome, and then kept returning
like a quarrelsome guest forcing his way back to renew argument
after repeated ejectments;—the Shelbys’ swan was fortunate to
be of bronze, for a wet snow filled that exasperated-looking beak
of his choke-full one morning a month after the lilacs had shown
green buds along their stems. Then, adding mockery to assault,
this grotesque weather spent hour after hour patiently constructing
a long goatee of ice upon the helpless bird.</p>

<p>Martha Shelby knocked it off late in the afternoon, though by
that time the western sun had begun to make all icicles into opals,
radiant with frozen fire and beautiful. "Insulting thing!" Martha
said, as she brought the ferrule of her umbrella resentfully against
the icicle, which broke into pieces that clattered lightly down
to the stone basin below. "Of all the Smart Alecks I ever knew
I think the worst one’s the weather!"</p>

<p>Her companion, a thin young man with an astrakhan collar to his
skirted long overcoat, assented negligently. He had happened to
overtake her as she walked up National Avenue from downtown, and
was evidently disposed to extend the casual encounter at least
as far as her door, for he went on with her in that direction
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, I dare say. Nature, in general, has a way of taking liberties
with us that we wouldn’t tolerate from our most intimate friends.
I suspect if we got at the truth of things we’d find that most
of our legislation is really an attempt to prevent Nature from
getting the better of us."</p>

<p>"Murder!" said Martha. "That’s too deep for me, Harlan! Let’s
go on talking about poor old Dan and things I can understand.
Come into the house and I’ll give you some tea; you’re the only
man-citizen I know in town who likes tea. I ought to warn you
that papa thinks there’s something queer about you since that
day after the matinée when you came in and had tea with me. He
thought it was bad enough, your being at the matinée—papa says
if an old man is seen at a matinée it looks as if he’s gone bankrupt
and doesn’t care, but if it’s a young man he must be out of a
job and too lazy to look for a new one—and for any man not only
to go to a matinée, but to drink tea afterwards, well, papa was
terribly mystified about anybody named Oliphant doing such a thing!
He can’t imagine a man’s consenting to drink tea except to help
fight off a chill."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know!" Harlan said. "I realize it’s a terrible thing for
one to do, only three generations away from the pioneers."</p>

<p>As Martha chattered she had opened one of the double front doors,
which were unlocked, and now she preceded him into the large central
hall, floored with black and white squares of marble. A fine staircase,
noble in proportions and inevitably of black walnut, followed
a curving upward sweep against curved walls to the third story;
while upon both sides of the hall, broad and lofty doorways, with
massive double doors standing open, invited the caller to apartments
heavily formal in brown velvet and damasks of gold.</p>

<p>In obedience to a casual wave of Martha’s hand, as she disappeared
through a doorway at the other end of the hall, Harlan left his
overcoat and hat upon a baroque gold console-table and entered
the drawing-room to his left. Here a fire of soft coal sought
to enliven a ponderous black-marble mantelpiece, and Harlan, warming
his hands, gazed disapprovingly at the painting hung upon the
heavy paper of the wall above. This painting was not without celebrity,
but after looking at it seriously for several minutes Harlan shook
his head at it, and was caught in the act by Martha, who came
in with a light step behind him.</p>

<p>"Don’t scold the poor thing, Harlan!" she said; and, as he turned,
a little startled, he took note again of a fact he had many times
remarked before: she moved with a noiseless rapidity unusual in
so large a person. Moreover, her quickness was twice in evidence
now; for she had changed her dark cloth dress for a gown of gray
silk; and as final testimony to her celerity, when she sat in
a chair by the fire and crossed her knees, a silken instep of
gray was revealed between the silver buckle of her slipper and
the hem of the long skirt she wore in the mode of that time.</p>

<p>"You’re like lightning, Martha," Harlan said;—"but not like thunder.
I didn’t even hear you come into the room. What is it you don’t
want me to scold?"</p>

<p>"Poor papa’s Corot."</p>

<p>"I wasn’t scolding it. I was only thinking: What’s the use of
having a Corot if you hang it so high and so much against the
dazzle of the firelight that nobody can see it."</p>

<p>"Oh, that doesn’t matter to papa," Martha said cheerfully. "Papa
doesn’t care to see it; and he doesn’t care whether any one else
sees it or not. He bought it the summer the doctor made him go
abroad, after mamma died. Somebody in Paris convinced him he ought
to own an important picture. They took him first to see a Bougereau
and he got very indignant. So they apologized and hurried out
this Corot and told him who Corot was; so he bought it. All he
cares about is that he owns it; he doesn’t think about it as a
thing to <em>look</em> at any more than the bonds in his safety-deposit
boxes. He knows they’re there, and they’re worth just so much,
and they’re his; and that’s all he cares about. You know papa
runs the house to suit himself."</p>

<p>"No," Harlan returned skeptically. "I can’t say I quite know
that."</p>

<p>"You don’t?" She laughed and went on: "Well, he does; especially
when he gets set in his head. A few of papa’s notions are just
molasses, but most of ’em are like plaster of Paris;—if you don’t
change ’em in a hurry before they set you never <em>can</em> change
’em! That’s the trouble just now; he’s turned into plaster of
Paris about poor Dan’s land operations, confound him!"</p>

<p>She uttered this denunciation with a sharpness of emphasis not
ill-natured, but earnest enough to make Harlan look at her seriously
across the small table just set between them by a coloured housemaid.</p>

<p>"You’ve been trying to alter your father’s opinion of Dan’s commercial
ability, have you?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," she answered crisply. "What’s the matter with
the business men of this town, anyway? Why won’t they help Dan
do a big thing?"</p>

<p>At this Harlan allowed his eyes to fall from the troubled and
yet spirited inquiry of her direct gaze; he looked at the cup
he accepted from her, and frowned slightly as he answered: "Of
course they think he’s a visionary. The most enthusiastic home
boomer in the lot doesn’t dream the town’ll ever reach out as
far as Dan’s foolish ‘Addition.’"</p>

<p>"How do you know it’s foolish?"</p>

<p>"Why, because the population would have to double to reach even
the edge of his land, and this town hasn’t the kind of impetus
that develops suburbs. You know what sort of place it is, yourself,
Martha. It’s only an overgrown market-town, and an overgrown market-town
is what it’ll always be."</p>

<p>"Don’t you like it?" she asked challengingly. "Don’t you even
like the town you were born in and grew up in?"</p>

<p>"That sounds like Dan. His latest phase is to become oratorical
about the enormous future of our own, our native city—since he
bought the Ornaby farm! I suppose I like it as well as I like
any city except Florence. I don’t think it’s as ugly as New York,
for instance, because the long stretches of big shade trees palliate
our streets half the year, and nothing palliates the unevenness
and everlasting tearing down and building up and digging and blasting
and steam-riveting of New York. But I do hate the crudeness of
things here."</p>

<p>"That’s the old, old cheap word for us," she said, "‘Crude!’"</p>

<p>Harlan laughed. "You <em>have</em> been listening to Dan, the
civic patriot! Crudeness isn’t <em>our</em> specialty; the whole
country’s crude, Martha."</p>

<p>"Compared to what? China?"</p>

<p>"You’ll be telling me all about our literary societies and women’s
clubs and the factories, if I don’t take care," he returned lightly.
"How dreadful all that is!" He sighed, and continued: "I suppose
you’ve been trying to convince your father he ought to extend
one of his street-car lines out into the wilderness toward Dan’s
‘Addition.’ Is that what you’ve been up to with the old gentleman,
Martha?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," she said quickly. "If he doesn’t, how are people
to get out there?"</p>

<p>"Quite so! That’s one reason why everybody downtown is laughing
at Dan. Your father will never do it, Martha. Have you any idea
he will?"</p>

<p>"Not much of one," she admitted sadly, and shook her head. "He
doesn’t understand Dan’s theory that the car line would pay for
itself by fares from the people who’d build along the line."</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn’t think he’d understand that—at least not very
sympathetically!"</p>

<p>"Dan isn’t discouraged, is he?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, he isn’t the temperament to be discouraged by anything.
It’s a matter of disposition, not of facts, and Dan was born to
be a helpless optimist all his life. For instance, he still believes
that when he marries his Miss McMillan and brings her here to
live, grandmother will learn to like her! Yet he ought to know
by this time that grandmother’s a perfect duplicate of your father
in the matter of plaster of Paris. I suppose you’ve seen Miss
McMillan’s photograph, Martha?"</p>

<p>Harlan glanced at her as if casually, but she answered without
any visible embarrassment: "Oh, yes; he brought it over, and talked
of her a whole evening. If the photograph’s like her——" She paused.</p>

<p>"It’s one of those photographs that <em>are</em> like," Harlan
observed. "My own judgment is that she’s not precisely the girl
to put on a pair of overalls and go out and help Dan clear the
underbrush off his ‘Addition.’"</p>

<p>"Is he doing that himself? I haven’t seen him for days and days."</p>

<p>"No," said Harlan. "You wouldn’t, because he <em>is</em> doing
just about that. I believe he has five or six darkies helping
him; but he keeps overalls for himself out there in a shed. He
gets up before six, drives out in his runabout, with a nose-bag
of oats for his horse under the seat, and he gets home after dark
ready to drop, but still talking about what a success he’s going
to make of the great and only ‘Ornaby Addition.’ He wears shabby
clothes all the time—he seems not to care at all how he looks—and
Saturdays he comes home at noon and spends the rest of the day
downtown making orations to bankers and business men, especially
your father."</p>

<p>"To no effect at all," Martha said gloomily.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I think he’s had an extraordinarily distinct effect!"</p>

<p>"What effect is it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I’m afraid," Harlan said slowly;—"I’m afraid he’s been
successful in making himself the laughing stock of the town."</p>

<p>"They—they think he’s just a joke?"</p>

<p>"Not ‘just’ one," the precise Harlan replied. "They think he’s
the biggest one they’ve ever seen."</p>

<p>Martha uttered a sound of angry protest, though she did not speak
at once, but stared frowningly at the fire; then she turned abruptly
to Harlan. "Why don’t you help him?"</p>

<p>"I? Well, he hasn’t asked me to help him, precisely. Did he tell
you I——"</p>

<p>"No; he didn’t say anything about you. But why don’t you?"</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," Harlan explained, a little annoyed, "he
didn’t ask me for help, but he did want me to go in with him on
strictly business grounds. He was certain that if I joined him
as a partner, it would be a great thing for both of us. He wanted
me to do the same thing he did—invest what grandfather left me
in making the Ornaby farm blossom with horrible bungalows and
corner drug stores."</p>

<p>"And you wouldn’t," Martha said affirmatively.</p>

<p>"Why should I, since I don’t believe in his scheme?"</p>

<p>"But why couldn’t you believe in Dan himself?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" Harlan exclaimed, and uttered a sound of impatient
laughter. "I’ve never looked upon Dan as precisely a genius, Martha.
Besides, even if by a miracle he could do something of what he
dreams he can, what on earth would be the use of it? It would
only be an extension of ugliness into a rather inoffensive landscape.
I don’t believe he can do it in the first place; and in the second,
I don’t believe in doing it even if it can be done."</p>

<p>"Don’t you?" she asked, and looked at him thoughtfully. "What
do you believe in, Harlan?"</p>

<p>"A number of things," he said gravely. "For instance, I don’t
believe in kicking up a lot of dust and confusion to turn a nice
old farm into horrible-looking lots with hideous signboards blaring
all over ’em."</p>

<p>"How characteristic!"</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"I asked you what you believed in," she explained. "You said
you believed in ‘a number of things,’ and went straight on: ‘For
instance, I don’t believe——’"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I was keeping to the argument about Dan."</p>

<p>Martha laughed at his calm sophistry, but was content to seem
to accept it and to waive her point. "What do your father and
mother think of ‘Ornaby Addition’?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know them! They understand as well as anybody that it’s
all folly, but they don’t say so to Dan. I think poor father would
even put something in just to please Dan, if he could spare it
after what he’s lost in bad loans this year."</p>

<p>"How about Mrs. Savage?"</p>

<p>"Grandmother!" Harlan was amused at this suggestion. "Dan has
to keep away from her; she’s taken such a magnificently healthy
prejudice against his little Miss McMillan she won’t talk to him
about anything else, and Dan can’t stand it. Not much chance for
‘Ornaby’ there, Martha!"</p>

<p>"No; she <em>is</em> a plaster of Paris old thing!"</p>

<p>"Inordinately. She’s always been set about <em>me</em>, Martha,"
Harlan remarked with a ruefulness in which there was a measure
of philosophic amusement. "She’s always maintained that I’d never
amount to anything—I have the terrible faults of being an egotist
and smoking cigarettes—but she’s sometimes admitted she thought
Dan might. That’s why she’s furious with him about throwing himself
away on this ‘spoiled ninny of a photograph girl’—her usual way
of referring to Miss McMillan. Grandmother’s twice as furious
with him as if she hadn’t always been like you, Martha."</p>

<p>"Like me? How?"</p>

<p>"I mean about your feeling toward Dan and me." Harlan smiled,
but his eyes were expressive of something far from amusement.
It was as if here he referred to an old and troubling puzzlement
of his, but had long ago resigned himself to the impossibility
of finding a solution. "I mean she’s like you because she’s always
thought so much more of Dan than she has of me, Martha."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it’s because you’ve never seemed to think much of anything,
yourself," she said gently. "Perhaps we’re apt to like people
best who do a great deal of liking themselves."</p>

<p>"I might like to have you like me, Martha," Harlan ventured,
and there was a quiet wistfulness about him then that touched
her. "I might like it better than you know."</p>

<p>She looked at him gravely. "I do like you," she said. "I like
you anyhow; but even if I didn’t, I’d like you because you’re
Dan’s brother."</p>

<p>Harlan sighed, but contrived a smile to accompany his sigh. "Yes;
I’ve always understood that, Martha; and you’re not at all peculiar
in your preference. Not only you and grandmother, but everybody
else likes Dan much better than me."</p>

<p>"And yet," Martha said, a smouldering glow in her kind eyes,
"you tell me that everybody’s laughing at him."</p>

<p>"Haven’t you heard so yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," she cried angrily. "But how can they, if they
like him?"</p>

<p>"Isn’t it plain enough? They like him because he’s a democratic,
friendly soul, and they laugh at him because he’s so absurd about
the Ornaby farm."</p>

<p>"And you think he’s got to do the whole thing absolutely alone?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," Harlan said, correcting her lightly, "I don’t think
he’s going to be able to do the whole thing at all. He’ll get
part way and then of course he’ll have to quit, because his money’ll
give out. What he has left may last him a year or even longer,
if he keeps on just doing with his little gang of darkies and
himself."</p>

<p>"And in the meantime, he’ll also keep on being a ‘laughing stock?’
That’s what you said, didn’t you?"</p>

<p>"I don’t think it was an exaggeration," Harlan returned, defending
himself, for her tone was sharply accusing. "After all," he went
on, with placative lightness, "isn’t it even rather a triumph
in its way? You see, Martha, it isn’t every young man of his age
who’d be well enough known to occupy that position."</p>

<p>"A laughing stock?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. Don’t you see it means a degree of prominence not
at all within the reach of every Tom, Dick, and Harry. For instance,
<em>I</em> couldn’t touch it: I don’t know enough people; but
Dan’s one of those men of whom it’s said, ‘Oh, everybody in town
knows <em>him!</em>’ So, you see, since he’s run wild over this
Ornaby Addition, why, he actually has the whole town laughing
at him."</p>

<p>"Since he’s run wild!" she echoed scornfully. "And you say you
don’t exaggerate! How has he ‘run wild?’"</p>

<p>"Ask your father," was Harlan’s response, delivered quietly,
though with some irritation; and Martha said sharply that she
would, indeed; but this was mere retort, signifying no genuine
intention on her part, for she knew well enough what her father
would say. He had been saying it over and over, every evening
of late; and her discussions with him of Dan Oliphant and "Ornaby
Addition" had reached that point of feeble acrimony at which a
participant with any remnant of wisdom falls back upon a despairing
silence—a silence despairing of the opponent’s sanity. Martha
had no mind to release her father from the oppression of this
silence of hers, merely to hear him repeat himself.</p>

<p>She knew, moreover, that Harlan had not far overshot the mark
when he intimated that Dan had become the laughing stock of the
town; nor was it grossly an exaggeration to describe him as "making
orations to bankers and business men, especially your father."
The enthusiast for "Ornaby Addition" had indeed become somewhat
oratorical upon his great subject; and the bankers and business
men to whom he made speeches not only laughed about him, as did
their secretaries and clerks and stenographers, distributing this
humour widely, but often they laughed at him and rallied him,
interrupting him as he prophesied coming splendours.</p>

<p>"You’ll see!" he would answer, laughing himself, albeit rather
plaintively. "You can sit there and make all the fun o’ me you
want to, but the day’ll come when you’ll wish you’d had a hand
in makin’ this city what it <em>is</em> goin’ to be made! It isn’t
only the money you’d get out of it, but the pride you’d take in
it, and what you’d be able to tell your grandchildren about it.
Why, gentlemen, ten years from now——" Then he would go on painting
his air castles for them while they chuckled or sometimes grew
noisily hilarious.</p>

<p>But the toughest and most powerful of them all declined to chuckle;
there was little good-nature and no hilarity left in dry old Mr.
Shelby. He was seventy, and, as he crisply expressed himself,
at his age he hated to have his time wasted for him; he didn’t
see any pleasure in listening to the goings-on of a fool-boy about
two minutes out of school! This viewpoint he went so far as to
communicate to Dan directly, as the latter stood before him in
the old gentleman’s office. For that matter, Mr. Shelby seldom
cared to be anything except direct; it was his declared belief
that directness was the only thing that paid, in the long run.
"Usin’ a lot of tact and all that stuff to spare touchy people’s
vanity, it’s all a waste of energy and they only hate you worse
in the long run," he said. "So I’m not goin’ to trouble to use
any tact on <em>you</em>, young Mr. Dan Oliphant!"</p>

<p>He was a formidable old figure as he sat in his mahogany swivel-chair,
which every instant threatened to swing him about to face his
big, clean desk again with his back to the visitor. Neat with
an extremity of precision, this old man had not altered perceptibly
in appearance for many years, not even in his clothes; he was
now exactly as he was in Dan’s childhood. The gray chin-beard
was the same precisely trimmed short oblong, and no whiter; the
same incessant slight frown was set between the thin gray eyebrows;
the same small black necktie showed a reticent bow beneath the
flat white collar that was too large for the emaciated neck; and
the same clean white waistcoat was worn under the same black "cutaway"
coat; the same gray-and-black-striped trousers descended to the
same patent-leather "congress gaiters." Twice a year Mr. Shelby
gave an order—always the same order—to his tailor; he never left
his house in the evening; had not taken any exercise whatever
since his youth; went to bed always at nine o’clock; always ate
exactly the same breakfast of oatmeal, an egg, and one cup of
coffee; was never even slightly indisposed; and appeared to be
everlasting. Compared to such a man, granite or basalt might be
imagined as of an amiable plasticity; yet the ardent Dan hopefully
persisted in seeking to remodel him.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, Mr. Shelby," he assented;—"that’s just the way
I want you to feel; I don’t want you to use any tact on me. I
don’t need it. When I’m layin’ out a proposition like this before
a real business man, all I want is his attention to the facts."</p>

<p>"What facts?"</p>

<p>"The facts of the future," the enthusiast replied instantly.
"The future——"</p>

<p>"What d’you mean talkin’ about the facts of the future? There
ain’t any facts in the future. How you goin’ to have any facts
that haven’t happened yet? A fact is something that’s either happened
or <em>is</em> happening right now."</p>

<p>"No, sir!" Dan exclaimed. "The present is only a fraction of
a second, if it’s even that much; the past isn’t any time at all—it’s
gone; everything that amounts to anything is in the future. The
future is all that’s worth anybody’s thinkin’ about. That’s why
I want you to think about the future of your car lines, Mr. Shelby."</p>

<p>"Oh, you do, do you?" the old gentleman said sardonically. "You
think I <em>ain’t</em> thinkin’ about it, so you called around
for the fourth time to draw my attention to it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the undaunted young man replied. "I don’t mean exactly
you don’t think about it; I just mean you don’t seem to me to
consider all the possibilities."</p>

<p>"Such as old Ranse Ornaby’s ex-hog-wallow and corn-patch, for
instance?"</p>

<p>"That ex-hog-wallow and corn-patch, Mr. Shelby," Dan said proudly,
"consists of five hundred and thirty-one and two-thirds acres.
If you’d only drive out there in your carriage as I’ve asked you
to——"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" Mr. Shelby interrupted. "I chopped wood there
thirty years before you were born! D’you think I got to hitch
up and go buggy-ridin’ to know where Ranse Ornaby’s farm is?"</p>

<p>"It isn’t his, sir," Dan reminded him. "It belongs to me. I only
meant, if you’d come out there I think you’d see some changes
since I’ve been layin’ it out in city lots."</p>

<p>"City lots? What city you talkin’ about? Where’s any city in
that part o’ the county? <em>I</em> never knew there was any city
up that way."</p>

<p>"But there is, sir!"</p>

<p>"What’s the name of it?"</p>

<p>"The city of the future!" Dan proclaimed, his eyes brightening
as he heard his own phrase. "<em>This</em> city when it begins
to reach its growth! Why, in ten years from now——"</p>

<p>"Ten years from now!" the old man echoed, with angry mockery.
"What in Constantinople you talkin’ about? D’you know you’re gettin’
to be a regular by-word in this town? Old George Rowe told me
yesterday at his bank, he says you got a nickname like some Indian.
It’s ‘Young Ten-Years-From-Now.’ That’s what they call you: ‘Young
Ten-Years-From-Now’! George Rowe asked me: he says, ‘Has Young
Ten-Years-From-Now been around your way makin’ any more speeches?’
he says. He says that’s the nickname everybody’s got for you.
It’s all over town, he says."</p>

<p>Dan’s colour heightened, but he laughed and said: "Well, I expect
I can stand it. It isn’t a mean nickname, particularly, and I
don’t guess they intend any harm by it. I shouldn’t be surprised
if it turned out to be good advertisin’ for the Addition, Mr.
Shelby."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> should," the old man remarked promptly. "I’d be surprised
if anything turned out good for the Addition!"</p>

<p>"No," said Dan. "That nickname might do a lot o’ good; though
the truth is I’m not talkin’ about ten years from now nearly as
much as I am about only two or three years from now. <em>Ten</em>
years from now this city’ll be way out <em>beyond</em> Ornaby
Addition!"</p>

<p>"Oh, lord! Hear him holler!"</p>

<p>"It will," Dan insisted, his colour glowing the more. "It will!
Why, you go down to the East Side in New York and look at the
way people are crowded, with millions and millions more every
year tryin’ to find footroom. They can’t do it! They’ve <em>got</em>
to go <em>some_where. They’ve got to spread all over the country.
Thousands and hundreds of thousands of ’em have got to come _here</em>.
That’s not all; we’ve got the finest climate in the world, and
the babies that get born here practically all of ’em <em>live</em>,
and there’s tens of thousands of ’em born every year. Besides
that, this city’s not only the natural market of a tremendous
agricultural area, but the railroads make it an absolutely ideal
manufacturing centre. Why, it’s just naturally impossible to <em>stop</em>
the growth that’s comin’, even if anybody wanted to, and the funny
thing to me is that so few of you business men see it!"</p>

<p>"You listen to me," the old man said;—"that is, unless you got
the habit of talkin’ so much you <em>can’t</em> listen! You been
tellin’ the men that run this town quite a few things about our
own business lately; it’s time somebody told you something about
your own. You’re a good deal like your grandfather Savage used
to be before your grandmother sat on him and never let him up.
He was always wantin’ to put his money into any fool thing and
lose it, until she did that, and I hear she tried to stop <em>you</em>,
but you didn’t have the gumption to see she’s right. Now, look
here: I’ve been here since there was a population of seven hundred
people chillin’ every other day, eatin’ quinine by the handful,
and draggin’ one foot after the other out of two-foot mud if they
had to get off a horse and walk anywhere. Last census we had a
hundred and eighty thousand. I’ve seen it all! D’you expect you
can tell <em>me</em> anything about this town?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; not about the history of it or anything that’s past.
But about the future——"</p>

<p>"You listen!" Shelby commanded irascibly. "You come around here
blowin’ out your chest and tellin’ us old settlers that this town
has grown some——"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I know you know all about that a thousand times better’n
I do. I only use it to prove the town’s goin’ to keep <em>on</em>
growin’. Why, Mr. Shelby, ten years from now——"</p>

<p>"Great Gee-mun-nently!" the old man shouted. "Can’t you listen
at <em>all?</em> Of <em>course</em> it’s goin’ to keep on growin’,
but not the way you think it is. It’s already reached its land
size, or mighty near it, because there’s plenty vacant lots inside
the city limits—hunderds and hunderds of ’em—and people want to
live near their business; they don’t want to go way out in the
country where there ain’t any sewers nor any gas nor city water."</p>

<p>"But they’ll <em>get</em> all that, Mr. Shelby. They will as
soon as there’s enough of ’em to make it pay the water company
and the gas company to run their pipes out; and there’d <em>be</em>
enough of ’em, if you’d lay even a single track out to——"</p>

<p>"Out to Ranse Ornaby’s frog pond!" the old man interrupted angrily.
"You think if I’d throw away a hundred thousand dollars like so
much dirt, that’d bring the millennium to the old hog-wallow,
do you, young man? Look out that window behind you. What’s the
biggest thing you see?"</p>

<p>"The First National Bank Building."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Eleven stories high, and the Sheridan Trust Company’s
got plans to put up a block higher’n that. People’ll build up
in the air, not only for business, but to live in flats, but they
won’t go ’way out to a hog-wallow in the country when there ain’t
a reason on earth for ’em to. You seem to think people ride on
street-cars for pleasure! Well, I’ve had some experience in the
business, and I can tell you they don’t, except in mighty hot
weather; they ride on street-cars to get somewhere they want to
<em>go</em>; and goodness knows nobody wants to go to Ranse Ornaby’s
farm."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Shelby, if you’d listen just a minute——"</p>

<p>"I’ve listened all I’m a-goin’ to," the old man said decisively.
"This is the fourth time you been here tellin’ me all about this
town that wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for me and some the other
men you been lecturin’ to about it. You go at me as if I’d just
put up at the hotel and never saw the place before, and what’s
worse you’ve gone and got Martha so she keeps ding-dongin’ at
me till I can’t eat my supper in peace! It’s about time for you
to understand it’s no use."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Shelby, if you’d just let me put the <em>facts</em>
before you——"</p>

<p>"Facts about what’s goin’ to happen ten years from now? No, sir!"
The swivel-chair began to turn, making it clear that this interview
had drawn to a close. "I thank you, but I can make up my own facts,
if I so desire!" And the back of the chair and its occupant were
offered to the view of the caller.</p>

<p>Dan made a final effort. "Mr. Shelby, I hope you don’t mean this
for your last word on the subject, because just as sure as you’re
born the day will come when——"</p>

<p>"Will it?" the old man interrupted; and turned his head angrily,
so that his neat beard was thrust upward by his shoulder and seemed
to bristle. "You go teach your grandma Savage to suck eggs," he
said with fierce mockery, "but don’t come around here any more
tellin’ <em>me</em> where I better lay my car tracks!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I——"</p>

<p>"That’s <em>all!</em>"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Dan said, a little depressed for the moment.</p>

<p>But in the hall, outside the office, he recovered his cheerfulness,
and, after consulting a memorandum book, decided to call on Mr.
George Howe, the president of the First National Bank. Since yesterday
Dan had thought of several new things that were certain to happen
within the next ten years. </p>
