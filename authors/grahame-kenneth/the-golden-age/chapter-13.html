<p>IT must surely have served as a boudoir for the ladies of old time,
this little used, rarely entered chamber where the neglected old bureau
stood. There was something very feminine in the faint hues of its faded
brocades, in the rose and blue of such bits of china as yet remained,
and in the delicate old-world fragrance of pot-pourri from the great
bowl,—blue and white, with funny holes in its cover,—that stood on
the bureau’s flat top. Modern aunts disdained this out-of-the-way,
backwater, upstairs room, preferring to do their accounts and grapple
with their correspondence in some central position more in the whirl
of things, whence one eye could be kept on the carriage-drive, while
the other was alert for malingering servants and marauding children.
Those aunts of a former generation—I sometimes felt—would have suited
our habits better. But even by us children, to whom few places were
private or reserved, the room was visited but rarely. To be sure,
there was nothing particular in it that we coveted or required. Only a
few spindle-legged, gilt-backed chairs,—an old harp on which, so the
legend ran, Aunt Eliza herself used once to play, in years remote,
unchronicled; a corner-cupboard with a few pieces of china; and the old
bureau. But one other thing the room possessed, peculiar to itself; a
certain sense of privacy—a power of making the intruder feel that he
<u>was</u> intruding—perhaps even a faculty of hinting that some one might
have been sitting on those chairs, writing at the bureau, or fingering
the china, just a second before one entered. No such violent word as
‘haunted’ could possibly apply to this pleasant old-fashioned chamber,
which indeed we all rather liked; but there was no doubt it was
reserved and stand-offish, keeping itself to itself.
</p><p>Uncle Thomas was the first to draw my attention to the possibilities
of the old bureau. He was pottering about the house one afternoon,
having ordered me to keep at his heels for company—he was a man who
hated to be left one minute alone,—when his eye fell on it. ‘H’m!
Sheraton!’ he remarked. (He had a smattering of most things, this
uncle, especially the vocabularies.) Then he let down the flap, and
examined the empty pigeon-holes and dusty panelling. ‘Fine bit of
inlay,’ he went on: ‘good work, all of it. I know the sort. There’s a
secret drawer in there somewhere.’ Then as I breathlessly drew near, he
suddenly exclaimed: ‘By Jove, I do want to smoke!’ And, wheeling round,
he abruptly fled for the garden, leaving me with the cup dashed from my
lips. What a strange thing, I mused, was this smoking, that takes a man
suddenly, be he in the court, the camp, or the grove, grips him like
an Afreet, and whirls him off to do its imperious behests! Would it be
even so with myself, I wondered, in those unknown grown-up years to
come?
</p><p>But I had no time to waste in vain speculations. My whole being was
still vibrating to those magic syllables ‘secret drawer’; and that
particular chord had been touched that never fails to thrill responsive
to such words as <u>cave</u>, <u>trap-door</u>, <u>sliding-panel</u>, <u>bullion</u>,
<u>ingots</u>, or <u>Spanish dollars</u>. For, besides its own special bliss,
who ever heard of a secret drawer with nothing in it? And O I did want
money so badly! I mentally ran over the list of demands which were
pressing me the most imperiously.
</p><p>First, there was the pipe I wanted to give George Jannaway. George,
who was Martha’s young man, was a shepherd, and a great ally of mine;
and the last fair he was at, when he bought his sweetheart fairings,
as a right-minded shepherd should, he had purchased a lovely snake
expressly for me; one of the wooden sort, with joints, waggling
deliciously in the hand; with yellow spots on a green ground, sticky
and strong-smelling, as a fresh-painted snake ought to be; and with a
red-flannel tongue pasted cunningly into its jaws. I loved it much, and
took it to bed with me every night, till what time its spinal cord was
loosed and it fell apart, and went the way of all mortal joys. _I_
thought it very nice of George to think of me at the fair, and that’s
why I wanted to give him a pipe. When the young year was chill and
lambing-time was on, George inhabited a little wooden house on wheels,
far out on the wintry downs, and saw no faces but such as were sheepish
and woolly and mute; and when he and Martha were married, she was going
to carry his dinner out to him every day, two miles; and after it,
perhaps he would smoke my pipe. It seemed an idyllic sort of existence,
for both the parties concerned; but a pipe of quality, a pipe fitted
to be part of a life such as this, could not be procured (so Martha
informed me) for a smaller sum than eighteenpence. And meantime——!
</p><p>Then there was the fourpence I owed Edward; not that he was bothering
me for it, but I knew he was in need of it himself, to pay back Selina,
who wanted it to make up a sum of two shillings, to buy Harold an
ironclad for his approaching birthday,—H.M.S. <u>Majestic</u>, now lying
uselessly careened in the toyshop window, just when her country had
such sore need of her.
</p><p>And then there was that boy in the village who had caught a young
squirrel, and I had never yet possessed one, and he wanted a shilling
for it, but I knew that for ninepence in cash—but what was the good of
these sorry threadbare reflections? I had wants enough to exhaust any
possible find of bullion, even if it amounted to half a sovereign. My
only hope now lay in the magic drawer, and here I was, standing and
letting the precious minutes slip by! Whether ‘findings’ of this sort
could, morally speaking, be considered ‘keepings,’ was a point that did
not occur to me.
</p><p>The room was very still as I approached the bureau; possessed, it
seemed to be, by a sort of hush of expectation. The faint odour of
orris-root that floated forth as I let down the flap, seemed to
identify itself with the yellows and browns of the old wood, till hue
and scent were of one quality and interchangeable. Even so, ere this,
the pot-pourri had mixed itself with the tints of the old brocade,
and brocade and pot-pourri had long been one. With expectant fingers
I explored the empty pigeon-holes and sounded the depths of the
softly-sliding drawers. No books that I knew of gave any general recipe
for a quest like this; but the glory, should I succeed unaided, would
be all the greater.
</p><p>To him who is destined to arrive, the fates never fail to afford, on
the way, their small encouragements. In less than two minutes, I had
come across a rusty button-hook. This was truly magnificent. In the
nursery there existed, indeed, a general button-hook, common to either
sex; but none of us possessed a private and special button-hook, to
lend or to refuse as suited the high humour of the moment. I pocketed
the treasure carefully, and proceeded. At the back of another drawer,
three old foreign stamps told me I was surely on the highroad to
fortune.
</p><p>Following on these bracing incentives, came a dull blank period of
unrewarded search. In vain I removed all the drawers and felt over
every inch of the smooth surfaces, from front to back. Never a knob,
spring or projection met the thrilling finger-tips; unyielding the
old bureau stood, stoutly guarding its secret, if secret it really
had. I began to grow weary and disheartened. This was not the first
time that Uncle Thomas had proved shallow, uninformed, a guide into
blind alleys where the echoes mocked you. Was it any good persisting
longer? Was anything any good whatever? In my mind I began to review
past disappointments, and life seemed one long record of failure and
of non-arrival. Disillusioned and depressed, I left my work and went
to the window. The light was ebbing from the room, and seemed outside
to be collecting itself on the horizon for its concentrated effort of
sunset. Far down the garden, Uncle Thomas was holding Edward in the air
reversed, and smacking him. Edward, gurgling hysterically, was striking
blind fists in the direction where he judged his uncle’s stomach should
rightly be; the contents of his pockets—a motley show—were strewing
the lawn. Somehow, though I had been put through a similar performance
myself an hour or two ago, it all seemed very far away and cut off from
me.
</p><p>[Illustration: “WESTWARD THE CLOUDS WERE MASSING THEMSELVES IN A LOW
<strong>VIOLET BANK; BELOW THEM, TO NORTH AND SOUTH, AS FAR ROUND AS THE EYE</strong>
<strong>COULD REACH, A NARROW STREAK OF GOLD RAN OUT ..... I TURNED FOR A LAST</strong>
<strong>EFFORT”]</strong>
</p><p>Westwards the clouds were massing themselves in a low violet bank;
below them, to north and south, as far round as eye could reach, a
narrow streak of gold ran out and stretched away, straight along the
horizon. Somewhere very far off, a horn was blowing, clear and thin;
it sounded like the golden streak grown audible, while the gold seemed
the visible sound. It pricked my ebbing courage, this blended strain of
music and colour. I turned for a last effort; and Fortune thereupon,
as if half-ashamed of the unworthy game she had been playing with me,
relented, opening her clenched fist. Hardly had I put my hand once more
to the obdurate wood, when with a sort of small sigh, almost a sob—as
it were—of relief, the secret drawer sprang open.
</p><p>I drew it out and carried it to the window, to examine it in the
failing light. Too hopeless had I gradually grown, in my dispiriting
search, to expect very much; and yet at a glance I saw that my basket
of glass lay in shivers at my feet. No ingots nor dollars were here,
to crown me the little Monte Cristo of a week. Outside, the distant
horn had ceased its gnat-song, the gold was paling to primrose, and
everything was lonely and still. Within, my confident little castles
were tumbling down like so many card-houses, leaving me stripped
of estate, both real and personal, and dominated by the depressing
reaction.
</p><p>And yet,—as I looked again at the small collection that lay within
that drawer of disillusions, some warmth crept back to my heart as
I recognised that a kindred spirit to my own had been at the making
of it. Two tarnished gilt buttons—naval, apparently—a portrait of a
monarch unknown to me, cut from some antique print and deftly coloured
by hand in just my own bold style of brush-work—some foreign copper
coins, thicker and clumsier of make than those I hoarded myself—and
a list of birds’-eggs, with names of the places where they had been
found. Also, a ferret’s muzzle, and a twist of tarry string, still
faintly aromatic! It was a real boy’s hoard, then, that I had happened
upon. He too had found out the secret drawer, this happy-starred young
person; and here he had stowed away his treasures, one by one, and had
cherished them secretly awhile, and then—what? Well, one would never
know now the reason why these priceless possessions still lay here
unreclaimed; but across the void stretch of years I seemed to touch
hands a moment with my little comrade of seasons—how many seasons?—long
since dead.
</p><p>I restored the drawer, with its contents, to the trusty bureau, and
heard the spring click with a certain satisfaction. Some other boy,
perhaps, would some day release that spring again. I trusted he
would be equally appreciative. As I opened the door to go, I could
hear, from the nursery at the end of the passage, shouts and yells,
telling that the hunt was up. Bears, apparently, or bandits, were on
the evening bill of fare, judging by the character of the noises. In
another minute I would be in the thick of it, in all the warmth and
light and laughter. And yet—what a long way off it all seemed, both in
space and time, to me yet lingering on the threshold of that old-world
chamber!
