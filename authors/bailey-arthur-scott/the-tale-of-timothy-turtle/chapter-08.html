<p>So Timothy Turtle struggled up the steep face of the bluff. And as he
neared the top Mr. Crow began to hop up and down upon the old pine
stump. He was almost bursting with silent laughter. But he succeeded in
keeping quiet. And now and then he made threatening motions toward
Jasper Jay and his friends, who stuck their heads from behind limbs of
trees and hummocks and bushes, lest they miss any of the fun.
</p>
<p>Once on top of the great rock that capped the bluff and hung out over
the creek, Timothy Turtle clung there and peered down at the gently
flowing water below.
</p><p>"What a long way it is down there!" he called to Mr. Crow.
</p><p>"Don't think about that!" Mr. Crow cautioned him.
</p><p>"Is this the way Mr. Alligator learned to fly?" Timothy Turtle demanded.
</p><p>"Don't think about him!" Mr. Crow shouted. "Just jump out as far as you
can!"
</p><p>"I believe I don't care to fly to-day," Timothy Turtle faltered, drawing
back from the edge of the rock. "I----I'll wait till some other time.
You know, I'm older than you are."
</p><p>"Tut, tut!" said Mr. Crow. "When I'm your age I shall still be flying as
well as I do now. It's nothing, when you know how. Nothing at all!"
</p><p>Urged by Mr. Crow, Timothy Turtle once more crept to the very edge of
the cliff and stretched his neck out as far as he could, to gaze down at
the black water. And at last, after making several false starts and
drawing back to a place of safety, he stood up on his hind legs, shut
his eyes, and hopped off into space.
</p><p>Now, the moment Timothy Turtle leaped from the top of the bluff a
deafening squawk broke the silence. Old Mr. Crow <u>cawed</u> as loud as he
knew how. But the racket he made was as nothing compared with the uproar
of Jasper Jay and the noisy crew he had brought with him. They squalled
with delight as Timothy Turtle plunged through the air like a stone. And
when he landed upside down in the creek, striking the water with a great
splash, the whole company shrieked louder than ever.
</p><p>"<u>Ha! ha! ha</u>!" Mr. Crow cried, holding his sides and rocking backwards
and forwards upon the old stump.
</p><p>"<u>Jay</u>! <u>jay</u>! <u>jay</u>!" Jasper and his friends bawled, hopping up and
down and cutting capers in the air.
</p><p>As for Timothy Turtle, he made no sound at all. And neither did he make
the slightest motion. The current of Black Creek caught him and bore him
away down the stream. But at last he managed to paddle ashore. And he
pulled himself slowly out of the water, and lay upon the sand and
groaned.
</p><p>Mr. Crow and his cronies gathered quickly about him.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" Mr. Crow inquired. "Don't you like flying?"
</p><p>It was some time before Timothy could answer.
</p><p>"I've had an awful fall," he moaned finally.
</p><p>"Where are you hurt?" Mr. Crow asked him.
</p><p>"Everywhere!" Timothy Turtle told him. "I thought you said that water
was soft to fall into."
</p><p>"Well, isn't it?"
</p><p>"It certainly is _not,_" Timothy Turtle declared. "I believe there's
nothing harder in the whole world.... I've heard, sir, that you are very
wise. But for once, anyhow, you've made a great mistake."
</p><p>Old Mr. Crow coughed--and winked at his friends. "The trouble was"--he
explained--"the trouble was, you lost your balance and landed in the
creek upside down. And of course you couldn't fly in that position. It's
what's called 'turning turtle,'" he added, "and I might have known--if I
had stopped to think--that you'd be sure to do it."
</p><p>"Well," said Timothy Turtle, drawing a long breath, "I'll tell you right
now that I'll never, <u>never</u>, turn turtle again."
