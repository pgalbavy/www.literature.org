<p>"What's the matter with King Tom of late?" would ask someone
when, all the cards in a heap on the table, the traders lying
back in their chairs took a spell from a hard gamble.</p>

<p>"Tom has learned to hold his tongue, he must be up to some dam'
good thing," opined another; while a man with hooked features
and of German extraction who was supposed to be agent for a Dutch
crockery house&mdash;the famous "Sphinx" mark&mdash;broke in resentfully:</p>

<p>"Nefer mind him, shentlemens, he's matt, matt as a Marsh Hase.
Dree monats ago I call on board his prig to talk pizness. And
he says like dis&mdash;'Glear oudt.' 'Vat for?' I say. 'Glear oudt
before I shuck you oferboard.' Gott-for-dam! Iss dat the vay to
talk pizness? I vant sell him ein liddle case first chop grockery
for trade and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! I don't blame Tom," interrupted the owner of a pearling
schooner, who had come into the Roads for stores. "Why, Mosey,
there isn't a mangy cannibal left in the whole of New Guinea that
hasn't got a cup and saucer of your providing. You've flooded
the market, savee?"</p>

<p>Jorgenson stood by, a skeleton at the gaming table.</p>

<p>"Because you are a Dutch spy," he said, suddenly, in an awful
tone.</p>

<p>The agent of the Sphinx mark jumped up in a sudden fury.</p>

<p>"Vat? Vat? Shentlemens, you all know me!" Not a muscle moved
in the faces around. "Know me," he stammered with wet lips. "Vat,
funf year&mdash;berfegtly acquaint&mdash;grockery &mdash;Verfluchte sponsher.
Ich? Spy. Vat for spy? Vordamte English pedlars!"</p>

<p>The door slammed. "Is that so?" asked a New England voice. "Why
don't you let daylight into him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we can't do that here," murmured one of the players. "Your
deal, Trench, let us get on."</p>

<p>"Can't you?" drawled the New England voice. "You law-abiding,
get-a-summons, act-of&mdash;parliament lot of sons of Belial&mdash;can't
you? Now, look a-here, these Colt pistols I am selling&mdash;" He took
the pearler aside and could be heard talking earnestly in the
corner. "See&mdash;you load&mdash;and&mdash;see?" There were rapid clicks. "Simple,
isn't it? And if any trouble&mdash;say with your divers"&mdash;<em>click,
click, click</em>&mdash;"Through and through&mdash;like a sieve&mdash;warranted
to cure the worst kind of cussedness in any nigger. Yes, siree!
A case of twenty-four or single specimens&mdash;as you like. No? Shot-guns&mdash;rifles?
No! Waal, I guess you're of no use to me, but I could do a deal
with that Tom&mdash;what d'ye call him? Where d'ye catch him? Everywhere&mdash;eh?
Waal&mdash;that's nowhere. But I shall find him some day&mdash;yes, siree."</p>

<p>Jorgenson, utterly disregarded, looked down dreamily at the falling
cards. "Spy &mdash;I tell you," he muttered to himself. "If you
want to know anything, ask me."</p>

<p>When Lingard returned from Wajo&mdash;after an uncommonly long absence&mdash;everyone
remarked a great change. He was less talkative and not so noisy,
he was still hospitable but his hospitality was less expansive,
and the man who was never so happy as when discussing impossibly
wild projects with half a dozen congenial spirits often showed
a disinclination to meet his best friends. In a word, he returned
much less of a good fellow than he went away. His visits to the
Settlements were not less frequent, but much shorter; and when
there he was always in a hurry to be gone.</p>

<p>During two years the brig had, in her way, as hard a life of
it as the man. Swift and trim she flitted amongst the islands
of little known groups. She could be descried afar from lonely
headlands, a white speck travelling fast over the blue sea; the
apathetic keepers of rare lighthouses dotting the great highway
to the east came to know the cut of her topsails. They saw her
passing east, passing west. They had faint glimpses of her flying
with masts aslant in the mist of a rain-squall, or could observe
her at leisure, upright and with shivering sails, forging ahead
through a long day of unsteady airs. Men saw her battling with
a heavy monsoon in the Bay of Bengal, lying becalmed in the Java
Sea, or gliding out suddenly from behind a point of land, graceful
and silent in the clear moonlight. Her activity was the subject
of excited but low-toned conversations, which would be interrupted
when her master appeared.</p>

<p>"Here he is. Came in last night," whispered the gossiping group.</p>

<p>Lingard did not see the covert glances of respect tempered by
irony; he nodded and passed on.</p>

<p>"Hey, Tom! No time for a drink?" would shout someone.</p>

<p>He would shake his head without looking back&mdash;far away already.</p>

<p>Florid and burly he could be seen, for a day or two, getting
out of dusty gharries, striding in sunshine from the Occidental
Bank to the Harbour Office, crossing the Esplanade, disappearing
down a street of Chinese shops, while at his elbow and as tall
as himself, old Jorgenson paced along, lean and faded, obstinate
and disregarded, like a haunting spirit from the past eager to
step back into the life of men.</p>

<p>Lingard ignored this wreck of an adventurer, sticking to him
closer than his shadow, and the other did not try to attract attention.
He waited patiently at the doors of offices, would vanish at tiffin
time, would invariably turn up again in the evening and then he
kept his place till Lingard went aboard for the night. The police
peons on duty looked disdainfully at the phantom of Captain H.
C. Jorgenson, Barque Wild Rose, wandering on the silent quay or
standing still for hours at the edge of the sombre roadstead speckled
by the anchor lights of ships&mdash;an adventurous soul longing to
recross the waters of oblivion.</p>

<p>The sampan-men, sculling lazily homeward past the black hull
of the brig at anchor, could hear far into the night the drawl
of the New England voice escaping through the lifted panes of
the cabin skylight. Snatches of nasal sentences floated in the
stillness around the still craft.</p>

<p>"Yes, siree! Mexican war rifles&mdash;good as new&mdash;six in a case&mdash;my
people in Baltimore&mdash;that's so. Hundred and twenty rounds thrown
in for each specimen&mdash;marked to suit your requirements. Suppose&mdash;musical
instruments, this side up with care&mdash;how's that for your taste?
No, no! Cash down&mdash;my people in Balt &mdash;Shooting sea-gulls
you say? Waal! It's a risky business&mdash;see here&mdash;ten per cent.
discount&mdash;it's out of my own pocket&mdash;"</p>

<p>As time wore on, and nothing happened, at least nothing that
one could hear of, the excitement died out. Lingard's new attitude
was accepted as only "his way." There was nothing in it, maintained
some. Others dissented. A good deal of curiosity, however, remained
and the faint rumour of something big being in preparation followed
him into every harbour he went to, from Rangoon to Hongkong.</p>

<p>He felt nowhere so much at home as when his brig was anchored
on the inner side of the great stretch of shoals. The centre of
his life had shifted about four hundred miles&mdash;from the Straits
of Malacca to the Shore of Refuge&mdash;and when there he felt himself
within the circle of another existence, governed by his impulse,
nearer his desire. Hassim and Immada would come down to the coast
and wait for him on the islet. He always left them with regret.</p>

<p>At the end of the first stage in each trip, Jorgenson waited
for him at the top of the boat-stairs and without a word fell
into step at his elbow. They seldom exchanged three words in a
day; but one evening about six months before Lingard's last trip,
as they were crossing the short bridge over the canal where native
craft lie moored in clusters, Jorgenson lengthened his stride
and came abreast. It was a moonlight night and nothing stirred
on earth but the shadows of high clouds. Lingard took off his
hat and drew in a long sigh in the tepid breeze. Jorgenson spoke
suddenly in a cautious tone: "The new Rajah Tulla smokes opium
and is sometimes dangerous to speak to. There is a lot of discontent
in Wajo amongst the big people."</p>

<p>"Good! Good!" whispered Lingard, excitedly, off his guard for
once. Then&mdash;"How the devil do you know anything about it?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Jorgenson pointed at the mass of praus, coasting boats, and sampans
that, jammed up together in the canal, lay covered with mats and
flooded by the cold moonlight with here and there a dim lantern
burning amongst the confusion of high sterns, spars, masts and
lowered sails.</p>

<p>"There!" he said, as they moved on, and their hatted and clothed
shadows fell heavily on the queer-shaped vessels that carry the
fortunes of brown men upon a shallow sea. "There! I can sit with
them, I can talk to them, I can come and go as I like. They know
me now&mdash;it's time-thirty-five years. Some of them give a plate
of rice and a bit of fish to the white man. That's all I get&mdash;after
thirty-five years&mdash;given up to them."</p>

<p>He was silent for a time.</p>

<p>"I was like you once," he added, and then laying his hand on
Lingard's sleeve, murmured&mdash;"Are you very deep in this thing?"</p>

<p>"To the very last cent," said Lingard, quietly, and looking straight
before him.</p>

<p>The glitter of the roadstead went out, and the masts of anchored
ships vanished in the invading shadow of a cloud.</p>

<p>"Drop it," whispered Jorgenson.</p>

<p>"I am in debt," said Lingard, slowly, and stood still.</p>

<p>"Drop it!"</p>

<p>"Never dropped anything in my life."</p>

<p>"Drop it!"</p>

<p>"By God, I won't!" cried Lingard, stamping his foot.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"I was like you&mdash;once," repeated Jorgenson. "Five and thirty
years&mdash;never dropped anything. And what you can do is only child's
play to some jobs I have had on my hands&mdash;understand that&mdash;great
man as you are, Captain Lingard of the Lightning. . . . You should
have seen the Wild Rose," he added with a sudden break in his
voice.</p>

<p>Lingard leaned over the guard-rail of the pier. Jorgenson came
closer.</p>

<p>"I set fire to her with my own hands!" he said in a vibrating
tone and very low, as if making a monstrous confession.</p>

<p>"Poor devil," muttered Lingard, profoundly moved by the tragic
enormity of the act. "I suppose there was no way out?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't going to let her rot to pieces in some Dutch port,"
said Jorgenson, gloomily. "Did you ever hear of Dawson?"</p>

<p>"Something &mdash;I don't remember now&mdash;" muttered Lingard, who
felt a chill down his back at the idea of his own vessel decaying
slowly in some Dutch port. "He died&mdash;didn't he?" he asked, absently,
while he wondered whether he would have the pluck to set fire
to the brig&mdash;on an emergency.</p>

<p>"Cut his throat on the beach below Fort Rotterdam," said Jorgenson.
His gaunt figure wavered in the unsteady moonshine as though made
of mist. "Yes. He broke some trade regulation or other and talked
big about law-courts and legal trials to the lieutenant of the
Komet. 'Certainly,' says the hound. 'Jurisdiction of Macassar,
I will take your schooner there.' Then coming into the roads he
tows her full tilt on a ledge of rocks on the north side&mdash;smash!
When she was half full of water he takes his hat off to Dawson.
'There's the shore,' says he&mdash;'go and get your legal trial, you
&mdash;Englishman&mdash;'" He lifted a long arm and shook his fist
at the moon which dodged suddenly behind a cloud. "All was lost.
Poor Dawson walked the streets for months barefooted and in rags.
Then one day he begged a knife from some charitable soul, went
down to take a last look at the wreck, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't interfere with the Dutch," interrupted Lingard, impatiently.
"I want Hassim to get back his own&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And suppose the Dutch want the things just so," returned Jorgenson.
"Anyway there is a devil in such work&mdash;drop it!"</p>

<p>"Look here," said Lingard, "I took these people off when they
were in their last ditch. That means something. I ought not to
have meddled and it would have been all over in a few hours. I
must have meant something when I interfered, whether I knew it
or not. I meant it then&mdash;and did not know it. Very well. I mean
it now&mdash;and do know it. When you save people from death you take
a share in their life. That's how I look at it."</p>

<p>Jorgenson shook his head.</p>

<p>"Foolishness!" he cried, then asked softly in a voice that trembled
with curiosity&mdash;"Where did you leave them?"</p>

<p>"With Belarab," breathed out Lingard. "You knew him in the old
days."</p>

<p>"I knew him, I knew his father," burst out the other in an excited
whisper. "Whom did I not know? I knew Sentot when he was King
of the South Shore of Java and the Dutch offered a price for his
head&mdash;enough to make any man's fortune. He slept twice on board
the Wild Rose when things had begun to go wrong with him. I knew
him, I knew all his chiefs, the priests, the fighting men, the
old regent who lost heart and went over to the Dutch, I knew&mdash;"
he stammered as if the words could not come out, gave it up and
sighed&mdash;"Belarab's father escaped with me," he began again, quietly,
"and joined the Padris in Sumatra. He rose to be a great leader.
Belarab was a youth then. Those were the times. I ranged the coast&mdash;and
laughed at the cruisers; I saw every battle fought in the Battak
country&mdash;and I saw the Dutch run; I was at the taking of Singal
and escaped. I was the white man who advised the chiefs of Manangkabo.
There was a lot about me in the Dutch papers at the time. They
said I was a Frenchman turned Mohammedan&mdash;" he swore a great oath,
and, reeling against the guard-rail, panted, muttering curses
on newspapers.</p>

<p>"Well, Belarab has the job in hand," said Lingard, composedly.
"He is the chief man on the Shore of Refuge. There are others,
of course. He has sent messages north and south. We must have
men."</p>

<p>"All the devils unchained," said Jorgenson. "You have done it
and now&mdash;look out&mdash;look out. . . ."</p>

<p>"Nothing can go wrong as far as I can see," argued Lingard. "They
all know what's to be done. I've got them in hand. You don't think
Belarab unsafe? Do you?"</p>

<p>"Haven't seen him for fifteen years&mdash;but the whole thing's unsafe," 
growled Jorgenson.</p>

<p>"I tell you I've fixed it so that nothing can go wrong. It would
be better if I had a white man over there to look after things
generally. There is a good lot of stores and arms&mdash;and Belarab
would bear watching&mdash;no doubt. Are you in any want?" he added,
putting his hand in his pocket.</p>

<p>"No, there's plenty to eat in the house," answered Jorgenson,
curtly. "Drop it," he burst out. "It would be better for you to
jump overboard at once. Look at me. I came out a boy of eighteen.
I can speak English, I can speak Dutch, I can speak every cursed
lingo of these islands &mdash;I remember things that would make
your hair stand on end&mdash;but I have forgotten the language of my
own country. I've traded, I've fought, I never broke my word to
white or native. And, look at me. If it hadn't been for the girl
I would have died in a ditch ten years ago. Everything left me&mdash;youth,
money, strength, hope&mdash;the very sleep. But she stuck by the wreck."</p>

<p>"That says a lot for her and something for you," said Lingard,
cheerily.</p>

<p>Jorgenson shook his head.</p>

<p>"That's the worst of all," he said with slow emphasis. "That's
the end. I came to them from the other side of the earth and they
took me and&mdash;see what they made of me."</p>

<p>"What place do you belong to?" asked Lingard.</p>

<p>"Tromso," groaned out Jorgenson; "I will never see snow again,"
he sobbed out, his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Lingard looked at him in silence.</p>

<p>"Would you come with me?" he said. "As I told you, I am in want
of a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would see you damned first!" broke out the other, savagely.
"I am an old white loafer, but you don't get me to meddle in their
infernal affairs. They have a devil of their own&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The thing simply can't fail. I've calculated every move. I've
guarded against everything. I am no fool."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you are. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye," said Lingard, calmly.</p>

<p>He stepped into his boat, and Jorgenson walked up the jetty.
Lingard, clearing the yoke lines, heard him call out from a distance:</p>

<p>"Drop it!"</p>

<p>"I sail before sunrise," he shouted in answer, and went on board.</p>

<p>When he came up from his cabin after an uneasy night, it was
dark yet. A lank figure strolled across the deck.</p>

<p>"Here I am," said Jorgenson, huskily. "Die there or here&mdash;all
one. But, if I die there, remember the girl must eat."</p>

<p>Lingard was one of the few who had seen Jorgenson's girl. She
had a wrinkled brown face, a lot of tangled grey hair, a few black
stumps of teeth, and had been married to him lately by an enterprising
young missionary from Bukit Timah. What her appearance might have
been once when Jorgenson gave for her three hundred dollars and
several brass guns, it was impossible to say. All that was left
of her youth was a pair of eyes, undimmed and mournful, which,
when she was alone, seemed to look stonily into the past of two
lives. When Jorgenson was near they followed his movements with
anxious pertinacity. And now within the sarong thrown over the
grey head they were dropping unseen tears while Jorgenson's girl
rocked herself to and fro, squatting alone in a corner of the
dark hut.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about that," said Lingard, grasping Jorgenson's
hand. "She shall want for nothing. All I expect you to do is to
look a little after Belarab's morals when I am away. One more
trip I must make, and then we shall be ready to go ahead. I've
foreseen every single thing. Trust me!"</p>

<p>In this way did the restless shade of Captain H. C. Jorgenson
recross the water of oblivion to step back into the life of men.</p>
