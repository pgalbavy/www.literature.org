<p>There are certain occurrences which we are in the habit of calling
"mental." Among these we may take as typical <em>BELIEVING </em>and
<em>DESIRING. </em>The exact definition of the word "mental" will,
I hope, emerge as the lectures proceed; for the present, I shall
mean by it whatever occurrences would commonly be called mental.</p>

<p>I wish in these lectures to analyse as fully as I can what it
is that really takes place when we, e.g. believe or desire. In
this first lecture I shall be concerned to refute a theory which
is widely held, and which I formerly held myself: the theory that
the essence of everything mental is a certain quite peculiar something
called "consciousness," conceived either as a relation to objects,
or as a pervading quality of psychical phenomena.</p>

<p>The reasons which I shall give against this theory will be mainly
derived from previous authors. There are two sorts of reasons,
which will divide my lecture into two parts:</p>

<p>(1) Direct reasons, derived from analysis and its difficulties;</p>

<p>(2) Indirect reasons, derived from observation of animals (comparative
psychology) and of the insane and hysterical (psycho-analysis).</p>

<p>Few things are more firmly established in popular philosophy
than the distinction between mind and matter. Those who are not
professional metaphysicians are willing to confess that they do
not know what mind actually is, or how matter is constituted;
but they remain convinced that there is an impassable gulf between
the two, and that both belong to what actually exists in the world.
Philosophers, on the other hand, have maintained often that matter
is a mere fiction imagined by mind, and sometimes that mind is
a mere property of a certain kind of matter. Those who maintain
that mind is the reality and matter an evil dream are called "idealists"&mdash;a
word which has a different meaning in philosophy from that which
it bears in ordinary life. Those who argue that matter is the
reality and mind a mere property of protoplasm are called "materialists."
They have been rare among philosophers, but common, at certain
periods, among men of science. Idealists, materialists, and ordinary
mortals have been in agreement on one point: that they knew sufficiently
what they meant by the words "mind" and "matter" to be able to
conduct their debate intelligently. Yet it was just in this point,
as to which they were at one, that they seem to me to have been
all alike in error.</p>

<p>The stuff of which the world of our experience is composed is,
in my belief, neither mind nor matter, but something more primitive
than either. Both mind and matter seem to be composite, and the
stuff of which they are compounded lies in a sense between the
two, in a sense above them both, like a common ancestor. As regards
matter, I have set forth my reasons for this view on former occasions,*
and I shall not now repeat them. But the question of mind is more
difficult, and it is this question that I propose to discuss in
these lectures. A great deal of what I shall have to say is not
original; indeed, much recent work, in various fields, has tended
to show the necessity of such theories as those which I shall
be advocating. Accordingly in this first lecture I shall try to
give a brief description of the systems of ideas within which
our investigation is to be carried on.</p>

<p>If there is one thing that may be said, in the popular estimation,
to characterize mind, that one thing is "consciousness." We say
that we are "conscious" of what we see and hear, of what we remember,
and of our own thoughts and feelings. Most of us believe that
tables and chairs are not "conscious." We think that when we sit
in a chair, we are aware of sitting in it, but it is not aware
of being sat in. It cannot for a moment be doubted that we are
right in believing that there is <em>SOME </em>difference between
us and the chair in this respect: so much may be taken as fact,
and as a datum for our inquiry. But as soon as we try to say what
exactly the difference is, we become involved in perplexities.
Is "consciousness" ultimate and simple, something to be merely
accepted and contemplated? Or is it something complex, perhaps
consisting in our way of behaving in the presence of objects,
or, alternatively, in the existence in us of things called "ideas,"
having a certain relation to objects, though different from them,
and only symbolically representative of them? Such questions are
not easy to answer; but until they are answered we cannot profess
to know what we mean by saying that we are possessed of "consciousness."</p>

<p>Before considering modern theories, let us look first at consciousness
from the standpoint of conventional psychology, since this embodies
views which naturally occur when we begin to reflect upon the
subject. For this purpose, let us as a preliminary consider different
ways of being conscious.</p>

<p>First, there is the way of <em>PERCEPTION. </em>We "perceive"
tables and chairs, horses and dogs, our friends, traffic passing
in the street&mdash;in short, anything which we recognize through the
senses. I leave on one side for the present the question whether
pure sensation is to be regarded as a form of consciousness: what
I am speaking of now is perception, where, according to conventional
psychology, we go beyond the sensation to the "thing" which it
represents. When you hear a donkey bray, you not only hear a noise,
but realize that it comes from a donkey. When you see a table,
you not only see a coloured surface, but realize that it is hard.
The addition of these elements that go beyond crude sensation
is said to constitute perception. We shall have more to say about
this at a later stage. For the moment, I am merely concerned to
note that perception of objects is one of the most obvious examples
of what is called "consciousness." We are "conscious" of anything
that we perceive.</p>

<p>We may take next the way of <em>MEMORY. </em>If I set to work
to recall what I did this morning, that is a form of consciousness
different from perception, since it is concerned with the past.
There are various problems as to how we can be conscious now of
what no longer exists. These will be dealt with incidentally when
we come to the analysis of memory.</p>

<p>From memory it is an easy step to what are called "ideas"&mdash;not
in the Platonic sense, but in that of Locke, Berkeley and Hume,
in which they are opposed to "impressions." You may be conscious
of a friend either by seeing him or by "thinking" of him; and
by "thought" you can be conscious of objects which cannot be seen,
such as the human race, or physiology. "Thought" in the narrower
sense is that form of consciousness which consists in "ideas"
as opposed to impressions or mere memories.</p>

<p>We may end our preliminary catalogue with <em>BELIEF, </em>by
which I mean that way of being conscious which may be either true
or false. We say that a man is "conscious of looking a fool,"
by which we mean that he believes he looks a fool, and is not
mistaken in this belief. This is a different form of consciousness
from any of the earlier ones. It is the form which gives "knowledge"
in the strict sense, and also error. It is, at least apparently,
more complex than our previous forms of consciousness; though
we shall find that they are not so separable from it as they might
appear to be.</p>

<p>Besides ways of being conscious there are other things that would
ordinarily be called "mental," such as desire and pleasure and
pain. These raise problems of their own, which we shall reach
in Lecture <em>III. </em>But the hardest problems are those that
arise concerning ways of being "conscious." These ways, taken
together, are called the "cognitive" elements in mind, and it
is these that will occupy us most during the following lectures.</p>

<p>There is one element which <em>SEEMS </em>obviously in common
among the different ways of being conscious, and that is, that
they are all directed to <em>OBJECTS. </em>We are conscious "of"
something. The consciousness, it seems, is one thing, and that
of which we are conscious is another thing. Unless we are to acquiesce
in the view that we can never be conscious of anything outside
our own minds, we must say that the object of consciousness need
not be mental, though the consciousness must be. (I am speaking
within the circle of conventional doctrines, not expressing my
own beliefs.) This direction towards an object is commonly regarded
as typical of every form of cognition, and sometimes of mental
life altogether. We may distinguish two different tendencies in
traditional psychology. There are those who take mental phenomena
naively, just as they would physical phenomena. This school of
psychologists tends not to emphasize the object. On the other
hand, there are those whose primary interest is in the apparent
fact that we have <em>KNOWLEDGE, </em>that there is a world surrounding
us of which we are aware. These men are interested in the mind
because of its relation to the world, because knowledge, if it
is a fact, is a very mysterious one. Their interest in psychology
is naturally centred in the relation of consciousness to its object,
a problem which, properly, belongs rather to theory of knowledge.
We may take as one of the best and most typical representatives
of this school the Austrian psychologist Brentano, whose "Psychology
from the Empirical Standpoint,"* though published in 1874, is
still influential and was the starting-point of a great deal of
interesting work. He says (p. 115):</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* "Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkte," vol. i, 1874.<br/>
(The second volume was never published.)

</p>
</div>
<p>"Every psychical phenomenon is characterized by what the scholastics
of the Middle Ages called the intentional (also the mental) inexistence
of an object, and what we, although with not quite unambiguous
expressions, would call relation to a content, direction towards
an object (which is not here to be understood as a reality), or
immanent objectivity. Each contains something in itself as an
object, though not each in the same way. In presentation something
is presented, in judgment something is acknowledged or rejected,
in love something is loved, in hatred hated, in desire desired,
and so on.</p>

<p>"This intentional inexistence is exclusively peculiar to psychical
phenomena. No physical phenomenon shows anything similar. And
so we can define psychical phenomena by saying that they are phenomena
which intentionally contain an object in themselves."</p>

<p>The view here expressed, that relation to an object is an ultimate
irreducible characteristic of mental phenomena, is one which I
shall be concerned to combat. Like Brentano, I am interested in
psychology, not so much for its own sake, as for the light that
it may throw on the problem of knowledge. Until very lately I
believed, as he did, that mental phenomena have essential reference
to objects, except possibly in the case of pleasure and pain.
Now I no longer believe this, even in the case of knowledge. I
shall try to make my reasons for this rejection clear as we proceed.
It must be evident at first glance that the analysis of knowledge
is rendered more difficult by the rejection; but the apparent
simplicity of Brentano's view of knowledge will be found, if I
am not mistaken, incapable of maintaining itself either against
an analytic scrutiny or against a host of facts in psycho-analysis
and animal psychology. I do not wish to minimize the problems.
I will merely observe, in mitigation of our prospective labours,
that thinking, however it is to be analysed, is in itself a delightful
occupation, and that there is no enemy to thinking so deadly as
a false simplicity. Travelling, whether in the mental or the physical
world, is a joy, and it is good to know that, in the mental world
at least, there are vast countries still very imperfectly explored.</p>

<p>The view expressed by Brentano has been held very generally,
and developed by many writers. Among these we may take as an example
his Austrian successor Meinong.* According to him there are three
elements involved in the thought of an object. These three he
calls the act, the content and the object. The act is the same
in any two cases of the same kind of consciousness; for instance,
if I think of Smith or think of Brown, the act of thinking, in
itself, is exactly similar on both occasions. But the content
of my thought, the particular event that is happening in my mind,
is different when I think of Smith and when I think of Brown.
The content, Meinong argues, must not be confounded with the object,
since the content must exist in my mind at the moment when I have
the thought, whereas the object need not do so. The object may
be something past or future; it may be physical, not mental; it
may be something abstract, like equality for example; it may be
something imaginary, like a golden mountain; or it may even be
something self-contradictory, like a round square. But in all
these cases, so he contends, the content exists when the thought
exists, and is what distinguishes it, as an occurrence, from other
thoughts.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

und deren Verhaltniss zur inneren Wahrnehmung," "Zeitschrift<br/>
fur Psychologie and Physiologie der Sinnesorgane," vol. xxi,<br/>
pp. 182-272 (1899), especially pp. 185-8.

</p>
</div>
<p>To make this theory concrete, let us suppose that you are thinking
of St. Paul's. Then, according to Meinong, we have to distinguish
three elements which are necessarily combined in constituting
the one thought. First, there is the act of thinking, which would
be just the same whatever you were thinking about. Then there
is what makes the character of the thought as contrasted with
other thoughts; this is the content. And finally there is St.
Paul's, which is the object of your thought. There must be a difference
between the content of a thought and what it is about, since the
thought is here and now, whereas what it is about may not be;
hence it is clear that the thought is not identical with St. Paul's.
This seems to show that we must distinguish between content and
object. But if Meinong is right, there can be no thought without
an object: the connection of the two is essential. The object
might exist without the thought, but not the thought without the
object: the three elements of act, content and object are all
required to constitute the one single occurrence called "thinking
of St. Paul's."</p>

<p>The above analysis of a thought, though I believe it to be mistaken,
is very useful as affording a schema in terms of which other theories
can be stated. In the remainder of the present lecture I shall
state in outline the view which I advocate, and show how various
other views out of which mine has grown result from modifications
of the threefold analysis into act, content and object.</p>

<p>The first criticism I have to make is that the <em>ACT </em>seems
unnecessary and fictitious. The occurrence of the content of a
thought constitutes the occurrence of the thought. Empirically,
I cannot discover anything corresponding to the supposed act;
and theoretically I cannot see that it is indispensable. We say:
"<em>I</em> think so-and-so," and this word "I" suggests that
thinking is the act of a person. Meinong's "act" is the ghost
of the subject, or what once was the full-blooded soul. It is
supposed that thoughts cannot just come and go, but need a person
to think them. Now, of course it is true that thoughts can be
collected into bundles, so that one bundle is my thoughts, another
is your thoughts, and a third is the thoughts of Mr. Jones. But
I think the person is not an ingredient in the single thought:
he is rather constituted by relations of the thoughts to each
other and to the body. This is a large question, which need not,
in its entirety, concern us at present. All that I am concerned
with for the moment is that the grammatical forms "I think," "you
think," and "Mr. Jones thinks," are misleading if regarded as
indicating an analysis of a single thought. It would be better
to say "it thinks in me," like "it rains here"; or better still,
"there is a thought in me." This is simply on the ground that
what Meinong calls the act in thinking is not empirically discoverable,
or logically deducible from what we can observe.</p>

<p>The next point of criticism concerns the relation of content
and object. The reference of thoughts to objects is not, I believe,
the simple direct essential thing that Brentano and Meinong represent
it as being. It seems to me to be derivative, and to consist largely
in <em>BELIEFS: </em>beliefs that what constitutes the thought
is connected with various other elements which together make up
the object. You have, say, an image of St. Paul's, or merely the
word "St. Paul's" in your head. You believe, however vaguely and
dimly, that this is connected with what you would see if you went
to St. Paul's, or what you would feel if you touched its walls;
it is further connected with what other people see and feel, with
services and the Dean and Chapter and Sir Christopher Wren. These
things are not mere thoughts of yours, but your thought stands
in a relation to them of which you are more or less aware. The
awareness of this relation is a further thought, and constitutes
your feeling that the original thought had an "object." But in
pure imagination you can get very similar thoughts without these
accompanying beliefs; and in this case your thoughts do not have
objects or seem to have them. Thus in such instances you have
content without object. On the other hand, in seeing or hearing
it would be less misleading to say that you have object without
content, since what you see or hear is actually part of the physical
world, though not matter in the sense of physics. Thus the whole
question of the relation of mental occurrences to objects grows
very complicated, and cannot be settled by regarding reference
to objects as of the essence of thoughts. All the above remarks
are merely preliminary, and will be expanded later.</p>

<p>Speaking in popular and unphilosophical terms, we may say that
the content of a thought is supposed to be something in your head
when you think the thought, while the object is usually something
in the outer world. It is held that knowledge of the outer world
is constituted by the relation to the object, while the fact that
knowledge is different from what it knows is due to the fact that
knowledge comes by way of contents. We can begin to state the
difference between realism and idealism in terms of this opposition
of contents and objects. Speaking quite roughly and approximately,
we may say that idealism tends to suppress the object, while realism
tends to suppress the content. Idealism, accordingly, says that
nothing can be known except thoughts, and all the reality that
we know is mental; while realism maintains that we know objects
directly, in sensation certainly, and perhaps also in memory and
thought. Idealism does not say that nothing can be known beyond
the present thought, but it maintains that the context of vague
belief, which we spoke of in connection with the thought of St.
Paul's, only takes you to other thoughts, never to anything radically
different from thoughts. The difficulty of this view is in regard
to sensation, where it seems as if we came into direct contact
with the outer world. But the Berkeleian way of meeting this difficulty
is so familiar that I need not enlarge upon it now. I shall return
to it in a later lecture, and will only observe, for the present,
that there seem to me no valid grounds for regarding what we see
and hear as not part of the physical world.</p>

<p>Realists, on the other hand, as a rule, suppress the content,
and maintain that a thought consists either of act and object
alone, or of object alone. I have been in the past a realist,
and I remain a realist as regards sensation, but not as regards
memory or thought. I will try to explain what seem to me to be
the reasons for and against various kinds of realism.</p>

<p>Modern idealism professes to be by no means confined to the present
thought or the present thinker in regard to its knowledge; indeed,
it contends that the world is so organic, so dove-tailed, that
from any one portion the whole can be inferred, as the complete
skeleton of an extinct animal can be inferred from one bone. But
the logic by which this supposed organic nature of the world is
nominally demonstrated appears to realists, as it does to me,
to be faulty. They argue that, if we cannot know the physical
world directly, we cannot really know any thing outside our own
minds: the rest of the world may be merely our dream. This is
a dreary view, and they there fore seek ways of escaping from
it. Accordingly they maintain that in knowledge we are in direct
contact with objects, which may be, and usually are, outside our
own minds. No doubt they are prompted to this view, in the first
place, by bias, namely, by the desire to think that they can know
of the existence of a world outside themselves. But we have to
consider, not what led them to desire the view, but whether their
arguments for it are valid.</p>

<p>There are two different kinds of realism, according as we make
a thought consist of act and object, or of object alone. Their
difficulties are different, but neither seems tenable all through.
Take, for the sake of definiteness, the remembering of a past
event. The remembering occurs now, and is therefore necessarily
not identical with the past event. So long as we retain the act,
this need cause no difficulty. The act of remembering occurs now,
and has on this view a certain essential relation to the past
event which it remembers. There is no <em>LOGICAL </em>objection
to this theory, but there is the objection, which we spoke of
earlier, that the act seems mythical, and is not to be found by
observation. If, on the other hand, we try to constitute memory
without the act, we are driven to a content, since we must have
something that happens <em>NOW, </em>as opposed to the event which
happened in the past. Thus, when we reject the act, which I think
we must, we are driven to a theory of memory which is more akin
to idealism. These arguments, however, do not apply to sensation.
It is especially sensation, I think, which is considered by those
realists who retain only the object.* Their views, which are chiefly
held in America, are in large measure derived from William James,
and before going further it will be well to consider the revolutionary
doctrine which he advocated. I believe this doctrine contains
important new truth, and what I shall have to say will be in a
considerable measure inspired by it.</p>

Sensations," a book of fundamental importance in the present<br/>

</p>
</div>
<p>William James's view was first set forth in an essay called "Does
'consciousness' exist?"* In this essay he explains how what used
to be the soul has gradually been refined down to the "transcendental
ego," which, he says, "attenuates itself to a thoroughly ghostly
condition, being only a name for the fact that the 'content' of
experience IS <em>KNOWN. </em>It loses personal form and activity&mdash;these
passing over to the content&mdash;and becomes a bare Bewusstheit or
Bewusstsein uberhaupt, of which in its own right absolutely nothing
can be said. I believe (he continues) that 'consciousness,' when
once it has evaporated to this estate of pure diaphaneity, is
on the point of disappearing altogether. It is the name of a nonentity,
and has no right to a place among first principles. Those who
still cling to it are clinging to a mere echo, the faint rumour
left behind by the disappearing 'soul' upon the air of philosophy"(p.
2).</p>

Methods," vol. i, 1904. Reprinted in "Essays in Radical<br/>
Empiricism" (Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1912), pp. 1-38, to<br/>
which references in what follows refer.

</p>
</div>
<p>He explains that this is no sudden change in his opinions. "For
twenty years past," he says, "I have mistrusted 'consciousness'
as an entity; for seven or eight years past I have suggested its
non-existence to my students, and tried to give them its pragmatic
equivalent in realities of experience. It seems to me that the
hour is ripe for it to be openly and universally discarded"(p.
3).</p>

<p>His next concern is to explain away the air of paradox, for James
was never wilfully paradoxical. "Undeniably," he says, "'thoughts'
do exist." "I mean only to deny that the word stands for an entity,
but to insist most emphatically that it does stand for a function.
There is, I mean, no aboriginal stuff or quality of being, contrasted
with that of which material objects are made, out of which our
thoughts of them are made; but there is a function in experience
which thoughts perform, and for the performance of which this
quality of being is invoked. That function is <em>KNOWING"(</em>pp.
3-4).</p>

<p>James's view is that the raw material out of which the world
is built up is not of two sorts, one matter and the other mind,
but that it is arranged in different patterns by its inter-relations,
and that some arrangements may be called mental, while others
may be called physical.</p>

<p>"My thesis is," he says, "that if we start with the supposition
that there is only one primal stuff or material in the world,
a stuff of which everything is composed, and if we call that stuff
'pure experience,' then knowing can easily be explained as a particular
sort of relation towards one another into which portions of pure
experience may enter. The relation itself is a part of pure experience;
one of its 'terms' becomes the subject or bearer of the knowledge,
the knower, the other becomes the object known"(p. 4).</p>

<p>After mentioning the duality of subject and object, which is
supposed to constitute consciousness, he proceeds in italics:
"<em>EXPERIENCE, I BELIEVE, HAS NO SUCH INNER DUPLICITY; AND THE
SEPARATION OF IT INTO CONSCIOUSNESS AND CONTENT COMES, NOT BY
WAY OF SUBTRACTION, BUT BY WAY OF ADDITION"(</em>p. 9).</p>

<p>He illustrates his meaning by the analogy of paint as it appears
in a paint-shop and as it appears in a picture: in the one case
it is just "saleable matter," while in the other it "performs
a spiritual function. Just so, I maintain (he continues), does
a given undivided portion of experience, taken in one context
of associates, play the part of a knower, of a state of mind,
of 'consciousness'; while in a different context the same undivided
bit of experience plays the part of a thing known, of an objective
'content.' In a word, in one group it figures as a thought, in
another group as a thing"(pp. 9-10).</p>

<p>He does not believe in the supposed immediate certainty of thought.
"Let the case be what it may in others," he says, "I am as confident
as I am of anything that, in myself, the stream of thinking (which
I recognize emphatically as a phenomenon) is only a careless name
for what, when scrutinized, reveals itself to consist chiefly
of the stream of my breathing. The 'I think' which Kant said must
be able to accompany all my objects, is the 'I breathe' which
actually does accompany them"(pp. 36-37).</p>

<p>The same view of "consciousness" is set forth in the succeeding
essay, "A World of Pure Experience" (ib., pp. 39-91). The use
of the phrase "pure experience" in both essays points to a lingering
influence of idealism. "Experience," like "consciousness," must
be a product, not part of the primary stuff of the world. It must
be possible, if James is right in his main contentions, that roughly
the same stuff, differently arranged, would not give rise to anything
that could be called "experience." This word has been dropped
by the American realists, among whom we may mention specially
Professor R. B. Perry of Harvard and Mr. Edwin B. Holt. The interests
of this school are in general philosophy and the philosophy of
the sciences, rather than in psychology; they have derived a strong
impulsion from James, but have more interest than he had in logic
and mathematics and the abstract part of philosophy. They speak
of "neutral" entities as the stuff out of which both mind and
matter are constructed. Thus Holt says: "If the terms and propositions
of logic must be substantialized, they are all strictly of one
substance, for which perhaps the least dangerous name is neutral-stuff.
The relation of neutral-stuff to matter and mind we shall have
presently to consider at considerable length." *</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>My own belief&mdash;for which the reasons will appear in subsequent
lectures&mdash;is that James is right in rejecting consciousness as
an entity, and that the American realists are partly right, though
not wholly, in considering that both mind and matter are composed
of a neutral-stuff which, in isolation, is neither mental nor
material. I should admit this view as regards sensations: what
is heard or seen belongs equally to psychology and to physics.
But I should say that images belong only to the mental world,
while those occurrences (if any) which do not form part of any
"experience" belong only to the physical world. There are, it
seems to me, prima facie different kinds of causal laws, one belonging
to physics and the other to psychology. The law of gravitation,
for example, is a physical law, while the law of association is
a psychological law. Sensations are subject to both kinds of laws,
and are therefore truly "neutral" in Holt's sense. But entities
subject only to physical laws, or only to psychological laws,
are not neutral, and may be called respectively purely material
and purely mental. Even those, however, which are purely mental
will not have that intrinsic reference to objects which Brentano
assigns to them and which constitutes the essence of "consciousness"
as ordinarily understood. But it is now time to pass on to other
modern tendencies, also hostile to "consciousness."</p>

<p>There is a psychological school called "Behaviourists," of whom
the protagonist is Professor John B. Watson,* formerly of the
Johns Hopkins University. To them also, on the whole, belongs
Professor John Dewey, who, with James and Dr. Schiller, was one
of the three founders of pragmatism. The view of the "behaviourists"
is that nothing can be known except by external observation. They
deny altogether that there is a separate source of knowledge called
"introspection," by which we can know things about ourselves which
we could never observe in others. They do not by any means deny
that all sorts of things <em>MAY </em>go on in our minds: they
only say that such things, if they occur, are not susceptible
of scientific observation, and do not therefore concern psychology
as a science. Psychology as a science, they say, is only concerned
with <em>BEHAVIOUR, </em>i.e. with what we DO; this alone, they
contend, can be accurately observed. Whether we think meanwhile,
they tell us, cannot be known; in their observation of the behaviour
of human beings, they have not so far found any evidence of thought.
True, we talk a great deal, and imagine that in so doing we are
showing that we can think; but behaviourists say that the talk
they have to listen to can be explained without supposing that
people think. Where you might expect a chapter on "thought processes"
you come instead upon a chapter on "The Language Habit." It is
humiliating to find how terribly adequate this hypothesis turns
out to be.</p>

<p>Behaviourism has not, however, sprung from observing the folly
of men. It is the wisdom of animals that has suggested the view.
It has always been a common topic of popular discussion whether
animals "think." On this topic people are prepared to take sides
without having the vaguest idea what they mean by "thinking."
Those who desired to investigate such questions were led to observe
the behaviour of animals, in the hope that their behaviour would
throw some light on their mental faculties. At first sight, it
might seem that this is so. People say that a dog "knows" its
name because it comes when it is called, and that it "remembers"
its master, because it looks sad in his absence, but wags its
tail and barks when he returns. That the dog behaves in this way
is matter of observation, but that it "knows" or "remembers" anything
is an inference, and in fact a very doubtful one. The more such
inferences are examined, the more precarious they are seen to
be. Hence the study of animal behaviour has been gradually led
to abandon all attempt at mental interpretation. And it can hardly
be doubted that, in many cases of complicated behaviour very well
adapted to its ends, there can be no prevision of those ends.
The first time a bird builds a nest, we can hardly suppose it
knows that there will be eggs to be laid in it, or that it will
sit on the eggs, or that they will hatch into young birds. It
does what it does at each stage because instinct gives it an impulse
to do just that, not because it foresees and desires the result
of its actions.*</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
* An interesting discussion of the question whether<br/>
instinctive actions, when first performed, involve any<br/>
prevision, however vague, will be found in Lloyd Morgan's<br/>
"Instinct and Experience" (Methuen, 1912), chap. ii.

</p>
</div>
<p>Careful observers of animals, being anxious to avoid precarious
inferences, have gradually discovered more and more how to give
an account of the actions of animals without assuming what we
call "consciousness." It has seemed to the behaviourists that
similar methods can be applied to human behaviour, without assuming
anything not open to external observation. Let us give a crude
illustration, too crude for the authors in question, but capable
of affording a rough insight into their meaning. Suppose two children
in a school, both of whom are asked "What is six times nine?"
One says fifty-four, the other says fifty-six. The one, we say,
"knows" what six times nine is, the other does not. But all that
we can observe is a certain language-habit. The one child has
acquired the habit of saying "six times nine is fifty-four"; the
other has not. There is no more need of "thought" in this than
there is when a horse turns into his accustomed stable; there
are merely more numerous and complicated habits. There is obviously
an observable fact called "knowing" such-and-such a thing; examinations
are experiments for discovering such facts. But all that is observed
or discovered is a certain set of habits in the use of words.
The thoughts (if any) in the mind of the examinee are of no interest
to the examiner; nor has the examiner any reason to suppose even
the most successful examinee capable of even the smallest amount
of thought.</p>

<p>Thus what is called "knowing," in the sense in which we can ascertain
what other people "know," is a phenomenon exemplified in their
physical behaviour, including spoken and written words. There
is no reason&mdash;so Watson argues&mdash;to suppose that their knowledge
IS anything beyond the habits shown in this behaviour: the inference
that other people have something nonphysical called "mind" or
"thought" is therefore unwarranted.</p>

<p>So far, there is nothing particularly repugnant to our prejudices
in the conclusions of the behaviourists. We are all willing to
admit that other people are thoughtless. But when it comes to
ourselves, we feel convinced that we can actually perceive our
own thinking. "Cogito, ergo sum" would be regarded by most people
as having a true premiss. This, however, the behaviourist denies.
He maintains that our knowledge of ourselves is no different in
kind from our knowledge of other people. We may see <em>MORE,
</em>because our own body is easier to observe than that of other
people; but we do not see anything radically unlike what we see
of others. Introspection, as a separate source of knowledge, is
entirely denied by psychologists of this school. I shall discuss
this question at length in a later lecture; for the present I
will only observe that it is by no means simple, and that, though
I believe the behaviourists somewhat overstate their case, yet
there is an important element of truth in their contention, since
the things which we can discover by introspection do not seem
to differ in any very fundamental way from the things which we
discover by external observation.</p>

<p>So far, we have been principally concerned with knowing. But
it might well be maintained that desiring is what is really most
characteristic of mind. Human beings are constantly engaged in
achieving some end they feel pleasure in success and pain in failure.
In a purely material world, it may be said, there would be no
opposition of pleasant and unpleasant, good and bad, what is desired
and what is feared. A man's acts are governed by purposes. He
decides, let us suppose, to go to a certain place, whereupon he
proceeds to the station, takes his ticket and enters the train.
If the usual route is blocked by an accident, he goes by some
other route. All that he does is determined&mdash;or so it seems&mdash;by
the end he has in view, by what lies in front of him, rather than
by what lies behind. With dead matter, this is not the case. A
stone at the top of a hill may start rolling, but it shows no
pertinacity in trying to get to the bottom. Any ledge or obstacle
will stop it, and it will exhibit no signs of discontent if this
happens. It is not attracted by the pleasantness of the valley,
as a sheep or cow might be, but propelled by the steepness of
the hill at the place where it is. In all this we have characteristic
differences between the behaviour of animals and the behaviour
of matter as studied by physics.</p>

<p>Desire, like knowledge, is, of course, in one sense an observable
phenomenon. An elephant will eat a bun, but not a mutton chop;
a duck will go into the water, but a hen will not. But when we
think of our own desires, most people believe that we can know
them by an immediate self-knowledge which does not depend upon
observation of our actions. Yet if this were the case, it would
be odd that people are so often mistaken as to what they desire.
It is matter of common observation that "so-and-so does not know
his own motives," or that "A is envious of B and malicious about
him, but quite unconscious of being so." Such people are called
self-deceivers, and are supposed to have had to go through some
more or less elaborate process of concealing from themselves what
would otherwise have been obvious. I believe that this is an entire
mistake. I believe that the discovery of our own motives can only
be made by the same process by which we discover other people's,
namely, the process of observing our actions and inferring the
desire which could prompt them. A desire is "conscious" when we
have told ourselves that we have it. A hungry man may say to himself:
"Oh, I do want my lunch." Then his desire is "conscious." But
it only differs from an "unconscious" desire by the presence of
appropriate words, which is by no means a fundamental difference.</p>

<p>The belief that a motive is normally conscious makes it easier
to be mistaken as to our own motives than as to other people's.
When some desire that we should be ashamed of is attributed to
us, we notice that we have never had it consciously, in the sense
of saying to ourselves, "I wish that would happen." We therefore
look for some other interpretation of our actions, and regard
our friends as very unjust when they refuse to be convinced by
our repudiation of what we hold to be a calumny. Moral considerations
greatly increase the difficulty of clear thinking in this matter.
It is commonly argued that people are not to blame for unconscious
motives, but only for conscious ones. In order, therefore, to
be wholly virtuous it is only necessary to repeat virtuous formulas.
We say: "I desire to be kind to my friends, honourable in business,
philanthropic towards the poor, public-spirited in politics."
So long as we refuse to allow ourselves, even in the watches of
the night, to avow any contrary desires, we may be bullies at
home, shady in the City, skinflints in paying wages and profiteers
in dealing with the public; yet, if only conscious motives are
to count in moral valuation, we shall remain model characters.
This is an agreeable doctrine, and it is not surprising that men
are un willing to abandon it. But moral considerations are the
worst enemies of the scientific spirit and we must dismiss them
from our minds if we wish to arrive at truth.</p>

<p>I believe&mdash;as I shall try to prove in a later lecture&mdash;that desire,
like force in mechanics, is of the nature of a convenient fiction
for describing shortly certain laws of behaviour. A hungry animal
is restless until it finds food; then it becomes quiescent. The
thing which will bring a restless condition to an end is said
to be what is desired. But only experience can show what will
have this sedative effect, and it is easy to make mistakes. We
feel dissatisfaction, and think that such and-such a thing would
remove it; but in thinking this, we are theorizing, not observing
a patent fact. Our theorizing is often mistaken, and when it is
mistaken there is a difference between what we think we desire
and what in fact will bring satisfaction. This is such a common
phenomenon that any theory of desire which fails to account for
it must be wrong.</p>

<p>What have been called "unconscious" desires have been brought
very much to the fore in recent years by psycho-analysis. Psycho-analysis,
as every one knows, is primarily a method of understanding hysteria
and certain forms of insanity*; but it has been found that there
is much in the lives of ordinary men and women which bears a humiliating
resemblance to the delusions of the insane. The connection of
dreams, irrational beliefs and foolish actions with unconscious
wishes has been brought to light, though with some exaggeration,
by Freud and Jung and their followers. As regards the nature of
these unconscious wishes, it seems to me&mdash;though as a layman I
speak with diffidence&mdash;that many psycho-analysts are unduly narrow;
no doubt the wishes they emphasize exist, but others, e.g. for
honour and power, are equally operative and equally liable to
concealment. This, however, does not affect the value of their
general theories from the point of view of theoretic psychology,
and it is from this point of view that their results are important
for the analysis of mind.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* There is a wide field of "unconscious" phenomena which<br/>
does not depend upon psycho-analytic theories. Such<br/>
occurrences as automatic writing lead Dr. Morton Prince to<br/>
say: "As I view this question of the subconscious, far too<br/>
much weight is given to the point of awareness or not<br/>
awareness of our conscious processes. As a matter of fact,<br/>
we find entirely identical phenomena, that is, identical in<br/>
every respect but one-that of awareness in which sometimes<br/>
we are aware of these conscious phenomena and sometimes<br/>
not"(p. 87 of "Subconscious Phenomena," by various authors,<br/>
Rebman). Dr. Morton Price conceives that there may be<br/>
"consciousness" without "awareness." But this is a difficult<br/>
view, and one which makes some definition of "consciousness"<br/>
imperative. For nay part, I cannot see how to separate<br/>
consciousness from awareness.

</p>
</div>
<p>What, I think, is clearly established, is that a man's actions
and beliefs may be wholly dominated by a desire of which he is
quite unconscious, and which he indignantly repudiates when it
is suggested to him. Such a desire is generally, in morbid cases,
of a sort which the patient would consider wicked; if he had to
admit that he had the desire, he would loathe himself. Yet it
is so strong that it must force an outlet for itself; hence it
becomes necessary to entertain whole systems of false beliefs
in order to hide the nature of what is desired. The resulting
delusions in very many cases disappear if the hysteric or lunatic
can be made to face the facts about himself. The consequence of
this is that the treatment of many forms of insanity has grown
more psychological and less physiological than it used to be.
Instead of looking for a physical defect in the brain, those who
treat delusions look for the repressed desire which has found
this contorted mode of expression. For those who do not wish to
plunge into the somewhat repulsive and often rather wild theories
of psychoanalytic pioneers, it will be worth while to read a little
book by Dr. Bernard Hart on "The Psychology of Insanity."* On
this question of the mental as opposed to the physiological study
of the causes of insanity, Dr. Hart says:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* Cambridge, 1912; 2nd edition, 1914. The following<br/>
references are to the second edition.

</p>
</div>
<p>"The psychological conception [of insanity] is based on the view
that mental processes can be directly studied without any reference
to the accompanying changes which are presumed to take place in
the brain, and that insanity may therefore be properly attacked
from the standpoint of psychology"(p. 9).</p>

<p>This illustrates a point which I am anxious to make clear from
the outset. Any attempt to classify modern views, such as I propose
to advocate, from the old standpoint of materialism and idealism,
is only misleading. In certain respects, the views which I shall
be setting forth approximate to materialism; in certain others,
they approximate to its opposite. On this question of the study
of delusions, the practical effect of the modern theories, as
Dr. Hart points out, is emancipation from the materialist method.
On the other hand, as he also points out (pp. 38-9), imbecility
and dementia still have to be considered physiologically, as caused
by defects in the brain. There is no inconsistency in this If,
as we maintain, mind and matter are neither of them the actual
stuff of reality, but different convenient groupings of an underlying
material, then, clearly, the question whether, in regard to a
given phenomenon, we are to seek a physical or a mental cause,
is merely one to be decided by trial. Metaphysicians have argued
endlessly as to the interaction of mind and matter. The followers
of Descartes held that mind and matter are so different as to
make any action of the one on the other impossible. When I will
to move my arm, they said, it is not my will that operates on
my arm, but God, who, by His omnipotence, moves my arm whenever
I want it moved. The modern doctrine of psychophysical parallelism
is not appreciably different from this theory of the Cartesian
school. Psycho-physical parallelism is the theory that mental
and physical events each have causes in their own sphere, but
run on side by side owing to the fact that every state of the
brain coexists with a definite state of the mind, and vice versa.
This view of the reciprocal causal independence of mind and matter
has no basis except in metaphysical theory.* For us, there is
no necessity to make any such assumption, which is very difficult
to harmonize with obvious facts. I receive a letter inviting me
to dinner: the letter is a physical fact, but my apprehension
of its meaning is mental. Here we have an effect of matter on
mind. In consequence of my apprehension of the meaning of the
letter, I go to the right place at the right time; here we have
an effect of mind on matter. I shall try to persuade you, in the
course of these lectures, that matter is not so material and mind
not so mental as is generally supposed. When we are speaking of
matter, it will seem as if we were inclining to idealism; when
we are speaking of mind, it will seem as if we were inclining
to materialism. Neither is the truth. Our world is to be constructed
out of what the American realists call "neutral" entities, which
have neither the hardness and indestructibility of matter, nor
the reference to objects which is supposed to characterize mind.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* It would seem, however, that Dr. Hart accepts this theory<br/>
as 8 methodological precept. See his contribution to<br/>
"Subconscious Phenomena" (quoted above), especially pp. 121-2.

</p>
</div>
<p>There is, it is true, one objection which might be felt, not
indeed to the action of matter on mind, but to the action of mind
on matter. The laws of physics, it may be urged, are apparently
adequate to explain everything that happens to matter, even when
it is matter in a man's brain. This, however, is only a hypothesis,
not an established theory. There is no cogent empirical reason
for supposing that the laws determining the motions of living
bodies are exactly the same as those that apply to dead matter.
Sometimes, of course, they are clearly the same. When a man falls
from a precipice or slips on a piece of orange peel, his body
behaves as if it were devoid of life. These are the occasions
that make Bergson laugh. But when a man's bodily movements are
what we call "voluntary," they are, at any rate prima facie, very
different in their laws from the movements of what is devoid of
life. I do not wish to say dogmatically that the difference is
irreducible; I think it highly probable that it is not. I say
only that the study of the behaviour of living bodies, in the
present state of our knowledge, is distinct from physics. The
study of gases was originally quite distinct from that of rigid
bodies, and would never have advanced to its present state if
it had not been independently pursued. Nowadays both the gas and
the rigid body are manufactured out of a more primitive and universal
kind of matter. In like manner, as a question of methodology,
the laws of living bodies are to be studied, in the first place,
without any undue haste to subordinate them to the laws of physics.
Boyle's law and the rest had to be discovered before the kinetic
theory of gases became possible. But in psychology we are hardly
yet at the stage of Boyle's law. Meanwhile we need not be held
up by the bogey of the universal rigid exactness of physics. This
is, as yet, a mere hypothesis, to be tested empirically without
any preconceptions. It may be true, or it may not. So far, that
is all we can say.</p>

<p>Returning from this digression to our main topic, namely, the
criticism of "consciousness," we observe that Freud and his followers,
though they have demonstrated beyond dispute the immense importance
of "unconscious" desires in determining our actions and beliefs,
have not attempted the task of telling us what an "unconscious"
desire actually is, and have thus invested their doctrine with
an air of mystery and mythology which forms a large part of its
popular attractiveness. They speak always as though it were more
normal for a desire to be conscious, and as though a positive
cause had to be assigned for its being unconscious. Thus "the
unconscious" becomes a sort of underground prisoner, living in
a dungeon, breaking in at long intervals upon our daylight respectability
with dark groans and maledictions and strange atavistic lusts.
The ordinary reader, almost inevitably, thinks of this underground
person as another consciousness, prevented by what Freud calls
the "censor" from making his voice heard in company, except on
rare and dreadful occasions when he shouts so loud that every
one hears him and there is a scandal. Most of us like the idea
that we could be desperately wicked if only we let ourselves go.
For this reason, the Freudian "unconscious" has been a consolation
to many quiet and well-behaved persons.</p>

<p>I do not think the truth is quite so picturesque as this. I believe
an "unconscious" desire is merely a causal law of our behaviour,*
namely, that we remain restlessly active until a certain state
of affairs is realized, when we achieve temporary equilibrium
If we know beforehand what this state of affairs is, our desire
is conscious; if not, unconscious. The unconscious desire is not
something actually existing, but merely a tendency to a certain
behaviour; it has exactly the same status as a force in dynamics.
The unconscious desire is in no way mysterious; it is the natural
primitive form of desire, from which the other has developed through
our habit of observing and theorizing (often wrongly). It is not
necessary to suppose, as Freud seems to do, that every unconscious
wish was once conscious, and was then, in his terminology, "repressed"
because we disapproved of it. On the contrary, we shall suppose
that, although Freudian "repression" undoubtedly occurs and is
important, it is not the usual reason for unconsciousness of our
wishes. The usual reason is merely that wishes are all, to begin
with, unconscious, and only become known when they are actively
noticed. Usually, from laziness, people do not notice, but accept
the theory of human nature which they find current, and attribute
to themselves whatever wishes this theory would lead them to expect.
We used to be full of virtuous wishes, but since Freud our wishes
have become, in the words of the Prophet Jeremiah, "deceitful
above all things and desperately wicked." Both these views, in
most of those who have held them, are the product of theory rather
than observation, for observation requires effort, whereas repeating
phrases does not.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* Cf. Hart, "The Psychology of Insanity," p. 19.

</p>
</div>
<p>The interpretation of unconscious wishes which I have been advocating
has been set forth briefly by Professor John B. Watson in an article
called "The Psychology of Wish Fulfilment," which appeared in
"The Scientific Monthly" in November, 1916. Two quotations will
serve to show his point of view:</p>

<p>"The Freudians (he says) have made more or less of a 'metaphysical
entity' out of the censor. They suppose that when wishes are repressed
they are repressed into the 'unconscious,' and that this mysterious
censor stands at the trapdoor lying between the conscious and
the unconscious. Many of us do not believe in a world of the unconscious
(a few of us even have grave doubts about the usefulness of the
term consciousness), hence we try to explain censorship along
ordinary biological lines. We believe that one group of habits
can 'down' another group of habits&mdash;or instincts. In this case
our ordinary system of habits&mdash;those which we call expressive
of our 'real selves'&mdash;inhibit or quench (keep inactive or partially
inactive) those habits and instinctive tendencies which belong
largely in the past"(p. 483).</p>

<p>Again, after speaking of the frustration of some impulses which
is involved in acquiring the habits of a civilized adult, he continues:</p>

<p>"It is among these frustrated impulses that I would find the
biological basis of the unfulfilled wish. Such 'wishes' need never
have been 'conscious,' and <em>NEED NEVER HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED
INTO FREUD'S REALM OF THE UNCONSCIOUS. </em>It may be inferred
from this that there is no particular reason for applying the
term 'wish' to such tendencies"(p. 485).</p>

<p>One of the merits of the general analysis of mind which we shall
be concerned with in the following lectures is that it removes
the atmosphere of mystery from the phenomena brought to light
by the psycho-analysts. Mystery is delightful, but unscientific,
since it depends upon ignorance. Man has developed out of the
animals, and there is no serious gap between him and the amoeba.
Something closely analogous to knowledge and desire, as regards
its effects on behaviour, exists among animals, even where what
we call "consciousness" is hard to believe in; something equally
analogous exists in ourselves in cases where no trace of "consciousness"
can be found. It is therefore natural to suppose that, what ever
may be the correct definition of "consciousness," "consciousness"
is not the essence of life or mind. In the following lectures,
accordingly, this term will disappear until we have dealt with
words, when it will re-emerge as mainly a trivial and unimportant
outcome of linguistic habits.</p>
