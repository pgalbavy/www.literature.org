<p>“Well, come along now, pony. I’ll see how many tricks you know and how
many I can teach you.”
</p><p>It was the circus man who had bought Tinkle who was speaking, but
Tinkle was so taken up with looking about him, at the strange sights
all round that he did not at first listen.
</p><p>“Come along!” called the man again, and then Tinkle heard a whistle.
This time he turned around quickly. For a moment he thought his dear
little master George had come for him, but he saw only the circus man,
and other strange men and animals all about.
</p><p>“It must have been the man who whistled to me,” said Tinkle to himself.
“I guess, though, he wants me to come with him, as George used to want
me to go with him when he whistled. I’ll go.”
</p><p>So Tinkle followed the man, which was just what the man wanted. He led
Tinkle along by the rope made fast to his halter.
</p><p>“Well, you know something, to start with,” said the circus man,
smiling at Tinkle. The pony, of course, did not know what a smile
meant, but he did know that the man spoke in kind tones and not sharp
and cross as had the moving men, sometimes. Besides the circus man
talked <u>to</u> the pony, and the other men had not.
</p><p>So Tinkle knew by the voice that the man was kind, and he followed him
to a little tent where there were many other ponies. In a tent next
door were big horses, and they were all either eating hay or oats, or
lying down on the straw, for it was not yet time for the circus to
begin.
</p><p>“Here is a new pony I have bought, Tom,” said the first man to one who
had charge of the ponies. “He can do a few tricks and I am going to
teach him more. Look after him, and clean him off. He doesn’t seem to
have been well taken care of.”
</p><p>“That’s right, Mr. Drake; he doesn’t,” answered Tom. “I’ll take good
care of him, though.”
</p><p>Poor Tinkle’s hairy coat was in a sad state. It was dirty and bits of
hay and straw clung to it. Also his mane and tail were tangled. Tinkle
had been kept very clean by Patrick and George, but the moving men
spent no time on the pony they had stolen.
</p><p>“First to clean you up,” said Tom, talking to himself, but also, in a
way, speaking to Tinkle. “Then we’ll see about your tricks. Mr. Drake
is a good pony teacher.”
</p><p>Though Tinkle could understand very little of this talk, yet, somehow,
he felt happier than he had in a long while――in fact since he had been
taken away from George.
</p><p>With a brush, a currycomb, and a cloth Tom cleaned Tinkle’s hairy coat
until it began to shine and glisten almost as it had when he lived in
the nice Farley stable.
</p><p>“That will do for a while,” said Tom. “Now I’ll get you something to
eat. Come along, pony,” and he whistled just as George used to do.
Tinkle liked to hear a clear, cheerful whistle.
</p><p>Tinkle was tied in the tent with the other ponies. His stall was just a
place between two ropes, and his manger made of canvas, for the tent,
and everything in it, had to be moved from place to place as the circus
traveled, and wooden stalls, such as are in barns, would never do. In
the manger were some hay and oats. Tinkle began to eat hungrily. It was
almost as good as being home again.
</p><p>“Well, where in the world did you come from?” asked a pony on Tinkle’s
left side.
</p><p>“Yes, tell us about yourself,” added another on the right side. “You
are a stranger. I never saw you in the circus before.”
</p><p>“I just came to-day,” said Tinkle, after he had swallowed some of the
hay and oats. “I never was with a circus before. Is it nice?”
</p><p>“Oh, it’s lots of fun,” said the pony on the left, whose name was Tiny
Tim. “It’s jolly!”
</p><p>“We have great times doing tricks,” said the pony on Tinkle’s right,
and his name was Prancer. “We do lots of tricks. Can you do any,
Tinkle?” for the new pony had told his name.
</p><p>“I can make a bow, jump over a rope and walk on my hind legs.”
</p><p>“Those are all good tricks,” said Tiny Tim, “but you will have to learn
many more if you are to stay with this circus.”
</p><p>“I guess the man they call Mr. Drake will teach Tinkle tricks,”
remarked Prancer. “He taught me all I know. Why, would you believe,” he
went on, “when first I joined the circus I couldn’t do a single thing!”
</p><p>“Can you do many tricks now?” asked Tinkle.
</p><p>“I should say he could!” cried Tiny Tim, with a laughing whinny. “He is
the best trick pony in the circus!”
</p><p>“Oh, not the <u>best</u>,” protested Prancer modestly. “I can do a <u>few</u>
tricks, it is true, but――”
</p><p>“Now you let me tell!” interrupted Tiny Tim, laughing. “You can jump
over a barrel, stand up on a platform on your hind legs and turn
around, you can pick up different colored flags, count, add up numbers
on a blackboard and take letters from the post-office.
</p><p>“Well, yes, I can do those things,” said Prancer.
</p><p>“My! What a lot of tricks!” cried Tinkle. “I wonder if I shall ever be
able to do even half that many?”
</p><p>“Of course you will,” said Prancer kindly. “You wait; Mr. Drake will
teach you as he taught me.”
</p><p>All this while many things were going on about the circus grounds. The
big tents had been put up, the animal cages wheeled in, the clowns were
painting their faces in such funny ways to make the boys and girls
laugh, and the big, golden wagons were being made ready for the parade.
A band was playing, the pretty flags were blowing in the wind, and,
altogether, the circus was such a nice place that, for the first time
in a long while, Tinkle felt happy. But when he thought of George and
the nice home he had been taken from he felt sad.
</p><p>“Still, this is much better than being kept in the dirty stable,”
thought the trick pony. “Maybe I’ll see George some day.”
</p><p>Tom, the man who had cleaned and fed Tinkle, came running into the
ponies’ tent.
</p><p>“Come on now!” he cried. “Lively everybody!”
</p><p>All at once some other men began taking down, off pegs in the tent
poles, red blankets, strings of bells, gaily colored plumes and harness.
</p><p>“What is going on?” asked Tinkle.
</p><p>“Oh, they are going to dress us up, and hitch us to a little golden
wagon to go in the parade,” said Prancer.
</p><p>“Do you think I am to go?” asked Tinkle.
</p><p>“I think not this time,” answered Tiny Tim. “You see you don’t know
much about a circus yet, and you might be frightened by the big crowds
and the noise. Then, too, you wouldn’t know how to pull the golden
chariot in which a lady rides, dressed up like a fairy princess.”
</p><p>“Oh, that must be fine!” cried Tinkle.
</p><p>“It is. But you’ll be in it soon, so don’t worry,” put in Prancer.
“We’ll be back by noon.”
</p><p>The men hitched up the ponies and led them out of the tent to where the
golden chariot stood.
</p><p>“This new pony is a very pretty one,” said the man Tom to one of his
helpers. “When he is trained he’ll go in the parade too.”
</p><p>Tinkle felt a little sad when his pony friends left him alone in the
big tent, but still he had plenty to eat and a clean place to stay, and
he knew they would come back soon. Tinkle saw a boy coming toward him
with a pail of water, and, for a moment, the pony thought the boy might
be George. But he was not.
</p><p>“I wonder if I shall ever see George, Mabel and nice Patrick again?”
thought Tinkle. “I would just love to be in my nice home once more,
even though I like the circus.”
</p><p>Suddenly Tinkle heard some one call:
</p><p>“Look out! Here come the elephants!” and the ground seemed to rumble
and shake as it did when there was a heavy thunder storm.
</p><p>“Elephants? Elephants?” said Tinkle to himself. “Where have I heard
that word before?” Then he remembered. “Oh, now I know,” he said.
“Dido, the dancing bear, told me about them.”
</p><p>Tinkle looked from his tent. Near him, just outside, were ten big
elephants with gay silk blankets on their backs. And, as Tinkle looked,
he saw one funny elephant slyly reach out his trunk and pull the tail
of the elephant in front of him. Then the funny elephant looked the
other way and seemed to be hunting on the ground for a peanut.
</p><p>[Illustration: As Tinkle looked he saw one funny elephant slyly reach

</p><p>All at once it flashed into Tinkle’s head.
</p><p>“That must be Tum Tum the jolly elephant Dido was telling me about.
I’ll ask him.” So he called, in animal talk: “How do you do, Tum Tum?”
</p><p>“Ha! What’s that? Some one must know me,” answered Tum Tum, for it was
he. “Oh,” he went on, “it’s a little pony. But, though I know most of
the ponies in this circus, I don’t know you,” and Tum Tum walked a
little closer to Tinkle’s tent.
</p><p>“I heard about you from Dido, the dancing bear,” said Tinkle, as he
told his own name. “I never thought I should meet you in this circus,
though.”
</p><p>“Why, how strange!” cried Tum Tum. “Fancy meeting Dido! You must tell
me all about him. He and I are very good friends. I was sorry when he
went away from the circus. Tell me about him when I come back. I have
to go in the parade now,” and Tum Tum, with a jolly laugh and a wink
of his eye at Tinkle, marched slowly off with a man seated on his big
head.
