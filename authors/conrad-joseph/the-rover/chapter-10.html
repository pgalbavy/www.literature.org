<p>It was only after reaching the level ground in front of the farmhouse
that Peyrol took time to pause and resume his contact with the
exterior world.</p>

<p>While he had been closeted with his prisoner the sky had got
covered with a thin layer of cloud, in one of those swift changes
of weather that are not unusual in the Mediterranean. This grey
vapour, drifting high up, close against the disc of the sun, seemed
to enlarge the space behind its veil, add to the vastness of a
shadowless world no longer hard and brilliant but all softened
in the contours of its masses and in the faint line of the horizon,
as if ready to dissolve in the immensity of the infinite.</p>

<p>Familiar and indifferent to his eyes, material and shadowy, the
extent of the changeable sea had gone pale under the pale sun
in a mysterious and emotional response. Mysterious too was the
great oval patch of dark water to the west; and also a broad blue
lane traced on the dull silver of the waters in a parabolic curve
described magistrally by an invisible finger for a symbol of endless
wandering. The face of the farmhouse might have been the face
of a house from which all the inhabitants had fled suddenly. In
the high part of the building the window of the lieutenant’s room
remained open, both glass and shutter. By the door of the salle
the stable fork leaning against the wall seemed to have been forgotten
by the sans-culotte. This aspect of abandonment struck Peyrol
with more force than usual. He had been thinking so hard of all
these people, that to find no one about seemed unnatural and even
depressing. He had seen many abandoned places in his life, grass
huts, mud forts, kings’ palaces&mdash;temples from which every white-robed
soul had fled. Temples, however, never looked quite empty. The
gods clung to their own. Peyrol’s eyes rested on the bench against
the wall of the salle. In the usual course of things it should
have been occupied by the lieutenant, who had the habit of sitting
there with hardly a movement, for hours, like a spider watching
for the coming of a fly. This paralysing comparison held Peyrol
motionless with a twisted mouth and a frown on his brow, before
the evoked vision, coloured and precise, of the man, more troubling
than the reality had ever been.</p>

<p>He came to himself with a start. What sort of occupation was
this, ‘cré nom de nom, staring at a silly bench with no one on
it. Was he going wrong in his head? Or was it that he was getting
really old? He had noticed old men losing themselves like that.
But he had something to do. First of all he had to go and see
what the English sloop in the Passe was doing.</p>

<p>While he was making his way towards the lookout on the hill where
the inclined pine hung peering over the cliff as if an insatiable
curiosity were holding it in that precarious position, Peyrol
had another view from above of the farmyard and of the buildings
and was again affected by their deserted appearance. Not a soul,
not even an animal seemed to have been left; only on the roofs
the pigeons walked with smart elegance. Peyrol hurried on and
presently saw the English ship well over on the Porquerolles side
with her yards braced up and her head to the southward. There
was a little wind in the Passe, while the dull silver of the open
had a darkling rim of rippled water far away to the east in that
quarter where, far or near, but mostly out of sight, the British
fleet kept its endless watch. Not a shadow of a spar or gleam
of sail on the horizon betrayed its presence; but Peyrol would
not have been surprised to see a crowd of ships surge up, people
the horizon with hostile life, come in running, and dot the sea
with their ordered groups all about Cape Cicié, parading their
damned impudence. Then indeed that corvette, the big factor of
everyday life on that stretch of coast, would become very small
potatoes indeed; and the man in command of her (he had been Peyrol’s
personal adversary in many imaginary encounters fought to a finish
in the room upstairs)&mdash;then indeed that Englishman would have
to mind his steps. He would be ordered to come within hail of
the admiral, be sent here and there, made to run like a little
dog and as likely as not get called on board the flagship and
get a dressing down for something or other.</p>

<p>Peyrol thought for a moment that the impudence of this Englishman
was going to take the form of running along the peninsula and
looking into the very cove; for the corvette’s head was falling
off slowly. A fear for his tartane clutched Peyrol’s heart till
he remembered that the Englishman did not know of her existence.
Of course not. His cudgel had been absolutely effective in stopping
that bit of information. The only Englishman who knew of the existence
of the tartane was that fellow with the broken head. Peyrol actually
laughed at his momentary scare. Moreover, it was evident that
the Englishman did not mean to parade in front of the peninsula.
He did not mean to be impudent. The sloop’s yards were swung right
round and she came again to the wind but now heading to the northward
back from where she came. Peyrol saw at once that the Englishman
meant to pass to windward of Cape Esterel, probably with the intention
of anchoring for the night off the long white beach which in a
regular curve closes the roadstead of Hyères on that side.</p>

<p>Peyrol pictured her to himself, on the clouded night, not so
very dark, since the full moon was but a day old, lying at anchor
within hail of the low shore, with her sails furled and looking
profoundly asleep, but with the watch on deck lying by the guns.
He gnashed his teeth. It had come to this at last, that the captain
of the <em>Amelia</em> could do nothing with his ship without
putting Peyrol into a rage. Oh, for forty Brothers, or sixty,
picked ones, he thought, to teach the fellow what it might cost
him taking liberties along the French coast! Ships had been carried
by surprise before, on nights when there was just light enough
to see the whites of each other’s eyes in a close tussle. And
what would be the crew of that Englishman? Something between ninety
and a hundred altogether, boys and landsmen included.... Peyrol
shook his fist for a good-bye, just when Cape Esterel shut off
the English sloop from his sight. But in his heart of hearts that
seaman of cosmopolitan associations knew very well that no forty
or sixty, not any given hundred Brothers of the Coast would have
been enough to capture that corvette making herself at home within
ten miles of where he had first opened his eyes to the world.</p>

<p>He shook his head dismally at the leaning pine, his only companion.
The disinherited soul of that rover ranging for so many years
a lawless ocean with the coasts of two continents for a raiding
ground, had come back to its crag, circling like a seabird in
the dusk and longing for a great sea victory for its people: that
inland multitude of which Peyrol knew nothing except the few individuals
on that peninsula cut off from the rest of the land by the dead
water of a salt lagoon; and where only a strain of manliness in
a miserable cripple and an unaccountable charm of a half-crazed
woman had found response in his heart.</p>

<p>This scheme of false dispatches was but a detail in a plan for
a great, a destructive victory. Just a detail, but not a trifle
all the same. Nothing connected with the deception of an admiral
could be called trifling. And such an admiral too. It was, Peyrol
felt vaguely, a scheme that only a confounded landsman would invent.
It behoved the sailors, however, to make a workable thing of it.
It would have to be worked through that corvette.</p>

<p>And here Peyrol was brought up by the question that all his life
had not been able to settle for him&mdash;and that was whether the
English were really very stupid or very acute. That difficulty
had presented itself with every fresh case. The old rover had
enough genius in him to have arrived at a general conclusion that
if they were to be deceived at all it could not be done very well
by words but rather by deeds; not by mere wriggling, but by deep
craft concealed under some sort of straightforward action. That
conviction, however, did not take him forward in this case, which
was one in which much thinking would be necessary.</p>

<p>The <em>Amelia</em> had disappeared behind Cape Esterel, and
Peyrol wondered with a certain anxiety whether this meant that
the Englishman had given up his man for good. "If he has," said
Peyrol to himself, "I am bound to see him pass out again from
beyond Cape Esterel before it gets dark." If, however, he did
not see the ship again within the next hour or two, then she would
be anchored off the beach, to wait for the night before making
some attempt to discover what had become of her man. This could
be done only by sending out one or two boats to explore the coast,
and no doubt to enter the cove&mdash;perhaps even to land a small search
party.</p>

<p>After coming to this conclusion Peyrol began deliberately to
charge his pipe. Had he spared a moment for a glance inland, he
might have caught a whisk of a black skirt, the gleam of a white
fichu &mdash;Arlette running down the faint track leading from
Escampobar to the village in the hollow; the same track in fact
up which Citizen Scevola, while indulging in the strange freak
to visit the church, had been chased by the incensed faithful.
But Peyrol, while charging and lighting his pipe, had kept his
eyes fastened on Cape Esterel. Then, throwing his arm affectionately
over the trunk of the pine, he had settled himself to watch. Far
below him the roadstead, with its play of grey and bright gleams,
looked like a plaque of mother-of-pearl in a frame of yellow rocks
and dark green ravines set off inland by the masses of the hills
displaying the tint of the finest purple; while above his head
the sun behind a cloud-veil hung like a silver disc.</p>

<p>That afternoon, after waiting in vain for Lieutenant Réal to
appear outside in the usual way, Arlette, the mistress of Escampobar,
had gone unwillingly into the kitchen where Catherine sat upright
in a heavy capacious wooden arm-chair, the back of which rose
above the top of her white muslin cap. Even in her old age, even
in her hours of ease, Catherine preserved the upright carriage
of the family that had held Escampobar for so many generations.
It would have been easy to believe that like some characters famous
in the world Catherine would have wished to die standing up and
with unbowed shoulders.</p>

<p>With her sense of hearing undecayed she detected the light footsteps
in the salle long before Arlette entered the kitchen. That woman,
who had faced alone and unaided (except for her brother’s comprehending
silence) the anguish of passion in a forbidden love, and of terrors
comparable to those of the Judgment Day, neither turned her face,
quiet without serenity, nor her eyes, fearless but without fire,
in the direction of her niece.</p>

<p>Arlette glanced on all sides, even at the walls, even at the
mound of ashes under the big overmantel, nursing in its heart
a spark of fire, before she sat down and leaned her elbow on the
table.</p>

<p>"You wander about like a soul in pain," said her aunt, sitting
by the hearth like an old queen on her throne.</p>

<p>"And you sit here eating your heart out."</p>

<p>"Formerly," remarked Catherine, "old women like me could always
go over their prayers, but now...."</p>

<p>"I believe you have not been to church for years. I remember
Scevola telling me that a long time ago. Was it because you didn’t
like people’s eyes? I have fancied sometimes that most people
in the world must have been massacred long ago."</p>

<p>Catherine turned her face away. Arlette rested her head on her
half-closed hand, and her eyes, losing their steadiness, began
to tremble amongst cruel visions. She got up suddenly and caressed
the thin, half-averted, withered cheek with the tips of her fingers,
and in a low voice, with that marvellous cadence that plucked
at one’s heart-strings, she said coaxingly:</p>

<p>"Those were dreams, weren’t they?"</p>

<p>In her immobility the old woman called with all the might of
her will for the presence of Peyrol. She had never been able to
shake off a superstitious fear of that niece restored to her from
the terrors of a Judgment Day in which the world had been given
over to the devils. She was always afraid that this girl, wandering
about with restless eyes and a dim smile on her silent lips, would
suddenly say something atrocious, unfit to be heard, calling for
vengeance from heaven, unless Peyrol were by. That stranger come
from "par delà les mers" was out of it altogether, cared probably
for no one in the world but had struck her imagination by his
massive aspect, his deliberation suggesting a mighty force like
the reposeful attitude of a lion. Arlette desisted from caressing
the irresponsive cheek, exclaimed petulantly, "I am awake now!"
and went out of the kitchen without having asked her aunt the
question she had meant to ask, which was whether she knew what
had become of the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Her heart had failed her. She let herself drop on the bench outside
the door of the salle. "What is the matter with them all?" she
thought. "I can’t make them out. What wonder is it that I have
not been able to sleep?" Even Peyrol, so different from all mankind,
who from the first moment when he stood before her had the power
to soothe her aimless unrest, even Peyrol would now sit for hours
with the lieutenant on the bench, gazing into the air and keeping
him in talk about things without sense, as if on purpose to prevent
him from thinking of her. Well, he could not do that. But the
enormous change implied in the fact that every day had a to-morrow
now, and that all the people around her had ceased to be mere
phantoms for her wandering glances to glide over without concern,
made her feel the need of support from somebody, from somewhere.
She could have cried aloud for it.</p>

<p>She sprang up and walked along the whole front of the farm building.
At the end of the wall enclosing the orchard she called out in
a modulated undertone: "Eugène," not because she hoped that the
lieutenant was anywhere within earshot, but for the pleasure of
hearing the sound of the name uttered for once above a whisper.
She turned about and at the end of the wall on the yard side she
repeated her call, drinking in the sound that came from her lips,
"Eugène, Eugène," with a sort of half-exulting despair. It was
in such dizzy moments that she wanted a steadying support. But
all was still. She heard no friendly murmur, not even a sigh.
Above her head under the thin grey sky a big mulberry-tree stirred
no leaf. Step by step, as if unconsciously, she began to move
down the track. At the end of fifty yards she opened the inland
view, the roofs of the village between the green tops of the platanes
overshadowing the fountain, and just beyond the flat blue-grey
level of the salt lagoon, smooth and dull like a slab of lead.
But what drew her on was the church-tower, where, in a round arch,
she could see the black speck of the bell which, escaping the
requisitions of the Republican wars, and dwelling mute above the
locked-up empty church, had only lately recovered its voice. She
ran on, but when she had come near enough to make out the figures
moving about the village fountain, she checked herself, hesitated
a moment and then took the footpath leading to the presbytery.</p>

<p>She pushed open the little gate with the broken latch. The humble
building of rough stones, from between which much mortar had crumbled
out, looked as though it had been sinking slowly into the ground.
The beds of the plot in front were choked with weeds, because
the abbé had no taste for gardening. When the heiress of Escampobar
opened the door, he was walking up and down the largest room which
was his bedroom and sitting-room and where he also took his meals.
He was a gaunt man with a long, as if convulsed, face. In his
young days he had been tutor to the sons of a great noble, but
he did not emigrate with his employer. Neither did he submit to
the Republic. He had lived in his native land like a hunted wild
beast, and there had been many tales of his activities, warlike
and others. When the hierarchy was re-established he found no
favour in the eyes of his superiors. He had remained too much
of a royalist. He had accepted, without a word, the charge of
this miserable parish, where he had acquired influence quickly
enough. His sacerdotalism lay in him like a cold passion. Though
accessible enough, he never walked abroad without his breviary,
acknowledging the solemnly bared heads by a curt nod. He was not
exactly feared, but some of the oldest inhabitants who remembered
the previous incumbent, an old man who died in the garden after
having been dragged out of bed by some patriots anxious to take
him to prison in Hyères, jerked their heads sideways in a knowing
manner when their curé was mentioned.</p>

<p>On seeing this apparition in an Arlesian cap and silk skirt,
a white fichu, and otherwise as completely different as any princess
could be from the rustics with whom he was in daily contact, his
face expressed the blankest astonishment. Then&mdash;for he knew enough
of the gossip of his community&mdash;his straight, thick eyebrows came
together inimically. This was no doubt the woman of whom he had
heard his parishioners talk with bated breath as having given
herself and her property up to a Jacobin, a Toulon sans-culotte
who had either delivered her parents to execution or had murdered
them himself during the first three days of massacres. No one
was very sure which it was, but the rest was current knowledge.
The abbé, though persuaded that any amount of moral turpitude
was possible in a godless country, had not accepted all that tale
literally. No doubt those people were Republican and impious,
and the state of affairs up there was scandalous and horrible.
He struggled with his feelings of repulsion and managed to smooth
his brow and waited. He could not imagine what that woman with
mature form and a youthful face could want at the presbytery.
Suddenly it occurred to him that perhaps she wanted to thank him&mdash;it
was a very old occurrence&mdash;for interposing between the fury of
the villagers and that man. He couldn’t call him, even in his
thoughts, her husband, for apart from all other circumstances,
that connection could not imply any kind of marriage to a priest,
had even there been a legal form observed. His visitor was apparently
disconcerted by the expression of his face, the austere aloofness
of his attitude, and only a low murmur escaped her lips. He bent
his head and was not very certain what he had heard.</p>

<p>"You come to seek my aid?" he asked in a doubting tone.</p>

<p>She nodded slightly, and the abbé went to the door she had left
half open and looked out. There was not a soul in sight between
the presbytery and the village, or between the presbytery and
the church. He went back to face her, saying:</p>

<p>"We are as alone as we can well be. The old woman in the kitchen
is as deaf as a post."</p>

<p>Now that he had been looking at Arlette closer the abbé felt
a sort of dread. The carmine of those lips, the pellucid, unstained,
unfathomable blackness of those eyes, the pallor of her cheeks,
suggested to him something provokingly pagan, something distastefully
different from the common sinners of this earth. And now she was
ready to speak. He arrested her with a raised hand.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said. "I have never seen you before. I don’t even
know properly who you are. None of you belong to my flock&mdash;for
you are from Escampobar, are you not?" Sombre under their bony
arches, his eyes fastened on her face, noticed the delicacy of
features, the naïve pertinacity of her stare. She said:</p>

<p>"I am the daughter."</p>

<p>"The daughter!... Oh! I see.... Much evil is spoken of you."</p>

<p>She said a little impatiently: "By that rabble?" and the priest
remained mute for a moment. "What do they say? In my father’s
time they wouldn’t have dared to say anything. The only thing
I saw of them for years and years was when they were yelping like
curs on the heels of Scevola."</p>

<p>The absence of scorn in her tone was perfectly annihilating.
Gentle sounds flowed from her lips and a disturbing charm from
her strange equanimity. The abbé frowned heavily at these fascinations,
which seemed to have in them something diabolic.</p>

<p>"They are simple souls, neglected, fallen back into darkness.
It isn’t their fault. But they have natural feelings of humanity
which were outraged. I saved him from their indignation. There
are things that must be left to divine justice."</p>

<p>He was exasperated by the unconsciousness of that fair face.</p>

<p>"That man whose name you have just pronounced and which I have
heard coupled with the epithet of blood-drinker is regarded as
the master of Escampobar Farm. He has been living there for years.
How is that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a long time ago since he brought me back to the house.
Years ago. Catherine let him stay."</p>

<p>"Who is Catherine?" the abbé asked harshly.</p>

<p>"She is my father’s sister who was left at home to wait. She
had given up all hope of seeing any of us again, when one morning
Scevola came with me to the door. Then she let him stay. He is
a poor creature. What else could Catherine have done? And what
is it to us up there how the people in the village regard him?"
She dropped her eyes and seemed to fall into deep thought, then
added, "It was only later that I discovered that he was a poor
creature, even quite lately. They call him blood-drinker, do they?
What of that? All the time he was afraid of his own shadow."</p>

<p>She ceased but did not raise her eyes.</p>

<p>"You are no longer a child," began the abbé in a severe voice,
frowning at her downcast eyes, and he heard a murmur: "Not very
long." He disregarded it and continued: "I ask you, is this all
that you have to tell me about that man? I hope that at least
you are no hypocrite."</p>

<p>"Monsieur l’Abbé," she said, raising her eyes fearlessly, "what
more am I to tell you about him? I can tell you things that will
make your hair stand on end, but it wouldn’t be about him."</p>

<p>For all answer the abbé made a weary gesture and turned away
to walk up and down the room. His face expressed neither curiosity
nor pity, but a sort of repugnance which he made an effort to
overcome. He dropped into a deep and shabby old arm-chair, the
only object of luxury in the room, and pointed to a wooden straight-backed
stool. Arlette sat down on it and began to speak. The abbé listened,
but looking far away; his big bony hands rested on the arms of
the chair. After the first words he interrupted her: "This is
your own story you are telling me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Arlette.</p>

<p>"Is it necessary that I should know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur l’Abbé."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>He bent his head a little, without, however, ceasing to look
far away. Her voice now was very low. Suddenly the abbé threw
himself back.</p>

<p>"You want to tell me your story because you have fallen in love
with a man?"</p>

<p>"No, because that has brought me back to myself. Nothing else
could have done it."</p>

<p>He turned his head to look at her grimly, but he said nothing
and looked away again. He listened. At the beginning he muttered
once or twice, "Yes, I have heard that," and then kept silent,
not looking at her at all. Once he interrupted her by a question:
"You were confirmed before the convent was forcibly entered and
the nuns dispersed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "a year before that or more."</p>

<p>"And then two of those ladies took you with them towards Toulon."</p>

<p>"Yes, the other girls had their relations near by. They took
me with them thinking to communicate with my parents, but it was
difficult. Then the English came and my parents sailed over to
try and get some news of me. It was safe for my father to be in
Toulon then. Perhaps you think that he was a traitor to his country?"
she asked, and waited with parted lips. With an impassible face
the abbé murmured: "He was a good royalist," in a tone of bitter
fatalism, which seemed to absolve that man and all the other men
of whose actions and errors he had ever heard.</p>

<p>For a long time, Arlette continued, her father could not discover
the house where the nuns had taken refuge. He only obtained some
information on the very day before the English evacuated Toulon.
Late in the day he appeared before her and took her away. The
town was full of retreating foreign troops. Her father left her
with her mother and went out again to make preparations for sailing
home that very night; but the tartane was no longer in the place
where he had left her lying. The two Madrague men that he had
for a crew had disappeared also. Thus the family was trapped in
that town full of tumult and confusion. Ships and houses were
bursting into flames. Appalling explosions of gunpowder shook
the earth. She spent that night on her knees with her face hidden
in her mother’s lap, while her father kept watch by the barricaded
door with a pistol in each hand.</p>

<p>In the morning the house was filled with savage yells. People
were heard rushing up the stairs, and the door was burst in. She
jumped up at the crash and flung herself down on her knees in
a corner with her face to the wall. There was a murderous uproar,
she heard two shots fired, then somebody seized her by the arm
and pulled her up to her feet. It was Scevola. He dragged her
to the door. The bodies of her father and mother were lying across
the doorway. The room was full of gunpowder smoke. She wanted
to fling herself on the bodies and cling to them, but Scevola
took her under the arms and lifted her over them. He seized her
hand and made her run with him, or rather dragged her downstairs.
Outside on the pavement some dreadful men and many fierce women
with knives joined them. They ran along the streets brandishing
pikes and sabres, pursuing other groups of unarmed people, who
fled round corners with loud shrieks.</p>

<p>"I ran in the midst of them, Monsieur l’Abbé," Arlette went on
in a breathless murmur. "Whenever I saw any water I wanted to
throw myself into it, but I was surrounded on all sides, I was
jostled and pushed and most of the time Scevola held my hand very
tight. When they stopped at a wine shop they would offer me some
wine. My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth and I drank. The
wine, the pavements, the arms and faces, everything was red. I
had red splashes all over me. I had to run with them all day,
and all the time I felt as if I were falling down, and down, and
down. The houses were nodding at me. The sun would go out at times.
And suddenly I heard myself yelling exactly like the others. Do
you understand, Monsieur l’Abbé? The very same words!"</p>

<p>The eyes of the priest in their deep orbits glided towards her
and then resumed their far-away fixity. Between his fatalism and
his faith he was not very far from the belief of Satan taking
possession of rebellious mankind, exposing the nakedness of hearts
like flint and of the homicidal souls of the Revolution.</p>

<p>"I have heard something of that," he whispered stealthily.</p>

<p>She affirmed with quiet earnestness: "Yet at that time I resisted
with all my might."</p>

<p>That night Scevola put her under the care of a woman called Perose.
She was young and pretty, and was a native of Arles, her mother’s
country. She kept an inn. That woman locked her up in her own
room, which was next to the room where the patriots kept on shouting,
singing and making speeches far into the night. Several times
the woman would look in for a moment, make a hopeless gesture
at her with both arms, and vanish again. Later, on many other
nights, when all the band lay asleep on benches and on the floor,
Perose would steal into the room, fall on her knees by the bed
on which Arlette sat upright, open-eyed and raving silently to
herself, embrace her feet and cry herself to sleep. But in the
morning she would jump up briskly and say: "Come. The great affair
is to keep our life in our bodies. Come along to help in the work
of justice"; and they would join the band that was making ready
for another day of traitor-hunting. But after a time the victims,
of which the streets were full at first, had to be sought for
in back yards, ferreted out of their hiding-places, dragged up
out of the cellars or down from the garrets of the houses, which
would be entered by the band with howls of death and vengeance.</p>

<p>"Then, Monsieur l’Abbé," said Arlette, "I let myself go at last.
I could resist no longer. I said to myself: ‘If it is so then
it must be right.’ But most of the time I was like a person half
asleep and dreaming things that it is impossible to believe. About
that time, I don’t know why, the woman Perose hinted to me that
Scevola was a poor creature. Next night, while all the band lay
fast asleep in the big room, Perose and Scevola helped me out
of the window into the street and led me to the quay behind the
arsenal. Scevola had found our tartane lying at the pontoon and
one of the Madrague men with her. The other had disappeared. Perose
fell on my neck and cried a little. She gave me a kiss and said:
‘My time will come soon. You, Scevola, don’t you show yourself
in Toulon, because nobody believes in you any more. Adieu, Arlette.
Vive la Nation!’ and she vanished in the night. I waited on the
pontoon shivering in my torn clothes, listening to Scevola and
the man throwing dead bodies overboard out of the tartane. Splash,
splash, splash. And suddenly I felt I must run away, but they
were after me in a moment, dragged me back and threw me down into
that cabin which smelt of blood. But when I got back to the farm
all feeling had left me. I did not feel myself exist. I saw things
round me here and there, but I couldn’t look at anything for long.
Something was gone out of me. I know now that it was not my heart,
but then I didn’t mind what it was. I felt light and empty, and
a little cold all the time, but I could smile at people. Nothing
could matter. Nothing could mean anything. I cared for no one.
I wanted nothing. I wasn’t alive at all, Monsieur l’Abbé. People
seemed to see me and would talk to me, and it seemed funny&mdash;till
one day I felt my heart beat."</p>

<p>"Why precisely did you come to me with this tale?" asked the
abbé in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Because you are a priest. Have you forgotten that I have been
brought up in a convent? I have not forgotten how to pray. But
I am afraid of the world now. What must I do?"</p>

<p>"Repent!" thundered the abbé, getting up. He saw her candid gaze
uplifted, and lowered his voice forcibly. "You must look with
fearless sincerity into the darkness of your soul. Remember whence
the only true help can come. Those whom God has visited by a trial
such as yours cannot be held guiltless of their enormities. Withdraw
from the world. Descend within yourself and abandon the vain thoughts
of what people call happiness. Be an example to yourself of the
sinfulness of our nature and of the weakness of our humanity.
You may have been possessed. What do I know? Perhaps it was permitted
in order to lead your soul to saintliness through a life of seclusion
and prayer. To that it would be my duty to help you. Meantime
you must pray to be given strength for a complete renunciation."</p>

<p>Arlette, lowering her eyes slowly, appealed to the abbé as a
symbolic figure of spiritual mystery. "What can be God’s designs
on this creature?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Curé," she said quietly, "I felt the need to pray
to-day for the first time in many years. When I left home it was
only to go to your church."</p>

<p>"The church stands open to the worst of sinners," said the abbé.</p>

<p>"I know. But I would have had to pass before all those villagers:
and you, Abbé, know well what they are capable of."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," murmured the abbé, "it would be better not to put
their charity to the test."</p>

<p>"I must pray before I go back again. I thought you would let
me come in through the sacristy."</p>

<p>"It would be inhuman to refuse your request," he said, rousing
himself and taking down a key that hung on the wall. He put on
his broad-brimmed hat and without a word led the way through the
wicket-gate and along the path which he always used himself and
which was out of sight of the village fountain. After they had
entered the damp and dilapidated sacristy he locked the door behind
them and only then opened another, a smaller one, leading into
the church. When he stood aside, Arlette became aware of the chilly
odour as of freshly turned-up earth mingled with a faint scent
of incense. In the deep dusk of the nave a single little flame
glimmered before an image of the Virgin. The abbé whispered as
she passed on:</p>

<p>"There before the great altar abase yourself and pray for grace
and strength and mercy in this world full of crimes against God
and men."</p>

<p>She did not look at him. Through the thin soles of her shoes
she could feel the chill of the flagstones. The abbé left the
door ajar, sat down on a rush-bottomed chair, the only one in
the sacristy, folded his arms and let his chin fall on his breast.
He seemed to be sleeping profoundly, but at the end of half an
hour he got up and, going to the doorway, stood looking at the
kneeling figure sunk low on the altar steps. Arlette’s face was
buried in her hands in a passion of piety and prayer. The abbé
waited patiently for a good many minutes more, before he raised
his voice in a grave murmur which filled the whole dark place.</p>

<p>"It is time for you to leave. I am going to ring for vespers."</p>

<p>The view of her complete absorption before the Most High had
touched him. He stepped back into the sacristy and after a time
heard the faintest possible swish of the black silk skirt of the
Escampobar daughter in her Arlesian costume. She entered the sacristy
lightly with shining eyes, and the abbé looked at her with some
emotion.</p>

<p>"You have prayed well, my daughter," he said. "No forgiveness
will be refused to you, for you have suffered much. Put your trust
in the grace of God."</p>

<p>She raised her head and stayed her footsteps for a moment. In
the dark little place he could see the gleam of her eyes swimming
in tears.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur l’Abbé," she said in her clear seductive voice.
"I have prayed and I feel answered. I entreated the merciful God
to keep the heart of the man I love always true to me or else
to let me die before I set my eyes on him again."</p>

<p>The abbé paled under his tan of a village priest and leaned his
shoulders against the wall without a word.</p>
