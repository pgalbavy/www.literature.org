<p>The sentinel on his rounds, the watchman upon his beat, or the
sailor pacing the deck of his vessel in mid-ocean, keeps his senses
awake by the constant motion of his body. To sit down to rest
for a few minutes only is fatal. Sleep has the power of stealing
over the faculties, and wrapping them up in its embrace so insidiously,
that no watchfulness can guard against it unless artificial means,
such as walking, are resorted to. When Ned Chadmund resumed an
easy position in front of his own camp fire, the inevitable result
followed. He resolved to keep his ears and eyes open, and almost
immediately closed them. A few minutes passed and then his head
began to nod. Several times he narrowly escaped tumbling over,
and, finally rousing, he vigorously rubbed his eyes, yawned, and
arose to his feet.</p>

<p>"My gracious! this won't do," he exclaimed, with a shuddering
sense of the danger he was running. "A bear might steal right
up to me and eat me up before I could help myself. If I'm going
to play sentinel, I must do it like a man."</p>

<p>Straightway he began pacing back and forth in front of the blaze,
his beat extending some twenty feet back and forth. He carried
his rifle on his shoulder and proved the thoroughness of his vigilance
by an occasional glance at the top of the rock, from which the
mountain wolf had made its death leap. The coast remained clear.
The far-off sounds which had attracted his attention a short time
before were not repeated, and, as the labor of walking back and
forth grew a little wearisome, he began to argue the question
with himself.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether there isn't some way of resting without working?
If I've got to walk all night, what shall I be good for to-morrow?
I don't see any fun in this sort of business. Ah, I know how I'll
fix it; I'll kindle two fires."</p>

<p>He acted upon the idea at once. He had gathered such an abundance
of fuel that he had no fear of the supply running out. In a few
minutes he had a second fire started, about a dozen feet from
the other, while he stowed himself away directly between them.
His position, he soon discovered, was rather warmer than he anticipated,
but he speedily remedied this by permitting each fire to subside
in a slight degree.</p>

<p>"This is nice," he muttered, shrinking up against the rock. "I
don't think any wild creature would harm me unless he tumbled
over the top of the rock there and dropped on my head. Even then
I think I should wake up soon enough to use my gun on him. But
then, I guess I won't go to sleep."</p>

<p>Five minutes later his head was nodding again, and utter unconsciousness
speedily followed. But one of the brands in the fire on his right
fell, and there was a slight crackling explosion of the embers&mdash;as
is often the case. A glowing spark flew outward and dropped upon
the limp hand of the sleeping youngster.</p>

<p>Simultaneously there was a yell, and the lad leaped several feet
from the ground, dancing about like a rejoicing warrior and flinging
his hand as if he were trying to shake off some clinging reptile.</p>

<p>"I should like to know who did that?" he exclaimed, a little
confused by the startling manner in which he had been aroused.
"I guess I understand how it all came about, though," he added,
as he examined the stinging blister upon the back of his hand.</p>

<p>The pain from this little wound effectually banished all sleep
for the time. Ned busied himself in replenishing the fire, and
then walked out in the gloom and looked about. Everything was
the same. The night was dark,&mdash;no moon being visible,&mdash;and an
oppressive sultriness was in the atmosphere. It seemed as if some
elemental disturbance were close at hand, but in looking to the
sky no presage of it could be discovered.</p>

<p>After wandering about for some time, the lad spat upon some earth,
and, plastering it over the smarting blister, succeeded in shutting
out the air from it and secured considerable relief.</p>

<p>"It must be that I am all alone," he added, standing still and
listening. "No one is near and no one sees me but God. He has
taken care of me in the past, and He will not forsake me in future,"
he added, looking reverently upward.</p>

<p>The old feeling of drowsiness again stole over him and he determined
to secure a night's rest&mdash;that is, during the portion of the night
that remained. Still the fact that the fires had run down somewhat
raised the inquiry in his mind as to what was likely to happen
in case they went out altogether. If any more grizzly bears should
put in an appearance, his situation would not be of the most inviting
nature, but he had argued himself into the belief that no further
peril of this character threatened. By placing a goodly amount
of fuel upon the fires he hoped to keep them going until daylight,
or until his slumber was over. Had he been able to find a suitable
tree, he would have made his bed in that, even at the risk of
another disagreeable fall, but nothing of the kind could be seen,
and he had already grown weary of hunting for some hiding place
among the rocks. Accordingly, the camp fires were replenished
and he resumed his former position between them, covering his
hands very carefully, lest another spark should drop in the same
place.</p>

<p>"I wish it was colder!" he exclaimed, when he found the place
growing uncomfortably warm. "If it was winter now, I shouldn't
want anything nicer."</p>

<p>He stood it like a hero, however, and by and by his place became
more pleasant, for the reason that the fuel was rapidly burning
down. About this time sleep regained possession of his senses,
and, cramped up though he was, with his back against the rock,
his slumber was scarcely less sound than if he were stretched
out upon his blanket beneath a tree in the forest.</p>

<p>At the time young Chadmund relapsed into unconsciousness it was
nearly midnight, and for nearly two hours following there was
scarcely the slightest change in the surroundings. The fires burned
low, until the figure of the lad braced up against the rock grew
dim and shadowy in the deepening gloom. Scarcely a breath of air
stirred the vegetation about him, and everything seemed to be
calculated to lull one into a deep, soothing, dreamless sleep.
But at the end of the time mentioned, something came out of the
undergrowth and advanced stealthily toward him. It was vague,
shadowy, and so dimly outlined that at first its form could not
be recognized; but as it glided closer to the fire, there was
enough light remaining to disclose the figure of another wolf.</p>

<p>Like a phantom born of the gloom itself, it moved toward the
unconscious lad, until scarcely a dozen feet intervened. Then,
as if directed by Providence, one of the embers snapped apart,
throwing out a sudden flame, which momentarily lit up the surrounding
darkness. Like a flash the wolf slunk back, and then, pausing,
stood and stared at the lad, licking his jaws as if in anticipation
of the feast he expected to enjoy upon him.</p>

<p>As the flames subsided again, and the same gloom crept over the
scene, the hideous creature stole up again, resolved to have the
meal displayed so temptingly before him. Once more he was within
reach, still advancing with jaws distended&mdash;ready to leap upon
him. The boy slumbered dreamlessly on. Still nearer crept the
wolf until Ned was at his mercy.</p>

<p>At this critical juncture, something whizzed from the upper surface
of the rock, with the velocity almost of a bullet. It was a tomahawk,
which, speeding true to its aim, struck the unsuspicious wolf
fairly and with such terrific force that his skull was cloven
in twain as completely as if smitten by the headsman's ax. There
was scarcely time for the wild yelp as he tumbled over backward.
But, such as it was, it aroused Ned, who sprang to his feet and
gazed about him with an alarmed and bewildered air. Before he
could fairly comprehend what had taken place he saw figures descending
and approaching. It was too late to retreat. He was surrounded.</p>

<p>"I'm a goner now!" he muttered.</p>

<p>But as the firelight brightened, he saw the kindly faces of Tom
Hardynge and Dick Morris.</p>
