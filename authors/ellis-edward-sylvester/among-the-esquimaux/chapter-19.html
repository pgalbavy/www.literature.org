<p>Unto no one, excepting him who journeys far into the Northland,
is given it to view such an amazing picture as was now spread
out before the enraptured gaze of Rob Carrol and Fred Warburton.
In Northern Siberia, the Scandinavian Peninsula, the upper portion
of the American Continent, and the Arctic Sea, the traveler learns
in all its wonderful fullness of glory the meaning of the Aurora
Borealis or Northern Lights.</p>

<p>The boys had had partial glimpses of the scene on their voyage
through the Greenland Sea, and there were flickerings of light
which caught their eye on the trip from the iceberg to the mainland,
and the short walk to Docak's hut, but it was during their short
stay in the rude dwelling that the mysterious scene-shifters of
the skies unfolded their magnificent panorama in all its overwhelming
grandeur.</p>

<p>Radiating from a huge nucleus, which seemed to be the North Pole
itself, shot the streamers of light, so vast in extent that their
extremities struck the zenith, withdrawing with lightning-like
quickness, and succeeded by others with the same celerity and
displaying all the vivid hues of the rainbow.</p>

<p>At times these dartings resembled immense spears, and then they
changed to bands of light, turning again into ribbons which shivered
and hovered in the sky, with bewildering variation, turning and
doubling upon themselves, spreading apart like an immense fan,
and then trembling on the very verge of the horizon, as if about
to vanish in the darkness of night.</p>

<p>At the moment the spectators held their breath, fearing that
the celestial display was ended; the streamers, spears, bands
of violet, indigo, blue, orange, red, green, and yellow, with
the innumerable shades, combinations, and mingling of colors,
shot out and spread over the sky like the myriad rays of the setting
sun.</p>

<p>This continued for several minutes, marked by irregular degrees
of intensity, so impressive in its splendor that neither lad spoke,
for he could make no comment upon the exhibition, the like of
which is seen nowhere else in nature.</p>

<p>But once both gave a sigh of amazed delight when a ribbon, combining
several vivid colors, quivered, danced, and streamed far beyond
the zenith, with a wary appearance that suggested that some giant,
standing upon the extreme northern point of the earth, had suddenly
unrolled this marvelous ribbon and was waving it in the eyes of
an awestruck world.</p>

<p>One of the most striking features of those mysterious electrical
phenomena known as the Northern Lights is the absolute silence
which accompanies them. The genius of man can never approach in
the smallest degree the beauties of the picture without some noise,
but here nature performs her most wonderful feat in utter stillness.
The panorama may unfold, roll together, spread apart again with
dazzling brilliancy and suddenness, but the strained ear catches
no sound, unless dissociated altogether from the phenomenon itself,
such as the soft sighing of the Arctic wind over the wastes of
snow, or through the grove of solemn pines.</p>

<p>There were moments when the effulgence spread over the earth,
like the rays of the midnight sun, and the lads, standing in front
of the primitive dwelling of the Esquimau, resembled a couple
of figures stamped in ink in the radiant field.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour the rapt spectators stood near the entrance
to the native dwelling, insensible to the extreme cold, and too
profoundly impressed to speak or stir; but the heavens had given
too great a wealth of splendor, brilliancy, color, and celestial
scene-shifting to continue it long. The subtle exchange of electrical
conditions must have reached something like an equipoise, and
the overwhelming beauty and grandeur exhausted itself.</p>

<p>The ribbons and streamers that had been darting to and beyond
the zenith, shortened their lightning excursions into space, leaping
forth at longer intervals and to a decreasing distance, until
they ceased altogether, displaying a few flickerings in the horizon,
as though eager to bound forth again, but restrained by a superior
hand with the command, "Enough for this time."</p>

<p>Fred drew a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"I never dreamed that anywhere in the world one could see such
a sight as that."</p>

<p>"It is worth a voyage from home a hundred times over, and I don't
regret our stay on the iceberg, for we would have been denied
it otherwise."</p>

<p>"If there are any people living near the North Pole, it must
be like dwelling in another world. I don't see how they stand
it."</p>

<p>"I believe that the Northern Lights have their origin between
here and the Pole," said Fred; "though I am not sure of that."</p>

<p>"The magnetic pole, which must be the source of the display,
is south of the earth's pole, and I suppose that's the reason
for the belief you mention. But it is enough to fill one with
awe, when he gazes on the scene and reflects that the world is
one great reservoir of electricity, which, if left free for a
moment by its Author, would shiver the globe into nothingness,
and leave only an empty void where the earth swung before."</p>

<p>"I pity the man who says, 'There is no God,' or who can look
unmoved to the very depths of his soul by such displays of infinite
power."</p>

<p>"There are no such persons," exclaimed Rob, impatiently; "they
may repeat the words, because they think it brave and smart before
their companions, but they don't believe themselves. It is impossible."</p>

<p>"Why didn't we think to tell Jack and Docak, that they might
have enjoyed the scene with us?"</p>

<p>"The native Esquimaux see it too often to care about it. It is
hard to understand how any one can become accustomed to it, but
we know it is so. As for Jack, he must have looked upon it many
times before, when he was in this latitude. Gracious! but it has
become cold," added Rob, with a shiver.</p>

<p>"It isn't any colder than it has been all the evening, but we
forgot about it while the exhibition was going on."</p>

<p>The boys turned about, and, ducking their heads, made their way
along the long entry, quickly debouching into the warmth and glow
of the living room, where Docak and the sailor, having laid away
their pipes, were talking like a couple of old friends who had
not seen each other for years and were exchanging experiences.
Crestana had finished her work in the kitchen and joined them.
She was sitting on the shorter bench, and, like a thrifty housewife,
was engaged in repairing some of her husband's bulky garments,
with big needles and coarse thread.</p>

<p>She looked up with her pleasant smile, as the boys entered, their
bodies shivering and their teeth chattering from the extreme cold.</p>

<p>"You chaps must have found it mighty pleasant out-doors," remarked
the sailor.</p>

<p>"Ah! Jack, if you had been with us, you would have seen a sight
worth a journey around the world."</p>

<p>"What was it? Another polar bear, or two of them?"</p>

<p>"The Northern Lights, and O&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Northern Lights," interrupted their friend, with a sniff
of disgust; "is that all?"</p>

<p>The boys looked at him, too horrified to speak.</p>

<p>"I'll own that they are rather purty, and the first two or three
times a chap looks onto 'em he is apt to hold his breath, and
rub his eyes, but, when you've seed 'em as often as me, it'll
get to be an old story. Besides Docak and me had more important
bus'ness to talk about."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"This hunting trip; it's all fixed."</p>

<p>"When do we start?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning. There's no saying how long we'll be gone,
and I've told him that it doesn't make any difference to us, so
we get back some time this year."</p>

<p>"Can we travel without snow-shoes?"</p>

<p>"Luckily we can, for Docak has only two pair. This fog and a
little rain we've had have formed a crust on the snow hard enough
to bear a reindeer, so that we can travel over it as easy as if
it were solid ice. The only thing to be feared is another deep
fall of snow afore we can get back. That would make hard traveling,
but then a hunter must take some risk and who cares? We may see
sights and meet fun that will last us a lifetime."</p>
