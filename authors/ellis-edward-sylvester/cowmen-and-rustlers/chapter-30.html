<p>Monteith Sterry was astounded by the declaration of Dick Hawkridge
that some one had passed through the rear door while he was talking
with Capt. Asbury.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" demanded he.</p>

<p>"I told you we thought it was you," replied his friend.</p>

<p>"But you know it wasn't," he replied, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Then I have no idea who it was."</p>

<p>"Some one has taken advantage of the moment I spent with the
captain &mdash;I wonder if he had anything to do with it," he
added, growing unjustly suspicious in his resentment.</p>

<p>He strode across the room; and, knowing where the leader was,
demanded:</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this, Capt. Asbury?"</p>

<p>"The meaning of what?"</p>

<p>"While I was talking a few seconds with you some person slipped
out of the back door; do you know anything of it?"</p>

<p>"It is beyond my comprehension," replied the leader in a voice
which removed all distrust of him.</p>

<p>And forgetful, in his excitement, of his duty at the front, he
stepped hastily to the rear, where most of the men had crowded,
despite the orders for them to maintain a strict watch.</p>

<p>"I heard you and the captain speaking," said Hawkridge, in explanation,
"but your voices were so low that I would not have identified
them anywhere. Supposing you to be where you really were, I stepped
to the rear window here and peered out in the gloom where I knew
the stable to be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you see anything?" interrupted Sterry.</p>

<p>"Not a sign of the signal. While I was straining my eyes to pierce
the darkness the door was drawn inward slightly, and a figure
moved quickly across the space toward the stables."</p>

<p>"You could not identify it?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, for you see how dark it is, and there was no
light; in fact, I hardly saw it before it vanished."</p>

<p>"It is as I supposed," added Sterry, angrily. "Some one fancied
he had a better chance by slipping off than in remaining here,
and has looked after his own safety. I wish I knew who it was."</p>

<p>"We can soon find out," remarked Capt. Asbury; "our men are not
too numerous for me to forget their names and voices."</p>

<p>He raised his tones and summoned them.</p>

<p>"I don't believe they will attempt to fire the house as long
as the ladies are with us," he exclaimed; "some one of our party
has been cowardly enough to sneak off. As I call your names, answer."</p>

<p>He proved the truth of what he said. He had eight companions,
not counting Hawkridge and Sterry. With little hesitation, for
his memory was instantly prompted by others, he pronounced each
name, and to every one came the prompt, unmistakable response
of the owner.</p>

<p>"One of those rustlers has managed to get in here undiscovered,"
was the next theory of Sterry, whose temper did not improve at
the unaccountable turn of affairs. "I don't see why Inman and
the rest delay their attack, when we are only children in their
hands; they can do with us as they please&mdash;"</p>

<p>All started, for at that moment a sharp rap sounded on the door.
Before opening it, Capt. Asbury called out:</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"It is I &mdash;Fred Whitney&mdash;let me in, quick!"</p>

<p>He was admitted without an instant's delay, while all crowded
around in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Well, you can imagine what I have come for. I made known the
request of mother and Jennie, but Inman and Cadmus would not think
of granting it at first. I told Cadmus that it was your special
request, Jennie, adding a little ornamentation of my own, such
as that you knew that when he learned how much it could please
you, he could not refuse. I hope I did right, did I not, sister?"</p>

<p>In the slight laugh which followed this question, the reply of
the young lady was not heard, and her brother continued:</p>

<p>"Well, I put it so strong that Cadmus fell in with me and persuaded
Inman to do the same. They agreed to wait until 10 o'clock, but
no longer; so you see I did not accomplish all that I hoped, but
it was better than nothing. If I am not mistaken it is past 10
now."</p>

<p>"Not more than a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, the time is up, and they have sent me to
notify you that they will wait no longer. I suppose that you,
mother and Jennie, have got together all that you can take away.
As I have to escort you back, I will carry the things, unless
you smuggle in some of the bedsteads."</p>

<p>"Then it is the intention to attack as soon as the ladies are
fairly out of the way?" was the inquiring remark of Capt. Asbury.</p>

<p>"You may depend that it won't be delayed ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Do you know whether they will begin by shooting or trying to
set fire to the building?"</p>

<p>"They haven't given me their confidence, but I don't see why
they should expect to accomplish as much with their guns as they
could have done during the day time. They will set fire to the
place, no doubt."</p>

<p>"It may be well to impress upon those people that we are guarding
every side, and the first rustler of whom we catch a glimpse will
be riddled."</p>

<p>"They are prepared for that, of course; be careful, friends,
and don't expose yourselves more than you are obliged to, for
there will be no let-up after the ball opens. I wish I could stay
with you and help you out. I have been on the watch, ever since
it grew dark, to steal off and make a run to the stockmen's camp,
but I couldn't gain the first chance."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it is too late, anyway," said the captain, "for
they are so far away that it will be over before they could arrive."</p>

<p>"Well, mother," said Fred, fearing that he was staying too long,
"you and Jennie are ready, so let's go. Confound it! we must have
a light for a few minutes; I know where there's a candle."</p>

<p>He ignited a match and quickly found a candle. This was lit and
held above his head, so that he could look into the faces around
him.</p>

<p>"There is no danger of their taking advantage of this until I
leave," he explained, "and you can blow it out before that. I
see you are there, mother; call Jennie down and let her join us."</p>

<p>"Jennie is not in the house!" was the reply, which fairly took
away the breath of all.</p>
