<p>Now since the reader knows how it happened that Archie Jackson
and he who had masqueraded under the name of Cyrus Sutton chanced
to be at this particular spot in the woods when the thieves would
have removed their booty, and also why the silver could not be
found by these worthies, it is necessary to return to the place
where the arrest was made.</p>

<p>Bud Heyland did not take kindly to the idea of being a prisoner.
None knew better than himself the proofs which could be brought
against him, and, after the first surprise passed away, his only
thought was of how he might escape.</p>

<p>While the valiant Archie stood over him in an attitude of triumph,
the detective was holding a short but very concise conversation
with the second captive.</p>

<p>"I'll make you smart for this," Bud heard Kincade say. "Things
have come to a pretty pass when a man who is invited by a friend
to stop on the road a minute in order to look for a whip that
was lost while we were hunting for the lion, gets treated in this
manner by a couple of drunken fools."</p>

<p>Taking his cue from the speech, Bud added in an injured tone:</p>

<p>"That's a fact. I was on my way to join the show; but thought
it might be possible to find the whip, for it belongs to Colonel
Bandman, an' he kicked because I left it."</p>

<p>"After the plans we have laid, Heyland, do you think it is well
to try such a story on me," Carter asked sternly.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talkin' about. Jake has told how we
happened to come here."</p>

<p>"He didn't explain why you wanted Fred Sheldon to change a twenty-dollar
bill for you, nor how it happened that you had an hundred dollars
to pay for the wagon which was smashed."</p>

<p>"I've got nothing to do with any counterfeit money that has been
passed, and I defy you to prove it," Kincade cried, energetically.</p>

<p>"Who said anything about counterfeits?" the detective asked,
sternly. "It will be well for you to keep your mouth shut, unless
you want to get deeper in the mire than you are already. It so
chances, however, that I have ample proof of your connection with
the robbery, aside from what Bud may have let drop, and, in addition,
will show how long you have been engaged in the business of passing
worthless money, so there is no need of any further talk. Will
you walk to the road, or shall we be forced to carry you?"</p>

<p>This question was asked because Bud had seated himself as if
intending to remain for some time; but he sprung to his feet immediately,
so thoroughly cowed, that he would have attempted to obey any
command, however unreasonable, in the hope of finding favor in
the sight of his captors.</p>

<p>"We've got to do what you say, for awhile, anyhow," Kincade replied,
sulkily; "but somebody will suffer because of this outrage."</p>

<p>"I'll take the chances," Carter replied, laughingly. "Step out
lively, for I intend to get some sleep to-night."</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute," the fussy little constable cried, as he ran
to the side of the detective and whispered:</p>

<p>"I think we should take the silver with us. There may be more
of this gang who will come after it when they find we have nabbed
these two."</p>

<p>"I fancy it's safe," was the careless reply, "and whether it
is or not, we must wait until we see Fred again, for I haven't
the slightest idea where he hid it."</p>

<p>"But, you see&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Now, don't fret, my friend," the detective interrupted, determined
that Fred should take the silver himself to the maiden ladies.
"You have conducted the case so admirably thus far that it would
be a shame to run the risk of spoiling the job by loitering here
where there may be an attempt at a rescue."</p>

<p>This bit of flattery, coupled with the intimation that there
might be a fight, caused Archie to remain silent. He was eager
to be in town where he could relate his wonderful skill in trapping
the thieves, as well as his fear lest there should be a hand-to-hand
encounter with desperate men, and these desires caused him to
make every effort to land the prisoners in jail.</p>

<p>He even lost sight of the reward, for the time being, through
the anxiety to sing his own praises, and in his sternest tones,
which were not very dreadful, by the way, he urged Bud forward.</p>

<p>"If you make the slightest show of trying to run away, I'll put
a dozen bullets in your body," he said, and then, as he reached
for his weapon to further intimidate the prisoner, he discovered,
to his chagrin, that, as on a previous occasion, his revolver
was at home; but in its place, put there while he labored under
great excitement, was the tack-hammer, symbol of his trade as
bill-poster.</p>

<p>The two men went toward the road very meekly, evidently concluding
that submission was the best policy, and for once Carter made
a mistake.</p>

<p>Having worked up the case to such a satisfactory conclusion,
and believing these were the only two attach√©s of the circus in
the vicinity, he allowed Archie Jackson to manage matters from
this point.</p>

<p>The valiant constable, thinking only of the glory with which
he would cover himself as soon as he was at the hotel amid a throng
of his acquaintances, simply paid attention to the fact that the
prisoners were marching properly in front of him, heeding not
the rumble of distant wheels on the road beyond.</p>

<p>Kincade heard them, however, and he whispered softly to Bud:</p>

<p>"There's just a chance that some of our people are coming. I
heard Colonel Bandman say he should send Albers and Towsey back
to look up some harness that was left to be repaired, and this
is about the time they ought to be here."</p>

<p>"Much good it will do us with that fool of a Jackson ready to
shoot, the first move we make," Bud replied petulantly.</p>

<p>"Go on without so much talk," Archie cried fiercely, from the
rear. "You can't play any games on me."</p>

<p>"From what I've heard, you know pretty well how a man can shoot
in the dark, an' I'll take my chances of gettin' a bullet in the
back rather than go to jail for ten years or so. When I give the
word, run the best you know how."</p>

<p>Bud promised to obey; but from the tone of his voice it could
be told that he had much rather shoot at a person than act as
target himself, and Archie ordered the prisoners to quicken their
speed.</p>

<p>Carter was several paces in the rear, remaining in the background
in order, for the better carrying out of his own plans in regard
to Fred, it should appear as if the constable was the commanding
officer, and when the party arrived at the edge of the road where
Bud had fastened the horse, the rumble of the approaching team
could be heard very distinctly.</p>

<p>"Now's our time! Run for your life!" Kincade whispered, staring
up the road at the same instant, and as Bud followed at full speed
both shouted for help at the utmost strength of their lungs.</p>

<p>It was as if this daring attempt at escape deprived Archie of
all power of motion. He lost several valuable seconds staring
after his vanishing prisoners in speechless surprise, and followed
this officer-like proceeding by attempting to shoot the fugitives
with the tack-hammer.</p>

<p>Carter, although not anticipating anything of the kind, had his
wits about him, and, rushing past the bewildered constable, darted
up the road in silence. He was well armed; but did not care to
run the risk of killing one of the thieves, more especially since
he felt positive of overtaking both in a short time, owing to
the fact that the manacles upon their wrists would prevent them
from any extraordinary speed.</p>

<p>Neither Bud nor Kincade ceased to call for help, and almost before
Carter was well in pursuit a voice from the oncoming team could
be heard saying:</p>

<p>"That's some of our crowd. I'm sure nobody but Jake could yell
so loud."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> me!" Kincade shouted. "Hold hard, for there are
a couple of officers close behind!"</p>

<p>By the sounds which followed, Carter understood that the new-comers
were turning their wagon, preparatory to carrying the arrested
parties in the opposite direction, and he cried to the valiant
Archie, who as yet had not collected his scattered senses sufficiently
to join in the pursuit:</p>

<p>"Bring that team on here, and be quick about it!"</p>

<p>Now, to discharge a weapon would be to imperil the lives of the
new actors on the scene, and this was not to be thought of for
a moment. Carter strained every muscle to overtake his prisoners
before they could clamber into the wagon; but in vain.</p>

<p>Even in the gloom he could see the dark forms of the men as they
leaped into the rear of the vehicle, and in another instant the
horse was off at a full gallop in the direction from which he
had just come.</p>

<p>For the detective to go on afoot would have been folly, and once
more he cried for Archie to bring the team, which had been left
by the roadside when Kincade and Bud arrived.</p>

<p>The little constable had by this time managed to understand at
least a portion of what was going on around him, and, in a very
bungling fashion, was trying to unfasten the hitching-rein; but
he made such a poor job of it that Carter was forced to return
and do the work himself.</p>

<p>"Get in quickly," the detective said, sharply, as he led the
horse into the road, and following Archie, the two were soon riding
at a mad pace in pursuit, regardless alike of possible vehicles
to be met, or the danger of being overturned.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you shoot 'em when you had the chance?" Archie asked,
as soon as he realized the startling change in the condition of
affairs.</p>

<p>"Because that should be done only when a man is actually in fear
of his life, or believes a dangerous prisoner cannot be halted
in any other way."</p>

<p>"But that was the only chance of stoppin' them fellers."</p>

<p>"I'll have them before morning," was the quiet reply, as the
driver urged the horse to still greater exertions. "Those men
have been traveling a long distance, while our animal is fresh,
therefore it's only a question of time; but how does it happen
that you didn't shoot? I left the fellows in your charge."</p>

<p>"I was out putting up some bills this afternoon, and had my hammer
with me, of course. When we got ready for this trip, I felt on
the outside of my hip pocket, and made sure it was my revolver
that formed such a bunch."</p>

<p>"Another time I should advise you to be certain which of your
many offices you intend to represent," Carter said, quietly. "I'm
not positive, however, that we haven't cause to be thankful, for
somebody might have been hurt."</p>

<p>"There's no question about it, if I had been armed," was the
reply, in a blood-thirsty tone, for Archie was rapidly recovering
his alleged courage.</p>

<p>"And I, being in the rear, stood as good a chance of receiving
the bullet as did the men."</p>

<p>"You have never seen me shoot," the little constable said, proudly.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, I never did," Carter replied, and then the conversation
ceased, as they were at the forks of a road where it was necessary
to come to a halt in order to learn in which direction the fugitives
had gone.</p>

<p>This was soon ascertained, and as the detective applied the whip
vigorously, he said, warningly:</p>

<p>"Now keep your wits about you, for we are where they will try
to give us the slip, and it is more than possible Heyland and
Kincade may jump out of the wagon, leaving us to follow the team,
while they make good their escape."</p>

<p>Archie tried very hard to do as he was commanded; he stared into
darkness, able now and then to distinguish the outlines of the
vehicle in advance, and at the same time was forced to exert all
his strength to prevent being thrown from his seat, so recklessly
was Carter driving.</p>

<p>"We'll be upset," he finally said, in a mild tone of protest.
"The road seems to be very rough, and there must be considerable
danger in going at such a pace."</p>

<p>"No more for us than for them. I'll take a good many chances
rather than go back to Tottenville and admit that we allowed two
prisoners to escape after we had them ironed."</p>

<p>The little constable had nothing more to say. He also thought
it would be awkward to explain to his particular friends how,
after such a marvelous piece of detective work, the criminals
had got free. This, coupled with the story of his bruised hand,
would give the fun-loving inhabitants of the village an opportunity
to make his life miserable with pointless jokes and alleged witticisms,
therefore he shut his teeth firmly, resolved not to make any further
protest even though convinced that his life was actually in danger.</p>

<p>During half an hour the chase continued, and for at least twenty
minutes of this time the pursuers were so near the pursued that
it would have been impossible for either occupant of the wagon
to leap out unnoticed.</p>

<p>Now the foremost horse was beginning to show signs of fatigue,
owing to previous travel and the unusual load. Both whip and voice
was used to urge him on; but in vain, and Carter said, in a low
tone to Archie:</p>

<p>"The chase is nearly ended! Be ready to leap out the instant
we stop." Then, drawing his revolver, he cried, "There's no chance
of your giving us the slip. Pull up, or I shall fire! If the prisoners
are delivered to me at once there will be nothing said regarding
the effort to aid them in escaping; but a delay of five minutes
will result in imprisonment for the whole party."</p>

<p>Kincade's friends evidently recognized the folly of prolonging
the struggle, and, to save themselves from possible penalties
of the law, the driver shouted:</p>

<p>"I'll pull up. Look out that you don't run into us!"</p>

<p>It required no great effort to bring both the panting steeds
to a stand-still, and in a twinkling Carter was standing at one
side of the vehicle with his revolver in hand, while Archie, with
a boldness that surprised him afterward, stationed himself directly
opposite, holding the tack-hammer as if on the point of shooting
the culprits.</p>

<p>Kincade realized that it was best to submit to the inevitable
with a good grace, and he descended from the wagon, saying to
the little constable as he did so:</p>

<p>"Don't shoot! I'll agree to go peacefully."</p>

<p>"Then see that you behave yourself, or I'll blow the whole top
of your head off," Archie replied, in a blood-thirsty tone; but
at the same time he took very good care to keep the hammer out
of sight.</p>

<p>Bud Heyland resisted even now when those who had tried to aid
were ready to give him up.</p>

<p>"I won't go back!" he cried, kicking vigorously as the detective
attempted to pull him from the wagon. "I've done nothing for which
I can be arrested, and you shan't take me."</p>

<p>The long chase had exhausted all of Carter's patience, and he
was not disposed to spend many seconds in expostulating. Seizing
the kicking youth by one foot he dragged him with no gentle force
to the ground, and an instant later the men in the wagon drove
off, evidently preferring flight to the chances that the detective
would keep his promise.</p>

<p>"Bundle them into the carriage, and tie their legs," Carter said
to the constable, and in a very short space of time the thieves
were lying in the bottom of the vehicle unable to move hand or
foot.</p>

<p>Now that there was not the slightest possibility the culprits
could escape, Archie kept vigilant watch over them. The least
movement on the part of either, as Carter drove the tired horse
back to the village, was the signal for him to use his hammer
on any portion of their bodies which was most convenient, and
this repeated punishment must have caused Bud to remember how
often he had ill-treated those who were quite as unable to "strike
back" as he now was.</p>

<p>Not until the prisoners were safely lodged in the little building
which served as jail did Archie feel perfectly safe, and then
all his old pompous manner returned. But for the detective he
would have hurried away to tell the news, late in the night though
it was, for in his own opinion at least, this night's work had
shown him to be not only a true hero, but an able detective.</p>

<p>"It is considerably past midnight," Carter said, as they left
the jail, "and we have a great deal to do before this job is finished."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Are we to leave the silver and money?"</p>

<p>"Of course not; but you said we'd have to wait until we saw Fred."</p>

<p>"Exactly so; but what is to prevent our doing that now? When
the property has been delivered to its rightful owners you and
I can take our ease; until then we are bound to keep moving."</p>

<p>Archie was disappointed at not being able to establish, without
loss of time, his claim to being a great man; but he had no idea
of allowing anything to be done in the matter when he was not
present, if it could be avoided, and he clambered into the wagon
once more.</p>

<p>The two drove directly to the Sheldon home, and Fred was dreaming
that burglars were trying to get into the house, when he suddenly
became conscious that some one was pounding vigorously on the
front door.</p>

<p>Leaping from the bed and looking out of the window he was surprised
at seeing the man whom he knew as Cyrus Sutton, and at the same
moment he heard his mother ask:</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Mr. Carter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, except that we want Fred. The case is closed, and to
save time we'd better get the property at once. Have you any objection
to his going with me?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest. I will awaken him."</p>

<p>"I'll be down in a minute," Fred cried, as he began to make a
hurried toilet, wondering meanwhile why Bud Heyland's friend should
be trusted so implicitly by his mother.</p>

<p>As a matter of course it was necessary for Mrs. Sheldon to explain
to her son who Cyrus Sutton really was and Fred was still in a
maze of bewilderment when his mother admitted the detective.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me," he cried reproachfully.</p>

<p>"No good could have come of it," the gentleman replied laughingly,
"and, besides, I can't see how you failed to discover the secret,
either when you ran away after listening behind the rock on the
road-side, or when I passed so near while supposed to be hunting
for you."</p>

<p>"Did you see me then?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, and but for such slight obstructions as I placed
in Bud's way, he might have overtaken you."</p>

<p>"Where is Archie?"</p>

<p>"Out in the wagon waiting for you. Kincade and Bud are in the
lock-up where we just left them, and now it is proposed to get
the silver in order to deliver it early in the morning."</p>

<p>"Did mother tell you I found it?"</p>

<p>"She did, and I am heartily glad, since now the reward will be
yours, and with it you can clear your home from debt."</p>

<p>Fred did not wait to ask any further questions. In a very few
moments he was ready for the journey, and, with the promise to
"come home as soon as the work was done," he went out to where
Archie greeted him in the most effusive manner.</p>

<p>"We have covered ourselves with glory," the little constable
cried. "This is a case which will be told throughout the country,
and the fact that we arrested the culprits and recovered the property
when there was absolutely no clew on which to work, is something
unparalleled in the annals of detective history."</p>

<p>Fred was neither prepared to agree to, nor dispute this statement.
The only fact which remained distinct in his mind was that the
reward would be his, and if there was any glory attached he felt
perfectly willing Archie should take it all.</p>

<p>"Get into the wagon, Fred," Carter said impatiently. "It will
take us until daylight to get the stuff, and we don't want to
shock the good people of Tottenville by doing too much driving
after sunrise."</p>

<p>Fred obeyed without delay, and during the ride Archie gave him
all the particulars concerning the capture of the thieves, save
in regard to his own stupidity which permitted the temporary escape.</p>

<p>Knowing the woods in the vicinity of his home as well as Fred
did, it was not difficult for him to go directly to the place
where he had hidden the silver, even in the night, and half an
hour later the stolen service was in the carriage.</p>

<p>"It is nearly daylight," Carter said, when they were driving
in the direction of the village again, "and the best thing we
can do will be to go to Fred's home, where he and I can keep guard
over the treasure until it is a proper time to return it to its
owners."</p>

<p>"In that case I may as well go home awhile," Archie said reflectively.
"Doubtless my wife will be wondering what has kept me, and there
is no need of three to watch the silver."</p>

<p>"Very well, we shall not leave there until about nine o'clock,"
and Carter reined in the horse as they were in front of the fussy
little constable's house, for him to alight.</p>
