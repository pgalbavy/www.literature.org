<p>Before following the commissary into the manager's office I must
describe certain extraordinary occurrences that took place in
that office which Remy and Mercier had vainly tried to enter and
into which <em>MM. </em>Richard and Moncharmin had locked themselves
with an object which the reader does not yet know, but which it
is my duty, as an historian, to reveal without further postponement.</p>

<p>I have had occasion to say that the managers' mood had undergone
a disagreeable change for some time past and to convey the fact
that this change was due not only to the fall of the chandelier
on the famous night of the gala performance.</p>

<p>The reader must know that the ghost had calmly been paid his
first twenty thousand francs.  Oh, there had been wailing and
gnashing of teeth, indeed!  And yet the thing had happened as
simply as could be.</p>

<p>One morning, the managers found on their table an envelope addressed
to "Monsieur O. G. (private)" and accompanied by a note from O.
G. himself:</p>

<p>The time has come to carry out the clause in the memorandum-book.
Please put twenty notes of a thousand francs each into this envelope,
seal it with your own seal and hand it to Mme. Giry, who will
do what is necessary.</p>

<p>The managers did not hesitate; without wasting time in asking
how these confounded communications came to be delivered in an
office which they were careful to keep locked, they seized this
opportunity of laying hands, on the mysterious blackmailer.  And,
after telling the whole story, under the promise of secrecy, to
Gabriel and Mercier, they put the twenty thousand francs into
the envelope and without asking for explanations, handed it to
Mme. Giry, who had been reinstated in her functions.  The box-keeper
displayed no astonishment.  I need hardly say that she was well
watched.  She went straight to the ghost's box and placed the
precious envelope on the little shelf attached to the ledge. 
The two managers, as well as Gabriel and Mercier, were hidden
in such a way that they did not lose sight of the envelope for
a second during the performance and even afterward, for, as the
envelope had not moved, those who watched it did not move either;
and Mme. Giry went away while the managers, Gabriel and Mercier
were still there.  At last, they became tired of waiting and opened
the envelope, after ascertaining that the seals had not been broken.</p>

<p>At first sight, Richard and Moncharmin thought that the notes
were still there; but soon they perceived that they were not the
same.  The twenty real notes were gone and had been replaced by
twenty notes, of the "Bank of St. Farce"![1]</p>

<p>The managers' rage and fright were unmistakable.  Moncharmin
wanted to send for the commissary of police, but Richard objected. 
He no doubt had a plan, for he said:</p>

<p>"Don't let us make ourselves ridiculous!  All Paris would laugh
at us. O. G. has won the first game:  we will win the second."</p>

<p>He was thinking of the next month's allowance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they had been so absolutely tricked that they were
bound to suffer a certain dejection.  And, upon my word, it was
not difficult to understand.  We must not forget that the managers
had an idea at the back of their minds, all the time, that this
strange incident might be an unpleasant practical joke on the
part of their predecessors and that it would not do to divulge
it prematurely.  On the other hand, Moncharmin was sometimes troubled
with a suspicion of Richard himself, who occasionally took fanciful
whims into his head.  And so they were content to await events,
while keeping an eye on Mother Giry.  Richard would not have her
spoken to.</p>

<p>"If she is a confederate," he said, "the notes are gone long
ago.  But, in my opinion, she is merely an idiot."</p>

<p>"She's not the only idiot in this business," said Moncharmin
pensively.</p>

<p>"Well, who could have thought it?" moaned Richard.  "But don't
be afraid ... next time, I shall have taken my precautions."</p>

<p>The next time fell on the same day that beheld the disappearance
of Christine Daae.  In the morning, a note from the ghost reminded
them that the money was due.  It read:</p>

<p>Do just as you did last time.  It went very well.  Put the twenty
thousand in the envelope and hand it to our excellent Mme. Giry.</p>

<p>And the note was accompanied by the usual envelope.  They had
only to insert the notes.</p>

<p>This was done about half an hour before the curtain rose on the
first act of Faust.  Richard showed the envelope to Moncharmin. 
Then he counted the twenty thousand-franc notes in front of him
and put the notes into the envelope, but without closing it.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, "let's have Mother Giry in."</p>

<p>The old woman was sent for.  She entered with a sweeping courtesy. 
She still wore her black taffeta dress, the color of which was
rapidly turning to rust and lilac, to say nothing of the dingy
bonnet.  She seemed in a good temper.  She at once said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, gentlemen!  It's for the envelope, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mme. Giry," said Richard, most amiably.  "For the envelope
... and something else besides."</p>

<p>"At your service, M. Richard, at your service.  And what is the
something else, please?"</p>

<p>"First of all, Mme. Giry, I have a little question to put to
you."</p>

<p>"By all means, M. Richard:  Mme. Giry is here to answer you."</p>

<p>"Are you still on good terms with the ghost?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't be better, sir; couldn't be better."</p>

<p>"Ah, we are delighted ...  Look here, Mme. Giry," said Richard,
in the tone of making an important confidence.  "We may just as
well tell you, among ourselves ... you're no fool!"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," exclaimed the box-keeper, stopping the pleasant nodding
of the black feathers in her dingy bonnet, "I assure you no one
has ever doubted that!"</p>

<p>"We are quite agreed and we shall soon understand one another. 
The story of the ghost is all humbug, isn't it? ... Well, still
between ourselves, ... it has lasted long enough."</p>

<p>Mme. Giry looked at the managers as though they were talking
Chinese. She walked up to Richard's table and asked, rather anxiously:</p>

<p>"What do you mean?  I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Oh, you, understand quite well.  In any case, you've got to
understand...  And, first of all, tell us his name."</p>

<p>"Whose name?"</p>

<p>"The name of the man whose accomplice you are, Mme. Giry!"</p>

<p>"I am the ghost's accomplice?  I? ... His accomplice in what,
pray?"</p>

<p>"You do all he wants."</p>

<p>"Oh!  He's not very troublesome, you know."</p>

<p>"And does he still tip you?"</p>

<p>"I mustn't complain."</p>

<p>"How much does he give you for bringing him that envelope?"</p>

<p>"Ten francs."</p>

<p>"You poor thing!  That's not much, is it?</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you that presently, Mme. Giry.  Just now we should
like to know for what extraordinary reason you have given yourself
body and soul, to this ghost ... Mme. Giry's friendship and devotion
are not to be bought for five francs or ten francs."</p>

<p>"That's true enough ...  And I can tell you the reason, sir. 
There's no disgrace about it...  on the contrary."</p>

<p>"We're quite sure of that, Mme. Giry!"</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this ... only the ghost doesn't like me to talk
about his business."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" sneered Richard.</p>

<p>"But this is a matter that concerns myself alone ...  Well, it
was in Box Five one evening, I found a letter addressed to myself,
a sort of note written in red ink.  I needn't read the letter
to you sir; I know it by heart, and I shall never forget it if
I live to be a hundred!"</p>

<p>And Mme. Giry, drawing herself up, recited the letter with touching
eloquence:</p>

<p><em>MADAM</em>:</p>

<p>1825.  Mlle. Menetrier, leader of the ballet, became Marquise
de Cussy.</p>

<p>1832.  Mlle. Marie Taglioni, a dancer, became Comtesse Gilbert
des Voisins.</p>

<p>1846.  La Sota, a dancer, married a brother of the King of Spain.</p>

<p>1847.  Lola Montes, a dancer, became the morganatic wife of King
Louis of Bavaria and was created Countess of Landsfeld.</p>

<p>1848.  Mlle. Maria, a dancer, became Baronne d'Herneville.</p>

<p>1870.  Theresa Hessier, a dancer, married Dom Fernando, brother
to the King of Portugal.</p>

<p>Richard and Moncharmin listened to the old woman, who, as she
proceeded with the enumeration of these glorious nuptials, swelled
out, took courage and, at last, in a voice bursting with pride,
flung out the last sentence of the prophetic letter:</p>

<p>1885.  Meg Giry, Empress!</p>

<p>Exhausted by this supreme effort, the box-keeper fell into a
chair, saying:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, the letter was signed, 'Opera Ghost.'  I had heard
much of the ghost, but only half believed in him.  From the day
when he declared that my little Meg, the flesh of my flesh, the
fruit of my womb, would be empress, I believed in him altogether."</p>

<p>And really it was not necessary to make a long study of Mme.
Giry's excited features to understand what could be got out of
that fine intellect with the two words "ghost" and "empress."</p>

<p>But who pulled the strings of that extraordinary puppet?  That
was the question.</p>

<p>"You have never seen him; he speaks to you and you believe all
he says?" asked Moncharmin.</p>

<p>"Yes.  To begin with, I owe it to him that my little Meg was
promoted to be the leader of a row.  I said to the ghost, 'If
she is to be empress in 1885, there is no time to lose; she must
become a leader at once.' He said, 'Look upon it as done.'  And
he had only a word to say to M. Poligny and the thing was done."</p>

<p>"So you see that M. Poligny saw him!"</p>

<p>"No, not any more than I did; but he heard him.  The ghost said
a word in his ear, you know, on the evening when he left Box Five,
looking so dreadfully pale."</p>

<p>Moncharmin heaved a sigh.  "What a business!" he groaned.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mme. Giry.  "I always thought there were secrets between
the ghost and M. Poligny.  Anything that the ghost asked M. Poligny
to do M. Poligny did.  M. Poligny could refuse the ghost nothing."</p>

<p>"You hear, Richard:  Poligny could refuse the ghost nothing."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I hear!" said Richard.  "M. Poligny is a friend of
the ghost; and, as Mme. Giry is a friend of M. Poligny, there
we are!  ... But I don't care a hang about M. Poligny," he added
roughly.  "The only person whose fate really interests me is Mme.
Giry...  Mme. Giry, do you know what is in this envelope?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course not," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, look."</p>

<p>Mine.  Giry looked into the envelope with a lackluster eye, which
soon recovered its brilliancy.</p>

<p>"Thousand-franc notes!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mme. Giry, thousand-franc notes!  And you knew it!"</p>

<p>"I, sir?  I? ... I swear ..."</p>

<p>"Don't swear, Mme. Giry! ... And now I will tell you the second
reason why I sent for you.  Mme. Giry, I am going to have you
arrested."</p>

<p>The two black feathers on the dingy bonnet, which usually affected
the attitude of two notes of interrogation, changed into two notes
of exclamation; as for the bonnet itself, it swayed in menace
on the old lady's tempestuous chignon.  Surprise, indignation,
protest and dismay were furthermore displayed by little Meg's
mother in a sort of extravagant movement of offended virtue, half
bound, half slide, that brought her right under the nose of M.
Richard, who could not help pushing back his chair.</p>

<p>"<em>HAVE ME ARRESTED</em>!"</p>

<p>The mouth that spoke those words seemed to spit the three teeth
that were left to it into Richard's face.</p>

<p>M. Richard behaved like a hero.  He retreated no farther.  His
threatening forefinger seemed already to be pointing out the keeper
of Box Five to the absent magistrates.</p>

<p>"I am going to have you arrested, Mme. Giry, as a thief!"</p>

<p>"Say that again!"</p>

<p>And Mme. Giry caught Mr. Manager Richard a mighty box on the
ear, before Mr. Manager Moncharmin had time to intervene.  But
it was not the withered hand of the angry old beldame that fell
on the managerial ear, but the envelope itself, the cause of all
the trouble, the magic envelope that opened with the blow, scattering
the bank-notes, which escaped in a fantastic whirl of giant butterflies.</p>

<p>The two managers gave a shout, and the same thought made them
both go on their knees, feverishly, picking up and hurriedly examining
the precious scraps of paper.</p>

<p>"Are they still genuine, Moncharmin?"</p>

<p>"Are they still genuine, Richard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they are still genuine!"</p>

<p>Above their heads, Mme. Giry's three teeth were clashing in a
noisy contest, full of hideous interjections.  But all that could
be clearly distinguished was this <em>LEIT-MOTIF</em>:</p>

<p>"I, a thief! ... I, a thief, I?"</p>

<p>She choked with rage.  She shouted:</p>

<p>"I never heard of such a thing!"</p>

<p>And, suddenly, she darted up to Richard again.</p>

<p>"In any case," she yelped, "you, M. Richard, ought to know better
than I where the twenty thousand francs went to!"</p>

<p>"I?" asked Richard, astounded.  "And how should I know?"</p>

<p>Moncharmin, looking severe and dissatisfied, at once insisted
that the good lady should explain herself.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Mme. Giry?" he asked.  "And why do you
say that M. Richard ought to know better than you where the twenty-thousand
francs went to?"</p>

<p>As for Richard, who felt himself turning red under Moncharmin's
eyes, he took Mme. Giry by the wrist and shook it violently. 
In a voice growling and rolling like thunder, he roared:</p>

<p>"Why should I know better than you where the twenty-thousand
francs went to?  Why?  Answer me!"</p>

<p>"Because they went into your pocket!" gasped the old woman, looking
at him as if he were the devil incarnate.</p>

<p>Richard would have rushed upon Mme. Giry, if Moncharmin had not
stayed his avenging hand and hastened to ask her, more gently:</p>

<p>"How can you suspect my partner, M. Richard, of putting twenty-thousand
francs in his pocket?"</p>

<p>"I never said that," declared Mme. Giry, "seeing that it was
myself who put the twenty-thousand francs into M. Richard's pocket."
And she added, under her voice, "There!  It's out! ... And may
the ghost forgive me!"</p>

<p>Richard began bellowing anew, but Moncharmin authoritatively
ordered him to be silent.</p>

<p>"Allow me!  Allow me!  Let the woman explain herself.  Let me
question her."  And he added:  "It is really astonishing that
you should take up such a tone! ... We are on the verge of clearing
up the whole mystery. And you're in a rage! ... You're wrong to
behave like that...  I'm enjoying myself immensely."</p>

<p>Mme. Giry, like the martyr that she was, raised her head, her
face beaming with faith in her own innocence.</p>

<p>"You tell me there were twenty-thousand francs in the envelope
which I put into M. Richard's pocket; but I tell you again that
I knew nothing about it ...  Nor M. Richard either, for that matter!"</p>

<p>"Aha!" said Richard, suddenly assuming a swaggering air which
Moncharmin did not like.  "I knew nothing either!  You put twenty-thousand
francs in my pocket and I knew nothing either!  I am very glad
to hear it, Mme. Giry!"</p>

<p>"Yes," the terrible dame agreed, "yes, it's true.  We neither
of us knew anything.  But you, you must have ended by finding
out!"</p>

<p>Richard would certainly have swallowed Mme. Giry alive, if Moncharmin
had not been there!  But Moncharmin protected her.  He resumed
his questions:</p>

<p>"What sort of envelope did you put in M. Richard's pocket?  It
was not the one which we gave you, the one which you took to Box
Five before our eyes; and yet that was the one which contained
the twenty-thousand francs."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon.  The envelope which M. le Directeur gave
me was the one which I slipped into M. le Directeur's pocket,"
explained Mme. Giry.  "The one which I took to the ghost's box
was another envelope, just like it, which the ghost gave me beforehand
and which I hid up my sleeve."</p>

<p>So saying, Mme. Giry took from her sleeve an envelope ready prepared
and similarly addressed to that containing the twenty-thousand
francs. The managers took it from her.  They examined it and saw
that it was fastened with seals stamped with their own managerial
seal.  They opened it.  It contained twenty Bank of St. Farce
notes like those which had so much astounded them the month before.</p>

<p>"How simple!" said Richard.</p>

<p>"How simple!" repeated Moncharmin.  And he continued with his
eyes fixed upon Mme. Giry, as though trying to hypnotize her.</p>

<p>"So it was the ghost who gave you this envelope and told you
to substitute it for the one which we gave you?  And it was the
ghost who told you to put the other into M. Richard's pocket?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was the ghost."</p>

<p>"Then would you mind giving us a specimen of your little talents? 
Here is the envelope.  Act as though we knew nothing."</p>

<p>"As you please, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Mme. Giry took the envelope with the twenty notes inside it and
made for the door.  She was on the point of going out when the
two managers rushed at her:</p>

<p>"Oh, no!  Oh, no!  We're not going to be 'done' a second time! 
Once bitten, twice shy!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen," said the old woman, in self-excuse,
"you told me to act as though you knew nothing ...  Well, if you
knew nothing, I should go away with your envelope!"</p>

<p>"And then how would you slip it into my pocket?" argued Richard,
whom Moncharmin fixed with his left eye, while keeping his right
on Mme. Giry:  a proceeding likely to strain his sight, but Moncharmin
was prepared to go to any length to discover the truth.</p>

<p>"I am to slip it into your pocket when you least expect it, sir. 
You know that I always take a little turn behind the scenes, in
the course of the evening, and I often go with my daughter to
the ballet-foyer, which I am entitled to do, as her mother; I
bring her her shoes, when the ballet is about to begin ... in
fact, I come and go as I please ... The subscribers come and go
too...  So do you, sir ...  There are lots of people about ... 
I go behind you and slip the envelope into the tail-pocket of
your dress-coat ...  There's no witchcraft about that!"</p>

<p>"No witchcraft!" growled Richard, rolling his eyes like Jupiter
Tonans. "No witchcraft!  Why, I've just caught you in a lie, you
old witch!"</p>

<p>Mme. Giry bristled, with her three teeth sticking out of her
mouth.</p>

<p>"And why, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I spent that evening watching Box Five and the sham
envelope which you put there.  I did not go to the ballet-foyer
for a second."</p>

<p>"No, sir, and I did not give you the envelope that evening, but
at the next performance ... on the evening when the under-secretary
of state for fine arts ..."</p>

<p>At these words, M. Richard suddenly interrupted Mme. Giry:</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true, I remember now!  The under-secretary went
behind the scenes.  He asked for me.  I went down to the ballet-foyer
for a moment.  I was on the foyer steps ...  The under-secretary
and his chief clerk were in the foyer itself.  I suddenly turned
around ... you had passed behind me, Mme. Giry ...  You seemed
to push against me ... Oh, I can see you still, I can see you
still!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it, sir, that's it.  I had just finished my little
business.  That pocket of yours, sir, is very handy!"</p>

<p>And Mme. Giry once more suited the action to the word, She passed
behind M. Richard and, so nimbly that Moncharmin himself was impressed
by it, slipped the envelope into the pocket of one of the tails
of M. Richard's dress-coat.</p>

<p>"Of course!" exclaimed Richard, looking a little pale.  "It's
very clever of O. G.  The problem which he had to solve was this:
how to do away with any dangerous intermediary between the man
who gives the twenty-thousand francs and the man who receives
it.  And by far the best thing he could hit upon was to come and
take the money from my pocket without my noticing it, as I myself
did not know that it was there.  It's wonderful!"</p>

<p>"Oh, wonderful, no doubt!"  Moncharmin agreed.  "Only, you forget,
Richard, that I provided ten-thousand francs of the twenty and
that nobody put anything in my pocket!"</p>
