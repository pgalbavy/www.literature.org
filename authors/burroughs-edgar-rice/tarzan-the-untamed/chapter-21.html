<P>
As Smith-Oldwick realized that he was alone and practi-
cally defenseless in an enclosure filled with great lions
 he was, in his weakened condition, almost in a state
verging upon hysterical terror. Clinging to the grating for
support he dared not turn his head in the direction of the
beasts behind him. He felt his knees giving weakly beneath
him. Something within his head spun rapidly around. He be-
came very dizzy and nauseated and then suddenly all went
black before his eyes as his limp body collapsed at the foot
of the grating.
<P>
How long he lay there unconscious he never knew; but as
reason slowly reasserted itself in his semi-conscious state he
was aware that he lay in a cool bed upon the whitest of linen
in a bright and cheery room, and that upon one side close to
him was an open window, the delicate hangings of which
were fluttering in a soft summer breeze which blew in from a
sun-kissed orchard of ripening fruit which he could see with-
out -- an old orchard in which soft, green grass grew between
the laden trees, and where the sun filtered through the foliage;
and upon the dappled greensward a little child was playing
with a frolicsome puppy.
<P>
"God," thought the man, "what a horrible nightmare I have
passed through!" and then he felt a hand stroking his brow and
cheek -- a cool and gentle hand that smoothed away his
troubled recollections. For a long minute Smith-Oldwick lay
in utter peace and content until gradually there was forced
upon his sensibilities the fact that the hand had become
rough, and that it was no longer cool but hot and moist; and
suddenly he opened his eyes and looked up into the face of a
huge lion.
<P>
Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick was not only an
English gentleman and an officer in name, he was also what
these implied -- a brave man; but when he realized that the
sweet picture he had looked upon was but the figment of a
dream, and that in reality he still lay where he had fallen at
the foot of the grating with a lion standing over him licking his
face, the tears sprang to his eyes and ran down his cheeks.
Never, he thought, had an unkind fate played so cruel a joke
upon a human being.
<P>
For some time he lay feigning death while the lion, having
ceased to lick him, sniffed about his body. There are some
things than which death is to be preferred; and there came at
last to the Englishman the realization that it would be better
to die swiftly than to lie in this horrible predicament until his
mind broke beneath the strain and he went mad.
<P>
And so, deliberately and without haste, he rose, clinging to
the grating for support. At his first move the lion growled,
but after that he paid no further attention to the man, and
when at last Smith-Oldwick had regained his feet the lion
moved indifferently away. Then it was that the man turned
and looked about the enclosure.
<P>
Sprawled beneath the shade of the trees and lying upon the
long bench beside the south wall the great beasts rested, with
the exception of two or three who moved restlessly about. It
was these that the man feared and yet when two more of them
had passed him by he began to feel reassured, recalling the
fact that they were accustomed to the presence of man.
<P>
And yet he dared not move from the grating. As the man
examined his surroundings he noted that the branches of one
of the trees near the further wall spread close beneath an open
window. If he could reach that tree and had strength to
do so, he could easily climb out upon the branch and escape,
at least, from the enclosure of the lions. But in order to
reach the tree he must pass the full length of the enclosure,
and at the very bole of the tree itself two lions lay sprawled
out in slumber.
<P>
For half an hour the man stood gazing longingly at this
seeming avenue of escape, and at last, with a muttered oath,
he straightened up and throwing back his shoulders in a ges-
ture of defiance, he walked slowly and deliberately down the
center of the courtyard. One of the prowling lions turned
from the side wall and moved toward the center directly in
the man's path, but Smith-Oldwick was committed to what he
considered his one chance, for even temporary safety, and so
he kept on, ignoring the presence of the beast. The lion
slouched to his side and sniffed him and then, growling, he
bared his teeth.
<P>
Smith-Oldwick drew the pistol from his shirt. "If he has
made up his mind to kill me," he thought. "I can't see that it
will make any difference in the long run whether I infuriate
him or not. The beggar can't kill me any deader in one mood
than another."
<P>
But with the man's movement in withdrawing the weapon
from his shirt the lion's attitude suddenly altered and though
he still growled he turned and sprang away, and then at last
the Englishman stood almost at the foot of the tree that was his
goal, and between him and safety sprawled a sleeping lion.
<P>
Above him was a limb that ordinarily he could have leaped
for and reached with ease; but weak from his wounds and loss
of blood he doubted his ability to do so now. There was even
a question as to whether he would be able to ascend the tree
at all. There was just one chance: the lowest branch left the
bole within easy reach of a man standing on the ground close
to the tree's stem, but to reach a position where the branch
would be accessible he must step over the body of a lion.
Taking a deep breath he placed one foot between the sprawled
legs of the beast and gingerly raised the other to plant it upon
the opposite side of the tawny body. "What," he thought, "if
the beggar should happen to wake now?" The suggestion
sent a shudder through his frame but he did not hesitate or
withdraw his foot. Gingerly he planted it beyond the lion,
threw his weight forward upon it and cautiously brought his
other foot to the side of the first. He had passed and the lion
had not awakened.
<P>
Smith-Oldwick was weak from loss of blood and the hard-
ships he had undergone, but the realization of his situation
impelled him to a show of agility and energy which he prob-
ably could scarcely have equaled when in possession of his
normal strength. With his life depending upon the success of
his efforts, he swung himself quickly to the lower branches of
the tree and scrambled upward out of reach of possible harm
from the lions below -- though the sudden movement in the
branches above them awakened both the sleeping beasts. The
animals raised their heads and looked questioningly up for a
moment and then lay back again to resume their broken
slumber.
<P>
So easily had the Englishman succeeded thus far that he
suddenly began to question as to whether he had at any time
been in real danger. The lions, as he knew, were accustomed
to the presence of men, but yet they were still lions and he
was free to admit that he breathed more easily now that he was
safe above their clutches.
<P>
Before him lay the open window he had seen from the
ground. He was now on a level with it and could see an
apparently unoccupied chamber beyond, and toward this he
made his way along a stout branch that swung beneath the
opening. It was not a difficult feat to reach the window, and
a moment later he drew himself over the sill and dropped
into the room.
<P>
He found himself in a rather spacious apartment, the floor of
which was covered with rugs of barbaric design, while the few
pieces of furniture were of a similar type to that which he had
seen in the room on the first floor into which he and Bertha
Kircher had been ushered at the conclusion of their journey.
At one end of the room was what appeared to be a curtained
alcove, the heavy hangings of which completely hid the inte-
rior. In the wall opposite the window and near the alcove was
a closed door, apparently the only exit from the room.
<P>
He could see, in the waning light without, that the close of
the day was fast approaching, and he hesitated while he de-
liberated the advisability of waiting until darkness had fallen,
or of immediately searching for some means of escape from the
building and the city. He at last decided that it would do no
harm to investigate beyond the room, that he might have some
idea as how best to plan his escape after dark. To this end he
crossed the room toward the door but he had taken only a
few steps when the hangings before the alcove separated and
the figure of a woman appeared in the opening.
<P>
She was young and beautifully formed; the single drapery
wound around her body from below her breasts left no detail
of her symmetrical proportions unrevealed, but her face was
the face of an imbecile. At sight of her Smith-Oldwick halted,
momentarily expecting that his presence would elicit screams
for help from her. On the contrary she came toward him
smiling, and when she was close her slender, shapely fingers
touched the sleeve of his torn blouse as a curious child might
handle a new toy, and still with the same smile she examined
him from head to foot, taking in, in childish wonderment,
every detail of his apparel.
<P>
Presently she spoke to him in a soft, well-modulated voice
which contrasted sharply with her facial appearance. The
voice and the girlish figure harmonized perfectly and seemed
to belong to each other, while the head and face were those
of another creature. Smith-Oldwick could understand no word
of what she said, but nevertheless he spoke to her in his
own cultured tone, the effect of which upon her was evidently
most gratifying, for before he realized her intentions or could
prevent her she had thrown both arms about his neck and was
kissing him with the utmost abandon.
<P>
The man tried to free himself from her rather surprising
attentions, but she only clung more tightly to him, and sud-
denly, as he recalled that he had always heard that one must
humor the mentally deficient, and at the same time seeing in
her a possible agency of escape, he dosed his eyes and re-
turned her embraces.
<P>
It was at this juncture that the door opened and a man
entered. With the sound from the first movement of the latch,
Smith-Oldwick opened his eyes, but though he endeavored to
disengage himself from the girl he realized that the newcomer
had seen their rather compromising position. The girl, whose
back was toward the door, seemed at first not to realize that
someone had entered, but when she did she turned quickly
and as her eyes fell upon the man whose terrible face was now
distorted with an expression of hideous rage she turned,
screaming, and fled toward the alcove. The Englishman,
flushed and embarrassed, stood where she had left him. With
the sudden realization of the futility of attempting an explana-
tion, came that of the menacing appearance of the man, whom
he now recognized as the official who had received them in the
room below. The fellow's face, livid with insane rage and,
possibly, jealousy, was twitching violently, accentuating the
maniacal expression that it habitually wore.
<P>
For a moment he seemed paralyzed by anger, and then with
a loud shriek that rose into an uncanny wail, he drew his
curved saber and sprang toward the Englishman. To Smith-
Oldwick there seemed no possible hope of escaping the keen-
edged weapon in the hands of the infuriated man, and though
he felt assured that it would draw down upon him an equally
sudden and possibly more terrible death, he did the only thing
that remained for him to do -- drew his pistol and fired straight
for the heart of the oncoming man. Without even so much as
a groan the fellow lunged forward upon the floor at Smith-
Oldwick's feet -- killed instantly with a bullet through the
heart. For several seconds the silence of the tomb reigned in
the apartment.
<P>
The Englishman, standing over the prostrate figure of the
dead man, watched the door with drawn weapon, expecting
momentarily to hear the rush of feet of those whom he was
sure would immediately investigate the report of the pistol.
But no sounds came from below to indicate that anyone there
had heard the explosion, and presently the man's attention
was distracted from the door to the alcove, between the hang-
ings of which the face of the girl appeared. The eyes were
widely dilated and the lower jaw dropped in an expression of
surprise and awe.
<P>
The girl's gaze was riveted upon the figure upon the floor,
and presently she crept stealthily into the room and tiptoed
toward the corpse. She appeared as though constantly poised
for flight, and when she had come to within two or three feet
of the body she stopped and, looking up at Smith-Oldwick,
voiced some interrogation which he could not, of course, un-
derstand. Then she came close to the side of the dead man
and kneeling upon the floor felt gingerly of the body.
<P>
Presently she shook the corpse by the shoulder, and then
with a show of strength which her tenderly girlish form belied,
she turned the body over on its back. If she had been in
doubt before, one glance at the hideous features set in death
must have convinced her that life was extinct, and with the
realization there broke from her lips peal after peal of mad,
maniacal laughter as with her little hands she beat upon the
upturned face and breast of the dead man. It was a gruesome
sight from which the Englishman involuntarily drew back --
a gruesome, disgusting sight such as, he realized, might never
be witnessed outside a madhouse or this frightful city.
<P>
In the midst of her frenzied rejoicing at the death of the
man, and Smith-Oldwick could attribute her actions to no
other cause, she suddenly desisted from her futile attacks upon
the insensate flesh and, leaping to her feet, ran quickly to the
door, where she shot a wooden bolt into its socket, thus secur-
ing them from interference from without. Then she returned
to the center of the room and spoke rapidly to the Englishman,
gesturing occasionally toward the body of the slain man. When
he could not understand, she presently became provoked and
in a sudden hysteria of madness she rushed forward as though
to strike the Englishman. Smith-Oldwick dropped back a
few steps and leveled his pistol upon her. Mad though she
must have been, she evidently was not so mad but what she
had connected the loud report, the diminutive weapon, and the
sudden death of the man in whose house she dwelt, for she
instantly desisted and quite as suddenly as it had come upon
her, her homicidal mood departed.
<P>
Again the vacuous, imbecile smile took possession of her
features, and her voice, dropping its harshness, resumed the
soft, well-modulated tones with which she had first addressed
him. Now she attempted by signs to indicate her wishes, and
motioning Smith-Oldwick to follow her she went to the hang-
ings and opening them disclosed the alcove. It was rather
more than an alcove, being a fair-sized room heavy with rugs
and hangings and soft, pillowed couches. Turning at the
entrance she pointed to the corpse upon the floor of the outer
room, and then crossing the alcove she raised some draperies
which covered a couch and fell to the floor upon all sides,
disclosing an opening beneath the furniture.
<P>
To this opening she pointed and then again to the corpse,
indicating plainly to the Englishman that it was her desire
that the body be hidden here. But if he had been in doubt,
she essayed to dispel it by grasping his sleeve and urging him
in the direction of the body which the two of them then lifted
and half carried and half dragged into the alcove. At first
they encountered some difficulty when they endeavored to
force the body of the man into the small space she had selected
for it, but eventually they succeeded in doing so. Smith-Old-
wick was again impressed by the fiendish brutality of the girl.
In the center of the room lay a blood-stained rug which the
girl quickly gathered up and draped over a piece of furniture
in such a way that the stain was hidden. By rearranging the
other rugs and by bringing one from the alcove she restored
the room to order so no outward indication of the tragedy so
recently enacted there was apparent.
<P>
These things attended to, and the hangings draped once
more about the couch that they might hide the gruesome thing
beneath, the girl once more threw her arms about the English-
man's neck and dragged him toward the soft and luxurious
pillows above the dead man. Acutely conscious of the horror
of his position, filled with loathing, disgust, and an outraged
sense of decency, Smith-Oldwick was also acutely alive to the
demands of self-preservation. He felt that he was warranted
in buying his life at almost any price; but there was a point at
which his finer nature rebelled.
<P>
It was at this juncture that a loud knock sounded upon the
door of the outer room. Springing from the couch, the girl
seized the man by the arm and dragged him after her to the
wall close by the head of the couch. Here she drew back one
of the hangings, revealing a little niche behind, into which she
shoved the Englishman and dropped the hangings before him,
effectually hiding him from observation from the rooms be-
yond.
<P>
He heard her cross the alcove to the door of the outer room,
and heard the bolt withdrawn followed by the voice of a man
mingled with that of the girl. The tones of both seemed
rational so that he might have been listening to an ordinary
conversation in some foreign tongue. Yet with the gruesome
experiences of the day behind him, he could not but momen-
tarily expect some insane outbreak from beyond the hangings.
<P>
He was aware from the sounds that the two had entered
the alcove, and, prompted by a desire to know what manner
of man he might next have to contend with, he slightly parted
the heavy folds that hid the two from his view and looking out
saw them sitting on the couch with their arms about each
other, the girl with the same expressionless smile upon her
face that she had vouchsafed him. He found he could so
arrange the hangings that a very narrow slit between two of
them permitted him to watch the actions of those in the alcove
without revealing himself or increasing his liability of detec-
tion.
<P>
He saw the girl lavishing her kisses upon the newcomer, a
much younger man than he whom Smith-Oldwick had dis-
patched. Presently the girl disengaged herself from the em-
brace of her lover as though struck by a sudden memory.
Her brows puckered as in labored thought and then with a
startled expression, she threw a glance backward toward the
hidden niche where the Englishman stood, after which she
whispered rapidly to her companion, occasionally jerking her
head in the direction of the niche and on several occasions
making a move with one hand and forefinger, which Smith-
Oldwick could not mistake as other than an attempt to de-
scribe his pistol and its use.
<P>
It was evident then to him that she was betraying him, and
without further loss of time he turned his back toward the
hangings and commenced a rapid examination of his hiding
place. In the alcove the man and the girl whispered, and
then cautiously and with great stealth, the man rose and drew
his curved saber. On tiptoe he approached the hangings, the
girl creeping at his side. Neither spoke now, nor was there
any sound in the room as the girl sprang forward and with
outstretched arm and pointing finger indicated a point upon
the curtain at the height of a man's breast. Then she stepped
to one side, and her companion, raising his blade to a hori-
zontal position, lunged suddenly forward and with the full
weight of his body and his right arm, drove the sharp point
through the hangings and into the niche behind for its full
length.
<P>
Bertha Kircher, finding her struggles futile and realizing
that she must conserve her strength for some chance oppor-
tunity of escape, desisted from her efforts to break from the
grasp of Prince Metak as the fellow fled with her through the
dimly lighted corridors of the palace. Through many cham-
bers the prince fled, bearing his prize. It was evident to the
girl that, though her captor was the king's son, he was not
above capture and punishment for his deeds, as otherwise he
would not have shown such evident anxiety to escape with
her, as well as from the results of his act.
<P>
From the fact that he was constantly turning affrighted
eyes behind them, and glancing suspiciously into every nook
and corner that they passed, she guessed that the prince's
punishment might be both speedy and terrible were he caught.
<P>
She knew from their route that they must have doubled
back several times although she had quite lost all sense of
direction; but she did not know that the prince was as equally
confused as she, and that really he was running in an aimless,
erratic manner, hoping that he might stumble eventually upon
a place of refuge.
<P>
Nor is it to be wondered at that this offspring of maniacs
should have difficulty in orienting himself in the winding
mazes of a palace designed by maniacs for a maniac king.
Now a corridor turned gradually and almost imperceptibly
in a new direction, again one doubled back upon and crossed
itself; here the floor rose gradually to the level of another
story,
or again there might be a spiral stairway down which the mad
prince rushed dizzily with his burden. Upon what floor they
were or in what part of the palace even Metak had no idea
until, halting abruptly at a closed door, he pushed it open to
step into a brilliantly lighted chamber filled with warriors, at
one end of which sat the king upon a great throne; beside this,
to the girl's surprise, she saw another throne where was seated
a huge lioness, recalling to her the words of Xanila which, at
the time, had made no impression on her: "But he had many
other queens, nor were they all human."
<P>
At sight of Metak and the girl, the king rose from his throne
and started across the chamber, all semblance of royalty
vanishing in the maniac's uncontrollable passion. And as he
came he shrieked orders and commands at the top of his voice.
No sooner had Metak so unwarily opened the door to this
hornets' nest than he immediately withdrew and, turning, fled
again in a new direction. But now a hundred men were close
upon his heels, laughing, shrieking, and possibly cursing. He
dodged hither and thither, distancing them for several minutes
until, at the bottom of a long runway that inclined steeply
downward from a higher level, he burst into a subterranean
apartment lighted by many flares.
<P>
In the center of the room was a pool of considerable size,
the level of the water being but a few inches below the floor.
Those behind the fleeing prince and his captive entered the
chamber in time to see Metak leap into the water with the
girl and disappear beneath the surface taking his captive with
him, nor, though they waited excitedly around the rim of the
pool, did either of the two again emerge.
<P>
When Smith-Oldwick turned to investigate his hiding place,
his hands, groping upon the rear wall, immediately came in
contact with the wooden panels of a door and a bolt such as
that which secured the door of the outer room. Cautiously
and silently drawing the wooden bar he pushed gently against
the panel to find that the door swung easily and noiselessly
outward into utter darkness. Moving carefully and feeling
forward for each step he passed out of the niche, closing the
door behind him.
<P>
Peeling about, he discovered that he was in a narrow cor-
ridor which he followed cautiously for a few yards to be
brought up suddenly by what appeared to be a ladder across
the passageway. He felt of the obstruction carefully with his
hands until he was assured that it was indeed a ladder and
that a solid wall was just beyond it, ending the corridor.
Therefore, as he could not go forward and as the ladder
ended at the floor upon which he stood, and as he did not care
to retrace his steps, there was no alternative but to climb up-
ward, and this he did, his pistol ready in a side pocket of his
blouse.
<P>
He had ascended but two or three rungs when his head
came suddenly and painfully in contact with a hard surface
above him. Groping about with one hand over his head he
discovered that the obstacle seemed to be the covering to a
trap door in the ceiling which, with a little effort, he
succeeded
in raising a couple of inches, revealing through the cracks
the stars of a clear African night.
<P>
With a sigh of relief, but with unabated caution, he gently
slid the trapdoor to one side far enough to permit him to raise
his eyes above the level of the roof. A quick glance assured
him that there was none near enough to observe his move-
ments, nor, in fact, as far as he could see, was anyone in
sight.
<P>
Drawing himself quickly through the aperture he replaced
the cover and endeavored to regain his bearings. Directly
to the south of him the low roof he stood upon adjoined a
much loftier portion of the building, which rose several stories
above his head. A few yards to the west he could see the
flickering light of the flares of a winding street, and toward
this he made his way.
<P>
From the edge of the roof he looked down upon the night
life of the mad city. He saw men and women and children
and lions, and of all that he saw it was quite evident to him
that only the lions were sane. With the aid of the stars he
easily picked out the points of the compass, and following
carefully in his memory the steps that had led him into the
city and to the roof upon which he now stood, he knew that
the thoroughfare upon which he looked was the same along
which he and Bertha Kircher had been led as prisoners earlier
in the day.
<P>
If he could reach this he might be able to pass undetected
in the shadows of the arcade to the city gate. He had already
given up as futile the thought of seeking out the girl and
attempting to succor her, for he knew that alone and with the
few remaining rounds of ammunition he possessed, he could
do nothing against this city-full of armed men. That he
could live to cross the lion-infested forest beyond the city was
doubtful, and having, by some miracle, won to the desert
beyond, his fate would be certainly sealed; but yet he was
consumed with but one desire -- to leave behind him as far
as possible this horrid city of maniacs.
<P>
He saw that the roofs rose to the same level as that upon
which he stood unbroken to the north to the next street inter-
section. Directly below him was a flare. To reach the pave-
ment in safety it was necessary that he find as dark a portion
of the avenue as possible. And so he sought along the edge
of the roofs for a place where he might descend in comparative
concealment.
<P>
He had proceeded some little way beyond a point where
the street curved abruptly to the east before he discovered a
location sufficiently to his liking. But even here he was com-
pelled to wait a considerable time for a satisfactory moment
for his descent, which he had decided to make down one of
the pillars of the arcade. Each time he prepared to lower
himself over the edge of the roofs, footsteps approaching in
one direction or another deterred him until at last he had
almost come to the conclusion that he would have to wait for
the entire city to sleep before continuing his flight.
<P>
But finally came a moment which he felt propitious and
though with inward qualms, it was with outward calm that he
commenced the descent to the street below.
<P>
When at last he stood beneath the arcade he was con-
gratulating himself upon the success that had attended his
efforts up to this point when, at a slight sound behind him,
he turned to see a tall figure in the yellow tunic of a warrior
confronting him.
