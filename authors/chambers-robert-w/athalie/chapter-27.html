<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>One day toward the end of August, Athalie, standing at the pier's
end, saw the huge incoming liner slowly warping to her berth;
waited amid the throngs in the vast sheds by the gangway, caught
a glimpse of Clive, lost him to view, then saw him again, very
near, making his way toward her. And then her hands were in his
and she was looking into his beloved eyes once more.</p>

<p>There were a few quick words of greeting spoken, tender, low-voiced;
the swift light of happiness made her blue eyes brilliant:</p>

<p>"You tall, sun-bronzed, lazy thing," she said; "I never told
you what a distinguished looking man you are, did I? Well I'll
spoil you by telling you now. No wonder everything feminine glances
at you," she added as he lifted his hat to fellow passengers who
were passing.</p>

<p>And during the customs' examination she stood beside him, amused,
interested, gently bantering him when he declared everything;
for even in Athalie were apparently the ineradicable seeds of
that original sin&mdash;which is in all femininity&mdash;the paramount necessity
for smuggling.</p>

<p>Once or twice he spoke aside to the customs' officer; and Athalie
instantly and gaily accused him of attempted bribery.</p>

<p>But when they were on their way to Spring Pond in a hired touring
car with his steamer trunk and suit-cases strapped behind, he
drew from his pockets the articles he had declared and paid for;
and Athalie grew silent in delight as she looked down at the single
and lovely strand of pearls.</p>

<p>All the way to Spring Pond she held them so, and her enchanted
eyes reverted to them whenever she could bring herself to look
anywhere except at him.</p>

<p>"I wondered," she said, "whether you would come to the country
or whether you might think it better to remain in town."</p>

<p>"I shall go back to town only when you go."</p>

<p>"Dear, does that mean that you will stay with me at our own house?"</p>

<p>"If you want me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive! I was wondering&mdash;only it seemed too heavenly to hope
for."</p>

<p>His face grew sombre for a moment. He said: "There is no other
future for us. And even our comradeship will be misunderstood.
But&mdash;if you are willing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is there any question in your mind as to the limit of my willingness?"</p>

<p>He said: "You know it will mark us for life. And if we remain
guiltless, and our lives blameless, nevertheless this comradeship
of ours will mark us for life."</p>

<p>"Do you mean, brand us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Does that cause you any real apprehension?" she laughed.</p>

<p>"I am thinking of you."</p>

<p>"Think of me, then," she said gaily, "and know that I am happy
and content. The world is turning into such a wonderful friend
to me; fate is becoming so gentle and so kind. Happiness may brand
me; nothing else can leave a mark. So be at ease concerning me.
All shall go well with me, only when with you, my darling, all
goes well."</p>

<p>He smiled in sympathy with her gaiety of heart, but the slight
shadow returned to his face again. Watching it she said:</p>

<p>"All things shall come to us, Clive."</p>

<p>"All things," he said, gravely,&mdash;"except fulfilment."</p>

<p>"That, too," she murmured.</p>

<p>"No, Athalie."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said under her breath.</p>

<p>He only lifted her ringless hand to his lips in hopeless silence;
but she looked up at the cloudless sky and out over sunlit harvest
fields and where grain and fruit were ripening, and she smiled,
closing her white hand and pressing it gently against his lips.</p>

<p>Connor met them at the door and shouldered Clive's trunk and
other luggage; then Athalie slipped her arm through his and took
him into the autumn glow of her garden.</p>

<p>"Miracle after miracle, Clive&mdash;from the enchantment of July roses
to the splendour of dahlia, calendula, and gladioluses. Such a
wonder-house no man ever before gave to any woman.... There is
not one stalk or leaf or blossom or blade of grass that is not
my intimate and tender friend, my confidant, my dear preceptor,
my companion beloved and adored.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "And then her hands were in his and she was looking
into his beloved eyes once more."]</p>

<p>"Do you notice that the grapes on the trellis are turning dark?
And the peaches are becoming so big and heavy and rosy. They will
be ripe before very long."</p>

<p>"You must have a greenhouse," he said.</p>

<p>"<em>We</em> must," she admitted demurely.</p>

<p>He turned toward her with much of his old gaiety, laughing: "Do
you know," he said, "I believe you are pretending to be in love
with me!"</p>

<p>"That's all it is, Clive, just pretence, and the natural depravity
of a flirt. When I go back to town I'll forget you ever existed&mdash;unless
you go with me."</p>

<p>"I'm wondering," he said, "what we had better do in town."</p>

<p>"I'm not wondering; I know."</p>

<p>He looked at her questioningly. Then she told him about her visit
to Michael and the apartment.</p>

<p>"There is no other place in the world that I care to live in&mdash;excepting
this," she said. "Couldn't we live there, Clive, when we go to
town?"</p>

<p>After a moment he said: "Yes."</p>

<p>"Would you care to?" she asked wistfully. Then smiled as she
met his eyes.</p>

<p>"So I shall give up business," she said, "and that tower apartment.
There's a letter here now asking if I desire to sublet it; and
as I had to renew my lease last June, that is what I shall do&mdash;if
you'll let me live in the place you made for me so long ago."</p>

<p>He answered, smilingly, that he might be induced to permit it.</p>

<p>Hafiz appeared, inquisitive, urbane, waving his snowy tail; but
he was shy of further demonstrations toward the man who was seated
beside his beloved mistress, and he pretended that he saw something
in the obscurity of the flowering thickets, and stalked it with
every symptom of sincerity.</p>

<p>"That cat must be about six years old," said Clive, watching
him.</p>

<p>"He plays like a kitten, still."</p>

<p>"Do you remember how he used to pat your thread with his paws
when you were sewing."</p>

<p>"I remember," she said, smiling.</p>

<p>A little later Hafiz regained confidence in Clive and came up
to rub against his legs and permit caresses.</p>

<p>"Such a united family," remarked Athalie, amused by the mutual
demonstrations.</p>

<p>"How is Henry?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Fatter and slower than ever, dear. He suits my unenterprising
disposition to perfection. Now and then he condescends to be harnessed
and to carry me about the landscape. But mostly he drags the cruel
burden of Connor's lawn-mower. Do you think the place looks well
kept?"</p>

<p>"I knew you wanted to be flattered," he laughed.</p>

<p>"I do. Flatter me please."</p>

<p>"It's one of the best things I do, Athalie! For example&mdash;the
lawn, the cat, and the girl are all beautifully groomed; the credit
is yours; and you're a celestial dream too exquisite to be real."</p>

<p>"I am becoming real&mdash;as real as you are," she said with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted, "you and I are the only real things in the
world after all. The rest&mdash;woven scenes that come and go moving
across a loom."</p>

<p>She quoted:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Sun and Moon illume the Room<br/>
&nbsp;Where the ceiling is the sky:<br/>
&nbsp;Night and day the Weavers ply<br/>
&nbsp;Colour, shadow, hue, and dye,<br/>
&nbsp;Where the rushing shuttles fly,<br/>
&nbsp;Weaving dreams across the Loom,<br/>
&nbsp;Picturing a common doom!

</p>
<p>
"How, Beloved, can <em>we</em> die&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;We Immortals, Thou and I?"

</p>
</div>
<p>He smiled: "Death seems very far away," he said.</p>

<p>"Nothing dies.... If only this world could understand.... Did
I tell you that mother has been with me often while you were away?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It was wonderfully sweet to see her in the room. One night I
fell asleep across her knees."</p>

<p>"Does she ever speak to you, Athalie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sometimes we talk."</p>

<p>"At night?"</p>

<p>"By day, too.... I was sitting in the living-room the other morning,
and she came up behind me and took both my hands. We talked, I
lying back in the rocking chair and looking up at her.... Mrs.
Connor came in. I am quite sure she was frightened when she heard
my voice in there conversing with nobody she could see."</p>

<p>Athalie smiled to herself as at some amusing memory evoked.</p>

<p>"If Mrs. Connor ever knew how she is followed about by so many
purring pussies and little wagging dogs &mdash;I mean dogs and
pussies who are no longer what we call 'alive,' &mdash;I don't
know what she'd think. Sometimes the place is full of them, Clive&mdash;such
darling little creatures. Hafiz sees them; and watches and watches,
but never moves."</p>

<p>Clive was staring a trifle hard; Athalie, lazily stretching her
arms, glanced at him with that humorous expression which hinted
of gentlest mockery.</p>

<p>"Don't worry; nothing follows you, Clive, except an idle girl
who finds no time for anything else, so busy are her thoughts
with you."</p>

<p>He bent forward and kissed her; and she clasped both hands behind
his head, drawing it nearer.</p>

<p>"Have you missed me, Athalie?"</p>

<p>"You could never understand how much."</p>

<p>"Did you find me in your crystal?"</p>

<p>"No; I saw only the sea and on the horizon a stain of smoke,
and a gull flying."</p>

<p>He drew her closely into his arms: "God," he breathed, "if anything
ever should happen to you!&mdash;and <em>I&mdash;</em>alone on earth&mdash;and
blind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. That is the only anxiety I ever knew ... because you are
blind."</p>

<p>"If you came to me I could not see you. If you spoke to me I
could not hear. Could anything more awful happen?"</p>

<p>"Do you care for me so much?"</p>

<p>In his eyes she read her answer, and thrilled to it, closer in
his arms; and rested so, her cheek against his, gazing at the
sunset out of dreamy eyes.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</div>
<p>They had been slowly pacing the garden paths, arm within arm,
when Mrs. Connor came to summon them to dinner. The small dining-room
was flooded with sunset light; rosy bars of it lay across cloth
and fruit and flowers, and striped the wall and ceiling.</p>

<p>And when dinner was ended the pale fire still burned on the thin
silk curtains and struck across the garden, gilding the coping
of the wall where clustering peaches hung all turned to gold like
fabled fruit that ripens in Hesperides.</p>

<p>Hafiz followed them out under the evening sky and seated himself
upon the grass. And he seemed mildly to enjoy the robins' evening
carolling, blinking benevolently up at the little vesper choristers,
high singing in the sunset's lingering glow.</p>

<p>Whenever light puffs of wind set blossoms swaying, the jet from
the fountain basin swerved, and a mellow raining sound of drops
swept the still pool. The lilac twilight deepened to mauve; upon
the surface of the pool a primrose tint grew duller. Then the
first bat zig-zagged across the sky; and every clove-pink border
became misty with the wings of dusk-moths.</p>

<p>On Athalie's frail white gown one alighted,&mdash;a little grey thing
wearing a pair of peacock-tinted diamonds on its forewings; and
as it sat there, quivering, the iridescent incrustations changed
from burnished gold to green.</p>

<p>"Wonders, wonders, under the moon," murmured the girl&mdash;"thronging
miracles that fill the day and night, always, everywhere. And
so few to see them.... Sometimes, to me the blindness of the world
to all the loveliness that I 'see clearly' is like my own blindness
to the hidden wonders of the night&mdash;where uncounted myriads of
little rainbow spirits fly. And nobody sees and knows the living
splendour of them except when some grey-winged phantom strays
indoors from the outer shadows. And it astonishes us to see, under
the drab forewings, a blaze of scarlet, gold, or orange."</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, "that the unseen night world all around
us is no more wonderful than what, in the day-world, the vast
majority of us never see, never suspect."</p>

<p>"I think it must be so, Clive. Being accustomed to a more densely
populated world than are many people, I believe that if I could
see only what they see,&mdash;merely that small portion of activity
and life which the world calls 'living things,' I should find
the sunlit world rather empty, and the night but a silent desolation
under the stars."</p>

<p>After a few minutes' thought he asked in a low voice whether
at that moment there was anybody in the garden except themselves.</p>

<p>"Some people were here a little while ago, looking at the flowers.
I think they must have lived here many, many years ago; perhaps
when this old house was new."</p>

<p>"Could you not ask them who they were?"</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"If they were what you would call 'alive' I could not intrude
upon them, could I? The laws of reticence, the respect for privacy,
remain the same. I am conscious of no more impertinent curiosity
concerning them than I am concerning any passer in the city streets."</p>

<p>"Have they gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But all the evening I have been hearing children at play
just beyond the garden wall.... And, when I was a child, somebody
killed a little dog down by the causeway. He is here in the garden,
now, trotting gaily about the lawn&mdash;such a happy little dog!&mdash;and
Hafiz has folded his forepaws under his ruff and has settled down
to watch him. Don't you see how Hafiz watches, how his head turns
following every movement of the little visitor?"</p>

<p>He nodded; then: "Do you still hear the children outside the
wall?"</p>

<p>She sat listening, the smile brooding in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Can you still hear them?" he repeated, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"What are they saying?"</p>

<p>"I can't make out. They are having a happy time somewhere on
the outer lawns."</p>

<p>"How many are there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. Their voices make a sweet, confused sound
like bird music before dawn. I couldn't even guess how many children
are playing there."</p>

<p>"Are any among them those children you once saw here?&mdash;the children
who pleaded with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not answer. He tightened his arm around her waist, drawing
her nearer; and she laid her cheek against his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "they are there."</p>

<p>"You know their voices?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dearest."</p>

<p>"Will they come again into the garden?"</p>

<p>Her face flushed deeply:</p>

<p>"Not unless we call them."</p>

<p>"Call them," he said. And, after a silence: "Dearest, will you
not call them to us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive! I have been calling. Now it remains with you."</p>

<p>"I did not hear you call them."</p>

<p>"<em>They</em> heard."</p>

<p>"Will they come?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>think so."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Very soon&mdash;if you truly desire them," she whispered against
his shoulder.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>Somewhere within the house the hour struck. After a long while
they rose, moving slowly, her head still lying on his shoulder.
Hafiz watched them until the door closed, then settled down again
to gaze on things invisible to men.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>Hours of the night in dim processional passed the old house unlighted
save by the stars. Toward dawn a sea-wind stirred the trees; the
fountain jet rained on the surface of the pool or, caught by a
sudden breeze, drifted in whispering spray across the grass. Everywhere
the darkness grew murmurous with sounds, vague as wind-blown voices;
sweet as the call of children from some hill-top where the stars
are very near, and the new moon's sickle flashes through the grass.</p>

<p>Athalie stirred where she lay, turned her head sideways with
infinite precaution, and lay listening.</p>

<p>Through the open window beside her she saw a dark sky set with
stars; heard the sea-wind in the leaves and the falling water
of the fountain. And very far away a sweet confused murmuring
grew upon her ears.</p>

<p>Silently her soul answered the far hail; her heart, responding,
echoed a voiceless welcome till she became fearful lest it beat
too loudly.</p>

<p>Then, with infinite precaution, noiselessly, and scarcely stirring,
she turned and laid her lips again where they had rested all night
long and, lying so, dreamed of miracles ineffable.</p>
