<p>The Shawanoe Indian known as Arqu-wao, or Red Crow, had come
in sight of the ravine, which was the scene of Blazing Arrow's
mishap the preceding day, when he halted with the abruptness described,
for he had caught sight of the three Indians, with his detested
brother at their head.</p>

<p>They were walking rapidly, and when Red Crow stopped they soon
passed beyond his sight again. Looking for them to halt, and half
expecting them to turn back at any moment, he signalled the youths
to hide themselves, while he advanced in the cautious manner known
to the reader.</p>

<p>Sure enough, he had gone but a little way when he observed the
three Indians standing in a group and discussing some question
with great earnestness. Quite sure that it had something to do
with the action of the couple who had passed that way a short
time before, he stealthily watched them.</p>

<p>The truth was, Blazing Arrow, probably suspecting the identity
of the couple, was giving his attention to them. They were sure
to run into danger if they kept on to the falls, but they might
escape unless he took a hand in the business.</p>

<p>Almost on the edge of the clearing, in sight of the ravine, the
hoofprints showed that the horses had turned off from the trail,
and with the evident intention of coming back to it at some point
farther on. The result of the conference was that Blazing Arrow
and one of his warriors continued in the direction of the natural
clearing, while the third was sent to track the horses through
the rough wood, and to signal the results to the leader.</p>

<p>Red Crow cautiously followed the single warrior to learn how
he made out. No doubt the latter would have done well had he not
run against an unexpected obstruction in the person of Simon Kenton,
who, having accompanied Mr. Edwards and his wife a part of the
way, turned back with the intention of acting as a rear guard.</p>

<p>The meeting was as much of a surprise to the white man as to
the red man, but, as has been intimated by the famous scout himself,
he was just too quick for the Shawanoe. With characteristic bravery,
Kenton leaped behind a tree, reloaded his rifle, and coolly awaited
the attack of Blazing Arrow and his companion; but they proved
their cowardice by slinking off toward the clearing, across which
they made their way, in the hope of gaining a better chance at
the couple, who could not be far off.</p>

<p>Red Crow now kept well out of sight of Kenton, as well as of
his brother, not stirring from his hiding-place until the way
was clear. Then he stole along the tracks made by the horses.
These were so clearly defined that a child would have had no difficulty
in following them.</p>

<p>He knew that the couple were the parents of the young men whom
he had set out to serve. The course of the great white hunter
made it clear that he would soon join the youths, while the route
of Blazing Arrow showed that they were in no present danger from
him. Accordingly, without taking the trouble of telling the boys
his intention, he hurried over the broken ground, anxious to meet
the man and wife before they penetrated too far.</p>

<p>Red Crow had formed a plan the moment he fully understood what
was going on, and he knew the need of haste.</p>

<p>Despite the almost marvellous cleverness he had displayed from
the beginning, he narrowly escaped making a fatal error. In his
eagerness to reach the couple he forgot that he was in war paint
and resembled in every respect, except one, the Shawanoe whom
the settler was trying to circumvent.</p>

<p>It was that one point of difference which saved Red Crow's life.
Brigham Edwards was picking his way as best he could, when he
caught sight of one of the Shawanoes hurrying along the trail
as though intent on overtaking him at the earliest moment.</p>

<p>Before the Indian knew his danger the vigilant settler had his
unerring rifle at his shoulder, and his keen eye was running along
the barrel. But he noticed that the Indian carried a bow and arrow
instead of a gun. This was so unusual that he hesitated. At the
moment of doing so Red Crow stopped short and looked up with a
startled look, as though recalling his forgetfulness. Despite
his paint, Edwards recognized him as Arqu-wao, whom he had often
seen when he was actively engaged in scouting along the frontier.</p>

<p>The pioneer had stopped both horses, and he and his wife were
on foot when this little episode took place.</p>

<p>"By George!" he exclaimed to his companion, "I came within a
hair of killing that poor crazy fool, Red Crow."</p>

<p>"What can be his business with us unless it be unfriendly?" asked
the wife, who also held a weapon in her hands. "He may have been
sent forward by some of the others."</p>

<p>"I don't think we have anything to fear from him. I never heard
that he harmed those who did not interfere with him. I will see
what he wants with us."</p>

<p>As Red Crow approached, Mr. Edwards addressed him by name and
repeated his own, but the Shawanoe showed no signs of recognizing
it.</p>

<p>"Why did you come here?" asked the white man, sternly.</p>

<p>"Shaw'noe dere and dere and dere," replied Red Crow, pointing
toward every point except that of the block-house; "if go on path,
Shaw'noe kill white man&mdash;kill white woman."</p>

<p>"Do you want to help us?"</p>

<p>"Me show way &mdash;Shaw'noe not see&mdash;not find."</p>

<p>This promise was received with a good deal of skepticism, but
the feelings of the parents were greatly stirred by the next words
that were quickly uttered:</p>

<p>"White boy Wart'n&mdash;white boy Larr&mdash;dey come with Arqu-wao."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the father, recognizing the names, and striding
in front of the Indian; "do you know anything about those two
boys?"</p>

<p>Red Crow nodded his head several times.</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Up dere," he replied, pointing in the direction of the point
in the trail where he had left them but a short time before.</p>

<p>"What can this mean?" demanded the agitated parent. "I must investigate
it. We will leave the horses here while we go back with him."</p>

<p>The mother was as anxious to meet her son and Larry, and they
quickly made ready to start.</p>
