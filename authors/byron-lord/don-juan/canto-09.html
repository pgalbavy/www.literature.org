O, Wellington! (or 'Villainton'&mdash;for Fame<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds the heroic syllables both ways;<br/>
France could not even conquer your great name,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But punn'd it down to this facetious phrase&mdash;<br/>
Beating or beaten she will laugh the same),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have obtain'd great pensions and much praise:<br/>
Glory like yours should any dare gainsay,<br/>
Humanity would rise, and thunder 'Nay!'

</p>
<p>
I don't think that you used Kinnaird quite well<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Marinet's affair&mdash;in fact, 't was shabby,<br/>
And like some other things won't do to tell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon your tomb in Westminster's old abbey.<br/>
Upon the rest 't is not worth while to dwell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such tales being for the tea-hours of some tabby;<br/>
But though your years as man tend fast to zero,<br/>
In fact your grace is still but a young hero.

</p>
<p>
Though Britain owes (and pays you too) so much,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet Europe doubtless owes you greatly more:<br/>
You have repair'd Legitimacy's crutch,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A prop not quite so certain as before:<br/>
The Spanish, and the French, as well as Dutch,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have seen, and felt, how strongly you restore;<br/>
And Waterloo has made the world your debtor<br/>
(I wish your bards would sing it rather better).

</p>
<p>
You are 'the best of cut-throats:'&mdash;do not start;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase is Shakspeare's, and not misapplied:<br/>
War 's a brain-spattering, windpipe-slitting art,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless her cause by right be sanctified.<br/>
If you have acted once a generous part,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world, not the world's masters, will decide,<br/>
And I shall be delighted to learn who,<br/>
Save you and yours, have gain'd by Waterloo?

</p>
<p>
I am no flatterer&mdash;you 've supp'd full of flattery:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They say you like it too&mdash;'t is no great wonder.<br/>
He whose whole life has been assault and battery,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At last may get a little tired of thunder;<br/>
And swallowing eulogy much more than satire, he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May like being praised for every lucky blunder,<br/>
Call'd 'Saviour of the Nations'&mdash;not yet saved,<br/>
And 'Europe's Liberator'&mdash;still enslaved.

</p>
<p>
I 've done. Now go and dine from off the plate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Presented by the Prince of the Brazils,<br/>
And send the sentinel before your gate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A slice or two from your luxurious meals:<br/>
He fought, but has not fed so well of late.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some hunger, too, they say the people feels:&mdash;<br/>
There is no doubt that you deserve your ration,<br/>
But pray give back a little to the nation.

</p>
<p>
I don't mean to reflect&mdash;a man so great as<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You, my lord duke! is far above reflection:<br/>
The high Roman fashion, too, of Cincinnatus,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With modern history has but small connection:<br/>
Though as an Irishman you love potatoes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You need not take them under your direction;<br/>
And half a million for your Sabine farm<br/>
Is rather dear!<br/>
&mdash;I 'm sure I mean no harm.

</p>
<p>
Great men have always scorn'd great recompenses:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Epaminondas saved his Thebes, and died,<br/>
Not leaving even his funeral expenses:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;George Washington had thanks and nought beside,<br/>
Except the all-cloudless glory which few men's is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To free his country: Pitt too had his pride,<br/>
And as a high-soul'd minister of state is<br/>
Renown'd for ruining Great Britain gratis.

</p>
<p>
Never had mortal man such opportunity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Except Napoleon, or abused it more:<br/>
You might have freed fallen Europe from the unity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tyrants, and been blest from shore to shore:<br/>
And now&mdash;what is your fame? Shall the Muse tune it ye?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now&mdash;that the rabble's first vain shouts are o'er?<br/>
Go! hear it in your famish'd country's cries!<br/>
Behold the world! and curse your victories!

</p>
<p>
As these new cantos touch on warlike feats,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To you the unflattering Muse deigns to inscribe<br/>
Truths, that you will not read in the Gazettes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But which 't is time to teach the hireling tribe<br/>
Who fatten on their country's gore, and debts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Must be recited, and&mdash;without a bribe.<br/>
You did great things; but not being great in mind,<br/>
Have left undone the greatest&mdash;and mankind.

</p>
<p>
Death laughs<br/>
&mdash;Go ponder o'er the skeleton<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With which men image out the unknown thing<br/>
That hides the past world, like to a set sun<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which still elsewhere may rouse a brighter spring&mdash;<br/>
Death laughs at all you weep for:&mdash;look upon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This hourly dread of all! whose threaten'd sting<br/>
Turns life to terror, even though in its sheath:<br/>
Mark how its lipless mouth grins without breath!

</p>
<p>
Mark how it laughs and scorns at all you are!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet was what you are: from ear to ear<br/>
It laughs not&mdash;there is now no fleshy bar<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So call'd; the Antic long hath ceased to hear,<br/>
But still he smiles; and whether near or far,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He strips from man that mantle (far more dear<br/>
Than even the tailor's), his incarnate skin,<br/>
White, black, or copper&mdash;the dead bones will grin.

</p>
<p>
And thus Death laughs,&mdash;it is sad merriment,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But still it is so; and with such example<br/>
Why should not Life be equally content<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his superior, in a smile to trample<br/>
Upon the nothings which are daily spent<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like bubbles on an ocean much less ample<br/>
Than the eternal deluge, which devours<br/>
Suns as rays&mdash;worlds like atoms&mdash;years like hours?

</p>
<p>
'To be, or not to be? that is the question,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Says Shakspeare, who just now is much in fashion.<br/>
I am neither Alexander nor Hephaestion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor ever had for abstract fame much passion;<br/>
But would much rather have a sound digestion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Buonaparte's cancer: could I dash on<br/>
Through fifty victories to shame or fame&mdash;<br/>
Without a stomach what were a good name?

</p>
<p>
'O dura ilia messorum!'&mdash;'Oh<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye rigid guts of reapers!' I translate<br/>
For the great benefit of those who know<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What indigestion is&mdash;that inward fate<br/>
Which makes all Styx through one small liver flow.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A peasant's sweat is worth his lord's estate:<br/>
Let this one toil for bread&mdash;that rack for rent,<br/>
He who sleeps best may be the most content.

</p>
<p>
'To be, or not to be?'<br/>
&mdash;Ere I decide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be glad to know that which is being?<br/>
'T is true we speculate both far and wide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And deem, because we see, we are all-seeing:<br/>
For my part, I 'll enlist on neither side,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until I see both sides for once agreeing.<br/>
For me, I sometimes think that life is death,<br/>
Rather than life a mere affair of breath.

</p>
<p>
'Que scais-je?' was the motto of Montaigne,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As also of the first academicians:<br/>
That all is dubious which man may attain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was one of their most favourite positions.<br/>
There 's no such thing as certainty, that 's plain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As any of Mortality's conditions;<br/>
So little do we know what we 're about in<br/>
This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.

</p>
<p>
It is a pleasant voyage perhaps to float,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Pyrrho, on a sea of speculation;<br/>
But what if carrying sail capsize the boat?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your wise men don't know much of navigation;<br/>
And swimming long in the abyss of thought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is apt to tire: a calm and shallow station<br/>
Well nigh the shore, where one stoops down and gathers<br/>
Some pretty shell, is best for moderate bathers.

</p>
<p>
'But heaven,' as Cassio says, 'is above all&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No more of this, then,&mdash;let us pray!' We have<br/>
Souls to save, since Eve's slip and Adam's fall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which tumbled all mankind into the grave,<br/>
Besides fish, beasts, and birds. 'The sparrow's fall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is special providence,' though how it gave<br/>
Offence, we know not; probably it perch'd<br/>
Upon the tree which Eve so fondly search'd.

</p>
<p>
O, ye immortal gods! what is theogony?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O, thou too, mortal man! what is philanthropy?<br/>
O, world! which was and is, what is cosmogony?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have accused me of misanthropy;<br/>
And yet I know no more than the mahogany<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That forms this desk, of what they mean; lykanthropy<br/>
I comprehend, for without transformation<br/>
Men become wolves on any slight occasion.

</p>
<p>
But I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Moses, or Melancthon, who have ne'er<br/>
Done anything exceedingly unkind,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And (though I could not now and then forbear<br/>
Following the bent of body or of mind)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have always had a tendency to spare,&mdash;<br/>
Why do they call me misanthrope? Because<br/>
They hate me, not I them.&mdash;and here we 'll pause.

</p>
<p>
'T is time we should proceed with our good poem,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I maintain that it is really good,<br/>
Not only in the body but the proem,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However little both are understood<br/>
Just now,&mdash;but by and by the Truth will show 'em<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Herself in her sublimest attitude:<br/>
And till she doth, I fain must be content<br/>
To share her beauty and her banishment.

</p>
<p>
Our hero (and, I trust, kind reader, yours)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was left upon his way to the chief city<br/>
Of the immortal Peter's polish'd boors<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who still have shown themselves more brave than witty.<br/>
I know its mighty empire now allures<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Much flattery&mdash;even Voltaire's, and that 's a pity.<br/>
For me, I deem an absolute autocrat<br/>
Not a barbarian, but much worse than that.

</p>
<p>
And I will war, at least in words (and&mdash;should<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My chance so happen&mdash;deeds), with all who war<br/>
With Thought;&mdash;and of Thought's foes by far most rude,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyrants and sycophants have been and are.<br/>
I know not who may conquer: if I could<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have such a prescience, it should be no bar<br/>
To this my plain, sworn, downright detestation<br/>
Of every depotism in every nation.

</p>
<p>
It is not that I adulate the people:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without me, there are demagogues enough,<br/>
And infidels, to pull down every steeple,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And set up in their stead some proper stuff.<br/>
Whether they may sow scepticism to reap hell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As is the Christian dogma rather rough,<br/>
I do not know;<br/>
&mdash;I wish men to be free<br/>
As much from mobs as kings&mdash;from you as me.

</p>
<p>
The consequence is, being of no party,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall offend all parties: never mind!<br/>
My words, at least, are more sincere and hearty<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than if I sought to sail before the wind.<br/>
He who has nought to gain can have small art: he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who neither wishes to be bound nor bind,<br/>
May still expatiate freely, as will I,<br/>
Nor give my voice to slavery's jackal cry.

</p>
<p>
That 's an appropriate simile, that jackal;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I 've heard them in the Ephesian ruins howl<br/>
By night, as do that mercenary pack all,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Power's base purveyors, who for pickings prowl,<br/>
And scent the prey their masters would attack all.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the poor jackals are less foul<br/>
(As being the brave lions' keen providers)<br/>
Than human insects, catering for spiders.

</p>
<p>
Raise but an arm! 't will brush their web away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And without that, their poison and their claws<br/>
Are useless. Mind, good people! what I say<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Or rather peoples)&mdash;go on without pause!<br/>
The web of these tarantulas each day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Increases, till you shall make common cause:<br/>
None, save the Spanish fly and Attic bee,<br/>
As yet are strongly stinging to be free.

</p>
<p>
Don Juan, who had shone in the late slaughter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was left upon his way with the despatch,<br/>
Where blood was talk'd of as we would of water;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And carcasses that lay as thick as thatch<br/>
O'er silenced cities, merely served to flatter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Catherine's pastime&mdash;who look'd on the match<br/>
Between these nations as a main of cocks,<br/>
Wherein she liked her own to stand like rocks.

</p>
<p>
And there in a kibitka he roll'd on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(A cursed sort of carriage without springs,<br/>
Which on rough roads leaves scarcely a whole bone),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pondering on glory, chivalry, and kings,<br/>
And orders, and on all that he had done&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wishing that post-horses had the wings<br/>
Of Pegasus, or at the least post-chaises<br/>
Had feathers, when a traveller on deep ways is.

</p>
<p>
At every jolt&mdash;and they were many&mdash;still<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He turn'd his eyes upon his little charge,<br/>
As if he wish'd that she should fare less ill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than he, in these sad highways left at large<br/>
To ruts, and flints, and lovely Nature's skill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is no paviour, nor admits a barge<br/>
On her canals, where God takes sea and land,<br/>
Fishery and farm, both into his own hand.

</p>
<p>
At least he pays no rent, and has best right<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be the first of what we used to call<br/>
'Gentlemen farmer'&mdash;a race worn out quite,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since lately there have been no rents at all,<br/>
And 'gentlemen' are in a piteous plight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'farmers' can't raise Ceres from her fall:<br/>
She fell with Buonaparte<br/>
&mdash;What strange thoughts<br/>
Arise, when we see emperors fall with oats!

</p>
<p>
But Juan turn'd his eyes on the sweet child<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom he had saved from slaughter&mdash;what a trophy<br/>
O! ye who build up monuments, defiled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With gore, like Nadir Shah, that costive sophy,<br/>
Who, after leaving Hindostan a wild,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And scarce to the Mogul a cup of coffee<br/>
To soothe his woes withal, was slain, the sinner!<br/>
Because he could no more digest his dinner;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
O ye! or we! or he! or she! reflect,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That one life saved, especially if young<br/>
Or pretty, is a thing to recollect<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Far sweeter than the greenest laurels sprung<br/>
From the manure of human clay, though deck'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the praises ever said or sung:<br/>
Though hymn'd by every harp, unless within<br/>
Your heart joins chorus, Fame is but a din.

</p>
<p>
O! ye great authors luminous, voluminous!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye twice ten hundred thousand daily scribes!<br/>
Whose pamphlets, volumes, newspapers, illumine us!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you 're paid by government in bribes,<br/>
To prove the public debt is not consuming us&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, roughly treading on the 'courtier's kibes'<br/>
With clownish heel, your popular circulation<br/>
Feeds you by printing half the realm's starvation;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
O, ye great authors!&mdash;'Apropos des bottes,'-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have forgotten what I meant to say,<br/>
As sometimes have been greater sages' lots;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was something calculated to allay<br/>
All wrath in barracks, palaces, or cots:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Certes it would have been but thrown away,<br/>
And that 's one comfort for my lost advice,<br/>
Although no doubt it was beyond all price.

</p>
<p>
But let it go:&mdash;it will one day be found<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With other relics of 'a former world,'<br/>
When this world shall be former, underground,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrown topsy-turvy, twisted, crisp'd, and curl'd,<br/>
Baked, fried, or burnt, turn'd inside-out, or drown'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all the worlds before, which have been hurl'd<br/>
First out of, and then back again to chaos,<br/>
The superstratum which will overlay us.

</p>
<p>
So Cuvier says;&mdash;and then shall come again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the new creation, rising out<br/>
From our old crash, some mystic, ancient strain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of things destroy'd and left in airy doubt:<br/>
Like to the notions we now entertain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Titans, giants, fellows of about<br/>
Some hundred feet in height, not to say miles,<br/>
And mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.

</p>
<p>
Think if then George the Fourth should be dug up!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How the new worldlings of the then new East<br/>
Will wonder where such animals could sup!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(For they themselves will be but of the least:<br/>
Even worlds miscarry, when too oft they pup,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And every new creation hath decreased<br/>
In size, from overworking the material&mdash;<br/>
Men are but maggots of some huge Earth's burial.)

</p>
<p>
How will&mdash;to these young people, just thrust out<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From some fresh Paradise, and set to plough,<br/>
And dig, and sweat, and turn themselves about,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And plant, and reap, and spin, and grind, and sow,<br/>
Till all the arts at length are brought about,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially of war and taxing,&mdash;how,<br/>
I say, will these great relics, when they see 'em,<br/>
Look like the monsters of a new museum?

</p>
<p>
But I am apt to grow too metaphysical:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'The time is out of joint,'&mdash;and so am I;<br/>
I quite forget this poem 's merely quizzical,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And deviate into matters rather dry.<br/>
I ne'er decide what I shall say, and this I cal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Much too poetical: men should know why<br/>
They write, and for what end; but, note or text,<br/>
I never know the word which will come next.

</p>
<p>
So on I ramble, now and then narrating,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now pondering:&mdash;it is time we should narrate.<br/>
I left Don Juan with his horses baiting&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we 'll get o'er the ground at a great rate.<br/>
I shall not be particular in stating<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His journey, we 've so many tours of late:<br/>
Suppose him then at Petersburgh; suppose<br/>
That pleasant capital of painted snows;

</p>
<p>
Suppose him in a handsome uniform,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A scarlet coat, black facings, a long plume,<br/>
Waving, like sails new shiver'd in a storm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a cock'd hat in a crowded room,<br/>
And brilliant breeches, bright as a Cairn Gorme,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of yellow casimere we may presume,<br/>
White stocking drawn uncurdled as new milk<br/>
O'er limbs whose symmetry set off the silk;

</p>
<p>
Suppose him sword by side, and hat in hand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made up by youth, fame, and an army tailor&mdash;<br/>
That great enchanter, at whose rod's command<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beauty springs forth, and Nature's self turns paler,<br/>
Seeing how Art can make her work more grand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(When she don't pin men's limbs in like a gaoler),&mdash;<br/>
Behold him placed as if upon a pillar! He<br/>
Seems Love turn'd a lieutenant of artillery:&mdash;

</p>
<p>
His bandage slipp'd down into a cravat;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His wings subdued to epaulettes; his quiver<br/>
Shrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever;<br/>
His bow converted into a cock'd hat;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But still so like, that Psyche were more clever<br/>
Than some wives (who make blunders no less stupid),<br/>
If she had not mistaken him for Cupid.

</p>
<p>
The courtiers stared, the ladies whisper'd, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The empress smiled: the reigning favourite frown'd&mdash;<br/>
I quite forget which of them was in hand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then; as they are rather numerous found,<br/>
Who took by turns that difficult command<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since first her majesty was singly crown'd:<br/>
But they were mostly nervous six-foot fellows,<br/>
All fit to make a Patagonian jealous.

</p>
<p>
Juan was none of these, but slight and slim,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blushing and beardless; and yet ne'ertheless<br/>
There was a something in his turn of limb,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And still more in his eye, which seem'd to express,<br/>
That though he look'd one of the seraphim,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There lurk'd a man beneath the spirit's dress.<br/>
Besides, the empress sometimes liked a boy,<br/>
And had just buried the fair-faced Lanskoi.

</p>
<p>
No wonder then that Yermoloff, or Momonoff,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Scherbatoff, or any other off<br/>
Or on, might dread her majesty had not room enough<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within her bosom (which was not too tough)<br/>
For a new flame; a thought to cast of gloom enough<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the aspect, whether smooth or rough,<br/>
Of him who, in the language of his station,<br/>
Then held that 'high official situation.'

</p>
<p>
O, gentle ladies! should you seek to know<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The import of this diplomatic phrase,<br/>
Bid Ireland's Londonderry's Marquess show<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His parts of speech; and in the strange displays<br/>
Of that odd string of words, all in a row,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which none divine, and every one obeys,<br/>
Perhaps you may pick out some queer no meaning,<br/>
Of that weak wordy harvest the sole gleaning.

</p>
<p>
I think I can explain myself without<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That sad inexplicable beast of prey&mdash;<br/>
That Sphinx, whose words would ever be a doubt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not his deeds unriddle them each day&mdash;<br/>
That monstrous hieroglyphic&mdash;that long spout<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of blood and water, leaden Castlereagh!<br/>
And here I must an anecdote relate,<br/>
But luckily of no great length or weight.

</p>
<p>
An English lady ask'd of an Italian,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What were the actual and official duties<br/>
Of the strange thing some women set a value on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which hovers oft about some married beauties,<br/>
Called 'Cavalier servente?'&mdash;a Pygmalion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose statues warm (I fear, alas! too true 't is)<br/>
Beneath his art. The dame, press'd to disclose them,<br/>
Said&mdash;'Lady, I beseech you to suppose them.'

</p>
<p>
And thus I supplicate your supposition,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mildest, matron-like interpretation,<br/>
Of the imperial favourite's condition.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was a high place, the highest in the nation<br/>
In fact, if not in rank; and the suspicion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of any one's attaining to his station,<br/>
No doubt gave pain, where each new pair of shoulders,<br/>
If rather broad, made stocks rise and their holders.

</p>
<p>
Juan, I said, was a most beauteous boy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And had retain'd his boyish look beyond<br/>
The usual hirsute seasons which destroy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With beards and whiskers, and the like, the fond<br/>
Parisian aspect which upset old Troy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And founded Doctors' Commons:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I have conn'd<br/>
The history of divorces, which, though chequer'd,<br/>
Calls Ilion's the first damages on record.

</p>
<p>
And Catherine, who loved all things (save her lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was gone to his place), and pass'd for much<br/>
Admiring those (by dainty dames abhorr'd)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gigantic gentlemen, yet had a touch<br/>
Of sentiment; and he she most adored<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the lamented Lanskoi, who was such<br/>
A lover as had cost her many a tear,<br/>
And yet but made a middling grenadier.

</p>
<p>
O thou 'teterrima causa' of all 'belli'-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou gate of life and death&mdash;thou nondescript!<br/>
Whence is our exit and our entrance,&mdash;well I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May pause in pondering how all souls are dipt<br/>
In thy perennial fountain:&mdash;how man fell I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Know not, since knowledge saw her branches stript<br/>
Of her first fruit; but how he falls and rises<br/>
Since, thou hast settled beyond all surmises.

</p>
<p>
Some call thee 'the worst cause of war,' but I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain thou art the best: for after all<br/>
From thee we come, to thee we go, and why<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To get at thee not batter down a wall,<br/>
Or waste a world? since no one can deny<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou dost replenish worlds both great and small:<br/>
With, or without thee, all things at a stand<br/>
Are, or would be, thou sea of life's dry land!

</p>
<p>
Catherine, who was the grand epitome<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that great cause of war, or peace, or what<br/>
You please (it causes all the things which be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So you may take your choice of this or that)&mdash;<br/>
Catherine, I say, was very glad to see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome herald, on whose plumage sat<br/>
Victory; and pausing as she saw him kneel<br/>
With his despatch, forgot to break the seal.

</p>
<p>
Then recollecting the whole empress, nor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;forgetting quite the woman (which composed<br/>
At least three parts of this great whole), she tore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter open with an air which posed<br/>
The court, that watch'd each look her visage wore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a royal smile at length disclosed<br/>
Fair weather for the day. Though rather spacious,<br/>
Her face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious.

</p>
<p>
Great joy was hers, or rather joys: the first<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a ta'en city, thirty thousand slain.<br/>
Glory and triumph o'er her aspect burst,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As an East Indian sunrise on the main.<br/>
These quench'd a moment her ambition's thirst&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So Arab deserts drink in summer's rain:<br/>
In vain!<br/>
&mdash;As fall the dews on quenchless sands,<br/>
Blood only serves to wash Ambition's hands!

</p>
<p>
Her next amusement was more fanciful;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled at mad Suwarrow's rhymes, who threw<br/>
Into a Russian couplet rather dull<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew.<br/>
Her third was feminine enough to annul<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The shudder which runs naturally through<br/>
Our veins, when things call'd sovereigns think it best<br/>
To kill, and generals turn it into jest.

</p>
<p>
The two first feelings ran their course complete,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lighted first her eye, and then her mouth:<br/>
The whole court look'd immediately most sweet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like flowers well water'd after a long drouth.<br/>
But when on the lieutenant at her feet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her majesty, who liked to gaze on youth<br/>
Almost as much as on a new despatch,<br/>
Glanced mildly, all the world was on the watch.

</p>
<p>
Though somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When wroth&mdash;while pleased, she was as fine a figure<br/>
As those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would wish to look on, while they are in vigour.<br/>
She could repay each amatory look you lent<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With interest, and in turn was wont with rigour<br/>
To exact of Cupid's bills the full amount<br/>
At sight, nor would permit you to discount.

</p>
<p>
With her the latter, though at times convenient,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not so necessary; for they tell<br/>
That she was handsome, and though fierce look'd lenient,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And always used her favourites too well.<br/>
If once beyond her boudoir's precincts in ye went,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your 'fortune' was in a fair way 'to swell<br/>
A man' (as Giles says); for though she would widow all<br/>
Nations, she liked man as an individual.

</p>
<p>
What a strange thing is man? and what a stranger<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is woman! What a whirlwind is her head,<br/>
And what a whirlpool full of depth and danger<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is all the rest about her! Whether wed<br/>
Or widow, maid or mother, she can change her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind like the wind: whatever she has said<br/>
Or done, is light to what she 'll say or do;&mdash;<br/>
The oldest thing on record, and yet new!

</p>
<p>
O Catherine! (for of all interjections,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To thee both oh! and ah! belong of right<br/>
In love and war) how odd are the connections<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!<br/>
Just now yours were cut out in different sections:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;First Ismail's capture caught your fancy quite;<br/>
Next of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch;<br/>
And thirdly he who brought you the despatch!

</p>
<p>
Shakspeare talks of 'the herald Mercury<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;'<br/>
And some such visions cross'd her majesty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While her young herald knelt before her still.<br/>
'T is very true the hill seem'd rather high,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For a lieutenant to climb up; but skill<br/>
Smooth'd even the Simplon's steep, and by God's blessing<br/>
With youth and health all kisses are 'heaven-kissing.'

</p>
<p>
Her majesty look'd down, the youth look'd up&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so they fell in love;&mdash;she with his face,<br/>
His grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid's cup<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first draught intoxicates apace,<br/>
A quintessential laudanum or 'black drop,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which makes one drunk at once, without the base<br/>
Expedient of full bumpers; for the eye<br/>
In love drinks all life's fountains (save tears) dry.

</p>
<p>
He, on the other hand, if not in love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell into that no less imperious passion,<br/>
Self-love&mdash;which, when some sort of thing above<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ourselves, a singer, dancer, much in fashion,<br/>
Or duchess, princess, empress, 'deigns to prove'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;('T is Pope's phrase) a great longing, though a rash one,<br/>
For one especial person out of many,<br/>
Makes us believe ourselves as good as any.

</p>
<p>
Besides, he was of that delighted age<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which makes all female ages equal&mdash;when<br/>
We don't much care with whom we may engage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As bold as Daniel in the lion's den,<br/>
So that we can our native sun assuage<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next ocean, which may flow just then,<br/>
To make a twilight in, just as Sol's heat is<br/>
Quench'd in the lap of the salt sea, or Thetis.

</p>
<p>
And Catherine (we must say thus much for Catherine),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though bold and bloody, was the kind of thing<br/>
Whose temporary passion was quite flattering,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because each lover look'd a sort of king,<br/>
Made up upon an amatory pattern,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A royal husband in all save the ring&mdash;<br/>
Which, being the damn'dest part of matrimony,<br/>
Seem'd taking out the sting to leave the honey.

</p>
<p>
And when you add to this, her womanhood<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In its meridian, her blue eyes or gray<br/>
(The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or better, as the best examples say:<br/>
Napoleon's, Mary's (queen of Scotland), should<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;<br/>
And Pallas also sanctions the same hue,<br/>
Too wise to look through optics black or blue)&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,<br/>
Her preference of a boy to men much bigger<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Fellows whom Messalina's self would pension),<br/>
Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With other extras, which we need not mention,&mdash;<br/>
All these, or any one of these, explain<br/>
Enough to make a stripling very vain.

</p>
<p>
And that 's enough, for love is vanity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Selfish in its beginning as its end,<br/>
Except where 't is a mere insanity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A maddening spirit which would strive to blend<br/>
Itself with beauty's frail inanity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On which the passion's self seems to depend:<br/>
And hence some heathenish philosophers<br/>
Make love the main spring of the universe.

</p>
<p>
Besides Platonic love, besides the love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of God, the love of sentiment, the loving<br/>
Of faithful pairs (I needs must rhyme with dove,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving<br/>
'Gainst reason<br/>
&mdash;Reason ne'er was hand-and-glove<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With rhyme, but always leant less to improving<br/>
The sound than sense)&mdash;beside all these pretences<br/>
To love, there are those things which words name senses;

</p>
<p>
Those movements, those improvements in our bodies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which make all bodies anxious to get out<br/>
Of their own sand-pits, to mix with a goddess,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For such all women are at first no doubt.<br/>
How beautiful that moment! and how odd is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That fever which precedes the languid rout<br/>
Of our sensations! What a curious way<br/>
The whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!

</p>
<p>
The noblest kind of love is love Platonical,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To end or to begin with; the next grand<br/>
Is that which may be christen'd love canonical,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the clergy take the thing in hand;<br/>
The third sort to be noted in our chronicle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As flourishing in every Christian land,<br/>
Is when chaste matrons to their other ties<br/>
Add what may be call'd marriage in disguise.

</p>
<p>
Well, we won't analyse&mdash;our story must<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell for itself: the sovereign was smitten,<br/>
Juan much flatter'd by her love, or lust;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot stop to alter words once written,<br/>
And the two are so mix'd with human dust,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he who names one, both perchance may hit on:<br/>
But in such matters Russia's mighty empress<br/>
Behaved no better than a common sempstress.

</p>
<p>
The whole court melted into one wide whisper,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all lips were applied unto all ears!<br/>
The elder ladies' wrinkles curl'd much crisper<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As they beheld; the younger cast some leers<br/>
On one another, and each lovely lisper<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiled as she talk'd the matter o'er; but tears<br/>
Of rivalship rose in each clouded eye<br/>
Of all the standing army who stood by.

</p>
<p>
All the ambassadors of all the powers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enquired, Who was this very new young man,<br/>
Who promised to be great in some few hours?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is full soon&mdash;though life is but a span.<br/>
Already they beheld the silver showers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,<br/>
Upon his cabinet, besides the presents<br/>
Of several ribands, and some thousand peasants.

</p>
<p>
Catherine was generous,&mdash;all such ladies are:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love, that great opener of the heart and all<br/>
The ways that lead there, be they near or far,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, below, by turnpikes great or small,&mdash;<br/>
Love (though she had a cursed taste for war,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And was not the best wife, unless we call<br/>
Such Clytemnestra, though perhaps 't is better<br/>
That one should die, than two drag on the fetter)&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Love had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike our own half-chaste Elizabeth,<br/>
Whose avarice all disbursements did importune,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If history, the grand liar, ever saith<br/>
The truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she put a favourite to death,<br/>
Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,<br/>
And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.

</p>
<p>
But when the levee rose, and all was bustle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dissolving circle, all the nations'<br/>
Ambassadors began as 't were to hustle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the young man with their congratulations.<br/>
Also the softer silks were heard to rustle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of gentle dames, among whose recreations<br/>
It is to speculate on handsome faces,<br/>
Especially when such lead to high places.

</p>
<p>
Juan, who found himself, he knew not how,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A general object of attention, made<br/>
His answers with a very graceful bow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if born for the ministerial trade.<br/>
Though modest, on his unembarrass'd brow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature had written 'gentleman.' He said<br/>
Little, but to the purpose; and his manner<br/>
Flung hovering graces o'er him like a banner.

</p>
<p>
An order from her majesty consign'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young lieutenant to the genial care<br/>
Of those in office: all the world look'd kind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(As it will look sometimes with the first stare,<br/>
Which youth would not act ill to keep in mind),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As also did Miss Protasoff then there,<br/>
Named from her mystic office 'l'Eprouveuse,'<br/>
A term inexplicable to the Muse.

</p>
<p>
With her then, as in humble duty bound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan retired,&mdash;and so will I, until<br/>
My Pegasus shall tire of touching ground.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We have just lit on a 'heaven-kissing hill,'<br/>
So lofty that I feel my brain turn round,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all my fancies whirling like a mill;<br/>
Which is a signal to my nerves and brain,<br/>
To take a quiet ride in some green Lane.
