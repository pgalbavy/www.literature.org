<p>  Who makes an enemy a friend,   To fear and worry puts an end.</p>

<p>Little Joe Otter found that out when he took Grandfather Frog's
advice. He wouldn't have admitted that he was afraid of Buster
Bear. No one ever likes to admit being afraid, least of all Little
Joe Otter. And really Little Joe has a great deal of courage.
Very few of the little people of the Green Forest or the Green
Meadows would willingly quarrel with him, for Little Joe is a
great fighter when he has to fight. As for all those who live
in or along the Laughing Brook or in the Smiling Pool, they let
Little Joe have his own way in everything.</p>

<p>Now having one's own way too much is a bad thing. It is apt to
make one selfish and thoughtless of other people and very hard
to get along with. Little Joe Otter had his way too much. Grandfather
Frog knew it and shook his head very soberly when Little Joe had
been disrespectful to him.</p>

<p>"Too bad. Too bad! Too bad! Chug-a-rum! It is too bad that such
a fine young fellow as Little Joe should spoil a good disposition
by such selfish heedlessness. Too bad," said he.</p>

<p>So, though he didn't let on that it was so, Grandfather Frog
really was delighted when he heard how Buster Bear had been too
smart for Little Joe Otter. It tickled him so that he had hard
work to keep a straight face. But he did and was as grave and
solemn as you please as he advised Little Joe always to make friends
with any one who was bigger and stronger and smarter than he.
That was good common sense advice, but Little Joe just sniffed
and went off declaring that he would get even with Buster Bear
yet. Now Little Joe is good-natured and full of fun as a rule,
and after he had reached home and his temper had cooled off a
little, he began to see the joke on himself,&mdash;how when he had
worked so hard to frighten the fish in the little pools of the
Laughing Brook so that Buster Bear should not catch any, he had
all the time been driving them right into Buster's paws. By and
by he grinned. It was a little sheepish grin at first, but at
last it grew into a laugh.</p>

<p>"I believe," said Little Joe as he wiped tears of laughter from
his eyes, "that Grandfather Frog is right, and that the best thing
I can do is to make friends with Buster Bear. I'll try it to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>So very early the next morning Little Joe Otter went to the best
fishing pool he knew of in the Laughing Brook, and there he caught
the biggest trout he could find. It was so big and fat that it
made Little Joe's mouth water, for you know fat trout are his
favorite food. But he didn't take so much as one bite. Instead
he carefully laid it on an old log where Buster Bear would be
sure to see it if he should come along that way. Then he hid near
by, where he could watch. Buster was late that morning. It seemed
to Little Joe that he never would come. Once he nearly lost the
fish. He had turned his head for just a minute, and when he looked
back again, the trout was nowhere to be seen. Buster couldn't
have stolen up and taken it, because such a big fellow couldn't
possibly have gotten out of sight again.</p>

<p>Little Joe darted over to the log and looked on the other side.
There was the fat trout, and there also was Little Joe's smallest
cousin, Shadow the Weasel, who is a great thief and altogether
bad. Little Joe sprang at him angrily, but Shadow was too quick
and darted away. Little Joe put the fish back on the log and waited.
This time he didn't take his eyes off it. At last, when he was
almost ready to give up, he saw Buster Bear shuffling along towards
the Laughing Brook. Suddenly Buster stopped and sniffed. One of
the Merry Little Breezes had carried the scent of that fat trout
over to him. Then he came straight over to where the fish lay,
his nose wrinkling, and his eyes twinkling with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Now I wonder who was so thoughtful as to leave this fine breakfast
ready for me," said he out loud.</p>

<p>"Me," said Little Joe in a rather faint voice. "I caught it especially
for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Buster, and his eyes twinkled more than
ever. "I think we are going to be friends."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I hope so," replied Little Joe.</p>
