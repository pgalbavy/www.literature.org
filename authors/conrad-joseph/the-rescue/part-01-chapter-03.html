<p>After waiting a moment, Carter went on deck. The sky, the sea,
the brig itself had disappeared in a darkness that had become
impenetrable, palpable, and stifling. An immense cloud had come
up running over the heavens, as if looking for the little craft,
and now hung over it, arrested. To the south there was a livid
trembling gleam, faint and sad, like a vanishing memory of destroyed
starlight. To the north, as if to prove the impossible, an incredibly
blacker patch outlined on the tremendous blackness of the sky
the heart of the coming squall. The glimmers in the water had
gone out and the invisible sea all around lay mute and still as
if it had died suddenly of fright.</p>

<p>Carter could see nothing. He felt about him people moving; he
heard them in the darkness whispering faintly as if they had been
exchanging secrets important or infamous. The night effaced even
words, and its mystery had captured everything and every sound&mdash;had
left nothing free but the unexpected that seemed to hover about
one, ready to stretch out its stealthy hand in a touch sudden,
familiar, and appalling. Even the careless disposition of the
young ex-officer of an opium-clipper was affected by the ominous
aspect of the hour. What was this vessel? What were those people?
What would happen to-morrow? To the yacht? To himself? He felt
suddenly without any additional reason but the darkness that it
was a poor show, anyhow, a dashed poor show for all hands. The
irrational conviction made him falter for a second where he stood
and he gripped the slide of the companionway hard.</p>

<p>Shaw's voice right close to his ear relieved and cleared his
troubled thoughts.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's you, Mister. Come up at last," said the mate of the
brig slowly. "It appears we've got to give you a tow now. Of all
the rum incidents, this beats all. A boat sneaks up from nowhere
and turns out to be a long-expected friend! For you are one of
them friends the skipper was going to meet somewhere here. Ain't
you now? Come! I know more than you may think. Are we off to&mdash;you
may just as well tell&mdash;off to&mdash;h'm ha . . . you know?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I know. Don't you?" articulated Carter, innocently.</p>

<p>Shaw remained very quiet for a minute.</p>

<p>"Where's my skipper?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"I left him down below in a kind of trance. Where's my boat?"</p>

<p>"Your boat is hanging astern. And my opinion is that you are
as uncivil as I've proved you to be untruthful. Egzz-actly."</p>

<p>Carter stumbled toward the taffrail and in the first step he
made came full against somebody who glided away. It seemed to
him that such a night brings men to a lower level. He thought
that he might have been knocked on the head by anybody strong
enough to lift a crow-bar. He felt strangely irritated. He said
loudly, aiming his words at Shaw whom he supposed somewhere near:</p>

<p>"And my opinion is that you and your skipper will come to a sudden
bad end before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought you were in your boat. Have you changed your mind?"
asked Lingard in his deep voice close to Carter's elbow.</p>

<p>Carter felt his way along the rail, till his hand found a line
that seemed, in the calm, to stream out of its own accord into
the darkness. He hailed his boat, and directly heard the wash
of water against her bows as she was hauled quickly under the
counter. Then he loomed up shapeless on the rail, and the next
moment disappeared as if he had fallen out of the universe. Lingard
heard him say:</p>

<p>"Catch hold of my leg, John." There were hollow sounds in the
boat; a voice growled, "All right."</p>

<p>"Keep clear of the counter," said Lingard, speaking in quiet
warning tones into the night. "The brig may get a lot of sternway
on her should this squall not strike her fairly."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye. I will mind," was the muttered answer from the water.</p>

<p>Lingard crossed over to the port side, and looked steadily at
the sooty mass of approaching vapours. After a moment he said
curtly, "Brace up for the port tack, Mr. Shaw," and remained silent,
with his face to the sea. A sound, sorrowful and startling like
the sigh of some immense creature, travelling across the starless
space, passed above the vertical and lofty spars of the motionless
brig.</p>

<p>It grew louder, then suddenly ceased for a moment, and the taut
rigging of the brig was heard vibrating its answer in a singing
note to this threatening murmur of the winds. A long and slow
undulation lifted the level of the waters, as if the sea had drawn
a deep breath of anxious suspense. The next minute an immense
disturbance leaped out of the darkness upon the sea, kindling
upon it a livid clearness of foam, and the first gust of the squall
boarded the brig in a stinging flick of rain and spray. As if
overwhelmed by the suddenness of the fierce onset, the vessel
remained for a second upright where she floated, shaking with
tremendous jerks from trucks to keel; while high up in the night
the invisible canvas was heard rattling and beating about violently.</p>

<p>Then, with a quick double report, as of heavy guns, both topsails
filled at once and the brig fell over swiftly on her side. Shaw
was thrown headlong against the skylight, and Lingard, who had
encircled the weather rail with his arm, felt the vessel under
his feet dart forward smoothly, and the deck become less slanting&mdash;the
speed of the brig running off a little now, easing the overturning
strain of the wind upon the distended surfaces of the sails. It
was only the fineness of the little vessel's lines and the perfect
shape of her hull that saved the canvas, and perhaps the spars,
by enabling the ready craft to get way upon herself with such
lightning-like rapidity. Lingard drew a long breath and yelled
jubilantly at Shaw who was struggling up against wind and rain
to his commander's side.</p>

<p>"She'll do. Hold on everything."</p>

<p>Shaw tried to speak. He swallowed great mouthfuls of tepid water
which the wind drove down his throat. The brig seemed to sail
through undulating waves that passed swishing between the masts
and swept over the decks with the fierce rush and noise of a cataract.
From every spar and every rope a ragged sheet of water streamed
flicking to leeward. The overpowering deluge seemed to last for
an age; became unbearable&mdash;and, all at once, stopped. In a couple
of minutes the shower had run its length over the brig and now
could be seen like a straight grey wall, going away into the night
under the fierce whispering of dissolving clouds. The wind eased.
To the northward, low down in the darkness, three stars appeared
in a row, leaping in and out between the crests of waves like
the distant heads of swimmers in a running surf; and the retreating
edge of the cloud, perfectly straight from east to west, slipped
along the dome of the sky like an immense hemispheric, iron shutter
pivoting down smoothly as if operated by some mighty engine. An
inspiring and penetrating freshness flowed together with the shimmer
of light, through the augmented glory of the heaven, a glory exalted,
undimmed, and strangely startling as if a new world had been created
during the short flight of the stormy cloud. It was a return to
life, a return to space; the earth coming out from under a pall
to take its place in the renewed and immense scintillation of
the universe.</p>

<p>The brig, her yards slightly checked in, ran with an easy motion
under the topsails, jib and driver, pushing contemptuously aside
the turbulent crowd of noisy and agitated waves. As the craft
went swiftly ahead she unrolled behind her over the uneasy darkness
of the sea a broad ribbon of seething foam shot with wispy gleams
of dark discs escaping from under the rudder. Far away astern,
at the end of a line no thicker than a black thread, which dipped
now and then its long curve in the bursting froth, a toy-like
object could be made out, elongated and dark, racing after the
brig over the snowy whiteness of her wake.</p>

<p>Lingard walked aft, and, with both his hands on the taffrail,
looked eagerly for Carter's boat. The first glance satisfied him
that the yacht's gig was towing easily at the end of the long
scope of line, and he turned away to look ahead and to leeward
with a steady gaze. It was then half an hour past midnight and
Shaw, relieved by Wasub, had gone below. Before he went, he said
to Lingard, "I will be off, sir, if you're not going to make more
sail yet." "Not yet for a while," had answered Lingard in a preoccupied
manner; and Shaw departed aggrieved at such a neglect of making
the best of a good breeze.</p>

<p>On the main deck dark-skinned men, whose clothing clung to their
shivering limbs as if they had been overboard, had finished recoiling
the braces, and clearing the gear. The kassab, after having hung
the fore-topsail halyards in the becket, strutted into the waist
toward a row of men who stood idly with their shoulders against
the side of the long boat amidships. He passed along looking up
close at the stolid faces. Room was made for him, and he took
his place at the end.</p>

<p>"It was a great rain and a mighty wind, O men," he said, dogmatically,
"but no wind can ever hurt this ship. That I knew while I stood
minding the sail which is under my care."</p>

<p>A dull and inexpressive murmur was heard from the men. Over the
high weather rail, a topping wave flung into their eyes a handful
of heavy drops that stung like hail. There were low groans of
indignation. A man sighed. Another emitted a spasmodic laugh through
his chattering teeth. No one moved away. The little kassab wiped
his face and went on in his cracked voice, to the accompaniment
of the swishing sounds made by the seas that swept regularly astern
along the ship's side.</p>

<p>"Have you heard him shout at the wind&mdash;louder than the wind?
I have heard, being far forward. And before, too, in the many
years I served this white man I have heard him often cry magic
words that make all safe. Ya-wa! This is truth. Ask Wasub who
is a Haji, even as I am."</p>

<p>"I have seen white men's ships with their masts broken&mdash;also
wrecked like our own praus," remarked sadly a lean, lank fellow
who shivered beside the kassab, hanging his head and trying to
grasp his shoulder blades.</p>

<p>"True," admitted the kassab. "They are all the children of Satan
but to some more favour is shown. To obey such men on the sea
or in a fight is good. I saw him who is master here fight with
wild men who eat their enemies&mdash;far away to the eastward&mdash;and
I dealt blows by his side without fear; for the charms he, no
doubt, possesses protect his servants also. I am a believer and
the Stoned One can not touch my forehead. Yet the reward of victory
comes from the accursed. For six years have I sailed with that
white man; first as one who minds the rudder, for I am a man of
the sea, born in a prau, and am skilled in such work. And now,
because of my great knowledge of his desires, I have the care
of all things in this ship."</p>

<p>Several voices muttered, "True. True." They remained apathetic
and patient, in the rush of wind, under the repeated short flights
of sprays. The slight roll of the ship balanced them stiffly all
together where they stood propped against the big boat. The breeze
humming between the inclined masts enveloped their dark and silent
figures in the unceasing resonance of its breath.</p>

<p>The brig's head had been laid so as to pass a little to windward
of the small islands of the Carimata group. They had been till
then hidden in the night, but now both men on the lookout reported
land ahead in one long cry. Lingard, standing to leeward abreast
of the wheel, watched the islet first seen. When it was nearly
abeam of the brig he gave his orders, and Wasub hurried off to
the main deck. The helm was put down, the yards on the main came
slowly square and the wet canvas of the main-topsail clung suddenly
to the mast after a single heavy flap. The dazzling streak of
the ship's wake vanished. The vessel lost her way and began to
dip her bows into the quick succession of the running head seas.
And at every slow plunge of the craft, the song of the wind would
swell louder amongst the waving spars, with a wild and mournful
note.</p>

<p>Just as the brig's boat had been swung out, ready for lowering,
the yacht's gig hauled up by its line appeared tossing and splashing
on the lee quarter. Carter stood up in the stern sheets balancing
himself cleverly to the disordered motion of his cockleshell.
He hailed the brig twice to know what was the matter, not being
able from below and in the darkness to make out what that confused
group of men on the poop were about. He got no answer, though
he could see the shape of a man standing by himself aft, and apparently
watching him. He was going to repeat his hail for the third time
when he heard the rattling of tackles followed by a heavy splash,
a burst of voices, scrambling hollow sounds&mdash;and a dark mass detaching
itself from the brig's side swept past him on the crest of a passing
wave. For less than a second he could see on the shimmer of the
night sky the shape of a boat, the heads of men, the blades of
oars pointing upward while being got out hurriedly. Then all this
sank out of sight, reappeared once more far off and hardly discernible,
before vanishing for good.</p>

<p>"Why, they've lowered a boat!" exclaimed Carter, falling back
in his seat. He remembered that he had seen only a few hours ago
three native praus lurking amongst those very islands. For a moment
he had the idea of casting off to go in chase of that boat, so
as to find out. . . . Find out what? He gave up his idea at once.
What could he do?</p>

<p>The conviction that the yacht, and everything belonging to her,
were in some indefinite but very real danger, took afresh a strong
hold of him, and the persuasion that the master of the brig was
going there to help did not by any means assuage his alarm. The
fact only served to complicate his uneasiness with a sense of
mystery.</p>

<p>The white man who spoke as if that sea was all his own, or as
if people intruded upon his privacy by taking the liberty of getting
wrecked on a coast where he and his friends did some queer business,
seemed to him an undesirable helper. That the boat had been lowered
to communicate with the praus seen and avoided by him in the evening
he had no doubt. The thought had flashed on him at once. It had
an ugly look. Yet the best thing to do after all was to hang on
and get back to the yacht and warn them. . . . Warn them against
whom? The man had been perfectly open with him. Warn them against
what? It struck him that he hadn't the slightest conception of
what would happen, of what was even likely to happen. That strange
rescuer himself was bringing the news of danger. Danger from the
natives of course. And yet he was in communication with those
natives. That was evident. That boat going off in the night. .
. . Carter swore heartily to himself. His perplexity became positive
bodily pain as he sat, wet, uncomfortable, and still, one hand
on the tiller, thrown up and down in headlong swings of his boat.
And before his eyes, towering high, the black hull of the brig
also rose and fell, setting her stern down in the sea, now and
again, with a tremendous and foaming splash. Not a sound from
her reached Carter's ears. She seemed an abandoned craft but for
the outline of a man's head and body still visible in a watchful
attitude above the taffrail.</p>

<p>Carter told his bowman to haul up closer and hailed:</p>

<p>"Brig ahoy. Anything wrong?"</p>

<p>He waited, listening. The shadowy man still watched. After some
time a curt "No" came back in answer.</p>

<p>"Are you going to keep hove-to long?" shouted Carter.</p>

<p>"Don't know. Not long. Drop your boat clear of the ship. Drop
clear. Do damage if you don't."</p>

<p>"Slack away, John!" said Carter in a resigned tone to the elderly
seaman in the bow. "Slack away and let us ride easy to the full
scope. They don't seem very talkative on board there."</p>

<p>Even while he was speaking the line ran out and the regular undulations
of the passing seas drove the boat away from the brig. Carter
turned a little in his seat to look at the land. It loomed up
dead to leeward like a lofty and irregular cone only a mile or
a mile and a half distant. The noise of the surf beating upon
its base was heard against the wind in measured detonations. The
fatigue of many days spent in the boat asserted itself above the
restlessness of Carter's thoughts and, gradually, he lost the
notion of the passing time without altogether losing the consciousness
of his situation.</p>

<p>In the intervals of that benumbed stupor&mdash;rather than sleep&mdash;he
was aware that the interrupted noise of the surf had grown into
a continuous great rumble, swelling periodically into a loud roar;
that the high islet appeared now bigger, and that a white fringe
of foam was visible at its feet. Still there was no stir or movement
of any kind on board the brig. He noticed that the wind was moderating
and the sea going down with it, and then dozed off again for a
minute. When next he opened his eyes with a start, it was just
in time to see with surprise a new star soar noiselessly straight
up from behind the land, take up its position in a brilliant constellation&mdash;and
go out suddenly. Two more followed, ascending together, and after
reaching about the same elevation, expired side by side.</p>

<p>"Them's rockets, sir&mdash;ain't they?" said one of the men in a muffled
voice.</p>

<p>"Aye, rockets," grunted Carter. "And now, what's the next move?"
he muttered to himself dismally.</p>

<p>He got his answer in the fierce swishing whirr of a slender ray
of fire that, shooting violently upward from the sombre hull of
the brig, dissolved at once into a dull red shower of falling
sparks. Only one, white and brilliant, remained alone poised high
overhead, and after glowing vividly for a second, exploded with
a feeble report. Almost at the same time he saw the brig's head
fall off the wind, made out the yards swinging round to fill the
main topsail, and heard distinctly the thud of the first wave
thrown off by the advancing bows. The next minute the tow-line
got the strain and his boat started hurriedly after the brig with
a sudden jerk.</p>

<p>Leaning forward, wide awake and attentive, Carter steered. His
men sat one behind another with shoulders up, and arched backs,
dozing, uncomfortable but patient, upon the thwarts. The care
requisite to steer the boat properly in the track of the seething
and disturbed water left by the brig in her rapid course prevented
him from reflecting much upon the incertitude of the future and
upon his own unusual situation.</p>

<p>Now he was only exceedingly anxious to see the yacht again, and
it was with a feeling of very real satisfaction that he saw all
plain sail being made on the brig. Through the remaining hours
of the night he sat grasping the tiller and keeping his eyes on
the shadowy and high pyramid of canvas gliding steadily ahead
of his boat with a slight balancing movement from side to side.</p>
