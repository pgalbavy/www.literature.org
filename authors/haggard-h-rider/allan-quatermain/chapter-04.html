<p>After dinner we thoroughly inspected all the outbuildings and grounds
of the station, which I consider the most successful as well as the most
beautiful place of the sort that I have seen in Africa. We then returned
to the veranda, where we found Umslopogaas taking advantage of this
favourable opportunity to clean all the rifles thoroughly. This was the
only <u>work</u> that he ever did or was asked to do, for as a Zulu chief it
was beneath his dignity to work with his hands; but such as it was he
did it very well. It was a curious sight to see the great Zulu sitting
there upon the floor, his battleaxe resting against the wall behind
him, whilst his long aristocratic-looking hands were busily employed,
delicately and with the utmost care, cleaning the mechanism of the
breech-loaders. He had a name for each gun. One--a double four-bore
belonging to Sir Henry--was the Thunderer; another, my 500 Express,
which had a peculiarly sharp report, was ‘the little one who spoke like
a whip’; the Winchester repeaters were ‘the women, who talked so fast
that you could not tell one word from another’; the six Martinis were
‘the common people’; and so on with them all. It was very curious to
hear him addressing each gun as he cleaned it, as though it were an
individual, and in a vein of the quaintest humour. He did the same with
his battle-axe, which he seemed to look upon as an intimate friend,
and to which he would at times talk by the hour, going over all his old
adventures with it--and dreadful enough some of them were. By a piece of
grim humour, he had named this axe ‘Inkosi-kaas’, which is the Zulu word
for chieftainess. For a long while I could not make out why he gave it
such a name, and at last I asked him, when he informed me that the axe
was very evidently feminine, because of her womanly habit of prying very
deep into things, and that she was clearly a chieftainess because all
men fell down before her, struck dumb at the sight of her beauty and
power. In the same way he would consult ‘Inkosi-kaas’ if in any dilemma;
and when I asked him why he did so, he informed me it was because she
must needs be wise, having ‘looked into so many people’s brains’.
</p>
<p>I took up the axe and closely examined this formidable weapon. It was,
as I have said, of the nature of a pole-axe. The haft, made out of an
enormous rhinoceros horn, was three feet three inches long, about an
inch and a quarter thick, and with a knob at the end as large as a
Maltese orange, left there to prevent the hand from slipping. This
horn haft, though so massive, was as flexible as cane, and practically
unbreakable; but, to make assurance doubly sure, it was whipped round
at intervals of a few inches with copper wire--all the parts where the
hands grip being thus treated. Just above where the haft entered the
head were scored a number of little nicks, each nick representing a man
killed in battle with the weapon. The axe itself was made of the
most beautiful steel, and apparently of European manufacture, though
Umslopogaas did not know where it came from, having taken it from the
hand of a chief he had killed in battle many years before. It was not
very heavy, the head weighing two and a half pounds, as nearly as I
could judge. The cutting part was slightly concave in shape--not convex,
as it generally the case with savage battleaxes--and sharp as a razor,
measuring five and three-quarter inches across the widest part. From the
back of the axe sprang a stout spike four inches long, for the last two
of which it was hollow, and shaped like a leather punch, with an opening
for anything forced into the hollow at the punch end to be pushed
out above--in fact, in this respect it exactly resembled a butcher’s
pole-axe. It was with this punch end, as we afterwards discovered, that
Umslopogaas usually struck when fighting, driving a neat round hole
in his adversary’s skull, and only using the broad cutting edge for a
circular sweep, or sometimes in a melee. I think he considered the
punch a neater and more sportsmanlike tool, and it was from his habit
of pecking at his enemy with it that he got his name of ‘Woodpecker’.
Certainly in his hands it was a terribly efficient one.
</p><p>Such was Umslopogaas’ axe, Inkosi-kaas, the most remarkable and fatal
hand-to-hand weapon that I ever saw, and one which he cherished as
much as his own life. It scarcely ever left his hand except when he was
eating, and then he always sat with it under his leg.
</p><p>Just as I returned his axe to Umslopogaas, Miss Flossie came up and took
me off to see her collection of flowers, African liliums, and blooming
shrubs, some of which are very beautiful, many of the varieties being
quite unknown to me and also, I believe, to botanical science. I asked
her if she had ever seen or heard of the ‘Goya’ lily, which Central
African explorers have told me they have occasionally met with and whose
wonderful loveliness has filled them with astonishment. This lily, which
the natives say blooms only once in ten years, flourishes in the
most arid soil. Compared to the size of the bloom, the bulb is small,
generally weighing about four pounds. As for the flower itself (which
I afterwards saw under circumstances likely to impress its appearance
fixedly in my mind), I know not how to describe its beauty and
splendour, or the indescribable sweetness of its perfume. The
flower--for it has only one bloom--rises from the crown of the bulb on
a thick fleshy and flat-sided stem, the specimen that I saw measured
fourteen inches in diameter, and is somewhat trumpet-shaped like the
bloom of an ordinary ‘longiflorum’ set vertically. First there is
the green sheath, which in its early stage is not unlike that of a
water-lily, but which as the bloom opens splits into four portions and
curls back gracefully towards the stem. Then comes the bloom itself, a
single dazzling arch of white enclosing another cup of richest velvety
crimson, from the heart of which rises a golden-coloured pistil. I have
never seen anything to equal this bloom in beauty or fragrance, and as
I believe it is but little known, I take the liberty to describe it at
length. Looking at it for the first time I well remember that I realized
how even in a flower there dwells something of the majesty of its Maker.
To my great delight Miss Flossie told me that she knew the flower well
and had tried to grow it in her garden, but without success, adding,
however, that as it should be in bloom at this time of the year she
thought that she could procure me a specimen.
</p><p>After that I fell to asking her if she was not lonely up here among all
these savage people and without any companions of her own age.
</p><p>‘Lonely?’ she said. ‘Oh, indeed no! I am as happy as the day is long,
and besides I have my own companions. Why, I should hate to be buried
in a crowd of white girls all just like myself so that nobody could tell
the difference! Here,’ she said, giving her head a little toss, ‘I am I;
and every native for miles around knows the “Water-lily”,--for that is
what they call me--and is ready to do what I want, but in the books that
I have read about little girls in England it is not like that. Everybody
thinks them a trouble, and they have to do what their schoolmistress
likes. Oh! it would break my heart to be put in a cage like that and not
to be free--free as the air.’
</p><p>‘Would you not like to learn?’ I asked.
</p><p>‘So I do learn. Father teaches me Latin and French and arithmetic.’
</p><p>‘And are you never afraid among all these wild men?’
</p><p>‘Afraid? Oh no! they never interfere with me. I think they believe that
I am “Ngai” (of the Divinity) because I am so white and have fair hair.
And look here,’ and diving her little hand into the bodice of her dress
she produced a double-barrelled nickel-plated Derringer, ‘I always carry
that loaded, and if anybody tried to touch me I should shoot him. Once
I shot a leopard that jumped upon my donkey as I was riding along. It
frightened me very much, but I shot it in the ear and it fell dead,
and I have its skin upon my bed. Look there!’ she went on in an altered
voice, touching me on the arm and pointing to some far-away object, ‘I
said just now that I had companions; there is one of them.’
</p><p>I looked, and for the first time there burst upon my sight the glory of
Mount Kenia. Hitherto the mountain had always been hidden in mist, but
now its radiant beauty was unveiled for many thousand feet, although
the base was still wrapped in vapour so that the lofty peak or pillar,
towering nearly twenty thousand feet into the sky, appeared to be a
fairy vision, hanging between earth and heaven, and based upon the
clouds. The solemn majesty and beauty of this white peak are together
beyond the power of my poor pen to describe. There it rose straight and
sheer--a glittering white glory, its crest piercing the very blue of
heaven. As I gazed at it with that little girl I felt my whole heart
lifted up with an indescribable emotion, and for a moment great and
wonderful thoughts seemed to break upon my mind, even as the arrows of
the setting sun were breaking upon Kenia’s snows. Mr Mackenzie’s natives
call the mountain the ‘Finger of God’, and to me it did seem eloquent
of immortal peace and of the pure high calm that surely lies above this
fevered world. Somewhere I had heard a line of poetry,
</p><p>     A thing of beauty is a joy for ever,
</p><p>and now it came into my mind, and for the first time I thoroughly
understood what it meant. Base, indeed, would be the man who could look
upon that mighty snow-wreathed pile--that white old tombstone of the
years--and not feel his own utter insignificance, and, by whatever name
he calls Him, worship God in his heart. Such sights are like visions of
the spirit; they throw wide the windows of the chamber of our small
selfishness and let in a breath of that air that rushes round the
rolling spheres, and for a while illumine our darkness with a far-off
gleam of the white light which beats upon the Throne.
</p><p>Yes, such things of beauty are indeed a joy for ever, and I can well
understand what little Flossie meant when she talked of Kenia as her
companion. As Umslopogaas, savage old Zulu that he was, said when I
pointed out to him the peak hanging in the glittering air: ‘A man might
look thereon for a thousand years and yet be hungry to see.’ But he gave
rather another colour to his poetical idea when he added in a sort of
chant, and with a touch of that weird imagination for which the man was
remarkable, that when he was dead he should like his spirit to sit upon
that snow-clad peak for ever, and to rush down the steep white sides
in the breath of the whirlwind, or on the flash of the lightning, and
‘slay, and slay, and slay’.
</p><p>‘Slay what, you old bloodhound?’ I asked.
</p><p>This rather puzzled him, but at length he answered--
</p><p>‘The other shadows.’
</p><p>‘So thou wouldst continue thy murdering even after death?’ I said.
</p><p>‘I murder not,’ he answered hotly; ‘I kill in fair fight. Man is born to
kill. He who kills not when his blood is hot is a woman, and no man. The
people who kill not are slaves. I say I kill in fair fight; and when
I am “in the shadow”, as you white men say, I hope to go on killing in
fair fight. May my shadow be accursed and chilled to the bone for ever
if it should fall to murdering like a bushman with his poisoned arrows!’
And he stalked away with much dignity, and left me laughing.
</p><p>Just then the spies whom our host had sent out in the morning to find
out if there were any traces of our Masai friends about, returned,
and reported that the country had been scoured for fifteen miles round
without a single Elmoran being seen, and that they believed that those
gentry had given up the pursuit and returned whence they came. Mr
Mackenzie gave a sigh of relief when he heard this, and so indeed did
we, for we had had quite enough of the Masai to last us for some time.
Indeed, the general opinion was that, finding we had reached the mission
station in safety, they had, knowing its strength, given up the pursuit
of us as a bad job. How ill-judged that view was the sequel will show.
</p><p>After the spies had gone, and Mrs Mackenzie and Flossie had retired for
the night, Alphonse, the little Frenchman, came out, and Sir Henry, who
is a very good French scholar, got him to tell us how he came to visit
Central Africa, which he did in a most extraordinary lingo, that for the
most part I shall not attempt to reproduce.
</p><p>‘My grandfather,’ he began, ‘was a soldier of the Guard, and served
under Napoleon. He was in the retreat from Moscow, and lived for ten
days on his own leggings and a pair he stole from a comrade. He used to
get drunk--he died drunk, and I remember playing at drums on his coffin.
My father--’
</p><p>Here we suggested that he might skip his ancestry and come to the point.
</p><p>‘Bien, messieurs!’ replied this comical little man, with a polite bow.
‘I did only wish to demonstrate that the military principle is not
hereditary. My grandfather was a splendid man, six feet two high, broad
in proportion, a swallower of fire and gaiters. Also he was remarkable
for his moustache. To me there remains the moustache and--nothing more.
</p><p>‘I am, messieurs, a cook, and I was born at Marseilles. In that dear
town I spent my happy youth. For years and years I washed the dishes at
the Hotel Continental. Ah, those were golden days!’ and he sighed. ‘I am
a Frenchman. Need I say, messieurs, that I admire beauty? Nay, I adore
the fair. Messieurs, we admire all the roses in a garden, but we pluck
one. I plucked one, and alas, messieurs, it pricked my finger. She was
a chambermaid, her name Annette, her figure ravishing, her face
an angel’s, her heart--alas, messieurs, that I should have to
own it!--black and slippery as a patent leather boot. I loved to
desperation, I adored her to despair. She transported me--in every
sense; she inspired me. Never have I cooked as I cooked (for I had been
promoted at the hotel) when Annette, my adored Annette, smiled on me.
Never’--and here his manly voice broke into a sob--‘never shall I cook
so well again.’ Here he melted into tears.
</p><p>‘Come, cheer up!’ said Sir Henry in French, smacking him smartly on the
back. ‘There’s no knowing what may happen, you know. To judge from your
dinner today, I should say you were in a fair way to recovery.’
</p><p>Alphonse stopped weeping, and began to rub his back. ‘Monsieur,’ he
said, ‘doubtless means to console, but his hand is heavy. To continue:
we loved, and were happy in each other’s love. The birds in their little
nest could not be happier than Alphonse and his Annette. Then came the
blow--sapristi!--when I think of it. Messieurs will forgive me if I wipe
away a tear. Mine was an evil number; I was drawn for the conscription.
Fortune would be avenged on me for having won the heart of Annette.
</p><p>‘The evil moment came; I had to go. I tried to run away, but I was
caught by brutal soldiers, and they banged me with the butt-end
of muskets till my mustachios curled with pain. I had a cousin a
linen-draper, well-to-do, but very ugly. He had drawn a good number,
and sympathized when they thumped me. “To thee, my cousin,” I said, “to
thee, in whose veins flows the blue blood of our heroic grandparent, to
thee I consign Annette. Watch over her whilst I hunt for glory in the
bloody field.”
</p><p>‘“Make your mind easy,” said he; “I will.” As the sequel shows, he did!
</p><p>‘I went. I lived in barracks on black soup. I am a refined man and a
poet by nature, and I suffered tortures from the coarse horror of my
surroundings. There was a drill sergeant, and he had a cane. Ah, that
cane, how it curled! Alas, never can I forget it!
</p><p>‘One morning came the news; my battalion was ordered to Tonquin.
The drill sergeant and the other coarse monsters rejoiced. I--I made
enquiries about Tonquin. They were not satisfactory. In Tonquin are
savage Chinese who rip you open. My artistic tastes--for I am also an
artist--recoiled from the idea of being ripped open. The great man makes
up his mind quickly. I made up my mind. I determined not to be ripped
open. I deserted.
</p><p>‘I reached Marseilles disguised as an old man. I went to the house of
my cousin--he in whom runs my grandfather’s heroic blood--and there sat
Annette. It was the season of cherries. They took a double stalk. At
each end was a cherry. My cousin put one into his mouth, Annette put
the other in hers. Then they drew the stalks in till their eyes met--and
alas, alas that I should have to say it!--they kissed. The game was
a pretty one, but it filled me with fury. The heroic blood of my
grandfather boiled up in me. I rushed into the kitchen. I struck my
cousin with the old man’s crutch. He fell--I had slain him. Alas, I
believe that I did slay him. Annette screamed. The gendarmes came. I
fled. I reached the harbour. I hid aboard a vessel. The vessel put to
sea. The captain found me and beat me. He took an opportunity. He posted
a letter from a foreign port to the police. He did not put me ashore
because I cooked so well. I cooked for him all the way to Zanzibar. When
I asked for payment he kicked me. The blood of my heroic grandfather
boiled within me, and I shook my fist in his face and vowed to have my
revenge. He kicked me again. At Zanzibar there was a telegram. I cursed
the man who invented telegraphs. Now I curse him again. I was to be
arrested for desertion, for murder, and que sais-je? I escaped from
the prison. I fled, I starved. I met the men of Monsieur le Cure. They
brought me here. I am full of woe. But I return not to France. Better to
risk my life in these horrible places than to know the Bagne.’
</p><p>He paused, and we nearly choked with laughter, having to turn our faces
away.
</p><p>‘Ah! you weep, messieurs,’ he said. ‘No wonder--it is a sad story.’
</p><p>‘Perhaps,’ said Sir Henry, ‘the heroic blood of your grandparent will
triumph after all; perhaps you will still be great. At any rate we shall
see. And now I vote we go to bed. I am dead tired, and we had not much
sleep on that confounded rock last night.’
</p><p>And so we did, and very strange the tidy rooms and clean white sheets
seemed to us after our recent experiences.
