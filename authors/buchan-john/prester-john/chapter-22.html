<p>I must now take up some of the ragged ends which I have left
behind me. It is not my task, as I have said, to write the history
of the great Rising.  That has been done by abler men, who were
at the centre of the business, and had some knowledge of strategy
and tactics; whereas I was only a raw lad who was privileged by
fate to see the start.  If I could, I would fain make an epic
of it, and show how the Plains found at all points the Plateau
guarded, how wits overcame numbers, and at every pass which the
natives tried the great guns spoke and the tide rolled back. 
Yet I fear it would be an epic without a hero. There was no leader
left when Laputa had gone.  There were months of guerrilla fighting,
and then months of reprisals, when chief after chief was hunted
down and brought to trial. Then the amnesty came and a clean sheet,
and white Africa drew breath again with certain grave reflections
left in her head.  On the whole I am not sorry that the history
is no business of mine.  Romance died with 'the heir of John,'
and the crusade became a sorry mutiny.  I can fancy how differently
Laputa would have managed it all had he lived; how swift and sudden
his plans would have been; how under him the fighting would not
have been in the mountain glens, but far in the high-veld among
the dorps and townships.  With the Inkulu alive we warred against
odds; with the Inkulu dead the balance sank heavily in our favour. 
I leave to others the marches and strategy of the thing, and hasten
to clear up the obscure parts in my own fortunes.</p>

<p>Arcoll received my message from Umvelos' by Colin, or rather
Wardlaw received it and sent it on to the post on the Berg where
the leader had gone.  Close on its heels came the message from
Henriques by a Shangaan in his pay.  It must have been sent off
before the Portugoose got to the Rooirand, from which it would
appear that he had his own men in the bush near the store, and
that I was lucky to get off as I did. Arcoll might have disregarded
Henriques' news as a trap if it had come alone, but my corroboration
impressed and perplexed him.  He began to credit the Portugoose
with treachery, but he had no inclination to act on his message,
since it conflicted with his plans.  He knew that Laputa must
come into the Berg sooner or later, and he had resolved that his
strategy must be to await him there.  But there was the question
of my life.  He had every reason to believe that I was in the
greatest danger, and he felt a certain responsibility for my fate. 
With the few men at his disposal he could not hope to hold up
the great Kaffir army, but there was a chance that he might by
a bold stand effect my rescue. Henriques had told him of the vow,
and had told him that Laputa would ride in the centre of the force. 
A body of men well posted at Dupree's Drift might split the army
at the crossing, and under cover of the fire I might swim the
river and join my friends.  Still relying on the vow, it might
be possible for well-mounted men to evade capture. Accordingly
he called for volunteers, and sent off one of his Kaffirs to warn
me of his design.  He led his men in person, and of his doings
the reader already knows the tale. But though the crossing was
flung into confusion, and the rear of the army was compelled to
follow the northerly bank of the Letaba, there was no sign of
me anywhere.  Arcoll searched the river-banks, and crossed the
drift to where the old Keeper was lying dead.  He then concluded
that I had been murdered early in the march, and his Kaffir, who
might have given him news of me, was carried up the stream in
the tide of the disorderly army.  Therefore, he and his men rode
back with all haste to the Berg by way of Main Drift, and reached
Bruderstroom before Laputa had crossed the highway.</p>

<p>My information about Inanda's Kraal decided Arcoll's next move. 
Like me he remembered Beyers's performance, and resolved to repeat
it.  He had no hope of catching Laputa, but he thought that he
might hold up the bulk of his force if he got guns on the ridge
above the kraal.  A message had already been sent for guns, and
the first to arrive got to Bruderstroom about the hour when I
was being taken by Machudi's men in the kloof.  The ceremony of
the purification prevented Laputa from keeping a good look-out,
and the result was that a way was made for the guns on the north-western
corner of the rampart of rock.  It was the way which Beyers had
taken, and indeed the enterprise was directed by one of Beyers's
old commandants.  All that day the work continued, while Laputa
and I were travelling to Machudi's.  Then came the evening when
I staggered into camp and told my news.  Arcoll, who alone knew
how vital Laputa was to the success of the insurrection, immediately
decided to suspend all other operations and devote himself to
shepherding the leader away from his army.  How the scheme succeeded
and what befell Laputa the reader has already been told.</p>

<p>Aitken and Wardlaw, when I descended from the cliffs, took me
straight to Blaauwildebeestefontein.  I was like a man who is
recovering from bad fever, cured, but weak and foolish, and it
was a slow journey which I made to Umvelos', riding on Aitken's
pony.  At Umvelos' we found a picket who had captured the <em>schimmel</em>
by the roadside.  That wise beast, when I turned him loose at
the entrance to the cave, had trotted quietly back the way he
had come.  At Umvelos' Aitken left me, and next day, with Wardlaw
as companion, I rode up the glen of the Klein Labongo, and came
in the afternoon to my old home.  The store was empty, for Japp
some days before had gone off post-haste to Pietersdorp; but there
was Zeeta cleaning up the place as if war had never been heard
of.  I slept the night there, and in the morning found myself
so much recovered that I was eager to get away.  I wanted to see
Arcoll about many things, but mainly about the treasure in the
cave.</p>

<p>It was an easy journey to Bruderstroom through the meadows of
the plateau.  The farmers' commandoes had been recalled, but the
ashes of their camp fires were still grey among the bracken. 
I fell in with a police patrol and was taken by them to a spot
on the Upper Letaba, some miles west of the camp, where we found
Arcoll at late breakfast.  I had resolved to take him into my
confidence, so I told him the full tale of my night's adventure. 
He was very severe with me, I remember, for my daft-like ride,
but his severity relaxed before I had done with my story.</p>

<p>The telling brought back the scene to me, and I shivered at the
picture of the cave with the morning breaking through the veil
of water and Laputa in his death throes.  Arcoll did not speak
for some time.</p>

<p>'So he is dead,' he said at last, half-whispering to himself.
'Well, he was a king, and died like a king.  Our job now is simple,
for there is none of his breed left in Africa.'</p>

<p>Then I told him of the treasure.</p>

<p>'It belongs to you, Davie,' he said, 'and we must see that you
get it. This is going to be a long war, but if we survive to the
end you will be a rich man.'</p>

<p>'But in the meantime?' I asked.  'Supposing other Kaffirs hear
of it, and come back and make a bridge over the gorge? They may
be doing it now.'</p>

<p>'I'll put a guard on it,' he said, jumping up briskly.  'It's
maybe not a soldier's job, but you've saved this country, Davie,
and I'm going to make sure that you have your reward.'</p>

<p>After that I went with Arcoll to Inanda's Kraal.  I am not going
to tell the story of that performance, for it occupies no less
than two chapters in Mr Upton's book.  He makes one or two blunders,
for he spells my name with an 'o,' and he says we walked out of
the camp on our perilous mission 'with faces white and set as
a Crusader's.'  That is certainly not true, for in the first place
nobody saw us go who could judge how we looked, and in the second
place we were both smoking and feeling quite cheerful.  At home
they made a great fuss about it, and started a newspaper cry about
the Victoria Cross, but the danger was not so terrible after all,
and in any case it was nothing to what I had been through in the
past week.</p>

<p>I take credit to myself for suggesting the idea.  By this time
we had the army in the kraal at our mercy.  Laputa not having
returned, they had no plans.  It had been the original intention
to start for the Olifants on the following day, so there was a
scanty supply of food. Besides, there were the makings of a pretty
quarrel between Umbooni and some of the north-country chiefs,
and I verily believe that if we had held them tight there for
a week they would have destroyed each other in faction fights. 
In any case, in a little they would have grown desperate and tried
to rush the approaches on the north and south. Then we must either
have used the guns on them, which would have meant a great slaughter,
or let them go to do mischief elsewhere.  Arcoll was a merciful
man who had no love for butchery; besides, he was a statesman
with an eye to the future of the country after the war.  But it
was his duty to isolate Laputa's army, and at all costs, it must
be prevented from joining any of the concentrations in the south.</p>

<p>Then I proposed to him to do as Rhodes did in the Matoppos, and
go and talk to them.  By this time, I argued, the influence of
Laputa must have sunk, and the fervour of the purification be
half-forgotten.  The army had little food and no leader.  The
rank and file had never been fanatical, and the chiefs and indunas
must now be inclined to sober reflections. But once blood was
shed the lust of blood would possess them. Our only chance was
to strike when their minds were perplexed and undecided.</p>

<p>Arcoll did all the arranging.  He had a message sent to the chiefs
inviting them to an indaba, and presently word was brought back
that an indaba was called for the next day at noon.  That same
night we heard that Umbooni and about twenty of his men had managed
to evade our ring of scouts and got clear away to the south. 
This was all to our advantage, as it removed from the coming indaba
the most irreconcilable of the chiefs.</p>

<p>That indaba was a queer business.  Arcoll and I left our escort
at the foot of a ravine, and entered the kraal by the same road
as I had left it.  It was a very bright, hot winter's day, and
try as I might, I could not bring myself to think of any danger.
I believed that in this way most temerarious deeds are done; the
doer has become insensible to danger, and his imagination is clouded
with some engrossing purpose. The first sentries received us gloomily
enough, and closed behind us as they had done when Machudi's men
haled me thither.  Then the job became eerie, for we had to walk
across a green flat with thousands of eyes watching us.  By-and-by
we came to the merula tree opposite the kyas, and there we found
a ring of chiefs, sitting with cocked rifles on their knees.</p>

<p>We were armed with pistols, and the first thing Arcoll did was
to hand them to one of the chiefs. 'We come in peace,' he said. 
'We give you our lives.'</p>

<p>Then the indaba began, Arcoll leading off.  It was a fine speech
he made, one of the finest I have ever listened to.  He asked
them what their grievances were; he told them how mighty was the
power of the white man; he promised that what was unjust should
be remedied, if only they would speak honestly and peacefully;
he harped on their old legends and songs, claiming for the king
of England the right of their old monarchs.  It was a fine speech,
and yet I saw that it did not convince them.  They listened moodily,
if attentively, and at the end there was a blank silence.</p>

<p>Arcoll turned to me.  'For God's sake, Davie,' he said, 'talk
to them about Laputa.  It's our only chance.'</p>

<p>I had never tried speaking before, and though I talked their
tongue I had not Arcoll's gift of it.  But I felt that a great
cause was at stake, and I spoke up as best I could.</p>

<p>I began by saying that Inkulu had been my friend, and that at
Umvelos' before the rising he had tried to save my life.  At the
mention of the name I saw eyes brighten.  At last the audience
was hanging on my words. I told them of Henriques and his treachery. 
I told them frankly and fairly of the doings at Dupree's Drift. 
I made no secret of the part I played.  'I was fighting for my
life,' I said. 'Any man of you who is a man would have done the
like.'</p>

<p>Then I told them of my last ride, and the sight I saw at the
foot of the Rooirand.  I drew a picture of Henriques lying dead
with a broken neck, and the Inkulu, wounded to death, creeping
into the cave.</p>

<p>In moments of extremity I suppose every man becomes an orator. 
In that hour and place I discovered gifts I had never dreamed
of.  Arcoll told me afterwards that I had spoken like a man inspired,
and by a fortunate chance had hit upon the only way to move my
hearers.  I told of that last scene in the cave, when Laputa had
broken down the bridge, and had spoken his dying words&mdash;that he
was the last king in Africa, and that without him the rising was
at an end.  Then I told of his leap into the river, and a great
sigh went up from the ranks about Me.</p>

<p>'You see me here,' I said, 'by the grace of God.  I found a way
up the fall and the cliffs which no man has ever travelled before
or will travel again.  Your king is dead.  He was a great king,
as I who stand here bear witness, and you will never more see
his like.  His last words were that the Rising was over. Respect
that word, my brothers. We come to you not in war but in peace,
to offer a free pardon, and the redress of your wrongs.  If you
fight you fight with the certainty of failure, and against the
wish of the heir of John.  I have come here at the risk of my
life to tell you his commands.  His spirit approves my mission. 
Think well before you defy the mandate of the Snake, and risk
the vengeance of the Terrible Ones.'</p>

<p>After that I knew that we had won.  The chiefs talked among themselves
in low whispers, casting strange looks at me.  Then the greatest
of them advanced and laid his rifle at my feet.</p>

<p>'We believe the word of a brave man,' he said.  'We accept the
mandate of the Snake.'</p>

<p>Arcoll now took command.  He arranged for the disarmament bit
by bit, companies of men being marched off from Inanda's Kraal
to stations on the plateau where their arms were collected by
our troops, and food provided for them.  For the full history
I refer the reader to Mr Upton's work.  It took many days, and
taxed all our resources, but by the end of a week we had the whole
of Laputa's army in separate stations, under guard, disarmed,
and awaiting repatriation.</p>

<p>Then Arcoll went south to the war which was to rage around the
Swaziland and Zululand borders for many months, while to Aitken
and myself was entrusted the work of settlement.  We had inadequate
troops at our command, and but for our prestige and the weight
of Laputa's dead hand there might any moment have been a tragedy. 
The task took months, for many of the levies came from the far
north, and the job of feeding troops on a long journey was difficult
enough in the winter season when the energies of the country were
occupied with the fighting in the south.  Yet it was an experience
for which I shall ever be grateful, for it turned me from a rash
boy into a serious man.  I knew then the meaning of the white
man's duty.  He has to take all risks, recking nothing of his
life or his fortunes, and well content to find his reward in the
fulfilment of his task.  That is the difference between white
and black, the gift of responsibility, the power of being in a
little way a king; and so long as we know this and practise it,
we will rule not in Africa alone but wherever there are dark men
who live only for the day and their own bellies.  Moreover, the
work made me pitiful and kindly.  I learned much of the untold
grievances of the natives, and saw something of their strange,
twisted reasoning.  Before we had got Laputa's army back to their
kraals, with food enough to tide them over the spring sowing,
Aitken and I had got sounder policy in our heads than you will
find in the towns, where men sit in offices and see the world
through a mist of papers.</p>

<p>By this time peace was at hand, and I went back to Inanda's Kraal
to look for Colin's grave.  It was not a difficult quest, for
on the sward in front of the merula tree they had buried him.
I found a mason in the Iron Kranz village, and from the excellent
red stone of the neighbourhood was hewn a square slab with an
inscription.  It ran thus: 'Here lies buried the dog Colin, who
was killed in defending D. Crawfurd, his master. To him it was
mainly due that the Kaffir Rising failed.'  I leave those who
have read my tale to see the justice of the words.</p>
