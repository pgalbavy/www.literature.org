<p>At hearing that he was at the house of M. Eliphas de Saint-Elme
de Taillebourg de la Nox, Theophrastus was somewhat reassured,
for he had heard both Marceline and Adolphe speak of him with
reverence as a leading member of the Pneumatic Club. Theophrastus
had chanced to hear of the Pneumatic Club; and he had caused Marceline
to become a member of it (he was at the time too busy to join
it himself) under the impression that it was the chief social
club of the most prominent people in the Rubber Industry. But
of course everybody knows that Pneumatology is that part of metaphysics
which deals with the soul, in Greek <em>Pneuma</em>; and the Pneumatics
are those versed in this science, which has nothing whatever to
do with the elastic and resilient substance extracted by incision
from a tree, which was named by the benighted savages who discovered
it, the Caoutchouc. Marceline did not trouble the busy Theophrastus
with her discovery that the Pneumatic Club was a branch of Spiritualism
and not of the Rubber Industry. She contented herself with inviting
M. Adolphe Lecamus to join it also; and both of them became devout
admirers and disciples of that great expert in the Occult, M.
Eliphas de Saint-Elme de Taillebourg de la Nox. It is no wonder
that, on learning from Marceline of the painful affair of the
ears of Signor Petito, M. Lecamus should have urged instant recourse
to that great expert, to learn the proper methods of dealing with
a reincarnate soul of such unfortunate antecedents.</p>

<p>Adolphe looked at Theophrastus with deep commiseration in his
eyes, as if his conversation with the Mage had given him reason
for dismay.</p>

<p>"Come along, Marceline is here; and we are going to introduce
you to a good friend," he said sombrely.</p>

<p>He led the way down the corridor, opened a door, and ushered
Theophrastus into a large, dim room. At once his eyes were attracted
by a marvellous light which fell on the noblest, gentlest, and
most beautiful face of a man he had ever seen. The light was marvellous
because that striking figure did not seem to receive it, but to
diffuse it. When it moved, the light moved with it; it was a figure
and a torch. Before this torch knelt Marceline, her hands joined
as if in supplication; and on her fell some of the rays from this
gracious, almost divine figure.</p>

<p>Then Theophrastus heard a friendly voice, a male voice, but sweeter
far than the voice of any woman, which said, "Come to me without
fear."</p>

<p>Theophrastus still gazed in wonder at the kind of astral light
which was diffused from the figure of the Mage, the light which
the painter James Tissot has succeeded in reproducing, in an engraving
of great beauty, from a photograph of a mediumistic apparition
communicated to the Congress of Spiritualists of 1910 by Doctor
Macnab. In this drawing, beside the materialised figure of a young
girl, stands M. Eliphas de Saint-Elme de Taillebourg de la Nox
and his light.</p>

<p>Theophrastus gazed silently upon the radiant visage of M. Eliphas
de la Nox (it would be unfair on the ink of the printer to give
him his full name every time I mention him). Then, since he felt
a sudden strong sympathy with this radiant being into whose presence
he had been so suddenly introduced, in spite of having found him
in a frame he thought almost diabolic, he plucked up courage and
resolved to learn the meaning of all the strange things he had
seen.</p>

<p>"I don't know where I am," he said somewhat plaintively. "But
since I see my friend Adolphe and my wife Marceline with you,
I feel reassured. I should like very much to know your name."</p>

<p>"My friend, I am called Eliphas de Saint-Elme de Taillebourg
de la Nox."</p>

<p>"You're really called all that?" said Theophrastus, who was beginning
to recover his spirits.</p>

<p>The radiant being bowed his head gravely.</p>

<p>"Well, after all, there's nothing very astonishing in that,"
said Theophrastus. "My name, my real name, my actual family name,
is Cartouche; and for a long time everybody has believed that
it was a nickname."</p>

<p>"Your name is <em>not</em> Cartouche; it is Theophrastus Longuet,"
said M. Eliphas de la Nox with gentle firmness.</p>

<p>"The one does not prevent the other," said Theophrastus, who
better than anyone else knew what he was talking about, quite
logically.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said M. Eliphas de la Nox, with the same
gentle firmness. "You must not cherish this confusion of mind.
<em>Once upon a time</em> your name was Cartouche, but <em>now</em>
it is Theophrastus Longuet. Understand that: <em>you are</em>
Theophrastus Longuet. My friend, listen to me carefully, as you
would listen to a physician who was going to heal you. For you
are ill, my friend, very ill, exactly because you believe you
are Cartouche, when you are really Theophrastus Longuet. I appeal
to all the simplicity of your soul."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Theophrastus. "I like simple things
myself; so I dislike very much, very much indeed, the way by which
one comes to see you, through a labyrinth of passages, with skeletons
hanging up in them. What's he doing in your house, by the way,
that skeleton, instead of resting quietly on Saint-Chaumont Hill?
<em>I recognised him at once.</em> They were dragging him to the
charnel-house at the Gallows of Montfaucon the very day of my
marriage with my dear wife Marie-Antoinette Neron, when we were
having our wedding breakfast at the Chopinettes. Beaulieu and
Old Easy-Going were with us. At that epoch, my dear M. Eliphas
de Taillepot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eliphas de Taillebourg," corrected Adolphe in a somewhat shocked
tone.</p>

<p>"At that epoch&mdash;my friend Adolphe, who's as serious as a donkey,
will tell you so&mdash;they no longer hung people at the Gallows of
Montfaucon, but they used to throw into the charnel-house of those
gallows the remains of people whom they hung elsewhere. That's
how it was that this poor Gastelard, whose skeleton I recognised
just now, was dragged to the charnel-house after having been hung
in the Place de Grève. Gastelard, my dear M. St. Elmo's-Fire&mdash;"</p>

<p>"De Saint-Elme," M. Lecamus corrected him again.</p>

<p>"My dear M. de Saint-Elme, Gastelard wasn't up to much, a poor
beggar full of imagination, who, having one day disguised himself
as a King's deputy, demanded his sword from a gentleman, showing
him at the same time an Order of Committal. The gentleman believed
that he was being duly arrested, and handed over his sword, the
hilt of which was gold and the most beautiful you ever saw. The
story ended with Gastelard at the end of a rope. But I'll be hanged,
my dear M. de l'Equinox&mdash;"</p>

<p>"De la Nox," insisted Adolphe.</p>

<p>"De la Nose, my dear M. de la Nose, I'll be hanged if I ever
expected that I should one day find his skeleton in a house in
Huchette Street!"</p>

<p>The Mage, motionless and silent, regarded Theophrastus and his
talk with an attention nothing could divert.</p>

<p>"I have never laughed anywhere so much as at Saint-Chaumont Hill,
between Chopinettes mill and Cock mill," said Theophrastus with
the same garrulous cheerfulness. "Chopinettes tavern was there;
it had taken the place of the tavern François Villon was so fond
of, where for centuries all the cullies and doxies of Paris used
to come on hanging-days to carouse. It was between Chopinettes
mill, Cock mill and the Gallows of Montfaucon that I buried my
treasures; and if you have a plan of old Paris, my dear M. Elephant
de Taillepot de St. Elmo's Fire de la Nose&mdash;"</p>

<p>Theophrastus had not quite come to the end of his host's name,
when, of a sudden, the darkness fled; and the room and all in
it shone clear in the brilliant light of day.</p>

<p>He looked round him with manifest satisfaction, at his wife,
who was muttering a prayer, at his friend Adolphe, who was on
the verge of tears, at the bookshelves, which practically walled
the room, and at M. Eliphas de la Nox, who smiled at him with
gentle compassion. The Mage had lost his supernatural air; his
cloak of astral light had gone; and if his features had still
their sublime and ineffable pallor, he none the less looked a
man like anybody else.</p>

<p>"I like this a good deal better," said Theophrastus with a deep
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>The Mage raised his hand. "No: I will not give you a map of old
Paris to look at, though I have them of every age," he said. "You
have nothing to do with old Paris. You are Theophrastus Longuet;
and we are in the year 1911."</p>

<p>"That's all very well. But it's a question of my treasure, treasures
which belong to me," said Theophrastus stubbornly. "And I have
every right to look in a map of old Paris at the place where I
formerly buried my treasures, in order that I may see on a map
of new Paris where I shall have to hunt again. It's clear&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Mage interrupted him, saying to M. Lecamus, "I have often
seen here crises of Karma; but it has never been my privilege
to study one of such force."</p>

<p>"Oh, but so far you've seen nothing&mdash;nothing at all!" cried Theophrastus.</p>

<p>The Mage reflected a moment; then he took Theophrastus to a map
of the Paris of to-day which hung on the wall of this great library,
and pointed out to him the exact spot on which had stood Chopinettes
mill, Cock mill, and the Gallows of Montfaucon. Then he laid his
finger in the middle of the triangle they formed, and said: "Here
is where you must hunt, my friend, to recover your treasures.
But all this quarter has been altered again and again; and I very
much doubt whether your treasures will still be found where you
buried them. I have shown you the spot on a modern map, to clear
your mind of the matter. For, my friend, <em>you must clear your
mind</em>. You must not dwell on your treasures. You must not
live in the past. <em>It is a crime.</em> You must live in the
present, that is to say, <em>for the Future</em>. My friend, you
must drive out Cartouche, because Cartouche is no more. It is
Theophrastus Longuet <em>who is</em>."</p>

<p>The Mage pronounced these words in a tone of the most solemn
earnestness. Theophrastus smiled at him sadly, and said: "I'm
very much obliged to you for your interest in me; and I will not
hide from you the fact that I find you extremely sympathetic,
in spite of your skeletons and the odd words which crawl about
your walls. You must be very learned indeed, to judge from all
these shelves full of books. And you must be very good-hearted,
for you have certainly treated me with the greatest kindness;
but I tell you&mdash;and sorry I am to say it&mdash;that you can do nothing
for me. For unfortunately, my dear sir, you think that I'm ill;
but I'm not ill at all. If I were ill, I've no doubt that you'd
cure me, but one doesn't cure a man who's not ill. You say to
me, you must drive out Cartouche. It's a grand thing to say, splendid;
but I don't believe it, my dear M. Elephant de Brandebourg de
St. Elmo's Fire de la Box."</p>

<p>But the Mage took his hand, and said with unchanged kindliness:</p>

<p>"None the less Cartouche must be <em>driven out, for if we do
not succeed in driving him out</em>, we shall have to <em>kill
him</em>; and I will not conceal from you, my dear M. Longuet,
the fact that that is an exceedingly difficult operation."</p>

<p>"When the Man of Light," says Theophrastus in his memoirs, "undertook
to relieve me of this obsession by Cartouche, which was not, alas!
a matter of imagination but a very real thing, I could only smile
pitifully at his vast conceit. But when I understood that he proposed
to drive him out by the sole miracle of the reason, I thought
it was time to serve the Mage up hot at Charenton lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>"But presently, when he had explained the matter more fully to
me, and I began to understand his theory and method, I found myself
in full agreement with him and ready to serve his purpose of driving
Cartouche out of me by the sole miracle of the reason. Indeed
I came in the end to appreciate the vast abyss which separated
the Man of Light from my friend Adolphe, the vast abyss which
will always separate the Man of Reason from the Learned Ape.</p>

<p>"First of all, he assured me that I had been Cartouche. He was
assured of it. And furthermore it was the most natural thing in
the world. He said he had scolded Adolphe for having presented
my case to him as exceptional, when my case was the case of everybody.
Of course, everybody has not been Cartouche. But everybody has
been, before their existence of to-day, a good many other people,
among whom may very well have been found persons every whit as
bad as Cartouche.</p>

<p>"You understand the Man of Light: mine was an every-day case.
Everybody has lived before living and will live again. He told
me that it was 'The Law of Karma.' <em>One is being born all the
time; one never dies. And when one dies, it is that one is being
born again, and so on from the beginning of beginnings!</em></p>

<p>"It is understood that at each birth the personality differs
from the preceding and succeeding personalities, but each is only
a modification of the divine and spiritual ego. These different
personalities are in a way only the rings in the infinite chain
of life which constitutes throughout the ages our Immortal Individuality.</p>

<p>"And then the Man of Light told me that when one has grasped
this immense truth, one should not be astonished that some of
the events of <em>to-day</em> recall some of the events of <em>long-ago</em>.
But in order to live according to the law of wisdom one should
live in the present and never look backward. I had looked backward
too much. My spirit, badly guided by M. Lecamus, had during the
last few weeks been wholly occupied with the <em>long-ago</em>;
and undoubtedly, if that had gone on, I should soon have been
reduced to a state dangerously near to that of madness. I ought
to be no more astonished at having had another state of soul two
hundred years ago than I ought to be astonished at having had
another state of soul twenty years ago. Was it that the Theophrastus
of to-day had any connection with the Theophrastus of twenty years
ago? Certainly not. The Theophrastus of to-day ignored that young
man; he even disapproved of him. Would it not be stupid indeed
to devote all my faculties to reviving the Theophrastus of twenty
years ago? Therefore the great mistake I had made had been only
to live for Cartouche, because I had chanced to remember that
I had once been Cartouche.</p>

<p>"I tell you that I found the words of M. Elephant de la Box indeed
refreshing. They did me a world of good.</p>

<p>"He also told me other things which I shall remember if I live
to be a thousand years old. He told me that what are called 'Vocations'
in the men of to-day are only latent revelations of their past
lives; that what is called 'Facility' is only a retrospective
sympathy for objects with which they are better acquainted than
with anything else, because they made a more careful study of
them before this actual life; and that is the only explanation
of it.</p>

<p>"Thereupon he pressed me to his bosom, as a father embraces his
child; he breathed upon my eyes and brow his healing breath; and
he asked me if I was now persuaded of this truth, and realised
that to live happily it was necessary to bear in mind our condition
of perpetual change, and that by doing so we should learn to live
in the Present and to understand that the whole of time belonged
to us.</p>

<p>"I wept with joy, and my dear wife wept with joy, and Adolphe
wept with joy. I assured the Man of Light that I understood and
believed, that I was no longer astonished that I had been Cartouche,
though I was somewhat distressed by the fact, but that it was,
after all, so natural that I should never again give it a moment's
thought. I cried:</p>

<p>"'Be at ease! Let us all be at ease! Let us live in <em>the Present</em>!
<em>Cartouche is driven out!</em>'</p>

<p>"Thereupon Marceline asked what time it was; and Adolphe answered
that it was eleven o'clock. I pulled out my onion and saw that
it was half-past eleven. Then, since my watch keeps perfect time,
I declared that it was half-past eleven.</p>

<p>"'No. I beg your pardon, but it's eleven o'clock,' said Adolphe.</p>

<p>"'You can cut off my finger if it isn't half-past eleven!" I
cried; for I was sure of my watch.</p>

<p>"But the Man of Light looked at his watch and assured me that
it was only eleven o'clock. My friend Adolphe was right; and I
was sorry for it&mdash;on account of my finger. I am an honourable
man and an honest manufacturer. I have always kept my word; and
no bill of mine has ever been dishonoured. I did not hesitate.
Could I have done otherwise?</p>

<p>"'Very well,' I said to Adolphe. 'I owe you a finger.'</p>

<p>"And seizing a small stone tomahawk, which lay on the desk of
the Man of Light and was evidently used as a paper-weight, I raised
it in the air, and was bringing it down on the little finger of
my left hand which I had stuck well out on the corner of the desk
&mdash;I had the right to give Adolphe the little finger of my
left hand; for I had only said to him, 'You can cut off my finger,'
without stipulating which finger; and I chose the finger the loss
of which would inconvenience me the least. My little finger then
would infallibly have been cut off, had not the Man of Light caught
my wrist in a grip of steel and held it firmly.</p>

<p>"He bade me put down the tomahawk. I answered that I would not
put down the tomahawk till I had cut off my finger which belonged
to Adolphe.</p>

<p>"Adolphe exclaimed that my finger was of no use to him, and I
could keep it. Marceline joined her entreaties to his, and begged
me to keep my finger, since Adolphe made me a present of it. But
I answered him that there was no reason for him to make me presents
at this season of the year; and I answered her that she knew nothing
at all about business.</p>

<p>"Then M. Eliphraste de l'Equinox pointed out that I was not observing
the conditions of the contract: I had said, 'You can cut off my
finger'; consequently it was the privilege of Adolphe to cut off
my finger.</p>

<p>"I admired this exact logic, which indeed never failed him; and
I put down my tomahawk.</p>

<p>"I was wrong to put down my tomahawk in that house in Huchette
Street; for they flung themselves upon me, and the Man of Light
cried:</p>

<p>"'<em>Come on! It's too late! The only thing to do is to kill
him!</em>'"</p>
