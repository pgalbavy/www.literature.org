<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It is not without a certain emotion that I begin to recount here
the extraordinary adventures of Joseph Rouletabille. Down to the
present time he had so firmly opposed my doing it that I had come
to despair of ever publishing the most curious of police stories
of the past fifteen years. I had even imagined that the public
would never know the whole truth of the prodigious case known
as that of "The Yellow Room", out of which grew so many mysterious,
cruel, and sensational dramas, with which my friend was so closely
mixed up, if, propos of a recent nomination of the illustrious
Stangerson to the grade of grandcross of the Legion of Honour,
an evening journal&mdash;in an article, miserable for its ignorance,
or audacious for its perfidy&mdash;had not resuscitated a terrible
adventure of which Joseph Rouletabille had told me he wished to
be for ever forgotten.</p>

<p>"The Yellow Room"! Who now remembers this affair which caused
so much ink to flow fifteen years ago? Events are so quickly forgotten
in Paris. Has not the very name of the Nayves trial and the tragic
history of the death of little Menaldo passed out of mind? And
yet the public attention was so deeply interested in the details
of the trial that the occurrence of a ministerial crisis was completely
unnoticed at the time. Now The "Yellow Room" trial, which, preceded
that of the Nayves by some years, made far more noise. The entire
world hung for months over this obscure problem&mdash;the most obscure,
it seems to me, that has ever challenged the perspicacity of our
police or taxed the conscience of our judges. The solution of
the problem baffled everybody who tried to find it. It was like
a dramatic rebus with which old Europe and new America alike became
fascinated. That is, in truth &mdash;I am permitted to say, because
there cannot be any author’s vanity in all this, since I do nothing
more than transcribe facts on which an exceptional documentation
enables me to throw a new light&mdash;that is because, in truth, I
do not know that, in the domain of reality or imagination, one
can discover or recall to mind anything comparable, in its mystery,
with the natural mystery of The "Yellow Room".</p>

<p>That which nobody could find out, Joseph Rouletabille, aged eighteen,
then a reporter engaged on a leading journal, succeeded in discovering.
But when, at the Assize Court, he brought in the key to the whole
case, he did not tell the whole truth. He only allowed so much
of it to appear as sufficed to ensure the acquittal of an innocent
man. The reasons which he had for his reticence no longer exist.
Better still, the time has come for my friend to speak out fully.
You are going to know all; and, without further preamble, I am
going to place before your eyes the problem of "The Yellow Room"
as it was placed before the eyes of the entire world on the day
following the enactment of the drama at the Chateau du Glandier.</p>

<p>On the 25th of October, 1892, the following note appeared in
the latest edition of the "Temps":</p>

<p>"A frightful crime has been committed at the Glandier, on the
border of the forest of Sainte-Genevieve, above Epinay-sur-Orge,
at the house of Professor Stangerson. On that night, while the
master was working in his laboratory, an attempt was made to assassinate
Mademoiselle Stangerson, who was sleeping in a chamber adjoining
this laboratory. The doctors do not answer for the life of Mdlle.
Stangerson."</p>

<p>The impression made on Paris by this news may be easily imagined.
Already, at that time, the learned world was deeply interested
in the labours of Professor Stangerson and his daughter. These
labours&mdash;the first that were attempted in radiography&mdash;served
to open the way for Monsieur and Madame Curie to the discovery
of radium. It was expected the Professor would shortly read to
the Academy of Sciences a sensational paper on his new theory,&mdash;the
Dissociation of Matter,&mdash;a theory destined to overthrow from its
base the whole of official science, which based itself on the
principle of the Conservation of Energy. On the following day,
the newspapers were full of the tragedy. The "Matin," among others,
published the following article, entitled: "A Supernatural Crime":</p>

<p>"These are the only details," wrote the anonymous writer in the
"Matin"&mdash;"we have been able to obtain concerning the crime of
the Chateau du Glandier. The state of despair in which Professor
Stangerson is plunged, and the impossibility of getting any information
from the lips of the victim, have rendered our investigations
and those of justice so difficult that, at present, we cannot
form the least idea of what has passed in "The Yellow Room" in
which Mdlle. Stangerson, in her night-dress, was found lying on
the floor in the agonies of death. We have, at least, been able
to interview Daddy Jacques&mdash;as he is called in the country&mdash;a
old servant in the Stangerson family. Daddy Jacques entered "The
Yellow Room" at the same time as the Professor. This chamber adjoins
the laboratory. Laboratory and "Yellow Room" are in a pavilion
at the end of the park, about three hundred metres (a thousand
feet) from the chateau.</p>

<p>"‘It was half-past twelve at night,’ this honest old man told
us, ‘and I was in the laboratory, where Monsieur Stangerson was
still working, when the thing happened. I had been cleaning and
putting instruments in order all the evening and was waiting for
Monsieur Stangerson to go to bed. Mademoiselle Stangerson had
worked with her father up to midnight; when the twelve strokes
of midnight had sounded by the cuckoo-clock in the laboratory,
she rose, kissed Monsieur Stangerson and bade him good-night.
To me she said "bon soir, Daddy Jacques" as she passed into "The
Yellow Room". We heard her lock the door and shoot the bolt, so
that I could not help laughing, and said to Monsieur: "There’s
Mademoiselle double-locking herself in,&mdash;she must be afraid of
the ‘Bete du bon Dieu!’" Monsieur did not even hear me, he was
so deeply absorbed in what he was doing. Just then we heard the
distant miawing of a cat. "Is that going to keep us awake all
night?" I said to myself; for I must tell you, Monsieur, that,
to the end of October, I live in an attic of the pavilion over
"The Yellow Room", so that Mademoiselle should not be left alone
through the night in the lonely park. It was the fancy of Mademoiselle
to spend the fine weather in the pavilion; no doubt, she found
it more cheerful than the chateau and, for the four years it had
been built, she had never failed to take up her lodging there
in the spring. With the return of winter, Mademoiselle returns
to the chateau, for there is no fireplace in "The Yellow Room".</p>

<p>"‘We were staying in the pavilion, then &mdash;Monsieur Stangerson
and me. We made no noise. He was seated at his desk. As for me,
I was sitting on a chair, having finished my work and, looking
at him, I said to myself: "What a man!&mdash;what intelligence!&mdash;what
knowledge!" I attach importance to the fact that we made no noise;
for, because of that, the assassin certainly thought that we had
left the place. And, suddenly, while the cuckoo was sounding the
half after midnight, a desperate clamour broke out in "The Yellow
Room". It was the voice of Mademoiselle, crying "Murder!&mdash;murder!&mdash;help!"
Immediately afterwards revolver shots rang out and there was a
great noise of tables and furniture being thrown to the ground,
as if in the course of a struggle, and again the voice of Mademoiselle
calling, "Murder!&mdash;help!&mdash;Papa! &mdash;Papa!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"‘You may be sure that we quickly sprang up and that Monsieur
Stangerson and I threw ourselves upon the door. But alas! it was
locked, fast locked, on the inside, by the care of Mademoiselle,
as I have told you, with key and bolt. We tried to force it open,
but it remained firm. Monsieur Stangerson was like a madman, and
truly, it was enough to make him one, for we heard Mademoiselle
still calling "Help!&mdash;help!" Monsieur Stangerson showered terrible
blows on the door, and wept with rage and sobbed with despair
and helplessness.</p>

<p>"‘It was then that I had an inspiration. "The assassin must have
entered by the window!" I cried;&mdash;"I will go to the window!" and
I rushed from the pavilion and ran like one out of his mind.</p>

<p>"‘The inspiration was that the window of "The Yellow Room" looks
out in such a way that the park wall, which abuts on the pavilion,
prevented my at once reaching the window. To get up to it one
has first to go out of the park. I ran towards the gate and, on
my way, met Bernier and his wife, the gate-keepers, who had been
attracted by the pistol reports and by our cries. In a few words
I told them what had happened, and directed the concierge to join
Monsieur Stangerson with all speed, while his wife came with me
to open the park gate. Five minutes later she and I were before
the window of "The Yellow Room".</p>

<p>"‘The moon was shining brightly and I saw clearly that no one
had touched the window. Not only were the bars that protect it
intact, but the blinds inside of them were drawn, as I had myself
drawn them early in the evening, as I did every day, though Mademoiselle,
knowing that I was tired from the heavy work I had been doing,
had begged me not to trouble myself, but leave her to do it; and
they were just as I had left them, fastened with an iron catch
on the inside. The assassin, therefore, could not have passed
either in or out that way; but neither could I get in.</p>

<p>"‘It was unfortunate,&mdash;enough to turn one’s brain! The door of
the room locked on the inside and the blinds on the only window
also fastened on the inside; and Mademoiselle still calling for
help! &mdash;No! she had ceased to call. She was dead, perhaps.
But I still heard her father, in the pavilion, trying to break
down the door.</p>

<p>"‘With the concierge I hurried back to the pavilion. The door,
in spite of the furious attempts of Monsieur Stangerson and Bernier
to burst it open, was still holding firm; but at length, it gave
way before our united efforts,&mdash;and then what a sight met our
eyes! I should tell you that, behind us, the concierge held the
laboratory lamp&mdash;a powerful lamp, that lit the whole chamber.</p>

<p>"‘I must also tell you, monsieur, that "The Yellow Room" is a
very small room. Mademoiselle had furnished it with a fairly large
iron bedstead, a small table, a night-commode; a dressing-table,
and two chairs. By the light of the big lamp we saw all at a glance.
Mademoiselle, in her night-dress, was lying on the floor in the
midst of the greatest disorder. Tables and chairs had been overthrown,
showing that there had been a violent struggle. Mademoiselle had
certainly been dragged from her bed. She was covered with blood
and had terrible marks of finger-nails on her throat,&mdash;the flesh
of her neck having been almost torn by the nails. From a wound
on the right temple a stream of blood had run down and made a
little pool on the floor. When Monsieur Stangerson saw his daughter
in that state, he threw himself on his knees beside her, uttering
a cry of despair. He ascertained that she still breathed. As to
us, we searched for the wretch who had tried to kill our mistress,
and I swear to you, monsieur, that, if we had found him, it would
have gone hard with him!</p>

<p>"‘But how to explain that he was not there, that he had already
escaped? It passes all imagination! &mdash;Nobody under the bed,
nobody behind the furniture! &mdash;All that we discovered were
traces, blood-stained marks of a man’s large hand on the walls
and on the door; a big handkerchief red with blood, without any
initials, an old cap, and many fresh footmarks of a man on the
floor,&mdash;footmarks of a man with large feet whose boot-soles had
left a sort of sooty impression. How had this man got away? How
had he vanished? Don’t forget, monsieur, that there is no chimney
in "The Yellow Room". He could not have escaped by the door, which
is narrow, and on the threshold of which the concierge stood with
the lamp, while her husband and I searched for him in every corner
of the little room, where it is impossible for anyone to hide
himself. The door, which had been forced open against the wall,
could not conceal anything behind it, as we assured ourselves.
By the window, still in every way secured, no flight had been
possible. What then? &mdash;I began to believe in the Devil.</p>

<p>"‘But we discovered my revolver on the floor! &mdash;Yes, my
revolver! Oh! that brought me back to the reality! The Devil would
not have needed to steal my revolver to kill Mademoiselle. The
man who had been there had first gone up to my attic and taken
my revolver from the drawer where I kept it. We then ascertained,
by counting the cartridges, that the assassin had fired two shots.
Ah! it was fortunate for me that Monsieur Stangerson was in the
laboratory when the affair took place and had seen with his own
eyes that I was there with him; for otherwise, with this business
of my revolver, I don’t know where we should have been, &mdash;I
should now be under lock and bar. Justice wants no more to send
a man to the scaffold!’"</p>

<p>The editor of the "Matin" added to this interview the following
lines:</p>

<p>"We have, without interrupting him, allowed Daddy Jacques to
recount to us roughly all he knows about the crime of "The Yellow
Room". We have reproduced it in his own words, only sparing the
reader the continual lamentations with which he garnished his
narrative. It is quite understood, Daddy Jacques, quite understood,
that you are very fond of your masters; and you want them to know
it, and never cease repeating it&mdash;especially since the discovery
of your revolver. It is your right, and we see no harm in it.
We should have liked to put some further questions to Daddy Jacques&mdash;Jacques
&mdash;Louis Moustier&mdash;but the inquiry of the examining magistrate,
which is being carried on at the chateau, makes it impossible
for us to gain admission at the Glandier; and, as to the oak wood,
it is guarded by a wide circle of policemen, who are jealously
watching all traces that can lead to the pavilion, and that may
perhaps lead to the discovery of the assassin. "We have also wished
to question the concierges, but they are invisible. Finally, we
have waited in a roadside inn, not far from the gate of the chateau,
for the departure of Monsieur de Marquet, the magistrate of Corbeil.
At half-past five we saw him and his clerk and, before he was
able to enter his carriage, had an opportunity to ask him the
following question:</p>

<p>"‘Can you, Monsieur de Marquet, give us any information as to
this affair, without inconvenience to the course of your inquiry?’</p>

<p>"‘It is impossible for us to do it,’ replied Monsieur de Marquet.
‘I can only say that it is the strangest affair I have ever known.
The more we think we know something, the further we are from knowing
anything!’</p>

<p>"We asked Monsieur de Marquet to be good enough to explain his
last words; and this is what he said,&mdash;the importance of which
no one will fail to recognise:</p>

<p>"‘If nothing is added to the material facts so far established,
I fear that the mystery which surrounds the abominable crime of
which Mademoiselle Stangerson has been the victim will never be
brought to light; but it is to be hoped, for the sake of our human
reason, that the examination of the walls, and of the ceiling
of "The Yellow Room"&mdash;an examination which I shall to-morrow intrust
to the builder who constructed the pavilion four years ago&mdash;will
afford us the proof that may not discourage us. For the problem
is this: we know by what way the assassin gained admission,&mdash;he
entered by the door and hid himself under the bed, awaiting Mademoiselle
Stangerson. But how did he leave? How did he escape? If no trap,
no secret door, no hiding place, no opening of any sort is found;
if the examination of the walls&mdash;even to the demolition of the
pavilion&mdash;does not reveal any passage practicable&mdash;not only for
a human being, but for any being whatsoever&mdash;if the ceiling shows
no crack, if the floor hides no underground passage, one must
really believe in the Devil, as Daddy Jacques says!’"</p>

<p>And the anonymous writer in the "Matin" added in this article&mdash;which
I have selected as the most interesting of all those that were
published on the subject of this affair&mdash;that the examining magistrate
appeared to place a peculiar significance to the last sentence:
"One must really believe in the Devil, as Jacques says."</p>

<p>The article concluded with these lines: "We wanted to know what
Daddy Jacques meant by the cry of the Bete Du Bon Dieu." The landlord
of the Donjon Inn explained to us that it is the particularly
sinister cry which is uttered sometimes at night by the cat of
an old woman, &mdash;Mother Angenoux, as she is called in the
country. Mother Angenoux is a sort of saint, who lives in a hut
in the heart of the forest, not far from the grotto of Sainte-Genevieve.</p>

<p>""The Yellow Room", the Bete Du Bon Dieu, Mother Angenoux, the
Devil, Sainte-Genevieve, Daddy Jacques,&mdash;here is a well entangled
crime which the stroke of a pickaxe in the wall may disentangle
for us to-morrow. Let us at least hope that, for the sake of our
human reason, as the examining magistrate says. Meanwhile, it
is expected that Mademoiselle Stangerson&mdash;who has not ceased to
be delirious and only pronounces one word distinctly, ‘Murderer!
Murderer!’&mdash;will not live through the night."</p>

<p>In conclusion, and at a late hour, the same journal announced
that the Chief of the Surete had telegraphed to the famous detective,
Frederic Larsan, who had been sent to London for an affair of
stolen securities, to return immediately to Paris.</p>
