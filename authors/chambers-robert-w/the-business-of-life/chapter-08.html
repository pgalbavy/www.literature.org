<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The countryside adjacent to Silverwood was eminently and self-consciously
respectable. The fat, substantial estates still belonged to families
whose forefathers had first taken title to them. There were, of
course, a number of "colonial" houses, also a "colonial" inn,
The Desboro Arms, built to look as genuine as possible, although
only two years old, steam heated, and electric lighted.</p>

<p>But things "colonial" were the traditional capital of Silverwood,
and its thrifty and respectable inhabitants meant to maintain
the "atmosphere." To that end they had solemnly subscribed a very
small sum for an inn sign to swing in front of The Desboro Arms;
the wheelwright painted it; somebody fired a shotgunful of antiquity
into it, and American weather was rapidly doing the rest, with
a gratifying result which no degenerate European weather could
have accomplished in half a century of rain and sunshine.</p>

<p>The majority of the mansions in Silverwood township were as inoffensively
commonplace as the Desboro house. Few pre-Revolutionary structures
survived; the British had burned the countryside from Major Lockwood's
mansion at Pound Ridge all the way to Bedford Village and across
to the Connecticut line. With few exceptions, Silverwood houses
had shared the common fate when Tarleton and DeLancy galloped
amuck among the Westchester hills; but here and there some sad
old mansion still remained and was reverently cherished, as was
also the graveyard, straggling up the hill, set with odd old headstones,
upon which most remarkable cherubim smirked under a gladly permitted
accumulation of lichen.</p>

<p>Age, thrift, substance, respectability&mdash;these were the ideals
of Silverwood; and Desboro and his doings would never have been
tolerated there had it not been that a forbear of his, a certain
dissolute half-pay captain, had founded the community in 1680.
This sacred colonial fact had been Desboro's social salvation,
for which, however, he did not seem to care very much. Good women
continued to be acidly civil to him on this account, and also
because Silverwood House and its estates could no more be dropped
from the revered galaxy of the county than could a star be cast
out of their country's flag for frivolous behavior.</p>

<p>So worthy men endured him, and irreproachable women grieved for
him, although it was rumoured that he gave parties now and then
which real actresses had actually attended. Also, though he always
maintained the Desboro pew in church, he never decorated it with
his person. Nor could the countryside count on him socially, except
at eccentric intervals when his careless, graceful presence made
the Westchester gaiety seem rather stiff and pallid, and gave
the thin, sour claret an unwonted edge. And another and radical
incompatibility; the Desboros were the only family of Cavalier
descent in the township. And deep in the hearts of Silverwood
folk the Desboros had ever seemed a godless race.</p>

<p>Now, there had been already some gossip among the Westchester
hills concerning recent doings at Silverwood House. Even when
it became known that the pretty girl who sped to and fro in Desboro's
limousine, between house and station, was a celebrated art expert,
and was engaged in cataloguing the famous Desboro collection,
God-fearing people asked each other why Desboro should find it
necessary to meet her at the station in the morning, and escort
her back in the evening; and whether it were actually obligatory
for him to be present while the cataloguing was in progress.</p>

<p>Westchester womanhood was beginning to look wan and worried;
substantial gentlemen gazed inquiringly at each other over the
evening chess-board; several flippant young men almost winked
at each other. But these latter had been accustomed to New York,
and were always under suspicion in their own families.</p>

<p>Therefore, it was with relief and surprise that Silverwood began
to observe Desboro in furs, driving a rakish runabout, and careering
about Westchester with Vail, his head farmer, seated beside him,
evidently intent on committing future agriculture&mdash;palpably planning
for two grass-blades where only one, or a mullein, had hitherto
flourished within the memory of living man.</p>

<p>Fertiliser in large loads was driven into the fallow fields of
the Desboros; brush and hedges and fences were being put in order.
People beheld these radical preliminaries during afternoon drives
in their automobiles; local tradesmen reported purchases of chemicals
for soil enriching, and the sale of all sorts of farm utensils
to Desboro's agent.</p>

<p>At the Country Club all this was gravely discussed; patriarchs
mentioned it over their checkers; maidens at bowls or squash or
billiards listened to the exciting tale, wide-eyed; hockey, ski,
or skating parties gossiped recklessly about it. The conclusion
was that Desboro had already sowed his wilder oats; and the worthy
community stood watching for the prodigal's return, intending
to meet him while yet he was far off.</p>

<p>He dropped in at the Country Club one day, causing a little less
flutter than a hawk in a hen-yard. Within a week he had drifted
casually into the drawing-rooms of almost all his father's old
friends for a cup of tea or an informal chat&mdash;or for nothing in
particular except to saunter into his proper place among them
with all of the Desboro grace and amiable insouciance which they
had learned to tolerate but never entirely to approve or understand.</p>

<p>It was not quite so casually that he stopped at the Hammerton's.
And he was given tea and buns by Mrs. Hammerton, perfectly unsuspicious
of his motives. Her husband came rambling in from the hothouses,
presently, where he spent most of his serious life in pinching
back roses and chrysanthemums; and he extended to Desboro a large,
flat and placid hand.</p>

<p>"Aunt Hannah and Daisy are out&mdash;somewhere&mdash;" he explained vaguely.
"You must have passed them on the way."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw Daisy in the distance, exercising an old lady," said
Desboro carelessly. He did not add that the sight of Aunt Hannah
marching across the Westchester horizon had inspired him with
an idea.</p>

<p>From her lair in town, she had come hither, for no love of her
nephew and his family, nor yet for Westchester, but solely for
economy's bitter sake. She made such pilgrimages at intervals
every year, upsetting the Hammerton household with her sarcasms,
her harsh, high-keyed laughter, her hardened ways of defining
the word "spade"&mdash;for Aunt Hannah was a terror that Westchester
dreaded but never dreamed of ignoring, she being a wayward daughter
of the sacred soil, strangely and weirdly warped from long transplanting
among the gay and godless of Gotham town. And though her means,
after her husband's scared soul had taken flight, were painfully
attenuated, the high priests and captains among the gay and godless
feared her, and she bullied them; and she and they continued to
foregather from sheer tradition, but with mutual and sincere dislike.
For Aunt Hannah's name would always figure among the names of
certain metropolitan dowagers, dragons, gorgons, and holy harridans;
always be connected with certain traditional social events as
long as the old lady lived. And she meant to survive indefinitely,
if she had anything to say about it.</p>

<p>She came in presently with Daisy Hammerton. The latter gave her
hand frankly to her childhood's comrade; the former said:</p>

<p>"Hah! James Desboro!" very disagreeably, and started to nourish
herself at once with tea and muffins.</p>

<p>"James Desboro," she repeated scornfully, darting a wicked glance
at him where he stood smiling at her, "James Desboro, turning
plow-boy in Westchester! What's the real motive? That's what interests
me. I'm a bad old woman &mdash;I know it! All over paint and powder,
and with too small a foot and too trim a figger to be anything
except wicked. Lindley knows it; it makes his fingers tremble
when he pinches crysanthemums; Susan knows it; so does Daisy.
And I admit it. And that's why I'm suspicious of you, James; I'm
so wicked myself. Come, now; why play the honest yokel? Eh? You
good-looking good-for-nothing!"</p>

<p>"My motive," he said amiably, "is to make a living and learn
what it feels like."</p>

<p>"Been stock-gambling again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear lady."</p>

<p>"Lose much?" she sniffed.</p>

<p>"Not a very great deal."</p>

<p>"Hah! And now you've got to raise the wind, somehow?"</p>

<p>He repeated, good-humouredly: "I want to make a living."</p>

<p>The trim little old lady darted another glance at him.</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha!" she laughed, without giving any reason for the disagreeable
burst of mirth; and started in on another muffin.</p>

<p>"I think," said Mr. Hammerton, vaguely, "that James will make
an excellent agriculturist&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Excellent fiddlesticks!" observed Aunt Hannah. "He'd make a
good three-card man."</p>

<p>Daisy Hammerton said aside to Desboro:</p>

<p>"Isn't she a terror!"</p>

<p>"Oh, she likes me!" he said, amused.</p>

<p>"I know she does, immensely. She makes me take her for an hour's
walk every day&mdash;and I'm so tired of exercising her and listening
to her&mdash;unconventional stories&mdash;about you."</p>

<p>"She's a bad old thing," said Desboro affectionately, and, in
his natural voice: "Aren't you, Aunt Hannah? But there isn't a
smarter foot, or a prettier hand, or a trimmer waist in all Gotham,
is there?"</p>

<p>"Philanderer!" she retorted, in a high-pitched voice. "What about
that Van Alstyne supper at the Santa Regina?"</p>

<p>"Which one?" he asked coolly. "Stuyve is always giving 'em."</p>

<p>"Read the <em>Tattler</em>!" said the old lady, seizing more
muffins.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammerton closed her tight lips and glanced uneasily at
her daughter. Daisy sipped her tea demurely. She had read all
about it, and burned the paper in her bedroom grate.</p>

<p>Desboro gracefully ignored the subject; the old lady laughed
shrilly once or twice, and the conversation drifted toward the
more decorous themes of pinching back roses and mixing plant-food,
and preparing nourishment for various precocious horticultural
prodigies now developing in Lindley Hammerton's hothouses.</p>

<p>Daisy Hammerton, a dark young girl, with superb eyes and figure,
chatted unconcernedly with Desboro, making a charming winter picture
in her scarlet felt hat and jacket, from which the black furs
had fallen back. She went in for things violent and vigorous,
and no nonsense; rode as hard as she could in such a country,
played every game that demanded quick eye and flexible muscle&mdash;and,
in secret, alas, wrote verses and short stories unanimously rejected
by even the stodgier periodicals. But nobody suspected her of
such weakness&mdash;not even her own mother.</p>

<p>Desboro swallowed his tea and took leave of his rose-pinching
host and hostess, and their sole and lovely progeny, also, perhaps,
the result of scientific concentration. Aunt Hannah retained his
hand:</p>

<p>"Where are you going now, James?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere&mdash;home," he said, pretending embarrassment, which was
enough to interest Aunt Hannah in the trap.</p>

<p>"Oh! Nowhere&mdash;home!" she mimicked him. "Where is 'nowhere home'?
Somewhere out? I've a mind to go with you. What do you say to
that, young man?"</p>

<p>"Come along," he said, a shade too promptly; and the little,
bright, mink-like eyes sparkled with malice. The trap was sprung,
and Aunt Hannah was in it. But she didn't yet suspect it.</p>

<p>"Slip on my fur coat for me," she said. "I'll take a spin with
you in your runabout."</p>

<p>"You overwhelm me," he protested, holding up the fur coat.</p>

<p>"I may do that yet, my clever friend! Come on! No shilly-shallying!
Susan! Tell your maid to lay out that Paquin gown which broke
my financial backbone last month! I'll bring James back to dinner&mdash;or
know the reason why!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why not, now," said Desboro. "I'm going to town
early this evening."</p>

<p>"Home, nowhere, and then to town," commented Aunt Hannah loudly.
"A multi-nefarious destination. James, if you run into the <em>Ewigkeit</em>
by way of a wire fence or a tree, I'll come every night and haunt
you! But don't poke along as Lindley pokes, or I'll take the wheel
myself."</p>

<p>The deaf head-farmer, Vail, who had kept the engine going for
fear of freezing, left the wheel and crawled resignedly into the
tonneau.</p>

<p>Aunt Hannah and Desboro stowed themselves aboard; the swift car
went off like a firecracker, then sped away into the darkness
at such a pace that presently Aunt Hannah put her marmot-like
face close to Desboro's ear and swore at him.</p>

<p>"Didn't you want speed?" he asked, slowing down.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, James&mdash;home, or nowhere?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere."</p>

<p>"Well, we arrived there long ago. Now, go home&mdash;<em>your</em>
home."</p>

<p>"Sure, but I've got to catch that train&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll catch it&mdash;or something else. James?"</p>

<p>"Madame?"</p>

<p>"Some day I want to take a look at that young woman who is cataloguing
your collection."</p>

<p>"That's just what I want you to do now," he said cheerfully.
"I'm taking her to New York this evening."</p>

<p>Aunt Hannah, astonished and out of countenance, remained mute,
her sharp nose buried in her furs. She had been trapped, and she
knew it. Then her eyes glittered:</p>

<p>"You're being talked about," she said with satisfaction. "So
is she! Ha!"</p>

<p>"Much?" he asked coolly.</p>

<p>"No. The good folk are only asking each other why you meet her
at the station with your car. They think she carries antique gems
in her satchel. Later they'll suspect who the real jewel is. Ha!"</p>

<p>"I like her; that's why I meet her," he said coolly.</p>

<p>"You <em>like</em> her?"</p>

<p>"I sure do. She is some girl, dear lady."</p>

<p>"Do you think your pretense of guileless candour is disarming
me, young man?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest hope of disarming you or of concealing
anything from you."</p>

<p>"Follows," she rejoined ironically, "that there's nothing to
conceal. Bah!"</p>

<p>"Quite right; there is nothing to conceal."</p>

<p>"What do you want with her, then?"</p>

<p>"Initially, I want her to catalogue my collection; subsequently,
I wish to remain friends with her. The latter wish is becoming
a problem. I've an idea that you might solve it."</p>

<p>"<em>Friends</em> with her," repeated Aunt Hannah. "Oh, my!</p>

<p>  "'And angels whisper   Lo! the pretty pair!'</p>

<p>"I suppose! Is that the hymn-tune, James?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"What does she resemble &mdash;Venus, or Rosa Bonheur?"</p>

<p>"Look at her and make up your mind."</p>

<p>"Is she <em>very</em> pretty?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> think so. She's thin."</p>

<p>"Then what do you see unusual about her?"</p>

<p>"Everything, I think."</p>

<p>"Everything&mdash;he thinks! Oh, my sense of humour!"</p>

<p>"That," said Desboro, "is partly what I count on."</p>

<p>"Have you any remote and asinine notions of educating her and
marrying her, and foisting her on your friends? There are a few
fools still alive on earth, you know."</p>

<p>"So I've heard. I haven't the remotest idea of marrying her;
she is better fitted to educate me than I am her. Not guilty on
these two counts. But I had thought of foisting some of my friends
on her. You, for example."</p>

<p>Aunt Hannah glared at him&mdash;that is, her tiny eyes became almost
luminous, like the eyes of small animals at night, surprised by
a sudden light.</p>

<p>"I know what you're meditating!" she snapped.</p>

<p>"I suppose you do, by this time."</p>

<p>"You're very impudent. Do you know it?"</p>

<p>"Lord, Aunt Hannah, so are you!" he drawled. "But it takes genius
to get away with it."</p>

<p>The old lady was highly delighted, but she concealed it and began
such a rapid-fire tirade against him that he was almost afraid
it might bewilder him enough to affect his steering.</p>

<p>"Talk to <em>me</em> of disinterested friendship between you
and a girl of that sort!" she ended. "Not that I'd care, if I
found material in her to amuse me, and a monthly insult drawn
to my order against a solvent bank balance! What is she, James;
a pretty blue-stocking whom nobody 'understands' except you?"</p>

<p>"Make up your own mind," he repeated, as he brought around the
car and stopped before his own doorstep. "I'm not trying to tell
<em>you</em> anything. She is here. Look at her. If you like her,
be her friend&mdash;and mine."</p>

<p>Jacqueline had waited tea for him; the table was in the library,
kettle simmering over the silver lamp; and the girl was standing
before the fire, one foot on the fender, her hands loosely linked
behind her back.</p>

<p>She glanced up with unfeigned pleasure as his step sounded outside
along the stone hallway; and the smile still remained, curving
her lips, but died out in her eyes, as Mrs. Hammerton marched
in, halted, and stared at her unwinkingly.</p>

<p>Desboro presented them; Jacqueline came forward, offering a shy
hand to Aunt Hannah, and, bending her superb young head, looked
down into the beady eyes which were now fairly electric with intelligence.</p>

<p>Desboro began, easily:</p>

<p>"I asked Mrs. Hammerton to have tea with&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I asked myself," remarked Aunt Hannah, laying her other hand
over Jacqueline's&mdash;she did not know just why&mdash;perhaps because
she was vain of her hands, as well as of her feet and "figger."</p>

<p>She seated herself on the sofa and drew Jacqueline down beside
her.</p>

<p>"This young man tells me that you are cataloguing his grandfather's
accumulation of ancient tin-ware."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jacqueline, already afraid of her. And the old lady
divined it, too, with not quite as much pleasure as it usually
gave her to inspire trepidation in others.</p>

<p>Her shrill voice was a little modified when she said:</p>

<p>"Where did you learn to do such things? It's not usual, you know."</p>

<p>"You have heard of Jean Louis Nevers," suggested Desboro.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;" Mrs. Hammerton turned and looked at the girl again. "Oh!"
she said. "I've heard Cary Clydesdale speak of you, haven't I?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline made a slight, very slight, but instinctive movement
away from the old lady, on whom nothing that happened was lost.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clydesdale," said Mrs. Hammerton, "told several people where
I was present that you knew more about antiquities in art than
anybody else in New York since your father died. That's what he
said about you."</p>

<p>Jacqueline said: "Mr. Clydesdale has been very kind to me."</p>

<p>"Kindness to people is also a Clydesdale tradition&mdash;isn't it,
James?" said the old lady. "How kind Elena has always been to
you!"</p>

<p>The covert impudence of Aunt Hannah, and her innocent countenance,
had no significance for Jacqueline&mdash;would have had no meaning
at all except for the dark flush of anger that mounted so suddenly
to Desboro's forehead.</p>

<p>He said steadily: "The Clydesdales are very old friends, and
are naturally kind. Why you don't like them I never understood."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can understand why one of them doesn't like me,
James."</p>

<p>"Oh! I can understand why many people are not crazy about you,
Aunt Hannah," he said, composedly.</p>

<p>"Which is going some," said the old lady, with a brisk and unabashed
employment of the vernacular. Then, turning to Jacqueline: "Are
you going to give this young man some tea, my child? He requires
a tonic."</p>

<p>Jacqueline rose and seated herself at the table, thankful to
escape. Tea was soon ready; Aunt Hannah, whose capacity for browsing
was infinite, began on jam and biscuits without apology. And Jacqueline
and Desboro exchanged their first furtive glances&mdash;dismayed and
questioning on the girl's part, smilingly reassuring on Desboro's.
Aunt Hannah, looking intently into her teacup, missed nothing.</p>

<p>"Come to see me!" she said so abruptly that even Desboro started.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'I &mdash;I beg your pardon,' said Jacqueline"]</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I beg your pardon," said Jacqueline, not understanding.</p>

<p>"Come to see me in town. I've a rotten little place in a fashionable
apartment house&mdash;one of the Park Avenue kind, which they number
instead of calling it the 'Buena Vista' or the 'Hiawatha.' Will
you come?"</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>The old lady looked at her grimly:</p>

<p>"What does 'thank you' mean? Yes or no? Because I really want
you. Don't you wish to come?"</p>

<p>"I would be very glad to come&mdash;only, you know, I am in business&mdash;and
go out very little&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Except on business," added Desboro, looking Aunt Hannah unblushingly
in the eye until she wanted to pinch him. Instead, she seized
another biscuit, which Farris presented on a tray, smoking hot,
and applied jam to it vigorously. After she had consumed it, she
rose and marched around the room, passing the portraits and book
shelves in review. Half turning toward Jacqueline:</p>

<p>"I haven't been in the musty old mansion for years; that young
man never asks me. But I used to know the house. It was this sort
of house that drove me out of Westchester, and I vowed I'd marry
a New York man or nobody. Do you know, child, that there is a
sort of simpering smugness about a house like this that makes
me inclined to kick dents in the furniture?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline ventured to smile; Desboro's smile responded in sympathy.</p>

<p>"I'm going home," announced Aunt Hannah. "Good-bye, Miss Nevers.
I don't want you to drive me, James; I'd rather have your man
take me back. Besides, you've a train to catch, I understand&#11834;"
She turned and looked at Jacqueline, who had risen, and they stood
silently inspecting each other. Then, with a grim nod, as though
partly of comprehension, partly in adieu, Aunt Hannah sailed out.
Desboro tucked her in beside Vail. The latter being quite deaf,
they talked freely under his very nose.</p>

<p>"James!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear lady."</p>

<p>"You gave <em>yourself</em> away about Elena Clydesdale. Haven't
you any control over your countenance?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes. But don't do that again before <em>her</em>! The
story is a lie, anyway."</p>

<p>"So I've heard&mdash;from you. Tell me, James, do you think this little
Nevers girl dislikes me?"</p>

<p>"Do you want her to?"</p>

<p>"No. You're a very clever young one, aren't you? Really quite
an expert! Do you know, I don't think that girl would care for
what I might have to offer her. There's more to her than to most
people."</p>

<p>"How do you know? She scarcely spoke a word."</p>

<p>The old lady laughed scornfully:</p>

<p>"I know people by what they <em>don't</em> say. That's why I
know you so much better than you think I do&mdash;you and Elena Clydesdale.
And <em>I</em> don't think you're much good, James&mdash;or some of
your married friends, either."</p>

<p>She settled down among the robes, with a bright, impertinent
glance at him. He shrugged, standing bareheaded by the mud-guard,
a lithe, handsome young fellow. " &mdash;A Desboro all over,"
she thought, with a mental sniff of admiration.</p>

<p>"Are you going to speak to Miss Nevers?" she asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>"About what!"</p>

<p>"About employing me, you idiot!"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like. If she comes up here as my guest, she'll need
a gorgon."</p>

<p>"I'll gorgon you," she retorted, wrathfully.</p>

<p>"Thanks. So you'll accept the&mdash;er&mdash;job?"</p>

<p>"Of course, if she wishes. I need the money. It's purely mercenary
on my part."</p>

<p>"That's understood."</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell her I'm mercenary?"</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;<em>don't</em>&mdash;if you don't mind. Do you think
I want <em>every</em> living creature to detest me?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> don't detest you. And you have an unterrified tabby-cat
at home, haven't you?"</p>

<p>She could have boxed his ears as he leaned over and deliberately
kissed her cheek.</p>

<p>"I love you because you're so bad," he whispered; and, stepping
lightly aside, nodded to Vail to go ahead.</p>

<p>The limousine, acetylenes shining, rolled up as the other car
departed. He went back to the library and found Jacqueline pinning
on her hat.</p>

<p>"Well?" he inquired gaily.</p>

<p>"Why did you bring her, Mr. Desboro?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you like her?"</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"A Mrs. Hannah Hammerton. She knows everybody. Most people are
afraid of her. She's poor as a guinea-pig."</p>

<p>"She was beautifully gowned."</p>

<p>"She always is. Poor Aunt Hannah!"</p>

<p>"Is she your aunt?"</p>

<p>"No, she's Lindley Hammerton's aunt&mdash;a neighbour of mine. I call
her that; it made her very mad in the beginning, but she rather
likes it now. You'll go to call on her, won't you?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline turned to him, drawing on her gloves:</p>

<p>"Mr. Desboro, I don't wish to be rude; and, anyway, she will
forget that she asked me in another half-hour. Why should I go
to see her?"</p>

<p>"Because she's one species of gorgon. Now, do you understand?"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Of course. It isn't a case of pin-money with her; it's a case
of clothing, rent, and nourishment. A microscopic income, supplemented
by gifts, commissions, and odd social jobs, keeps her going. What
you and I want of her is for her to be seen at various times with
you. She'll do the rest in talking about you&mdash;'my unusually talented
young friend, Miss Nevers,' and that sort of thing. It will deceive
nobody; but you'll eventually meet some people&mdash;she knows all
kinds. The main point is that when I ask you here she'll bring
you. People will understand that you are another of her social
enterprises, for which she's paid. But it won't count against
you. It will depend on yourself entirely how you are received.
And not a soul will be able to say a word&mdash;" he laughed, "&mdash;except
that I am very devoted to the beautiful Miss Nevers&mdash;as everybody
else will be."</p>

<p>Jacqueline remained motionless for a few moments, an incomprehensible
expression on her face; then she went over to him and took one
of his hands in her gloved ones, and stood looking down at it
in silence.</p>

<p>"Well," he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>She said, still looking down at his hand lying between her own:</p>

<p>"You have behaved in the sweetest way to me&mdash;" Her voice grew
unsteady, and she turned her head sharply away.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline!" he exclaimed under his breath. "It's a broken reed
you're trusting. Don't, dear. I'm like all the others."</p>

<p>She shook her head slightly, still looking away from him. After
a short silence, her voice returned to her control again.</p>

<p>"You are very kind to me, Mr. Desboro. When a man sees that a
girl likes him&mdash;and is kind to her&mdash;it is wonderful to her."</p>

<p>He tried to take a lighter tone.</p>

<p>"It's the case of the beast born in captivity, Jacqueline. I'm
only going through the tricks convention has taught me. But every
instinct remains unaltered."</p>

<p>"That <em>is</em> civilisation, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know what it is&mdash;you wonderful little thing!"</p>

<p>He caught her hand, then encircled her waist, drawing her close.
After a moment, she dropped her big, fluffy muff on his shoulder
and hid her flushed face in the fur.</p>

<p>"Don't trust me, will you?" he said, bluntly.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Because I &mdash;I'm an unaccountable beast."</p>

<p>"We&mdash;both have to account&mdash;sometime&mdash;to somebody. Don't we?"
she said in a muffled voice.</p>

<p>"That would never check me."</p>
