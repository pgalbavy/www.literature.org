<p>Now as the days went, though Atli’s ship was bound for sea, she did not
sail, and it came about that the Earl sank ever deeper in the toils
of Swanhild. He called to mind many wise saws, but these availed him
little: for when Love rises like the sun, wisdom melts like the mists.
So at length it came to this, that on the day of Eric’s coming back,
Atli went to Asmund the Priest, and asked him for the hand of Swanhild
the Fatherless in marriage. Asmund heard and was glad, for he knew well
that things went badly between Swanhild and Gudruda, and it seemed good
to him that seas should be set between them. Nevertheless, he thought it
honest to warn the Earl that Swanhild was apart from other women.
</p>
<p>“Thou dost great honour, earl, to my foster-daughter and my house,” he
said. “Still, it behoves me to move gently in this matter. Swanhild is
fair, and she shall not go hence a wife undowered. But I must tell thee
this: that her ways are dark and secret, and strange and fiery are her
moods, and I think that she will bring evil on the man who weds her.
Now, I love thee, Atli, were it only for our youth’s sake, and thou art
not altogether fit to mate with such a maid, for age has met thee on thy
way. For, as thou wouldst say, youth draws to youth as the tide to the
shore, and falls away from eld as the wave from the rock. Think, then:
is it well that thou shouldst take her, Atli?”
</p><p>“I have thought much and overmuch,” answered the Earl, stroking his grey
beard; “but ships old and new drive before a gale.”
</p><p>“Ay, Atli, and the new ship rides, where the old one founders.”
</p><p>“A true rede, a heavy rede, Asmund; yet I am minded to sail this sea,
and, if it sink me--well, I have known fair weather! Great longing has
got hold of me, and I think the maid looks gently on me, and that things
may yet go well between us. I have many things to give such as women
love. At the least, if thou givest me thy good word, I will risk it,
Asmund: for the bold thrower sometimes wins the stake. Only I say this,
that, if Swanhild is unwilling, let there be an end of my wooing, for I
do not wish to take a bride who turns from my grey hairs.”
</p><p>Asmund said that it should be so, and they made an end of talking just
as the light faded.
</p><p>Now Asmund went out seeking Swanhild, and presently he met her near the
stead. He could not see her face, and that was well, for it was not good
to look on, but her mien was wondrous wild.
</p><p>“Where hast thou been, Swanhild?” he asked.
</p><p>“Mourning Eric Brighteyes,” she made answer.
</p><p>“It is meeter for Gudruda to mourn over Eric than for thee, for her loss
is heavy,” Asmund said sternly. “What hast thou to do with Eric?”
</p><p>“Little, or much; or all--read it as thou wilt, foster-father. Still,
all wept for are not lost, nor all who are lost wept for.”
</p><p>“Little do I know of thy dark redes,” said Asmund. “Where is Gudruda
now?”
</p><p>“High is she or low, sleeping or perchance awakened: naught reck I. She
also mourned for Eric, and we went nigh to mingling tears--near together
were brown curls and golden,” and she laughed aloud.
</p><p>“Thou art surely fey, thou evil girl!” said Asmund.
</p><p>“Ay, foster-father, fey: yet is this but the first of my feydom. Here
starts the road that I must travel, and my feet shall be red ere the
journey’s done.”
</p><p>“Leave thy dark talk,” said Asmund, “for to me it is as the wind’s
song, and listen: a good thing has befallen thee--ay, good beyond thy
deserving.”
</p><p>“Is it so? Well, I stand greatly in need of good. What is thy tidings,
foster-father?”
</p><p>“This: Atli the Earl asks thee in marriage, and he is a mighty man, well
honoured in his own land, and set higher, moreover, than I had looked
for thee.”
</p><p>“Ay,” answered Swanhild, “set like the snow above the fells, set in the
years that long are dead. Nay, foster-father, this white-bearded
dotard is no mate for me. What! shall I mix my fire with his frost, my
breathing youth with the creeping palsy of his age? Never! If Swanhild
weds she weds not so, for it is better to go maiden to the grave than
thus to shrink and wither at the touch of eld. Now is Atli’s wooing
sped, and there’s an end.”
</p><p>Asmund heard and grew wroth, for the matter seemed strange to him; nor
are maidens wont thus to put aside the word of those set over them.
</p><p>“There is no end,” he said; “I will not be answered thus by a girl who
lives upon my bounty. It is my rede that thou weddest Atli, or else thou
goest hence. I have loved thee, and for that love’s sake I have borne
thy wickedness, thy dark secret ways, and evil words; but I will be
crossed no more by thee, Swanhild.”
</p><p>“Thou wouldst drive me hence with Groa my mother, though perchance thou
hast yet more reason to hold me dear, foster-father. Fear not: I will
go--perhaps further than thou thinkest,” and once more Swanhild laughed,
and passed from him into the darkness.
</p><p>But Asmund stood looking after her. “Truly,” he said in his heart, “ill
deeds are arrows that pierce him who shot them. I have sowed evilly, and
now I reap the harvest. What means she with her talk of Gudruda and the
rest?”
</p><p>Now as he thought, he saw men and horses draw near, and one man, whose
helm gleamed in the moonlight, bore something in his arms.
</p><p>“Who passes?” he called.
</p><p>“Eric Brighteyes, Skallagrim Lambstail, and Gudruda, Asmund’s daughter,”
 answered a voice; “who art thou?”
</p><p>Then Asmund the Priest sprang forward, most glad at heart, for he never
thought to see Eric again.
</p><p>“Welcome, and thrice welcome art thou, Eric,” he cried; “for, know, we
deemed thee dead.”
</p><p>“I have lately gone near to death, lord,” said Eric, for he knew the
voice; “but I am hale and whole, though somewhat weary.”
</p><p>“What has come to pass, then?” asked Asmund, “and why holdest thou
Gudruda in thy arms? Is the maid dead?”
</p><p>“Nay, she does but swoon. See, even now she stirs,” and as he spake
Gudruda awoke, shuddering, and with a little cry threw her arms about
the neck of Eric.
</p><p>He set her down and comforted her, then once more turned to Asmund:
</p><p>“Three things have come about,” he said. “First, I have slain one
Baresark, and won another to be my thrall, and for him I crave thy
peace, for he has served me well. Next, we two were set upon by Ospakar
Blacktooth and his fellowship, and, fighting for our hands, have wounded
Ospakar, slain Mord his son, and six other men of his following.”
</p><p>“That is good news and bad,” said Asmund, “since Ospakar will ask a
great weregild[*] for these men, and thou wilt be outlawed, Eric.”
</p><p>[*] The penalty for manslaying.
</p><p>“That may happen, lord. There is time enough to think of it. Now there
are other tidings to tell. Coming to the head of Goldfoss I found
Gudruda, my betrothed, mourning my death, and spoke with her. Afterwards
I left her, and presently returned again, to see her hanging over the
gulf, and Swanhild hurling rocks upon her to crush her.”
</p><p>“These are tidings in truth,” said Asmund--“such tidings as my heart
feared! Is this true, Gudruda?”
</p><p>“It is true, my father,” answered Gudruda, trembling. “As I sat on the
brink of Goldfoss, Swanhild crept behind me and thrust me into the gulf.
There I clung above the waters, and she brought a rock to hurl upon me,
when suddenly I saw Eric’s face, and after that my mind left me and I
can tell no more.”
</p><p>Now Asmund grew as one mad. He plucked at his beard and stamped on the
ground. “Maid though she be,” he cried, “yet shall Swanhild’s back be
broken on the Stone of Doom for a witch and a murderess, and her body
hurled into the pool of faithless women, and the earth will be well rid
of her!”
</p><p>Now Gudruda looked up and smiled: “It would be ill to wreak such a
vengeance on her, father,” she said; “and this would also bring the
greatest shame on thee, and all our house. I am saved, by the mercy
of the Gods and the might of Eric’s arm, and this is my counsel: that
nothing be told of this tale, but that Swanhild be sent away where she
can harm us no more.”
</p><p>“She must be sent to the grave, then,” said Asmund, and fell to
thinking. Presently he spoke again: “Bid yon man fall back, I would
speak with you twain,” and Skallagrim went grumbling.
</p><p>“Hearken now, Eric and Gudruda: only an hour ago hath Atli the Good
asked Swanhild of me in marriage. But now I met Swanhild here, and her
mien was wild. Still, I spoke of the matter to her, and she would have
none of it. Now, this is my counsel: that choice be given to Swanhild,
either that she go hence Atli’s wife, or take her trial in the
Doom-ring.”
</p><p>“That will be bad for the Earl then,” said Eric. “Methinks he is too
good a man to be played on thus.”
</p><p>“<u>Bairn first, then friend</u>,” answered Asmund.
</p><p>“Now I will tell thee something that, till this hour, I have hidden from
all, for it is my shame. This Swanhild is my daughter, and therefore I
have loved her and put away her evil deeds, and she is half-sister
to thee, Gudruda. See, then, how sore is my straight, who must avenge
daughter upon daughter.”
</p><p>“Knows thy son Björn of this?” asked Eric.
</p><p>“None knew it till this hour, except Groa and I.”
</p><p>“Yet I have feared it long, father,” said Gudruda, “and therefore I have
also borne with Swanhild, though she hates me much and has striven hard
to draw my betrothed from me. Now thou canst only take one counsel,
and it is: to give choice to Swanhild of these two things, though it is
unworthy that Atli should be deceived, and at the best little good can
come of it.”
</p><p>“Yet it must be done, for honour is often slain of heavy need,” said
Asmund. “But we must first swear this Baresark thrall of thine, though
little faith lives in Baresark’s breast.”
</p><p>Now Eric called to Skallagrim and charged him strictly that he should
tell nothing of Swanhild, and of the wolf that he saw by her, and of how
Gudruda was found hanging over the gulf.
</p><p>“Fear not,” growled the Baresark, “my tongue is now my master’s. What
is it to me if women do their wickedness one on another? Let them
work magic, hate and slay by stealth, so shall evil be lessened in the
world.”
</p><p>“Peace!” said Eric; “if anything of this passes thy lips thou art no
longer a thrall of mine, and I give thee up to the men of thy quarter.”
</p><p>“And I cleave that wolf’s head of thine down to thy hawk’s eyes; but,
otherwise, I give thee peace, and will hold thee from harm, wood-dweller
as thou art,” said Asmund.
</p><p>The Baresark laughed: “My hands will hold my head against ten such
mannikins as thou art, Priest. There was never but one man who might
overcome me in fair fight and there he stands, and his bidding is my
law. So waste no words and make not niddering threats against greater
folk,” and he slouched back to his horse.
</p><p>“A mighty man and a rough,” said Asmund, looking after him; “I like his
looks little.”
</p><p>“Natheless a strong in battle,” quoth Eric; “had he not been at my back
some six hours gone, by now the ravens had torn out these eyes of mine.
Therefore, for my sake, bear with him.”
</p><p>Asmund said it should be so, and then they passed on to the stead.
</p><p>Here Eric stripped off his harness, washed, and bound up his wounds.
Then, followed by Skallagrim, axe in hand, he came into the hall as men
made ready to sit at meat. Now the tale of the mighty deeds that he
had done, except that of the saving of Gudruda, had gone abroad, and as
Brighteyes came all men rose and with one voice shouted till the roof of
the great hall rocked:
</p><p>“_Welcome, Eric Brighteyes, thou glory of the south!_”
</p><p>Only Björn, Asmund’s son, bit his hand, and did not shout, for he hated
Eric because of the fame that he had won.
</p><p>Brighteyes stood still till the clamour died, then said:
</p><p>“Much noise for little deeds, brethren. It is true that I overthrew the
Mosfell Baresarks. See, here is one,” and he turned to Skallagrim; “I
strangled him in my arms on Mosfell’s brink, and that was something of
a deed. Then he swore fealty to me, and we are blood-brethren now, and
therefore I ask peace for him, comrades--even from those whom he has
wronged or whose kin he has slain. I know this, that when thereafter we
stood back to back and met the company of Ospakar Blacktooth, who
came to slay us--ay, and Asmund also, and bear away Gudruda to be his
wife--he warred right gallantly, till seven of their band lay stiff on
Horse-Head Heights, overthrown of us, and among them Mord, Blacktooth’s
son; and Ospakar himself went thence sore smitten of this Skallagrim.
Therefore, for my sake, do no harm to this man who was Baresark, but now
is my thrall; and, moreover, I beg the aid and friendship of all men of
this quarter in those suits that will be laid against me at the Althing
for these slayings, which I hereby give out as done by my hand, and by
the hand of Skallagrim Lambstail, the Baresark.”
</p><p>At these words all men shouted again; but Atli the Earl sprang from the
high seat where Asmund had placed him, and, coming to Eric, kissed him,
and, drawing a gold chain from his neck, flung it about the neck of
Eric, crying:
</p><p>“Thou art a glorious man, Eric Brighteyes. I thought the world had no
more of such a breed. Listen to my bidding: come thou to the earldom in
Orkneys and be a son to me, and I will give thee all good gifts, and,
when I die, thou shalt sit in my seat after me.”
</p><p>But Eric thought of Swanhild, who must go from Iceland as wife to Atli,
and answered:
</p><p>“Thou doest me great honour, Earl, but this may not be. Where the fir
is planted, there it must grow and fall. Iceland I love, and I will stay
here among my own people till I am driven away.”
</p><p>“That may well happen, then,” said Atli, “for be sure Ospakar and his
kin will not let the matter of these slayings rest, and I think that
it will not avail thee much that thou smotest for thine own hand. Then,
come thou and be my man.”
</p><p>“Where the Norns lead there I must follow,” said Eric, and sat down to
meat. Skallagrim sat down also at the side-bench; but men shrank from
him, and he glowered on them in answer.
</p><p>Presently Gudruda entered, and she seemed pale and faint.
</p><p>When he had done eating, Eric drew Gudruda on to his knee, and she sat
there, resting her golden head upon his breast. But Swanhild did not
come into the hall, though ever Earl Atli sought her dark face and
lovely eyes of blue, and he wondered greatly how his wooing had sped.
Still, at this time he spoke no more of it to Asmund.
</p><p>Now Skallagrim drank much ale, and glared about him fiercely; for he
had this fault, that at times he was drunken. In front of him were two
thralls of Asmund’s; they were brothers, and large-made men, and they
watched Asmund’s sheep upon the fells in winter. These two also grew
drunk and jeered at Skallagrim, asking him what atonement he would make
for those ewes of Asmund’s that he had stolen last Yule, and how it came
to pass that he, a Baresark, had been overthrown of an unarmed man.
</p><p>Skallagrim bore their gibes for a space as he drank on, but suddenly
he rose and rushed at them, and, seizing a man’s throat in either hand,
thrust them to the ground beneath him and nearly choked them there.
</p><p>Then Eric ran down the hall, and, putting out his strength, tore the
Baresark from them.
</p><p>“This then is thy peacefulness, thou wolf!” Eric cried. “Thou art
drunk!”
</p><p>“Ay,” growled Skallagrim, “ale is many a man’s doom.”
</p><p>“Have a care that it is not thine and mine, then!” said Eric. “Go,
sleep; and know that, if I see thee thus once more, I see thee not
again.”
</p>
<p>But after this men jeered no more at Skallagrim Lambstail, Eric’s
thrall.
