<p>Se√±orita Estacardo drew her chair beside the snowy couch and
faced her friend, who did the same regarding her. Reaching out
her hand, she lovingly inclosed that of Miss Starland, just as
she used to do in the dear old days at the Seminary. The American
young woman leaned forward and kissed the dark cheek, and for
a minute they sat without speaking. Then with the black eyes gazing
into the blue ones, the owner of the former said in a voice, scarcely
above a whisper:</p>

<p>"Warrenia, I do not understand it."</p>

<p>"And, Manuela, I'm afraid I do."</p>

<p>"Tell me, then."</p>

<p>"Surely you have a suspicion. Why should we mince matters? He
has forgotten his pledge to you and is more resolute than before."</p>

<p>"I fear you are right. The thought has been growing upon me ever
since we left the boat. Need I tell you that you are no more shocked
and grieved than I?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing that mind can conceive will ever throw a shadow
upon your loyalty and goodness. I have known you too long and
too well for me to have room for such an injustice."</p>

<p>The other's answer to this was to throw her arms impulsively
around the neck of her friend and to kiss her again and again,
murmuring:</p>

<p>"Thank you and bless you! I can never be the angel that you are
and I would gladly die for you."</p>

<p>There were no tears in the eyes of either; they were too brave
for that. It was the American who spoke when they became more
composed:</p>

<p>"We are agreed upon the one thing, and, therefore, must be right.
But you can aid me to clear up several points that trouble me.
Why did General Yozarro put us ashore and send us here?"</p>

<p>"I suspect his reason for that. You know he has spoken of sending
us to the Castle to spend a few days of the hot weather. He had
the preparations made and this room fitted for us. We should have
come here today, but for your change of mind. You demanded to
go to Zalapata and he could not refuse. His plan that you should
come to the Castle was not changed, but he had to seem to defer
to your wishes. To have come directly here would have been a plain
disregard of them, so he spent the day in planning this deception,
and carried it out without the least difficulty."</p>

<p>"Must he not have seen that when we went ashore and found the
escort waiting with ponies, we should see that the whole thing
was pre-arranged? In no other way could it have come about."</p>

<p>"True, but when we understood it all it would be too late to
do us any good."</p>

<p>"What of his story that General Bambos had sent a boat up the
river to attack Atlamalco?"</p>

<p>"It was pure invention."</p>

<p>"We certainly have heard no sounds of a battle between the boats."</p>

<p>"Because there has been none. He saw no more of a hostile fleet
than did we, for none exists; he has gone back to Atlamalco."</p>

<p>"I suppose he will be here tomorrow with some cunning falsehood
to explain why the conflict did not take place. He will say he
gave chase to the enemy, who fled without firing a shot, but how
can I pretend to believe him?"</p>

<p>"There is no call for any such pretense. If he tries further
deception, ask him to make clear how the two soldiers were waiting
on shore with horses. If he makes a reasonable explanation of
that, he has more ingenuity than I ever supposed."</p>

<p>"We can have no trouble in convicting him, but, Manuela, my dread
is that it will not help matters, but rather make them worse.
I must confess that his conduct is beyond my comprehension."</p>

<p>"It is not beyond mine."</p>

<p>"What is your theory?"</p>

<p>"It is not a theory but a fact. My uncle is so hopelessly in
love with you that his ordinary common sense has left him."</p>

<p>"It may be as you say, but much remains that is unaccountable
to me."</p>

<p>"I see little that is not made clear by what I have said. You
and I know that when a man becomes as blindly infatuated as he,
his conduct violates reason and the simplest prudence and he does
things that would be absurd in a child. Frightened by the prospect
of losing you, he gave all his thoughts and energies to preventing
it. This was the only method that suggested itself, and we cannot
deny, my dear friend, that it has been quite successful up to
this point."</p>

<p>"But of what possible avail can it be to him? Idiot that he is,
he must know that this situation can last but a short time. Jack
will find it out within twenty-four hours, and General Yozarro
must know what will happen <em>then</em>."</p>

<p>"Dearest Warrenia, you do not see as much in this as I. What
stronger proof can I give of my love to you than to say that we
must separate and you must leave this part of the world with the
least possible delay? Your own loveliness is your peril. It ought
to be your greatest protection, but it is not. I would that your
yacht was in the river this very hour and that we could make haste
to it, for you are in greater danger than you suspect."</p>
