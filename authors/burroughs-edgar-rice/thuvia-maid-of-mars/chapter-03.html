The day following the coming of Vas Kor to the
palace of the Prince of Helium great excitement reigned
throughout the twin cities, reaching its climax in the
palace of Carthoris.  Word had come of the abduction of
Thuvia of Ptarth from her father's court, and with it the
veiled hint that the Prince of Helium might be suspected
of considerable knowledge of the act and the whereabouts
of the princess.
<P>
In the council chamber of John Carter, Warlord of
Mars, was Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium; Mors Kajak,
his son, Jed of Lesser Helium; Carthoris, and a score of
the great nobles of the empire.
<P>
"There must be no war between Ptarth and Helium, my son,"
said John Carter.  "That you are innocent of the charge
that has been placed against you by insinuation, we well know;
but Thuvan Dihn must know it well, too.
<P>
"There is but one who may convince him, and that
one be you.  You must hasten at once to the court of
Ptarth, and by your presence there as well as by your
words assure him that his suspicions are groundless. 
Bear with you the authority of the Warlord of Barsoom,
and of the Jeddak of Helium to offer every resource of the
allied powers to assist Thuvan Dihn to recover his daughter
and punish her abductors, whomsoever they may be.
<P>
"Go!  I know that I do not need to urge upon you the
necessity for haste."
<P>
Carthoris left the council chamber, and hastened to his palace.
<P>
Here slaves were busy in a moment setting things to
rights for the departure of their master.  Several worked
about the swift flier that would bear the Prince of Helium
rapidly toward Ptarth.
<P>
At last all was done.  But two armed slaves remained
on guard.  The setting sun hung low above the horizon. 
In a moment darkness would envelop all.
<P>
One of the guardsmen, a giant of a fellow across whose
right cheek there ran a thin scar from temple to mouth,
approached his companion.  His gaze was directed beyond
and above his comrade.  When he had come quite close he spoke.
<P>
"What strange craft is that?" he asked.
<P>
The other turned about quickly to gaze heavenward. 
Scarce was his back turned toward the giant than the
short-sword of the latter was plunged beneath his left
shoulder blade, straight through his heart.
<P>
Voiceless, the soldier sank in his tracks--stone dead. 
Quickly the murderer dragged the corpse into the black
shadows within the hangar.  Then he returned to the flier.
<P>
Drawing a cunningly wrought key from his pocket-pouch,
he removed the cover of the right-hand dial of the
controlling destination compass.  For a moment he
studied the construction of the mechanism beneath.
Then he returned the dial to its place, set the pointer,
and removed it again to note the resultant change in the
position of the parts affected by the act.
<P>
A smile crossed his lips.  With a pair of cutters he
snipped off the projection which extended through the
dial from the external pointer--now the latter might be
moved to any point upon the dial without affecting the
mechanism below.  In other words, the eastern hemisphere
dial was useless.
<P>
Now he turned his attention to the western dial.
This he set upon a certain point.  Afterward he removed
the cover of this dial also, and with keen tool cut the
steel finger from the under side of the pointer.
<P>
As quickly as possible he replaced the second dial
cover, and resumed his place on guard.  To all intents
and purposes the compass was as efficient as before; but,
as a matter of fact, the moving of the pointers upon
the dials resulted now in no corresponding shift of the
mechanism beneath--and the device was set, immovably,
upon a destination of the slave's own choosing.
<P>
Presently came Carthoris, accompanied by but a handful
of his gentlemen.  He cast but a casual glance upon the
single slave who stood guard.  The fellow's thin, cruel
lips, and the sword-cut that ran from temple to mouth
aroused the suggestion of an unpleasant memory within him.
He wondered where Saran Tal had found the man-- then the
matter faded from his thoughts, and in another moment
the Prince of Helium was laughing and chatting with
his companions, though below the surface his heart
was cold with dread, for what contingencies
confronted Thuvia of Ptarth he could not even guess.
<P>
First to his mind, naturally, had sprung the thought
that Astok of Dusar had stolen the fair Ptarthian; but
almost simultaneously with the report of the abduction had
come news of the great fetes at Dusar in honour of the
return of the jeddak's son to the court of his father.
<P>
It could not have been he, thought Carthoris, for on the
very night that Thuvia was taken Astok had been in
Dusar, and yet--
<P>
He entered the flier, exchanging casual remarks with his
companions as he unlocked the mechanism of the compass
and set the pointer upon the capital city of Ptarth.
<P>
With a word of farewell he touched the button which
controlled the repulsive rays, and as the flier rose lightly
into the air, the engine purred in answer to the touch of
his finger upon a second button, the propellers whirred
as his hand drew back the speed lever, and Carthoris,
Prince of Helium, was off into the gorgeous Martian night
beneath the hurtling moons and the million stars.
<P>
Scarce had the flier found its speed ere the man,
wrapping his sleeping silks and furs about him,
stretched at full length upon the narrow deck to sleep.
<P>
But sleep did not come at once at his bidding.
<P>
Instead, his thoughts ran riot in his brain, driving sleep away.
He recalled the words of Thuvia of Ptarth, words that had half
assured him that she loved him; for when he had asked her if she
loved Kulan Tith, she had answered only that she was promised to him.
<P>
Now he saw that her reply was open to more than a
single construction.  It might, of course, mean that
she did not love Kulan Tith; and so, by inference,
be taken to mean that she loved another.
<P>
But what assurance was there that the other was Carthoris of Helium?
<P>
The more he thought upon it the more positive he
became that not only was there no assurance in her words
that she loved him, but none either in any act of hers. 
No, the fact was, she did not love him.  She loved another. 
She had not been abducted--she had fled willingly with her lover.
<P>
With such pleasant thoughts filling him alternately with
despair and rage, Carthoris at last dropped into the
sleep of utter mental exhaustion.
<P>
The breaking of the sudden dawn found him still asleep.
His flier was rushing swiftly above a barren, ochre
plain--the world-old bottom of a long-dead Martian sea.
<P>
In the distance rose low hills.  Toward these the craft
was headed.  As it approached them, a great promontory
might have been seen from its deck, stretching out into
what had once been a mighty ocean, and circling back
once more to enclose the forgotten harbour of a forgotten
city, which still stretched back from its deserted quays,
an imposing pile of wondrous architecture of a long-dead past.
<P>
The countless dismal windows, vacant and forlorn,
stared, sightless, from their marble walls; the whole
sad city taking on the semblance of scattered mounds of
dead men's sun-bleached skulls--the casements having the
appearance of eyeless sockets, the portals, grinning jaws.
<P>
Closer came the flier, but now its speed was
diminishing--yet this was not Ptarth.
<P>
Above the central plaza it stopped, slowly settling Marsward.
Within a hundred yards of the ground it came to rest,
floating gently in the light air, and at the same instant
an alarm sounded at the sleeper's ear.
<P>
Carthoris sprang to his feet.  Below him he looked to
see the teeming metropolis of Ptarth.  Beside him,
already, there should have been an air patrol.
<P>
He gazed about in bewildered astonishment.  There indeed
was a great city, but it was not Ptarth.  No multitudes
surged through its broad avenues.  No signs of life
broke the dead monotony of its deserted roof tops.
No gorgeous silks, no priceless furs lent life and
colour to the cold marble and the gleaming ersite.
<P>
No patrol boat lay ready with its familiar challenge. 
Silent and empty lay the great city--empty and silent
the surrounding air.
<P>
What had happened?
<P>
Carthoris examined the dial of his compass.  The pointer
was set upon Ptarth.  Could the creature of his genius
have thus betrayed him?  He would not believe it.
<P>
Quickly he unlocked the cover, turning it back upon
its hinge.  A single glance showed him the truth, or at
least a part of it--the steel projection that communicated
the movement of the pointer upon the dial to the heart
of the mechanism beneath had been severed.
<P>
Who could have done the thing--and why?
<P>
Carthoris could not hazard even a faint guess.  But the
thing now was to learn in what portion of the world he
was, and then take up his interrupted journey once more.
<P>
If it had been the purpose of some enemy to delay him,
he had succeeded well, thought Carthoris, as he
unlocked the cover of the second dial the first having
shown that its pointer had not been set at all.
<P>
Beneath the second dial he found the steel pin severed
as in the other, but the controlling mechanism had first
been set for a point upon the western hemisphere.
<P>
He had just time to judge his location roughly at
some place south-west of Helium, and at a considerable
distance from the twin cities, when he was startled by a
woman's scream beneath him.
<P>
Leaning over the side of the flier, he saw what appeared
to be a red woman being dragged across the plaza by a
huge green warrior--one of those fierce, cruel denizens
of the dead sea-bottoms and deserted cities of dying Mars.
<P>
Carthoris waited to see no more.  Reaching for the
control board, he sent his craft racing plummet-like
toward the ground.
<P>
The green man was hurrying his captive toward a
huge thoat that browsed upon the ochre vegetation of
the once scarlet-gorgeous plaza.  At the same instant a
dozen red warriors leaped from the entrance of a nearby
ersite palace, pursuing the abductor with naked swords
and shouts of rageful warning.
<P>
Once the woman turned her face upward toward the falling flier,
and in the single swift glance Carthoris saw that it was
Thuvia of Ptarth!
