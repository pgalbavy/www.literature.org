<p>Happily for Mary Datchet she returned to the office to find that
by some obscure Parliamentary maneuver the vote had once more
slipped beyond the attainment of women. Mrs. Seal was in a condition
bordering upon frenzy. The duplicity of Ministers, the treachery
of mankind, the insult to womanhood, the setback to civilization,
the ruin of her life’s work, the feelings of her father’s daughter&mdash;all
these topics were discussed in turn, and the office was littered
with newspaper cuttings branded with the blue, if ambiguous, marks
of her displeasure. She confessed herself at fault in her estimate
of human nature.</p>

<p>"The simple elementary acts of justice," she said, waving her
hand towards the window, and indicating the foot-passengers and
omnibuses then passing down the far side of Russell Square, "are
as far beyond them as they ever were. We can only look upon ourselves,
Mary, as pioneers in a wilderness. We can only go on patiently
putting the truth before them. It isn’t <em>THEM," </em>she continued,
taking heart from her sight of the traffic, "it’s their leaders.
It’s those gentlemen sitting in Parliament and drawing four hundred
a year of the people’s money. If we had to put our case to the
people, we should soon have justice done to us. I have always
believed in the people, and I do so still. But&mdash;" She shook her
head and implied that she would give them one more chance, and
if they didn’t take advantage of that she couldn’t answer for
the consequences.</p>

<p>Mr. Clacton’s attitude was more philosophical and better supported
by statistics. He came into the room after Mrs. Seal’s outburst
and pointed out, with historical illustrations, that such reverses
had happened in every political campaign of any importance. If
anything, his spirits were improved by the disaster. The enemy,
he said, had taken the offensive; and it was now up to the Society
to outwit the enemy. He gave Mary to understand that he had taken
the measure of their cunning, and had already bent his mind to
the task which, so far as she could make out, depended solely
upon him. It depended, so she came to think, when invited into
his room for a private conference, upon a systematic revision
of the card-index, upon the issue of certain new lemon-colored
leaflets, in which the facts were marshaled once more in a very
striking way, and upon a large scale map of England dotted with
little pins tufted with differently colored plumes of hair according
to their geographical position. Each district, under the new system,
had its flag, its bottle of ink, its sheaf of documents tabulated
and filed for reference in a drawer, so that by looking under
M or S, as the case might be, you had all the facts with respect
to the Suffrage organizations of that county at your fingers’
ends. This would require a great deal of work, of course.</p>

<p>"We must try to consider ourselves rather in the light of a telephone
exchange&mdash;for the exchange of ideas, Miss Datchet," he said; and
taking pleasure in his image, he continued it. "We should consider
ourselves the center of an enormous system of wires, connecting
us up with every district of the country. We must have our fingers
upon the pulse of the community; we want to know what people all
over England are thinking; we want to put them in the way of thinking
rightly." The system, of course, was only roughly sketched so
far&mdash;jotted down, in fact, during the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>"When you ought to have been taking a rest, Mr. Clacton," said
Mary dutifully, but her tone was flat and tired.</p>

<p>"We learn to do without holidays, Miss Datchet," said Mr. Clacton,
with a spark of satisfaction in his eye.</p>

<p>He wished particularly to have her opinion of the lemon-colored
leaflet. According to his plan, it was to be distributed in immense
quantities immediately, in order to stimulate and generate, "to
generate and stimulate," he repeated, "right thoughts in the country
before the meeting of Parliament."</p>

<p>"We have to take the enemy by surprise," he said. "They don’t
let the grass grow under their feet. Have you seen Bingham’s address
to his constituents? That’s a hint of the sort of thing we’ve
got to meet, Miss Datchet."</p>

<p>He handed her a great bundle of newspaper cuttings, and, begging
her to give him her views upon the yellow leaflet before lunch-time,
he turned with alacrity to his different sheets of paper and his
different bottles of ink.</p>

<p>Mary shut the door, laid the documents upon her table, and sank
her head on her hands. Her brain was curiously empty of any thought.
She listened, as if, perhaps, by listening she would become merged
again in the atmosphere of the office. From the next room came
the rapid spasmodic sounds of Mrs. Seal’s erratic typewriting;
she, doubtless, was already hard at work helping the people of
England, as Mr. Clacton put it, to think rightly; "generating
and stimulating," those were his words. She was striking a blow
against the enemy, no doubt, who didn’t let the grass grow beneath
their feet. Mr. Clacton’s words repeated themselves accurately
in her brain. She pushed the papers wearily over to the farther
side of the table. It was no use, though; something or other had
happened to her brain&mdash;a change of focus so that near things were
indistinct again. The same thing had happened to her once before,
she remembered, after she had met Ralph in the gardens of Lincoln’s
Inn Fields; she had spent the whole of a committee meeting in
thinking about sparrows and colors, until, almost at the end of
the meeting, her old convictions had all come back to her. But
they had only come back, she thought with scorn at her feebleness,
because she wanted to use them to fight against Ralph. They weren’t,
rightly speaking, convictions at all. She could not see the world
divided into separate compartments of good people and bad people,
any more than she could believe so implicitly in the rightness
of her own thought as to wish to bring the population of the British
Isles into agreement with it. She looked at the lemon-colored
leaflet, and thought almost enviously of the faith which could
find comfort in the issue of such documents; for herself she would
be content to remain silent for ever if a share of personal happiness
were granted her. She read Mr. Clacton’s statement with a curious
division of judgment, noting its weak and pompous verbosity on
the one hand, and, at the same time, feeling that faith, faith
in an illusion, perhaps, but, at any rate, faith in something,
was of all gifts the most to be envied. An illusion it was, no
doubt. She looked curiously round her at the furniture of the
office, at the machinery in which she had taken so much pride,
and marveled to think that once the copying-presses, the card-index,
the files of documents, had all been shrouded, wrapped in some
mist which gave them a unity and a general dignity and purpose
independently of their separate significance. The ugly cumbersomeness
of the furniture alone impressed her now. Her attitude had become
very lax and despondent when the typewriter stopped in the next
room. Mary immediately drew up to the table, laid hands on an
unopened envelope, and adopted an expression which might hide
her state of mind from Mrs. Seal. Some instinct of decency required
that she should not allow Mrs. Seal to see her face. Shading her
eyes with her fingers, she watched Mrs. Seal pull out one drawer
after another in her search for some envelope or leaflet. She
was tempted to drop her fingers and exclaim:</p>

<p>"Do sit down, Sally, and tell me how you manage it&mdash;how you manage,
that is, to bustle about with perfect confidence in the necessity
of your own activities, which to me seem as futile as the buzzing
of a belated blue-bottle." She said nothing of the kind, however,
and the presence of industry which she preserved so long as Mrs.
Seal was in the room served to set her brain in motion, so that
she dispatched her morning’s work much as usual. At one o’clock
she was surprised to find how efficiently she had dealt with the
morning. As she put her hat on she determined to lunch at a shop
in the Strand, so as to set that other piece of mechanism, her
body, into action. With a brain working and a body working one
could keep step with the crowd and never be found out for the
hollow machine, lacking the essential thing, that one was conscious
of being.</p>

<p>She considered her case as she walked down the Charing Cross
Road. She put to herself a series of questions. Would she mind,
for example, if the wheels of that motor-omnibus passed over her
and crushed her to death? No, not in the least; or an adventure
with that disagreeable-looking man hanging about the entrance
of the Tube station? No; she could not conceive fear or excitement.
Did suffering in any form appall her? No, suffering was neither
good nor bad. And this essential thing? In the eyes of every single
person she detected a flame; as if a spark in the brain ignited
spontaneously at contact with the things they met and drove them
on. The young women looking into the milliners’ windows had that
look in their eyes; and elderly men turning over books in the
second-hand book-shops, and eagerly waiting to hear what the price
was&mdash;the very lowest price&mdash;they had it, too. But she cared nothing
at all for clothes or for money either. Books she shrank from,
for they were connected too closely with Ralph. She kept on her
way resolutely through the crowd of people, among whom she was
so much of an alien, feeling them cleave and give way before her.</p>

<p>Strange thoughts are bred in passing through crowded streets
should the passenger, by chance, have no exact destination in
front of him, much as the mind shapes all kinds of forms, solutions,
images when listening inattentively to music. From an acute consciousness
of herself as an individual, Mary passed to a conception of the
scheme of things in which, as a human being, she must have her
share. She half held a vision; the vision shaped and dwindled.
She wished she had a pencil and a piece of paper to help her to
give a form to this conception which composed itself as she walked
down the Charing Cross Road. But if she talked to any one, the
conception might escape her. Her vision seemed to lay out the
lines of her life until death in a way which satisfied her sense
of harmony. It only needed a persistent effort of thought, stimulated
in this strange way by the crowd and the noise, to climb the crest
of existence and see it all laid out once and for ever. Already
her suffering as an individual was left behind her. Of this process,
which was to her so full of effort, which comprised infinitely
swift and full passages of thought, leading from one crest to
another, as she shaped her conception of life in this world, only
two articulate words escaped her, muttered beneath her breath&mdash;"Not
happiness&mdash;not happiness."</p>

<p>She sat down on a seat opposite the statue of one of London’s
heroes upon the Embankment, and spoke the words aloud. To her
they represented the rare flower or splinter of rock brought down
by a climber in proof that he has stood for a moment, at least,
upon the highest peak of the mountain. She had been up there and
seen the world spread to the horizon. It was now necessary to
alter her course to some extent, according to her new resolve.
Her post should be in one of those exposed and desolate stations
which are shunned naturally by happy people. She arranged the
details of the new plan in her mind, not without a grim satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Now," she said to herself, rising from her seat, "I’ll think
of Ralph."</p>

<p>Where was he to be placed in the new scale of life? Her exalted
mood seemed to make it safe to handle the question. But she was
dismayed to find how quickly her passions leapt forward the moment
she sanctioned this line of thought. Now she was identified with
him and rethought his thoughts with complete self-surrender; now,
with a sudden cleavage of spirit, she turned upon him and denounced
him for his cruelty.</p>

<p>"But I refuse &mdash;I refuse to hate any one," she said aloud;
chose the moment to cross the road with circumspection, and ten
minutes later lunched in the Strand, cutting her meat firmly into
small pieces, but giving her fellow-diners no further cause to
judge her eccentric. Her soliloquy crystallized itself into little
fragmentary phrases emerging suddenly from the turbulence of her
thought, particularly when she had to exert herself in any way,
either to move, to count money, or to choose a turning. "To know
the truth&mdash;to accept without bitterness"&mdash;those, perhaps, were
the most articulate of her utterances, for no one could have made
head or tail of the queer gibberish murmured in front of the statue
of Francis, Duke of Bedford, save that the name of Ralph occurred
frequently in very strange connections, as if, having spoken it,
she wished, superstitiously, to cancel it by adding some other
word that robbed the sentence with his name in it of any meaning.</p>

<p>Those champions of the cause of women, Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal,
did not perceive anything strange in Mary’s behavior, save that
she was almost half an hour later than usual in coming back to
the office. Happily, their own affairs kept them busy, and she
was free from their inspection. If they had surprised her they
would have found her lost, apparently, in admiration of the large
hotel across the square, for, after writing a few words, her pen
rested upon the paper, and her mind pursued its own journey among
the sun-blazoned windows and the drifts of purplish smoke which
formed her view. And, indeed, this background was by no means
out of keeping with her thoughts. She saw to the remote spaces
behind the strife of the foreground, enabled now to gaze there,
since she had renounced her own demands, privileged to see the
larger view, to share the vast desires and sufferings of the mass
of mankind. She had been too lately and too roughly mastered by
facts to take an easy pleasure in the relief of renunciation;
such satisfaction as she felt came only from the discovery that,
having renounced everything that made life happy, easy, splendid,
individual, there remained a hard reality, unimpaired by one’s
personal adventures, remote as the stars, unquenchable as they
are.</p>

<p>While Mary Datchet was undergoing this curious transformation
from the particular to the universal, Mrs. Seal remembered her
duties with regard to the kettle and the gas-fire. She was a little
surprised to find that Mary had drawn her chair to the window,
and, having lit the gas, she raised herself from a stooping posture
and looked at her. The most obvious reason for such an attitude
in a secretary was some kind of indisposition. But Mary, rousing
herself with an effort, denied that she was indisposed.</p>

<p>"I’m frightfully lazy this afternoon," she added, with a glance
at her table. "You must really get another secretary, Sally."</p>

<p>The words were meant to be taken lightly, but something in the
tone of them roused a jealous fear which was always dormant in
Mrs. Seal’s breast. She was terribly afraid that one of these
days Mary, the young woman who typified so many rather sentimental
and enthusiastic ideas, who had some sort of visionary existence
in white with a sheaf of lilies in her hand, would announce, in
a jaunty way, that she was about to be married.</p>

<p>"You don’t mean that you’re going to leave us?" she said.</p>

<p>"I’ve not made up my mind about anything," said Mary&mdash;a remark
which could be taken as a generalization.</p>

<p>Mrs. Seal got the teacups out of the cupboard and set them on
the table.</p>

<p>"You’re not going to be married, are you?" she asked, pronouncing
the words with nervous speed.</p>

<p>"Why are you asking such absurd questions this afternoon, Sally?"
Mary asked, not very steadily. "Must we all get married?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Seal emitted a most peculiar chuckle. She seemed for one
moment to acknowledge the terrible side of life which is concerned
with the emotions, the private lives, of the sexes, and then to
sheer off from it with all possible speed into the shades of her
own shivering virginity. She was made so uncomfortable by the
turn the conversation had taken, that she plunged her head into
the cupboard, and endeavored to abstract some very obscure piece
of china.</p>

<p>"We have our work," she said, withdrawing her head, displaying
cheeks more than usually crimson, and placing a jam-pot emphatically
upon the table. But, for the moment, she was unable to launch
herself upon one of those enthusiastic, but inconsequent, tirades
upon liberty, democracy, the rights of the people, and the iniquities
of the Government, in which she delighted. Some memory from her
own past or from the past of her sex rose to her mind and kept
her abashed. She glanced furtively at Mary, who still sat by the
window with her arm upon the sill. She noticed how young she was
and full of the promise of womanhood. The sight made her so uneasy
that she fidgeted the cups upon their saucers.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;enough work to last a lifetime," said Mary, as if concluding
some passage of thought.</p>

<p>Mrs. Seal brightened at once. She lamented her lack of scientific
training, and her deficiency in the processes of logic, but she
set her mind to work at once to make the prospects of the cause
appear as alluring and important as she could. She delivered herself
of an harangue in which she asked a great many rhetorical questions
and answered them with a little bang of one fist upon another.</p>

<p>"To last a lifetime? My dear child, it will last all our lifetimes.
As one falls another steps into the breach. My father, in his
generation, a pioneer &mdash;I, coming after him, do my little
best. What, alas! can one do more? And now it’s you young women&mdash;we
look to you&mdash;the future looks to you. Ah, my dear, if I’d a thousand
lives, I’d give them all to our cause. The cause of women, d’you
say? I say the cause of humanity. And there are some"&mdash;she glanced
fiercely at the window&mdash;"who don’t see it! There are some who
are satisfied to go on, year after year, refusing to admit the
truth. And we who have the vision&mdash;the kettle boiling over? No,
no, let me see to it&mdash;we who know the truth," she continued, gesticulating
with the kettle and the teapot. Owing to these encumbrances, perhaps,
she lost the thread of her discourse, and concluded, rather wistfully,
"It’s all so <em>SIMPLE." </em>She referred to a matter that was
a perpetual source of bewilderment to her&mdash;the extraordinary incapacity
of the human race, in a world where the good is so unmistakably
divided from the bad, of distinguishing one from the other, and
embodying what ought to be done in a few large, simple Acts of
Parliament, which would, in a very short time, completely change
the lot of humanity.</p>

<p>"One would have thought," she said, "that men of University training,
like Mr. Asquith&mdash;one would have thought that an appeal to reason
would not be unheard by them. But reason," she reflected, "what
is reason without Reality?"</p>

<p>Doing homage to the phrase, she repeated it once more, and caught
the ear of Mr. Clacton, as he issued from his room; and he repeated
it a third time, giving it, as he was in the habit of doing with
Mrs. Seal’s phrases, a dryly humorous intonation. He was well
pleased with the world, however, and he remarked, in a flattering
manner, that he would like to see that phrase in large letters
at the head of a leaflet.</p>

<p>"But, Mrs. Seal, we have to aim at a judicious combination of
the two,"  he added in his magisterial way to check the unbalanced
enthusiasm of the women. "Reality has to be voiced by reason before
it can make itself felt. The weak point of all these movements,
Miss Datchet," he continued, taking his place at the table and
turning to Mary as usual when about to deliver his more profound
cogitations, "is that they are not based upon sufficiently intellectual
grounds. A mistake, in my opinion. The British public likes a
pellet of reason in its jam of eloquence&mdash;a pill of reason in
its pudding of sentiment," he said, sharpening the phrase to a
satisfactory degree of literary precision.</p>

<p>His eyes rested, with something of the vanity of an author, upon
the yellow leaflet which Mary held in her hand. She rose, took
her seat at the head of the table, poured out tea for her colleagues,
and gave her opinion upon the leaflet. So she had poured out tea,
so she had criticized Mr. Clacton’s leaflets a hundred times already;
but now it seemed to her that she was doing it in a different
spirit; she had enlisted in the army, and was a volunteer no longer.
She had renounced something and was now&mdash;how could she express
it?&mdash;not quite "in the running" for life. She had always known
that Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal were not in the running, and across
the gulf that separated them she had seen them in the guise of
shadow people, flitting in and out of the ranks of the living&mdash;eccentrics,
undeveloped human beings, from whose substance some essential
part had been cut away. All this had never struck her so clearly
as it did this afternoon, when she felt that her lot was cast
with them for ever. One view of the world plunged in darkness,
so a more volatile temperament might have argued after a season
of despair, let the world turn again and show another, more splendid,
perhaps. No, Mary thought, with unflinching loyalty to what appeared
to her to be the true view, having lost what is best, I do not
mean to pretend that any other view does instead. Whatever happens,
I mean to have no presences in my life. Her very words had a sort
of distinctness which is sometimes produced by sharp, bodily pain.
To Mrs. Seal’s secret jubilation the rule which forbade discussion
of shop at tea-time was overlooked. Mary and Mr. Clacton argued
with a cogency and a ferocity which made the little woman feel
that something very important&mdash;she hardly knew what&mdash;was taking
place. She became much excited; one crucifix became entangled
with another, and she dug a considerable hole in the table with
the point of her pencil in order to emphasize the most striking
heads of the discourse; and how any combination of Cabinet Ministers
could resist such discourse she really did not know.</p>

<p>She could hardly bring herself to remember her own private instrument
of justice&mdash;the typewriter. The telephone-bell rang, and as she
hurried off to answer a voice which always seemed a proof of importance
by itself, she felt that it was at this exact spot on the surface
of the globe that all the subterranean wires of thought and progress
came together. When she returned, with a message from the printer,
she found that Mary was putting on her hat firmly; there was something
imperious and dominating in her attitude altogether.</p>

<p>"Look, Sally," she said, "these letters want copying. These I’ve
not looked at. The question of the new census will have to be
gone into carefully. But I’m going home now. Good night, Mr. Clacton;
good night, Sally."</p>

<p>"We are very fortunate in our secretary, Mr. Clacton," said Mrs.
Seal, pausing with her hand on the papers, as the door shut behind
Mary. Mr. Clacton himself had been vaguely impressed by something
in Mary’s behavior towards him. He envisaged a time even when
it would become necessary to tell her that there could not be
two masters in one office&mdash;but she was certainly able, very able,
and in touch with a group of very clever young men. No doubt they
had suggested to her some of her new ideas.</p>

<p>He signified his assent to Mrs. Seal’s remark, but observed,
with a glance at the clock, which showed only half an hour past
five:</p>

<p>"If she takes the work seriously, Mrs. Seal&mdash;but that’s just
what some of your clever young ladies don’t do." So saying he
returned to his room, and Mrs. Seal, after a moment’s hesitation,
hurried back to her labors.</p>
