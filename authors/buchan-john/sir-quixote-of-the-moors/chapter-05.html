<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Of my life at Lindean for the next three days I have no clear
remembrance. The weather was dry and languid, as often follows
a spell of rain, and the long hills which huddled around the house
looked near and imminent. The place was so still that if one shouted
it seemed almost a profanation. 'Twas so Sabbath-like that I almost
came to dislike it. Indeed, I doubt I should have found it irksome
had there not been a brawling stream in the glen, which kept up
a continuous dashing and chattering. It seemed the one link between
me and that far-away world in which not long agone I had been
a dweller.</p>

<p>The life, too, was as regular as in the king's court. Sharp at
six I was awakened, and ere seven we were assembled for breakfast.
Then to prayers, and then to the occupations of the day. The minister
would be at his books or down among his people on some errand
of mercy. The church had been long closed, for the Privy Council,
seeing that Master Lambert was opposed to them, had commanded
him to be silent; and yet, mark you, so well was he loved in the
place that they durst set no successor in his stead. They tried
it once and a second time, but the unhappy man was so taken with
fear of the people that he shook the dust of Lindean off his feet,
and departed in search of a more hospitable dwelling. But the
minister's mouth was shut, save when covertly, and with the greatest
peril to himself, he would preach at a meeting of the hill-folk
in the recesses of the surrounding uplands.</p>

<p>The library I found no bad one &mdash;I who in my day have been
considered to have something of a taste in books. To be sure there
was much wearisome stuff, the work of old divines, and huge commentaries
on the Scriptures, written in Latin and plentifully interspersed
with Greek and Hebrew. But there was good store of the Classics,
both prose and poetry,&mdash;<em>Horace</em>, who has ever been my
favorite, and <em>Homer</em>, who, to my thinking, is the finest
of the ancients. Here, too, I found a <em>Plato</em>, and I swear
I read more of him in the manse than I have done since I went
through him with M. Clerselier, when we were students together
in Paris.</p>

<p>The acquaintance which I had formed with Master Semple speedily
ripened into a fast friendship. I found it in my heart to like
this great serious man&mdash;a bumpkin if you will, but a man of courage
and kindliness. We were wont to take long walks, always in some
lonely part of the country, and we grew more intimate in our conversation
than I should ever have dreamed of. He would call me John, and
this much I suffered him, to save my name from the barbarity of
his pronunciation; while in turn I fell to calling him Henry,
as if we had been born and bred together. I found that he loved
to hear of my own land and my past life, which, now that I think
of it, must have had no little interest to one dwelling in such
solitudes. From him I heard of his father, of his brief term at
the College of Edinburgh, which he left when the strife in the
country grew high, and of his sorrow and anger at the sufferings
of those who withstood the mandate of the king. Though I am of
the true faith, I think it no shame that my sympathy was all with
these rebels, for had I not seen something of their misery myself?
But above all, he would speak of <em>la belle Anne</em> as one
gentleman will tell another of his love, when he found that I
was a willing listener. I could scarce have imagined such warmth
of passion to exist in the man as he showed at the very mention
of her name.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he would cry out, "I would die for her; I would gang to
the world's end to pleasure her! I whiles think that I break the
first commandment every day of my life, for I canna keep her a
moment out of my thoughts, and I fear she's more to me than any
earthly thing should be. I think of her at nicht. I see her name
in every page of the Book. I thought I was bad when I was over
at Clachlands, and had to ride five miles to see her; but now
I'm tenfold worse when I'm biding aside her. God grant it be not
counted to me for sin!"</p>

<p>"Amen to that," said I. 'Tis a fine thing to see the love of
a maid; but I hold 'tis a finer to witness the passion of a strong
man.</p>

<p>Yet, withal, there was something sinister about the house and
its folk which to me was the fly in the ointment. They were kindness
and charity incarnate, but they were cold and gloomy to boot,
lacking any grace or sprightliness in their lives. I find it hard
to write this, for their goodness to me was beyond recompense;
yet I must set it down, since in some measure it has to do with
my story. The old man would look at me at times and sigh, nor
did I think it otherwise than fitting, till I found from his words
that the sighs were on account of my own spiritual darkness. I
have no quarrel with any man for wishing to convert me, but to
sigh at one's approach seems a doleful way of setting about it.
Then he would break out from his wonted quietness at times to
rail at his foes, calling down the wrath of Heaven to blight them.
Such a fit was always followed by a painful exhaustion, which
left him as weak as a child, and shivering like a leaf. I bitterly
cursed the state of a country which could ruin the peace of mind
of a man so sweet-tempered by nature, and make him the sport of
needless rage. 'Twas pitiful to see him creep off to his devotions
after any such outbreak, penitent and ashamed. Even to his daughter
he was often cruelly sharp, and would call her to account for
the merest trifle.</p>

<p>As for Master Henry, what shall I say of him? I grew to love
him like my own brother, yet I no more understood him than the
Sultan of Turkey. He had strange fits of gloom, begotten, I must
suppose, of the harsh country and his many anxieties, in which
he was more surly than a bear, speaking little, and that mainly
from the Scriptures. I have one case in my memory, when, had I
not been in a sense his guest, I had scarce refrained from quarreling.
'Twas in the afternoon of the second day, when we returned weary
from one of our long wanderings. Anne tripped forth into the autumn
sunlight singing a catch, a simple glee of the village folk.</p>

<p>"Peace, Anne," says Master Henry savagely; "it little becomes
you to be singing in these days, unless it be a godly psalm. Keep
your songs for better times."</p>

<p>"What ails you?" I ventured to say. "You praised her this very
morning for singing the self-same verses."</p>

<p>"And peace, you," he says roughly, as he entered the house; "if
the lass hearkened to your accursed creed, I should have stronger
words for her."</p>

<p>My breath was fairly taken from me at this incredible rudeness.
I had my hand on my sword, and had I been in my own land we should
soon have settled it. As it was, I shut my lips firmly and choked
down my choler.</p>

<p>Yet I cannot leave with this ill word of the man. That very night
he talked with me so pleasingly, and with so friendly a purport,
that I conceived he must have been scarce himself when he so insulted
me. Indeed, I discerned two natures in the man&mdash;one, hard, saturnine,
fanatically religious; the other, genial and kindly, like that
of any other gentleman of family. The former I attributed to the
accident of his fortune; the second I held to be the truer, and
in my thoughts of him still think of it as the only one.</p>

<p>But I must pass to the events which befell on the even of the
third day, and wrought so momentous a change in the life at Lindean.
'Twas just at the lighting of the lamp, when Anne and the minister
and myself sat talking in the little sitting room, that Master
Henry entered with a look of great concern on his face, and beckoned
the elder man out.</p>

<p>"Andrew Gibb is here," said he.</p>

<p>"And what may Andrew Gibb be wanting?" asked the old man, glancing
up sharply.</p>

<p>"He brings nae guid news, I fear, but he'll tell them to none
but you; so hasten out, sir, to the back, for he's come far, and
he's ill at the waiting."</p>

<p>The twain were gone for some time, and in their absence I could
hear high voices in the back end of the house, conversing as on
some matter of deep import. Anne fetched the lamp from the kitchen
and trimmed it with elaborate care, lighting it and setting it
in its place. Then, at last, the minister returned alone.</p>

<p>I was shocked at the sight of him as he re-entered the room.
His face was ashen pale and tightly drawn about the lips. He crept
to a chair and leaned his head on the table, speaking no word.
Then he burst out of a sudden into a storm of pleading.</p>

<p>"O Lord God," he cried, "thou hast aye been good to us, thou
has kept us weel, and bielded us frae the wolves who have sought
to devour us. Oh, dinna leave us now. It's no' for mysel' or Henry
that I care. We're men, and can warstle through ills; but oh,
what am I to dae wi' the bit helpless lassie? It's awfu' to have
to gang oot among hills and bogs to bide, but it's ten times waur
when ye dinna ken what's gaun to come to your bairn. Hear me,
O Lord, and grant me my request. I've no' been a' that I micht
have been, but oh, if I ha'e tried to serve thee at a', dinna
let this danger overwhelm us!"</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished, and was still sitting with bowed head,
when Master Henry also entered the room. His eyes were filled
with an austere frenzy, such as I had learned to look for.</p>

<p>"Ay, sir," said he, "'tis a time for us a' to be on our knees.
But ha'e courage, and dinna let us spoil the guid cause by our
weak mortal complaining. Is't no' better to be hunkering in a
moss-hole and communing with the Lord than waxing fat like Jeshurun
in carnal corruption? Call on God's name, but no' wi' sighing,
but wi' exaltation, for He hath bidden us to a mighty heritage."</p>

<p>"Ye speak brave and true, Henry, and I'm wi' your every word.
But tell me what's to become o' my bairn? What will Anne dae?
I once thought there was something atween you&#11834;" He stopped
abruptly and searched the face of the young man.</p>

<p>At his words Master Semple had started as under a lash. "Oh,
my God," he cried, "I had forgotten! Anne, Anne, my dearie, we
canna leave ye, and you to be my wife. This is a sore trial of
faith, sir, and I misdoubt I canna stand it. To leave ye to the
tender mercies o' a' the hell-hounds o' dragoons&mdash;oh, I canna
dae't!"</p>

<p>He clapped his hand to his forehead and walked about the room
like a man distraught.</p>

<p>And now I put in my word. "What ails you, Henry? Tell me, for
I am sore grieved to see you in such perplexity."</p>

<p>"Ails me?" he repeated. "Aye, I will tell ye what ails me"; and
he drew his chair before me. "Andrew Gibb's come ower frae the
Ruthen wi' shure news that a warrant's oot against us baith, for
being at the preaching on Callowa' Muir. 'Twas an enemy did it,
and now the soldiers are coming at ony moment to lay hands on
us and take us off to Embro'. Then there'll be but a short lease
of life for us; and unless we take to the hills this very nicht
we may be ower late in the morning. I'm wae to tak' sae auld a
man as Master Lambert to wet mosses, but there's nothing else
to be dune. But what's to become o' Anne? Whae's to see to her,
when the dragoons come riding and cursing about the toon? Oh,
it's a terrible time, John. Pray to God, if ye never prayed before,
to let it pass."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle had meantime spoken never a word, but had risen
and gone to her father's chair and put her arms around his neck.
Her presence seemed to cheer the old man, for he ceased mourning
and looked up, while she sat, still as a statue, with her grave,
lovely face against his. But Master Semple's grief was pitiful
to witness. He rocked himself to and fro in his chair, with his
arms folded and a set, white face. Every now and then he would
break into a cry like a stricken animal. The elder man was the
first to counsel patience.</p>

<p>"Stop, Henry," says he; "it's ill-befitting Christian folk to
set sic an example. We've a' got our troubles, and if ours are
heavier than some, it's no' for us to complain. Think o' the many
years o' grace we've had. There's nae doubt the Lord will look
after the bairn, for he's a guid Shepherd for the feckless."</p>

<p>But now of a sudden a thought seemed to strike Henry, and he
was on his feet in a twinkling and by my side.</p>

<p>"John," he almost screamed in my ear, "John, I'm going to ask
ye for the greatest service that ever man asked. Ye'll no' say
me nay?"</p>

<p>"Let me hear it," said I.</p>

<p>"Will <em>you</em> bide wi' the lass? You're a man o' birth,
and I'll swear to it, a man o' honor. I can trust you as I would
trust my ain brither. Oh, man, dinna deny me! It's the last hope
I ha'e, for if ye refuse, we maun e'en gang to the hills and leave
the puir thing alane. Oh, ye canna say me nae! Tell me that ye'll
do my asking."</p>

<p>I was so thunderstruck at the request that I scarce could think
for some minutes. Consider, was it not a strange thing to be asked
to stay alone in a wild moorland house with another man's betrothed,
for Heaven knew how many weary days? My life and prospects were
none so cheerful for me to despise anything, nor so varied that
I might pick and choose; but yet 'twas dreary, if no worse, to
look forward to any length of time in this desolate place. I was
grateful for the house as a shelter by the way, yet I hoped to
push on and get rid, as soon as might be, of this accursed land.</p>

<p>But was I not bound by all the ties of gratitude to grant my
host's request? They had found me fainting at their door, they
had taken me in, and treated me to their best; I was bound in
common honor to do something to requite their kindness. And let
me add, though not often a man subject to any feelings of compassion,
whatever natural bent I had this way having been spoiled in the
wars, I nevertheless could not refrain from pitying the distress
of that strong man before me. I felt tenderly toward him, more
so than I had felt to anyone for many a day.</p>

<p>All these thoughts raced through my head in the short time while
Master Henry stood before me. The look in his eyes, the pained
face of the old man, and the sight of Anne, so fair and helpless,
fixed my determination.</p>

<p>"I am bound to you in gratitude," said I, "and I would seek to
repay you. I will bide in the house, if so you will, and be the
maid's protector. God grant I may be faithful to my trust, and
may he send a speedy end to your exile?"</p>

<p>So 'twas all finished in a few minutes, and I was fairly embarked
upon the queerest enterprise of my life. For myself I sat dazed
and meditative; as for the minister and Master Semple, one-half
of the burden seemed to be lifted from their minds. I was amazed
at the trusting natures of these men, who had habited all their
days with honest folk till they conceived all to be as worthy
as themselves. I felt, I will own, a certain shrinking from the
responsibility of the task; but the Rubicon had been crossed and
there was no retreat.</p>

<p>Of the rest of that night how shall I tell? There was such a
bustling and pother as I had never seen in any house since the
day that my brother Denis left Rohaine for the Dutch wars. There
was a running and scurrying about, a packing of food, a seeking
of clothes, for the fugitives must be off before the first light.
Anne went about with a pale, tearful face; and 'twas a matter
of no surprise, for to see a father, a man frail and fallen in
years, going out to the chill moorlands in the early autumn till
no man knew when, is a grievous thing for a young maid. Her lover
was scarce in so dire a case, for he was young and strong, and
well used to the life of the hills. For him there was hope; for
the old man but a shadow. My heart grew as bitter as gall at the
thought of the villains who brought it about.</p>

<p>How shall I tell of the morning, when the faint light was flushing
the limits of the sky, and the first call of a heath-bird broke
the silence! 'Twas sad to see these twain with their bundles (the
younger carrying the elder's share) creep through the heather
toward the hills. They affected a cheerful resolution, assumed
to comfort Anne's fears and sorrow; but I could mark beneath it
a settled despair. The old man prayed at the threshold, and clasped
his daughter many times, kissing her and giving her his blessing.
The younger, shaken with great sobs, bade a still more tender
farewell, and then started off abruptly to hide his grief. Anne
and I, from the door, watched their figures disappear over the
crest of the ridge, and then went in, sober and full of angry
counsels.</p>

<p>The soldiers came about an hour before mid-day&mdash;a band from Clachlands,
disorderly ruffians, commanded by a mealy-faced captain. They
were a scurrilous set, their faces bloated with debauchery and
their clothes in no very decent order. As one might have expected,
they were mightily incensed at finding their bird flown, and fell
to cursing each other with great good-will. They poked their low-bred
faces into every nook in the house and outbuildings; and when
at length they had satisfied themselves that there was no hope
from that quarter, they had all the folk of the dwelling out on
the green and questioned them one by one. The two serving-lasses
were stanch, and stoutly denied all knowledge of their master's
whereabouts&mdash;which was indeed no more than the truth. One of the
two, Jean Crichope by name, when threatened with ill-treatment
if she did not speak, replied valiantly that she would twist the
neck of the first scoundrelly soldier who dared to lay finger
on her. This I doubt not she could have performed, for she was
a very daughter of Anak.</p>

<p>As for Anne and myself, we answered according to our agreement.
They were very curious to know my errand there and my name and
birth; and when I bade them keep their scurvy tongues from defiling
a gentleman's house, they were none so well pleased. I am not
a vain man, and I do not set down the thing I am going to relate
as at all redounding to my credit; I merely tell it as an incident
in my tale.</p>

<p>The captain at last grew angry. He saw that the law was powerless
to touch us, and that nought remained for him but to ride to the
hills in pursuit of the fugitives. This he seemed to look upon
as a hardship, being a man to all appearance more fond of the
bottle and pasty than a hill gallop. At any rate he grew wroth,
and addressed to Anne a speech so full of gross rudeness that
I felt it my duty to interfere.</p>

<p>"Look you here, sir," said I, "I am here, in the first place,
to see that no scoundrel maltreats this lady. I would ask you,
therefore, to be more civil in your talk or to get down and meet
me in fair fight. These gentlemen," and I made a mocking bow to
his company, "will, I am assured, see an honest encounter."</p>

<p>The man flushed under his coarse skin. His reputation was at
stake. There was no other course open but to take up my challenge.</p>

<p>"You, you bastard Frenchman," he cried, "would you dare to insult
a captain of the king's dragoons? I' faith, I will teach you better
manners;" and he came at me with his sword in a great heat. The
soldiers crowded round like children to see a cock-fight.</p>

<p>In an instant we crossed swords and fell to; I with the sun in
my eyes and on the lower ground. The combat was not of long duration.
In a trice I found that he was a mere child in my hands, a barbarian
who used his sword like a quarter-staff, not even putting strength
into his thrusts.</p>

<p>"Enough!" I cried; "this is mere fooling;" and with a movement
which any babe in arms might have checked, twirled his blade from
his hands and sent it spinning over the grass. "Follow your sword,
and learn two things before you come back&mdash;civility to maids and
the rudiments of sword-play. Bah! Begone with you!"</p>

<p>Some one of his men laughed, and I think they were secretly glad
at their tyrant's discomfiture. No more need be said. He picked
up his weapon and rode away, vowing vengeance upon me and swearing
at every trooper behind him. I cared not a straw for him, for
despite his bravado I knew that the fear of death was in his cowardly
heart, and that we should be troubled no more by his visitations.</p>
