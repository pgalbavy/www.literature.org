<p>Melville Clarendon was so interested in the efforts of the three
Sioux to capture his horse, that for a minute or two he forgot
that Dot was below-stairs. Her cry, however, roused him to the
situation and truth, and he flew down the steps.</p>

<p>In fact, the little girl had had a stirring time. While she was
too young to realize the full danger of herself and brother, she
knew there were bad Indians trying to get into the house, and
the best thing for her to do was to obey every instruction Melville
gave to her.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that Melville had a few words of conversation
with one of the Sioux outside the door, who asked to be admitted.
After the youth's refusal, there was silence for a minute or two,
and, supposing the Indian was gone, the lad hurried to the upper
story to gain a survey of his surroundings.</p>

<p>But the warrior had not left. After the departure of Melville
he resumed his knocking on the door, but so gently that no one
heard him except Dot. In her innocence she forgot the warnings
given to her, and, sliding off her chair, stepped forward, and
began shoving the end of the leathern string through, so that
the Indian could raise the latch. She had tried to raise it herself,
but the pressure from the outside was so strong that the friction
prevented.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Pull the string, and the door will open."]</p>

<p>"There!" said the little girl; "all you've got to do is to pull
the string, and the door will open."</p>

<p>When the Indian saw the head of the string groping its way through
the little hole in the door like a tiny serpent, he grasped the
end, and gave it such a smart jerk that the latch flew up.</p>

<p>But, fortunately, it was necessary to do more than draw the latch
to open the door. The massive bar was in place, and the Sioux,
most likely with a suspicion of the truth, made no effort to force
the structure.</p>

<p>But while he was thus employed Red Feather had slipped from the
back of his pony and approached the house. He took the side opposite
to that from which Melville was looking forth, so that the youth
did not notice his action. He saw the idleness of trying to make
his way through the door, and formed another plan.</p>

<p>With little effort he raised the sash in the narrow window on
the right. About half-way to the top was a wooden button to hold
the lower sash in place when raised. The occupants of the house
used no care in securing the windows, since, as I have explained,
they were too narrow to allow any person, unless very thin of
figure, to force his way through them.</p>

<p>Red Feather seemed to forget that he had tried to take the life
of one of the white persons only a few minutes before; but, since
no return shot had come from within the building, he must have
concluded the defenders were panic-stricken, or else he showed
a daring that amounted to recklessness; for, after raising the
sash, he pushed the curtain aside, and began carefully shoving
his head through the opening.</p>

<p>Now, the house being of logs, it was necessary for the chieftain
to force his shoulders a slight distance to allow his head fairly
to enter the room. This required great care and labor, and more
risk on the part of the Sioux than he suspected&mdash;since he should
have known that it is easier to advance under such circumstances
than to retreat, and, inasmuch as it was so hard to push on, it
was likely to be still harder to retreat.</p>

<p>Dot Clarendon, like her brother, was so interested in another
direction that she failed for the time to note that which was
of far more importance.</p>

<p>But the feeling that she and her brother were in a situation
of great danger became so strong that she felt there was only
One who could save them, and, just as she had been taught from
earliest infancy, she now asked that One to take care of them.</p>

<p>Sinking on her chubby knees, she folded her hands, shut her eyes
and poured out the simple prayer of faith and love to Him whose
ear is never closed to the appeal of the most helpless. Her eyes
were still closed, and her lips moving, when the noise made by
Red Feather in forcing himself through the narrow opening caused
her to stop suddenly and look around.</p>

<p>The sight which met her gaze was enough to startle the bravest
man. The head and shoulders of a hideous Sioux warrior were within
six feet of where she was kneeling. The Indian was still struggling
but he could get no farther, and, as it was, he was wedged very
closely.</p>

<p>It must have caused strange feelings in the heart of the wicked
savage when he observed the tiny figure kneeling on the floor,
with clasped hands, closed eyes, upturned face, and murmuring
lips. It is hard to think there could be any one untouched by
the sight, though Red Feather gave no sign of such emotion at
the time.</p>

<p>The face of the Sioux was not painted, though it is the fashion
of his people to do so when upon the war-trail. It could not have
looked more frightful had it been daubed with streaks and spots,
and Dot was terrified. Springing to her feet, she recoiled with
a gasp, and stared at the dreadful countenance.</p>

<p>Red Feather beckoned as best he could for the little one to come
nigh him.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Dot uttered the cry which brought
Melville in such haste from the room above. He rushed down, loaded
gun in hand, and it is stating the matter mildly to say that he
effected a change in the situation. Startled by the sound of the
steps on the stairs, Red Feather glanced up and saw the lad, his
face white with anger, and a very dangerous-looking rifle in his
hand.</p>

<p>"I'll teach you manners!" called out Melville, halting on reaching
the floor, and bringing his weapon to a level; "such a rogue as
you ain't fit to live."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Poured out the simple prayer of faith and love."]</p>

<p>As you may suppose, Red Feather was satisfied that the best thing
for him to do was to leave that place as quickly as he knew how.
He began struggling fiercely to back out, and he must have been
surprised when he found he was fast, and that the more he strove
to free himself the more firmly he became wedged in.</p>

<p>Seeing his predicament, Melville advanced a couple of steps,
holding his weapon so that its muzzle was within arm's length
of the terrified visage of the chieftain.</p>

<p>"I've got you, Red Feather!" said the exultant youth; "and the
best thing I can do is to shoot you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mel!" called Dot, running towards her brother, "don't hurt
him, for that would be wicked."</p>

<p>I must do Melville Clarendon the justice to state that he had
no intention of shooting the Sioux chieftain who was caught fast
in such a curious way. Such an act would have been cruel, though
many persons would say it was right, because Red Feather was trying
to slay both Melville and his little sister.</p>

<p>But the youth could not help enjoying the strange fix in which
the Indian was caught, and he meant to make the best use of it.
It is not often that an American Indian loses his wits when in
danger, but Red Feather, for a few minutes, was under the control
of a feeling such as a soldier shows when stricken by panic.</p>

<p>Had he kept cool, and carefully turned and twisted about as required,
while slowly drawing backward, he could have released himself
from the snare without trouble; but it was his frantic effort
which defeated his own purpose, and forced him to stop, panting
and despairing, with his head still within the room, and at the
mercy of the youth, who seemed to lower his gun only at the earnest
pleading of his little sister.</p>

<p>It was no more than natural that the Sioux should have felt certain
that his head and shoulders were beginning to swell, and that,
even if the lad spared him, he would never be able to get himself
out of the scrape, unless the side of the house should be first
taken down.</p>

<p>It was a time to sue for mercy, and the desperate, ugly-tempered
Red Feather was prompt to do so. Ceasing his efforts, and turning
his face, all aglow with cold perspiration, towards the boy, who
had just lowered the muzzle of his gun, he tried to smile, though
the expression of his countenance was anything but smiling, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Red Feather love white boy&mdash;love white girl!"</p>

<p>It is hard to restrain one's pity for another when in actual
distress, and Melville's heart was touched the instant the words
were uttered.</p>

<p>"Sit down in your chair," he said gently to Dot, "and don't disobey
me again by leaving it until I tell you."</p>

<p>"But you won't hurt him, will you?" she pleaded, half obeying,
and yet hesitating until she could receive his answer.</p>

<p>Not wishing Red Feather to know his decision, he stooped over
and whispered in her ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, Dot, I will not hurt him; but don't say anything, for I
don't want him to know it just yet."</p>

<p>It is more than likely that the distressed Sioux saw enough in
the bright face to awaken hope, for he renewed his begging for
mercy.</p>

<p>"Red Feather love white folks&mdash;he been bad Injin&mdash;he be good
Injin now&mdash;'cause he love white folks."</p>

<p>"Red Feather," said he, lowering his voice so as not to reach
the ears of the other Sioux, drawn to the spot by the strange
occurrence; "you do not deserve mercy, for you came to kill me
and all my folk. There! don't deny it, for you speak with a double
tongue. But <em>she</em> has asked me to spare you, and perhaps
I will. If I keep away all harm from you, what will you do for
us?"</p>

<p>"Love white folks &mdash;Red Feather go away&mdash;won't hurt&mdash;bring
game to his brother."</p>

<p>Having rested a few minutes, the Sioux began wriggling desperately
again, hoping to free himself by sheer strength; but he could
not budge his head and shoulders from their vice-like imprisonment,
and something like despair must have settled over him when all
doubt that he was swelling fast was removed.</p>

<p>It was at the same instant that two of the warriors on the outside,
seeing the hapless position of their chief, seized his feet, and
began tugging with all their power.</p>

<p>They quickly let go, however; for the impatient sachem delivered
such a vigorous kick that both went over backward, with their
feet pointed towards the clouds.</p>

<p>"Red Feather," said Melville, standing close enough to the hapless
prisoner to touch him with his hand, "if I help you out of that
place and do not hurt you, will you and your warriors go away?"</p>

<p>The Sioux nodded so vigorously that he struck his chin against
the wood hard enough to cause him some pain.</p>

<p>"Me go away&mdash;all Sioux go away&mdash;neber come here 'gin&mdash;don't hurt
nuffin&mdash;hurry way."</p>

<p>"And you will not come back to harm us?"</p>

<p>"Neber come back&mdash;stay way&mdash;love white folks."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you will ever love them, and I don't ask you
to do so; but you know that my father and mother and I have always
treated your people kindly, and they have no reason to hurt us."</p>

<p>"Dat so&mdash;dat so &mdash;Red Feather love fader, love moder, love
son, love pappoose of white folks."</p>

<p>"You see how easy it would be for me to shoot you where you are
now without any risk to myself, but I shall not hurt you. I will
help to get your head and shoulders loose; but I am afraid that
when you mount your horse again and ride out on the prairie you
will forget all you promised me."</p>

<p>"Neber, neber, neber!" replied the chieftain, with all the energy
at his command.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Oh, Mel!" called Dot "don't hurt him." &mdash;Page
30]</p>

<p>"You will think that you know enough never to run your head into
that window again, and you will want to set fire to the house
and tomahawk us."</p>

<p>The Sioux looked as if he was deeply pained at this distrust
of his honorable intentions, and he seemed at a loss to know what
to say to restore himself to the good graces of his youthful master.</p>

<p>"You are sure you won't forget your promise, Red Feather?"</p>

<p>"Red Feather Sioux chief&mdash;he neber tell lie&mdash;he speak wid single
tongue&mdash;he love white folks."</p>

<p>"I counted five warriors with you; are they all you have?"</p>

<p>"Dey all&mdash;hab no more."</p>

<p>Melville believed the Indian spoke the truth.</p>

<p>"Where are the rest?"</p>

<p>"Go down oder side Muddy Riber&mdash;won't come here."</p>

<p>Melville was inclined to credit this statement also. If Red Feather
spoke the truth, the rest of his band, numbering fully a score,
were twenty miles distant, and were not likely to appear in that
part of the country. Such raids as that on which they were engaged
must of necessity be pushed hard and fast. Even if the settlers
do not instantly rally, the American cavalry are quite sure to
follow them, and the Indians have no time to loiter. The rest
of the band, if a score of miles away, were likely to have their
hands full without riding thus far out of their course.</p>

<p>"Well," said Melville, after a moment's thought, as if still
in doubt as to what he ought to do, "I shall not hurt you&mdash;more
than that, I will help you to free yourself."</p>

<p>He leaned his gun against the table near him, and stepped forward
and placed his hands on the head and shoulders of the suffering
prisoner.</p>

<p>"Oogh!" grunted Red Feather; "grow bigger&mdash;swell up fast&mdash;bimeby
Red Feather get so big, he die."</p>

<p>"I don't think it is as bad as <em>that</em>," remarked Melville,
unable to repress a smile, "but it will take some work to get
you loose."</p>
