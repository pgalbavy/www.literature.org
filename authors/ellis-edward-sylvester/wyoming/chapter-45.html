<p>The shock terrified the whole camp.</p>

<p>Aunt Peggy dropped the piece of meat she was cooking, and sprang
back with a gasp. The other Indians, accustomed as they were to
violence, stared in blank wonder, while those on the fallen tree
leaped to their feet and gazed at the figure of the Indian as
he lay on his face, with his tomahawk clenched in his vise-like
grip.</p>

<p>Jake Golcher was dazed, and neither spoke nor stirred until Maggie,
in the very depths of her agony, ran to him and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this? Was he seeking father's life? If
he was, it was <em>you</em> who told him to do it!"</p>

<p>The Tory looked in the white face of the girl, and said, in a
surly voice:</p>

<p>"I didn't know anything about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jake," she continued, talking rapidly, and in such mental
distress that every eye was fixed upon her; "if this is <em>your</em>
work, a just God will punish you for it. Father has never sought
to injure you. We are neighbors, and belong to the same race&mdash;"</p>

<p>He attempted to turn away, but she caught his arm, and faced
him about.</p>

<p>"You shall hear me. If you want human lives, take <em>mine</em>&mdash;take
Eva's, but spare his gray hairs; do him a wrong, and as sure as
our Heavenly Father reigns above, a punishment shall come to you.
Show him mercy, treat us as human beings, and you will thank Him
to your dying day that He led you aright, when you went so far
astray."</p>

<p>The father would have gone forward and drawn her away, but he
was held by her soulful eloquence.</p>

<p>She staggered back and would have fallen, had not Aunt Peggy,
who, after all, was the most cool-headed one in the party, seen
what was coming and caught her in her arms.</p>

<p>Half-supporting and half-dragging her, she got her back to the
tree, where she gently seated her.</p>

<p>Poor Maggie threw her arms around the good woman's neck and gave
way to hysterical sobbing, while her aunt tried to soothe her.</p>

<p>Mr. Brainerd sat like a statue, but his lips trembled, and it
required all the power of his will to keep from breaking down
as utterly as did Maggie herself, who, flinging one of her arms
around weeping Eva, gathered her and their aunt in an embrace,
and surrendered to her tempest of grief.</p>

<p>The Senecas looked on, but if there was any glimmering of tenderness
in their nature it did not struggle to the surface, and the trees
around them could not have betrayed less emotion.</p>

<p>As for Jake Golcher, he scanned the picture with darker passions
than those of the savages themselves.</p>

<p>He did not stir, but, when he saw Habakkuk McEwen look inquiringly
at him, he beckoned him to approach.</p>

<p>The frightened fellow sprang to his feet and hurried across the
short space, eager to do anything to win the favor of the other.</p>

<p>"Do you know who shot that Indian?" asked the Tory, in an undertone.</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea."</p>

<p>"It was Fred Godfrey; he is somewhere near. The shot sounded
out yonder"&mdash;pointing in the proper direction&mdash;"and, if you want
to save your life, you must go out and bring him in."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said McEwen, catching like a drowning man at a
straw.</p>

<p>He turned about to start upon his strange errand, when Golcher
commanded him to stop.</p>

<p>"How are you going to do it?"</p>

<p>"Catch him by the neck and heels, and drag him along."</p>

<p>"Don't you see the Senecas are starting off to hunt him up?"</p>

<p>It was true. The red men quickly recovered from the shock, and,
knowing who fired the shot, were stealing off into the woods in
search of the youth, who had given proof of his presence near
them.</p>

<p>Almost every one was able to tell the point whence came the familiar
bullet, and it will be understood that Fred Godfrey took his life
in his hand when he interposed to save his father.</p>

<p>"I don't believe they will find him," said Jake Golcher, alluding
to the Senecas, who were moving off in the darkness; "but you
can join him, because he takes you for a friend; go out in the
woods, signal to him, and when you find him, get him to come nigh
enough to be catched. You can do it, and if you succeed, you shall
be spared. Don't think," added the Tory, significantly, "that
because we let you jine in the hunt you can slip off in the dark."</p>

<p>"Oh, I never thought of such a thing," protested the New Englander.
"I always keep my promise, and I'll bring him back."</p>

<p>"There isn't one of these folks that can get away, for the Senecas
are all around us. Gray Panther will soon be here with twenty
more, and then we shall have 'em all."</p>

<p>If this were the case, Habakkuk might well have asked why Golcher
wished him to join in the search. But if such a question came
to the mind of McEwen he did not utter it.</p>

<p>"If you try to run away you'll be brought back here and tomahawked
inside of half an hour; do your duty, and I'll take care of you;
after you get out there in the dark you can signal to him in such
a way that he'll show himself, and then you must prove your smartness
by getting him to come with you to some p'int where we can pounce
onto him. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"It's all as plain as the nose on your face," said Habakkuk.</p>

<p>"Then be off with you!"</p>
