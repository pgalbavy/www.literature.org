Two days after came the day of the Crisis, the day of the Fadden
Dance.  It would have been a crisis anyhow, but it was
complicated in Ann Veronica's mind by the fact that a letter lay
on the breakfast-table from Mr. Manning, and that her aunt
focussed a brightly tactful disregard upon this throughout the
meal.  Ann Veronica had come down thinking of nothing in the
world but her inflexible resolution to go to the dance in the
teeth of all opposition.  She did not know Mr. Manning's
handwriting, and opened his letter and read some lines before its
import appeared.  Then for a time she forgot the Fadden affair
altogether.  With a well-simulated unconcern and a heightened
color she finished her breakfast.
<P>
She was not obliged to go to the Tredgold College, because as yet
the College had not settled down for the session.  She was
supposed to be reading at home, and after breakfast she strolled
into the vegetable garden, and having taken up a position upon
the staging of a disused greenhouse that had the double advantage
of being hidden from the windows of the house and secure from the
sudden appearance of any one, she resumed the reading of Mr.
Manning's letter.
<P>
Mr. Manning's handwriting had an air of being clear without being
easily legible; it was large and rather roundish, with a lack of
definition about the letters and a disposition to treat the large
ones as liberal-minded people nowadays treat opinions, as all
amounting to the same thing really--a years-smoothed boyish
rather than an adult hand.  And it filled seven sheets of
notepaper, each written only on one side.
<P>
<P>
"MY DEAR MISS STANLEY," it began,--"I hope you will forgive my
bothering you with a letter, but I have been thinking very much
over our conversation at Lady Palsworthy's, and I feel there are
things I want to say to you so much that I cannot wait until we
meet again.  It is the worst of talk under such social
circumstances that it is always getting cut off so soon as it is
beginning; and I went home that afternoon feeling I had said
nothing--literally nothing--of the things I had meant to say to
you and that were coursing through my head.  They were things I
had meant very much to talk to you about, so that I went home
vexed and disappointed, and only relieved myself a little by
writing a few verses.  I wonder if you will mind very much when I
tell you they were suggested by you.  You must forgive the poet's
license I take.  Here is one verse.  The metrical irregularity is
intentional, because I want, as it were, to put you apart: to
change the lilt and the mood altogether when I speak of you.
<P>
     " 'A SONG OF LADIES AND MY LADY
<P>
     " 'Saintly white and a lily is Mary,
           Margaret's violets, sweet and shy;
      Green and dewy is Nellie-bud fairy,
           Forget-me-nots live in Gwendolen's eye.
      Annabel shines like a star in the darkness,
           Rosamund queens it a rose, deep rose;
      But the lady I love is like sunshine in April weather,     
<P>
    She gleams and gladdens, she warms--and goes.'
<P>
"Crude, I admit.  But let that verse tell my secret.  All bad
verse--originally the epigram was Lang's, I believe--is written
in a state of emotion.
<P>
"My dear Miss Stanley, when I talked to you the other afternoon
of work and politics and such-like things, my mind was all the
time resenting it beyond measure.  There we were discussing
whether you should have a vote, and I remembered the last
occasion we met it was about your prospects of success in the
medical profession or as a Government official such as a number
of women now are, and all the time my heart was crying out within
me, 'Here is the Queen of your career.'  I wanted, as I have
never wanted before, to take you up, to make you mine, to carry
you off and set you apart from all the strain and turmoil of
life.  For nothing will ever convince me that it is not the man's
share in life to shield, to protect, to lead and toil and watch
and battle with the world at large.  I want to be your knight,
your servant, your protector, your--I dare scarcely write the
word--your husband.  So I come suppliant.  I am five-and-thirty,
and I have knocked about in the world and tasted the quality of
life.  I had a hard fight to begin with to win my way into the
Upper Division--I was third on a list of forty-seven--and since
then I have found myself promoted almost yearly in a widening
sphere of social service.  Before I met you I never met any one
whom I felt I could love, but you have discovered depths in my
own nature I had scarcely suspected.  Except for a few early
ebullitions of passion, natural to a warm and romantic
disposition, and leaving no harmful after-effects--ebullitions
that by the standards of the higher truth I feel no one can
justly cast a stone at, and of which I for one am by no means
ashamed--I come to you a pure and unencumbered man.  I love you. 
In addition to my public salary I have a certain private property
and further expectations through my aunt, so that I can offer you
a life of wide and generous refinement, travel, books,
discussion, and easy relations with a circle of clever and
brilliant and thoughtful people with whom my literary work has
brought me into contact, and of which, seeing me only as you have
done alone in Morningside Park, you can have no idea. I have a
certain standing not only as a singer but as a critic, and I
belong to one of the most brilliant causerie dinner clubs of the
day, in which successful Bohemianism, politicians, men of
affairs, artists, sculptors, and cultivated noblemen generally,
mingle together in the easiest and most delightful intercourse. 
That is my real milieu, and one that I am convinced you would not
only adorn but delight in.
<P>
"I find it very hard to write this letter.  There are so many
things I want to tell you, and they stand on such different
levels, that the effect is necessarily confusing and discordant,
and I find myself doubting if I am really giving you the thread
of emotion that should run through all this letter.  For although
I must confess it reads very much like an application or a
testimonial or some such thing as that, I can assure you I am
writing this in fear and trembling with a sinking heart.  My mind
is full of ideas and images that I have been cherishing and
accumulating--dreams of travelling side by side, of lunching
quietly together in some jolly restaurant, of moonlight and music
and all that side of life, of seeing you dressed like a queen and
shining in some brilliant throng--mine; of your looking at
flowers in some old-world garden, our garden--there are splendid
places to be got down in Surrey, and a little runabout motor is
quite within my means.  You know they say, as, indeed, I have
just quoted already, that all bad poetry is written in a state of
emotion, but I have no doubt that this is true of bad offers of
marriage.  I have often felt before that it is only when one has
nothing to say that one can write easy poetry.  Witness Browning.
And how can I get into one brief letter the complex accumulated
desires of what is now, I find on reference to my diary, nearly
sixteen months of letting my mind run on you--ever since that
jolly party at Surbiton, where we raced and beat the other boat. 
You steered and I rowed stroke.  My very sentences stumble and
give way.  But I do not even care if I am absurd.  I am a
resolute man, and hitherto when I have wanted a thing I have got
it; but I have never yet wanted anything in my life as I have
wanted you.  It isn't the same thing.  I am afraid because I love
you, so that the mere thought of failure hurts.  If I did not
love you so much I believe I could win you by sheer force of
character, for people tell me I am naturally of the dominating
type.  Most of my successes in life have been made with a sort of
reckless vigor.
<P>
"Well, I have said what I had to say, stumblingly and badly, and
baldly.  But I am sick of tearing up letters and hopeless of
getting what I have to say better said.  It would be easy enough
for me to write an eloquent letter about something else.  Only I
do not care to write about anything else.  Let me put the main
question to you now that I could not put the other afternoon. 
Will you marry me, Ann Veronica?           
                                Very sincerely yours, 
                                "HUBERT MANNING."
<P>
<P>
Ann Veronica read this letter through with grave, attentive eyes.
<P>
Her interest grew as she read, a certain distaste disappeared. 
Twice she smiled, but not unkindly.  Then she went back and mixed
up the sheets in a search for particular passages.  Finally she
fell into reflection.
<P>
"Odd!" she said.  "I suppose I shall have to write an answer. 
It's so different from what one has been led to expect."
<P>
She became aware of her aunt, through the panes of the
greenhouse, advancing with an air of serene unconsciousness from
among the raspberry canes.
<P>
"No you don't!" said Ann Veronica, and walked out at a brisk and
business-like pace toward the house.
<P>
"I'm going for a long tramp, auntie," she said.
<P>
"Alone, dear?"
<P>
"Yes, aunt.  I've got a lot of things to think about."
<P>
Miss Stanley reflected as Ann Veronica went toward the house. 
She thought her niece very hard and very self-possessed and
self-confident.  She ought to be softened and tender and
confidential at this phase of her life.  She seemed to have no
idea whatever of the emotional states that were becoming to her
age and position.  Miss Stanley walked round the garden thinking,
and presently house and garden reverberated to Ann Veronica's
slamming of the front door.
<P>
"I wonder!" said Miss Stanley.
<P>
For a long time she surveyed a row of towering holly-hocks, as
though they offered an explanation.  Then she went in and
up-stairs, hesitated on the landing, and finally, a little
breathless and with an air of great dignity, opened the door and
walked into Ann Veronica's room. It was a neat, efficient-looking
room, with a writing-table placed with a business-like regard to
the window, and a bookcase surmounted by a pig's skull, a
dissected frog in a sealed bottle, and a pile of shiny,
black-covered note-books.  In the corner of the room were two
hockey-sticks and a tennis-racket, and upon the walls Ann
Veronica, by means of autotypes, had indicated her proclivities
in art.  But Miss Stanley took no notice of these things.  She
walked straight across to the wardrobe and opened it.  There,
hanging among Ann Veronica's more normal clothing, was a skimpy
dress of red canvas, trimmed with cheap and tawdry braid, and
short--it could hardly reach below the knee. On the same peg and
evidently belonging to it was a black velvet Zouave jacket.  And
then! a garment that was conceivably a secondary skirt.
<P>
Miss Stanley hesitated, and took first one and then another of
the constituents of this costume off its peg and surveyed it.
<P>
The third item she took with a trembling hand by its waistbelt. 
As she raised it, its lower portion fell apart into two baggy
crimson masses.
<P>
"TROUSERS!" she whispered.
<P>
Her eyes travelled about the room as if in appeal to the very
chairs.
<P>
Tucked under the writing-table a pair of yellow and gold Turkish
slippers of a highly meretricious quality caught her eye.  She
walked over to them still carrying the trousers in her hands, and
stooped to examine them.  They were ingenious disguises of gilt
paper destructively gummed, it would seem, to Ann Veronicas' best
dancing-slippers.
<P>
Then she reverted to the trousers.
<P>
"How CAN I tell him?" whispered Miss Stanley.
<P>
<P>
Part 2
<P>
<P>
Ann Veronica carried a light but business-like walking-stick. 
She walked with an easy quickness down the Avenue and through the
proletarian portion of Morningside Park, and crossing these
fields came into a pretty overhung lane that led toward
Caddington and the Downs.  And then her pace slackened.  She
tucked her stick under her arm and re-read Manning's letter.
<P>
"Let me think," said Ann Veronica.  "I wish this hadn't turned up
to-day of all days."
<P>
She found it difficult to begin thinking, and indeed she was
anything but clear what it was she had to think about. 
Practically it was most of the chief interests in life that she
proposed to settle in this pedestrian meditation.  Primarily it
was her own problem, and in particular the answer she had to give
to Mr. Manning's letter, but in order to get data for that she
found that she, having a logical and ordered mind, had to decide
upon the general relations of men to women, the objects and
conditions of marriage and its bearing upon the welfare of the
race, the purpose of the race, the purpose, if any, of
everything. . . .
<P>
"Frightful lot of things aren't settled," said Ann Veronica.  In
addition, the Fadden Dance business, all out of proportion,
occupied the whole foreground of her thoughts and threw a color
of rebellion over everything.  She kept thinking she was thinking
about Mr. Manning's proposal of marriage and finding she was
thinking of the dance.
<P>
For a time her efforts to achieve a comprehensive concentration
were dispersed by the passage of the village street of
Caddington, the passing of a goggled car-load of motorists, and
the struggles of a stable lad mounted on one recalcitrant horse
and leading another.  When she got back to her questions again in
the monotonous high-road that led up the hill, she found the
image of Mr. Manning central in her mind. He stood there, large
and dark, enunciating, in his clear voice from beneath his large
mustache, clear flat sentences, deliberately kindly.  He
proposed, he wanted to possess her!  He loved her.
<P>
Ann Veronica felt no repulsion at the prospect. That Mr. Manning
loved her presented itself to her bloodlessly, stilled from any
imaginative quiver or thrill of passion or disgust.  The
relationship seemed to have almost as much to do with blood and
body as a mortgage.  It was something that would create a mutual
claim, a relationship.  It was in another world from that in
which men will die for a kiss, and touching hands lights fires
that burn up lives--the world of romance, the world of
passionately beautiful things.
<P>
But that other world, in spite of her resolute exclusion of it,
was always looking round corners and peeping through chinks and
crannies, and rustling and raiding into the order in which she
chose to live, shining out of pictures at her, echoing in lyrics
and music; it invaded her dreams, it wrote up broken and
enigmatical sentences upon the passage walls of her mind.  She
was aware of it now as if it were a voice shouting outside a
house, shouting passionate verities in a hot sunlight, a voice
that cries while people talk insincerely in a darkened room and
pretend not to hear.  Its shouting now did in some occult manner
convey a protest that Mr. Manning would on no account do, though
he was tall and dark and handsome and kind, and thirty-five and
adequately prosperous, and all that a husband should be.  But
there was, it insisted, no mobility in his face, no movement,
nothing about him that warmed.  If Ann Veronica could have put
words to that song they would have been, "Hot-blooded marriage or
none!" but she was far too indistinct in this matter to frame any
words at all.
<P>
"I don't love him," said Ann Veronica, getting a gleam.  "I don't
see that his being a good sort matters. That really settles about
that. . . .  But it means no end of a row."
<P>
For a time she sat on a rail before leaving the road for the
downland turf.  "But I wish," she said, "I had some idea what I
was really up to."
<P>
Her thoughts went into solution for a time, while she listened to
a lark singing.
<P>
"Marriage and mothering," said Ann Veronica, with her mind
crystallizing out again as the lark dropped to the nest in the
turf.  "And all the rest of it perhaps is a song."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 3
<P>
<P>
Her mind got back to the Fadden Ball.
<P>
She meant to go, she meant to go, she meant to go. Nothing would
stop her, and she was prepared to face the consequences.  Suppose
her father turned her out of doors!  She did not care, she meant
to go.  She would just walk out of the house and go. . . .
<P>
She thought of her costume in some detail and with considerable
satisfaction, and particularly of a very jolly property dagger
with large glass jewels in the handle, that reposed in a drawer
in her room.  She was to be a Corsair's Bride.  "Fancy stabbing a
man for jealousy!" she thought.  "You'd have to think how to get
in between his bones."
<P>
She thought of her father, and with an effort dismissed him from
her mind.
<P>
She tried to imagine the collective effect of the Fadden Ball;
she had never seen a fancy-dress gathering in her life.  Mr.
Manning came into her thoughts again, an unexpected, tall, dark,
self-contained presence at the Fadden.  One might suppose him
turning up; he knew a lot of clever people, and some of them
might belong to the class.  What would he come as?
<P>
Presently she roused herself with a guilty start from the task of
dressing and re-dressing Mr. Manning in fancy costume, as though
he was a doll.  She had tried him  as a Crusader, in which guise
he seemed plausible but heavy--"There IS something heavy about
him; I wonder if it's his mustache?"--and as a Hussar, which made
him preposterous, and as a Black Brunswicker, which was better,
and as an Arab sheik.  Also she had tried him as a dragoman and
as a gendarme, which seemed the most suitable of all to his
severely handsome, immobile profile.  She felt he would tell
people the way, control traffic, and refuse admission to public
buildings with invincible correctness and the very finest
explicit feelings possible.  For each costume she had devised a
suitable form of matrimonial refusal.  "Oh, Lord!" she said,
discovering what she was up to, and dropped lightly from the
fence upon the turf and went on her way toward the crest.
<P>
"I shall never marry," said Ann Veronica, resolutely; "I'm not
the sort.  That's why it's so important I should take my own line
now."
<P>
<P>
Part 4
<P>
<P>
Ann Veronica's ideas of marriage were limited and unsystematic. 
Her teachers and mistresses had done their best to stamp her mind
with an ineradicable persuasion that it was tremendously
important, and on no account to be thought about.  Her first
intimations of marriage as a fact of extreme significance in a
woman's life had come with the marriage of Alice and the
elopement of her second sister, Gwen.
<P>
These convulsions occurred when Ann Veronica was about twelve. 
There was a gulf of eight years between her and the youngest of
her brace of sisters--an impassable gulf inhabited chaotically by
two noisy brothers. These sisters moved in a grown-up world
inaccessible to Ann Veronica's sympathies, and to a large extent
remote from her curiosity.  She got into rows through meddling
with their shoes and tennis-rackets, and had moments of carefully
concealed admiration when she was privileged to see them just
before her bedtime, rather radiantly dressed in white or pink or
amber and prepared to go out with her mother.  She thought Alice
a bit of a sneak, an opinion her brothers shared, and Gwen rather
a snatch at meals.  She saw nothing of their love-making, and
came home from her boarding-school in a state of decently
suppressed curiosity for Alice's wedding.
<P>
Her impressions of this cardinal ceremony were rich and confused,
complicated by a quite transitory passion that awakened no
reciprocal fire for a fat curly headed cousin in black velveteen
and a lace collar, who assisted as a page.  She followed him
about persistently, and succeeded, after a brisk, unchivalrous
struggle (in which he pinched and asked her to "cheese it"), in
kissing him among the raspberries behind the greenhouse. 
Afterward her brother Roddy, also strange in velveteen, feeling
rather than knowing of this relationship, punched this Adonis's
head.
<P>
A marriage in the house proved to be exciting but extremely
disorganizing.  Everything seemed designed to unhinge the mind
and make the cat wretched.  All the furniture was moved, all the
meals were disarranged, and everybody, Ann Veronica included,
appeared in new, bright costumes.  She had to wear cream and a
brown sash and a short frock and her hair down, and Gwen cream
and a brown sash and a long skirt and her hair up. And her
mother, looking unusually alert and hectic, wore cream and brown
also, made up in a more complicated manner.
<P>
Ann Veronica was much impressed by a mighty trying on and
altering and fussing about Alice's "things"--Alice was being
re-costumed from garret to cellar, with a walking-dress and
walking-boots to measure, and a bride's costume of the most
ravishing description, and stockings and such like beyond the
dreams of avarice --and a constant and increasing dripping into
the house of irrelevant remarkable objects, such as--
<P>
Real lace bedspread;
<P>
Gilt travelling clock;
<P>
Ornamental pewter plaque;
<P>
Salad bowl (silver mounted) and servers;
<P>
Madgett's "English Poets" (twelve volumes), bound purple morocco;
<P>
Etc., etc.
<P>
Through all this flutter of novelty there came and went a
solicitous, preoccupied, almost depressed figure. It was Doctor
Ralph, formerly the partner of Doctor Stickell in the Avenue, and
now with a thriving practice of his own in Wamblesmith.  He had
shaved his side-whiskers and come over in flannels, but he was
still indisputably the same person who had attended Ann Veronica
for the measles and when she swallowed the fish-bone.  But his
role was altered, and he was now playing the bridegroom in this
remarkable drama. Alice was going to be Mrs. Ralph.  He came in
apologetically; all the old "Well, and how ARE we?" note gone;
and once he asked Ann Veronica, almost furtively,
<P>
"How's Alice getting on, Vee?"  Finally, on the Day, he appeared
like his old professional self transfigured, in the most
beautiful light gray trousers Ann Veronica had ever seen and a
new shiny silk hat with a most becoming roll. . . .
<P>
It was not simply that all the rooms were rearranged and
everybody dressed in unusual fashions, and all the routines of
life abolished and put away: people's tempers and emotions also
seemed strangely disturbed and shifted about.  Her father was
distinctly irascible, and disposed more than ever to hide away
among the petrological things--the study was turned out.  At
table he carved in a gloomy but resolute manner.  On the Day he
had trumpet-like outbreaks of cordiality, varied by a watchful
preoccupation.  Gwen and Alice were fantastically friendly, which
seemed to annoy him, and Mrs. Stanley was throughout enigmatical,
with an anxious eye on her husband and Alice.
<P>
There was a confused impression of livery carriages and whips
with white favors, people fussily wanting other people to get in
before them, and then the church. People sat in unusual pews, and
a wide margin of hassocky emptiness intervened between the
ceremony and the walls.
<P>
Ann Veronica had a number of fragmentary impressions of Alice
strangely transfigured in bridal raiment. It seemed to make her
sister downcast beyond any precedent.  The bridesmaids and pages
got rather jumbled in the aisle, and she had an effect of Alice's
white back and sloping shoulders and veiled head receding toward
the altar.  In some incomprehensible way that back view made her
feel sorry for Alice.  Also she remembered very vividly the smell
of orange blossom, and Alice, drooping and spiritless, mumbling
responses, facing Doctor Ralph, while the Rev. Edward Bribble
stood between them with an open book.  Doctor Ralph looked kind
and large, and listened to Alice's responses as though he was
listening to symptoms and thought that on the whole she was
progressing favorably.
<P>
And afterward her mother and Alice kissed long and clung to each
other.  And Doctor Ralph stood by looking considerate.  He and
her father shook hands manfully.
<P>
Ann Veronica had got quite interested in Mr. Bribble's rendering
of the service--he had the sort of voice that brings out
things--and was still teeming with ideas about it when finally a
wild outburst from the organ made it clear that, whatever
snivelling there might be down in the chancel, that excellent
wind instrument was, in its Mendelssohnian way, as glad as ever
it could be. "Pump, pump, per-um-pump, Pum, Pump, Per-um. . . ."
<P>
The wedding-breakfast was for Ann Veronica a spectacle of the
unreal consuming the real; she liked that part very well, until
she was carelessly served against her expressed wishes with
mayonnaise.  She was caught by an uncle, whose opinion she
valued, making faces at Roddy because he had exulted at this.
<P>
Of the vast mass of these impressions Ann Veronica could make
nothing at the time; there they were--Fact! She stored them away
in a mind naturally retentive, as a squirrel stores away nuts,
for further digestion.  Only one thing emerged with any
reasonable clarity in her mind at once, and that was that unless
she was saved from drowning by an unmarried man, in which case
the ceremony is unavoidable, or totally destitute of under-
clothing, and so driven to get a trousseau, in which hardship a
trousseau would certainly be "ripping," marriage was an
experience to be strenuously evaded.
<P>
When they were going home she asked her mother why she and Gwen
and Alice had cried.
<P>
"Ssh!" said her mother, and then added, "A little natural
feeling, dear."
<P>
"But didn't Alice want to marry Doctor Ralph?"
<P>
"Oh, ssh, Vee!" said her mother, with an evasion as patent as an
advertisement board.  "I am sure she will be very happy indeed
with Doctor Ralph."
<P>
But Ann Veronica was by no means sure of that until she went over
to Wamblesmith and saw her sister, very remote and domestic and
authoritative, in a becoming tea-gown, in command of Doctor
Ralph's home.  Doctor Ralph came in to tea and put his arm round
Alice and kissed her, and Alice called him "Squiggles," and stood
in the shelter of his arms for a moment with an expression of
satisfied proprietorship.  She HAD cried, Ann Veronica knew. 
There had been fusses and scenes dimly apprehended through
half-open doors.  She had heard Alice talking and crying at the
same time, a painful noise.  Perhaps marriage hurt.  But now it
was all over, and Alice was getting on well.  It reminded Ann
Veronica of having a tooth stopped.
<P>
And after that Alice became remoter than ever, and, after a time,
ill.  Then she had a baby and became as old as any really
grown-up person, or older, and very dull.  Then she and her
husband went off to a Yorkshire practice, and had four more
babies, none of whom  photographed well, and so she passed beyond
the sphere of Ann Veronica's sympathies altogether.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 5
<P>
<P>
The Gwen affair happened when she was away at school at
Marticombe-on-Sea, a term before she went to the High School, and
was never very clear to her.
<P>
Her mother missed writing for a week, and then she wrote in an
unusual key.  "My dear," the letter ran, "I have to tell you that
your sister Gwen has offended your father very much.  I hope you
will always love her, but I want you to remember she has offended
your father and married without his consent.  Your father is very
angry, and will not have her name mentioned in his hearing.  She
has married some one he could not approve of, and gone right
away. . . ."
<P>
When the next holidays came Ann Veronica's mother was ill, and
Gwen was in the sick-room when Ann Veronica returned home.  She
was in one of her old walking-dresses, her hair was done in an
unfamiliar manner, she wore a wedding-ring, and she looked as if
she had been crying.
<P>
"Hello, Gwen!" said Ann Veronica, trying to put every one at
their ease.  "Been and married? . . . What's the name of the
happy man?"
<P>
Gwen owned to "Fortescue."
<P>
"Got a photograph of him or anything?" said Ann Veronica, after
kissing her mother.
<P>
Gwen made an inquiry, and, directed by Mrs. Stanley, produced a
portrait from its hiding-place in the jewel-drawer under the
mirror.  It presented a clean-shaven face with a large Corinthian
nose, hair tremendously waving off the forehead and more chin and
neck than is good for a man.
<P>
"LOOKS all right," said Ann Veronica, regarding him with her head
first on one side and then on the other, and trying to be
agreeable.  "What's the objection?"
<P>
"I suppose she ought to know?" said Gwen to her mother, trying to
alter the key of the conversation.
<P>
"You see, Vee," said Mrs. Stanley, "Mr. Fortescue is an actor,
and your father does not approve of the profession."
<P>
"Oh!" said Ann Veronica.  "I thought they made knights of
actors?"
<P>
"They may of Hal some day," said Gwen.  "But it's a long
business."
<P>
"I suppose this makes you an actress?" said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"I don't know whether I shall go on," said Gwen, a novel note of
languorous professionalism creeping into her voice.  "The other
women don't much like it if husband and wife work together, and I
don't think Hal would like me to act away from him."
<P>
Ann Veronica regarded her sister with a new respect, but the
traditions of family life are strong.  "I don't suppose you'll be
able to do it much," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
Later Gwen's trouble weighed so heavily on Mrs. Stanley in her
illness that her husband consented to receive Mr. Fortescue in
the drawing-room, and actually shake hands with him in an
entirely hopeless manner and hope everything would turn out for
the best.
<P>
The forgiveness and reconciliation was a cold and formal affair,
and afterwards her father went off gloomily to his study, and Mr.
Fortescue rambled round the garden with soft, propitiatory steps,
the Corinthian nose upraised and his hands behind his back,
pausing to look long and hard at the fruit-trees against the
wall.
<P>
Ann Veronica watched him from the dining-room window, and after
some moments of maidenly hesitation rambled out into the garden
in a reverse direction to Mr. Fortescue's steps, and encountered
him with an air of artless surprise.
<P>
"Hello!" said Ann Veronica, with arms akimbo and a careless,
breathless manner.  "You Mr. Fortescue?"
<P>
"At your service.  You Ann Veronica?"
<P>
"Rather!  I say--did you marry Gwen?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Why?"
<P>
Mr. Fortescue raised his eyebrows and assumed a light-comedy
expression.  "I suppose I fell in love with her, Ann Veronica."
<P>
"Rum," said Ann Veronica.  "Have you got to keep her now?"
<P>
"To the best of my ability," said Mr. Fortescue, with a bow.
<P>
"Have you much ability?" asked Ann Veronica.
<P>
Mr. Fortescue tried to act embarrassment in order to conceal its
reality, and Ann Veronica went on to ask a string of questions
about acting, and whether her sister would act, and was she
beautiful enough for it, and who would make her dresses, and so
on.
<P>
As a matter of fact Mr. Fortescue had not much ability to keep
her sister, and a little while after her mother's death Ann
Veronica met Gwen suddenly on the staircase coming from her
father's study, shockingly dingy in dusty mourning and tearful
and resentful, and after that Gwen receded from the Morningside
Park world, and not even the begging letters and distressful
communications that her father and aunt received, but only a
vague intimation of dreadfulness, a leakage of incidental
comment, flashes of paternal anger at "that blackguard," came to
Ann Veronica's ears.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 6
<P>
<P>
These were Ann Veronica's leading cases in the question of
marriage.  They were the only real marriages she had seen
clearly.  For the rest, she derived her ideas of the married
state from the observed behavior of married women, which
impressed her in Morningside Park as being tied and dull and
inelastic in comparison with the life of the young, and from a
remarkably various reading among books.  As a net result she had
come to think of all married people much as one thinks of insects
that have lost their wings, and of her sisters as new hatched
creatures who had scarcely for a moment had wings.  She evolved a
dim image of herself cooped up in a house under the benevolent
shadow of Mr. Manning.  Who knows?--on the analogy of "Squiggles"
she might come to call him "Mangles!"
<P>
"I don't think I can ever marry any one," she said, and fell
suddenly into another set of considerations that perplexed her
for a time.  Had romance to be banished from life? . . .
<P>
It was hard to part with romance, but she had never thirsted so
keenly to go on with her University work in her life as she did
that day.  She had never felt so acutely the desire for free
initiative, for a life unhampered by others.  At any cost!  Her
brothers had it practically--at least they had it far more than
it seemed likely she would unless she exerted herself with quite
exceptional vigor.  Between her and the fair, far prospect of
freedom and self-development manoeuvred Mr. Manning, her aunt and
father, neighbors, customs, traditions, forces.  They seemed to
her that morning to be all armed with nets and prepared to throw
them over her directly her movements became in any manner truly
free.
<P>
She had a feeling as though something had dropped from her eyes,
as though she had just discovered herself for the first
time--discovered herself as a sleep-walker might do, abruptly
among dangers, hindrances, and perplexities, on the verge of a
cardinal crisis.
<P>
The life of a girl presented itself to her as something happy and
heedless and unthinking, yet really guided and controlled by
others, and going on amidst unsuspected screens and concealments.
<P>
And in its way it was very well.  Then suddenly with a rush came
reality, came "growing up"; a hasty imperative appeal for
seriousness, for supreme seriousness.  The Ralphs and Mannings
and Fortescues came down upon the raw inexperience, upon the
blinking ignorance of the newcomer; and before her eyes were
fairly open, before she knew what had happened, a new set of
guides and controls, a new set of obligations and
responsibilities and limitations, had replaced the old.  "I want
to be a Person," said Ann Veronica to the downs and the open sky;
"I will not have this happen to me, whatever else may happen in
its place."
<P>
Ann Veronica had three things very definitely settled by the time
when, a little after mid-day, she found herself perched up on a
gate between a bridle-path and a field that commanded the whole
wide stretch of country between Chalking and Waldersham. 
Firstly, she did not intend to marry at all, and particularly she
did not mean to marry Mr. Manning; secondly, by some measure or
other, she meant to go on with her studies, not at the Tredgold
Schools but at the Imperial College; and, thirdly, she was, as an
immediate and decisive act, a symbol of just exactly where she
stood, a declaration of free and adult initiative, going that
night to the Fadden Ball.
<P>
But the possible attitude of her father she had still to face. 
So far she had the utmost difficulty in getting on to that
vitally important matter.  The whole of that relationship
persisted in remaining obscure.  What would happen when next
morning she returned to Morningside Park?
<P>
He couldn't turn her out of doors.  But what he could do or might
do she could not imagine.  She was not afraid of violence, but
she was afraid of something mean, some secondary kind of force. 
Suppose he stopped all her allowance, made it imperative that she
should either stay ineffectually resentful at home or earn a
living for herself at once. . . .  It appeared highly probable to
her that he would stop her allowance.
<P>
What can a girl do?
<P>
Somewhere at this point Ann Veronica's speculations were
interrupted and turned aside by the approach of a horse and
rider.  Mr. Ramage, that iron-gray man of the world, appeared
dressed in a bowler hat and a suit of hard gray, astride of a
black horse.  He pulled rein at the sight of her, saluted, and
regarded her with his rather too protuberant eyes.  The girl's
gaze met his in interested inquiry.
<P>
"You've got my view," he said, after a pensive second.  "I always
get off here and lean over that rail for a bit.  May I do so
to-day?"
<P>
"It's your gate," she said, amiably; "you got it first.  It's for
you to say if I may sit on it."
<P>
He slipped off the horse.  "Let me introduce you to Caesar," he
said; and she patted Caesar's neck, and remarked how soft his
nose was, and secretly deplored the ugliness of equine teeth. 
Ramage tethered the horse to the farther gate-post, and Caesar
blew heavily and began to investigate the hedge.
<P>
Ramage leaned over the gate at Ann Veronica's side, and for a
moment there was silence.
<P>
He made some obvious comments on the wide view warming toward its
autumnal blaze that spread itself in hill and valley, wood and
village, below.
<P>
"It's as broad as life," said Mr. Ramage, regarding it and
putting a well-booted foot up on the bottom rail.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 7
<P>
<P>
"And what are you doing here, young lady," he said, looking up at
her face, "wandering alone so far from home?"
<P>
"I like long walks," said Ann Veronica, looking down on him.
<P>
"Solitary walks?"
<P>
"That's the point of them.  I think over all sorts of things."
<P>
"Problems?"
<P>
"Sometimes quite difficult problems."
<P>
"You're lucky to live in an age when you can do so. Your mother,
for instance, couldn't.  She had to do her thinking at
home--under inspection."
<P>
She looked down on him thoughtfully, and he let his admiration of
her free young poise show in his face.
<P>
"I suppose things have changed?" she said.
<P>
"Never was such an age of transition."
<P>
She wondered what to.  Mr. Ramage did not know. "Sufficient unto
me is the change thereof," he said, with all the effect of an
epigram.
<P>
"I must confess," he said, "the New Woman and the New Girl
intrigue me profoundly.  I am one of those people who are
interested in women, more interested than I am in anything else. 
I don't conceal it.  And the change, the change of attitude!  The
way all the old clingingness has been thrown aside is amazing. 
And all the old--the old trick of shrinking up like a snail at a
touch.  If you had lived twenty years ago you would have been
called a Young Person, and it would have been your chief duty in
life not to know, never to have heard of, and never to
understand."
<P>
"There's quite enough still," said Ann Veronica, smiling, "that
one doesn't understand."
<P>
"Quite.  But your role would have been to go about saying, 'I beg
your pardon' in a reproving tone to things you understood quite
well in your heart and saw no harm in.  That terrible Young
Person! she's vanished. Lost, stolen, or strayed, the Young
Person! . . .  I hope we may never find her again."
<P>
He rejoiced over this emancipation.  "While that lamb was about
every man of any spirit was regarded as a dangerous wolf.  We
wore invisible chains and invisible blinkers.  Now, you and I can
gossip at a gate, and {}Honi soit qui mal y pense.  The change
has
given man one good thing he never had before," he said. "Girl
friends.  And I am coming to believe the best as well as the most
beautiful friends a man can have are girl friends."
<P>
He paused, and went on, after a keen look at her:
<P>
"I had rather gossip to a really intelligent girl than to any man
alive."
<P>
"I suppose we ARE more free than we were?" said Ann Veronica,
keeping the question general.
<P>
"Oh, there's no doubt of it!  Since the girls of the eighties
broke bounds and sailed away on bicycles--my young days go back
to the very beginnings of that--it's been one triumphant
relaxation."
<P>
"Relaxation, perhaps.  But are we any more free?"
<P>
"Well?"
<P>
"I mean we've long strings to tether us, but we are bound all the
same.  A woman isn't much freer--in reality."
<P>
Mr. Ramage demurred.
<P>
"One runs about," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"But it's on condition one doesn't do anything."
<P>
"Do what?"
<P>
"Oh!--anything."
<P>
He looked interrogation with a faint smile.
<P>
"It seems to me it comes to earning one's living in the long
run," said Ann Veronica, coloring faintly.  "Until a girl can go
away as a son does and earn her independent income, she's still
on a string.  It may be a long string, long enough if you like to
tangle up all sorts of people; but there it is!  If the paymaster
pulls, home she must go.  That's what I mean."
<P>
Mr. Ramage admitted the force of that.  He was a little impressed
by Ann Veronica's metaphor of the string, which, indeed, she owed
to Hetty Widgett. "YOU wouldn't like to be independent?" he
asked, abruptly.  "I mean REALLY independent.  On your own. It
isn't such fun as it seems."
<P>
"Every one wants to be independent," said Ann Veronica.  "Every
one.  Man or woman."
<P>
"And you?"
<P>
"Rather!"
<P>
"I wonder why?"
<P>
"There's no why.  It's just to feel--one owns one's self."
<P>
"Nobody does that," said Ramage, and kept silence for a moment.
<P>
"But a boy--a boy goes out into the world and presently stands on
his own feet.  He buys his own clothes, chooses his own company,
makes his own way of living."
<P>
"You'd like to do that?"
<P>
"Exactly."
<P>
"Would you like to be a boy?"
<P>
"I wonder!  It's out of the question, any way."
<P>
Ramage reflected.  "Why don't you?"
<P>
"Well, it might mean rather a row."
<P>
"I know--" said Ramage, with sympathy.
<P>
"And besides," said Ann Veronica, sweeping that aspect aside,
"what could I do?  A boy sails out into a trade or profession. 
But--it's one of the things I've just been thinking over. 
Suppose--suppose a girl did want to start in life, start in life
for herself--"  She looked him frankly in the eyes.  "What ought
she to do?"
<P>
"Suppose you--"
<P>
"Yes, suppose I--"
<P>
He felt that his advice was being asked.  He became a little more
personal and intimate.  "I wonder what you could do?" he said. 
"I should think YOU could do all sorts of things. . . .
<P>
"What ought you to do?"  He began to produce his knowledge of the
world for her benefit, jerkily and allusively, and with a strong,
rank flavor of "savoir faire."  He took an optimist view of her
chances.  Ann Veronica listened thoughtfully, with her eyes on
the turf, and now and then she asked a question or looked up to
discuss a point.  In the meanwhile, as he talked, he scrutinized
her face, ran his eyes over her careless, gracious poise,
wondered hard about her.  He described her privately to himself
as a splendid girl.  It was clear she wanted to get away from
home, that she was impatient to get away from home.  Why?  While
the front of his mind was busy warning her not to fall into the
hopeless miseries of underpaid teaching, and explaining his idea
that for women of initiative, quite as much as for men, the world
of business had by far the best chances, the back chambers of his
brain were busy with the problem of that "Why?"
<P>
His first idea as a man of the world was to explain her unrest by
a lover, some secret or forbidden or impossible lover.  But he
dismissed that because then she would ask her lover and not him
all these things.  Restlessness, then, was the trouble, simple
restlessness: home bored her.  He could quite understand the
daughter of Mr. Stanley being bored and feeling limited.  But was
that enough?  Dim, formless suspicions of something more vital
wandered about his mind.  Was the young lady impatient for
experience?  Was she adventurous? As a man of the world he did
not think it becoming to accept maidenly calm as anything more
than a mask. Warm life was behind that always, even if it slept. 
If it was not an actual personal lover, it still might be the
lover not yet incarnate, not yet perhaps suspected. . . .
<P>
He had diverged only a little from the truth when he said that
his chief interest in life was women.  It wasn't so much women as
Woman that engaged his mind.  His was the Latin turn of thinking;
he had fallen in love at thirteen, and he was still capable--he
prided himself--of falling in love.  His invalid wife and her
money had been only the thin thread that held his life together;
beaded on that permanent relation had been an inter-weaving
series of other feminine experiences, disturbing, absorbing,
interesting, memorable affairs.  Each one had been different from
the others, each had had a quality all its own, a distinctive
freshness, a distinctive beauty.  He could not understand how men
could live ignoring this one predominant interest, this wonderful
research into personality and the possibilities of pleasing,
these complex, fascinating expeditions that began in interest and
mounted to the supremest, most passionate intimacy.  All the rest
of his existence was subordinate to this pursuit; he lived for
it, worked for it, kept himself in training for it.
<P>
So while he talked to this girl of work and freedom, his slightly
protuberant eyes were noting the gracious balance of her limbs
and body across the gate, the fine lines of her chin and neck. 
Her grave fine face, her warm clear complexion, had already
aroused his curiosity as he had gone to and fro in Morningside
Park, and here suddenly he was near to her and talking freely and
intimately.  He had found her in a communicative mood, and he
used the accumulated skill of years in turning that to account.
<P>
She was pleased and a little flattered by his interest and
sympathy.  She became eager to explain herself, to show herself
in the right light.  He was manifestly exerting his mind for her,
and she found herself fully disposed to justify his interest.
<P>
She, perhaps, displayed herself rather consciously as a fine
person unduly limited.  She even touched lightly on her father's
unreasonableness.
<P>
"I wonder," said Ramage, "that more girls don't think as you do
and want to strike out in the world."
<P>
And then he speculated.  "I wonder if you will?"
<P>
"Let me say one thing," he said.  "If ever you do and I can help
you in any way, by advice or inquiry or recommendation-- You see,
I'm no believer in feminine incapacity, but I do perceive there
is such a thing as feminine inexperience.  As a sex you're a
little under-trained--in affairs.  I'd take it--forgive me if I
seem a little urgent--as a sort of proof of friendliness.  I can
imagine nothing more pleasant in life than to help you, because I
know it would pay to help you.  There's something about you, a
little flavor of Will, I suppose, that makes one feel--good luck
about you and success. . . ."
<P>
And while he talked and watched her as he talked, she answered,
and behind her listening watched and thought about him.  She
liked the animated eagerness of his manner.
<P>
His mind seemed to be a remarkably full one; his knowledge of
detailed reality came in just where her own mind was most weakly
equipped.  Through all he said ran one quality that pleased
her--the quality of a man who feels that things can be done, that
one need not wait for the world to push one before one moved. 
Compared with her father and Mr. Manning and the men in "fixed"
positions generally that she knew, Ramage, presented by himself,
had a fine suggestion of freedom, of power, of deliberate and
sustained adventure. . . .
<P>
She was particularly charmed by his theory or friendship. It was
really very jolly to talk to a man in this way--who saw the woman
in her and did not treat her as a child.  She was inclined to
think that perhaps for a girl the converse of his method was the
case; an older man, a man beyond the range of anything
"nonsensical," was, perhaps, the most interesting sort of friend
one could meet.  But in that reservation it may be she went a
little beyond the converse of his view. . . .
<P>
They got on wonderfully well together.  They talked for the
better part of an hour, and at last walked together to the
junction of highroad and the bridle-path. There, after
protestations of friendliness and helpfulness that were almost
ardent, he mounted a little clumsily and rode off at an amiable
pace, looking his best, making a leg with his riding gaiters,
smiling and saluting, while Ann Veronica turned northward and so
came to Micklechesil. There, in a little tea and sweet-stuff
shop, she bought and consumed slowly and absent-mindedly the
insufficient nourishment that is natural to her sex on such
occasions.
