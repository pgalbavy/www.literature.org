<p>The American Indian rarely shows any emotion that may be stirring
his heart. I am sure, however, that if one could have had a look
at the face of Tall Bear when he made the discovery that neither
the brother nor sister was in the cabin he would have seen a picture
of as blank amazement as ever held a person speechless.</p>

<p>This was not caused so much by what the children had done as
by the course of the Sioux themselves, for nothing was plainer
to the chieftain than the manner in which Melville and Dot had
escaped.</p>

<p>They had been on the alert, and when the warriors hastened to
the top of the hill Melville Clarendon was bright enough to seize
the opportunity thus given. He had quietly stepped out of the
front door, where, in the gloom and the absorbing interest of
the red men in another direction, neither he nor the little girl
attracted notice. The two were doubtless making all haste from
the endangered spot.</p>

<p>But the chieftain was astounded over another discovery: in order
to make his search absolutely thorough he had caught up a smouldering
brand, quickly fanned it into a flame, and then explored the upper
and lower storys. Not a nook or corner was left unvisited, and
a hiding cat would have been brought to light.</p>

<p>That which almost knocked Tall Bear breathless was the fact that
he found nothing of the remains of Red Feather, who had entered
the chimney before the eyes of five of his own warriors.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Explored the upper and lower storys."]</p>

<p>The inference was certain: Red Feather had not been killed, but
had gone out of the front door just as the children had done.</p>

<p>Tall Bear was still far from suspecting the whole truth, though,
had he been left with nothing else on his mind for a short time
only, he must have divined, or at least suspected, what actually
took place.</p>

<p>But a party of horsemen were approaching, and must already be
close at hand. They required attention, for if they should prove
to be enemies, the chief would have his hands full. His position,
with a lighted torch within the building, was not the most prudent
he could take, and as he came outside he flung the light to the
ground where it sputtered out in the darkness.</p>

<p>Tall Bear's pony was standing where he had left him, and vaulting
lightly upon his back, he sent him on a gallop to the top of the
hill, to learn something about the new-comers.</p>

<p>The main party of warriors were some distance off, awaiting the
signal to know whether they were to fight or to join the parties
whose identity was still in doubt. The couple whom Tall Bear had
despatched to reconnoitre were still absent, so that he found
himself alone on the elevation.</p>

<p>It is at such times that the American Indian displays a wonderful
keenness of sight and hearing. The chief sat motionless, peering
into the gloom and listening. None could know better than he that
he had taken a most dangerous position.</p>

<p>If the horsemen, who could not be far off, were hostile, they
would surround the hill whereon they last saw the Sioux, and unless
Tall Bear kept his wits about him he was likely to be shut in
on every hand.</p>

<p>But it would have been hard for the most skilful Indian scout
to take him unawares. He was certain to see and hear the approach
of any one as soon as the latter could see or hear him, and the
chieftain was not the one to fall asleep under such circumstances.</p>

<p>Darting his penetrating glances here, there, and everywhere,
he suddenly fixed them upon a point directly ahead. Something
was vaguely assuming form in the gloom, and a minute later he
observed a man walking toward him.</p>

<p>Tall Bear leaned forward over the neck of his pony, that he might
not lose the advantage of an inch of space. The stranger was advancing
without any more noise than if he was a shadow, and he was alone,
or, if he had any companions, they were so far behind when he
was in full view as to be invisible.</p>

<p>The man on foot came to a halt while still too far off to be
more than faintly visible, and emitted a low tremulous whistle.
Tall Bear promptly answered in the same manner, and then the other
ran forward to his side. He was one of the two scouts the chief
had sent out, and he brought important tidings.</p>

<p>The party of horsemen which caused the Sioux such concern were
white men&mdash;every one&mdash;under the leadership of the famous frontier
scout Nat Trumbull. The warrior had ventured near enough to the
company to recognize his voice when he gave the order for his
men to move around to the south and approach the house from that
direction.</p>

<p>Trumbull was a veteran who had done good service during the lurid
summer of 1862, when the Sioux desolated a large portion of the
Minnesota frontier, and Tall Bear feared him more than any white
man living. He knew that if Trumbull and his rangers got a chance
at the Sioux they would force matters without mercy. No sooner,
therefore, did the Sioux scout tell what he had learned than Tall
Bear made up his mind that the best place for him and his warriors
was somewhere else. When he asked after the other scout who accompanied
the one that returned, the chieftain was told that he had ventured
so near the white men that he narrowly escaped capture, and was
forced to dodge off in another direction.</p>

<p>That was enough. Tall Bear wheeled his pony like a flash, and
galloped toward the point where he knew his warriors were awaiting
the news with as much anxiety as his own.</p>

<p>Such tidings travel fast, and within five minutes after the return
of the scout with his message Tall Bear and his warriors were
riding as if for life from the neighborhood.</p>

<p>It may as well be explained how it was that the relief which
Melville Clarendon expected hours before was so delayed that,
but for an unexpected occurrence, it would have arrived too late.</p>

<p>You have learned that Mr. Clarendon and his wife left their home
early that morning and hurried northward over the ten miles between
them and Barwell.</p>

<p>All went well until they had passed half the distance, when the
sudden appearance of three mounted Indians showed that they were
not likely to get through without trouble. The settler at once
came to a halt and prepared to make the best defence possible.
The animals were gathered near the wagon, where Mr. Clarendon
made his wife crouch down to escape the flying bullets, and, loaded
gun in hand, he waited the attack that was sure to come.</p>

<p>A skilful marksman in the situation of Mr. Clarendon generally
considers himself the equal of three mounted men on the open plain,
and the conduct of the warriors showed that they held the settler
in respect. Keeping beyond easy range, they circled about the
wagon and its inmates as if looking for an opening, and finally
all three brought their guns to their shoulders and let fly.</p>

<p>The volley killed one of the horses, which dropped dead as he
stood near the wagon.</p>

<p>The settler instantly returned the shot, and&mdash;rather curiously&mdash;though
the distance was considerable, he brought down the pony of the
nearest Indian, which made such a frenzied leap that his rider
was thrown. Mr. Clarendon at first thought it was he who had been
struck; but he quickly sprang to his feet and vaulted upon another
pony behind one of his comrades.</p>

<p>The Sioux continued circling around the settler at a still greater
distance, and sent in another volley, which did no harm. At last
they concluded the risk of a charge and attack too great, and
drew off, finally disappearing in the distance.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "He brought down the pony of the nearest Indian."]</p>

<p>Mr. Clarendon waited an hour or more, expecting them to return,
but they did not, and he resumed his journey to the settlement.</p>

<p>Having but a single horse, he was obliged to leave part of his
load behind, and such slow progress was made in his crippled condition
that the day was well gone before he reached Barwell.</p>

<p>There he was startled to learn that his children had started
homeward early in the day, and were still absent. He set about
organizing a rescue party at once. Fortunately, Nat Trumbull and
several of his rangers were present, and they eagerly gave their
help. Within half an hour after the father received the alarming
tidings Trumbull was cantering southward with a dozen tried men
and true, and among them was Archibald Clarendon himself.</p>

<p>Although the escape of the three parties from the beleaguered
cabin may strike you as wonderful, yet, after all, there was nothing
very remarkable in it.</p>

<p>Red Feather would have forgotten his lifelong training, had he
failed to see and take instant advantage of the providential diversion
when the Sioux, in the gathering darkness, made all haste to the
top of the hill to learn about the horsemen approaching from the
north.</p>

<p>Had the Sioux suspected that the brain of one of their shrewdest
chiefs was helping the boy and girl, they would have been far
more vigilant; but, as it was, they must have believed that nothing
could draw the lad outside of his shelter until the appearance
of his friends.</p>

<p>Red Feather was standing as before at one of the upper windows
when the stampede took place to the crest of the hill. He read
its meaning, and saw his golden opportunity.</p>

<p>"Now we go," he said in an undertone; "me carry pappoose (child)&mdash;you
come 'long&mdash;put blanket round&mdash;den look like Indian."</p>

<p>There was another reason for using the blanket; the air was cold
enough to require it.</p>

<p>Melville was quick to catch the idea, and, whipping a quilt from
the bed, he gathered it about his shoulders, so that it came almost
to his crown. His straw hat would have been too conspicuous, and
he held that in front of his breast, under the blanket, to be
put in its proper place again when it should become safe to do
so.</p>

<p>"I'm ready," he said, standing erect, and looking at Red Feather
as well as he could in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Me too."</p>

<p>The chief had lifted Dot in his arms, and he covered her with
his thick blanket, doing so with such skill that hardly any one
would have suspected the nature of the precious burden he carried
next to his heart.</p>

<p>Not a minute was lost. Red Feather passed down the steps, paused
in front of the door, and waited for Melville to unfasten it.
The youth donned his hat, flung aside his blanket, and set his
gun down to give his arms play. The heavy bar was lifted from
its place, and then, in obedience to an odd whim, he thrust the
end of the leathern string through the orifice above the latch.</p>

<p>He gathered his blanket about his shoulders and head as before,
doffing his hat and returning it to its hiding-place, and paused
for the chieftain to precede him.</p>

<p>Red Feather stood a minute on the threshold, peering out in the
darkness. Everything looked favorable, and he stepped forward.
Melville was directly behind him, and softly closed the door as
he left the cabin.</p>

<p>The Sioux, instead of walking straight away from the building,
moved stealthily along the front, passed around the corner, and
started southward. By this means he interposed the cabin between
himself and the party on the hill.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "The youth was almost on his heels. His heart
beat fast, and he was eager to break into a run." &mdash;Page
98]</p>

<p>The youth was almost on his heels. His heart beat fast, and he
was eager to break into a run that would quickly increase the
distance between him and the war-party. He was about to suggest
that they should hasten, when, to his surprise, he perceived that
his friend was moving so much faster than he that he threatened
to leave him out of sight altogether. Red Feather had struck a
peculiar gait. It looked as if he was walking, but his pace was
a loping trot, in which the feet were lifted only slightly from
the ground. The movement was as smooth as that of a pacing horse,
and he adopted it in order to save Dot from jolting.</p>

<p>The Sioux, on emerging from the building, had glanced sharply
about him, in the hope of catching sight of his own pony, or one
belonging to a warrior; but there was none convenient, and he
dared not wait.</p>

<p>"Saladin must be hovering somewhere in the neighborhood," thought
his young owner, "and it would be mighty fine if I could run against
him, but it doesn't look as if there is much chance."</p>

<p>Red Feather continued his loping gait for two or three hundred
yards, when he once more dropped to a walk; but his steps were
so lengthy and rapid that the lad had to trot most of the time
to hold his own.</p>

<p>Melville fancied his leader was changing his course, but he could
only guess its direction. Looking back, nothing was visible of
the cabin left a few minutes before. Everything was dark, the
country being an undulating prairie. Mr. Clarendon used no fences,
and the ground travelled by the fugitives had not been broken.</p>

<p>It seemed to the youth that the most natural thing for Red Feather
to do was to make directly for the settlement, ten miles to the
northward. It was a long tramp, but the two were capable of doing
much more without special fatigue.</p>

<p>The chieftain did not speak as he hurried forward; and the boy
asked him no questions, content to wait until he chose to tell
his plans. His pace grew more moderate, and soon became easy for
Melville to keep his place beside him.</p>

<p>It need not be said that both made good use of their eyes and
ears. Although beyond sight of the house, it was too soon to think
themselves safe. If a collision took place between Tall Bear and
the new-comers, some of the Indians were likely to be skurrying
backwards and forwards on their ponies, and it was probable they
would come upon the fugitives.</p>

<p>Whenever Red Feather should meet his fellows there would be a
sensation, but he was not the warrior to shrink the test, though
he wished it to be deferred until the brother and sister were
beyond the resentment of every one of his tribe.</p>
