<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p> It was settled.  I had now the courage to turn about.  Our men
crouched about the decks here and there with anxious, crestfallen
faces, all turned one way to watch the chaser.  For the first
time that morning I perceived Cesar stretched out full length
on the deck near the foremast and wondered where he had been skulking
till then.  But he might in truth have been at my elbow all the
time for all I knew.  We had been too absorbed in watching our
fate to pay attention to each other.  Nobody had eaten anything
that morning, but the men had been coming constantly to drink
at the water-butt.</p>

<p>I ran down to the cabin.  I had there, put away in a locker,
ten thousand francs in gold of whose presence on board, so far
as I was aware, not a soul, except Dominic had the slightest inkling. 
When I emerged on deck again Dominic had turned about and was
peering from under his cowl at the coast.  Cape Creux closed the
view ahead.  To the left a wide bay, its waters torn and swept
by fierce squalls, seemed full of smoke.  Astern the sky had a
menacing look.</p>

<p>Directly he saw me, Dominic, in a placid tone, wanted to know
what was the matter.  I came close to him and, looking as unconcerned
as I could, told him in an undertone that I had found the locker
broken open and the money-belt gone.  Last evening it was still
there.</p>

<p>"What did you want to do with it?" he asked me, trembling violently.</p>

<p>"Put it round my waist, of course," I answered, amazed to hear
his teeth chattering.</p>

<p>"Cursed gold!" he muttered.  "The weight of the money might have
cost you your life, perhaps."  He shuddered.  "There is no time
to talk about that now."</p>

<p>"I am ready."</p>

<p>"Not yet.  I am waiting for that squall to come over," he muttered. 
And a few leaden minutes passed.</p>

<p>The squall came over at last.  Our pursuer, overtaken by a sort
of murky whirlwind, disappeared from our sight.  The <em>Tremolino</em>
quivered and bounded forward.  The land ahead vanished, too, and
we seemed to be left alone in a world of water and wind.</p>

<p>"<em>Prenez la barre</em>, <em>monsieur</em>," Dominic broke
the silence suddenly in an austere voice.  "Take hold of the tiller." 
He bent his hood to my ear. "The balancelle is yours.  Your own
hands must deal the blow.  I—I have yet another piece of work
to do."  He spoke up loudly to the man who steered.  "Let the
signorino take the tiller, and you with the others stand by to
haul the boat alongside quickly at the word."</p>

<p>The man obeyed, surprised, but silent.  The others stirred, and
pricked up their ears at this.  I heard their murmurs.  "What
now?  Are we going to run in somewhere and take to our heels? 
The Padrone knows what he is doing."</p>

<p>Dominic went forward.  He paused to look down at Cesar, who,
as I have said before, was lying full length face down by the
foremast, then stepped over him, and dived out of my sight under
the foresail.  I saw nothing ahead.  It was impossible for me
to see anything except the foresail open and still, like a great
shadowy wing.  But Dominic had his bearings.  His voice came to
me from forward, in a just audible cry:</p>

<p>"Now, signorino!"</p>

<p>I bore on the tiller, as instructed before.  Again I heard him
faintly, and then I had only to hold her straight.  No ship ran
so joyously to her death before.  She rose and fell, as if floating
in space, and darted forward, whizzing like an arrow.  Dominic,
stooping under the foot of the foresail, reappeared, and stood
steadying himself against the mast, with a raised forefinger in
an attitude of expectant attention.  A second before the shock
his arm fell down by his side.  At that I set my teeth. And then—</p>

<p>Talk of splintered planks and smashed timbers!  This shipwreck
lies upon my soul with the dread and horror of a homicide, with
the unforgettable remorse of having crushed a living, faithful
heart at a single blow.  At one moment the rush and the soaring
swing of speed; the next a crash, and death, stillness—a moment
of horrible immobility, with the song of the wind changed to a
strident wail, and the heavy waters boiling up menacing and sluggish
around the corpse.  I saw in a distracting minute the foreyard
fly fore and aft with a brutal swing, the men all in a heap, cursing
with fear, and hauling frantically at the line of the boat.  With
a strange welcoming of the familiar I saw also Cesar amongst them,
and recognised Dominic’s old, well-known, effective gesture, the
horizontal sweep of his powerful arm.  I recollect distinctly
saying to myself, "Cesar must go down, of course," and then, as
I was scrambling on all fours, the swinging tiller I had let go
caught me a crack under the ear, and knocked me over senseless.</p>

<p>I don’t think I was actually unconscious for more than a few
minutes, but when I came to myself the dinghy was driving before
the wind into a sheltered cove, two men just keeping her straight
with their oars. Dominic, with his arm round my shoulders, supported
me in the stern-sheets.</p>

<p>We landed in a familiar part of the country.  Dominic took one
of the boat’s oars with him.  I suppose he was thinking of the
stream we would have presently to cross, on which there was a
miserable specimen of a punt, often robbed of its pole.  But first
of all we had to ascend the ridge of land at the back of the Cape. 
He helped me up.  I was dizzy. My head felt very large and heavy. 
At the top of the ascent I clung to him, and we stopped to rest.</p>

<p>To the right, below us, the wide, smoky bay was empty.  Dominic
had kept his word.  There was not a chip to be seen around the
black rock from which the <em>Tremolino</em>, with her plucky
heart crushed at one blow, had slipped off into deep water to
her eternal rest.  The vastness of the open sea was smothered
in driving mists, and in the centre of the thinning squall, phantom-like,
under a frightful press of canvas, the unconscious guardacosta
dashed on, still chasing to the northward.  Our men were already
descending the reverse slope to look for that punt which we knew
from experience was not always to be found easily.  I looked after
them with dazed, misty eyes.  One, two, three, four.</p>

<p>"Dominic, where’s Cesar?" I cried.</p>

<p>As if repulsing the very sound of the name, the Padrone made
that ample, sweeping, knocking-down gesture.  I stepped back a
pace and stared at him fearfully.  His open shirt uncovered his
muscular neck and the thick hair on his chest.  He planted the
oar upright in the soft soil, and rolling up slowly his right
sleeve, extended the bare arm before my face.</p>

<p>"This," he began, with an extreme deliberation, whose superhuman
restraint vibrated with the suppressed violence of his feelings,
"is the arm which delivered the blow.  I am afraid it is your
own gold that did the rest.  I forgot all about your money." 
He clasped his hands together in sudden distress.  "I forgot,
I forgot," he repeated disconsolately.</p>

<p>"Cesar stole the belt?" I stammered out, bewildered.</p>

<p>"And who else?  <em>Canallia</em>!  He must have been spying
on you for days. And he did the whole thing.  Absent all day in
Barcelona.  <em>Traditore</em>! Sold his jacket—to hire a horse. 
Ha! ha!  A good affair!  I tell you it was he who set him at us.
. . ."</p>

<p>Dominic pointed at the sea, where the guardacosta was a mere
dark speck. His chin dropped on his breast.</p>

<p>". . . On information," he murmured, in a gloomy voice.  "A Cervoni! 
Oh! my poor brother! . . ."</p>

<p>"And you drowned him," I said feebly.</p>

<p>"I struck once, and the wretch went down like a stone—with the
gold. Yes.  But he had time to read in my eyes that nothing could
save him while I was alive.  And had I not the right—I, Dominic
Cervoni, Padrone, who brought him aboard your fellucca—my nephew,
a traitor?"</p>

<p>He pulled the oar out of the ground and helped me carefully down
the slope.  All the time he never once looked me in the face. 
He punted us over, then shouldered the oar again and waited till
our men were at some distance before he offered me his arm.  After
we had gone a little way, the fishing hamlet we were making for
came into view.  Dominic stopped.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can make your way as far as the houses by yourself?"
he asked me quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so.  But why?  Where are you going, Dominic?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere.  What a question!  Signorino, you are but little more
than a boy to ask such a question of a man having this tale in
his family. <em>Ah</em>!  <em>Traditore</em>!  What made me ever
own that spawn of a hungry devil for our own blood!  Thief, cheat,
coward, liar—other men can deal with that.  But I was his uncle,
and so . . . I wish he had poisoned me—<em>charogne</em>!  But
this: that I, a confidential man and a Corsican, should have to
ask your pardon for bringing on board your vessel, of which I
was Padrone, a Cervoni, who has betrayed you—a traitor!—that is
too much.  It is too much.  Well, I beg your pardon; and you may
spit in Dominic’s face because a traitor of our blood taints us
all.  A theft may be made good between men, a lie may be set right,
a death avenged, but what can one do to atone for a treachery
like this? . . . Nothing."</p>

<p>He turned and walked away from me along the bank of the stream,
flourishing a vengeful arm and repeating to himself slowly, with
savage emphasis: "<em>Ah</em>!  <em>Canaille</em>!  <em>Canaille</em>! 
<em>Canaille</em>! . . ."  He left me there trembling with weakness
and mute with awe.  Unable to make a sound, I gazed after the
strangely desolate figure of that seaman carrying an oar on his
shoulder up a barren, rock-strewn ravine under the dreary leaden
sky of <em>Tremolino’s</em> last day.  Thus, walking deliberately,
with his back to the sea, Dominic vanished from my sight.</p>

<p>With the quality of our desires, thoughts, and wonder proportioned
to our infinite littleness, we measure even time itself by our
own stature. Imprisoned in the house of personal illusions, thirty
centuries in mankind’s history seem less to look back upon than
thirty years of our own life.  And Dominic Cervoni takes his place
in my memory by the side of the legendary wanderer on the sea
of marvels and terrors, by the side of the fatal and impious adventurer,
to whom the evoked shade of the soothsayer predicted a journey
inland with an oar on his shoulder, till he met men who had never
set eyes on ships and oars.  It seems to me I can see them side
by side in the twilight of an arid land, the unfortunate possessors
of the secret lore of the sea, bearing the emblem of their hard
calling on their shoulders, surrounded by silent and curious men:
even as I, too, having turned my back upon the sea, am bearing
those few pages in the twilight, with the hope of finding in an
inland valley the silent welcome of some patient listener.</p>
