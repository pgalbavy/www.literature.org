I have been planning and replanning, writing and rewriting, this 
next portion of my book for many days.  I perceive I must leave it 
raw edged and ill joined.  I have learnt something of the 
impossibility of History.  For all I have had to tell is the story 
of one man's convictions and aims and how they reacted upon his 
life; and I find it too subtle and involved and intricate for the 
doing.  I find it taxes all my powers to convey even the main forms 
and forces in that development.  It is like looking through moving 
media of changing hue and variable refraction at something vitally 
unstable.  Broad theories and generalisations are mingled with 
personal influences, with prevalent prejudices; and not only 
coloured but altered by phases of hopefulness and moods of 
depression.  The web is made up of the most diverse elements, beyond 
treatment multitudinous. . . .  For a week or so I desisted 
altogether, and walked over the mountains and returned to sit 
through the warm soft mornings among the shaded rocks above this 
little perched-up house of ours, discussing my difficulties with 
Isabel and I think on the whole complicating them further in the 
effort to simplify them to manageable and stateable elements.
<P>
Let me, nevertheless, attempt a rough preliminary analysis of this 
confused process.  A main strand is quite easily traceable.  This 
main strand is the story of my obvious life, my life as it must have 
looked to most of my acquaintances.  It presents you with a young 
couple, bright, hopeful, and energetic, starting out under Altiora's 
auspices to make a career.  You figure us well dressed and active, 
running about in motor-cars, visiting in great people's houses, 
dining amidst brilliant companies, going to the theatre, meeting in 
the lobby.  Margaret wore hundreds of beautiful dresses.  We must 
have had an air of succeeding meritoriously during that time.
<P>
We did very continually and faithfully serve our joint career.  I 
thought about it a great deal, and did and refrained from doing ten 
thousand things for the sake of it.  I kept up a solicitude for it, 
as it were by inertia, long after things had happened and changes 
occurred in me that rendered its completion impossible.  Under 
certain very artless pretences, we wanted steadfastly to make a 
handsome position in the world, achieve respect, SUCCEED.  Enormous 
unseen changes had been in progress for years in my mind and the 
realities of my life, before our general circle could have had any 
inkling of their existence, or suspected the appearances of our 
life.  Then suddenly our proceedings began to be deflected, our 
outward unanimity visibly strained and marred by the insurgence of 
these so long-hidden developments.
<P>
That career had its own hidden side, of course; but when I write of 
these unseen factors I do not mean that but something altogether 
broader.  I do not mean the everyday pettinesses which gave the 
cynical observer scope and told of a narrower, baser aspect of the 
fair but limited ambitions of my ostensible self.  This "sub-
careerist" element noted little things that affected the career, 
made me suspicious of the rivalry of so-and-so, propitiatory to so-
and-so, whom, as a matter of fact, I didn't respect or feel in the 
least sympathetic towards; guarded with that man, who for all his 
charm and interest wasn't helpful, and a little touchy at the 
appearance of neglect from that.  No, I mean something greater and 
not something smaller when I write of a hidden life.
<P>
In the ostensible self who glowed under the approbation of Altiora 
Bailey, and was envied and discussed, praised and depreciated, in 
the House and in smoking-room gossip, you really have as much of a 
man as usually figures in a novel or an obituary notice.  But I am 
tremendously impressed now in the retrospect by the realisation of 
how little that frontage represented me, and just how little such 
frontages do represent the complexities of the intelligent 
contemporary.  Behind it, yet struggling to disorganise and alter 
it, altogether, was a far more essential reality, a self less 
personal, less individualised, and broader in its references.  Its 
aims were never simply to get on; it had an altogether different 
system of demands and satisfactions.  It was critical, curious, more 
than a little unfeeling--and relentlessly illuminating.
<P>
It is just the existence and development of this more generalised 
self-behind-the-frontage that is making modern life so much more 
subtle and intricate to render, and so much more hopeful in its 
relations to the perplexities of the universe.  I see this mental 
and spiritual hinterland vary enormously in the people about me, 
from a type which seems to keep, as people say, all its goods in the 
window, to others who, like myself, come to regard the ostensible 
existence more and more as a mere experimental feeder and agent for 
that greater personality behind.  And this back-self has its history 
of phases, its crises and happy accidents and irrevocable 
conclusions, more or less distinct from the adventures and 
achievements of the ostensible self.  It meets persons and phrases, 
it assimilates the spirit of a book, it is startled into new 
realisations by some accident that seems altogether irrelevant to 
the general tenor of one's life.  Its increasing independence of the 
ostensible career makes it the organ of corrective criticism; it 
accumulates disturbing energy.  Then it breaks our overt promises 
and repudiates our pledges, coming down at last like an overbearing 
mentor upon the small engagements of the pupil.
<P>
In the life of the individual it takes the role that the growth of 
philosophy, science, and creative literature may play in the 
development of mankind.
<P>

<P>
It is curious to recall how Britten helped shatter that obvious, 
lucidly explicable presentation of myself upon which I had embarked 
with Margaret.  He returned to revive a memory of adolescent dreams 
and a habit of adolescent frankness; he reached through my shallow 
frontage as no one else seemed capable of doing, and dragged that 
back-self into relation with it.
<P>
I remember very distinctly a dinner and a subsequent walk with him 
which presents itself now as altogether typical of the quality of 
his influence.
<P>
I had come upon him one day while lunching with Somers and Sutton at 
the Playwrights' Club, and had asked him to dinner on the spur of 
the moment.  He was oddly the same curly-headed, red-faced 
ventriloquist, and oddly different, rather seedy as well as untidy, 
and at first a little inclined to make comparisons with my sleek 
successfulness.  But that disposition presently evaporated, and his 
talk was good and fresh and provocative.  And something that had 
long been straining at its checks in my mind flapped over, and he 
and I found ourselves of one accord.
<P>
Altiora wasn't at this dinner.  When she came matters were apt to 
become confusedly strenuous.  There was always a slight and 
ineffectual struggle at the end on the part of Margaret to 
anticipate Altiora's overpowering tendency to a rally and the 
establishment of some entirely unjustifiable conclusion by a COUP-
DE-MAIN.  When, however, Altiora was absent, the quieter influence 
of the Cramptons prevailed; temperance and information for its own 
sake prevailed excessively over dinner and the play of thought. . . .  
Good Lord! what bores the Cramptons were!  I wonder I endured 
them as I did.  They had all of them the trick of lying in wait 
conversationally; they had no sense of the self-exposures, the 
gallant experiments in statement that are necessary for good 
conversation.  They would watch one talking with an expression 
exactly like peeping through bushes.  Then they would, as it were, 
dash out, dissent succinctly, contradict some secondary fact, and 
back to cover.  They gave one twilight nerves.  Their wives were 
easier but still difficult at a stretch; they talked a good deal 
about children and servants, but with an air caught from Altiora of 
making observations upon sociological types.  Lewis gossiped about 
the House in an entirely finite manner.  He never raised a 
discussion; nobody ever raised a discussion.  He would ask what we 
thought of Evesham's question that afternoon, and Edward would say 
it was good, and Mrs. Willie, who had been behind the grille, would 
think it was very good, and then Willie, parting the branches, would 
say rather conclusively that he didn't think it was very much good, 
and I would deny hearing the question in order to evade a profitless 
statement of views in that vacuum, and then we would cast about in 
our minds for some other topic of equal interest. . . .
<P>
On this occasion Altiora was absent, and to qualify our Young 
Liberal bleakness we had Mrs. Millingham, with her white hair and 
her fresh mind and complexion, and Esmeer.  Willie Crampton was with 
us, but not his wife, who was having her third baby on principle; 
his brother Edward was present, and the Lewises, and of course the 
Bunting Harblows.  There was also some other lady.  I remember her 
as pale blue, but for the life of me I cannot remember her name.
<P>
Quite early there was a little breeze between Edward Crampton and 
Esmeer, who had ventured an opinion about the partition of Poland.  
Edward was at work then upon the seventh volume of his monumental 
Life of Kosciusko, and a little impatient with views perhaps not 
altogether false but betraying a lamentable ignorance of accessible 
literature.  At any rate, his correction of Esmeer was magisterial.  
After that there was a distinct and not altogether delightful pause, 
and then some one, it may have been the pale-blue lady, asked Mrs. 
Lewis whether her aunt Lady Carmixter had returned from her rest-
and-sun-cure in Italy.  That led to a rather anxiously sustained 
talk about regimen, and Willie told us how he had profited by the 
no-breakfast system.  It had increased his power of work enormously.  
He could get through ten hours a day now without inconvenience.
<P>
"What do you do?" said Esmeer abruptly.
<P>
"Oh! no end of work.  There's all the estate and looking after 
things."
<P>
"But publicly?"
<P>
"I asked three questions yesterday.  And for one of them I had to 
consult nine books!"
<P>
We were drifting, I could see, towards Doctor Haig's system of 
dietary, and whether the exclusion or inclusion of fish and chicken 
were most conducive to high efficiency, when Britten, who had 
refused lemonade and claret and demanded Burgundy, broke out, and 
was discovered to be demanding in his throat just what we Young 
Liberals thought we were up to?
<P>
"I want," said Britten, repeating his challenge a little louder, "to 
hear just exactly what you think you are doing in Parliament?"
<P>
Lewis laughed nervously, and thought we were "Seeking the Good of 
the Community."
<P>
"HOW?"
<P>
"Beneficient Legislation," said Lewis.
<P>
"Beneficient in what direction?" insisted Britten.  "I want to know 
where you think you are going."
<P>
"Amelioration of Social Conditions," said Lewis.
<P>
"That's only a phrase!"
<P>
"You wouldn't have me sketch bills at dinner?"
<P>
"I'd like you to indicate directions," said Britten, and waited.
<P>
"Upward and On," said Lewis with conscious neatness, and turned to 
ask Mrs. Bunting Harblow about her little boy's French.
<P>
For a time talk frothed over Britten's head, but the natural 
mischief in Mrs. Millingham had been stirred, and she was presently 
echoing his demand in lisping, quasi-confidential undertones.  "What 
ARE we Liberals doing?"  Then Esmeer fell in with the 
revolutionaries.
<P>
To begin with, I was a little shocked by this clamour for 
fundamentals--and a little disconcerted.  I had the experience that 
I suppose comes to every one at times of discovering oneself 
together with two different sets of people with whom one has 
maintained two different sets of attitudes.  It had always been, I 
perceived, an instinctive suppression in our circle that we 
shouldn't be more than vague about our political ideals.  It had 
almost become part of my morality to respect this convention.  It 
was understood we were all working hard, and keeping ourselves fit, 
tremendously fit, under Altiora's inspiration, Pro Bono Publico.  
Bunting Harblow had his under-secretaryship, and Lewis was on the 
verge of the Cabinet, and these things we considered to be in the 
nature of confirmations. . . .  It added to tbe discomfort of the 
situation that these plunging enquiries were being made in the 
presence of our wives.
<P>
The rebel section of our party forced the talk.
<P>
Edward Crampton was presently declaring--I forget in what relation: 
"The country is with us."
<P>
My long-controlled hatred of the Cramptons' stereotyped phrases 
about the Country and the House got the better of me.  I showed my 
cloven hoof to my friends for the first time.
<P>
"We don't respect the Country as we used to do," I said.  "We 
haven't the same belief we used to have in the will of the people.  
It's no good, Crampton, trying to keep that up.  We Liberals know as 
a matter of fact--nowadays every one knows--that the monster that 
brought us into power has, among other deficiencies, no head.  We've 
got to give it one--if possible with brains and a will.  That lies 
in the future.  For the present if the country is with us, it means 
merely that we happen to have hold of its tether."
<P>
Lewis was shocked.  A "mandate" from the Country was sacred to his 
system of pretences.
<P>
Britten wasn't subdued by his first rebuff; presently he was at us 
again.  There were several attempts to check his outbreak of 
interrogation; I remember the Cramptons asked questions about the 
welfare of various cousins of Lewis who were unknown to the rest of 
us, and Margaret tried to engage Britten in a sympathetic discussion 
of the Arts and Crafts exhibition.  But Britten and Esmeer were 
persistent, Mrs. Millingham was mischievous, and in the end our 
rising hopes of Young Liberalism took to their thickets for good, 
while we talked all over them of the prevalent vacuity of political 
intentions.  Margaret was perplexed by me.  It is only now I 
perceive just how perplexing I must have been.  "Of course, she said 
with that faint stress of apprehension in her eyes, one must have 
aims."  And, "it isn't always easy to put everything into phrases."  
"Don't be long," said Mrs. Edward Crampton to her hsuband as the 
wives trooped out.  And afterwards when we went upstairs I had an 
indefinable persuasion that the ladies had been criticising 
Britten's share in our talk in an altogether unfavourable spirit.  
Mrs. Edward evidently thought him aggressive and impertinent, and 
Margaret with a quiet firmness that brooked no resistance, took him 
at once into a corner and showed him Italian photographs by Coburn.  
We dispersed early.
<P>
I walked with Britten along the Chelsea back streets towards 
Battersea Bridge--he lodged on the south side.
<P>
"Mrs. Millingham's a dear," he began.
<P>
"She's a dear."
<P>
"I liked her demand for a hansom because a four-wheeler was too 
safe."
<P>
"She was worked up," I said.  "She's a woman of faultless character, 
but her instincts, as Altiora would say, are anarchistic--when she 
gives them a chance."
<P>
"So she takes it out in hansom cabs."
<P>
"Hansom cabs."
<P>
"She's wise," said Britten. . . .
<P>
"I hope, Remington," he went on after a pause, "I didn't rag your 
other guests too much.  I've a sort of feeling at moments--
Remington, those chaps are so infernally not--not bloody.  It's part 
of a man's duty sometimes at least to eat red beef and get drunk.  
How is he to understand government if he doesn't?  It scares me to 
think of your lot--by a sort of misapprehension--being in power.  A 
kind of neuralgia in the head, by way of government.  I don't 
understand where YOU come in.  Those others--they've no lusts.  
Their ideal is anaemia.  You and I, we had at least a lust to take 
hold of life and make something of it.  They--they want to take hold 
of life and make nothing of it.  They want to cut out all the 
stimulants.  Just as though life was anything else but a reaction to 
stimulation!" . . .
<P>
He began to talk of his own life.  He had had ill-fortune through 
most of it.  He was poor and unsuccessful, and a girl he had been 
very fond of had been attacked and killed by a horse in a field in a 
very horrible manner.  These things had wounded and tortured him, 
but they hadn't broken him.  They had, it seemed to me, made a kind 
of crippled and ugly demigod of him.  He was, I began to perceive, 
so much better than I had any right to expect.  At first I had been 
rather struck by his unkempt look, and it made my reaction all the 
stronger.  There was about him something, a kind of raw and bleeding 
faith in the deep things of life, that stirred me profoundly as he 
showed it.  My set of people had irritated him and disappointed him.  
I discovered at his touch how they irritated him.  He reproached me 
boldly.  He made me feel ashamed of my easy acquiescences as I 
walked in my sleek tall neatness beside his rather old coat, his 
rather battered hat, his sturdier shorter shape, and listened to his 
denunciations of our self-satisfied New Liberalism and 
Progressivism.
<P>
"It has the same relation to progress--the reality of progress--that 
the things they paint on door panels in the suburbs have to art and 
beauty.  There's a sort of filiation. . . .  Your Altiora's just the 
political equivalent of the ladies who sell traced cloth for 
embroidery; she's a dealer in Refined Social Reform for the Parlour.  
The real progress, Remington, is a graver thing and a painfuller 
thing and a slower thing altogether.  Look!  THAT"--and he pointed 
to where under a boarding in the light of a gas lamp a dingy 
prostitute stood lurking--" was in Babylon and Nineveh.  Your little 
lot make believe there won't be anything of the sort after this 
Parliament!  They're going to vanish at a few top notes from Altiora 
Bailey!  Remington!--it's foolery.  It's prigs at play.  It's make-
believe, make-believe!  Your people there haven't got hold of 
things, aren't beginning to get hold of things, don't know anything 
of life at all, shirk life, avoid life, get in little bright clean 
rooms and talk big over your bumpers of lemonade while the Night 
goes by outside--untouched.  Those Crampton fools slink by all 
this,"--he waved at the woman again--"pretend it doesn't exist, or 
is going to be banished root and branch by an Act to keep children 
in the wet outside public-houses.  Do you think they really care, 
Remington?  I don't.  It's make-believe.  What they want to do, what 
Lewis wants to do, what Mrs. Bunting Harblow wants her husband to 
do, is to sit and feel very grave and necessary and respected on the 
Government benches.  They think of putting their feet out like 
statesmen, and tilting shiny hats with becoming brims down over 
their successful noses.  Presentation portrait to a club at fifty.  
That's their Reality.  That's their scope.  They don't, it's 
manifest, WANT to think beyond that.  The things there ARE, 
Remington, they'll never face! the wonder and the depth of life,--
lust, and the night-sky,--pain."
<P>
"But the good intention," I pleaded, "the Good Will!"
<P>
"Sentimentality," said Britten.  "No Good Will is anything but 
dishonesty unless it frets and burns and hurts and destroys a man.  
That lot of yours have nothing but a good will to think they have 
good will.  Do you think they lie awake of nights searching their 
hearts as we do?  Lewis?  Crampton?  Or those neat, admiring, 
satisfied little wives?  See how they shrank from the probe!"
<P>
"We all," I said, "shrink from the probe."
<P>
"God help us!" said Britten. . . .
<P>
"We are but vermin at the best, Remington," he broke out," and the 
greatest saint only a worm that has lifted its head for a moment 
from the dust.  We are damned, we are meant to be damned, coral 
animalculae building upward, upward in a sea of damnation.  But of 
all the damned things that ever were damned, your damned shirking, 
temperate, sham-efficient, self-satisfied, respectable, make-
believe, Fabian-spirited Young Liberal is tbe utterly damnedest."  
He paused for a moment, and resumed in an entirely different note: 
"Which is why I was so surprised, Remington, to find YOU in this 
set!"
<P>
"You're just the old plunger you used to be, Britten," I said.  " 
You're going too far with all your might for the sake of the damns.  
Like a donkey that drags its cart up a bank to get thistles.  
There's depths in Liberalism--"
<P>
"We were talking about Liberals."
<P>
"Liberty!"
<P>
"Liberty!  What do YOOR little lot know of liberty?"
<P>
"What does any little lot know of liberty?"
<P>
"It waits outside, too big for our understanding.  Like the night 
and the stars.  And lust, Remington! lust and bitterness!  Don't I 
know them? with all the sweetness and hope of life bitten and 
trampled, the dear eyes and the brain that loved and understood--and 
my poor mumble of a life going on!  I'm within sight of being a 
drunkard, Remington!  I'm a failure by most standards!  Life has cut 
me to the bone.  But I'm not afraid of it any more.  I've paid 
something of the price, I've seen something of the meaning."
<P>
He flew off at a tangent.  "I'd rather die in Delirium Tremens," he 
cried, "than be a Crampton or a Lewis. . . ."
<P>
"Make-believe.  Make-believe."  The phrase and Britten's squat 
gestures haunted me as I walked homeward alone.  I went to my room 
and stood before my desk and surveyed papers and files and 
Margaret's admirable equipment of me.
<P>
I perceived in the lurid light of Britten's suggestions that so it 
was Mr. George Alexander would have mounted a statesman's private 
room. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
I was never at any stage a loyal party man.  I doubt if party will 
ever again be the force it was during the eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries.  Men are becoming increasingly constructive and 
selective, less patient under tradition and the bondage of initial 
circumstances.  As education becomes more universal and liberating, 
men will sort themselves more and more by their intellectual 
temperaments and less and less by their accidental associations.  
The past will rule them less; the future more.  It is not simply 
party but school and college and county and country that lose their 
glamour.  One does not hear nearly as much as our forefathers did of 
the "old Harrovian," "old Arvonian," "old Etonian" claim to this or 
that unfair advantage or unearnt sympathy.  Even the Scotch and the 
Devonians weaken a little in their clannishness.  A widening sense 
of fair play destroys such things.  They follow freemasonry down--
freemasonry of which one is chiefly reminded nowadays in England by 
propitiatory symbols outside shady public-houses. . . .
<P>
There is, of course, a type of man which clings very obstinately to 
party ties.  These are the men with strong reproductive imaginations 
and no imaginative initiative, such men as Cladingbowl, for example, 
or Dayton.  They are the scholars-at-large in life.  For them the 
fact that the party system has been essential in the history of 
England for two hundred years gives it an overwhelming glamour.  
They have read histories and memoirs, they see the great grey pile 
of Westminster not so much for what it is as for what it was, rich 
with dramatic memories, populous with glorious ghosts, phrasing 
itself inevitably in anecdotes and quotations.  It seems almost 
scandalous that new things should continue to happen, swamping with 
strange qualities the savour of these old associations.
<P>
That Mr. Ramsay Macdonald should walk through Westminster Hall, 
thrust himself, it may be, through the very piece of space that once 
held Charles the Martyr pleading for his life, seems horrible 
profanation to Dayton, a last posthumous outrage; and he would, I 
think, like to have the front benches left empty now for ever, or at 
most adorned with laureated ivory tablets: "Here Dizzy sat," and "On 
this Spot William Ewart Gladstone made his First Budget Speech."  
Failing this, he demands, if only as signs of modesty and respect on 
the part of the survivors, meticulous imitation.  "Mr. G.," he 
murmurs, "would not have done that," and laments a vanished subtlety 
even while Mr. Evesham is speaking.  He is always gloomily disposed 
to lapse into wonderings about what things are coming to, wonderings 
that have no grain of curiosity.  His conception of perfect conduct 
is industrious persistence along the worn-down, well-marked grooves 
of the great recorded days.  So infinitely more important to him is 
the documented, respected thing than the elusive present.
<P>
Cladingbowl and Dayton do not shine in the House, though Cladingbowl 
is a sound man on a committee, and Dayton keeps the OLD COUNTRY 
GAZETTE, the most gentlemanly paper in London.  They prevail, 
however, in their clubs at lunch time.  There, with the pleasant 
consciousness of a morning's work free from either zeal or shirking, 
they mingle with permanent officials, prominent lawyers, even a few 
of the soberer type of business men, and relax their minds in the 
discussion of the morning paper, of the architecture of the West 
End, and of the latest public appointments, of golf, of holiday 
resorts, of the last judicial witticisms and forensic "crushers."  
The New Year and Birthday honours lists are always very sagely and 
exhaustively considered, and anecdotes are popular and keenly 
judged.  They do not talk of the things that are really active in 
their minds, but in the formal and habitual manner they suppose to 
be proper to intelligent but still honourable men.  Socialism, 
individual money matters, and religion are forbidden topics, and sex 
and women only in so far as they appear in the law courts.  It is to 
me the strangest of conventions, this assumption of unreal loyalties 
and traditional respects, this repudiation and concealment of 
passionate interests.  It is like wearing gloves in summer fields, 
or bathing in a gown, or falling in love with the heroine of a 
novel, or writing under a pseudonym, or becoming a masked Tuareg. . . .
<P>
It is not, I think, that men of my species are insensitive to the 
great past that is embodied in Westminster and its traditions; we 
are not so much wanting in the historical sense as alive to the 
greatness of our present opportunities and the still vaster future 
that is possible to us.  London is the most interesting, beautiful, 
and wonderful city in the world to me, delicate in her incidental 
and multitudinous littleness, and stupendous in her pregnant 
totality; I cannot bring myself to use her as a museum or an old 
bookshop.  When I think of Whitehall that little affair on the 
scaffold outside the Banqueting Hall seems trivial and remote in 
comparison with the possibilities that offer themselves to my 
imagination within the great grey Government buildings close at 
hand.
<P>
It gives me a qualm of nostalgia even to name those places now.  I 
think of St. Stephen's tower streaming upwards into the misty London 
night and the great wet quadrangle of New Palace Yard, from which 
the hansom cabs of my first experiences were ousted more and more by 
taxicabs as the second Parliament of King Edward the Seventh aged; I 
think of the Admiralty and War office with their tall Marconi masts 
sending out invisible threads of direction to the armies in the 
camps, to great fleets about the world.  The crowded, darkly shining 
river goes flooding through my memory once again, on to those narrow 
seas that part us from our rival nations; I see quadrangles and 
corridors of spacious grey-toned offices in which undistinguished 
little men and little files of papers link us to islands in the 
tropics, to frozen wildernesses gashed for gold, to vast temple-
studded plains, to forest worlds and mountain worlds, to ports and 
fortresses and lighthouses and watch-towers and grazing lands and 
corn lands all about the globe.  Once more I traverse Victoria 
Street, grimy and dark, where the Agents of the Empire jostle one 
another, pass the big embassies in the West End with their flags and 
scutcheons, follow the broad avenue that leads to Buckingham Palace, 
witness the coming and going of troops and officials and guests 
along it from every land on earth. . . .  Interwoven in the texture 
of it all, mocking, perplexing, stimulating beyond measure, is the 
gleaming consciousness, the challenging knowledge: "You and your 
kind might still, if you could but grasp it here, mould all the 
destiny of Man!"
<P>

<P>
My first three years in Parliament were years of active discontent.  
The little group of younger Liberals to which I belonged was very 
ignorant of the traditions and qualities of our older leaders, and 
quite out of touch with the mass of the party.  For a time 
Parliament was enormously taken up with moribund issues and old 
quarrels.  The early Educational legislation was sectarian and 
unenterprising, and the Licensing Bill went little further than the 
attempted rectification of a Conservative mistake.  I was altogether 
for the nationalisation of the public-houses, and of this end the 
Bill gave no intimations.  It was just beer-baiting.  I was 
recalcitrant almost from the beginning, and spoke against the 
Government so early as the second reading of the first Education 
Bill, the one the Lords rejected in 1906.  I went a little beyond my 
intention in the heat of speaking,--it is a way with inexperienced 
man.  I called the Bill timid, narrow, a mere sop to the jealousies 
of sects and little-minded people.  I contrasted its aim and methods 
with the manifest needs of the time.
<P>
I am not a particularly good speaker; after the manner of a writer I 
worry to find my meaning too much; but this was one of my successes.  
I spoke after dinner and to a fairly full House, for people were 
already a little curious about me because of my writings.  Several 
of the Conservative leaders were present and stayed, and Mr. 
Evesham, I remember, came ostentatiously to hear me, with that 
engaging friendliness of his, and gave me at the first chance an 
approving "Hear, Hear!"  I can still recall quite distinctly my two 
futile attempts to catch the Speaker's eye before I was able to 
begin, the nervous quiver of my rather too prepared opening, the 
effect of hearing my own voice and my subconscious wonder as to what 
I could possibly be talking about, the realisation that I was 
getting on fairly well, the immense satisfaction afterwards of 
having on the whole brought it off, and the absurd gratitude I felt 
for that encouraging cheer.
<P>
Addressing the House of Commons is like no other public speaking in 
the world.  Its semi-colloquial methods give it an air of being 
easy, but its shifting audience, the comings and goings and 
hesitations of members behind the chair--not mere audience units, 
but men who matter--the desolating emptiness that spreads itself 
round the man who fails to interest, the little compact, disciplined 
crowd in the strangers' gallery, the light, elusive, flickering 
movements high up behind the grill, the wigged, attentive, weary 
Speaker, the table and the mace and the chapel-like Gothic 
background with its sombre shadows, conspire together, produce a 
confused, uncertain feeling in me, as though I was walking upon a 
pavement full of trap-doors and patches of uncovered morass.  A 
misplaced, well-meant "Hear, Hear!" is apt to be extraordinarily 
disconcerting, and under no other circumstances have I had to speak 
with quite the same sideways twist that the arrangement of the House 
imposes.  One does not recognise one's own voice threading out into 
the stirring brown.  Unless I was excited or speaking to the mind of 
some particular person in the house, I was apt to lose my feeling of 
an auditor.  I had no sense of whither my sentences were going, such 
as one has with a public meeting well under one's eye.  And to lose 
one's sense of an auditor is for a man of my temperament to lose 
one's sense of the immediate, and to become prolix and vague with 
qualifications.

My discontents with the Liberal party and my mental exploration of 
the quality of party generally is curiously mixed up with certain 
impressions of things and people in the National Liberal Club.  The 
National Liberal Club is Liberalism made visible in the flesh--and 
Doultonware.  It is an extraordinary big club done in a bold, 
wholesale, shiny, marbled style, richly furnished with numerous 
paintings, steel engravings, busts, and full-length statues of the 
late Mr. Gladstone; and its spacious dining-rooms, its long, hazy, 
crowded smoking-room with innumerable little tables and groups of 
men in armchairs, its magazine room and library upstairs, have just 
that undistinguished and unconcentrated diversity which is for me 
the Liberal note.  The pensive member sits and hears perplexing 
dialects and even fragments of foreign speech, and among the 
clustering masses of less insistent whites his roving eye catches 
profiles and complexions that send his mind afield to Calcutta or 
Rangoon or the West Indies or Sierra Leone or the Cape. . . .
<P>
I was not infrequently that pensive member.  I used to go to the 
Club to doubt about Liberalism.
<P>
About two o'clock in the day the great smoking-room is crowded with 
countless little groups.  They sit about small round tables, or in 
circles of chairs, and the haze of tobacco seems to prolong the 
great narrow place, with its pillars and bays, to infinity.  Some of 
the groups are big, as many as a dozen men talk in loud tones; some 
are duologues, and there is always a sprinkling of lonely, 
dissociated men.  At first one gets an impression of men going from 
group to group and as it were linking them, but as one watches 
closely one finds that these men just visit three or four groups at 
the outside, and know nothing of the others.  One begins to perceive 
more and more distinctly that one is dealing with a sort of human 
mosaic; that each patch in that great place is of a different 
quality and colour from the next and never to be mixed with it.  
Most clubs have a common link, a lowest common denominator in the 
Club Bore, who spares no one, but even the National Liberal bores 
are specialised and sectional.  As one looks round one sees here a 
clump of men from the North Country or the Potteries, here an island 
of South London politicians, here a couple of young Jews ascendant 
from Whitechapel, here a circle of journalists and writers, here a 
group of Irish politicians, here two East Indians, here a priest or 
so, here a clump of old-fashioned Protestants, here a little knot of 
eminent Rationalists indulging in a blasphemous story SOTTO VOCE.  
Next them are a group of anglicised Germans and highly specialised 
chess-players, and then two of the oddest-looking persons--bulging 
with documents and intent upon extraordinary business transactions 
over long cigars. . . .
<P>
I would listen to a stormy sea of babblement, and try to extract 
some constructive intimations.  Every now and then I got a whiff of 
politics.  It was clear they were against the Lords--against 
plutocrats--against Cossington's newspapers--against the brewers. . . .  
It was tremendously clear what they were against.  The trouble 
was to find out what on earth they were for! . . .
<P>
As I sat and thought, the streaked and mottled pillars and wall, the 
various views, aspects, and portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, the 
partitions of polished mahogany, the yellow-vested waiters, would 
dissolve and vanish, and I would have a vision of this sample of 
miscellaneous men of limited, diverse interests and a universal 
littleness of imagination enlarged, unlimited, no longer a sample 
but a community, spreading, stretching out to infinity--all in 
little groups and duologues and circles, all with their special and 
narrow concerns, all with their backs to most of the others.
<P>
What but a common antagonism would ever keep these multitudes 
together?  I understood why modern electioneering is more than half 
of it denunciation.  Let us condemn, if possible, let us obstruct 
and deprive, but not let us do.  There is no real appeal to the 
commonplace mind in "Let us do."  That calls for the creative 
imagination, and few have been accustomed to respond to that call.  
The other merely needs jealousy and bate, of which there are great 
and easily accessible reservoirs in every human heart. . . .
<P>
I remember that vision of endless, narrow, jealous individuality 
very vividly.  A seething limitlessness it became at last, like a 
waste place covered by crawling locusts that men sweep up by the 
sackload and drown by the million in ditches. . . .
<P>
Grotesquely against it came the lean features, the sidelong shy 
movements of Edward Crampton, seated in a circle of talkers close at 
hand.  I had a whiff of his strained, unmusical voice, and behold! 
he was saying something about the "Will of the People. . . ." 
<P>
The immense and wonderful disconnectednesses of human life!  I 
forgot the smoke and jabber of the club altogether; I became a 
lonely spirit flung aloft by some queer accident, a stone upon a 
ledge in some high and rocky wilderness, and below as far as the eye 
could reach stretched the swarming infinitesimals of humanity, like 
grass upon the field, like pebbles upon unbounded beaches.  Was 
there ever to be in human life more than that endless struggling 
individualism?  Was there indeed some giantry, some immense valiant 
synthesis, still to come--or present it might be and still unseen by 
me, or was this the beginning and withal the last phase of 
mankind? . . .
<P>
I glimpsed for a while the stupendous impudence of our ambitions, 
the tremendous enterprise to which the modern statesman is 
implicitly addressed.  I was as it were one of a little swarm of 
would-be reef builders looking back at the teeming slime upon the 
ocean floor.  All the history of mankind, all the history of life, 
has been and will be the story of something struggling out of the 
indiscriminated abyss, struggling to exist and prevail over and 
comprehend individual lives--an effort of insidious attraction, an 
idea of invincible appeal.  That something greater than ourselves, 
which does not so much exist as seek existence, palpitating between 
being and not-being, how marvellous it is!  It has worn the form and 
visage of ten thousand different gods, sought a shape for itself in 
stone and ivory and music and wonderful words, spoken more and more 
clearly of a mystery of love, a mystery of unity, dabbling meanwhile 
in blood and cruelty beyond the common impulses of men.  It is 
something that comes and goes, like a light that shines and is 
withdrawn, withdrawn so completely that one doubts if it has ever 
been. . . .

I would mark with a curious interest the stray country member of the 
club up in town for a night or so.  My mind would be busy with 
speculations about him, about his home, his family, his reading, his 
horizons, his innumerable fellows who didn't belong and never came 
up.  I would fill in the outline of him with memories of my uncle 
and his Staffordshire neighbours.  He was perhaps Alderman This or 
Councillor That down there, a great man in his ward, J. P. within 
seven miles of the boundary of the borough, and a God in his home.  
Here he was nobody, and very shy, and either a little too arrogant 
or a little too meek towards our very democratic mannered but still 
livened waiters.  Was he perhaps the backbone of England?  He over-
ate himself lest he should appear mean, went through our Special 
Dinner conscientiously, drank, unless he was teetotal, of unfamiliar 
wines, and did his best, in spite of the rules, to tip.  Afterwards, 
in a state of flushed repletion, he would have old brandy, black 
coffee, and a banded cigar, or in the name of temperance omit the 
brandy and have rather more coffee, in the smoking-room.  I would 
sit and watch that stiff dignity of self-indulgence, and wonder, 
wonder. . . .
<P>
An infernal clairvoyance would come to me.  I would have visions of 
him in relation to his wife, checking always, sometimes bullying, 
sometimes being ostentatiously "kind"; I would see him glance 
furtively at his domestic servants upon his staircase, or stiffen 
his upper lip against the reluctant, protesting business employee.  
We imaginative people are base enough, heaven knows, but it is only 
in rare moods of bitter penetration that we pierce down to the baser 
lusts, the viler shames, the everlasting lying and muddle-headed 
self-justification of the dull.
<P>
I would turn my eyes down the crowded room and see others of him and 
others.  What did he think he was up to?  Did he for a moment 
realise that his presence under that ceramic glory of a ceiling with 
me meant, if it had any rational meaning at all, that we were 
jointly doing something with the nation and the empire and 
mankind? . . .  How on earth could any one get hold of him, make 
any noble use of him?  He didn't read beyond his newspaper.  He 
never thought, but only followed imaginings in his heart.  He never 
discussed.  At the first hint of discussion his temper gave way.  
He was, I knew, a deep, thinly-covered tank of resentments and 
quite irrational moral rages.  Yet withal I would have to resist 
an impulse to go over to him and nudge him and say to him, "Look 
here!  What indeed do you think we are doing with the nation and 
the empire and mankind?  You know--MANKIND!"
<P>
I wonder what reply I should have got.
<P>
So far as any average could be struck and so far as any backbone 
could be located, it seemed to me that this silent, shy, replete, 
sub-angry, middle-class sentimentalist was in his endless species 
and varieties and dialects the backbone of our party.  So far as I 
could be considered as representing anything in the House, I 
pretended to sit for the elements of HIM. . . .

For a time I turned towards the Socialists.  They at least had an 
air of coherent intentions.  At that time Socialism had come into 
politics again after a period of depression and obscurity, with a 
tremendous ECLAT.  There was visibly a following of Socialist 
members to Chris Robinson; mysteriously uncommunicative gentlemen in 
soft felt hats and short coats and square-toed boots who replied to 
casual advances a little surprisingly in rich North Country 
dialects.  Members became aware of a "seagreen incorruptible," as 
Colonel Marlow put it to me, speaking on the Address, a slender 
twisted figure supporting itself on a stick and speaking with a fire 
that was altogether revolutionary.  This was Philip Snowden, the 
member for Blackburn.  They had come in nearly forty strong 
altogether, and with an air of presently meaning to come in much 
stronger.  They were only one aspect of what seemed at that time a 
big national movement.  Socialist societies, we gathered, were 
springing up all over the country, and every one was inquiring about 
Socialism and discussing Socialism.  It had taken the Universities 
with particular force, and any youngster with the slightest 
intellectual pretension was either actively for or brilliantly 
against.  For a time our Young Liberal group was ostentatiously 
sympathetic. . . .
<P>
When I think of the Socialists there comes a vivid memory of certain 
evening gatherings at our house. . . .
<P>
These gatherings had been organised by Margaret as the outcome of a 
discussion at the Baileys'.  Altiora had been very emphatic and 
uncharitable upon the futility of the Socialist movement.  It seemed 
that even the leaders fought shy of dinner-parties.
<P>
"They never meet each other," said Altiora, "much less people on the 
other side.  How can they begin to understand politics until they do 
that?"
<P>
"Most of them have totally unpresentable wives," said Altiora, 
"totally!" and quoted instances, "and they WILL bring them.  Or they 
won't come!  Some of the poor creatures have scarcely learnt their 
table manners.  They just make holes in the talk. . . ."
<P>
I thought there was a great deal of truth beneath Altiora's 
outburst.  The presentation of the Socialist case seemed very 
greatly crippled by the want of a common intimacy in its leaders; 
the want of intimacy didn't at first appear to be more than an 
accident, and our talk led to Margaret's attempt to get acquaintance 
and easy intercourse afoot among them and between them and the Young 
Liberals of our group.  She gave a series of weekly dinners, 
planned, I think, a little too accurately upon Altiora's model, and 
after each we had as catholic a reception as we could contrive.
<P>
Our receptions were indeed, I should think, about as catholic as 
receptions could be.  Margaret found herself with a weekly houseful 
of insoluble problems in intercourse.  One did one's best, but one 
got a nightmare feeling as the evening wore on.
<P>
It was one of the few unanimities of these parties that every one 
should be a little odd in appearance, funny about the hair or the 
tie or the shoes or more generally, and that bursts of violent 
aggression should alternate with an attitude entirely defensive.  A 
number of our guests had an air of waiting for a clue that never 
came, and stood and sat about silently, mildly amused but not a bit 
surprised that we did not discover their distinctive Open-Sesames.  
There was a sprinkling of manifest seers and prophetesses in 
shapeless garments, far too many, I thought, for really easy social 
intercourse, and any conversation at any moment was liable to become 
oracular.  One was in a state of tension from first to last; the 
most innocent remark seemed capable of exploding resentment, and 
replies came out at the most unexpected angles.  We Young Liberals 
went about puzzled but polite to the gathering we had evoked.  The 
Young Liberals' tradition is on the whole wonderfully discreet, 
superfluous steam is let out far away from home in the Balkans or 
Africa, and the neat, stiff figures of the Cramptons, Bunting 
Harblow, and Lewis, either in extremely well-cut morning coats 
indicative of the House, or in what is sometimes written of as 
"faultless evening dress," stood about on those evenings, they and 
their very quietly and simply and expensively dressed little wives, 
like a datum line amidst lakes and mountains.
<P>
I didn't at first see the connection between systematic social 
reorganisation and arbitrary novelties in dietary and costume, just 
as I didn't realise why the most comprehensive constructive projects 
should appear to be supported solely by odd and exceptional 
personalities.  On one of these evenings a little group of rather 
jolly-looking pretty young people seated themselves for no 
particular reason in a large circle on the floor of my study, and 
engaged, so far as I could judge, in the game of Hunt the Meaning, 
the intellectual equivalent of Hunt the Slipper.  It must have been 
that same evening I came upon an unbleached young gentleman before 
the oval mirror on the landing engaged in removing the remains of an 
anchovy sandwich from his protruded tongue--visible ends of cress 
having misled him into the belief that he was dealing with 
doctrinally permissible food.  It was not unusual to be given hand-
bills and printed matter by our guests, but there I had the 
advantage over Lewis, who was too tactful to refuse the stuff, too 
neatly dressed to pocket it, and had no writing-desk available upon 
which he could relieve himself in a manner flattering to the giver.  
So that his hands got fuller and fuller.  A relentless, compact 
little woman in what Margaret declared to be an extremely expensive 
black dress has also printed herself on my memory; she had set her 
heart upon my contributing to a weekly periodical in the lentil 
interest with which she was associated, and I spent much time and 
care in evading her.
<P>
Mingling with the more hygienic types were a number of Anti-Puritan 
Socialists, bulging with bias against temperance, and breaking out 
against austere methods of living all over their faces.  Their 
manner was packed with heartiness.  They were apt to choke the 
approaches to the little buffet Margaret had set up downstairs, and 
there engage in discussions of Determinism--it always seemed to be 
Determinism--which became heartier and noisier, but never 
acrimonious even in the small hours.  It seemed impossible to settle 
about this Determinism of theirs--ever.  And there were worldly 
Socialists also.  I particularly recall a large, active, buoyant, 
lady-killing individual with an eyeglass borne upon a broad black 
ribbon, who swam about us one evening.  He might have been a 
slightly frayed actor, in his large frock-coat, his white waistcoat, 
and the sort of black and white check trousers that twinkle.  He had 
a high-pitched voice with aristocratic intonations, and he seemed to 
be in a perpetual state of interrogation.  "What are we all he-a 
for?" he would ask only too audibly.  "What are we doing he-a?  
What's the connection?"
<P>
What WAS the connection?
<P>
We made a special effort with our last assembly in June, 1907.  We 
tried to get something like a representative collection of the 
parliamentary leaders of Socialism, the various exponents of 
Socialist thought and a number of Young Liberal thinkers into one 
room.  Dorvil came, and Horatio Bulch; Featherstonehaugh appeared 
for ten minutes and talked charmingly to Margaret and then vanished 
again; there was Wilkins the novelist and Toomer and Dr. Tumpany.  
Chris Robinson stood about for a time in a new comforter, and 
Magdeberg and Will Pipes and five or six Labour members.  And on our 
side we had our particular little group, Bunting Harblow, Crampton, 
Lewis, all looking as broad-minded and open to conviction as they 
possibly could, and even occasionally talking out from their bushes 
almost boldly.  But the gathering as a whole refused either to 
mingle or dispute, and as an experiment in intercourse the evening 
was a failure.  Unexpected dissociations appeared between Socialists 
one had supposed friendly.  I could not have imagined it was 
possible for half so many people to turn their backs on everybody 
else in such small rooms as ours.  But the unsaid things those backs 
expressed broke out, I remarked, with refreshed virulence in the 
various organs of the various sections of the party next week.
<P>
I talked, I rememher, with Dr. Tumpany, a large young man in a still 
larger professional frock-coat, and with a great shock of very fair 
hair, who was candidate for some North Country constituency.  We 
discussed the political outlook, and, like so many Socialists at 
that time, he was full of vague threatenings against the Liberal 
party.  I was struck by a thing in him that I had already observed 
less vividly in many others of these Socialist leaders, and which 
gave me at last a clue to the whole business.  He behaved exactly 
like a man in possession of valuable patent rights, who wants to be 
dealt with.  He had an air of having a corner in ideas.  Then it 
flashed into my head that the whole Socialist movement was an 
attempted corner in ideas. . . .
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Late that night I found myself alone with Margaret amid the debris 
of the gathering.
<P>
I sat before the fire, hands in pockets, and Margaret, looking white 
and weary, came and leant upon the mantel.
<P>
"Oh, Lord!" said Margaret.
<P>
I agreed.  Then I resumed my meditation.
<P>
"Ideas," I said, "count for more than I thought in the world."
<P>
Margaret regarded me with that neutral expression behind which she 
was accustomed to wait for clues.
<P>
"When you think of the height and depth and importance and wisdom of 
the Socialist ideas, and see the men who are running them," I 
explained. . . .  "A big system of ideas like Socialism grows up out 
of the obvious common sense of our present conditions.  It's as 
impersonal as science.  All these men--They've given nothing to it.  
They're just people who have pegged out claims upon a big 
intellectual No-Man's-Land--and don't feel quite sure of the law.  
There's a sort of quarrelsome uneasiness. . . .  If we professed 
Socialism do you think they'd welcome us?  Not a man of them!  
They'd feel it was burglary. . . ." 
<P>
"Yes," said Margaret, looking into the fire.  "That is just what I 
felt about them all the evening. . . .  Particularly Dr. Tumpany."
<P>
"We mustn't confuse Socialism with the Socialists, I said; "that's 
the moral of it.  I suppose if God were to find He had made a 
mistake in dates or something, and went back and annihilated 
everybody from Owen onwards who was in any way known as a Socialist 
leader or teacher, Socialism would be exactly where it is and what 
it is to-day--a growing realisation of constructive needs in every 
man's mind, and a little corner in party politics.  So, I suppose, 
it will always be. . . .  But they WERE a damned lot, Margaret!"
<P>
I looked up at the little noise she made.  "TWICE!" she said, 
smiling indulgently, "to-day!"  (Even the smile was Altiora's.)
<P>
I returned to my thoughts.  They WERE a damned human lot.  It was an 
excellent word in that connection. . . .
<P>
But the ideas marched on, the ideas marched on, just as though men's 
brains were no more than stepping-stones, just as though some great 
brain in which we are all little cells and corpuscles was thinking 
them! . . .
<P>
"I don't think there is a man among them who makes me feel he is 
trustworthy," said Margaret; "unless it is Featherstonehaugh."
<P>
I sat taking in this proposition.
<P>
"They'll never help us, I feel," said Margaret.
<P>
"Us?"
<P>
"The Liberals."
<P>
"Oh, damn the Liberals!" I said.  "They'll never even help 
themselves."
<P>
"I don't think I could possibly get on with any of those people," 
said Margaret, after a pause.
<P>
She remained for a time looking down at me and, I could feel, 
perplexed by me, but I wanted to go on with my thinking, and so I 
did not look up, and presently she stooped to my forehead and kissed 
me and went rustling softly to her room.
<P>
I remained in my study for a long time with my thoughts 
crystallising out. . . .
<P>
It was then, I think, that I first apprehended clearly how that 
opposition to which I have already alluded of the immediate life and 
the mental hinterland of a man, can be applied to public and social 
affairs.  The ideas go on--and no person or party succeeds in 
embodying them.  The reality of human progress never comes to the 
surface, it is a power in the deeps, an undertow.  It goes on in 
silence while men think, in studies where they write self-
forgetfully, in laboratories under the urgency of an impersonal 
curiosity, in the rare illumination of honest talk, in moments of 
emotional insight, in thoughtful reading, but not in everyday 
affairs.  Everyday affairs and whatever is made an everyday affair, 
are transactions of the ostensible self, the being of habits, 
interests, usage.  Temper, vanity, hasty reaction to imitation, 
personal feeling, are their substance.  No man can abolish his 
immediate self and specialise in the depths; if he attempt that, he 
simply turns himself into something a little less than the common 
man.  He may have an immense hinterland, but that does not absolve 
him from a frontage.  That is the essential error of the specialist 
philosopher, the specialist teacher, the specialist publicist.  They 
repudiate frontage; claim to be pure hinterland.  That is what 
bothered me about Codger, about those various schoolmasters who had 
prepared me for life, about the Baileys and their dream of an 
official ruling class.  A human being who is a philosopher in the 
first place, a teacher in the first place, or a statesman in the 
first place, is thereby and inevitably, though he bring God-like 
gifts to the pretence--a quack.  These are attempts to live deep-
side shallow, inside out.  They produce merely a new pettiness.  To 
understand Socialism, again, is to gain a new breadth of outlook; to 
join a Socialist organisation is to join a narrow cult which is not 
even tolerably serviceable in presenting or spreading the ideas for 
which it stands. . . .
<P>
I perceived I had got something quite fundamental here.  It had 
taken me some years to realise the true relation of the great 
constructive ideas that swayed me not only to political parties, but 
to myself.  I had been disposed to identify the formulae of some one 
party with social construction, and to regard the other as 
necessarily anti-constructive, just as I had been inclined to follow 
the Baileys in the self-righteousness of supposing myself to be 
wholly constructive.  But I saw now that every man of intellectual 
freedom and vigour is necessarily constructive-minded nowadays, and 
that no man is disinterestedly so.  Each one of us repeats in 
himself the conflict of the race between the splendour of its 
possibilities and its immediate associations.  We may be shaping 
immortal things, but we must sleep and answer the dinner gong, and 
have our salt of flattery and self-approval.  In politics a man 
counts not for what he is in moments of imaginative expansion, but 
for his common workaday, selfish self; and political parties are 
held together not by a community of ultimate aims, but by the 
stabler bond of an accustomed life.  Everybody almost is for 
progress in general, and nearly everybody is opposed to any change, 
except in so far as gross increments are change, in his particular 
method of living and behaviour.  Every party stands essentially for 
the interests and mental usages of some definite class or group of 
classes in the exciting community, and every party has its 
scientific-minded and constructive leading section, with well-
defined hinterlands formulating its social functions in a public-
spirited form, and its superficial-minded following confessing its 
meannesses and vanities and prejudices.  No class will abolish 
itself, materially alter its way of life, or drastically reconstruct 
itself, albeit no class is indisposed to co-operate in the unlimited 
socialisation of any other class.  In that capacity for aggression 
upon other classes lies the essential driving force of modern 
affairs.  The instincts, the persons, the parties, and vanities sway 
and struggle.  The ideas and understandings march on and achieve 
themselves for all--in spite of every one. . . .
<P>
The methods and traditions of British politics maintain the form of 
two great parties, with rider groups seeking to gain specific ends 
in the event of a small Government majority.  These two main parties 
are more or less heterogeneous in composition.  Each, however, has 
certain necessary characteristics.  The Conservative Party has 
always stood quite definitely for the established propertied 
interests.  The land-owner, the big lawyer, the Established Church, 
and latterly the huge private monopoly of the liquor trade which has 
been created by temperance legislation, are the essential 
Conservatives.  Interwoven now with the native wealthy are the 
families of the great international usurers, and a vast 
miscellaneous mass of financial enterprise.  Outside the range of 
resistance implied by these interests, the Conservative Party has 
always shown itself just as constructive and collectivist as any 
other party.  The great landowners have been as well-disposed 
towards the endowment of higher education, and as willing to co-
operate with the Church in protective and mildly educational 
legislation for children and the working class, as any political 
section.  The financiers, too, are adventurous-spirited and eager 
for mechanical progress and technical efficiency.  They are prepared 
to spend public money upon research, upon ports and harbours and 
public communications, upon sanitation and hygienic organisation.  A 
certain rude benevolence of public intention is equally 
characteristic of the liquor trade.  Provided his comfort leads to 
no excesses of temperance, the liquor trade is quite eager to see 
the common man prosperous, happy, and with money to spend in a bar.  
All sections of the party are aggressively patriotic and favourably 
inclined to the idea of an upstanding, well-fed, and well-exercised 
population in uniform.  Of course there are reactionary landowners 
and old-fashioned country clergy, full of localised self-importance, 
jealous even of the cottager who can read, but they have neither the 
power nor the ability to retard the constructive forces in the party 
as a whole.  On the other hand, when matters point to any definitely 
confiscatory proposal, to the public ownership and collective 
control of land, for example, or state mining and manufactures, or 
the nationalisation of the so-called public-house or extended 
municipal enterprise, or even to an increase of the taxation of 
property, then the Conservative Party presents a nearly adamantine 
bar.  It does not stand for, it IS, the existing arrangement in 
these affairs.
<P>
Even more definitely a class party is the Labour Party, whose 
immediate interest is to raise wages, shorten hours of labor, 
increase employment, and make better terms for the working-man 
tenant and working-man purchaser.  Its leaders are no doubt 
constructive minded, but the mass of the following is naturally 
suspicious of education and discipline, hostile to the higher 
education, and--except for an obvious antagonism to employers and 
property owners--almost destitute of ideas.  What else can it be?  
It stands for the expropriated multitude, whose whole situation and 
difficulty arise from its individual lack of initiative and 
organising power.  It favours the nationalisation of land and 
capital with no sense of the difficulties involved in the process; 
but, on the other hand, the equally reasonable socialisation of 
individuals which is implied by military service is steadily and 
quite naturally and quite illogically opposed by it.  It is only in 
recent years that Labour has emerged as a separate party from the 
huge hospitable caravanserai of Liberalism, and there is still a 
very marked tendency to step back again into that multitudinous 
assemblage.
<P>
For multitudinousness has always been the Liberal characteristic.  
Liberalism never has been nor ever can be anything but a diversified 
crowd.  Liberalism has to voice everything that is left out by these 
other parties.  It is the party against the predominating interests.  
It is at once the party of the failing and of the untried; it is the 
party of decadence and hope.  From its nature it must be a vague and 
planless association in comparison with its antagonist, neither so 
constructive on the one hand, nor on the other so competent to 
hinder the inevitable constructions of the civilised state.  
Essentially it is the party of criticism, the "Anti" party.  It is a 
system of hostilities and objections that somehow achieves at times 
an elusive common soul.  It is a gathering together of all the 
smaller interests which find themselves at a disadvantage against 
the big established classes, the leasehold tenant as against the 
landowner, the retail tradesman as against the merchant and the 
moneylender, the Nonconformist as against the Churchman, the small 
employer as against the demoralising hospitable publican, the man 
without introductions and broad connections against the man who has 
these things.  It is the party of the many small men against the 
fewer prevailing men.  It has no more essential reason for loving 
the Collectivist state than the Conservatives; the small dealer is 
doomed to absorption in that just as much as the large owner; but it 
resorts to the state against its antagonists as in the middle ages 
common men pitted themselves against the barons by siding with the 
king.  The Liberal Party is the party against "class privilege" 
because it represents no class advantages, but it is also the party 
that is on the whole most set against Collective control because it 
represents no established responsilibity.  It is constructive only 
so far as its antagonism to the great owner is more powerful than 
its jealousy of the state.  It organises only because organisation 
is forced upon it by the organisation of its adversaries.  It lapses 
in and out of alliance with Labour as it sways between hostility to 
wealth and hostility to public expenditure. . . .
<P>
Every modern European state will have in some form or other these 
three parties: the resistent, militant, authoritative, dull, and 
unsympathetic party of establishment and success, the rich party; 
the confused, sentimental, spasmodic, numerous party of the small, 
struggling, various, undisciplined men, the poor man's party; and a 
third party sometimes detaching itself from the second and sometimes 
reuniting with it, the party of the altogether expropriated masses, 
the proletarians, Labour.  Change Conservative and Liberal to 
Republican and Democrat, for example, and you have the conditions in 
the United States.  The Crown or a dethroned dynasty, the 
Established Church or a dispossessed church, nationalist secessions, 
the personalities of party leaders, may break up, complicate, and 
confuse the self-expression of these three necessary divisions in 
the modern social drama, the analyst will make them out none the 
less for that. . . .
<P>
And then I came back as if I came back to a refrain;--the ideas go 
on--as though we are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in 
some great brain beyond our understanding. . . .
<P>
So it was I sat and thought my problem out. . . .  I still remember 
my satisfaction at seeing things plainly at last.  It was like 
clouds dispersing to show the sky.  Constructive ideas, of course, 
couldn't hold a party together alone, "interests and habits, not 
ideas," I had that now, and so the great constructive scheme of 
Socialism, invading and inspiring all parties, was necessarily 
claimed only by this collection of odds and ends, this residuum of 
disconnected and exceptional people.  This was true not only of the 
Socialist idea, but of the scientific idea, the idea of veracity--of 
human confidence in humanity--of all that mattered in human life 
outside the life of individuals. . . .  The only real party that 
would ever profess Socialism was the Labour Party, and that in the 
entirely one-sided form of an irresponsible and non-constructive 
attack on property.  Socialism in that mutilated form, the teeth and 
claws without the eyes and brain, I wanted as little as I wanted 
anything in the world.
<P>
Perfectly clear it was, perfectly clear, and why hadn't I seen it 
before? . . .  I looked at my watch, and it was half-past two.
<P>
I yawned, stretched, got up and went to bed.

My ideas about statecraft have passed through three main phases to 
the final convictions that remain.  There was the first immediacy of 
my dream of ports and harbours and cities, railways, roads, and 
administered territories--the vision I had seen in the haze from 
that little church above Locarno.  Slowly that had passed into a 
more elaborate legislative constructiveness, which had led to my 
uneasy association with the Baileys and the professedly constructive 
Young Liberals.  To get that ordered life I had realised the need of 
organisation, knowledge, expertness, a wide movement of co-ordinated 
methods.  On the individual side I thought that a life of urgent 
industry, temperance, and close attention was indicated by my 
perception of these ends.  I married Margaret and set to work.  But 
something in my mind refused from the outset to accept these 
determinations as final.  There was always a doubt lurking below, 
always a faint resentment, a protesting criticism, a feeling of 
vitally important omissions.
<P>
I arrived at last at the clear realisation that my political 
associates, and I in my association with them, were oddly narrow, 
priggish, and unreal, that the Socialists with whom we were 
attempting co-operation were preposterously irrelevant to their own 
theories, that my political life didn't in some way comprehend more 
than itself, that rather perplexingly I was missing the thing I was 
seeking.  Britten's footnotes to Altiora's self-assertions, her fits 
of energetic planning, her quarrels and rallies and vanities, his 
illuminating attacks on Cramptonism and the heavy-spirited 
triviality of such Liberalism as the Children's Charter, served to 
point my way to my present conclusions.  I had been trying to deal 
all along with human progress as something immediate in life, 
something to be immediately attacked by political parties and groups 
pointing primarily to that end.  I now began to see that just as in 
my own being there was the rather shallow, rather vulgar, self-
seeking careerist, who wore an admirable silk hat and bustled self-
consciously through the lobby, and a much greater and indefinitely 
growing unpublished personality behind him--my hinterland, I have 
called it--so in human affairs generally the permanent reality is 
also a hinterland, which is never really immediate, which draws 
continually upon human experience and influences human action more 
and more, but which is itself never the actual player upon the 
stage.  It is the unseen dramatist who never takes a call.  Now it 
was just through the fact that our group about the Baileys didn't 
understand this, that with a sort of frantic energy they were trying 
to develop that sham expert officialdom of theirs to plan, regulate, 
and direct the affairs of humanity, that the perplexing note of 
silliness and shallowness that I had always felt and felt now most 
acutely under Britten's gibes, came in.  They were neglecting human 
life altogether in social organisation.
<P>
In the development of intellectual modesty lies the growth of 
statesmanship.  It has been the chronic mistake of statecraft and 
all organising spirits to attempt immediately to scheme and arrange 
and achieve.  Priests, schools of thought, political schemers, 
leaders of men, have always slipped into the error of assuming that 
they can think out the whole--or at any rate completely think out 
definite parts--of the purpose and future of man, clearly and 
finally; they have set themselves to legislate and construct on that 
assumption, and, experiencing the perplexing obduracy and evasions 
of reality, they have taken to dogma, persecution, training, 
pruning, secretive education; and all the stupidities of self-
sufficient energy.  In the passion of their good intentions they 
have not hesitated to conceal fact, suppress thought, crush 
disturbing initiatives and apparently detrimental desires.  And so 
it is blunderingly and wastefully, destroying with the making, that 
any extension of social organisation is at present achieved.
<P>
Directly, however, this idea of an emancipation from immediacy is 
grasped, directly the dominating importance of this critical, less 
personal, mental hinterland in the individual and of the collective 
mind in the race is understood, the whole problem of the statesman 
and his attitude towards politics gain a new significance, and 
becomes accessible to a new series of solutions.  He wants no longer 
to "fix up," as people say, human affairs, but to devote his forces 
to the development of that needed intellectual life without which 
all his shallow attempts at fixing up are futile.  He ceases to 
build on the sands, and sets himself to gather foundations.
<P>
You see, I began in my teens by wanting to plan and build cities and 
harbours for mankind; I ended in the middle thirties by desiring 
only to serve and increase a general process of thought, a process 
fearless, critical, real-spirited, that would in its own time give 
cities, harbours, air, happiness, everything at a scale and quality 
and in a light altogether beyond the match-striking imaginations of 
a contemporary mind.  I wanted freedom of speech and suggestion, 
vigour of thought, and the cultivation of that impulse of veracity 
that lurks more or less discouraged in every man.  With that I felt 
there must go an emotion.  I hit upon a phrase that became at last 
something of a refrain in my speech and writings, to convey the 
spirit that I felt was at the very heart of real human progress--
love and fine thinking.
<P>
(I suppose that nowadays no newspaper in England gets through a week 
without the repetition of that phrase.)
<P>
My convictions crystallised more and more definitely upon this.  The 
more of love and fine thinking the better for men, I said; the less, 
the worse.  And upon this fresh basis I set myself to examine what I 
as a politician might do.  I perceived I was at last finding an 
adequate expression for all that was in me, for those forces that 
had rebelled at the crude presentations of Bromstead, at the 
secrecies and suppressions of my youth, at the dull unrealities of 
City Merchants, at the conventions and timidities of the Pinky 
Dinkys, at the philosophical recluse of Trinity and the phrases and 
tradition-worship of my political associates.  None of these things 
were half alive, and I wanted life to be intensely alive and awake.  
I wanted thought like an edge of steel and desire like a flame.  The 
real work before mankind now, I realised once and for all, is the 
enlargement of human expression, the release and intensification of 
human thought, the vivider utilisation of experience and the 
invigoration of research--and whatever one does in human affairs has 
or lacks value as it helps or hinders that.
<P>
With that I had got my problem clear, and the solution, so far as I 
was concerned, lay in finding out the point in the ostensible life 
of politics at which I could most subserve these ends.  I was still 
against the muddles of Bromstead, but I had hunted them down now to 
their essential form.  The jerry-built slums, the roads that went 
nowhere, the tarred fences, litigious notice-boards and barbed wire 
fencing, the litter and the heaps of dump, were only the outward 
appearances whose ultimate realities were jerry-built conclusions, 
hasty purposes, aimless habits of thought, and imbecile bars and 
prohibitions in the thoughts and souls of men.  How are we through 
politics to get at that confusion?
<P>
We want to invigorate and reinvigorate education.  We want to create 
a sustained counter effort to the perpetual tendency of all 
educational organisations towards classicalism, secondary issues, 
and the evasion of life.
<P>
We want to stimulate the expression of life through art and 
literature, and its exploration through research.
<P>
We want to make the best and finest thought accessible to every one, 
and more particularly to create and sustain an enormous free 
criticism, without which art, literature, and research alike 
degenerate into tradition or imposture.
<P>
Then all the other problems which are now so insoluble, destitution, 
disease, the difficulty of maintaining international peace, the 
scarcely faced possibility of making life generally and continually 
beautiful, become--EASY. . . .
<P>
It was clear to me that the most vital activities in which I could 
engage would be those which most directly affected the Church, 
public habits of thought, education, organised research, literature, 
and the channels of general discussion.  I had to ask myself how my 
position as Liberal member for Kinghamstead squared with and 
conduced to this essential work.
