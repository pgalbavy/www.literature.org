THE SAGOTHS WERE GAINING ON US RAPIDLY, FOR once they
had sighted us they had greatly increased their speed.
On and on we stumbled up the narrow canyon that Ghak had
chosen to approach the heights of Sari.  On either side
rose precipitous cliffs of gorgeous, parti-colored rock,
while beneath our feet a thick mountain grass formed a soft
and noiseless carpet.  Since we had entered the canyon we
had had no glimpse of our pursuers, and I was commencing
to hope that they had lost our trail and that we would
reach the now rapidly nearing cliffs in time to scale them
before we should be overtaken.
<P>
Ahead we neither saw nor heard any sign which might
betoken the success of Hooja's mission.  By now he
should have reached the outposts of the Sarians, and we
should at least hear the savage cries of the tribesmen
as they swarmed to arms in answer to their king's appeal
for succor.  In another moment the frowning cliffs ahead
should be black with primeval warriors.  But nothing
of the kind happened--as a matter of fact the Sly One
had betrayed us.  At the moment that we expected to see
Sarian spearmen charging to our relief at Hooja's back,
the craven traitor was sneaking around the outskirts
of the nearest Sarian village, that he might come up
from the other side when it was too late to save us,
claiming that he had become lost among the mountains.
<P>
Hooja still harbored ill will against me because of the blow
I had struck in Dian's protection, and his malevolent spirit
was equal to sacrificing us all that he might be revenged upon
me.
<P>
As we drew nearer the barrier cliffs and no sign of rescuing
Sarians appeared Ghak became both angry and alarmed,
and presently as the sound of rapidly approaching pursuit
fell upon our ears, he called to me over his shoulder
that we were lost.
<P>
A backward glance gave me a glimpse of the first of
the Sagoths at the far end of a considerable stretch
of canyon through which we had just passed, and then
a sudden turning shut the ugly creature from my view;
but the loud howl of triumphant rage which rose behind
us was evidence that the gorilla-man had sighted us.
<P>
Again the canyon veered sharply to the left, but to the
right another branch ran on at a lesser deviation from
the general direction, so that appeared more like the main
canyon than the lefthand branch.  The Sagoths were now
not over two hundred and fifty yards behind us, and I saw
that it was hopeless for us to expect to escape other than
by a ruse.  There was a bare chance of saving Ghak and Perry,
and as I reached the branching of the canyon I took the chance.
<P>
Pausing there I waited until the foremost Sagoth hove
into sight.  Ghak and Perry had disappeared around a bend
in the left-hand canyon, and as the Sagoth's savage
yell announced that he had seen me I turned and fled
up the right-hand branch.  My ruse was successful,
and the entire party of man-hunters raced headlong after
me up one canyon while Ghak bore Perry to safety up the other.
<P>
Running has never been my particular athletic forte,
and now when my very life depended upon fleetness of foot
I cannot say that I ran any better than on the occasions
when my pitiful base running had called down upon my head
the rooter's raucous and reproachful cries of "Ice Wagon,"
and "Call a cab."
<P>
The Sagoths were gaining on me rapidly.  There was
one in particular, fleeter than his fellows, who was
perilously close.  The canyon had become a rocky slit,
rising roughly at a steep angle toward what seemed a pass
between two abutting peaks.  What lay beyond I could
not even guess--possibly a sheer drop of hundreds of feet
into the corresponding valley upon the other side.
Could it be that I had plunged into a cul-de-sac?
<P>
Realizing that I could not hope to outdistance the Sagoths
to the top of the canyon I had determined to risk all
in an attempt to check them temporarily, and to this
end had unslung my rudely made bow and plucked an arrow
from the skin quiver which hung behind my shoulder.
As I fitted the shaft with my right hand I stopped
and wheeled toward the gorilla-man.
<P>
In the world of my birth I never had drawn a shaft,
but since our escape from Phutra I had kept the party
supplied with small game by means of my arrows, and so,
through necessity, had developed a fair degree of accuracy.
During our flight from Phutra I had restrung my bow with a piece
of heavy gut taken from a huge tiger which Ghak and I had
worried and finally dispatched with arrows, spear, and sword.
The hard wood of the bow was extremely tough and this,
with the strength and elasticity of my new string,
gave me unwonted confidence in my weapon.
<P>
Never had I greater need of steady nerves than then--never
were my nerves and muscles under better control.
I sighted as carefully and deliberately as though at
a straw target.  The Sagoth had never before seen a bow
and arrow, but of a sudden it must have swept over his dull
intellect that the thing I held toward him was some sort
of engine of destruction, for he too came to a halt,
simultaneously swinging his hatchet for a throw.
It is one of the many methods in which they employ
this weapon, and the accuracy of aim which they achieve,
even under the most unfavorable circumstances, is little
short of miraculous.
<P>
My shaft was drawn back its full length--my eye had centered
its sharp point upon the left breast of my adversary;
and then he launched his hatchet and I released my arrow.
At the instant that our missiles flew I leaped to one side,
but the Sagoth sprang forward to follow up his attack
with a spear thrust.  I felt the swish of the hatchet
at it grazed my head, and at the same instant my shaft
pierced the Sagoth's savage heart, and with a single groan
he lunged almost at my feet--stone dead.  Close behind
him were two more--fifty yards perhaps--but the distance
gave me time to snatch up the dead guardsman's shield,
for the close call his hatchet had just given me had borne
in upon me the urgent need I had for one.  Those which I
had purloined at Phutra we had not been able to bring along
because their size precluded our concealing them within
the skins of the Mahars which had brought us safely from
the city.
<P>
With the shield slipped well up on my left arm I let fly
with another arrow, which brought down a second Sagoth,
and then as his fellow's hatchet sped toward me I caught
it upon the shield, and fitted another shaft for him;
but he did not wait to receive it.  Instead, he turned and
retreated toward the main body of gorilla-men. Evidently he
had seen enough of me for the moment.
<P>
Once more I took up my flight, nor were the Sagoths
apparently overanxious to press their pursuit so closely
as before.  Unmolested I reached the top of the canyon
where I found a sheer drop of two or three hundred feet
to the bottom of a rocky chasm; but on the left a narrow
ledge rounded the shoulder of the overhanging cliff.
Along this I advanced, and at a sudden turning,
a few yards beyond the canyon's end, the path widened,
and at my left I saw the opening to a large cave.
Before, the ledge continued until it passed from sight
about another projecting buttress of the mountain.
<P>
Here, I felt, I could defy an army, for but a single
foeman could advance upon me at a time, nor could he know
that I was awaiting him until he came full upon me around
the corner of the turn.  About me lay scattered stones
crumbled from the cliff above.  They were of various
sizes and shapes, but enough were of handy dimensions
for use as ammunition in lieu of my precious arrows.
Gathering a number of stones into a little pile beside
the mouth of the cave I waited the advance of the Sagoths.
<P>
As I stood there, tense and silent, listening for the
first faint sound that should announce the approach
of my enemies, a slight noise from within the cave's
black depths attracted my attention.  It might have
been produced by the moving of the great body of some
huge beast rising from the rock floor of its lair.
At almost the same instant I thought that I caught the
scraping of hide sandals upon the ledge beyond the turn.
For the next few seconds my attention was considerably divided.
<P>
And then from the inky blackness at my right I saw two
flaming eyes glaring into mine.  They were on a level
that was over two feet above my head.  It is true that the
beast who owned them might be standing upon a ledge within
the cave, or that it might be rearing up upon its hind legs;
but I had seen enough of the monsters of Pellucidar to know
that I might be facing some new and frightful Titan whose
dimensions and ferocity eclipsed those of any I had seen before.
<P>
Whatever it was, it was coming slowly toward the entrance
of the cave, and now, deep and forbidding, it uttered a low
and ominous growl.  I waited no longer to dispute possession
of the ledge with the thing which owned that voice.
The noise had not been loud--I doubt if the Sagoths heard
it at all--but the suggestion of latent possibilities
behind it was such that I knew it would only emanate
from a gigantic and ferocious beast.
<P>
As I backed along the ledge I soon was past the mouth
of the cave, where I no longer could see those fearful
flaming eyes, but an instant later I caught sight of the
fiendish face of a Sagoth as it warily advanced beyond
the cliff's turn on the far side of the cave's mouth.
As the fellow saw me he leaped along the ledge in pursuit,
and after him came as many of his companions as could
crowd upon each other's heels.  At the same time the beast
emerged from the cave, so that he and the Sagoths came
face to face upon that narrow ledge.
<P>
The thing was an enormous cave bear, rearing its colossal
bulk fully eight feet at the shoulder, while from the tip
of its nose to the end of its stubby tail it was fully twelve
feet in length.  As it sighted the Sagoths it emitted a most
frightful roar, and with open mouth charged full upon them.
With a cry of terror the foremost gorilla-man turned to escape,
but behind him he ran full upon his on-rushing companions.
<P>
The horror of the following seconds is indescribable.
The Sagoth nearest the cave bear, finding his escape
blocked, turned and leaped deliberately to an awful
death upon the jagged rocks three hundred feet below.
Then those giant jaws reached out and gathered in the
next--there was a sickening sound of crushing bones,
and the mangled corpse was dropped over the cliff's edge.
Nor did the mighty beast even pause in his steady advance
along the ledge.
<P>
Shrieking Sagoths were now leaping madly over the precipice
to escape him, and the last I saw he rounded the turn still
pursuing the demoralized remnant of the man hunters.
For a long time I could hear the horrid roaring of the brute
intermingled with the screams and shrieks of his victims,
until finally the awful sounds dwindled and disappeared
in the distance.
<P>
Later I learned from Ghak, who had finally come to his
tribesmen and returned with a party to rescue me,
that the ryth, as it is called, pursued the Sagoths until
it had exterminated the entire band.  Ghak was, of course,
positive that I had fallen prey to the terrible creature,
which, within Pellucidar, is truly the king of beasts.
<P>
Not caring to venture back into the canyon, where I
might fall prey either to the cave bear or the Sagoths I
continued on along the ledge, believing that by following
around the mountain I could reach the land of Sari from
another direction.  But I evidently became confused by the
twisting and turning of the canyons and gullies, for I did
not come to the land of Sari then, nor for a long time
thereafter.
<P>
