<p>Before the party fell to work, the driver walked to the edge
of the lake and tied his white handkerchief to the limb of a tree,
which projected over the water. There was enough breeze to make
it flutter, and the background of emerald brought it out with
vivid distinctness. It was the signal to the bungalow that the
chuck wagon, as they called it, had arrived, and the two canoes
were to be sent across the lake for the supplies. Since it was
expected at a certain time, our friends were on the watch for
it. Within ten minutes after the piece of linen was fastened in
place, the large canoes, each containing two persons, one of whom
was Scout Master Hall, were seen heading for the spot where the
provisions were awaiting them. It does not take a man and four
lusty boys long to prepare a wagon load of such freight for shipment
by water, and the cargo was ready a good while before the arrival
of the craft.</p>

<p>The driver, who announced that he was "Jake," sat on one of the
boxes, lighted a corncob pipe and talked with the lads. Although
he was rough of speech and at times inclined to profanity, the
young men treated him with respect, and by their unvarying courtesy
won his good will. He asked many questions and told them a good
deal about himself; in short, they became quite chummy.</p>

<p>The two canoes had passed most of the distance when Jake abruptly
asked:</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of Asa and Bige Carter?"</p>

<p>"Who are they?" asked Alvin in turn, although he had heard the
names before.</p>

<p>"I thought everybody knowed Asa and Bige; they’re twin brothers,
and two of the darndest chaps that ever lived."</p>

<p>This description, so far as it went, was not enlightening. Chester
said:</p>

<p>"Those must have been the two men that called on Uncle Elk this
morning and went off with him in their canoe. So far as we could
see they look exactly alike."</p>

<p>"That’s them," replied Jake with a nod of his head. "Did the
three come this way in their canoe?"</p>

<p>"They seemed to be heading for this place."</p>

<p>"That settles it; they was Asa and Bige. I expected them to meet
me here," and Jake peered around in the wood, but without seeing
anything of his friends.</p>

<p>"What might ye maan by spaking of them as two of the darndest
chaps that ever lived?" asked Mike, who, as did his companions,
hoped they had struck a lead that might yield them something worth
while.</p>

<p>"Why, they’re just like a couple of Irishmen."</p>

<p>"Arrah now, but what model gintlemen they must be! It will be
an honor for us to make their acquaintance."</p>

<p>Jake’s reply to this was to snatch off his straw hat, throw back
his head and roar with laughter. Determined to probe farther,
Alvin asked:</p>

<p>"What is there peculiar about the twin brothers?"</p>

<p>"Now, you jist wait till you meet ’em and you’ll find out. I’ll
only warn you to keep your eyes wide open, or they’ll close ’em
for you. Wal, the folks have about arriv."</p>

<p>All rose to their feet and greeted their friends who were now
within a short distance. The water was so deep that the light
craft were able to lie broadside against the bank. It required
skill and hard labor to get a portion of the freight aboard, but
in due time it was accomplished.</p>

<p>"We are pretty heavily loaded," remarked Scout Master Hall, "but
the lake is smooth and we can easily make two or three trips.
We can divide you four between us."</p>

<p>"It’s blamed risky," commented Jake, "but I guess it can be did
if you’re all mighty keerful."</p>

<p>Mr. Hall insisted that he and his three companions should change
places with the others, but this arrangement would have defeated
the scheme Alvin and his chums had in mind. Without revealing
their object, they begged off and secured a compromise by which
Hoke Butler was to return in one of the canoes, while the trio
would walk home. In truth, Hoke was so tired from his long tramp
that he was pleased by the plan.</p>

<p>"But I won’t go, Mike, if you’re going to feel bad about it,"
he remarked before sitting down in the boat that was about to
shove off.</p>

<p>"Av coorse me heart is nearly broke," said Mike, "but it’s yer
own comfort I’m thinking of, as Larry McWhymper said whin he put
a brick in the bag for the cat he was drowning to set on and pass
away comfortable. But I’m cheered by the hope of maating ye at
supper time. Good luck to ye!"</p>

<p>The two craft, sunk almost to their gunwales, moved slowly across
the mirror-like lake, reaching their destination without mishap,
and returning for the last loads.</p>

<p>Jake looked at the three youths.</p>

<p>"You’ve got a mighty hard tramp afore you; if there was a road
I’d take you home in my wagon."</p>

<p>"We don’t mind it," was the cheery reply of Alvin.</p>

<p>"Besides, if we feel like resting our legs and using our arms,
we can borrow Dr. Spellman’s boat; his home isn’t far off. Do
you go back at once?"</p>

<p>"I’ve a great mind to; it would serve Asa and Bige right if I
did, but I’ll hang round a half hour or so and not a blamed bit
longer, for I must git home afore dark."</p>

<p>"Then we shall bid you good bye," said Alvin shaking hands with
the countryman, as did the others, all expressing the hope of
soon meeting him again. Since it was he who regularly brought
the supplies to this point, there seemed to be no reason why the
mutual wish should not be gratified. Jake refilled and relighted
his pipe, sitting on a fallen tree and showing by his vigorous
puffs that he was not in the most patient of moods.</p>

<p>The three boys did not speak until sure they were beyond sight
of Jake. Then they halted.</p>

<p>"Do you think he suspects anything?" asked Alvin, unconsciously
lowering his voice.</p>

<p>"Why should he?" asked Chester.</p>

<p>"He suspicts we’re thramping for home," remarked Mike, "which
the same is what we wish him to belave."</p>

<p>It will be understood that our young friends were resolute to
learn all that was possible about the mystery that had tantalized
them for the past day or two. Beyond a doubt the twin brothers
were connected with it, and since Jake was awaiting their coming,
it looked as if the boys had a fair chance of learning something.</p>

<p>They separated, and each began an approach to the driver and
his team that was meant to be so cautious that Jake would not
detect them. The very care used by each well nigh defeated its
purpose. It fell to Alvin to catch the first enlightening glimpse
of the countryman and that which he saw astonished him.</p>

<p>The Carter brothers must have been waiting near at hand for the
departure of the boys, for in the brief interval since then they
had come forward, loaded something in the wagon and covered it
with a big sheet of soiled canvas. Whatever it was, its size was
such that it filled the whole interior, and crowded against the
seat in front. It towered several feet above the sides and suggested
a load of hay, protected against a drenching rain.</p>

<p>"What can it be?" Alvin muttered, "and why are they so particular
with it?" which questions were self asked by Chester and Mike,
with none able to frame an answer.</p>

<p>Having loaded the wagon, the brothers proceeded carefully to
tuck in the precious burden as if afraid jealous eyes might see
it. Finally all was satisfactory and the three men climbed to
the front seat. They had to sit snugly, but there was enough room.
Jake was on the extreme right, where he could crack his whip without
hindrance.</p>

<p>He glanced behind him, as if to make sure everything was right,
jerked the reins, circled the whip lash which gave out an explosion
like that of a fire cracker, and the sturdy horses bent to their
task of dragging the wagon and its contents through the woods
into the more open country, where the smoother highway made the
task easy.</p>

<p>All three men crowded on the front seat were smoking. Jake stuck
to his corncob pipe, but each brother sported a cigar, which by
a special arrangement with Porter, the druggist in Boothbay Harbor,
they bought for two cents apiece,—far in excess of their worth,
as any one would decide who tested them, or even caught their
odor. With all puffing vigorously, one might fancy that they instead
of the horses supplied the motive power.</p>

<p>From where Alvin Landon stood behind the trunk of a large tree
and peeped out, he saw that the brothers were doing a good deal
of laughing, as if they recalled some humorous incident. Bige
gave the particulars to Jake, who was so pleased that he threw
back his head and made the forest ring with his laughter.</p>

<p>Since the backs of the men were turned toward the boys, the latter
did not fear to come together to discuss their next step.</p>

<p>"I don’t see that we have learned more than we knew before,"
remarked Alvin disgustedly; "what do you suppose they have covered
up in that wagon?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea," replied Chester.</p>

<p>"Let’s folly the team till it gets back to Bovil or wherever
the same may be going. Better still," added Mike, "we can slip
up behind, lift the lid, and get a peep at the cratur himself."</p>

<p>"How do you know what it may be?"</p>

<p>"I don’t, which is why I want to find out, and the same is thrue
of yersilves."</p>

<p>They gave over the plan for more than one reason. There was no
saying how many miles they would have to tramp, and they could
not go far without being discovered by the men. Then the situation,
to say the least, would become embarrassing.</p>

<p>"I have the belief that we are near the solution," said Alvin,
"and we can afford to wait a day or two longer. We have several
miles ahead and may as well place them behind us before nightfall.
Come on."</p>

<p>Good taste suggested that having called upon Dr. Spellman so
recently they should pass him by on their return to the bungalow.
This was done and they reached home without further incident.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the wagon with its mysterious load was lurching and
plunging over the primitive road, the three men on the front seat
retaining their places with no little difficulty, but they were
used to such traveling and no mishap followed.</p>

<p>Shortly after reaching the smoother highway, Bige Carter with
another laugh exclaimed:</p>

<p>"By jingo! there they be!"</p>

<p>"You’re right; that’s them," added his brother.</p>

<p>The two tramps, who have already figured to some extent in these
pages, were descried as the team turned a corner, walking in the
middle of the road. He who had lost his hat had managed in some
way to secure another. Half of the rim was missing and his frowsy
hair showed through the crown. As the rattle of wheels reached
their ears, he who was known as Biggs looked around. Immediately
the paths of the two diverged, one going to the right and the
other to the left of the highway. Both limped as if the act of
walking was painful. Naturally the team soon overtook them. Jake,
who had been talking the matter over with his friends, stopped
his horses.</p>

<p>"Whoa! wouldn’t you gentlemen like me to give you a lift?"</p>

<p>"Now ye’re shouting, boss," replied Biggs as he and his companion
each approached a front wagon wheel, "but where are yer going
to put us?"</p>

<p>"You won’t mind setting on the bottom of the wagon in front of
the stuff piled there?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, boss; ye’re a trump."</p>

<p>Resting one ragged shoe on a hub, the hobos clambered in and
sat down behind the three men, who said nothing but tried to restrain
their chuckling. They knew what was coming.</p>

<p>Biggs and Hutt drew up their legs and compressed themselves as
much as possible. Still, with the best they could do they were
cramped. It seemed to Biggs that a slight shifting of the freight
behind them would help matters. He hesitated for a minute or two
and then stealthily raised one corner of the canvas covering,
his companion watching him.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the revelation burst upon the two in
the same instant. A howl of terror rang out from each, as they
bounded to their feet and dived over the side of the wagon. They
forgot their lameness, and ran in the direction of Gosling Lake
as if they were contestants at Stockholm for the Marathon prize.
That single peep under the canvas had shown the same appalling
thing that drove them headlong from the canoe. It was actually
near enough to touch them, and the wonder was that they were not
smitten with a mortal dread.</p>

<p>As Jake and Bige and Asa rode on they were so convulsed with
merriment that they surely would have fallen from their seats
had not the highway been smooth and the pace of the horses a slow
walk. </p>
