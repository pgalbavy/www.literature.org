<p>An ingeniously constructed framework of light posts and thin
laths occupied the greater part of the deck amidships of the Emma.
The four walls of that airy structure were made of muslin. It
was comparatively lofty. A door-like arrangement of light battens
filled with calico was further protected by a system of curtains
calculated to baffle the pursuit of mosquitoes that haunted the
shores of the lagoon in great singing clouds from sunset till
sunrise. A lot of fine mats covered the deck space within the
transparent shelter devised by Lingard and Jorgenson to make Mrs.
Travers' existence possible during the time when the fate of the
two men, and indeed probably of everybody else on board the Emma,
had to hang in the balance. Very soon Lingard's unbidden and fatal
guests had learned the trick of stepping in and out of the place
quickly. Mr. d'Alcacer performed the feat without apparent haste,
almost nonchalantly, yet as well as anybody. It was generally
conceded that he had never let a mosquito in together with himself.
Mr. Travers dodged in and out without grace and was obviously
much irritated at the necessity. Mrs. Travers did it in a manner
all her own, with marked cleverness and an unconscious air. There
was an improvised table in there and some wicker armchairs which
Jorgenson had produced from somewhere in the depths of the ship.
It was hard to say what the inside of the Emma did not contain.
It was crammed with all sorts of goods like a general store. That
old hulk was the arsenal and the war-chest of Lingard's political
action; she was stocked with muskets and gunpowder, with bales
of longcloth, of cotton prints, of silks; with bags of rice and
currency brass guns. She contained everything necessary for dealing
death and distributing bribes, to act on the cupidity and upon
the fears of men, to march and to organize, to feed the friends
and to combat the enemies of the cause. She held wealth and power
in her flanks, that grounded ship that would swim no more, without
masts and with the best part of her deck cumbered by the two structures
of thin boards and of transparent muslin.</p>

<p>Within the latter lived the Europeans, visible in the daytime
to the few Malays on board as if through a white haze. In the
evening the lighting of the hurricane lamps inside turned them
into dark phantoms surrounded by a shining mist, against which
the insect world rushing in its millions out of the forest on
the bank was baffled mysteriously in its assault. Rigidly enclosed
by transparent walls, like captives of an enchanted cobweb, they
moved about, sat, gesticulated, conversed publicly during the
day; and at night when all the lanterns but one were extinguished,
their slumbering shapes covered all over by white cotton sheets
on the camp bedsteads, which were brought in every evening, conveyed
the gruesome suggestion of dead bodies reposing on stretchers.
The food, such as it was, was served within that glorified mosquito
net which everybody called the "Cage" without any humorous intention.
At meal times the party from the yacht had the company of Lingard
who attached to this ordeal a sense of duty performed at the altar
of civility and conciliation. He could have no conception how
much his presence added to the exasperation of Mr. Travers because
Mr. Travers' manner was too intensely consistent to present any
shades. It was determined by an ineradicable conviction that he
was a victim held to ransom on some incomprehensible terms by
an extraordinary and outrageous bandit. This conviction, strung
to the highest pitch, never left him for a moment, being the object
of indignant meditation to his mind, and even clinging, as it
were, to his very body. It lurked in his eyes, in his gestures,
in his ungracious mutters, and in his sinister silences. The shock
to his moral being had ended by affecting Mr. Travers' physical
machine. He was aware of hepatic pains, suffered from accesses
of somnolence and suppressed gusts of fury which frightened him
secretly. His complexion had acquired a yellow tinge, while his
heavy eyes had become bloodshot because of the smoke of the open
wood fires during his three days' detention inside Belarab's stockade.
His eyes had been always very sensitive to outward conditions.
D'Alcacer's fine black eyes were more enduring and his appearance
did not differ very much from his ordinary appearance on board
the yacht. He had accepted with smiling thanks the offer of a
thin blue flannel tunic from Jorgenson. Those two men were much
of the same build, though of course d'Alcacer, quietly alive and
spiritually watchful, did not resemble Jorgenson, who, without
being exactly macabre, behaved more like an indifferent but restless
corpse. Those two could not be said to have ever conversed together.
Conversation with Jorgenson was an impossible thing. Even Lingard
never attempted the feat. He propounded questions to Jorgenson
much as a magician would interrogate an evoked shade, or gave
him curt directions as one would make use of some marvellous automaton.
And that was apparently the way in which Jorgenson preferred to
be treated. Lingard's real company on board the Emma was d'Alcacer.
D'Alcacer had met Lingard on the easy terms of a man accustomed
all his life to good society in which the very affectations must
be carried on without effort. Whether affectation, or nature,
or inspired discretion, d'Alcacer never let the slightest curiosity
pierce the smoothness of his level, grave courtesy lightened frequently
by slight smiles which often had not much connection with the
words he uttered, except that somehow they made them sound kindly
and as it were tactful. In their character, however, those words
were strictly neutral.</p>

<p>The only time when Lingard had detected something of a deeper
comprehension in d'Alcacer was the day after the long negotiations
inside Belarab's stockade for the temporary surrender of the prisoners.
That move had been suggested to him, exactly as Mrs. Travers had
told her husband, by the rivalries of the parties and the state
of public opinion in the Settlement deprived of the presence of
the man who, theoretically at least, was the greatest power and
the visible ruler of the Shore of Refuge. Belarab still lingered
at his father's tomb. Whether that man of the embittered and pacific
heart had withdrawn there to meditate upon the unruliness of mankind
and the thankless nature of his task; or whether he had gone there
simply to bathe in a particularly clear pool which was a feature
of the place, give himself up to the enjoyment of a certain fruit
which grew in profusion there and indulge for a time in a scrupulous
performance of religious exercises, his absence from the Settlement
was a fact of the utmost gravity. It is true that the prestige
of a long-unquestioned rulership and the long-settled mental habits
of the people had caused the captives to be taken straight to
Belarab's stockade as a matter of course. Belarab, at a distance,
could still outweigh the power on the spot of Tengga, whose secret
purposes were no better known, who was jovial, talkative, outspoken
and pugnacious; but who was not a professed servant of God famed
for many charities and a scrupulous performance of pious practices,
and who also had no father who had achieved a local saintship.
But Belarab, with his glamour of asceticism and melancholy together
with a reputation for severity (for a man so pious would be naturally
ruthless), was not on the spot. The only favourable point in his
absence was the fact that he had taken with him his latest wife,
the same lady whom Jorgenson had mentioned in his letter to Lingard
as anxious to bring about battle, murder, and the looting of the
yacht, not because of inborn wickedness of heart but from a simple
desire for silks, jewels and other objects of personal adornment,
quite natural in a girl so young and elevated to such a high position.
Belarab had selected her to be the companion of his retirement
and Lingard was glad of it. He was not afraid of her influence
over Belarab. He knew his man. No words, no blandishments, no
sulks, scoldings, or whisperings of a favourite could affect either
the resolves or the irresolutions of that Arab whose action ever
seemed to hang in mystic suspense between the contradictory speculations
and judgments disputing the possession of his will. It was not
what Belarab would either suddenly do or leisurely determine upon
that Lingard was afraid of. The danger was that in his taciturn
hesitation, which had something hopelessly godlike in its remote
calmness, the man would do nothing and leave his white friend
face to face with unruly impulses against which Lingard had no
means of action but force which he dared not use since it would
mean the destruction of his plans and the downfall of his hopes;
and worse still would wear an aspect of treachery to Hassim and
Immada, those fugitives whom he had snatched away from the jaws
of death on a night of storm and had promised to lead back in
triumph to their own country he had seen but once, sleeping unmoved
under the wrath and fire of heaven.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the very day he had arrived with her on board
the Emma&mdash;to the infinite disgust of Jorgenson &mdash;Lingard
held with Mrs. Travers (after she had had a couple of hours' rest)
a long, fiery, and perplexed conversation. From the nature of
the problem it could not be exhaustive; but toward the end of
it they were both feeling thoroughly exhausted. Mrs. Travers had
no longer to be instructed as to facts and possibilities. She
was aware of them only too well and it was not her part to advise
or argue. She was not called upon to decide or to plead. The situation
was far beyond that. But she was worn out with watching the passionate
conflict within the man who was both so desperately reckless and
so rigidly restrained in the very ardour of his heart and the
greatness of his soul. It was a spectacle that made her forget
the actual questions at issue. This was no stage play; and yet
she had caught herself looking at him with bated breath as at
a great actor on a darkened stage in some simple and tremendous
drama. He extorted from her a response to the forces that seemed
to tear at his single-minded brain, at his guileless breast. He
shook her with his own struggles, he possessed her with his emotions
and imposed his personality as if its tragedy were the only thing
worth considering in this matter. And yet what had she to do with
all those obscure and barbarous things? Obviously nothing. Unluckily
she had been taken into the confidence of that man's passionate
perplexity, a confidence provoked apparently by nothing but the
power of her personality. She was flattered, and even more, she
was touched by it; she was aware of something that resembled gratitude
and provoked a sort of emotional return as between equals who
had secretly recognized each other's value. Yet at the same time
she regretted not having been left in the dark; as much in the
dark as Mr. Travers himself or d'Alcacer, though as to the latter
it was impossible to say how much precise, unaccountable, intuitive
knowledge was buried under his unruffled manner.</p>

<p>D'Alcacer was the sort of man whom it would be much easier to
suspect of anything in the world than ignorance&mdash;or stupidity.
Naturally he couldn't know anything definite or even guess at
the bare outline of the facts but somehow he must have scented
the situation in those few days of contact with Lingard. He was
an acute and sympathetic observer in all his secret aloofness
from the life of men which was so very different from Jorgenson's
secret divorce from the passions of this earth. Mrs. Travers would
have liked to share with d'Alcacer the burden (for it was a burden)
of Lingard's story. After all, she had not provoked those confidences,
neither had that unexpected adventurer from the sea laid on her
an obligation of secrecy. No, not even by implication. He had
never said to her that she was the <em>only</em> person whom he
wished to know that story.</p>

<p>No. What he had said was that she was the only person to whom
he <em>could</em> tell the tale himself, as if no one else on
earth had the power to draw it from him. That was the sense and
nothing more. Yes, it would have been a relief to tell d'Alcacer.
It would have been a relief to her feeling of being shut off from
the world alone with Lingard as if within the four walls of a
romantic palace and in an exotic atmosphere. Yes, that relief
and also another: that of sharing the responsibility with somebody
fit to understand. Yet she shrank from it, with unaccountable
reserve, as if by talking of Lingard with d'Alcacer she was bound
to give him an insight into herself. It was a vague uneasiness
and yet so persistent that she felt it, too, when she had to approach
and talk to Lingard under d'Alcacer's eyes. Not that Mr. d'Alcacer
would ever dream of staring or even casting glances. But was he
averting his eyes on purpose? That would be even more offensive.</p>

<p>"I am stupid," whispered Mrs. Travers to herself, with a complete
and reassuring conviction. Yet she waited motionless till the
footsteps of the two men stopped outside the deckhouse, then separated
and died away, before she went out on deck. She came out on deck
some time after her husband. As if in intended contrast to the
conflicts of men a great aspect of serenity lay upon all visible
things. Mr. Travers had gone inside the Cage in which he really
looked like a captive and thoroughly out of place. D'Alcacer had
gone in there, too, but he preserved&mdash;or was it an illusion?&mdash;an
air of independence. It was not that he put it on. Like Mr. Travers
he sat in a wicker armchair in very much the same attitude as
the other gentleman and also silent; but there was somewhere a
subtle difference which did away with the notion of captivity.
Moreover, d'Alcacer had that peculiar gift of never looking out
of place in any surroundings. Mrs. Travers, in order to save her
European boots for active service, had been persuaded to use a
pair of leather sandals also extracted from that seaman's chest
in the deckhouse. An additional fastening had been put on them
but she could not avoid making a delicate clatter as she walked
on the deck. No part of her costume made her feel so exotic. It
also forced her to alter her usual gait and move with quick, short
steps very much like Immada.</p>

<p>"I am robbing the girl of her clothes," she had thought to herself,
"besides other things." She knew by this time that a girl of such
high rank would never dream of wearing anything that had been
worn by somebody else.</p>

<p>At the slight noise of Mrs. Travers' sandals d'Alcacer looked
over the back of his chair. But he turned his head away at once
and Mrs. Travers, leaning her elbow on the rail and resting her
head on the palm of her hand, looked across the calm surface of
the lagoon, idly.</p>

<p>She was turning her back on the Cage, the fore-part of the deck
and the edge of the nearest forest. That great erection of enormous
solid trunks, dark, rugged columns festooned with writhing creepers
and steeped in gloom, was so close to the bank that by looking
over the side of the ship she could see inverted in the glassy
belt of water its massive and black reflection on the reflected
sky that gave the impression of a clear blue abyss seen through
a transparent film. And when she raised her eyes the same abysmal
immobility seemed to reign over the whole sun-bathed enlargement
of that lagoon which was one of the secret places of the earth.
She felt strongly her isolation. She was so much the only being
of her kind moving within this mystery that even to herself she
looked like an apparition without rights and without defence and
that must end by surrendering to those forces which seemed to
her but the expression of the unconscious genius of the place.
Hers was the most complete loneliness, charged with a catastrophic
tension. It lay about her as though she had been set apart within
a magic circle. It cut off&mdash;but it did not protect. The footsteps
that she knew how to distinguish above all others on that deck
were heard suddenly behind her. She did not turn her head.</p>

<p>Since that afternoon when the gentlemen, as Lingard called them,
had been brought on board, Mrs. Travers and Lingard had not exchanged
one significant word.</p>

<p>When Lingard had decided to proceed by way of negotiation she
had asked him on what he based his hope of success; and he had
answered her: "On my luck." What he really depended on was his
prestige; but even if he had been aware of such a word he would
not have used it, since it would have sounded like a boast. And,
besides, he did really believe in his luck. Nobody, either white
or brown, had ever doubted his word and that, of course, gave
him great assurance in entering upon the negotiation. But the
ultimate issue of it would be always a matter of luck. He said
so distinctly to Mrs. Travers at the moment of taking leave of
her, with Jorgenson already waiting for him in the boat that was
to take them across the lagoon to Belarab's stockade.</p>

<p>Startled by his decision (for it had come suddenly clinched by
the words "I believe I can do it"), Mrs. Travers had dropped her
hand into his strong open palm on which an expert in palmistry
could have distinguished other lines than the line of luck. Lingard's
hand closed on hers with a gentle pressure. She looked at him,
speechless. He waited for a moment, then in an unconsciously tender
voice he said: "Well, wish me luck then."</p>

<p>She remained silent. And he still holding her hand looked surprised
at her hesitation. It seemed to her that she could not let him
go, and she didn't know what to say till it occurred to her to
make use of the power she knew she had over him. She would try
it again. "I am coming with you," she declared with decision.
"You don't suppose I could remain here in suspense for hours,
perhaps."</p>

<p>He dropped her hand suddenly as if it had burnt him&mdash;"Oh, yes,
of course," he mumbled with an air of confusion. One of the men
over there was her husband! And nothing less could be expected
from such a woman. He had really nothing to say but she thought
he hesitated.&mdash;"Do you think my presence would spoil everything?
I assure you I am a lucky person, too, in a way. . . . As lucky
as you, at least," she had added in a murmur and with a smile
which provoked his responsive mutter&mdash;"Oh, yes, we are a lucky
pair of people."&mdash;"I count myself lucky in having found a man
like you to fight my&mdash;our battles," she said, warmly. "Suppose
you had not existed? . . . . You must let me come with you!" 
For the second time before her expressed wish to stand by his
side he bowed his head. After all, if things came to the worst,
she would be as safe between him and Jorgenson as left alone on
board the Emma with a few Malay spearmen for all defence. For
a moment Lingard thought of picking up the pistols he had taken
out of his belt preparatory to joining Jorgenson in the boat,
thinking it would be better to go to a big talk completely unarmed.
They were lying on the rail but he didn't pick them up. Four shots
didn't matter. They could not matter if the world of his creation
were to go to pieces. He said nothing of that to Mrs. Travers
but busied himself in giving her the means to alter her personal
appearance. It was then that the sea-chest in the deckhouse was
opened for the first time before the interested Mrs. Travers who
had followed him inside. Lingard handed to her a Malay woman's
light cotton coat with jewelled clasps to put over her European
dress. It covered half of her yachting skirt. Mrs. Travers obeyed
him without comment. He pulled out a long and wide scarf of white
silk embroidered heavily on the edges and ends, and begged her
to put it over her head and arrange the ends so as to muffle her
face, leaving little more than her eyes exposed to view.&mdash;"We
are going amongst a lot of Mohammedans," he explained.&mdash;"I see.
You want me to look respectable," she jested.&mdash;"I assure you,
Mrs. Travers," he protested, earnestly, "that most of the people
there and certainly all the great men have never seen a white
woman in their lives. But perhaps you would like better one of
those other scarves? There are three in there."&mdash;"No, I like this
one well enough. They are all very gorgeous. I see that the Princess
is to be sent back to her land with all possible splendour. What
a thoughtful man you are, Captain Lingard. That child will be
touched by your generosity. . . . Will I do like this?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lingard, averting his eyes. Mrs. Travers followed
him into the boat where the Malays stared in silence while Jorgenson,
stiff and angular, gave no sign of life, not even so much as a
movement of the eyes. Lingard settled her in the stern sheets
and sat down by her side. The ardent sunshine devoured all colours.
The boat swam forward on the glare heading for the strip of coral
beach dazzling like a crescent of metal raised to a white heat.
They landed. Gravely, Jorgenson opened above Mrs. Travers' head
a big white cotton parasol and she advanced between the two men,
dazed, as if in a dream and having no other contact with the earth
but through the soles of her feet. Everything was still, empty,
incandescent, and fantastic. Then when the gate of the stockade
was thrown open she perceived an expectant and still multitude
of bronze figures draped in coloured stuffs. They crowded the
patches of shade under the three lofty forest trees left within
the enclosure between the sun-smitten empty spaces of hard-baked
ground. The broad blades of the spears decorated with crimson
tufts of horsehair had a cool gleam under the outspread boughs.
To the left a group of buildings on piles with long verandahs
and immense roofs towered high in the air above the heads of the
crowd, and seemed to float in the glare, looking much less substantial
than their heavy shadows. Lingard, pointing to one of the smallest,
said in an undertone, "I lived there for a fortnight when I first
came to see Belarab"; and Mrs. Travers felt more than ever as
if walking in a dream when she perceived beyond the rails of its
verandah and visible from head to foot two figures in an armour
of chain mail with pointed steel helmets crested with white and
black feathers and guarding the closed door. A high bench draped
in turkey cloth stood in an open space of the great audience shed.
Lingard led her up to it, Jorgenson on her other side closed the
parasol calmly, and when she sat down between them the whole throng
before her eyes sank to the ground with one accord disclosing
in the distance of the courtyard a lonely figure leaning against
the smooth trunk of a tree. A white cloth was fastened round his
head by a yellow cord. Its pointed ends fell on his shoulders,
framing a thin dark face with large eyes, a silk cloak striped
black and white fell to his feet, and in the distance he looked
aloof and mysterious in his erect and careless attitude suggesting
assurance and power.</p>

<p>Lingard, bending slightly, whispered into Mrs. Travers' ear that
that man, apart and dominating the scene, was Daman, the supreme
leader of the Illanuns, the one who had ordered the capture of
those gentlemen in order perhaps to force his hand. The two barbarous,
half-naked figures covered with ornaments and charms, squatting
at his feet with their heads enfolded in crimson and gold handkerchiefs
and with straight swords lying across their knees, were the Pangerans
who carried out the order, and had brought the captives into the
lagoon. But the two men in chain armour on watch outside the door
of the small house were Belarab's two particular body-guards,
who got themselves up in that way only on very great occasions.
They were the outward and visible sign that the prisoners were
in Belarab's keeping, and this was good, so far. The pity was
that the Great Chief himself was not there. Then Lingard assumed
a formal pose and Mrs. Travers stared into the great courtyard
and with rows and rows of faces ranged on the ground at her feet
felt a little giddy for a moment.</p>

<p>Every movement had died in the crowd. Even the eyes were still
under the variegated mass of coloured headkerchiefs: while beyond
the open gate a noble palm tree looked intensely black against
the glitter of the lagoon and the pale incandescence of the sky.
Mrs. Travers gazing that way wondered at the absence of Hassim
and Immada. But the girl might have been somewhere within one
of the houses with the ladies of Belarab's stockade. Then suddenly
Mrs. Travers became aware that another bench had been brought
out and was already occupied by five men dressed in gorgeous silks,
and embroidered velvets, round-faced and grave. Their hands reposed
on their knees; but one amongst them clad in a white robe and
with a large nearly black turban on his head leaned forward a
little with his chin in his hand. His cheeks were sunken and his
eyes remained fixed on the ground as if to avoid looking at the
infidel woman.</p>

<p>She became aware suddenly of a soft murmur, and glancing at Lingard
she saw him in an attitude of impassive attention. The momentous
negotiations had begun, and it went on like this in low undertones
with long pauses and in the immobility of all the attendants squatting
on the ground, with the distant figure of Daman far off in the
shade towering over all the assembly. But in him, too, Mrs. Travers
could not detect the slightest movement while the slightly modulated
murmurs went on enveloping her in a feeling of peace.</p>

<p>The fact that she couldn't understand anything of what was said
soothed her apprehensions. Sometimes a silence fell and Lingard
bending toward her would whisper, "It isn't so easy," and the
stillness would be so perfect that she would hear the flutter
of a pigeon's wing somewhere high up in the great overshadowing
trees. And suddenly one of the men before her without moving a
limb would begin another speech rendered more mysterious still
by the total absence of action or play of feature. Only the watchfulness
of the eyes which showed that the speaker was not communing with
himself made it clear that this was not a spoken meditation but
a flow of argument directed to Lingard who now and then uttered
a few words either with a grave or a smiling expression. They
were always followed by murmurs which seemed mostly to her to
convey assent; and then a reflective silence would reign again
and the immobility of the crowd would appear more perfect than
before.</p>

<p>When Lingard whispered to her that it was now his turn to make
a speech Mrs. Travers expected him to get up and assert himself
by some commanding gesture. But he did not. He remained seated,
only his voice had a vibrating quality though he obviously tried
to restrain it, and it travelled masterfully far into the silence.
He spoke for a long time while the sun climbing the unstained
sky shifted the diminished shadows of the trees, pouring on the
heads of men its heat through the thick and motionless foliage.
Whenever murmurs arose he would stop and glancing fearlessly at
the assembly, wait till they subsided. Once or twice, they rose
to a loud hum and Mrs. Travers could hear on the other side of
her Jorgenson muttering something in his moustache. Beyond the
rows of heads Daman under the tree had folded his arms on his
breast. The edge of the white cloth concealed his forehead and
at his feet the two Illanun chiefs, half naked and bedecked with
charms and ornaments of bright feathers, of shells, with necklaces
of teeth, claws, and shining beads, remained cross-legged with
their swords across their knees like two bronze idols. Even the
plumes of their head-dresses stirred not.</p>

<p>"Sudah! It is finished!" A movement passed along all the heads,
the seated bodies swayed to and fro. Lingard had ceased speaking.
He remained seated for a moment looking his audience all over
and when he stood up together with Mrs. Travers and Jorgenson
the whole assembly rose from the ground together and lost its
ordered formation. Some of Belarab's retainers, young broad-faced
fellows, wearing a sort of uniform of check-patterned sarongs,
black silk jackets and crimson skull-caps set at a rakish angle,
swaggered through the broken groups and ranged themselves in two
rows before the motionless Daman and his Illanun chiefs in martial
array. The members of the council who had left their bench approached
the white people with gentle smiles and deferential movements
of the hands. Their bearing was faintly propitiatory; only the
man in the big turban remained fanatically aloof, keeping his
eyes fixed on the ground.</p>

<p>"I have done it," murmured Lingard to Mrs. Travers.&mdash;"Was it
very difficult?" she asked.&mdash;"No," he said, conscious in his heart
that he had strained to the fullest extent the prestige of his
good name and that habit of deference to his slightest wish established
by the glamour of his wealth and the fear of his personality in
this great talk which after all had done nothing except put off
the decisive hour. He offered Mrs. Travers his arm ready to lead
her away, but at the last moment did not move.</p>

<p>With an authoritative gesture Daman had parted the ranks of Belarab's
young followers with the red skullcaps and was seen advancing
toward the whites striking into an astonished silence all the
scattered groups in the courtyard. But the broken ranks had closed
behind him. The Illanun chiefs, for all their truculent aspect,
were much too prudent to attempt to move. They had not needed
for that the faint warning murmur from Daman. He advanced alone.
The plain hilt of a sword protruded from the open edges of his
cloak. The parted edges disclosed also the butts of two flintlock
pistols. The Koran in a velvet case hung on his breast by a red
cord of silk. He was pious, magnificent, and warlike, with calm
movements and a straight glance from under the hem of the simple
piece of linen covering his head. He carried himself rigidly and
his bearing had a sort of solemn modesty. Lingard said hurriedly
to Mrs. Travers that the man had met white people before and that,
should he attempt to shake hands with her, she ought to offer
her own covered with the end of her scarf.&mdash;"Why?" she asked.
"Propriety?"&mdash;"Yes, it will be better,"  said Lingard and the
next moment Mrs. Travers felt her enveloped hand pressed gently
by slender dark fingers and felt extremely Oriental herself when,
with her face muffled to the eyes, she encountered the lustrous
black stare of the sea-robbers' leader. It was only for an instant,
because Daman turned away at once to shake hands with Lingard.
In the straight, ample folds of his robes he looked very slender
facing the robust white man.</p>

<p>"Great is your power," he said, in a pleasant voice. "The white
men are going to be delivered to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, they pass into my keeping," said Lingard, returning the
other's bright smile but otherwise looking grim enough with the
frown which had settled on his forehead at Daman's approach. He
glanced over his shoulder at a group of spearmen escorting the
two captives who had come down the steps from the hut. At the
sight of Daman barring as it were Lingard's way they had stopped
at some distance and had closed round the two white men. Daman
also glanced dispassionately that way.</p>

<p>"They were my guests," he murmured. "Please God I shall come
soon to ask you for them . . . as a friend," he added after a
slight pause.</p>

<p>"And please God you will not go away empty handed," said Lingard,
smoothing his brow. "After all you and I were not meant to meet
only to quarrel. Would you have preferred to see them pass into
Tengga's keeping?"</p>

<p>"Tengga is fat and full of wiles," said Daman, disdainfully,
"a mere shopkeeper smitten by a desire to be a chief. He is nothing.
But you and I are men that have real power. Yet there is a truth
that you and I can confess to each other. Men's hearts grow quickly
discontented. Listen. The leaders of men are carried forward in
the hands of their followers; and common men's minds are unsteady,
their desires changeable, and their thoughts not to be trusted.
You are a great chief they say. Do not forget that I am a chief,
too, and a leader of armed men."</p>

<p>"I have heard of you, too," said Lingard in a composed voice.</p>

<p>Daman had cast his eyes down. Suddenly he opened them very wide
with an effect that startled Mrs. Travers.&mdash;"Yes. But do you see?"
Mrs. Travers, her hand resting lightly on Lingard's arm, had the
sensation of acting in a gorgeously got up play on the brilliantly
lighted stage of an exotic opera whose accompaniment was not music
but the varied strains of the all-pervading silence.&mdash;"Yes, I
see," Lingard replied with a surprisingly confidential intonation.
"But power, too, is in the hands of a great leader."</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers watched the faint movements of Daman's nostrils
as though the man were suffering from some powerful emotion, while
under her fingers Lingard's forearm in its white sleeve was as
steady as a limb of marble. Without looking at him she seemed
to feel that with one movement he could crush that nervous figure
in which lived the breath of the great desert haunted by his nomad,
camel-riding ancestors.&mdash;"Power is in the hand of God," he said,
all animation dying out of his face, and paused to wait for Lingard's
"Very true," then continued with a fine smile, "but He apportions
it according to His will for His own purposes, even to those that
are not of the Faith."</p>

<p>"Such being the will of God you should harbour no bitterness
against them in your heart."</p>

<p>The low exclamation, "Against those!" and a slight dismissing
gesture of a meagre dark hand out of the folds of the cloak were
almost understandable to Mrs. Travers in the perfection of their
melancholy contempt, and gave Lingard a further insight into the
character of the ally secured to him by the diplomacy of Belarab.
He was only half reassured by this assumption of superior detachment.
He trusted to the man's self-interest more; for Daman no doubt
looked to the reconquered kingdom for the reward of dignity and
ease. His father and grandfather (the men of whom Jorgenson had
written as having been hanged for an example twelve years before)
had been friends of Sultans, advisers of Rulers, wealthy financiers
of the great raiding expeditions of the past. It was hatred that
had turned Daman into a self-made outcast, till Belarab's diplomacy
had drawn him out from some obscure and uneasy retreat.</p>

<p>In a few words Lingard assured Daman of the complete safety of
his followers as long as they themselves made no attempt to get
possession of the stranded yacht. Lingard understood very well
that the capture of Travers and d'Alcacer was the result of a
sudden fear, a move directed by Daman to secure his own safety.
The sight of the stranded yacht shook his confidence completely.
It was as if the secrets of the place had been betrayed. After
all, it was perhaps a great folly to trust any white man, no matter
how much he seemed estranged from his own people. Daman felt he
might have been the victim of a plot. Lingard's brig appeared
to him a formidable engine of war. He did not know what to think
and the motive for getting hold of the two white men was really
the wish to secure hostages. Distrusting the fierce impulses of
his followers he had hastened to put them into Belarab's keeping.
But everything in the Settlement seemed to him suspicious: Belarab's
absence, Jorgenson's refusal to make over at once the promised
supply of arms and ammunition. And now that white man had by the
power of his speech got them away from Belarab's people. So much
influence filled Daman with wonder and awe. A recluse for many
years in the most obscure corner of the Archipelago he felt himself
surrounded by intrigues. But the alliance was a great thing, too.
He did not want to quarrel. He was quite willing for the time
being to accept Lingard's assurance that no harm should befall
his people encamped on the sandbanks. Attentive and slight, he
seemed to let Lingard's deliberate words sink into him. The force
of that unarmed big man seemed overwhelming. He bowed his head
slowly.</p>

<p>"Allah is our refuge," he murmured, accepting the inevitable.</p>

<p>He delighted Mrs. Travers not as a living being but like a clever
sketch in colours, a vivid rendering of an artist's vision of
some soul, delicate and fierce. His bright half-smile was extraordinary,
sharp like clear steel, painfully penetrating. Glancing right
and left Mrs. Travers saw the whole courtyard smitten by the desolating
fury of sunshine and peopled with shadows, their forms and colours
fading in the violence of the light. The very brown tones of roof
and wall dazzled the eye. Then Daman stepped aside. He was no
longer smiling and Mrs. Travers advanced with her hand on Lingard's
arm through a heat so potent that it seemed to have a taste, a
feel, a smell of its own. She moved on as if floating in it with
Lingard's support.</p>

<p>"Where are they?" she asked.</p>

<p>"They are following us all right," he answered. Lingard was so
certain that the prisoners would be delivered to him on the beach
that he never glanced back till, after reaching the boat, he and
Mrs. Travers turned about.</p>

<p>The group of spearmen parted right and left, and Mr. Travers
and d'Alcacer walked forward alone looking unreal and odd like
their own day-ghosts. Mr. Travers gave no sign of being aware
of his wife's presence. It was certainly a shock to him. But d'Alcacer
advanced smiling, as if the beach were a drawing room.</p>

<p>With a very few paddlers the heavy old European-built boat moved
slowly over the water that seemed as pale and blazing as the sky
above. Jorgenson had perched himself in the bow. The other four
white people sat in the stern sheets, the ex-prisoners side by
side in the middle. Lingard spoke suddenly.</p>

<p>"I want you both to understand that the trouble is not over yet.
Nothing is finished. You are out on my bare word."</p>

<p>While Lingard was speaking Mr. Travers turned his face away but
d'Alcacer listened courteously. Not another word was spoken for
the rest of the way. The two gentlemen went up the ship's side
first. Lingard remained to help Mrs. Travers at the foot of the
ladder. She pressed his hand strongly and looking down at his
upturned face:</p>

<p>"This was a wonderful success," she said.</p>

<p>For a time the character of his fascinated gaze did not change.
It was as if she had said nothing. Then he whispered, admiringly,
"You understand everything."</p>

<p>She moved her eyes away and had to disengage her hand to which
he clung for a moment, giddy, like a man falling out of the world.</p>
