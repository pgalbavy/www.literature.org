<p>The scene at this moment was terrifying.</p>

<p>The river was swarming with fleeing soldiers, old men, women,
and children, struggling to reach the other side and get away
from the merciless hordes assailing them.</p>

<p>Where so many were taking to the river, it would seem that there
was little hope for the three, who were moving along the bank
toward some point that would take them out of the rush.</p>

<p>For a time they attracted no special notice, but it was impossible
that this should continue.</p>

<p>"Oh, the scand'lous villains!" muttered Aunt Peggy, applying
her favorite epithet to the Tories; "how I would like to wring
their necks! I've no doubt that Jake Golcher is among them. The
idea of his coming to our house to court you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there," interrupted Maggie, "this is no time to speak
of such things; Jacob Golcher is among them, for I saw him a few
minutes ago, and we may need his friendship."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's Gravity!" broke in Eva, clapping her hands. The other
two, turning their heads, saw that she spoke the truth.</p>

<p>The bulky negro servant of the family came limping toward them
with his smoking musket in hand. He was bare-headed, like Maggie
and Eva, and his garments were badly torn. He was panting from
his severe exertion, and the perspiration streamed down his dusty
face.</p>

<p>"Where's father?" was the first question Maggie asked, as he
drew near.</p>

<p>"Can't tell," was the reply; "when I last seed him, he was fightin'
like all creation, and graderlly workin' off toward the woods."</p>

<p>"Then there is hope for him!" exclaimed Maggie, looking yearningly
at the servant, as if asking for another word of encouragement.</p>

<p>"Hope for him? Course dere am, and so dere am for you if you
hurry out ob dis place."</p>

<p>"But where can we go, Gravity? I promised father to try to get
away, but how can we do so?"</p>

<p>"I'll soon show you," replied the African, rapidly recovering
his wind, and moving along the bank in the direction of the present
site of Kingston.</p>

<p>Gravity knew there was no chance for his friends until they reached
the other side of the river, but it would not do to enter the
stream near where they then stood.</p>

<p>A portion of the Susquehanna was so deep that it would be necessary
for all to swim, and, strange as it may seem, the only one of
the party who could do so was Maggie Brainerd herself. Though
Gravity had lived for years along the river, he could not swim
a stroke.</p>

<p>It was a wonder that the little party had not already attracted
the notice of the horde swarming along the shores. They must do
so very soon and Gravity hurried his gait.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for dat scow ob mine," he explained; "if any ob
you happen to cotch sight ob it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Eva Brainerd gave utterance to such a shriek that every one stopped
and looked toward her.</p>

<p>Without speaking, she pointed up the bank where a hideously painted
Iroquois was in the act of drawing back his gleaming tomahawk
and hurling it at Gravity Gimp, who until that moment was unconscious
of his peril.</p>

<p>The negro held his loaded gun in hand, but the time was too brief
for him to turn it to account. In fact, at the very moment he
looked at the redskin, the latter let fly.</p>

<p>With remarkable quickness, Gravity, knowing that the Indian was
aiming at his head, dropped his shoulders just as the weapon whizzed
past, and striking the ground, went bounding end over end for
a dozen yards.</p>

<p>The Iroquois was amazed by his own failure. He stared for a single
moment, and then, seeing that the dusky fellow was unhurt, he
brought his gun to his shoulder, with the intention of destroying
the only protector the women and children had, so as to leave
them defenseless.</p>

<p>But in the way of raising his gun to his shoulder, taking aim
and firing, Gravity Gimp was five seconds in advance of the noble
red man: enough said.</p>

<p>"De fust duty arter shootin' off a gun am to load her up agin,"
remarked Gravity, as he began pouring a charge from his powder
horn into the palm of his hand, preparatory to letting it run
down the barrel of his weapon.</p>

<p>"Don't wait," pleaded Maggie, greatly agitated by what had just
taken place, and by the shouts, cries, and reports of guns about
them; "if we tarry we are lost."</p>

<p>"I reckon I'm too well 'quainted wid dese parts to got lost,"
said the servant, who was really making all the haste he could
in the way of reloading his gun. In a moment he had poured the
powder into the pan of his weapon.</p>

<p>"Now we'll trabbel," he said, hurrying again along the river
shore. He took enormous strides, his gait being that peculiar
hurried walk which is really faster than an ordinary trot.</p>

<p>It compelled the others to run, Maggie still clasping the hand
of Eva, while Aunt Peggy forgot her dignity in the terrors of
the time and held her pace with them.</p>

<p>The truth was that though Gravity was the owner of a scow which
he had partly hidden at the time he saw the possibility of its
need, he was afraid it had been taken by others of the fugitives
that had stumbled upon it.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred yards remained to be passed, and, as that
was fast put behind them, even the phlegmatic Gravity began to
show some nervousness.</p>

<p>"I thinks we're gwine to make it," he said, recognizing several
well-known landmarks; "and, if we does, and gits to de oder shore
and has 'bout two hundred and fifty miles start ob de Tories and
Injins, why dat will be sort ob cheerin' like."</p>

<p>All this time the sable guide, although walking fast, limped
as if he were hurt.</p>

<p>"What makes you lame?" asked Eva.</p>

<p>"I was hit by a cannon-ball on de knee," was the astonishing
answer: "it slewed my leg round a little, but I'll soon be all
right again."</p>

<p>At this moment, when the hearts of all were beating high with
hope, a rustling was heard among the undergrowth on their right,
and the little company paused and looked up, expecting to see
a dozen or more painted Iroquois in their war paint.</p>

<p>The <em>click</em>, <em>click</em> of the African's rifle, as
he drew back the flint, showed that he was ready to do everything
to defend those who cowered behind him like scared sheep.</p>

<p>To the surprise of each, however, a single man came hurriedly
forth. All identified him as Jake Golcher, an old resident of
Wyoming, but one of the bitterest of Tories, whose hatred of his
former neighbors and friends seemed as intense as that of Queen
Esther, or Katharine Montour, one of the leaders of the invaders.</p>

<p>He was as much surprised as the fugitives themselves, and he
stared at them with open mouth, slouch hat thrown on the back
of his head, and the stock of his gun resting at his feet. He
was the first to recover his speech, and, with an expletive, he
demanded:</p>

<p>"Where did <em>you</em> come from?"</p>

<p>"Am you abdressing your remarks to me or to de ladies?" asked
Gravity of the man whom he detested, and of whom, even then, he
had not the slightest fear.</p>

<p>"I'm speaking to all of you," said Golcher, glancing furtively
at the vinegar face of Aunt Peggy, and bestowing a beaming smile
on Maggie Brainerd.</p>

<p>Much as the latter despised the Tory, she had too much sense
to show it at this time. Walking toward him, she clasped her hands,
and with an emotion that was certainly genuine, she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Golcher, won't you help us?"</p>

<p>"What are you axin' him dat for?" broke in Gravity; "we don't
want no help from <em>him</em>."</p>

<p>Aunt Peggy was evidently of the same mind, for though she said
nothing, she gave a sniff and toss of her head that were more
expressive than words.</p>

<p>The sallow face of the Tory flushed, as he looked down in the
sweet countenance of Maggie Brainerd, made tenfold more winsome
by the glow of the cheeks and the sparkle of the eyes, arising
from the excitement of her situation.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that the party had gone so far along the bank of
the river that they were somewhat removed from the swarm of fleeing
fugitives, and therefore no immediate danger threatened; but the
call for flight was as loud as ever, and a few minutes' delay
was liable to bring down a score of Indians and Tories.</p>

<p>To none was this fact more evident than to Maggie Brainerd. In
truth, she believed that Golcher was at the head of a company
within call, and she sought to win his good-will before it was
too late.</p>

<p>Gravity stood with his gun at his side, the hammer raised, and
ready to fire the instant it became necessary. One foot was thrown
forward, and his whole demeanor was that of enmity and defiance.</p>

<p>I may as well say that the servant was trying hard to persuade
himself that it was not his duty to raise his piece and shoot
the renegade without any further warning.</p>

<p>It would have been shocking, and yet there would have been some
palliation for it.</p>

<p>In a short time the African's debate with himself ended in what
may be called a compromise.</p>

<p>"I'll keep my eye on him while dis foolish conversation goes
on, and de minute he winks at Miss Maggie, or says anyting dat
she don't like, I'll pull trigger."</p>
