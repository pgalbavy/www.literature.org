<p>The hill which the boys proposed to pass around was about a quarter
of a mile in length and but slightly less in breadth&mdash;much greater
than either of them suspected when they set out. It rose like
a peak to the height of several hundred feet, as if it were an
offshoot from the main ridge of hills, left to flourish by itself.</p>

<p>Howard walked slowly along, after glancing back at his cousin
until the intervening wood concealed him from view, when he gave
a short, sharp whistle, which was immediately answered. Then,
appreciating the necessity of haste, he quickened his footsteps.</p>

<p>As he advanced the hills assumed proportions of which he had
not dreamed, and that raised in his mind strong doubts as to the
wisdom of separating from his companion. He would not have done
it had not the latter urged him so. Misgivings now arose in the
mind of the boy. He looked upon his duty as that of restraining
and tempering Elwood's impulsiveness. He had done so several times
to his manifest advantage; but on this day, as Howard looked back,
it really appeared as if he had bidden good-by to his senses.
Their separation from Tim was almost criminal in its foolishness,
and yet he had scarcely raised an objection; and now, was not
the last proceeding still more imprudent? As it stood, the three
members of the little party who should never have been out of
each other's sight, were now a good distance from each other,
and that, too, when in a hostile country.</p>

<p>From these rather sad reflections Howard was roused by the faint,
echoing whistle of Elwood.</p>

<p>"He is all right," thought he, feeling much relieved, as he placed
his fingers to his mouth and returned the whistle. "We are both
now passing around the hill, so that we cannot get further apart,
and can keep within call all the time."</p>

<p>Admonished by the lateness of the hour, Howard almost ran. He
grew somewhat impatient at the unexpected extent of the hill;
but finally he passed beyond the southern point, and as he stood
and listened, he heard the murmur of the river&mdash;proof that it
was close at hand.</p>

<p>"Now," thought he, "if Elwood will only hurry, we have a good
chance of finding Tim before he gives us up for lost."</p>

<p>The boy could not see that anything at all was gained by their
course in passing around the ridge. Neither of them, were in sight
of the river, and would have to advance still further before they
could form any idea of their whereabouts. He was resolved to do
this in company with his cousin, so that precisely the same thing
would have been accomplished had they remained together.</p>

<p>Howard having hurried a great deal, thought it likely that he
was some distance in advance of his cousin. He stood some minutes
listening for his signals, and then began walking toward the northern
end of the hill that he might meet him as he came around. He observed
as he advanced that they increased in rocky ruggedness, and could
see that it was quite a feat to pass through them.</p>

<p>Going some distance he paused again, and listened intently, but
nothing beside the deep murmur of the woods reached his ear.</p>

<p>"What can it mean?" he finally asked himself, as a vague alarm
crept over him. "We must be much closer together than we were
before, and I haven't heard him whistle for the last half-hour."</p>

<p>He began to doubt whether it was best to proceed further or not.
It might serve only to mislead in case Elwood was searching for
him. Still hearing nothing to indicate the location of his friend,
he made the signal himself&mdash;a long, screeching whistle, that rang
out in the solemn stillness with a penetrating clearness that
sent the chills over him from head to foot.</p>

<p>"He must hear that if he is within a mile," was his reflection,
as he leaned his head forward and listened for the first approach
of the answering sound.</p>

<p>Ten, fifteen, twenty minutes passed away, but nothing was heard,
and the poor boy looked around in sore alarm.</p>

<p>"Can it be that Elwood is jesting?" he asked himself. "He would
not do so if he knew what I am suffering."</p>

<p>Howard was now in great distress. He could not decide what to
do. If he advanced he could feel no assurance of meeting his friend,
while a retreat was equally hopeless.</p>

<p>Where was Elwood? Had he wandered off among the hills, tempted
by the wild scenery, and had he lost his way? Was he searching
for his cousin? Or had he been found by Indians?</p>

<p>The last inquiry had been rising in Howard's mind for a half-hour,
but he had resolutely forced it down again, until he could keep
it away no longer. He could find no other reason to account for
the silence, and failure to answer his call. The whistle which
he had given must have spread miles in every direction&mdash;so far
that Elwood could not have got beyond its range had the course
of both been precisely opposite. No; it must&#11834;</p>

<p>But, hark! A faint, tremulous whistle comes to his ear. It is
far away and sounds among the hills behind, as though it had labored
up from some cave or chasm miles distant. Howard held his breath,
and as he anticipated, it came again so faintly and distantly
that had he been walking he could not have heard it.</p>

<p>On both occasions it sounded behind him among the hills, though
its tremulous faintness made it appear as though it came from
far up in the air, or down deep in some of the gorges of the hills&mdash;so
uncertain was the exact point of its starting.</p>

<p>Poor Howard was now in a dilemma. Whether to attempt to follow
up the signal or to go on to the river and search out Tim O'Rooney
and the Newfoundland was a question which was difficult to decide.
But his eagerness to find his cousin led him on into the hills,
until he had penetrated quite a distance. He then paused and listened
for the signal, but none was ever to come to his ears again.</p>

<p>Howard repeated the whistle over and over, and finally fired
his gun; but both were equally fruitless. He waited where he was
until dark, when with a sad heart he withdrew and resumed his
tramp toward the river. Gloomy indeed were his meditations, as
he reflected on the occurrences of the day, and there was scarcely
anything he would not do, if by any means he could recall <em>his</em>
part since he landed upon the main shore.</p>

<p>In the course of half an hour he reached the river, and looked
intently out into the semi-darkness to see whether he could recognize
anything familiar; but so far as he was able to see, all was strange,
from which he concluded that he had struck at a point lower down
than where Tim had been left.</p>

<p>He therefore began making his way south, that is, toward the
source of the river, after halting and listening for some sound
that might tell something either of Tim or Elwood. Suddenly a
threatening growl startled him, and then came the welcome bark
of Terror, and the next moment the dog was frolicking around him
and showing his delight in the most extravagant manner.</p>
