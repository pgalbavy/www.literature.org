<p>The prayer of little Nellie Ribsam&mdash;so far as it related to herself&mdash;was
answered.</p>

<p>She secured her seat, as best she could, in the branches of the
chestnut sapling, and, by arranging her dress and the yielding
limbs with considerable skill, she made herself quite comfortable.</p>

<p>The trying situation in which she was placed, it would be thought,
was enough to drive away all disposition to sleep, but at the
end of less than half an hour the little head was nodding again,
and, forgetful of her peril, her senses soon left her.</p>

<p>It will be understood that the danger of the young wanderer was
rendered all the greater by this loss of consciousness, for her
muscles would relax in slumber, and, unless her position was unusually
secure, she was certain to fall.</p>

<p>But that gracious Father in whom she so implicitly trusted watched
over the little one, and she remained as though seated in the
broad rocking-chair at home.</p>

<p>When at last she moved slightly and was on the point of losing
her balance, she awoke so quickly that she saved herself just
in the nick of time.</p>

<p>She was shocked and startled, but regaining her breath she held
fast with one hand while she parted the branches with the other
and carefully peered down among the limbs.</p>

<p>"He is gone!" was her joyous exclamation; "I knew the Lord would
make him go away, because I asked him to."</p>

<p>She was right: the bear had vanished, and all danger from that
source for the time had passed.</p>

<p>The brute probably found enough to eat without waiting for little
girls to fall into his clutches. As he had never been known to
trouble any one in the neighborhood, it was reasonable to believe
that he got all he wanted without venturing away from the depths
of the woods, and rousing an ill-will against himself that would
speedily result in his destruction.</p>

<p>Nellie did not feel surprised at all, for, as I have shown, she
had the faith to believe that her prayer would be answered.</p>

<p>"Now I will go down to the ground and start for home. I guess
the bear isn't far off, but the Lord will not let him hurt me."</p>

<p>She carefully descended the tree and stood on the ground a minute
later. She found that her dress was torn and she had lost part
of the ribbon from her hat. This troubled her more than anything
else, for her frugal mother had told her many a time that she
must take the best care of her clothing.</p>

<p>"I was so scared that I forgot to look out," she said to herself,
after taking an inventory of the damages; "but I guess mother
will excuse me for losing the ribbon, though I know she won't
for coming so far into the woods without permission."</p>

<p>She now set out resolutely for the bridge, determined to lose
no more time in reaching home. As is the rule, the brief space
she had passed in sleep seemed three times as long as was actually
the case, and she thought it must be near morning.</p>

<p>She had gone but a short distance when she stopped with another
shock of affright.</p>

<p>"My gracious! what can that be?"</p>

<p>A point of light appeared between her and the bridge, flickering
about like an <em>ignis-fatuus</em> or jack-o'-lantern. Nellie
felt like taking to the tree again, but she bravely stood her
ground until she could satisfy her curiosity as to its nature.</p>

<p>Watching it closely she observed shadowy figures flitting around
the light in a curious and grotesque way. She was in greater doubt
than ever, when she heard voices.</p>

<p>"I think I saw her tracks, but I couldn't be sure; Nellie knows
too much to walk or fall into the deep water."</p>

<p>"I hope so, but my heart misgives me sorely. God be merciful,
for if she is lost I can never recover!"</p>

<p>The first speaker was Nick Ribsam, and the second was the father,
the mother immediately adding:</p>

<p>"Why the poor child came here is more than I can understand,
but He doeth all things well."</p>

<p><em>"Oh, mother! Oh, father! Oh, Nick! It is I, Nellie! I am
so glad to see you!"</em></p>

<p>And the little wanderer flew like the wind along the bank of
the creek. The mother was the first to recognize the voice, and
rushing forward she caught her child in her arms, murmuring in
her own language:</p>

<p>"Mein Kind! Mein Kind! Gott sei Dank!" (My child! My child! God
be thanked!)</p>

<p>"Mein lieber Nellie! Komm an mein Herz! Kannst du es sein?" (My
dear Nellie! Come to my heart! Can it be you?) exclaimed the overjoyed
father.</p>

<p>"O meine abtr√ºnnige Schwester! Wie du uns erschreckt hast! Wie
es mich freut dich zu finden!" (Oh, my truant sister! What a scare
you have given us! How glad I am to find you!) shouted Nick.</p>

<p>And the child that was lost and was found was hugged first by
mother, then by father, and then by Nick, and then all strove
to get hold of her at the same time, till the brother ceased,
through fear that she would be torn apart.</p>

<p>Nellie was laughing and crying, and wondering why it was such
commotion was caused by her return to her folks.</p>

<p>Mr. Layton and Kilgore heard the tumult, and knew what it meant.
A few minutes brought them to the spot, and, though their greeting
was less demonstrative, their eyes filled with tears over the
exceeding joy of the reunited family.</p>

<p>When the excitement had subsided somewhat, the group listened
to the story of Nellie. She told it in her childish, straightforward
manner, and it was all the more impressive on that account.</p>

<p>The listeners were greatly touched; but the probability that
a large bear was in the neighborhood hastened their footsteps
and they lost no time in hurrying away.</p>

<p>When they reached the highway above, crossed the bridge, and
had gone some distance on their way home, they began to feel there
was nothing to be feared from the animal. Mr. Layton referred
to the tracks of the beast which they had noticed when hunting
for Nellie, but said he would never have mentioned it until the
fate of the girl became known; for the suggestions which must
have followed were too dreadful.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen of the animal, however, and, as the distance
from the bridge was increased the party finally gave up all thought
and conversation respecting it.</p>

<p>There was a grateful household that night, when, at a late hour,
they gathered about the family altar and the head returned thanks
to Him who had been so merciful to them and theirs.</p>

<p>The happy mother held the daughter in her arms all night, while
they both slept; and when the parent awoke, now and then, through
the darkness, she shuddered, pressed the little one closer to
her and kissed the chubby cheek, on which her former tears had
not yet dried.</p>

<p>But Katrina Ribsam was none the less an affectionate mother when,
several days later, she called Nellie to her knee and told her
how wrongly she had acted in venturing on such a dangerous tramp
without asking permission from her parents.</p>

<p>Nellie said she knew it, and wondered why it was her mother delayed
the punishment so long. She was ready, and loved and respected
her mother the more for administering it.</p>

<p>But truth compels me to say that the chastisement was given with
such a gentle hand that it was hardly worth the name, and the
mother herself suffered far more than did the child, who to this
day is not conscious that she received anything like physical
pain.</p>
