<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Firm in his intention of bringing his subject to his death by
slow degrees, M. Eliphas de la Nox took Theophrastus slowly through
the imprisonment, trial, and condemnation of Cartouche. But I
omit that part of the narrative of M. Lecamus, since the historians
have described that imprisonment and trial at length. I take it
up at the point at which Cartouche was on his way to the Torture-chamber
that they might force from him the names of his accomplices.</p>

<p>"And now," says M. Lecamus in his narrative, "we were approaching
the crucial point of the operation: <em>to kill Cartouche without
killing Theophrastus</em>. Simple enough words, but the most difficult
operation in Psychic Surgery. Truly M. de la Nox had been right
when he said that he was about to tempt Providence. Truly, he
had assumed the most appalling responsibility, the risk of killing
Theophrastus without killing Cartouche, and consequently of letting
that fiend in human form again become reincarnate in some unfortunate
contemporary.</p>

<p>"But then it was M. Eliphas de Saint-Elme de Taillebourg de la
Nox who had assumed the responsibility, the greatest living expert
in Psychical Surgery, the delicacy of whose Astral Scalpel is
known to the initiates throughout the world, even to far Thibet.
He knew how to move the spirit, quietly and calmly, <em>round
its own death</em>, so preparing it for the last moment. <em>He
made his dead man live till the very moment at which he made his
dead man die!</em></p>

<p>"He had brought Theophrastus-Cartouche to the hour when his jailors
took him from his cell to lead him to the Torture-chamber. His
next question was:</p>

<p>"'And where are you now, Cartouche?'</p>

<p>"'I am going down a little staircase at the end of Straw Alley...
They are opening a grating... I am in the darkness of the cellars...
These cellars frighten me... I know them well... Ah, yes: I was
shut up in these cellars in the days of Philippe-le-Bel!'</p>

<p>"M. de la Nox raised his voice in a tone of awful command, and
said:</p>

<p>"'Cartouche! You <em>are</em> Cartouche! You are in those cellars
by order of the <em>Regent</em>!'</p>

<p>"Then he muttered, 'Philippe-le-Bel! Where in Heaven's name are
we going now? We must not stray. We must not! Where are you now,
Cartouche?'</p>

<p>"'I am going deeper into the night of the cellars, I am surrounded
by guards&mdash;many guards. It is too dark to see how many... Ah!
I see at the end there, right at the end, a ray which I know well.
<em>It is a square ray which the sun has forgotten there since
the beginning of the history of France!</em>... My guards are
not French Guards, they distrust all the French Guards. My guards
are commanded by the military lieutenant of the Châtelet.'</p>

<p>"There was a pause as M. de la Nox let Cartouche continue on
his painful way; then he said: 'And where are you now, Cartouche?'</p>

<p>"'I am in the Torture-chamber... About me are men dressed in
long robes... Their faces are masked... They are binding me to
the stool of Question... They are thick ropes... Well, they need
them thick for me... But if they think they're going to get anything
out of me, they're wrong&mdash;altogether wrong!'</p>

<p>"The face of Theophrastus was set in an expression of stubborn
pride, almost ferocious. Slowly it weakened in intensity as we
stood waiting and watching him; then suddenly it changed to an
expression of pain, and he uttered an ear-splitting yell.</p>

<p>"M. de la Nox and I started back; Marceline uttered a cry.</p>

<p>"Plainly M. de la Nox did not expect that yell, for he said in
a tone of surprise, 'Why did you yell like that, Cartouche?'</p>

<p>"'I yell because it's so awful <em>not to be able to denounce
my accomplices</em>! Their names are on the tip of my tongue;
but they won't come off it! Can't they see that if I don't denounce
them, it's because I can't move the tip of my tongue? Why didn't
Cartouche move the tip of his tongue? I can't; and it's most unfair!'</p>

<p>"M. de la Nox was silent for a while. There was no reason why
he should harrow our sensibilities with the pangs of that old-world
ruffian. It was bad enough to see the anguished face of Theophrastus.
After a while it grew serene again; and M. de la Nox said:</p>

<p>"'And what are you doing now, Cartouche?'</p>

<p>"'They are leaving me alone,' said Theophrastus. 'Only the doctor
and the surgeon are feeling my pulse... They are congratulating
themselves on having chosen the torture of the Boot, because it
is least dangerous to life, and the least liable to accidents.'</p>

<p>"I observed that he spoke in his ordinary voice, that it was
not weakened by the pain he had suffered. It seemed as if he only
felt it at the moment of its actual infliction, that he did not
feel the after pain.</p>

<p>"There came another long pause; then suddenly Theophrastus uttered
another ear-splitting yell.</p>

<p>"'What's the matter now, Cartouche?' said M. de la Nox anxiously.</p>

<p>"'It's the tip of my tongue!' cried Theophrastus furiously.'
Can't these silly fools see that the names are on the tip of my
tongue, and won't come off it? Why don't the idiots take them
off it? Is it my fault that Cartouche didn't split?'</p>

<p>"'But Cartouche was silent: why are you yelling?' said M. de
la Nox.</p>

<p>"'<em>They're torturing Cartouche; but it's Theophrastus Longuet
who yells!</em>'</p>

<p>"M. de la Nox seemed thunderstruck by this response. He turned
and said to us in a trembling voice: 'Then&mdash;then it's <em>he</em>
who suffers.'</p>

<p>"It was the truth; one could not doubt it to see the anguish
on the contorted face of Theophrastus. It was Cartouche who was
tortured and Theophrastus who suffered. That proved the <em>identity</em>
of the soul; <em>but it also proved that the pain had not ceased
to be effective after two hundred years</em>. That was what dismayed
M. de la Nox. It was the first time that a case of this kind had
come under his observation during his operations with the Astral
Scalpel. The pain of Cartouche found voice through two centuries;
this cry of anguish which had not issued from his stubborn lips,
<em>had waited two hundred years to burst from the lungs of Theophrastus
Longuet</em>!</p>

<p>"M. Eliphas de la Nox buried his head, his luminous head, in
his hands and prayed ardently: 'In the beginning you were the
Silence! Æon eternal! Source of Æons!...'</p>

<p>"At the end of the prayer he felt Theophrastus' pulse and listened
carefully to the beating of his heart. Then he said:</p>

<p>"'M. Longuet is plainly a man of strong constitution, and thoroughly
sound. In fact, from that point of view there's scarcely anything
to fear. <em>He will bury Cartouche.</em> I think we ought to
go through with the operation.'</p>

<p>"I said that I was of his opinion. Marceline hesitated a little,
and then bade him continue.</p>

<p>"'And now what are they doing, Cartouche?' said M. de la Nox.</p>

<p>"'They keep asking me those useless questions; but I can't answer,'
said Theophrastus impatiently. 'And I keep asking myself what
that man in the right-hand corner of the cell is doing. He has
his back turned to me; and I can hear a <em>sound of clinking
iron</em>... The executioner is at the moment taking it easily.
He's leaning against the wall and yawning... There's a lamp on
the table which lights up two men who keep on writing and writing.
What they're writing I can't conceive, for I haven't said anything
&mdash;I can't. It's the man in the corner that puzzles me. There's
a red light on the wall as if he were between me and a brazier.
I wonder what those irons are he's messing about with.'</p>

<p>"'It must be the red-hot irons. They used them,' said M. de la
Nox; and he shivered.</p>

<p>"We were silent; and presently there came a series of dreadful,
ear-splitting yells from Theophrastus. M. de la Nox turned a very
pale and troubled face to us, and declared that he had never come
across, or even suspected that one could come across, pain so
<em>effective</em>. He had no doubt that it must be owing to the
fact that he had never before operated on souls reincarnate after
an interval of less than five hundred years; that even those were
very rare; and the bulk of his clientele was composed of souls
at least two thousand years old. I fancied that he was somewhat
out of his depth; and it surprised me beyond words.</p>

<p>"Again Theophrastus yelled; then suddenly Marceline cried:</p>

<p>"'Look! Look, his hair!'</p>

<p>"The most surprising sight met our eyes: <em>the hair of Theophrastus
was turning white</em>!</p>

<p>"The whiteness spread over it as smoothly as the edge of the
rising tide spreads over the sand, but more slowly. In five minutes
all his hair had turned white except one lock on his brow.</p>

<p>"We were silent; and I wiped the perspiration from my face. M.
de la Nox was panting; Marceline was sobbing. Somehow that slow
whitening of the hair was more painful, more impressively dreadful
than those piercing, ear-splitting yells.</p>

<p>"M. de la Nox seemed almost at his wits' end. Twice I saw him
open his lips to question Theophrastus; twice he shut them without
a word. Then suddenly he stooped down and listened to the beating
of Theophrastus' heart. He stood upright again with an air of
relief and said:</p>

<p>"'What are you doing now, Cartouche?'</p>

<p>"'Shamming dead. After the red-hot irons and the boiling water
they poured into my ears I shammed dead. They have left me...
I am slipping the paper I wrote in my cell this morning, with
a splinter of wood, and my blood, into the crack in the wall above
my head. It tells where I've hid my treasures.'</p>

<p>"He was silent again; and again I saw the face of M. de la Nox
grow intent as once more he concentrated all his being on his
astral work. How I wished I had attained a height of psychic development
which would have enabled me to follow the wonderful, the miraculous
movements of his Astral Scalpel.</p>

<p>"It must have been nearly three-quarters of an hour later that
he heaved a deep sigh and said, 'Our work is nearly at an end.
Where are you now, Cartouche?'</p>

<p>"'I don't know quite what has happened,' said Theophrastus. 'I
hid the document; and I have not seen anyone since. When I open
my eyes&mdash;it is rather an effort &mdash;I do not recognise the
place to which they have brought me... I'm certainly not in the
Torture-chamber, nor in my cell in Montgomery Tower... There's
a faint blue light falling through the bars of a grating in front
of me... The moon is coming to visit me... The moonlight has descended
two or three of the steps which lead up from the grating... I
try to move... I can't... I'm a log. My will no longer commands
my muscles or limbs... It's as if all relations between my will
and my body had ceased... My brain is only master of my sight
and understanding. It is no longer master of my actions... My
poor limbs! I feel them <em>scattered</em> round about me... I
must have reached the point of suffering at which one suffers
no more... But where am I?... The moonlight descends two more
steps... And again two more steps... Ah! what is that it lights
up?... An eye&mdash;a big eye... The moonlight moves... A skull...
The moonlight moves... A bony hand!... I understand! I understand!
They have thrown me into a common grave!... The moonlight moves...
There are two legs of a dead man lying across my body!... I recognise
those steps now!... And that grating!... I am in the charnel-house
of Montfaucon!... <em>I am frightened!</em></p>

<p>"'When I used to go up the street of the Dead to carouse at the
Chopinettes, I often looked through that grating. I looked through
it curiously because I saw that one day I should lie in the charnel-house.
But never did it occur to me that when a body lay there, <em>it
could look out from the other side of the grating</em>! And now
my body looks out through it! They have thrown me into the charnel-house
because they believed me dead! I am buried alive with the bodies
of hanged men! My wretched fate surpasses anything that the imagination
of men could invent!</p>

<p>"'The saddest reflections assail me. I ask myself by what trick
of Fate I am reduced to such an extremity. I am forced to confess
that Fate played no part in the matter. It was my pride, nothing
but my accursed pride. I could have quietly remained King of all
the robbers, <em>if there had been any living with me</em>. Pretty-Milkmaid
was right when she said at the Queen Margot <em>that there was
no longer any living with me</em>. I would no longer listen to
a word from anyone; and when I called together my Grand Council,
I took no notice whatever of the resolutions it passed. I took
a delight in playing the despot; and I ended with that mania for
cutting up everyone I suspected into little bits. My lieutenants
ran greater risks in serving me than in disobeying me. They betrayed
me; and it was quite logical. <em>Oh, it's quite time for these
reflections, now that I'm in the charnel-house!</em></p>

<p>"'I'm alive in this charnel-house, alive among the dead; and
for the first time in my life <em>I am frightened</em>.'</p>

<p>"Theophrastus was silent for a minute; and we looked at one another
with harried eyes. Then in the same mournful, plaintive tones
he took up his tale again.</p>

<p>"'It's odd&mdash;very odd. Now that I'm on the very boundary of life
and death my senses perceive things which they could not perceive
when I was in health. My ears hear no more&mdash;that boiling water
destroyed my hearing&mdash;<em>yet they do hear</em>. There is a footfall,
a slinking footfall on the steps leading down to the grating...
Suddenly the moon ceases to light the charnel-house... Then I
see between me and the moon on the steps of the charnel-house,
a man! a living man!... Maybe I am saved! I wanted to cry aloud
with joy; and perhaps I should have cried aloud, if the horror
of what I <em>feel</em>, of what I <em>know</em>, had not sealed
my lips. I <em>feel</em>, I <em>know</em> that this man has come
to rob me of my hand... I read it, clearly, <em>in his brain</em>.
A lady of the Court has sent him for the charm&mdash;the charm to keep
her husband's love&mdash;the hand of a murderer&mdash;the hand of Cartouche!</p>

<p>"'<em>I read it in his brain as clearly as if I read it written</em>...
He is lighting a lantern... He has unlocked the grating and entered
the charnel-house... He has found my body, and is stooping over
it... He has taken my left hand in his left hand, and his knife
gleams in the light of the lantern... He is cutting through my
wrist... I do not feel the blade in my wrist; I see it... Ah!
I begin to feel the knife!... Oh! My wrist! My wrist!... It is
nearly severed... Ah! Ah! Ah!... It is severed!</p>

<p>"'What is this... The man howls... He is dancing about among
the dead... I see! I see... My hand has come away in the left
hand of the man who howls, but by a last miracle of the last life
in my wrist, <em>as it was severed</em>, my hand gripped the hand
of the man who howls!... Ha! Ha! he can't get rid of it!... It's
gripped him!... How it grips him!... He is dragging at it with
his right hand!... He can't stir it!... Ah, it isn't easy to rid
oneself of a <em>dead man's last grip</em>!... He is out of the
charnel-house, howling!... He bounds up the steps, howling!...
As he goes, howling, he is waving, like a madman, in the moonlight,
<em>my gripping hand</em>!'</p>

<p>"The voice of Theophrastus died faintly away; and I heard the
teeth of M. de la Nox chatter. Then he whispered:</p>

<p>"'Where are you now, Cartouche?'</p>

<p>"'I am entering the radiant darkness of death!'</p>
