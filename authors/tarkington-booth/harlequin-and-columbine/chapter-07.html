<p>For two hours, responding to the manipulation of the star and
his thoroughly subjugated playwright, the character of "Roderick
Hanscom"  grew nobler and nobler, speech by speech and deed by
deed, while the expression of the gentleman who was to impersonate
it became, in precise parallel with this regeneration, sweeter
and loftier and lovelier.</p>

<p>"A little Biblical quotation wouldn't go so bad right in there,"
he said, when they had finally established the Great Sacrifice
for a Woman. "We'll let Roderick have a line like: 'Greater love
hath no man than laying down his life to save another's.'" He
touched a page of the manuscript with his finger. "There's a good
place for it."</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid it would sound a little&mdash;smug?" Canby asked
timidly. "The way we've got him now, Roderick seems to me to be
always seeing himself as a splendid man and sort of pointing it
out to the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" cried Potter, astounded. "Hasn't it got to be
pointed out? The audience hasn't got a whole lifetime to study
him in; it's only got about two hours. Besides, I don't see what
you say; I don't see it at all! It seems to me I've worked him
around into being a perfectly natural character."</p>

<p>"I suppose you're right," said Canby, meekly scribbling.</p>

<p>"Biblical quotations never do any harm to the box-office," Potter
added. "You may not get a hand on 'em, but you'll never get a
cough, either."  He looked dreamily at the ceiling. "I've often
thought of doing a Biblical play. I'd have it built around the
character of St. Paul. That's one they haven't touched yet, and
it's new. I wouldn't do it with a beard and long hair. I wouldn't
use much makeup. No. Just the face as it is."</p>

<p>"You can do practically anything with a religious show," said
Tinker. "That's been proved. You can run in gambling and horse-racing
and ballys, and you'll get people into the house, night after
night, that think the theatre's wicked and wouldn't go to see
'Rip Van Winkle.' They do a lot of good, too&mdash;religious shows&mdash;just
that way."</p>

<p>"I think I'd play it in armour," Potter continued his thought,
still gazing at the ceiling. "I believe it would be a big thing."</p>

<p>"It might if it was touted right," said Tinker. "It all depends
on the touting. If you get it touted to the tank towns that you've
got a play with the great religious gonzabo, then your show's
a big property. Same if you get it touted for a great educational
gonzabo. Or 'artistic.' Get it touted right for 'artistic,' and
the tanks'll think they like it, even if they don't. Look at 'Cyrano'&mdash;they
liked Mansfield and his acting, but they didn't like the show.
They said they liked the show, and thought they did, but they
didn't. If they'd like it as much as they said they did, that
show would be running like 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.' Speaking of that"&mdash;he
paused, coughed, and went on&mdash;"I'm glad you've got the ingenue's
part straightened out in this piece. I thought from the first
it would stand a little lengthening."</p>

<p>Potter, unheeding, dreamily proceeded: "In silver armour. Might
silver the hair a little&mdash;not too much. Play it as a spiritual
character, but not solemn. Wouldn't make it turgid; keep it light.
Have the whole play spiritual but light. For instance, have room
in it for a religious ingenue part&mdash;make her a younger sister
of Mary Magdalene, say, with St. Paul becoming converted for her
sake after he'd been a Roman General. I believe it's a big idea."</p>

<p>Canby was growing nervous. All this seemed to be rambling farther
and farther from "Roderick Hanscom." Potter relieved his anxiety,
however, after a thoughtful sigh, by saying abruptly: "Well, well,
we can't go into a big production like that, this late in the
year. We'll have to see what can be done with 'Roderick Hanscom.'"
He looked at the door, where the Japanese was performing a shrinking
curtsey. "What is it, Sato?"</p>

<p>"Miss Pata."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Miss Pata."</p>

<p>A voice called from the hallway: "It's me, Mr. Potter. Packer."</p>

<p>"Oh, come in! Come in!"</p>

<p>The stage-manager made a deferential entrance. "It's about Miss&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Packer."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Potter." Evidently considering the command a
favour, Packer sat. "I saw Miss Lyston, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't turn her adrift," said his employer peevishly. "You
see, Mr. Canby, here's another of the difficulties of my position.
Miss Lyston has been with me for several years, and for this piece
we've got somebody I think will play her part better, but I haven't
any other part for Miss Lyston. And we start so late in the season,
this year, she'll probably not be able to get anything else to
do; so she's on my hands. I can't turn people out in the snow
like that. Some managers can, but I can't. And yet I have letters
begging me for all kinds of charities every day. They don't know
what my company costs me in money like this&mdash;absolutely thrown
away so far as any benefit to me is concerned. And often I find
I've been taken advantage of, too. I shouldn't be at all surprised
to find that Miss Lyston has comfortable investments right now,
and that she's only scheming to &mdash;Packer, don't you know
whether she's been saving her salary or not? If you don't you
ought to."</p>

<p>"I came to tell you, sir. I thought you might be relieved to
know. We don't have to bother about her, Mr. Potter. I've been
to see her at her flat, this evening, and she's as anxious to
get away from us, Mr. Potter, as we are to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The star rose to his feet, his face suffusing. "You sit there," 
he exclaimed, "and tell me that a member of my company finds the
association so distasteful that she wants to get away!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mr. Potter!" the stage-manager protested. "Not that
at all! She's very sorry to go. She asked me to tell you that
she felt she was giving up a great honour, and to thank you for
all your kindness to her."</p>

<p>"Go on!" Potter sternly bade him. "Why does she wish to leave
my company?"</p>

<p>"Why, it seems she's very much in love with her husband, sir,
Vorley Surbilt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem possible," said Potter, shaking his head. "I
know him, and it sounds like something you're making up as you
go along, Packer."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I'm not, Mr. Potter!" the stage-manager cried, in simple
distress. "I wouldn't know how."</p>

<p>"Go on!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it seems Vorly Surbilt was to go out with Mrs. Romaley,
and it seems that when Miss Lyston left rehearsal she drove around
till she found him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! I knew she was fooling me! I knew she wasn't sick! Went
to drive with her husband, and I pay the cab bill!"</p>

<p>"No, no, sir! I forgot to tell you; she wouldn't let me pay it.
She took him home and put him to bed&mdash;and from what I heard on
Broadway it was time somebody did! It seems they'd had an offer
to go into a vaudeville piece together, and after she got him
to bed she telephoned the vaudeville man, and had him bring up
a contract, and they signed it, though she had to guide Vorley's
hand for him. Anyway, he's signed up all right, and so is she.
That's why she was so anxious about fixing it up with us. I told
her it would be all right."</p>

<p>Potter relapsed into his chair in an attitude of gloom. "So they've
begun to leave Talbot Potter's company!" he said, nodding his
head with bitter melancholy. "For vaudeville! I'd better go to
farming at once; I often think of it. What sort of an act is it
that Miss Lyston prefers to remaining with me? Acrobatic?"</p>

<p>"It's a little play," said Packer. "It's from the Grand Guignol."</p>

<p>"French!" Potter this simply as an added insult on the part of
Miss Lyston. "French!"</p>

<p>"They say it's a wonderful little thing," said Packer innocently,
but it was as if he had run a needle into his sensitive employer.
Potter instantly sprang up again with a cry of pain.</p>

<p>"Of course it's wonderful! It's French; everything French is
wonderful, magnificent, Supreme! Everything French is <em>HOLY!
</em>Good God, Packer! You'll be telling me what my 'technique'
ought to be, next!"</p>

<p>He hurled himself again into the chair and moaned, then in a
dismal voice inquired; "Miss Lyston struck you as feeling that
her condition in life was distinctly improved by this ascent into
vaudeville, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all, Mr. Potter! But, of course," Packer explained
deprecatingly, "she's pleased to have Vorly where she can keep
an eye on him. She said that though she was all broken up about
leaving the company, she expected to be very happy in looking
after him. You see, sir, it's the first time in all their married
life they've had a chance to be together except one summer when
neither of 'em could get a stock engagement."</p>

<p>Potter made no reply but to shake his head despondently, and
Packer sat silent in deference, as if waiting to be questioned
further. It was the playwright who presently filled the void.
"Why haven't Mr. and Mrs. Surbilt gone into the same companies,
if they care to be together? I should think they'd have made it
a point to get engagements in the same ones."</p>

<p>Packer looked disturbed. "It's not done much," he said.</p>

<p>"Besides, Vorly Surbilt plays leading parts with women stars,"
old Tinker volunteered. "You see, naturally, it wouldn't do at
all."</p>

<p>"Jealousy, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily the kind you're thinking of. But it just doesn't
do."</p>

<p>"Some managers will allow married couples in their companies,"
Potter said, adding emphatically: "I won't! I never have and I
never will! Never! There's just one thing every soul in my support
has got to keep working for, and that is a high-tension performance
every night in the year. If married people are in love with each
other, they're going to think more about that than about the fact
that they're working for me. If they aren't in love with each
other, there's the devil to pay. I'd let the best man or woman
in the profession go&mdash;and they could go to vaudeville, for all
I cared!&mdash;if I had to keep their wives or husbands travelling
with us. I won't have 'em! My soul! I don't marry, do I?"</p>

<p>Packer rose. "Is there anything else for me, Mr. Potter?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Take this interlined script, get some copies typewritten,
and see that the company's sides are changed to suit it. Be especially
careful about that young Miss&mdash;ah &mdash;Miss Malone's. You'll
find her part is altered considerably, and will be even more,
when Mr. Canby gets the dialogue for other changes finished. He'll
let you have them to-morrow. By the way, Packer, where did you
find&mdash;" He paused, stretched out his hand to the miniature sedan
chair of liqueurs, took a decanter and tiny glass therefrom, and
carefully poured himself a sparkling emerald of creme de menthe.
"Will you have something, Mr. Canby?" he asked. "You, Tinker?"</p>

<p>Both declined in silence; they seemed preoccupied.</p>

<p>"Where did I what, Mr. Potter?" asked the stage-manager, reminding
him of the question left unfinished.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You said: 'By the way, where did you find&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." Potter smiled negligently. "Where did you find that
little Miss Malone? At the agents'?"</p>

<p>Packer echoed him: "Where did I find her?" He scratched his head.
"Miss"&mdash;he said ruminatively, repeating the word slowly, like
a man trying to work out the solution of a puzzle&mdash;"Miss&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Malone. I suppose you got her at an agent's?"</p>

<p>"Let's see," said Packer. "At an agent's? No. No, it wasn't.
Come to think of it, it wasn't."</p>

<p>"Then where did you get her?" Tinker inquired.</p>

<p>"That's what I just asked him," Potter said, placing his glass
upon a table without having tasted the liqueur. "What's the matter,
Packer? Gone to sleep?"</p>

<p>"I remember now," said Packer, laughing deferentially. "Of course!
No. It wasn't through any of the agents. Now I remember&mdash;come
to think of it &mdash;I sort of ran across her myself, as a matter
of fact. I wasn't just sure who you meant at first. You mean the
understudy, the one that's to play Miss Lyston's part, that Miss
&mdash;Miss&mdash;" He snapped a finger and thumb to spur memory and
then, as in triumphant solution of his puzzle, cried, "Ma &mdash;Malone!
Miss Malone!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Potter, looking upon him darkly. "Where did you sort
of run across her, come to think of it, as a matter of fact?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember all about it, now," said Packer brightly. "Why,
she was playing last summer in stock out at Seeleyville, Pennsylvania.
That's only about six miles from Packer's Ridge, where my father
lives. I spent a couple of weeks with him, and we trolleyed over
one evening to see 'The Little Minister,' because father got it
in his head some way that it was about the Baptists, and I couldn't
talk him out of it. It wasn't as bad a performance as you'd think,
and this little girl was a pretty fair 'Babbie.' Father forgot
all about the Baptists and kept talking about her after we got
home, until nothing would do but we must go over and see that
show again. He wanted to take her right out to the farm and adopt
her&mdash;or something; he's a widower, and all alone out there. Fact
is, I had all I could do to keep him from going around to ask
her, and I was pretty near afraid he'd speak to her from the audience.
Well, to satisfy him, I did go around after the show, and gave
her my card, and told her if I could do anything for her in New
York to let me know. Of course, naturally, when I got back to
town I forgot all about it, but I got a note from her that she
was here, looking for an engagement, the very day you told me
to scare up an understudy. So I thought she might do as well as
anybody I'd get at the agent's, and I let her have it." He drew
a breath of relief, like that of a witness leaving the stand,
and with another placative laugh, letting his eyes fall humbly
under the steady scrutiny of his master, he concluded: "Of course
I remember all about it, only at first I wasn't sure which one
you meant; it's such a large company."</p>

<p>"I see," said Potter grimly. "You engaged her to please your
father."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Potter!" the stage-manager protested. "If you don't
like her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do!" Potter cut him off, and paced the floor, virulently
brooding. "And so Talbot Potter's company is to be made up of
actors engaged to suit the personal whims of L. Smith Packer's
father, old Mister Packer of Baptist Ridge, near Seeleyville,
Pennsylvania!"</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Potter, if you don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I said that would DO!" roared Potter. "Good-night!"</p>

<p>"Good-night, sir," said the stage-manager humbly, and humbly
got himself out of the room, to be heard, an instant later, bidding
the Japanese an apologetic good-night at the outer door of the
apartment.</p>

<p>Canby rose to take his own departure, promising to have the new
dialogue "worked out" by morning.</p>

<p>"He is, too!" said Potter, not heeding the playwright, but confirming
an unuttered thought in his own mind. He halted at the table,
where he had set his tiny glass, and gulped the emerald at a swallow.
"I always thought he was!"</p>

<p>"Was what?" inquired old Tinker.</p>

<p>"A hypocrite!"</p>

<p>"D'you mean Packer?" said Tinker incredulously.</p>

<p>"He's a hypocrite!" Potter shouted fiercely. "And I shouldn't
be surprised if his father was another! Widower! I never saw the
man in my life, but I'd swear it on oath! He is a hypocrite! Packer's
father is a damned old Baptist hypocrite!"</p>
