<p>The three whites were still gazing toward the eastern shore,
intently looking for some sign, or listening to some sound which
might tell something regarding Shasta, when they were startled
by a loud whirring or buzzing overhead, and looking up saw a large
bird passing within a few feet of them&mdash;so close that its claws
could be seen curled up against its body, as it made a sudden
sweep to the right, frightened at its near approach to its human
enemies.</p>

<p>"Shoot it!" called out Elwood to Howard. "My gun isn't loaded,
and it will make us a good breakfast."</p>

<p>But the bird, whatever it was, did not choose to wait until the
heavy rifle could be brought to bear upon it; and by the time
Howard had fairly got the idea through his head, it was skimming
away over the country toward the Coast Range.</p>

<p>But a sharper eye and an unerring aim was leveled against it,
and as they were watching its flight it suddenly turned over and
over, its great wings going like the arms of a windmill as it
dropped swiftly to the earth; and, as it disappeared in the trees
and undergrowth, the crack of a rifle came across the intervening
space.</p>

<p>"That was Shasta!" exclaimed Elwood in delight.</p>

<p>"Certainly, we might have known what he was after. He thinks
we do not admire fish as a steady diet and has gone after fowl
for us."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Elwood, who sometimes seemed
to alternate with Howard in his knowledge of the ways of the wood.
"I can't see that there was any more chance of seeing birds there
than upon the island. That same fowl passed closer to us than
it did to him."</p>

<p>"I suppose," laughed Howard, "that he was hunting after game
of some kind, and had no idea of shooting the bird until it passed
so near him that he saw it was quite the thing we needed, and
so he toppled it over."</p>

<p>"Me views intirely," assented Tim. "I agraas wid both of yees."</p>

<p>A few moments later the Pah Utah appeared with the bird in his
hand, and flinging it into the canoe quickly paddled back to the
island. His bird proved to be a species of wild goose, that seemed
to have strayed from its flock and gone wandering through the
Salinas Valley at this season of the year ultimately to fall before
the rifle of Shasta.</p>

<p>Our friends were in ecstasies over their prospective meal. The
Indian displayed the same skill in dressing the bird that he did
in preparing the fish. The feathers were quickly twitched off,
and the dry driftwood piled upon the upper end of the island was
the best fuel they could have had for the purpose. When done,
it was "done brown," and to a turn; and to the famishing travelers
nothing could have been more savory and luscious.</p>

<p>The truth of it was, the boys found that this kind of life was
agreeing with them amazingly. Their appetites were fierce, their
sleep sound, and a feeling of perfect health diffused itself through
their glowing frames, such as they had never known before. Their
exposure to the night air troubled them at first, but they soon
recovered from it and enjoyed "camping out" as thoroughly as did
old campaigners.</p>

<p>It was a very good thing, it is true, for a while; but don't
let any boys get the idea of following their example, unless they
are compelled in precisely the same manner to do so. If any youngster
imagines he has formed true ideas of distant countries from the
narratives of adventures which he may have read, he will find
himself most woefully mistaken. Never think of traveling until
you are a married man, and by that time you will have made up
your mind to be sensible and stay at home.</p>

<p>When the meal was finished, and their appetites satisfied, the
Pah Utah, instead of immediately embarking, walked to the lower
end of the island, and stood for some time apparently examining
some sign further down the river. Following the direction of his
eyes, our friends could see nothing unusual until Elwood detected
something in the air on the western bank which at first resembled
a light cloud, but which they imagined might be caused by a camp-fire.</p>

<p>Whatever it was that attracted the attention of Shasta he took
but a few moments to decide regarding it. Going again to his canoe,
he entered it without a word or sign, and paddled away at his
swiftest rate straight toward it, while his companions watched
the proceeding with as much interest as in the preceding case.</p>

<p>The camp appeared fully a half-mile distant, and it took but
a short time for the Indian to reach a point opposite, when he
sprung lightly ashore and disappeared with his usual celerity.</p>

<p>"He is cautious," remarked Elwood. "He doesn't wish us to undertake
to pass it unless he is sure there will be no trouble."</p>

<p>"A sinsible young man!" asserted Tim. "His parents have the best
raison for faaling proud of so promising a young gintleman."</p>

<p>"And so have we."</p>

<p>A few moments elapsed, when the Pah Utah reappeared and came
back as rapidly as he went.</p>

<p>The first thing he did upon reaching the island was again to
fasten the boats together, and then motion to the three to enter.
This, of course, they did without delay, and took their usual
positions.</p>

<p>But Shasta was not satisfied. He told them, in his manner, to
lie down; and not until the three had so arranged themselves as
to be invisible from both shores, did he dip his paddle and resume
his journey.</p>

<p>"This means danger," said Elwood. "He doesn't wish any one to
know we are in the boats."</p>

<p>"And we must be sure and obey him."</p>

<p>"It's aisy doing, as my brother used to say whin his wife tould
him, in her gintle manner, by the help of her broomstick, to go
to bed."</p>

<p>"And, Elwood, you are close to Terror, see that he doesn't let
his curiosity got the better of his judgment."</p>

<p>The Pah Utah was satisfied, and now began plying his paddle.
It was difficult for the three so to govern their curiosity as
not to peep over the side of the canoe; but there were good reasons
for their not doing so, and they scarcely moved a limb for the
next hour.</p>

<p>They had gone but a little way when Terror raised his head and
uttered a slight bark; but a word from Elwood quieted him. Finally,
Shasta paused and uttered a guttural sound in his own tongue,
which was taken as permission for them to rise.</p>

<p>As they did so, they looked behind. The dim smoke ascending in
the summer sky was seen far behind, and between it and them the
Salinas made another bend, so that they had no cause to fear observation
from that party at least.</p>

<p>Shasta again disconnected the two canoes&mdash;an act which did not
surprise them; but his next proceeding astonished them a good
deal.</p>

<p>Reaching across the boats, he shook hands with them all, at the
same time muttering a word or two to each.</p>

<p>"He is going to leave us," said Elwood, with an air of disappointment.</p>

<p>"He has good reason for doing so, but I am afraid it will be
bad for us."</p>

<p>"Adieu, Mr. Shasta, adieu!" said Tim O'Rooney, with considerable
feeling. "You've done us a good turn and we'll not forget you.
If yez ever drifts into San Francisco, give us a call."</p>

<p>The Indian motioned to them to proceed, and using his paddle
with his extraordinary skill, he sped up the river toward the
camp-fire, and in a very short time vanished.</p>
