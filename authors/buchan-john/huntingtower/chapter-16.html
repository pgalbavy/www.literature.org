<p>The three days of storm ended in the night, and with the wild
weather there departed from the Cruives something which had weighed
on Dickson's spirits since he first saw the place. Monday&mdash;only
a week from the morning when he had conceived his plan of holiday&mdash;saw
the return of the sun and the bland airs of spring. Beyond the
blue of the yet restless waters rose dim mountains tipped with
snow, like some Mediterranean seascape. Nesting birds were busy
on the Laver banks and in the Huntingtower thickets; the village
smoked peacefully to the clear skies; even the House looked cheerful
if dishevelled. The Garple Dean was a garden of swaying larches,
linnets, and wild anemones. Assuredly, thought Dickson, there
had come a mighty change in the countryside, and he meditated
a future discourse to the Literary Society of the Guthrie Memorial
Kirk on "Natural Beauty in Relation to the Mind of Man."</p>

<p>It remains for the chronicler to gather up the loose ends of
his tale. There was no newspaper story with bold headlines of
this the most recent assault on the shores of Britain. Alexis
Nicolaevitch, once a Prince of Muscovy and now Mr. Alexander Nicholson
of the rising firm of Sprot and Nicholson of Melbourne, had interest
enough to prevent it. For it was clear that if Saskia was to be
saved from persecution, her enemies must disappear without trace
from the world, and no story be told of the wild venture which
was their undoing. The constabulary of Carrick and Scotland Yard
were indisposed to ask questions, under a hint from their superiors,
the more so as no serious damage had been done to the persons
of His Majesty's lieges, and no lives had been lost except by
the violence of Nature. The Procurator-Fiscal investigated the
case of the drowned men, and reported that so many foreign sailors,
names and origins unknown, had perished in attempting to return
to their ship at the Garplefoot. The Danish brig had vanished
into the mist of the northern seas. But one signal calamity the
Procurator-Fiscal had to record. The body of Loudon the factor
was found on the Monday morning below the cliffs, his neck broken
by a fall. In the darkness and confusion he must have tried to
escape in that direction, and he had chosen an impracticable road
or had slipped on the edge. It was returned as "death by misadventure"
and the <em>Carrick Herald</em> and the <em>Auchenlochan Advertiser</em>
excelled themselves in eulogy. Mr. Loudon, they said, had been
widely known in the south-west of Scotland as an able and trusted
lawyer, an assiduous public servant, and not least as a good sportsman.
It was the last trait which had led to his death, for, in his
enthusiasm for wild nature, he had been studying bird life on
the cliffs of the Cruives during the storm, and had made that
fatal slip which had deprived the shire of a wise counsellor and
the best of good fellows.</p>

<p>The tinklers of the Garplefoot took themselves off, and where
they may now be pursuing their devious courses is unknown to the
chronicler. Dobson, too, disappeared, for he was not among the
dead from the boats. He knew the neighbourhood and probably made
his way to some port from which he took passage to one or other
of those foreign lands which had formerly been honoured by his
patronage. Nor did all the Russians perish. Three were found skulking
next morning in the woods, starving and ignorant of any tongue
but their own, and five more came ashore much battered but alive.
Alexis took charge of the eight survivors, and arranged to pay
their passage to one of the British Dominions and to give them
a start in a new life. They were broken creatures, with the dazed
look of lost animals, and four of them had been peasants on Saskia's
estates. Alexis spoke to them in their own language. "In my grandfather's
time," he said, "you were serfs. Then there came a change, and
for some time you were free men. Now you have slipped back into
being slaves again&mdash;the worst of slaveries, for you have been
the serfs of fools and scoundrels and the black passion of your
own hearts. I give you a chance of becoming free men once more.
You have the task before you of working out your own salvation.
Go, and God be with you."</p>

<p>Before we take leave of these companions of a single week I would
present them to you again as they appeared on a certain sunny
afternoon when the episode of Huntingtower was on the eve of closing.
First we see Saskia and Alexis walking on the thymy sward of the
cliff-top, looking out to the fretted blue of the sea. It is a
fitting place for lovers, above all for lovers who have turned
the page on a dark preface, and have before them still the long
bright volume of life. The girl has her arm linked with the man's,
but as they walk she breaks often away from him, to dart into
copses, to gather flowers, or to peer over the brink where the
gulls wheel and oyster-catchers pipe among the shingle. She is
no more the tragic muse of the past week, but a laughing child
again, full of snatches of song, her eyes bright with expectation.
They talk of the new world which lies before them, and her voice
is happy. Then her brows contract, and, as she flings herself
down on a patch of young heather, her air is thoughtful.</p>

<p>"I have been back among fairy tales," she says. "I do not quite
understand, Alesha. Those gallant little boys! They are youth,
and youth is always full of strangeness. Mr. Heritage! He is youth,
too, and poetry, perhaps, and a soldier's tradition. I think I
know him.... But what about Dickson? He is the <em>petit bourgeois</em>,
the <em>Ã©picier</em>, the class which the world ridicules. He
is unbelievable. The others with good fortune I might find elsewhere&mdash;in
Russia perhaps. But not Dickson."</p>

<p>"No," is the answer. "You will not find him in Russia. He is
what we call the middle-class, which we who were foolish used
to laugh at. But he is the stuff which above all others makes
a great people. He will endure when aristocracies crack and proletariats
crumble. In our own land we have never known him, but till we
create him our land will not be a nation."</p>

<p>Half a mile away on the edge of the Laver glen Dickson and Heritage
are together, Dickson placidly smoking on a tree-stump and Heritage
walking excitedly about and cutting with his stick at the bracken.
Sundry bandages and strips of sticking plaster still adorn the
Poet, but his clothes have been tidied up by Mrs. Morran, and
he has recovered something of his old precision of garb. The eyes
of both are fixed on the two figures on the cliff-top. Dickson
feels acutely uneasy. It is the first time that he has been alone
with Heritage since the arrival of Alexis shivered the Poet's
dream. He looks to see a tragic grief; to his amazement he beholds
something very like exultation.</p>

<p>"The trouble about you, Dogson," says Heritage, "is that you're
a bit of an anarchist. All you false romantics are. You don't
see the extraordinary beauty of the conventions which time has
consecrated. You always want novelty, you know, and the novel
is usually the ugly and rarely the true. I am for romance, but
upon the old, noble classic lines."</p>

<p>Dickson is scarcely listening. His eyes are on the distant lovers
and he longs to say something which will gently and graciously
express his sympathy with his friend.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," he begins hesitatingly, "I'm afraid you've had
a bad blow, Mr. Heritage. You're taking it awful well, and I honour
you for it."</p>

<p>The Poet flings back his head. "I am reconciled," he says. "After
all ''tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved
at all.' It has been a great experience and has shown me my own
heart. I love her, I shall always love her, but I realise that
she was never meant for me. Thank God I've been able to serve
her&mdash;that is all a moth can ask of a star. I'm a better man for
it, Dogson. She will be a glorious memory, and Lord! what poetry
I shall write! I give her up joyfully, for she has found her true
mate. 'Let us not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments!'
The thing's too perfect to grieve about.... Look! There is romance
incarnate."</p>

<p>He points to the figures now silhouetted against the further
sea. "How does it go, Dogson?" he cries. "'And on her lover's
arm she leant'&mdash;what next? You know the thing."</p>

<p>Dickson assists and Heritage declaims:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"And on her lover's arm she leant,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And round her waist she felt it fold,<br/>
&nbsp;And far across the hills they went<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that new world which is the old:<br/>
&nbsp;Across the hills, and far away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond their utmost purple rim,<br/>
&nbsp;And deep into the dying day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy princess followed him."

</p>
</div>
<p>He repeats the last two lines twice and draws a deep breath.
"How right!" he cries. "How absolutely right! Lord! It's astonishing
how that old bird Tennyson got the goods!"</p>

<p>After that Dickson leaves him and wanders among the thickets
on the edge of the Huntingtower policies above the Laver glen.
He feels childishly happy, wonderfully young, and at the same
time supernaturally wise. Sometimes he thinks the past week has
been a dream, till he touches the sticking-plaster on his brow,
and finds that his left thigh is still a mass of bruises and that
his right leg is wofully stiff. With that the past becomes very
real again, and he sees the Garple Dean in that stormy afternoon,
he wrestles again at midnight in the dark House, he stands with
quaking heart by the boats to cut off the retreat. He sees it
all, but without terror in the recollection, rather with gusto
and a modest pride. "I've surely had a remarkable time," he tells
himself, and then Romance, the goddess whom he has worshipped
so long, marries that furious week with the idyllic. He is supremely
content, for he knows that in his humble way he has not been found
wanting. Once more for him the Chavender or Chub, and long dreams
among summer hills. His mind flies to the days ahead of him, when
he will go wandering with his pack in many green places. Happy
days they will be, the prospect with which he has always charmed
his mind. Yes, but they will be different from what he had fancied,
for he is another man than the complacent little fellow who set
out a week ago on his travels. He has now assurance of himself,
assurance of his faith. Romance, he sees, is one and indivisible....</p>

<p>Below him by the edge of the stream he sees the encampment of
the Gorbals Die-Hards. He calls and waves a hand, and his signal
is answered. It seems to be washing day, for some scanty and tattered
raiment is drying on the sward. The band is evidently in session,
for it is sitting in a circle, deep in talk.</p>

<p>As he looks at the ancient tents, the humble equipment, the ring
of small shockheads, a great tenderness comes over him. The Die-Hards
are so tiny, so poor, so pitifully handicapped, and yet so bold
in their meagreness. Not one of them has had anything that might
be called a chance. Their few years have been spent in kennels
and closes, always hungry and hunted, with none to care for them;
their childish ears have been habituated to every coarseness,
their small minds filled with the desperate shifts of living....
And yet, what a heavenly spark was in them! He had always thought
nobly of the soul; now he wants to get on his knees before the
queer greatness of humanity.</p>

<p>A figure disengages itself from the group, and Dougal makes his
way up the hill towards him. The Chieftain is not more reputable
in garb than when we first saw him, nor is he more cheerful of
countenance. He has one arm in a sling made out of his neckerchief,
and his scraggy little throat rises bare from his voluminous shirt.
All that can be said for him is that he is appreciably cleaner.
He comes to a standstill and salutes with a special formality.</p>

<p>"Dougal," says Dickson, "I've been thinking. You're the grandest
lot of wee laddies I ever heard tell of, and, forbye, you've saved
my life. Now, I'm getting on in years, though you'll admit that
I'm not that dead old, and I'm not a poor man, and I haven't chick
or child to look after. None of you has ever had a proper chance
or been right fed or educated or taken care of. I've just the
one thing to say to you. From now on you're <em>my</em> bairns,
every one of you. You're fine laddies, and I'm going to see that
you turn into fine men. There's the stuff in you to make Generals
and Provosts&mdash;ay, and Prime Ministers, and Dod! it'll not be my
blame if it doesn't get out."</p>

<p>Dougal listens gravely and again salutes.</p>

<p>"I've brought ye a message," he says. "We've just had a meetin'
and I've to report that ye've been unanimously eleckit Chief Die-Hard.
We're a' hopin' ye'll accept."</p>

<p>"I accept," Dickson replies. "Proudly and gratefully I accept."</p>

<p>The last scene is some days later, in a certain southern suburb
of Glasgow. Ulysses has come back to Ithaca, and is sitting by
his fireside, waiting on the return of Penelope from the Neuk
Hydropathic. There is a chill in the air, so a fire is burning
in the grate, but the laden tea-table is bright with the first
blooms of lilac. Dickson, in a new suit with a flower in his buttonhole,
looks none the worse for his travels, save that there is still
sticking-plaster on his deeply sunburnt brow. He waits impatiently
with his eye on the black marble timepiece, and he fingers something
in his pocket.</p>

<p>Presently the sound of wheels is heard, and the peahen voice
of Tibby announces the arrival of Penelope. Dickson rushes to
the door and at the threshold welcomes his wife with a resounding
kiss. He leads her into the parlour and settles her in her own
chair.</p>

<p>"My! but it's nice to be home again!" she says. "And everything
that comfortable. I've had a fine time, but there's no place like
your own fireside. You're looking awful well, Dickson. But losh!
What have you been doing to your head?"</p>

<p>"Just a small tumble. It's very near mended already. Ay, I've
had a grand walking tour, but the weather was a wee bit thrawn.
It's nice to see you back again, Mamma. Now that I'm an idle man
you and me must take a lot of jaunts together."</p>

<p>She beams on him as she stays herself with Tibby's scones, and
when the meal is ended, Dickson draws from his pocket a slim case.
The jewels have been restored to Saskia, but this is one of her
own which she has bestowed upon Dickson as a parting memento.
He opens the case and reveals a necklet of emeralds, any one of
which is worth half the street.</p>

<p>"This is a present for you," he says bashfully.</p>

<p>Mrs. McCunn's eyes open wide. "You're far too kind," she gasps.
"It must have cost an awful lot of money."</p>

<p>"It didn't cost me that much," is the truthful answer.</p>

<p>She fingers the trinket and then clasps it round her neck, where
the green depths of the stones glow against the black satin of
her bodice. Her eyes are moist as she looks at him. "You've been
a kind man to me," she says, and she kisses him as she has not
done since Janet's death.</p>

<p>She stands up and admires the necklet in the mirror. Romance
once more, thinks Dickson. That which has graced the slim throats
of princesses in far-away Courts now adorns an elderly matron
in a semi-detached villa; the jewels of the wild Nausicaa have
fallen to the housewife Penelope.</p>

<p>Mrs. McCunn preens herself before the glass. "I call it very
genteel," she says. "Real stylish. It might be worn by a queen."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say but it has," says Dickson.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>
