<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Now, by all rules of the game, it was the prerogative of Miss Violet
Hawtry to take charge of a situation in which the star of a play meets
the author; but she missed her cue, and the gutter instinct within her
sat dumb and dumfounded before the lady from Adairville.
</p>
<p>"I'm charmed to meet you, Miss Hawtry," Miss Adair assured her, with a
glance of such admiration and friendliness that even Violet's
narrow-gage soul expanded into a variety of graciousness all its own,
and she smiled back into the eyes of the young author with a radiance
that had the semblance of warmth.
</p><p>"And this is Miss Lindsey, whom we have chosen to support you in our
play, Miss Hawtry," Mr. Dennis Farraday continued, with a glance of
respectful awe at the Hawtry, which matched that given her by the
author a second before and obtained for Miss Lindsey a cordial enough
recognition of the introduction only slightly to frapp√© her instead of
freezing her entirely. "We are all hungry," he added after the change of
civilities.
</p><p>"You are all having luncheon with me," Mr. Vandeford found his voice to
say. Ignoring Violet's glance of indignation at this skilful avoidance
of a climax of her scene with him, he had three extra covers laid at the
corner table devoted to the services of Miss Hawtry.
</p><p>"I warned you that we were hungry, Van," said Mr. Farraday, as he began
to search through the menu for an article of diet safe to pour in
quantities into a girl who had long been empty. "How'd rare steak and
fresh mushrooms do?" he asked, and he looked away from what he was sure
would be in the eyes of Miss Lindsey, and which was there.
</p><p>"Wonderful!" she murmured.
</p><p>"Right-o, for you and Miss Lindsey, but what about nightingales' tongues
for my author?" laughed Mr. Vandeford, with an interested note in his
rich voice, which caused Miss Hawtry to look at him sharply and Miss
Adair to repeat the blush to such a degree that Miss Hawtry, as Miss
Lindsey before her, was forced to admit that it was native and not
imported. The flush did not pass unnoticed by Mr. Vandeford, as he
laughed again with a question as to her nourishing.
</p><p>"I want something that I don't know what the name means," calmly
returned Miss Adair, with delighted excitement at the thought of
adventuring into a land of strange food. "I know steak and ham and eggs
and chicken and turkey."
</p><p>"Will you trust me?" asked Mr. Vandeford. There was an eagerness in his
voice and smile that again made the Violet glance at him and then at Mr.
Dennis Farraday. The latter was beaming with mirth at the dilemma of
feeding the young author who was so frankly scattering her hay-seeds on
the metropolitan atmosphere. At that instant Miss Hawtry made a
momentous decision.
</p><p>"Trust Mr. Vandeford and you can't go wrong," she advised with peaches
and cream in her voice, and for some unknown reason Mr. Vandeford would
have been glad to twist the creamy throat from which issued the creamy
voice. Instead, he turned, calmly summoned the head waiter, and went
into a conference with him in a few very discreet words, which the rest
could not hear, though there was no sign of any intention of keeping the
consultation from them.
</p><p>"I think it will be wonderful not to know until I taste it and maybe not
then!" exclaimed the author, with another of her sea-gray, long-lashed
glances of worshiping admiration at Mr. Vandeford, the eminent Broadway
producer who was putting a great star into her play based on the
adventures of an ancestress.
</p><p>Of course the situation was dangerous to both Mr. Vandeford and his
author, but who was to blame?
</p><p>And the jolly, impromptu luncheon-party was not the kind of episode that
could soon be forgotten by any of the guests. The unknown food for the
author was served by the head waiter himself, and he refused to answer
questions as to its origin or component parts, even when urged by Mr.
Dennis Farraday. The expression on Miss Lindsey's face after her
encounter with the steak and mushrooms, served with an exalted baked
potato, was one of decided relaxation. The look of affection in her eyes
as she glanced at the author who had dragged her into this food
situation rivaled the suddenly rooted admiration which beamed in the
eyes of Mr. Dennis Farraday and which put Miss Hawtry alertly on watch,
so much so that Mr. Godfrey Vandeford was privileged to lean back in his
chair behind a mist of cigarette-smoke and let his eyes gleam where they
listed.
</p><p>"Now tell us just how you happened to think of all the wonderful things
in your play, Miss Adair, specially that dinner situation," Mr. Dennis
Farraday urged. He was lighting Miss Hawtry's cigarette, to the intense,
though concealed, interest and astonishment of Miss Adair of Adairville,
Kentucky. He thus asked sincerely and interestedly the usual question
that the unsophisticated fires at an author at the first opportunity and
which the author, no matter how sophisticated, really enjoys answering.
</p><p>And thereupon followed the story of the old letters in the trunk, with
the mortgage only so lightly and proudly alluded to that the hearts of
the listeners were decidedly touched, told by the author with the
delighted enthusiasm that their sympathy warranted.
</p><p>"And so you see, since it couldn't be oil-wells or gold mines it had to
be the play," she ended, quoting herself in her conversation with the
faithful Roger, who was at that moment following his plow with his mind
on the straight furrows and his heart in New York.
</p><p>"You are a precious darling, and your play <u>must</u> succeed!" said Miss
Lindsey impulsively at the end of the recital, and then she quickly
glanced at Mr. Godfrey Vandeford to see if he resented her taking this
affectionate liberty with his distinguished author. She found that
eminent producer not at home to her glance; he was lost in contemplation
of tears that hung on the long black lashes that veiled Miss Adair's
gray eyes and a little quiver that manifested itself on her red lips.
Then she shook off the tears by lifting those long lashes so that she
could look straight into his eyes with a smile of absolute confidence in
his intention and ability to remove from her life forever all of her
distress, which was alone poverty in the concrete, by being the
successful producer of her wonderful play. Men of Godfrey Vandeford's
type admit many strange fires and their votaries into the outer temple
of their hearts, but they keep the inner shrine tightly surrounded by
asbestos curtains. However, there is always one, and one only, closely
guarded entrance through which the ultimate woman must slip in an
unguarded moment. Mr. Godfrey Vandeford would never have thought of
being on any particular guard against the author of a play in purple
ribbons entitled "The Renunciation of Rosalind," but he knew almost
instantly that something dire had happened to him as he sat and writhed
at the thought of his plans for the extinction of that piece of dramatic
art, which he had not even read. The whole sophisticated world has
decided that there is no such thing as love at first sight, except the
biological scientists and they know and can prove that such a thing does
exist and that it is a worker of wonders. And dire pain is one of its
reactions.
</p><p>But all agony comes to an end and so did Mr. Vandeford's. Miss Hawtry,
who had been so busy in her own mind with her own schemes that she had
no time to listen to Miss Adair's, picked up her gloves from beside her
final coffee-cup, and pulled the fine-meshed veil down over her
beautiful, though slightly snubbed, nose as a signal for a separation of
the group of feasters.
</p><p>"May I motor you to your hotel, Miss Adair?" she asked very sweetly. Of
course Patricia did not know that she had got in her invitation at the
first signal of the feasters' disintegration, which she herself had
given, for the purpose of forestalling a similar invitation from Mr.
Farraday, whose Surreness she knew must be moored somewhere near. "Where
are you stopping?" she asked with very little interest, and received an
answer that almost upset her equanimity.
</p><p>"I'm staying at the Young Women's Christian Association," calmly
announced the author of "The Purple Slipper," with no sense of
embarrassment in either voice or manner. "Thank you for offering to take
me there, but Mr. Farraday is going to take Miss Lindsey and me to buy a
hat at a place which Miss Lindsey knows of. She is going to buy one,
too, now that she is going to play in our play."
</p><p>"The Y. W. C. A.! Great guns!" muttered Mr. Vandeford under his breath,
while the Violet leaned back in her chair and fanned herself.
</p><p>Then very suddenly Mr. Vandeford sat up and looked at Miss Mildred
Lindsey keenly for half a second.
</p><p>"We'll have to go back to the office to get that check for Miss Lindsey
before we go hat-hunting," announced good Dennis, with a calmness that
made Mr. Vandeford suspect that he had met the fact of the eminent
author's abiding-place before and had got used to it. "You and Miss
Hawtry going over to the office, Van, or will you come with us, if she
has other folderols to follow in a different direction?"
</p><p>"I am to see Adelaide about my costumes for 'The Purple Slipper' at
two-twenty, so must forego the pleasure of--of hat-hunting this
afternoon," Violet murmured faintly. "But I know Mr. Vandeford will
adore going with you." Miss Hawtry felt that safety lay in numbers, and
she preferred to leave the unsophistication of Miss Adair with both Mr.
Godfrey Vandeford and Mr. Dennis Farraday than with either of them
alone.
</p><p>"I wish I could get out after the hat, but you people must remember that
I am putting on 'The Purple Slipper,' and I have to be about Miss
Adair's business while old Denny buzzes about hat roses, free and equal
with her," answered Mr. Vandeford. His envy, apparent in his voice, of
the care-free state of Mr. Farraday was very real, though none of the
others could guess its meaning. "I'll see all of you later. By!" and
with a sign to the head waiter, which tied tight Mr. Farraday's
purse-strings, Mr. Vandeford left them while the going was good. So
determined was his exit that Miss Hawtry could not keep him back for the
finish of the fight.
</p><p>And Mr. Vandeford was in a mortal hurry. He had much to do and undo. He
arrived at his office, three squares away, slightly out of breath.
</p><p>"Did you see her, Pops?" he demanded of Mr. Adolph Meyers.
</p><p>"I did, Mr. Vandeford, sir, and here is a carbon of the letter I sent
her, not with any encouragement to come to New York at all," and in
self-defense he handed out to Mr. Vandeford a copy of the letter Roger
had delivered to Patricia among her roses and young onions and
string-beans.
</p><p>"Take it away," commanded Mr. Vandeford, seating himself at his desk and
wildly shunting papers and letters about.
</p><p>"Mr. Vandeford, sir, I am sorry for that young lady and I ask you to
have a heart," Mr. Meyers ventured to say to his chief with a boldness
which he himself could not understand, but with which Mr. Vandeford was
strangely patient. He ended with, "It will be a nobleness for you to not
produce a cold show for her, but pay a small damage sum for such a
beautiful lady and call it all off."
</p><p>"My God, Pops, I'd give half the 'Rosie Posie' to be able to do it! But
Denny and Violet and that girl they engaged for support have already
filled her full of success dope about the play, and if I call it off
arbitrarily, where shall I stand with her?" Ignorance of the
completeness of his own capitulation to the faith and tears in the
sea-gray eyes, and the genuine, grown-on-the-spot blush from Adairville,
Kentucky, showed in the consternation with which he asked the question
of his henchman.
</p><p>"'Stand with her'!" repeated Mr. Meyers, with a consternation that
matched his chief's, but was of different origin. "You had no such fear
when you called off from rehearsals in the second week the comedy of Mr.
Hinkle, and a fourth of the damages paid to him will to her be--"
</p><p>"Get to work under your hat, Pops, get to work! The 'Purple Slipper' has
got to go on Broadway and go big. I followed that purple hunch for pure
cussedness against Violet, and now watch it lead me by the nose. You
get Gerald Height on the wire as soon as you can, while I talk to
Rooney."
</p><p>"But, Mr. Vandeford, sir, it is not a Hawtry play, and--"
</p><p>"Get busy, get busy, Pops! Put a copy of that manuscript on my desk
where I can lay hands on it the minute I get a chance. Get everything
going for a week later than I first called the show and--"
</p><hr/>
<p>"Here we are!" exclaimed Mr. Dennis Farraday, as he burst into the outer
office, ushering as a wedge before him Miss Patricia Adair and Miss
Mildred Lindsey. "Got that hat-check, Pops? Money, I mean, for Miss
Lindsey, not a pasteboard for your own lid from some hotel."
</p><p>For a minute Mr. Vandeford lost himself in the depths of the worshiping,
gray eyes that seemed to have been lifted to his for all eternity in
that terrible faith and gratitude. Then he went into action as captain
of the ship which was to come into the port of Adairville, Kentucky,
with all sails set, loaded or bearing his dead body.
</p><p>"You and Miss Adair extract money from Pops with a can-opener while I
discuss a few details with Miss Lindsey, in the office," he commanded
coolly, ushered Miss Lindsey into the sanctum and softly closed the
door.
</p><p>"Mr. Vandeford," Miss Lindsey began rapidly, "I knew it wasn't fair to
make any definite arrangements with Mr. Farraday, and of course I will
take whatever salary you--"
</p><p>"Where do you live, Miss Lindsey?" Mr. Vandeford interrupted to ask with
a totally unwarranted interest on the part of a manager in the affairs
of an actor he has engaged. Miss Lindsey, for the second time that day,
underpainted her own cheeks and laughed as she answered:
</p><p>"I wouldn't blame you if you didn't believe me, but I also live at the
Y. W. C. A., though I give Mrs. Parkham's as my address for letters and
telephone calls. It's cheap and--and I have done dining-room work there
for a month, waiting--waiting for--for a part in a play."
</p><p>"Great guns, how that hunch works!" exclaimed the well-known producer,
as he sank into his chair from positive weakness. "You take in this
situation, don't you?" he demanded with a quick recovery.
</p><p>"I think I do," answered Miss Lindsey. Then she lifted her big black
eyes, in which shone the psychic hunger, though that of the body had
been appeased. "I've got to make good, Mr. Vandeford, and I'll do
anything you want me to. I've got every right--to live at the Y. W. C.
A., and a right to hand food to--to that child in there. You can trust
me."
</p><p>"I believe I can," Mr. Vandeford answered, after looking at her keenly
for a few seconds with the glance with which he had picked his winners
or failures in the human comedy for many experienced years. "Stop your
dining-room work at the nunnery and see that she has a good time, just
you and she together. I'll send you matin√©e tickets to shows I want her
to see, and Mr. Farraday and I'll look after the other amusement. I want
her to meet only the people I introduce her to, and the Y. W. C. A. is
the best place to live in New York--for her. Understand?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Find out how much money she has."
</p><p>"I know now; she told me. She's got a ticket home, good until October
first, and a hundred dollars to last until--until the royalties come in
from the play. Those royalties have got to come in, too, or her
grandfather--" Miss Lindsey's voice was positively belligerent as she
began to put the situation up to Mr. Vandeford, whose heart, as that of
a theatrical manager, she felt, must be hard by tradition.
</p><p>"Yes, I know all about that. You get what money you want from Mr. Meyers
out there, and fool her about what things cost as much as you can--until
the royalties come in. Let me know when things don't run smoothly for
the two of you. Of course, this is worth money to you and--"
</p><p>"I don't want money for--for--looking after her."
</p><p>"How much did Mr. Farraday offer you for your part?"
</p><p>"He doubled it when he saw that I was--was hungry, but I know a hundred
and twenty-five is right and that's all I expect."
</p><p>"The one-fifty stands. If all goes well I'll see you get your chance on
Broadway this winter. We understand each other now; don't we?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Then get the hat quest going. I'm busy."
</p><p>"Five dollars is her outside limit."
</p><p>"Can't you juggle?"
</p><p>"I'll try, but she's--well, you know what a girl like that is."
</p><p>"Go to it!" With which command Mr. Vandeford led the way into the outer
office. A brief aside put the situation he had just adjusted into the
willing ear of his co-producer, who beamed with satisfaction at the
idea of the joint nesting of these first two theatrical experiences he
had captured at the outset of his quest for adventure in the white
lights. He immediately began counting Miss Lindsey's advance into her
hand, thus giving Mr. Vandeford a word alone with his eminent author,
beside Mr. Adolph Meyers's big window.
</p><p>"Miss Lindsey tells me that she also lives at the Y. W. C. A.," he said
with a curious paternal glow in his solar plexus that he had never
experienced before.
</p><p>"Oh, I'm so glad! I know that is foolish of me, but I am a little
frightened. I don't know anybody in New York except you and her
and--I've never been in a big city before, and only in Louisville a few
times with my aunt. I'll enjoy it if she will take me places and bring
me back and forth to rehearsals," and the gray eyes beamed with relief
and anticipation of being led forth from the Y. W. C. A. into the gay
world by a competent guide. "Can we go to some of the <u>th√® dansants</u> in
the afternoon, and maybe to the Metropolitan and the Aquarium?"
</p><p>"Yes, all those places and more," assented Mr. Vandeford, with a
suppressed smile at the diversity of amusements his charge had planned
in her sallies from the Y. W. C. A. "You see, it is both the duty and
the pleasure of a producer of a play to see that his author has a good
time while in the city." It was a surprise to Mr. Vandeford to find
himself thus stating the case inversely.
</p><p>"Oh, but I mean to work hard to help with 'The Purple Slipper,' so I'll
be too tired to bother you much to take me places. And I know how hard
you work, so don't have me on your mind, will you, please, sir?" The
lifted curl of the black lashes and the reverential note in the soft,
slurring, Blue-grass voice almost upset the staid deference with which
Mr. Vandeford was conversing with the author of his new Hawtry play.
</p><p>"Oh, play producing isn't so hard on the producer and the author, so
we'll have lots of time to frolic," he hastened to assure her, though an
uneasy little pang shot into his heart as he thought of just what befell
the average author at the rehearsals of his or her play, and he took an
additional vow of protection. "Shall I come to take you to dinner and to
a show to-night?"
</p><p>"Oh, I'd love it," she answered, and again the color came up under the
gray eyes. "It would be wonderful to have you show me Broadway the first
time. I could never forget that."
</p><p>Then a thought delivered a blow that laid the producer of "The Purple
Slipper" low. The afternoon was half gone, and there were dozens of
wires that he must manipulate since he had had a change of--heart,
concerning "The Purple Slipper," and dinner-time and evening were the
only hours that some of the most important could be found.
</p><p>"Oh, but I can't ask you to do that," he exclaimed, and for almost the
first time since the day of his graduation he felt color rise up under
his own tanned cheeks. "I have to see the stage director and a lot more
people about some things connected with your play. Still, I can't bear
to have anybody else get that first night on Broadway away from me. I
think it is due me." Being herself entirely sincere, Patricia recognized
the utter sincerity of the distress in the voice of her producer where
any other woman would have been doubtful of the ready excuse coming
immediately after the invitation.
</p><p>"Then I'll just go to bed early and rest up from the trip, so that I can
go with you whenever you get the time to take me. You are working for us
both about the play, and if you had rather I waited for you, that is
only fair," Miss Adair hastened to assure him with a sincerity equal to
his own.
</p><p>"You are one good sport," was the reply that he made her straight from
the shoulder, for the thought of a perfectly beautiful girl going to bed
in the Y. W. C. A. and covering up her head and ears from the bright
lights of her first night in old Manhattan just to give a strange and
reverenced man the pleasure of introducing her to the old city made a
profound impression upon him. "To-morrow night we'll wake up things on
Broadway. I'll telephone you in the morning to let you know how the play
is going and to see if there is anything I can do for you. Now you must
all go and let me get busy."
</p><p>"Yes, this is just about the hour that hats begin to bite well,"
assented Mr. Farraday, as he removed the girls down to his car with no
thought or question as to whether his services would be needed in the
enterprise in which he had embarked with Mr. Vandeford.
</p><p>"Now for it, Pops!" said Mr. Vandeford as the door closed behind his
co-workers in the production of "The Purple Slipper," whose work at that
moment was to play at a distance from his labor. "I'm going to read that
play, and nothing short of something that will injure its prospects if
neglected by me must disturb me. When I'm done I'll make plans with you.
It will take me several hours, and you stand by every second of the
time. Get me?"
</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Vandeford, sir," answered Mr. Adolph Meyers, and he shut his
door into the outer office just as Mr. Vandeford closed his own with a
bang.
</p><p>Then for three hours or more, while the sun sank behind the Palisades
and the white lights flashed up from Broadway beneath his window like
bits of futile challenges to the dying light of day, Mr. Godfrey
Vandeford went through the supreme agony of a long life on Broadway, and
was paid in full for every double-cross he had administered to a
confr√®re. He read "The Purple Slipper" and groaned aloud from page to
page. He began its perusal sitting erect in his chair, and he ended it
hunched over its pages spread on his desk with his head in his hands,
his fingers desperately clutching his shock of gray-sprinkled hair. Then
in a complete collapse he flung himself back in his chair, elevated his
feet to the edge of the desk, and began literally to devour the smoke of
a small black cigar. For half an hour he sat motionless, as was his
habit when fighting all preliminary battles, and his eyes seemed to be
seeing the big old monster city open its thousand gleaming eyes and
change its roar of the day to an incessant purr of a night-stalking
beast, but in reality he was seeing and hearing a month into the future,
and the spectacle thus pre-visioned was the first night of "The Purple
Slipper" on Broadway. Then very suddenly he came back into his conscious
self and went into action. He rang the buzzer for Mr. Adolph Meyers.
</p><p>"Pops, get Grant Howard on the wire and ask him to come around here as
quick as he can make it. If he talks straight wait an hour for him, if
he's thick-tongued go after him yourself. Get him! Now put me on the
wire with Rooney if you can find him, and make appointments with
Lindenberg for scenery at eleven in the morning. Ask Corbett to send an
artist to talk costumes for a period play at eleven-thirty, and have
Gerald Height here at twelve sharp. Don't forget to engage that
good-looking youngster--Leigh, I think is the name--even if you have to
give him a hundred advance. That's all for the present. Get Rooney for
me." Mr. Vandeford turned to his desk and began making rapid notes on a
pad with a huge, black, press pencil. For five minutes he spread his
thoughts upon the paper in great smudges; then his telephone rang, and
he took up the receiver:
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Yes, this is Mr. Vandeford speaking. Hello, Billy!"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"That new Hawtry play is beginning to promise something. I'm delaying it
a week, and I want you to come into it with your sleeves rolled up. We
may make a sure-fire hit of it."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Oh, no, I'll keep right on getting 'The Rosie Posie Girl' in shape, and
shunt Hawtry into it as soon as she cinches the public in this play--or
fails."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"That was just what I was going to hand you--you get four hundred a week
for this show, but you'll have to go in and earn it. It's a departure,
and you may not like it. You'll have to hammer it a lot, but I'm not
signing a single 'Rosie Posie' contract until I see this in shape."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"I mean it. A stage manager has to take my stuff all hot even if he
thinks some of it is cold. Get me?"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"That's good. I'll give you the completed manuscript Saturday so you can
pound and set it for Monday next."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"That's good. By!"
</p><p>With which short, but sure, wire-pulling Mr. Vandeford opened his
campaign to double-cross his own original plans. He had hardly stopped
fixing Mr. William Rooney when Pops looked in upon him and announced Mr.
Grant Howard, the eminent playwright.
</p><p>"Hello, Grant," was Mr. Vandeford's short and unenthusiastic greeting to
the small, black-haired person with weak, pink-rimmed, blue eyes, who
sauntered into the sanctum and dropped sadly into a chair with his back
to the light. A cigarette hung from the left corner of his upper lip,
and his hands trembled. "Been hitting 'em up?"
</p><p>"Yes," answered the playwright, laconically.
</p><p>"Broke?"
</p><p>"Pretty bad."
</p><p>"Want to doctor a play for Hawtry for me by Friday next for a thousand
dollars cash?"
</p><p>"Cash now?"
</p><p>"Cash Friday."
</p><p>"Would have to lock myself up in my apartment to do it; but Mazie's been
crying for gold-uns for a week."
</p><p>"Send Mazie to me, and I'll fix that, and hand you the thousand on
Friday. Here, take this manuscript over in my other office and be ready
to talk it over with me by ten o'clock. I'll see Mazie in the meantime."
Mr. Vandeford placed the precious "Purple Slipper" in the hands of a man
who at that very moment had two successful plays running on Broadway,
his interest in both of which he had sold out for a mess of pottage to
be consumed in the company of Miss Mazie Villines of the "Big Show."
</p><p>"Dolph had better order me up a little cold wine to start on," said Mr.
Howard, as he rose languidly to incarcerate himself at the bidding of
Mr. Vandeford. The same scene had been enacted between the two bright
lights of American drama several times before with very good results.
Mr. Howard's brain was of that peculiar caliber which does not originate
an idea, but which inserts a solid bone construction as well as keen
little sparklets into the fabric of another's labor, and makes the whole
translucent where before it may have been opaque. On Broadway he was
called a play doctor, and Mr. Vandeford was not the first manager who
had shut him up with quarts of refreshment to tinker on the play of many
a literary, dramatic, bright light.
</p><p>"Dolph will give you scotch and soda to your limit, no further,"
answered Mr. Vandeford, without graciousness. "I'll be here waiting for
your talk-over at ten-thirty o'clock."
</p><p>"All right. Have Mazie come for me after her show?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>With which the eminent playwright betook himself to a small private
office which opened into the lair of Mr. Adolph Meyers. After he had
entered that retreat Mr. Meyers softly rose from his typing machine and
as softly locked him in. Then he proceeded to hunt for Miss Mazie
Villines until he got her into conversational connection with Mr.
Vandeford. They conversed in these words with great cordiality:
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Want to earn a nice little two hundred for keeping Grant Howard working
at doctoring a play by next Friday for me?"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"I'm giving him a thousand if it's delivered Friday."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Two hundred to you."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Not three!"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"There's Claire Furniss. Grant had her at supper last night at Rector's.
She's a beauty, you know."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Two fifty."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Goes!"
</p><p> . . . . . .
</p><p>"Good! Come get him here at my office at eleven-fifteen. Get a taxi by
the hour at your stage-door--on me--and come by for him."
</p><p>. . . . . .
</p><p>"Good girl! By!"
</p><hr/>
<p>"What a life!" Mr. Vandeford muttered to himself, then rang his buzzer
for Mr. Adolph Meyers.
</p><p>"Pops, it's eight o'clock. Go get us a couple of slabs of pie at the
automat, and then I'll go over to see Breit at the booking office."
</p><p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Vandeford," Mr. Meyers acquiesced, and departed in search
of provender for the lion and himself. Left to himself, Mr. Vandeford
fell into another trance, from which he was dragged by another tinkle of
his telephone.
</p><p>"There'll be a wireless to my grave," he muttered as he took down the
receiver and snapped into it:
</p><p>"This is Mr. Vandeford talking."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Oh, Miss Adair. Anything the matter?"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Speak a little closer into the phone. Miss Hawtry has asked you to
supper to-night? Mr. Farraday? And myself?"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Did she say I was to come for you?"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Do you know, I feel like a brute, but I'm going to tell you to go to
bed as per promise. I've got two big guns from Broadway putting licks on
the production of 'The Purple Slipper' until the small hours to-night,
right here in the office. I'll tell Miss Hawtry about it, and you
can--go to bed."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Oh, yes, she'll understand. It's her play too, you see."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"No, you can't help me to-night, thank you just the same. How's Miss
Lindsey? Would you like me to send my car to take you girls for a little
spin in the park to cool off before you go to bed?"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Her hair's wet? And so is yours? I didn't know it was raining."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Oh, a mutual shampoo? Bless you both!"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"No, you don't interrupt me when you call me. You are to call me any
time you are willing to do it, if it is every five minutes."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"No, I mean it."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Very well then--good-night and good dreams."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Can you beat it?" Mr. Vandeford smiled to himself as he hung up the
receiver. "Those two peachy girls washing each other's hair in the Y. W.
C. A., within ten blocks of the 'Follies' is to laugh--or cry. Good
little Lindsey! I wager she could have got 'em both forty-seven-eleven
dates." Then a thought delivered a blow just above his belt in the
region of his heart. "So it's Violet's game to use her as a decoy-duck
for Denny?" he questioned himself, then gave his own answer in a soft
voice under his breath. "Damn her!"
</p><p>Furthermore he did not communicate with Miss Hawtry to give her Miss
Adair's answer to her invitation. He answered it in person, but only
after much had happened in the three hours intervening.
</p><p>The hours from eight to nearly ten Mr. Vandeford spent in slowly
munching the refreshment retrieved from the automat by Mr. Adolph Meyers
and thinking out loud to that dignitary who took down his thoughts on
paper in cabalistic signs of shorthand. They were all notes of what
could and must be done in the next few days in the fight for the good
fate of "The Purple Slipper."
</p><p>"I want to see that fellow Reid about that new lighting he provided for
the new Sauls show in May. I liked it in some ways and--" Mr. Vandeford
was saying when a banging on the door of the private office in which was
incarcerated the eminent playwright interrupted him.
</p><p>"Did you give him the right amount of booze, Pops?" Mr. Vandeford asked.
</p><p>"Entirely right," answered Mr. Meyers, with his pencil still poised over
his pad. The knocking continued.
</p><p>"See what he wants, Pops, and give him a little more if you have to,"
decided Mr. Vandeford, as he lit a new cigar and turned to the whirlpool
of his desk while he waited for Mr. Meyers's return.
</p><p>"Say, do you expect me to cast a Sunday School charade into a play in
six days, Vandeford?" was the storm of words hurled at him as the
released and infuriated doctor of plays hurled himself and his sheaf of
manuscript into the door ahead of Mr. Meyers.
</p><p>"Is that what you think of it?" calmly questioned Mr. Vandeford, as he
swung around in his chair. "Sit down and tell me what you intend to do
for it."
</p><p>"I'm going to rewrite the whole blamed mess for fifteen hundred dollars,
that's what I'm going to do," announced Mr. Howard with both
belligerence and excitement in his voice and in the flash of his sick
little eyes.
</p><p>"Is it as good--or as bad--as all that--money?" questioned Mr.
Vandeford. "You'll have to show me," he added calmly, though in the
vitals of his heart he was relieved that Howard still spoke of "The
Purple Slipper" as a carcass on which to operate.
</p><p>"It's got a perfectly ripping, basic, sex-comedy idea that climaxes the
third act; the rest is piffle."
</p><p>"I thought some of the character drawing, and one or two of the
sentimental bits were--actable," Mr. Vandeford ventured, determined to
save as much of the hair and hide of Miss Adair's child as possible,
enough at least to help her to recognize and claim it later.
</p><p>"Oh, we can leave enough bits to anchor the author's name, if that is
what you mean," the playwright admitted impatiently. "How about fifteen
hundred? I won't do it for less."
</p><p>"Goes," answered Mr. Vandeford, with the greatest ease with which he had
ever dispensed five hundred dollars in all his life. "Now shoot me your
layout of the whole thing before Mazie gets here to take you and lock
you up."
</p><p>"I'm going to take that dinner scene where the wife holds her husband's
enemies and her lover at bay to see if he gets back home on a
sporting-chance bet with lover, and write Hawtry both back and front of
it; write her in as the virago she is and give her a chance to act
herself for once."
</p><p>"Good idea," admitted Mr. Vandeford. "But you'll have a hard time
writing a gutter girl into a grand dame, won't you?"
</p><p>"Women are all alike, and the worst viragos are the grand dames. It
takes a gutter girl to play one let loose, as they do only on rare
occasions. I've got 'em in my own family. That's the reason I'm a black
sheep turned out. Got a sister that's worse than me, only respectable
and fashionable. See?"
</p><p>"Yes, I see," again admitted Mr. Vandeford. "You'll keep all the
atmosphere and minor stabs in, you say?"
</p><p>"Sure. They are pretty good staggers, some of the minor stuff. Lots of
it is good talk--only wandering. That woman may write something some day
if she breaks loose and goes to the devil for a while."
</p><p>"She won't," said Mr. Vandeford, positively.
</p><p>"Never can tell," answered Mr. Howard, with indifference. "What did
Mazie say?"
</p><p>"She's due here for you now," answered Mr. Vandeford, looking at his
watch.
</p><p>"Great girl, Mazie. Cooks me dandy rice and runny eggs, and sits on the
neck of every bottle in New York while I dig. Couldn't do without her.
Say, tell her you are just giving me five hundred, will you?"
</p><p>"She knows it's a thousand," answered Mr. Vandeford, truthfully. "But
I'll keep the extra five hundred you are extracting dark for you."
</p><p>"That's good, and I'll tell her that I haven't got any--"
</p><p>"Tell her that you haven't got any money, as usual," were the words
which Mr. Howard's fair lion-tamer used to finish his sentence of appeal
to Mr. Vandeford for his co-operation in fraud. She had entered past Mr.
Meyers with his full approval, for he felt a great relief at the sight
of her and her guardianship.
</p><p>"How's Mazie?" asked Mr. Vandeford, as he rose and, with all the
ceremony he would have used for a grand duchess--or Miss Patricia
Adair--offered a chair to the pert little person with her funny,
good-humored, rather pretty face and her very smart clothes.
</p><p>"Kicking along, Mr. Vandeford, thank you," was the answer. "Gee, but I
did kick the limit to-night, that's sure. I put some shady shines over
what Grant wrote into a let-down in my part for me last night in great
shape. They et it up, darling." Her naughty face beamed on Howard.
"Hawtry was in a box, left. Had a gink in soup to fish with her that
looked like real money. Have you rented her out?"
</p><p>"You folks get along and stop that taxi meter you've got running on me,"
Mr. Vandeford said, answering the sally with a laugh; but it surprised
him that there was a cold space in his vitals at the insult that the
little trollop handed him with such comradery, guiltless of any
knowledge that it was an insult.
</p><p>"What was that about touching pitch?" he asked himself as he walked
rapidly up four blocks to the theater where Mazie had told him he would
find the Violet with her prey. He was just in time to meet them in the
lobby. Denny was in the gorgeousness of his "soup to fish," Mazie's and
her world's term for evening attire, and the Violet in every way matched
his good looks.
</p><p>"Why, where is Mademoiselle Innocence?" asked Hawtry, with a little
frown, as she perceived that Mr. Vandeford was alone and not in regalia.
</p><p>"Asleep at the Y. W. C. A.," he answered shortly.
</p><p>"Sure?" asked the Violet, with a little laugh for which he could have
killed her.
</p><p>"Why, she promised Miss Hawtry to go to supper with us and see a
midnight show," Mr. Farraday exclaimed, and there was disappointment in
his voice as he looked at Mr. Vandeford.
</p><p>"I couldn't get away from the office until just this minute, and I
didn't think I could get away this soon. Miss Adair sent her apologies
to you both, and I came over to bring them."
</p><p>"Evidently we are not to be trusted with the author, Mr. Farraday,"
laughed Violet, with what good Dennis took as good nature and what Mr.
Vandeford knew to be rage.
</p><p>"Well, bless the child and her beauty sleep, but don't let that kill our
evening joy. Come along, Van, and we'll go some place sufficiently
disreputable to admit a crumpled person like yourself if you wash your
hands. We can have a good powwow over the play. I want to know what you
have been doing while I was off the job chasing a hat for the author."
And the big, stupid Jonathan linked his arm in that of his anxious and
hovering David and drew him along towards the Surrenese, which stood
across the street, at the same time guiding the steps of the Violet's
satin slippers in that direction.
</p><p>While the three walked across the narrow street Mr. Vandeford made some
rapid calculations and a decision in his mind. He saw plainly that he
could not undertake to guard Mr. Dennis Farraday from the Violet and at
the same time fend Miss Patricia Adair from her wiles. He'd have to
choose between them, and in the twinkling of an eye he chose Patricia.
It is said that there is a love between men "that passes the love of
women," but nobody has ever witnessed it.
</p><p>"You people go on to your show--I'm all in," he capitulated as they
stood beside Mr. Farraday's car; and the heart of the Violet rejoiced
within her.
</p><p>"I'm sure Miss Adair is getting caught up on sleep so she can go with
you to-morrow night. She's a perfect dear, and we'll put her play
across," Hawtry cooed to him in her rich voice, and he knew that she
felt she had struck his price and bought him off.
</p><p>"If Denny falls for her he'll fall far; but I can't help it. A girl's a
girl, specially from the country," Mr. Vandeford said to himself, as he
stood and watched them drive away into the white-lighted ca√±on of
Broadway. Then he went home and to bed.
</p><p>A man may put out his night light, stretch himself between his sheets
with the perfection of fatigue and still not sleep. There are various
combinations of reasons that prevent his slumber. Mr. Godfrey Vandeford
was still awake when Mr. Dennis Farraday let himself into his apartment
with a key that had been presented to him five years before when Mr.
Vandeford had installed his Lares and Penates in the tall building on
Seventy-third Street, some of these Lares and Penates being Mr.
Farraday's extra linen and clothes.
</p><p>"That you, Denny?" Mr. Vandeford asked as he switched on his light and
took a hurried glance at a clock on his mantel which registered the hour
of 2 A. M.
</p><p>"Yes," answered Mr. Farraday, as he came to the door of Mr. Vandeford's
sleeping apartment. "A thought suddenly struck me, and I stopped in to
explode it at you and sleep here."
</p><p>"Fire away!"
</p><p>"My mater is coming to town the first of the week to have her glasses
changed, and I'm going to telephone out to her to-morrow and ask her to
write Miss Adair to have dinner with us informally at the town house
while she is here. You know mater's mother was from old Kentucky, and
she'll adore the child. Think that's good thinking?"
</p><p>"Fine," answered Mr. Vandeford, with a glow under his ribs about which
he said nothing. Men are vastly inarticulate, but they have various
means of communication, and Mr. Vandeford now felt that in his care of
his author Mr. Dennis Farraday would understand.
</p><p>"You know I am on new ground, old chap, but--but how about asking Miss
Lindsey, too?" Mr. Farraday questioned, with great diffidence.
</p><p>"Fine!" agreed Mr. Vandeford, with accelerated glow under his ribs that
Miss Lindsey had been proposed when Miss Hawtry might have been invited.
"Get to bed, can't you, you Indian, you? Night!"
</p><p>"Good-night!" answered Mr. Farraday, as he departed to his own room.
</p><p>And still Mr. Vandeford did not sleep.
</p><p>Flat upon his back he lay and faced, analyzed, and card-indexed his
situation and himself.
</p><p>"Five years of myself given to that gutter girl and I never even cared;
let her annex me for purposes of parade and publicity, and thought it
funny sport. Wasted? Something to be deducted for pleasure in artistic
success of "Dear Geraldine," but what will it cost me if I have to stand
by and see her make old Denny hate himself as I do myself, or worse?
She'll not stop short with him, and how do I know what he'll do? The
money don't matter, but the--cleanliness does. If I go in to save him,
she gave me notice to-night that she would go for that gray-eyed girl.
What can she do to her? First, kill her play, no matter what I do to
build up a success for the kiddie to cancel that mortgage. Second: do
something, say something that will kill that look in those gray eyes
when they lift to me. Never! Take Denny, Violet, and the Lord help him;
I can't. You've bought me. Washing her hair in the Y. W. C. A.! God
bless that institution and--"
</p><p>At last Mr. Godfrey Vandeford slept.
</p><p>After his ten o'clock awakening Mr. Vandeford displayed a marked
eccentricity in his demeanor. That morning was unlike any morning he had
ever experienced, and his conduct surprised himself. A daybreak shower
had fallen on the hot and baked city, and it was as fresh as a suburb.
Arrayed in the coolest of white silk, linen, and suede, Mr. Vandeford
had his chauffeur drive him not to the whirling office but to the most
sophisticated Fifth Avenue florist, where he purchased the most
unsophisticated bunch of flowers at the highest price to be obtained in
New York.
</p><p>"The Young Women's Christian Association," he commanded the obsequious
young Valentine who drove the big Chambers. Mr. Vandeford was never
sufficiently unoccupied of mind to pilot a car in and out of New York
traffic. For half a second the young Frenchman hesitated.
</p><p>"I don't know where it is--Find out," commanded Mr. Vandeford, and again
he had the foreign experience of feeling the blood burn the under side
of the tan on his cheeks.
</p><p>Valentine consulted the tall man in uniform at the door of the flower
shop, and this menial consulted some one within, who must have consulted
a directory, judging from the time it took to obtain the correct
address. With his eyes straight in front of him, as a chauffeur's eyes
should always be, he then drove rapidly down the avenue.
</p><p>And on that beautiful morning Mr. Vandeford's luck was with him.
Valentine whirled expertly up to the curb in front of the large,
hospitable building which had emblazoned over its door the impressive Y.
W. C. A. letters, letters that send a beacon all over the known world as
they did to Mr. Vandeford in little and unimportant New York. Mr.
Vandeford got out of the car with hurried grace in his long limbs and,
with actual trepidation, went in through the door, into a world he had
never even thought of before. He had entered many an African lion jungle
with less fear. He glanced with awe at the natty young woman in white
linen who presided at the desk, and wanted intensely to put his flowers
behind him and back out of the door rather than approach and ask for the
lady to whom he wished to donate them. In fact, he might have
accomplished such a retreat if again luck had not come his way.
</p><p>"Oh, Mr. Vandeford, how glad I am that you got here before we went out
to the museum," exclaimed a fluty, slurring young voice just behind him,
and he found that the gray eyes with the black lashes were just as
unusual as he had decided they could not possibly be in the interval
that had elapsed since he had looked into them. "Oh, how lovely!"
</p><p>The last exclamation was made over the edge of the bouquet, which he had
tendered Miss Adair as silently as a school-boy hands out his first
bunch of buttercups to the lady for whom he has picked them.
</p><p>"Did you come for me to go to help work on the play?" was the energetic
question that brought him out of his trance.
</p><p>"No, not right now," he answered haltingly, and when he realized how
many times he would have to put her off with words to that same effect,
his trance became a panic.
</p><p>"When are you going to need me?" Miss Adair asked him with a direct and
business-like look right to his eyes. "I am ready for work now."
</p><p>"Now what'll I do?" he demanded of himself.
