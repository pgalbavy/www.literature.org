<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Don Balthasar accepted my presence without a question. Perhaps
he fancied he had invited me; of my manner of coming he was ignorant,
of course. O'Brien, who had gone on to Havana in the ship which
had landed the Riegos in Rio Medio, gave no sign of life. And
yet, on the arrival of the <em>Breeze</em>, he must have found
out I was no longer on board. I forgot the danger suspended over
my head. For a fortnight I lived as if in a dream.</p>

<p>"What is the action you want me to take, Carlos?"</p>

<p>I asked one day.</p>

<p>Propped up with pillows, he looked at me with the big eyes of
his emaciation.</p>

<p>"I would like best to see you marry my cousin. Once before a
woman of our race had married an Englishman. She had been happy.
English things last forever &mdash;English peace, English power,
English fidelity. It is a country of much serenity, of order,
of stable affection. . . ."</p>

<p>His voice was very weak and full of faith. I remained silent,
overwhelmed at this secret of my innermost heart, voiced by his
bloodless lips&mdash;as if a dream had come to pass, as if a miracle
had taken place. He added, with an indefinable smile of an almost
unearthly wistfulness:</p>

<p>"I would have married your sister, my Juan."</p>

<p>He had on him the glamour of things English&mdash;of English power
emerging from the dust of wars and revolution; of England stable
and undismayed, like a strong man who had kept his feet in the
tottering of secular edifices shaken to their foundations by an
earthquake. It was as if for him that were something fine, something
romantic, just as for me romance had always seemed to be embodied
in his features, in his glance, and to live in the air he breathed.
On the other side of the bed the old Don, lost in a high-backed
armchair, remained plunged in that meditation of the old which
resembles sleep, as sleep resembles death. The priest, lighted
up by the narrow, bright streak of the window, was reading his
breviary through a pair of enormous spectacles. The white coif
of the nun hovered in distant corners of the room.</p>

<p>We were constantly talking of O'Brien. He was the only subject
of all our conversations; and when Carlos inveighed against the
Intendente, the old Don nodded sadly in his chair. He was dishonouring
the name of the Riegos, Carlos would exclaim feebly, turning his
head towards his uncle. His uncle's own province, the name of
his own town, stood for a refuge of the scum of the Antilles.
It wras a shameful sanctuary. Every ruffian, rascal, murderer,
and thief of the West Indies had come to think of this ancient
and honourable town as a safe haven.</p>

<p>I myself could very well remember the Jamaica household expression,
"The Rio Medio piracies," and all these paragraphs in the home
papers that reached us a month old headed, "The Activity of the
So-called Mexican Privateers," and urging upon our Government
the necessity of energetic remonstrances in Madrid. "The fact,
incredible as it may appear," said the writers, "seeming to be
that the nest of these Picaroons is actually within the loyal
dominions of the Spanish Crown." If Spain, our press said, resented
our recognition of South American independence, let it do so openly,
not by countenancing criminals. It was unworthy of a great nation.
"Our West Indian trade is being stabbed in the back," declaimed
the <em>Bristol Mirror</em>. "Where is our fleet?" it asked. "If
the Cuban authorities are unable or unwilling, let us take the
matter in our own hands."</p>

<p>There was a great deal of mystery about this peculiar outbreak
of lawlessness that seemed to be directed so pointedly against
the British trade. The town of Rio Medio was alluded to as one
of the unapproachable towns of the earth&mdash;closed, like the capital
of Prester John to the travellers, or Mecca to the infidels. Nobody
I ever met in Jamaica had set eyes on the place. The impression
prevailed that no stranger could come out of it alive. Incredible
stories were told of it in the island, and indignation at its
existence grew at home and in the colonies.</p>

<p>Admiral Rowley, an old fighter, grown a bit lazy, no diplomatist
(the stories of his being venal, I take it, were simply abominable
calumnies), unable to get anything out of the Cuban authorities
but promises and lofty protestations, had made up his mind, under
direct pressure from home, to take matters into his own hands.
His boat attack had been a half-and-half affair, for all that.
He intended, he had said, to go to the bottom of the thing, and
find out what there was in the place; but he could not believe
that anybody would dare offer resistance to the boats of an English
squadron. They were sent in as if for an exploration rather than
for an armed landing.</p>

<p>It ended in a disaster, and a sense of wonder had been added
to the mystery of the fabulous Rio Medio organization. The Cuban
authorities protested against the warlike operations attempted
in a friendly country; at the same time, they had delivered the
seven pirates&mdash;the men whom I saw hanged in Kingston. And Rowley
was recalled home in disgrace.</p>

<p>It was my extraordinary fate to penetrate into this holy city
of the last organized piracy the world would ever know. I beheld
it with my eyes; I had stood on the point behind the very battery
of guns which had swept Rowley's boats out of existence.</p>

<p>The narrow entrance faced, across the water, the great portal
of the cathedral. Rio Medio had been a place of some splendour
in its time. The ruinous heavy buildings clung to the hillsides,
and my eyes plunged into a broad vista of an empty and magnificent
street. Behind many of the imposing and escutcheoned frontages
there was nothing but heaps of rubble; the footsteps of rare passers-by
woke lonely echoes, and strips of grass outlined in parallelograms
the flagstones of the roadway. The Casa Riego raised its buttressed
and loop-holed bulk near the shore, resembling a defensive outwork;
on my other hand the shallow bay, vast, placid, and shining, extended
itself behind the strip of coast like an enormous lagoon. The
fronds of palm-clusters dotted the beach over the glassy shimmer
of the far distance. The dark and wooded slopes of the hills closed
the view inland on every side.</p>

<p>Under the palms the green masses of vegetation concealed the
hovels of the rabble. There were three so-called 'villages' at
the bottom of the bay; and that good Catholic and terrible man,
Se√±or Juez O'Brien, could with a simple nod send every man in
them to the gallows.</p>

<p>The respectable population of Rio Medio, leading a cloistered
existence in the ruins of old splendour, used to call that thievish
rabble <em>Lugarenos</em>&mdash;villagers. They were sea-thieves, but
they were dangerous. At night, from these clusters of hovels surrounded
by the banana plantations, there issued a villainous noise, the
humming of hived scoundrels. Lights twinkled. One could hear the
thin twanging of guitars, uproarious songs, all the sounds of
their drinking, singing, gambling, quarrelling, love-making, squalor.
Sometimes the long shriek of a woman rent the air, or shouting
tumults rose and subsided; while, on the other side of the cathedral,
the houses of the past, the houses without life, showed no light
and made no sound.</p>

<p>There would be no strollers on the beach in the daytime; the
masts of the two schooners (bought in the United States by O'Brien
to make war with on the British Empire) appeared like slender
sticks far away up the empty stretch of water; and that gathering
of ruffians, thieves, murderers, and runaway slaves slept in their
noisome dens. Their habits were obscene and nocturnal. Cruel without
hardihood, and greedy without courage, they were no skull-and-crossbones
pirates of the old kind, that, under the black flag, neither gave
nor expected quarter. Their usual practice was to hang in rowboats
round some unfortunate ship becalmed in sight of their coast,
like a troop of vultures hopping about the carcass of a dead buffalo
on a plain. When they judged the thing was fairly safe, they would
attack with a great noise and show of ferocity; do some hasty
looting amongst the cargo; break into the cabins for watches,
wearing apparel, and so on; perpetrate at times some atrocity,
such as singeing the soles of some poor devil of a ship-master,
when they had positive information (from such affiliated helpers
as Ramon, the storekeeper in Jamaica) that there was coined money
concealed on board; and take themselves off to their sordid revels
on shore, and to hold auctions of looted property on the beach.
These Were attended by people from the interior of the province,
and now and then even the Havana dealers would come on the quiet
to secure a few pieces of silk or a cask or two of French wine.
Tomas Castro could not mention them without spitting in sign of
contempt. And it was with that base crew that O'Brien imagined
himself to be making war on the British Empire!</p>

<p>In the time of Nichols it did look as if they were really becoming
enterprising. They had actually chased and boarded ships sixty
miles out at sea. It seems he had inspired them with audacity
by means of kicks, blows, and threats of instant death, after
the manner of Bluenose sailors. His long limbs, the cadaverous
and menacing aspect, the strange nasal ferocity of tone, something
mocking and desperate in his aspect, had persuaded them that this
unique sort of heretic was literally in league with the devil.
He had been the most efficient of the successive leaders O'Brien
had imported to give some sort of effect to his warlike operations.
I laugh and wonder as I write these words; but the man did look
upon it as a war and nothing else. What he had had the audacity
to propose to me had been treason, not thieving. It had a glamour
for him which, he supposed, a Separationist (as I had the reputation
of being) could not fail to see. He was thinking of enlarging
his activity, of getting really in touch with the Mexican Junta
of rebels. As he had said, he needed a gentleman now. These were
Carlos' surmises.</p>

<p>Before Nichols there had been a rather bloodthirsty Frenchman,
but he got himself stabbed in an <em>aguardiente</em> shop for
blaspheming the Virgin. Nichols, as far as I could understand,
had really grown scared at O'Brien's success in repulsing Rowley's
boats; he had mysteriously disappeared, and neither of the two
schooners had been out till the day of my kidnapping, when Castro,
by order of Carlos, had taken the command. The freebooters of
Rio Medio had returned to their cautious and petty pilfering in
boats, from such unlucky ships as the chance of the weather had
delivered into their hands. I heard, also, during my walks with
Castro (he attended me wrapped in his cloak, and with two pistols
in his belt), that there were great jealousies and bickerings
amongst that base populace. They were divided into two parties.
For instance, the rascals living in the easternmost village accepted
tacitly the leadership of a certain Domingo, a mulatto, keeper
of a vile grogshop, who was skilled in the art of throwing a knife
to a great distance. Man-uel-del-Popolo, the extraordinary <em>improvisador</em>
with the guitar, was an aspirant for power with a certain following
of his own. Words could not express Castro's scorn for these fellows.
<em>Ladrones!</em> vermin of the earth, scum of the sea, he called
them.</p>

<p>His position, of course, was exceptional. A dependent of the
Riegos, a familiar of the Casa, he was infinitely removed from
a Domingo or a Manuel. He lived soberly, like a Spaniard, in some
hut in the nearest of the villages, with an old woman who swept
the earth floor and cooked his food at an outside fire&mdash;his <em>puchero</em>
and <em>tortillas</em>&mdash;and rolled for him his provision of cigarettes
for the day. Every morning he marched up to the Casa, like a courtier,
to attend on his king. I never saw him eat or drink anything there.
He leaned a shoulder against the wall, or sat on the floor of
the gallery with his short legs stretched out near the big mahogany
door of Carlos' room, with many cigarettes stuck behind his ears
and in the band of his hat. When these were gone he grubbed for
more in the depths of his clothing, somewhere near his skin. Puffs
of smoke issued from his pursed lips; and the desolation of his
pose, the sorrow of his round, wrinkled face, was so great that
it seemed were he to cease smoking, he would die of grief.</p>

<p>The general effect of the place was of vitality exhausted, of
a body calcined, of romance turned into stone. The still air,
the hot sunshine, the white beach curving around the deserted
sheet of water, the sombre green of the hills, had the motionlessness
of things petrified, the vividness of things painted, the sadness
of things abandoned, desecrated. And, as if alone intrusted with
the guardianship of life's sacred fire, I was moving amongst them,
nursing my love for Sera-phina. The words of Carlos were like
oil upon a flame; it enveloped me from head to foot with a leap.
I had the physical sensation of breathing it, of seeing it, of
being at the same time driven on and restrained. One moment I
strode blindly over the sand, the next I stood still; and Castro,
coming up panting, would remark from behind that, on such a hot
day as this, it was a shame to disturb even a dog sleeping in
the shade. I had the feeling of absolute absorption into one idea.
I was ravaged by a thought. It was as if I had never before imagined,
heard spoken of, or seen a woman.</p>

<p>It was true. She was a revelation to my eye and my ear, as much
as to my heart and mind. Indeed, I seemed never before to have
seen a woman. Whom had I seen? Veronica? We had been too poor,
and my mother too proud, to keep up a social intercourse with
our neighbours; the village girls had been devoid of even the
most rustic kind of charm; the people were too poor to be handsome.
I had never been tempted to look at a woman's face; and the manner
of my going from home is known. In Jamaica, sharing with an exaggerated
loyalty the unpopularity of the Mac-donalds, I had led a lonely
life; for I had no taste for their friends' society, and the others,
after a time, would have nothing to do with me. I had made a sort
of hermitage for myself out of a house in a distant plantation,
and sometimes I would see no white face for whole weeks together.
She was the first woman to me&mdash;a strange new being, a marvel as
great as Eve herself to Adam's wondering awakening.</p>

<p>It may be that a close intimacy stands in the way of love springing
up between two young people, but in our case it was different.
My passion seemed to spring from our understanding, because the
understanding was in the face of danger. We were like two people
in a slowly sinking ship; the feeling of the abyss under our feet
was our bond, not the real comprehension of each other. Apart
from that, she remained to me always unattainable and romantic?&mdash;unique,
with all the unexpressed promises of love such as no world had
ever known. And naturally, because for me, hitherto, the world
had held no woman. She was an apparition of dreams&mdash;the girl with
the lizard, the girl with the dagger, a wonder to stretch out
my hands to from afar; and yet I was permitted to whisper intimately
to this my dream, to this vision. We had to put our heads close
together, talking of the enemy and of the shadow over the house;
while under our eyes Carlos waited for death, made cruel by his
anxieties, and the old Don walked in the darkness of his accumulated
years.</p>

<p>As to me, what was I to her?</p>

<p>Carlos, in a weak voice, and holding her hand with a feeble and
tenacious grasp, had told her repeatedly that the English cousin
was ready to offer up his life to her happiness in this world.
Many a time she would turn her glance upon me&mdash;not a grateful
glance, but, as it were, searching and pensive&mdash;a glance of penetrating
candour, a young girl's glance, that, by its very trustfulness,
seems to look one through and through.</p>

<p>And then the sense of my unworthiness made me long for her love
as a sinner, in his weakness, longs for the saving grace.</p>

<p>"Our English cousin is worthy of his great nation. He is very
brave, and very chivalrous to a poor girl," she would say softly.</p>

<p>One day, I remember, going out of Carlos' room, she had just
paused on the threshold for an almost imperceptible moment, the
time to murmur, with feeling, "May Heaven reward you, Don Juan."
This sound, faint and enchanting, like a breath of sweet wind,
staggered me. Castro, sitting outside as usual, had scrambled
to his feet and stood by, hat in hand, his head bent slightly
with saturnine deference. She smiled at him. I think she felt
kindly towards the tubby little bandit of a fellow. After all,
there was something touching and pathetic in his mournful vigil
at the door of our radiant Carlos. I could have embraced that
figure of grotesque and truculent devotion. Had she not smiled
upon him?</p>

<p>The rest of that memorable day I spent in a state of delightful
distraction, as if I had been ravished into the seventh heaven,
and feared to be cast out again presently, as my unworthiness
deserved. What if it were possible, after all?&mdash;this, what Carlos
wished, what he had said. The heavens shook; the constellations
above the court of Casa Riego trembled at the thought.</p>

<p>Carlos fought valiantly. There were days when his courage seemed
to drive the grim presence out of the chamber, where Father Antonio
with his breviary, and the white coif of the nun, seemed the only
reminders of illness and mortality. Sometimes his voice was very
strong, and a sort of hopefulness lighted his wasted features.
Don Balthasar paid many visits to his nephew in the course of
each day. He sat apparently attentive, and nodding at the name
of O'Brien. Then Carlos would talk against O'Brien from amongst
his pillows as if inspired, till the old man, striking the floor
with his gold-headed cane, would exclaim, in a quavering voice,
that he, alone, had made him, had raised him up from the dust,
and could abase him to the dust again. He would instantly go to
Havana; orders would be given to Cesar for the journey this very
moment. He would then take a pinch of snuff with shaky energy,
and lean back in the armchair. Carlos would whisper to me, "He
will never leave the Casa again," and an air of solemn, brooding
helplessness would fall upon the funereal magnificence of the
room. Presently we would hear the old Don muttering dotingly to
himself the name of Seraphina's mother, the young wife of his
old days, so saintly, and snatched away from him in punishment
of his early sinfulness. It was impossible that she should have
been deceived in Don Patricio (O'Brien's Christian name was Patrick).
The intendente was a man of great intelligence, and full of reverence
for her memory. Don Balthasar admitted that he himself was growing
old; and, besides, there was that sorrow of his life. . . . He
had been fortunate in his affliction to have a man of his worth
by his side. There might have been slight irregularities, faults
of youth (O'Brien was five-and-forty if a day). The archbishop
himself was edified by the life of the upright judge&mdash;all Havana,
all the island. The intendente's great zeal for the House might
have led him into an indiscretion or two. So many years now, so
many years. A noble himself. Had we heard of an Irish king? A
king . . . king... he could not recall the name at present. It
might be well to hear what a man of such abilities had to say
for himself.</p>

<p>Carlos and I looked at each other silently. "And his life hangs
on a thread," whispered the dying man with something like despair.</p>

<p>The crisis of all these years of plotting would come the moment
the old Don closed his eyes. Meantime, why was it that O'Brien
did not show himself in Rio Medio? What was it that kept him in
Havana?</p>

<p>"Already I do not count, my Juan," Carlos would say. "And he
prepares all things for the day of my uncle's death."</p>

<p>The dark ways of that man were inscrutable. He must have known,
of course, that I was in Rio Medio. His presence was to be feared,
and his absence itself was growing formidable.</p>

<p>"But what do you think he will do? How do you think he will act?"
I would ask, a little bewildered by my responsibility.</p>

<p>Carlos could not tell precisely. It was not till some time after
his arrival from Europe that he became clearly aware of all the
extent of that man's ambition. At the same time, he had realized
all his power. That man aimed at nothing less than the whole Riego
fortune, and, of course, through Seraphina. I would feel a rage
at this&mdash;a sort of rage that made my head spin as if the ground
had reeled. "He would have found means of getting rid of me if
he had not seen I was not long for this world," Carlos would say.
He had gained an unlimited ascendency over his uncle's mind; he
had made a solitude round this solemn dotage in which ended so
much power, a great reputation, a stormy life of romance and passion&mdash;so
picturesque and excessive even in his old man's love, whose after-effect,
as though the work of a Nemesis resenting so much brilliance,
was casting a shadow upon the fate of his daughter.</p>

<p>Small, fair, plump, concealing his Irish vivacity of intelligence
under the taciturn gravity of a Spanish lawyer, and backed by
the influence of two noble houses, O'Brien had attained to a remarkable
reputation of sagacity and unstained honesty. Hand in glove with
the clergy, one of the judges of the Marine Court, procurator
to the cathedral chapter, he had known how to make himself so
necessary to the highest in the land that everybody but the very
highest looked upon him with fear. His occult influence was altogether
out of proportion to his official position. His plans were carried
out with an unswerving tenacity of purpose. Carlos believed him
capable of anything but a vulgar peculation. He had been reduced
to observe his action quietly, hampered by the weakness of ill-health.
As an instance of O'Brien's methods, he related to me the manner
in which, faithful to his purpose of making a solitude about the
Riegos, he had contrived to prevent overtures for an alliance
from the Salazar family. The young man Don Vincente himself was
impossible, an evil liver, Carlos said, of dissolute habits. Still,
to have even that shadow of a rival out of the way, O'Brien took
advantage of a sanguinary affray between that man and one of his
boon companions about some famous guitar-player girl. The encounter
having taken place under the wall of a convent, O'Brien had contrived
to keep Don Vincente in prison ever since&mdash;not on a charge of
murder (which for a young man of that quality would have been
a comparatively venial offence), but of sacrilege. The Salazars
were a powerful family, but he was strong enough to risk their
enmity. "Imagine that, Juan!" Carlos would exclaim, closing his
eyes. What had caused him the greatest uneasiness was the knowledge
that Don Balthasar had been induced lately to write some letter
to the archbishop in Havana. Carlos was afraid it was simply an
expression of affection and unbounded trust in his intendente,
practically dictated to the old man by O'Brien. "Do you not see,
Juan, how such a letter would strengthen his case, should he ask
the guardians for Seraphina's hand?" And perhaps he was appointed
one of the guardians himself. It was impossible to know what,
were the testamentary dispositions; Father Antonio, who had learned
many things in the confessional, could tell us nothing, but, when
the matter was mentioned, only rolled his eyes up to heaven in
an alarming manner. It was startling to think of all the unholy
forces awakened by the temptation of Seraphina's helplessness
and her immense fortune. Incorruptible himself, that man knew
how to corrupt others. There might have been combined in one dark
intrigue the covetousness of religious orders, the avarice of
high officials &mdash;God knows what conspiracy&mdash;to help O'Brien's
ambition, his passions. He could make himself necessary; he could
bribe; he could frighten; he was able to make use of the highest
in the land and of the lowest, from the present Captain-General
to the <em>Lugarenos</em>. In Havana he had for him the reigning
powers; in Rio Medio the lowest outcasts of the island.</p>

<p>This last was the most dangerous aspect of his power for us,
and also his weakest point. This was the touch of something fanciful
and imaginative; a certain grim childishness in the idea of making
war on the British Empire; a certain disregard of risk; a bizarre
illusion of his hate for the abhorred Saxon. That he risked his
position by his connection with such a nest of scoundrels, there
could be no doubt. It was he who had given them such organization
as they had, and he stood between them and the law. But whatever
might have been suspected of him, he was cautious enough not to
go too far. He never appeared personally; his agents directed
the action&mdash;men who came from Havana rather mysteriously. They
were of all sorts; some of them were friars. But the rabble, who
knew him really only as the intendente of the great man, stood
in the greatest dread of him. Who was it procured the release
of some of them who had got into trouble in Havana? The intendente.
Who was it who caused six of their comrades, who had been taken
up on a matter of street-brawling in the capital, to be delivered
to the English as pirates? Again, the intendente, the terrible
man, the Juez, who apparently had the power to pardon and condemn.</p>

<p>In this way he was most dangerous to us in Rio Medio. He had
that rabble at his beck and call. He could produce a rising of
cut-throats by lifting his little finger. He was not very likely
to do that, however. He was intriguing in Havana&mdash;but how could
we unmask him there? "He has cut us off from the world," Carlos
would say. "It is so, my Juan, that, if I tried to write, no letter
of mine would reach its destination; it would fall into his hands.
And if I did manage to make my voice heard, he would appeal to
my uncle himself in his defence."</p>

<p>Besides, to whom could he write?&mdash;who would believe him? O'Brien
would deny everything, and go on his way. He had been accepted
too long, had served too many people and known so many secrets.
It was terrible. And if I went myself to Havana, no one would
believe me. But I should disappear; they would never see me again.
It was impossible to unmask that man unless by a long and careful
action. And for this he&mdash;Carlos&mdash;had no time; and I &mdash;I had
no standing, no relations, no skill even....</p>

<p>"But what is my line of conduct, Carlos?" I insisted; while Father
Antonio, from whom Carlos had, of course, no secrets, stood by
the bed, his round, jolly face almost comical in its expression
of compassionate concern.</p>

<p>Carlos passed his thin, wasted hand over a white brow pearled
with the sweat of real anguish.</p>

<p>Carlos thought that while Don Balthasar lived, O'Brien would
do nothing to compromise his influence over him. Neither could
I take any action; I must wait and watch. O'Brien would, no doubt,
try to remove me; but as long as I kept within the Casa, he thought
I should be safe. He recommended me to try to please his cousin,
and even found strength to smile at my transports. Don Balthasar
liked me for the sake of his sister, who had been so happy in
England. I was his kinsman and his guest. From first to last,
England, the idea of my country, of my home, played a great part
in my life then; it seemed to rest upon all our thoughts. To me
it was but my boyhood, the farm at the foot of the downs &mdash;Rooksby's
Manor&mdash;all within a small nook between the quarry by the side
of the Canterbury road and the shingle beach, whose regular crashing
under the feet of a smuggling band was the last sound of my country
I had heard. For Carlos it was the concrete image of stability,
with the romantic feeling of its peace and of Veronica's beauty;
the unchangeable land where he had loved. To O'Brien's hate it
loomed up immense and odious, like the form of a colossal enemy.
Father Antonio, in the na√Øve benevolence of his heart, prayed
each night for its conversion, as if it were a loved sinner. He
believed this event to be not very far off accomplishment, and
told me once, with an amazing simplicity of certitude, that "there
will be a great joy amongst the host of heaven on that day." It
is marvellous how that distant land, from which I had escaped
as if from a prison to go in search of romance, appeared romantic
and perfect in these days&mdash;all things to all men! With Seraphina
I talked of it and its denizens as of a fabulous country. I wonder
what idea she had formed of my father, of my mother, my sister&mdash;"Se√±ora
Dona Veronica Rooksby," she called her&mdash;of the landscape, of the
life, of the sky. Her eyes turned to me seriously. Once, stooping,
she plucked an orange marigold for her hair; and at last we came
to talk of our farm as the only perfect refuge for her.</p>
