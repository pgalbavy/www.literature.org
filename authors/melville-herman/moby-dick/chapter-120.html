<p>Ahab standing by the helm.  Starbuck approaching him.

<p>We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir.  The band is working
loose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?"
</p><p>"Strike nothing; lash it.  If I had sky-sail poles, I'd sway
them up now."
</p><p>"Sir!--in God's name!--sir?"
</p><p>"Well."
</p><p>"The anchors are working, sir.  Shall I get them inboard?"
</p><p>"Strike nothing, and stir nothing but lash everything.  The wind rises,
but it has not got up to my table-lands yet.  Quick, and see to it.--
By masts and keels! he takes me for the hunchbacked skipper of some
coasting smack.  Send down my main-top-sail yard!  Ho, gluepots!
Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck
of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that?
Oh, none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest time.
What a hooroosh aloft there!  I would e'en take it for sublime,
did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady.  Oh, take medicine,
take medicine!"
