<p>Obviously I must keep away from the railway. If the police were
after me in Morvern, that line would be warned, for it was a barrier
I must cross if I were to go farther north. I observed from the
map that it turned up the coast, and concluded that the place
for me to make for was the shore south of that turn, where Heaven
might send me some luck in the boat line. For I was pretty certain
that every porter and station-master on that tin-pot outfit was
anxious to make better acquaintance with my humble self.</p>

<p>I lunched off the sandwiches the Broadburys had given me, and
in the bright afternoon made my way down the hill, crossed at
the foot of a small fresh-water lochan, and pursued the issuing
stream through midge-infested woods of hazels to its junction
with the sea. It was rough going, but very pleasant, and I fell
into the same mood of idle contentment that I had enjoyed the
previous morning. I never met a soul. Sometimes a roe deer broke
out of the covert, or an old blackcock startled me with his scolding.
The place was bright with heather, still in its first bloom, and
smelt better than the myrrh of Arabia. It was a blessed glen,
and I was as happy as a king, till I began to feel the coming
of hunger, and reflected that the Lord alone knew when I might
get a meal. I had still some chocolate and biscuits, but I wanted
something substantial.</p>

<p>The distance was greater than I thought, and it was already twilight
when I reached the coast. The shore was open and desolate—great
banks of pebbles to which straggled alders and hazels from the
hillside scrub. But as I marched northward and turned a little
point of land I saw before me in a crook of the bay a smoking
cottage. And, plodding along by the water’s edge, was the bent
figure of a man, laden with nets and lobster pots. Also, beached
on the shingle was a boat.</p>

<p>I quickened my pace and overtook the fisherman. He was an old
man with a ragged grey beard, and his rig was seaman’s boots and
a much-darned blue jersey. He was deaf, and did not hear me when
I hailed him. When he caught sight of me he never stopped, though
he very solemnly returned my good evening. I fell into step with
him, and in his silent company reached the cottage.</p>

<p>He halted before the door and unslung his burdens. The place
was a two-roomed building with a roof of thatch, and the walls
all grown over with a yellow-flowered creeper. When he had straightened
his back, he looked seaward and at the sky, as if to prospect
the weather. Then he turned on me his gentle, absorbed eyes. "It
will haf been a fine day, sir. Wass you seeking the road to anywhere?"</p>

<p>"I was seeking a night’s lodging," I said. "I’ve had a long tramp
on the hills, and I’d be glad of a chance of not going farther."</p>

<p>"We will haf no accommodation for a gentleman," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"I can sleep on the floor, if you can give me a blanket and a
bite of supper."</p>

<p>"Indeed you will not," and he smiled slowly. "But I will ask
the wife. Mary, come here!"</p>

<p>An old woman appeared in answer to his call, a woman whose face
was so old that she seemed like his mother. In highland places
one sex ages quicker than the other.</p>

<p>"This gentleman would like to bide the night. I wass telling
him that we had a poor small house, but he says he will not be
minding it."</p>

<p>She looked at me with the timid politeness that you find only
in outland places.</p>

<p>"We can do our best, indeed, sir. The gentleman can have Colin’s
bed in the loft, but he will haf to be doing with plain food.
Supper is ready if you will come in now."</p>

<p>I had a scrub with a piece of yellow soap at an adjacent pool
in the burn and then entered a kitchen blue with peat-reek. We
had a meal of boiled fish, oatcakes and skim-milk cheese, with
cups of strong tea to wash it down. The old folk had the manners
of princes. They pressed food on me, and asked me no questions,
till for very decency’s sake I had to put up a story and give
some account of myself.</p>

<p>I found they had a son in the Argylls and a young boy in the
Navy. But they seemed disinclined to talk of them or of the war.
By a mere accident I hit on the old man’s absorbing interest.
He was passionate about the land. He had taken part in long-forgotten
agitations, and had suffered eviction in some ancient landlords’
quarrel farther north. Presently he was pouring out to me all
the woes of the crofter—woes that seemed so antediluvian and forgotten
that I listened as one would listen to an old song. "You who come
from a new country will not haf heard of these things," he kept
telling me, but by that peat fire I made up for my defective education.
He told me of evictions in the year. One somewhere in Sutherland,
and of harsh doings in the Outer Isles. It was far more than a
political grievance. It was the lament of the conservative for
vanished days and manners. "Over in Skye wass the fine land for
black cattle, and every man had his bit herd on the hillside.
But the lairds said it wass better for sheep, and then they said
it wass not good for sheep, so they put it under deer, and now
there is no black cattle anywhere in Skye." I tell you it was
like sad music on the bagpipes hearing that old fellow. The war
and all things modern meant nothing to him; he lived among the
tragedies of his youth and his prime.</p>

<p>I’m a Tory myself and a bit of a land-reformer, so we agreed
well enough. So well, that I got what I wanted without asking
for it. I told him I was going to Skye, and he offered to take
me over in his boat in the morning. "It will be no trouble. Indeed
no. I will be going that way myself to the fishing."</p>

<p>I told him that after the war, every acre of British soil would
have to be used for the men that had earned the right to it. But
that did not comfort him. He was not thinking about the land itself,
but about the men who had been driven from it fifty years before.
His desire was not for reform, but for restitution, and that was
past the power of any Government. I went to bed in the loft in
a sad, reflective mood, considering how in speeding our newfangled
plough we must break down a multitude of molehills and how desirable
and unreplaceable was the life of the moles.</p>

<p>In brisk, shining weather, with a wind from the south-east, we
put off next morning. In front was a brown line of low hills,
and behind them, a little to the north, that black toothcomb of
mountain range which I had seen the day before from the Arisaig
ridge.</p>

<p>"That is the Coolin," said the fisherman. "It is a bad place
where even the deer cannot go. But all the rest of Skye wass the
fine land for black cattle."</p>

<p>As we neared the coast, he pointed out many places. "Look there,
Sir, in that glen. I haf seen six cot houses smoking there, and
now there is not any left. There were three men of my own name
had crofts on the machars beyond the point, and if you go there
you will only find the marks of their bit gardens. You will know
the place by the gean trees."</p>

<p>When he put me ashore in a sandy bay between green ridges of
bracken, he was still harping upon the past. I got him to take
a pound—for the boat and not for the night’s hospitality, for
he would have beaten me with an oar if I had suggested that. The
last I saw of him, as I turned round at the top of the hill, he
had still his sail down, and was gazing at the lands which had
once been full of human dwellings and now were desolate.</p>

<p>I kept for a while along the ridge, with the Sound of Sleat on
my right, and beyond it the high hills of Knoydart and Kintail.
I was watching for the <em>Tobermory</em>, but saw no sign of
her. A steamer put out from Mallaig, and there were several drifters
crawling up the channel and once I saw the white ensign and a
destroyer bustled northward, leaving a cloud of black smoke in
her wake. Then, after consulting the map, I struck across country,
still keeping the higher ground, but, except at odd minutes, being
out of sight of the sea. I concluded that my business was to get
to the latitude of Ranna without wasting time.</p>

<p>So soon as I changed my course I had the Coolin for company.
Mountains have always been a craze of mine, and the blackness
and mystery of those grim peaks went to my head. I forgot all
about Fosse Manor and the Cotswolds. I forgot, too, what had been
my chief feeling since I left Glasgow, a sense of the absurdity
of my mission. It had all seemed too far-fetched and whimsical.
I was running apparently no great personal risk, and I had always
the unpleasing fear that Blenkiron might have been too clever
and that the whole thing might be a mare’s nest. But that dark
mountain mass changed my outlook. I began to have a queer instinct
that that was the place, that something might be concealed there,
something pretty damnable. I remember I sat on a top for half
an hour raking the hills with my glasses. I made out ugly precipices,
and glens which lost themselves in primeval blackness. When the
sun caught them—for it was a gleamy day—it brought out no colours,
only degrees of shade. No mountains I had ever seen—not the Drakensberg
or the red kopjes of Damaraland or the cold, white peaks around
Erzerum—ever looked so unearthly and uncanny.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, too, the sight of them set me thinking about Ivery.
There seemed no link between a smooth, sedentary being, dwelling
in villas and lecture-rooms, and that shaggy tangle of precipices.
But I felt there was, for I had begun to realise the bigness of
my opponent. Blenkiron had said that he spun his web wide. That
was intelligible enough among the half-baked youth of Biggleswick,
and the pacifist societies, or even the toughs on the Clyde. I
could fit him in all right to that picture. But that he should
be playing his game among those mysterious black crags seemed
to make him bigger and more desperate, altogether a different
kind of proposition. I didn’t exactly dislike the idea, for my
objection to my past weeks had been that I was out of my proper
job, and this was more my line of country. I always felt that
I was a better bandit than a detective. But a sort of awe mingled
with my satisfaction. I began to feel about Ivery as I had felt
about the three devils of the Black Stone who had hunted me before
the war, and as I never felt about any other Hun. The men we fought
at the Front and the men I had run across in the Greenmantle business,
even old Stumm himself, had been human miscreants. They were formidable
enough, but you could gauge and calculate their capacities. But
this Ivery was like a poison gas that hung in the air and got
into unexpected crannies and that you couldn’t fight in an upstanding
way. Till then, in spite of Blenkiron’s solemnity, I had regarded
him simply as a problem. But now he seemed an intimate and omnipresent
enemy, intangible, too, as the horror of a haunted house. Up on
that sunny hillside, with the sea winds round me and the whaups
calling, I got a chill in my spine when I thought of him.</p>

<p>I am ashamed to confess it, but I was also horribly hungry. There
was something about the war that made me ravenous, and the less
chance of food the worse I felt. If I had been in London with
twenty restaurants open to me, I should as likely as not have
gone off my feed. That was the cussedness of my stomach. I had
still a little chocolate left, and I ate the fisherman’s buttered
scones for luncheon, but long before the evening my thoughts were
dwelling on my empty interior.</p>

<p>I put up that night in a shepherd’s cottage miles from anywhere.
The man was called Macmorran, and he had come from Galloway when
sheep were booming. He was a very good imitation of a savage,
a little fellow with red hair and red eyes, who might have been
a Pict. He lived with a daughter who had once been in service
in Glasgow, a fat young woman with a face entirely covered with
freckles and a pout of habitual discontent. No wonder, for that
cottage was a pretty mean place. It was so thick with peat-reek
that throat and eyes were always smarting. It was badly built,
and must have leaked like a sieve in a storm. The father was a
surly fellow, whose conversation was one long growl at the world,
the high prices, the difficulty of moving his sheep, the meanness
of his master, and the godforsaken character of Skye. "Here’s
me no seen baker’s bread for a month, and no company but a wheen
ignorant Hielanders that yatter Gawlic. I wish I was back in the
Glenkens. And I’d gang the morn if I could get paid what I’m awed."</p>

<p>However, he gave me supper—a braxy ham and oatcake, and I bought
the remnants off him for use next day. I did not trust his blankets,
so I slept the night by the fire in the ruins of an arm-chair,
and woke at dawn with a foul taste in my mouth. A dip in the burn
refreshed me, and after a bowl of porridge I took the road again.
For I was anxious to get to some hill-top that looked over to
Ranna.</p>

<p>Before midday I was close under the eastern side of the Coolin,
on a road which was more a rockery than a path. Presently I saw
a big house ahead of me that looked like an inn, so I gave it
a miss and struck the highway that led to it a little farther
north. Then I bore off to the east, and was just beginning to
climb a hill which I judged stood between me and the sea, when
I heard wheels on the road and looked back.</p>

<p>It was a farmer’s gig carrying one man. I was about half a mile
off, and something in the cut of his jib seemed familiar. I got
my glasses on him and made out a short, stout figure clad in a
mackintosh, with a woollen comforter round its throat. As I watched,
it made a movement as if to rub its nose on its sleeve. That was
the pet trick of one man I knew. Inconspicuously I slipped through
the long heather so as to reach the road ahead of the gig. When
I rose like a wraith from the wayside the horse started, but not
the driver.</p>

<p>"So ye’re there," said Amos’s voice. "I’ve news for ye. The <em>Tobermory</em>
will be in Ranna by now. She passed Broadford two hours syne.
When I saw her I yoked this beast and came up on the chance of
foregathering with ye."</p>

<p>"How on earth did you know I would be here?" I asked in some
surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, I saw the way your mind was workin’ from your telegram.
And says I to mysel’—that man Brand, says I, is not the chiel
to be easy stoppit. But I was feared ye might be a day late, so
I came up the road to hold the fort. Man, I’m glad to see ye.
Ye’re younger and soopler than me, and yon Gresson’s a stirrin’
lad."</p>

<p>"There’s one thing you’ve got to do for me," I said. "I can’t
go into inns and shops, but I can’t do without food. I see from
the map there’s a town about six miles on. Go there and buy me
anything that’s tinned—biscuits and tongue and sardines, and a
couple of bottles of whisky if you can get them. This may be a
long job, so buy plenty."</p>

<p>"Whaur’ll I put them?" was his only question.</p>

<p>We fixed on a cache, a hundred yards from the highway in a place
where two ridges of hill enclosed the view so that only a short
bit of road was visible.</p>

<p>"I’ll get back to the Kyle," he told me, "and a’body there kens
Andra Amos, if ye should find a way of sendin’ a message or comin’
yourself. Oh, and I’ve got a word to ye from a lady that we ken
of. She says, the sooner ye’re back in Vawnity Fair the better
she’ll be pleased, always provided ye’ve got over the Hill Difficulty."</p>

<p>A smile screwed up his old face and he waved his whip in farewell.
I interpreted Mary’s message as an incitement to speed, but I
could not make the pace. That was Gresson’s business. I think
I was a little nettled, till I cheered myself by another interpretation.
She might be anxious for my safety, she might want to see me again,
anyhow the mere sending of the message showed I was not forgotten.
I was in a pleasant muse as I breasted the hill, keeping discreetly
in the cover of the many gullies. At the top I looked down on
Ranna and the sea.</p>

<p>There lay the <em>Tobermory</em> busy unloading. It would be
some time, no doubt, before Gresson could leave. There was no
row-boat in the channel yet, and I might have to wait hours. I
settled myself snugly between two rocks, where I could not be
seen, and where I had a clear view of the sea and shore. But presently
I found that I wanted some long heather to make a couch, and I
emerged to get some. I had not raised my head for a second when
I flopped down again. For I had a neighbour on the hill-top.</p>

<p>He was about two hundred yards off, just reaching the crest,
and, unlike me, walking quite openly. His eyes were on Ranna,
so he did not notice me, but from my cover I scanned every line
of him. He looked an ordinary countryman, wearing badly cut, baggy
knickerbockers of the kind that gillies affect. He had a face
like a Portuguese Jew, but I had seen that type before among people
with Highland names; they might be Jews or not, but they could
speak Gaelic. Presently he disappeared. He had followed my example
and selected a hiding-place.</p>

<p>It was a clear, hot day, but very pleasant in that airy place.
Good scents came up from the sea, the heather was warm and fragrant,
bees droned about, and stray seagulls swept the ridge with their
wings. I took a look now and then towards my neighbour, but he
was deep in his hidey-hole. Most of the time I kept my glasses
on Ranna, and watched the doings of the <em>Tobermory</em>. She
was tied up at the jetty, but seemed in no hurry to unload. I
watched the captain disembark and walk up to a house on the hillside.
Then some idlers sauntered down towards her and stood talking
and smoking close to her side. The captain returned and left again.
A man with papers in his hand appeared, and a woman with what
looked like a telegram. The mate went ashore in his best clothes.
Then at last, after midday, Gresson appeared. He joined the captain
at the piermaster’s office, and presently emerged on the other
side of the jetty where some small boats were beached. A man from
the <em>Tobermory</em> came in answer to his call, a boat was
launched, and began to make its way into the channel. Gresson
sat in the stern, placidly eating his luncheon.</p>

<p>I watched every detail of that crossing with some satisfaction
that my forecast was turning out right. About half-way across,
Gresson took the oars, but soon surrendered them to the <em>Tobermory</em>
man, and lit a pipe. He got out a pair of binoculars and raked
my hillside. I tried to see if my neighbour was making any signal,
but all was quiet. Presently the boat was hid from me by the bulge
of the hill, and I caught the sound of her scraping on the beach.</p>

<p>Gresson was not a hill-walker like my neighbour. It took him
the best part of an hour to get to the top, and he reached it
at a point not two yards from my hiding-place. I could hear by
his labouring breath that he was very blown. He walked straight
over the crest till he was out of sight of Ranna, and flung himself
on the ground. He was now about fifty yards from me, and I made
shift to lessen the distance. There was a grassy trench skirting
the north side of the hill, deep and thickly overgrown with heather.
I wound my way along it till I was about twelve yards from him,
where I stuck, owing to the trench dying away. When I peered out
of the cover I saw that the other man had joined him and that
the idiots were engaged in embracing each other.</p>

<p>I dared not move an inch nearer, and as they talked in a low
voice I could hear nothing of what they said. Nothing except one
phrase, which the strange man repeated twice, very emphatically.
"Tomorrow night," he said, and I noticed that his voice had not
the Highland inflection which I looked for. Gresson nodded and
glanced at his watch, and then the two began to move downhill
towards the road I had travelled that morning.</p>

<p>I followed as best I could, using a shallow dry watercourse of
which sheep had made a track, and which kept me well below the
level of the moor. It took me down the hill, but some distance
from the line the pair were taking, and I had to reconnoitre frequently
to watch their movements. They were still a quarter of a mile
or so from the road, when they stopped and stared, and I stared
with them. On that lonely highway travellers were about as rare
as roadmenders, and what caught their eye was a farmer’s gig driven
by a thick-set elderly man with a woollen comforter round his
neck.</p>

<p>I had a bad moment, for I reckoned that if Gresson recognised
Amos he might take fright. Perhaps the driver of the gig thought
the same, for he appeared to be very drunk. He waved his whip,
he jiggoted the reins, and he made an effort to sing. He looked
towards the figures on the hillside, and cried out something.
The gig narrowly missed the ditch, and then to my relief the horse
bolted. Swaying like a ship in a gale, the whole outfit lurched
out of sight round the corner of hill where lay my cache. If Amos
could stop the beast and deliver the goods there, he had put up
a masterly bit of buffoonery.</p>

<p>The two men laughed at the performance, and then they parted.
Gresson retraced his steps up the hill. The other man—I called
him in my mind the Portuguese Jew—started off at a great pace
due west, across the road, and over a big patch of bog towards
the northern butt of the Coolin. He had some errand, which Gresson
knew about, and he was in a hurry to perform it. It was clearly
my job to get after him.</p>

<p>I had a rotten afternoon. The fellow covered the moorland miles
like a deer, and under the hot August sun I toiled on his trail.
I had to keep well behind, and as much as possible in cover, in
case he looked back; and that meant that when he had passed over
a ridge I had to double not to let him get too far ahead, and
when we were in an open place I had to make wide circuits to keep
hidden. We struck a road which crossed a low pass and skirted
the flank of the mountains, and this we followed till we were
on the western side and within sight of the sea. It was gorgeous
weather, and out on the blue water I saw cool sails moving and
little breezes ruffling the calm, while I was glowing like a furnace.
Happily I was in fair training, and I needed it. The Portuguese
Jew must have done a steady six miles an hour over abominable
country.</p>

<p>About five o’clock we came to a point where I dared not follow.
The road ran flat by the edge of the sea, so that several miles
of it were visible. Moreover, the man had begun to look round
every few minutes. He was getting near something and wanted to
be sure that no one was in his neighbourhood. I left the road
accordingly, and took to the hillside, which to my undoing was
one long cascade of screes and tumbled rocks. I saw him drop over
a rise which seemed to mark the rim of a little bay into which
descended one of the big corries of the mountains. It must have
been a good half-hour later before I, at my greater altitude and
with far worse going, reached the same rim. I looked into the
glen and my man had disappeared.</p>

<p>He could not have crossed it, for the place was wider than I
had thought. A ring of black precipices came down to within half
a mile of the shore, and between them was a big stream—long, shallow
pools at the sea end and a chain of waterfalls above. He had gone
to earth like a badger somewhere, and I dared not move in case
he might be watching me from behind a boulder.</p>

<p>But even as I hesitated he appeared again, fording the stream,
his face set on the road we had come. Whatever his errand was
he had finished it, and was posting back to his master. For a
moment I thought I should follow him, but another instinct prevailed.
He had not come to this wild place for the scenery. Somewhere
down in the glen there was something or somebody that held the
key of the mystery. It was my business to stay there till I had
unlocked it. Besides, in two hours it would be dark, and I had
had enough walking for one day.</p>

<p>I made my way to the stream side and had a long drink. The corrie
behind me was lit up with the westering sun, and the bald cliffs
were flushed with pink and gold. On each side of the stream was
turf like a lawn, perhaps a hundred yards wide, and then a tangle
of long heather and boulders right up to the edge of the great
rocks. I had never seen a more delectable evening, but I could
not enjoy its peace because of my anxiety about the Portuguese
Jew. He had not been there more than half an hour, just about
long enough for a man to travel to the first ridge across the
burn and back. Yet he had found time to do his business. He might
have left a letter in some prearranged place—in which case I would
stay there till the man it was meant for turned up. Or he might
have met someone, though I didn’t think that possible. As I scanned
the acres of rough moor and then looked at the sea lapping delicately
on the grey sand I had the feeling that a knotty problem was before
me. It was too dark to try to track his steps. That must be left
for the morning, and I prayed that there would be no rain in the
night.</p>

<p>I ate for supper most of the braxy ham and oatcake I had brought
from Macmorran’s cottage. It took some self-denial, for I was
ferociously hungry, to save a little for breakfast next morning.
Then I pulled heather and bracken and made myself a bed in the
shelter of a rock which stood on a knoll above the stream. My
bed-chamber was well hidden, but at the same time, if anything
should appear in the early dawn, it gave me a prospect. With my
waterproof I was perfectly warm, and, after smoking two pipes,
I fell asleep.</p>

<p>My night’s rest was broken. First it was a fox which came and
barked at my ear and woke me to a pitch-black night, with scarcely
a star showing. The next time it was nothing but a wandering hill-wind,
but as I sat up and listened I thought I saw a spark of light
near the edge of the sea. It was only for a second, but it disquieted
me. I got out and climbed on the top of the rock, but all was
still save for the gentle lap of the tide and the croak of some
night bird among the crags. The third time I was suddenly quite
wide awake, and without any reason, for I had not been dreaming.
Now I have slept hundreds of times alone beside my horse on the
veld, and I never knew any cause for such awakenings but the one,
and that was the presence near me of some human being. A man who
is accustomed to solitude gets this extra sense which announces
like an alarm-clock the approach of one of his kind.</p>

<p>But I could hear nothing. There was a scraping and rustling on
the moor, but that was only the wind and the little wild things
of the hills. A fox, perhaps, or a blue hare. I convinced my reason,
but not my senses, and for long I lay awake with my ears at full
cock and every nerve tense. Then I fell asleep, and woke to the
first flush of dawn.</p>

<p>The sun was behind the Coolin and the hills were black as ink,
but far out in the western seas was a broad band of gold. I got
up and went down to the shore. The mouth of the stream was shallow,
but as I moved south I came to a place where two small capes enclosed
an inlet. It must have been a fault in the volcanic rock, for
its depth was portentous. I stripped and dived far into its cold
abysses, but I did not reach the bottom. I came to the surface
rather breathless, and struck out to sea, where I floated on my
back and looked at the great rampart of crag. I saw that the place
where I had spent the night was only a little oasis of green at
the base of one of the grimmest corries the imagination could
picture. It was as desert as Damaraland. I noticed, too, how sharply
the cliffs rose from the level. There were chimneys and gullies
by which a man might have made his way to the summit, but no one
of them could have been scaled except by a mountaineer.</p>

<p>I was feeling better now, with all the frowsiness washed out
of me, and I dried myself by racing up and down the heather. Then
I noticed something. There were marks of human feet at the top
of the deep-water inlet—not mine, for they were on the other side.
The short sea-turf was bruised and trampled in several places,
and there were broken stems of bracken. I thought that some fisherman
had probably landed there to stretch his legs.</p>

<p>But that set me thinking of the Portuguese Jew. After breakfasting
on my last morsels of food—a knuckle of braxy and a bit of oatcake—I
set about tracking him from the place where he had first entered
the glen. To get my bearings, I went back over the road I had
come myself, and after a good deal of trouble I found his spoor.
It was pretty clear as far as the stream, for he had been walking—or
rather running—over ground with many patches of gravel on it.
After that it was difficult, and I lost it entirely in the rough
heather below the crags. All that I could make out for certain
was that he had crossed the stream, and that his business, whatever
it was, had been with the few acres of tumbled wilderness below
the precipices.</p>

<p>I spent a busy morning there, but found nothing except the skeleton
of a sheep picked clean by the ravens. It was a thankless job,
and I got very cross over it. I had an ugly feeling that I was
on a false scent and wasting my time. I wished to Heaven I had
old Peter with me. He could follow spoor like a Bushman, and would
have riddled the Portuguese Jew’s track out of any jungle on earth.
That was a game I had never learned, for in the old days I had
always left it to my natives. I chucked the attempt, and lay disconsolately
on a warm patch of grass and smoked and thought about Peter. But
my chief reflections were that I had breakfasted at five, that
it was now eleven, that I was intolerably hungry, that there was
nothing here to feed a grasshopper, and that I should starve unless
I got supplies.</p>

<p>It was a long road to my cache, but there were no two ways of
it. My only hope was to sit tight in the glen, and it might involve
a wait of days. To wait I must have food, and, though it meant
relinquishing guard for a matter of six hours, the risk had to
be taken. I set off at a brisk pace with a very depressed mind.</p>

<p>From the map it seemed that a short cut lay over a pass in the
range. I resolved to take it, and that short cut, like most of
its kind, was unblessed by Heaven. I will not dwell upon the discomforts
of the journey. I found myself slithering among screes, climbing
steep chimneys, and travelling precariously along razor-backs.
The shoes were nearly rent from my feet by the infernal rocks,
which were all pitted as if by some geological small-pox. When
at last I crossed the divide, I had a horrible business getting
down from one level to another in a gruesome corrie, where each
step was composed of smooth boiler-plates. But at last I was among
the bogs on the east side, and came to the place beside the road
where I had fixed my cache.</p>

<p>The faithful Amos had not failed me. There were the provisions—a
couple of small loaves, a dozen tins, and a bottle of whisky.
I made the best pack I could of them in my waterproof, swung it
on my stick, and started back, thinking that I must be very like
the picture of Christian on the title-page of <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>.</p>

<p>I was liker Christian before I reached my destination—Christian
after he had got up the Hill Difficulty. The morning’s walk had
been bad, but the afternoon’s was worse, for I was in a fever
to get back, and, having had enough of the hills, chose the longer
route I had followed the previous day. I was mortally afraid of
being seen, for I cut a queer figure, so I avoided every stretch
of road where I had not a clear view ahead. Many weary detours
I made among moss-hags and screes and the stony channels of burns.
But I got there at last, and it was almost with a sense of comfort
that I flung my pack down beside the stream where I had passed
the night.</p>

<p>I ate a good meal, lit my pipe, and fell into the equable mood
which follows upon fatigue ended and hunger satisfied. The sun
was westering, and its light fell upon the rock-wall above the
place where I had abandoned my search for the spoor.</p>

<p>As I gazed at it idly I saw a curious thing.</p>

<p>It seemed to be split in two and a shaft of sunlight came through
between. There could be no doubt about it. I saw the end of the
shaft on the moor beneath, while all the rest lay in shadow. I
rubbed my eyes, and got out my glasses. Then I guessed the explanation.
There was a rock tower close against the face of the main precipice
and indistinguishable from it to anyone looking direct at the
face. Only when the sun fell on it obliquely could it be discovered.
And between the tower and the cliff there must be a substantial
hollow.</p>

<p>The discovery brought me to my feet, and set me running towards
the end of the shaft of sunlight. I left the heather, scrambled
up some yards of screes, and had a difficult time on some very
smooth slabs, where only the friction of tweed and rough rock
gave me a hold. Slowly I worked my way towards the speck of sunlight,
till I found a handhold, and swung myself into the crack. On one
side was the main wall of the hill, on the other a tower some
ninety feet high, and between them a long crevice varying in width
from three to six feet. Beyond it there showed a small bright
patch of sea.</p>

<p>There was more, for at the point where I entered it there was
an overhang which made a fine cavern, low at the entrance but
a dozen feet high inside, and as dry as tinder. Here, thought
I, is the perfect hiding-place. Before going farther I resolved
to return for food. It was not very easy descending, and I slipped
the last twenty feet, landing on my head in a soft patch of screes.
At the burnside I filled my flask from the whisky bottle, and
put half a loaf, a tin of sardines, a tin of tongue, and a packet
of chocolate in my waterproof pockets. Laden as I was, it took
me some time to get up again, but I managed it, and stored my
belongings in a corner of the cave. Then I set out to explore
the rest of the crack.</p>

<p>It slanted down and then rose again to a small platform. After
that it dropped in easy steps to the moor beyond the tower. If
the Portuguese Jew had come here, that was the way by which he
had reached it, for he would not have had the time to make my
ascent. I went very cautiously, for I felt I was on the eve of
a big discovery. The platform was partly hidden from my end by
a bend in the crack, and it was more or less screened by an outlying
bastion of the tower from the other side. Its surface was covered
with fine powdery dust, as were the steps beyond it. In some excitement
I knelt down and examined it.</p>

<p>Beyond doubt there was spoor here. I knew the Portuguese Jew’s
footmarks by this time, and I made them out clearly, especially
in one corner. But there were other footsteps, quite different.
The one showed the rackets of rough country boots, the others
were from un-nailed soles. Again I longed for Peter to make certain,
though I was pretty sure of my conclusions. The man I had followed
had come here, and he had not stayed long. Someone else had been
here, probably later, for the un-nailed shoes overlaid the rackets.
The first man might have left a message for the second. Perhaps
the second was that human presence of which I had been dimly conscious
in the night-time.</p>

<p>I carefully removed all traces of my own footmarks, and went
back to my cave. My head was humming with my discovery. I remembered
Gresson’s word to his friend: "Tomorrow night." As I read it,
the Portuguese Jew had taken a message from Gresson to someone,
and that someone had come from somewhere and picked it up. The
message contained an assignation for this very night. I had found
a point of observation, for no one was likely to come near my
cave, which was reached from the moor by such a toilsome climb.
There I should bivouac and see what the darkness brought forth.
I remember reflecting on the amazing luck which had so far attended
me. As I looked from my refuge at the blue haze of twilight creeping
over the waters, I felt my pulses quicken with a wild anticipation.</p>

<p>Then I heard a sound below me, and craned my neck round the edge
of the tower. A man was climbing up the rock by the way I had
come.</p>
