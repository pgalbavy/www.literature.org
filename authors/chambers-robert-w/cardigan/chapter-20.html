<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Long before Sir John returned, or, indeed, long before we had
any word from him, I was dressed and making hourly essays at walking,
first in the house, then through the door-yard to the guard-house,
where I would sit in the hot sun and breathe the full-throated
October winds. Keen and sweet as apple-wine, the air I drank warmed
and excited me; my eyes grew clear and strong, my lean cheeks
filled, my wasted limbs once more began to bear me with the old-time
lightness and delight.</p>

<p>Too, I found myself at times nosing the wind with half-closed
eyes, like a young hound too long kennelled, or sometimes listening,
yet lost in reverie, as hounds listen on winter nights, drowsing
by the dull fire.</p>

<p>A hundred little zephyrs that knew me whispered to me through
open windows. At night I caught the faint echo of the breezes'
laughter under the eaves; sometimes I heard the big wind stirring
the dark pines, so far away that none but I could hear it playing
with the baby breezes.</p>

<p>They were little friendly breezes, the spirits of spirits, with
dainty, familiar voices, too delicate to frighten the birds they
sometimes gossiped with. Even the slate-gray deer-mouse, with
his white belly, feared not my little friends, the winds; for
oft I heard him, in the creamy October moonlight, tuning his tiny
elfin song to the night wind's fluting.</p>

<p>On warm, spicy days Mr. Duncan and I would seek the stone church,
sitting silent for hours in the purple and crimson rays of the
stained window, watching the golden dust-bands slanting on the
tomb.</p>

<p>The resentment of bitter grief had died out in my heart; sorrow
had been purged of selfishness; I felt the calm presence of the
dead at my elbow where'er I went. Strength and quiet came to me
in voiceless communion; high resolve, patience, and hope were
bred within me under the serene glow of those jewelled panes.
On the gray-stone slab at my feet, dreaming, I read the story
of a noble life, "Keep faith with all men," and here, in silence,
I sought to read and understand the changeless laws which shelter
souls and mark the mile-stones of a blameless life.</p>

<p>When the southwest sun hung gilding the clover, over miles of
upland I passed, as I had roamed with him, twisting the bronzing
sweet-fern from its woody stem, touching the silken milk-weed
to set free its floss, halting, breast-deep in crimsoning sumach,
to mark the headlong, whirling covey drive through the thorns
into the purple dusk.</p>

<p>His hounds bayed from their kennels; there was no one to cast
them free; and the red fox throttled the fowls by moonlight; and
the lynx squalled in the swamp. His horses trampled the stables
till the oak floors, reverberating, hummed thunder; there was
no one to bit and bridle them; the moorland clover swayed untrodden
in the wind, and the dun stag stamped the crag.</p>

<p>Night and day the river rushed to the sea; night and day the
brooks prattled to their pebbles, the slim salmon lay in the pools,
the lithe trout stemmed the gravel-rifts; but never a line whistled
in the silence, and never a scarlet feather-fly sailed on the
waters among the autumn leaves.</p>

<p>Yet, though land and water were lonely without him, I was not
lonely, for he walked with me always over the land he had known,
and his voice was in the soft, mild winds he loved so well.</p>

<p>With the memory of Silver Heels it was different. Every scented
stem of sweet-fern was redolent of her; every grass-blade quivered
for her; the winds called her all day long; the brooks whispered,
"Where is Silver Heels?"</p>

<p>Through our old play-grounds, in the orchard, on the stairs,
through the darkened school-room I followed, haunting the vanished
footsteps&mdash;gay, light, flying feet of the child I had loved so
long, unknowing.</p>

<p>Her stocks stood outside the nursery door; the brass key was
on the nail. In her dim chamber hung the scent of lavender, while
through the half-closed shutters a faint freshness crept, stirring
the ghostly curtains of her bed.</p>

<p>Wistfulness, doubt, tenderness, and sadness came and went like
sun-spots on an April day. I waited with delicious dread for her
return; I fretted, doubted, hoped, all in the same quick heart-beat,
which was not all pain. Only that ghost of happiness which men
call hope I knew in those long autumn days alone among the haunts
of varied yesterdays.</p>

<p>When the golden month drew near its end, amid the dropping glory
of the maple-leaves, one sun-drenched morning I awoke to hear
the drums and pipes skirling the march of "Tryon County Men":</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Hark to the horn in the dawn o' the morn!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rally, whoever ye be;<br/>
For it's down Derry Down, and it's over the lea,<br/>
And it's saddle and bridle as sure as you're born!<br/>
Scattered and trampled and torn is the corn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As we ride to the war in the morning;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down Derry Down!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down Derry Down!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For we ride to the war in the morning!"

</p>
</div>
<p>"Officer o' the guard! Turn out the guard!" bawled the sentry
under my window. As I looked out the drums came crashing past,
and behind them tramped the Highlanders, kilts and sporrans swinging,
firelocks aslant and claymore blades shining in the sun.</p>

<p>It was the new regiment organized by Sir John, picked men all,
and fierce partisans of the King, weeded from the militia regiment
lately disbanded at Johnstown by order of Governor Tryon.</p>

<p>Behind them, fifes squealing the "Huron," came the reorganized
battalion of yeomanry, now stripped clean of rebel suspects, and
rechristened "Johnson's Greens;" stout, brawny yokels with hats
askew and the green cockade veiled in crape, their hunting-shirts
caped triple and fringed deep in green wool, their powder-horns
tasselled and chased in silver gilt.</p>

<p>I watched them swinging north into the purple hills for their
month's training, the new order having arrived some eight days
since from Governor Tryon.</p>

<p>Leaning there in the casement, wrapped in my dressing-gown, I
saw Colonel Guy Johnson ride up to the block-house, dismount,
and call out Mr. Duncan. Then began a great bustle among the soldiers,
for what reason I did not understand, until a knocking at my door
brought a gillie with Colonel Guy Johnson's compliments, and would
I dress in my uniform to receive Sir John, who was expected for
breakfast.</p>

<p>My heart began to beat madly; could it be possible that Sir John
had brought Silver Heels, after all? Doctor Pierson had said that
she would remain for the present in Boston; but perhaps Doctor
Pierson did not know everything that went on in the world.</p>

<p>To crush back hope from sheer dread of disappointment was a thankless
task and too much for me. I dressed in my red uniform, tied my
silver gorget, hung my sword, and drew on my spurred boots. Standing
by the mirror, pensive, I thought of my delight in these same
clothes when first I wore them for Sir William. Alas! alas! The
gilt lace dulled under my eyes as I looked; the gorget tarnished;
the spurs rang sadly in the silence. I twisted a strip of crape
in my hilt, shook out the black badge on my sleeve, and went down-stairs,
very soberly, in the livery of the King I must one day desert.
Perhaps I was now wearing it for the last time. Well, such things
matter nothing now; true hearts can beat as freely under a buckskin
shirt as beneath the jewelled sashes of the great.</p>

<p>As I reached the porch Mr. Duncan came hurrying past, buttoning
his gloves.</p>

<p>"Sir John is in the village," he said, returning my salute, "and
he has an escort of your regiment at his back. My varlets yonder
need pipe-clay, but I dare not risk delay."</p>

<p>"Where is Colonel Guy?" I asked, but at that moment he came out
of the stable in full uniform, and Mr. Duncan and I joined him
at salute. He barely noticed me, as usual, but gave his orders
to Mr. Duncan and then looked across the fields towards the village.</p>

<p>"Is Felicity with Sir John?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, without turning.</p>

<p>My throat swelled and my mouth quivered. Where was she, then?
What did all this mean?</p>

<p>"By-the-by," observed Colonel Guy, carelessly, "Sir John has
chosen another aide-de-camp in your place. You, of course, will
join your regiment at Albany."</p>

<p>I looked at him calmly, but he was again gazing out across the
fields. So Sir John, who had never cared about me, had rid himself
of me. This brought matters to a climax. Truly enough, I was now
wearing my red uniform for the last time.</p>

<p>I looked across the yellowing fields where, on the highway, a
troop of horse had come up over the hill and were now galloping
hither in a veil of sparkling dust. I watched them indifferently;
the drums at the guard-house were sounding, beating the major-general's
salute of two ruffles; the horsemen swept up past the ranks of
presented firelocks and halted before the Hall.</p>

<p>And now I saw Sir John in full uniform of his rank, badged with
mourning, yet all a-glitter with medals and orders, slowly dismount,
while gillie Bareshanks held his stirrup. Alas! alas! that he
must be known by men as the son of his great father!&mdash;this cold,
slow man, with distrustful eyes and a mouth which to see was to
watch. His very voice seemed to sound a warning in its emotionless
monotony; his lips said, "On guard, lest we trick you unawares."</p>

<p>Sir John greeted Colonel Guy, holding his hand and dropping into
low conversation for a few moments. Then, as I gave him the officers'
salute, he rendered it and offered his hand, asking me how I did.</p>

<p>I had the honour to report myself quite recovered, and in turn
inquired concerning his own health, the health of Aunt Molly,
and of Silver Heels; to which he replied that Mistress Molly with
Esk and Peter was in Quebec; that Felicity was well; that he himself
suffered somewhat from indigestion, but was otherwise in possession
of perfect health.</p>

<p>He then presented me to several officers of my own regiment,
among them a very young cornet, who smiled at me in such friendly
fashion that my lonely heart was warm towards him. His name was
Rodman Girdwood, and he swaggered when he walked; but so frankly
did he ruffle it that I could not choose but like him and smile
indulgence on his guileless self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>"They don't like me," he said, confidentially, as I took him
to my own chamber so that he might remove the stains of travel.
"They don't like me because I talk too much at mess. I say what
I think, and I say it loud, sir."</p>

<p>"What do you say&mdash;loud?" I asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, everything. I say it's a damned shame to send British troops
into Boston; I say it's a doubly damned shame to close the port
and starve the poor; I say that Tommy Gage is in a dirty business,
and I, for one, hope the Boston people will hold on until the
British Parliament find their senses. Oh, I don't care who hears
me!" he said, throwing off his coat and sword and plunging into
the water-basin.</p>

<p>His servant came to the door for orders, but Girdwood bade him
let him alone and seek a pot o' beer in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"I trust I have not shocked your loyalty, Mr. Cardigan," he said,
using a towel vigorously.</p>

<p>"Oh no," I laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to be discourteous," he added, smoothing his ruffled
lace; "but sometimes I feel as though I must stand up on a hill
and shout across the ocean to Parliament, 'Don't make fools of
yourselves'!"</p>

<p>I was laughing so heartily that he turned around in humorous
surprise.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are one of those disrespectful patriots," he
said. "I never heard a Tory laugh at anything I said. Come, sir,
pray repeat 'God save the King'!"</p>

<p>"God save"&mdash;we began together, then ended&mdash;"our country!"</p>

<p>I looked at him gravely. He, too, had grown serious. Presently
he held out his hand. I took it in silence.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said, "I had little thought of finding a comrade
in our new cornet."</p>

<p>"Nor I in the Border Horse," said I, quietly.</p>

<p>He turned to the mirror and began retying his queue ribbon. After
a twist or two the smile came back to his lips and the jauntiness
to his carriage.</p>

<p>"It's all in a lifetime," he said. "Lord, but I'm hungry, Cardigan!
Honest Abraham, I haven't broken a crust since we left Schenectady!"</p>

<p>"Come on, then," I said; "we subalterns must not keep our superiors,
you know."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't wait for us, anyway," he said, following me down-stairs
to the breakfast-room, into which already Sir John and his suite
were crowding.</p>

<p>The breakfast was short and dreary. Sir John's unsympathetic
presence had never yet warmed even his familiars to gayety. Those
who were under his orders found him severe and unbending; his
equals, I think, distrusted him; but his superiors saw in him
a latent energy which they believed might be worth their control
some day, and so studied him carefully, prepared for anything
from fidelity to indifference, and even, perhaps, treachery.</p>

<p>Benning, major in the Border Horse, strove indeed to liven the
breakfast with liberal libations and jests, neither of which were
particularly encouraged by Sir John. As for Colonel Guy Johnson,
he brooded in his dish, a strange, dark, silent man who had never,
to my knowledge, shown a single human impulse for either good
or evil. He was a faultless executor of duty intrusted, obeying
to the letter, yet never offering suggestions; a scrupulously
clean man in speech and habit; a blameless husband, and an inoffensive
neighbour. But that was all, and I had sooner had a stone idol
as neighbour than Colonel Guy Johnson.</p>

<p>The living Johnsons seemed to be alike in nature. I do not even
now understand why I thought so, but I sometimes believed that
they had, deep in them, something of that sombre ferocity which
burned in the Butlers. Yet to me they had exhibited nothing but
the most passionless reserve.</p>

<p>When the gloomy breakfast was ended, Colonel Guy Johnson conducted
his guests to the porch, where they made ready for the inspection
of our two stone block-houses and the new artillery in the barracks,
sent recently by Governor Tryon at Sir John's request.</p>

<p>Supposing I was to follow, as I no longer remained aide-de-camp
to the major-general, I started off with Rodman Girdwood, but
was recalled by a soldier, who reported that Sir John awaited
me in the library.</p>

<p>Sir John was sitting at the great oak table as I entered, and
he motioned me to a seat opposite. He held in his hands a bundle
of papers, which he slowly turned over and over in his fingers.</p>

<p>He first informed me that he had selected another aide-de camp,
not because he expected to find me unsatisfactory, but because
it was most desirable that young, inexperienced officers should
join the colours as soon as possible. He said that the times were
troublous and uncertain; that sedition was abroad in the land;
that young men needed the counsel of loyal authority, and the
example and discipline of military life. He expected me, he said,
to return to Albany with the squadron which had served him as
escort.</p>

<p>To which I made no reply.</p>

<p>He then spoke of the death of his father, of the responsibilities
of his own position, and of his claim on me for obedience. He
spoke of my mission to Cresap and the Cayugas as a mistake in
policy; and I burned to hear him criticise Sir William's acts.
He asked me for my report, and I gave it to him, relating every
circumstance of my meeting with the Cayugas, my peril, my rescue,
the fight at Cresap's fort, the treachery of Dunmore, Greathouse,
Connolly, and the others.</p>

<p>He frowned, listening with lowered eyes.</p>

<p>I told him of the insult offered our family by Dunmore; I told
how Silver Heels escaped. Then I related every circumstance in
my relations with Walter Butler, from my first open quarrel with
him here at the Hall to his deadly assault on me while in discharge
of my mission, and finally how he had fallen under my fury in
Dunmore's presence.</p>

<p>Sir John's face was expressionless. He deplored the matters mentioned,
saying that loyal men must stand together and not exterminate
each other. He pointed out that Dunmore was the royal Governor
of Virginia; that an alliance with Felicity was an honour we were
most unwise to refuse; he regretted the quarrel between such a
zealous loyalist as Walter Butler and myself, but coolly informed
me that he had heard from Butler, and that he was recovering slowly
from the breaking of an arm, collar-bone, and many ribs.</p>

<p>This calm acknowledgment that Sir John and my deadly enemy were
in such intimacy set my blood boiling. His amazing complacency
towards these men after the insults offered his own kin took my
breath.</p>

<p>He said that his policy in regard to the Cayuga rising was not
the policy of Sir William. His efforts were directed towards the
solid assembling of all men, so that the loyal might in the hour
of danger present an unbroken front to rebellion and discontent.
It was, he said, my duty to lay aside all rancour against Lord
Dunmore and Captain Butler. This was not the time to settle personal
differences. Later, he could see no objection to my calling out
Walter Butler or demanding reparation from Lord Dunmore, if I
found it necessary.</p>

<p>I was slowly beginning to hate Sir John.</p>

<p>I therefore told him how we had done to death the wretch Greathouse;
how I had shot the driver of the coach, who was the unknown man
who had tasted his own hatchet in the forest.</p>

<p>Sir John informed me that I and my party had also slain Wraxall
and Toby Tice, and that Captain Murdy alone had escaped our fury.</p>

<p>I was contented to hear it; contented to hear, too, that Walter
Butler lived; for, though no man on earth deserved death more
than he, I had not wished to slay any man in such a manner. I
could wait, for I never doubted that he must one day die by my
hand, though not the kind of death that he had escaped so narrowly.</p>

<p>Sir John now spoke of the will left by Sir William. He held a
copy in his hand and opened it.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "that your fortune is not considerable,
though my father has invested it most fortunately. The income
is ample for a young man, and on the decease of your uncle, Sir
Terence, you will come into his title and estate in Ireland. This
should make you wealthy. However, Sir William saw fit to provide
for you further."</p>

<p>He turned the pages of the document slowly, frowning.</p>

<p>"Where is my own money?" I asked.</p>

<p>Sir John passed me a letter, sealed, which he said would recommend
me to the lawyer in Albany who administered my fortune until I
became of legal age. Then he resumed his study of the will.</p>

<p>"Read from the beginning," I said. I had a curious feeling that
it was indecent to ignore anything Sir William had written, in
order to hurry to that clause relating only to my own selfish
profit.</p>

<p>Sir John glanced at me across the table, then read aloud, in
his cold, passionless voice:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"In the name of God, Amen! I, Sir William Johnson, of Johnson<br/>
Hall, in the County of Tryon and Province of New York, Bart.,<br/>
being of sound and disposing mind, memory, and understanding,<br/>
do make, publish, and declare this to be my last Will and<br/>
Testament in manner and form following:

</p>
<p>
"First and principally, I resign my soul to the great and<br/>
merciful God who made it, in hopes, through the merits alone<br/>
of my blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to have a joyful<br/>
resurrection to life eternal&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>He stopped abruptly, saying that he saw no necessity for reading
all that, and turned directly to the clause concerning me. Then
he read:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"And as to the worldly and temporal estate which God was<br/>
pleased to endow me with, I devise, bequeath, and dispose of<br/>
in the following manner: Imprimis. I will, order and direct<br/>
that all such just debts as I may owe, at the time of my<br/>
decease, to be paid by my son Sir John Johnson, Baronet....

</p>
<p>
"Item. To my dearly beloved kinsman and ward, Michael<br/>
Cardigan, I give and bequeath the sum of three thousand<br/>
pounds, York currency, to him or the survivor of him. Also my<br/>
own horse Warlock."

</p>
</div>
<p>Sir John turned several pages, found another clause, and read:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"To the aforesaid Michael Cardigan I devise and bequeath that<br/>
lot of land which I purchased from Jelles Fonda, in the<br/>
Kennyetto Patent; also two hundred acres of land adjoining<br/>
thereto, being part of the Perth Patent, to be laid out in a<br/>
compact body between the sugar bush and the Kennyetto Creek;<br/>
also four thousand acres in the Royal Grant, now called<br/>
Kingsland, next to the Mohawk River, where is the best place<br/>
for salmon fishing; also that strip of land from the falls or<br/>
carrying-place to Lot No. 1, opposite to the hunting-lodge of<br/>
Colonel John Butler, where woodcocks, snipes, and wild ducks<br/>
are accustomed to be shot by me, within the limits and<br/>
including all the game-land I bought from Peter Weaver."

</p>
</div>
<p>Sir John folded the paper and handed it to me, saying, "It is
strange that Sir William thought fit to bequeath you such a vast
property."</p>

<p>"What provision was made for Felicity?" I asked, quietly.</p>

<p>"She might have had three thousand pounds and a thousand acres
adjoining yours in the Kennyetto Patent," replied Sir John, coldly.
"But under present circumstances&mdash;ahem&mdash;she receives nothing."</p>

<p>I thought a moment. In the hallway I heard the officers returning
with Colonel Guy Johnson from their inspection.</p>

<p>"Where is Felicity?" I asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>He looked up in displeasure at my brusqueness, but did not reply.
I repeated the question.</p>

<p>"She is near Boston," he said, with a frown of annoyance. "Her
lawyer is Thomas Foxcroft in Queen Street."</p>

<p>"When will she return here?"</p>

<p>"She will not return."</p>

<p>"What!" I cried, springing to my feet.</p>

<p>Sir John eyed me sullenly.</p>

<p>"I beg you will conduct in moderation," he said.</p>

<p>"Then tell me what you have done with my cousin Felicity!"</p>

<p>"She is not your cousin, or any kin to you or to us," he said,
coldly. "I have had some correspondence with Sir Peter Warren,
which, I may say, does not concern you. Enough that Felicity is
not his niece, nor the daughter of his dead brother, nor any kin
whatever to him, to us, or to you. Further than that I have nothing
to say, except that the young woman is now with her own kin, and
will remain there, because it is her proper legal residence. Better
for you," he added, grimly, "and better for us if you had not
meddled with what did not concern you, and had allowed Lord Dunmore
to take her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dunmore! Wed Felicity!" I burst out.</p>

<p>"Wed? Who said he meant to wed her? He did not; he knew from
Sir Peter Warren who Felicity is; he knew it before we did, and
informed Sir Peter. Wed her? Ay, with the left hand, perhaps."</p>

<p>I rose, trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>"The damned scoundrel!" I stammered. "The damned, foul-fleshed
scoundrel! God! Had I known&mdash;had I dreamed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will control your temper here at least," he said, pointing
to the card-room, where Colonel Guy Johnson and the Border officers
were staring at us through the open doors.</p>

<p>"No, I will not!" I cried. "I care not who hears me! And I say
shame on you for your indecency! Shame on you for your callous,
merciless judgment, when you, God knows, require the mercy you
refuse to others, you damned hypocrite!"</p>

<p>"Silence!" he said, turning livid. "You leave this house to-night
for your regiment."</p>

<p>"I leave it in no service which tolerates such blackguards as
Dunmore or such bloodless criminals as you!" I retorted, tearing
my sword from my belt. Then I stepped forward, and, looking him
straight in the eyes, slammed my sheathed sword down on the table
before him.</p>

<p>"You, your Governors, and your King are too poor to buy the sword
I would wear," I said, between my teeth.</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" he muttered, staring.</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"Not I," I said, gayly, "but the pack o' fools who curse my country
with their folly, like that withered, half-witted Governor of
Virginia, like that pompous ass in Boston, like you yourself,
sir, though God knows it chokes to say it of your father's son!"</p>

<p>"Major Benning," cried Sir John, "you will place that lunatic
under arrest!"</p>

<p>My major started, then took a step towards me.</p>

<p>"Try it!" said I, all the evil in me on fire. "Go to the devil,
sir!&mdash;where your own business is doubtless stewing. Hands off,
sir!&mdash;or I throw you through the window!"</p>

<p>"Good Gad!" muttered Benning. "The lad's gone stark!"</p>

<p>"But I still shoot straight," I said, picking up Sir William's
favourite rifle and handling it most carelessly.</p>

<p>"Mind what you are about!" cried Sir John, furiously. "That piece
is charged!"</p>

<p>"I am happy to know it," I replied, dropping it into the hollow
of my arm so he could look down the black muzzle.</p>

<p>And I walked out of the room and up the stairs to my own little
chamber, there to remove from my body the livery of my King, never
again to resume it.</p>

<p>I spent the day in packing together all articles which were rightly
mine, bought with my own money or given me by Sir William: my
books, my prints, some flutes which I could not play, my rods
and fowling-pieces, all my clothing, my paper and Faber pencil&mdash;all
gifts from Sir William.</p>

<p>I wished also for a memento from his room, something the more
valuable to me because valueless to others, and I found his ivory
cane to take and his leather book, the same being a treatise on
fishing by a certain Isaac Walton, who, if he tells the truth,
knew little about the habits of trout and salmon, and did write
much foolishness in a pretty manner.</p>

<p>However, Sir William loved to read from Isaac Walton his book,
and I have oft heard him singing lustily the catches and ballads
which do abound in that same book&mdash;and to its detriment, in my
opinion.</p>

<p>Laden with these, and also with a scrap of sleeve-ribbon, all
I could find in Silver Heels's chamber, I did make two bundles
of my property, done neatly in blankets. Then, to empty my purse
and strong-box and fill my money-belt, placing there also my letter
of recommendation to the lawyer, Peter Weaver, Esquire, who administered
my investments.</p>

<p>Gillie Bareshanks I hailed from the orchard, bidding him saddle
Warlock with a dragoon's saddle, and place forage for three days
in the saddle-bags, dropping at the same time my riding-coat from
the window, to be rolled and buckled across the pommel.</p>

<p>I dressed me once more in new buckskins, with Mohawk moccasins
and leggings, this to save the wear of travel on my better clothing,
of which I did take but one suit, the same being my silver-gray
velvet, cut with French elegance, and hat to match.</p>

<p>Now, as I looked from the windows, I could see Sir John, Colonel
Guy, and their guests, mounting to ride to the village, doubtless
in order that they should be shown Sir William's last resting-place.
So I, being free of the house, wandered through it from cellar
to attic, because it was to be my last hour in the only home I
had ever known.</p>

<p>Mercifully, though the heart be full to breaking, youth can never
fully realize that the old order has ended forever; else why,
even in bitterest sorrow, glimmers that thread of light through
darkness which we call the last ray of hope? It never leaves us;
men say it flees, but it goes out only with the life that nourished
it.</p>

<p>Deep, deep in my heart I felt that I should look upon these familiar
walls once more, when, in happier days, my dear love and I should
return to the hills we must always love for Sir William's sake.</p>

<p>And so I strayed through the silent, sunny rooms, touching the
walls with aching heart, and bidding each threshold adieu. Ghosts
walked with me through the dimmed sunbeams; far in the house,
faintest familiar sounds seemed to stir, half-heard whispers,
the echo of laughter, a dear voice calling from above. Over these
floors Silver Heels's light feet had passed, brushing every plank,
perhaps the very spot I stood on. Hark! Over and over again that
fading echo filled my ears for an instant, as though somebody
had just spoken in a distant room.</p>

<p>Passing the stocks where Silver Heels had so often sat to pout
and embroider, or battle with us to protect her helpless feet
from torment, I came to the school-room once more.</p>

<p>Apparently nobody had entered it since I had written my verses
on Eurydice&mdash;so long, so long ago. There were traces of the verses
still&mdash;smeared from my struggle with Silver Heels when I had written:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Silver Heels toes in like ducks."

</p>
</div>
<p>Heaven save the libel!</p>

<p>And here on a bench was my tattered mythology, thumbed and bitten,
and the fly-leaf soaked with ink where Peter had made a scene
of battle in Indian fashion, the English being scalped on all
sides by himself, Esk, and Joseph Brant, all labelled.</p>

<p>I took the book, turning to where I had written my bequest to
Silver Heels on the inside cover, and then carried it to my chamber,
there to add this last link of childhood to the others in my packets.</p>

<p>I do not exactly understand why, but I also carried with me the
flag I had taken from Cresap's fort, and rolled it up in my uniform
which was given me by Sir William.</p>

<p>Neither flag nor uniform were any longer mine, yet I ever have
found it impossible to neglect that which I once loved. So I rolled
the bunting and my scarlet clothes with my best silver-gray velvet,
and tied all together.</p>

<p>When young Bareshanks came to announce that Warlock waited, I
bade him carry my two packets down, following, myself, with Sir
William's long rifle, and otherwise completely equipped with hatchet,
knife, powder and ball, flint and tinder, and a small stew-pan.</p>

<p>With these Warlock was laden like a pack-horse, leaving room
in the saddle for me. Bareshanks held my stirrup; I mounted, shook
hands with him, not daring to attempt a word, and, with tears
blinding me, turned my horse's head south on the Albany post-road.</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan, standing near the stables, gazed at me in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Ho!" he called out. "More wood-running, Mr. Cardigan? Faith,
the scalp-trade must be paying in these humming days of peace!"</p>

<p>I tried to smile and gave him my hand.</p>

<p>"It's good-bye forever," I said, choking. "I cannot use the same
roof that shelters my kinsman, Sir John Johnson."</p>

<p>He looked at me very gravely, asking me where I meant to go.</p>

<p>"To Boston," I replied. "I have affairs with one Thomas Foxcroft."</p>

<p>There was a silence, he still holding my hand as though to draw
me back.</p>

<p>"Why to Boston?" he repeated, gently.</p>

<p>"To wed Miss Warren," I replied, looking him in the eyes.</p>

<p>He stared, then caught my hand in both of his.</p>

<p>"God bless her!" he said, again and again. "I give you joy, lad!
She's the sweetest of them all in County Tryon!"</p>

<p>"And in all the world beside!" I muttered, huskily.</p>

<p>And so rode on.</p>
