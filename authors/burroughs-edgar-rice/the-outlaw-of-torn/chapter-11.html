<P>
Several days after Norman of Torn's visit to the castle of Leicester, a
young knight appeared before the Earl's gates demanding admittance to have
speech with Simon de Montfort.  The Earl received him, and as the young man
entered his presence, Simon de Montfort, sprang to his feet in
astonishment.
<P>
"My Lord Prince," he cried.  "What do ye here, and alone ?"
<P>
The young man smiled.
<P>
"I be no prince, My Lord," he said, "though some have said that I favor the
King's son.  I be Roger de Conde, whom it may have pleased your gracious
daughter to mention.  I have come to pay homage to Bertrade de Montfort."
<P>
"Ah," said De Montfort, rising to greet the young knight cordially, "an you
be that Roger de Conde who rescued my daughter from the fellows of Peter of
Colfax, the arms of the De Montforts are open to you.
<P>
"Bertrade has had your name upon her tongue many times since her return.
She will be glad indeed to receive you, as is her father.  She has told us
of your valiant espousal of her cause, and the thanks of her brothers and
mother await you, Roger de Conde.
<P>
"She also told us of your strange likeness to Prince Edward, but until I
saw you, I could not believe two men could be born of different mothers and
yet be so identical.  Come, we will seek out my daughter and her mother."
<P>
De Montfort led the young man to a small chamber where they were greeted by
Princess Eleanor, his wife, and by Bertrade de Montfort.  The girl was
frankly glad to see him once more and laughingly chide him because he had
allowed another to usurp his prerogative and rescue her from Peter of
Colfax.
<P>
"And to think," she cried, "that it should have been Norman of Torn who
fulfilled your duties for you.  But he did not capture Sir Peter's head, my
friend; that is still at large to be brought to me upon a golden dish."
<P>
"I have not forgotten, Lady Bertrade," said Roger de Conde.  "Peter of
Colfax will return."
<P>
The girl glanced at him quickly.
<P>
"The very words of the Outlaw of Torn," she said.  "How many men be ye,
Roger de Conde ?  With raised visor, you could pass in the King's court for
the King's son; and in manner, and form, and swordsmanship, and your visor
lowered, you might easily be hanged for Norman of Torn."
<P>
"And which would it please ye most that I be ?" he laughed.
<P>
"Neither," she answered, "I be satisfied with my friend, Roger de Conde."
<P>
"So ye like not the Devil of Torn ?" he asked.
<P>
"He has done me a great service, and I be under monstrous obligations to
him, but he be, nathless, the Outlaw of Torn and I the daughter of an earl
and a king's sister."
<P>
"A most unbridgeable gulf indeed," commented Roger de Conde, drily.  "Not
even gratitude could lead a king's niece to receive Norman of Torn on a
footing of equality."
<P>
"He has my friendship, always," said the girl, "but I doubt me if Norman of
Torn be the man to impose upon it."
<P>
"One can never tell," said Roger de Conde, "what manner of fool a man may
be.  When a man's head be filled with a pretty face, what room be there for
reason ?"
<P>
"Soon thou wilt be a courtier, if thou keep long at this turning of pretty
compliments," said the girl coldly; "and I like not courtiers, nor their
empty, hypocritical chatter."
<P>
The man laughed.
<P>
"If I turned a compliment, I did not know it," he said.  "What I think, I
say.  It may not be a courtly speech or it may.  I know nothing of courts
and care less, but be it man or maid to whom I speak, I say what is in my
mind or I say nothing.  I did not, in so many words, say that you are
beautiful, but I think it nevertheless, and ye cannot be angry with my poor
eyes if they deceive me into believing that no fairer woman breathes the
air of England.  Nor can you chide my sinful brain that it gladly believes
what mine eyes tell it.  No, you may not be angry so long as I do not tell
you all this."
<P>
Bertrade de Montfort did not know how to answer so ridiculous a sophistry;
and, truth to tell, she was more than pleased to hear from the lips of
Roger de Conde what bored her on the tongues of other men.
<P>
De Conde was the guest of the Earl of Leicester for several days, and
before his visit was terminated, the young man had so won his way into the
good graces of the family that they were loath to see him leave.
<P>
Although denied the society of such as these throughout his entire life,
yet it seemed that he fell as naturally into the ways of their kind as
though he had always been among them.  His starved soul, groping through
the darkness of the empty past, yearned toward the feasting and the light
of friendship, and urged him to turn his back upon the old life, and remain
ever with these people, for Simon de Montfort had offered the young man a
position of trust and honor in his retinue.
<P>
"Why refused you the offer of my father ?" said Bertrade to him as he was
come to bid her farewell.  "Simon de Montfort is as great a man in England
as the King himself, and your future were assured did you attach your self
to his person.  But what am I saying !  Did Roger de Conde not wish to be
elsewhere, he had accepted and, as he did not accept, it is proof positive
that he does not wish to bide among the De Montforts."
<P>
"I would give my soul to the devil," said Norman of Torn, "would it buy me
the right to remain ever at the feet of Bertrade Montfort."
<P>
He raised her hand to his lips in farewell as he started to speak, but
something -- was it an almost imperceptible pressure of her little fingers,
a quickening of her breath or a swaying of her body toward him ?  -- caused
him to pause and raise his eyes to hers.
<P>
For an instant they stood thus, the eyes of the man sinking deep into the
eyes of the maid, and then hers closed and with a little sigh that was half
gasp, she swayed toward him, and the Devil of Torn folded the King's niece
in his mighty arms and his lips placed the seal of a great love upon those
that were upturned to him.
<P>
The touch of those pure lips brought the man to himself.
<P>
"Ah, Bertrade, my Bertrade," he cried, "what is this thing that I have
done !  Forgive me, and let the greatness and the purity of my love for you
plead in extenuation of my act."
<P>
She looked up into his face in surprise, and then placing her strong white
hands upon his shoulders, she whispered:
<P>
"See, Roger, I am not angry.  It is not wrong that we love; tell me it is
not, Roger."
<P>
"You must not say that you love me, Bertrade.  I am a coward, a craven
poltroon; but, God, how I love you."
<P>
"But," said the girl, "I do love -- "
<P>
"Stop," he cried, "not yet, not yet.  Do not say it till I come again.  You
know nothing of me, you do not know even who I be; but when next I come, I
promise that ye shall know as much of me as I myself know, and then,
Bertrade, my Bertrade, if you can then say, 'I love you' no power on earth,
or in heaven above, or hell below shall keep you from being mine !"
<P>
"I will wait, Roger, for I believe in you and trust you.  I do not
understand, but I know that you must have some good reason, though it all
seems very strange to me.  If I, a De Montfort, am willing to acknowledge
my love for any man, there can be no reason why I should not do so,
unless," and she started at the sudden thought, wide-eyed and paling,
"unless there be another woman, a -- a -- wife ?"
<P>
"There is no other woman, Bertrade," said Norman of Torn.  "I have no wife;
nor within the limits of my memory have my lips ever before touched the
lips of another, for I do not remember my mother."
<P>
She sighed a happy little sigh of relief, and laughing lightly, said:
<P>
"It is some old woman's bugaboo that you are haling out of a dark corner of
your imagination to frighten yourself with.  I do not fear, since I know
that you must be all good.  There be no line of vice or deception upon your
face and you are very brave.  So brave and noble a man, Roger, has a heart
of pure gold."
<P>
"Don't," he said, bitterly.  "I cannot endure it.  Wait until I come again
and then, oh my flower of all England, if you have it in your heart to
speak as you are speaking now, the sun of my happiness will be at zenith.
Then, but not before, shall I speak to the Earl, thy father.  Farewell,
Bertrade, in a few days I return."
<P>
"If you would speak to the Earl on such a subject, you insolent young
puppy, you may save your breath," thundered an angry voice, and Simon de
Montfort strode, scowling, into the room.
<P>
The girl paled, but not from fear of her father, for the fighting blood of
the De Montforts was as strong in her as in her sire.  She faced him with
as brave and resolute a face as did the young man, who turned slowly,
fixing De Montfort with level gaze.
<P>
"I heard enough of your words as I was passing through the corridor,"
continued the latter, "to readily guess what had gone before.  So it is for
this that you have wormed your sneaking way into my home ?  And thought you
that Simon de Montfort would throw his daughter at the head of the first
passing rogue ?  Who be ye, but a nameless rascal ?  For aught we know,
some low born lackey.  Get ye hence, and be only thankful that I do not aid
you with the toe of my boot where it would do the most good."
<P>
"Stop !" cried the girl.  "Stop, father, hast forgot that but for Roger de
Conde ye might have seen your daughter a corpse ere now, or, worse, herself
befouled and dishonored ?"
<P>
"I do not forget," replied the Earl, "and.  it is because I remember that
my sword remains in its scabbard.  The fellow has been amply repaid by the
friendship of De Montfort, but now this act of perfidy has wiped clean the
score.  An' you would go in peace, sirrah, go quickly, ere I lose my
temper."
<P>
"There has been some misunderstanding on your part, My Lord," spoke Norman
of Torn, quietly and without apparent anger or excitement.  "Your daughter
has not told me that she loves me, nor did I contemplate asking you for her
hand.  When next I come, first shall I see her and if she will have me, My
Lord, I shall come to you to tell you that I shall wed her.  Norm -- Roger
de Conde asks permission of no man to do what he would do."
<P>
Simon de Montfort was fairly bursting with rage but he managed to control
himself to say,
<P>
"My daughter weds whom I select, and even now I have practically closed
negotiations for her betrothal to Prince Philip, nephew of King Louis of
France.  And as for you, sir, I would as lief see her the wife of the
Outlaw of Torn.  He, at least, has wealth and power, and a name that be
known outside his own armor.  But enough of this; get you gone, nor let me
see your face again within the walls of Leicester's castle."
<P>
"You are right, My Lord, it were foolish and idle for us to be quarreling
with words," said the outlaw.  "Farewell, My Lady.  I shall return as I
promised, and your word shall be law." And with a profound bow to De
Montfort, Norman of Torn left the apartment, and in a few minutes was
riding through the courtyard of the castle toward the main portals.
<P>
As he passed beneath a window in the castle wall, a voice called to him
from above, and drawing in his horse, he looked up into the eyes of
Bertrade de Montfort.
<P>
"Take this, Roger de Conde," she whispered, dropping a tiny parcel to him,
"and wear it ever, for my sake.  We may never meet again, for the Earl my
father, is a mighty man, not easily turned from his decisions; therefore I
shall say to you, Roger de Conde, what you forbid my saying.  I love you,
and be ye prince or scullion, you may have me, if you can find the means to
take me."
<P>
"Wait, my lady, until I return, then shall you decide, and if ye be of the
same mind as today, never fear but that I shall take ye.  Again, farewell."
And with a brave smile that hid a sad heart, Norman of Torn passed out of
the castle yard.
<P>
When he undid the parcel which Bertrade had tossed to him, he found that it
contained a beautifully wrought ring set with a single opal.
<P>
The Outlaw of Torn raised the little circlet to his lips, and then slipped
it upon the third finger of his left hand.
