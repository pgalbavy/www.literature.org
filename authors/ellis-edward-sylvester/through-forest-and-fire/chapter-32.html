<p>"It is growing darker all the time."</p>

<p>"So it seems; I never saw anything like it."</p>

<p>"Maybe it is really night, Nick, and we have lost our reckoning.
Isn't there any way by which the world might swing out of its&mdash;what
do you call it?"</p>

<p>"Orbit, I suppose, you mean; there may be such a way, but from
what I have studied, when it does do that there will be more of
a disturbance than simple darkness like this."</p>

<p>These words were exchanged between brother and sister after they
had penetrated the woods a considerable distance on their return
home. It had become like night around them, except that, as has
been shown, the gloom was of that peculiar lurid nature which
can hardly be described, and can never be forgotten by those who
saw it.</p>

<p>Even Nick Ribsam was impressed. It could not have been otherwise,
for any one would have been lacking in natural sensibility had
he failed to be awed by the singular sight. It can scarcely be
said that the lad was frightened, although there came over him
a yearning feeling that he might hurry home so the family could
all be together, if the awful calamity&mdash;whatever it might be&mdash;should
descend.</p>

<p>It was different with the sister Nellie; her nature was more
impressible, and it was only by a strong effort that she kept
her self-control so long. As she peeped furtively out from the
carriage, she looked at the woods, penetrated by the strange haze,
which perhaps took on a more striking appearance in an autumnal
forest like that, than anywhere else.</p>

<p>"Nick, I believe it's the Last Day that has come."</p>

<p>The lad turned toward his sister, who was sitting far back in
her seat, as though trying to shut out the scene which had such
a fascination for her.</p>

<p>The face of the girl wore such a ghastly color, that Nick could
not wonder at her fright, but he shook his head. He felt he was
the man now, and it would not do for him to show any weakness.</p>

<p>"It isn't the Judgment Day, Nellie; for, according to the Bible,
it will come in a different way than this. There are a good many
things which are not understood by folks, and I suppose this must
be one of them."</p>

<p>"I can smell burning wood," broke in the sister, leaning forward
and snuffing the smoky air.</p>

<p>"I am sure I do, and that's what is making all this trouble."</p>

<p>"But suppose, Nick, these woods are on fire? How far is it back
to where we entered them?"</p>

<p>"About three miles, and it is five to the open country ahead,
where we leave them; but there is the creek, less than a mile
ahead, so if we should find the woods burning, we can stop there
till it is over."</p>

<p>The sister, however, had suggested a danger to the brother which
alarmed him. The mare had been walking slowly, for it seemed more
in harmony with the scene that she should do so. The driver now
jerked the lines so sharply that she pricked up her ears and started
off at a rapid gait, that is as the mare herself doubtless looked
upon traveling.</p>

<p>The first real thrill of alarm came to the lad, when he recalled
that if a fire should appear, he and his sister were in the worst
possible position: there were three miles of forest behind and
five in front.</p>

<p>The mare seemed to awaken to a sense of danger, for she threw
up her head with unusual sprightliness, struck into a trot so
rapid that Nick was a little frightened, lest in the gloom the
carriage should come in contact with some obstruction which he
could not detect in time.</p>

<p>"See there!"</p>

<p>As Nellie uttered the exclamation, she caught the arm of her
brother and pointed ahead, but there was no need of her doing
so, for he had seen the peril. The road immediately in front was
filled with heavy smoke, which, as it rolled forward, caused them
to cough almost to the strangulation point. At the same time,
a crimson streak of flame shot in and out of the murky vapor,
like the flashing of lightning: the fire was burning immediately
in front and it would not do to go further.</p>

<p>Nick stopped the horse, and, half rising and bending forward,
peered into the suffocating vapor. Then he turned and looked behind
him, in which direction Nellie was also gazing.</p>

<p>"How is it there?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There is plenty of smoke, but I see no fire."</p>

<p>"Then we must go back."</p>

<p>The road was quite narrow, though there was room for two teams
to pass each other, and Nick turned the frightened mare as quickly
as he could; she was so nervous and fidgety that it was hard work
to control her, but she was headed toward Dunbarton, after some
difficulty, and as soon as the rein was given her, away she went
at a spanking trot.</p>

<p>But neither the brother nor sister was relieved of fear, for
the smoke grew denser every minute, and Nick might well ask himself
whether he would be able to pass the three miles before he could
reach the safety of the open country.</p>

<p>The question was answered much sooner than he anticipated. The
sharp crackling was heard, and they caught glimpses of the fiery
tongues leaping in and out among the dried leaves and vegetation
on either hand. Suddenly the flames seemed to meet in front in
such a rushing, roaring volume that it was vain to think of pushing
any further in the face of it.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nick," moaned Nellie, shrinking close to him, "we are going
to be burned alive!"</p>

<p>"It does look bad, Nellie, but we mustn't give up yet; one thing
is certain, it won't do to try to reach Dunbarton to-day."</p>

<p>"But we can't go homeward."</p>

<p>"It doesn't look so bad that way as it does toward Dunbarton:
we must try one of the roads, and I would rather work toward home
than away from it."</p>

<p>Nick was busy while talking; he saw that the mare was becoming
panic-stricken, and it required all his strength and firmness
to keep her from breaking away from him.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "O Nick," moaned Nellie, "we are going to be burned
alive."]</p>

<p>By using the whip, he managed to turn her again in the road,
and then he struck her sharply with the lash.</p>

<p>"Nellie, catch hold of my arm," he said to her, feeling that
even if everything came out in the best form, a severe struggle
was before them.</p>

<p>The mare sniffed, and, glancing to her right and left, gave a
whinny of terror as she dropped into her swiftest trot, which,
a minute after, she changed to a gallop; but Nick brought her
down instantly to her more natural gait.</p>

<p>Nellie slipped her arm under the elbow of her brother, and then
clasped her two hands, so as to hold fast for the shock which
she believed would soon come.</p>

<p>A large branch had fallen across the road, and Nick did not catch
sight of it until too late to check the flying mare. The carriage
seemed to bound fully a foot into the air, and an ominous wrench
told the driver that it had suffered material damage.</p>

<p>But there was no time to stop and examine; the terrified horse
sprang into a gallop again, and this time Nick did not restrain
her.</p>

<p>There was smoke all around them; the air was hot and suffocating;
they could hear the crackling of flames, and now and then the
crimson flash through the murky vapor showed that a frightful
forest fire was raging on every hand.</p>

<p>Still the mare kept forward at the same swift gallop, and Nick
knew that more than once she felt the blistering heat on her haunches.
It is a strange peculiarity of the horse, which often shows a
wonderful degree of intelligence, that he generally loses his
wits when caught in a conflagration. Instead of running away from
the flames he often charges among them, and there remains, fighting
those who are trying to save him.</p>

<p>Very probably the mare would have acted similarly in the instance
of which I am speaking had the circumstances permitted it; but
there was fire all about her, and the temptation was as strong,
therefore, in one direction as another.</p>

<p>Nick kept his self-possession. He knew by the desperate energy
with which Nellie clung to his arm that she was helpless, and
that every minute they were likely to plunge headlong into and
among the roaring flames.</p>

<p>He could not guide the mare, which was now controlled by her
own instinctive desire to escape a danger which was on every hand.
He merely sought to direct her, so far as possible, in the hope
that he might save the carriage from being dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>When he saw the flames meeting across the road he shouted to
Nellie to hold her breath, and he did the same, until they had
swept through the fiery, strangling ring, and were able to catch
a mouthful of the smoky and scorching atmosphere beyond.</p>
