<p>Perched on its four stone mushrooms, the little granary stood
two or three feet above the grass of the green close. Beneath
it there was a perpetual shade and a damp growth of long, luxuriant
grasses. Here, in the shadow, in the green dampness, a family
of white ducks had sought shelter from the afternoon sun. Some
stood, preening themselves, some reposed with their long bellies
pressed to the ground, as though the cool grass were water. Little
social noises burst fitfully forth, and from time to time some
pointed tail would execute a brilliant Lisztian tremolo. Suddenly
their jovial repose was shattered. A prodigious thump shook the
wooden flooring above their heads; the whole granary trembled,
little fragments of dirt and crumbled wood rained down among them.
With a loud, continuous quacking the ducks rushed out from beneath
this nameless menace, and did not stay their flight till they
were safely in the farmyard.</p>

<p>"Don’t lose your temper," Anne was saying. "Listen! You’ve frightened
the ducks. Poor dears! no wonder." She was sitting sideways in
a low, wooden chair. Her right elbow rested on the back of the
chair and she supported her cheek on her hand. Her long, slender
body drooped into curves of a lazy grace. She was smiling, and
she looked at Gombauld through half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" Gombauld repeated, and stamped his foot again. He
glared at her round the half-finished portrait on the easel.</p>

<p>"Poor ducks!" Anne repeated. The sound of their quacking was
faint in the distance; it was inaudible.</p>

<p>"Can’t you see you make me lose my time?" he asked. "I can’t
work with you dangling about distractingly like this."</p>

<p>"You’d lose less time if you stopped talking and stamping your
feet and did a little painting for a change. After all, what am
I dangling about for, except to be painted?"</p>

<p>Gombauld made a noise like a growl. "You’re awful," he said,
with conviction. "Why do you ask me to come and stay here? Why
do you tell me you’d like me to paint your portrait?"</p>

<p>"For the simple reasons that I like you&mdash;at least, when you’re
in a good temper&mdash;and that I think you’re a good painter."</p>

<p>"For the simple reason" &mdash;Gombauld mimicked her voice&mdash;"that
you want me to make love to you and, when I do, to have the amusement
of running away."</p>

<p>Anne threw back her head and laughed. "So you think it amuses
me to have to evade your advances! So like a man! If you only
knew how gross and awful and boring men are when they try to make
love and you don’t want them to make love! If you could only see
yourselves through our eyes!"</p>

<p>Gombauld picked up his palette and brushes and attacked his canvas
with the ardour of irritation. "I suppose you’ll be saying next
that you didn’t start the game, that it was I who made the first
advances, and that you were the innocent victim who sat still
and never did anything that could invite or allure me on."</p>

<p>"So like a man again!" said Anne. "It’s always the same old story
about the woman tempting the man. The woman lures, fascinates,
invites; and man&mdash;noble man, innocent man&mdash;falls a victim. My
poor Gombauld! Surely you’re not going to sing that old song again.
It’s so unintelligent, and I always thought you were a man of
sense."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Gombauld.</p>

<p>"Be a little objective," Anne went on. "Can’t you see that you’re
simply externalising your own emotions? That’s what you men are
always doing; it’s so barbarously naive. You feel one of your
loose desires for some woman, and because you desire her strongly
you immediately accuse her of luring you on, of deliberately provoking
and inviting the desire. You have the mentality of savages. You
might just as well say that a plate of strawberries and cream
deliberately lures you on to feel greedy. In ninety-nine cases
out of a hundred women are as passive and innocent as the strawberries
and cream."</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is that this must be the hundredth case,"
said Gombauld, without looking up.</p>

<p>Anne shrugged her shoulders and gave vent to a sigh. "I’m at
a loss to know whether you’re more silly or more rude."</p>

<p>After painting for a little time in silence Gombauld began to
speak again. "And then there’s Denis," he said, renewing the conversation
as though it had only just been broken off. "You’re playing the
same game with him. Why can’t you leave that wretched young man
in peace?"</p>

<p>Anne flushed with a sudden and uncontrollable anger. "It’s perfectly
untrue about Denis," she said indignantly. "I never dreamt of
playing what you beautifully call the same game with him." Recovering
her calm, she added in her ordinary cooing voice and with her
exacerbating smile, "You’ve become very protective towards poor
Denis all of a sudden."</p>

<p>"I have," Gombauld replied, with a gravity that was somehow a
little too solemn. "I don’t like to see a young man..."</p>

<p>"...being whirled along the road to ruin," said Anne, continuing
his sentence for him. "I admire your sentiments and, believe me,
I share them."</p>

<p>She was curiously irritated at what Gombauld had said about Denis.
It happened to be so completely untrue. Gombauld might have some
slight ground for his reproaches. But Denis&mdash;no, she had never
flirted with Denis. Poor boy! He was very sweet. She became somewhat
pensive.</p>

<p>Gombauld painted on with fury. The restlessness of an unsatisfied
desire, which, before, had distracted his mind, making work impossible,
seemed now to have converted itself into a kind of feverish energy.
When it was finished, he told himself, the portrait would be diabolic.
He was painting her in the pose she had naturally adopted at the
first sitting. Seated sideways, her elbow on the back of the chair,
her head and shoulders turned at an angle from the rest of her
body, towards the front, she had fallen into an attitude of indolent
abandonment. He had emphasised the lazy curves of her body; the
lines sagged as they crossed the canvas, the grace of the painted
figure seemed to be melting into a kind of soft decay. The hand
that lay along the knee was as limp as a glove. He was at work
on the face now; it had begun to emerge on the canvas, doll-like
in its regularity and listlessness. It was Anne’s face&mdash;but her
face as it would be, utterly unillumined by the inward lights
of thought and emotion. It was the lazy, expressionless mask which
was sometimes her face. The portrait was terribly like; and at
the same time it was the most malicious of lies. Yes, it would
be diabolic when it was finished, Gombauld decided; he wondered
what she would think of it.</p>
