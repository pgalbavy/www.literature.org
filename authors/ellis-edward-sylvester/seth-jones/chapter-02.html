<p>During the walk homeward, Haverland spoke but few words, although
his loquacious friend kept up a continual, unremitting stream
of talk. The woodman’s heart was too heavy to join him in his
humorous, pointless words. Although dark and fearful suspicions
had flitted before him, he had closed his eyes upon them, until
he could no longer shun them, they appeared at every turn, and
now resumed a terrible certainty.</p>

<p>Although at the time of which we refer, the Revolutionary struggle
of the colonies had closed, and their freedom was placed upon
a firm basis, yet universal peace by no means reigned. Dark, sanguinary,
and bloody tragedies were constantly enacted upon the frontiers
for a generation afterward. The mother country, failing in her
work of subjugation, continued to incite the Indians to revolting
barbarities upon the unoffending inhabitants. They found them
too-willing instruments, and, instigated by them, a protracted
war was long maintained; and, when the moving cause was removed,
the savages still continued the unequal conflict. As every one
acquainted with our history must know, the war on the frontiers
has been an almost interminable one. As the tide of emigration
has rolled westward, it has ever met that fiery counter-surge,
and only overcome it, by incessant battling and effort. And even
now, as the distant shores of the Pacific are well nigh reached,
that resisting wave still gives forth its lurid flashes of conflict.</p>

<p>In a pleasant valley, stood the humble home of Alfred Haverland.
His own vigorous arm had cleared off a space on all sides, so
that his residence stood at some distance from the forest, which
rolled away for miles. In the clearing still remained the stumps
of the fallen trees, and in some places the rich, virgin soil
had been broken, and was giving signs of the exhaustless wealth
it retained in its bosom, waiting only for the hand of man to
bring it forth.</p>

<p>The house itself, was such as are generally found in new settlements.
A number of heavy logs, placed compactly together, with an opening
for a door, and one for a window, were all that could attract
attention from the outside. Within, were two apartments, the lower
and upper. The former was used for all purposes except that of
sleeping, which, of course, was done in the upper. In building
it, Haverland had made little preparations for defence, as he
fondly hoped it would never be needed for such, and it seemed
to him that the idea of danger would ever be before him, should
he construct it thus. And, besides, should he use his utmost skill
in the purpose mentioned, he knew it would avail him little. He
had no means of withstanding a protracted siege, and a handful
of assailants could bring him to any terms.</p>

<p>As he stepped forth into the clearing, Ina, his daughter, caught
sight of him, and bounded out the cabin to meet him.</p>

<p>"Oh, father! I am glad you have come back so soon, but dinner
isn’t ready. Did you think it was? I was just telling mother&#11834;"</p>

<p>She paused suddenly, as she caught sight of a stranger, and with
her hand on her mouth, stood, fearing to approach, and afraid
to yield to the impulse of turning, and running into the house
again.</p>

<p>"No, I didn’t think dinner-time had come, but as I had a friend
to visit me, I thought I could entertain him at home better than
in the woods. But where is your kiss, dear?"</p>

<p>The father stooped, and touched his lips to the ruby ones of
his blooming child, and taking her hand, moved forward toward
the cabin.</p>

<p>"Whew! if that ain’t a purty flower, then kick me!" exclaimed
Seth Jones, in admiration. "Was she originated in these parts?
Darter, I s’pose? Perhaps not, though?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is my daughter, although she was not born in these
parts."</p>

<p>"Dew tell. Darned if she ain’t a beauty, and that makes what
I said&#11834;"</p>

<p>The father motioned to him that the theme was forbidden, and
they walked silently toward the house.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that Ina Haverland drew forth such encomiums
from Seth Jones. She was, indeed, a beautiful creature. She had
seen some fifteen or sixteen summers, several of which had been
spent in the wilderness, which was now her home. She was rather
small in stature, but graceful as a gazelle, free from the restraints
which the conventionalities of life impose upon those of her age.
She had dark hair, gathered in a roll behind, fine expressive
blue eyes, a perfect Grecian nose, thin lips, and full chin, rendering
the profile perfectly straight from the forehead downward. Her
face was oval, and her complexion almost too light for a full
enjoyment of health. Her dress was a semi-civilized one, consisting
of a short skirt, with leggins beautifully wrought, and a loose
sack, similar to the ones worn at the present day. Her small feet
were encased in tiny mocassins, elaborately wrought with beads
and Indian ornaments, and a string of wampum hung around the neck.</p>

<p>She led the way toward the house, and the three entered.</p>

<p>Haverland introduced his friend to his sister and wife, as a
man who had chanced down in this direction, and who would probably
tarry a few days. But the quick eye of his wife caught the thoughtful
expression upon her husband’s face, and she felt there was something
yet unrevealed&mdash;something deeper and more important, that was
to be disclosed. She, however, forbore questioning or hinting,
knowing that he would communicate what was necessary, when he
deemed the proper time had come.</p>

<p>A common-place conversation was maintained until the meal was
prepared by the busy housewife, when they all gathered around
the board. An earnest blessing was invoked upon the humble food,
and it was partaken of in silence.</p>

<p>"Wife," said Haverland tenderly, "I will depart awhile with this
friend here, and you and Mary may busy yourselves as you think
best till I return. Probably I will not be back until toward night.
Take no anxiety upon my account."</p>

<p>"I will endeavor not to, but, dear husband, go not far from home,
for strange fears have come over me since morning."</p>

<p>Even the usually staid and calm face of Mary, betrayed an unusual
expression of anxiety.</p>

<p>"Fear not, wife, I will not go far."</p>

<p>Haverland now stepped outside, where he saw Seth, all agape,
gazing at Ina, as she passed to and fro in the house.</p>

<p>"By gracious, you, I’m goin’ to fall in love with that gal. No
’bjections, hope?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Haverland, with a faint smile, "her heart is unfettered,
and I hope it will remain so for a long time."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don’t mean to love her as you dew yer old woman&mdash;yer wife.
I mean jest as I would my darter, yer know. She’s too small to
think about lovyers <em>yit</em>. Don’t you let <em>sich</em>
a thing git inter her head for five years or more."</p>

<p>"I’ll try not to; but let us take a walk. I have something to
say, which I would that they should not know for the present."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;but jest hold on a minute."</p>

<p>At this juncture, Ina appeared with a small vessel, as if she
intended bringing some water from some spring nigh at hand.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, gal, my beauty," said Seth, stepping forward,
and reaching for the pail. "That’s too big a load for you to carry."</p>

<p>"No, I have done it often, thank you, but it is no work for me."</p>

<p>"But jest let me fetch it <em>this</em> time, if only to show
my good will, and my activity."</p>

<p>Ina laughingly yielded the vessel, and watched him as he took
long, awkward strides toward the point where the path led into
the forest.</p>

<p>"How far is it off?" he asked, turning round, as he reached the
point mentioned.</p>

<p>"A short distance," answered Haverland, "the path leads to it."</p>

<p>Seth made some unintelligible answer, as he jerked his head back
and disappeared.</p>

<p>This simple occurrence that we have just narrated, although trivial
in itself, was one of the circumstances which often controls important
acts, and which seem to show that an all-wise Ruler, orders them
to suit His purpose, and to bring about good in the end. Seth
Jones had no object other than a little amusement in his course,
yet before he returned, he saw how fortunate it was.</p>

<p>He strode rapidly forward, and after passing a short distance,
reached the spring. As he stooped, he was sure he heard a movement
in the bushes beyond; and, as he was about to dip the vessel,
he saw in the smooth face of the water, a movement in the shrubbery.
He had too much cunning and prudence to affect knowledge of it,
and he filled the vessel without betraying any signs of suspicion.
As he rose to the upright position, he gave an apparently careless
sweep of his vision, and not twenty feet distant he saw the crouching
forms of two Indians! As he turned his back, there was a peculiar,
uncomfortable feeling, as he knew that it was the easiest matter
in the world to receive one or two cold bullets. He, however,
quickened his step not in the least, and manifested no uneasiness,
as he came to view in the clearing; and laughingly handed the
water to Ina.</p>

<p>"Come, let us go," said Haverland, moving toward the spring.</p>

<p>"Not that ar way, by a long shot!" said Seth, with a meaning
shake of his head.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I’ll tell you purty soon."</p>

<p>"Let us to the river, then?"</p>

<p>"That’ll do, ’specially <em>as it ain’t fur from your house</em>!"</p>

<p>Haverland looked searchingly at him, and he saw there was a deep
meaning behind these words, yet he said nothing, and led the way
toward the river.</p>

<p>This stream was but a few hundred yards from the house, and flowed
in a northerly and southerly direction. It was very smooth at
this point, and not very wide, yet a mile or so farther down,
it debouched into a large, broad, and deep river. The banks were
lined, most of the distance, by close, impenetrable shrubbery,
overreached by lofty trees, which were the edges of the almost
interminable wilderness that then covered this part of the State,
and of which great portions remain unto the present day.</p>

<p>Haverland moved to a spot where he had often stood and conversed
with his wife, when they first entered the place. Resting his
rifle upon the earth, and folding his arms over the muzzle, he
turned around and looked Seth full in the face.</p>

<p>"What did you mean, by telling me not to <em>go far from</em>
the house?"</p>

<p>"Jest hole on a bit," replied Seth, bending his ear as if to
listen. Haverland watched him earnestly, and he also heard something
unusual&mdash;as if some one were rowing a canoe in the water. His
companion then stepped down to the water’s edge, and signalized
for him to approach. Haverland did so, and looked down the river.
Some hundred yards off he saw a canoe rapidly moving down stream,
impelled by the oars of three Indians!</p>

<p>"That is what I meant," said he in a whisper, stepping back.</p>

<p>"Did you see them?" asked Haverland.</p>

<p>"I reckon I did. They were at the spring, watching for your gal
to come, so that they mought run off with her."</p>
