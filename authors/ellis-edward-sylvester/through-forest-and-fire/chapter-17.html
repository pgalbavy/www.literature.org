<p>The boys were so tired from their severe tramp, and the rest
was so grateful after finishing their dinner, that they stayed
where they were an hour longer. Then, realizing that nothing could
be done by idleness, they slung their reloaded rifles over their
shoulders, took another drink of water, and lazily made their
way to higher ground.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking," said Nick, when they paused again, "that
we will be more likely to learn something of the bear if we separate."</p>

<p>"For how long?" Herbert asked.</p>

<p>"Until night, or until we find him."</p>

<p>"But how can we find each other at night?"</p>

<p>"That can be fixed easily enough; if necessary, we can signal
to each other, or we can pick out some landmark that can be seen
a long ways off and gradually approach that as the sun goes down."</p>

<p>There was nothing brilliant in this proposition, but after some
discussion it was agreed to by the others, and they began looking
around for something which might serve them as a guide.</p>

<p>Directly to the north, the woods rose in a series of hills of
no great elevation, but among them were numerous large rocks of
limestone formation, some of them of such a light color that they
could be seen a long distance.</p>

<p>"Right yonder," said Nick, pointing toward the largest, "is one
which we cannot mistake; let's agree to meet there at nightfall
and go into camp. If either one of us loses his reckoning he will
fire his gun and the others will answer him, so there need be
no danger at all."</p>

<p>"I don't see as there would be any danger if we failed to find
each other before morning," said Sam; "we are not in a wild country
where Indians will hunt for us."</p>

<p>"There ain't any danger," said Herbert, "only it will be a great
deal more pleasant to spend the night together; you will feel
safer by knowing that I am with you with my patent breech-loader."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nick, "for by keeping close to you there won't be
half as much likelihood of being hit when you fire at something
else."</p>

<p>"I haven't tried yet," said Herbert; "my gun is a long-distance
shooter: there's where I get my work in. Show me a mark a good
long distance off and you'll open your eyes."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare, if that doesn't beat all!"</p>

<p>It was Sam Harper who uttered this exclamation. He had been gazing
steadily at a broad, flat rock about a quarter of a mile distant
to the northwest of them, and his words announced that he had
made some important discovery.</p>

<p>The peculiar tone in which he spoke caused the others to turn
toward him and ask the cause.</p>

<p>"Look at that yellowish white rock," he answered, pointing toward
it, "and tell me whether that isn't a little ahead of anything
yet."</p>

<p>One brief searching glance showed that the young man had sufficient
cause for his excitement.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Now I'll show you what my Creedmoor will do,"
said Herbert Watrous.]</p>

<p>Standing on the top of the rock, so that his figure was thrown
in clear relief against the tinted sky behind him, was the very
buck they had been vainly chasing. He seemed to be looking back
at the young hunters as though he disdained their prowess and
defied them to renew their attempt to bring him down.</p>

<p>"<em>That's my chance!</em>" exclaimed Herbert, in excitement;
"that's just my distance; get out of my way! give me room! now
I'll show you what my Creedmoor will do, when aimed by a master
of the art."</p>

<p>With great display and ceremony the youth prepared to give an
exhibition of shooting like that shown at the international matches.
The others stepped back, so as not to impede his movements, and
he deliberately threw off his cap, got down on his back, raised
the rear sight, crossed his feet and drew them half way up to
his body, then rested the barrel of his gun on the support thus
furnished between the knees, and with his left hand beneath his
head, and turned so as to rest against the stock of his gun, while
his right was crooked around with the finger lightly pressing
the trigger, he was in the proper position to make a "crack shot."</p>

<p>The others watched his actions with the closest attention, only
fearful that the deer would not keep his position long enough
for Herbert to obtain the aim he wished.</p>

<p>The conditions could not have been more favorable; the buck being
to the northwest, while the sun was high in the heavens, there
was no confusion of vision from that cause. The smokiness of the
atmosphere was so slight that it was scarcely perceptible at so
brief a distance, while there was not the least breath of air
stirring.</p>

<p>"I am afraid he will lose his chance if he waits too long," said
Nick impatiently, in an undertone to Sam, who whispered back:</p>

<p>"The buck understands him and will wait."</p>

<p>It was evident that Mr. Herbert Watrous did not mean to spoil
his aim by haste. Shutting one eye, he squinted carefully through
his sights, lowering or raising the stock or barrel so as to shift
the aim, until at last he had it elevated and pointed to suit
him.</p>

<p>Sam watched the buck, while Nick kept his eye on the marksman,
who was holding his breath, with his finger crowding the trigger
harder and harder until the explosion came.</p>

<p>As before, Herbert uttered a grunt the instant the piece was
discharged, and then, hastily clambering to his feet, he put on
his cap and said with the utmost assurance:</p>

<p>"That bullet struck him in the chest and will be found buried
in his body."</p>

<p>"He doesn't know you fired at him," said Sam Harper, as the buck,
a moment later, turned about and walked out of sight.</p>

<p>"The deer doesn't fall at once, even if you drive the bullet
through his heart. That buck may go a hundred yards or so, but
he will then drop as if struck by lightning."</p>

<p>The confidence with which these words were uttered puzzled Nick
and caused him to think that possibly the boaster was right after
all, and he had made the shot he claimed.</p>

<p>The truth would probably be learned during the afternoon, for
Nick meant to learn it for himself.</p>

<p>Now that they agreed to separate, it was decided that Herbert
should keep straight along the route they had been following.
Sam should diverge to the right, while Nick would swerve far enough
to the left to pass the rock whereupon the buck stood at the time
he was shot or rather shot at.</p>

<p>"I am bound to find out the truth," said Nick, with a shake of
the head.</p>

<p>And so he did; but little did he dream of what was to happen
to him during this search for the truth.</p>
