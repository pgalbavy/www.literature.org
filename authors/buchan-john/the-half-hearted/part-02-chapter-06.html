<p>When Lewis had finished breakfast next morning, and was sitting
idly on the verandah watching the busy life of the bazaar at his
feet, a letter was brought him by a hotel servant. "It was left
for you by Marker Sahib, when he went away this morning. He sent
his compliments to the sahibs and regretted that he had to leave
too early to speak with them, but he left this note." Lewis broke
the envelope and read:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>DEAR MR. HAYSTOUN</em>,

</p>
<p>
When I was thinking over our conversation last night, chance put a<br/>
piece of information in my way which you may think fit to use. You<br/>
know that I am more intimate than most people with the hill tribes.<br/>
Well, let this be the guarantee of my news, but do not ask how I<br/>
got it, for I cannot betray friends. Some of these, the Bada-Mawidi<br/>
to wit, are meditating mischief. The Forza camp, which I think you<br/>
have visited&mdash;a place some twenty miles off&mdash;is too near those<br/>
villages to be safe. So to-morrow at latest they have planned to<br/>
make a general attack upon it, and, unless the garrison were<br/>
prepared, I should fear for the result, for they are the most<br/>
cunning scoundrels in the world. What puzzles me is how they have<br/>
ever screwed up the courage for such a move, for lately they were<br/>
very much in fear of the Government. It appears as if they looked<br/>
for backing from over the frontier. You will say that this proves<br/>
your theory; but to me it merely seems as if some maniac of the<br/>
Gromchevtsky type had got among them. In any case I wish something<br/>
could be done. My duties take me away at once, and in a very<br/>
different direction, but perhaps you could find some means of<br/>
putting the camp on their guard. I should be sorry to hear of a<br/>
tragedy; also I should be sorry to see the Bada-Mawidi get into<br/>
trouble. They are foolish blackguards, but amusing.

</p>
<p>
Yours most sincerely,

</p>
<p>
<em>ARTHUR MARKER</em>.<br/>

<p>Lewis read the strange letter several times through, then passed
it to George. George read it with difficulty, not being accustomed
to a flowing frontier hand. "Jolly decent of him, I call it,"
was his remark.</p>

<p>"I would give a lot to know what to make of it. The man is playing
some game, but what the deuce it is I can't fathom."</p>

<p>"I suppose we had better get up to that Forza place as soon as
we can."</p>

<p>"I think not," said Lewis.</p>

<p>"The man's honest, surely?"</p>

<p>"But he is also clever. Remember who he is. He may wish to get
us out of the way. I don't suppose that he can possibly fear us,
but he may want the coast clear from suspicious spectators. Besides,
I don't see the good of Forza. It is not the part of the hills
I want to explore. There can be no frontier danger there, and
at the worst there can be nothing more than a little tribal disturbance.
Now what on earth would Russia gain by moving the tribes there,
except as a blind?"</p>

<p>"Still, you know, the man admits all that in his letter. And
if the people up there are going to be in trouble we ought to
go and give them notice."</p>

<p>"I'll take an hour to think over it, and then I'll go and see
Thwaite. He was to be back this morning."</p>

<p>Lewis spread the letter before him. It was a simple, friendly
note, giving him a chance of doing a good turn to friends. His
clear course was to lay it before Thwaite and shift the responsibility
for action to his shoulders. But he felt all the while that this
letter had a personal application which he could not conceal.
It would have been as easy for Marker to send the note to Thwaite,
whom he had long known. But he had chosen to warn him privately.
It might be a ruse, but he had no glimpse of the meaning. Or,
again, it might be a piece of pure friendliness, a chance of unofficial
adventure given by one wanderer to another. He puzzled it out,
lamenting that he was so deep in the dark, and cursing his indecision.
Another man would have made up his mind long ago; it was a ruse,
therefore let it be neglected and remain in Bardur with open eyes;
it was good faith and a good chance, therefore let him go at once.
But to Lewis the possibilities seemed endless, and he could find
no solution save the old one of the waverer, to wait for further
light.</p>

<p>He found Thwaite at breakfast, just returned from his travels.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Haystoun. I heard you were here. Awfully glad to see
you. Sit down, won't you, and have some breakfast." The officer
was a long man, with a thin, long face, a reddish moustache, and
small, blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I came to ask you questions, if you don't mind. I have the regular
globe-trotter's trick of wanting information. What's the Forza
camp like? Do you think that the Bada-Mawidi, supposing they stir
again, would be likely to attack it?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. That was the sort of thing that Gribton was
always croaking about. Why, man, the Bada-Mawidi haven't a kick
in them. Besides, they are very nearly twenty miles off and the
garrison's a very fit lot. They're all right. Trust them to look
after themselves."</p>

<p>"But I have been hearing stories of Bada-Mawidi risings which
are to come off soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll always hear stories of that sort. All the old women
in the neighbourhood purvey them."</p>

<p>"Who are in charge at Forza?"</p>

<p>"Holm and Andover. Don't care much for Holm, but Andy is a good
chap. But what's this new interest of yours? Are you going up
there?</p>

<p>"I'm out here to shoot and explore, you know, so Forza comes
into my beat. Thanks very much. See you to-night, I suppose."</p>

<p>Lewis went away dispirited and out of temper. He had been pitchforked
among easy-going people, when all the while mysterious things,
dangerous things, seemed to hang in the air. He had not the material
for even the first stages of comprehension. No one suspected,
every one was satisfied; and at the same time came those broken
hints of other things. He felt choked and muffled, wrapped in
the cotton-wool of this easy life; and all the afternoon he chafed
at his own impotence and the world's stupidity.</p>

<p>When the two travellers presented themselves at the Logans' house
that evening, they were immediately seized upon by the hostess
and compelled, to their amusement, to do her bidding. They were
her discoveries, her new young men, and as such, they had their
responsibilities. George, who liked dancing, obeyed meekly; but
Lewis, being out of temper and seeing before him an endless succession
of wearisome partners, soon broke loose, and accompanied Thwaite
to the verandah for a cigar.</p>

<p>The man was ill at ease, and the sight of young faces and the
sound of laughter vexed him with a sense of his eccentricity.
He could never, like George, take the world as he found it. At
home he was the slave of his own incapacity; now he was the slave
of memories. He had come out on an errand, with a chance to recover
his lost self-respect, and lo! he was as far as ever from attainment.
His lost capacity for action was not to be found here, in the
midst of this petty diplomacy and inglorious ease.</p>

<p>From the verandah a broad belt of lawn ran down to the edge of
the north road. It lay shining in the moonlight like a field of
snow with the highway a dark ribbon beyond it. Thwaite and Lewis
walked down to the gate talking casually, and at the gate they
stopped and looked down on the town. It lay a little to the left,
the fort rising black before it, and the road ending in a patch
of shade which was the old town gate. The night was very still,
cool airs blew noiselessly from the hills, and a jackal barked
hoarsely in some far-off thicket.</p>

<p>The men hung listlessly on the gate, drinking in the cool air
and watching the blue cigar smoke wreathe and fade. Suddenly down
the road there came the sound of wheels.</p>

<p>"That's a tonga," said Thwaite. "Wonder who it is."</p>

<p>"Do tongas travel this road?" Lewis asked.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, they go ten miles up to the foot of the rocks. We use
them for sending up odds and ends to the garrisons. After that
coolies are the only conveyance. Gad, I believe this thing is
going to stop."</p>

<p>The thing in question, which was driven by a sepoy in bright
yellow pyjamas, stopped at the Logans' gate. A peevish voice was
heard giving directions from within.</p>

<p>"It sounds like Holm," said Thwaite, walking up to it, "and upon
my soul it is Holm. What on earth are you doing here, my dear
fellow?"</p>

<p>"Is that you, Thwaite?" said the voice. "I wish you'd help me
out. I want Logan to give me a bed for the night. I'm infernally
ill."</p>

<p>Lewis looked within and saw a pale face and bloodshot eyes which
did not belie the words.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Thwaite. "Fever or anything smashed?"</p>

<p>"I've got a bullet in my leg which has got to be cut out. Got
it two days ago when I was out shooting. Some natives up in the
rocks did it, I fancy. Lord, how it hurts." And the unhappy man
groaned as he tried to move.</p>

<p>"That's bad," said Thwaite sympathetically. "The Logans have
got a dance on, but we'll look after you all right. How did you
leave things in Forza?"</p>

<p>"Bad. I oughtn't to be here, but Andy insisted. He said I would
only get worse and crock entirely. Things look a bit wild up there
just now. There has been a confounded lot of rifle-stealing, and
the Bada-Mawidi are troublesome. However, I hope it's only their
fun."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Thwaite. "You know Haystoun, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you," said the man. "Heard of you. Coming up our
way? I hope you will after I get this beastly leg of mine better."</p>

<p>"Thwaite will tell you I have been cross-examining him about
your place. I wanted badly to ask you about it, for I got a letter
this morning from a man called Marker with some news for you."</p>

<p>"What did he say?" asked Holm sharply.</p>

<p>"He said that he had heard privately that the Bada-Mawidi were
planning an attack on you to-morrow or the day after."</p>

<p>"The deuce they are," said Holm peevishly, and Thwaite's face
lengthened.</p>

<p>"And he told me to find some way of letting you know."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you tell me earlier?" said Thwaite. "Marker
should know if anybody does. We should have kept Holm up there.
Now it's almost too late. Oh, this is the devil!"</p>

<p>Lewis held his peace. He had forgotten the solidity of Marker's
reputation.</p>

<p>"What's the chances of the place?" Thwaite was asking. "I know
your numbers and all that, but are they anything like prepared?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Holm miserably. "They might get on all right,
but everybody is pretty slack just now. Andy has a touch of fever,
and some of the men may get leave for shooting. I must get back
at once."</p>

<p>"You can't. Why, man, you couldn't get half way. And what's more,
I can't go. This place wants all the looking after it can get.
A row in the hills means a very good possibility of a row in Bardur,
and that is too dangerous a game. And besides myself there is
scarcely a man in the place who counts. Logan has gone to Gilgit,
and there's nobody left but boys."</p>

<p>"If you don't mind I should like to go," said Lewis shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"You," they cried. "Do you know the road?"</p>

<p>"I've been there before, and I remember it more or less. Besides,
it is really my show this time. I got the warning, and I want
the credit." And he smiled.</p>

<p>"The road's bound to be risky," said Thwaite thoughtfully. "I
don't feel inclined to let you run your neck into danger like
this."</p>

<p>Lewis was busy turning over the problem in his mind. The presence
of the man Holm seemed the one link of proof he needed. He had
his word that there were signs of trouble in the place, and that
the Bada-Mawidi were ill at ease. Whatever game Marker was playing,
on this matter he seemed to have spoken in good faith. Here was
a clear piece of work for him. And even if it was fruitless it
would bring him nearer to the frontier; his expedition to the
north would be begun.</p>

<p>"Let me go," he said. "I came out here to explore the hills and
I take all risks on my own head. I can give them Marker's message
as well as anybody else."</p>

<p>Thwaite looked at Holm. "I don't see why he shouldn't. You're
a wreck, and I can't leave my own place."</p>

<p>"Tell Andy you saw me," cried Holm. "He'll be anxious. And tell
him to mind the north gate. If the fools knew how to use dynamite
they might have it down at once. If they attack it can't last
long, but then they can't last long either, for they are hard
up for arms, and unless they have changed since last week they
have no ammunition to speak of."</p>

<p>"Marker said it looked as if they were being put up to the job
from over the frontier."</p>

<p>"Gad, then it's my turn to look out," said Thwaite. "If it's
the gentlemen from over the frontier they won't stop at Forza.
Lord, I hate this border business, it's so hideously in the dark.
But I think that's all rot. Any tribal row here is sure to be
set down to Russian influence. We don't understand the joint possession
of an artificial frontier," he added, with an air of quoting from
some book.</p>

<p>"Did you get that from Marker?" Holm asked crossly. "He once
said the same thing to me." His temper had suffered badly among
the hills.</p>

<p>"We'd better get you to bed, my dear fellow," said Thwaite, looking
down at him. "You look remarkably cheap. Would you mind going
in and trying to find Mrs. Logan, Haystoun? I'll carry this chap
in. Stop a minute, though. Perhaps he's got something to say to
you."</p>

<p>"Mind the north gate ... tell Andy I'm all right and make him
look after himself ... he's overworking ... if you want to send
a message to the other people you'd better send by Nazri ... if
the Badas mean business they'll shut up the road you go by. That's
all. Good luck and thanks very much."</p>

<p>Lewis found Mrs. Logan making a final inspection of the supper-room.
She ran to the garden, to find the invalid Holm in Thwaite's arms
at the steps of the verandah. The sick warrior pulled off an imaginary
cap and smiled feebly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Holm, I'm so sorry. Of course we can have you. I'll
put you in the other end of the house where you won't be so much
troubled with the noise. You must have had a dreadful journey."
And so forth, with the easy condolences of a kind woman.</p>

<p>When Thwaite had laid down his burden, he turned to Lewis.</p>

<p>"I wish we had another man, Haystoun. What about your friend
Winterham? One's enough to do your work, but if the thing turns
out to be serious, there ought to be some means of sending word.
Andover will want you to stay, for they are short-handed enough."</p>

<p>"I'll get Winterham to go and wait for me somewhere. If I don't
turn up by a certain time, he can come and look for me."</p>

<p>"That will do," said Thwaite, "though it's a stale job for him.
Well, good-bye and good luck to you. I expect there won't be much
trouble, but I wish you had told us in the morning."</p>

<p>Lewis turned to go and find George. "What a chance I had almost
missed," was the word in his heart. The errand might be futile,
the message a blind, but it was at least movement, action, a possibility.</p>
