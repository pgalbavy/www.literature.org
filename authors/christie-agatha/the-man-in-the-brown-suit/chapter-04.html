<p>Nobody came forward to identify the dead woman. The inquest elicited
the following facts.
</p>
<p>Shortly after one o’clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with
a slight foreign accent had entered the offices of Messrs. Butler
and Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge. She explained that she
wanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach
of London. The particulars of several were given to her, including
those of the Mill House. She gave the name of Mrs. de Castina and
her address as the Ritz, but there proved to be no one of that name
staying there, and the hotel people failed to identify the body.
</p><p>Mrs. James, the wife of Sir Eustace Pedler’s gardener, who acted
as caretaker to the Mill House and inhabited the small lodge
opening on the main road, gave evidence. About three o’clock that
afternoon, a lady came to see over the house. She produced an order
from the house-agents, and, as was the usual custom, Mrs. James
gave her the keys of the house. It was situated at some distance
from the lodge, and she was not in the habit of accompanying
prospective tenants. A few minutes later a young man arrived. Mrs.
James described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a bronzed
face and light grey eyes. He was clean-shaven and was wearing a
brown suit. He explained to Mrs. James that he was a friend of the
lady who had come to look over the house, but had stopped at the
post office to send a telegram. She directed him to the house, and
thought no more about the matter.
</p><p>Five minutes later he reappeared, handed her back the keys and
explained that he feared the house would not suit them. Mrs. James
did not see the lady, but thought that she had gone on ahead. What
she did notice was that the young man seemed very much upset about
something. “He looked like a man who’d seen a ghost. I thought he
was taken ill.”
</p><p>On the following day another lady and gentleman came to see the
property and discovered the body lying on the floor in one of the
upstairs rooms. Mrs. James identified it as that of the lady who
had come the day before. The house-agents also recognized it as
that of “Mrs. de Castina.” The police surgeon gave it as his
opinion that the woman had been dead about twenty-four hours. The
<u>Daily Budget</u> had jumped to the conclusion that the man in the
Tube had murdered the woman and afterwards committed suicide.
However, as the Tube victim was dead at two o’clock, and the woman
was alive and well at three o’clock, the only logical conclusion
to come to was that the two occurrences had nothing to do with each
other, and that the order to view the house at Marlow found in the
dead man’s pocket was merely one of those coincidences which so
often occur in this life.
</p><p>A verdict of “Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown”
was returned, and the police (and the <u>Daily Budget</u>) were left to
look for “the man in the brown suit.” Since Mrs. James was positive
that there was no one in the house when the lady entered it, and
that nobody except the young man in question entered it until the
following afternoon, it seemed only logical to conclude that he
was the murderer of the unfortunate Mrs. de Castina. She had been
strangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been
caught unawares with no time to cry out. The black silk handbag
which she carried contained a well-filled notecase and some loose
change, a fine lace handkerchief, unmarked, and the return half of
a first-class ticket to London. Nothing much there to go upon.
</p><p>Such were the details published broadcast by the _Daily Budget,_
and “Find the Man in the Brown Suit” was their daily war-cry. On
an average about five hundred people wrote daily to announce their
success in the quest, and tall young men with well-tanned faces
cursed the day when their tailors had persuaded them to a brown
suit. The accident in the Tube, dismissed as a coincidence, faded
out of the public mind.
</p><p>Was it a coincidence? I was not so sure. No doubt I was
prejudiced—the Tube incident was my own pet mystery—but there
certainly seemed to me to be a connection of some kind between the
two fatalities. In each there was a man with a tanned face—evidently
an Englishman living abroad, and there were other things. It was
the consideration of these other things that finally impelled me
to what I considered a dashing step. I presented myself at Scotland
Yard and demanded to see whoever was in charge of the Mill House
case.
</p><p>My request took some time to understand, as I had inadvertently
selected the department for lost umbrellas, but eventually I was
ushered into a small room and presented to Detective Inspector
Meadows.
</p><p>Inspector Meadows was a small man with a ginger head and what I
considered a peculiarly irritating manner. A satellite, also in
plain clothes, sat unobtrusively in a corner.
</p><p>“Good morning,” I said nervously.
</p><p>“Good morning. Will you take a seat? I understand you’ve something
to tell me that you think may be of use to us.”
</p><p>His tone seemed to indicate that such a thing was unlikely in the
extreme. I felt my temper stirred.
</p><p>“Of course you know about the man who was killed in the Tube? The
man who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his
pocket.”
</p><p>“Ah!” said the inspector. “You are the Miss Beddingfeld who gave
evidence at the inquest. Certainly the man had an order in his
pocket. A lot of other people may have had too—only they didn’t
happen to be killed.”
</p><p>I rallied my forces.
</p><p>“You don’t think it odd that this man had no ticket in his pocket?”
</p><p>“Easiest thing in the world to drop your ticket. Done it myself.”
</p><p>“And no money.”
</p><p>“He had some loose change in his trousers pocket.”
</p><p>“But no notecase.”
</p><p>“Some men don’t carry a pocket-book or notecase of any kind.”
</p><p>I tried another tack.
</p><p>“You don’t think it’s odd that the doctor never came forward
afterwards?”
</p><p>“A busy medical man very often doesn’t read the papers. He probably
forgot all about the accident.”
</p><p>“In fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd,” I
said sweetly.
</p><p>“Well, I’m inclined to think you’re a little too fond of the word,
Miss Beddingfeld. Young ladies are romantic, I know—fond of
mysteries and such-like. But as I’m a busy man——”
</p><p>I took the hint and rose.
</p><p>The man in the corner raised a meek voice.
</p><p>“Perhaps the young lady would tell us briefly what her ideas really
are on the subject, inspector?”
</p><p>The inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough.
</p><p>“Yes, come now, Miss Beddingfeld, don’t be offended. You’ve asked
questions and hinted things. Just say straight out what it is
you’ve got in your head.”
</p><p>I wavered between injured dignity and the overwhelming desire to
express my theories. Injured dignity went to the wall.
</p><p>“You said at the inquest you were positive it wasn’t suicide?”
</p><p>“Yes, I’m quite certain of that. The man was frightened. What
frightened him? It wasn’t me. But some one might have been walking
up the platform towards us—some one he recognized.”
</p><p>“You didn’t see any one?”
</p><p>“No,” I admitted. “I didn’t turn my head. Then, as soon as the body
was recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it,
saying he was a doctor.”
</p><p>“Nothing unusual in that,” said the inspector dryly.
</p><p>“But he wasn’t a doctor.”
</p><p>“What?”
</p><p>“He wasn’t a doctor,” I repeated.
</p><p>“How do you know that, Miss Beddingfeld?”
</p><p>“It’s difficult to say, exactly. I’ve worked in Hospital during
the war, and I’ve seen doctors handle bodies. There’s a sort of
deft professional callousness that this man hadn’t got. Besides,
a doctor doesn’t usually feel for the heart on the right side of
the body.”
</p><p>“He did that?”
</p><p>“Yes, I didn’t notice it specially at the time—except that I felt
there was something wrong. But I worked it out when I got home,
and then I saw why the whole thing had looked so unhandy to me at
the time.”
</p><p>“H’m,” said the inspector. He was reaching slowly for pen and
paper.
</p><p>“In running his hands over the upper part of the man’s body he
would have ample opportunity to take anything he wanted from the
pockets.”
</p><p>“Doesn’t sound likely to me,” said the inspector. “But—well, can
you describe him at all?”
</p><p>“He was tall and broad-shouldered, wore a dark overcoat and black
boots, a bowler hat. He had a dark pointed beard and gold-rimmed
eyeglasses.”
</p><p>“Take away the overcoat, the beard and the eyeglasses, and there
wouldn’t be much to know him by,” grumbled the inspector. “He could
alter his appearance easy enough in five minutes if he wanted
to—which he would do if he’s the swell pickpocket you suggest.”
</p><p>I had not intended to suggest anything of the kind. But from this
moment I gave the inspector up as hopeless.
</p><p>“Nothing more you can tell us about him?” he demanded, as I rose
to depart.
</p><p>“Yes,” I said. I seized my opportunity to fire a parting shot. “His
head was markedly brachycephalic. He will not find it so easy to
alter that.”
</p><p>I observed with pleasure that Inspector Meadow’s pen wavered. It
was clear that he did not know how to spell brachycephalic.
