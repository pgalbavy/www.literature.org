<p><em>EPH BOZEMAN </em>was so familiar with the Pecos River, from
its source in the Rocky Mountains to its junction with the Rio
Grande, that he conducted his friends to a fording place, where
it was crossed without any of them wetting their feet. Riding
up the opposite bank, they started across the comparatively level
country, and by the middle of the afternoon struck a piece of
grazing ground, which the hunters told him belonged to the ranch
that the banker, Mr. Lord, had sent Strubell and Lattin to inspect.</p>

<p>The lands were so extensive that there were many portions from
which not the first glimpse could be gained of the adobe structure
that was erected nearly a half century before.</p>

<p>The little party pushed onward, and before the sun dipped below
the horizon began the ascent of a moderate slope, from the top
of which the coveted view could be obtained.</p>

<p>Since Rickard and his companion must have known of the pursuit,
they would be on the lookout for the Texans, who were eager to
befriend Nick Ribsam. It was decided not to allow them to know
the cowboys had arrived in the vicinity before the following day.
Strubell hinted that important events might be brought about between
the setting and the rising of the sun.</p>

<p>Herbert, who began to feel a natural nervousness as the crisis
approached, made several inquiries about Jim-John, the half-breed,
and his companion, who had been left behind. Were they not likely
to abandon the pack horses on discovering they had been flanked
by the Texans, and hasten to the help of the couple that had been
the first to cross over from Western Texas to New Mexico? But
when Eph Bozeman agreed with Strubell and Lattin that there was
nothing to be feared of that nature, Herbert bade good-by to his
fears and fixed his attention on that which was in front.</p>

<p>Leaving their animals in the hollow, where they were safe against
disturbance, the four climbed the elevation, the youth carrying
one field glass, while Strubell had the other. The trapper had
never used anything of the kind, and refused to do so now. He
claimed that his eyes were as good as ever—and he was undoubtedly
right—and he needed no artificial aid.</p>

<p>It looked like useless precaution, but on reaching the crest
the party crouched low in order to render themselves less conspicuous.</p>

<p>"Thar she is!" said old Eph, extending his left hand to westward,
while his right grasped his inseparable rifle; "and I’ll bet them
new-fangled machines won’t show you anything more than I see this
very minute."</p>

<p>A mile away stood a broad, firm building, of a slatish yellow
color as seen through the clear air. It was of adobe or sun-dried
bricks, which, in the course of time, had become compact and hard
enough to resist a bombardment of six-pounders better than many
forts erected for that purpose.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>A mile away stood a broad, firm building.</em>"  
Page 224.]</p>

<p>The land immediately surrounding the structure was smooth and
quite level, and covered with grass which wore a soft, beautiful
tint, mellowed by the intervening distance. On the further side
of the building were a few bushes, bearing a resemblance to the
well known mesquite growth so common in many portions of the Southwest.</p>

<p>These were the main features of the scene when viewed by the
unaided eye, but the helpful field glass added something.</p>

<p>Lying on his face, with his instrument pointed at the building,
Herbert Watrous studied it closely. He offered the instrument
to Lattin, but he, seeing how much the youth was interested, declined,
and waited until Strubell was ready to pass the other to him.</p>

<p>The youth noted the broad door in the middle, with a small narrow
window on either side of the upper story. The front was like that
of an immense box, there being little slope to the roof. It was
probably one of those mission houses built in the preceding century
by the Jesuits, who devoted their lives to the conversion of the
Indians, and that, having been abandoned by them as civilization
advanced, had been taken possession of by those who secured a
claim to the extensive tract which surrounded it.</p>

<p>Being questioned on this point, Bozeman as well as the Texans
replied that such was undoubtedly the fact, for it was far different
from the flimsy structures of wood used by ranchmen in other sections.
There was a court inside, after the fashion of the older houses
in Spanish countries, the building itself enclosing this open
space, so that when manned by only a few, it was capable of withstanding
the attack of a large force.</p>

<p>Bozeman stated further that the ranch was abandoned because of
the Indians. While the men who made their homes there were safe
so long as they stayed behind the wall, they could not afford
to remain there. Hundreds of cattle had been killed or run off
by the Apaches, whose chief hunting grounds are further west,
until the ranchmen who essayed the business became discouraged
and gave it up.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the place had been allowed to run to waste
for years. During that time the grazing had improved, though a
large part of the thousands of acres had paid tribute to other
cattlemen. Besides this, the marauding Apaches, with which our
government was having much trouble at that time, were mainly in
the western part of the territory and in Arizona. This made the
ranch so inviting that it was beginning to attract attention,
and when Mr. Lord, in San Antonio, was offered it for what was
really a small sum, he was warranted in sending a couple of trustworthy
experts to examine and report upon it.</p>

<p>This was the destination toward which the Texans and Herbert
Watrous had been riding through many long days, and that was now
in sight. By a strange order of things, which at present he could
not understand, the ranch was the objective point also of the
two evil men who held Nick Ribsam as prisoner.</p>

<p>He had puzzled his brain many times to read the meaning of all
this; but though he had formed his theory, he forced himself to
be content to wait until the Texans or events themselves should
reveal the truth.</p>

<p>The most careful scrutiny of the front and eastern side of the
adobe building failed to show any sign of life. That, however,
was no proof that it was not there. The horsemen might have ridden
abreast through the broad door, closing it after them, placed
their horses within the numerous quarters facing the court within,
and then, climbing to the roof, watch the eastern horizon for
a sign of their pursuers.</p>

<p>Fully ten minutes passed without a word being spoken by our friends,
who were inspecting the building from the crest of the elevation.
They were so intent on their work that nothing else was thought
of.</p>

<p>Having studied every foot that was visible, Herbert went over
it again several times, but with no better success than at first.
He was gifted with fine eyesight, and, when he finally lowered
his glass with a sigh, he glanced across at Strubell, who, having
passed the other instrument to Lattin, was looking expectantly
into the face of the youth.</p>

<p>"How did you make out?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I couldn’t find anything at all," replied Herbert. "Did you?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes; Rickard, Slidham, and Nick are there, but a bigger
surprise awaits <em>them</em> than <em>us</em>."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Point your glass over to the left," replied the Texan, "and
I think you will see something that will surprise you."</p>
