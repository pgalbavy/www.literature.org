<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Miss Elliott's expression, when I turned to observe the effect
of the intruder upon her, was found to be one of brilliant delight.
With glowing eyes, her lips parted in a breathless ecstasy, she
gazed upon the newcomer, evidently fearing to lose a syllable
that fell from his lips. Moving closer to me she whispered urgently:</p>

<p>"Keep him. Oh, keep him!"</p>

<p>To detain him, for a time at least, was my intention, though
my motive was not merely to afford her pleasure. The advent of
the young man had produced a singularly disagreeable impression
upon me, quite apart from any antagonism I might have felt toward
him as a type. Strange suspicions leaped into my mind, formless&mdash;in
the surprise of the moment&mdash;but rapidly groping toward definite
outline; and following hard upon them crept a tingling apprehension.
The reappearance of this rattish youth, casual as was the air
with which he strove to invest it, began to assume, for me, the
character of a theatrical entrance of unpleasant portent&mdash;a suggestion
just now enhanced by an absurdly obvious notion of his own that
he was enacting a part. This was written all over him, most legibly
in his attitude of the knowing amateur, as he surveyed Miss Elliott's
painting patronisingly, his head on one side, his cane in the
crook of his elbows behind his back, and his body teetering genteelly
as he shifted his weight from his toes to his heels and back again,
nodding meanwhile a slight but judicial approbation.</p>

<p>"Now, about how much," he said slowly, "would you expec' t' git
f'r a pitcher that size?"</p>

<p>"It isn't mine," I informed him.</p>

<p>"You don't tell me it's the little lady's&mdash;what?" He bowed genially
and favoured Miss Elliott with a stare of warm admiration. "Pretty
a thing as I ever see," he added.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried with an ardour that choked her slightly. "<em>THANK
</em>you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I meant the <em>PITCHER!" </em>he said hastily, evidently
nonplussed by a gratitude so fervent.</p>

<p>The incorrigible damsel cast down her eyes in modesty. "And I
had hoped," she breathed, "something so different!"</p>

<p>I could not be certain whether or not he caught the whisper;
I thought he did. At all events, the surface of his easy assurance
appeared somewhat disarranged; and, perhaps to restore it by performing
the rites of etiquette, he said:</p>

<p>"Well, I expec' the smart thing now is to pass the cards, but
mine's in my grip an' it ain't unpacked yet. The name you'd see
on 'em is Oil Poicy."</p>

<p>"Oil Poicy," echoed Miss Elliott, turning to me in genuine astonishment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Earl Percy," I translated.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>RAPTUROUS!" </em>she cried, her face radiant. "And <em>WON'T
</em>Mr. Percy give us his opinion of my Art?"</p>

<p>Mr. Percy was in doubt how to take her enthusiasm; he seemed
on the point of turning surly, and hesitated, while a sharp vertical
line appeared on his small forehead; but he evidently concluded,
after a deep glance at her, that if she was making game of him
it was in no ill-natured spirit&mdash;nay, I think that for a few moments
he suspected her liveliness to be some method of her own for the
incipient stages of a flirtation.</p>

<p>Finally he turned again to the easel, and as he examined the
painting thereon at closer range, amazement overspread his features.
However, pulling himself together, he found himself able to reply&mdash;and
with great gallantry:</p>

<p>"Well, on'y t' think them little hands cud 'a' done all that
rough woik!"</p>

<p>The unintended viciousness of this retort produced an effect
so marked, that, except for my growing uneasiness, I might have
enjoyed her expression.</p>

<p>As it was, I saved her face by entering into the conversation
with a question, which I put quickly:</p>

<p>"You intend pursuing your historical researches in the neighborhood?"</p>

<p>The facial contortion which served him for a laugh, and at the
same time as a symbol of unfathomable reserve, was repeated, accompanied
by a jocose manifestation, in the nature of a sharp and taunting
cackle, which seemed to indicate a conviction that he was getting
much the best of it in some conflict of wits.</p>

<p>"Them fairy tales I handed you about ole Jeanne d'Arc and William
the Conker," he said, "say, they must 'a' made you sore after-<em>WOIDS</em>!"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I was much interested in everything pertaining
to your too brief visit," I returned; "I am even more so now."</p>

<p>"Well, m'friend"&mdash;he shot me a sidelong, distrustful glance&mdash;"keep
yer eyes open."</p>

<p>"That is just the point!" I laughed, with intentional significance,
for I meant to make Mr. Percy talk as much as I could. To this
end, remembering that specimens of his kind are most indiscreet
when carefully enraged, I added, simulating his own manner:</p>

<p>"Eyes open&mdash;and doors locked! What?"</p>

<p>At this I heard a gasp of astonishment from Miss Elliott, who
must have been puzzled indeed; but I was intent upon the other.
He proved perfectly capable of being insulted.</p>

<p>"I guess they ain't much need o' lockin' <em>YOUR </em>door,"
he retorted darkly; "not from what I saw when I was in your studio!"
He should have stopped there, for the hit was palpable and justified;
but in his resentment he overdid it. "You needn't be scared of
anybody's cartin' off <em>THEM </em>pitchers, young feller! <em>WHOOSH!
</em>An' f'm the luks of the <em>CLO'ES I </em>saw hangin' on
the wall," he continued, growing more nettled as I smiled cheerfully
upon him, "I don' b'lieve you gut any worries comin' about <em>THEM,
</em>neither!"</p>

<p>"I suppose our tastes are different," I said, letting my smile
broaden. "There might be protection in that."</p>

<p>His stare at me was protracted to an unseemly length before the
sting of this remark reached him; it penetrated finally, however,
and in his sharp change of posture there was a lightning flicker
of the experienced boxer; but he checked the impulse, and took
up the task of obliterating me in another way.</p>

<p>"As I tell the little dame here," he said, pitching his voice
higher and affecting the plaintive, "I make no passes at a friend
o' her&mdash;not in front o' her, anyways. But when it comes to these
here ole, ancient curiosities"&mdash;he cackled again, loudly&mdash;"well,
I guess them clo'es I see, that day, kin hand it out t' anything
they got in the museums! 'Look here,' I says to the waiter, '<em>THESE
</em>must be'n left over f'm ole Jeanne d'Arc herself,' I says.
'Talk about yer relics,' I says. Whoosh! I'd like t' died!" He
laughed violently, and concluded by turning upon me with a contemptuous
flourish of his stick. "You think I d'know what makes <em>YOU
</em>so raw?"</p>

<p>The form of repartee necessary to augment his ill humour was,
of course, a matter of simple mechanism for one who had not entirely
forgotten his student days in the Quarter; and I delivered it
airily, though I shivered inwardly that Miss Elliott should hear.</p>

<p>"Everything will be all right if, when you dine at the inn, you'll
sit with your back toward me."</p>

<p>To my shamed surprise, this roustabout wit drew a nervous, silvery
giggle from her; and that completed the work with Mr. Percy, whose
face grew scarlet with anger.</p>

<p>"You're a hot one, you are!" he sneered, with shocking bitterness.
"You're quite the teaser, ain't ye, s'long's yer lady-friend is
lukkin' on! I guess they'll be a few surprises comin' <em>YOUR
</em>way, before long. P'raps I cudn't give ye one now 'f I had
a mind to."</p>

<p>"Pshaw," I laughed, and, venturing at hazard, said, "I know all
<em>YOU </em>know!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you do!" he cried scornfully. "I reckon you might set up
an' take a little notice, though, if you knowed 'at I know all
<em>YOU </em>know!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!"</p>

<p>"No? Maybe you think I don't know what makes you so raw with
ME? Maybe you think I don't know who ye've got so thick with at
this here Pigeon House; maybe you think I don't know who them
people <em>ARE</em>!"</p>

<p>"No, you don't. You have learned," I said, trying to control
my excitement, "nothing! Whoever hired <em>YOU </em>for a spy
lost the money. <em>YOU </em>don't know <em>ANY-</em>thing!"</p>

<p>"I <em>DON'T!" </em>And with that his voice went to a half-shriek.
"Maybe you think I'm down here f'r my health; maybe you think
I come out f'r a pleasant walk in the woods right now; maybe you
think I ain't seen no other lady-friend o' yours besides this'n
to-day, and maybe I didn't see who was with her&mdash;yes, an' maybe
you think I d'know no other times he's be'n with her. Maybe you
think I ain't be'n layin' low over at Dives! Maybe I don't know
a few real <em>NAMES </em>in this neighbourhood! Oh, no, <em>MAYBE
</em>not!"</p>

<p>"You know what the maitre d'hotel told you; nothing more."</p>

<p>"How about the name &mdash;<em>OLIVER SAFFREN?" </em>he cried
fiercely, and at last, though I had expected it, I uttered an
involuntary exclamation.</p>

<p>"How about it?" he shouted, advancing toward me triumphantly,
shaking his forefinger in my face. "Hey? <em>THAT </em>stings
some, does it? Sounds kind o' like a <em>FALSE </em>name, does
it? Got ye where the hair is short, that time, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Speaking of names," I retorted, "'Oil Poicy' doesn't seem to
ring particularly true to me!"</p>

<p>"It'll be gud enough fer you, young feller," he responded angrily.
"It may belong t' me, an' then again, it maybe don't. It ain'
gunna git me in no trouble; I'll luk out f'r that. <em>YOUR </em>side's
where the trouble is; that's what's eatin' into you. An' I'll
tell you flat-foot, your gittin' rough 'ith me and playin' Charley
the Show-Off in front o' yer lady-friends'll all go down in the
bill. These people ye've got so chummy with &mdash;<em>THEY'LL
</em>pay f'r it all right, don't you shed no tears over that!"</p>

<p>"You couldn't by any possibility," I said deliberately, with
as much satire as I could command, "you couldn't possibly mean
that any sum of mere money might be a salve for the injuries my
unkind words have inflicted?"</p>

<p>Once more he seemed upon the point of destroying me physically,
but, with a slight shudder, controlled himself. Stepping close
to me, he thrust his head forward and measured the emphases of
his speech by his right forefinger upon my shoulder, as he said:</p>

<p>"You paint <em>THIS </em>in yer pitchers, m' dear friend; they's
jest as much law in this country as they is on the corner o' Twenty-thoid
Street an' Fif' Avenoo! You keep out the way of it, or you'll
git runned over!"</p>

<p>Delivering a final tap on my shoulder as a last warning, he wheeled
deftly upon his heel, addressed Miss Elliott briefly, "Glad t'
know <em>YOU, </em>lady," and striking into the by-path by which
he had approached us, was soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>The girl faced me excitedly. "What IS it?" she cried. "It seemed
to me you insulted him deliberately&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"You wanted to make him angry?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought so!" she exclaimed breathlessly. "I knew there
was something serious underneath. It's about Mr. Saffren?"</p>

<p>"It is serious indeed, I fear," I said, and turning to my own
easel, began to get my traps together. "I'll tell you the little
I know, because I want you to tell Mrs. Harman what has just happened,
and you'll be able to do it better if you understand what is understandable
about the rest of it."</p>

<p>"You mean you wouldn't tell me so that I could understand for
myself?" There was a note of genuine grieved reproach in her voice.
"Ah, then I've made you think me altogether a hare-brain!"</p>

<p>"I haven't time to tell you what I think of you," I said brusquely,
and, strangely enough, it seemed to please her. But I paid little
attention to that, continuing quickly: "When Professor Keredec
and Mr. Saffren came to Les Trois Pigeons, they were so careful
to keep out of everybody's sight that one might have suspected
that they were in hiding&mdash;and, in fact, I'm sure that they were&mdash;though,
as time passed and nothing alarming happened, they've felt reassured
and allowed themselves more liberty. It struck me that Keredec
at first dreaded that they might be traced to the inn, and I'm
afraid his fear was justified, for one night, before I came to
know them, I met Mr. 'Percy' on the road; he'd visited Madame
Brossard's and pumped Amedee dry, but clumsily tried to pretend
to me that he had not been there at all. At the time, I did not
connect him even remotely with Professor Keredec's anxieties.
I imagined he might have an eye to the spoons; but it's as ridiculous
to think him a burglar as it would be to take him for a detective.
What he is, or what he has to do with Mr. Saffren, I can guess
no more than I can guess the cause of Keredec's fears, but the
moment I saw him to-day, saw that he'd come back, I knew it was
<em>THAT, </em>and tried to draw him out. You heard what he said;
there's no doubt that Saffren stands in danger of some kind. It
may be inconsiderable, or even absurd, but it's evidently imminent,
and no matter what it is, Mrs. Harman must be kept out of it.
I want you to see her as soon as you can and ask her from me&mdash;no,
persuade her yourself&mdash;not to leave Quesnay for a day or two.
I mean, that she absolutely <em>MUST NOT </em>meet Mr. Saffren
again until we know what all this means. Will you do it?"</p>

<p>"That I will!" And she began hastily to get her belongings in
marching order. "I'll do anything in the world you'll let me&mdash;and
oh, I hope they can't do anything to poor, poor Mr. Saffren!"</p>

<p>"Our sporting friend had evidently seen him with Mrs. Harman
to-day," I said. "Do you know if they went to the beach again?"</p>

<p>"I only know she meant to meet him&mdash;but she told me she'd be
back at the chateau by four. If I start now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wasn't the phaeton to be sent to the inn for you?"</p>

<p>"Not until six," she returned briskly, folding her easel and
strapping it to her camp-stool with precision. "Isn't it shorter
by the woods?"</p>

<p>"You've only to follow this path to the second crossing and then
turn to the right," I responded. "I shall hurry back to Madame
Brossard's to see Keredec&mdash;and here" &mdash;I extended my hand
toward her traps, of which, in a neatly practical fashion, she
had made one close pack&mdash;"let me have your things, and I'll take
care of them at the inn for you. They're heavy, and it's a long
trudge."</p>

<p>"You have your own to carry," she answered, swinging the strap
over her shoulder. "It's something of a walk for you, too."</p>

<p>"No, no, let me have them," I protested, for the walk before
her <em>WAS </em>long and the things would be heavy indeed before
it ended.</p>

<p>"Go your ways," she laughed, and as my hand still remained extended
she grasped it with her own and gave it a warm and friendly shake.
"Hurry!" And with an optimism which took my breath, she said,
"I know <em>YOU </em>can make it come out all right! Besides,
I'll help you!"</p>

<p>With that she turned and started manfully upon her journey. I
stared after her for a moment or more, watching the pretty brown
dress flashing in and out of shadow among the ragged greeneries,
shafts of sunshine now and then flashing upon her hair. Then I
picked up my own pack and set out for the inn.</p>

<p>Every one knows that the more serious and urgent the errand a
man may be upon, the more incongruous are apt to be the thoughts
that skip into his mind. As I went through the woods that day,
breathless with haste and curious fears, my brain became suddenly,
unaccountably busy with a dream I had had, two nights before.
I had not recalled this dream on waking: the recollection of it
came to me now for the first time. It was a usual enough dream,
wandering and unlifelike, not worth the telling; and I had been
thinking so constantly of Mrs. Harman that there was nothing extraordinary
in her worthless ex-husband's being part of it.</p>

<p>And yet, looking back upon that last, hurried walk of mine through
the forest, I see how strange it was that I could not quit remembering
how in my dream I had gone motoring up Mount Pilatus with the
man I had seen so pitiably demolished on the Versailles road,
two years before &mdash;Larrabee Harman.</p>
