BEFORE applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic
beings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether these
latter are subject to any variation. To treat this subject at all
properly, a long catalogue of dry facts should be given; but these I
shall reserve for my future work. Nor shall I here discuss the various
definitions which have been given of the term species. No one
definition has as yet satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist
knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species. Generally the
term includes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation.  The
term 'variety' is almost equally difficult to define; but here
community of descent is almost universally implied, though it can
rarely be proved. We have also what are called monstrosities; but they
graduate into varieties. By a monstrosity I presume is meant some
considerable deviation of structure in one part, either injurious to
or not useful to the species, and not generally propagated. Some
authors use the term 'variation' in a technical sense, as implying a
modification directly due to the physical conditions of life; and
'variations' in this sense are supposed not to be inherited: but who
can say that the dwarfed condition of shells in the brackish waters of
the Baltic, or dwarfed plants on Alpine summits, or the thicker fur of
an animal from far northwards, would not in some cases be inherited
for at least some few generations? and in this case I presume that the
form would be called a variety.
<P>
Again, we have many slight differences which may be called 
individual differences, such as are known frequently to
appear in the offspring from the same parents, or which may be
presumed to have thus arisen, from being frequently observed in the
individuals of the same species inhabiting the same confined locality.
No one supposes that all the individuals of the same species are cast
in the very same mould. These individual differences are highly
important for us, as they afford materials for natural selection to
accumulate, in the same manner as man can accumulate in any given
direction individual differences in his domesticated productions.
These individual differences generally affect what naturalists
consider unimportant parts; but I could show by a long catalogue of
facts, that parts which must be called important, whether viewed under
a physiological or classificatory point of view, sometimes vary in the
individuals of the same species. I am convinced that the most
experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases
of variability, even in important parts of structure, which he could
collect on good authority, as I have collected, during a course of
years. It should be remembered that systematists are far from pleased
at finding variability in important characters, and that there are not
many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs,
and compare them in many specimens of the same species. I should never
have expected that the branching of the main nerves close to the great
central ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same
species; I should have expected that changes of this nature could have
been effected only by slow degrees: yet quite recently Mr Lubbock has
shown a degree of variability in these main nerves in Coccus, which
may almost be compared to the irregular branching of the stem of a
tree. This philosophical naturalist, I may add, has also quite
recently shown that the muscles in the larvae of certain insects are
very far from uniform. Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they
state that important organs never vary; for these same authors
practically rank that character as important (as some few naturalists
have honestly confessed) which does not vary; and, under this point of
view, no instance of any important part varying will ever be found:
but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can be
given.
<P>
There is one point connected with individual differences, which
seems to me extremely perplexing: I refer to those genera which have
sometimes been called 'protean' or 'polymorphic,' in which the species
present an inordinate amount of variation; and hardly two naturalists
can agree which forms to rank as species and which as varieties. We
may instance Rubus, Rosa, and Hieracium amongst plants, several genera
of insects, and several genera of Brachiopod shells. In most
polymorphic genera some of the species have fixed and definite
characters. Genera which are polymorphic in one country seem to be,
with some few exceptions, polymorphic in other countries, and
likewise, judging from Brachiopod shells, at former periods of time.
These facts seem to be very perplexing, for they seem to show that
this kind of variability is independent of the conditions of life. I
am inclined to suspect that we see in these polymorphic genera
variations in points of structure which are of no service or
disservice to the species, and which consequently have not been seized
on and rendered definite by natural selection, as hereafter will be
explained.
<P>
Those forms which possess in some considerable degree the character
of species, but which are so closely similar to some other forms, or
are so closely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that
naturalists do not like to rank them as distinct species, are in
several respects the most important for us. We have every reason to
believe that many of these doubtful and closely-allied forms have
permanently retained their characters in their own country for a long
time; for as long, as far as we know, as have good and true species.
practically, when a naturalist can unite two forms together by others
having intermediate characters, he treats the one as a variety of the
other, ranking the most common, but sometimes the one first described,
as the species, and the other as the variety. But cases of great
difficulty, which I will not here enumerate, sometimes occur in
deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of another, even
when they are closely connected by intermediate links; nor will the
commonly-assumed hybrid nature of the intermediate links always remove
the difficulty. In very many cases, however, one form is ranked as a
variety of another, not because the intermediate links
have actually been found, but because analogy leads the observer to
suppose either that they do now somewhere exist, or may formerly have
existed; and here a wide door for the entry of doubt and conjecture is
opened.
<P>
Hence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species
or a variety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgement and
wide experience seems the only guide to follow. We must, however, in
many cases, decide by a majority of naturalists, for few well-marked
and well-known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as
species by at least some competent judges.
<P>
That varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot
be disputed. Compare the several floras of Great Britain, of France or
of the United States, drawn up by different botanists, and see what a
surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good
species, and by another as mere varieties. Mr H. C. Watson, to whom I
lie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds, has marked for
me 182 British plants, which are generally considered as varieties,
but which have all been ranked by botanists as species; and in making
this list he has omitted many trifling varieties, but which
nevertheless have been ranked by some botanists as species, and he has
entirely omitted several highly polymorphic genera. Under genera,
including the most polymorphic forms, Mr Babington gives 251 species,
whereas Mr Bentham gives only 112,   a difference of 139
doubtful forms! Amongst animals which unite for each birth, and which
are highly locomotive, doubtful forms, ranked by one zoologist as a
species and by another as a variety, can rarely be found within the
same country, but are common in separated areas. How many of those
birds and insects in North America and Europe, which differ very
slightly from each other, have been ranked by one eminent naturalist
as undoubted species, and by another as varieties, or, as they are
often called, as geographical races! Many years ago, when comparing,
and seeing others compare, the birds from the separate islands of the
Galapagos Archipelago, both one with another, and with those from the
American mainland, I was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary
is the distinction between species and varieties. On the 
islets of the little Madeira group there are many insects which are
characterized as varieties in Mr Wollaston's admirable work, but which
it cannot be doubted would be ranked as distinct species by many
entomologists. Even Ireland has a few animals, now generally regarded
as varieties, but which have been ranked as species by some
zoologists. Several most experienced ornithologists consider our
British red grouse as only a strongly-marked race of a Norwegian
species, whereas the greater number rank it as an undoubted species
peculiar to Great Britain. A wide distance between the homes of two
doubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank both as distinct
species; but what distance, it has been well asked, will suffice?  if
that between America and Europe is ample, will that between the
Continent and the Azores, or Madeira, or the Canaries, or Ireland, be
sufficient?  It must be admitted that many forms, considered by
highly-competent judges as varieties, have so perfectly the character
of species that they are ranked by other highly-competent judges as
good and true species. But to discuss whether they are rightly called
species or varieties, before any definition of these terms has been
generally accepted, is vainly to beat the air.
<P>
Many of the cases of strongly-marked varieties or doubtful species
well deserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument,
from geographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism,
&amp;c., have been brought to bear on the attempt to determine their
rank.  I will here give only a single instance,   the well-known
one of the primrose and cowslip, or Primula veris and elatior. These
plants differ considerably in appearance; they have a different
flavour and emit a different odour; they flower at slightly different
periods; they grow in somewhat different stations; they ascend
mountains to different heights; they have different geographical
ranges; and lastly, according to very numerous experiments made during
several years by that most careful observer G&auml;rtner, they can be
crossed only with much difficulty. We could hardly wish for better
evidence of the two forms being specifically distinct. On the other
hand, they are united by many intermediate links, and it is very
doubtful whether these links are hybrids; and there is, as it seems to
me, an overwhelming amount of experimental evidence,
showing that they descend from common parents, and consequently must
be ranked as varieties.
<P>
Close investigation, in most cases, will bring naturalists to an
agreement how to rank doubtful forms. Yet it must be confessed, that
it is in the best-known countries that we find the greatest number of
forms of doubtful value.  I have been struck with the fact, that if
any animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful to man, or
from any cause closely attract his attention, varieties of it will
almost universally be found recorded. These varieties, moreover, will
be often ranked by some authors as species.  Look at the common oak,
how closely it has been studied; yet a German author makes more than a
dozen species out of forms, which are very generally considered as
varieties; and in this country the highest botanical authorities and
practical men can be quoted to show that the sessile and pedunculated
oaks are either good and distinct species or mere varieties.
<P>
When a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms
quite unknown to him, he is at first much perplexed to determine what
differences to consider as specific, and what as varieties; for he
knows nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group
is subject; and this shows, at least, how very generally there is some
variation. But if he confine his attention to one class within one
country, he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the
doubtful forms. His general tendency will be to make many species, for
he will become impressed, just like the pigeon or poultry-fancier
before alluded to, with the amount of difference in the forms which he
is continually studying; and he has little general knowledge of
analogical variation in other groups and in other countries, by which
to correct his first impressions. As he extends the range of his
observations, he will meet with more cases of difficulty; for he will
encounter a greater number of closely-allied forms. But if his
observations be widely extended, he will in the end generally be
enabled to make up his own mind which to call varieties and which
species; but he will succeed in this at the expense of admitting much
variation,   and the truth of this admission will often be
disputed by other naturalists. When, moreover, he comes to
study allied forms brought from countries not now continuous, in which
case he can hardly hope to find the intermediate links between his
doubtful forms, he will have to trust almost entirely to analogy, and
his difficulties will rise to a climax.
<P>
Certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn
between species and sub-species   that is, the forms which in
the opinion of some naturalists come very near to, but do not quite
arrive at the rank of species; or, again, between sub-species and
well-marked varieties, or between lesser varieties and individual
differences. These differences blend into each other in an insensible
series; and a series impresses the mind with the idea of an actual
passage.
<P>
Hence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to
the systematist, as of high importance for us, as being the first step
towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in
works on natural history.  And I look at varieties which are in any
degree more distinct and permanent, as steps leading to more 
strongly marked and more permanent varieties; and at these latter, as leading
to sub-species, and to species. The passage from one stage of
difference to another and higher stage may be, in some cases, due
merely to the long-continued action of different physical conditions
in two different regions; but I have not much faith in this view; and
I attribute the passage of a variety, from a state in which it differs
very slightly from its parent to one in which it differs more, to the
action of natural selection in accumulating (as will hereafter be more
fully explained) differences of structure in certain definite
directions. Hence I believe a well-marked variety may be justly called
an incipient species; but whether this belief be justifiable must be
judged of by the general weight of the several facts and views given
throughout this work.
<P>
It need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species
necessarily attain the rank of species. They may whilst in this
incipient state become extinct, or they may endure as varieties for
very long periods, as has been shown to be the case by Mr Wollaston
with the varieties of certain fossil land-shells in Madeira. If a
variety were to flourish so as to exceed in numbers the
parent species, it would then rank as the species, and the species as
the variety; or it might come to supplant and exterminate the parent
species; or both might co-exist, and both rank as independent species.
But we shall hereafter have to return to this subject.
<P>
From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species,
as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of
individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not
essentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less
distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again, in
comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied
arbitrarily, and for mere convenience sake.
<P>
Guided by theoretical considerations, I thought that some
interesting results might be obtained in regard to the nature and
relations of the species which vary most, by tabulating all the
varieties in several well-worked floras.  At first this seemed a
simple task; but Mr H. C. Watson, to whom I am much indebted for
valuable advice and assistance on this subject, soon convinced me that
there were many difficulties, as did subsequently Dr Hooker, even in
stronger terms. I shall reserve for my future work the discussion of
these difficulties, and the tables themselves of the proportional
numbers of the varying species. Dr Hooker permits me to add, that
after having carefully read my manuscript, and examined the tables, he
thinks that the following statements are fairly well established. The
whole subject, however, treated as it necessarily here is with much
brevity, is rather perplexing, and allusions cannot be avoided to the
'struggle for existence,' 'divergence of character,' and other
questions, hereafter to be discussed.
<P>
Alph. De Candolle and others have shown that plants which have very
wide ranges generally present varieties; and this might have been
expected, as they become exposed to diverse physical conditions, and
as they come into competition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a
far more important circumstance) with different sets of organic
beings. But my tables further show that, in any limited country, the
species which are most common, that is abound most in individuals, and
the species which are most widely diffused within their own country
(and this is a different consideration from wide range,
and to a certain extent from commonness), often give rise to varieties
sufficiently well-marked to have been recorded in botanical works.
Hence it is the most flourishing, or, as they may be called, the
dominant species,   those which range widely over the world, are
the most diffused in their own country, and are the most numerous in
individuals,   which oftenest produce well-marked varieties, or,
as I consider them, incipient species. And this, perhaps, might have
been anticipated; for, as varieties, in order to become in any degree
permanent, necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of
the country, the species which are already dominant will be the most
likely to yield offspring which, though in some slight degree
modified, will still inherit those advantages that enabled their
parents to become dominant over their compatriots.
<P>
If the plants inhabiting a country and described in any Flora be
divided into two equal masses, all those in the larger genera being
placed on one side, and all those in the smaller genera on the other
side, a somewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or
dominant species will be found on the side of the larger genera. This,
again, might have been anticipated; for the mere fact of many species
of the same genus inhabiting any country, shows that there is
something in the organic or inorganic conditions of that country
favourable to the genus; and, consequently, we might have expected to
have found in the larger genera, or those including many species, a
large proportional number of dominant species.  But so many causes
tend to obscure this result, that I am surprised that my tables show
even a small majority on the side of the larger genera. I will here
allude to only two causes of obscurity. Fresh-water and salt-loving
plants have generally very wide ranges and are much diffused, but this
seems to be connected with the nature of the stations inhabited by
them, and has little or no relation to the size of the genera to which
the species belong. Again, plants low in the scale of organisation are
generally much more widely diffused than plants higher in the scale;
and here again there is no close relation to the size of the genera.
The cause of lowly-organised plants ranging widely will be discussed
in our chapter on geographical distribution.
<P>
From looking at species as only strongly-marked and well-defined
varieties, I was led to anticipate that the species of the larger
genera in each country would oftener present varieties, than the
species of the smaller genera; for wherever many closely related
species (<I>i.e.</I> species of the same genus)
have been formed, many varieties or incipient species ought, as a
general rule, to be now forming. Where many large trees grow, we
expect to find saplings. Where many species of a genus have been
formed through variation, circumstances have been favourable for
variation; and hence we might expect that the circumstances would
generally be still favourable to variation. On the other hand, if we
look at each species as a special act of creation, there is no
apparent reason why more varieties should occur in a group having many
species, than in one having few.
<P>
To test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants
of twelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts,
into two nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on one
side, and those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it has
invariably proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the
species on the side of the larger genera present varieties, than on
the side of the smaller genera. Moreover, the species of the large
genera which present any varieties, invariably present a larger
average number of varieties than do the species of the small genera.
Both these results follow when another division is made, and when all
the smallest genera, with from only one to four species, are
absolutely excluded from the tables. These facts are of plain
signification on the view that species are only strongly marked and
permanent varieties; for whenever many species of the same genus have
been formed, or where, if we may use the expression, the manufactory
of species has been active, we ought generally to find the manufactory
still in action, more especially as we have every reason to believe
the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one. And this
certainly is the case, if varieties be looked at as incipient species;
for my tables clearly show as a general rule that, wherever many
species of a genus have been formed, the species of that genus present
a number of varieties, that is of incipient species, beyond the
average. It is not that all large genera are now varying
much, and are thus increasing in the number of their species, or that
no small genera are now varying and increasing; for if this had been
so, it would have been fatal to my theory; inasmuch as geology plainly
tells us that small genera have in the lapse of time often increased
greatly in size; and that large genera have often come to their
maxima, declined, and disappeared. All that we want to show is, that
where many species of a genus have been formed, on an average many are
still forming; and this holds good.
<P>
There are other relations between the species of large genera and
their recorded varieties which deserve notice. We have seen that there
is no infallible criterion by which to distinguish species and
well-marked varieties; and in those cases in which intermediate links
have not been found between doubtful forms, naturalists are compelled
to come to a determination by the amount of difference between them,
judging by analogy whether or not the amount suffices to raise one or
both to the rank of species. Hence the amount of difference is one
very important criterion in settling whether two forms should be
ranked as species or varieties.  Now Fries has remarked in regard to
plants, and Westwood in regard to insects, that in large genera the
amount of difference between the species is often exceedingly small. I
have endeavoured to test this numerically by averages, and, as far as
my imperfect results go, they always confirm the view. I have also
consulted some sagacious and most experienced observers, and, after
deliberation, they concur in this view. In this respect, therefore,
the species of the larger genera resemble varieties, more than do the
species of the smaller genera. Or the case may be put in another way,
and it may be said, that in the larger genera, in which a number of
varieties or incipient species greater than the average are now
manufacturing, many of the species already manufactured still to a
certain extent resemble varieties, for they differ from each other by
a less than usual amount of difference.
<P>
Moreover, the species of the large genera are related to each
other, in the same manner as the varieties of any one species are
related to each other. No naturalist pretends that all the species of
a genus are equally distinct from each other; they may 
generally be divided into sub-genera, or sections, or lesser groups.
As Fries has well remarked, little groups of species are generally
clustered like satellites around certain other species. And what are
varieties but groups of forms, unequally related to each other, and
clustered round certain forms   that is, round their
parent-species? Undoubtedly there is one most important point of
difference between varieties and species; namely, that the amount of
difference between varieties, when compared with each other or with
their parent-species, is much less than that between the species of
the same genus. But when we come to discuss the principle, as I call
it, of Divergence of Character, we shall see how this may be
explained, and how the lesser differences between varieties will tend
to increase into the greater differences between species.
<P>
There is one other point which seems to me worth notice.  Varieties
generally have much restricted ranges: this statement is indeed
scarcely more than a truism, for if a variety were found to have a
wider range than that of its supposed parent-species, their
denominations ought to be reversed. But there is also reason to
believe, that those species which are very closely allied to other
species, and in so far resemble varieties, often have much restricted
ranges. For instance, Mr H. C. Watson has marked for me in the
well-sifted London Catalogue of plants (4th edition) 63 plants which
are therein ranked as species, but which he considers as so closely
allied to other species as to be of doubtful value: these 63 reputed
species range on an average over 6.9 of the provinces into which Mr
Watson has divided Great Britain. Now, in this same catalogue, 53
acknowledged varieties are recorded, and these range over 7.7
provinces; whereas, the species to which these varieties belong range
over 14.3 provinces. So that the acknowledged varieties have very
nearly the same restricted average range, as have those very closely
allied forms, marked for me by Mr Watson as doubtful species, but
which are almost universally ranked by British botanists as good and
true species.
<P>
Finally, then, varieties have the same general characters as
species, for they cannot be distinguished from species,  
except, firstly, by the discovery of intermediate linking forms, and
the occurrence of such links cannot affect the actual
characters of the forms which they connect; and except, secondly, by a
certain amount of difference, for two forms, if differing very little,
are generally ranked as varieties, notwithstanding that intermediate
linking forms have not been discovered; but the amount of difference
considered necessary to give to two forms the rank of species is quite
indefinite. In genera having more than the average number of species
in any country, the species of these genera have more than the average
number of varieties. In large genera the species are apt to be
closely, but unequally, allied together, forming little clusters round
certain species.  Species very closely allied to other species
apparently have restricted ranges. In all these several respects the
species of large genera present a strong analogy with varieties. And
we can clearly understand these analogies, if species have once
existed as varieties, and have thus originated: whereas, these
analogies are utterly inexplicable if each species has been
independently created.
<P>
We have, also, seen that it is the most flourishing and dominant
species of the larger genera which on an average vary most; and
varieties, as we shall hereafter see, tend to become converted into
new and distinct species. The larger genera thus tend to become
larger; and throughout nature the forms of life which are now dominant
tend to become still more dominant by leaving many modified and
dominant descendants. But by steps hereafter to be explained, the
larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera. And thus, the
forms of life throughout the universe become divided into groups
subordinate to groups.
