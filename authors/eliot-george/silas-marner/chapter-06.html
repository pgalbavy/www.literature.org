The conversation, which was at a high pitch of animation when Silas
approached the door of the Rainbow, had, as usual, been slow and
intermittent when the company first assembled.  The pipes began to
be puffed in a silence which had an air of severity; the more
important customers, who drank spirits and sat nearest the fire,
staring at each other as if a bet were depending on the first man
who winked; while the beer-drinkers, chiefly men in fustian jackets
and smock-frocks, kept their eyelids down and rubbed their hands
across their mouths, as if their draughts of beer were a funereal
duty attended with embarrassing sadness.  At last Mr. Snell, the
landlord, a man of a neutral disposition, accustomed to stand aloof
from human differences as those of beings who were all alike in need
of liquor, broke silence, by saying in a doubtful tone to his cousin
the butcher - </p>

<p>&quot;Some folks 'ud say that was a fine beast you druv in yesterday,
Bob?&quot;</p>

<p>The butcher, a jolly, smiling, red-haired man, was not disposed to
answer rashly.  He gave a few puffs before he spat and replied,
&quot;And they wouldn't be fur wrong, John.&quot;</p>

<p>After this feeble delusive thaw, the silence set in as severely as
before.</p>

<p>&quot;Was it a red Durham?&quot;  said the farrier, taking up the thread of
discourse after the lapse of a few minutes.</p>

<p>The farrier looked at the landlord, and the landlord looked at the
butcher, as the person who must take the responsibility of
answering.</p>

<p>&quot;Red it was,&quot; said the butcher, in his good-humoured husky treble - 
&quot;and a Durham it was.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you needn't tell <span style="text-decoration: underline">me</span> who you bought it of,&quot; said the
farrier, looking round with some triumph; &quot;I know who it is has got
the red Durhams o' this country-side.  And she'd a white star on her
brow, I'll bet a penny?&quot;  The farrier leaned forward with his hands
on his knees as he put this question, and his eyes twinkled
knowingly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well; yes - she might,&quot; said the butcher, slowly, considering
that he was giving a decided affirmative.  &quot;I don't say
contrairy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew that very well,&quot; said the farrier, throwing himself
backward again, and speaking defiantly; &quot;if <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> don't know
Mr. Lammeter's cows, I should like to know who does - that's all.
And as for the cow you've bought, bargain or no bargain, I've been
at the drenching of her - contradick me who will.&quot;</p>

<p>The farrier looked fierce, and the mild butcher's conversational
spirit was roused a little.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not for contradicking no man,&quot; he said; &quot;I'm for peace and
quietness.  Some are for cutting long ribs - I'm for cutting 'em
short myself; but <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> don't quarrel with 'em.  All I say is, it's a
lovely carkiss - and anybody as was reasonable, it 'ud bring tears
into their eyes to look at it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's the cow as I drenched, whatever it is,&quot; pursued the
farrier, angrily; &quot;and it was Mr. Lammeter's cow, else you told a
lie when you said it was a red Durham.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I tell no lies,&quot; said the butcher, with the same mild huskiness
as before, &quot;and I contradick none - not if a man was to swear
himself black: he's no meat o' mine, nor none o' my bargains.  All I
say is, it's a lovely carkiss.  And what I say, I'll stick to; but
I'll quarrel wi' no man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said the farrier, with bitter sarcasm, looking at the
company generally; &quot;and p'rhaps you aren't pig-headed; and p'rhaps
you didn't say the cow was a red Durham; and p'rhaps you didn't say
she'd got a star on her brow - stick to that, now you're at it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come, come,&quot; said the landlord; &quot;let the cow alone.  The truth
lies atween you: you're both right and both wrong, as I allays say.
And as for the cow's being Mr. Lammeter's, I say nothing to that;
but this I say, as the Rainbow's the Rainbow.  And for the matter o'
that, if the talk is to be o' the Lammeters, <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span> know the most
upo' that head, eh, Mr. Macey?  You remember when first
Mr. Lammeter's father come into these parts, and took the Warrens?&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Macey, tailor and parish-clerk, the latter of which functions
rheumatism had of late obliged him to share with a small-featured
young man who sat opposite him, held his white head on one side, and
twirled his thumbs with an air of complacency, slightly seasoned
with criticism.  He smiled pityingly, in answer to the landlord's
appeal, and said - </p>

<p>&quot;Aye, aye; I know, I know; but I let other folks talk.  I've laid
by now, and gev up to the young uns.  Ask them as have been to
school at Tarley: they've learnt pernouncing; that's come up since
my day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you're pointing at me, Mr. Macey,&quot; said the deputy clerk, with
an air of anxious propriety, &quot;I'm nowise a man to speak out of my
place.  As the psalm says - </p>

<p>&quot;I know what's right, nor only so,
But also practise what I know.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, I wish you'd keep hold o' the tune, when it's set for
you; if you're for prac_tis_ing, I wish you'd prac_tise_ that,&quot;
said a large jocose-looking man, an excellent wheelwright in his
week-day capacity, but on Sundays leader of the choir.  He winked,
as he spoke, at two of the company, who were known officially as the
&quot;bassoon&quot; and the &quot;key-bugle&quot;, in the confidence that he was
expressing the sense of the musical profession in Raveloe.</p>

<p>Mr. Tookey, the deputy-clerk, who shared the unpopularity common to
deputies, turned very red, but replied, with careful moderation - 
&quot;Mr. Winthrop, if you'll bring me any proof as I'm in the wrong,
I'm not the man to say I won't alter.  But there's people set up
their own ears for a standard, and expect the whole choir to follow
'em.  There may be two opinions, I hope.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, aye,&quot; said Mr. Macey, who felt very well satisfied with this
attack on youthful presumption; &quot;you're right there, Tookey:
there's allays two 'pinions; there's the 'pinion a man has of
himsen, and there's the 'pinion other folks have on him.  There'd be
two 'pinions about a cracked bell, if the bell could hear itself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Mr. Macey,&quot; said poor Tookey, serious amidst the general
laughter, &quot;I undertook to partially fill up the office of
parish-clerk by Mr. Crackenthorp's desire, whenever your infirmities
should make you unfitting; and it's one of the rights thereof to
sing in the choir - else why have you done the same yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!  but the old gentleman and you are two folks,&quot; said Ben
Winthrop.  &quot;The old gentleman's got a gift.  Why, the Squire used
to invite him to take a glass, only to hear him sing the &quot;Red
Rovier&quot;; didn't he, Mr. Macey?  It's a nat'ral gift.  There's my
little lad Aaron, he's got a gift - he can sing a tune off
straight, like a throstle.  But as for you, Master Tookey, you'd
better stick to your &quot;Amens&quot;: your voice is well enough when you
keep it up in your nose.  It's your inside as isn't right made for
music: it's no better nor a hollow stalk.&quot;</p>

<p>This kind of unflinching frankness was the most piquant form of joke
to the company at the Rainbow, and Ben Winthrop's insult was felt by
everybody to have capped Mr. Macey's epigram.</p>

<p>&quot;I see what it is plain enough,&quot; said Mr. Tookey, unable to keep
cool any longer.  &quot;There's a consperacy to turn me out o' the
choir, as I shouldn't share the Christmas money - that's where it
is.  But I shall speak to Mr. Crackenthorp; I'll not be put upon by
no man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nay, nay, Tookey,&quot; said Ben Winthrop.  &quot;We'll pay you your share
to keep out of it - that's what we'll do.  There's things folks 'ud
pay to be rid on, besides varmin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come, come,&quot; said the landlord, who felt that paying people for
their absence was a principle dangerous to society; &quot;a joke's a
joke.  We're all good friends here, I hope.  We must give and take.
You're both right and you're both wrong, as I say.  I agree wi'
Mr. Macey here, as there's two opinions; and if mine was asked, I
should say they're both right.  Tookey's right and Winthrop's right,
and they've only got to split the difference and make themselves
even.&quot;</p>

<p>The farrier was puffing his pipe rather fiercely, in some contempt
at this trivial discussion.  He had no ear for music himself, and
never went to church, as being of the medical profession, and likely
to be in requisition for delicate cows.  But the butcher, having
music in his soul, had listened with a divided desire for Tookey's
defeat and for the preservation of the peace.</p>

<p>&quot;To be sure,&quot; he said, following up the landlord's conciliatory
view, &quot;we're fond of our old clerk; it's nat'ral, and him used to
be such a singer, and got a brother as is known for the first
fiddler in this country-side.  Eh, it's a pity but what Solomon
lived in our village, and could give us a tune when we liked; eh,
Mr. Macey?  I'd keep him in liver and lights for nothing - that I
would.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, aye,&quot; said Mr. Macey, in the height of complacency; &quot;our
family's been known for musicianers as far back as anybody can tell.
But them things are dying out, as I tell Solomon every time he comes
round; there's no voices like what there used to be, and there's
nobody remembers what we remember, if it isn't the old crows.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, you remember when first Mr. Lammeter's father come into these
parts, don't you, Mr. Macey?&quot;  said the landlord.</p>

<p>&quot;I should think I did,&quot; said the old man, who had now gone through
that complimentary process necessary to bring him up to the point of
narration; &quot;and a fine old gentleman he was - as fine, and finer
nor the Mr. Lammeter as now is.  He came from a bit north'ard, so
far as I could ever make out.  But there's nobody rightly knows
about those parts: only it couldn't be far north'ard, nor much
different from this country, for he brought a fine breed o' sheep
with him, so there must be pastures there, and everything
reasonable.  We heared tell as he'd sold his own land to come and
take the Warrens, and that seemed odd for a man as had land of his
own, to come and rent a farm in a strange place.  But they said it
was along of his wife's dying; though there's reasons in things as
nobody knows on - that's pretty much what I've made out; yet some
folks are so wise, they'll find you fifty reasons straight off, and
all the while the real reason's winking at 'em in the corner, and
they niver see't.  Howsomever, it was soon seen as we'd got a new
parish'ner as know'd the rights and customs o' things, and kep a
good house, and was well looked on by everybody.  And the young man - 
that's the Mr. Lammeter as now is, for he'd niver a sister - 
soon begun to court Miss Osgood, that's the sister o' the Mr. Osgood
as now is, and a fine handsome lass she was - eh, you can't think - 
they pretend this young lass is like her, but that's the way wi'
people as don't know what come before 'em.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> should know, for I
helped the old rector, Mr. Drumlow as was, I helped him marry 'em.&quot;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Macey paused; he always gave his narrative in instalments,
expecting to be questioned according to precedent.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, and a partic'lar thing happened, didn't it, Mr. Macey, so as
you were likely to remember that marriage?&quot;  said the landlord, in
a congratulatory tone.</p>

<p>&quot;I should think there did - a <span style="text-decoration: underline">very</span> partic'lar thing,&quot; said
Mr. Macey, nodding sideways.  &quot;For Mr. Drumlow - poor old
gentleman, I was fond on him, though he'd got a bit confused in his
head, what wi' age and wi' taking a drop o' summat warm when the
service come of a cold morning.  And young Mr. Lammeter, he'd have
no way but he must be married in Janiwary, which, to be sure, 's a
unreasonable time to be married in, for it isn't like a christening
or a burying, as you can't help; and so Mr. Drumlow - poor old
gentleman, I was fond on him - but when he come to put the
questions, he put 'em by the rule o' contrairy, like, and he says,
&quot;Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded wife?&quot;  says he, and then he
says, &quot;Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded husband?&quot;  says he.
But the partic'larest thing of all is, as nobody took any notice on
it but me, and they answered straight off &quot;yes&quot;, like as if it had
been me saying &quot;Amen&quot; i' the right place, without listening to what
went before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span> knew what was going on well enough, didn't you,
Mr. Macey?  You were live enough, eh?&quot;  said the butcher.</p>

<p>&quot;Lor bless you!&quot;  said Mr. Macey, pausing, and smiling in pity at
the impotence of his hearer's imagination - &quot;why, I was all of a
tremble: it was as if I'd been a coat pulled by the two tails, like;
for I couldn't stop the parson, I couldn't take upon me to do that;
and yet I said to myself, I says, &quot;Suppose they shouldn't be fast
married, 'cause the words are contrairy?&quot;  and my head went working
like a mill, for I was allays uncommon for turning things over and
seeing all round 'em; and I says to myself, &quot;Is't the meanin' or the
words as makes folks fast i' wedlock?&quot;  For the parson meant right,
and the bride and bridegroom meant right.  But then, when I come to
think on it, meanin' goes but a little way i' most things, for you
may mean to stick things together and your glue may be bad, and then
where are you?  And so I says to mysen, &quot;It isn't the meanin', it's
the glue.&quot;  And I was worreted as if I'd got three bells to pull at
once, when we went into the vestry, and they begun to sign their
names.  But where's the use o' talking? - you can't think what
goes on in a 'cute man's inside.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you held in for all that, didn't you, Mr. Macey?&quot;  said the
landlord.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, I held in tight till I was by mysen wi' Mr. Drumlow, and then
I out wi' everything, but respectful, as I allays did.  And he made
light on it, and he says, &quot;Pooh, pooh, Macey, make yourself easy,&quot;
he says; &quot;it's neither the meaning nor the words - it's the
re_ges_ter does it - that's the glue.&quot;  So you see he settled it
easy; for parsons and doctors know everything by heart, like, so as
they aren't worreted wi' thinking what's the rights and wrongs o'
things, as I'n been many and many's the time.  And sure enough the
wedding turned out all right, on'y poor Mrs. Lammeter - that's Miss
Osgood as was - died afore the lasses was growed up; but for
prosperity and everything respectable, there's no family more looked
on.&quot;</p>

<p>Every one of Mr. Macey's audience had heard this story many times,
but it was listened to as if it had been a favourite tune, and at
certain points the puffing of the pipes was momentarily suspended,
that the listeners might give their whole minds to the expected
words.  But there was more to come; and Mr. Snell, the landlord,
duly put the leading question.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, old Mr. Lammeter had a pretty fortin, didn't they say, when
he come into these parts?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yes,&quot; said Mr. Macey; &quot;but I daresay it's as much as this
Mr. Lammeter's done to keep it whole.  For there was allays a talk
as nobody could get rich on the Warrens: though he holds it cheap,
for it's what they call Charity Land.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, and there's few folks know so well as you how it come to be
Charity Land, eh, Mr. Macey?&quot;  said the butcher.</p>

<p>&quot;How should they?&quot;  said the old clerk, with some contempt.
&quot;Why, my grandfather made the grooms' livery for that Mr. Cliff as
came and built the big stables at the Warrens.  Why, they're stables
four times as big as Squire Cass's, for he thought o' nothing but
hosses and hunting, Cliff didn't - a Lunnon tailor, some folks
said, as had gone mad wi' cheating.  For he couldn't ride; lor bless
you!  they said he'd got no more grip o' the hoss than if his legs
had been cross-sticks: my grandfather heared old Squire Cass say so
many and many a time.  But ride he would, as if Old Harry had been
a-driving him; and he'd a son, a lad o' sixteen; and nothing would
his father have him do, but he must ride and ride - though the lad
was frighted, they said.  And it was a common saying as the father
wanted to ride the tailor out o' the lad, and make a gentleman on
him - not but what I'm a tailor myself, but in respect as God made
me such, I'm proud on it, for &quot;Macey, tailor&quot;, 's been wrote up over
our door since afore the Queen's heads went out on the shillings.
But Cliff, he was ashamed o' being called a tailor, and he was sore
vexed as his riding was laughed at, and nobody o' the gentlefolks
hereabout could abide him.  Howsomever, the poor lad got sickly and
died, and the father didn't live long after him, for he got queerer
nor ever, and they said he used to go out i' the dead o' the night,
wi' a lantern in his hand, to the stables, and set a lot o' lights
burning, for he got as he couldn't sleep; and there he'd stand,
cracking his whip and looking at his hosses; and they said it was a
mercy as the stables didn't get burnt down wi' the poor dumb
creaturs in 'em.  But at last he died raving, and they found as he'd
left all his property, Warrens and all, to a Lunnon Charity, and
that's how the Warrens come to be Charity Land; though, as for the
stables, Mr. Lammeter never uses 'em - they're out o' all charicter - 
lor bless you!  if you was to set the doors a-banging in 'em, it
'ud sound like thunder half o'er the parish.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, but there's more going on in the stables than what folks see
by daylight, eh, Mr. Macey?&quot;  said the landlord.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, aye; go that way of a dark night, that's all,&quot; said
Mr. Macey, winking mysteriously, &quot;and then make believe, if you
like, as you didn't see lights i' the stables, nor hear the stamping
o' the hosses, nor the cracking o' the whips, and howling, too, if
it's tow'rt daybreak.  &quot;Cliff's Holiday&quot; has been the name of it
ever sin' I were a boy; that's to say, some said as it was the
holiday Old Harry gev him from roasting, like.  That's what my
father told me, and he was a reasonable man, though there's folks
nowadays know what happened afore they were born better nor they
know their own business.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you say to that, eh, Dowlas?&quot;  said the landlord, turning
to the farrier, who was swelling with impatience for his cue.
&quot;There's a nut for <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span> to crack.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Dowlas was the negative spirit in the company, and was proud of
his position.</p>

<p>&quot;Say?  I say what a man <span style="text-decoration: underline">should</span> say as doesn't shut his eyes to
look at a finger-post.  I say, as I'm ready to wager any man ten
pound, if he'll stand out wi' me any dry night in the pasture before
the Warren stables, as we shall neither see lights nor hear noises,
if it isn't the blowing of our own noses.  That's what I say, and
I've said it many a time; but there's nobody 'ull ventur a ten-pun'
note on their ghos'es as they make so sure of.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Dowlas, that's easy betting, that is,&quot; said Ben Winthrop.
&quot;You might as well bet a man as he wouldn't catch the rheumatise if
he stood up to 's neck in the pool of a frosty night.  It 'ud be
fine fun for a man to win his bet as he'd catch the rheumatise.
Folks as believe in Cliff's Holiday aren't agoing to ventur near it
for a matter o' ten pound.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If Master Dowlas wants to know the truth on it,&quot; said Mr. Macey,
with a sarcastic smile, tapping his thumbs together, &quot;he's no call
to lay any bet - let him go and stan' by himself - there's nobody
'ull hinder him; and then he can let the parish'ners know if they're
wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you!  I'm obliged to you,&quot; said the farrier, with a snort
of scorn.  &quot;If folks are fools, it's no business o' mine.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span>
don't want to make out the truth about ghos'es: I know it a'ready.
But I'm not against a bet - everything fair and open.  Let any man
bet me ten pound as I shall see Cliff's Holiday, and I'll go and
stand by myself.  I want no company.  I'd as lief do it as I'd fill
this pipe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, but who's to watch you, Dowlas, and see you do it?  That's no
fair bet,&quot; said the butcher.</p>

<p>&quot;No fair bet?&quot;  replied Mr. Dowlas, angrily.  &quot;I should like to
hear any man stand up and say I want to bet unfair.  Come now,
Master Lundy, I should like to hear you say it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very like you would,&quot; said the butcher.  &quot;But it's no business
o' mine.  You're none o' my bargains, and I aren't a-going to try
and 'bate your price.  If anybody 'll bid for you at your own
vallying, let him.  I'm for peace and quietness, I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that's what every yapping cur is, when you hold a stick up at
him,&quot; said the farrier.  &quot;But I'm afraid o' neither man nor ghost,
and I'm ready to lay a fair bet.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> aren't a turn-tail cur.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, but there's this in it, Dowlas,&quot; said the landlord, speaking
in a tone of much candour and tolerance.  &quot;There's folks, i' my
opinion, they can't see ghos'es, not if they stood as plain as a
pike-staff before 'em.  And there's reason i' that.  For there's my
wife, now, can't smell, not if she'd the strongest o' cheese under
her nose.  I never see'd a ghost myself; but then I says to myself,
&quot;Very like I haven't got the smell for 'em.&quot;  I mean, putting a
ghost for a smell, or else contrairiways.  And so, I'm for holding
with both sides; for, as I say, the truth lies between 'em.  And if
Dowlas was to go and stand, and say he'd never seen a wink o'
Cliff's Holiday all the night through, I'd back him; and if anybody
said as Cliff's Holiday was certain sure, for all that, I'd back
<span style="text-decoration: underline">him</span> too.  For the smell's what I go by.&quot;</p>

<p>The landlord's analogical argument was not well received by the
farrier - a man intensely opposed to compromise.</p>

<p>&quot;Tut, tut,&quot; he said, setting down his glass with refreshed
irritation; &quot;what's the smell got to do with it?  Did ever a ghost
give a man a black eye?  That's what I should like to know.  If
ghos'es want me to believe in 'em, let 'em leave off skulking i' the
dark and i' lone places - let 'em come where there's company and
candles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As if ghos'es 'ud want to be believed in by anybody so ignirant!&quot;
said Mr. Macey, in deep disgust at the farrier's crass incompetence
to apprehend the conditions of ghostly phenomena.</p>
