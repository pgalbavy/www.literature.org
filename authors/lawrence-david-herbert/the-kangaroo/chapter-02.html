THE Somers-Callcott acquaintance did not progress very rapidly, after
the affair of the dahlias. Mrs. Callcott asked Mrs. Somers across to
look at their cottage, and Mrs. Somers went. Then Mrs. Somers asked Mrs.
Callcott back again. But both times Mr. Somers managed to be out of the
way, and managed to cast an invisible frost over the rencontre. He was
not going to be dragged in, no, he was not. He very much wanted to
borrow a pair of pincers and a chopper for an hour, to pull out a few
nails, and to split his little chunks of kindling that the dealer had
sent too thick. And the Callcotts were very ready to lend anything, if
they were only asked for it. But no, Richard Lovat wasn't going to ask.
Neither would he buy a chopper, because the travelling expenses had
reduced him to very low water. He preferred to wrestle with the chunks
of jarrah every morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Somers and Mrs. Callcott continued, however, to have a few friendly
words across the fence. Harriet learned that Jack was foreman in a
motor-works place, that he had been wounded in the jaw in the war, that
the surgeons had not been able to extract the bullet, because there was
nothing for it to &quot;back up against&quot; - and so he had carried the chunk of
lead in his gizzard for ten months, till suddenly it had rolled into his
throat and he had coughed it out. The jeweller had wanted Mrs. Callcott
to have it mounted in a brooch or a hatpin. It was a round ball of lead,
from a shell, as big as a marble, and weighing three or four ounces.
Mrs. Callcott had recoiled from this suggestion, so an elegant little
stand had been made, like a little lamp-post on a polished wood base,
and the black little globe of lead dangled by a fine chain like an
arc-lamp from the top of the toy lamp-post. It was now a mantelpiece
ornament.</p>

<p>All this Harriet related to the indignant Lovat, though she wisely
suppressed the fact that Mrs. Callcott had suggested that &quot;perhaps Mr.
Somers might like to have a look at it.&quot;</p>

<p>Lovat was growing more used to Australia - or to the &quot;cottage&quot; in Murdoch
Road, and the view of the harbour from the tub-top of his summer-house.
You couldn't call that all &quot;Australia&quot; - but then one man can't bite off
a continent in a mouthful, and you must start to nibble somewhere. He
and Harriet took numerous trips in the ferry steamers to the many nooks
and corners of the harbour. One day their ferry steamer bumped into a
collier that was heading for the harbour outlet - or rather, their ferry
boat headed across the nose of the collier, so the collier bumped into
them and had his nose put out of joint. There was a considerable amount
of yelling, but the ferry boat slid flatly away towards Manly, and
Harriet's excitement subsided.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, and a lovely sunny day of Australian winter. Manly is the
bathing suburb of Sydney - one of them. You pass quite close to the wide
harbour gate, The Heads, on the ferry steamer. Then you land on the
wharf, and walk up the street, like a bit of Margate with sea-side shops
and restaurants, till you come out on a promenade at the end, and there
is the wide Pacific rolling in on the yellow sand: the wide fierce sea,
that makes all the built-over land dwindle into non-existence. At least
there was a heavy swell on, so the Pacific belied its name and crushed
the earth with its rollers. Perhaps the heavy, earth-despising swell is
part of its pacific nature.</p>

<p>Harriet, of course, was enraptured, and declared she could not be happy
till she had lived beside the Pacific. They bought food and ate it by
the sea. Then Harriet was chilled, so they went to a restaurant for a
cup of soup. When they were again in the street Harriet realized that
she hadn't got her yellow scarf: her big, silky yellow scarf that was so
warm and lovely. She declared she had left it in the eating-house, and
they went back at once for it. The girls in the eating-house - the
waitresses - said, in their cheeky Cockney Australian that they &quot;hedn't
seen it&quot;, and that the &quot;next people who kyme arfter must 'ev tyken it&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it was gone - and Harriet furious, feeling as if there had been a
thief in the night. In this unhappy state of affairs Somers suggested
they should sit on the tram-car and go somewhere. They sat on the
tram-car and ran for miles along a coast with ragged bush loused over
with thousands of small promiscuous bungalows, built of everything from
patchwork of kerosene tin up to fine red brick and stucco, like Margate.
Not far off the Pacific boomed. But fifty yards inland started these
bits of swamp, and endless promiscuity of &quot;cottages&quot;.</p>

<p>The tram took them five or six miles, to the terminus. This was the end
of everywhere, with new &quot;stores&quot; - that is, flyblown shops with
corrugated iron roofs - and with a tramshelter, and little house-agents'
booths plastered with signs - and more &quot;cottages&quot;; that is, bungalows of
corrugated iron or brick - and bits of swamp or &quot;lagoon&quot; where the sea
had got in and couldn't get out. The happy couple had a drink of sticky
aerated waters in one of the &quot;stores&quot;, then walked up a wide sand-road
dotted on either side with small bungalows, beyond the backs of which
lay a whole aura of rusty tin cans chucked over the back fence. They
came to the ridge of sand, and again the pure, long-rolling Pacific.</p>

<p>&quot;I love the sea,&quot; said Harriet.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish,&quot; said Lovat, &quot;it would send a wave about fifty feet high round
the whole coast of Australia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are so bad-tempered,&quot; said Harriet. &quot;Why don't you see the lovely
things!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do, by contrast.&quot;</p>

<p>So they sat on the sands, and he peeled pears and buried the peel in the
yellow sand. It was winter, and the shore was almost deserted. But the
sun was warm as an English May.</p>

<p>Harriet felt she absolutely must live by the sea, so they wandered along
a wide, rutted space of deep sand, looking at the &quot;cottages&quot; on either
side. They had impossible names. But in themselves, many of them were
really nice. Yet there they stood like so many forlorn chicken-houses,
each on its own oblong patch of land, with a fence between it and its
neighbour. There was something indescribably weary and dreary about it.
The very ground the houses stood on seemed weary and drabbled, almost
asking for rusty tin cans. And so many pleasant little bungalows set
there in an improvised road, wide and weary - and then the effort had
lapsed. The tin shacks were almost a relief. They did not call for
geraniums and lobelias, as did the pretty Hampstead Garden Suburb
&quot;cottages&quot;. And these latter might call, but they called in vain. They
got bits of old paper and tins.</p>

<p>Yet Harriet absolutely wanted to live by the sea, so they stopped before
each bungalow that was to be let furnished. The estate agents went in
for abbreviations. On the boards at the corner of the fences it said
either &quot;4 Sale&quot; or &quot;2 Let&quot;. Probably there was a colonial intention of
jocularity. But it was almost enough for Somers. He would have died
rather than have put himself into one of those cottages.</p>

<p>The road ended on the salt pool where the sea had ebbed in. Across was a
state reserve - a bit of aboriginal Australia, with gum trees and empty
spaces beyond the flat salt waters. Near at hand a man was working away,
silently loading a boat with beach-sand, upon the lagoon. To the right
the sea was rolling on the shore, and spurting high on some brown rocks.
Two men in bathing suits were running over the spit of sand from the
lagoon to the surf, where two women in &quot;waders&quot;, those rubber
paddling-drawers into which we bundle our children at the seaside, were
paddling along the fringe of the foam. A blond young man wearing a
jacket over his bathing suit walked by with two girls. He had huge
massive legs, astonishing. And near at hand Somers saw another youth
lying on the warm sand-hill in the sun. He had rolled in the dry sand
while he was wet, so he was hardly distinguishable. But he lay like an
animal on his face in the sun, and again Somers wondered at the thick
legs. They seemed to run to leg, these people. Three boys, one a lad of
fifteen or so, came out of the warm lagoon in their bathing suits to
roll in the sand and play. The big lad crawled on all fours and the
little one rode on his back, and pitched off into the sand. They were
extraordinarily like real young animals, mindless as opossums, lunging
about.</p>

<p>This was Sunday afternoon. The sun was warm. The lonely man was just
pushing off his boat on the lagoon. It sat deep in the water, half full
of sand. Somers and Harriet lay on the sand-bank. Strange it was. And it
HAD a sort of fascination. Freedom! That's what they always say. &quot;You
feel free in Australia.&quot; And so you do. There is a great relief in the
atmosphere, a relief from tension, from pressure. An absence of control
or will or form. The sky is open above you, and the air is open around
you. Not the old closing-in of Europe.</p>

<p>But what then? The VACANCY of this freedom is almost terrifying. In the
openness and the freedom this new chaos, this litter of bungalows and
tin cans scattered for miles and miles, this Englishness all crumbled
out into formlessness and chaos. Even the heart of Sydney itself - an
imitation of London and New York, without any core or pith of meaning.
Business going on full speed: but only because it is the other end of
English and American business.</p>

<p>The absence of any inner meaning: and at the same time the great sense
of vacant spaces. The sense of irresponsible freedom. The sense of
do-as-you-please liberty. And all utterly uninteresting. What is more
hopelessly uninteresting than accomplished liberty? Great swarming,
teeming Sydney flowing out into these myriads of bungalows, like shallow
waters spreading, undyked. And what then? Nothing. No inner life, no
high command, no interest in anything, finally.</p>

<p>Somers turned over and shut his eyes. New countries were more
problematic than old ones. One loved the sense of release from old
pressure and old tight control, from the old world of water-tight
compartments. This was Sunday afternoon, but with none of the surfeited
dreariness of English Sunday afternoons. It was still a raw loose world.
All Sydney would be out by the sea or in the bush, a roving, unbroken
world. They all rushed from where they were to somewhere else, on
holidays. And to-morrow they'd all be working away, with just as little
meaning, working without any meaning, playing without any meaning; and
yet quite strenuous at it all. It was just dazing. Even the rush for
money had no real pip in it. They really cared very little for the power
that money can give. And except for the sense of power, that had no real
significance here. When all is said and done, even money is not much
good where there is no genuine culture. Money is a means to rising to a
higher, subtler, fuller state of consciousness, or nothing. And when you
flatly don't want a fuller consciousness, what good is your money to
you? Just to chuck about and gamble with. Even money is a European
invention - European and American. It has no real magic in Australia.</p>

<p>Poor Richard Lovat wearied himself to death struggling with the problem
of himself, and calling it Australia. There was no actual need for him
to struggle with Australia: he must have done it in the hedonistic
sense, to please himself. But it wore him to rags.</p>

<p>Harriet sat up and began dusting the sand from her coat - Lovat did
likewise. Then they rose to be going back to the tram-car. There was a
motor-car standing on the sand of the road near the gate of the end
house. The end house was called St. Columb, and Somers' heart flew to
Cornwall. It was quite a nice little place, standing on a bluff of sand
sideways above the lagoon.</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't mind that,&quot; said Harriet, looking up at St. Columb.</p>

<p>But Somers did not answer. He was shut against any of these humiliating
little bungalows. &quot;Love's Harbour&quot; he was just passing by, and it was &quot;4
Sale&quot;. It would be. He ploughed grimly through the sand.
&quot;Arcady&quot; - &quot;Stella Maris&quot; - &quot;Racketty-Coo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I say!&quot; called a voice from behind.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Callcott running unevenly over the sand after them, the
colour high in her cheeks. She wore a pale grey crepe de chine dress and
grey suede shoes. Some distance behind her Jack Callcott was following,
in his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>&quot;Fancy you being here!&quot; gasped Mrs. Callcott, and Harriet was so
flustered she could only cry:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, how do you do!&quot; - and effusively shake hands, as if she were meeting
some former acquaintance on Piccadilly. The shaking hands quite put Mrs.
Callcott off her track. She felt it almost an affront, and went red. Her
husband sauntered up and put his hands in his pockets, to avoid
mistakes.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha, what are YOU doing here,&quot; he said to the Somers pair. &quot;Wouldn't you
like a cup of tea?&quot;</p>

<p>Harriet glanced at Richard Lovat. He was smiling faintly.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, we should LOVE it,&quot; she replied to Mr. Callcott. &quot;But where? - have
you got a house here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My sister has the end house,&quot; said he.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but - will she want us?&quot; cried Harriet, backing out.</p>

<p>The Callcotts stood for a moment silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, if you like to come,&quot; said Jack. And it was evident he was aware
of Somers' desire to avoid contact.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I should be awfully grateful,&quot; said Harriet. &quot;Wouldn't you,
Lovat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, smiling to himself, feeling Jack's manly touch of
contempt for all this hedging.</p>

<p>So off they went to &quot;St. Columb&quot;. The sister was a brown-eyed Australian
with a decided manner, kindly, but a little suspicious of the two
newcomers. Her husband was a young Cornishman, rather stout and short
and silent. He had his hair cut round at the back, in a slightly rounded
line above a smooth, sunburnt, reddened nape of the neck. Somers found
out later that this young Cornishman - his name was Trewhella - had
married his brother's widow. Mrs. Callcott supplied Harriet later on
with all the information concerning her sister-in-law. The first
Trewhella, Alfred John, had died two years ago, leaving his wife with a
neat sum of money and this house, &quot;St. Columb&quot;, and also with a little
girl named Gladys, who came running in shaking her long brown hair just
after the Somers appeared. So the present Trewhellas were a
newly-married couple. The present husband, William James, went round in
a strange, silent fashion helping his wife Rose to prepare tea.</p>

<p>The bungalow was pleasant, a large room facing the sea, with verandahs
and other little rooms opening off. There were many family photographs,
and a framed medal and ribbon and letter praising the first Trewhella.
Mrs. Trewhella was alert and watchful, and decided to be genteel. So the
party sat around in the basket chairs and on the settles under the
windows, instead of sitting at table for tea. And William James silently
but willingly carried round the bread and butter and the cakes.</p>

<p>He was a queer young man, with an Irish-looking face, rather pale, an
odd kind of humour in his grey eye and in the corners of his pursed
mouth. But he spoke never a word. It was hard to decide his
age - probably about thirty - a little younger than his wife. He seemed
silently pleased about something - perhaps his marriage. Somers noticed
that the whites of his eyes were rather bloodshot. He had been in
Australia since he was a boy of fifteen - he had come with his
brother - from St. Columb, near Newquay - St. Columb Major. So much Somers
elicited.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, how do you like Sydney?&quot; came the inevitable question from Mrs.
Trewhella.</p>

<p>&quot;The harbour, I think, is wonderful,&quot; came Somers' invariable answer.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a fine harbour, isn't it. And Sydney is a fine town. Oh yes, I've
lived there all my life.&quot;</p>

<p>The conversation languished. Callcott was silent, and William James
seemed as if he were never anything else. Even the little girl fluttered
into a whisper and went still again. Everybody was a little embarrassed,
rather stiff: too genteel, or not genteel enough. And the men seemed
absolute logs.</p>

<p>&quot;You don't think much of Australia, then?&quot; said Jack to Somers.</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; answered the latter, &quot;how am I to judge! I haven't even seen the
fringe of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's mostly fringe,&quot; said Jack. &quot;But it hasn't made a good
impression on you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know yet. My feelings are mixed. The COUNTRY seems to me to
have a fascination - strange - .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you don't take to the Aussies, at first sight. Bit of a collision
between their aura and yours,&quot; smiled Jack.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe that's what it is,&quot; said Somers. &quot;That's a useful way of putting
it. I can't help my aura colliding, can I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course you can't. And if it's a tender sort of aura, of course it
feels the bump.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, don't talk about it,&quot; cried Harriet. &quot;He must be just one big bump,
by the way he grumbles.&quot;</p>

<p>They all laughed - perhaps a trifle uneasily.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought so,&quot; said Jack. &quot;What made you come here? Thought you'd like
to write about it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought I might like to live here - and write here,&quot; replied Somers
smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Write about the bushrangers and the heroine lost in the bush and
wandering into a camp of bullies?&quot; said Jack.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; said Somers.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mind if I ask you what sort of things you do write?&quot; said Jack,
with some delicacy.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh - poetry - essays.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Essays about what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh - rubbish mostly.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Lovat, don't be so silly. You KNOW you don't think your essays
rubbish,&quot; put in Harriet. &quot;They're about life, and democracy, and
equality, and all that sort of thing,&quot; Harriet explained.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes?&quot; said Jack. &quot;I'd like to read some.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; hesitated Harriet, &quot;He can lend you a volume - you've got some
with you, haven't you?&quot; she added, turning to Somers.</p>

<p>&quot;I've got one,&quot; admitted that individual, looking daggers at her.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you'll lend it to Mr. Callcott, won't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If he wants it. But it will only bore him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I might rise up to it, you know,&quot; said Jack laconically, &quot;if I bring
all my mental weight to bear on it.&quot;</p>

<p>Somers flushed, and laughed at the contradiction in metaphor.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not the loftiness,&quot; he said, rather amused. &quot;It's that people just
don't care to hear some things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, let me try,&quot; said Jack. &quot;We're a new country - and we're out to
learn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's exactly what we're not,&quot; broke out William James, with a Cornish
accent and a blurt of a laugh. &quot;We're out to show to everybody that we
know everything there is to be known.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's some of us,&quot; said Jack.</p>

<p>&quot;And most of us,&quot; said William James.</p>

<p>&quot;Have it your own way, boy. But let us speak for the minority. And
there's a minority that knows we've got to learn a big lesson - and
that's willing to learn it.&quot;</p>

<p>Again there was silence. The women seemed almost effaced.</p>

<p>&quot;There's one thing,&quot; thought Somers to himself, &quot;when these Colonials DO
speak seriously, they speak like men, not like babies.&quot; He looked up at
Jack.</p>

<p>&quot;It's the world that's got to learn a lesson,&quot; he said. &quot;Not only
Australia.&quot; His tone was acid and sinister. And he looked with his hard,
pale blue eyes at Callcott. Callcott's eyes, brown and less
concentrated, less hard, looked back curiously at the other man.</p>

<p>&quot;Possibly it is,&quot; he said. &quot;But my job is Australia.&quot;</p>

<p>Somers watched him. Callcott had a pale, clean-shaven, lean face with
close-shut lips. But his lips weren't bitten in until they just formed a
slit, as they so often are in Colonials. And his eyes had a touch of
mystery, of aboriginal darkness.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you care very much for Australia?&quot; said Somers, a little wistfully.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe I do,&quot; said Jack. &quot;But if I was out of a job like plenty of
other unlucky diggers, I suppose I should care more about getting a
job.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you care very much about your Australia?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My Australia? Yes, I own about seven acres of it, all told. I suppose I
care very much about that. I pay my taxes on it, all right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, but the future of Australia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll never see me on a platform shouting about it.&quot;</p>

<p>The Lovats said they must be going.</p>

<p>&quot;If you like to crowd in,&quot; said Jack, &quot;we can take you in the car. We
can squeeze in Mr. Somers in front, and there'll be plenty of room for
the others at the back, if Gladys sits on her Dad's knee.&quot;</p>

<p>This time Somers accepted at once. He felt the halting refusals were
becoming ridiculous.</p>

<p>They left at sunset. The west, over the land, was a clear gush of light
up from the departed sun. The east, over the Pacific, was a tall concave
of rose-coloured clouds, a marvellous high apse. Now the bush had gone
dark and spectral again, on the right hand. You might still imagine
inhuman presences moving among the gum trees. And from time to time, on
the left hand, they caught sight of the long green rollers of the
Pacific, with the star-white foam, and behind that the dusk-green sea
glimmered over with smoky rose, reflected from the eastern horizon where
the bank of flesh-rose colour and pure smoke-blue lingered a long time,
like magic, as if the sky's rim were cooling down. It seemed to Somers
characteristic of Australia, this far-off flesh-rose bank of colour on
the sky's horizon, so tender and unvisited, topped with the smoky,
beautiful blueness. And then the thickness of the night's stars
overhead, and one star very brave in the last effulgence of sunset,
westward over the continent. As soon as night came, all the raggletaggle
of amorphous white settlements disappeared, and the continent of the
Kangaroo reassumed its strange, unvisited glamour, a kind of virgin
sensual aloofness.</p>

<p>Somers sat in front between Jack and Victoria Callcott, because he was
so slight. He made himself as small as he could, like the ham in the
sandwich. When he looked her way, he found Victoria watching him under
her lashes, and as she met his eyes, she flared into a smile that filled
him with wonder. She had such a charming, innocent look, like an
innocent girl, naive and a little gawky. Yet the strange exposed smile
she gave him in the dusk. It puzzled him to know what to make of it.
Like an offering - and yet innocent. Perhaps like the sacred prostitutes
of the temple: acknowledgement of the sacredness of the act. He chose
not to think of it, and stared away across the bonnet of the car at the
fading land.</p>

<p>Queer, thought Somers, this girl at once sees perhaps the most real me,
and most women take me for something I am not at all. Queer to be
recognized at once, as if one were of the same family.</p>

<p>He had to admit that he was flattered also. She seemed to see the wonder
in him. And she had none of the European women's desire to make a
conquest of him, none of that feminine rapacity which is so hateful in
the old world. She seemed like an old Greek girl bringing an offering to
the altar of the mystic Bacchus. The offering of herself.</p>

<p>Her husband sat steering the car and smoking his short pipe in silence.
He seemed to have something to think about. At least he had considerable
power of silence, a silence which made itself felt. Perhaps he knew his
wife much better than anyone else. At any rate he did not feel it
necessary to keep an eye on her. If she liked to look at Somers with a
strange, exposed smile, that was her affair. She could do as she liked
in that direction, so far as he, Jack Callcott, was concerned. She was
his wife: she knew it, and he knew it. And it was quite established and
final. So long as she did not betray what was between her and him, as
husband and wife, she could do as she liked with the rest of herself.
And he could, quite rightly, trust her to be faithful to that
undefinable relation which subsisted between them as man and wife. He
didn't pretend and didn't want to occupy the whole field of her
consciousness.</p>

<p>And in just the same way, that bond which connected himself with her, he
would always keep unbroken for his part. But that did not mean that he
was sworn body and soul to his wife. Oh no. There was a good deal of him
which did not come into the marriage bond, and with all this part of
himself he was free to make the best he could, according to his own
idea. He loved her, quite sincerely, for her naive sophisticated
innocence which allowed him to be unknown to her, except in so far as
they were truly and intimately related. It was the innocence which has
been through the fire, and knows its own limitations. In the same way he
quite consciously chose not to know anything more about her than just so
much as entered into the absolute relationship between them. He quite
definitely did not want to absorb her, or to occupy the whole field of
her nature. He would trust her to go her own way, only keeping her to
the pledge that was between them. What this pledge consisted in he did
not try to define. It was something indefinite: the field of contact
between their two personalities. Where their two personalities met and
joined, they were one, and pledged to permanent fidelity. But that part
in each of them which did not belong to the other was free from all
enquiry or even from knowledge. Each silently consented to leave the
other in large part unknown, unknown in word and deed and very being.
They didn't WANT to know - too much knowledge would be like shackles.</p>

<p>Such marriage is established on a very subtle sense of honour and of
individual integrity. It seems as if each race and continent has its own
marriage instinct. And the instinct that develops in Australia will
certainly not be the same as the instinct that develops in America. And
each people must follow its own instinct, if it is to live, not matter
whether the marriage law be universal or not.</p>

<p>The Callcotts had come to no agreement, verbally, as to their marriage.
They had not thought it out. They were Australians, of strongly,
subtly-developed desire for freedom, and with considerable indifference
to old formulae and the conventions based thereon. So they took their
stand instinctively and calmly. Jack had defined his stand as far as he
found necessary. If his wife was good to him and satisfied him in so far
as HE went, then he was pledged to trust her to do as she liked outside
his ken, outside his range. He would make a cage for nobody. This he
openly propounded to his mates: to William James, for example, and later
to Somers. William James said yes, but thought the more. Somers was
frankly disturbed, not liking the thought of applying the same
prescription to his own marriage.</p>

<p>They put down the Trewhellas at their house in North Sydney, and went on
to Murdoch Road over the ferry. Jack had still to take the car down to
the garage in town. Victoria said she would prepare the high tea which
takes the place of dinner and supper in Australia, against his return.
So Harriet boldly invited them to this high tea - a real substantial meal
in her own house. Victoria was to help her prepare it, and Jack was to
come straight back to Torestin. Victoria was as pleased as a lamb with
two tails over this arrangement, and went in to change her dress.</p>

<p>Somers knew why Harriet had launched this invitation. It was because she
had had a wonderfully successful cooking morning. Like plenty of other
women Harriet had learned to cook during war-time, and now she loved it,
once in a while. This had been one of the whiles. Somers had stoked the
excellent little stove, and peeled the apples and potatoes and onions
and pumpkin, and looked after the meat and the sauces, while Harriet had
lashed out in pies and tarts and little cakes and baked custard. She now
surveyed her prize Beeton shelf with love, and began to whisk up a
mayonnaise for potato salad.</p>

<p>Victoria appeared in a pale gauze dress of pale pink with little dabs of
gold - a sort of tea-party dress - and with her brown hair loosely knotted
behind, and with innocent sophistication pulled a bit untidy over her
womanly forehead, she looked winsome. Her colour was very warm, and she
was gawkily excited. Harriet put on an old yellow silk frock, and Somers
changed into a dark suit. For tea there was cold roast pork with
first-class brown crackling on it, and potato salad, beetroot, and
lettuce, and apple chutney; then a dressed lobster - or crayfish, very
good, pink and white; and then apple pie and custard-tarts and cakes and
a dish of apples and passion fruits and oranges, a pine-apple and some
bananas: and of course big cups of tea, breakfast-cups.</p>

<p>Victoria and Harriet were delighted, Somers juggled with colour-schemes
on the table, the one central room in the bungalow was brilliantly
lighted, and the kettle sang on the hearth. After months of India, with
all the Indian decorum and two silent men-servants waiting at table: and
after the old-fashioned gentility of the P. and O. steamer, Somers and
Harriet felt this show rather a come-down maybe, but still good fun.
Victoria felt it was almost &quot;society&quot;. They waited for Jack.</p>

<p>Jack arrived bending forward rather in the doorway, a watchful look on
his pale, clean-shaven face, and that atmosphere of silence about him
which is characteristic of many Australians.</p>

<p>&quot;Kept you waiting?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;We were just ready for you,&quot; said Harriet.</p>

<p>Jack had to carve the meat, because Somers was so bad at it and didn't
like doing it. Harriet poured the great cups of tea. Callcott looked
with a quick eye round the table to see exactly what he wanted to eat,
and Victoria peeped through her lashes to see exactly how Harriet
behaved. As Harriet always behaved in the vaguest manner possible, and
ate her sweets with her fish-fork and her soup with her pudding spoon, a
study of her table manners was not particularly profitable.</p>

<p>To Somers it was like being back twenty-five years, back in an English
farm-house in the Midlands, at Sunday tea. He had gone a long way from
the English Midlands, and got out of the way of them. Only to find them
here again, with hardly a change. To Harriet it was all novel and fun.
But Richard Lovat felt vaguely depressed.</p>

<p>The pleasant heartiness of the life he had known as a boy now depressed
him. He hated the promiscuous mixing in of all the company, the lack of
reserve in manner. He had preferred India for that: the gulf between the
native servants and the whites kept up a sort of tone. He had learned to
be separate, to talk across a slight distance. And that was an immense
relief to him, because it was really more his nature. Now he found
himself soused again in the old familiar jolly and cosy, spirit of his
childhood and boyhood, and he was depressed.</p>

<p>Jack, of course, had a certain reserve. But of a different sort. Not a
physical reserve. He did keep his coat on, but he might as well have sat
there in his shirt-sleeves. His very silence was, so to speak, in its
shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>There was a curious battle in silence going on between the two men. To
Harriet, all this familiar shirt-sleeve business was just fun, the
charades. In her most gushing genial moments she was still only
masquerading inside her class - the &quot;upper&quot; class of Europe. But Somers
was of the people himself, and he had that alert INSTINCT of the common
people, the instinctive knowledge of what his neighbour was wanting and
thinking, and the instinctive necessity to answer. With the other
classes, there is a certain definite breach between individual and
individual, and not much goes across except what is intended to go
across. But with the common people, and with most Australians, there is
no breach. The communication is silent and involuntary, the give and
take flows like waves from person to person, and each one knows: unless
he is foiled by speech. Each one knows in silence, reciprocates in
silence, and the talk as a rule just babbles on, on the surface. This is
the common people among themselves. But there is this difference in
Australia. Each individual seems to feel himself pledged to put himself
aside, to keep himself at least half out of count. The whole geniality
is based on a sort of code of &quot;You put yourself aside, and I'll put
myself aside.&quot; This is done with a watchful will: a sort of duel. And
above this, a great geniality. But the continual holding most of himself
aside, out of count, makes a man go blank in his withheld self. And
that, too, is puzzling.</p>

<p>Probably this is more true of the men than of the women. Probably women
change less, from land to land, play fewer &quot;code&quot; tricks with
themselves. At any rate, Harriet and Victoria got on like a house on
fire, and as they were both beautiful women, and both looking well as
they talked, everything seemed splendid. But Victoria was really paying
just a wee bit of homage all the time, homage to the superior class.</p>

<p>As for the two men: Somers SEEMED a gentleman, and Jack didn't want to
be a gentleman. Somers SEEMED a real gentleman. And yet Jack recognized
in him at once the intuitive response which only subsists, normally,
between members of the same class: between the common people. Perhaps
the best of the upper classes have the same intuitive understanding of
their fellow-man: but there is always a certain reserve in the response,
a preference for the non-intuitive forms of communication, for
deliberate speech. What is not said is supposed not to exist: that is
almost code of honour with the other classes. With the true common
people, only that which is NOT said is of any vital significance.</p>

<p>Which brings us back to Jack and Somers. The one thing Somers had kept,
and which he possessed in a very high degree, was the power of intuitive
communication with others. Much as he wanted to be alone, to stand clear
from the weary business of unanimity with everybody, he had never chosen
really to suspend this power of intuitive response: not till he was
personally offended, and then it switched off and became a blank wall.
But the smallest act of real kindness would call it back to life again.</p>

<p>Jack had been generous, and Somers liked him. Therefore he could not
withhold his soul from responding to him, in a measure. And Jack, what
did he want? He saw this other little fellow, a gentleman, apparently,
and yet different, not exactly a gentleman. And he wanted to know him,
to talk to him. He wanted to get at the bottom of him. For there was
something about Somers - he might be a German, he might be a bolshevist,
he might be anything, and he MUST be something, because he was
different, a gentleman and not a gentleman. He was different because,
when he looked at you, he knew you more or less in your own terms, not
as an outsider. He looked at you as if he were one of your own sort. He
answered you intuitively as if he were one of your own sort. And yet he
had the speech and the clear definiteness of a gentleman. Neither one
thing nor the other. And he seemed to know a lot, Jack was sure that
Somers knew a lot, and could tell him a lot, if he would but let it out.</p>

<p>If he had been just a gentleman, of course, Jack would never have
thought of wanting him to open out. Because a gentleman has nothing to
open towards a man of the people. He can only talk, and the working man
can only listen across a distance. But seeing that this little fellow
was born a gentleman and not a gentleman; seeing he was just like one of
yourselves, and yet had all the other qualities of a gentleman: why, you
might just as well get the secret out of him.</p>

<p>Somers knew the attitude, and was not going to be drawn. He talked
freely and pleasantly enough - but never as Jack wanted. He knew well
enough what Jack wanted: which was that they should talk together as man
to man - as pals, you know, with a little difference. But Somers would
never be pals with any man. It wasn't in his nature. He talked
pleasantly and familiarly - fascinating to Victoria, who sat with her
brown eyes watching him, while she clung to Jack's arm on the sofa. When
Somers was talking and telling, it was fascinating, and his quick,
mobile face changed and seemed full of magic. Perhaps it was difficult
to locate any definite SOMERS, any one individual in all this ripple of
animation and communication. The man himself seemed lost in the bright
aura of his rapid consciousness. This fascinated Victoria: she of course
imagined some sort of God in the fiery bush. But Jack was mistrustful.
He mistrusted all this bright quickness. If there was an individual
inside the brightly-burning bush of consciousness, let him come out, man
to man. Even if it was a sort of God in the bush, let him come out, man
to man. Otherwise let him be considered a sort of mountebank, a
show-man, too clever by half.</p>

<p>Somers knew pretty well Jack's estimation of him. Jack, sitting there
smoking his little short pipe, with his lovely wife in her pink
georgette frock hanging on to his side, and the watchful look on his
face, was the manly man, the consciously manly man. And he had just a
bit of contempt for the brilliant little fellow opposite, and he felt
just a bit uneasy because the same little fellow laughed at his
&quot;manliness&quot;, knowing it didn't go right through. It takes more than
&quot;manliness&quot; to make a man.</p>

<p>Somers' very brilliance had an overtone of contempt in it, for the other
man. The women, of course, not demanding any orthodox &quot;manliness&quot;,
didn't mind the knock at Jack's particular sort. And to them Somers'
chief fascination lay in the fact that he was never &quot;pals&quot;. They were
too deeply women to care for the sham of pals.</p>

<p>So Jack went home after a whisky and soda with his nose a little bit out
of joint. The little man was never going to be pals, that was the first
fact to be digested. And he couldn't be despised as a softy, he was too
keen; he just laughed at the other man's attempt at despising him. Yet
Jack did want to get at him, somehow or other.</p>
