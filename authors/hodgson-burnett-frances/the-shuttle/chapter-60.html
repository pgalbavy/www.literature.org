<p>Of these things, as of others, she had come to her solitude to think.
She looked out over the marshes scarcely seeing the wandering or resting
sheep, scarcely hearing the crying plover, because so much seemed
to confront her, and she must look it all well in the face. She had
fulfilled the promise she had made to herself as a child. She had come
in search of Rosy, she had found her as simple and loving of heart as
she had ever been. The most painful discoveries she had made had
been concealed from her mother until their aspect was modified. Mrs.
Vanderpoel need now feel no shock at the sight of the restored Rosy.
Lady Anstruthers had been still young enough to respond both physically
and mentally to love, companionship, agreeable luxuries, and stimulating
interests. But for Nigel's antagonism there was now no reason why
she should not be taken home for a visit to her family, and her
long-yearned-for New York, no reason why her father and mother should
not come to Stornham, and thus establish the customary social relations
between their daughter's home and their own. That this seemed out of the
question was owing to the fact that at the outset of his married life
Sir Nigel had allowed himself to commit errors in tactics. A perverse
egotism, not wholly normal in its rancour, had led him into deeds which
he had begun to suspect of having cost him too much, even before Betty
herself had pointed out to him their unbusinesslike indiscretion. He had
done things he could not undo, and now, to his mind, his only resource
was to treat them boldly as having been the proper results of decision
founded on sound judgment, which he had no desire to excuse. A
sufficiently arrogant loftiness of bearing would, he hoped, carry him
through the matter. This Betty herself had guessed, but she had not
realised that this loftiness of attitude was in danger of losing some
of its effectiveness through his being increasingly stung and spurred
by circumstances and feelings connected with herself, which were at
once exasperating and at times almost overpowering. When, in his mingled
dislike and admiration, he had begun to study his sister-in-law, and
the half-amused weaving of the small plots which would make things
sufficiently unpleasant to be used as factors in her removal from the
scene, if necessary, he had not calculated, ever so remotely, on the
chance of that madness besetting him which usually besets men only
in their youth. He had imagined no other results to himself than a
subtly-exciting private entertainment, such as would give spice to the
dullness of virtuous life in the country. But, despite himself and his
intentions, he had found the situation alter. His first uncertainty of
himself had arisen at the Dunholm ball, when he had suddenly realised
that he was detesting men who, being young and free, were at liberty to
pay gallant court to the new beauty.
</p><p>Perhaps the most disturbing thing to him had been his consciousness of
his sudden leap of antagonism towards Mount Dunstan, who, despite his
obvious lack of chance, somehow especially roused in him the rage of
warring male instinct. There had been admissions he had been forced,
at length, to make to himself. You could not, it appeared, live in the
house with a splendid creature like this one--with her brilliant eyes,
her beauty of line and movement before you every hour, her bloom, her
proud fineness holding themselves wholly in their own keeping--without
there being the devil to pay. Lately he had sometimes gone hot and cold
in realising that, having once told himself that he might choose to
decide to get rid of her, he now knew that the mere thought of her
sailing away of her own choice was maddening to him. There WAS the devil
to pay! It sometimes brought back to him that hideous shakiness of nerve
which had been a feature of his illness when he had been on the Riviera
with Teresita.
</p><p>Of all this Betty only knew the outward signs which, taken at their
exterior significance, were detestable enough, and drove her hard as she
mentally dwelt on them in connection with other things. How easy, if she
stood alone, to defy his evil insolence to do its worst, and leaving the
place at an hour's notice, to sail away to protection, or, if she chose
to remain in England, to surround herself with a bodyguard of the people
in whose eyes his disrepute relegated a man such as Nigel Anstruthers
to powerless nonentity. Alone, she could have smiled and turned her back
upon him. But she was here to take care of Rosy. She occupied a position
something like that of a woman who remains with a man and endures
outrage because she cannot leave her child. That thought, in itself,
brought Ughtred to her mind. There was Ughtred to be considered as
well as his mother. Ughtred's love for and faith in her were deep and
passionate things. He fed on her tenderness for him, and had grown
stronger because he spent hours of each day talking, reading, and
driving with her. The simple truth was that neither she nor Rosalie
could desert Ughtred, and so long as Nigel managed cleverly enough, the
law would give the boy to his father.
</p><p>“You are obliged to prove things, you know, in a court of law,” he had
said, as if with casual amiability, on a certain occasion. “Proving
things is the devil. People lose their tempers and rush into rows which
end in lawsuits, and then find they can prove nothing. If I were a
villain,” slightly showing his teeth in an agreeable smile--“instead
of a man of blameless life, I should go in only for that branch of my
profession which could be exercised without leaving stupid evidence
behind.”
</p><p>Since his return to Stornham the outward decorum of his own conduct had
entertained him and he had kept it up with an increasing appreciation of
its usefulness in the present situation. Whatsoever happened in the end,
it was the part of discretion to present to the rural world about him an
appearance of upright behaviour. He had even found it amusing to go to
church and also to occasionally make amiable calls at the vicarage. It
was not difficult, at such times, to refer delicately to his regret that
domestic discomfort had led him into the error of remaining much away
from Stornham. He knew that he had been even rather touching in his
expression of interest in the future of his son, and the necessity of
the boy's being protected from uncontrolled hysteric influences. And, in
the years of Rosalie's unprotected wretchedness, he had taken excellent
care that no “stupid evidence” should be exposed to view.
</p><p>Of all this Betty was thinking and summing up definitely, point after
point. Where was the wise and practical course of defence? The most
unthinkable thing was that one could find one's self in a position in
which action seemed inhibited. What could one do? To send for her father
would surely end the matter--but at what cost to Rosy, to Ughtred, to
Ffolliott, before whom the fair path to dignified security had so newly
opened itself? What would be the effect of sudden confusion, anguish,
and public humiliation upon Rosalie's carefully rebuilt health and
strength--upon her mother's new hope and happiness? At moments it seemed
as if almost all that had been done might be undone. She was beset by
such a moment now, and felt for the time, at least, like a creature tied
hand and foot while in full strength.
</p><p>Certainly she was not prepared for the event which happened. Roland
stiffened his ears, and, beginning a rumbling growl, ended it suddenly,
realising it an unnecessary precaution.
</p><p>He knew the man walking up the incline of the mound from the side behind
them. So did Betty know him. It was Sir Nigel looking rather glowering
and pale and walking slowly. He had discovered where she had meant to
take refuge, and had probably ridden to some point where he could leave
his horse and follow her at the expense of taking a short cut which
saved walking.
</p><p>As he climbed the mound to join her, Betty rose to her feet.
</p><p>“My dear girl,” he said, “don't get up as if you meant to go away. It
has cost me some exertion to find you.”
</p><p>“It will not cost you any exertion to lose me,” was her light answer. “I
AM going away.”
</p><p>He had reached her, and stood still before her with scarcely a yard's
distance between them. He was slightly out of breath and even a trifle
livid. He leaned on his stick and his look at her combined leaping bad
temper with something deeper.
</p><p>“Look here!” he broke out, “why do you make such a point of treating me
like the devil?”
</p><p>Betty felt her heart give a hastened beat, not of fear, but of
repulsion. This was the mood and manner which subjugated Rosalie. He had
so raised his voice that two men in the distance, who might be either
labourers or sportsmen, hearing its high tone, glanced curiously towards
them.
</p><p>“Why do you ask me a question which is totally absurd?” she said.
</p><p>“It is not absurd,” he answered. “I am speaking of facts, and I intend
to come to some understanding about them.”
</p><p>For reply, after meeting his look a few seconds, she simply turned her
back and began to walk away. He followed and overtook her.
</p><p>“I shall go with you, and I shall say what I want to say,” he persisted.
“If you hasten your pace I shall hasten mine. I cannot exactly see you
running away from me across the marsh, screaming. You wouldn't care to
be rescued by those men over there who are watching us. I should explain
myself to them in terms neither you nor Rosalie would enjoy. There! I
knew Rosalie's name would pull you up. Good God! I wish I were a weak
fool with a magnificent creature protecting me at all risks.”
</p><p>If she had not had blood and fire in her veins, she might have found
it easy to answer calmly. But she had both, and both leaped and beat
furiously for a few seconds. It was only human that it should be so. But
she was more than a passionate girl of high and trenchant spirit, and
she had learned, even in the days at the French school, what he had
never been able to learn in his life--self-control. She held herself in
as she would have held in a horse of too great fire and action. She
was actually able to look--as the first Reuben Vanderpoel would have
looked--at her capital of resource. But it meant taut holding of the
reins.
</p><p>“Will you tell me,” she said, stopping, “what it is you want?”
</p><p>“I want to talk to you. I want to tell you truths you would rather
be told here than on the high road, where people are passing--or at
Stornham, where the servants would overhear and Rosalie be thrown into
hysterics. You will NOT run screaming across the marsh, because I should
run screaming after you, and we should both look silly. Here is a rather
scraggy tree. Will you sit on the mound near it--for Rosalie's sake?”
</p><p>“I will not sit down,” replied Betty, “but I will listen, because it is
not a bad idea that I should understand you. But to begin with, I will
tell you something.” She stopped beneath the tree and stood with her
back against its trunk. “I pick up things by noticing people closely,
and I have realised that all your life you have counted upon getting
your own way because you saw that people--especially women--have a
horror of public scenes, and will submit to almost anything to avoid
them. That is true very often, but not always.”
</p><p>Her eyes, which were well opened, were quite the blue of steel, and
rested directly upon him. “I, for instance, would let you make a scene
with me anywhere you chose--in Bond Street--in Piccadilly--on the steps
of Buckingham Palace, as I was getting out of my carriage to attend a
drawing-room--and you would gain nothing you wanted by it--nothing. You
may place entire confidence in that statement.”
</p><p>He stared back at her, momentarily half-magnetised, and then broke forth
into a harsh half-laugh.
</p><p>“You are so damned handsome that nothing else matters. I'm hanged if it
does!” and the words were an exclamation. He drew still nearer to her,
speaking with a sort of savagery. “Cannot you see that you could do
what you pleased with me? You are too magnificent a thing for a man to
withstand. I have lost my head and gone to the devil through you. That
is what I came to say.”
</p><p>In the few seconds of silence that followed, his breath came quickly
again and he was even paler than before.
</p><p>“You came to me to say THAT?” asked Betty.
</p><p>“Yes--to say it before you drove me to other things.”
</p><p>Her gaze was for a moment even slightly wondering. He presented the
curious picture of a cynical man of the world, for the time being ruled
and impelled only by the most primitive instincts. To a clear-headed
modern young woman of the most powerful class, he--her sister's
husband--was making threatening love as if he were a savage chief and
she a savage beauty of his tribe. All that concerned him was that he
should speak and she should hear--that he should show her he was the
stronger of the two.
</p><p>“Are you QUITE mad?” she said.
</p><p>“Not quite,” he answered; “only three parts--but I am beyond my own
control. That is the best proof of what has happened to me. You are an
arrogant piece and you would defy me if you stood alone, but you don't,
and, by the Lord! I have reached a point where I will make use of every
lever I can lay my hand on--yourself, Rosalie, Ughtred, Ffolliott--the
whole lot of you!”
</p><p>The thing which was hardest upon her was her knowledge of her own
strength--of what she might have allowed herself of flaming words and
instant action--but for the memory of Rosy's ghastly little face, as
it had looked when she cried out, “You must not think of me. Betty, go
home--go home!” She held the white desperation of it before her mental
vision and answered him even with a certain interested deliberateness.
</p><p>“Do you know,” she inquired, “that you are talking to me as though you
were the villain in the melodrama?”
</p><p>“There is an advantage in that,” he answered, with an unholy smile. “If
you repeat what I say, people will only think that you are indulging
in hysterical exaggeration. They don't believe in the existence of
melodrama in these days.”
</p><p>The cynical, absolute knowledge of this revealed so much that nerve was
required to face it with steadiness.
</p><p>“True,” she commented. “Now I think I understand.”
</p><p>“No, you don't,” he burst forth. “You have spent your life standing on a
golden pedestal, being kowtowed to, and you imagine yourself immune from
difficulties because you think you can pay your way out of anything. But
you will find that you cannot pay your way out of this--or rather you
cannot pay Rosalie's way out of it.”
</p><p>“I shall not try. Go on,” said the girl. “What I do not understand, you
must explain to me. Don't leave anything unsaid.”
</p><p>“Good God, what a woman you are!” he cried out bitterly. He had never
seen such beauty in his life as he saw in her as she stood with her
straight young body flat against the tree. It was not a matter of deep
colour of eye, or high spirit of profile--but of something which burned
him. Still as she was, she looked like a flame. She made him feel old
and body-worn, and all the more senselessly furious.
</p><p>“I believe you hate me,” he raged. “And I may thank my wife for that.”
 Then he lost himself entirely. “Why cannot you behave well to me? If you
will behave well to me, Rosalie shall go her own way. If you even
looked at me as you look at other men--but you do not. There is always
something under your lashes which watches me as if I were a wild beast
you were studying. Don't fancy yourself a dompteuse. I am not your man.
I swear to you that you don't know what you are dealing with. I swear
to you that if you play this game with me I will drag you two down if I
drag myself with you. I have nothing much to lose. You and your sister
have everything.”
</p><p>“Go on,” Betty said briefly.
</p><p>“Go on! Yes, I will go on. Rosalie and Ffolliott I hold in the hollow
of my hand. As for you--do you know that people are beginning to discuss
you? Gossip is easily stirred in the country, where people are so bored
that they chatter in self-defence. I have been considered a bad lot. I
have become curiously attached to my sister-in-law. I am seen hanging
about her, hanging over her as we ride or walk alone together. An
American young woman is not like an English girl--she is used to seeing
the marriage ceremony juggled with. There's a trifle of prejudice
against such young women when they are too rich and too handsome. Don't
look at me like that!” he burst forth, with maddened sharpness, “I won't
have it!”
</p><p>The girl was regarding him with the expression he most resented--the
reflection of a normal person watching an abnormal one, and studying his
abnormality.
</p><p>“Do you know that you are raving?” she said, with quiet
curiosity--“raving?”
</p><p>Suddenly he sat down on the low mound near him, and as he touched his
forehead with his handkerchief, she saw that his hand actually shook.
</p><p>“Yes,” he answered, panting, “but 'ware my ravings! They mean what they
say.”
</p><p>“You do yourself an injury when you give way to them”--steadily, even
with a touch of slow significance--“a physical injury. I have noticed
that more than once.”
</p><p>He sprang to his feet again. Every drop of blood left his face. For
a second he looked as if he would strike her. His arm actually flung
itself out--and fell.
</p><p>“You devil!” he gasped. “You count on that? You she-devil!”
</p><p>She left her tree and stood before him.
</p><p>“Listen to me,” she said. “You intimate that you have been laying
melodramatic plots against me which will injure my good name. That
is rubbish. Let us leave it at that. You threaten that you will break
Rosy's heart and take her child from her, you say also that you will
wound and hurt my mother to her death and do your worst to ruin an
honest man----”
</p><p>“And, by God, I will!” he raged. “And you cannot stop me, if----”
</p><p>“I do not know whether I can stop you or not, though you may be sure
I will try,” she interrupted him, “but that is not what I was going to
say.” She drew a step nearer, and there was something in the intensity
of her look which fascinated and held him for a moment. She was
curiously grave. “Nigel, I believe in certain things you do not believe
in. I believe black thoughts breed black ills to those who think them.
It is not a new idea. There is an old Oriental proverb which says,
'Curses, like chickens, come home to roost.' I believe also that
the worst--the very worst CANNOT be done to those who think
steadily--steadily--only of the best. To you that is merely superstition
to be laughed at. That is a matter of opinion. But--don't go on with
this thing--DON'T GO ON WITH IT. Stop and think it over.”
</p><p>He stared at her furiously--tried to laugh outright, and failed because
the look in her eyes was so odd in its strength and stillness.
</p><p>“You think you can lay some weird spell upon me,” he jeered
sardonically.
</p><p>“No, I don't,” she answered. “I could not if I would. It is no affair of
mine. It is your affair only--and there is nothing weird about it. Don't
go on, I tell you. Think better of it.”
</p><p>She turned about without further speech, and walked away from him with
light swiftness over the marsh. Oddly enough, he did not even attempt to
follow her. He felt a little weak--perhaps because a certain thing she
had said had brought back to him a familiar touch of the horrors. She
had the eyes of a falcon under the odd, soft shade of the extraordinary
lashes. She had seen what he thought no one but himself had realised.
Having watched her retreating figure for a few seconds, he sat down--as
suddenly as before--on the mound near the tree.
</p><p>“Oh, damn her!” he said, his damp forehead on his hands. “Damn the whole
universe!”
</p><p>. . . . .
</p><p>When Betty and Roland reached Stornham, the wicker-work pony chaise from
the vicarage stood before the stone entrance steps. The drawing-room
door was open, and Mrs. Brent was standing near it saying some last
words to Lady Anstruthers before leaving the house, after a visit
evidently made with an object. This Betty gathered from the solemnity of
her manner.
</p><p>“Betty,” said Lady Anstruthers, catching sight of her, “do come in for a
moment.”
</p><p>When Betty entered, both her sister and Mrs. Brent looked at her
questioningly.
</p><p>“You look a little pale and tired, Miss Vanderpoel,” Mrs. Brent said,
rather as if in haste to be the first to speak. “I hope you are not at
all unwell. We need all our strength just now. I have brought the most
painful news. Malignant typhoid fever has broken out among the hop
pickers on the Mount Dunstan estate. Some poor creature was evidently
sickening for it when he came from London. Three people died last
night.”
