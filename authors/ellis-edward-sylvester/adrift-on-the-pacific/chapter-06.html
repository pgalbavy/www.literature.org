<p>When a thorough search of the steamer <em>Polynesia</em> made
known the truth that little Inez Hawthorne was nowhere upon it,
the sorrowful conclusion was that she had fallen overboard in
some manner and been drowned.</p>

<p>But the belief was scarcely formed, when the discovery was made
that such was not the case; that in fact she had been taken away
by the schooner <em>Coral</em>, whose mate performed such good
service in mending the broken shaft of the <em>Polynesia</em>.</p>

<p>The story as told Captain Strathmore was as follows:</p>

<p>The two officers of the schooner were rowed to the steamer by
one of the crew, who climbed up the ladder at the side of the
<em>Polynesia</em>, and spent a few minutes in inspecting the
broken shaft. He then came back. His attention was attracted to
little Inez, whose childish curiosity was excited by the appearance
of a stranger who had but one eye, and who looked so different
from the trim-looking members of the steamer's crew. The two fell
into conversation, and Inez asked so many questions about the
schooner that the stranger invited her to take a look at it. He
was heard to say that the captain and mate would be engaged for
two or three hours, and there would be plenty of time to row the
child over the intervening distance, explore the <em>Coral</em>,
and come back before Captain Bergen and his mate would be ready
to leave.</p>

<p>Naturally, Inez gladly accepted the invitation, and the sinister-looking
man, picking her up, carefully descended the ladder to his small
boat, and rowed away to the schooner.</p>

<p>This story, it will be observed, corresponded with that told
by Brazzier himself.</p>

<p>No one thought anything of the proceeding, which was one of the
most natural in the world, and there was nothing to arouse misgiving
on the part of those who witnessed it.</p>

<p>Inez was almost a spoiled child from the indulgence shown her
by every one with whom she came in contact. She distrusted no
one, because she had never had any reason to do so. It was night
when the officers of the schooner were rowed back, and those who
had seen Inez taken away did not observe that the boat returned
without her. Holding no thought of anything wrong, they gave no
further attention to the strange sailor.</p>

<p>The moment Captain Strathmore learned these facts, he caused
an abrupt change to be made in the course of the <em>Polynesia</em>.
For he was determined that no effort should be spared to recover
the lost child, who had so endeared herself to every one on board
the steamer.</p>

<p>The precise point where the accident had befallen the shaft was
recorded on the log, as a matter of course, and it was within
the power of the chief officer to return wonderfully close to
that spot. If the schooner <em>Coral</em> should remain anywhere
in that latitude and longitude, she could be found and Inez recovered.</p>

<p>"But it is not likely the schooner is near there," reflected
Captain Strathmore, as he swept the horizon with his glass and
failed to catch sight of a sail. "They could not have taken away
the child ignorantly, and instead of remaining there or attempting
to find us, the captain has headed in some direction which is
not the one he named, as if by accident, when he was aboard."</p>

<p>The captain was in that mood that it would have been dangerous
for him to come upon the daring thieves. He could conceive of
no explanation that would relieve them from his wrath, and as
the steamer described a huge curve in the sea and headed toward
the point where he hoped to gain sight of the sail, full steam
was put on, and she ran at a rate of speed which, in the condition
of her shaft, was certainly dangerous to a high degree.</p>

<p>It may be said there was not a heart on board the <em>Polynesia</em>
that did not share in the general anxiety, and there was scarcely
an eye that did not scan the broad ocean again and again in the
hope of catching sight of the schooner.</p>

<p>Several sails were descried in the course of the day, but not
one was that of the <em>Coral</em>, and when the night descended
not only had there been a complete failure, but the captain was
convinced that it was useless for him to delay the steamer by
hunting further.</p>

<p>With an angry and sad heart he gave over the search, and the
<em>Polynesia</em> was headed once more toward the far-off imperial
Japanese city of Tokio.</p>

<p>"I would give a thousand dollars to know what it all means,"
said Captain Strathmore, as he stood on the bridge debating the
matter with himself. "There is something about the whole business
which I don't understand. In the first place, Inez came under
my charge in an extraordinary way. I don't believe that that man
who brought her down to the wharf told the truth, and I very much
doubt whether the parents of the little one have ever been in
Japan. She may have been stolen from some one, and this means
has been resorted to in order to get her out of the way. I wish
I had questioned her more closely," continued the perplexed captain,
following up the train of thought, "for she let drop an expression
or two now and then that showed she had some remembrances which
it would have been interesting to call up. It's too late now,"
added the old sailor, with a sigh, "and probably I shall never
see her again. She had nestled down into that spot in my heart
which was left vacant many weary years ago, when my own Inez died
and my only boy became as one dead, and there is no sacrifice
I would not make would it but bring this one back to me. It is
curious, but the feeling is strong upon me that somewhere at some
time we shall meet again."</p>

<p>"Port your helm!"</p>

<p>This was the startling order which the quartermaster sent to
the wheel-house at that moment, and which was obeyed with as much
promptness as is possible on such a gigantic craft as an ocean
steamer.</p>

<p>The night, for a rarity, was dark and misty, a peculiar fog resting
upon the water, and shutting out the view in every direction.
It would seem that there could be little danger of a collision
on the broad bosom of the mightiest ocean of the globe, but there
must always be a certain ratio of danger, and none realized this
more than Captain Strathmore.</p>

<p>The <em>Polynesia</em> had been running at half speed ever since
the sun went down, and her whistle blew at irregular intervals.
At the moment the startling order was communicated to the man
at the wheel, the lights of another steamer were discerned directly
ahead. And these were scarcely observed when the mountainous hull
loomed up to view in appalling proximity, and a cold shudder ran
through every officer and sailor at the sight, for there was just
a single second or two when it seemed certain that the two crafts
would come together with an earthquake shock and such an irresistible
momentum as would crash the two prodigious hulls to splinters,
and send the crews and passengers to join the multitudes who have
gone before them to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>Signals and commands were rapidly exchanged, and the slight misunderstanding
which existed between the two steamers at first was quickly removed.
The shouts and orders, the tinkling of the engineer's bell, and
even the sound of hurrying feet, were heard on one ship as distinctly
as on the other.</p>

<p>Most fortunately the officers of each were sensible men, who
enforced discipline, and who, therefore, did not lose their heads
when sudden peril came upon them.</p>

<p>There was desperate need of haste on the part of all, but the
haste was intelligent, and something was accomplished.</p>

<p>The stranger instantly reversed her screw, while the <em>Polynesia</em>
was equally prompt in her backward movement. They escaped by a
chance so narrow that it was terrifying. The bow of the <em>Polynesia</em>
grazed the side of the stranger as they passed upon their diagonal
courses, and every one on the two ships who understood the dreadful
peril drew a deep breath and uttered a prayer of thankfulness
when it swept by, and the two steamers vanished from each other's
sight in the misty darkness.</p>

<p>The engineer of the <em>Polynesia</em> was signaled to go forward
again, and the screw was started; but, if the one who uttered
the order had forgotten the contingency against which they had
been warned, the one who executed that order had not, and he gave
the engine just enough steam to start the shaft.</p>

<p>As he did so, listening intently the meanwhile, he heard an ominous
crunching, grinding and jarring in the after hold, and he knew
too well what it meant. He instantly shut off steam, and with
the captain hastened to make the investigation. As they feared,
the broken shaft had been wrenched apart again, and it looked
as if it were injured beyond repair.</p>

<p>But what man has done, man can do, and the ingenious recourse
of Abe Storms was resorted to again. With great care the fractured
pieces were reunited and bound, but the task was, in reality,
harder than before, since the terrific grinding and wrenching
to which it had been subjected broke off much of the corrugated
surface.</p>

<p>The work was completed after many long hours of hard work, and
once more the <em>Polynesia</em> started slowly under steam for
the strange island-empire of Asia. This unexpected delay, as the
reader will see, doubtless had much to do with the failure of
the schooner to find the steamer, since it threw out all possibility
of calculating where the larger craft could be.</p>

<p>"Now, if we have no more vessels trying to run into us," muttered
the captain, as he resumed his place on the bridge, "we stand
a chance of reaching Japan after all, without calling on our sails
to help us."</p>

<p>But, standing at his post, with everything going well, his thoughts
naturally reverted to the strange mischance by which little Inez
Hawthorne was lost to him.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Captain Bergen or his mate, Abe Storms, would
knowingly take off the child in that fashion, though the girl
was enough to tempt any one to steal her. There is something about
the whole business which I don't understand. We ought to have
found each other, though, if he is still hunting for me. This
second breakage of the shaft will tend to keep us apart."</p>

<p>The long voyage of the steamer to Japan terminated without any
incident worth the recording, and Captain Strathmore naturally
became anxious to meet the parents of Inez, though sorrowing very
much over the story he would be forced to tell them. But no one
appeared at Tokio to claim the child, and the wondering captain
proceeded to make inquiries.</p>

<p>It was easy to obtain from the church authorities a list of the
names of the Christian missionaries in Japan, and they were scanned
carefully by the captain, who was given such assistance by the
officials themselves that there could be no mistake. Among them
was no one by the name of Hawthorne. It was plain then that deception
had been used when the man in San Francisco declared that the
parents of Inez were missionaries in Japan.</p>

<p>As day after day passed and the steamer <em>Polynesia</em> was
gradually prepared for her return voyage to California, there
was one strong, harrowing conviction which forced itself upon
the distressed captain:</p>

<p>"Had Inez not been stolen from the steamer, no one would have
come to claim her, and she would have been mine."</p>

<p>His heart thrilled at the thought of how close he had come to
obtaining such a priceless prize for his possession, and then
he added, as if to cheer himself:</p>

<p>"Never mind; the earth is far and wide. She is alive somewhere
upon its face, and at some time, at heaven's own pleasure, she
and I shall meet again."</p>

<p>Brave and rugged Captain Strathmore! Was the spirit of prophecy
upon you when you muttered the cheering words?</p>
