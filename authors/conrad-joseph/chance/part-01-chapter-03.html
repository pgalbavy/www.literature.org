<p>But there was nothing improper in my observing to Fyne that,
last night, Mrs. Fyne seemed to have some idea where that enterprising
young lady had gone to.  Fyne shook his head.  No; his wife had
been by no means so certain as she had pretended to be.  She merely
had her reasons to think, to hope, that the girl might have taken
a room somewhere in London, had buried herself in town&mdash;in readiness
or perhaps in horror of the approaching day&mdash;</p>

<p>He ceased and sat solemnly dejected, in a brown study.  "What
day?" I asked at last; but he did not hear me apparently.  He
diffused such portentous gloom into the atmosphere that I lost
patience with him.</p>

<p>"What on earth are you so dismal about?" I cried, being genuinely
surprised and puzzled.  "One would think the girl was a state
prisoner under your care."</p>

<p>And suddenly I became still more surprised at myself, at the
way I had somehow taken for granted things which did appear queer
when one thought them out.</p>

<p>"But why this secrecy?  Why did they elope&mdash;if it is an elopement? 
Was the girl afraid of your wife?  And your brother-in-law?  What
on earth possesses him to make a clandestine match of it?  Was
he afraid of your wife too?"</p>

<p>Fyne made an effort to rouse himself.</p>

<p>"Of course my brother-in-law, Captain Anthony, the son of . .
. "  He checked himself as if trying to break a bad habit.  "He
would be persuaded by her.  We have been most friendly to the
girl!"</p>

<p>"She struck me as a foolish and inconsiderate little person. 
But why should you and your wife take to heart so strongly mere
folly&mdash;or even a want of consideration?"</p>

<p>"It's the most unscrupulous action," declared Fyne weightily&mdash;and
sighed.</p>

<p>"I suppose she is poor," I observed after a short silence.  "But
after all . . . "</p>

<p>"You don't know who she is."  Fyne had regained his average solemnity.</p>

<p>I confessed that I had not caught her name when his wife had
introduced us to each other.  "It was something beginning with
an S- wasn't it?"  And then with the utmost coolness Fyne remarked
that it did not matter.  The name was not her name.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you made a young lady known to me under
a false name?" I asked, with the amused feeling that the days
of wonders and portents had not passed away yet.  That the eminently
serious Fynes should do such an exceptional thing was simply staggering. 
With a more hasty enunciation than usual little Fyne was sure
that I would not demand an apology for this irregularity if I
knew what her real name was.  A sort of warmth crept into his
deep tone.</p>

<p>"We have tried to befriend that girl in every way.  She is the
daughter and only child of de Barral."</p>

<p>Evidently he expected to produce a sensation; he kept his eyes
fixed upon me prepared for some sign of it.  But I merely returned
his intense, awaiting gaze.  For a time we stared at each other. 
Conscious of being reprehensibly dense I groped in the darkness
of my mind: De Barral, De Barral&mdash;and all at once noise and light
burst on me as if a window of my memory had been suddenly flung
open on a street in the City.  De Barral! But could it be the
same?  Surely not!</p>

<p>"The financier?" I suggested half incredulous.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fyne; and in this instance his native solemnity of
tone seemed to be strangely appropriate.  "The convict."</p>

<p>Marlow looked at me, significantly, and remarked in an explanatory
tone:</p>

<p>"One somehow never thought of de Barral as having any children,
or any other home than the offices of the "Orb"; or any other
existence, associations or interests than financial.  I see you
remember the crash . . . "</p>

<p>"I was away in the Indian Seas at the time," I said.  "But of
course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," Marlow struck in.  "All the world . . . You may
wonder at my slowness in recognizing the name.  But you know that
my memory is merely a mausoleum of proper names.  There they lie
inanimate, awaiting the magic touch&mdash;and not very prompt in arising
when called, either.  The name is the first thing I forget of
a man.  It is but just to add that frequently it is also the last,
and this accounts for my possession of a good many anonymous memories. 
In de Barral's case, he got put away in my mausoleum in company
with so many names of his own creation that really he had to throw
off a monstrous heap of grisly bones before he stood before me
at the call of the wizard Fyne.  The fellow had a pretty fancy
in names: the "Orb" Deposit Bank, the "Sceptre" Mutual Aid Society,
the "Thrift and Independence" Association.  Yes, a very pretty
taste in names; and nothing else besides&mdash;absolutely nothing&mdash;no
other merit.  Well yes.  He had another name, but that's pure
luck&mdash;his own name of de Barral which he did not invent.  I don't
think that a mere Jones or Brown could have fished out from the
depths of the Incredible such a colossal manifestation of human
folly as that man did.  But it may be that I am underestimating
the alacrity of human folly in rising to the bait.  No doubt I
am.  The greed of that absurd monster is incalculable, unfathomable,
inconceivable.  The career of de Barral demonstrates that it will
rise to a naked hook.  He didn't lure it with a fairy tale.  He
hadn't enough imagination for it . . . "</p>

<p>"Was he a foreigner?" I asked.  "It's clearly a French name. 
I suppose it <em>was</em> his name?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he didn't invent it.  He was born to it, in Bethnal Green,
as it came out during the proceedings.  He was in the habit of
alluding to his Scotch connections.  But every great man has done
that.  The mother, I believe, was Scotch, right enough.  The father
de Barral whatever his origins retired from the Customs Service
(tide-waiter I think), and started lending money in a very, very
small way in the East End to people connected with the docks,
stevedores, minor barge-owners, ship-chandlers, tally clerks,
all sorts of very small fry.  He made his living at it.  He was
a very decent man I believe.  He had enough influence to place
his only son as junior clerk in the account department of one
of the Dock Companies.  "Now, my boy," he said to him, "I've given
you a fine start." But de Barral didn't start.  He stuck.  He
gave perfect satisfaction.  At the end of three years he got a
small rise of salary and went out courting in the evenings.  He
went courting the daughter of an old seacaptain who was a churchwarden
of his parish and lived in an old badly preserved Georgian house
with a garden: one of these houses standing in a reduced bit of
"grounds" that you discover in a labyrinth of the most sordid
streets, exactly alike and composed of six-roomed hutches.</p>

<p>Some of them were the vicarages of slum parishes.  The old sailor
had got hold of one cheap, and de Barral got hold of his daughter&mdash;which
was a good bargain for him.  The old sailor was very good to the
young couple and very fond of their little girl.  Mrs. de Barral
was an equable, unassuming woman, at that time with a fund of
simple gaiety, and with no ambitions; but, woman-like, she longed
for change and for something interesting to happen now and then. 
It was she who encouraged de Barral to accept the offer of a post
in the west-end branch of a great bank.  It appears he shrank
from such a great adventure for a long time.  At last his wife's
arguments prevailed.  Later on she used to say: 'It's the only
time he ever listened to me; and I wonder now if it hadn't been
better for me to die before I ever made him go into that bank.'</p>

<p>You may be surprised at my knowledge of these details.  Well,
I had them ultimately from Mrs. Fyne.  Mrs. Fyne while yet Miss
Anthony, in her days of bondage, knew Mrs. de Barral in her days
of exile.  Mrs. de Barral was living then in a big stone mansion
with mullioned windows in a large damp park, called the Priory,
adjoining the village where the refined poet had built himself
a house.</p>

<p>These were the days of de Barral's success.  He had bought the
place without ever seeing it and had packed off his wife and child
at once there to take possession.  He did not know what to do
with them in London.  He himself had a suite of rooms in an hotel. 
He gave there dinner parties followed by cards in the evening. 
He had developed the gambling passion&mdash;or else a mere card mania&mdash;but
at any rate he played heavily, for relaxation, with a lot of dubious
hangers on.</p>

<p>Meantime Mrs. de Barral, expecting him every day, lived at the
Priory, with a carriage and pair, a governess for the child and
many servants. The village people would see her through the railings
wandering under the trees with her little girl lost in her strange
surroundings.  Nobody ever came near her.  And there she died
as some faithful and delicate animals die&mdash;from neglect, absolutely
from neglect, rather unexpectedly and without any fuss.  The village
was sorry for her because, though obviously worried about something,
she was good to the poor and was always ready for a chat with
any of the humble folks.  Of course they knew that she wasn't
a lady&mdash;not what you would call a real lady.  And even her acquaintance
with Miss Anthony was only a cottage-door, a village-street acquaintance. 
Carleon Anthony was a tremendous aristocrat (his father had been
a "restoring" architect) and his daughter was not allowed to associate
with anyone but the county young ladies. Nevertheless in defiance
of the poet's wrathful concern for undefiled refinement there
were some quiet, melancholy strolls to and fro in the great avenue
of chestnuts leading to the park-gate, during which Mrs. de Barral
came to call Miss Anthony 'my dear'&mdash;and even 'my poor dear.' 
The lonely soul had no one to talk to but that not very happy
girl.  The governess despised her.  The housekeeper was distant
in her manner. Moreover Mrs. de Barral was no foolish gossiping
woman.  But she made some confidences to Miss Anthony.  Such wealth
was a terrific thing to have thrust upon one she affirmed.  Once
she went so far as to confess that she was dying with anxiety. 
Mr. de Barral (so she referred to him) had been an excellent husband
and an exemplary father but "you see my dear I have had a great
experience of him.  I am sure he won't know what to do with all
that money people are giving to him to take care of for them. 
He's as likely as not to do something rash.  When he comes here
I must have a good long serious talk with him, like the talks
we often used to have together in the good old times of our life." 
And then one day a cry of anguish was wrung from her: 'My dear,
he will never come here, he will never, never come!'</p>

<p>She was wrong.  He came to the funeral, was extremely cut up,
and holding the child tightly by the hand wept bitterly at the
side of the grave. Miss Anthony, at the cost of a whole week of
sneers and abuse from the poet, saw it all with her own eyes. 
De Barral clung to the child like a drowning man.  He managed,
though, to catch the half-past five fast train, travelling to
town alone in a reserved compartment, with all the blinds down
. . . "</p>

<p>"Leaving the child?" I said interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Yes.  Leaving . . . He shirked the problem.  He was born that
way.  He had no idea what to do with her or for that matter with
anything or anybody including himself.  He bolted back to his
suite of rooms in the hotel.  He was the most helpless . . . She
might have been left in the Priory to the end of time had not
the high-toned governess threatened to send in her resignation. 
She didn't care for the child a bit, and the lonely, gloomy Priory
had got on her nerves.  She wasn't going to put up with such a
life and, having just come out of some ducal family, she bullied
de Barral in a very lofty fashion.  To pacify her he took a splendidly
furnished house in the most expensive part of Brighton for them,
and now and then ran down for a week-end, with a trunk full of
exquisite sweets and with his hat full of money.  The governess
spent it for him in extra ducal style.  She was nearly forty and
harboured a secret taste for patronizing young men of sorts&mdash;of
a certain sort.  But of that Mrs. Fyne of course had no personal
knowledge then; she told me however that even in the Priory days
she had suspected her of being an artificial, heartless, vulgar-minded
woman with the lowest possible ideals.  But de Barral did not
know it.  He literally did not know anything . . . "</p>

<p>"But tell me, Marlow," I interrupted, "how do you account for
this opinion?  He must have been a personality in a sense&mdash;in
some one sense surely.  You don't work the greatest material havoc
of a decade at least, in a commercial community, without having
something in you."</p>

<p>Marlow shook his head.</p>

<p>"He was a mere sign, a portent.  There was nothing in him.  Just
about that time the word Thrift was to the fore.  You know the
power of words. We pass through periods dominated by this or that
word&mdash;it may be development, or it may be competition, or education,
or purity or efficiency or even sanctity.  It is the word of the
time.  Well just then it was the word Thrift which was out in
the streets walking arm in arm with righteousness, the inseparable
companion and backer up of all such national catch-words, looking
everybody in the eye as it were.  The very drabs of the pavement,
poor things, didn't escape the fascination . . . However! . .
. Well the greatest portion of the press were screeching in all
possible tones, like a confounded company of parrots instructed
by some devil with a taste for practical jokes, that the financier
de Barral was helping the great moral evolution of our character
towards the newlydiscovered virtue of Thrift.  He was helping
it by all these great establishments of his, which made the moral
merits of Thrift manifest to the most callous hearts, simply by
promising to pay ten per cent. interest on all deposits.  And
you didn't want necessarily to belong to the well-to-do classes
in order to participate in the advantages of virtue.  If you had
but a spare sixpence in the world and went and gave it to de Barral
it was Thrift!  It's quite likely that he himself believed it. 
He must have.  It's inconceivable that he alone should stand out
against the infatuation of the whole world.  He hadn't enough
intelligence for that.  But to look at him one couldn't tell .
. . "</p>

<p>"You did see him then?" I said with some curiosity.</p>

<p>"I did.  Strange, isn't it?  It was only once, but as I sat with
the distressed Fyne who had suddenly resuscitated his name buried
in my memory with other dead labels of the past, I may say I saw
him again, I saw him with great vividness of recollection, as
he appeared in the days of his glory or splendour.  No!  Neither
of these words will fit his success.  There was never any glory
or splendour about that figure.  Well, let us say in the days
when he was, according to the majority of the daily press, a financial
force working for the improvement of the character of the people. 
I'll tell you how it came about.</p>

<p>At that time I used to know a podgy, wealthy, bald little man
having chambers in the Albany; a financier too, in his way, carrying
out transactions of an intimate nature and of no moral character;
mostly with young men of birth and expectations&mdash;though I dare
say he didn't withhold his ministrations from elderly plebeians
either.  He was a true democrat; he would have done business (a
sharp kind of business) with the devil himself.  Everything was
fly that came into his web.  He received the applicants in an
alert, jovial fashion which was quite surprising.  It gave relief
without giving too much confidence, which was just as well perhaps. 
His business was transacted in an apartment furnished like a drawing-room,
the walls hung with several brown, heavily-framed, oil paintings. 
I don't know if they were good, but they were big, and with their
elaborate, tarnished gilt-frames had a melancholy dignity.  The
man himself sat at a shining, inlaid writing table which looked
like a rare piece from a museum of art; his chair had a high,
oval, carved back, upholstered in faded tapestry; and these objects
made of the costly black Havana cigar, which he rolled incessantly
from the middle to the left corner of his mouth and back again,
an inexpressibly cheap and nasty object.  I had to see him several
times in the interest of a poor devil so unlucky that he didn't
even have a more competent friend than myself to speak for him
at a very difficult time in his life.</p>

<p>I don't know at what hour my private financier began his day,
but he used to give one appointments at unheard of times: such
as a quarter to eight in the morning, for instance.  On arriving
one found him busy at that marvellous writing table, looking very
fresh and alert, exhaling a faint fragrance of scented soap and
with the cigar already well alight.  You may believe that I entered
on my mission with many unpleasant forebodings; but there was
in that fat, admirably washed, little man such a profound contempt
for mankind that it amounted to a species of good nature; which,
unlike the milk of genuine kindness, was never in danger of turning
sour.  Then, once, during a pause in business, while we were waiting
for the production of a document for which he had sent (perhaps
to the cellar?) I happened to remark, glancing round the room,
that I had never seen so many fine things assembled together out
of a collection. Whether this was unconscious diplomacy on my
part, or not, I shouldn't like to say&mdash;but the remark was true
enough, and it pleased him extremely.  "It <em>is</em> a collection,"
he said emphatically.  "Only I live right in it, which most collectors
don't.  But I see that you know what you are looking at.  Not
many people who come here on business do.  Stable fittings are
more in their way."</p>

<p>I don't know whether my appreciation helped to advance my friend's
business but at any rate it helped our intercourse.  He treated
me with a shade of familiarity as one of the initiated.</p>

<p>The last time I called on him to conclude the transaction we
were interrupted by a person, something like a cross between a
bookmaker and a private secretary, who, entering through a door
which was not the anteroom door, walked up and stooped to whisper
into his ear.</p>

<p>"Eh?  What?  Who, did you say?"</p>

<p>The nondescript person stooped and whispered again, adding a
little louder: "Says he won't detain you a moment."</p>

<p>My little man glanced at me, said "Ah!  Well," irresolutely. 
I got up from my chair and offered to come again later.  He looked
whimsically alarmed.  "No, no.  It's bad enough to lose my money
but I don't want to waste any more of my time over your friend. 
We must be done with this today.  Just go and have a look at that
<em>garniture de cheminee</em> yonder. There's another, something
like it, in the castle of Laeken, but mine's much superior in
design."</p>

<p>I moved accordingly to the other side of that big room.  The
<em>garniture</em> was very fine.  But while pretending to examine
it I watched my man going forward to meet a tall visitor, who
said, "I thought you would be disengaged so early.  It's only
a word or two"&mdash;and after a whispered confabulation of no more
than a minute, reconduct him to the door and shake hands ceremoniously. 
"Not at all, not at all.  Very pleased to be of use.  You can
depend absolutely on my information"&mdash;"Oh thank you, thank you. 
I just looked in."  "Certainly, quite right.  Any time . . . Good
morning."</p>

<p>I had a good look at the visitor while they were exchanging these
civilities.  He was clad in black.  I remember perfectly that
he wore a flat, broad, black satin tie in which was stuck a large
cameo pin; and a small turn down collar.  His hair, discoloured
and silky, curled slightly over his ears.  His cheeks were hairless
and round, and apparently soft. He held himself very upright,
walked with small steps and spoke gently in an inward voice. 
Perhaps from contrast with the magnificent polish of the room
and the neatness of its owner, he struck me as dingy, indigent,
and, if not exactly humble, then much subdued by evil fortune.</p>

<p>I wondered greatly at my fat little financier's civility to that
dubious personage when he asked me, as we resumed our respective
seats, whether I knew who it was that had just gone out.  On my
shaking my head negatively he smiled queerly, said "De Barral,"
and enjoyed my surprise.  Then becoming grave: "That's a deep
fellow, if you like.  We all know where he started from and where
he got to; but nobody knows what he means to do." He became thoughtful
for a moment and added as if speaking to himself, "I wonder what
his game is."</p>

<p>And, you know, there was no game, no game of any sort, or shape
or kind. It came out plainly at the trial.  As I've told you before,
he was a clerk in a bank, like thousands of others.  He got that
berth as a second start in life and there he stuck again, giving
perfect satisfaction.  Then one day as though a supernatural voice
had whispered into his ear or some invisible fly had stung him,
he put on his hat, went out into the street and began advertising. 
That's absolutely all that there was to it.  He caught in the
street the word of the time and harnessed it to his preposterous
chariot.</p>

<p>One remembers his first modest advertisements headed with the
magic word Thrift, Thrift, Thrift, thrice repeated; promising
ten per cent. on all deposits and giving the address of the Thrift
and Independence Aid Association in Vauxhall Bridge Road.  Apparently
nothing more was necessary.  He didn't even explain what he meant
to do with the money he asked the public to pour into his lap. 
Of course he meant to lend it out at high rates of interest. 
He did so&mdash;but he did it without system, plan, foresight or judgment. 
And as he frittered away the sums that flowed in, he advertised
for more&mdash;and got it.  During a period of general business prosperity
he set up The Orb Bank and The Sceptre Trust, simply, it seems
for advertising purposes.  They were mere names.  He was totally
unable to organize anything, to promote any sort of enterprise
if it were only for the purpose of juggling with the shares. 
At that time he could have had for the asking any number of Dukes,
retired Generals, active <em>M.P.'</em>s, ex-ambassadors and so
on as Directors to sit at the wildest boards of his invention. 
But he never tried.  He had no real imagination.  All he could
do was to publish more advertisements and open more branch offices
of the Thrift and Independence, of The Orb, of The Sceptre, for
the receipt of deposits; first in this town, then in that town,
north and south&mdash;everywhere where he could find suitable premises
at a moderate rent.  For this was the great characteristic of
the management.  Modesty, moderation, simplicity.  Neither The
Orb nor The Sceptre nor yet their parent the Thrift and Independence
had built for themselves the usual palaces.  For this abstention
they were praised in silly public prints as illustrating in their
management the principle of Thrift for which they were founded. 
The fact is that de Barral simply didn't think of it.  Of course
he had soon moved from Vauxhall Bridge Road.  He knew enough for
that.  What he got hold of next was an old, enormous, rat-infested
brick house in a small street off the Strand. Strangers were taken
in front of the meanest possible, begrimed, yellowy, flat brick
wall, with two rows of unadorned window-holes one above the other,
and were exhorted with bated breath to behold and admire the simplicity
of the head-quarters of the great financial force of the day.
The word <em>THRIFT </em>perched right up on the roof in giant
gilt letters, and two enormous shield-like brass-plates curved
round the corners on each side of the doorway were the only shining
spots in de Barral's business outfit.  Nobody knew what operations
were carried on inside except this&mdash;that if you walked in and
tendered your money over the counter it would be calmly taken
from you by somebody who would give you a printed receipt.  That
and no more.  It appears that such knowledge is irresistible. 
People went in and tendered; and once it was taken from their
hands their money was more irretrievably gone from them than if
they had thrown it into the sea.  This then, and nothing else
was being carried on in there . . . "</p>

<p>"Come, Marlow," I said, "you exaggerate surely&mdash;if only by your
way of putting things.  It's too startling."</p>

<p>"I exaggerate!" he defended himself.  "My way of putting things! 
My dear fellow I have merely stripped the rags of business verbiage
and financial jargon off my statements.  And you are startled! 
I am giving you the naked truth.  It's true too that nothing lays
itself open to the charge of exaggeration more than the language
of naked truth.  What comes with a shock is admitted with difficulty. 
But what will you say to the end of his career?</p>

<p>It was of course sensational and tolerably sudden.  It began
with the Orb Deposit Bank.  Under the name of that institution
de Barral with the frantic obstinacy of an unimaginative man had
been financing an Indian prince who was prosecuting a claim for
immense sums of money against the government.  It was an enormous
number of scores of lakhs&mdash;a miserable remnant of his ancestors'
treasures&mdash;that sort of thing.  And it was all authentic enough. 
There was a real prince; and the claim too was sufficiently real&mdash;only
unfortunately it was not a valid claim.  So the prince lost his
case on the last appeal and the beginning of de Barral's end became
manifest to the public in the shape of a half-sheet of note paper
wafered by the four corners on the closed door of The Orb offices
notifying that payment was stopped at that establishment.</p>

<p>Its consort The Sceptre collapsed within the week.  I won't say
in American parlance that suddenly the bottom fell out of the
whole of de Barral concerns.  There never had been any bottom
to it.  It was like the cask of Danaides into which the public
had been pleased to pour its deposits.  That they were gone was
clear; and the bankruptcy proceedings which followed were like
a sinister farce, bursts of laughter in a setting of mute anguish&mdash;that
of the depositors; hundreds of thousands of them.  The laughter
was irresistible; the accompaniment of the bankrupt's public examination.</p>

<p>I don't know if it was from utter lack of all imagination or
from the possession in undue proportion of a particular kind of
it, or from both&mdash;and the three alternatives are possible&mdash;but
it was discovered that this man who had been raised to such a
height by the credulity of the public was himself more gullible
than any of his depositors.  He had been the prey of all sorts
of swindlers, adventurers, visionaries and even lunatics.  Wrapping
himself up in deep and imbecile secrecy he had gone in for the
most fantastic schemes: a harbour and docks on the coast of Patagonia,
quarries in Labrador&mdash;such like speculations.  Fisheries to feed
a canning Factory on the banks of the Amazon was one of them. 
A principality to be bought in Madagascar was another.  As the
grotesque details of these incredible transactions came out one
by one ripples of laughter ran over the closely packed court&mdash;each
one a little louder than the other.  The audience ended by fairly
roaring under the cumulative effect of absurdity.  The Registrar
laughed, the barristers laughed, the reporters laughed, the serried
ranks of the miserable depositors watching anxiously every word,
laughed like one man.  They laughed hysterically&mdash;the poor wretches&mdash;on
the verge of tears.</p>

<p>There was only one person who remained unmoved.  It was de Barral
himself.  He preserved his serene, gentle expression, I am told
(for I have not witnessed those scenes myself), and looked around
at the people with an air of placid sufficiency which was the
first hint to the world of the man's overweening, unmeasurable
conceit, hidden hitherto under a diffident manner.  It could be
seen too in his dogged assertion that if he had been given enough
time and a lot more money everything would have come right.  And
there were some people (yes, amongst his very victims) who more
than half believed him, even after the criminal prosecution which
soon followed.  When placed in the dock he lost his steadiness
as if some sustaining illusion had gone to pieces within him suddenly. 
He ceased to be himself in manner completely, and even in disposition,
in so far that his faded neutral eyes matching his discoloured
hair so well, were discovered then to be capable of expressing
a sort of underhand hate.  He was at first defiant, then insolent,
then broke down and burst into tears; but it might have been from
rage.  Then he calmed down, returned to his soft manner of speech
and to that unassuming quiet bearing which had been usual with
him even in his greatest days.  But it seemed as though in this
moment of change he had at last perceived what a power he had
been; for he remarked to one of the prosecuting counsel who had
assumed a lofty moral tone in questioning him, that&mdash;yes, he had
gambled&mdash;he liked cards.  But that only a year ago a host of smart
people would have been only too pleased to take a hand at cards
with him.  Yes&mdash;he went on&mdash;some of the very people who were there
accommodated with seats on the bench; and turning upon the counsel
"You yourself as well," he cried.  He could have had half the
town at his rooms to fawn upon him if he had cared for that sort
of thing.  "Why, now I think of it, it took me most of my time
to keep people, just of your sort, off me," he ended with a good
humoured&mdash;quite unobtrusive, contempt, as though the fact had
dawned upon him for the first time.</p>

<p>This was the moment, the only moment, when he had perhaps all
the audience in Court with him, in a hush of dreary silence. 
And then the dreary proceedings were resumed.  For all the outside
excitement it was the most dreary of all celebrated trials.  The
bankruptcy proceedings had exhausted all the laughter there was
in it.  Only the fact of wide-spread ruin remained, and the resentment
of a mass of people for having been fooled by means too simple
to save their self-respect from a deep wound which the cleverness
of a consummate scoundrel would not have inflicted. A shamefaced
amazement attended these proceedings in which de Barral was not
being exposed alone.  For himself his only cry was: Time! Time! 
Time would have set everything right.  In time some of these speculations
of his were certain to have succeeded.  He repeated this defence,
this excuse, this confession of faith, with wearisome iteration. 
Everything he had done or left undone had been to gain time. 
He had hypnotized himself with the word.  Sometimes, I am told,
his appearance was ecstatic, his motionless pale eyes seemed to
be gazing down the vista of future ages.  Time&mdash;and of course,
more money.  "Ah!  If only you had left me alone for a couple
of years more," he cried once in accents of passionate belief. 
"The money was coming in all right."  The deposits you understand&mdash;the
savings of Thrift.  Oh yes they had been coming in to the very
last moment.  And he regretted them.  He had arrived to regard
them as his own by a sort of mystical persuasion.  And yet it
was a perfectly true cry, when he turned once more on the counsel
who was beginning a question with the words "You have had all
these immense sums . . . " with the indignant retort "<em>What</em>
have I had out of them?"</p>

<p>"It was perfectly true.  He had had nothing out of them&mdash;nothing
of the prestigious or the desirable things of the earth, craved
for by predatory natures.  He had gratified no tastes, had known
no luxury; he had built no gorgeous palaces, had formed no splendid
galleries out of these "immense sums."  He had not even a home. 
He had gone into these rooms in an hotel and had stuck there for
years, giving no doubt perfect satisfaction to the management. 
They had twice raised his rent to show I suppose their high sense
of his distinguished patronage.  He had bought for himself out
of all the wealth streaming through his fingers neither adulation
nor love, neither splendour nor comfort.  There was something
perfect in his consistent mediocrity.  His very vanity seemed
to miss the gratification of even the mere show of power.  In
the days when he was most fully in the public eye the invincible
obscurity of his origins clung to him like a shadowy garment. 
He had handled millions without ever enjoying anything of what
is counted as precious in the community of men, because he had
neither the brutality of temperament nor the fineness of mind
to make him desire them with the will power of a masterful adventurer
. . . "</p>

<p>"You seem to have studied the man," I observed.</p>

<p>"Studied," repeated Marlow thoughtfully.  "No!  Not studied. 
I had no opportunities.  You know that I saw him only on that
one occasion I told you of.  But it may be that a glimpse and
no more is the proper way of seeing an individuality; and de Barral
was that, in virtue of his very deficiencies for they made of
him something quite unlike one's preconceived ideas.  There were
also very few materials accessible to a man like me to form a
judgment from.  But in such a case I verify believe that a little
is as good as a feast&mdash;perhaps better.  If one has a taste for
that kind of thing the merest starting-point becomes a coign of
vantage, and then by a series of logically deducted verisimilitudes
one arrives at truth&mdash;or very near the truth&mdash;as near as any circumstantial
evidence can do.  I have not studied de Barral but that is how
I understand him so far as he could be understood through the
din of the crash; the wailing and gnashing of teeth, the newspaper
contents bills, "The Thrift Frauds.  Cross-examination of the
accused.  Extra special"&mdash;blazing fiercely; the charitable appeals
for the victims, the grave tones of the dailies rumbling with
compassion as if they were the national bowels.  All this lasted
a whole week of industrious sittings.  A pressman whom I knew
told me "He's an idiot."  Which was possible.  Before that I overheard
once somebody declaring that he had a criminal type of face; which
I knew was untrue.  The sentence was pronounced by artificial
light in a stifling poisonous atmosphere.  Something edifying
was said by the judge weightily, about the retribution overtaking
the perpetrator of "the most heartless frauds on an unprecedented
scale."  I don't understand these things much, but it appears
that he had juggled with accounts, cooked balance sheets, had
gathered in deposits months after he ought to have known himself
to be hopelessly insolvent, and done enough of other things, highly
reprehensible in the eyes of the law, to earn for himself seven
years' penal servitude.  The sentence making its way outside met
with a good reception.  A small mob composed mainly of people
who themselves did not look particularly clever and scrupulous,
leavened by a slight sprinkling of genuine pickpockets amused
itself by cheering in the most penetrating, abominable cold drizzle
that I remember.  I happened to be passing there on my way from
the East End where I had spent my day about the Docks with an
old chum who was looking after the fitting out of a new ship. 
I am always eager, when allowed, to call on a new ship.  They
interest me like charming young persons.</p>

<p>I got mixed up in that crowd seething with an animosity as senseless
as things of the street always are, and it was while I was laboriously
making my way out of it that the pressman of whom I spoke was
jostled against me.  He did me the justice to be surprised.  "What? 
You here! The last person in the world . . . If I had known I
could have got you inside.  Plenty of room.  Interest been over
for the last three days.  Got seven years.  Well, I am glad."</p>

<p>"Why are you glad?  Because he's got seven years?" I asked, greatly
incommoded by the pressure of a hulking fellow who was remarking
to some of his equally oppressive friends that the "beggar ought
to have been poleaxed."  I don't know whether he had ever confided
his savings to de Barral but if so, judging from his appearance,
they must have been the proceeds of some successful burglary. 
The pressman by my side said 'No,' to my question.  He was glad
because it was all over.  He had suffered greatly from the heat
and the bad air of the court.  The clammy, raw, chill of the streets
seemed to affect his liver instantly.  He became contemptuous
and irritable and plied his elbows viciously making way for himself
and me.</p>

<p>A dull affair this.  All such cases were dull.  No really dramatic
moments.  The book-keeping of The Orb and all the rest of them
was certainly a burlesque revelation but the public did not care
for revelations of that kind.  Dull dog that de Barral&mdash;he grumbled. 
He could not or would not take the trouble to characterize for
me the appearance of that man now officially a criminal (we had
gone across the road for a drink) but told me with a sourly, derisive
snigger that, after the sentence had been pronounced the fellow
clung to the dock long enough to make a sort of protest.  'You
haven't given me time.  If I had been given time I would have
ended by being made a peer like some of them.' And he had permitted
himself his very first and last gesture in all these days, raising
a hard-clenched fist above his head.</p>

<p>The pressman disapproved of that manifestation.  It was not his
business to understand it.  Is it ever the business of any pressman
to understand anything?  I guess not.  It would lead him too far
away from the actualities which are the daily bread of the public
mind.  He probably thought the display worth very little from
a picturesque point of view; the weak voice; the colourless personality
as incapable of an attitude as a bed-post, the very fatuity of
the clenched hand so ineffectual at that time and place&mdash;no, it
wasn't worth much.  And then, for him, an accomplished craftsman
in his trade, thinking was distinctly "bad business."  His business
was to write a readable account.  But I who had nothing to write,
I permitted myself to use my mind as we sat before our still untouched
glasses.  And the disclosure which so often rewards a moment of
detachment from mere visual impressions gave me a thrill very
much approaching a shudder.  I seemed to understand that, with
the shock of the agonies and perplexities of his trial, the imagination
of that man, whose moods, notions and motives wore frequently
an air of grotesque mystery&mdash;that his imagination had been at
last roused into activity.  And this was awful.  Just try to enter
into the feelings of a man whose imagination wakes up at the very
moment he is about to enter the tomb . . . "</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>"You must not think," went on Marlow after a pause, "that on
that morning with Fyne I went consciously in my mind over all
this, let us call it information; no, better say, this fund of
knowledge which I had, or rather which existed, in me in regard
to de Barral.  Information is something one goes out to seek and
puts away when found as you might do a piece of lead: ponderous,
useful, unvibrating, dull.  Whereas knowledge comes to one, this
sort of knowledge, a chance acquisition preserving in its repose
a fine resonant quality . . . But as such distinctions touch upon
the transcendental I shall spare you the pain of listening to
them. There are limits to my cruelty.  No!  I didn't reckon up
carefully in my mind all this I have been telling you.  How could
I have done so, with Fyne right there in the room?  He sat perfectly
still, statuesque in homely fashion, after having delivered himself
of his effective assent: "Yes.  The convict," and I, far from
indulging in a reminiscent excursion into the past, remained sufficiently
in the present to muse in a vague, absent-minded way on the respectable
proportions and on the (upon the whole) comely shape of his great
pedestrian's calves, for he had thrown one leg over his knee,
carelessly, to conceal the trouble of his mind by an air of ease. 
But all the same the knowledge was in me, the awakened resonance
of which I spoke just now; I was aware of it on that beautiful
day, so fresh, so warm and friendly, so accomplished&mdash;an exquisite
courtesy of the much abused English climate when it makes up its
meteorological mind to behave like a perfect gentleman.  Of course
the English climate is never a rough.  It suffers from spleen
somewhat frequently&mdash;but that is gentlemanly too, and I don't
mind going to meet him in that mood.  He has his days of grey,
veiled, polite melancholy, in which he is very fascinating.  How
seldom he lapses into a blustering manner, after all!  And then
it is mostly in a season when, appropriately enough, one may go
out and kill something.  But his fine days are the best for stopping
at home, to read, to think, to muse&mdash;even to dream; in fact to
live fully, intensely and quietly, in the brightness of comprehension,
in that receptive glow of the mind, the gift of the clear, luminous
and serene weather.</p>

<p>That day I had intended to live intensely and quietly, basking
in the weather's glory which would have lent enchantment to the
most unpromising of intellectual prospects.  For a companion I
had found a book, not bemused with the cleverness of the day&mdash;a
fine-weather book, simple and sincere like the talk of an unselfish
friend.  But looking at little Fyne seated in the room I understood
that nothing would come of my contemplative aspirations; that
in one way or another I should be let in for some form of severe
exercise.  Walking, it would be, I feared, since, for me, that
idea was inseparably associated with the visual impression of
Fyne.  Where, why, how, a rapid striding rush could be brought
in helpful relation to the good Fyne's present trouble and perplexity
I could not imagine; except on the principle that senseless pedestrianism
was Fyne's panacea for all the ills and evils bodily and spiritual
of the universe.  It could be of no use for me to say or do anything. 
It was bound to come.  Contemplating his muscular limb encased
in a golf-stocking, and under the strong impression of the information
he had just imparted I said wondering, rather irrationally:</p>

<p>"And so de Barral had a wife and child!  That girl's his daughter. 
And how . . . "</p>

<p>Fyne interrupted me by stating again earnestly, as though it
were something not easy to believe, that his wife and himself
had tried to befriend the girl in every way&mdash;indeed they had! 
I did not doubt him for a moment, of course, but my wonder at
this was more rational.  At that hour of the morning, you mustn't
forget, I knew nothing as yet of Mrs. Fyne's contact (it was hardly
more) with de Barral's wife and child during their exile at the
Priory, in the culminating days of that man's fame.</p>

<p>Fyne who had come over, it was clear, solely to talk to me on
that subject, gave me the first hint of this initial, merely out
of doors, connection.  "The girl was quite a child then," he continued. 
"Later on she was removed out of Mrs. Fyne's reach in charge of
a governess&mdash;a very unsatisfactory person," he explained.  His
wife had then&mdash;h'm&mdash;met him; and on her marriage she lost sight
of the child completely.  But after the birth of Polly (Polly
was the third Fyne girl) she did not get on very well, and went
to Brighton for some months to recover her strength&mdash;and there,
one day in the street, the child (she wore her hair down her back
still) recognized her outside a shop and rushed, actually rushed,
into Mrs. Fyne's arms.  Rather touching this.  And so, disregarding
the cold impertinence of that . . . h'm . . . governess, his wife
naturally responded.</p>

<p>He was solemnly fragmentary.  I broke in with the observation
that it must have been before the crash.</p>

<p>Fyne nodded with deepened gravity, stating in his bass tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just before," and indulged himself with a weighty period of
solemn silence.</p>

<p>De Barral, he resumed suddenly, was not coming to Brighton for
week-ends regularly, then.  Must have been conscious already of
the approaching disaster.  Mrs. Fyne avoided being drawn into
making his acquaintance, and this suited the views of the governess
person, very jealous of any outside influence.  But in any case
it would not have been an easy matter.  Extraordinary, stiff-backed,
thin figure all in black, the observed of all, while walking hand-in-hand
with the girl; apparently shy, but&mdash;and here Fyne came very near
showing something like insight&mdash;probably nursing under a diffident
manner a considerable amount of secret arrogance.  Mrs. Fyne pitied
Flora de Barral's fate long before the catastrophe.  Most unfortunate
guidance.  Very unsatisfactory surroundings.  The girl was known
in the streets, was stared at in public places as if she had been
a sort of princess, but she was kept with a very ominous consistency,
from making any acquaintances&mdash;though of course there were many
people no doubt who would have been more than willing to&mdash;h'm&mdash;make
themselves agreeable to Miss de Barral.  But this did not enter
into the plans of the governess, an intriguing person hatching
a most sinister plot under her severe air of distant, fashionable
exclusiveness.  Good little Fyne's eyes bulged with solemn horror
as he revealed to me, in agitated speech, his wife's more than
suspicions, at the time, of that, Mrs., Mrs. What's her name's
perfidious conduct.  She actually seemed to have &mdash;Mrs. Fyne
asserted&mdash;formed a plot already to marry eventually her charge
to an impecunious relation of her own&mdash;a young man with furtive
eyes and something impudent in his manner, whom that woman called
her nephew, and whom she was always having down to stay with her.</p>

<p>"And perhaps not her nephew.  No relation at all" &mdash;Fyne
emitted with a convulsive effort this, the most awful part of
the suspicions Mrs. Fyne used to impart to him piecemeal when
he came down to spend his week-ends gravely with her and the children. 
The Fynes, in their good-natured concern for the unlucky child
of the man busied in stirring casually so many millions, spent
the moments of their weekly reunion in wondering earnestly what
could be done to defeat the most wicked of conspiracies, trying
to invent some tactful line of conduct in such extraordinary circumstances. 
I could see them, simple, and scrupulous, worrying honestly about
that unprotected big girl while looking at their own little girls
playing on the sea-shore.  Fyne assured me that his wife's rest
was disturbed by the great problem of interference.</p>

<p>"It was very acute of Mrs. Fyne to spot such a deep game," I
said, wondering to myself where her acuteness had gone to now,
to let her be taken unawares by a game so much simpler and played
to the end under her very nose.  But then, at that time, when
her nightly rest was disturbed by the dread of the fate preparing
for de Barral's unprotected child, she was not engaged in writing
a compendious and ruthless hand-book on the theory and practice
of life, for the use of women with a grievance.  She could as
yet, before the task of evolving the philosophy of rebellious
action had affected her intuitive sharpness, perceive things which
were, I suspect, moderately plain.  For I am inclined to believe
that the woman whom chance had put in command of Flora de Barral's
destiny took no very subtle pains to conceal her game.  She was
conscious of being a complete master of the situation, having
once for all established her ascendancy over de Barral.  She had
taken all her measures against outside observation of her conduct;
and I could not help smiling at the thought what a ghastly nuisance
the serious, innocent Fynes must have been to her.  How exasperated
she must have been by that couple falling into Brighton as completely
unforeseen as a bolt from the blue&mdash;if not so prompt.  How she
must have hated them!</p>

<p>But I conclude she would have carried out whatever plan she might
have formed.  I can imagine de Barral accustomed for years to
defer to her wishes and, either through arrogance, or shyness,
or simply because of his unimaginative stupidity, remaining outside
the social pale, knowing no one but some card-playing cronies;
I can picture him to myself terrified at the prospect of having
the care of a marriageable girl thrust on his hands, forcing on
him a complete change of habits and the necessity of another kind
of existence which he would not even have known how to begin. 
It is evident to me that Mrs. What's her name would have had her
atrocious way with very little trouble even if the excellent Fynes
had been able to do something.  She would simply have bullied
de Barral in a lofty style.  There's nothing more subservient
than an arrogant man when his arrogance has once been broken in
some particular instance.</p>

<p>However there was no time and no necessity for any one to do
anything. The situation itself vanished in the financial crash
as a building vanishes in an earthquake&mdash;here one moment and gone
the next with only an ill-omened, slight, preliminary rumble. 
Well, to say 'in a moment' is an exaggeration perhaps; but that
everything was over in just twenty-four hours is an exact statement. 
Fyne was able to tell me all about it; and the phrase that would
depict the nature of the change best is: an instant and complete
destitution.  I don't understand these matters very well, but
from Fyne's narrative it seemed as if the creditors or the depositors,
or the competent authorities, had got hold in the twinkling of
an eye of everything de Barral possessed in the world, down to
his watch and chain, the money in his trousers' pocket, his spare
suits of clothes, and I suppose the cameo pin out of his black
satin cravat. Everything!  I believe he gave up the very wedding
ring of his late wife. The gloomy Priory with its damp park and
a couple of farms had been made over to Mrs. de Barral; but when
she died (without making a will) it reverted to him, I imagine. 
They got that of course; but it was a mere crumb in a Sahara of
starvation, a drop in the thirsty ocean.  I dare say that not
a single soul in the world got the comfort of as much as a recovered
threepenny bit out of the estate.  Then, less than crumbs, less
than drops, there were to be grabbed, the lease of the big Brighton
house, the furniture therein, the carriage and pair, the girl's
riding horse, her costly trinkets; down to the heavily gold-mounted
collar of her pedigree St. Bernard.  The dog too went: the most
noble-looking item in the beggarly assets.</p>

<p>What however went first of all or rather vanished was nothing
in the nature of an asset.  It was that plotting governess with
the trick of a "perfect lady" manner (severely conventional) and
the soul of a remorseless brigand.  When a woman takes to any
sort of unlawful man-trade, there's nothing to beat her in the
way of thoroughness.  It's true that you will find people who'll
tell you that this terrific virulence in breaking through all
established things, is altogether the fault of men.  Such people
will ask you with a clever air why the servile wars were always
the most fierce, desperate and atrocious of all wars. And you
may make such answer as you can&mdash;even the eminently feminine one,
if you choose, so typical of the women's literal mind "I don't
see what this has to do with it!"  How many arguments have been
knocked over (I won't say knocked down) by these few words!  For
if we men try to put the spaciousness of all experiences into
our reasoning and would fain put the Infinite itself into our
love, it isn't, as some writer has remarked, "It isn't women's
doing."  Oh no.  They don't care for these things.  That sort
of aspiration is not much in their way; and it shall be a funny
world, the world of their arranging, where the Irrelevant would
fantastically step in to take the place of the sober humdrum Imaginative
. . . "</p>

<p>I raised my hand to stop my friend Marlow.</p>

<p>"Do you really believe what you have said?" I asked, meaning
no offence, because with Marlow one never could be sure.</p>

<p>"Only on certain days of the year," said Marlow readily with
a malicious smile.  "To-day I have been simply trying to be spacious
and I perceive I've managed to hurt your susceptibilities which
are consecrated to women.  When you sit alone and silent you are
defending in your mind the poor women from attacks which cannot
possibly touch them.  I wonder what can touch them?  But to soothe
your uneasiness I will point out again that an Irrelevant world
would be very amusing, if the women take care to make it as charming
as they alone can, by preserving for us certain wellknown, well-established,
I'll almost say hackneyed, illusions, without which the average
male creature cannot get on.  And that condition is very important. 
For there is nothing more provoking than the Irrelevant when it
has ceased to amuse and charm; and then the danger would be of
the subjugated masculinity in its exasperation, making some brusque,
unguarded movement and accidentally putting its elbow through
the fine tissue of the world of which I speak.  And that would
be fatal to it.  For nothing looks more irretrievably deplorable
than fine tissue which has been damaged.  The women themselves
would be the first to become disgusted with their own creation.</p>

<p>There was something of women's highly practical sanity and also
of their irrelevancy in the conduct of Miss de Barral's amazing
governess.  It appeared from Fyne's narrative that the day before
the first rumble of the cataclysm the questionable young man arrived
unexpectedly in Brighton to stay with his "Aunt."  To all outward
appearance everything was going on normally; the fellow went out
riding with the girl in the afternoon as he often used to do&mdash;a
sight which never failed to fill Mrs. Fyne with indignation. 
Fyne himself was down there with his family for a whole week and
was called to the window to behold the iniquity in its progress
and to share in his wife's feelings.  There was not even a groom
with them.  And Mrs. Fyne's distress was so strong at this glimpse
of the unlucky girl all unconscious of her danger riding smilingly
by, that Fyne began to consider seriously whether it wasn't their
plain duty to interfere at all risks&mdash;simply by writing a letter
to de Barral.  He said to his wife with a solemnity I can easily
imagine "You ought to undertake that task, my dear.  You have
known his wife after all.  That's something at any rate."   On
the other hand the fear of exposing Mrs. Fyne to some nasty rebuff
worried him exceedingly.  Mrs. Fyne on her side gave way to despondency. 
Success seemed impossible.  Here was a woman for more than five
years in charge of the girl and apparently enjoying the complete
confidence of the father.  What, that would be effective, could
one say, without proofs, without . . .  This Mr. de Barral must
be, Mrs. Fyne pronounced, either a very stupid or a downright
bad man, to neglect his child so.</p>

<p>You will notice that perhaps because of Fyne's solemn view of
our transient life and Mrs. Fyne's natural capacity for responsibility,
it had never occurred to them that the simplest way out of the
difficulty was to do nothing and dismiss the matter as no concern
of theirs.  Which in a strict worldly sense it certainly was not. 
But they spent, Fyne told me, a most disturbed afternoon, considering
the ways and means of dealing with the danger hanging over the
head of the girl out for a ride (and no doubt enjoying herself)
with an abominable scamp.</p>
