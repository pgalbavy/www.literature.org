<p>Up on the high veld our rivers are apt to be strings of pools
linked by muddy trickles—the most stagnant kind of watercourse
you would look for in a day’s journey. But presently they reach
the edge of the plateau and are tossed down into the flats in
noble ravines, and roll thereafter in full and sounding currents
to the sea. So with the story I am telling. It began in smooth
reaches, as idle as a mill-pond; yet the day soon came when I
was in the grip of a torrent, flung breathless from rock to rock
by a destiny which I could not control. But for the present I
was in a backwater, no less than the Garden City of Biggleswick,
where Mr Cornelius Brand, a South African gentleman visiting England
on holiday, lodged in a pair of rooms in the cottage of Mr Tancred
Jimson.</p>

<p>The house—or "home" as they preferred to name it at Biggleswick—was
one of some two hundred others which ringed a pleasant Midland
common. It was badly built and oddly furnished; the bed was too
short, the windows did not fit, the doors did not stay shut; but
it was as clean as soap and water and scrubbing could make it.
The three-quarters of an acre of garden were mainly devoted to
the culture of potatoes, though under the parlour window Mrs Jimson
had a plot of sweet-smelling herbs, and lines of lank sunflowers
fringed the path that led to the front door. It was Mrs Jimson
who received me as I descended from the station fly—a large red
woman with hair bleached by constant exposure to weather, clad
in a gown which, both in shape and material, seemed to have been
modelled on a chintz curtain. She was a good kindly soul, and
as proud as Punch of her house.</p>

<p>"We follow the simple life here, Mr Brand," she said. "You must
take us as you find us."</p>

<p>I assured her that I asked for nothing better, and as I unpacked
in my fresh little bedroom with a west wind blowing in at the
window I considered that I had seen worse quarters.</p>

<p>I had bought in London a considerable number of books, for I
thought that, as I would have time on my hands, I might as well
do something about my education. They were mostly English classics,
whose names I knew but which I had never read, and they were all
in a little flat-backed series at a shilling apiece. I arranged
them on top of a chest of drawers, but I kept the <em>Pilgrim’s
Progress</em> beside my bed, for that was one of my working tools
and I had to get it by heart.</p>

<p>Mrs Jimson, who came in while I was unpacking to see if the room
was to my liking, approved my taste. At our midday dinner she
wanted to discuss books with me, and was so full of her own knowledge
that I was able to conceal my ignorance.</p>

<p>"We are all labouring to express our personalities," she informed
me. "Have you found your medium, Mr Brand? is it to be the pen
or the pencil? Or perhaps it is music? You have the brow of an
artist, the frontal ‘bar of Michelangelo’, you remember!"</p>

<p>I told her that I concluded I would try literature, but before
writing anything I would read a bit more.</p>

<p>It was a Saturday, so Jimson came back from town in the early
afternoon. He was a managing clerk in some shipping office, but
you wouldn’t have guessed it from his appearance. His city clothes
were loose dark-grey flannels, a soft collar, an orange tie, and
a soft black hat. His wife went down the road to meet him, and
they returned hand-in-hand, swinging their arms like a couple
of schoolchildren. He had a skimpy red beard streaked with grey,
and mild blue eyes behind strong glasses. He was the most friendly
creature in the world, full of rapid questions, and eager to make
me feel one of the family. Presently he got into a tweed Norfolk
jacket, and started to cultivate his garden. I took off my coat
and lent him a hand, and when he stopped to rest from his labours—which
was every five minutes, for he had no kind of physique—he would
mop his brow and rub his spectacles and declaim about the good
smell of the earth and the joy of getting close to Nature.</p>

<p>Once he looked at my big brown hands and muscular arms with a
kind of wistfulness. "You are one of the <em>doers</em>, Mr Brand,"
he said, "and I could find it in my heart to envy you. You have
seen Nature in wild forms in far countries. Some day I hope you
will tell us about your life. I must be content with my little
corner, but happily there are no territorial limits for the mind.
This modest dwelling is a watch-tower from which I look over all
the world."</p>

<p>After that he took me for a walk. We met parties of returning
tennis-players and here and there a golfer. There seemed to be
an abundance of young men, mostly rather weedy-looking, but with
one or two well-grown ones who should have been fighting. The
names of some of them Jimson mentioned with awe. An unwholesome
youth was Aronson, the great novelist; a sturdy, bristling fellow
with a fierce moustache was Letchford, the celebrated leader-writer
of the <em>Critic</em>. Several were pointed out to me as artists
who had gone one better than anybody else, and a vast billowy
creature was described as the leader of the new Orientalism in
England. I noticed that these people, according to Jimson, were
all "great", and that they all dabbled in something "new". There
were quantities of young women, too, most of them rather badly
dressed and inclining to untidy hair. And there were several decent
couples taking the air like house-holders of an evening all the
world over. Most of these last were Jimson’s friends, to whom
he introduced me. They were his own class—modest folk, who sought
for a coloured background to their prosaic city lives and found
it in this odd settlement.</p>

<p>At supper I was initiated into the peculiar merits of Biggleswick.</p>

<p>"It is one great laboratory of thought," said Mrs Jimson. "It
is glorious to feel that you are living among the eager, vital
people who are at the head of all the newest movements, and that
the intellectual history of England is being made in our studies
and gardens. The war to us seems a remote and secondary affair.
As someone has said, the great fights of the world are all fought
in the mind."</p>

<p>A spasm of pain crossed her husband’s face. "I wish I could feel
it far away. After all, Ursula, it is the sacrifice of the young
that gives people like us leisure and peace to think. Our duty
is to do the best which is permitted to us, but that duty is a
poor thing compared with what our young soldiers are giving! I
may be quite wrong about the war.... I know I can’t argue with
Letchford. But I will not pretend to a superiority I do not feel."</p>

<p>I went to bed feeling that in Jimson I had struck a pretty sound
fellow. As I lit the candles on my dressing-table I observed that
the stack of silver which I had taken out of my pockets when I
washed before supper was top-heavy. It had two big coins at the
top and sixpences and shillings beneath. Now it is one of my oddities
that ever since I was a small boy I have arranged my loose coins
symmetrically, with the smallest uppermost. That made me observant
and led me to notice a second point. The English classics on the
top of the chest of drawers were not in the order I had left them.
Izaak Walton had got to the left of Sir Thomas Browne, and the
poet Burns was wedged disconsolately between two volumes of Hazlitt.
Moreover a receipted bill which I had stuck in the <em>Pilgrim’s
Progress</em> to mark my place had been moved. Someone had been
going through my belongings.</p>

<p>A moment’s reflection convinced me that it couldn’t have been
Mrs Jimson. She had no servant and did the housework herself,
but my things had been untouched when I left the room before supper,
for she had come to tidy up before I had gone downstairs. Someone
had been here while we were at supper, and had examined elaborately
everything I possessed. Happily I had little luggage, and no papers
save the new books and a bill or two in the name of Cornelius
Brand. The inquisitor, whoever he was, had found nothing.... The
incident gave me a good deal of comfort. It had been hard to believe
that any mystery could exist in this public place, where people
lived brazenly in the open, and wore their hearts on their sleeves
and proclaimed their opinions from the rooftops. Yet mystery there
must be, or an inoffensive stranger with a kit-bag would not have
received these strange attentions. I made a practice after that
of sleeping with my watch below my pillow, for inside the case
was Mary Lamington’s label.</p>

<p>Now began a period of pleasant idle receptiveness. Once a week
it was my custom to go up to London for the day to receive letters
and instructions, if any should come. I had moved from my chambers
in Park Lane, which I leased under my proper name, to a small
flat in Westminster taken in the name of Cornelius Brand. The
letters addressed to Park Lane were forwarded to Sir Walter, who
sent them round under cover to my new address. For the rest I
used to spend my mornings reading in the garden, and I discovered
for the first time what a pleasure was to be got from old books.
They recalled and amplified that vision I had seen from the Cotswold
ridge, the revelation of the priceless heritage which is England.
I imbibed a mighty quantity of history, but especially I liked
the writers, like Walton, who got at the very heart of the English
countryside. Soon, too, I found the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>
not a duty but a delight. I discovered new jewels daily in the
honest old story, and my letters to Peter began to be as full
of it as Peter’s own epistles. I loved, also, the songs of the
Elizabethans, for they reminded me of the girl who had sung to
me in the June night.</p>

<p>In the afternoons I took my exercise in long tramps along the
good dusty English roads. The country fell away from Biggleswick
into a plain of wood and pasture-land, with low hills on the horizon.
The place was sown with villages, each with its green and pond
and ancient church. Most, too, had inns, and there I had many
a draught of cool nutty ale, for the inn at Biggleswick was a
reformed place which sold nothing but washy cider. Often, tramping
home in the dusk, I was so much in love with the land that I could
have sung with the pure joy of it. And in the evening, after a
bath, there would be supper, when a rather fagged Jimson struggled
between sleep and hunger, and the lady, with an artistic mutch
on her untidy head, talked ruthlessly of culture.</p>

<p>Bit by bit I edged my way into local society. The Jimsons were
a great help, for they were popular and had a nodding acquaintance
with most of the inhabitants. They regarded me as a meritorious
aspirant towards a higher life, and I was paraded before their
friends with the suggestion of a vivid, if Philistine, past. If
I had any gift for writing, I would make a book about the inhabitants
of Biggleswick. About half were respectable citizens who came
there for country air and low rates, but even these had a touch
of queerness and had picked up the jargon of the place. The younger
men were mostly Government clerks or writers or artists. There
were a few widows with flocks of daughters, and on the outskirts
were several bigger houses—mostly houses which had been there
before the garden city was planted. One of them was brand-new,
a staring villa with sham-antique timbering, stuck on the top
of a hill among raw gardens. It belonged to a man called Moxon
Ivery, who was a kind of academic pacificist and a great god in
the place. Another, a quiet Georgian manor house, was owned by
a London publisher, an ardent Liberal whose particular branch
of business compelled him to keep in touch with the new movements.
I used to see him hurrying to the station swinging a little black
bag and returning at night with the fish for dinner.</p>

<p>I soon got to know a surprising lot of people, and they were
the rummiest birds you can imagine. For example, there were the
Weekeses, three girls who lived with their mother in a house so
artistic that you broke your head whichever way you turned in
it. The son of the family was a conscientious objector who had
refused to do any sort of work whatever, and had got quodded for
his pains. They were immensely proud of him and used to relate
his sufferings in Dartmoor with a gusto which I thought rather
heartless. Art was their great subject, and I am afraid they found
me pretty heavy going. It was their fashion never to admire anything
that was obviously beautiful, like a sunset or a pretty woman,
but to find surprising loveliness in things which I thought hideous.
Also they talked a language that was beyond me. This kind of conversation
used to happen.—<em>MISS WEEKES: "</em>Don’t you admire Ursula
Jimson?" <em>SELF: "</em>Rather!" <em>MISS W.: "</em>She is so
John-esque in her lines." <em>SELF: "</em>Exactly!" <em>MISS W.:
"</em>And Tancred, too—he is so full of <em>nuances</em>." <em>SELF:
"</em>Rather!" <em>MISS W.: "</em>He suggests one of Dégousse’s
countrymen." <em>SELF: "</em>Exactly!"</p>

<p>They hadn’t much use for books, except some Russian ones, and
I acquired merit in their eyes for having read <em>Leprous Souls</em>.
If you talked to them about that divine countryside, you found
they didn’t give a rap for it and had never been a mile beyond
the village. But they admired greatly the sombre effect of a train
going into Marylebone station on a rainy day.</p>

<p>But it was the men who interested me most. Aronson, the novelist,
proved on acquaintance the worst kind of blighter. He considered
himself a genius whom it was the duty of the country to support,
and he sponged on his wretched relatives and anyone who would
lend him money. He was always babbling about his sins, and pretty
squalid they were. I should like to have flung him among a few
good old-fashioned full-blooded sinners of my acquaintance; they
would have scared him considerably. He told me that he sought
"reality" and "life" and "truth", but it was hard to see how he
could know much about them, for he spent half the day in bed smoking
cheap cigarettes, and the rest sunning himself in the admiration
of half-witted girls. The creature was tuberculous in mind and
body, and the only novel of his I read, pretty well turned my
stomach. Mr Aronson’s strong point was jokes about the war. If
he heard of any acquaintance who had joined up or was even doing
war work his merriment knew no bounds. My fingers used to itch
to box the little wretch’s ears.</p>

<p>Letchford was a different pair of shoes. He was some kind of
a man, to begin with, and had an excellent brain and the worst
manners conceivable. He contradicted everything you said, and
looked out for an argument as other people look for their dinner.
He was a double-engined, high-speed pacificist, because he was
the kind of cantankerous fellow who must always be in a minority.
If Britain had stood out of the war he would have been a raving
militarist, but since she was in it he had got to find reasons
why she was wrong. And jolly good reasons they were, too. I couldn’t
have met his arguments if I had wanted to, so I sat docilely at
his feet. The world was all crooked for Letchford, and God had
created him with two left hands. But the fellow had merits. He
had a couple of jolly children whom he adored, and he would walk
miles with me on a Sunday, and spout poetry about the beauty and
greatness of England. He was forty-five; if he had been thirty
and in my battalion I could have made a soldier out of him.</p>

<p>There were dozens more whose names I have forgotten, but they
had one common characteristic. They were puffed up with spiritual
pride, and I used to amuse myself with finding their originals
in the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>. When I tried to judge them
by the standard of old Peter, they fell woefully short. They shut
out the war from their lives, some out of funk, some out of pure
levity of mind, and some because they were really convinced that
the thing was all wrong. I think I grew rather popular in my role
of the seeker after truth, the honest colonial who was against
the war by instinct and was looking for instruction in the matter.
They regarded me as a convert from an alien world of action which
they secretly dreaded, though they affected to despise it. Anyhow
they talked to me very freely, and before long I had all the pacifist
arguments by heart. I made out that there were three schools.
One objected to war altogether, and this had few adherents except
Aronson and Weekes, <em>C.O., </em>now languishing in Dartmoor.
The second thought that the Allies’ cause was tainted, and that
Britain had contributed as much as Germany to the catastrophe.
This included all the adherents of the <em>L.D.A.—</em>or League
of Democrats against Aggression—a very proud body. The third and
much the largest, which embraced everybody else, held that we
had fought long enough and that the business could now be settled
by negotiation, since Germany had learned her lesson. I was myself
a modest member of the last school, but I was gradually working
my way up to the second, and I hoped with luck to qualify for
the first. My acquaintances approved my progress. Letchford said
I had a core of fanaticism in my slow nature, and that I would
end by waving the red flag.</p>

<p>Spiritual pride and vanity, as I have said, were at the bottom
of most of them, and, try as I might, I could find nothing very
dangerous in it all. This vexed me, for I began to wonder if the
mission which I had embarked on so solemnly were not going to
be a fiasco. Sometimes they worried me beyond endurance. When
the news of Messines came nobody took the slightest interest,
while I was aching to tooth every detail of the great fight. And
when they talked on military affairs, as Letchford and others
did sometimes, it was difficult to keep from sending them all
to the devil, for their amateur cocksureness would have riled
Job. One had got to batten down the recollection of our fellows
out there who were sweating blood to keep these fools snug. Yet
I found it impossible to be angry with them for long, they were
so babyishly innocent. Indeed, I couldn’t help liking them, and
finding a sort of quality in them. I had spent three years among
soldiers, and the British regular, great fellow that he is, has
his faults. His discipline makes him in a funk of red-tape and
any kind of superior authority. Now these people were quite honest
and in a perverted way courageous. Letchford was, at any rate.
I could no more have done what he did and got hunted off platforms
by the crowd and hooted at by women in the streets than I could
have written his leading articles.</p>

<p>All the same I was rather low about my job. Barring the episode
of the ransacking of my effects the first night, I had not a suspicion
of a clue or a hint of any mystery. The place and the people were
as open and bright as a <em>Y.M.C.A. </em>hut. But one day I got
a solid wad of comfort. In a corner of Letchford’s paper, the
<em>Critic</em>, I found a letter which was one of the steepest
pieces of invective I had ever met with. The writer gave tongue
like a beagle pup about the prostitution, as he called it, of
American republicanism to the vices of European aristocracies.
He declared that Senator La Follette was a much-misunderstood
patriot, seeing that he alone spoke for the toiling millions who
had no other friend. He was mad with President Wilson, and he
prophesied a great awakening when Uncle Sam got up against John
Bull in Europe and found out the kind of standpatter he was. The
letter was signed "John S. Blenkiron" and dated "London, July
3rd".</p>

<p>The thought that Blenkiron was in England put a new complexion
on my business. I reckoned I would see him soon, for he wasn’t
the man to stand still in his tracks. He had taken up the rôle
he had played before he left in December 1915, and very right
too, for not more than half a dozen people knew of the Erzerum
affair, and to the British public he was only the man who had
been fired out of the Savoy for talking treason. I had felt a
bit lonely before, but now somewhere within the four corners of
the island the best companion God ever made was writing nonsense
with his tongue in his old cheek.</p>

<p>There was an institution in Biggleswick which deserves mention.
On the south of the common, near the station, stood a red-brick
building called the Moot Hall, which was a kind of church for
the very undevout population. Undevout in the ordinary sense,
I mean, for I had already counted twenty-seven varieties of religious
conviction, including three Buddhists, a Celestial Hierarch, five
Latter-day Saints, and about ten varieties of Mystic whose names
I could never remember. The hall had been the gift of the publisher
I have spoken of, and twice a week it was used for lectures and
debates. The place was managed by a committee and was surprisingly
popular, for it gave all the bubbling intellects a chance of airing
their views. When you asked where somebody was and were told he
was "at Moot," the answer was spoken in the respectful tone in
which you would mention a sacrament.</p>

<p>I went there regularly and got my mind broadened to cracking
point. We had all the stars of the New Movements. We had Doctor
Chirk, who lectured on "God", which, as far as I could make out,
was a new name he had invented for himself. There was a woman,
a terrible woman, who had come back from Russia with what she
called a "message of healing". And to my joy, one night there
was a great buck nigger who had a lot to say about "Africa for
the Africans". I had a few words with him in Sesutu afterwards,
and rather spoiled his visit. Some of the people were extraordinarily
good, especially one jolly old fellow who talked about English
folk songs and dances, and wanted us to set up a Maypole. In the
debates which generally followed I began to join, very coyly at
first, but presently with some confidence. If my time at Biggleswick
did nothing else it taught me to argue on my feet.</p>

<p>The first big effort I made was on a full-dress occasion, when
Launcelot Wake came down to speak. Mr Ivery was in the chair—the
first I had seen of him—a plump middle-aged man, with a colourless
face and nondescript features. I was not interested in him till
he began to talk, and then I sat bolt upright and took notice.
For he was the genuine silver-tongue, the sentences flowing from
his mouth as smooth as butter and as neatly dovetailed as a parquet
floor. He had a sort of man-of-the-world manner, treating his
opponents with condescending geniality, deprecating all passion
and exaggeration and making you feel that his urbane statement
must be right, for if he had wanted he could have put the case
so much higher. I watched him, fascinated, studying his face carefully;
and the thing that struck me was that there was nothing in it—nothing,
that is to say, to lay hold on. It was simply nondescript, so
almightily commonplace that that very fact made it rather remarkable.</p>

<p>Wake was speaking of the revelations of the Sukhomlinov trial
in Russia, which showed that Germany had not been responsible
for the war. He was jolly good at the job, and put as clear an
argument as a first-class lawyer. I had been sweating away at
the subject and had all the ordinary case at my fingers’ ends,
so when I got a chance of speaking I gave them a long harangue,
with some good quotations I had cribbed out of the <em>Vossische
Zeitung</em>, which Letchford lent me. I felt it was up to me
to be extra violent, for I wanted to establish my character with
Wake, seeing that he was a friend of Mary and Mary would know
that I was playing the game. I got tremendously applauded, far
more than the chief speaker, and after the meeting Wake came up
to me with his hot eyes, and wrung my hand. "You’re coming on
well, Brand," he said, and then he introduced me to Mr Ivery.
"Here’s a second and a better Smuts," he said.</p>

<p>Ivery made me walk a bit of the road home with him. "I am struck
by your grip on these difficult problems, Mr Brand," he told me.
"There is much I can tell you, and you may be of great value to
our cause." He asked me a lot of questions about my past, which
I answered with easy mendacity. Before we parted he made me promise
to come one night to supper.</p>

<p>Next day I got a glimpse of Mary, and to my vexation she cut
me dead. She was walking with a flock of bare-headed girls, all
chattering hard, and though she saw me quite plainly she turned
away her eyes. I had been waiting for my cue, so I did not lift
my hat, but passed on as if we were strangers. I reckoned it was
part of the game, but that trifling thing annoyed me, and I spent
a morose evening.</p>

<p>The following day I saw her again, this time talking sedately
with Mr Ivery, and dressed in a very pretty summer gown, and a
broad-brimmed straw hat with flowers in it. This time she stopped
with a bright smile and held out her hand. "Mr Brand, isn’t it?"
she asked with a pretty hesitation. And then, turning to her companion—"This
is Mr Brand. He stayed with us last month in Gloucestershire."</p>

<p>Mr Ivery announced that he and I were already acquainted. Seen
in broad daylight he was a very personable fellow, somewhere between
forty-five and fifty, with a middle-aged figure and a curiously
young face. I noticed that there were hardly any lines on it,
and it was rather that of a very wise child than that of a man.
He had a pleasant smile which made his jaw and cheeks expand like
indiarubber. "You are coming to sup with me, Mr Brand," he cried
after me. "On Tuesday after Moot. I have already written." He
whisked Mary away from me, and I had to content myself with contemplating
her figure till it disappeared round a bend of the road.</p>

<p>Next day in London I found a letter from Peter. He had been very
solemn of late, and very reminiscent of old days now that he concluded
his active life was over. But this time he was in a different
mood. "<em>I think,</em>" he wrote, "<em>that you and I will meet
again soon, my old friend. Do you remember when we went after
the big black-maned lion in the Rooirand and couldn’t get on his
track, and then one morning we woke up and said we would get him
today?—and we did, but he very near got you first. I’ve had a
feel these last days that we’re both going down into the Valley
to meet with Apollyon, and that the devil will give us a bad time,
but anyhow we’ll be together.</em>"</p>

<p>I had the same kind of feel myself, though I didn’t see how Peter
and I were going to meet, unless I went out to the Front again
and got put in the bag and sent to the same Boche prison. But
I had an instinct that my time in Biggleswick was drawing to a
close, and that presently I would be in rougher quarters. I felt
quite affectionate towards the place, and took all my favourite
walks, and drank my own health in the brew of the village inns,
with a consciousness of saying goodbye. Also I made haste to finish
my English classics, for I concluded I wouldn’t have much time
in the future for miscellaneous reading.</p>

<p>The Tuesday came, and in the evening I set out rather late for
the Moot Hall, for I had been getting into decent clothes after
a long, hot stride. When I reached the place it was pretty well
packed, and I could only find a seat on the back benches. There
on the platform was Ivery, and beside him sat a figure that thrilled
every inch of me with affection and a wild anticipation. "I have
now the privilege," said the chairman, "of introducing to you
the speaker whom we so warmly welcome, our fearless and indefatigable
American friend, Mr Blenkiron."</p>

<p>It was the old Blenkiron, but almightily changed. His stoutness
had gone, and he was as lean as Abraham Lincoln. Instead of a
puffy face, his cheek-bones and jaw stood out hard and sharp,
and in place of his former pasty colour his complexion had the
clear glow of health. I saw now that he was a splendid figure
of a man, and when he got to his feet every movement had the suppleness
of an athlete in training. In that moment I realised that my serious
business had now begun. My senses suddenly seemed quicker, my
nerves tenser, my brain more active. The big game had started,
and he and I were playing it together.</p>

<p>I watched him with strained attention. It was a funny speech,
stuffed with extravagance and vehemence, not very well argued
and terribly discursive. His main point was that Germany was now
in a fine democratic mood and might well be admitted into a brotherly
partnership—that indeed she had never been in any other mood,
but had been forced into violence by the plots of her enemies.
Much of it, I should have thought, was in stark defiance of the
Defence of the Realm Acts, but if any wise Scotland Yard officer
had listened to it he would probably have considered it harmless
because of its contradictions. It was full of a fierce earnestness,
and it was full of humour—long-drawn American metaphors at which
that most critical audience roared with laughter. But it was not
the kind of thing that they were accustomed to, and I could fancy
what Wake would have said of it. The conviction grew upon me that
Blenkiron was deliberately trying to prove himself an honest idiot.
If so, it was a huge success. He produced on one the impression
of the type of sentimental revolutionary who ruthlessly knifes
his opponent and then weeps and prays over his tomb.</p>

<p>Just at the end he seemed to pull himself together and to try
a little argument. He made a great point of the Austrian socialists
going to Stockholm, going freely and with their Government’s assent,
from a country which its critics called an autocracy, while the
democratic western peoples held back. "I admit I haven’t any real
water-tight proof," he said, "but I will bet my bottom dollar
that the influence which moved the Austrian Government to allow
this embassy of freedom was the influence of Germany herself.
And that is the land from which the Allied Pharisees draw in their
skirts lest their garments be defiled!"</p>

<p>He sat down amid a good deal of applause, for his audience had
not been bored, though I could see that some of them thought his
praise of Germany a bit steep. It was all right in Biggleswick
to prove Britain in the wrong, but it was a slightly different
thing to extol the enemy. I was puzzled about his last point,
for it was not of a piece with the rest of his discourse, and
I was trying to guess at his purpose. The chairman referred to
it in his concluding remarks. "I am in a position," he said, "to
bear out all that the lecturer has said. I can go further. I can
assure him on the best authority that his surmise is correct,
and that Vienna’s decision to send delegates to Stockholm was
largely dictated by representations from Berlin. I am given to
understand that the fact has in the last few days been admitted
in the Austrian Press."</p>

<p>A vote of thanks was carried, and then I found myself shaking
hands with Ivery while Blenkiron stood a yard off, talking to
one of the Misses Weekes. The next moment I was being introduced.</p>

<p>"Mr Brand, very pleased to meet you," said the voice I knew so
well. "Mr Ivery has been telling me about you, and I guess we’ve
got something to say to each other. We’re both from noo countries,
and we’ve got to teach the old nations a little horse-sense."</p>

<p>Mr Ivery’s car—the only one left in the neighbourhood—carried
us to his villa, and presently we were seated in a brightly-lit
dining-room. It was not a pretty house, but it had the luxury
of an expensive hotel, and the supper we had was as good as any
London restaurant. Gone were the old days of fish and toast and
boiled milk. Blenkiron squared his shoulders and showed himself
a noble trencherman.</p>

<p>"A year ago," he told our host, "I was the meanest kind of dyspeptic.
I had the love of righteousness in my heart, but I had the devil
in my stomach. Then I heard stories about the Robson Brothers,
the star surgeons way out west in White Springs, Nebraska. They
were reckoned the neatest hands in the world at carving up a man
and removing devilments from his intestines. Now, sir, I’ve always
fought pretty shy of surgeons, for I considered that our Maker
never intended His handiwork to be reconstructed like a bankrupt
Dago railway. But by that time I was feeling so almighty wretched
that I could have paid a man to put a bullet through my head.
‘There’s no other way,’ I said to myself. ‘Either you forget your
religion and your miserable cowardice and get cut up, or it’s
you for the Golden Shore.’ So I set my teeth and journeyed to
White Springs, and the Brothers had a look at my duodenum. They
saw that the darned thing wouldn’t do, so they sidetracked it
and made a noo route for my noo-trition traffic. It was the cunningest
piece of surgery since the Lord took a rib out of the side of
our First Parent. They’ve got a mighty fine way of charging, too,
for they take five per cent of a man’s income, and it’s all one
to them whether he’s a Meat King or a clerk on twenty dollars
a week. I can tell you I took some trouble to be a very rich man
last year."</p>

<p>All through the meal I sat in a kind of stupor. I was trying
to assimilate the new Blenkiron, and drinking in the comfort of
his heavenly drawl, and I was puzzling my head about Ivery. I
had a ridiculous notion that I had seen him before, but, delve
as I might into my memory, I couldn’t place him. He was the incarnation
of the commonplace, a comfortable middle-class sentimentalist,
who patronised pacificism out of vanity, but was very careful
not to dip his hands too far. He was always damping down Blenkiron’s
volcanic utterances. "Of course, as you know, the other side have
an argument which I find rather hard to meet...." "I can sympathise
with patriotism, and even with jingoism, in certain moods, but
I always come back to this difficulty." "Our opponents are not
ill-meaning so much as ill-judging,"—these were the sort of sentences
he kept throwing in. And he was full of quotations from private
conversations he had had with every sort of person—including members
of the Government. I remember that he expressed great admiration
for Mr Balfour.</p>

<p>Of all that talk, I only recalled one thing clearly, and I recalled
it because Blenkiron seemed to collect his wits and try to argue,
just as he had done at the end of his lecture. He was speaking
about a story he had heard from someone, who had heard it from
someone else, that Austria in the last week of July 1914 had accepted
Russia’s proposal to hold her hand and negotiate, and that the
Kaiser had sent a message to the Tsar saying he agreed. According
to his story this telegram had been received in Petrograd, and
had been re-written, like Bismarck’s Ems telegram, before it reached
the Emperor. He expressed his disbelief in the yarn. "I reckon
if it had been true," he said, "we’d have had the right text out
long ago. They’d have kept a copy in Berlin. All the same I did
hear a sort of rumour that some kind of message of that sort was
published in a German paper."</p>

<p>Mr Ivery looked wise. "You are right," he said. "I happen to
know that it has been published. You will find it in the <em>Weser
Zeitung</em>."</p>

<p>"You don’t say?" he said admiringly. "I wish I could read the
old tombstone language. But if I could they wouldn’t let me have
the papers."</p>

<p>"Oh yes they would." Mr Ivery laughed pleasantly. "England has
still a good share of freedom. Any respectable person can get
a permit to import the enemy press. I’m not considered quite respectable,
for the authorities have a narrow definition of patriotism, but
happily I have respectable friends."</p>

<p>Blenkiron was staying the night, and I took my leave as the clock
struck twelve. They both came into the hall to see me off, and,
as I was helping myself to a drink, and my host was looking for
my hat and stick, I suddenly heard Blenkiron’s whisper in my ear.
"London ... the day after tomorrow," he said. Then he took a formal
farewell. "Mr Brand, it’s been an honour for me, as an American
citizen, to make your acquaintance, sir. I will consider myself
fortunate if we have an early reunion. I am stopping at Claridge’s
Ho-tel, and I hope to be privileged to receive you there."</p>
