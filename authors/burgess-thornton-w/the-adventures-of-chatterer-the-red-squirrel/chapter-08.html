When you grow careless even though<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It be in matters small,<br/>
Old Mr. Trouble you will find<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is bound to make a call.

<p>Some people never seem to learn that. You would suppose that
after all the trouble and worry Chatterer the Red Squirrel had
had, he would have learned a lesson. For a while it seemed as
if he had. Morning after morning, before anybody was up in Farmer
Brown's house, he visited Farmer Brown's corn-crib, taking the
greatest care not to be seen and to get back to his home in the
Old Orchard before it was time for Farmer Brown's boy to come
out and do his morning's work. And in the corn-crib he took the
greatest care to steal only where what he took would not be missed.
The empty cobs from which he had eaten the corn he hid in the
darkest corner behind the great pile of yellow corn, where they
would not be found until nearly all the corn had been taken from
the crib. Oh, he was very sly and crafty, was Chatterer the Red
Squirrel&mdash;at first.</p>

<p>But after a while, when nothing happened, Chatterer grew careless.
At first it had seemed very dangerous to go over to the corn-crib,
but after he had been there often, it didn't seem dangerous at
all. Once inside, he would just give himself up to having a good
time. He raced about over the great pile of beautiful yellow corn
and found the loveliest hiding places in it. Down in a dark corner
he made a splendid bed from pieces of husk which hadn't been stripped
from some of the ears. It was quite the nicest place he had ever
dreamed of, was Farmer Brown's corn-crib. He got to feeling that
it was his own and not Farmer Brown's at all.</p>

<p>The more that feeling grew, the more careless Chatterer became.
He dropped a grain of corn now and then and was too lazy to go
down and pick it up, or else didn't think anything about it. Farmer
Brown's boy, coming every morning for corn for the hens, noticed
these grains, but supposed they were some that had been rubbed
from the ears during the handling of them. Then one morning Chatterer
dropped a cob from which he had eaten all the corn. He meant to
get it and hide it, as he had hidden other cobs, but he didn't
want to do it just then. And later&mdash;well, then he forgot all about
it. Yes, Sir, he forgot all about it until he had reached his
home in the Old Orchard.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," thought Chatterer, "it doesn't matter. I can get
it and hide it to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>Now a corn-cob is a very simple thing. Farmer Brown's boy knew
where there was a whole pile of them. He added to that pile every
day, after shelling enough corn for the biddies. So it would seem
that there was nothing about a corn-cob to make him open his eyes
as he did that morning, when he saw the one left by Chatterer
the Red Squirrel. But you see he knew that a bare corn-cob had
no business inside the corn-crib, and suddenly those scattered
grains of corn had a new meaning for him.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" he exclaimed, "A thief has been here, after all! I
thought we were safe from rats and mice, and I don't see now how
they got in, for I don't, I really don't, see how they could climb
the stone legs of the corn-crib. But some one with sharp teeth
certainly has been in here. It must be that I have left the door
open some time, and a rat has slipped in. I'll just have to get
after you, Mr. Rat or Mr. Mouse. We can't have you in our corn-crib."</p>

<p>With that he went into the house. Presently he came back, and
in one hand was a rat-trap and in the other a mouse-trap.</p>
