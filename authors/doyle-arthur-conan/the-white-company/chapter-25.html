<P>
ON the morning after the jousting, when Alleyne Edricson went, as
was his custom, into his master's chamber to wait upon him in his
dressing and to curl his hair, he found him already up and very
busily at work.  He sat at a table by the window, a deerhound on
one side of him and a lurcher on the other, his feet tucked away
under the trestle on which he sat, and his tongue in his cheek,
with the air of a man who is much perplexed. A sheet of vellum
lay upon the board in front of him, and he held a pen in his
hand, with which he had been scribbling in a rude schoolboy hand.
So many were the blots, however, and so numerous the scratches
and erasures, that he had at last given it up in despair, and
sat with his single uncovered eye cocked upwards at the ceiling,
as one who waits upon inspiration.
<P>
"By Saint Paul!" he cried, as Alleyne entered, "you are the man
who will stand by me in this matter.  I have been in sore need of
you, Alleyne."
<P>
"God be with you, my fair lord!" the squire answered.  "I trust
that you have taken no hurt from all that you have gone through
yesterday."
<P>
"Nay; I feel the fresher for it, Alleyne.  It has eased my
joints, which were somewhat stiff from these years of peace.  I
trust, Alleyne, that thou didst very carefully note and mark the
bearing and carriage of this knight of France; for it is time,
now when you are young, that you should see all that is best, and
mould your own actions in accordance.  This was a man from whom
much honor might be gained, and I have seldom met any one for
whom I have conceived so much love and esteem. Could I but learn
his name, I should send you to him with my cartel, that we might
have further occasion to watch his goodly feats of arms."
<P>
"It is said, my fair lord, that none know his name save only the
Lord Chandos, and that he is under vow not to speak it.  So ran
the gossip at the squires' table."
<P>
"Be he who he might, he was a very hardy gentleman.  But I have a
task here, Alleyne, which is harder to me than aught that was set
before me yesterday."
<P>
"Can I help you, my lord?"
<P>
"That indeed you can.  I have been writing my greetings to my
sweet wife; for I hear that a messenger goes from the prince to
Southampton within the week, and he would gladly take a packet
for me.  I pray you, Alleyne, to cast your eyes upon what I have
written, and see it they are such words as my lady will
understand.  My fingers, as you can see, are more used to iron
and leather than to the drawing of strokes and turning of
letters.  What then?  Is there aught amiss, that you should
stare so?"
<P>
"It is this first word, my lord.  In what tongue were you pleased
to write?"
<P>
"In English; for my lady talks it more than she doth French.
<P>
"Yet this is no English word, my sweet lord.  Here are four t's
and never a letter betwixt them."
<P>
"By St. Paul!  it seemed strange to my eye when I wrote it," said
Sir Nigel.  "They bristle up together like a clump of lances.  We
must break their ranks and set them farther apart.  The word is
'that.' Now I will read it to you, Alleyne, and you shall write
it out fair; for we leave Bordeaux this day, and it would be
great joy to me to think that the Lady Loring had word from me."
<P>
Alleyne sat down as ordered, with a pen in his hand and a fresh
sheet of parchment before him, while Sir Nigel slowly spelled out
his letter, running his forefinger on from word to word.
<P>
"That my heart is with thee, my dear sweeting, is what thine own
heart will assure thee of.  All is well with us here, save that
Pepin hath the mange on his back, and Pommers hath scarce yet got
clear of his stiffness from being four days on ship-board, and
the more so because the sea was very high, and we were like to
founder on account of a hole in her side, which was made by a
stone cast at us by certain sea-rovers, who may the saints have
in their keeping, for they have gone from amongst us, as has
young Terlake, and two-score mariners and archers, who would be
the more welcome here as there is like to be a very fine war,
with much honor and all hopes of advancement, for which I go to
gather my Company together, who are now at Montaubon, where they
pillage and destroy; yet I hope that, by God's help, I may be
able to show that I am their master, even as, my sweet lady, I am
thy servant."
<P>
"How of that, Alleyne?" continued Sir Nigel, blinking at his
squire, with an expression of some pride upon his face.  "Have I
not told her all that hath befallen us?"
<P>
"You have said much, my fair lord; and yet, if I may say so, it
is somewhat crowded together, so that my Lady Loring can, mayhap,
scarce follow it.  Were it in shorter periods----"
<P>
"Nay, it boots me not how you marshal them, as long as they are
all there at the muster.  Let my lady have the words, and she
will place them in such order as pleases her best.  But I would
have you add what it would please her to know."
<P>
"That will I," said Alleyne, blithely, and bent to the task.
<P>
"My fair lady and mistress," he wrote, "God hath had us in His
keeping, and my lord is well and in good cheer.  He hath won much
honor at the jousting before the prince, when he alone was able
to make it good against a very valiant man from France.  Touching
the moneys, there is enough and to spare until we reach
Montaubon.  Herewith, my fair lady, I send my humble regards,
entreating you that you will give the same to your daughter, the
Lady Maude.  May the holy saints have you both in their keeping
is ever the prayer of thy servant,
        "ALLEYNE EDRICSON."
<P>
"That is very fairly set forth," said Sir Nigel, nodding his bald
head as each sentence was read to him.  "And for thyself,
Alleyne, if there be any dear friend to whom you would fain give
greeting, I can send it for thee within this packet."
<P>
"There is none," said Alleyne, sadly.
<P>
"Have you no kinsfolk, then?"
<P>
"None, save my brother."
<P>
"Ha! I had forgotten that there was ill blood betwixt you. But
are there none in all England who love thee?"
<P>
"None that I dare say so."
<P>
"And none whom you love?"
<P>
"Nay, I will not say that," said Alleyne.
<P>
Sir Nigel shook his head and laughed softly to himself, "I see
how it is with you," he said.  "Have I not noted your frequent
sighs and vacant eye?  Is she fair?"
<P>
"She is indeed," cried Alleyne from his heart, all tingling at
this sudden turn of the talk.
<P>
"And good?"
<P>
"As an angel."
<P>
"And yet she loves you not?"
<P>
"Nay, I cannot say that she loves another."
<P>
"Then you have hopes?"
<P>
"I could not live else."
<P>
"Then must you strive to be worthy of her love.  Be brave and
pure, fearless to the strong and humble to the weak; and so,
whether this love prosper or no, you will have fitted yourself to
be honored by a maiden's love, which is, in sooth, the highest
guerdon which a true knight can hope for."
<P>
"Indeed, my lord, I do so strive," said Alleyne; "but she is so
sweet, so dainty, and of so noble a spirit, that I fear me that I
shall never be worthy of her."
<P>
"By thinking so you become worthy.  Is she then of noble birth?"
<P>
"She is, my lord," faltered Alleyne.
<P>
"Of a knightly house?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Have a care, Alleyne, have a care!" said Sir Nigel, kindly. "The
higher the steed the greater the fall.  Hawk not at that which
may be beyond thy flight."
<P>
"My lord, I know little of the ways and usages of the world,"
cried Alleyne, "but I would fain ask your rede upon the matter.
You have known my father and my kin: is not my family one of good
standing and repute?"
<P>
"Beyond all question."
<P>
"And yet you warn me that I must not place my love too high."
<P>
"Were Minstead yours, Alleyne, then, by St. Paul!  I cannot think
that any family in the land would not be proud to take you among
them, seeing that you come of so old a strain.  But while the
Socman lives----Ha, by my soul!" if this is not Sir Oliver's step
I am the more mistaken."
<P>
As he spoke, a heavy footfall was heard without, and the portly
knight flung open the door and strode into the room.
<P>
"Why, my little coz," said he, "I have come across to tell you
that I live above the barber's in the Rue de la Tour, and that
there is a venison pasty in the oven and two flasks of the right
vintage on the table.  By St. James! a blind man might find the
place, for one has but to get in the wind from it, and follow the
savory smell.  Put on your cloak, then, and come, for Sir Walter
Hewett and Sir Robert Briquet, with one or two others, are
awaiting us."
<P>
"Nay, Oliver, I cannot be with you, for I must to Montaubon this
day."
<P>
"To Montaubon?  But I have heard that your Company is to come
with my forty Winchester rascals to Dax."
<P>
"If you will take charge of them, Oliver.  For I will go to
Montaubon with none save my two squires and two archers.  Then,
when I have found the rest of my Company I shall lead them to
Dax.  We set forth this morning."
<P>
"Then I must back to my pasty," said Sir Oliver.  "You will find
us at Dax, I doubt not, unless the prince throw me into prison,
for he is very wroth against me."
<P>
"And why, Oliver?"
<P>
"Pardieu! because I have sent my cartel, gauntlet, and defiance
to Sir John Chandos and to Sir William Felton."
<P>
"To Chandos?  In God's name, Oliver, why have you done this?"
<P>
"Because he and the other have used me despitefully."
<P>
"And how?"
<P>
"Because they have passed me over in choosing those who should
joust for England.  Yourself and Audley I could pass, coz, for
you are mature men; but who are Wake, and Percy, and Beauchamp?
By my soul!  I was prodding for my food into a camp-kettle when
they were howling for their pap.  Is a man of my weight and
substance to be thrown aside for the first three half-grown lads
who have learned the trick of the tilt-yard? But hark ye, coz, I
think of sending my cartel also to the prince."
<P>
"Oliver!  Oliver!  You are mad!"
<P>
"Not I, i' faith!  I care not a denier whether he be prince or
no.  By Saint James!  I see that your squire's eyes are starting
from his head like a trussed crab.  Well, friend, we are all
three men of Hampshire, and not lightly to be jeered at."
<P>
"Has he jeered at you than?"
<P>
"Pardieu! yes, 'Old Sir Oliver's heart is still stout,' said one
of his court.  'Else had it been out of keeping with the rest of
him,' quoth the prince.  'And his arm is strong,' said another.
'So is the backbone of his horse,' quoth the prince.  This very
day I will send him my cartel and defiance."
<P>
"Nay, nay, my dear Oliver," said Sir Nigel, laying his hand upon
his angry friend's arm.  "There is naught in this, for it was but
saying that you were a strong and robust man, who had need of a
good destrier.  And as to Chandos and Felton, bethink you that if
when you yourself were young the older lances had ever been
preferred, how would you then have had the chance to earn the
good name and fame which you now bear? You do not ride as light
as you did, Oliver, and I ride lighter by the weight of my hair,
but it would be an ill thing if in the evening of our lives we
showed that our hearts were less true and loyal than of old.  If
such a knight as Sir Oliver Buttesthorn may turn against his own
prince for the sake of a light word, then where are we to look
for steadfast faith and constancy?"
<P>
"Ah! my dear little coz, it is easy to sit in the sunshine and
preach to the man in the shadow.  Yet you could ever win me over
to your side with that soft voice of yours.  Let us think no more
of it then.  But, holy Mother!  I had forgot the pasty, and it
will be as scorched as Judas Iscariot!  Come, Nigel, lest the
foul fiend get the better of me again."
<P>
"For one hour, then; for we march at mid-day.  Tell Aylward,
Alleyne, that he is to come with me to Montaubon, and to choose
one archer for his comrade.  The rest will to Dax when the prince
starts, which will be before the feast of the Epiphany.  Have
Pommers ready at mid-day with my sycamore lance, and place my
harness on the sumpter mule."
<P>
With these brief directions, the two old soldiers strode off
together, while Alleyne hastened to get all in order for their
journey.
