<P>Rosa had scarcely pronounced these consolatory words when a 
voice was heard from the staircase asking Gryphus how 
matters were going on.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you hear, father?&quot; said Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Master Jacob calls you, he is uneasy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There was such a noise,&quot; said Gryphus; &quot;wouldn't you have 
thought he would murder me, this doctor? They are always 
very troublesome fellows, these scholars.&quot;</P>
<P>Then, pointing with his finger towards the staircase, he 
said to Rosa: &quot;Just lead the way, Miss.&quot;</P>
<P>After this he locked the door and called out: &quot;I shall be 
with you directly, friend Jacob.&quot;</P>
<P>Poor Cornelius, thus left alone with his bitter grief, 
muttered to himself,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Ah, you old hangman! it is me you have trodden under foot; 
you have murdered me; I shall not survive it.&quot;</P>
<P>And certainly the unfortunate prisoner would have fallen ill 
but for the counterpoise which Providence had granted to his 
grief, and which was called Rosa.</P>
<P>In the evening she came back. Her first words announced to 
Cornelius that henceforth her father would make no objection 
to his cultivating flowers.</P>
<P>&quot;And how do you know that?&quot; the prisoner asked, with a 
doleful look.</P>
<P>&quot;I know it because he has said so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To deceive me, perhaps.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, he repents.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah yes! but too late.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This repentance is not of himself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And who put it into him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you only knew how his friend scolded him!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, Master Jacob; he does not leave you, then, that Master 
Jacob?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At any rate, he leaves us as little as he can help.&quot;</P>
<P>Saying this, she smiled in such a way that the little cloud 
of jealousy which had darkened the brow of Cornelius 
speedily vanished.</P>
<P>&quot;How was it?&quot; asked the prisoner.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, being asked by his friend, my father told at supper 
the whole story of the tulip, or rather of the bulb, and of 
his own fine exploit of crushing it.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius heaved a sigh, which might have been called a 
groan.</P>
<P>&quot;Had you only seen Master Jacob at that moment!&quot; continued 
Rosa. &quot;I really thought he would set fire to the castle; his 
eyes were like two flaming torches, his hair stood on end, 
and he clinched his fist for a moment; I thought he would 
have strangled my father.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;'You have done that,' he cried, 'you have crushed the 
bulb?'</P>
<P>&quot;'Indeed I have.'</P>
<P>&quot;'It is infamous,' said Master Jacob, 'it is odious! You 
have committed a great crime!'</P>
<P>&quot;My father was quite dumbfounded.</P>
<P>&quot;'Are you mad, too?' he asked his friend.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, what a worthy man is this Master Jacob!&quot; muttered 
Cornelius,  -  &quot;an honest soul, an excellent heart that he 
is.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The truth is, that it is impossible to treat a man more 
rudely than he did my father; he was really quite in 
despair, repeating over and over again,  - </P>
<P>&quot;'Crushed, crushed the bulb! my God, my God! crushed!'</P>
<P>&quot;Then, turning toward me, he asked, 'But it was not the only 
one that he had?'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did he ask that?&quot; inquired Cornelius, with some anxiety.</P>
<P>&quot;'You think it was not the only one?' said my father. 'Very 
well, we shall search for the others.'</P>
<P>&quot;'You will search for the others?' cried Jacob, taking my 
father by the collar; but he immediately loosed him. Then, 
turning towards me, he continued, asking 'And what did that 
poor young man say?'</P>
<P>&quot;I did not know what to answer, as you had so strictly 
enjoined me never to allow any one to guess the interest 
which you are taking in the bulb. Fortunately, my father 
saved me from the difficulty by chiming in,  - </P>
<P>&quot;'What did he say? Didn't he fume and fret?'</P>
<P>&quot;I interrupted him, saying, 'Was it not natural that be 
should be furious, you were so unjust and brutal, father?'</P>
<P>&quot;'Well, now, are you mad?' cried my father; 'what immense 
misfortune is it to crush a tulip bulb? You may buy a 
hundred of them in the market of Gorcum.'</P>
<P>&quot;'Perhaps some less precious one than that was!' I quite 
incautiously replied.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what did Jacob say or do at these words?&quot; asked 
Cornelius.</P>
<P>&quot;At these words, if I must say it, his eyes seemed to flash 
like lightning.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; said Cornelius, &quot;that was not all; I am sure he said 
something in his turn.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;'So, then, my pretty Rosa,' he said, with a voice as sweet 
a honey,  -  'so you think that bulb to have been a precious 
one?'</P>
<P>&quot;I saw that I had made a blunder.</P>
<P>&quot;'What do I know?' I said, negligently; 'do I understand 
anything of tulips? I only know  -  as unfortunately it is 
our lot to live with prisoners  -  that for them any pastime 
is of value. This poor Mynheer van Baerle amused himself 
with this bulb. Well, I think it very cruel to take from him 
the only thing that he could have amused himself with.'</P>
<P>&quot;'But, first of all,' said my father, 'we ought to know how 
he has contrived to procure this bulb.'</P>
<P>&quot;I turned my eyes away to avoid my father's look; but I met 
those of Jacob.</P>
<P>&quot;It was as if he had tried to read my thoughts at the bottom 
of my heart.</P>
<P>&quot;Some little show of anger sometimes saves an answer. I 
shrugged my shoulders, turned my back, and advanced towards 
the door.</P>
<P>&quot;But I was kept by something which I heard, although it was 
uttered in a very low voice only.</P>
<P>&quot;Jacob said to my father,  - </P>
<P>&quot;'It would not be so difficult to ascertain that.'</P>
<P>&quot;'How so?'</P>
<P>&quot;'You need only search his person: and if he has the other 
bulbs, we shall find them, as there usually are three 
suckers!'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Three suckers!&quot; cried Cornelius. &quot;Did you say that I have 
three?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The word certainly struck me just as much as it does you. I 
turned round. They were both of them so deeply engaged in 
their conversation that they did not observe my movement.</P>
<P>&quot;'But,' said my father, 'perhaps he has not got his bulbs 
about him?'</P>
<P>&quot;'Then take him down, under some pretext or other and I will 
search his cell in the meanwhile.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Halloa, halloa!&quot; said Cornelius. &quot;But this Mr. Jacob of 
yours is a villain, it seems.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am afraid he is.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tell me, Rosa,&quot; continued Cornelius, with a pensive air.</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did you not tell me that on the day when you prepared your 
borders this man followed you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So he did.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That he glided like a shadow behind the elder trees?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That not one of your movements escaped him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not one, indeed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Rosa,&quot; said Cornelius, growing quite pale.</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It was not you he was after.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who else, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is not you that he was in love with!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But with whom else?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He was after my bulb, and is in love with my tulip!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You don't say so! And yet it is very possible,&quot; said Rosa.</P>
<P>&quot;Will you make sure of it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In what manner?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, it would be very easy!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tell me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go to-morrow into the garden; manage matters so that Jacob 
may know, as he did the first time, that you are going 
there, and that he may follow you. Feign to put the bulb 
into the ground; leave the garden, but look through the 
keyhole of the door and watch him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, and what then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What then? We shall do as he does.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Rosa, with a sigh, &quot;you are very fond of your 
bulbs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To tell the truth,&quot; said the prisoner, sighing likewise, 
&quot;since your father crushed that unfortunate bulb, I feel as 
if part of my own self had been paralyzed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now just hear me,&quot; said Rosa; &quot;will you try something 
else?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Will you accept the proposition of my father?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Which proposition?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did not he offer to you tulip bulbs by hundreds?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed he did.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Accept two or three, and, along with them, you may grow the 
third sucker.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, that would do very well,&quot; said Cornelius, knitting his 
brow; &quot;if your father were alone, but there is that Master 
Jacob, who watches all our ways.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, that is true; but only think! you are depriving 
yourself, as I can easily see, of a very great pleasure.&quot;</P>
<P>She pronounced these words with a smile, which was not 
altogether without a tinge of irony.</P>
<P>Cornelius reflected for a moment; he evidently was 
struggling against some vehement desire.</P>
<P>&quot;No!&quot; he cried at last, with the stoicism of a Roman of old, 
&quot;it would be a weakness, it would be a folly, it would be a 
meanness! If I thus give up the only and last resource which 
we possess to the uncertain chances of the bad passions of 
anger and envy, I should never deserve to be forgiven. No, 
Rosa, no; to-morrow we shall come to a conclusion as to the 
spot to be chosen for your tulip; you will plant it 
according to my instructions; and as to the third sucker,&quot; 
 -  Cornelius here heaved a deep sigh,  -  &quot;watch over it as a 
miser over his first or last piece of gold; as the mother 
over her child; as the wounded over the last drop of blood 
in his veins; watch over it, Rosa! Some voice within me 
tells me that it will be our saving, that it will be a 
source of good to us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Be easy, Mynheer Cornelius,&quot; said Rosa, with a sweet 
mixture of melancholy and gravity, &quot;be easy; your wishes are 
commands to me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And even,&quot; continued Van Baerle, warming more and more with 
his subject, &quot;if you should perceive that your steps are 
watched, and that your speech has excited the suspicion of 
your father and of that detestable Master Jacob,  -  well, 
Rosa, don't hesitate for one moment to sacrifice me, who am 
only still living through you,  -  me, who have no one in the 
world but you; sacrifice me,  -  don't come to see me any 
more.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa felt her heart sink within her, and her eyes were 
filling with tears.</P>
<P>&quot;Alas!&quot; she said.</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Cornelius.</P>
<P>&quot;I see one thing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you see?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I see,&quot; said she, bursting out in sobs, &quot;I see that you 
love your tulips with such love as to have no more room in 
your heart left for other affections.&quot;</P>
<P>Saying this, she fled.</P>
<P>Cornelius, after this, passed one of the worst nights he 
ever had in his life.</P>
<P>Rosa was vexed with him, and with good reason. Perhaps she 
would never return to see the prisoner, and then he would 
have no more news, either of Rosa or of his tulips.</P>
<P>We have to confess, to the disgrace of our hero and of 
floriculture, that of his two affections he felt most 
strongly inclined to regret the loss of Rosa; and when, at 
about three in the morning, he fell asleep overcome with 
fatigue, and harassed with remorse, the grand black tulip 
yielded precedence in his dreams to the sweet blue eyes of 
the fair maid of Friesland. </P></article>
