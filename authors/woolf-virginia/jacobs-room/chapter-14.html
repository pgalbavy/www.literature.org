<p>"He left everything just as it was," Bonamy marvelled. "Nothing
arranged. All his letters strewn about for any one to read. What
did he expect? Did he think he would come back?" he mused, standing
in the middle of Jacob's room.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century has its distinction. These houses were
built, say, a hundred and fifty years ago. The rooms are shapely,
the ceilings high; over the doorways a rose or a ram's skull is
carved in the wood. Even the panels, painted in raspberry-coloured
paint, have their distinction.</p>

<p>Bonamy took up a bill for a hunting-crop.</p>

<p>"That seems to be paid," he said.</p>

<p>There were Sandra's letters.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durrant was taking a party to Greenwich.</p>

<p>Lady Rocksbier hoped for the pleasure....</p>

<p>Listless is the air in an empty room, just swelling the curtain;
the flowers in the jar shift. One fibre in the wicker arm-chair
creaks, though no one sits there.</p>

<p>Bonamy crossed to the window. Pickford's van swung down the street.
The omnibuses were locked together at Mudie's corner. Engines
throbbed, and carters, jamming the brakes down, pulled their horses
sharp up. A harsh and unhappy voice cried something unintelligible.
And then suddenly all the leaves seemed to raise themselves.</p>

<p>"Jacob! Jacob!" cried Bonamy, standing by the window. The leaves
sank down again.</p>

<p>"Such confusion everywhere!" exclaimed Betty Flanders, bursting
open the bedroom door.</p>

<p>Bonamy turned away from the window.</p>

<p>"What am I to do with these, Mr. Bonamy?"</p>

<p>She held out a pair of Jacob's old shoes.</p>
