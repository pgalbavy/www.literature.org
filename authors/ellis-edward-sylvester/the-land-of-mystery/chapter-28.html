<p>Suddenly a bushy bead, with a black face, horribly distorted
by passion, appeared at the window furthest from where Professor
Grimcke was standing.</p>

<p>The right hand was raised and in the act of poising a javelin
to hurl at the white man; but the latter, with an incredibly quick
movement, brought his Winchester to a level and fired.</p>

<p>The bronze skull was shattered as though it were a rotten apple,
and the Murhapa, with a resounding shriek, went backward in the
darkness.</p>

<p>A slight rustling at the other window drew the white man's attention
thither, and, without lowering his weapon, he let fly at a group
who were simply peering within, evidently believing there was
no call to use their javelins.</p>

<p>Another screech told that the bullet had found its mark, and
the other faces vanished.</p>

<p>Then Grimcke stepped out from the wall to gain a view of the
opening which answered for a door.  A rustling there told him
a crowd were gathering, but they had taken warning just in time
to avoid a third shot.  Then he slipped a couple more cartridges
from his belt into the magazine, so as to keep it full, and awaited
the next step in this extraordinary business.</p>

<p>"I've about a hundred left," he reflected, "and that's enough
to keep things on a jump, if I can dodge their javelins."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jared Long was not idle.  He had but the opening at
the rear to watch, and he did the duty well.  Almost at the moment
that his comrade fired his first shot, he descried the figure
of a Murhapa trying to steal into the apartment without detection;
but just enough of the moonlight that was shut from the front
doors and windows, reached the rear of the building, to disclose
the outlines of the head and shoulders, as he began stealthily
creeping into the building.</p>

<p>Bippo had discovered the peril at the same moment, and clutched
the arm of his master with a nervous intensity of terror.  Long
impatiently shook him off, and, with the same cool quickness of
Professor Grimcke, drove a bullet through the head of the dusky
miscreant, who was slain so suddenly that he rolled convulsively
backward, without any outcry.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant, a second native emitted a wild shout. 
He was directly behind the first and the latter lurched against
him, causing such fright that he leaped back several feet with
the involuntary cry fully understood by all whose ears it reached.</p>

<p>Long stood as rigid as a statue for several minutes, waiting
for another chance, but none presented.  Then he reflected that
his position was much more favorable than Grimcke's, for not only
had he but the single opening to guard, but his apartment was
so shrouded in gloom that the sharpest-eyed warrior could not
locate him from the outside.</p>

<p>The New Englander stepped to the door communicating with the
front apartment and, barely showing himself, spoke:</p>

<p>"I can attend to the window on the right, Professor; leave that
to me, while you watch the door and the other one."</p>

<p>"Thanks," returned his friend; "I think there is a little too
much light in this part of the house."</p>

<p>Moving quickly to the hearth he heaped the ashes with his foot
upon the blazing embers, until they were so smothered that only
a few tiny twists of flame struggled through the covering.  This
left the place in such darkness that a sense of security instantly
came to him.</p>

<p>"Good!" called the New Englander, who could no longer be discerned;
"that makes matters more nearly equal!"</p>

<p>Although, as we have said, the moonlight was substantially shut
off from the front of the heavy structure, yet the moon itself,
being full, so illumined the surroundings that it was quite easy
to distinguish the head and figure of any one of their enemies
the instant he presented himself at one of the openings.</p>

<p>What both the defenders feared was, that the savages would make
a sudden rush and force themselves within the cabin in spite of
the disastrous reception they were sure to be given.  Such an
essay was certain to result in the overthrow of the whites, but
the Murhapas must have realized the cost it would be to them. 
Brave as they were, they hesitated to incur the consequences until
other means had failed.</p>

<p>Professor Ernest Grimcke now did a most daring thing.  The fierce
welcome he had given the attacking Murhapas resulted in their
temporary demoralization.  Knowing they would speedily recover,
he decided to take advantage of the panic by an attempt to intensify
it.</p>

<p>Striding to the door he paused on the very threshold and peered
out upon the large space in his field of vision.</p>

<p>Fully a hundred savages were in sight.  Apparently they had been
crowding around the entrance when the shots from within caused
a hasty scattering.  They had halted a dozen yards or so away,
where they were talking excitedly, still frightened and enraged,
and with no thought of relinquishing the fight.</p>

<p>They had withdrawn so far from the front of the building that
they were in the strong moonlight, and consequently in full view
of the white man, who saw others of the natives hurrying from
the right and left. Among them were women and children and the
confusion and excitement were fearful.</p>

<p>Standing thus, Grimcke again raised his repeater and deliberately
opened fire on the crowd.  It seemed cruel, but it was an act
of self-defence, for those people were clamoring for the lives
of the two men within, and would not be satisfied until they were
at their mercy.</p>

<p>It was a strange scene that followed.  The interior of the building
being dark, while the moonlight failed to touch the front, the
figure of the white man was invisible to the dusky wretches howling
on the outside.</p>

<p>All at once, from the black opening of the building, came the
crash of the repeating Winchester.  Spouts of fire shot out into
the gloom in terrific succession, as if fiery serpents were darting
their heads in different directions; for the marksman aimed, quickly
to the right, to the left and to the front, never pausing until
he had discharged half a score of shots.</p>

<p>The panic for a minute or two was indescribable.  Men, women
and children shrieked and scattered for the nearest available
shelter. Behind the buildings and down the river bank they dashed,
stumbled and rolled, until, but for the tragic nature of the scene,
the white man would have smiled.</p>

<p>But he had done enough, and he stepped back within the room to
replenish the magazine of his rifle.</p>

<p>Jared Long had been drawn into the room by the furious fusillade,
and now put the startling question whether advantage could not
be taken of the panic to make a sudden dash for the woods.  It
would never do to make for the boat still resting against the
shore, for it would be filled with poisoned javelins before they
could shove out into the Xingu.</p>

<p>"I believe we can," replied the Professor; "it will take them
some minutes to get over their panic and that will be enough for
us."</p>

<p>"Let us leave by the rear," said Long, "for I don't think that
is so well guarded."</p>

<p>The two turned to attempt the dash for freedom, when a cry from
Bippo struck them.</p>

<p>"Stay here," exclaimed the New Englander, fearing that a diversion
was on foot; "and I'll attend to him!"</p>

<p>He was back in the apartment in an instant.  The light on the
hearth having been extinguished, the gloom in this portion of
the building was impenetrable, but a fearful struggle of some
kind was going on.  Some animal or person had got within and grappled
Bippo who was fighting like a tiger.</p>

<p>Had the New Englander been able to distinguish the combatants,
he would have ended the contest in a twinkling, but though the
two rolled against his feet, he dared not fire through fear of
hurting his friend.</p>

<p>"Are you under or on top?" he asked, bending downward at the
moment he knew from the peculiar sounds the foes had become stationary.</p>

<p>"<em>He on top</em>," was the doleful response.</p>

<p>Long extended his right hand to learn precisely how matters stood,
or rather lay, when it came in contact with the arm of a Murhapa
in the act of raising it aloft to bury his knife in the body of
the helpless Bippo, who was at the mercy of the savage, holding
him inextricably in his grasp.</p>

<p>The American secured a firm hold of the forearm, and with a powerful
wrench, not only jerked the miscreant free, but flung him from
one side of the room clean to the door, where he was visible in
the faint light beyond.</p>

<p>Evidently concluding that his mission in that place was over,
he nimbly came to his feet and shot like a rocket through the
opening.</p>

<p>The New Englander was in no mood for sentimentality, and, he
levelled his weapon with the intention to kill; but quick as he
was, he was just a fraction of a minute too late, and, much to
his chagrin, the dusky wretch got away unharmed.</p>

<p>Long darted into the front room, ready for the proposal he had
made just before.</p>

<p>The Professor was peering out, seemingly debating whether it
was not advisable to re-open his bombardment.</p>

<p>"It beats creation," he remarked, as his friend appeared at his
elbow, "how quickly those fellows rally; their heads are popping
up in every direction, and it won't do to try to steal out this
way."</p>

<p>"But I suggested the rear," reminded Long.</p>

<p>"Let's see how matters look there."</p>

<p>The survey from the other opening was disappointing.  Although
all the Murhapas had been affected in a greater or less degree
by the panic, yet it was more incomplete at the rear, because
the confusing volley had not come from that direction.</p>

<p>There seemed to be fully as many warriors on this side, which,
with the exception of the river, was quite similar in appearance
to the other. The shadowy figures were observed moving noiselessly
in a dozen different directions, their heads bent down and their
bodies crouching, as if in expectation of a shot, but, at the
same time, they were not to be frightened off by any fusilade
from within.</p>

<p>"We're just too late," remarked the Professor, quick to take
in every point of the situation; "we might have done it a minute
ago, but they are watching too closely now."</p>

<p>"Let's open again," suggested the New Englander.</p>

<p>"Better wait awhile; they can be stampeded easier then than now,"
was the reply of the Professor.</p>

<p>During this lull, when it may be said the defenders were becoming
accustomed to the siege, they had time to give a few minutes'
thought to their absent friends, Fred Ashman and Ziffak, regarding
whom it was natural to feel great curiosity.</p>

<p>They believed themselves warranted in hoping for the best, so
far as Ashman was concerned.  He had probably strolled some distance,
and must have been warned by the firing of the Professor's Winchester
from the front, of the serious danger in which his friends were
involved.  If all had gone well with the youth up to that time,
he ought to be wise enough to get away without an instant's delay. 
What was feared was, that in his anxiety to help his comrades,
he would run into a peril from which he could not extricate himself.</p>

<p>The real hope for the youth was centered on Ziffak.  Believing
he had gone forth to look after Ashman, they were confident he
would speedily get upon his track.  If so, he would not permit
him to return to the village.</p>

<p>From what the reader has been told, it will be seen that the
defenders were not far off in their conjectures.</p>

<p>But, when they came to speculate upon the part that the head
chieftain was likely to take, affecting Grimcke and Long, they
were all at sea. It would ever be a source of wonder that he had
been transformed from a relentless enemy into the strongest of
friends, but they fully realized that such friendship must have
its bounds.</p>

<p>Ziffak might not shrink from using very plain speech when talking
face to face with his brother, but it was hardly to be supposed
that he would raise his arm against his authority.   At the time
Ziffak made known the probability that the explorers might be
compelled to take their departure that evening, he gave no intimation
of any purpose of helping them to resist such an order.</p>

<p>Accustomed as he was to lead the warlike Murhapas in battle,
he might well hesitate to ask them to turn their weapons against
the king, and if he should presume on such treason, all the probabilities
were that such weapons would be turned against the head chieftain
himself.</p>
