<P>
ABSORBED in herself, Mercy failed to notice the opening door or
to hear the murmur of voices in the conservatory.
<P>
The one terrible necessity which had been present to her mind at
intervals for a week past was confronting her at that moment. She
owed to Grace Roseberry the tardy justice of owning the truth.
The longer her confession was delayed, the more cruelly she was
injuring the woman whom she had robbed of her identity--the
friendless woman who had neither witnesses nor papers to produce,
who was powerless to right her own wrong. Keenly as she felt
this, Mercy failed, nevertheless, to conquer the horror that
shook her when she thought of the impending avowal. Day followed
day, and still she shrank from the unendurable ordeal of
confession--as she was shrinking from it now!
<P>
Was it fear for herself that closed her lips?
<P>
She trembled--as any human being in her place must have
trembled--at the bare idea of finding herself thrown back again
on the world, which had no place in it and no hope in it for
_her_. But she could have overcome that terror--she could have
resigned herself to that doom.
<P>
No! it was not the fear of the confession itself, or the fear of
the consequences which must follow it, that still held her
silent. The horror that daunted her was the horror of owning to
Horace and to Lady Janet that she had cheated them out of their
love.
<P>
Every day Lady Janet was kinder and kinder. Every day Horace was
fonder and fonder of her. How could she confess to Lady Janet?
how could she own to Horace that she had imposed upon him? "I
can't do it. They are so good to me--I can't do it!" In that
hopeless way it had ended during the seven days that had gone by.
In that hopeless way it ended again now.
<P>
<P>
<P>
The murmur of the two voices at the further end of the
conservatory ceased. The billiard-room door opened again slowly,
by an inch at a time.
<P>
Mercy still kept her place, unconscious of the events that were
passing round her. Sinking under the hard stress laid on it, her
mind had drifted little by little into a new train of thought.
For the first time she found the courage to question the future
in a new way. Supposing her confession to have been made, or
supposing the woman whom she had personated to have discovered
the means of exposing the fraud, what advantage, she now asked
herself, would Miss Roseberry derive from Mercy Merrick's
disgrace?
<P>
Could Lady Janet transfer to the woman who was really her
relative by marriage the affection which she had given to the
woman who had pretended to be her relative? No! All the right in
the world would not put the true Grace into the false Grace's
vacant place. The qualities by which Mercy had won Lady Janet's
love were the qualities which were Mercy's won. Lady Janet could
do rigid justice--but hers was not the heart to give itself to a
stranger (and to give itself unreservedly) a second time. Grace
Roseberry would be formally acknowledged--and there it would end.
<P>
Was there hope in this new view?
<P>
Yes! There was the false hope of making the inevitable atonement
by some other means than by the confession of the fraud.
<P>
What had Grace Roseberry actually lost by the wrong done to her?
She had lost the salary of Lady Janet's "companion and reader."
Say that she wanted money, Mercy had her savings from the
generous allowance made to her by Lady Janet; Mercy could offer
money. Or say that she wanted employment, Mercy's interest with
Lady Janet could offer employment, could offer anything Grace
might ask for, if she would only come to terms.
<P>
Invigorated by the new hope, Mercy rose excitedly, weary of
inaction in the empty room. She, who but a few minutes since had
shuddered at the thought of their meeting again, was now eager to
devise a means of finding her way privately to an interview with
Grace. It should be done without loss of time--on that very day,
if possible; by the next day at latest. She looked round her
mechanically, pondering how to reach the end in view. Her eyes
rested by chance on the door of the billiard-room.
<P>
Was it fancy? or did she really see the door first open a little,
then suddenly and softly close again?
<P>
Was it fancy? or did she really hear, at the same moment, a sound
behind her as of persons speaking in the conservatory?
<P>
She paused; and, looking back in that direction, listened
intently. The sound--if she had really heard it--was no longer
audible. She advanced toward the billiard-room to set her first
doubt at rest. She stretched out her hand to open the door, when
the voices (recognizable now as the voices of two men) caught her
ear once more.
<P>
This time she was able to distinguish the words that were spoken.
<P>
"Any further orders, sir?" inquired one of the men.
<P>
"Nothing more," replied the other.
<P>
Mercy started, and faintly flushed, as the second voice answered
the first. She stood irresolute close to the billiard-room,
hesitating what to do next.
<P>
After an interval the second voice made itself heard again,
advancing nearer to the dining-room: "Are you there, aunt?" it
asked cautiously. There was a moment's pause. Then the voice
spoke for the third time, sounding louder and nearer. "Are you
there?" it reiterated; "I have something to tell you." Mercy
summoned her resolution and answered: "Lady Janet is not here."
She turned as she spoke toward the conservatory door, and
confronted on the threshold Julian Gray.
<P>
They looked at one another without exchanging a word on either
side. The situation--for widely different reasons--was equally
embarrassing to both of them.
<P>
There--as Julian saw _her_--was the woman forbidden to him, the
woman whom he loved.
<P>
There--as Mercy saw _him_--was the man whom she dreaded, the man
whose actions (as she interpreted them) proved that he suspected
her.
<P>
On the surface of it, the incidents which had marked their first
meeting were now exactly repeated, with the one difference that
the impulse to withdraw this time appeared to be on the man's
side and not on the woman's. It was Mercy who spoke first.
<P>
"Did you expect to find Lady Janet here?" she asked,
constrainedly. He answered, on his part, more constrainedly
still.
<P>
"It doesn't matter," he said. "Another time will do."
<P>
He drew back as he made the reply. She advanced desperately, with
the deliberate intention of detaining him by speaking again.
<P>
The attempt which he had made to withdraw, the constraint in his
manner when he had answered, had instantly confirmed her in the
false conviction that he, and he alone, had guessed the truth! If
she was right--if he had secretly made discoveries abroad which
placed her entirely at his mercy--the attempt to induce Grace to
consent to a compromise with her would be manifestly useless. Her
first and foremost interest now was to find out how she really
stood in the estimation of Julian Gray. In a terror of suspense,
that turned her cold from head to foot, she stopped him on his
way out, and spoke to him with the piteous counterfeit of a
smile.
<P>
"Lady Janet is receiving some visitors," she said. "If you will
wait here, she will be back directly."
<P>
The effort of hiding her agitation from him had brought a passing
color into her cheeks. Worn and wasted as she was, the spell of
her beauty was strong enough to hold him against his own will.
All he had to tell Lady Janet was that he had met one of the
gardeners in the conservatory, and had cautioned him as well as
the lodge-keeper. It would have been easy to write this, and to
send the note to his aunt on quitting the house. For the sake of
his own peace of mind, for the sake of his duty to Horace, he was
doubly bound to make the first polite excuse that occurred to
him, and to leave her as he had found her, alone in the room. He
made the attempt, and hesitated. Despising himself for doing it,
he allowed himself to look at her. Their eyes met. Julian stepped
into the dining-room.
<P>
"If I am not in the way," he said, confusedly, "I will wait, as
you kindly propose."
<P>
She noticed his embarrassment; she saw that he was strongly
restraining himself from looking at her again. Her own eyes
dropped to the ground as she made the discovery. Her speech
failed her; her heart throbbed faster and faster.
<P>
"If I look at him again" (was the thought in _her_ mind) "I shall
fall at his feet and tell him all that I have done!"
<P>
"If I look at her again" (was the thought in _his_ mind) "I shall
fall at her feet and own that I am in love with her!"
<P>
With downcast eyes he placed a chair for her. With downcast eyes
she bowed to him and took it. A dead silence followed. Never was
any human misunderstanding more intricately complete than the
misunderstanding which had now established itself between those
two.
<P>
Mercy's work-basket was near her. She took it, and gained time
for composing herself by pretending to arrange the colored wools.
He stood behind her chair, looking at the graceful turn of her
head, looking at the rich masses of her hair. He reviled himself
as the weakest of men, as the falsest of friends, for still
remaining near her--and yet he remained.
<P>
The silence continued. The billiard-room door opened again
noiselessly. The face of the listening woman appeared stealthily
behind it.
<P>
At the same moment Mercy roused herself and spoke: "Won't you sit
down?" she said, softly, still not looking round at him, still
busy with her basket of wools.
<P>
He turned to get a chair--turned so quickly that he saw the
billiard-room door move, as Grace Roseberry closed it again.
<P>
"Is there any one in that room?" he asked, addressing Mercy.
<P>
"I don't know," she answered. "I thought I saw the door open and
shut again a little while ago."
<P>
He advanced at once to look into the room. As he did so Mercy
dropped one of her balls of wool. He stopped to pick it up for
her--then threw open the door and looked into the billiard-room.
It was empty.
<P>
Had some person been listening, and had that person retreated in
time to escape discovery? The open door of the smoking-room
showed that room also to be empty. A third door was open--the
door of the side hall, leading into the grounds. Julian closed
and locked it, and returned to the dining-room.
<P>
"I can only suppose," he said to Mercy, "that the billiard-room
door was not properly shut, and that the draught of air from the
hall must have moved it."
<P>
She accepted the explanation in silence. He was, to all
appearance, not quite satisfied with it himself. For a moment or
two he looked about him uneasily. Then the old fascination
fastened its hold on him again. Once more he looked at the
graceful turn of her head, at the rich masses of her hair. The
courage to put the critical question to him, now that she had
lured him into remaining in the room, was still a courage that
failed her. She remained as busy as ever with her work--too busy
to look at him; too busy to speak to him. The silence became
unendurable. He broke it by making a commonplace inquiry after
her health. "I am well enough to be ashamed of the anxiety I have
caused and the trouble I have given," she answered. "To-day I
have got downstairs for the first time. I am trying to do a
little work." She looked into the basket. The various specimens
of wool in it were partly in balls and partly in loose skeins.
The skeins were mixed and tangled. "Here is sad confusion!" she
exclaimed, timidly, with a faint smile. "How am I to set it right
again?"
<P>
"Let me help you," said Julian.
<P>
"You!"
<P>
"Why not?" he asked, with a momentary return of the quaint humor
which she remembered so well. "You forget that I am a curate.
Curates are privileged to make themselves useful to young ladies.
Let me try."
<P>
He took a stool at her feet, and set himself to unravel one of
the tangled skeins. In a minute the wool was stretched on his
hands, and the loose end was ready for Mercy to wind. There was
something in the trivial action, and in the homely attention that
it implied, which in some degree quieted her fear of him. She
began to roll the wool off his hands into a ball. Thus occupied,
she said the daring words which were to lead him little by little
into betraying his suspicions, if he did indeed suspect the
truth.
