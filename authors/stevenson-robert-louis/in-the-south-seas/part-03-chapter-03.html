<p>When we left the palace we were still but seafarers ashore; and within
the hour we had installed our goods in one of the six foreign houses of
Butaritari, namely, that usually occupied by Maka, the Hawaiian
missionary.  Two San Francisco firms are here established, Messrs.
Crawford and Messrs. Wightman Brothers; the first hard by the palace of
the mid town, the second at the north entry; each with a store and
bar-room.  Our house was in the Wightman compound, betwixt the store and
bar, within a fenced enclosure.  Across the road a few native houses
nestled in the margin of the bush, and the green wall of palms rose
solid, shutting out the breeze.  A little sandy cove of the lagoon ran in
behind, sheltered by a verandah pier, the labour of queens’ hands.  Here,
when the tide was high, sailed boats lay to be loaded; when the tide was
low, the boats took ground some half a mile away, and an endless series
of natives descended the pier stair, tailed across the sand in strings
and clusters, waded to the waist with the bags of copra, and loitered
backward to renew their charge.  The mystery of the copra trade tormented
me, as I sat and watched the profits drip on the stair and the sands.
</p>
<p>In front, from shortly after four in the morning until nine at night, the
folk of the town streamed by us intermittingly along the road: families
going up the island to make copra on their lands; women bound for the
bush to gather flowers against the evening toilet; and, twice a day, the
toddy-cutters, each with his knife and shell.  In the first grey of the
morning, and again late in the afternoon, these would straggle past about
their tree-top business, strike off here and there into the bush, and
vanish from the face of the earth.  At about the same hour, if the tide
be low in the lagoon, you are likely to be bound yourself across the
island for a bath, and may enter close at their heels alleys of the palm
wood.  Right in front, although the sun is not yet risen, the east is
already lighted with preparatory fires, and the huge accumulations of the
trade-wind cloud glow with and heliograph the coming day.  The breeze is
in your face; overhead in the tops of the palms, its playthings, it
maintains a lively bustle; look where you will, above or below, there is
no human presence, only the earth and shaken forest.  And right overhead
the song of an invisible singer breaks from the thick leaves; from
farther on a second tree-top answers; and beyond again, in the bosom of
the woods, a still more distant minstrel perches and sways and sings.
So, all round the isle, the toddy-cutters sit on high, and are rocked by
the trade, and have a view far to seaward, where they keep watch for
sails, and like huge birds utter their songs in the morning.  They sing
with a certain lustiness and Bacchic glee; the volume of sound and the
articulate melody fall unexpected from the tree-top, whence we anticipate
the chattering of fowls.  And yet in a sense these songs also are but
chatter; the words are ancient, obsolete, and sacred; few comprehend
them, perhaps no one perfectly; but it was understood the cutters ‘prayed
to have good toddy, and sang of their old wars.’  The prayer is at least
answered; and when the foaming shell is brought to your door, you have a
beverage well ‘worthy of a grace.’  All forenoon you may return and
taste; it only sparkles, and sharpens, and grows to be a new drink, not
less delicious; but with the progress of the day the fermentation
quickens and grows acid; in twelve hours it will be yeast for bread, in
two days more a devilish intoxicant, the counsellor of crime.
</p><p>The men are of a marked Arabian cast of features, often bearded and
mustached, often gaily dressed, some with bracelets and anklets, all
stalking hidalgo-like, and accepting salutations with a haughty lip.  The
hair (with the dandies of either sex) is worn turban-wise in a frizzled
bush; and like the daggers of the Japanese a pointed stick (used for a
comb) is thrust gallantly among the curls.  The women from this bush of
hair look forth enticingly: the race cannot be compared with the Tahitian
for female beauty; I doubt even if the average be high; but some of the
prettiest girls, and one of the handsomest women I ever saw, were
Gilbertines.  Butaritari, being the commercial centre of the group, is
Europeanised; the coloured sacque or the white shift are common wear, the
latter for the evening; the trade hat, loaded with flowers, fruit, and
ribbons, is unfortunately not unknown; and the characteristic female
dress of the Gilberts no longer universal.  The <u>ridi</u> is its name: a
cutty petticoat or fringe of the smoked fibre of cocoa-nut leaf, not
unlike tarry string: the lower edge not reaching the mid-thigh, the upper
adjusted so low upon the haunches that it seems to cling by accident.  A
sneeze, you think, and the lady must surely be left destitute.  ‘The
perilous, hairbreadth ridi’ was our word for it; and in the conflict that
rages over women’s dress it has the misfortune to please neither side,
the prudish condemning it as insufficient, the more frivolous finding it
unlovely in itself.  Yet if a pretty Gilbertine would look her best, that
must be her costume.  In that and naked otherwise, she moves with an
incomparable liberty and grace and life, that marks the poetry of
Micronesia.  Bundle her in a gown, the charm is fled, and she wriggles
like an Englishwoman.
</p><p>Towards dusk the passers-by became more gorgeous.  The men broke out in
all the colours of the rainbow—or at least of the trade-room,—and both
men and women began to be adorned and scented with new flowers.  A small
white blossom is the favourite, sometimes sown singly in a woman’s hair
like little stars, now composed in a thick wreath.  With the night, the
crowd sometimes thickened in the road, and the padding and brushing of
bare feet became continuous; the promenades mostly grave, the silence
only interrupted by some giggling and scampering of girls; even the
children quiet.  At nine, bed-time struck on a bell from the cathedral,
and the life of the town ceased.  At four the next morning the signal is
repeated in the darkness, and the innocent prisoners set free; but for
seven hours all must lie—I was about to say within doors, of a place
where doors, and even walls, are an exception—housed, at least, under
their airy roofs and clustered in the tents of the mosquito-nets.
Suppose a necessary errand to occur, suppose it imperative to send
abroad, the messenger must then go openly, advertising himself to the
police with a huge brand of cocoa-nut, which flares from house to house
like a moving bonfire.  Only the police themselves go darkling, and grope
in the night for misdemeanants.  I used to hate their treacherous
presence; their captain in particular, a crafty old man in white, lurked
nightly about my premises till I could have found it in my heart to beat
him.  But the rogue was privileged.
</p><p>Not one of the eleven resident traders came to town, no captain cast
anchor in the lagoon, but we saw him ere the hour was out.  This was
owing to our position between the store and the bar—the <u>Sans Souci</u>, as
the last was called.  Mr. Rick was not only Messrs. Wightman’s manager,
but consular agent for the States; Mrs. Rick was the only white woman on
the island, and one of the only two in the archipelago; their house
besides, with its cool verandahs, its bookshelves, its comfortable
furniture, could not be rivalled nearer than Jaluit or Honolulu.  Every
one called in consequence, save such as might be prosecuting a South Sea
quarrel, hingeing on the price of copra and the odd cent, or perhaps a
difference about poultry.  Even these, if they did not appear upon the
north, would be presently visible to the southward, the <u>Sans Souci</u>
drawing them as with cords.  In an island with a total population of
twelve white persons, one of the two drinking-shops might seem
superfluous: but every bullet has its billet, and the double
accommodation of Butaritari is found in practice highly convenient by the
captains and the crews of ships: <u>The Land we Live in</u> being tacitly
resigned to the forecastle, the <u>Sans Souci</u> tacitly reserved for the
afterguard.  So aristocratic were my habits, so commanding was my fear of
Mr. Williams, that I have never visited the first; but in the other,
which was the club or rather the casino of the island, I regularly passed
my evenings.  It was small, but neatly fitted, and at night (when the
lamp was lit) sparkled with glass and glowed with coloured pictures like
a theatre at Christmas.  The pictures were advertisements, the glass
coarse enough, the carpentry amateur; but the effect, in that incongruous
isle, was of unbridled luxury and inestimable expense.  Here songs were
sung, tales told, tricks performed, games played.  The Ricks, ourselves,
Norwegian Tom the bar-keeper, a captain or two from the ships, and
perhaps three or four traders come down the island in their boats or by
the road on foot, made up the usual company.  The traders, all bred to
the sea, take a humorous pride in their new business; ‘South Sea
Merchants’ is the title they prefer.  ‘We are all sailors
here’—‘Merchants, if you please’—‘<u>South Sea</u> Merchants,’—was a piece of
conversation endlessly repeated, that never seemed to lose in savour.  We
found them at all times simple, genial, gay, gallant, and obliging; and,
across some interval of time, recall with pleasure the traders of
Butaritari.  There was one black sheep indeed.  I tell of him here where
he lived, against my rule; for in this case I have no measure to
preserve, and the man is typical of a class of ruffians that once
disgraced the whole field of the South Seas, and still linger in the
rarely visited isles of Micronesia.  He had the name on the beach of ‘a
perfect gentleman when sober,’ but I never saw him otherwise than drunk.
The few shocking and savage traits of the Micronesian he has singled out
with the skill of a collector, and planted in the soil of his original
baseness.  He has been accused and acquitted of a treacherous murder; and
has since boastfully owned it, which inclines me to suppose him innocent.
His daughter is defaced by his erroneous cruelty, for it was his wife he
had intended to disfigure, and in the darkness of the night and the
frenzy of coco-brandy, fastened on the wrong victim.  The wife has since
fled and harbours in the bush with natives; and the husband still demands
from deaf ears her forcible restoration.  The best of his business is to
make natives drink, and then advance the money for the fine upon a
lucrative mortgage.  ‘Respect for whites’ is the man’s word: ‘What is the
matter with this island is the want of respect for whites.’  On his way
to Butaritari, while I was there, he spied his wife in the bush with
certain natives and made a dash to capture her; whereupon one of her
companions drew a knife and the husband retreated: ‘Do you call that
proper respect for whites?’ he cried.  At an early stage of the
acquaintance we proved our respect for his kind of white by forbidding
him our enclosure under pain of death.  Thenceforth he lingered often in
the neighbourhood with I knew not what sense of envy or design of
mischief; his white, handsome face (which I beheld with loathing) looked
in upon us at all hours across the fence; and once, from a safe distance,
he avenged himself by shouting a recondite island insult, to us quite
inoffensive, on his English lips incredibly incongruous.
</p><p>Our enclosure, round which this composite of degradations wandered, was
of some extent.  In one corner was a trellis with a long table of rough
boards.  Here the Fourth of July feast had been held not long before with
memorable consequences, yet to be set forth; here we took our meals; here
entertained to a dinner the king and notables of Makin.  In the midst was
the house, with a verandah front and back, and three is rooms within.  In
the verandah we slung our man-of-war hammocks, worked there by day, and
slept at night.  Within were beds, chairs, a round table, a fine hanging
lamp, and portraits of the royal family of Hawaii.  Queen Victoria proves
nothing; Kalakaua and Mrs. Bishop are diagnostic; and the truth is we
were the stealthy tenants of the parsonage.  On the day of our arrival
Maka was away; faithless trustees unlocked his doors; and the dear
rigorous man, the sworn foe of liquor and tobacco, returned to find his
verandah littered with cigarettes and his parlour horrible with bottles.
He made but one condition—on the round table, which he used in the
celebration of the sacraments, he begged us to refrain from setting
liquor; in all else he bowed to the accomplished fact, refused rent,
retired across the way into a native house, and, plying in his boat, beat
the remotest quarters of the isle for provender.  He found us pigs—I
could not fancy where—no other pigs were visible; he brought us fowls and
taro; when we gave our feast to the monarch and gentry, it was he who
supplied the wherewithal, he who superintended the cooking, he who asked
grace at table, and when the king’s health was proposed, he also started
the cheering with an English hip-hip-hip.  There was never a more
fortunate conception; the heart of the fatted king exulted in his bosom
at the sound.
</p><p>Take him for all in all, I have never known a more engaging creature than
this parson of Butaritari: his mirth, his kindness, his noble, friendly
feelings, brimmed from the man in speech and gesture.  He loved to
exaggerate, to act and overact the momentary part, to exercise his lungs
and muscles, and to speak and laugh with his whole body.  He had the
morning cheerfulness of birds and healthy children; and his humour was
infectious.  We were next neighbours and met daily, yet our salutations
lasted minutes at a stretch—shaking hands, slapping shoulders, capering
like a pair of Merry-Andrews, laughing to split our sides upon some
pleasantry that would scarce raise a titter in an infant-school.  It
might be five in the morning, the toddy-cutters just gone by, the road
empty, the shade of the island lying far on the lagoon: and the
ebullition cheered me for the day.
</p><p>Yet I always suspected Maka of a secret melancholy—these jubilant
extremes could scarce be constantly maintained.  He was besides long, and
lean, and lined, and corded, and a trifle grizzled; and his Sabbath
countenance was even saturnine.  On that day we made a procession to the
church, or (as I must always call it) the cathedral: Maka (a blot on the
hot landscape) in tall hat, black frock-coat, black trousers; under his
arm the hymn-book and the Bible; in his face, a reverent gravity:—beside
him Mary his wife, a quiet, wise, and handsome elderly lady, seriously
attired:—myself following with singular and moving thoughts.  Long
before, to the sound of bells and streams and birds, through a green
Lothian glen, I had accompanied Sunday by Sunday a minister in whose
house I lodged; and the likeness, and the difference, and the series of
years and deaths, profoundly touched me.  In the great, dusky, palm-tree
cathedral the congregation rarely numbered thirty: the men on one side,
the women on the other, myself posted (for a privilege) amongst the
women, and the small missionary contingent gathered close around the
platform, we were lost in that round vault.  The lessons were read
antiphonally, the flock was catechised, a blind youth repeated weekly a
long string of psalms, hymns were sung—I never heard worse singing,—and
the sermon followed.  To say I understood nothing were untrue; there were
points that I learned to expect with certainty; the name of Honolulu,
that of Kalakaua, the word Cap’n-man-o’-wa’, the word ship, and a
description of a storm at sea, infallibly occurred; and I was not seldom
rewarded with the name of my own Sovereign in the bargain.  The rest was
but sound to the ears, silence for the mind: a plain expanse of tedium,
rendered unbearable by heat, a hard chair, and the sight through the wide
doors of the more happy heathen on the green.  Sleep breathed on my
joints and eyelids, sleep hummed in my ears; it reigned in the dim
cathedral.  The congregation stirred and stretched; they moaned, they
groaned aloud; they yawned upon a singing note, as you may sometimes hear
a dog when he has reached the tragic bitterest of boredom.  In vain the
preacher thumped the table; in vain he singled and addressed by name
particular hearers.  I was myself perhaps a more effective excitant; and
at least to one old gentleman the spectacle of my successful struggles
against sleep—and I hope they were successful—cheered the flight of time.
He, when he was not catching flies or playing tricks upon his neighbours,
gloated with a fixed, truculent eye upon the stages of my agony; and
once, when the service was drawing towards a close, he winked at me
across the church.
</p><p>I write of the service with a smile; yet I was always there—always with
respect for Maka, always with admiration for his deep seriousness, his
burning energy, the fire of his roused eye, the sincere and various
accents of his voice.  To see him weekly flogging a dead horse and
blowing a cold fire was a lesson in fortitude and constancy.  It may be a
question whether if the mission were fully supported, and he was set free
from business avocations, more might not result; I think otherwise
myself; I think not neglect but rigour has reduced his flock, that rigour
which has once provoked a revolution, and which to-day, in a man so
lively and engaging, amazes the beholder.  No song, no dance, no tobacco,
no liquor, no alleviative of life—only toil and church-going; so says a
voice from his face; and the face is the face of the Polynesian Esau, but
the voice is the voice of a Jacob from a different world.  And a
Polynesian at the best makes a singular missionary in the Gilberts,
coming from a country recklessly unchaste to one conspicuously strict;
from a race hag-ridden with bogies to one comparatively bold against the
terrors of the dark.  The thought was stamped one morning in my mind,
when I chanced to be abroad by moonlight, and saw all the town lightless,
but the lamp faithfully burning by the missionary’s bed.  It requires no
law, no fire, and no scouting police, to withhold Maka and his countrymen
from wandering in the night unlighted.
