<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The first thing I noted, on opening my eyes, was that Castro
had gone already; I was annoyed. He might have called me. However,
we had arranged everything the evening before. The broad day,
penetrating through the passage, diffused a semicircle of twilight
over the flooring. It extended as far as the emplacement of the
fire, black and cold now with a gray heap of ashes in the middle.
Farther away in the darkness, beyond the reach of light, Seraphina
on her bed of leaves did not stir. But what was that hat doing
there? Castro's hat. It asserted its existence more than it ever
did on the head of its master; black and rusty, like a battered
cone of iron, reposing on a wide flange near the ashes. Then he
was not gone. He would not start to walk three leagues, bare-headed.
He would appear presently; and I waited, vexed at the loss of
time. But he did not appear. "Castro," I cried in an undertone.
The leaves rustled; Seraphina sat up.</p>

<p>We were pleased to be with each other in an inexpugnable retreat,
to hear our voices untinged by anxiety; and, going to the outer
end of the short passage, we breathed with joy the pure air. The
tops of the bushes below glittered with drops of rain, the sky
was clear, and the sun, to us invisible, struck full upon the
face of the rock on the other side of the ravine. A great bird
soared, all was light and silence, and we forgot Castro for a
time. I threw my legs over the sill, and sitting on the stone
surveyed the cornice. The bright day robbed the ravine of half
its horrors. The path was rather broad, though there was a frightful
sheer drop of ninety feet at least. Two men could have walked
abreast on that ledge, and with a hand-rail one would have thought
nothing of it. The most dangerous part yet was at the entrance,
where it ended in a rounded projection not quite so wide as the
rest. I bantered Seraphina as to going out. She said she was ready.
She would shut her eyes, and take hold of my hand. Englishmen,
she had heard, were good at climbing. Their heads were steady.
Then we became silent. There were no signs of Castro. Where could
he have gone? What could he be doing? It was unimaginable.</p>

<p>I grew nervous with anxiety at last, and begged Seraphina to
go in. She obeyed without a word, and I remained just within the
entrance, watching. I had no means to tell the time, but it seemed
to me that an hour or two passed. Hadn't we better, I thought,
start at once on foot for the <em>hacienda?</em> I did not know
the way, but by descending the ravine again to the sea, and walking
along the bank of the little river, I was sure to reach it. The
objection to this was that we should miss Castro. Hang Castro!
And yet there was something mysterious and threatening in his
absence. Could he&mdash;could he have stepped out for some reason in
the dark, perhaps, and tumbled off the cornice? I had seen no
traces of a slip&mdash;there would be none on the rock; the twigs of
the growth below the edge would spring back, of course. But why
should he fall? The footing was good&mdash;however, a sudden attack
of vertigo.... I tried to look at it from every side. He was not
a somnambulist, as far as I knew. And there was nothing to eat
&mdash;I felt hungry already&mdash;or drink. The want of water would
drive us out very soon to the spring bubbling out at the head
of the ravine, a mile in the open. Then why not go at once, drink,
and return to our lair as quickly as possible?</p>

<p>But I did not like to think of her going up and down the cornice.
I remembered that we had a flask, and went in hastily to look
for it. First, I looked near the hat; then, Seraphina and I, bent
double with our eyes on the ground examined every square inch
of twilight; we even wandered a long way into the darkness, feeling
about with our hands. It was useless! I called out to her, and
then we desisted, and coming together, wondered what might have
become of the thing. He had taken it&mdash;that was clear.</p>

<p>But if, as one might suppose, he had taken it away to get some
water for us, he ought to have been back long before. I was beginning
to feel rather alarmed, and I tried to consider what we had better
do. It was necessary to learn, first, what had become of him.
Staring out of the opening, in my perplexity, I saw, on the other
side of the ravine, the lower part of a man from his waist to
his feet.</p>

<p>By crouching down at once, I brought his head into view. This
was not Castro. He wore a black sombrero, and on his shoulder
carried a gun. He turned his back on the ravine, and began to
walk straight away, sinking from my sight till only his hat and
shoulders remained visible. He lifted his arm then&mdash;straight up&mdash;evidently
as a signal, and waited. Presently another head and shoulders
joined him, and they glided across my line of sight together.
But I had recognized their bandit-like aspect with infinite consternation.
<em>Lu-garenos!</em></p>

<p>I caught Seraphina's hand. My first thought was that we should
have to steal out of the cavern with the first coming of darkness.
Castro must be lying low in hiding somewhere above. The thing
was plain. We must try to make our way to the <em>hacienda</em>
under the cover of the night, unseen by those two men. Evidently
they were emissaries sent from Rio Medio to watch this part of
the coast against our possible landing. I was to be hunted down,
it seems: and I reproached myself bitterly with the hardships
I was bringing upon her continually. Thinking of the fatigues
she had undergone&mdash;(I did not think of dangers&mdash;that was another
thing&mdash;the romance of dying together like all the lovers in the
tradition of the world) &mdash;I shook with rage and exasperation.
The firm pressure of her hands calmed me. She was content. But
what if they took it into their heads to come into the cavern?</p>

<p>The emptiness of the blue sky above the sheer yellow rock opposite
was frightful. It was a mere strip, stretched like a luminous
bandage over our eyes. They were, perhaps, even now on their way
round the head of the ravine. I had no weapon except the butt
of my pistol. The charges had been spoilt by the salt water, of
course, and I had been tempted to fling it out of my belt, but
for the thought of obtaining some powder somewhere. And those
men I had seen were armed. At once we abandoned the neighbourhood
of the entrance, plunging straight away into the profound obscurity
of the cave. The rocky ground under our feet had a gentle slope,
then dipped so sharply as to surprise us; and the entrance, diminishing
at our backs, shone at last no larger than the entrance of a mouse-hole.
We made a few steps more, gropingly. The bead of light disappeared
altogether when we sat down, and we remained there hand-in-hand
and silent, like two frightened children placed at the centre
of the earth. There was not a sound, not a gleam. Sera-phina bore
the crushing strain of this perfect and black stillness in an
almost heroic immobility; but, as to me, it seemed to lie upon
my limbs, to embarrass my breathing like a numbness full of dread;
and to shake that feeling off I jumped up repeatedly to look at
that luminous bead, that point of light no bigger than a pearl
in the infinity of darkness. And once, just as I was looking,
it shut and opened at me slowly, like the deliberate drooping
and rising of the lid upon a white eyeball.</p>

<p>Somebody had come in.</p>

<p>We watched side by side. Only one. Would he go out? The point
of light, like a white star setting in a coal-black firmament,
remained uneclipsed. Whoever had entered was in no haste to leave.
Moreover, we had no means of telling what another obscuring of
the light might mean; a departure or another arrival. There were
two men about, as we knew; and it was even possible that they
had entered together in one wink of the light, treading close
upon each other's heels. We both felt the sudden great desire
to know for certain. But, especially, we needed to find out if
perchance this was not Castro who had returned. We could not afford
to lose his assistance. And should he conclude, we were out&mdash;should
he risk himself outside again, in order to find us and be discovered
himself, and thus lost to us when we felt him so necessary? And
the doubt came. If this man was Castro, why didn't he penetrate
further, and shout our names? He ought to have been intelligent
enough to guess.... And it was this doubt that, making suspense
intolerable, put us in motion.</p>

<p>We circled widely in that subterranean darkness, which, unlike
the darkest night on the surface of the earth, had no suggestion
of shape, no horizon, and seemed to have no more limit than the
darkness of infinite space. On this floor of solid rock we moved
with noiseless steps, like a pair of timid phantoms. The spot
of light grew in size, developed a shape&mdash;stretching from a pearly
bead to a silvery thread; and, approaching from the side, we scanned
from afar the circumscribed region of twilight about the opening.
There was a man in it. We contemplated for a time his rounded
back, his drooping head. It was gray. The man was Castro. He sat
rocking himself sorrowfully over the ashes. He was mourning for
us. We were touched by this silent faithfulness of grief.</p>

<p>He started when I put my hand on his shoulder, looked up, then,
instead of giving any signs of joy, dropped his head again.</p>

<p>"You managed to avoid them, Castro?" I said.</p>

<p>"Se√±or, behold. Here I am. I, Castro."</p>

<p>His tone was gloomy, and after sitting still for a while under
our gaze, he slapped his forehead violently. He was in his tantrums,
I judged, and, as usual, angry with me&mdash;the cause of every misfortune.
He was upset and annoyed beyond reason, as I thought, by this
new difficulty. It meant delay&mdash;a certain measure of that sort
of danger of which we had thought ourselves free for a time&mdash;night
travelling for Seraphina. But I had an idea to save her this.
We did not all want to go. Castro could start, alone, for the
<em>hacienda</em> after dark, and bring, besides the mules, half
a dozen peons with him for an escort. There was nothing really
to get so upset about. The danger would have been if he had let
himself be caught. But he had not. As to his temper, I knew my
man; he had been amiable too long. But by this time we were so
sure of his truculent devotion that Seraphina spoke gently to
him, saying how anxious we had been&mdash;how glad we were to see him
safe with us.... He would not be conciliated easily, it seemed,
and let out only a blood-curdling dismal groan. Without looking
at her, he tried hastily to make a cigarette. He was very clever
at it generally, rolling it with one hand on his knee somehow;
but this time all his limbs seemed to shake, he lost several pinches
of tobacco, dropped the piece of maize leaf. Seraphina, stooping
over his shoulder, took it up, twisted the thing swiftly. "Take,
<em>amigo</em>," she said.</p>

<p>He was looking up at her, as if struck dumb, roiling his eye
wildly. He jumped up.</p>

<p>"You &mdash;Se√±orita! For a miserable old man! You break my heart."</p>

<p>And with long strides he disappeared in the darkness, leaving
us wondering.</p>

<p>We sat side by side on the couch of leaves. With Castro there
I felt we were quite equal to dealing with the two Lugare√±os if
they had the unlucky idea of intruding upon us. Indeed, a vigilant
man, posted on one side of the end of the passage, could have
disputed the entrance against ten, twenty, almost any number,
as long as he kept his strength and had something heavy enough
to knock them over. Faint sounds reached me, as if at a great
distance Castro had been shouting to himself. I called to him.
He did not answer, but unexpectedly his short person showed itself
in the brightest part of the light.</p>

<p>"Se√±or!" he called out with a strange intonation. I got up and
went to him. He seemed to be listening intently with his ear turned
to the opening. Then suddenly:</p>

<p>"Look at me, Se√±or. Am I Castro&mdash;the same Castro? old and friendless?"</p>

<p>He stood biting his forefinger and looking up at me from under
his knitted eyebrows. I didn't know what to say. What was this
nonsense?</p>

<p>He ejaculated a sort of incomprehensible babble, and, passing
by me, rushed towards Seraphina; she sat up, startled, on her
couch of leaves. Falling before her on his plump knees, he seized
her hand, pressed it against his ragged moustache.</p>

<p>"Excellency, forgive me! No&mdash;no forgiveness! Ha! old man! Ha&mdash;thou
old man...."</p>

<p>He bowed before her shadowy figure, that sustained the pale oval
of the face, till his forehead struck the rock. Plunging his hand
into the ashes, he poured a fistful with inarticulate low cries
over his gray hairs; and the agitation of that obese little body
on its knees had a lamentable and grotesque inconsequence, as
inexplicable in itself as the sorrow of a madman. Full of wonder
before his abject collapse, she murmured:</p>

<p>"What have you done?"</p>

<p>He tried to fling himself upon her feet, but my hand was in his
collar, and after an unmerciful shaking, I sat him down by main
force. He gulped, blinked the whites of his eyes, then, in a whisper
full of rage:</p>

<p>"Horror, shame, misery, and malediction; I have betrayed you."</p>

<p>At once she said soothingly, "Tomasr I do not believe this";
while I thought to myself: How? Why? For what reason? In what
manner betrayed? How was it possible? And, if so, why did he come
back to us? But, as things stood, he would never dare approach
a Lugare√±o. If he had, they would never have let him go again.</p>

<p>"You told them we were here?" I asked, so perfectly incredulous
that I was not at all surprised to hear him protest, by all the
saints, that he never did&mdash;never would do. Never. Never.... But
why should he? Was he the prey of some strange hallucination?
Rocking himself, he struck his breast with his clenched hand,
then suddenly caught at his hair and remained perfectly motionless.
Minutes passed; this despairing stillness inspired in me a feeling
of awe at last&mdash;the awe of something inconceivable. My head buzzed
so with the effort to think that I had the illusions of faint
murmurs in the cave, the very shadows of murmurs. And all at once
a real voice&mdash;his voice&mdash;burst out fearfully rapid and voluble.</p>

<p>He had really gone out to get a provision of water. Waking up
early, he saw us sleeping, and felt a great pity for the senorita.
As to the <em>caballero</em>&mdash;his saviour from drowning, alas!&mdash;the
senorita would need every ounce of his strength. He would let
us sleep till his return from the spring; and, there being a blessed
freshness in the air, he caught up the flask and started bare-headed.
The sun had just risen. Would to God he had never seen it! After
plunging his face in the running water, he remained on his knees
and busied himself in rinsing and filling the flask. The torrent,
gushing with force, made a loud noise, and after he had done screwing
the top on, he was about to rise, when, glancing about carelessly,
he saw two men leaning on their <em>escopetas</em> and looking
at him in perfect silence. They were standing right over him;
he knew them well; one they called El Rubio; the other, the little
one, was Jos√©&mdash;squinting Jos√©. They said nothing; nothing at all.
With a sudden and mighty effort he preserved his self-command,
affected unconcern and, instead of getting up, only shifted his
pose to a sitting position, took off his shoes and stockings,
and proceeded to bathe his feet. But it was as if a blazing fire
had been kindled in his breast, and a tornado had been blowing
in his head.</p>

<p>He could not tell whence these two had come, with what object,
or how much they knew. They might have been only messengers from
Rio Medio to Havana. They generally went in couples. If Manuel
had escaped alive out of the sea, everything was known in Rio
Medio. From where he sat he beheld the empty, open sea over the
dunes, but the edge of the upland, cleft by many ravines (of which
the one we had ascended was the deepest), concealed from him the
little basin and the inlet. He was certain these men had not come
up that way. They had approached him over the plain. But there
was more than one way by which the upland could be reached from
below. The thoughts rushed round and round his head. He remembered
that our boat must be floating or lying stranded in the little
bay, and resolved, in case of necessity, to say that we two were
dead, that we had been drowned.</p>

<p>It was El Rubio who put the very question to him, in an insolent
tone, and sitting on the ground out of his reach, with his gun
across his knees. His long knife ready in his hand, squinting
Jos√© remained standing over Castro. Those two men nodded to each
other significantly at the intelligence. He perceived that they
were more than half disposed to credit his story. They had nearly
been drowned themselves pursuing that accursed heretic of an Englishman.
When, from their remarks, he learned that the schooner was in
the bay, he began putting on his shoes, though the hope of making
a sudden dash for his life down the ravine abandoned him.</p>

<p>The schooner had been run in at night during the gale, and in
such distress that they let her take the ground. She was not injured,
however, and some of them were preparing to haul her off. Our
boat, as I conceived, after bumping along the beach, had drifted
within the influence of the current created by the little river,
or else by the water forced into the basin by the tempest, seeking
to escape, and had been carried out towards the inlet. She was
seen at daylight, knocking about amongst the breakers, bottom
up, and in such shallow water that three or four men wading out
knee-deep managed to turn her over. They had found Mrs. Williams'
woollen shawl and my cap floating underneath. At the same time
the broken mast and sail were made out, tossing upon the waves,
not very far off to seaward. That the boat had been in the bay
at all did not seem to have occurred to them. It had been concluded
that she had capsized outside the entrance. It was very possible
that we had been drowned under her. Castro hastened to confirm
the idea by relating how he had been clinging to the bottom of
the boat for a long time. Thus he had saved himself, he declared.</p>

<p>"Manuel will be glad," observed El Rubio then, with an evil laugh.
And for a long time nobody said a word.</p>

<p>El Rubio, cross-legged, was observing him with the eyes of a
basilisk, but Castro swore a great oath that, as to himself, he
showed no signs of fear. He looked at the water gushing from the
rock, bubbling up, sparkling, running away in a succession of
tiny leaps and falls. Why should he fear? Was he not old, and
tired, and without any hope of peace on earth? What was death?
Nothing. It was absolutely nothing. It comes to all. It was rest
after much vain trouble&mdash;and he trusted that, through his devotion
to the Mother of God, his sins would be forgiven after a short
time in purgatory. But, as he had made up his mind not to fall
into Manuel's hands, he resolved that presently he would stab
himself to the heart, where he sat&mdash;over this running water. For
it would not be like a suicide. He was doomed, and surely God
did not want his body to be tormented by such a devil as Manuel
before death.</p>

<p>He would lean far over before he struck his faithful blade into
his breast, so as to fall with his face in the water. It looked
deliciously cool, and the sun was heavy on his bare head. Suddenly,
El Rubio sprang to his feet, saying:</p>

<p>"Now, Jos√©."</p>

<p>It is clear that these ruffians stood in awe of his blade. In
their cowardly hearts they did not think it quite safe (being
only two to one) to try and disarm that old man. They backed away
a step or two, and, levelling their pieces, suddenly ordered him
to get up and walk before. He threw at them an obscene word. He
thought to himself, "<em>Bueno!</em> They will blow my head off
my shoulders." No emotion stirred in him, as if his blood had
already ceased to run in his veins. They remained, all three,
in a state of suspended animation, but at last El Rubio hissed
through his teeth with vexation, and grunted:</p>

<p>"Attention, Jos√©. Take aim. We will break his legs and take away
the sting of this old scorpion."</p>

<p>Castro's blood felt chilly in his limbs, but instead of planting
his knife in his breast, he spoke up to ask them where, supposing
he consented, they wished to conduct him.</p>

<p>"To Manuel&mdash;our captain. He would like to embrace you before
you die,"  said El Rubio, advancing a stride nearer, his gun to
his shoulder. "Get up! March!"</p>

<p>And Castro found himself on his feet, looking straight into the
black holes of the barrels.</p>

<p>"Walk!" they exclaimed together, stepping upon him.</p>

<p>The time had come to die.</p>

<p>"Ha! <em>Canalla!</em>" he said.</p>

<p>They made a menacing clamour, "Walk <em>viejo</em>, traitor;
walk."</p>

<p>"Se√±orita &mdash;I walked." The heartrending effort of the voice,
the trembling of this gray head, the sobs under the words, oppressed
our breast with dismay and dread. Ardently he would have us believe
that at this juncture he was thinking of us only&mdash;of us wondering,
alone, ignorant of danger, and hidden blindly under the earth.
His purpose was to provoke the two <em>Luga-re√±os</em> to shoot,
so that we should be warned by the reports. Besides, an opportunity
for escape might yet present itself in some most unlikely way,
perhaps at the very last moment. Had he not his own life in his
own hands? He cared not for it. It was in his power to end it
at any time. And there would be dense thickets on the way; long
grass where one could plunge suddenly&mdash;who knows! And overgrown
ravines where one could hide&mdash;creep under the bushes&mdash;escape&mdash;and
return with help.... But when he faced the plains its greatness
crushed his poor strength. The uncovered vastness imprisoned him
as effectually as a wall. He knew himself for what he was: an
old man, short of breath, heavy of foot; nevertheless he walked
on hastily, his eyes on the ground. The footsteps of his captors
sounded behind him, and he tried to edge towards the ravine. When
nearly above the opening of the cavern he would, he thought, swerve
inland, and dash off as fast as he was able. Then they would have
to fire at him; we would be sure to hear the shots, the warning
would be clear... and suddenly, looking up, he saw that a small
band of <em>Lugare√±os</em>, having just ascended the brow of the
upland, were coming to meet him. Now was the time to get shot;
he turned sharply, and began to run over that great plain towards
a distant clump of trees.</p>

<p>Nobody fired at him. He heard only the mingled jeers and shouts
of the two men behind, "Quicker, Castro; quicker!" They followed
him, holding their sides. Those ahead had already spread themselves
out over the plain, yelling to each other, and were converging
upon him. That was the time to stop, and with one blow fall dead
at their feet. He doubled round in front of Manuel, who stood
waving his arms and screeching orders, and ran back towards the
ravine. The plain rang with furious shouts. They rushed at him
from every side. He would throw himself over. It was a race for
the precipice. He won it.</p>

<p>I suppose he found it not so easy to die, to part with the warmth
of sunshine, the taste of food; to break that material servitude
to life, contemptible as a vice, that binds us about like a chain
on the limbs of hopeless slaves. He showered blows upon his chest,
sitting before us, he battered with his fist at the side of his
head till I caught his arm. We could always sell our lives dearly,
I said. He would have to defend the entrance with me. We two could
hold it till it was blocked with their corpses.</p>

<p>He jumped up with a derisive shriek; a cloud of ashes flew from
under his stumble, and he vanished in the darkness with mad gesticulations.</p>

<p>"Their corpses&mdash;their corpses&mdash;their... Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>The snarling sound died away; and I understood, then, what meant
this illusion of ghostly murmurs that once or twice had seemed
to tremble in the narrow region of gray light around the arch.
The sunshine of the earth, and the voices of men, expired on the
threshold of the eternal obscurity and stillness in which we were
imprisoned, as if in a grave with inexorable death standing between
us and the free spaces of the world.</p>
