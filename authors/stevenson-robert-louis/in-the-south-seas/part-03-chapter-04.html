<p>On the morrow of our arrival (Sunday, 14th July 1889) our photographers
were early stirring.  Once more we traversed a silent town; many were yet
abed and asleep; some sat drowsily in their open houses; there was no
sound of intercourse or business.  In that hour before the shadows, the
quarter of the palace and canal seemed like a landing-place in the
<u>Arabian Nights</u> or from the classic poets; here were the fit destination
of some ‘faery frigot,’ here some adventurous prince might step ashore
among new characters and incidents; and the island prison, where it
floated on the luminous face of the lagoon, might have passed for the
repository of the Grail.  In such a scene, and at such an hour, the
impression received was not so much of foreign travel—rather of past
ages; it seemed not so much degrees of latitude that we had crossed, as
centuries of time that we had re-ascended; leaving, by the same steps,
home and to-day.  A few children followed us, mostly nude, all silent; in
the clear, weedy waters of the canal some silent damsels waded, baring
their brown thighs; and to one of the maniap’s before the palace gate we
were attracted by a low but stirring hum of speech.
</p>
<p>The oval shed was full of men sitting cross-legged.  The king was there
in striped pyjamas, his rear protected by four guards with Winchesters,
his air and bearing marked by unwonted spirit and decision; tumblers and
black bottles went the round; and the talk, throughout loud, was general
and animated.  I was inclined at first to view this scene with suspicion.
But the hour appeared unsuitable for a carouse; drink was besides
forbidden equally by the law of the land and the canons of the church;
and while I was yet hesitating, the king’s rigorous attitude disposed of
my last doubt.  We had come, thinking to photograph him surrounded by his
guards, and at the first word of the design his piety revolted.  We were
reminded of the day—the Sabbath, in which thou shalt take no
photographs—and returned with a flea in our ear, bearing the rejected
camera.
</p><p>At church, a little later, I was struck to find the throne unoccupied.
So nice a Sabbatarian might have found the means to be present; perhaps
my doubts revived; and before I got home they were transformed to
certainties.  Tom, the bar-keeper of the <u>Sans Souci</u>, was in
conversation with two emissaries from the court.  The ‘keen,’ they said,
wanted ‘din,’ failing which ‘perandi.’ {231}  No din, was Tom’s reply,
and no perandi; but ‘pira’ if they pleased.  It seems they had no use for
beer, and departed sorrowing.
</p><p>‘Why, what is the meaning of all this?’ I asked.  ‘Is the island on the
spree?’
</p><p>Such was the fact.  On the 4th of July a feast had been made, and the
king, at the suggestion of the whites, had raised the tapu against
liquor.  There is a proverb about horses; it scarce applies to the
superior animal, of whom it may be rather said, that any one can start
him drinking, not any twenty can prevail on him to stop.  The tapu,
raised ten days before, was not yet re-imposed; for ten days the town had
been passing the bottle or lying (as we had seen it the afternoon before)
in hoggish sleep; and the king, moved by the Old Men and his own
appetites, continued to maintain the liberty, to squander his savings on
liquor, and to join in and lead the debauch.  The whites were the authors
of this crisis; it was upon their own proposal that the freedom had been
granted at the first; and for a while, in the interests of trade, they
were doubtless pleased it should continue.  That pleasure had now
sometime ceased; the bout had been prolonged (it was conceded) unduly;
and it now began to be a question how it might conclude.  Hence Tom’s
refusal.  Yet that refusal was avowedly only for the moment, and it was
avowedly unavailing; the king’s foragers, denied by Tom at the <u>Sans
Souci</u>, would be supplied at <u>The Land we Live in</u> by the gobbling Mr.
Williams.
</p><p>The degree of the peril was not easy to measure at the time, and I am
inclined to think now it was easy to exaggerate.  Yet the conduct of
drunkards even at home is always matter for anxiety; and at home our
populations are not armed from the highest to the lowest with revolvers
and repeating rifles, neither do we go on a debauch by the whole
townful—and I might rather say, by the whole polity—king, magistrates,
police, and army joining in one common scene of drunkenness.  It must be
thought besides that we were here in barbarous islands, rarely visited,
lately and partly civilised.  First and last, a really considerable
number of whites have perished in the Gilberts, chiefly through their own
misconduct; and the natives have displayed in at least one instance a
disposition to conceal an accident under a butchery, and leave nothing
but dumb bones.  This last was the chief consideration against a sudden
closing of the bars; the bar-keepers stood in the immediate breach and
dealt direct with madmen; too surly a refusal might at any moment
precipitate a blow, and the blow might prove the signal for a massacre.
</p><p><u>Monday</u>, 15th.—At the same hour we returned to the same muniap’.  Kümmel
(of all drinks) was served in tumblers; in the midst sat the crown
prince, a fatted youth, surrounded by fresh bottles and busily plying the
corkscrew; and king, chief, and commons showed the loose mouth, the
uncertain joints, and the blurred and animated eye of the early drinker.
It was plain we were impatiently expected; the king retired with alacrity
to dress, the guards were despatched after their uniforms; and we were
left to await the issue of these preparations with a shedful of tipsy
natives.  The orgie had proceeded further than on Sunday.  The day
promised to be of great heat; it was already sultry, the courtiers were
already fuddled; and still the kümmel continued to go round, and the
crown prince to play butler.  Flemish freedom followed upon Flemish
excess; and a funny dog, a handsome fellow, gaily dressed, and with a
full turban of frizzed hair, delighted the company with a humorous
courtship of a lady in a manner not to be described.  It was our
diversion, in this time of waiting, to observe the gathering of the
guards.  They have European arms, European uniforms, and (to their
sorrow) European shoes.  We saw one warrior (like Mars) in the article of
being armed; two men and a stalwart woman were scarce strong enough to
boot him; and after a single appearance on parade the army is crippled
for a week.
</p><p>At last, the gates under the king’s house opened; the army issued, one
behind another, with guns and epaulettes; the colours stooped under the
gateway; majesty followed in his uniform bedizened with gold lace;
majesty’s wife came next in a hat and feathers, and an ample trained silk
gown; the royal imps succeeded; there stood the pageantry of Makin
marshalled on its chosen theatre.  Dickens might have told how serious
they were; how tipsy; how the king melted and streamed under his cocked
hat; how he took station by the larger of his two cannons—austere,
majestic, but not truly vertical; how the troops huddled, and were
straightened out, and clubbed again; how they and their firelocks raked
at various inclinations like the masts of ships; and how an amateur
photographer reviewed, arrayed, and adjusted them, to see his
dispositions change before he reached the camera.
</p><p>The business was funny to see; I do not know that it is graceful to laugh
at; and our report of these transactions was received on our return with
the shaking of grave heads.
</p><p>The day had begun ill; eleven hours divided us from sunset; and at any
moment, on the most trifling chance, the trouble might begin.  The
Wightman compound was in a military sense untenable, commanded on three
sides by houses and thick bush; the town was computed to contain over a
thousand stand of excellent new arms; and retreat to the ships, in the
case of an alert, was a recourse not to be thought of.  Our talk that
morning must have closely reproduced the talk in English garrisons before
the Sepoy mutiny; the sturdy doubt that any mischief was in prospect, the
sure belief that (should any come) there was nothing left but to go down
fighting, the half-amused, half-anxious attitude of mind in which we were
awaiting fresh developments.
</p><p>The kümmel soon ran out; we were scarce returned before the king had
followed us in quest of more.  Mr. Corpse was now divested of his more
awful attitude, the lawless bulk of him again encased in striped pyjamas;
a guardsman brought up the rear with his rifle at the trail: and his
majesty was further accompanied by a Rarotongan whalerman and the playful
courtier with the turban of frizzed hair.  There was never a more lively
deputation.  The whalerman was gapingly, tearfully tipsy: the courtier
walked on air; the king himself was even sportive.  Seated in a chair in
the Ricks’ sitting-room, he bore the brunt of our prayers and menaces
unmoved.  He was even rated, plied with historic instances, threatened
with the men-of-war, ordered to restore the tapu on the spot—and nothing
in the least affected him.  It should be done to-morrow, he said; to-day
it was beyond his power, to-day he durst not.  ‘Is that royal?’ cried
indignant Mr. Rick.  No, it was not royal; had the king been of a royal
character we should ourselves have held a different language; and royal
or not, he had the best of the dispute.  The terms indeed were hardly
equal; for the king was the only man who could restore the tapu, but the
Ricks were not the only people who sold drink.  He had but to hold his
ground on the first question, and they were sure to weaken on the second.
A little struggle they still made for the fashion’s sake; and then one
exceedingly tipsy deputation departed, greatly rejoicing, a case of
brandy wheeling beside them in a barrow.  The Rarotongan (whom I had
never seen before) wrung me by the hand like a man bound on a far voyage.
‘My dear frien’!’ he cried, ‘good-bye, my dear frien’!’—tears of kümmel
standing in his eyes; the king lurched as he went, the courtier ambled,—a
strange party of intoxicated children to be entrusted with that barrowful
of madness.
</p><p>You could never say the town was quiet; all morning there was a ferment
in the air, an aimless movement and congregation of natives in the
street.  But it was not before half-past one that a sudden hubbub of
voices called us from the house, to find the whole white colony already
gathered on the spot as by concerted signal.  The <u>Sans Souci</u> was
overrun with rabble, the stair and verandah thronged.  From all these
throats an inarticulate babbling cry went up incessantly; it sounded like
the bleating of young lambs, but angrier.  In the road his royal highness
(whom I had seen so lately in the part of butler) stood crying upon Tom;
on the top step, tossed in the hurly-burly, Tom was shouting to the
prince.  Yet a while the pack swayed about the bar, vociferous.  Then
came a brutal impulse; the mob reeled, and returned, and was rejected;
the stair showed a stream of heads; and there shot into view, through the
disbanding ranks, three men violently dragging in their midst a fourth.
By his hair and his hands, his head forced as low as his knees, his face
concealed, he was wrenched from the verandah and whisked along the road
into the village, howling as he disappeared.  Had his face been raised,
we should have seen it bloodied, and the blood was not his own.  The
courtier with the turban of frizzed hair had paid the costs of this
disturbance with the lower part of one ear.
</p><p>So the brawl passed with no other casualty than might seem comic to the
inhumane.  Yet we looked round on serious faces and—a fact that spoke
volumes—Tom was putting up the shutters on the bar.  Custom might go
elsewhere, Mr. Williams might profit as he pleased, but Tom had had
enough of bar-keeping for that day.  Indeed the event had hung on a hair.
A man had sought to draw a revolver—on what quarrel I could never learn,
and perhaps he himself could not have told; one shot, when the room was
so crowded, could scarce have failed to take effect; where many were
armed and all tipsy, it could scarce have failed to draw others; and the
woman who spied the weapon and the man who seized it may very well have
saved the white community.
</p><p>The mob insensibly melted from the scene; and for the rest of the day our
neighbourhood was left in peace and a good deal in solitude.  But the
tranquillity was only local; <u>din</u> and_ perandi_ still flowed in other
quarters: and we had one more sight of Gilbert Island violence.  In the
church, where we had wandered photographing, we were startled by a sudden
piercing outcry.  The scene, looking forth from the doors of that great
hall of shadow, was unforgettable.  The palms, the quaint and scattered
houses, the flag of the island streaming from its tall staff, glowed with
intolerable sunshine.  In the midst two women rolled fighting on the
grass.  The combatants were the more easy to be distinguished, because
the one was stripped to the <u>ridi</u> and the other wore a holoku (sacque)
of some lively colour.  The first was uppermost, her teeth locked in her
adversary’s face, shaking her like a dog; the other impotently fought and
scratched.  So for a moment we saw them wallow and grapple there like
vermin; then the mob closed and shut them in.
</p><p>It was a serious question that night if we should sleep ashore.  But we
were travellers, folk that had come far in quest of the adventurous; on
the first sign of an adventure it would have been a singular
inconsistency to have withdrawn; and we sent on board instead for our
revolvers.  Mindful of Taahauku, Mr. Rick, Mr. Osbourne, and Mrs.
Stevenson held an assault of arms on the public highway, and fired at
bottles to the admiration of the natives.  Captain Reid of the <u>Equator</u>
stayed on shore with us to be at hand in case of trouble, and we retired
to bed at the accustomed hour, agreeably excited by the day’s events.
The night was exquisite, the silence enchanting; yet as I lay in my
hammock looking on the strong moonshine and the quiescent palms, one ugly
picture haunted me of the two women, the naked and the clad, locked in
that hostile embrace.  The harm done was probably not much, yet I could
have looked on death and massacre with less revolt.  The return to these
primeval weapons, the vision of man’s beastliness, of his ferality,
shocked in me a deeper sense than that with which we count the cost of
battles.  There are elements in our state and history which it is a
pleasure to forget, which it is perhaps the better wisdom not to dwell
on.  Crime, pestilence, and death are in the day’s work; the imagination
readily accepts them.  It instinctively rejects, on the contrary,
whatever shall call up the image of our race upon its lowest terms, as
the partner of beasts, beastly itself, dwelling pell-mell and
hugger-mugger, hairy man with hairy woman, in the caves of old.  And yet
to be just to barbarous islanders we must not forget the slums and dens
of our cities; I must not forget that I have passed dinnerward through
Soho, and seen that which cured me of my dinner.
