<p>They decided to find their way through the lanes to Alum Bay, and then,
keeping the cross in sight, to return over the downs, with the moon-path
broad on the water before them. For the moon was rising late. Twilight,
however, rose more rapidly than they had anticipated. The lane twisted
among meadows and wild lands and copses - a wilful little lane, quite
incomprehensible. So they lost their distant landmark, the white cross.</p>

<p>Darkness filtered through the daylight. When at last they came to a
signpost, it was almost too dark to read it. The fingers seemed to
withdraw into the dusk the more they looked.</p>

<p>'We must go to the left,' said Helena.</p>

<p>To the left rose the downs, smooth and grey near at hand, but higher
black with gorse, like a giant lying asleep with a bearskin over his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Several pale chalk-tracks ran side by side through the turf. Climbing,
they came to a disused chalk-pit, which they circumvented. Having passed
a lonely farmhouse, they mounted the side of the open down, where was a
sense of space and freedom.</p>

<p>'We can steer by the night,' said Siegmund, as they trod upwards
pathlessly. Helena did not mind whither they steered. All places in that
large fair night were home and welcome to her. They drew nearer to the
shaggy cloak of furze.</p>

<p>'There will be a path through it,' said Siegmund.</p>

<p>But when they arrived there was no path. They were confronted by a tall,
impenetrable growth of gorse, taller than Siegmund.</p>

<p>'Stay here,' said he, 'while I look for a way through. I am afraid you
will be tired.'</p>

<p>She stood alone by the walls of gorse. The lights that had flickered
into being during the dusk grew stronger, so that a little farmhouse
down the hill glowed with great importance on the night, while the
far-off in visible sea became like a roadway, large and mysterious, its
specks of light moving slowly, and its bigger lamps stationed out amid
the darkness. Helena wanted the day-wanness to be quite wiped off the
west. She asked for the full black night, that would obliterate
everything save Siegmund. Siegmund it was that the whole world meant.
The darkness, the gorse, the downs, the specks of light, seemed only to
bespeak him. She waited for him to come back. She could hardly endure
the condition of intense waiting.</p>

<p>He came, in his grey clothes almost invisible. But she felt him coming.</p>

<p>'No good,' he said, 'no vestige of a path. Not a rabbit-run.'</p>

<p>'Then we will sit down awhile,' said she calmly.</p>

<p>'&quot;Here on this mole-hill,&quot;' he quoted mockingly.</p>

<p>They sat down in a small gap in the gorse, where the turf was very soft,
and where the darkness seemed deeper. The night was all fragrance, cool
odour of darkness, keen, savoury scent of the downs, touched with
honeysuckle and gorse and bracken scent.</p>

<p>Helena turned to him, leaning her hand on his thigh.</p>

<p>'What day is it, Siegmund?' she asked, in a joyous, wondering tone. He
laughed, understanding, and kissed her.</p>

<p>'But really,' she insisted, 'I would not have believed the labels could
have fallen off everything like this.'</p>

<p>He laughed again. She still leaned towards him, her weight on her hand,
stopping the flow in the artery down his thigh.</p>

<p>'The days used to walk in procession like seven marionettes, each in
order and costume, going endlessly round.' She laughed, amused at
the idea.</p>

<p>'It is very strange,' she continued, 'to have the days and nights
smeared into one piece, as if the clock-hand only went round once in a
lifetime.'</p>

<p>'That is how it is,' he admitted, touched by her eloquence. 'You have
torn the labels off things, and they all are so different. This morning!
It does seem absurd to talk about this morning. Why should I be
parcelled up into mornings and evenings and nights? <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> am not made up
of sections of time. Now, nights and days go racing over us like
cloud-shadows and sunshine over the sea, and all the time we take
no notice.'</p>

<p>She put her arms round his neck. He was reminded by a sudden pain in his
leg how much her hand had been pressing on him. He held his breath from
pain. She was kissing him softly over the eyes. They lay cheek to cheek,
looking at the stars. He felt a peculiar tingling sense of joy, a
keenness of perception, a fine, delicate tingling as of music.</p>

<p>'You know,' he said, repeating himself, 'it is true. You seem to have
knit all things in a piece for me. Things are not separate; they are all
in a symphony. They go moving on and on. You are the motive in
everything.'</p>

<p>Helena lay beside him, half upon him, sad with bliss.</p>

<p>'You must write a symphony of this - of us,' she said, prompted by a
disciple's vanity.</p>

<p>'Some time,' he answered. 'Later, when I have time.'</p>

<p>'Later,' she murmured - 'later than what?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' he replied. 'This is so bright we can't see beyond.' He
turned his face to hers and through the darkness smiled into her eyes
that were so close to his. Then he kissed her long and lovingly. He lay,
with her head on his shoulder looking through her hair at the stars.</p>

<p>'I wonder how it is you have such a fine natural perfume,' he said,
always in the same abstract, inquiring tone of happiness.</p>

<p>'Haven't all women?' she replied, and the peculiar penetrating twang of
a brass reed was again in her voice.</p>

<p>'I don't know,' he said, quite untouched. 'But you are scented like
nuts, new kernels of hazel-nuts, and a touch of opium....' He remained
abstractedly breathing her with his open mouth, quite absorbed in her.</p>

<p>'You are so strange,' she murmured tenderly, hardly able to control her
voice to speak.</p>

<p>'I believe,' he said slowly, 'I can see the stars moving through your
hair. No, keep still, <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span> can't see them.' Helena lay obediently very
still. 'I thought I could watch them travelling, crawling like gold
flies on the ceiling,' he continued in a slow sing-song. 'But now you
make your hair tremble, and the stars rush about.' Then, as a new
thought struck him: 'Have you noticed that you can't recognize the
constellations lying back like this. I can't see one. Where is the
north, even?'</p>

<p>She laughed at the idea of his questioning her concerning these things.
She refused to learn the names of the stars or of the constellations, as
of the wayside plants. 'Why should I want to label them?' she would say.
'I prefer to look at them, not to hide them under a name.' So she
laughed when he asked her to find Vega or Arcturus.</p>

<p>'How full the sky is!' Siegmund dreamed on - 'like a crowded street. Down
here it is vastly lonely in comparison. We've found a place far quieter
and more private than the stars, Helena. Isn't it fine to be up here,
with the sky for nearest neighbour?'</p>

<p>'I did well to ask you to come?' she inquired wistfully. He turned to
her.</p>

<p>'As wise as God for the minute,' he replied softly. 'I think a few
furtive angels brought us here - smuggled us in.'</p>

<p>'And you are glad?' she asked. He laughed.</p>

<p>'<span style="text-decoration: underline">Carpe diem</span>,' he said. 'We have plucked a beauty, my dear. With this
rose in my coat I dare go to hell or anywhere.'</p>

<p>'Why hell, Siegmund?' she asked in displeasure.</p>

<p>'I suppose it is the <span style="text-decoration: underline">postero</span>. In everything else I'm a failure,
Helena. But,' he laughed, 'this day of ours is a rose not many men
have plucked.'</p>

<p>She kissed him passionately, beginning to cry in a quick, noiseless
fashion.</p>

<p>'What does it matter, Helena?' he murmured. 'What does it matter? We are
here yet.'</p>

<p>The quiet tone of Siegmund moved her with a vivid passion of grief. She
felt she should lose him. Clasping him very closely, she burst into
uncontrollable sobbing. He did not understand, but he did not interrupt
her. He merely held her very close, while he looked through her shaking
hair at the motionless stars. He bent his head to hers, he sought her
face with his lips, heavy with pity. She grew a little quieter. He felt
his cheek all wet with her tears, and, between his cheek and hers, the
ravelled roughness of her wet hair that chafed and made his face burn.</p>

<p>'What is it, Helena?' he asked at last. 'Why should you cry?'</p>

<p>She pressed her face in his breast, and said in a muffled,
unrecognizable voice:</p>

<p>'You won't leave me, will you, Siegmund?'</p>

<p>'How could I? How should I?' he murmured soothingly. She lifted her face
suddenly and pressed on him a fierce kiss.</p>

<p>'How could I leave you?' he repeated, and she heard his voice waking,
the grip coming into his arms, and she was glad.</p>

<p>An intense silence came over everything. Helena almost expected to hear
the stars moving, everything below was so still. She had no idea what
Siegmund was thinking. He lay with his arms strong around her. Then she
heard the beating of his heart, like the muffled sound of salutes, she
thought. It gave her the same thrill of dread and excitement, mingled
with a sense of triumph. Siegmund had changed again, his mood was gone,
so that he was no longer wandering in a night of thoughts, but had
become different, incomprehensible to her. She had no idea what she
thought or felt. All she knew was that he was strong, and was knocking
urgently with his heart on her breast, like a man who wanted something
and who dreaded to be sent away. How he came to be so concentratedly
urgent she could not understand. It seemed an unreasonable an
incomprehensible obsession to her. Yet she was glad, and she smiled in
her heart, feeling triumphant and restored. Yet again, dimly, she
wondered where was the Siegmund of ten minutes ago, and her heart lifted
slightly with yearning, to sink with a dismay. This Siegmund was so
incomprehensible. Then again, when he raised his head and found her
mouth, his lips filled her with a hot flush like wine, a sweet, flaming
flush of her whole body, most exquisite, as if she were nothing but a
soft rosy flame of fire against him for a moment or two. That, she
decided, was supreme, transcendental.</p>

<p>The lights of the little farmhouse below had vanished, the yellow specks
of ships were gone. Only the pier-light, far away, shone in the black
sea like the broken piece of a star. Overhead was a silver-greyness of
stars; below was the velvet blackness of the night and the sea. Helena
found herself glimmering with fragments of poetry, as she saw the sea,
when she looked very closely, glimmered dustily with a reflection
of stars.</p>

<blockquote><div>_Tiefe Stille herrscht im Wasser<br />
Ohne Regung ruht das Meer ..._<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>She was fond of what scraps of German verse she knew. With French verse
she had no sympathy; but Goethe and Heine and Uhland seemed to speak
her language.</p>

<blockquote><div>_Die Luft ist k&uuml;hl, und es dunkelt,<br />
Und ruhig fliesst der Rhein._<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>She liked Heine best of all:</p>

<blockquote><div>_Wie Tr&auml;ume der Kindheit seh' ich es flimmern<br />
Auf deinem wogenden Wellengebiet,<br />
Und alte Erinnerung erz&auml;hlt mir auf's Neue<br />
Von all dem lieben herrlichen Spielzeug,<br />
Von all den blinkenden Weihnachtsgaben...._<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>As she lay in Siegmund's arms again, and he was very still, dreaming she
knew not what, fragments such as these flickered and were gone, like the
gleam of a falling star over water. The night moved on imperceptibly
across the sky. Unlike the day, it made no sound and gave no sign, but
passed unseen, unfelt, over them. Till the moon was ready to step forth.
Then the eastern sky blenched, and there was a small gathering of clouds
round the opening gates:</p>

<blockquote><div>_Aus alten M&auml;rchen winket es<br />
Hervor mit weisser Hand,<br />
Da singt es und da klingt es<br />
Von einem Zauberland._<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Helena sang this to herself as the moon lifted herself slowly among the
clouds. She found herself repeating them aloud in in a forgetful
singsong, as children do.</p>

<p>'What is it?' said Siegmund. They were both of them sunk in their own
stillness, therefore it was a moment or two before she repeated her
singsong, in a little louder tone. He did not listen to her, having
forgotten that he had asked her a question.</p>

<p>'Turn your head,' she told him, when she had finished the verse, 'and
look at the moon.'</p>

<p>He pressed back his head, so that there was a gleaming pallor on his
chin and his forehead and deep black shadow over his eyes and his
nostrils. This thrilled Helena with a sense of mystery and magic.</p>

<p>'&quot;<span style="text-decoration: underline">Die grossen Blumen schmachten</span>,&quot;' she said to herself, curiously
awake and joyous. 'The big flowers open with black petals and silvery
ones, Siegmund. You are the big flowers, Siegmund; yours is the
bridegroom face, Siegmund, like a black and glistening flesh-petalled
flower, Siegmund, and it blooms in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Zauberland</span>, Siegmund - this is
the magic land.'</p>

<p>Between the phrases of this whispered ecstasy she kissed him swiftly on
the throat, in the shadow, and on his faintly gleaming cheeks. He lay
still, his heart beating heavily; he was almost afraid of the strange
ecstasy she concentrated on him. Meanwhile she whispered over him sharp,
breathless phrases in German and English, touching him with her mouth
and her cheeks and her forehead.</p>

<p>'&quot;<span style="text-decoration: underline">Und Liebesweisen t&ouml;nen</span>&quot;-not tonight, Siegmund. They are all
still-gorse and the stars and the sea and the trees, are all kissing,
Siegmund. The sea has its mouth on the earth, and the gorse and the
trees press together, and they all look up at the moon, they put up
their faces in a kiss, my darling. But they haven't you-and it all
centres in you, my dear, all the wonder-love is in you, more than in
them all Siegmund - Siegmund!'</p>

<p>He felt the tears falling on him as he lay with heart beating in slow
heavy drops under the ecstasy of her love. Then she sank down and lay
prone on him, spent, clinging to him, lifted up and down by the
beautiful strong motion of his breathing. Rocked thus on his strength,
she swooned lightly into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>When she came to herself she sighed deeply. She woke to the exquisite
heaving of his life beneath her.</p>

<p>'I have been beyond life. I have been a little way into death!' she said
to her soul, with wide-eyed delight. She lay dazed, wondering upon it.
That she should come back into a marvellous, peaceful happiness
astonished her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she became aware that she must be slowly weighing down the life
of Siegmund. There was a long space between the lift of one breath and
the next. Her heart melted with sorrowful pity. Resting herself on her
hands, she kissed him - a long, anguished kiss, as if she would fuse her
soul into his for ever. Then she rose, sighing, sighing again deeply.
She put up her hands to her head and looked at the moon. 'No more,' said
her heart, almost as if it sighed too-'no more!'</p>

<p>She looked down at Siegmund. He was drawing in great heavy breaths. He
lay still on his back, gazing up at her, and she stood motionless at his
side, looking down at him. He felt stunned, half-conscious. Yet as he
lay helplessly looking up at her some other consciousness inside him
murmured; 'Hawwa - Eve - Mother!' She stood compassionate over him.
Without touching him she seemed to be yearning over him like a mother.
Her compassion, her benignity, seemed so different from his little
Helena. This woman, tall and pale, drooping with the strength of her
compassion, seemed stable, immortal, not a fragile human being, but a
personification of the great motherhood of women.</p>

<p>'I am her child, too,' he dreamed, as a child murmurs unconscious in
sleep. He had never felt her eyes so much as now, in the darkness, when
he looked only into deep shadow. She had never before so entered and
gathered his plaintive masculine soul to the bosom of her nurture.</p>

<p>'Come,' she said gently, when she knew he was restored. 'Shall we go?'</p>

<p>He rose, with difficulty gathering his strength.</p>
