<p>The amazement of Ned Clinton was no greater than that of Captain
Bagley and the Indians over the sudden death of Worrell. For one
moment the comrades of the deceased stood transfixed, staring
at the inanimate form stretched on the ground before them. Then
the Iroquois gave out their war whoop, and sprang to the cover
of the nearest undergrowth. This brought them much nearer the
youth than was pleasant. The thought struck him that these warriors
would believe the one who fired the fatal shot was near by, and
begin a search which must result in revealing Clinton himself.
The precautionary action of the redmen served to recall Captain
Bagley to his own situation, and he raised his gaze from the prostrate
figure, and looked affrightedly around him.</p>

<p>"It was that Mohawk who fired that shot!" he exclaimed, making
a hurried rush for the same cover that was sheltering the half
dozen Iroquois.</p>

<p>As fate would have it, he crouched down in the undergrowth so
close to Ned Clinton that the latter believed discovery was inevitable.
He was well hidden, however, and flattened out until it seemed
he must force himself into the ground, while he feared if the
Tory escaped seeing him, he would learn of his presence from the
throbbing of his heart. But there was one thing in favor of the
youth. The shot&mdash;by whomsoever fired&mdash;had come from exactly the
opposite direction, a fact which was perceptible to the Iroquois
themselves even if unnoticed by the young man at the time.</p>

<p>Perfect stillness succeeded the report, and when some ten minutes
passed, the warriors appeared to suspect their inaction would
permit the daring Mohawk to escape, when there was a chance to
secure his scalp. At the end of the time mentioned, Ned, from
his concealment, caught a glimpse of two warriors stealing along
the edge of the open space. Their backs were toward him, thus
showing they were pursuing an opposite direction in quest of the
one who had slain their leader. Shortly after he detected others,
and last of all went Captain Bagley himself, he having changed
from a leader to a follower. Thus in a brief time Ned found himself
alone, with no one in sight excepting the inanimate form, now
stark and stiff, telling its impressive story of a miscreant cut
down in the middle of his wicked career.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether it was Lena-Wingo who did that," mused the
youth, raising his head and peering through the undergrowth at
the form. "Captain Bagley believed so, and I guess he was right,
for I can't think of any one else who would do it."</p>

<p>After what had taken place, Ned was in doubt as to what his own
course should be. From the conversation which he overheard between
Worrell and Bagley, he knew that none of the survivors was aware
of the location of the cavern, so that the fugitives might stay
within it in safety. The youth concluded he had seen enough to
carry back to his friends. He, therefore, cautiously retreated
from the hiding-place, not wishing to encounter any of the Indians,
who could be at no great distance, and desirous, too, of avoiding
another sight of the dead man. It took but a short time to reach
the tree, where he had first seen the one who had attempted to
betray them, and who had come near succeeding, too, in the effort.</p>

<p>"I don't know that anything is to be gained by staying here,
and I will go back to where I left Jo and Rosa, and tell them
they may take refuge in the cavern without any danger or disturb&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant he heard a stealthy movement behind him, and
he was in dread of a collision with some of the Iroquois, who
seemed to be almost everywhere in the forest and on the mountain.
As he wheeled about, there was the redman, painted and with gun
in his grasp; but it was the redman whom, of all others, he was
anxious to see, being no other than Lena-Wingo, the scout.</p>

<p>"Thank the Lord!" was the fervent exclamation of the youth, as
he rushed toward the Mohawk and caught his hand. "Where have you
been so long?"</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo took the proffered hand and shook it warmly, for he
held the youth in the highest estimation, as he had shown on more
than one occasion. At the same time, he put on his usual broad
grin, and replied, in his broken way:</p>

<p>"Lena-Wingo been watching you. Seen you hide in bushes when Iroquois
come, and he watch."</p>

<p>"That was you, then, who picked off Worrell?"</p>

<p>"Who Worrell?" demanded the Mohawk, sharply.</p>

<p>"Why, that chap that was shot while talking to Captain Bagley."</p>

<p>"His name not Worrell," said Lena-Wingo. "He Dick Evans."</p>

<p>"No!" gasped Ned, in return.</p>

<p>"That he &mdash;Lena-Wingo look good while for him&mdash;found him&mdash;shoot
him&mdash;won't kill any more women and babies."</p>

<p>And who was Dick Evans, that the mention of his name should cause
so much emotion on the part of those who heard it pronounced?
He was one of the most infamous wretches produced by the Revolutionary
war. He had been heard of in Wyoming valley for years before the
invasion of the Tories and Indians, and was looked upon as an
outlaw who was compelled to live in the woods to escape the penalty
of his innumerable crimes against civilization. There was no deed
too dark for him to perpetrate. When the Revolution broke out
he turned against the land that gave him birth, and committed
atrocities that no other Tory or Indian had exceeded. It was well
known that he had slain women and children in more than one instance,
and when he held the power no one expected mercy at his hands.
He was one of the most wicked of beings and more than deserved
the death which came to him with the bullet aimed and fired by
the Mohawk.</p>

<p>The latter had declared to more than one person that he would
shoot him like a dog at the first opportunity. With the defiant
nature of his race, he sent the man himself word by a Seneca Indian
that he was looking for him, and intended to keep it up until
able to draw a bead on him. Evans sent word back in reply, that
he was also looking for the Mohawk, and dared him to shoot him
if he could. The only palliating characteristic of the despicable
wretch was his bravery, and he really did do his utmost to gain
a shot at the Indian who had threatened him. But he engaged in
a game in which his antagonist was his superior, and had paid
the penalty.</p>

<p>The body was left where it fell, for another of the peculiarities
of Lena-Wingo was that, for a number of years, he had refused
to take the scalp of his fallen foe. At the time the Mohawk shot
Evans, he suspected he was leading the party in search of the
fugitives in the mountain; but the scout was so far removed from
the two men while they were talking, that he failed to gain the
import of their words. He therefore knew nothing of the scheme
which had been so skillfully laid for entrapping the three whites.
When Ned came to tell him the story, the Indian was astonished.
He had not dreamt of any such thing, for he supposed that his
friends would await him where he told them to stay and not suffer
themselves to be persuaded to disobey him. He showed that he was
displeased, but he said little, and the feeling was not deep.
Ned Clinton generously assumed all the blame himself, and, like
the lightning-rod, it did not take him long to draw the lightning
from the wrathful cloud, so that all became serene again.</p>
