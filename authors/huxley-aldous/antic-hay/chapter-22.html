<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Shearwater sat on his stationary bicycle, pedalling unceasingly
like a man in a nightmare. The pedals were geared to a little
wheel under the saddle and the rim of the wheel rubbed, as it
revolved against a brake, carefully adjusted to make the work
of the pedaller hard, but not impossibly hard. From a pipe which
came up through the floor issued a little jet of water which played
on the brake and kept it cool. But no jet of water played on Shearwater.
It was his business to get hot. He did get hot.</p>

<p>From time to time his dog-faced young friend, Lancing, came and
looked through the window of the experimenting chamber to see
how he was getting on. Inside that little wooden house, which
might have reminded Lancing, if he had had a literary turn of
mind, of the Box in which Gulliver left Brobdingnag, the scenes
of intimate life were the same every time he looked in. Shearwater
was always at his post on the saddle of the nightmare bicycle,
pedalling, pedalling. The water trickled over the brake. And Shearwater
sweated. Great drops of sweat came oozing out from under his hair,
ran down over his forehead, hung beaded on his eyebrows, ran into
his eyes, down his nose, along his cheeks, fell like raindrops.
His thick bull-neck was wet; his whole naked body, his arms and
legs streamed and shone. The sweat poured off him and was caught
as it rained down in a waterproof sheet, to trickle down its sloping
folds into a large glass receptacle which stood under a hole in
the centre of the sheet at the focal point where all its slopes
converged. The automatically controlled heating apparatus in the
basement kept the temperature in the box high and steady. Peering
through the damp-dimmed panes of the window. Lancing noticed with
satisfaction that the mercury stood unchangingly at twenty-seven
point five Centigrade. The ventilators at the side and top of
the box were open; Shearwater had air enough. Another time, Lancing
reflected, they’d make the box air-tight and see the effect of
a little carbon dioxide poisoning on top of excessive sweating.
It might be very interesting, but to-day they were concerned with
sweating only. After seeing that the thermometer was steady, that
the ventilators were properly open, the water was still trickling
over the brake, Lancing would tap at the window. And Shearwater,
who kept his eyes fixed straight before him, as he pedalled slowly
and unremittingly along his nightmare road, would turn his head
at the sound.</p>

<p>"All right?" Lancing’s lips moved and his eyebrows went up inquiringly.</p>

<p>Shearwater would nod his big, round head, and the sweatdrops,
suspended on his eyebrows and his moustache, would fall like little
liquid fruits shaken suddenly by the wind.</p>

<p>"Good," and Lancing would go back to his thick German book under
the reading-lamp at the other end of the laboratory.</p>

<p>Constant as the thermometer Shearwater pedalled steadily and
slowly on. With a few brief halts for food and rest, he had been
pedalling ever since lunch-time. At eleven he would go to bed
on a shake-down in the laboratory and at nine to-morrow morning
he would re-enter the box and start pedalling again. He would
go on all to-morrow and the day after; and after that, as long
as he could stand it. One, two, three, four. Pedal, pedal, pedal....
He must have travelled the equivalent of sixty or seventy miles
this afternoon. He would be getting on for Swindon. He would be
nearly at Portsmouth. He would be past Cambridge, past Oxford.
He would be nearly at Harwich, pedalling through the green and
golden valleys where Constable used to paint. He would be at Winchester
by the bright stream. He would have ridden through the beech woods
of Arundel out into the sea....</p>

<p>In any case he was far away, he was escaping. And Mrs. Viveash
followed, walking swayingly along on feet that seemed to tread
between two abysses, at her leisure. Pedal, pedal. The hydrogen
ion concentration in the blood.... Formidably, calmly, her eyes
regarded. The lids cut off an arc of those pale circles. When
she smiled, it was a crucifixion. The coils of her hair were copper
serpents. Her small gestures loosened enormous fragments of the
universe and at the faint dying sound of her voice they had fallen
in ruins about him. His world was no longer safe, it had ceased
to stand on its foundations. Mrs. Viveash walked among his ruins
and did not even notice them. He must build up again. Pedal, pedal.
He was not merely escaping; he was working a building machine.
It must be built with proportion; with proportion, the old man
had said. The old man appeared in the middle of the nightmare
road in front of him, clutching his beard. Proportion, proportion.
There were first a lot of dirty rocks lying about; then there
was St. Paul’s. These bits of his life had to be built up proportionably.</p>

<p>There was work. And there was talk about work and ideas. And
there were men who could talk about work and ideas. But so far
as he had been concerned that was about all they could do. He
would have to find out what else they did; it was interesting.
And he would have to find out what other men did; men who couldn’t
talk about work and not much about ideas. They had as good kidneys
as any one else.</p>

<p>And then there were women.</p>

<p>On the nightmare road he remained stationary. The pedals went
round and round under his driving feet; the sweat ran off him.
He was escaping, and yet he was also drawing nearer. He would
have to draw nearer. "Woman, what have I to do with you?" Not
enough; too much.</p>

<p>Not enough—he was building her in, a great pillar next to the
pillar of work.</p>

<p>Too much—he was escaping. If he had not caged himself here in
this hot box, he would have run out after her, to throw himself—all
in fragments, all dissipated and useless—in front of her. And
she wanted none of him. But perhaps it would be worse, perhaps
it would be far, far worse if she did.</p>

<p>The old man stood in the road before him, clutching his beard,
crying out, "Proportion, proportion." He trod and trod at his
building machine, working up the pieces of his life, steadily,
unremittingly working them into a proportionable whole, into a
dome that should hang, light, spacious and high, as though by
a miracle, on the empty air. He trod and trod, escaping, mile
after mile into fatigue, into wisdom. He was at Dover now, pedalling
across the Channel. He was crossing a dividing gulf and there
would be safety on the other side; the cliffs of Dover were already
behind him. He turned his head as though to look back at them;
the drops of sweat were shaken from his eyebrows, from the shaggy
fringes of his moustache. He turned his head from the blank wooden
wall in front of him over his left shoulder. A face was looking
through the observation window behind him—a woman’s face.</p>

<p>It was the face of Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>Shearwater uttered a cry and at once turned back again. He redoubled
his pedalling. One, two, three, four—furiously he rushed along
the nightmare road. She was haunting him now in hallucinations.
She was pursuing and she was gaining on him. Will, wisdom, resolution
and understanding were of no avail, then? But there was always
fatigue. The sweat poured down his face, streamed down the indented
runnel of his spine, along the seam at the meeting-place of the
ribs. His loin-cloth was wringing wet. The drops pattered continuously
on the waterproof sheet. His calves and the muscles of his thighs
ached with pedalling. One, two, three, four—he trod round a hundred
times with either foot. After that he ventured to turn his head
once more. He was relieved, and at the same time he was disappointed,
to see that there was now no face at the window. He had exorcised
the hallucination. He settled down to a more leisurely pedalling.</p>

<p>In the annexe of the laboratory the animals devoted to the service
of physiology were woken by the sudden opening of the door, the
sudden irruption of light. The albino guinea-pigs peered through
the meshes of their hutch and their red eyes were like the rear-lights
of bicycles. The pregnant she-rabbits lolloped out and shook their
ears and pointed their tremulous noses towards the door. The cock
into which Shearwater had engrafted an ovary came out, not knowing
whether to crow or cluck.</p>

<p>"When he’s with hens," Lancing explained to his visitors, "he
thinks he’s a cock. When he’s with a cock, he’s convinced he’s
a pullet."</p>

<p>The rats who were being fed on milk from a London dairy came
tumbling from their nest with an anxious hungry squeaking. They
were getting thinner and thinner every day; in a few days they
would be dead. But the old rat, whose diet was Grade A milk from
the country, hardly took the trouble to move. He was as fat and
sleek as a brown furry fruit, ripe to bursting. No skim and chalky
water, no dried dung and tubercle bacilli for him. He was in clover.
Next week, however, the fates were plotting to give him diabetes
artificially.</p>

<p>In their glass pagoda the little black axolotls crawled, the
heraldry of Mexico, among a scanty herbage. The beetles, who had
had their heads cut off and replaced by the heads of other beetles,
darted uncertainly about, some obeying their heads, some their
genital organs. A fifteen-year-old monkey, rejuvenated by the
Steinach process, was discovered by the light of Lancing’s electric
torch, shaking the bars that separated him from the green-furred,
bald-rumped, bearded young beauty in the next cage. He was gnashing
his teeth with thwarted passion.</p>

<p>Lancing expounded to the visitors all the secrets. The vast,
unbelievable, fantastic world opened out as he spoke. There were
tropics, there were cold seas busy with living beings, there were
forests full of horrible trees, silence and darkness. There were
ferments and infinitesimal poisons floating in the air. There
were leviathans suckling their young, there were flies and worms,
there were men, living in cities, thinking, knowing good and evil.
And all were changing continuously, moment by moment, and each
remained all the time itself by virtue of some unimaginable enchantment.
They were all alive. And on the other side of the courtyard beyond
the shed in which the animals slept or uneasily stirred, in the
huge hospital that went up sheer like a windowed cliff into the
air, men and women were ceasing to be themselves, or were struggling
to remain themselves. They were dying, they were struggling to
live. The other windows looked on to the river. The lights of
London Bridge were on the right, of Blackfriars to the left. On
the opposite shore, St. Paul’s floated up as though self-supported
in the moonlight. Like time the river flowed, silent and black.
Gumbril and Mrs. Viveash leaned their elbows on the sill and looked
out. Like time the river flowed, stanchlessly, as though from
a wound in the world’s side. For a long time they were silent.
They looked out, without speaking, across the flow of time, at
the stars, at the human symbol hanging miraculously in the moonlight.
Lancing had gone back to his German book; he had no time to waste
looking out of windows.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said Gumbril at last, meditatively.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," Mrs. Viveash interrupted him, "will be as awful
as to-day." She breathed it like a truth from beyond the grave
prematurely revealed, expiringly from her death-bed within.</p>

<p>"Come, come," protested Gumbril.</p>

<p>In his hot box Shearwater sweated and pedalled. He was across
the Channel now; he felt himself safe. Still he trod on; he would
be at Amiens by midnight if he went on at this rate. He was escaping,
he had escaped. He was building up his strong light dome of life.
Proportion, cried the old man, proportion! And it hung there,
proportioned and beautiful in the dark, confused horror of his
desires, solid and strong and durable among his broken thoughts.
Time flowed darkly past.</p>

<p>"And now," said Mrs. Viveash, straightening herself up, and giving
herself a little shake, "now we’ll drive to Hampstead and have
a look at Piers Cotton."</p>
