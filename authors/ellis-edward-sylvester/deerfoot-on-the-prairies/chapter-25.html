<p><em>THE </em>month of August was well advanced when our friends
reached the junction of two streams where to-day stands Salmon
City, Idaho. They were well received at an Indian village, whose
people showed a wish to do all they could to help the travelers
on their way to the headwaters of the Columbia. When Mul-tal-la
made known their destination several of the red men, including
the chief, shook their heads and said it was too late in the season
to make the journey; but the party were resolute, for it was not
only their intention to traverse the long distance, but they meant,
if possible, to return to the Blackfoot country in time to spend
the remainder of the winter there.</p>

<p>The Indians were right in declaring the way difficult, for the
road led over a path so strewn with broken and sharp bits of rocks
that in the course of time had fallen down the mountains, that
all feared the unshod horses would be too injured to travel. But,
to the pleased surprise of everyone, no trouble of the kind appeared.
Men and boys walked most of the time, and the animals kept pace
with them.</p>

<p>Had the little company failed to provide themselves with fishing
tackle they would have suffered for food, for day after day passed
without gaining a shot at any kind of game. The streams, however,
abounded with salmon, which were easily caught and much relished.
It was oppressively warm during the middle of the day, but as
the sun went down a rapid lowering of temperature followed, and
in the morning frost whitened the vegetation and needles of ice
put out from the shores of the streams.</p>

<p>You have heard something of the Shoshone or Snake Indians with
whom our friends had had an interesting experience. This tribe
a hundred years ago embraced the Indians of the southern ranges
of the Rocky Mountains and of the plains on both sides. A village
of Shoshones, where the explorers halted, contained hardly a hundred
warriors and two or three times as many women and children. Regarding
these people some noteworthy facts were learned. They formerly
lived on the prairies, but were driven to take refuge in the mountains
from a band of roving Pahkees, who came down from the Saskatchewan
country and attacked them with great ferocity. From the middle
of spring until the beginning of autumn these Shoshones lived
around the headwaters of the Columbia, where they were not molested
by the Pahkees. Through these months the Indians depended mainly
upon salmon, but the fish disappeared with the approach of cold
weather, and other means of subsistence had to be found.</p>

<p>This little fraternity of Shoshones then made their way over
the ridge to the waters of the Missouri, down which they cautiously
moved until they were joined by other bands, either of their own
people or of Flatheads. Thus strengthened, they had little fear
of the Pahkees, and were not afraid to hunt the bison to the eastward
of the mountains. They remained till the salmon returned to the
Columbia, when they migrated to that section. Nevertheless, the
dread of their enemies was so great that the Shoshones never left
the mountains till impending starvation drove them out.</p>

<p>These people displayed some excellent qualities. Lewis and Clark
reported them frank, fair and honest, and he and his men received
generous hospitality at their hands. As with most of their race,
war was the most exalted occupation, and no warrior could look
for preferment until he earned it by some daring exploit. The
triumph of killing an adversary was not complete if the victor
failed to wrench the scalp from his head. If he neglected to do
this and some other warrior secured the scalp, all the honor went
to him, since he had brought away the trophy of victory.</p>

<p>After parting with the Shoshones, who showed regret at losing
the company of the explorers, the latter began their final journey
across the mountains. The first camp was on the southern bank
of Lemhi River. Here Zigzag showed signs of slight lameness. He
could be ill-spared, and it was deemed best to run no risk with
him. His load was therefore distributed among Jack, Bug and Prince.
It was not thought well to make Whirlwind a beast of burden. His
proud spirit was likely to rebel and there was no necessity for
offending him.</p>

<p>Early the next day Zigzag was better, but the other three horses
retained his load, while he plodded to the rear of them. Men and
boys remained afoot. The Blackfoot took the lead, for though he
had never been through this country, he had met some of its inhabitants,
and their accounts gave him a more extended knowledge than any
other member of the company could possess.</p>

<p>Victor declared that Zigzag was shamming, for though he limped
slightly most of the time, now and then he seemed to forget it,
but then Victor never had much respect for that particular horse.
It was deemed best to humor him, however, and perhaps because
he was ashamed to keep up the deception he was soon so far recovered
that he walked without trouble after the burden had been replaced
upon his back.</p>

<p>Beaver dams were often passed, but, singular as it may seem,
nothing was seen of the animals themselves. Their rounded, cone-like
dwellings extended long distances, and many proofs of their skill
in cutting down and preparing wood were observed. These sagacious
creatures will cut up the limbs and trunk of a large tree as smoothly
and evenly as a professional woodchopper could do the work, and
in constructing their dams, some of which are of great extent,
they display astonishing skill. No freshet is strong enough to
break down these dams, and the architects provide for the overflow
as men provide sluiceways and gates to set free the surplus of
ponds and lakes. The doors of their houses are generally under
water, and the structures themselves are often two or three stories
high. They generally have sentinels on duty, and the slaps of
their tails on the surface of the water never fail to warn their
comrades in time to seek shelter.</p>

<p>These tails, it may be said, are quite a delicacy. When boiled
or prepared by cooking they suggest buffalo or beef tongue, and
are nourishing and palatable. A meal on beaver tails is always
welcome to the traveler through any region where the animals make
their home.</p>

<p>There is one accomplishment possessed by beavers not generally
known, and of which I have never heard the explanation. Sometimes
after cutting a large limb into the right length to be used in
the construction of a dam, the animal, finding he does not need
it immediately, floats it out into the middle of a stream and
sinks it to the bottom. If the water is clear you may see a number
of such sticks lying here and there ten or fifteen feet below
the surface. When the material is needed the sticks are released,
rise to the top, and are transported whither they may be wanted.</p>

<p>Now, how is it the beaver sinks the buoyant wood? How he makes
it stay on the bottom is, so far as I have ever been able to learn,
beyond explanation. The most experienced trapper will tell you
he doesnâ€™t understand it. More than once one of these men has
pushed the pieces of wood loose. The moment he did so they would
come to the surface and stay there. By no trick or device could
he make them sink again, unless by attaching a heavy weight. That,
however, does not solve the difficulty, for any substance can
be sunk by such means, which is not the one the beaver employs.</p>

<p>As the party advanced deer began to show themselves again. It
was no trouble to bring them down, and when the chance did not
offer the fish always remained, so it will be seen that the food
question gave the explorers no concern. The grass at times was
not as plentiful as they wished, but take it altogether the horses
had no reason to be dissatisfied and the journey went promisingly
forward.</p>

<p>The next important stopping place of the explorers was in the
country of the Chopunnish Indians, who lived along the Clearwater
and Lewis or Snake Rivers, which you will remember were both tributaries
of the Columbia. The Chopunnish Indians were known as <em>Pierced
Noses</em>, though it is difficult to understand why this name
was given, since, so far as known, they never pierced their noses.
The name was changed to Nez Perces by the French <em>voyageurs</em>,
and has so remained ever since. You may have heard of Chief Joseph,
who some years ago made his remarkable retreat northward to Canada,
and repeatedly outwitted the United States regulars sent against
him. Joseph was one of the most remarkable Indians that ever lived.
He was the friend of the white people, and was held in great respect
as the head of the Nez Perce tribe.</p>

<p>Our friends were impressed by these red men, who were large,
fine-looking and of dark complexion, and whose women had attractive
features. All were fond of ornaments. They wore buffalo or elk-skin
robes, decorated with beads, and the hair, which was plaited in
two queues, hung in front. Seashells fastened to an otter-skin
collar were displayed as belonging to the coarse black hair, and
feathers, green, blue and white, were plentifully seen. In cold
weather each man wore a short skirt of dressed skins, long painted
leggings and moccasins, and a braid of twisted grass around the
neck. The women used a long shirt of bighorn skin, without a girdle,
and reaching to the ankles. Bits of brass, shells and small ornaments
were tied to this shirt, but the head showed nothing except what
nature had furnished.</p>

<p>The Nez Perces had a hard time of it. They were forced to toil
during the summer and autumn to gather salmon and their winter
supply of roots. In winter they hunted deer on snowshoes, and
at the approach of spring crossed the mountains to the headwaters
of the Missouri to traffic in buffalo robes. Added to this unceasing
labor they had many fights with enemies from the west, who often
killed members of the tribe, stole horses and drove the owners
over the mountains.</p>

<p>The Nez Perces showed a very friendly disposition to our friends,
who visited their village and were invited to partake of their
hospitality for a long time. Although the Indians had a scant
supply of food, they offered the visitors all they wished. Deerfoot
and Mul-tal-la, out of courtesy, partook of salmon, but would
not consent to deprive them of anything further when the travelers
felt fully able to provide for themselves.</p>

<p>The visit to the Nez Perces solved a problem that had given the
Blackfoot and Shawanoe no little concern. The party had progressed
so far that the remainder of the journey could be made much more
readily by water than by land. All they had to do was to descend
the river in canoes to its mouth, or tidewater, or at least far
enough to gain the coveted view of the Pacific Ocean. They would
have to make a few portages and exercise skill and care in shooting
some of the rapids, but the road was open and they could not go
astray.</p>

<p>The question was as to what should be done with their horses.
These could continue toiling forward as before, but the way was
rough and tortuous, and would occupy a much longer time than the
water route. It would wear upon the animals, all of which, with
the exception of Whirlwind, showed signs of the draught already
made on their strength and endurance. If they could be left behind,
the rest would do them a world of good, and they ought to be in
prime condition when their masters returned to them.</p>

<p>Deerfoot and Mul-tal-la discussed the plan of leaving their animals
with the Nez Perces. These Indians, like all their race, are exceedingly
fond of horses, and the fear of our friends was that when they
came back their property would be gone beyond recovery. While
the warriors might not openly steal them, they could frame ingenious
excuses for their absence. The loss of the four ordinary horses
might not be so serious, for Mul-tal-la was sure he could replace
them from among his own people, but the real problem was the black
stallion. He was such a superb steed, so superior in beauty, strength
and speed to any of his kind in that region, that wherever he
appeared he attracted admiration and envy. But for the watchfulness
of his owner he would have been stolen long before crossing the
Divide. To part company with Whirlwind in what may be called a
hostile country looked like voluntarily giving him over to the
spoiler. No sum conceivable would have induced the Shawanoe to
sell Whirlwind. He was ready at any moment to risk his life for
the animal who was equally ready to die for his master.</p>

<p>This was the situation when, as the party were about to resume
their journey, they were approached by a tall, handsome warrior,
whose dress, more gaudily ornamented than the others, showed that
he was one with authority. He was absent while the visitors were
receiving the hospitality of the Nez Perces, and now hastened
forward to pay his respects while the opportunity remained.</p>

<p>The moment he drew near, Deerfoot and the boys saw from the expression
of his face and on that of Mul-tal-la that the two were old acquaintances.</p>
