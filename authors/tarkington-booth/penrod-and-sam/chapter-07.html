<p>Penrod and Sam made a gloomy discovery one morning in mid-October.
All the week had seen amiable breezes and fair skies until Saturday,
when, about breakfast-time, the dome of heaven filled solidly
with gray vapour and began to drip. The boys' discovery was that
there is no justice about the weather.</p>

<p>They sat in the carriage-house of the Schofields' empty stable;
the doors upon the alley were open, and Sam and Penrod stared
torpidly at the thin but implacable drizzle that was the more
irritating because there was barely enough of it to interfere
with a number of things they had planned to do.</p>

<p>"Yes; this is <em>NICE!" </em>Sam said, in a tone of plaintive
sarcasm. "This is a <em>PERTY </em>way to do!" (He was alluding
to the personal spitefulness of the elements.) "I'd like to know
what's the sense of it&mdash;ole sun pourin' down every day in the
week when nobody needs it, then cloud up and rain all Saturday!
My father said it's goin' to be a three days' rain."</p>

<p>"Well, nobody with any sense cares if it rains Sunday and Monday," 
Penrod said. "I wouldn't care if it rained every Sunday as long
I lived; but I just like to know what's the reason it had to go
and rain to-day. Got all the days o' the week to choose from and
goes and picks on Saturday. That's a fine biz'nuss!"</p>

<p>"Well, in vacation&mdash;" Sam began; but at a sound from a source
invisible to him he paused. "What's that?" he said, somewhat startled.</p>

<p>It was a curious sound, loud and hollow and unhuman, yet it seemed
to be a cough. Both boys rose, and Penrod asked uneasily: "Where'd
that noise come from?"</p>

<p>"It's in the alley," said Sam.</p>

<p>Perhaps if the day had been bright, both of them would have stepped
immediately to the alley doors to investigate; but their actual
procedure was to move a little distance in the opposite direction.
The strange cough sounded again.</p>

<p>"<em>SAY!" </em>Penrod quavered. "What IS that?"</p>

<p>Then both boys uttered smothered exclamations and jumped, for
the long, gaunt head that appeared in the doorway was entirely
unexpected. It was the cavernous and melancholy head of an incredibly
thin, old, whitish horse. This head waggled slowly from side to
side; the nostrils vibrated; the mouth opened, and the hollow
cough sounded again.</p>

<p>Recovering themselves, Penrod and Sam underwent the customary
human reaction from alarm to indignation.</p>

<p>"What you want, you ole horse, you?" Penrod shouted. "Don't you
come coughin' around ME!"</p>

<p>And Sam, seizing a stick, hurled it at the intruder.</p>

<p>"Get out o' here!" he roared.</p>

<p>The aged horse nervously withdrew his head, turned tail, and
made a rickety flight up the alley, while Sam and Penrod, perfectly
obedient to inherited impulse, ran out into the drizzle and uproariously
pursued. They were but automatons of instinct, meaning no evil.
Certainly they did not know the singular and pathetic history
of the old horse who wandered into the alley and ventured to look
through the open door.</p>

<p>This horse, about twice the age of either Penrod or Sam, had
lived to find himself in a unique position. He was nude, possessing
neither harness nor halter; all he had was a name, Whitey, and
he would have answered to it by a slight change of expression
if any one had thus properly addressed him. So forlorn was Whitey's
case, he was actually an independent horse; he had not even an
owner. For two days and a half he had been his own master.</p>

<p>Previous to that period he had been the property of one Abalene
Morris, a person of colour, who would have explained himself as
engaged in the hauling business. On the contrary, the hauling
business was an insignificant side line with Mr. Morris, for he
had long ago given himself, as utterly as fortune permitted, to
the talent that early in youth he had recognized as the greatest
of all those surging in his bosom. In his waking thoughts and
in his dreams, in health and in sickness, Abalene Morris was the
dashing and emotional practitioner of an art probably more than
Roman in antiquity. Abalene was a crap-shooter. The hauling business
was a disguise.</p>

<p>A concentration of events had brought it about that, at one and
the same time, Abalene, after a dazzling run of the dice, found
the hauling business an actual danger to the preservation of his
liberty. He won seventeen dollars and sixty cents, and within
the hour found himself in trouble with an officer of the Humane
Society on account of an altercation with Whitey. Abalene had
been offered four dollars for Whitey some ten days earlier; wherefore
he at once drove to the shop of the junk-dealer who had made the
offer and announced his acquiescence in the sacrifice.</p>

<p>"No, suh!" the junk-dealer said, with emphasis, "I awready done
got me a good mule fer my deliv'ry hoss, 'n'at ole Whitey hoss
ain' wuff no fo' dollah nohow! I 'uz a fool when I talk 'bout
th'owin' money roun' that a-way. <em>I</em> know what <em>YOU
</em>up to, Abalene. Man come by here li'l bit ago tole me all
'bout white man try to 'rest you, ovah on the avvynoo. Yessuh;
he say white man goin' to git you yit an' th'ow you in jail 'count
o' Whitey. White man tryin' to fine out who you <em>IS. </em>He
say, nemmine, he'll know Whitey ag'in, even if he don' know you!
He say he ketch you by the hoss; so you come roun' tryin' fix
me up with Whitey so white man grab me, th'ow ME in 'at jail.
G'on 'way f'um hyuh, you Abalene! You cain' sell an' you cain'
give Whitey to no cullud man 'n 'is town. You go an' drowned 'at
ole hoss, 'cause you sutny goin' to jail if you git ketched drivin'
him."</p>

<p>The substance of this advice seemed good to Abalene, especially
as the seventeen dollars and sixty cents in his pocket lent sweet
colours to life out of jail at this time. At dusk he led Whitey
to a broad common at the edge of town, and spoke to him finally.</p>

<p>"G'on 'bout you biz'nis," said Abalene; "you ain' MY hoss. Don'
look roun'at me, 'cause <em>I</em> ain't got no 'quaintance wif
you. I'm a man o' money, an' I got my own frien's; I'm a-lookin'
fer bigger cities, hoss. You got you biz'nis an' I got mine. Mista'
Hoss, good-night!"</p>

<p>Whitey found a little frosted grass upon the common and remained
there all night. In the morning he sought the shed where Abalene
had kept him; but that was across the large and busy town, and
Whitey was hopelessly lost. He had but one eye, a feeble one,
and his legs were not to be depended upon; but he managed to cover
a great deal of ground, to have many painful little adventures,
and to get monstrously hungry and thirsty before he happened to
look in upon Penrod and Sam.</p>

<p>When the two boys chased him up the alley they had no intention
to cause pain; they had no intention at all. They were no more
cruel than Duke, Penrod's little old dog, who followed his own
instincts, and, making his appearance hastily through a hole in
the back fence, joined the pursuit with sound and fury. A boy
will nearly always run after anything that is running, and his
first impulse is to throw a stone at it. This is a survival of
primeval man, who must take every chance to get his dinner. So,
when Penrod and Sam drove the hapless Whitey up the alley, they
were really responding to an impulse thousands and thousands of
years old&mdash;an impulse founded upon the primordial observation
that whatever runs is likely to prove edible. Penrod and Sam were
not "bad"; they were never that. They were something that was
not their fault; they were historic.</p>

<p>At the next corner Whitey turned to the right into the cross-street;
thence, turning to the right again and still warmly pursued, he
zigzagged down a main thoroughfare until he reached another cross-street,
which ran alongside the Schofields' yard and brought him to the
foot of the alley he had left behind in his flight. He entered
the alley, and there his dim eye fell upon the open door he had
previously investigated. No memory of it remained; but the place
had a look associated in his mind with hay, and, as Sam and Penrod
turned the corner of the alley in panting yet still vociferous
pursuit, Whitey stumbled up the inclined platform before the open
doors, staggered thunderously across the carriage-house and through
another open door into a stall, an apartment vacant since the
occupancy of Mr. Schofield's last horse, now several years deceased.</p>
