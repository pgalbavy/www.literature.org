<p>When George Starr announced his decision to any member of his
family no one presumed to question it. Had the son been disposed
to do so in this instance he would have refrained, for he believed,
with his parent, that he had made known their last and only hope.</p>

<p>"I will go, father!"</p>

<p>He was in the act of rising to his feet, when Tim Brophy discharged
his rifle.</p>

<p>"I plugged him," was his comment, as he peered through between
the bowlders; "the spalpeen wasn't ixpicting the same, but that
one won't bother us any more."</p>

<p>Being in the act of rising at this moment, Warren shrank back
again, undecided for the moment what to do, but hesitation was
fatal, as his father saw.</p>

<p>"Go," he said; "don't lose an instant; they are not on that side;
you can slip off without being seen."</p>

<p>The youth saw the force of the words. Crouching as low as possible,
with the Sioux rifle in his hand, he passed between the bowlders
opposite to the point at which Tim had fired, and which, therefore,
was in the direction of the open prairie.</p>

<p>The move was one of those in which success depends wholly upon
promptness. The Sioux would speedily dispose themselves so as
to prevent anyone leaving, as soon as they found that the parties
whom they were seeking were at bay among the bowlders. Fortunate,
therefore, was it that no delay took place in the flight of young
Starr, even though, when he started, the enemy was at the gate.</p>

<p>It required no very skilful woodcraft for him to get away, since
it was not anticipated by the Sioux, and he had the best means
for concealing himself.</p>

<p>There had been one idea in the mind of the rancher, which he
would have carried out but for the sudden appearance of the Indians;
that was for his son to take the remaining pony with him. The
fugitives could make no use of him, and should it prove that Jack
was gone, his owner would not be without the means of pushing
to Fort Meade for help. Circumstances, however, prevented that
precaution. It never would have done to attempt to take the remaining
pony. Warren quickly vanished among the trees and bowlders, and
the Rubicon was crossed.</p>

<p>But Jack was found just where he had been left, patiently awaiting
the return of his master. The pursuit of Tim Brophy by the Sioux
had led them in a different direction, though, had the flight
of Warren been postponed for a short time, the steed must have
fallen into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>The heart of the youth gave a bound of delight when he came upon
the animal.</p>

<p>"Follow me, Jack," he said cheerily; "if you ever did your best,
now is the time. The lives of us all depend upon you. Have a care,
my boy, or you will slip."</p>

<p>In his eagerness the youth descended the slope faster than was
prudent. Jack did slip, but quickly recovered himself, and no
harm seemed to have been done.</p>

<p>It was but a short way to the edge of the prairie, where the
pause was long enough to see that the trappings were right, when
the young rancher swung himself into the saddle, twitched the
rein, and said:</p>

<p>"Come!"</p>

<p>The gallant fellow, with a sniff of delight, sprang away, and
sped with a swiftness which few of his kind could surpass. The
snowy plain stretched in front, and he darted over it as though
his hoofs scorned the earth. The still air became a gale, which
whistled about the ears of the youth, who felt the thrill that
comes to one when coursing on the back of a noble horse to whom
the rapid flight is as pleasant as to the rider.</p>

<p>It was now near meridian. A long distance remained to be passed,
and since a goodly portion of it was rough and precipitous, the
young rancher felt little hope of reaching Fort Meade before nightfall.</p>

<p>"If we could have such travelling as this," he reflected, "we
would be there in a few hours, but there are places where you
will have to walk, and others where it will be hard work to travel
at all."</p>

<p>It was a discomforting thought, but it was the fact; since the
youth was not following the regular trail leading from the ranch
to the fort at the foot of the Black Hills. But his familiarity
with the country and the daylight ensured him against going astray;
he was certain to do the best possible thing under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Two miles had been passed at this brilliant pace, and Warren
was as hopeful as ever, when he became aware of an alarming truth,
and one which caused a feeling of consternation &mdash;Jack was
falling lame. That slip made in descending the lower part of the
ridge, just before his owner mounted him, was more serious than
he had suspected. It had injured the ankle of the horse so that,
despite the gallantry with which he struggled, it not only troubled
him, but with every leap he made over the plain it grew worse.</p>

<p>It was a condition of things enough to cause consternation on
the part of the rider, for it put an end to his hope of reaching
the fort that day. True, he could continue the advance on foot,
but, doing his utmost, he could not arrive before late at night&mdash;so
late, indeed, that no help would be sent out before the morning,
and they could not reach the beleaguered fugitives until late
on the following day.</p>

<p>"Can they hold out until then?"</p>

<p>That was the question which was ever in the young rancher's mind
and which he dare not answer as he believed the probabilities
required.</p>

<p>There was no getting away from the fearful truth. The vigilance
of his father and Tim might enable them to stand off the Sioux
as long as daylight lasted. Each had an excellent magazine rifle,
for it will be remembered that he had exchanged weapons with his
young friend, but there was not only a formidable party of bucks
surrounding them, shutting off all possibility of their slipping
off during the darkness, but other Sioux were in the neighborhood
who could be readily summoned to the spot.</p>

<p>Darkness is the favorite time with the red men when moving against
an enemy, and they would probably make no determined demonstration
until the night was well advanced. Then, when they should rush
over the bowlders, nothing could save the fugitives. Should this
emergency arise, Warren Starr felt that everything was lost, and
he was right.</p>

<p>He weakly hoped that Jack would recover from his lameness, but
all know how vain is such an expectation. The injury rapidly grew
worse, so that when the animal dropped his gait to a trot and
then to a walk, Warren had not the heart to urge him farther.</p>

<p>Slipping from the saddle he examined the hurt. It was near the
fetlock of the left hind leg. The skin was abraded; the ankle
evidently had been wrenched. It was swollen, and when the youth
passed his hand gently over it, the start and shrinking of the
creature showed that it was excessively painful to him.</p>

<p>"It's no use, Jack," said the lad; "I know you would give your
life for me, but you can't travel on three legs, and I'm not going
to make you suffer when it can do us no good."</p>

<p>Manifestly there was but one course open&mdash;that was to abandon
the pony and press on as fast as he could on foot. Jack could
get along for a day or two, and his master would not forget to
look after him on the first opportunity.</p>

<p>There was no call to burden himself with the saddle and bridle,
but they would prove an incumbrance to the animal if left upon
him, and his owner was too considerate to commit the oversight.</p>

<p>In riding so fast the young rancher had followed the general
course of the ridge, so that on halting he was quite near it.
He now turned to his right, calling upon Jack to follow.</p>

<p>The action of the pony was pitiful. When he bore a part of his
weight on the limb, after the brief halt, it had become so painful
as to be almost useless. Nevertheless he hobbled forward until
the foot of the slope was reached.</p>

<p>Here Warren removed the trappings. His blanket being rolled behind
the saddle, he spread it over the back of the horse and secured
it in place.</p>

<p>"It is all I can do for you, Jack," he said tenderly, "and it
will give you protection against the cold. You will be able to
find a few blades of grass here and there where the snow has not
covered them, and the buds of the trees will give some help. The
snow will prevent your suffering much from want of water. Perhaps
a good long rest will improve your ankle so that you can use it.
If it does," and here the young rancher spoke impressively, as
though he expected his steed to understand his words, "I want
you to start for the fort; don't forget that!"</p>

<p>He touched his lips to the forehead of his faithful ally, who
looked after his young master, as he walked away, with an expression
almost human in its affection. But there was no help for it, and
with a sad heart, but the determination to do his utmost, Warren
Starr resumed his journey toward Fort Meade.</p>

<p>Not long after parting with his pony he came upon something which
caused him surprise. In the snow directly in front appeared the
footprints of a single horse that had passed over the ground on
a run, taking the same direction that the youth was following.</p>

<p>His experience with horses told the youth at a first glance that
the animal was travelling at his utmost speed. The trail swerved
inward from the open plain, as though the rider had sought the
base of the ridge for his protection.</p>

<p>Had there been several ponies coursing ahead of him, he would
not have found it so hard to understand matters, for he would
have concluded that they were an independent party, making all
haste to reach some point, but he could not read the meaning of
a single warrior speeding in this fashion.</p>

<p>"Whoever he was he lost no time," mused Warren, breaking into
a loping trot, for his own haste was great.</p>

<p>Had he not known that poor Jared Plummer was no longer among
the living, he would have thought it possible that he was making
for Fort Meade. He wondered whether it could not be a white man
engaged on a similar errand.</p>

<p>The probabilities were against this supposition. He knew of no
rancher in the neighborhood of his old home, and it would seem
that no white man would ride with such desperation unless pursued
by a relentless enemy, and he saw no evidence of such a contest
of speed.</p>

<p>True, the pursuers might have been farther out on the prairie,
but their trail would have joined that of the fugitive ere long,
so as to make the line more direct; but though the young rancher
trotted a full half mile before checking himself and looking around,
he discovered no signs of others.</p>

<p>The last advance of Warren brought him close to the precipitous
section which, knowing well, he had feared would prove too difficult
for his pony. Raising his eyes to survey it and fix upon the best
line to follow, he caught sight of the horseman he had been following.</p>

<p>His animal was on a deliberate walk, and coming directly toward
him. The youth stopped short. As he did so he perceived that he
was an Indian warrior. Warren brought his rifle round in front,
with no intention of running from him or taking advantage of the
cover near at hand.</p>

<p>The Indian raised his hand, and oscillated it as a signal of
comity. As he did so the two were so near that the youth perceived
that the arm was bandaged. Something familiar in the appearance
of the horseman struck him at the same moment, and the young rancher
lowered his weapon with the exclamation:</p>

<p>"Starcus!"</p>

<p>It was he, and as he rode forward he had a strange story to tell
Warren Starr.</p>
