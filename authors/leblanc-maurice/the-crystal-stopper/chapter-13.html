<p>When Prasville returned to his office he saw M. Nicole sitting on a
bench in the waiting-room, with his bent back, his ailing air, his
gingham umbrella, his rusty hat and his single glove:
</p>
<p>“It’s he all right,” said Prasville, who had feared for a moment that
Lupin might have sent another M. Nicole to see him. “And the fact that
he has come in person proves that he does not suspect that I have seen
through him.” And, for the third time, he said, “All the same, what a
nerve!”
</p><p>He shut the door of his office and called his secretary:
</p><p>“M. Lartigue, I am having a rather dangerous person shown in here. The
chances are that he will have to leave my office with the bracelets on.
As soon as he is in my room, make all the necessary arrangements: send
for a dozen inspectors and have them posted in the waiting-room and in
your office. And take this as a definite instruction: the moment I ring,
you are all to come in, revolvers in hand, and surround the fellow. Do
you quite understand?”
</p><p>“Yes, monsieur le secretaire-general.”
</p><p>“Above all, no hesitation. A sudden entrance, in a body, revolvers in
hand. Send M. Nicole in, please.”
</p><p>As soon as he was alone, Prasville covered the push of an electric bell
on his desk with some papers and placed two revolvers of respectable
dimensions behind a rampart of books.
</p><p>“And now,” he said to himself, “to sit tight. If he has the list, let’s
collar it. If he hasn’t, let’s collar him. And, if possible, let’s
collar both. Lupin and the list of the Twenty-seven, on the same day,
especially after the scandal of this morning, would be a scoop in a
thousand.”
</p><p>There was a knock at the door.
</p><p>“Come in!” said Prasville.
</p><p>And, rising from his seat:
</p><p>“Come in, M. Nicole, come in.”
</p><p>M. Nicole crept timidly into the room, sat down on the extreme edge of
the chair to which Prasville pointed and said:
</p><p>“I have come...to resume... our conversation of yesterday... Please
excuse the delay, monsieur.”
</p><p>“One second,” said Prasville. “Will you allow me?”
</p><p>He stepped briskly to the outer room and, seeing his secretary:
</p><p>“I was forgetting, M. Lartigue. Have the staircases and passages
searched... in case of accomplices.”
</p><p>He returned, settled himself comfortably, as though for a long and
interesting conversation, and began:
</p><p>“You were saying, M. Nicole?”
</p><p>“I was saying, monsieur le secretaire-general, that I must apologize
for keeping you waiting yesterday evening. I was detained by different
matters. First of all, Mme. Mergy....”
</p><p>“Yes, you had to see Mme. Mergy home.”
</p><p>“Just so, and to look after her. You can understand the poor thing’s
despair... Her son Gilbert so near death... And such a death!... At that
time we could only hope for a miracle... an impossible miracle. I myself
was resigned to the inevitable... You know as well as I do, when fate
shows itself implacable, one ends by despairing.”
</p><p>“But I thought,” observed Prasville, “that your intention, on leaving
me, was to drag Daubrecq’s secret from him at all costs.”
</p><p>“Certainly. But Daubrecq was not in Paris.”
</p><p>“Oh?”
</p><p>“No. He was on his way to Paris in a motor-car.”
</p><p>“Have you a motor-car, M. Nicole?”
</p><p>“Yes, when I need it: an out-of-date concern, an old tin kettle of
sorts. Well, he was on his way to Paris in a motor-car, or rather on
the roof of a motor-car, inside a trunk in which I packed him. But,
unfortunately, the motor was unable to reach Paris until after the
execution. Thereupon...”
</p><p>Prasville stared at M. Nicole with an air of stupefaction. If he had
retained the least doubt of the individual’s real identity, this manner
of dealing with Daubrecq would have removed it. By Jingo! To pack a man
in a trunk and pitch him on the top of a motorcar!... No one but Lupin
would indulge in such a freak, no one but Lupin would confess it with
that ingenuous coolness!
</p><p>“Thereupon,” echoed Prasville, “you decided what?”
</p><p>“I cast about for another method.”
</p><p>“What method?”
</p><p>“Why, surely, monsieur le secretaire-general, you know as well as I do!”
</p><p>“How do you mean?”
</p><p>“Why, weren’t you at the execution?”
</p><p>“I was.”
</p><p>“In that case, you saw both Vaucheray and the executioner hit, one
mortally, the other with a slight wound. And you can’t fail to see...”
</p><p>“Oh,” exclaimed Prasville, dumbfounded, “you confess it? It was you who
fired the shots, this morning?”
</p><p>“Come, monsieur le secretaire-general, think! What choice had I? The
list of the Twenty-seven which you examined was a forgery. Daubrecq, who
possessed the genuine one, would not arrive until a few hours after the
execution. There was therefore but one way for me to save Gilbert and
obtain his pardon; and that was to delay the execution by a few hours.”
</p><p>“Obviously.”
</p><p>“Well, of course. By killing that infamous brute, that hardened
criminal, Vaucheray, and wounding the executioner, I spread disorder and
panic; I made Gilbert’s execution physically and morally impossible; and
I thus gained the few hours which were indispensable for my purpose.”
</p><p>“Obviously,” repeated Prasville.
</p><p>“Well, of course,” repeated Lupin, “it gives us all--the government,
the president and myself--time to reflect and to see the question in a
clearer light. What do you think of it, monsieur le secretaire-general?”
</p><p>Prasville thought a number of things, especially that this Nicole was
giving proof, to use a vulgar phrase, of the most infernal cheek, of
a cheek so great that Prasville felt inclined to ask himself if he was
really right in identifying Nicole with Lupin and Lupin with Nicole.
</p><p>“I think, M. Nicole, that a man has to be a jolly good shot to kill a
person whom he wants to kill, at a distance of a hundred yards, and to
wound another person whom he only wants to wound.”
</p><p>“I have had some little practice,” said M. Nicole, with modest air.
</p><p>“And I also think that your plan can only be the fruit of a long
preparation.”
</p><p>“Not at all! That’s where you’re wrong! It was absolutely spontaneous!
If my servant, or rather the servant of the friend who lent me his flat
in the Place de Clichy, had not shaken me out of my sleep, to tell
me that he had once served as a shopman in that little house on the
Boulevard Arago, that it did not hold many tenants and that there might
be something to be done there, our poor Gilbert would have had his head
cut off by now... and Mme. Mergy would most likely be dead.”
</p><p>“Oh, you think so?”
</p><p>“I am sure of it. And that was why I jumped at that faithful
retainer’s suggestion. Only, you interfered with my plans, monsieur le
secretaire-general.”
</p><p>“I did?”
</p><p>“Yes. You must needs go and take the three-cornered precaution of
posting twelve men at the door of my house. I had to climb five flights
of back stairs and go out through the servants’ corridor and the next
house. Such useless fatigue!”
</p><p>“I am very sorry, M. Nicole. Another time...”
</p><p>“It was the same thing at eight o’clock this morning, when I was waiting
for the motor which was bringing Daubrecq to me in his trunk: I had to
march up and down the Place de Clichy, so as to prevent the car from
stopping outside the door of my place and your men from interfering in
my private affairs. Otherwise, once again, Gilbert and Clarisse Mergy
would have been lost.”
</p><p>“But,” said Prasville, “those painful events, it seems to me, are only
delayed for a day, two days, three days at most. To avert them for good
and all we should want...”
</p><p>“The real list, I suppose?”
</p><p>“Exactly. And I daresay you haven’t got it.”
</p><p>“Yes, I have.”
</p><p>“The genuine list?”
</p><p>“The genuine, the undoubtedly genuine list.”
</p><p>“With the cross of Lorraine?”
</p><p>“With the cross of Lorraine.”
</p><p>Prasville was silent. He was labouring under violent emotion, now
that the duel was commencing with that adversary of whose terrifying
superiority he was well aware; and he shuddered at the idea that Arsene
Lupin, the formidable Arsene Lupin, was there, in front of him, calm and
placid, pursuing his aims with as much coolness as though he had all the
weapons in his hands and were face to face with a disarmed enemy.
</p><p>Not yet daring to deliver a frontal attack, feeling almost intimidated,
Prasville said:
</p><p>“So Daubrecq gave it up to you?”
</p><p>“Daubrecq gives nothing up. I took it.”
</p><p>“By main force, therefore?”
</p><p>“Oh, dear, no!” said M. Nicole, laughing. “Of course, I was ready to go
to all lengths; and, when that worthy Daubrecq was dug out of the basket
in which he had been travelling express, with an occasional dose of
chloroform to keep his strength up, I had prepared things so that the
fun might begin at once. Oh, no useless tortures... no vain sufferings!
No... Death, simply... You press the point of a long needle on the
chest, where the heart is, and insert it gradually, softly and gently.
That’s all but the point would have been driven by Mme. Mergy. You
understand: a mother is pitiless, a mother whose son is about to die!...
‘Speak, Daubrecq, or I’ll go deeper.... You won’t speak?... Then I’ll
push another quarter of an inch... and another still.’ And the patient’s
heart stops beating, the heart that feels the needle coming... And
another quarter of an inch... and one more... I swear before Heaven that
the villain would have spoken!... We leant over him and waited for him
to wake, trembling with impatience, so urgent was our hurry... Can’t you
picture the scene, monsieur le secretaire-general? The scoundrel lying
on a sofa, well bound, bare-chested, making efforts to throw off the
fumes of chloroform that dazed him. He breathes quicker... He gasps...
He recovers consciousness...his lips move.... Already, Clarisse Mergy
whispers, ‘It’s I... it’s I, Clarisse... Will you answer, you wretch?’
She has put her finger on Daubrecq’s chest, at the spot where the heart
stirs like a little animal hidden under the skin. But she says to me,
‘His eyes... his eyes... I can’t see them under the spectacles... I want
to see them... ‘And I also want to see those eyes which I do not know,
I want to see their anguish and I want to read in them, before I hear a
word, the secret which is about to burst from the inmost recesses of
the terrified body. I want to see. I long to see. The action which I am
about to accomplish excites me beyond measure. It seems to me that,
when I have seen the eyes, the veil will be rent asunder. I shall know
things. It is a presentiment. It is the profound intuition of the truth
that keeps me on tenterhooks. The eye-glasses are gone. But the thick
opaque spectacles are there still. And I snatch them off, suddenly. And,
suddenly, startled by a disconcerting vision, dazzled by the quick light
that breaks in upon me and laughing, oh, but laughing fit to break my
jaws, with my thumb--do you understand? with my thumb--hop, I force out
the left eye!”
</p><p>M. Nicole was really laughing, as he said, fit to break his jaws. And he
was no longer the timid little unctuous and obsequious provincial usher,
but a well-set-up fellow, who, after reciting and mimicking the whole
scene with impressive ardour, was now laughing with a shrill laughter
the sound of which made Prasville’s flesh creep:
</p><p>“Hop! Jump, Marquis! Out of your kennel, Towzer! What’s the use of two
eyes? It’s one more than you want. Hop! I say, Clarisse, look at it
rolling over the carpet! Mind Daubrecq’s eye! Be careful with the
grate!”
</p><p>M. Nicole, who had risen and pretended to be hunting after something
across the room, now sat down again, took from his pocket a thing shaped
like a marble, rolled it in the hollow of his hand, chucked it in the
air, like a ball, put it back in his fob and said, coolly:
</p><p>“Daubrecq’s left eye.”
</p><p>Prasville was utterly bewildered. What was his strange visitor driving
at? What did all this story mean? Pale with excitement, he said:
</p><p>“Explain yourself.”
</p><p>“But it’s all explained, it seems to me. And it fits in so well with
things as they were, fits in with all the conjectures which I had been
making in spite of myself and which would inevitably have led to my
solving the mystery, if that damned Daubrecq had not so cleverly sent me
astray! Yes, think, follow the trend of my suppositions: ‘As the list is
not to be discovered away from Daubrecq,’ I said to myself, ‘it cannot
exist away from Daubrecq. And, as it is not to be discovered in the
clothes he wears, it must be hidden deeper still, in himself, to speak
plainly, in his flesh, under his skin...”
</p><p>“In his eye, perhaps?” suggested Prasville, by way of a joke...
</p><p>“In his eye? Monsieur le secretaire-general, you have said the word.”
</p><p>“What?”
</p><p>“I repeat, in his eye. And it is a truth that ought to have occurred to
my mind logically, instead of being revealed to me by accident. And I
will tell you why. Daubrecq knew that Clarisse had seen a letter from
him instructing an English manufacturer to ‘empty the crystal within,
so as to leave a void which it was unpossible to suspect.’ Daubrecq was
bound, in prudence, to divert any attempt at search. And it was for this
reason that he had a crystal stopper made, ‘emptied within,’ after a
model supplied by himself. And it is this crystal stopper which you and
I have been after for months; and it is this crystal stopper which I dug
out of a packet of tobacco. Whereas all I had to do...”
</p><p>“Was what?” asked Prasville, greatly puzzled.
</p><p>M. Nicole burst into a fresh fit of laughter:
</p><p>“Was simply to go for Daubrecq’s eye, that eye ‘emptied within so as to
leave a void which it is impossible to suspect,’ the eye which you see
before you.”
</p><p>And M. Nicole once more took the thing from his pocket and rapped the
table with it, producing the sound of a hard body with each rap.
</p><p>Prasville whispered, in astonishment:
</p><p>“A glass eye!”
</p><p>“Why, of course!” cried M. Nicole, laughing gaily. “A glass eye! A
common or garden decanter-stopper, which the rascal stuck into his
eyesocket in the place of an eye which he had lost--a decanter-stopper,
or, if you prefer, a crystal stopper, but the real one, this time, which
he faked, which he hid behind the double bulwark of his spectacles
and eye-glasses, which contained and still contains the talisman that
enabled Daubrecq to work as he pleased in safety.”
</p><p>Prasville lowered his head and put his hand to his forehead to hide his
flushed face: he was almost possessing the list of the Twenty-seven. It
lay before him, on the table.
</p><p>Mastering his emotion, he said, in a casual tone:
</p><p>“So it is there still?”
</p><p>“At least, I suppose so,” declared M. Nicole.
</p><p>“What! You suppose so?”
</p><p>“I have not opened the hiding-place. I thought, monsieur le
secretaire-general, I would reserve that honour for you.”
</p><p>Prasville put out his hand, took the thing up and inspected it. It was
a block of crystal, imitating nature to perfection, with all the details
of the eyeball, the iris, the pupil, the cornea.
</p><p>He at once saw a movable part at the back, which slid in a groove. He
pushed it. The eye was hollow.
</p><p>There was a tiny ball of paper inside. He unfolded it, smoothed it out
and, quickly, without delaying to make a preliminary examination of the
names, the hand-writing or the signatures, he raised his arms and turned
the paper to the light from the windows.
</p><p>“Is the cross of Lorraine there?” asked M. Nicole.
</p><p>“Yes, it is there,” replied Prasville. “This is the genuine list.”
</p><p>He hesitated a few seconds and remained with his arms raised, while
reflecting what he would do. Then he folded up the paper again, replaced
it in its little crystal sheath and put the whole thing in his pocket.
M. Nicole, who was looking at him, asked:
</p><p>“Are you convinced?”
</p><p>“Absolutely.”
</p><p>“Then we are agreed?”
</p><p>“We are agreed.”
</p><p>There was a pause, during which the two men watched each other without
appearing to. M. Nicole seemed to be waiting for the conversation to be
resumed. Prasville, sheltered behind the piles of books on the table,
sat with one hand grasping his revolver and the other touching the push
of the electric bell. He felt the whole strength of his position with a
keen zest. He held the list. He held Lupin:
</p><p>“If he moves,” he thought, “I cover him with my revolver and I ring. If
he attacks me, I shoot.”
</p><p>And the situation appeared to him so pleasant that he prolonged it, with
the exquisite relish of an epicure.
</p><p>In the end, M. Nicole took up the threads:
</p><p>“As we are agreed, monsieur le secretaire-general, I think there is
nothing left for you to do but to hurry. Is the execution to take place
to-morrow?”
</p><p>“Yes, to-morrow.”
</p><p>“In that case, I shall wait here.”
</p><p>“Wait for what?”
</p><p>“The answer from the Elysee.”
</p><p>“Oh, is some one to bring you an answer?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“You, monsieur le secretaire-general.”
</p><p>Prasville shook his head:
</p><p>“You must not count on me, M. Nicole.”
</p><p>“Really?” said M. Nicole, with an air of surprise. “May I ask the
reason?”
</p><p>“I have changed my mind.”
</p><p>“Is that all?”
</p><p>“That’s all. I have come to the conclusion that, as things stand, after
this last scandal, it is impossible to try to do anything in Gilbert’s
favour. Besides, an attempt in this direction at the Elysee, under
present conditions, would constitute a regular case of blackmail, to
which I absolutely decline to lend myself.”
</p><p>“You are free to do as you please, monsieur. Your scruples do you
honour, though they come rather late, for they did not trouble you
yesterday. But, in that case, monsieur le secretaire-general, as
the compact between us is destroyed, give me back the list of the
Twenty-seven.”
</p><p>“What for?”
</p><p>“So that I may apply to another spokesman.”
</p><p>“What’s the good? Gilbert is lost.”
</p><p>“Not at all, not at all. On the contrary, I consider that, now that his
accomplice is dead, it will be much easier to grant him a pardon which
everybody will look upon as fair and humane. Give me back the list.”
</p><p>“Upon my word, monsieur, you have a short memory and none too nice a
conscience. Have you forgotten your promise of yesterday?”
</p><p>“Yesterday, I made a promise to a M. Nicole.”
</p><p>“Well?”
</p><p>“You are not M. Nicole.”
</p><p>“Indeed! Then, pray, who am I?”
</p><p>“Need I tell you?”
</p><p>M. Nicole made no reply, but began to laugh softly, as though pleased at
the curious turn which the conversation was taking; and Prasville felt
a vague misgiving at observing that fit of merriment. He grasped the
butt-end of his revolver and wondered whether he ought not to ring for
help.
</p><p>M. Nicole drew his chair close to the desk, put his two elbows on the
table, looked Prasville straight in the face and jeered:
</p><p>“So, M. Prasville, you know who I am and you have the assurance to play
this game with me?”
</p><p>“I have that assurance,” said Prasville, accepting the sneer without
flinching.
</p><p>“Which proves that you consider me, Arsene Lupin--we may as well use the
name: yes, Arsene Lupin--which proves that you consider me fool enough,
dolt enough to deliver myself like this, bound hand and foot into your
hands.”
</p><p>“Upon my word,” said Prasville, airily, patting the waistcoat-pocket in
which he had secreted the crystal ball, “I don’t quite see what you can
do, M. Nicole, now that Daubrecq’s eye is here, with the list of the
Twenty-seven inside it.”
</p><p>“What I can do?” echoed M. Nicole, ironically.
</p><p>“Yes! The talisman no longer protects you; and you are now no better
off than any other man who might venture into the very heart of the
police-office, among some dozens of stalwart fellows posted behind each
of those doors and some hundreds of others who will hasten up at the
first signal.”
</p><p>M. Nicole shrugged his shoulders and gave Prasville a look of great
commiseration:
</p><p>“Shall I tell you what is happening, monsieur le secretaire-general?
Well, you too are having your head turned by all this business. Now that
you possess the list, your state of mind has suddenly sunk to that of
a Daubrecq or a d’Albufex. There is no longer even a question, in
your thoughts, of taking it to your superiors, so that this ferment
of disgrace and discord may be ended. No, no; a sodden temptation has
seized upon you and intoxicated you; and, losing your head, you say to
yourself, ‘It is here, in my pocket. With its aid, I am omnipotent. It
means wealth, absolute, unbounded power. Why not benefit by it? Why
not let Gilbert and Clarisse Mergy die? Why not lock up that idiot of
a Lupin? Why not seize this unparalleled piece of fortune by the
forelock?’”
</p><p>He bent toward Prasville and, very softly, in a friendly and
confidential tone, said:
</p><p>“Don’t do that, my dear sir, don’t do it.”
</p><p>“And why not?”
</p><p>“It is not to your interest, believe me.”
</p><p>“Really!”
</p><p>“No. Or, if you absolutely insist on doing it, have the kindness first
to consult the twenty-seven names on the list of which you have just
robbed me and reflect, for a moment, on the name of the third person on
it.”
</p><p>“Oh? And what is the name of that third person?”
</p><p>“It is the name of a friend of yours.”
</p><p>“What friend?”
</p><p>“Stanislas Vorenglade, the ex-deputy.”
</p><p>“And then?” said Prasville, who seemed to be losing some of his
self-confidence.
</p><p>“Then? Ask yourself if an inquiry, however summary, would not end by
discovering, behind that Stanislas Vorenglade, the name of one who
shared certain little profits with him.”
</p><p>“And whose name is?”
</p><p>“Louis Prasville.”
</p><p>M. Nicole banged the table with his fist.
</p><p>“Enough of this humbug, monsieur! For twenty minutes, you and I have
been beating about the bush. That will do. Let us understand each other.
And, to begin with, drop your pistols. You can’t imagine that I am
frightened of those playthings! Stand up, sir, stand up, as I am doing,
and finish the business: I am in a hurry.”
</p><p>He put his hand on Prasville’s shoulder and, speaking with great
deliberation, said:
</p><p>“If, within an hour from now, you are not back from the Elysee, bringing
with you a line to say that the decree of pardon has been signed; if,
within one hour and ten minutes, I, Arsene Lupin, do not walk out of
this building safe and sound and absolutely free, this evening
four Paris newspapers will receive four letters selected from the
correspondence exchanged between Stanislas Vorenglade and yourself, the
correspondence which Stanislas Vorenglade sold me this morning. Here’s
your hat, here’s your overcoat, here’s your stick. Be off. I will wait
for you.”
</p><p>Then happened this extraordinary and yet easily understood thing, that
Prasville did not raise the slightest protest nor make the least show
of fight. He received the sudden, far-reaching, utter conviction of
what the personality known as Arsene Lupin meant, in all its breadth and
fulness. He did not so much as think of carping, of pretending--as
he had until then believed--that the letters had been destroyed by
Vorenglade the deputy or, at any rate, that Vorenglade would not dare
to hand them over, because, in so doing, Vorenglade was also working
his own destruction. No, Prasville did not speak a word. He felt
himself caught in a vise of which no human strength could force the jaws
asunder. There was nothing to do but yield. He yielded.
</p><p>“Here, in an hour,” repeated M. Nicole.
</p><p>“In an hour,” said Prasville, tamely. Nevertheless, in order to know
exactly where he stood, he added, “The letters, of course, will be
restored to me against Gilbert’s pardon?”
</p><p>“No.”
</p><p>“How do you mean, no? In that case, there is no object in...”
</p><p>“They will be restored to you, intact, two months after the day when my
friends and I have brought about Gilbert’s escape... thanks to the
very slack watch which will be kept upon him, in accordance with your
orders.”
</p><p>“Is that all?”
</p><p>“No, there are two further conditions: first, the immediate payment of a
cheque for forty thousand francs.”
</p><p>“Forty thousand francs?”
</p><p>“The sum for which Stanislas Vorenglade sold me the letters. It is only
fair...”
</p><p>“And next?”
</p><p>“Secondly, your resignation, within six months, of your present
position.”
</p><p>“My resignation? But why?”
</p><p>M. Nicole made a very dignified gesture:
</p><p>“Because it is against public morals that one of the highest positions
in the police-service should be occupied by a man whose hands are not
absolutely clean. Make them send you to parliament or appoint you a
minister, a councillor of State, an ambassador, in short, any post
which your success in the Daubrecq case entitles you to demand. But not
secretary-general of police; anything but that! The very thought of it
disgusts me.”
</p><p>Prasville reflected for a moment. He would have rejoiced in the sudden
destruction of his adversary and he racked his brain for the means to
effect it. But he was helpless.
</p><p>He went to the door and called:
</p><p>“M. Lartigue.” And, sinking his voice, but not very low, for he wished
M. Nicole to hear, “M. Lartigue, dismiss your men. It’s a mistake. And
let no one come into my office while I am gone. This gentleman will wait
for me here.”
</p><p>He came back, took the hat, stick and overcoat which M. Nicole handed
him and went out.
</p><p>“Well done, sir,” said Lupin, between his teeth, when the door was
closed. “You have behaved like a sportsman and a gentleman... So did I,
for that matter... perhaps with too obvious a touch of contempt... and
a little too bluntly. But, tush, this sort of business has to be carried
through with a high hand! The enemy’s got to be staggered! Besides, when
one’s own conscience is clear, one can’t take up too bullying a tone
with that sort of individual. Lift your head, Lupin. You have been the
champion of outraged morality. Be proud of your work. And now take a
chair, stretch out your legs and have a rest. You’ve deserved it.”
</p><p>When Prasville returned, he found Lupin sound asleep and had to tap him
on the shoulder to wake him.
</p><p>“Is it done?” asked Lupin.
</p><p>“It’s done. The pardon will be signed presently. Here is the written
promise.”
</p><p>“The forty thousand francs?”
</p><p>“Here’s your cheque.”
</p><p>“Good. It but remains for me to thank you, monsieur.”
</p><p>“So the correspondence...”
</p><p>“The Stanislas Vorenglade correspondence will be handed to you on the
conditions stated. However, I am glad to be able to give you, here and
now, as a sign of my gratitude, the four letters which I meant to send
to the papers this evening.”
</p><p>“Oh, so you had them on you?” said Prasville.
</p><p>“I felt so certain, monsieur le secretaire-general, that we should end
by coming to an understanding.”
</p><p>He took from his hat a fat envelope, sealed with five red seals, which
was pinned inside the lining, and handed it to Prasville, who thrust it
into his pocket. Then he said:
</p><p>“Monsieur le secretaire-general, I don’t know when I shall have the
pleasure of seeing you again. If you have the least communication
to make to me, one line in the agony column of the Journal will be
sufficient. Just head it, ‘M. Nicole.’ Good-day to you.”
</p><p>And he withdrew.
</p><p>Prasville, when he was alone, felt as if he were waking from a nightmare
during which he had performed incoherent actions over which his
conscious mind had no control. He was almost thinking of ringing and
causing a stir in the passages; but, just then, there was a tap at the
door and one of the office-messengers came hurrying in.
</p><p>“What’s the matter?” asked Prasville.
</p><p>“Monsieur le secretaire-general, it’s Monsieur le Depute Daubrecq asking
to see you... on a matter of the highest importance.”
</p><p>“Daubrecq!” exclaimed Prasville, in bewilderment. “Daubrecq here! Show
him in.”
</p><p>Daubrecq had not waited for the order. He ran up to Prasville, out of
breath, with his clothes in disorder, a bandage over his left eye, no
tie, no collar, looking like an escaped lunatic; and the door was not
closed before he caught hold of Prasville with his two enormous hands:
</p><p>“Have you the list?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“Have you bought it?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“At the price of Gilbert’s pardon?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“Is it signed?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>Daubrecq made a furious gesture:
</p><p>“You fool! You fool! You’ve been trapped! For hatred of me, I expect?
And now you’re going to take your revenge?”
</p><p>“With a certain satisfaction, Daubrecq. Remember my little friend, the
opera-dancer, at Nice... It’s your turn now to dance.”
</p><p>“So it means prison?”
</p><p>“I should think so,” said Prasville. “Besides, it doesn’t matter. You’re
done for, anyhow. Deprived of the list, without defence of any kind,
you’re bound to fall to pieces of your own weight. And I shall be
present at the break-up. That’s my revenge.”
</p><p>“And you believe that!” yelled Daubrecq, furiously. “You believe that
they will wring my neck like a chicken’s and that I shall not know how
to defend myself and that I have no claws left and no teeth to bite
with! Well, my boy, if I do come to grief, there’s always one who will
fall with me and that is Master Prasville, the partner of Stanislas
Vorenglade, who is going to hand me every proof in existence against
him, so that I may get him sent to gaol without delay. Aha, I’ve got you
fixed, old chap! With those letters, you’ll go as I please, hang it all,
and there will be fine days yet for Daubrecq the deputy! What! You’re
laughing, are you? Perhaps those letters don’t exist?”
</p><p>Prasville shrugged his shoulders:
</p><p>“Yes, they exist. But Vorenglade no longer has them in his possession.”
</p><p>“Since when?”
</p><p>“Since this morning. Vorenglade sold them, two hours ago, for the sum of
forty thousand francs; and I have bought them back at the same price.”
</p><p>Daubrecq burst into a great roar of laughter:
</p><p>“Lord, how funny! Forty thousand francs! You’ve paid forty thousand
francs! To M. Nicole, I suppose, who sold you the list of the
Twenty-seven? Well, would you like me to tell you the real name of M.
Nicole? It’s Arsene Lupin!”
</p><p>“I know that.”
</p><p>“Very likely. But what you don’t know, you silly ass, is that I have
come straight from Stanislas Vorenglade’s and that Stanislas Vorenglade
left Paris four days ago! Oh, what a joke! They’ve sold you waste paper!
And your forty thousand francs! What an ass! What an ass!”
</p><p>He walked out of the room, screaming with laughter and leaving Prasville
absolutely dumbfounded.
</p><p>So Arsene Lupin possessed no proof at all; and, when he was threatening
and commanding and treating Prasville with that airy insolence, it was
all a farce, all bluff!
</p><p>“No, no, it’s impossible,” thought the secretary-general. “I have the
sealed envelope.... It’s here.... I have only to open it.”
</p><p>He dared not open it. He handled it, weighed it, examined it... And
doubt made its way so swiftly into his mind that he was not in the least
surprised, when he did open it, to find that it contained four blank
sheets of note-paper.
</p><p>“Well, well,” he said, “I am no match for those rascals. But all is not
over yet.”
</p><p>And, in point of fact, all was not over. If Lupin had acted so daringly,
it showed that the letters existed and that he relied upon buying them
from Stanislas Vorenglade. But, as, on the other hand, Vorenglade was
not in Paris, Prasville’s business was simply to forestall Lupin’s steps
with regard to Vorenglade and obtain the restitution of those dangerous
letters from Vorenglade at all costs. The first to arrive would be the
victor.
</p><p>Prasville once more took his hat, coat and stick, went downstairs,
stepped into a taxi and drove to Vorenglade’s flat.
</p><p>Here he was told that the ex-deputy was expected home from London at six
o’clock that evening.
</p><p>It was two o’clock in the afternoon. Prasville therefore had plenty of
time to prepare his plan.
</p><p>He arrived at the Gare du Nord at five o’clock and posted all around,
in the waiting-rooms and in the railway-offices, the three or four dozen
detectives whom he had brought with him.
</p><p>This made him feel easy. If M. Nicole tried to speak to Vorenglade,
they would arrest Lupin. And, to make assurance doubly sure, they would
arrest whosoever could be suspected of being either Lupin or one of
Lupin’s emissaries.
</p><p>Moreover, Prasville made a close inspection of the whole station.
He discovered nothing suspicious. But, at ten minutes to six,
Chief-inspector Blanchon, who was with him, said:
</p><p>“Look, there’s Daubrecq.”
</p><p>Daubrecq it was; and the sight of his enemy exasperated the
secretary-general to such a pitch that he was on the verge of having him
arrested. But he reflected that he had no excuse, no right, no warrant
for the arrest.
</p><p>Besides, Daubrecq’s presence proved, with still greater force, that
everything now depended on Stanislas Vorenglade. Vorenglade possessed
the letters: who would end by having them? Daubrecq? Lupin? Or he,
Prasville?
</p><p>Lupin was not there and could not be there. Daubrecq was not in a
position to fight. There could be no doubt, therefore, about the result:
Prasville would reenter into possession of his letters and, through
this very fact, would escape Daubrecq’s threats and Lupin’s threats and
recover all his freedom of action against them.
</p><p>The train arrived.
</p><p>In accordance with orders, the stationmaster had issued instructions
that no one was to be admitted to the platform. Prasville, therefore,
walked on alone, in front of a number of his men, with Chief-inspector
Blanchon at their head.
</p><p>The train drew up.
</p><p>Prasville almost at once saw Stanislas Vorenglade at the window of a
first-class compartment, in the middle of the train.
</p><p>The ex-deputy alighted and then held out his hand to assist an old
gentleman who was travelling with him.
</p><p>Prasville ran up to him and said, eagerly:
</p><p>“Vorenglade... I want to speak to you...”
</p><p>At the same moment, Daubrecq, who had managed to pass the barrier,
appeared and exclaimed:
</p><p>“M. Vorenglade, I have had your letter. I am at your disposal.”
</p><p>Vorenglade looked at the two men, recognized Prasville, recognized
Daubrecq, and smiled:
</p><p>“Oho, it seems that my return was awaited with some impatience! What’s
it all about? Certain letters, I expect?”
</p><p>“Yes... yes...” replied the two men, fussing around him.
</p><p>“You’re too late,” he declared.
</p><p>“Eh? What? What do you mean?”
</p><p>“I mean that the letters are sold.”
</p><p>“Sold! To whom?”
</p><p>“To this gentleman,” said Vorenglade, pointing to his
travelling-companion, “to this gentleman, who thought that the business
was worth going out of his way for and who came to Amiens to meet me.”
</p><p>The old gentleman, a very old man wrapped in furs and leaning on his
stick, took off his hat and bowed.
</p><p>“It’s Lupin,” thought Prasville, “it’s Lupin, beyond a doubt.”
</p><p>And he glanced toward the detectives, was nearly calling them, but the
old gentleman explained:
</p><p>“Yes, I thought the letters were good enough to warrant a few hours’
railway journey and the cost of two return tickets.”
</p><p>“Two tickets?”
</p><p>“One for me and the other for one of my friends.”
</p><p>“One of your friends?”
</p><p>“Yes, he left us a few minutes ago and reached the front part of the
train through the corridor. He was in a great hurry.”
</p><p>Prasville understood: Lupin had taken the precaution to bring an
accomplice, and the accomplice was carrying off the letters. The game
was lost, to a certainty. Lupin had a firm grip on his victim. There was
nothing to do but submit and accept the conqueror’s conditions.
</p><p>“Very well, sir,” said Prasville. “We shall see each other when the time
comes. Good-bye for the present, Daubrecq: you shall hear from me.” And,
drawing Vorenglade aside, “As for you, Vorenglade, you are playing a
dangerous game.”
</p><p>“Dear me!” said the ex-deputy. “And why?”
</p><p>The two men moved away.
</p><p>Daubrecq had not uttered a word and stood motionless, as though rooted
to the ground.
</p><p>The old gentleman went up to him and whispered:
</p><p>“I say, Daubrecq, wake up, old chap... It’s the chloroform, I expect...”
</p><p>Daubrecq clenched his fists and gave a muttered growl.
</p><p>“Ah, I see you know me!” said the old gentleman. “Then you will remember
our interview, some months ago, when I came to see you in the Square
Lamartine and asked you to intercede in Gilbert’s favour. I said to
you that day, ‘Lay down your arms, save Gilbert and I will leave you in
peace. If not, I shall take the list of the Twenty-seven from you; and
then you’re done for.’ Well, I have a strong suspicion that done for is
what you are. That comes of not making terms with kind M. Lupin. Sooner
or later, you’re bound to lose your boots by it. However, let it be a
lesson to you.
</p><p>“By the way, here’s your pocketbook which I forgot to give you. Excuse
me if you find it lightened of its contents. There were not only
a decent number of bank-notes in it, but also the receipt from the
warehouse where you stored the Enghien things which you took back from
me. I thought I might as well save you the trouble of taking them out
yourself. It ought to be done by now. No, don’t thank me: it’s not worth
mentioning. Good-bye, Daubrecq. And, if you should want a louis or
two, to buy yourself a new decanter-stopper, drop me a line. Good-bye,
Daubrecq.”
</p><p>He walked away.
</p><p>He had not gone fifty steps when he heard the sound of a shot.
</p><p>He turned round.
</p><p>Daubrecq had blown his brains out.
</p><p>“De profundis,” murmured Lupin, taking off his hat.
</p><p>Two months later, Gilbert, whose sentence had been commuted to one of
penal servitude for life, made his escape from the Ile de Re, on the day
before that on which he was to have been transported to New Caledonia.
</p><p>It was a strange escape. Its least details remained difficult to
understand; and, like the two shots on the Boulevard Arago, it greatly
enhanced Arsene Lupin’s prestige.
</p><p>“Taken all round,” said Lupin to me, one day, after telling me the
different episodes of the story, “taken all around, no enterprise
has ever given me more trouble or cost me greater exertions than that
confounded adventure which, if you don’t mind, we will call, The Crystal
Stopper; or, Never Say Die. In twelve hours, between six o’clock in the
morning and six o’clock in the evening, I made up for six months of bad
luck, blunders, gropings in the dark and reverses. I certainly count
those twelve hours among the finest and the most glorious of my life.”
</p><p>“And Gilbert?” I asked. “What became of him?”
</p><p>“He is farming his own land, way down in Algeria, under his real name,
his only name of Antoine Mergy. He is married to an Englishwoman, and
they have a son whom he insisted on calling Arsene. I often receive a
bright, chatty, warm-hearted letter from him.”
</p><p>“And Mme. Mergy?”
</p><p>“She and her little Jacques are living with them.”
</p><p>“Did you see her again?”
</p><p>“I did not.”
</p><p>“Really!”
</p><p>Lupin hesitated for a few moments and then said with a smile:
</p><p>“My dear fellow, I will let you into a secret that will make me seem
ridiculous in your eyes. But you know that I have always been as
sentimental as a schoolboy and as silly as a goose. Well, on the
evening when I went back to Clarisse Mergy and told her the news of the
day--part of which, for that matter, she already knew--I felt two
things very thoroughly. One was that I entertained for her a much deeper
feeling than I thought; the other that she, on the contrary, entertained
for me a feeling which was not without contempt, not without a rankling
grudge nor even a certain aversion.”
</p><p>“Nonsense! Why?”
</p><p>“Why? Because Clarisse Mergy is an exceedingly honest woman and because
I am... just Arsene Lupin.”
</p><p>“Oh!”
</p><p>“Dear me, yes, an attractive bandit, a romantic and chivalrous
cracksman, anything you please. For all that, in the eyes of a really
honest woman, with an upright nature and a well-balanced mind, I am only
the merest riff-raff.”
</p><p>I saw that the wound was sharper than he was willing to admit, and I
said:
</p><p>“So you really loved her?”
</p><p>“I even believe,” he said, in a jesting tone, “that I asked her to marry
me. After all, I had saved her son, had I not?... So... I thought. What
a rebuff!... It produced a coolness between us... Since then...”
</p><p>“You have forgotten her?”
</p><p>“Oh, certainly! But it required the consolations of one Italian, two
Americans, three Russians, a German grand-duchess and a Chinawoman to do
it!”
</p><p>“And, after that...?”
</p><p>“After that, so as to place an insuperable barrier between myself and
her, I got married.”
</p><p>“Nonsense! You got married, you, Arsene Lupin?”
</p><p>“Married, wedded, spliced, in the most lawful fashion. One of the
greatest names in France. An only daughter. A colossal fortune... What!
You don’t know the story? Well, it’s worth hearing.”
</p><p>And, straightway, Lupin, who was in a confidential vein, began to tell
me the story of his marriage to Angelique de Sarzeau-Vendome, Princesse
de Bourbon-Conde, to-day Sister Marie-Auguste, a humble nun in the
Visitation Convent... [*]

     Translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos</li></ul>
<p>But, after the first few words, he stopped, as though his narrative had
suddenly ceased to interest him, and he remained pensive.
</p><p>“What’s the matter, Lupin?”
</p><p>“The matter? Nothing.”
</p><p>“Yes, yes... There... now you’re smiling... Is it Daubrecq’s secret
receptacle, his glass eye, that’s making you laugh?”
</p><p>“Not at all.”
</p><p>“What then?”
</p><p>“Nothing, I tell you... only a memory.”
</p><p>“A pleasant memory?”
</p><p>“Yes!... Yes, a delightful memory even. It was at night, off the Ile
de Re, on the fishing-smack in which Clarisse and I were taking Gilbert
away.... We were alone, the two of us, in the stern of the boat... And
I remember ... I talked... I spoke words and more words... I said all
that I had on my heart... And then... then came silence, a perturbing
and disarming silence.”
</p><p>“Well?”
</p><p>“Well, I swear to you that the woman whom I took in my arms that night
and kissed on the lips--oh, not for long: a few seconds only, but
no matter!--I swear before heaven that she was something more than a
grateful mother, something more than a friend yielding to a moment
of susceptibility, that she was a woman also, a woman quivering with
emotion ...” And he continued, with a bitter laugh, “Who ran away next
day, never to see me again.”
</p><p>He was silent once more. Then he whispered:
</p><p>“Clarisse... Clarisse... On the day when I am tired and disappointed and
weary of life, I will come to you down there, in your little Arab house
... in that little white house, Clarisse, where you are waiting for
me...”
