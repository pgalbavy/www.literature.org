<p>That thunder in the soil, at first too deep within it to be audible,
had come to the surface now and gradually became heard as the
thunder of a million feet upon the training grounds. The bugles
rang sharper; the drums and fifes of town and village and countryside
were the drums and fifes of a war that came closer and closer
to every hearth between the two oceans.</p>

<p>All the old symbols became symbols bright and new, as if no one
had ever seen them before. "America" was like a new word, and
the song "America"  was like a new song. All the dusty blatancies
of orating candidates, seeking to rouse bored auditors with "the
old flag"; all the mechanical patriotics of school and church
and club; all these time-worn flaccid things leaped suddenly into
living colour. The flag became brilliant and strange to see&mdash;strange
with a meaning that seemed new, a meaning long known, yet never
known till now.</p>

<p>And so hearts that thought they knew themselves came upon ambushes
of emotion and hidden indwellings of spirit not guessed before.
Dora Yocum, listening to the "Star Spangled Banner," sung by children
of immigrants to an out-of-tune old piano in a mission clubroom,
in Chicago, found herself crying with a soul-shaking heartiness
in a way different from other ways that she had cried. Among the
many things she thought of then was this: That the banner the
children were singing about was in danger. The great country,
almost a continent, had always seemed so untouchable, so safe
and sure; she had never been able to conceive of a hostile power
mighty enough to shake or even jar it. And since so great and
fundamental a thing could not be injured, a war for its defence
had appeared to be, in her eyes, not only wicked but ridiculous.
At last, less and less vaguely, she had come to comprehend something
of the colossal German threat, and the shadow that touched this
bright banner of which the immigrants' children piped so briskly
in the mission club-room.</p>

<p>She had begun to understand, though she could not have told just
why, or how, or at what moment understanding reached her. She
began to understand that her country, threatened to the life,
had flung its line those thousands of miles across the sea to
stand and hold Hindenburg and Ludendorff and all their Kaisers,
Kings, Dukes, and Crown Princes, their Krupp and Skoda monstrous
engines, and their monstrous other engines of men made into armies.
Through the long haze of misted sea-miles and the smoke of land-miles
she perceived that brown line of ours, and knew it stood there
that Freedom, and the Nation itself, might not perish from the
earth.</p>

<p>And so, a week later, she went home, and came nervously to Ramsey's
mother and found how to direct the letter she wanted to write.
He was in France.</p>

<p>As the old phrase went, she poured out her heart. It seems to
apply to her letter.</p>

<p>She wrote:</p>

<p>Don't misunderstand me. I felt that my bitter speech to you had
driven you to take the step you did. I felt that I had sent you
to be killed, and that I ought to be killed for doing it, but
I knew that you had other motives, too. I knew, of course, that
you thought of the country more than you did of me, or of any
mad thing I would say&mdash;but I thought that what I said might have
been the prompting thing, the word that threw you into it so hastily
and before you were ready, perhaps. I dreaded to bear that terrible
responsibility. I hope you understand.</p>

<p>My great mistake has been &mdash;I thought I sas so "logical"&mdash;it's
been in my starting everything with a thought I'd never proven;
that war is the worst thing, and all other evils were lesser.
I was wrong. I was wrong, because war isn't the worst evil. Slavery
is the worse evil, and now I want to tell you I have come to see
that you are making war on those that make slavery. Yes, you are
fighting those that make both war and slavery, and you are right,
and I humbly reverence and honour all of you who are in this right
war. I have come home to work in the Red Cross here; I work there
all day, and all day I keep saying to myself&mdash;but I really mean
to <em>you</em>&mdash;it's what I pray, and oh, how I pray it: "God
be with you and grant you the victory!" For you must win and you
will win.</p>

<p>Forgive me, oh, please&mdash;and if you will, could you write to me?
I know you have things to do more important than "girls"&mdash;but
oh, couldn't you, please?</p>

<p>This letter, which she had taken care not to dampen, as she wrote,
went in slow course to the "American Expeditionary Forces in France,"
and finally found him whom it patiently sought. He delayed not
long to answer, and in time she held in a shaking hand the pencilled
missive he had sent her.</p>

<p>You forget all that comic talk about me enlisting because of
your telling me to. I'd written my father I was going at the first
chance a month and a half before that day when you said it. My
mind was made up at the first time there was any talk of war,
and you had about as much responsibility for my going as some
little sparrow or something. Of course I don't mean I didn't pay
any attention to the different things you said, because I always
did, and I used to worry over it because I was afraid some day
it would get you in trouble, and I'm mighty glad you've cut it
out. That's right; you be a regular girl now. You always were
one, and I knew it all right. I'm not as scared to write to you
as I was to talk to you, so I guess you know I was mighty tickled
to get your letter. It sounded blue, but I was glad to get it.
You <em>bet</em> I'll write to you! I don't suppose you could
have any idea how glad I was to get your letter. I could sit here
and write to you all day if they'd let me, but I'm a corporal
now. When you answer this, I wish you'd say how the old town looks
and if the grass in the front yards is as green as it usually
is, and everything. And tell me some more about everything you
think of when you are working down at the Red Cross like you said.
I guess I've read your letter five million times, and that part
ten million. I mean where you underlined that "<em>you</em>" and
what you said to yourself at the Red Cross. Oh, murder, but I
was glad to read that! Don't forget about writing anything else
you think of like that.</p>

<p>Well, I was interrupted then and this is the next day. Of course,
I can't tell you where we are, because that darned censor will
read this letter, but I guess he will let this much by. Who do
you think I ran across in a village yesterday? Two boys from the
old school days, and we certainly did shake hands a few times!
It was the old foolish Dutch Krusemeyer and Albert Paxton, both
of them lieutenants. I heard Fred Mitchell is still training in
the States and about crazy because they won't send him over yet.</p>

<p>If you had any idea how glad I was to get your letter, you wouldn't
lose any time answering this one. Anyhow, I'm going to write to
you again every few days if I get the chance, because maybe you'll
answer more than one of 'em.</p>

<p>But see here, cut out that "sent you to be killed" stuff. You've
got the wrong idea altogether. We've got the big job of our lives,
we know that, but we're going to do it. There'll be mistakes and
bad times, but we won't fall down. Now you'll excuse me for saying
it this way, Dora, but I don't know just how to express myself
except saying of course we know everybody isn't going to get back
home&mdash;but listen, we didn't come over here to get killed particularly,
we came over here to give these Dutchmen h&mdash;l!</p>

<p>Perhaps you can excuse language if I write it with a blank like
that, but before we get back we're going to do what we came for.
They may not all of them be as bad as some of them&mdash;it's a good
thing you don't know what we do, because some of it would make
you sick. As I say, there may be quite a lot of good ones among
them; but we know what they've done to this country, and we know
what they mean to do to ours. So we're going to attend to them.
Of course that's why I'm here. It wasn't you.</p>

<p>Don't forget to write pretty soon, Dora. You say in your letter
&mdash;I certainly was glad to get that letter&mdash;well, you say
I have things to do more important than "girls." Dora, I think
you probably know without my saying so that of course while I
have got important things to do, just as every man over here has,
and everybody at home, for that matter, well, the thing that is
most important in the world to me, next to helping win this war,
it's reading the next letter from you.</p>

<p>Don't forget how glad I'll be to get it, and don't forget you
didn't have anything to do with my being over here. That was&mdash;it
was something else. And you bet, whatever happens I'm glad I came!
Don't ever forget <em>that</em>!</p>

<p>Dora knew it was "something else." Her memory went back to her
first recollection of him in school: from that time on he had
been just an ordinary, everyday boy, floundering somehow through
his lessons in school and through his sweethearting with Milla,
as the millions of other boys floundered along with their own
lessons and their own Millas. She saw him swinging his books and
romping homeward from the schoolhouse, or going whistling by her
father's front yard, rattling a stick on the fence as he went,
care-free and masterful, but shy as a deer if strangers looked
at him, and always "not much of a talker."</p>

<p>She had always felt so superior to him, she shuddered as she
thought of it. His quiet had been so much better than her talk.
His intelligence was proven now, when it came to the great test,
to be of a stronger sort than hers. He was wise and good and gentle&mdash;and
a fighting man! "We know what they've done to this country and
what they mean to do to ours. So we're going to attend to them."
She read this over, and she knew that Ramsey, wise and gentle
and good, would fight like an unchained devil, and that he and
his comrades would indeed and indeed do what they "came for."</p>

<p>"It wasn't you," he said. She nodded gently, agreeing, and knew
what it was that sent him. Yet Ramsey had his own secret there,
and did not tell it. Sometimes there rose, faint in his memory,
a whimsical picture, yet one that had always meant much to him.
He would see an old man sitting with a little boy upon a rustic
bench under a walnut tree to watch the "Decoration Day Parade"
go by&mdash;and Ramsey would see a shoot of sunshine that had somehow
got through the walnut tree and made a bedazzlement of glinting
fine lines over a spot about the size of a saucer, upon the old
man's thick white hair. And in Ramsey's memory, the little boy,
sitting beside the veteran, would half close his eyes, drowsily,
playing that this sunshine spot was a white bird's-nest, until
he had a momentary dream of a glittering little bird that dwelt
there and wore a blue soldier cap on its head. And Ramsey would
bring out of his memory thoughts that the old man had got into
the child's head that day. "We knew that armies fighting for the
Freedom of Man <em>had</em> to win, in the long run.... We were
on the side of God's Plan.... Long ago we began to see hints of
His Plan.... Man has to win his freedom from himself&mdash;men in the
light have to fight against men in the dark.... That light is
the answer.... We had the light that made us never doubt."</p>

<p>A long while Dora sat with the letter in her hand before she
answered it and took it upon her heart to wear. That was the place
for it, since it was already within her heart, where he would
find it when he came home again. And she beheld the revelation
sent to her. This ordinary life of Ramsey's was but the outward
glinting of a high and splendid spirit, as high and splendid as
earth can show. And yet it was only the life of an everyday American
boy. The streets of the town were full, now, of boys like Ramsey.</p>

<p>At first they were just boys in uniform; then one saw that they
were boys no more.</p>

<p>They were soldiers.</p>
