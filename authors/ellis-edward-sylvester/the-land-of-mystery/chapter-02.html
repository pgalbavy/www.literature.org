<p>At last, when the full moon was shining, the two men stood at
the head of the rapids and surveyed their surroundings before
setting out on their return to camp.</p>

<p>Both sides of the Xingu were lined by the dense forest, in which
the vegetation is so luxuriant that it must be a source of never
ending wonder to those who look upon it for the first time.  The
river above made a sharp bend, shutting off the view so fully
that from their position, it was impossible to tell how far they
would be able to use the canoe without making another portage.</p>

<p>"We haven't seen a person on our way here," remarked the Professor,
calmly surveying the river and shores; "and I hope Ashman will
bring back a similar report, for we all need a full night's rest."</p>

<p>"How is <em>that</em>?"</p>

<p>Long touched the arm of his companion, as he asked the question,
and pointed down stream in the direction of camp.</p>

<p>To the amazement of the Professor, three natives were seen standing
on the very spot where they themselves had stood a brief while
before, evidently scrutinizing the white strangers with profound
wonder and curiosity.</p>

<p>They were dressed similarly to Bippo, Pedros and Quincal&mdash;that
is, with only a piece of cloth around the loins&mdash;but they displayed
a marked contrast in other respects.  They were taller, more athletic,
with immense bushy heads of hair, enormous rings in their ears,
while the hue of their skins was almost as dark as that of the
native African.</p>

<p>One carried a long-bow and a bundle of arrows strapped behind
his shoulders, while the others were armed simply with javelins
or spears.</p>

<p>"Those fellows mean fight," added Long.</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," replied the Professor.</p>

<p>"But a Winchester will reach further than their arrows and spears,
even if they are tipped with poison."</p>

<p>"Possibly they may be friendly, if they can be convinced that
we intend them no harm, and you know what an advantage it will
be to us if able to trust all the natives on our return."</p>

<p>Long could not share the confidence of his companion and favored
a direct advance down the bank toward the savages.  If the latter
preserved their armed neutrality, all would be well enough, but
at the first sign of hostility he advocated opening fire on them.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was right in the declaration that anything like timidity
in dealing with savages is the worst possible course.  While the
rights of every barbarian should be respected, it is all important
that he should know that such concession is made not through fear,
but because the superior party wishes to be just and merciful.</p>

<p>The natives stood as motionless as statues for several minutes,
during which the white men scrutinized them with an interest that
may be imagined.</p>

<p>The first and most natural thought of our friends was that an
encounter could be avoided by entering the forest on the right
and passing round the savages, who, it was quite apparent, intended
to dispute their return; but if such was really their purpose,
they would have little trouble in heading off the whites in the
dense wood, beside which, for the weighty reasons already named,
it would have been exceedingly unwise to act as though afraid
of the dusky natives.</p>

<p>Despite Long's protest, the Professor decided to make a friendly
advance, being vigilantly on his guard at the same time for the
first offensive move of the savages.  He carried his Winchester
in one hand, while he rested the other on his revolver.  He was
determined, while hoping for comity, to be prepared for hostility
or treachery.</p>

<p>Long was so dissatisfied with the looks of things, that he followed
his friend a few paces, then halting with his Winchester ready
for any emergency, and certain in his own mind that a sharp fight
was inevitable.</p>

<p>The approach of the white man was evidently a surprise to the
savages. The middle one, who held the long-bow and arrows, fell
back several paces, as if about to break into flight or dart among
the trees so invitingly near, but something must have been said
by his companions to check him, for he stopped abruptly, and not
only came back to his first position, but advanced a couple of
paces beyond.  The noise from the rapids prevented the Professor
hearing their voices, though the unusually clear moonlight told
him that some utterance had passed between them.</p>

<p>The first ominous act on the part of the natives was by this
archer, who deliberately drew an arrow from over his shoulder
and fitted it against the string of his bow.  The fact that the
missile was undoubtedly coated at the end with a virus more deadly
than that of the rattlesnake or cobra was enough to render the
would-be friend uncomfortable and to increase his alertness.</p>

<p>At the same time that the archer went through this significant
preliminary, his companions shifted their grasp upon their javelins
in a manner that was equally suggestive.</p>

<p>While carrying these primitive weapons, the fingers closed around
the centre of gravity, that naturally being more convenient, but
when about to hurl them, the hand was shoved further toward the
head.  Both natives thus shifted their right hands, though, they
still held them horizontal at their thighs, from which position
they could be brought aloft in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>The white man walked slowly.  The left hand, which supported
his rifle, remained motionless, but removing the right from his
revolver, he continued making signs, whose friendly meaning was
so obvious that it was impossible for the natives to mistake it.</p>

<p>While approaching in this guarded manner, he Studied them with
the closest scrutiny.  Interesting under any circumstances, they
were vastly more so at this time.  What struck him in addition
to the characteristics already named, were their frowsy eyebrows
and glittering coal-black eyes.  These were unusually large and
protruding. The noses, instead of being broad and flat, like those
of the native Africans, were Roman in shape.  The mouths were
wide, and, when they spoke, he observed that the teeth which were
displayed were black, showing that a fashion prevailed among this
unknown tribe similar to that in vogue among many of the natives
in the East Indies.</p>

<p>Now, Professor Grimcke was too experienced an explorer to walk
directly into danger, where there was no prospect of avoiding
a desperate encounter.  While eager to make friends with all the
people whom he met, he did not intend to assume any unnecessary
risks.  The demeanor of the natives tendered it certain they were
hostile.  They made no responsive signs to those of the white
man, and the latter would have checked himself half way, but for
his suspicion that they were mystified by his conduct and were
undecided as to the precise thing to do.</p>

<p>He not only heard their peculiar rumbling voices, but saw from
the movements of their lips and their glances in each other's
faces, that they were consulting as to what they should do.  The
white man was already so close that he could easily be reached
by the bowman, and there was little doubt that either of the others
could hurl his poisoned javelin the intervening distance.</p>

<p>The only way of defeating such a movement was for the white man
to secure "the drop" on them, but, in one sense that was impossible.
Unable to understand the words spoken, they were equally unacquainted
with the weapons of the pale face, and would, doubtless pay no
heed to the most threatening demonstration on his part.</p>

<p>"Take my advice and come back," called Jared Long; "keep your
face toward them and blaze away, and I'll do my part!"</p>

<p>Instead of adopting the suggestion of his friend, the Professor
slowed his pace, still making his gestures of good will.  However,
when fifty steps away, he came to a dead halt.</p>

<p>He had advanced three-fourths the distance, and, if the others
were willing to accept his offers, they should signify it by coming
forward and meeting him where he had stopped.</p>

<p>While moving forward in this guarded manner, Grimcke was prudent
enough to edge over toward the woods, which were now so close
to his right side as to be instantly available.  When he came
to a stop also it was near the trunk of a large tree, no more
than a yard distant.</p>

<p>"The Professor is cunning," reflected Jared Long, watching every
movement; "he'll whisk behind the tree the instant one of them
makes a move.  Helloa! what's up now?"</p>

<p>To the astonishment of both white men the native with the bow
shifted it at this moment to his right hand, holding the arrow
in place against the string with the same hand, while the weapon
was at his side.  Then he moved a step or two, as if to meet the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Look out!" called the vigilant New Englander, "that chap is
up to some deviltry."</p>

<p>He did not refer to him with the bow and arrow, but to one of
the others, who stealthily turned aside and vanished among the
trees. Being in the Professor's line of vision the latter observed
the suspicious movement, and it cannot be said that it added to
his comfort.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the archer advanced, but with such tardy step that
it was evident he was timing his pace to that of his comrade who
had so stealthily entered the wood.  Convinced that his real peril
lay among those trees, Grimcke began a backward movement with
such caution that he hoped it would not be noticed by the native
who was approaching with a sluggish pace.</p>

<p>The forest, like all those in South America, was so dense that
great care was necessary for one to pick his way through it. 
The Professor's theory was that the savage with the spear would
regulate his movements on the theory that the white man would
not stir from the place where he had first halted.  He would thus
aim to secure a position from which he could hurl his javelin
at him without detection.  Grimcke conceived this was certain
to take place, and, if he remained where he was, nothing could
save him from the treacherous assault.  It was a matter, therefore,
of self preservation that dictated the brief retreat with the
hope of thus disconcerting the savage.</p>

<p>The task which Grimcke had given himself was difficult indeed. 
The ground was unfavorable for the peculiar twitching movement
which he hoped would carry him out of danger.  He had gone barely
a couple of yards when the bowman evidently suspected something
of the kind, for he stopped short and stared inquiringly at the
white man.</p>

<p>The latter extended his right hand as if to shake that of the
savage, who stood motionless, making no sign of pleasure or displeasure.
Indeed, he remained so fixed in his position that Grimcke was
convinced he was listening for the sound of the other miscreant
stealing through the wood.  He plainly saw the black eyes cast
a single inquiring glance in that direction.</p>

<p>"This is getting a little too threatening," reflected the Professor,
satisfied that the three natives were as venomous as so many serpents;
"at the first move war is declared."</p>

<p>His situation was so critical that he did not dare turn his head
to look behind him, but never was there a more welcome sound to
him than that made by the footsteps of the lank New Englander.</p>

<p>"Keep moving hack!" called Long, "but don't try to hide what
you're doing."</p>

<p>The Professor saw the sense of this advice and he followed it,
lifting his feet so high that the action was plainly seen, but
doing so with a certain dignity that was not lacking in impressiveness. 
His aim was to give the act the appearance of a strategic movement,
as it may be called.  It was not that he was afraid of the natives,
but he was seeking a better place from which to open hostilities
against them.</p>

<p>This was the impression which he sought to give the fierce savages,
and whether he succeeded, or not was certain to become apparent
within the following five minutes.  He himself believed, the chances
were against the success of his plan.</p>
