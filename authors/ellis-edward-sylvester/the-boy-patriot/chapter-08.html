<p>The place in which Blair and his companion found themselves was
a small strongly built closet, used as a "lock-up" for refractory
sailors. A single bull's-eye admitted a mere glimmer of light
for a while, but that soon died away in utter darkness as the
night came rapidly on. It was well for the boys that they knew
something of ocean's rough rocking. A land-lubber would have had
all the miseries of sea-sickness added to the horrors of that
dreary dungeon.</p>

<p>A new exaltation of spirit had come over Blair. Difficulties
and dangers seemed as nothing to him while in the path of duty.
He feared neither the raging elements nor the power of angry enemies.
He had the promise that those who trust in God shall never be
moved, and in this strong refuge he was safe.</p>

<p>Not so with poor Hal. The dread of death had seized him, and
absorbed all other thoughts. He could not but think of the horrors
into which he should be plunged if he suddenly found a watery
grave. Prayer seemed impossible for him, as in a kind of agonized
waiting he met every plunge and reel of the storm-tossed ship.</p>

<p>Ah, the time of peril is not the best time to make one's peace
with God. When heart and flesh fail, the soul shrinks in dismay
before its coming doom. Even the wild prayers for deliverance
which may burst from the affrighted soul, what will they avail
at the judgment? Are they the cries of the contrite heart mourning
for its sins against a holy, loving, and beneficent heavenly Father?
Are they not rather but as the shrieks of the criminal who sees
no escape from his merited retribution? Alas for him who postpones
his day of repentance till face to face with the king of terrors.
It is he only who is strong in his great Deliverer who can see
that icy beckoning hand, and amid the shrinking of human nature
find himself calm in the strength which only God supplies. If
the agonies or the stupor of the sick-bed unfit the soul to seek
peace with God in the dying hour, even so does the anguish of
such fear as now bowed poor Hal to the earth.</p>

<p>As the English lad crouched in his terror, Blair knelt at his
side and prayed earnestly for him to that God who seemed to the
young Christian but the more surely at hand, for the tokens of
his power that made that mighty ship quiver like a leaf in the
autumn wind.</p>

<p>Worn out with the excess of his own strong emotion, Hal at length
sank into a deep slumber, and rolled and tossed with the vessel
like a lifeless thing. Blair feared the poor boy had actually
died of terror; but he soon convinced himself that there was yet
motion in that heart which had throbbed so truly for him.</p>

<p>There was no sleep for Blair during that long wild night. In
the intensity of his excitement, his thoughts flew through his
mind with a vividness and a swiftness that made him almost feel
that he was tasting a new and higher kind of existence. Spiritual
things were as real to him as his own identity, and the God in
whom he trusted seemed at his side as a familiar friend. Of his
mother too he could think without a tear. He was sure that if
left childless, she would be comforted and sustained and gently
led along her lonely pathway. Had he not been fulfilling her oft-repeated
counsel, to fear nothing but sin? Had he not vindicated that love
of his native land, which she had taught him should be next to
his allegiance to God? She might never know his fate. Yet she
would mourn for him as for one who died in his effort to fulfil
the duties of his absent father, and risked his own life to save
the human freight of a ship from wreck and sure destruction.</p>

<p>Daylight brought but a feeble glimmer to Blair's dark prison-house,
yet he welcomed it as the assurance of dawn&mdash;dawn which is ever
welcome to the watcher, though it may usher in a day of double
danger.</p>
