<P>
WHEN the youth awoke it seemed to him that
he had been asleep for a thousand years, and he
felt sure that he opened his eyes upon an unex-
pected world.  Gray mists were slowly shifting
before the first efforts of the sun rays.  An im-
pending splendor could be seen in the eastern
sky.  An icy dew had chilled his face, and im-
mediately upon arousing he curled farther down
into his blanket.  He stared for a while at the
leaves overhead, moving in a heraldic wind of
the day.
<P>
The distance was splintering and blaring with
the noise of fighting.  There was in the sound
an expression of a deadly persistency, as if it had
not begun and was not to cease.
<P>
About him were the rows and groups of men
that he had dimly seen the previous night.  They
were getting a last draught of sleep before the
awakening.  The gaunt, careworn features and
dusty figures were made plain by this quaint
<P>

light at the dawning, but it dressed the skin of
the men in corpselike hues and made the tangled
limbs appear pulseless and dead.  The youth
started up with a little cry when his eyes first
swept over this motionless mass of men, thick-
spread upon the ground, pallid, and in strange
postures.  His disordered mind interpreted the
hall of the forest as a charnel place.  He believed
for an instant that he was in the house of the
dead, and he did not dare to move lest these
corpses start up, squalling and squawking.  In a
second, however, he achieved his proper mind.
He swore a complicated oath at himself.  He
saw that this somber picture was not a fact of
the present, but a mere prophecy.
<P>
He heard then the noise of a fire crackling
briskly in the cold air, and, turning his head, he
saw his friend pottering busily about a small
blaze.  A few other figures moved in the fog, and
he heard the hard cracking of axe blows.
<P>
Suddenly there was a hollow rumble of
drums.  A distant bugle sang faintly.  Similar
sounds, varying in strength, came from near and
far over the forest.  The bugles called to each
other like brazen gamecocks.  The near thunder
of the regimental drums rolled.
<P>
The body of men in the woods rustled.  There
was a general uplifting of heads.  A murmuring
of voices broke upon the air.  In it there was
much bass of grumbling oaths.  Strange gods
were addressed in condemnation of the early
hours necessary to correct war.  An officer's
peremptory tenor rang out and quickened the
stiffened movement of the men.  The tangled
limbs unraveled.  The corpse-hued faces were
hidden behind fists that twisted slowly in the eye
sockets.
<P>
The youth sat up and gave vent to an enormous
yawn.  "Thunder!" he remarked petulantly.
He rubbed his eyes, and then putting up his hand
felt carefully of the bandage over his wound.
His friend, perceiving him to be awake, came
from the fire.  "Well, Henry, ol' man, how do
yeh feel this mornin'?" he demanded.
<P>
The youth yawned again.  Then he puckered
his mouth to a little pucker.  His head, in truth,
felt precisely like a melon, and there was an un-
pleasant sensation at his stomach.
<P>
"Oh, Lord, I feel pretty bad," he said.
<P>
"Thunder!" exclaimed the other.  "I hoped
ye'd feel all right this mornin'.  Let's see th'
bandage--I guess it's slipped."  He began to
tinker at the wound in rather a clumsy way until
the youth exploded.
<P>
"Gosh-dern it!" he said in sharp irritation;
"you're the hangdest man I ever saw!  You
wear muffs on your hands.  Why in good
thunderation can't you be more easy?  I'd rather
you'd stand off an' throw guns at it.  Now, go
slow, an' don't act as if you was nailing down
carpet."
<P>
He glared with insolent command at his
friend, but the latter answered soothingly.
"Well, well, come now, an' git some grub," he
said.  "Then, maybe, yeh'll feel better."
<P>
At the fireside the loud young soldier
watched over his comrade's wants with tender-
ness and care.  He was very busy marshaling
the little black vagabonds of tin cups and pour-
ing into them the streaming, iron colored mixture
from a small and sooty tin pail.  He had some
fresh meat, which he roasted hurriedly upon a
stick.  He sat down then and contemplated the
youth's appetite with glee.
<P>
The youth took note of a remarkable change
in his comrade since those days of camp life upon
the river bank.  He seemed no more to be con-
tinually regarding the proportions of his personal
prowess.  He was not furious at small words that
pricked his conceits.  He was no more a loud
young soldier.  There was about him now a
fine reliance.  He showed a quiet belief in
his purposes and his abilities.  And this in-
ward confidence evidently enabled him to be
indifferent to little words of other men aimed
at him.
<P>
The youth reflected.  He had been used to
regarding his comrade as a blatant child with an
audacity grown from his inexperience, thought-
less, headstrong, jealous, and filled with a tinsel
courage.  A swaggering babe accustomed to strut
in his own dooryard.  The youth wondered
where had been born these new eyes; when his
comrade had made the great discovery that
there were many men who would refuse to be
subjected by him.  Apparently, the other had
now climbed a peak of wisdom from which he
could perceive himself as a very wee thing.  And
the youth saw that ever after it would be easier
to live in his friend's neighborhood.
<P>
His comrade balanced his ebony coffee-cup on
his knee.  "Well, Henry," he said, "what d'yeh
think th' chances are?  D'yeh think we'll wal-
lop 'em?"
<P>
The youth considered for a moment.  "Day-
b'fore-yesterday," he finally replied, with boldness,
"you would 'a' bet you'd lick the hull kit-an'-
boodle all by yourself."
<P>
His friend looked a trifle amazed.  "Would
I?" he asked.  He pondered.  "Well, perhaps I
would," he decided at last.  He stared humbly at
the fire.
<P>
The youth was quite disconcerted at this sur-
prising reception of his remarks.  "Oh, no, you
wouldn't either," he said, hastily trying to re-
trace.
<P>
But the other made a deprecating gesture.
"Oh, yeh needn't mind, Henry," he said.  "I be-
lieve I was a pretty big fool in those days."  He
spoke as after a lapse of years.
<P>
There was a little pause.
<P>
"All th' officers say we've got th' rebs in
a pretty tight box," said the friend, clearing
his throat in a commonplace way.  "They all
seem t' think we've got 'em jest where we
want 'em."
<P>
"I don't know about that," the youth replied.
"What I seen over on th' right makes me think
it was th' other way about.  From where I was,
it looked as if we was gettin' a good poundin'
yestirday."
<P>
"D'yeh think so?" inquired the friend.  "I
thought we handled 'em pretty rough yestir-
day."
<P>
"Not a bit," said the youth.  "Why, lord,
man, you didn't see nothing of the fight.  Why!"
Then a sudden thought came to him.  "Oh!
Jim Conklin's dead."
<P>
His friend started.  "What?  Is he?  Jim
Conklin?"
<P>
The youth spoke slowly.  "Yes.  He's dead.
Shot in th' side."
<P>
"Yeh don't say so.  Jim Conklin. . . . poor
cuss!"
<P>
All about them were other small fires sur-
rounded by men with their little black utensils.
From one of these near came sudden sharp
voices in a row.  It appeared that two light-
footed soldiers had been teasing a huge, bearded
man, causing him to spill coffee upon his blue
knees.  The man had gone into a rage and had
sworn comprehensively.  Stung by his language,
his tormentors had immediately bristled at him
with a great show of resenting unjust oaths.
Possibly there was going to be a fight.
<P>
The friend arose and went over to them, mak-
ing pacific motions with his arms.  "Oh, here,
now, boys, what's th' use?" he said.  "We'll
be at th' rebs in less'n an hour.  What's th'
good fightin' 'mong ourselves?"
<P>
One of the light-footed soldiers turned upon
him red-faced and violent.  "Yeh needn't come
around here with yer preachin'.  I s'pose yeh
don't approve 'a fightin' since Charley Morgan
licked yeh; but I don't see what business this
here is 'a yours or anybody else."
<P>
"Well, it ain't," said the friend mildly.  "Still
I hate t' see--"
<P>
There was a tangled argument.
<P>
"Well, he--," said the two, indicating their
opponent with accusative forefingers.
<P>
The huge soldier was quite purple with rage.
He pointed at the two soldiers with his great
hand, extended clawlike.  "Well, they--"
<P>
But during this argumentative time the de-
sire to deal blows seemed to pass, although they
said much to each other.  Finally the friend re-
turned to his old seat.  In a short while the
three antagonists could be seen together in an
amiable bunch.
<P>
"Jimmie Rogers ses I'll have t' fight him
after th' battle t'-day," announced the friend as
he again seated himself.  "He ses he don't
allow no interferin' in his business.  I hate t' see
th' boys fightin' 'mong themselves."
<P>
The youth laughed.  "Yer changed a good
bit.  Yeh ain't at all like yeh was.  I remember
when you an' that Irish feller--"  He stopped
and laughed again.
<P>
"No, I didn't use t' be that way," said his
friend thoughtfully.  "That's true 'nough."
<P>
"Well, I didn't mean--" began the youth.
<P>
The friend made another deprecatory gesture.
"Oh, yeh needn't mind, Henry."
<P>
There was another little pause.
<P>
"Th' reg'ment lost over half th' men yestir-
day," remarked the friend eventually.  "I thought
a course they was all dead, but, laws, they kep'
a-comin' back last night until it seems, after all,
we didn't lose but a few.  They'd been scattered
all over, wanderin' around in th' woods, fightin'
with other reg'ments, an' everything.  Jest like
you done."
<P>
"So?" said the youth.
