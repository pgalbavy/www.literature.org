<p>When Tim O'Rooney left the island and crossed to the eastern
shore of the Salinas he had almost forgotten the existence of
any such thing as hostile Indians. He was after something to eat,
and some how or other it seemed to him that the climate of California
had given him a most ravenous appetite, which demanded satisfaction
regardless of consequences.</p>

<p>Touching land, he pulled his canoe up the bank to prevent its
being carried away by the current, and then plunged boldly into
the forest. The land from the river rose quite rapidly until it
reached an elevation of several hundred feet, when it was broken
by gorges, ravines and chasms, which made it rattier difficult
to travel, and gave it an extremely wild and picturesque appearance.</p>

<p>Fairly among these broken hills, Tim began to look for his game,
but for a time saw nothing to draw his fire. Finally he reached
a wild-looking gorge which descended over a hundred feet below
him, while upon the opposite side it rose to a greater height
than the place upon which he stood.</p>

<p>The Irishman was so struck with the wild scenery that he stood
a few moments contemplating it in silent admiration, when all
at once he became conscious that something else beside himself
was engaged in looking. Directly across the gorge, so as to be
almost opposite to him, he saw the head of an animal which he
recognized at once as belonging to a black-tailed deer.</p>

<p>"Be the powers! but you're jist the gintleman that I'd like to
make an acquaintance with, as me mither said when me father axed
her hand in marriage."</p>

<p>Tim drew his rifle carefully and rested it upon a rock beside
him. The deer gazed at him with that expression of stupid wonder
which wild animals assume when confronted with something, and
they seem to be debating with themselves whether to leap away
at high speed or to stare a moment longer.</p>

<p>The distance was so slight that Tim was sure of his aim. Nevertheless,
he took great care in sighting his piece, and as his finger gently
pressed the trigger, he held his breath. The bullet sped true,
entering just below and between the eyes, and with such deadly
effect that the mortally wounded deer sprung several feet in the
air and fell dead within a rod of the spot where it had stood
when struck.</p>

<p>"That is plaisant," muttered the Irishman, as he saw the animal
fall, "and yez hav the distinguished honor of baing the first
deer that Tim O'Rooney brought down; but yez ain't the first he
fired at&mdash;but whist, Tim, don't be telling your secrets, for somebody
else might larn them."</p>

<p>He now began making his way carefully down the gorge in order
to ascend upon the opposite side and secure his prize. He had
no thought that the report of his gun could reach the ears of
hostile persons, and he did not heed anything except the place
and manner in which he put his feet in going down and up the ravine.</p>

<p>After no little toiling he reached the dead body, and found that
he had shot a rather small black-tailed deer. It was in middling
condition, and was the very prize he was anxious to secure for
his hungry self and equally hungry friends.</p>

<p>As he stood admiring it, for the first time the thought of personal
danger crossed his mind, and he glanced hurriedly around him,
but saw nothing to occasion alarm. Then he leaned forward and
gazed down the gorge, and as he did so he descried three Indians
looking up the side of the chasm. Slight as was the distance his
head projected, it was seen by them, and he only drew it back
to escape the effect of three discharges of their guns.</p>

<p>"And that is your shtyle of saluting a gintleman is it?" said
Tim in some trepidation. "But yez has a forcible way of saying
'how do yez do,' in this counthry, that a stranger would do well
to imitate."</p>

<p>The Irishman hastily debated with himself upon the best plan
to pursue to escape the serious peril that threatened him, for
he was sure the savages would follow up their shot.</p>

<p>"The best thing I can do is to lave," he concluded. "There is
strong raison for belaving that I've given some one slight offinse
by walking into their house without ringing the bell."</p>

<p>He stooped over and lifted his game. He found its weight somewhat
less than he had suspected.</p>

<p>"I have no objiction to your going wid me. If I has to have the
same dispute about ivery deer I tips over, I may as well hang
on to the fust one."</p>

<p>Slinging it over his shoulder, he began his return with the carcass.
It proved beneficial to him in a way that he had little suspected.
Not wishing to go any further down the gorge, where there was
reason to fear a collision with the savages, he clambered still
higher, taking great care to shield himself from observation from
below.</p>

<p>This made his labor excessive, and he was often obliged to pause
and rest himself. But at length he reached what might be termed
the brow of the hill, and began making his way along the edge
of a smaller ravine, that led toward the river. While thus engaged,
the body of the deer struck a projecting rock, and before Tim
could save himself he rolled over and over for a distance of twenty
odd feet, coming down plump upon the deer without injuring himself
in the least.</p>

<p>"I'm obliged to yez," he said, as he rose and stared around with
a bewildered air. "That was kind in yez, and I'll not forget the
favor."</p>

<p>Again raising his carcass to his shoulder, he resumed his journey
toward the river. But as he progressed the weight upon his shoulder
seemed to grow heavier, and he was obliged to pause and rest himself
quite often. On these occasions he looked around him half-expecting
to see the three savages spring out of the bushes.</p>

<p>If such a thing should occur, Tim had already decided upon his
mode of procedure. He intended to sink to the ground at once,
with the body of the deer as a sheltering breastwork, and make
as gallant fight as possible. His success in bringing down his
game, when it was fully fifty yards distant, gave him quite a
flattering estimate of his prowess.</p>

<p>The Indians, as the Irishman had anticipated, hastened up the
gorge to secure the daring hunter, who had so audaciously exposed
himself to their anger. It required some time for them to find
the exact spot where the deer had fallen, and when they did so,
they followed him readily by the blood which had trickled from
its drooping head, which as Tim bore his prize away he little
dreamed would betray the course he took.</p>

<p>When the point of Tim's fall was reached, all signs of his trail
ceased, and they supposed he had checked the flow of blood, and
thus concealed his tracks. The surface over which he traversed
being rock and flinty ground, left no evidence of his passage;
and resigning, therefore, the pursuit in this manner, they made
their way leisurely down to the river and waited until the hunter
appeared.</p>

<p>Tim's heart beat high with hope when he found himself close by
the stream and saw nothing of his pursuers. The hasty signal given
by Elwood Brandon, as we have shown, caused him some uneasiness,
but not being repeated, and being very anxious to get back to
the island, he placed the deer in the canoe and paddled away.</p>
