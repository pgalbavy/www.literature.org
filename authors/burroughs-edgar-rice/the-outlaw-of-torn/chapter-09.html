<P>
The visit of Bertrade de Montfort with her friend Mary de Stutevill was
drawing to a close.  Three weeks had passed since Roger de Conde had ridden
out from the portals of Stutevill and many times the handsome young
knight's name had been on the lips of his fair hostess and her fairer
friend.
<P>
Today the two girls roamed slowly through the gardens of the great court,
their arms about each other's waists, pouring the last confidences into
each other's ears, for tomorrow Bertrade had elected to return to
Leicester.
<P>
"Methinks thou be very rash indeed, my Bertrade," said Mary.  "Wert my
father here he would, I am sure, not permit thee to leave with only the
small escort which we be able to give."
<P>
"Fear not, Mary," replied Bertrade.  "Five of thy father's knights be ample
protection for so short a journey.  By evening it will have been
accomplished; and, as the only one I fear in these parts received such a
sound set back from Roger de Conde recently, I do not think he will venture
again to molest me."
<P>
"But what about the Devil of Torn, Bertrade ?" urged Mary.  "Only
yestereve, you wot, one of Lord de Grey's men-at-arms came limping to us
with the news of the awful carnage the foul fiend had wrought on his
master's household.  He be abroad, Bertrade, and I canst think of naught
more horrible than to fall into his hands."
<P>
"Why, Mary, thou didst but recently say thy very self that Norman of Torn
was most courteous to thee when he sacked this, thy father's castle.  How
be it thou so soon has changed thy mind ?"
<P>
"Yes, Bertrade, he was indeed respectful then, but who knows what horrid
freak his mind may take, and they do say that he be cruel beyond compare.
Again, forget not that thou be Leicester's daughter and Henry's niece;
against both of whom the Outlaw of Torn openly swears his hatred and his
vengeance.  Oh, Bertrade, wait but for a day or so, I be sure my father
must return ere then, and fifty knights shall accompany thee instead of
five."
<P>
"What be fifty knights against Norman of Torn, Mary ?  Thy reasoning is on
a parity with thy fears, both have flown wide of the mark.
<P>
"If I am to meet with this wild ruffian, it were better that five knights
were sacrificed than fifty, for either number would be but a mouthful to
that horrid horde of unhung murderers.  No, Mary, I shall start tomorrow
and your good knights shall return the following day with the best of word
from me."
<P>
"If thou wilst, thou wilst," cried Mary petulantly.  "Indeed it were plain
that thou be a De Montfort; that race whose historic bravery be second only
to their historic stubbornness."
<P>
Bertrade de Montfort laughed, and kissed her friend upon the cheek.
<P>
"Mayhap I shall find the brave Roger de Conde again upon the highroad to
protect me.  Then indeed shall I send back your five knights, for of a
truth, his blade is more powerful than that of any ten men I ere saw fight
before."
<P>
"Methinks," said Mary, still peeved at her friend's determination to leave
on the morrow, "that should you meet the doughty Sir Roger all unarmed,
that still would you send back my father's knights."
<P>
Bertrade flushed, and then bit her lip as she felt the warm blood mount to
her cheek.
<P>
"Thou be a fool, Mary," she said.
<P>
Mary broke into a joyful, teasing laugh; hugely enjoying the discomfiture
of the admission the tell-tale flush proclaimed.
<P>
"Ah, I did but guess how thy heart and thy mind tended, Bertrade; but now I
seest that I divined all too truly.  He be indeed good to look upon, but
what knowest thou of him ?"
<P>
"Hush, Mary !" commanded Bertrade.  "Thou know not what thou sayest.  I
would not wipe my feet upon him, I care naught whatever for him, and
then -- it has been three weeks since he rode out from Stutevill and no
word hath he sent."
<P>
"Oh, ho," cried the little plague, "so there lies the wind ?  My Lady would
not wipe her feet upon him, but she be sore vexed that he has sent her no
word.  Mon Dieu, but thou hast strange notions, Bertrade."
<P>
"I will not talk with you, Mary," cried Bertrade, stamping her sandaled
foot, and with a toss of her pretty head she turned abruptly toward the
castle.
<P>
In a small chamber in the castle of Colfax two men sat at opposite sides of
a little table.  The one, Peter of Colfax, was short and very stout.  His
red, bloated face, bleary eyes and bulbous nose bespoke the manner of his
life; while his thick lips, the lower hanging large and flabby over his
receding chin, indicated the base passions to which his life and been
given.  His companion was a little, grim, gray man but his suit of armor
and closed helm gave no hint to his host of whom his guest might be.  It
was the little armored man who was speaking.
<P>
"Is it not enough that I offer to aid you, Sir Peter," he said, "that you
must have my reasons ?  Let it go that my hate of Leicester be the passion
which moves me.  Thou failed in thy attempt to capture the maiden; give me
ten knights and I will bring her to you."
<P>
"How knowest thou she rides out tomorrow for her father's castle ?" asked
Peter of Colfax.
<P>
"That again be no concern of thine, my friend, but I do know it, and, if
thou wouldst have her, be quick, for we should ride out tonight that we may
take our positions by the highway in ample time tomorrow."
<P>
Still Peter of Colfax hesitated, he feared this might be a ruse of
Leicester's to catch him in some trap.  He did not know his guest -- the
fellow might want the girl for himself and be taking this method of
obtaining the necessary assistance to capture her.
<P>
"Come," said the little, armored man irritably.  "I cannot bide here
forever.  Make up thy mind; it be nothing to me other than my revenge, and
if thou wilst not do it, I shall hire the necessary ruffians and then not
even thou shalt see Bertrade de Montfort more."
<P>
This last threat decided the Baron.
<P>
"It is agreed," he said.  "The men shall ride out with you in half an
hour.  Wait below in the courtyard."
<P>
When the little man had left the apartment, Peter of Colfax summoned his
squire whom he had send to him at once one of his faithful henchmen.
<P>
"Guy," said Peter of Colfax, as the man entered, "ye made a rare fizzle of
a piece of business some weeks ago.  Ye wot of which I speak ?"
<P>
"Yes, My Lord."
<P>
"It chances that on the morrow ye may have opportunity to retrieve thy
blunder.  Ride out with ten men where the stranger who waits in the
courtyard below shall lead ye, and come not back without that which ye lost
to a handful of men before.  You understand ?"
<P>
"Yes, My Lord !"
<P>
"And, Guy, I half mistrust this fellow who hath offered to assist us.  At
the first sign of treachery, fall upon him with all thy men and slay him.
Tell the others that these be my orders."
<P>
"Yes, My Lord.  When do we ride ?"
<P>
"At once.  You may go."
<P>
The morning that Bertrade de Montfort had chosen to return to her father's
castle dawned gray and threatening.  In vain did Mary de Stutevill plead
with her friend to give up the idea of setting out upon such a dismal day
and without sufficient escort, but Bertrade de Montfort was firm.
<P>
"Already have I overstayed my time three days, and it is not lightly that
even I, his daughter, fail in obedience to Simon de Montfort.  I shall have
enough to account for as it be.  Do not urge me to add even one more day to
my excuses.  And again, perchance, my mother and my father may be sore
distressed by my continued absence.  No, Mary, I must ride today." And so
she did, with the five knights that could be spared from the castle's
defence.
<P>
Scarcely half an hour had elapsed before a cold drizzle set in, so that
they were indeed a sorry company that splashed along the muddy road,
wrapped in mantle and surcoat.  As they proceeded, the rain and wind
increased in volume, until it was being driven into their faces in such
blinding gusts that they must needs keep their eyes closed and trust to the
instincts of their mounts.
<P>
Less than half the journey had been accomplished.  They were winding across
a little hollow toward a low ridge covered with dense forest, into the
somber shadows of which the road wound.  There was a glint of armor among
the drenched foliage, but the rain-buffeted eyes of the riders saw it not.
On they came, their patient horses plodding slowly through the sticky road
and hurtling storm.
<P>
Now they were half way up the ridge's side.  There was a movement in the
dark shadows of the grim wood, and then, without cry or warning, a band of
steel-clad horsemen broke forth with couched spears.  Charging at full run
down upon them, they overthrew three of the girl's escort before a blow
could be struck in her defense.  Her two remaining guardians wheeled to
meet the return attack, and nobly did they acquit themselves, for it took
the entire eleven who were pitted against them to overcome and slay the
two.
<P>
In the melee, none had noticed the girl, but presently one of her
assailants, a little, grim, gray man, discovered that she had put spurs to
her palfrey and escaped.  Calling to his companions he set out at a rapid
pace in pursuit.
<P>
Reckless of the slippery road and the blinding rain, Bertrade de Montfort
urged her mount into a wild run, for she had recognized the arms of Peter
of Colfax on the shields of several of the attacking party.
<P>
Nobly, the beautiful Arab bent to her call for speed.  The great beasts of
her pursuers, bred in Normandy and Flanders, might have been tethered in
their stalls for all the chance they had of overtaking the flying white
steed that fairly split the gray rain as lightning flies through the
clouds.
<P>
But for the fiendish cunning of the little grim, gray man's foresight,
Bertrade de Montfort would have made good her escape that day.  As it was,
however, her fleet mount had carried her but two hundred yards ere, in the
midst of the dark wood, she ran full upon a rope stretched across the
roadway between two trees.
<P>
As the horse fell, with a terrible lunge, tripped by the stout rope,
Bertrade de Montfort was thrown far before him, where she lay, a little,
limp bedraggled figure, in the mud of the road.
<P>
There they found her.  The little, grim, gray man did not even dismount, so
indifferent was he to her fate; dead or in the hands of Peter of Colfax, it
was all the same to him.  In either event, his purpose would be
accomplished, and Bertrade de Montfort would no longer lure Norman of Torn
from the path he had laid out for him.
<P>
That such an eventuality threatened, he knew from one Spizo the Spaniard,
the single traitor in the service of Norman of Torn, whose mean aid the
little grim, gray man had purchased since many months to spy upon the
comings and goings of the great outlaw.
<P>
The men of Peter of Colfax gathered up the lifeless form of Bertrade de
Montfort and placed it across the saddle before one of their number.
<P>
"Come," said the man called Guy, "if there be life left in her, we must
hasten to Sir Peter before it be extinct."
<P>
"I leave ye here," said the little old man.  "My part of the business is
done."
<P>
And so he sat watching them until they had disappeared in the forest toward
the castle of Colfax.
<P>
Then he rode back to the scene of the encounter where lay the five knights
of Sir John de Stutevill.  Three were already dead, the other two, sorely
but not mortally wounded, lay groaning by the roadside.
<P>
The little grim, gray man dismounted as he came abreast of them and, with
his long sword, silently finished the two wounded men.  Then, drawing his
dagger, he made a mark upon the dead foreheads of each of the five, and
mounting, rode rapidly toward Torn.
<P>
"And if one fact be not enough," he muttered, "that mark upon the dead will
quite effectually stop further intercourse between the houses of Torn and
Leicester."
<P>
Henry de Montfort, son of Simon, rode fast and furious at the head of a
dozen of his father's knights on the road to Stutevill.
<P>
Bertrade de Montfort was so long overdue that the Earl and Princess
Eleanor, his wife, filled with grave apprehensions, had posted their oldest
son off to the castle of John de Stutevill to fetch her home.
<P>
With the wind and rain at their backs, the little party rode rapidly along
the muddy road, until late in the afternoon they came upon a white palfrey
standing huddled beneath a great oak, his arched back toward the driving
storm.
<P>
"By God," cried De Montfort, "tis my sister's own Abdul.  There be
something wrong here indeed." But a rapid search of the vicinity, and loud
calls brought no further evidence of the girl's whereabouts, so they
pressed on toward Stutevill.
<P>
Some two miles beyond the spot where the white palfrey had been found, they
came upon the dead bodies of the five knights who had accompanied Bertrade
from Stutevill.
<P>
Dismounting, Henry de Montfort examined the bodies of the fallen men.  The
arms upon shield and helm confirmed his first fear that these had been
Bertrade's escort from Stutevill.
<P>
As he bent over them to see if he recognized any of the knights, there
stared up into his face from the foreheads of the dead men the dreaded
sign, NT, scratched there with a dagger's point.
<P>
"The curse of God be on him !" cried De Montfort.  "It be the work of the
Devil of Torn, my gentlemen," he said to his followers.  "Come, we need no
further guide to our destination." And, remounting, the little party
spurred back toward Torn.
<P>
When Bertrade de Montfort regained her senses, she was in bed in a strange
room, and above her bent an old woman; a repulsive, toothless old woman,
whose smile was but a fangless snarl.
<P>
"Ho, ho !" she croaked.  "The bride waketh.  I told My Lord that it would
take more than a tumble in the mud to kill a De Montfort.  Come, come, now,
arise and clothe thyself, for the handsome bridegroom canst scarce restrain
his eager desire to fold thee in his arms.  Below in the great hall he
paces to and fro, the red blood mantling his beauteous countenance."
<P>
"Who be ye ?" cried Bertrade de Montfort, her mind still dazed from the
effects of her fall.  "Where am I ?" and then, "O, Mon Dieu !" as she
remembered the events of the afternoon; and the arms of Colfax upon the
shields of the attacking party.  In an instant she realized the horror of
her predicament; its utter hopelessness.
<P>
Beast though he was, Peter of Colfax stood high in the favor of the King;
and the fact that she was his niece would scarce aid her cause with Henry,
for it was more than counter-balanced by the fact that she was the daughter
of Simon de Montfort, whom he feared and hated.
<P>
In the corridor without, she heard the heavy tramp of approaching feet, and
presently a man's voice at the door.
<P>
"Within there, Coll !  Hast the damsel awakened from her swoon ?"
<P>
"Yes, Sir Peter," replied the old woman, "I was but just urging her to
arise and clothe herself, saying that you awaited her below."
<P>
"Haste then, My Lady Bertrade," called the man, "no harm will be done thee
if thou showest the good sense I give thee credit for.  I will await thee
in the great hall, or, if thou prefer, wilt come to thee here."
<P>
The girl paled, more in loathing and contempt than in fear, but the tones
of her answer were calm and level.
<P>
"I will see thee below, Sir Peter, anon," and rising, she hastened to
dress, while the receding footsteps of the Baron diminished down the
stairway which led from the tower room in which she was imprisoned.
<P>
The old woman attempted to draw her into conversation, but the girl would
not talk.  Her whole mind was devoted to weighing each possible means of
escape.
<P>
A half hour later, she entered the great hall of the castle of Peter of
Colfax.  The room was empty.  Little change had been wrought in the
apartment since the days of Ethelwolf.  As the girl's glance ranged the
hall in search of her jailer it rested upon the narrow, unglazed windows
beyond which lay freedom.  Would she ever again breathe God's pure air
outside these stifling walls ?  These grimy hateful walls !  Black as the
inky rafters and wainscot except for occasional splotches a few shades less
begrimed, where repairs had been made.  As her eyes fell upon the trophies
of war and chase which hung there her lips curled in scorn, for she knew
that they were acquisitions by inheritance rather than by the personal
prowess of the present master of Colfax.
<P>
A single cresset lighted the chamber, while the flickering light from a
small wood fire upon one of the two great hearths seemed rather to
accentuate the dim shadows of the place.
<P>
Bertrade crossed the room and leaned against a massive oak table, blackened
by age and hard usage to the color of the beams above, dented and nicked by
the pounding of huge drinking horns and heavy swords when wild and lusty
brawlers had been moved to applause by the lay of some wandering minstrel,
or the sterner call of their mighty chieftains for the oath of fealty.
<P>
Her wandering eyes took in the dozen benches and the few rude, heavy chairs
which completed the rough furnishings of this rough room, and she
shuddered.  One little foot tapped sullenly upon the disordered floor which
was littered with a miscellany of rushes interspread with such bones and
scraps of food as the dogs had rejected or overlooked.
<P>
But to none of these surroundings did Bertrade de Montfort give but passing
heed; she looked for the man she sought that she might quickly have the
encounter over and learn what fate the future held in store for her.
<P>
Her quick glance had shown her that the room was quite empty, and that in
addition to the main doorway at the lower end of the apartment, where she
had entered, there was but one other door leading from the hall.  This was
at one side, and as it stood ajar she could see that it led into a small
room, apparently a bedchamber.
<P>
As she stood facing the main doorway, a panel opened quietly behind her and
directly back of where the thrones had stood in past times.  From the black
mouth of the aperture stepped Peter of Colfax.  Silently, he closed the
panel after him, and with soundless steps, advanced toward the girl.  At
the edge of the raised dais he halted, rattling his sword to attract her
attention.
<P>
If his aim had been to unnerve her by the suddenness and mystery of his
appearance, he failed signally, for she did not even turn her head as she
said:
<P>
"What explanation hast thou to make, Sir Peter, for this base treachery
against thy neighbor's daughter and thy sovereign's niece ?"
<P>
"When fond hearts be thwarted by a cruel parent," replied the pot-bellied
old beast in a soft and fawning tone, "love must still find its way; and so
thy gallant swain hath dared the wrath of thy great father and majestic
uncle, and lays his heart at thy feet, O beauteous Bertrade, knowing full
well that thine hath been hungering after it since we didst first avow our
love to thy hard-hearted sire.  See, I kneel to thee, my dove !" And with
cracking joints the fat baron plumped down upon his marrow bones.
<P>
Bertrade turned and as she saw him her haughty countenance relaxed into a
sneering smile.
<P>
"Thou art a fool, Sir Peter," she said, "and, at that, the worst species of
fool -- an ancient fool.  It is useless to pursue thy cause, for I will
have none of thee.  Let me hence, if thou be a gentleman, and no word of
what hath transpired shall ever pass my lips.  But let me go, 'tis all I
ask, and it is useless to detain me for I cannot give what you would have.
I do not love you, nor ever can I."
<P>
Her first words had caused the red of humiliation to mottle his already
ruby visage to a semblance of purple, and now, as he attempted to rise with
dignity, he was still further covered with confusion by the fact that his
huge stomach made it necessary for him to go upon all fours before he could
rise, so that he got up much after the manner of a cow, raising his stern
high in air in a most ludicrous fashion.  As he gained his feet he saw the
girl turn her head from him to hide the laughter on her face.
<P>
"Return to thy chamber," he thundered.  "I will give thee until tomorrow to
decide whether thou wilt accept Peter of Colfax as thy husband, or take
another position in his household which will bar thee for all time from the
society of thy kind."
<P>
The girl turned toward him, the laugh still playing on her lips.
<P>
"I will be wife to no buffoon; to no clumsy old clown; to no debauched,
degraded parody of a man.  And as for thy other rash threat, thou hast not
the guts to put thy wishes into deeds, thou craven coward, for well ye know
that Simon de Montfort would cut out thy foul heart with his own hand if he
ever suspected thou wert guilty of speaking of such to me, his daughter."
And Bertrade de Montfort swept from the great hall, and mounted to her
tower chamber in the ancient Saxon stronghold of Colfax.
<P>
The old woman kept watch over her during the night and until late the
following afternoon, when Peter of Colfax summoned his prisoner before him
once more.  So terribly had the old hag played upon the girl's fears that
she felt fully certain that the Baron was quite equal to his dire threat,
and so she had again been casting about for some means of escape or delay.
<P>
The room in which she was imprisoned was in the west tower of the castle,
fully a hundred feet above the moat, which the single embrasure
overlooked.  There was, therefore, no avenue of escape in this direction.
The solitary door was furnished with huge oaken bars, and itself composed
of mighty planks of the same wood, cross barred with iron.
<P>
If she could but get the old woman out, thought Bertrade, she could
barricade herself within and thus delay, at least, her impending fate in
the hope that succor might come from some source.  But her most subtle
wiles proved ineffectual in ridding her, even for a moment, of her harpy
jailer; and now that the final summons had come, she was beside herself for
a lack of means to thwart her captor.
<P>
Her dagger had been taken from her, but one hung from the girdle of the old
woman and this Bertrade determined to have.
<P>
Feigning trouble with the buckle of her own girdle, she called upon the old
woman to aid her, and as the hag bent her head close to the girl's body to
see what was wrong with the girdle clasp, Bertrade reached quickly to her
side and snatched the weapon from its sheath.  Quickly she sprang back from
the old woman who, with a cry of anger and alarm, rushed upon her.
<P>
"Back !" cried the girl.  "Stand back, old hag, or thou shalt feel the
length of thine own blade."
<P>
The woman hesitated and then fell to cursing and blaspheming in a most
horrible manner, at the same time calling for help.
<P>
Bertrade backed to the door, commanding the old woman to remain where she
was, on pain of death, and quickly dropped the mighty bars into place.
Scarcely had the last great bolt been slipped than Peter of Colfax, with a
dozen servants and men-at-arms, were pounding loudly upon the outside.
<P>
"What's wrong within, Coll," cried the Baron.
<P>
"The wench has wrested my dagger from me and is murdering me," shrieked the
old woman.
<P>
"An' that I will truly do, Peter of Colfax," spoke Bertrade, "if you do not
immediately send for my friends to conduct me from thy castle, for I will
not step my foot from this room until I know that mine own people stand
without."
<P>
Peter of Colfax pled and threatened, commanded and coaxed, but all in
vain.  So passed the afternoon, and as darkness settled upon the castle the
Baron desisted from his attempts, intending to starve his prisoner out.
<P>
Within the little room, Bertrade de Montfort sat upon a bench guarding her
prisoner, from whom she did not dare move her eyes for a single second.
All that long night she sat thus, and when morning dawned, it found her
position unchanged, her tired eyes still fixed upon the hag.
<P>
Early in the morning, Peter of Colfax resumed his endeavors to persuade her
to come out; he even admitted defeat and promised her safe conduct to her
father's castle, but Bertrade de Montfort was not one to be fooled by his
lying tongue.
<P>
"Then will I starve you out," he cried at length.
<P>
"Gladly will I starve in preference to falling into thy foul hands,"
replied the girl.  "But thy old servant here will starve first, for she be
very old and not so strong as I.  Therefore, how will it profit you to kill
two and still be robbed of thy prey ?"
<P>
Peter of Colfax entertained no doubt but that his fair prisoner would carry
out her threat and so he set his men to work with cold chisels, axes and
saws upon the huge door.
<P>
For hours, they labored upon that mighty work of defence, and it was late
at night ere they made a little opening large enough to admit a hand and
arm, but the first one intruded within the room to raise the bars was drawn
quickly back with a howl of pain from its owner.  Thus the keen dagger in
the girl's hand put an end to all hopes of entering without completely
demolishing the door.
<P>
To this work, the men without then set themselves diligently while Peter of
Colfax renewed his entreaties, through the small opening they had made.
Bertrade replied but once.
<P>
"Seest thou this poniard ?" she asked.  "When that door falls, this point
enters my heart.  There is nothing beyond that door, with thou, poltroon,
to which death in this little chamber would not be preferable."
<P>
As she spoke, she turned toward the man she was addressing, for the first
time during all those weary, hideous hours removing her glance from the old
hag.  It was enough.  Silently, but with the quickness of a tigress the old
woman was upon her back, one claw-like paw grasping the wrist which held
the dagger.
<P>
"Quick, My Lord !" she shrieked, "the bolts, quick."
<P>
Instantly Peter of Colfax ran his arm through the tiny opening in the door
and a second later four of his men rushed to the aid of the old woman.
<P>
Easily they wrested the dagger from Bertrade's fingers, and at the Baron's
bidding, they dragged her to the great hall below.
<P>
As his retainers left the room at his command, Peter of Colfax strode back
and forth upon the rushes which strewed the floor.  Finally he stopped
before the girl standing rigid in the center of the room.
<P>
"Hast come to thy senses yet, Bertrade de Montfort ?" he asked angrily.  "I
have offered you your choice; to be the honored wife of Peter of Colfax,
or, by force, his mistress.  The good priest waits without, what be your
answer now ?"
<P>
"The same as it has been these past two days," she replied with haughty
scorn.  "The same that it shall always be.  I will be neither wife nor
mistress to a coward; a hideous, abhorrent pig of a man.  I would die, it
seems, if I felt the touch of your hand upon me.  You do not dare to touch
me, you craven.  I, the daughter of an earl, the niece of a king, wed to
the warty toad, Peter of Colfax !"
<P>
"Hold, chit !" cried the Baron, livid with rage.  "You have gone too far.
Enough of this; and you love me not now, I shall learn you to love ere the
sun rises." And with a vile oath he grasped the girl roughly by the arm,
and dragged her toward the little doorway at the side of the room.
