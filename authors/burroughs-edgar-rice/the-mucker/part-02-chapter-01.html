<p>BILLY BYRNE squared his broad shoulders and filled his deep lungs with
the familiar medium which is known as air in Chicago. He was standing
upon the platform of a New York Central train that was pulling into the
La Salle Street Station, and though the young man was far from happy
something in the nature of content pervaded his being, for he was coming
home.
</p>
<p>After something more than a year of world wandering and strange
adventure Billy Byrne was coming back to the great West Side and Grand
Avenue.
</p><p>Now there is not much upon either side or down the center of long and
tortuous Grand Avenue to arouse enthusiasm, nor was Billy particularly
enthusiastic about that more or less squalid thoroughfare.
</p><p>The thing that exalted Billy was the idea that he was coming back to
SHOW THEM. He had left under a cloud and with a reputation for genuine
toughness and rowdyism that has seen few parallels even in the ungentle
district of his birth and upbringing.
</p><p>A girl had changed him. She was as far removed from Billy's sphere as
the stars themselves; but Billy had loved her and learned from her, and
in trying to become more as he knew the men of her class were he had
sloughed off much of the uncouthness that had always been a part of him,
and all of the rowdyism. Billy Byrne was no longer the mucker.
</p><p>He had given her up because he imagined the gulf between Grand Avenue
and Riverside Drive to be unbridgeable; but he still clung to the ideals
she had awakened in him. He still sought to be all that she might wish
him to be, even though he realized that he never should see her again.
</p><p>Grand Avenue would be the easiest place to forget his sorrow--her he
could never forget. And then, his newly awakened pride urged him back to
the haunts of his former life that he might, as he would put it himself,
show them. He wanted the gang to see that he, Billy Byrne, wasn't afraid
to be decent. He wanted some of the neighbors to realize that he could
work steadily and earn an honest living, and he looked forward with
delight to the pleasure and satisfaction of rubbing it in to some of the
saloon keepers and bartenders who had helped keep him drunk some five
days out of seven, for Billy didn't drink any more.
</p><p>But most of all he wanted to vindicate himself in the eyes of the
once-hated law. He wanted to clear his record of the unjust charge of
murder which had sent him scurrying out of Chicago over a year before,
that night that Patrolman Stanley Lasky of the Lake Street Station had
tipped him off that Sheehan had implicated him in the murder of old man
Schneider.
</p><p>Now Billy Byrne had not killed Schneider. He had been nowhere near the
old fellow's saloon at the time of the holdup; but Sheehan, who had been
arrested and charged with the crime, was an old enemy of Billy's, and
Sheehan had seen a chance to divert some of the suspicion from himself
and square accounts with Byrne at the same time.
</p><p>The new Billy Byrne was ready to accept at face value everything which
seemed to belong in any way to the environment of that exalted realm
where dwelt the girl he loved. Law, order, and justice appeared to Billy
in a new light since he had rubbed elbows with the cultured and refined.
</p><p>He no longer distrusted or feared them. They would give him what he
sought--a square deal.
</p><p>It seemed odd to Billy that he should be seeking anything from the law
or its minions. For years he had waged a perpetual battle with both. Now
he was coming back voluntarily to give himself up, with every conviction
that he should be exonerated quickly. Billy, knowing his own innocence,
realizing his own integrity, assumed that others must immediately
appreciate both.
</p><p>“First,” thought Billy, “I'll go take a look at little old Grand Ave.,
then I'll give myself up. The trial may take a long time, an' if it does
I want to see some of the old bunch first.”
</p><p>So Billy entered an “L” coach and leaning on the sill of an open
window watched grimy Chicago rattle past until the guard's “Granavenoo”
 announced the end of his journey.
</p><p>Maggie Shane was sitting on the upper step of the long flight of stairs
which lean precariously against the scarred face of the frame residence
upon the second floor front of which the lares and penates of the Shane
family are crowded into three ill-smelling rooms.
</p><p>It was Saturday and Maggie was off. She sat there rather disconsolate
for there was a dearth of beaux for Maggie, none having arisen to fill
the aching void left by the sudden departure of “Coke” Sheehan since
that worthy gentleman had sought a more salubrious clime--to the
consternation of both Maggie Shane and Mr. Sheehan's bondsmen.
</p><p>Maggie scowled down upon the frowsy street filled with frowsy women and
frowsy children. She scowled upon the street cars rumbling by with their
frowsy loads. Occasionally she varied the monotony by drawing out her
chewing gum to wondrous lengths, holding one end between a thumb and
finger and the other between her teeth.
</p><p>Presently Maggie spied a rather pleasing figure sauntering up the
sidewalk upon her side of the street. The man was too far away for
her to recognize his features, but his size and bearing and general
appearance appealed to the lonesome Maggie. She hoped it was someone she
knew, or with whom she might easily become acquainted, for Maggie was
bored to death.
</p><p>She patted the hair at the back of her head and righted the mop which
hung over one eye. Then she rearranged her skirts and waited. As the man
approached she saw that he was better looking than she had even dared
to hope, and that there was something extremely familiar about his
appearance. It was not, though, until he was almost in front of the
house that he looked up at the girl and she recognized him.
</p><p>Then Maggie Shane gasped and clutched the handrail at her side.
An instant later the man was past and continuing his way along the
sidewalk.
</p><p>Maggie Shane glared after him for a minute, then she ran quickly down
the stairs and into a grocery store a few doors west, where she asked if
she might use the telephone.
</p><p>“Gimme West 2063,” she demanded of the operator, and a moment later: “Is
this Lake Street?”
</p><p>“Well say, Billy Byrne's back. I just see him.”
</p><p>“Yes an' never mind who I am; but if youse guys want him he's walkin'
west on Grand Avenoo right now. I just this minute seen him near
Lincoln,” and she smashed the receiver back into its hook.
</p><p>Billy Byrne thought that he would look in on his mother, not that he
expected to be welcomed even though she might happen to be sober, or
not that he cared to see her; but Billy's whole manner of thought had
altered within the year, and something now seemed to tell him that it
was his duty to do the thing he contemplated. Maybe he might even be of
help to her.
</p><p>But when he reached the gloomy neighborhood in which his childhood had
been spent it was to learn that his mother was dead and that another
family occupied the tumble-down cottage that had been his home.
</p><p>If Billy Byrne felt any sorrow because of his mother's death he did
not reveal it outwardly. He owed her nothing but for kicks and cuffs
received, and for the surroundings and influences that had started him
upon a life of crime at an age when most boys are just entering grammar
school.
</p><p>Really the man was relieved that he had not had to see her, and it was
with a lighter step that he turned back to retrace his way along Grand
Avenue. No one of the few he had met who recognized him had seemed
particularly delighted at his return. The whole affair had been
something of a disappointment. Therefore Billy determined to go at once
to the Lake Street Station and learn the status of the Schneider murder
case. Possibly they had discovered the real murderer, and if that was
the case Billy would be permitted to go his way; but if not then he
could give himself up and ask for a trial, that he might be exonerated.
</p><p>As he neared Wood Street two men who had been watching his approach
stepped into the doorway of a saloon, and as he passed they stepped out
again behind him. One upon either side they seized him.
</p><p>Billy turned to remonstrate.
</p><p>“Come easy now, Byrne,” admonished one of the men, “an' don't make no
fuss.”
</p><p>“Oh,” said Billy, “it's you, is it? Well, I was just goin' over to the
station to give myself up.”
</p><p>Both men laughed, skeptically. “We'll just save you the trouble,” said
one of them. “We'll take you over. You might lose your way if you tried
to go alone.”
</p><p>Billy went along in silence the rest of the way to where the patrol
waited at another corner. He saw there was nothing to be gained by
talking to these detectives; but he found the lieutenant equally
inclined to doubt his intentions. He, too, only laughed when Billy
assured him that he was on his way to the station at the very instant of
arrest.
</p><p>As the weeks dragged along, and Billy Byrne found no friendly interest
in himself or his desire to live on the square, and no belief in his
protestations that he had had naught to do with the killing of Schneider
he began to have his doubts as to the wisdom of his act.
</p><p>He also commenced to entertain some of his former opinions of the
police, and of the law of which they are supposed to be the guardians. A
cell-mate told him that the papers had scored the department heavily
for their failure to apprehend the murderer of the inoffensive old
Schneider, and that public opinion had been so aroused that a general
police shakeup had followed.
</p><p>The result was that the police were keen to fasten the guilt upon
someone--they did not care whom, so long as it was someone who was in
their custody.
</p><p>“You may not o' done it,” ventured the cell-mate; “but they'll send you
up for it, if they can't hang you. They're goin' to try to get the death
sentence. They hain't got no love for you, Byrne. You caused 'em a lot
o' throuble in your day an' they haven't forgot it. I'd hate to be in
your boots.”
</p><p>Billy Byrne shrugged. Where were his dreams of justice? They seemed to
have faded back into the old distrust and hatred. He shook himself and
conjured in his mind the vision of a beautiful girl who had believed in
him and trusted him--who had inculcated within him a love for all that
was finest and best in true manhood, for the very things that he had
most hated all the years of his life before she had come into his
existence to alter it and him.
</p><p>And then Billy would believe again--believe that in the end justice
would triumph and that it would all come out right, just the way he had
pictured it.
</p><p>With the coming of the last day of the trial Billy found it more and
more difficult to adhere to his regard for law, order, and justice. The
prosecution had shown conclusively that Billy was a hard customer. The
police had brought witnesses who did not hesitate to perjure themselves
in their testimony--testimony which it seemed to Billy the densest of
jurymen could plainly see had been framed up and learned by rote until
it was letter-perfect.
</p><p>These witnesses could recall with startling accuracy every detail
that had occurred between seventeen minutes after eight and twenty-one
minutes past nine on the night of September 23 over a year before; but
where they had been and what they had done ten minutes earlier or ten
minutes later, or where they were at nine o'clock in the evening last
Friday they couldn't for the lives of them remember.
</p><p>And Billy was practically without witnesses.
</p><p>The result was a foregone conclusion. Even Billy had to admit it, and
when the prosecuting attorney demanded the death penalty the prisoner
had an uncanny sensation as of the tightening of a hempen rope about his
neck.
</p><p>As he waited for the jury to return its verdict Billy sat in his cell
trying to read a newspaper which a kindly guard had given him. But his
eyes persisted in boring through the white paper and the black type to
scenes that were not in any paper. He saw a turbulent river tumbling
through a savage world, and in the swirl of the water lay a little
island. And he saw a man there upon the island, and a girl. The girl was
teaching the man to speak the language of the cultured, and to view life
as people of refinement view it.
</p><p>She taught him what honor meant among her class, and that it was better
to lose any other possession rather than lose honor. Billy realized that
it had been these lessons that had spurred him on to the mad scheme that
was to end now with the verdict of “Guilty”--he had wished to vindicate
his honor. A hard laugh broke from his lips; but instantly he sobered
and his face softened.
</p><p>It had been for her sake after all, and what mattered it if they did
send him to the gallows? He had not sacrificed his honor--he had done
his best to assert it. He was innocent. They could kill him but they
couldn't make him guilty. A thousand juries pronouncing him so could not
make it true that he had killed Schneider.
</p><p>But it would be hard, after all his hopes, after all the plans he had
made to live square, to SHOW THEM. His eyes still boring through the
paper suddenly found themselves attracted by something in the text
before them--a name, Harding.
</p><p>Billy Byrne shook himself and commenced to read:
</p>
<p>The marriage of Barbara, daughter of Anthony Harding, the
multimillionaire, to William Mallory will take place on the twenty-fifth
of June.
</p>
<p>The article was dated New York. There was more, but Billy did not
read it. He had read enough. It is true that he had urged her to marry
Mallory; but now, in his lonesomeness and friendlessness, he felt almost
as though she had been untrue to him.
</p><p>“Come along, Byrne,” a bailiff interrupted his thoughts, “the jury's
reached a verdict.”
</p><p>The judge was emerging from his chambers as Billy was led into the
courtroom. Presently the jury filed in and took their seats. The foreman
handed the clerk a bit of paper. Even before it was read Billy knew
that he had been found guilty. He did not care any longer, so he told
himself. He hoped that the judge would send him to the gallows. There
was nothing more in life for him now anyway. He wanted to die. But
instead he was sentenced to life imprisonment in the penitentiary at
Joliet.
</p><p>This was infinitely worse than death. Billy Byrne was appalled at the
thought of remaining for life within the grim stone walls of a prison.
Once more there swept over him all the old, unreasoning hatred of the
law and all that pertained to it. He would like to close his steel
fingers about the fat neck of the red-faced judge. The smug jurymen
roused within him the lust to kill. Justice! Billy Byrne laughed aloud.
</p><p>A bailiff rapped for order. One of the jurymen leaned close to a
neighbor and whispered. “A hardened criminal,” he said. “Society will be
safer when he is behind the bars.”
</p><p>The next day they took Billy aboard a train bound for Joliet. He was
handcuffed to a deputy sheriff. Billy was calm outwardly; but inwardly
he was a raging volcano of hate.
</p>
<p>In a certain very beautiful home on Riverside Drive, New York City,
a young lady, comfortably backed by downy pillows, sat in her bed and
alternated her attention between coffee and rolls, and a morning paper.
</p><p>On the inside of the main sheet a heading claimed her languid attention:
CHICAGO MURDERER GIVEN LIFE SENTENCE. Of late Chicago had aroused in
Barbara Harding a greater proportion of interest than ever it had in the
past, and so it was that she now permitted her eyes to wander casually
down the printed column.
</p>
<p>Murderer of harmless old saloon keeper is finally brought to justice.
The notorious West Side rowdy, “Billy” Byrne, apprehended after more
than a year as fugitive from justice, is sent to Joliet for life.
</p>
<p>Barbara Harding sat stony-eyed and cold for what seemed many minutes.
Then with a stifled sob she turned and buried her face in the pillows.
</p><p>The train bearing Billy Byrne and the deputy sheriff toward Joliet had
covered perhaps half the distance between Chicago and Billy's permanent
destination when it occurred to the deputy sheriff that he should like
to go into the smoker and enjoy a cigar.
</p><p>Now, from the moment that he had been sentenced Billy Byrne's mind had
been centered upon one thought--escape. He knew that there probably
would be not the slightest chance for escape; but nevertheless the idea
was always uppermost in his thoughts.
</p><p>His whole being revolted, not alone against the injustice which had
sent him into life imprisonment, but at the thought of the long years of
awful monotony which lay ahead of him.
</p><p>He could not endure them. He would not! The deputy sheriff rose, and
motioning his prisoner ahead of him, started for the smoker. It was two
cars ahead. The train was vestibuled. The first platform they crossed
was tightly enclosed; but at the second Billy saw that a careless porter
had left one of the doors open. The train was slowing down for some
reason--it was going, perhaps, twenty miles an hour.
</p><p>Billy was the first upon the platform. He was the first to see the open
door. It meant one of two things--a chance to escape, or, death. Even
the latter was to be preferred to life imprisonment.
</p><p>Billy did not hesitate an instant. Even before the deputy sheriff
realized that the door was open, his prisoner had leaped from the moving
train dragging his guard after him.
