<p> We four formed (to use a term well understood nowadays in every
social sphere) a "syndicate" owning the <em>Tremolino</em>: an
international and astonishing syndicate.  And we were all ardent
Royalists of the snow-white Legitimist complexion—Heaven only
knows why!  In all associations of men there is generally one
who, by the authority of age and of a more experienced wisdom,
imparts a collective character to the whole set.  If I mention
that the oldest of us was very old, extremely old—nearly thirty
years old—and that he used to declare with gallant carelessness,
"I live by my sword," I think I have given enough information
on the score of our collective wisdom.  He was a North Carolinian
gentleman, J. M. K. B. were the initials of his name, and he really
did live by the sword, as far as I know.  He died by it, too,
later on, in a Balkanian squabble, in the cause of some Serbs
or else Bulgarians, who were neither Catholics nor gentlemen—at
least, not in the exalted but narrow sense he attached to that
last word.</p>

<p>Poor J. M. K. B., <em>Américain</em>, <em>Catholique</em>, <em>et
gentilhomme</em>, as he was disposed to describe himself in moments
of lofty expansion!  Are there still to be found in Europe gentlemen
keen of face and elegantly slight of body, of distinguished aspect,
with a fascinating drawing-room manner and with a dark, fatal
glance, who live by their swords, I wonder?  His family had been
ruined in the Civil War, I fancy, and seems for a decade or so
to have led a wandering life in the Old World.  As to Henry C—,
the next in age and wisdom of our band, he had broken loose from
the unyielding rigidity of his family, solidly rooted, if I remember
rightly, in a well-to-do London suburb.  On their respectable
authority he introduced himself meekly to strangers as a "black
sheep."  I have never seen a more guileless specimen of an outcast. 
Never.</p>

<p>However, his people had the grace to send him a little money
now and then.  Enamoured of the South, of Provence, of its people,
its life, its sunshine and its poetry, narrow-chested, tall and
short-sighted, he strode along the streets and the lanes, his
long feet projecting far in advance of his body, and his white
nose and gingery moustache buried in an open book: for he had
the habit of reading as he walked.  How he avoided falling into
precipices, off the quays, or down staircases is a great mystery. 
The sides of his overcoat bulged out with pocket editions of various
poets.  When not engaged in reading Virgil, Homer, or Mistral,
in parks, restaurants, streets, and suchlike public places, he
indited sonnets (in French) to the eyes, ears, chin, hair, and
other visible perfections of a nymph called Thérèse, the daughter,
honesty compels me to state, of a certain Madame Leonore who kept
a small café for sailors in one of the narrowest streets of the
old town.</p>

<p>No more charming face, clear-cut like an antique gem, and delicate
in colouring like the petal of a flower, had ever been set on,
alas! a somewhat squat body.  He read his verses aloud to her
in the very café with the innocence of a little child and the
vanity of a poet.  We followed him there willingly enough, if
only to watch the divine Thérèse laugh, under the vigilant black
eyes of Madame Leonore, her mother.  She laughed very prettily,
not so much at the sonnets, which she could not but esteem, as
at poor Henry’s French accent, which was unique, resembling the
warbling of birds, if birds ever warbled with a stuttering, nasal
intonation.</p>

<p>Our third partner was Roger P. de la S—, the most Scandinavian-looking
of Provençal squires, fair, and six feet high, as became a descendant
of sea-roving Northmen, authoritative, incisive, wittily scornful,
with a comedy in three acts in his pocket, and in his breast a
heart blighted by a hopeless passion for his beautiful cousin,
married to a wealthy hide and tallow merchant.  He used to take
us to lunch at their house without ceremony.  I admired the good
lady’s sweet patience.  The husband was a conciliatory soul, with
a great fund of resignation, which he expended on "Roger’s friends." 
I suspect he was secretly horrified at these invasions.  But it
was a Carlist salon, and as such we were made welcome. The possibility
of raising Catalonia in the interest of the <em>Rey netto</em>,
who had just then crossed the Pyrenees, was much discussed there.</p>

<p>Don Carlos, no doubt, must have had many queer friends (it is
the common lot of all Pretenders), but amongst them none more
extravagantly fantastic than the <em>Tremolino</em> Syndicate,
which used to meet in a tavern on the quays of the old port. 
The antique city of Massilia had surely never, since the days
of the earliest Phoenicians, known an odder set of ship-owners. 
We met to discuss and settle the plan of operations for each voyage
of the <em>Tremolino</em>.  In these operations a banking-house,
too, was concerned—a very respectable banking-house.  But I am
afraid I shall end by saying too much.  Ladies, too, were concerned
(I am really afraid I am saying too much)—all sorts of ladies,
some old enough to know better than to put their trust in princes,
others young and full of illusions.</p>

<p>One of these last was extremely amusing in the imitations, she
gave us in confidence, of various highly-placed personages she
was perpetually rushing off to Paris to interview in the interests
of the cause—<em>Por el Rey</em>!  For she was a Carlist, and
of Basque blood at that, with something of a lioness in the expression
of her courageous face (especially when she let her hair down),
and with the volatile little soul of a sparrow dressed in fine
Parisian feathers, which had the trick of coming off disconcertingly
at unexpected moments.</p>

<p>But her imitations of a Parisian personage, very highly placed
indeed, as she represented him standing in the corner of a room
with his face to the wall, rubbing the back of his head and moaning
helplessly, "Rita, you are the death of me!" were enough to make
one (if young and free from cares) split one’s sides laughing. 
She had an uncle still living, a very effective Carlist, too,
the priest of a little mountain parish in Guipuzcoa.  As the sea-going
member of the syndicate (whose plans depended greatly on Doña
Rita’s information), I used to be charged with humbly affectionate
messages for the old man.  These messages I was supposed to deliver
to the Arragonese muleteers (who were sure to await at certain
times the <em>Tremolino</em> in the neighbourhood of the Gulf
of Rosas), for faithful transportation inland, together with the
various unlawful goods landed secretly from under the <em>Tremolino’s</em>
hatches.</p>

<p>Well, now, I have really let out too much (as I feared I should
in the end) as to the usual contents of my sea-cradle.  But let
it stand.  And if anybody remarks cynically that I must have been
a promising infant in those days, let that stand, too.  I am concerned
but for the good name of the <em>Tremolino</em>, and I affirm
that a ship is ever guiltless of the sins, transgressions, and
follies of her men.</p>
