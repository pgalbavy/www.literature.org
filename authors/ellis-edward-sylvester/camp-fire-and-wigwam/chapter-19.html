<p>Neither Deerfoot nor the trapper wished to engage in the trial
of skill suggested by Burt Hawkins. Crumpet feared that if such
a test took place he would be worsted, in which event he would
never hear the last of it from his friends. He might well shrink,
therefore, from such a contest.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe knew he could surpass the trapper if he exerted
himself, as he most certainly would do. Crumpet's ill-nature would
be embittered, and matters were likely to take an unpleasant shape.
When Hawkins turned toward him, therefore, expecting him to bound
to his feet and invite the challenge, he shook his head:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot's arrows are few, and he saves them for game or his
enemies."</p>

<p>"And therein is wise," added Kellogg, shrewd enough to see the
situation in all its bearings.</p>

<p>Crumpet said nothing, but was greatly relieved, while Hawkins
gave a sniff of disgust.</p>

<p>"Some folks are very free with their tongues, but when you come
down to business they ain't there; howsumever, let that go; we've
got our extra rifle, and I s'pose we might as well keep up the
tramp toward St. Louis. Deerfoot, can't you go with us?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, and said:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is hunting for two friends who are lost; he must not
sleep nor tarry on the way."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Burt, while the others listened with interest.
The young Shawanoe told, in his characteristic manner, the story
which is already well known to the reader. While doing so he watched
each countenance closely, hoping (though he could give no reason
for such hope) to catch some sign of a shadowy knowledge of that
for which he was seeking, but he was disappointed.</p>

<p>"One thing is sartin," remarked Burt Hawkins, when the story
was fully told, "them boys ain't dead."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said Kellogg, with an emphatic nod of the
head, in which even the surly Crumpet joined. Deerfoot was surprised
at this unanimity, and inquired of Hawkins his reason for his
belief.</p>

<p>"'Cause it's agin common sense; when two young men go out in
the woods to hunt game, both of 'em ain't going to get killed:
that isn't the fashion now-a-days. One of 'em might be hurt, but
if that was so, and the other couldn't get away, the Injins would
take him off and keep him. More than likely the varmints carried
away both, and if you make a good hunt for three or four thousand
miles around, you'll get track of 'em."</p>

<p>"I think I know a better plan than that," said Kellogg, and,
as the others looked inquiringly toward him, he said, "both of
them chaps have been took by Injins who'll keep them awhile. One
of these days the boys will find a chance to give 'em the slip,
and they'll leave on some dark night and strike for home."</p>

<p>"It isn't likely both 'll have a show to do that at the same
time," said Crumpet, speaking with more courtesy than he had yet
shown, and manifesting much interest in the matter.</p>

<p>"No; one will have to leave a good while before the other, and
then the one that is left will be watched that much sharper, but
all he's got to do is to bide his time."</p>

<p>"When one of my brothers comes through the woods to his home,
the other will come with him," said Deerfoot, confident as he
was that neither Jack Carleton nor Otto Relstaub would desert
the other, when placed in any kind of danger.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was confirmed in his theory of the disappearance of
his young friends, for it agreed with what he had formed after
leaving the settlement that morning. But, admitting it was the
correct theory, the vast difficulty of locating the boys still
confronted him. They might be journeying far southward in the
land of the Creeks and Chickasaws, or to the homes of the Dacotah
in the frozen north, or westward toward the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Kellogg and Crumpet now fell into an earnest discussion of the
question, for, though agreeing in the main, they differed on minor
points, in which each was persistent in his views. Deerfoot listened
to every word, for, like a wise man, he was anxious to gain all
the knowledge he could from others.</p>

<p>But he noticed that for several minutes Burt Hawkins took no
part in the conversation. He had sat down again on the log, thrown
one leg over another, and was slowly stroking his handsome beard,
while his gaze was fixed on the ground in front. He was evidently
in deep thought.</p>

<p>Such was the fact, and just as the lull came, he reached his
conclusion. Deliberately rising to his full height, he walked
over to where Deerfoot stood, and with another slap on his shoulder,
said:</p>

<p>"See here, young man!"</p>

<p>The warrior faced him, earnest, attentive, and interested. Burt
shifted the weight of his body, so that it rested on his right
leg; he looked down in the eyes of Deerfoot, his brow wrinkled
as in the case when a man is about to deliver himself of the most
important and original thoughts of his life. Then he began wabbling
the index finger of his right hand in the face of the warrior,
as a man with the important and original thought is inclined to
do. He commenced to wabble quite slowly, gradually increasing
the amplitude of the vibrations, and passing his finger so close
to the countenance of the Shawanoe that it seemed almost to graze
the end of his nose. He spoke slowly, pointing his words with
his swaying finger:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot, I've got the question answered; listen to me: them
boys have been tooken away by Injins; I know it; now where have
the Injins gone? You ought to know as much about your race as
me, but you don't; do what I tell you; go to the south till you
come to some Injin village; make your inquiries there; if they
haven't got the boys, they'll know whether the tribe that took
'em passed through their country, 'cause they couldn't very well
do so without some of their warriors finding it out. If none of
them don't know nothing about no such party, you can make up your
mind you're barking up the wrong tree; then take an excursion
west and do the same thing; then, if you don't learn anything,
try toward the north; there ain't any use in going eastward, for
common sense will teach you they haint been tooken that way; a
chap with your good sense will pick up some clue that'll show
you the way through."</p>

<p>"My brother speaks the words of wisdom," said Deerfoot, who was
much impressed by the utterances of the trapper: "Deerfoot will
not forget what he has said; he will carry his words with him
and they shall be his guide; Deerfoot says good-bye."</p>

<p>And with a courteous salute to the three, the young warrior walked
a few steps, broke into a light run, and was out of sight before
his intention was fairly understood. The trappers looked in each
others' faces, laughed, made some characteristic remarks, and
then turned to their own business.</p>

<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe had determined to follow the advice given
by Burt Hawkins the trapper. It certainly was singular that such
an extraordinary woodman as the Indian should profit by the counsel
of a white man, even though he was a veteran; but Deerfoot had
studied the problem so long that his brain was confused, and,
having fixed his own line of conduct, he only needed the endorsement
of some sturdy character like the hunter. He had received that
endorsement, and now he could not use too much haste.</p>

<p>His intention was to journey rapidly southward, in the direction
of the present State of Arkansas, until he should reach some of
the Indian villages that were there a hundred years ago. He would
push his inquiries among them, just as Burt Hawkins had suggested,
pressing the search in other directions, until able to pick up
some clue. After that, it would be an easy matter to determine
the line of policy that would lead to success.</p>

<p>Any one engaged in such a task as that on which the young Shawanoe
had entered, needs to take all the observations he can, for the
knowledge thus gained is sure to be of great help. The Indian
scanned the country opening to the southward, and, as was his
custom, turned his face toward the first elevation which would
give him the view he was so desirous of obtaining.</p>

<p>The elevation was similar to those with which the reader became
familiar long ago, and the sun had not yet reached the horizon
when the lithe warrior had climbed to the crest of the ridge,
and was scanning the wilderness which opened to the south and
west. He was in a region where he was warranted in looking for
Indian villages, and his penetrating eyes traveled over the area
with a minuteness of search hardly imaginable by the reader. The
country was so broken by mountain, hill, and wood, that the survey
was much less extended than would be supposed. He was disappointed
in one respect, however: he could detect no Indian village in
the whole range of vision.</p>

<p>But, besides the dim smoke from the camp he had left a short
time before, he observed another to the westward, and a third
to the south; he concluded to make his way to the last, though
he half suspected it was the camp of another party of trappers,
from whom he could not gather the first morsel of information.</p>

<p>Deerfoot pushed toward the valley, less than a mile distant,
from which the tell-tale vapor ascended, and was quite close to
the camp, when he became aware that an altogether unexpected state
of affairs existed. Despite his usual caution, his approach was
detected, and the Shawanoe found himself in no little peril.</p>

<p>It is difficult, if not impossible, to make clear how it was
Deerfoot discovered this singular state of affairs; but he was
more than a hundred yards from the camp, which was screened by
a dense undergrowth and rocks, when he stopped abruptly, warned
to do so by that subtle instinct which is like a sixth sense.</p>

<p>He did not leap behind a tree, nor fall on his face and creep
to the rear of the large boulder on his right, but he stood erect,
using the faculties of hearing and sight with a delicate power
and unerring skill which were marvelous in the highest degree.</p>

<p>The black eyes glanced around, as he slowly turned his head from
side to side, and he saw everything in front, rear, at his right,
left, and above, among the limbs and on the ground. He heard the
silken rustling of several leaves in the top of a beach overhead,
and he knew it was caused by one of those slight puffs of wind
which make themselves known in that manner.</p>

<p>The inhalation through his nostrils brought the faint odor of
the elm, the oak, the hickory, the chestnut, the sycamore, and
the resinous pine. He identified them, I say, as well as the peculiar
and indescribable odor given off by the decaying leaves, the mossy
rocks, and even the rotting twigs and branches; but among them
all he detected nothing of a foreign nature.</p>

<p>But it was his hearing upon which he mainly depended, though
his eyes were forced to their highest skill. When the pinnated
leaf of a hickory was shaken loose by the wind puff it had hardly
floated from its stem before he caught sight of it, and followed
it in its downward course until it fluttered slowly to the ground.</p>

<p>It may be said that the danger which threatened Deerfoot was
"in the air," if it be conceivable that there is anything in the
expression. He was as certain of it as he was of his own existence,
and yet he stood motionless, displaying an incredible confidence
in his ability to discover the nature of the peril before it could
take effective shape.</p>

<p>Had he leaped lightly behind a tree, he might have placed himself
on the side which would have left him exposed to the stealthy
shot; had he dropped to the ground and crept to one side of the
moss-covered boulder, the same fatal mistake was likely to be
made. Therefore he stood as rigid as iron, until he could learn
the direction from which he was threatened.</p>

<p>A rustling no louder than that made by the oscillation of a falling
leaf came from a point some distance ahead and on his right. So
soft indeed was the sound that it cannot be explained how the
human ear could be trained to the point of hearing it.</p>

<p>But it was that for which Deerfoot the Shawanoe was waiting,
and it gave him the knowledge he sought.</p>
