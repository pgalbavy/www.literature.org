<p>Jack Carleton walked to the flapping deerskin which closed the
entrance to the wigwam, flung it aside, and, stooping slightly,
stepped within.  Looking into the face of Wish-o-wa-tum, he made
a half military salute and, straightening up, called out:</p>

<p>"How do you do, brother?"</p>

<p>The etiquette of the visitor required him to advance and offer
his hand, but he was afraid to do so while in doubt as to the
sentiments of the chief.  The young Kentuckian recalled an instance
somewhat similar to the present, wherein a Huron warrior, grasping
the hand of the white man who offered it, suddenly drew him forward
and plunged his hunting-knife into his side.</p>

<p>The unexpected visit of Jack produced a sensation amounting,
for the moment, almost to consternation.  For the first time the
squaw showed genuine surprise.  Snapping the pipe from her mouth,
she threw up her head with a grunt, and stared at the athletic
youth.  The kicking baby on the hearth appeared to understand
that something unusual was going on, and held arms and legs still,
while he stared, with his round black eyes, toward the figure
at the other end of the lodge.</p>

<p>Man-not-Afraid-of-Thunder turned his head, holding his pipe in
hand, and looked inquiringly at the visitor.  He showed no signs
of fear, but, manifestly, he was astonished.  His fragmentary
conversation with the other boy had given him no cause to look
for such a call, though he saw at a glance that the two were friends.</p>

<p>Otto Relstaub beamed with delight.  With an expanse of smile
second only to that of which the sachem was capable, he rose partly
to his feet and, looking at Jack, called out:</p>

<p>"Mine gracious!  Jack, I didn't look for nodings of you pefore,
as dot ish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on!" interposed the lad at the door, with a laugh and wave
of the hand, "sit down and compose yourself till you can talk
straighter than that."</p>

<p>"I dinks I does&mdash;yaw," muttered the happy fellow, willing to
do anything suggested by his companion; "but come in and sot down."</p>

<p>While addressing Otto, Jack kept his eyes on Wish-o-wa-tum, for
it may be said he was the key of the situation.  If he showed
hostility, trouble was sure to follow.  Jack half expected to
see him make a leap for his bow or rifle, or attempt to draw his
tomahawk.</p>

<p>If he does thought the boy, "I'll raise my gun first, and he
will understand what that means."</p>

<p>But the looks and manner of the host (if such he may be called)
were neither hostile nor friendly; they were indifferent, as though
the whole business possessed no interest to him.  After his first
surprised stare, he swung his head back to its former position
and slowly smoked his pipe as before.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton made up his mind on the moment that his true course
was to carry out his first idea that is, to act as though there
was no doubt of the friendship of the Osage.</p>

<p>Stepping to the left, he set his gun on the ground with the muzzle
leaning against the side of the lodge.  No more expressive sign
of comity could have been given than this simple act.  He then
advanced to the beefy, stolid chieftain, to whom he offered his
hand, repeating the words:</p>

<p>"How do you do, brother?"</p>

<p>Wish-o-wa-tum took the fingers in his own immense palm, and gave
them a moderate pressure.  Though it might have been called a
warm salute, it sent a shiver through the youth, who unconsciously
braced himself against any sudden pull of the savage, his other
hand, at the same time, vaguely seeking the handle of his knife.</p>

<p>But, whatever thoughts or intentions may have stirred the massive
chieftain, they gave no evidence of their nature in his face. 
He looked up at the boy, and, as he slightly wabbled the hand
within his own, said:</p>

<p>"How do, brudder?"</p>

<p>Jack then turned about and greeted Otto, who could scarcely contain
himself.  The movement, it will be noticed, placed the back of
the former toward the chief, and he was conscious of another chill
running up and down his spine; for no better opportunity could
be given the Indian to strike one of those treacherous, lightning-like
blows peculiar to the savage races.</p>

<p>"Keep your eye on him," said Jack, in an undertone, while shaking
the hand of Otto, and both were talking loud and effusively.</p>

<p>Otto nodded his head and winked, to signify he caught on, and
did not check, for a single moment, his rattling flow of talk. 
Jack, in the most natural manner, shifted his position to one
side, so he was able to look upon every one in the wigwam without
the appearance of any special object in doing so.</p>

<p>The great point with the callers was to secure the good-will
of the savages.  It may seem shrewd on their part, but any boy,
no matter what his age, knows that the surest way to win the friendship
of a household is to magnify the importance of the baby.</p>

<p>The thought occurred to Otto long before, and more than once
he explored his garments in search of some present for the youngster;
but he possessed nothing that would answer.  His pockets were
empty of anything in the shape of coin, bright medals, buttons,
or playthings of any sort likely to attract the eye of the aboriginal
American infant.</p>

<p>He might have handed his hunting-knife to him, but more than
likely, in his blind striking and kicking, he would gouge out
an eye or attempt to scalp himself, and then the mother would
turn upon the donor in her wrath.  Otto considered the project
of borrowing the tomahawk of the chief and passing it over to
the heir, but feared he would knock out his own brains or do something
desperate, by which retribution would be visited on the head of
Otto.</p>

<p>But Jack Carleton was more fortunate, for in the pocket of his
trousers was an English shilling, worn smooth and shining with
the friction to which it had been long subjected.  It was just
the thing to catch the eye of any baby, no matter what its nativity,
and he stepped hastily forward and handed it to the one before
him.</p>

<p>The movement interested the parents scarcely less than the child.
They watched Jack closely.  The little fellow snatched the bright
coin in his snuffling, awkward fashion, and, when it was clutched
in his fingers, made a furious shove, intending to drive it into
his mouth.</p>

<p>"Hold on," called Jack, in alarm; "I didn't give it to you to
eat; I don't believe you can digest it."</p>

<p>Just then the little fellow began to kick, cough, and fling himself
harder than ever.  The mother sprang forward with an exclamation
in her native tongue, and, catching her baby in her arms, began
manipulating him in the most original fashion.  Standing upright
in the middle of the wigwam, she inverted him, and, holding him
by the heels, worked him up and down, as though he were the dasher
of a chum.</p>

<p>"If she don't do dot a leedle harder his head vill bounce off,"
remarked Otto.</p>

<p>The shilling flew from the throat of the baby, and Jack, thinking
it had done enough harm, scooped over to pick it up; but, before
he could lay hands on it, the mother snatched it from the ground
and shoved it into one of the capacious receptacles of her dress.
Evidently she identified the coin and knew its value.</p>

<p>"All right," laughed Jack; "I'll be glad to have you keep it,
if it will help to buy your friendship for us."</p>

<p>During this stirring episode, and when the boys feared the heir
of the wigwam was likely to choke himself to death, the father
never ceased smoking, his pipe.  His piggish eyes were turned
sideways, as though he thought the performance worth looking at;
but, beyond that, he did not disturb himself.</p>

<p>The infant, after his unpleasant experience, seemed to be as
well as ever, and being tumbled back on the bison skin resumed
his kicking and, crowing, as though seeking to make up for lost
time.</p>

<p>The occurrence produced an effect on Jack Carleton similar to
that caused by the sight of the expansive smile of the Osage chieftain:
he felt that no dangerous ill-will could exist wigwam which was
the scene of the incident.</p>

<p>The boys resumed their seats beside each other, where the other
occupants of the lodge were in sight all the time, and then spoke
with freedom.</p>

<p>"I don't think they will offer any harm," Jack, alluding, of
course, to the squaw and the warrior.  "I suspect he is an Osage."</p>

<p>"Yaw&mdash;dot ish vot he tolds me," said Otto carefully weighing
his words.</p>

<p>"What else did he tell you?  But, first of all, let me know how
you came to be his guest."</p>

<p>Thereupon the German related, in his own fashion, the story which
long since became familiar to the reader.  Jack Carleton listened
with much interest, glancing from the husband to the wife and
back again, with an occasional look at the baby, that had become
so motionless as to show that he was asleep.</p>

<p>"So you didn't get anything to eat?" remarked the young Kentuckian;
"when I first saw you here I thought you were after food.  I am
hungry, but I think the best thing we can do is to leave the lodge."</p>

<p>"Vy not stays till mornings?"</p>

<p>"It might do; but I'm a little too nervous to sleep, for there
can be no certainty about them.  I hunted around for other lodges,
but found none, and yet there may be plenty not far off.  He may
have visitors, and, if they find us here, there's no telling what
they will do."</p>

<p>"What for you leave your gun ober dere just as I does mit mine?"</p>

<p>"It struck me that that was the best way to show the old fellow
that not only was I friendly myself, but that I took him to be
a friend."</p>

<p>"Dot ish so; but it would be as nice as nefet vos if bofe of
our guns had us."</p>

<p>"I will get mine."</p>

<p>"Mebbe he won't lets you."</p>

<p>"I'm almost as close to it as he; I can take a step or two before
he will see what I mean to do, and then, if he undertakes to stop
me, he will be too late."</p>

<p>"Vot musn't I does?"</p>

<p>"Attend to the squaw: if she makes a dive after me, you grab
and hold her."</p>

<p>"Yaw," was the hesitating response of Otto, who saw what unpleasant
phases the situation was likely to assume.</p>

<p>Before Jack Carleton rose to his feet, he discovered that something
extraordinary was going on in the lodge.  Although the chief was
sitting in his lazy attitude, yet his senses were on the alert
and some sort of telegraphy was passing between him and his wife. 
Both continued smoking their pipes and did not speak nor move
their bodies.  Any one unable to see their faces would not suspect
they were looking at each other.</p>

<p>But they were not only doing so, but, singular as it may seem,
were sending messages mainly by means of the smoke issuing from
their dusky lips.  It was puffed forth, in every variety of manner,
sometimes with little short jets, then with longer ones, then
from one corner of the mouth and again from the other, all being
accompanied by a contortion of the flexible lips which doubtless
suggested some of the words in the minds of the two.</p>

<p>"That's very strange," said Jack, in an undertone, after he and
Otto had watched the performance several minutes.</p>

<p>"Yaw, dot ish vot I dinks."</p>

<p>"Why do they affect all that mystery?  If they want to say anything
to each other, why not speak in their own tongue?  Neither of
us can understand the first word."</p>

<p>"But they doesn't knows dot."</p>

<p>"They ought to know it.  However, we can't guess what they're
talking about, though I would give much to know."</p>

<p>Husband and wife were quick to observe they were under scrutiny,
but they continued the curious interchange of thoughts for some
time longer.  By and by they ceased and seemed be doing nothing
beside smoking; Carleton was right in his belief that the sachem
had heard something on the outside wigwam which greatly interested
them.</p>
