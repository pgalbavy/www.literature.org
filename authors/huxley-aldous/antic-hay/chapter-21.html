<p>"Well," said Gumbril, "here I am again."</p>

<p>"Already?" Mrs. Viveash had been reduced, by the violence of
her headache, to coming home after her luncheon with Piers Cotton
for a rest. She had fed her hungry pain on Pyramidon and now she
was lying down on the Dufy-upholstered sofa at the foot of her
full-length portrait by Jacques-Emile Blanche. Her head was not
much better, but she was bored. When the maid had announced Gumbril,
she had given word that he was to be let in. "I’m very ill," she
went on expiringly. "Look at me," she pointed to herself, "and
me again." She waved her hand towards the sizzling brilliance
of the portrait. "Before and after. Like the advertisements, you
know. Every picture tells a story." She laughed faintly, then
made a little grimace and, sucking in the breath between her lips,
she put her hand to her forehead.</p>

<p>"My poor Myra." Gumbril pulled up a chair to the sofa and sat
there like a doctor at his patient’s bedside. "But before and
after what?" he asked, almost professionally.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash gave an all but imperceptible shrug. "I don’t know,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Not influenza, I hope?"</p>

<p>"No, I don’t think so."</p>

<p>"Not love, by any chance?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash did not venture another laugh; she contented herself
with smiling agonizingly.</p>

<p>"That would have been a just retribution," Gumbril went on, "after
what you’ve done to me."</p>

<p>"What have I done to you?" Mrs. Viveash asked, opening wide her
pale-blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Merely wrecked my existence."</p>

<p>"But you’re being childish, Theodore. Say what you mean without
these grand, silly phrases." The dying voice spoke with impatience.</p>

<p>"Well, what I mean," said Gumbril, "is merely this. You prevented
me from going to see the only person I ever really wanted to see
in my life. And yesterday, when I tried to see her, she was gone.
Vanished. And here am I left in the vacuum."</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash shut her eyes. "We’re all in the vacuum," she said.
"You’ll still have plenty of company, you know." She was silent
for a moment. "Still, I’m sorry," she added. "Why didn’t you tell
me? And why didn’t you just pay no attention to me and go all
the same?"</p>

<p>"I didn’t tell you," Gumbril answered, "because, then, I didn’t
know. And I didn’t go because I didn’t want to quarrel with you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mrs. Viveash, and patted his hand, "But what
are you going to do about it now? Not quarrelling with me is only
a rather negative satisfaction, I’m afraid."</p>

<p>"I propose to leave the country to-morrow morning," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>"Ah, the classical remedy.... But not to shoot big game, I hope?"
She thought of Viveash among the Tikki-tikkis and the tsetses.
He was a charming creature; charming, but ... but what?</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed Gumbril. "What do you take me for?
Big game!" He leaned back in his chair and began to laugh, heartily,
for the first time since he had returned from Robertsbridge, yesterday
evening. He had felt then as though he would never laugh again.
"Do you see me in a pith helmet, with an elephant gun?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash put her hand to her forehead. "I see you, Theodore,"
she said, "but I try to think you would look quite normal; because
of my head."</p>

<p>"I go to Paris first," said Gumbril. "After that, I don’t know.
I shall go wherever I think people will buy pneumatic trousers.
I’m travelling on business."</p>

<p>This time, in spite of her head, Mrs. Viveash laughed.</p>

<p>"I thought of giving myself a farewell banquet," Gumbril went
on. "We’ll go round before dinner, if you’re feeling well enough,
that is, and collect a few friends. Then, in profoundest gloom,
we’ll eat and drink. And in the morning, unshaved, exhausted and
filled with disgust, I shall take the train from Victoria, feeling
thankful to get out of England."</p>

<p>"We’ll do it," said Mrs. Viveash faintly and indomitably from
the sofa that was almost genuinely a death-bed. "And, meanwhile,
we’ll have a second brew of tea and you shall talk to me."</p>

<p>The tannin was brought in. Gumbril settled down to talk and Mrs.
Viveash to listen—to listen and from time to time to dab her brows
with eau-de-Cologne, to take a sniff of hartshorn.</p>

<p>Gumbril talked. He talked of the marriage ceremonies of octopuses,
of the rites intricately consummated in the submarine green grottos
of the Indian Ocean. Given a total of sixteen arms, how many permutations
and combinations of caresses? And in the middle of each bunch
of arms a mouth like the beak of a macaw.</p>

<p>On the backside of the moon, his friend Umbilikoff, the mystic,
used to assure him, the souls of the dead in the form of little
bladders—like so much swelled sago—are piled up and piled up till
they squash and squeeze one another with an excruciating and ever-growing
pressure. In the exoteric world this squeezing on the moon’s backside
is known, erroneously, as hell. And as for the constellation,
Scorpio—he was the first of all constellations to have a proper
sort of backbone. For by an effort of the will he ingurgitated
his external armour, he compressed and rebuilt it within his body
and so became the first vertebrate. This, you may well believe,
was a notable day in cosmic history.</p>

<p>The rents in these new buildings in Regent Street and Piccadilly
run to as much as three or four pounds a square foot. Meanwhile,
all the beauty imagined by Nash has departed, and chaos and barbarism
once more reign supreme, even in Regent Street. The ghost of Gumbril
Senior stalked across the room.</p>

<p>Who lives longer: the man who takes heroin for two years and
dies, or the man who lives on roast beef, water and potatoes till
ninety-five? One passes his twenty-four months in eternity. All
the years of the beef-eater are lived only in time. "I can tell
you all about heroin," said Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>Lady Capricorn, he understood, was still keeping open bed. How
Rubens would have admired those silk cushions, those gigantic
cabbage roses, those round pink pearls of hers, vaster than those
that Captain Nemo discovered in the immemorial oyster! And the
warm dry rustle of flesh over flesh as she walks, moving first
one leg, then advancing the other.</p>

<p>Talking of octopuses, the swim-bladders of deep-sea fishes are
filled with almost absolutely pure oxygen. <em>C’est la vie</em>—Gumbril
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>In Alpine pastures the grasshoppers start their flight, whizzing
like clockwork grasshoppers. And these brown invisible ones reveal
themselves suddenly as they skim above the flowers—a streak of
blue lightning, a trailing curve of scarlet. Then the overwing
shuts down over the coloured wing below and they are once more
invisible fiddlers rubbing their thighs, like Lady Capricorn,
at the foot of the towering flowers.</p>

<p>Forgers give patina to their mediæval ivories by lending them
to stout young Jewesses to wear for a few months hanging, like
an amulet, between their breasts.</p>

<p>In Italian cemeteries the family vaults are made of glass and
iron, like greenhouses.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Griddle has finally married the hog-faced gentlewoman.</p>

<p>Piero della Francesca’s fresco of the Resurrection at San Sepolcro
is the most beautiful picture in the world, and the hotel there
is far from bad. Scriabine = <em>le</em> Tschaikovsky <em>de nos
jours</em>. The dullest landscape painter is Marchand. The best
poet....</p>

<p>"You bore me," said Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Must I talk of love, then?" asked Gumbril.</p>

<p>"It looks like it," Mrs. Viveash answered, and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>Gumbril told the anecdote about Jo Peters, Connie Asticot and
Jim Baum. The anecdote of Lola Knopf and the Baroness Gnomon.
Of Margherita Radicofani, himself, and the Pastor Meyer. Of Lord
Cavey and little Toby Nobes. When he had finished these, he saw
that Mrs. Viveash had gone to sleep.</p>

<p>He was not flattered. But a little sleep would do her headache,
he reflected, a world of good. And knowing that if he ceased to
speak, she would probably be woken by the sudden blankness of
the silence, he went on quietly talking to himself.</p>

<p>"When I’m abroad this time," he soliloquized, "I shall really
begin writing my autobiography. There’s nothing like a hotel bedroom
to work in." He scratched his head thoughtfully and even picked
his nose, which was one of his bad habits, when he was alone.
"People who know me," he went on, "will think that what I write
about the governess cart and my mother and the flowers and so
on is written merely because I know in here," he scratched his
head a little harder to show himself that he referred to his brain,
"that that’s the sort of thing one ought to write about. They’ll
think I’m a sort of dingy Romain Rolland, hopelessly trying to
pretend that I feel the emotions and have the great spiritual
experiences, which the really important people do feel and have.
And perhaps they’ll be right. Perhaps the Life of Gumbril will
be as manifestly an <em>ersatz</em> as the Life of Beethoven.
On the other hand, they may be astonished to find that it’s the
genuine article. We shall see." Gumbril nodded his head slowly,
while he transferred two pennies from his right-hand trouser pocket
to his left-hand trouser pocket. He was somewhat distressed to
find that these coppers had been trespassing among the silver.
Silver was for the right-hand, copper for the left. It was one
of the laws which it was extremely unlucky to infringe. "I have
a premonition," he went on, "that one of these days I may become
a saint. An unsuccessful flickering sort of saint, like a candle
beginning to go out. As for love—m’yes, m’yes. And as for the
people I have met—I shall point out that I have known most of
the eminent men in Europe, and that I have said of all of them
what I said after my first love affair: Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Did you really say that about your first love affair?" asked
Mrs. Viveash, who had woken up again.</p>

<p>"Didn’t you?"</p>

<p>"No. I said: This <em>is</em> all—everything, the universe. In
love, it’s either all or nothing at all." She shut her eyes and
almost immediately went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Gumbril continued his lullaby-soliloquy.</p>

<p>"‘This charming little book.’... <em>The Scotsman.</em> ‘This
farrago of obscenity, slander and false psychology.’... <em>Darlington
Echo.</em> ‘Mr. Gumbril’s first cousin is St. Francis Xavier,
his second cousin is the Earl of Rochester, his third cousin is
the Man of Feeling, his fourth cousin is David Hume.’... <em>Court
Journal.</em>" Gumbril was already tired of this joke. "When I
consider how my light is spent," he went on, "when I consider!...
Herr Jesu, as Fraulein Nimmernein used to exclaim at the critical
moment. Consider, dear cow, consider. This is not the time of
year for grass to grow. Consider, dear cow, consider, consider."
He got up from his chair and tiptoed across the room to the writing-table.
An Indian dagger lay next to the blotting-pad; Mrs. Viveash used
it as a paper-knife. Gumbril picked it up, executed several passes
with it. "Thumb on the blade," he said, "and strike upwards. On
guard. Lunge. To the hilt it penetrates. Poniard at the tip"—he
ran the blade between his fingers—"caress by the time it reaches
the hilt. Z—zip." He put down the knife and stopping for a moment
to make a grimace at himself in the mirror over the mantelpiece,
he went back to his chair.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock Mrs. Viveash woke up. She shook her head to
feel if the pain were still rolling about loose inside her skull.</p>

<p>"I really believe I’m all right," she said. She jumped up. "Come
on," she cried. "I feel ready for anything."</p>

<p>"And I feel like so much food for worms," said Gumbril. "Still,
<em>Versiam’ a tazza piena il generoso umor</em>." He hummed the
Drinking Song out of <em>Robert the Devil</em>, and to that ingenuously
jolly melody they left the house.</p>

<p>Their taxi that evening cost them several pounds. They made the
man drive back and forth, like a shuttle, from one end of London
to the other. Every time they passed through Piccadilly Circus
Mrs. Viveash leant out of the window to look at the sky signs
dancing their unceasing St. Vitus’s dance above the monument to
the Earl of Shaftesbury.</p>

<p>"How I adore them!" she said the first time they passed them.
"Those wheels that whizz round till the sparks fly out from under
them: that rushing motor, and that lovely bottle of port filling
the glass and then disappearing and reappearing and filling it
again. Too lovely."</p>

<p>"Too revolting," Gumbril corrected her. "These things are the
epileptic symbol of all that’s most bestial and idiotic in contemporary
life. Look at those beastly things and then look at that." He
pointed to the County Fire Office on the northern side of the
Circus. "There stands decency, dignity, beauty, repose. And there
flickers, there gibbers and twitches—what? Restlessness, distraction,
refusal to think, anything for an unquiet life...."</p>

<p>"What a delicious pedant you are!" She turned away from the window,
put her hands on his shoulders and looked at him. "Too exquisitely
ridiculous!" And she kissed him.</p>

<p>"You won’t force me to change my opinion." Gumbril smiled at
her. "<em>Eppur’ si muove</em>—I stick to my guns like Galileo.
They move and they’re horrible."</p>

<p>"They’re me," said Mrs. Viveash emphatically. "Those things are
me."</p>

<p>They drove first to Lypiatt’s mews. Under the Piranesian arch.
The clothes-lines looped from window to window across the street
might have been those ropes which form so essential and so mysterious
a part of the furniture of the Prisons. The place smelt, the children
were shouting; the hyena-like laughter of the flappers reverberated
between the close-set walls. All Gumbril’s sense of social responsibility
was aroused in a moment.</p>

<p>Shut up in his room all day, Lypiatt had been writing—writing
his whole life, all his ideas and ideals, all for Myra. The pile
of scribbled sheets grew higher and higher. Towards evening he
made an end; he had written all that he wanted to write. He ate
the remains of yesterday’s loaf of bread and drank some water;
for he realized suddenly that he had been fasting the whole day.
Then he composed himself to think; he stretched himself out on
the brink of the well and looked down into the eyeless darkness.</p>

<p>He still had his Service revolver. Taking it out of the drawer
in which it was kept, he loaded it, he laid it on the packing-case
which served him as a table at his bed’s head, and stretched himself
out on the bed. He lay quite still, his muscles all relaxed, hardly
breathing. He imagined himself dead. Derision! there was still
the plunge into the well.</p>

<p>He picked up the pistol, looked down the barrel. Black and deep
as the well. The muzzle against his forehead was a cold mouth.</p>

<p>There was nothing new to be thought about death. There was not
even the possibility of a new thought. Only the old thoughts,
the horrible old questions returned.</p>

<p>The cold mouth to his forehead, his finger pressing on the trigger.
Already he would be falling, falling. And the annihilating crash
would be the same as the far-away sound of death at the bottom
of the well. And after that, in the silence? The old question
was still the same.</p>

<p>After that, he would lie bleeding. The flies would drink his
blood as though it were red honey. In the end the people would
come and fetch him away, and the coroner’s jury would look at
him in the mortuary and pronounce him temporarily insane. Then
he would be buried in a black hole, would be buried and decay.</p>

<p>And meanwhile, would there be anything else? There was nothing
new to be thought or asked. And there was still no answer.</p>

<p>In the room it began to grow dark; colours vanished, forms ran
together. The easel and Myra’s portrait were now a single black
silhouette against the window. Near and far were fused, become
one and continuous in the darkness, became a part of the darkness.
Outside the window the pale twilight grew more sombre. The children
shouted shrilly, playing their games under the green gas lamps.
The mirthless, ferocious laughter of young girls mocked and invited.
Lypiatt stretched out his hand and fingered the pistol.</p>

<p>Down below, at his door, he heard a sharp knocking. He lifted
his head and listened, caught the sound of two voices, a man’s
and a woman’s. Myra’s voice he recognized at once; the other,
he supposed, was Gumbril’s.</p>

<p>"Hideous to think that people actually live in places like this,"
Gumbril was saying. "Look at those children. It ought to be punishable
by law to produce children in this street."</p>

<p>"They always take me for the Pied Piper," said Mrs. Viveash.
Lypiatt got up and crept to the window. He could hear all they
said.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Lypiatt’s in. I don’t see any sign of a light."</p>

<p>"But he has heavy curtains," said Mrs. Viveash, "and I know for
a fact that he always composes his poetry in the dark. He may
be composing poetry."</p>

<p>Gumbril laughed.</p>

<p>"Knock again," said Mrs. Viveash. "Poets are always absorbed,
you know. And Casimir’s always the poet."</p>

<p>"<em>Il Poeta</em>—capital P. Like d’Annunzio in the Italian
papers," said Gumbril. "Did you know that d’Annunzio has books
printed on mackintosh for his bath?" He rapped again at the door.
"I saw it in the <em>Corriere della Sera</em> the other day at
the club. He reads the <em>Little Flowers of St. Francis</em>
by preference in his bath. And he has a fountain pen with waterproof
ink in the soap-dish, so that he can add a few Fioretti of his
own whenever he feels like it. We might suggest that to Casimir."</p>

<p>Lypiatt stood with folded arms by the window, listening. How
lightly they threw his life, his heart, from hand to hand, as
though it were a ball and they were playing a game! He thought
suddenly of all the times he had spoken lightly and maliciously
of other people. His own person had always seemed, on those occasions,
sacred. One knew in theory very well that others spoke of one
contemptuously—as one spoke of them. In practice—it was hard to
believe.</p>

<p>"Poor Casimir!" said Mrs. Viveash. "I’m afraid his show was a
failure."</p>

<p>"I know it was," said Gumbril. "Complete and absolute. I told
my tame capitalist that he ought to employ Lypiatt for our advertisements.
He’d be excellent for those. And it would mean some genuine money
in his pocket."</p>

<p>"But the worst of it is," said Mrs. Viveash, "that he’ll only
feel insulted by the suggestion." She looked up at the window.</p>

<p>"I don’t know why," she went on, "this house looks most horribly
dead. I hope nothing’s happened to poor Casimir. I have a most
disagreeable feeling that it may have."</p>

<p>"Ah, this famous feminine intuition," laughed Gumbril. He knocked
again.</p>

<p>"I can’t help feeling that he may be lying there dead, or delirious,
or something."</p>

<p>"And I can’t help feeling that he must have gone out to dinner.
We shall have to give him up, I’m afraid. It’s a pity. He’s so
good with Mercaptan. Like bear and mastiff. Or rather, like bear
and poodle, bear and King Charles’s spaniel—or whatever those
little dogs are that you see ladies in eighteenth-century French
engravings taking to bed with them. Let’s go."</p>

<p>"Just knock once again," said Mrs. Viveash. "He might really
be preoccupied, or asleep, or ill." Gumbril knocked. "Now listen.
Hush."</p>

<p>They were silent; the children still went on hallooing in the
distance. There was a great clop-clopping of horse’s feet as a
van was backed into a stable door near by. Lypiatt stood motionless,
his arms still crossed, his chin on his breast. The seconds passed.</p>

<p>"Not a sound," said Gumbril. "He must have gone out."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Come on, then. We’ll go and look for Mercaptan."</p>

<p>He heard their steps in the street below, heard the slamming
of the taxi door. The engine was started up. Loud on the first
gear, less loud on the second, whisperingly on the third, it moved
away, gathering speed. The noise of it was merged with the general
noise of the town. They were gone.</p>

<p>Lypiatt walked slowly back to his bed. He wished suddenly that
he had gone down to answer the last knock. These voices—at the
well’s edge he had turned to listen to them; at the well’s extreme
verge. He lay quite still in the darkness; and it seemed to him
at last that he had floated away from the earth, that he was alone,
no longer in a narrow dark room, but in an illimitable darkness
outside and beyond. His mind grew calmer; he began to think of
himself, of all that he had known, remotely, as though from a
great way off.</p>

<p>"Adorable lights!" said Mrs. Viveash, as they drove once more
through Piccadilly Circus.</p>

<p>Gumbril said nothing. He had said all that he had to say last
time.</p>

<p>"And there’s another," exclaimed Mrs. Viveash, as they passed,
near Burlington House, a fountain of Sandeman’s port. "If only
they had an automatic jazz band attached to the same mechanism!"
she said regretfully.</p>

<p>The Green Park remained solitary and remote under the moon. "Wasted
on us," said Gumbril, as they passed. "One should be happily in
love to enjoy a summer night under the trees." He wondered where
Emily could be now. They sat in silence; the cab drove on.</p>

<p>Mr. Mercaptan, it seemed, had left London. His housekeeper had
a long story to tell. A regular Bolshevik had come yesterday,
pushing in. And she had heard him shouting at Mr. Mercaptan in
his own room. And then, luckily, a lady had come and the Bolshevik
had gone away again. And this morning Mr. Mercaptan had decided,
quite sudden like, to go away for two or three days. And it wouldn’t
surprise her at all if it had something to do with that horrible
Bolshevik fellow. Though of course Master Paster hadn’t said anything
about it. Still, as she’d known him when he was so high and seen
him grow up like, she thought she could say she knew him well
enough to guess why he did things. It was only brutally that they
contrived to tear themselves away.</p>

<p>Secure, meanwhile, behind a whole troop of butlers and footmen,
Mr. Mercaptan was dining comfortably at Oxhanger with the most
faithful of his friends and admirers, Mrs. Speegle. It was to
Mrs. Speegle that he had dedicated his coruscating little ‘Loves
of the Pachyderms’; for Mrs. Speegle it was who had suggested,
casually one day at luncheon, that the human race ought to be
classified in two main species—the Pachyderms, and those whose
skin, like her own, like Mr. Mercaptan’s and a few others’, was
fine and ‘responsive,’ as Mr. Mercaptan himself put it, ‘to all
caresses, including those of pure reason.’ Mr. Mercaptan had taken
the casual hint and had developed it, richly. The barbarous Pachyderms
he divided up into a number of subspecies: steatocephali, acephali,
theolaters, industrious Judæorhynci—busy, compact and hard as
dung-beetles—Peabodies, Russians and so on. It was all very witty
and delicately savage. Mr. Mercaptan had a standing invitation
at Oxhanger. With dangerous pachyderms like Lypiatt ranging loose
about the town, he thought it best to avail himself of it. Mrs.
Speegle, he knew, would be delighted to see him. And indeed she
was. He arrived just at lunch-time. Mrs. Speegle and Maisie Furlonger
were already at the fish.</p>

<p>"Mercaptan!" Mrs. Speegle’s soul seemed to be in the name. "Sit
down," she went on, cooing as she talked, like a ring-dove. There
seemed to be singing in every word she spoke. She pointed to a
chair next to hers. "N’you’re n’just in time to tell us all about
<em>n’your</em> Lesbian experiences."</p>

<p>And Mercaptan, giving vent to his fully orchestrated laugh—squeal
and roar together—had sat down and, speaking in French partly,
he nodded towards the butler and the footman, ‘<em>à cause des
valets</em>,’ and partly because the language lent itself more
deliciously to this kind of confidences, he had begun there and
then, interrupted and spurred on by the cooing of Mrs. Speegle
and the happy shrieks of Maisie Furlonger, to recount at length
and with all the wit in the world his experience among the Isles
of Greece. How delicious it was, he said to himself, to be with
really civilized people! In this happy house it seemed scarcely
possible to believe that such a thing as a pachyderm existed.</p>

<p>But Lypiatt still lay, face upwards, on his bed, floating, it
seemed to himself, far out into the dark emptinesses between the
stars. From those distant abstract spaces he seemed to be looking
impersonally down upon his own body stretched out by the brink
of the hideous well; to be looking back over his own history.
Everything, even his own unhappiness, seemed very small and beautiful;
every frightful convulsion had become no more than a ripple, and
only the fine musical ghost of sound came up to him from all the
shouting.</p>

<p>"We have no luck," said Gumbril, as they climbed once more into
the cab.</p>

<p>"I’m not sure," said Mrs. Viveash, "that we haven’t really had
a great deal. Did you genuinely want very much to see Mercaptan?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said Gumbril. "But do you genuinely want
to see me?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash drew the corners of her mouth down into a painful
smile and did not answer. "Aren’t we going to pass through Piccadilly
Circus again?" she asked. "I should like to see the lights again.
They give one temporarily the illusion of being cheerful."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Gumbril, "we are going straight to Victoria."</p>

<p>"We couldn’t tell the driver to...?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said Mrs. Viveash. "Perhaps one’s better without
stimulants. I remember when I was very young, when I first began
to go about at all, how proud I was of having discovered champagne.
It seemed to me wonderful to get rather tipsy. Something to be
exceedingly proud of. And, at the same time, how much I really
disliked wine! Loathed the taste of it. Sometimes, when Calliope
and I used to dine quietly together, <em>tête-à-tête</em>, with
no awful men about, and no appearances to keep up, we used to
treat ourselves to the luxury of a large lemon-squash, or even
raspberry syrup and soda. Ah, I wish I could recapture the deliciousness
of raspberry syrup."</p>

<p>Coleman was at home. After a brief delay he appeared himself
at the door. He was wearing pyjamas, and his face was covered
with red-brown smears, the tips of his beard were clotted with
the same dried pigment.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing to yourself?" asked Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Merely washing in the blood of the Lamb," Coleman answered,
smiling, and his eyes sparkling blue fire, like an electric machine.</p>

<p>The door on the opposite side of the little vestibule was open.
Looking over Coleman’s shoulder, Gumbril could see through the
opening a brightly lighted room and, in the middle of it, like
a large rectangular island, a wide divan. Reclining on the divan
an odalisque by Ingres—but slimmer, more serpentine, more like
a lithe pink length of boa—presented her back. That big, brown
mole on the right shoulder was surely familiar. But when, startled
by the loudness of the voices behind her, the odalisque turned
round—to see in a horribly embarrassing instant that the Cossack
had left the door open and that people could look in, were looking
in, indeed—the slanting eyes beneath their heavy white lids, the
fine aquiline nose, the wide, full-lipped mouth, though they presented
themselves for only the fraction of a second, were still more
recognizable and familiar. For only the fraction of a second did
the odalisque reveal herself definitely as Rosie. Then a hand
pulled feverishly at the counterpane, the section of buff-coloured
boa wriggled and rolled; and, in a moment, where an odalisque
had been, lay only a long packet under a white sheet, like a jockey
with a fractured skull when they carry him from the course.</p>

<p>Well, really.... Gumbril felt positively indignant; not jealous,
but astonished and righteously indignant.</p>

<p>"Well, when you’ve finished bathing," said Mrs. Viveash, "I hope
you’ll come and have dinner with us." Coleman was standing between
her and the farther door; Mrs. Viveash had seen nothing in the
room beyond the vestibule.</p>

<p>"I’m busy," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"So I see." Gumbril spoke as sarcastically as he could.</p>

<p>"Do you see?" asked Coleman, and looked round. "So you do!" He
stepped back and closed the door.</p>

<p>"It’s Theodore’s last dinner," pleaded Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Not even if it were his last supper," said Coleman, enchanted
to have been given the opportunity to blaspheme a little. "Is
he going to be crucified? Or what?"</p>

<p>"Merely going abroad," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>"He has a broken heart," Mrs. Viveash explained.</p>

<p>"Ah, the genuine platonic towsers?" Coleman uttered his artificial
demon’s laugh.</p>

<p>"That’s just about it," said Gumbril, grimly.</p>

<p>Relieved by the shutting of the door from her immediate embarrassment,
Rosie threw back a corner of the counterpane and extruded her
head, one arm and the shoulder with the mole on it. She looked
about her, opening her slanting eyes as wide as she could. She
listened with parted lips to the voices that came, muffled now,
through the door. It seemed to her as though she were waking up;
as though now, for the first time, she were hearing that shattering
laugh, were looking now for the first time on these blank, white
walls and the one lovely and horrifying picture. Where was she?
What did it all mean? Rosie put her hand to her forehead, tried
to think. Her thinking was always a series of pictures; one after
another the pictures swam up before her eyes, melted again in
an instant.</p>

<p>Her mother taking off her pince-nez to wipe them—and at once
her eyes were tremulous and vague and helpless. "You should always
let the gentleman get over the stile first," she said, and put
on her glasses again. Behind the glasses her eyes immediately
became clear, piercing, steady and efficient. Rather formidable
eyes. They had seen Rosie getting over the stile in front of Willie
Hoskyns, and there was too much leg.</p>

<p>James reading at his desk; his heavy, round head propped on his
hand. She came up behind him and threw her arms round his neck.
Very gently, and without turning his eyes from the page, he undid
her embrace and, with a little push that was no more than a hint,
an implication, signified that he didn’t want her. She had gone
to her pink room, and cried.</p>

<p>Another time James shook his head and smiled patiently under
his moustache. ‘You’ll never learn,’ he said. She had gone to
her room and cried that time too.</p>

<p>Another time they were lying in bed together, in the pink bed;
only you couldn’t see it was pink because there was no light.
They were lying very quietly. Warm and happy and remote she felt.
Sometimes as it were the physical memory of pleasure plucked at
her nerves, making her start, making her suddenly shiver. James
was breathing as though he were asleep. All at once he stirred.
He patted her shoulder two or three times in a kindly and business-like
way. "I know what that means," she said, "when you pat me like
that." And she patted him—pat-pat-pat, very quickly. "It means
you’re going to bed." "How do you know?" he asked. "Do you think
I don’t know you after all this time? I know that pat by heart."
And suddenly all her warm, quiet happiness evaporated; it was
all gone. "I’m only a machine for going to bed with," she said.
"That’s all I am for you." She felt she would like to cry. But
James only laughed and said, "Nonsense!" and pulled his arm clumsily
from underneath her. "You go to sleep," he said, and kissed her
on the forehead. Then he got out of bed, and she heard him bumping
clumsily about in the darkness. "Damn!" he said once. Then he
found the door, opened, and was gone.</p>

<p>She thought of those long stories she used to make up when she
went shopping. The fastidious lady; the poets; all the adventures.</p>

<p>Toto’s hands were wonderful.</p>

<p>She saw, she heard Mr. Mercaptan reading his essay. Poor father,
reading aloud from the <em>Hibbert Journal</em>!</p>

<p>And now the Cossack, covered with blood. He, too, might read
aloud from the <em>Hibbert Journal</em>—only backwards, so to
speak. She had a bruise on her arm. "You think there’s nothing
inherently wrong and disgusting in it?" he had asked. "There is,
I tell you." He had laughed and kissed her and stripped off her
clothes and caressed her. And she had cried, she had struggled,
she had tried to turn away; and in the end she had been overcome
by a pleasure more piercing and agonizing than anything she had
ever felt before. And all the time Coleman had hung over her,
with his blood-stained beard, smiling into her face, and whispering,
"Horrible, horrible, infamous and shameful." She lay in a kind
of stupor. Then, suddenly there had been that ringing. The Cossack
had left her. And now she was awake again, and it was horrible,
it was shameful. She shuddered; she jumped out of bed and began
as quickly as she could to put on her clothes.</p>

<p>"Really, really, won’t you come?" Mrs. Viveash was insisting.
She was not used to people saying no when she asked, when she
insisted. She didn’t like it.</p>

<p>"No." Coleman shook his head. "You may be having the last supper.
But I have a date here with the Magdalen."</p>

<p>"Oh, a woman," said Viveash. "But why didn’t you say so before?"</p>

<p>"Well, as I’d left the door open," said Coleman, "I thought it
was unnecessary."</p>

<p>"Fie," said Mrs. Viveash. "I find this very repulsive. Let’s
go away." She plucked Gumbril by the sleeve.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Coleman, politely. He shut the door after them
and turned back across the little hall.</p>

<p>"What! Not thinking of going?" he exclaimed, as he came in. Rosie
was sitting down on the edge of the bed pulling on her shoes.</p>

<p>"Go away," she said. "You disgust me."</p>

<p>"But that’s splendid," Coleman declared. "That’s all as it should
be, all as I intended." He sat down beside her on the divan. "Really,"
he said, admiringly, "what exquisite legs!"</p>

<p>Rosie would have given anything in the world to be back again
in Bloxam Gardens. Even if James did live in his books all the
time.... Anything in the world.</p>

<p>"This time," said Mrs. Viveash, "we simply must go through Piccadilly
Circus."</p>

<p>"It’ll only be about two miles farther."</p>

<p>"Well, that isn’t much."</p>

<p>Gumbril leaned out and gave the word to the driver.</p>

<p>"And besides, I like driving about like this," said Mrs. Viveash.
"I like driving for driving’s sake. It’s like the Last Ride Together.
Dear Theodore!" She laid her hand on his.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Gumbril, and kissed it.</p>

<p>The little cab buzzed along down the empty Mall. They were silent.
Through the thick air one could see the brightest of the stars.
It was one of those evenings when men feel that truth, goodness
and beauty are one. In the morning, when they commit their discovery
to paper, when others read it written there, it looks wholly ridiculous.
It was one of those evenings when love is once more invented for
the first time. That, too, seems a little ridiculous, sometimes,
in the morning.</p>

<p>"Here are the lights again," said Mrs. Viveash. "Hop, twitch,
flick—yes, genuinely an illusion of jollity, Theodore. Genuinely."</p>

<p>Gumbril stopped the cab. "It’s after half-past eight," he said.
"At this rate we shall never get anything to eat. Wait a minute."</p>

<p>He ran into Appenrodt’s, and came back in a moment with a packet
of smoked salmon sandwiches, a bottle of white wine and a glass.</p>

<p>"We have a long way to go," he explained, as he got into the
taxi.</p>

<p>They ate their sandwiches, they drank their wine. The taxi drove
on and on.</p>

<p>"This is positively exhilarating," said Mrs. Viveash, as they
turned into the Edgware Road.</p>

<p>Polished by the wheels and shining like an old and precious bronze,
the road stretched before them, reflecting the lamps. It had the
inviting air of a road which goes on for ever.</p>

<p>"They used to have such good peep-shows in this street," Gumbril
tenderly remembered: "Little back shops where you paid twopence
to see the genuine mermaid, which turned out to be a stuffed walrus,
and the tattooed lady, and the dwarf, and the living statuary,
which one always hoped, as a boy, was really going to be rather
naked and thrilling, but which was always the most pathetic of
unemployed barmaids, dressed in the thickest of pink Jaeger."</p>

<p>"Do you think there’d be any of those now?" asked Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>Gumbril shook his head. "They’ve moved on with the march of civilization.
But where?" He spread out his hands interrogatively. "I don’t
know which direction civilization marches—whether north towards
Kilburn and Golders Green, or over the river to the Elephant,
to Clapham and Sydenham and all those other mysterious places.
But, in any case, high rents have marched up here; there are no
more genuine mermaids in the Edgware Road. What stories we shall
be able to tell our children!"</p>

<p>"Do you think we shall ever have any?" Mrs. Viveash asked.</p>

<p>"One can never tell."</p>

<p>"I should have thought one could," said Mrs. Viveash. Children—that
would be the most desperate experiment of all. The most desperate,
and perhaps the only one having any chance of being successful.
History recorded cases.... On the other hand, it recorded other
cases that proved the opposite. She had often thought of this
experiment. There were so many obvious reasons for not making
it. But some day, perhaps—she always put it off, like that.</p>

<p>The cab had turned off the main road into quieter and darker
streets.</p>

<p>"Where are we now?" asked Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Penetrating into Maida Vale. We shall soon be there. Poor old
Shearwater!" He laughed. Other people in love were always absurd.</p>

<p>"Shall we find him in, I wonder?" It would be fun to see Shearwater
again. She liked to hear him talking, learnedly, and like a child.
But when the child is six feet high and three feet wide and two
feet thick, when it tries to plunge head first into your life—then,
really, no.... "But what did you want with me?" he had asked.
"Just to look at you," she answered. Just to look; that was all.
Music hall, not boudoir.</p>

<p>"Here we are." Gumbril got out and rang the second floor bell.</p>

<p>The door was opened by an impertinent-looking little maid.</p>

<p>"Mr. Shearwater’s at the lavatory," she said, in answer to Gumbril’s
question.</p>

<p>"Laboratory?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"At the ’ospital." That made it clear.</p>

<p>"And is Mrs. Shearwater at home?" he asked maliciously.</p>

<p>The little maid shook her head. "I expected ’er, but she didn’t
come back to dinner."</p>

<p>"Would you mind giving her a message when she does come in,"
said Gumbril. "Tell her that Mr. Toto was very sorry he hadn’t
time to speak to her when he saw her this evening in Pimlico."</p>

<p>"Mr. who?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Toto."</p>

<p>"Mr. Toto is sorry ’e ’adn’t the time to speak to Mrs. Shearwater
when ’e saw ’er in Pimlico this evening. Very well, sir."</p>

<p>"You won’t forget?" said Gumbril.</p>

<p>"No, I won’t forget."</p>

<p>He went back to the cab and explained that they had drawn blank
once more.</p>

<p>"I’m rather glad," said Mrs. Viveash. "If we ever did find anybody,
it would mean the end of this Last-Ride-Together feeling. And
that would be sad. And it’s a lovely night. And really, for the
moment, I feel I can do without my lights. Suppose we just drove
for a bit now."</p>

<p>But Gumbril would not allow that. "We haven’t had enough to eat
yet," he said, and he gave the cabman Gumbril Senior’s address.</p>

<p>Gumbril Senior was sitting on his little iron balcony among the
dried-out pots that had once held geraniums, smoking his pipe
and looking earnestly out into the darkness in front of him. Clustered
in the fourteen plane trees of the square, the starlings were
already asleep. There was no sound but the rustling of the leaves.
But sometimes, every hour or so, the birds would wake up. Something—perhaps
it might be a stronger gust of wind, perhaps some happy dream
of worms, some nightmare of cats simultaneously dreamed by all
the flock together—would suddenly rouse them. And then they would
all start to talk at once, at the tops of their shrill voices—for
perhaps half a minute. Then in an instant they all went to sleep
again and there was once more no sound but the rustling of the
shaken leaves. At these moments Mr. Gumbril would lean forward,
would strain his eyes and his ears in the hope of seeing, of hearing
something—something significant, explanatory, satisfying. He never
did, of course; but that in no way diminished his happiness.</p>

<p>Mr. Gumbril received them on his balcony with courtesy.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking of going in to work," he said. "And now
you come and give me a good excuse for sitting out here a little
longer. I’m delighted."</p>

<p>Gumbril Junior went downstairs to see what he could find in the
way of food. While he was gone, his father explained to Mrs. Viveash
the secrets of the birds. Enthusiastically, his light floss of
grey hair floating up and falling again about his head as he pointed
and gesticulated, he told her; the great flocks assembled—goodness
only knew where!—they flew across the golden sky, detaching here
a little troop, there a whole legion, they flew until at last
all had found their appointed resting-places and there were no
more to fly. He made this nightly flight sound epical, as though
it were a migration of peoples, a passage of armies.</p>

<p>"And it’s my firm belief," said Gumbril Senior, adding notes
to his epic, "that they make use of some sort of telepathy, some
kind of direct mind-to-mind communication between themselves.
You can’t watch them without coming to that conclusion."</p>

<p>"A charming conclusion," said Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"It’s a faculty," Gumbril Senior went on, "we all possess, I
believe. All we animals." He made a gesture which included himself,
Mrs. Viveash and the invisible birds among the plane trees. "Why
don’t we use it more? You may well ask. For the simple reason,
my dear young lady, that half our existence is spent in dealing
with things that have no mind—things with which it is impossible
to hold telepathic communication. Hence the development of the
five senses. I have eyes that preserve me from running into the
lamp-post, ears that warn me I’m in the neighbourhood of Niagara.
And having made these instruments very efficient, I use them even
in holding converse with other beings having a mind. I let my
telepathic faculty lie idle, preferring to employ an elaborate
and cumbrous arrangement of symbols in order to make my thought
known to you through your senses. In certain individuals, however,
the faculty is naturally so well-developed—like the musical, or
the mathematical, or the chess-playing faculties in other people—that
they cannot help entering into direct communication with other
minds, whether they want to or not. If we knew a good method of
educating and drawing out the latent faculty, most of us could
make ourselves moderately efficient telepaths; just as most of
us can make ourselves into moderate musicians, chess players and
mathematicians. There would also be a few, no doubt, who could
never communicate directly. Just as there are a few who cannot
recognize ‘Rule Britannia’ or Bach’s Concerto in D minor for two
violins, and a few who cannot comprehend the nature of an algebraical
symbol. Look at the general development of the mathematical and
musical faculties only within the last two hundred years. By the
twenty-first century, I believe, we shall all be telepaths. Meanwhile,
these delightful birds have forestalled us. Not having the wit
to invent a language or an expressive pantomime, they contrive
to communicate such simple thoughts as they have, directly and
instantaneously. They all go to sleep at once, wake at once, say
the same thing at once; they turn all at once when they’re flying.
Without a leader, without a word of command, they do everything
together, in complete unison. Sitting here in the evenings, I
sometimes fancy I can feel their thoughts striking against my
own. It has happened to me once or twice: that I have known a
second before it actually happened, that the birds were going
to wake up and begin their half-minute of chatter in the dark.
Wait! Hush." Gumbril Senior threw back his head, pressed his hand
over his mouth, as though by commanding silence on himself he
could command it on the whole world. "I believe they’re going
to wake now. I feel it."</p>

<p>He was silent. Mrs. Viveash looked towards the dark trees and
listened. A full minute passed. Then the old gentleman burst out
happily laughing.</p>

<p>"Completely wrong!" he said. "They’ve never been more soundly
asleep." Mrs. Viveash laughed too. "Perhaps they all changed their
minds, just as they were waking up," she suggested.</p>

<p>Gumbril Junior reappeared; glasses clinked as he walked, and
there was a little rattle of crockery. He was carrying a tray.</p>

<p>"Cold beef," he said, "and salad and a bit of a cold apple-pie.
It might be worse."</p>

<p>They drew up chairs to Gumbril Senior’s work-table, and there,
among the letters and the unpaid bills and the sketchy elevations
of archiducal palaces, they ate the beef and the apple-pie, and
drank the one-and-ninepenny <em>vin ordinaire</em> of the house.
Gumbril Senior, who had already supped, looked on at them from
the balcony.</p>

<p>"Did I tell you," said Gumbril Junior, "that we saw Mr. Porteous’s
son the other evening—very drunk?"</p>

<p>Gumbril Senior threw up his hands. "If you knew the calamities
that young imbecile has been the cause of!"</p>

<p>"What’s he done?"</p>

<p>"Gambled away I don’t know how much borrowed money. And poor
Porteous can’t afford anything—even now." Mr. Gumbril shook his
head and clutched and combed his beard. "It’s a fearful blow,
but of course, Porteous is very steadfast and serene and.... There!"
Gumbril Senior interrupted himself, holding up his hand. "Listen!"</p>

<p>In the fourteen plane trees the starlings had suddenly woken
up.</p>

<p>There was a wild outburst, like a stormy sitting in the Italian
Parliament. Then all was silent. Gumbril Senior listened, enchanted.
His face, as he turned back towards the light, revealed itself
all smiles. His hair seemed to have blown loose of its own accord,
from within, so to speak; he pushed it into place.</p>

<p>"You heard them?" he asked Mrs. Viveash. "What can they have
to say to one another, I wonder, at this time of night?"</p>

<p>"And did you feel they were going to wake up?" Mrs. Viveash inquired.</p>

<p>"No," said Gumbril Senior with candour.</p>

<p>"When we’ve finished," Gumbril Junior spoke with his mouth full,
"you must show Myra your model of London. She’d adore it—except
that it has no electric sky-signs."</p>

<p>His father looked all of a sudden very much embarrassed. "I don’t
think it would interest Mrs. Viveash much," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes it would. Really," she declared.</p>

<p>"Well, as a matter of fact it isn’t here." Gumbril Senior pulled
with fury at his beard.</p>

<p>"Not here? But what’s happened to it?"</p>

<p>Gumbril Senior wouldn’t explain. He just ignored his son’s question
and began to talk once more about the starlings. Later on, however,
when Gumbril and Mrs. Viveash were preparing to go, the old man
drew him apart into a corner and began to whisper the explanation.</p>

<p>"I didn’t want to blare it about in front of strangers," he said,
as though it were a question of the housemaid’s illegitimate baby
or a repair to the water-closet. "But the fact is, I’ve sold it.
The Victoria and Albert had wind that I was making it; they’ve
been wanting it all the time. And I’ve let them have it."</p>

<p>"But why?" Gumbril Junior asked in a tone of astonishment. He
knew with what a paternal affection—no, more than paternal; for
he was sure that his father was more whole-heartedly attached
to his models than his son—with what pride he regarded these children
of his spirit.</p>

<p>Gumbril Senior sighed. "It’s all that young imbecile," he said.</p>

<p>"What young imbecile?"</p>

<p>"Porteous’s son, of course. You see, poor Porteous has had to
sell his library, among other things. You don’t know what that
means to him. All these precious books. And collected at the price
of such hardships. I thought I’d like to buy a few of the best
ones back for him. They gave me quite a good price at the Museum."
He came out of his corner and hurried across the room to help
Mrs. Viveash with her cloak. "Allow me, allow me," he said.</p>

<p>Slowly and pensively Gumbril Junior followed him. Beyond good
and evil? Below good and evil? The name of earwig.... The tubby
pony trotted. The wild columbines suspended, among the shadows
of the hazel copse, hooked spurs, helmets of aerial purple. The
twelfth sonata of Mozart was insecticide; no earwigs could crawl
through that music. Emily’s breasts were firm and pointed and
she had slept at last without a tremor. In the starlight, good,
true and beautiful became one. Write the discovery in books—in
books <em>quos</em>, in the morning, <em>legimus cacantes</em>.
They descended the stairs. The cab was waiting outside.</p>

<p>"The Last Ride again," said Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Golgotha Hospital, Southwark," said Gumbril to the driver and
followed her into the cab.</p>

<p>"Drive, drive, drive," repeated Mrs. Viveash. "I like your father,
Theodore. One of these days he’ll fly away with the birds. And
how nice it is of those starlings to wake themselves up like that
in the middle of the night, merely to amuse him. Considering how
unpleasant it is to be woken in the night. Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"We’re going to look at Shearwater in his laboratory."</p>

<p>"Is that a long way away?"</p>

<p>"Immensely," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>"Thank God for that," Mrs. Viveash piously and expiringly breathed. </p>
