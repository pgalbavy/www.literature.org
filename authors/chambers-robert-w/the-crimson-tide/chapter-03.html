<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The dingy little Danish steamer <em>Elsinore</em> passed in at
dawn, her camouflage obscured by sea-salt, her few passengers
still prostrated from the long battering administered by the giant
seas of the northern route.</p>

<p>A lone Yankee soldier was aboard&mdash;an indignant lieutenant of
infantry named Shotwell&mdash;sent home from a fighting regiment to
instruct the ambitious rookie at Camp Upton.</p>

<p>He had hailed his assignment with delight, thankfully rid himself
of his cooties, reported in Paris, reported in London; received
orders to depart via Denmark; and, his mission there fullfilled,
he had sailed on the <em>Elsinore</em>, already disenchanted with
his job and longing to be back with his regiment.</p>

<p>And now, surly from sea-sickness, worried by peace rumours, but
still believing that the war would last another year and hopeful
of getting back before it ended, he emerged from his stuffy quarters
aboard the <em>Elsinore</em> and gazed without enthusiasm at the
minarets of Coney Island, now visible off the starboard bow.</p>

<p>Near him, in pasty-faced and shaky groups, huddled his fellow
passengers, whom he had not seen during the voyage except when
lined up for life-drill.</p>

<p>He had not wished to see them, either, nor, probably, had they
desired to lavish social attentions on him or upon one another.</p>

<p>These pallid, discouraged voyagers were few&mdash;not two dozen cabin
passengers in all.</p>

<p>Who they might be he had no curiosity to know; he had not exchanged
ten words with any of them during the entire and nauseating voyage;
he certainly did not intend to do so now.</p>

<p>He favoured them with a savage glance and walked over to the
port side&mdash;the Jersey side&mdash;where there seemed to be nobody except
a tired Scandinavian sailor or two.</p>

<p>In the grey of morning the Hook loomed up above the sea, gloomy
as a thunder-head charged with lightning.</p>

<p>After a while the batteries along the Narrows slipped into view.
Farther on, camouflaged ships rode sullenly at anchor, as though
ashamed of their frivolous and undignified appearance. A battleship
was just leaving the Lower Bay, smoke pouring from every funnel.
Destroyers and chasers rushed by them, headed seaward.</p>

<p>Then, high over the shore mists and dimly visible through rising
vapours, came speeding a colossal phantom.</p>

<p>Vague as a shark's long shadow sheering translucent depths, the
huge dirigible swept eastward and slid into the Long Island fog.</p>

<p>And at that moment somebody walked plump into young Shotwell;
and the soft, fragrant shock knocked the breath out of both.</p>

<p>She recovered hers first:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry!" she faltered. "It was stupid. I was watching the
balloon and not looking where I was going. I'm afraid I hurt you."</p>

<p>He recovered his breath, saluted ceremoniously, readjusted his
overseas cap to the proper angle.</p>

<p>Then he said, civilly enough: "It was my fault entirely. It was
I who walked into you. I hope I didn't hurt you."</p>

<p>They smiled, unembarrassed.</p>

<p>"That was certainly a big dirigible," he ventured. "There are
bigger Zeps, of course."</p>

<p>"Are there really?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. But they're not much good in war, I believe."</p>

<p>She turned her trim, small head and looked out across the bay;
and Shotwell, who once had had a gaily receptive eye for pulchritude,
thought her unusually pretty.</p>

<p>Also, the steady keel of the <em>Elsinore</em> was making him
feel more human now; and he ventured a further polite observation
concerning the pleasures of homecoming after extended exile.</p>

<p>She turned with a frank shake of her head: "It seems heartless
to say so, but I'm rather sorry I'm back," she said.</p>

<p>He smiled: "I must admit," he confessed, "that I feel the same
way. Of course I want to see my people. But I'd give anything
to be in France at this moment, and that's the truth!"</p>

<p>The girl nodded her comprehension: "It's quite natural," she
remarked. "One does not wish to come home until this thing is
settled."</p>

<p>"That's it exactly. It's like leaving an interesting play half
finished. It's worse&mdash;it's like leaving an absorbing drama in
which you yourself are playing an exciting rôle."</p>

<p>She glanced at him&mdash;a quick glance of intelligent appraisal.</p>

<p>"Yes, it must have seemed that way to you. But I've been merely
one among a breathless audience.... And yet I can't bear to leave
in the very middle&mdash;not knowing how it is to end. Besides," she
added carelessly, "I have nobody to come back to except a rather
remote relative, so my regrets are unmixed."</p>

<p>There ensued a silence. He was afraid she was about to go, but
couldn't seem to think of anything to say to detain her.</p>

<p>For the girl was very attractive to a careless and amiably casual
man of his sort&mdash;the sort who start their little journey through
life with every intention of having the best kind of a time on
the way.</p>

<p>She was so distractingly pretty, so confidently negligent of
convention&mdash;or perhaps disdainful of it&mdash;that he already was regretting
that he had not met her at the beginning of the voyage instead
of at the end.</p>

<p>She had now begun to button up her ulster, as though preliminary
to resuming her deck promenade. And he wanted to walk with her.
But because she had chosen to be informal with him did not deceive
him into thinking that she was likely to tolerate further informality
on his part. And yet he had a vague notion that her inclinations
were friendly.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said rather stupidly, "that I didn't meet you
in the beginning."</p>

<p>The slightest inclination of her head indicated that although
possibly she might be sorry too, regrets were now useless. Then
she turned up the collar of her ulster. The face it framed was
disturbingly lovely. And he took a last chance.</p>

<p>"And so," he ventured politely, "you have really been on board
the <em>Elsinore</em> all this time!"</p>

<p>She turned her charming head toward him, considered him a moment;
then she smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "I've been on board all the time. I didn't crawl
aboard in mid-ocean, you know."</p>

<p>The girl was frankly amused by the streak of boyishness in him&mdash;the
perfectly transparent desire of this young man to detain her in
conversation. And, still amused, she leaned back against the rail.
If he wanted to talk to her she would let him&mdash;even help him.
Why not?</p>

<p>"Is that a wound chevron?" she inquired, looking at the sleeve
of his tunic.</p>

<p>"No," he replied gratefully, "it's a service stripe."</p>

<p>"And what does the little cord around your shoulder signify?"</p>

<p>"That my regiment was cited."</p>

<p>"For bravery?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that was the idea, I believe."</p>

<p>"Then you've been in action."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Over the top?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How many times?"</p>

<p>"Several. Recently it's been more open work, you know."</p>

<p>"And you were not hit?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She regarded him smilingly: "You are like all soldiers have faced
death," she said. "You are not communicative."</p>

<p>At that he reddened. "Well, everybody else was facing it, too,
you know. We all had the same experience."</p>

<p>"Not all," she said, watching him. "Some died."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course."</p>

<p>The girl's face flushed and she nodded emphatically: "Of course!
And <em>that</em> is our Yankee secret;&mdash;embodied in those two
words&mdash;'of course.' That is exactly why the boche runs away from
our men. The boche doesn't know why he runs, but it is because
you all say, 'of course!&mdash;of course we're here to kill and get
killed. What of it? It's in the rules of the game, isn't it? Very
well; we're playing the game!'</p>

<p>"But the rules of the hun game are different. According to their
rules, machine guns are not charged on. That is not according
to plan. Oh, no! But it is in your rules of the game. So after
the boche has killed a number of you, and you say, 'of course,'
and you keep coming on, it first bewilders the boche, then terrifies
him. And the next time he sees you coming he takes to his heels."</p>

<p>Shotwell, amused, fascinated, and entirely surprised, began to
laugh.</p>

<p>"You seem to know the game pretty well yourself," he said. "You
are quite right. That is the idea."</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful game," she mused. "I can understand why you
are not pleased at being ordered home."</p>

<p>"It's rather rotten luck when the outfit had just been cited,"
he explained.</p>

<p>"Oh. I should think you <em>would</em> hate to come back!" exclaimed
the girl, with frank sympathy.</p>

<p>"Well, I was glad at first, but I'm sorry now. I'm missing a
lot, you see."</p>

<p>"Why did they send you back?"</p>

<p>"To instruct rookies!" he said with a grimace. "Rather inglorious,
isn't it? But I'm hoping I'll have time to weather this detail
and get back again before we reach the Rhine."</p>

<p>"I want to get back again, too," she reflected aloud, biting
her lip and letting her dark eyes rest on the foggy statue of
Liberty, towering up ahead.</p>

<p>"What was your branch?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't do anything," she exclaimed, flushing. "I've been
in Russia. And now I must find out at once what I can do to be
sent to France."</p>

<p>"The war caught you over there, I suppose," he hazarded.</p>

<p>"Yes.... I've been there since I was twenty. I'm twenty-four.
I had a year's travel and study and then I became the American
companion of the little Russian Grand Duchess Marie."</p>

<p>"They all were murdered, weren't they?" he asked, much interested.</p>

<p>"Yes.... I'm trying to forget&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It's quite all right. I, myself, mentioned it first; but I can't
talk about it yet. It's too personal&#11834;" She turned and looked
at the monstrous city.</p>

<p>After a silence: "It's been a rotten voyage, hasn't it?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"Perfectly rotten. I was so ill I could scarcely keep my place
during life-drill.... I didn't see you there," she added with
a faint smile, "but I'm sure you were aboard, even if you seem
to doubt that I was."</p>

<p>And then, perhaps considering that she had been sufficiently
amiable to him, she gave him his congé with a pleasant little
nod.</p>

<p>"Could I help you&mdash;do anything&mdash;" he began. But she thanked him
with friendly finality.</p>

<p>They sauntered in opposite directions; and he did not see her
again to speak to her.</p>

<p>Later, jolting toward home in a taxi, it occurred to him that
it might have been agreeable to see such an attractively informal
girl again. Any man likes informality in women, except among the
women of his own household, where he would promptly brand it as
indiscretion.</p>

<p>He thought of her for a while, recollecting details of the episode
and realising that he didn't even know her name. Which piqued
him.</p>

<p>"Serves me right," he said aloud with a shrug of finality. "I
had more enterprise once."</p>

<p>Then he looked out into the sunlit streets of Manhattan, all
brilliant with flags and posters and swarming with prosperous
looking people&mdash;his own people. But to his war-enlightened and
disillusioned eyes his own people seemed almost like aliens; he
vaguely resented their too evident prosperity, their irresponsible
immunity, their heedless preoccupation with the petty things of
life. The acres of bright flags fluttering above them, the posters
that made a gay back-ground for the scene, the sheltered, undisturbed
routine of peace seemed to annoy him.</p>

<p>An odd irritation invaded him; he had a sudden impulse to stop
his taxi and shout, "Fat-heads! Get into the game! Don't you know
the world's on fire? Don't you know what a hun really is? You'd
better look out and get busy!"</p>

<p>Fifth Avenue irritated him&mdash;shops, hotels, clubs, motors, the
well-dressed throngs began to exasperate him.</p>

<p>On a side street he caught a glimpse of his own place of business;
and it almost nauseated him to remember old man Sharrow, and the
walls hung with plans of streets and sewers and surveys and photographs;
and his own yellow oak desk&#11834;</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he thought. "If the war ends, have I got to go back
to that!&#11834;"</p>

<p>The family were at breakfast when he walked in on them&mdash;only
two&mdash;his father and mother.</p>

<p>In his mother's arms he suddenly felt very young and subdued,
and very glad to be there.</p>

<p>"Where the devil did you come from, Jim?" repeated his father,
with twitching features and a grip on his son's strong hand that
he could not bring himself to loosen.</p>

<p>Yes, it was pretty good to get home, after all&mdash; ... And he might
not have come back at all. He realised it, now, in his mother's
arms, feeling very humble and secure.</p>

<p>His mother had realised it, too, in every waking hour since the
day her only son had sailed at night&mdash;that had been the hardest!&mdash;at
night&mdash;and at an unnamed hour of an unnamed day!&mdash;her only son&mdash;gone
in the darkness&#11834;</p>

<p>On his way upstairs, he noticed a red service flag bearing a
single star hanging in his mother's window.</p>

<p>He went into his own room, looked soberly around, sat down on
the lounge, suddenly tired.</p>

<p>He had three days' leave before reporting for duty. It seemed
a miserly allowance. Instinctively he glanced at his wrist-watch.
An hour had fled already.</p>

<p>"The dickens!" he muttered. But he still sat there. After a while
he smiled to himself and rose leisurely to make his toilet.</p>

<p>"Such an attractively informal girl," he thought regretfully.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I didn't learn her name. Why didn't I?"</p>

<p>Philosophy might have answered: "But to what purpose? No young
man expects to pick up a girl of his own kind. And he has no business
with other kinds."</p>

<p>But Shotwell was no philosopher.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>The "attractively informal girl," on whom young Shotwell was
condescending to bestow a passing regret while changing his linen,
had, however, quite forgotten him by this time. There is more
philosophy in women.</p>

<p>Her train was now nearing Shadow Hill; she already could see
the village in its early winter nakedness&mdash;the stone bridge, the
old-time houses of the well-to-do, Main Street full of automobiles
and farmers' wagons, a crowded trolley-car starting for Deepdale,
the county seat.</p>

<p>After four years the crudity of it all astonished her&mdash;the stark
vulgarity of Main Street in the sunshine, every mean, flimsy architectural
detail revealed&mdash;the dingy trolley poles, the telegraph poles
loaded with unlovely wires and battered little electric light
fixtures&mdash;the uncompromising, unrelieved ugliness of street and
people, of shop and vehicle, of treeless sidewalks, brick pavement,
car rails, hydrants, and rusty gasoline pumps.</p>

<p>Here was a people ignorant of civic pride, knowing no necessity
for beauty, having no standards, no aspirations, conscious of
nothing but the grosser material needs.</p>

<p>The hopelessness of this American town&mdash;and there were thousands
like it&mdash;its architectural squalor, its animal unconsciousness,
shocked her after four years in lands where colour, symmetry and
good taste are indigenous and beauty as necessary as bread.</p>

<p>And the girl had been born here, too; had known no other home
except when at boarding school or on shopping trips to New York.</p>

<p>Painfully depressed, she descended at the station, where she
climbed into one of the familiar omnibuses and gave her luggage
check to the lively young driver.</p>

<p>Several drummers also got in, and finally a farmer whom she recognised
but who had evidently forgotten her.</p>

<p>The driver, a talkative young man whom she remembered as an obnoxious
boy who delivered newspapers, came from the express office with
her trunk, flung it on top of the bus, gossiped with several station
idlers, then leisurely mounted his seat and gathered up the reins.</p>

<p>Rattling along the main street she became aware of changes&mdash;a
brand new yellow brick clothing store&mdash;a dreadful Quick Lunch&mdash;a
moving picture theatre&mdash;other monstrosities. And she saw familiar
faces on the street.</p>

<p>The drummers got out with their sample cases at the Bolton House
&mdash;Charles H. Bolton, proprietor. The farmer descended at
the "Par Excellence Market," where, as he informed the driver,
he expected to dispose of a bull calf which he had finally decided
"to veal."</p>

<p>"Which way, ma'am?" inquired the driver, looking in at her through
the door and chewing gum very fast.</p>

<p>"To Miss Dumont's on Shadow Street."</p>

<p>"Oh!..." Then, suddenly he knew her. "Say, wasn't you her niece?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> Miss Dumont's niece," replied Palla, smiling.</p>

<p>"Sure! I didn't reckonise you. Used to leave the <em>Star</em>
on your doorstep! Been away, ain't you? Home looks kinda good
to you, even if it's kinda lonesome&mdash;" He checked himself as though
recollecting something else. "Sure! You been over in Rooshia livin'
with the Queen! There was a piece in the <em>Star</em> about it.
Gee!" he added affably. "That was pretty soft! Some life, I bet!"</p>

<p>And he grinned a genial grin and climbed into his seat, chewing
rapidly.</p>

<p>"He means to be friendly," thought the heart-sick girl, with
a shudder.</p>

<p>When Palla got out she spoke pleasantly to him as she paid him,
and inquired about his father&mdash;a shiftless old gaffer who used,
sometimes, to do garden work for her aunt.</p>

<p>But the driver, obsessed by the fact that she had lived with
the "Queen of Rooshia," merely grinned and repeated, "Pretty soft,"
and, shouldering her trunk, walked to the front door, chewing
furiously.</p>

<p>Martha opened the door, stared through her spectacles.</p>

<p>"Land o' mercy!" she gasped. "It's Palla!" Which, in Shadow Hill,
is the manner and speech of the "hired girl," whose "folks" are
"neighbours" and not inferiors.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Martha," said the girl smilingly; and offered
her gloved hand.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm so's to be 'round&mdash;" She wheeled on the man with the
trunk: "Here, <em>you</em>! Don't go-a-trackin' mud all over my
carpet like that! Wipe your feet like as if you was brought up
respectful!"</p>

<p>"Ain't I wipin' em?" retorted the driver, in an injured voice.
"Now then, Marthy, where does this here trunk go to?"</p>

<p>"Big room front&mdash;wait, young fellow; you just follow me and be
careful don't bang the banisters&#11834;"</p>

<p>Half way up she called back over her shoulder: "Your room's all
ready, Palla&mdash;" and suddenly remembered something else and stood
aside on the landing until the young man with the trunk had passed
her; then waited for him to return and get himself out of the
house. Then, when he had gone out, banging the door, she came
slowly back down the stairs and met Palla ascending.</p>

<p>"Where is my aunt?" asked Palla.</p>

<p>And, as Martha remained silent, gazing oddly down at her through
her glasses:</p>

<p>"My aunt isn't ill, is she?"</p>

<p>"No, she ain't ill. H'ain't you heard?"</p>

<p>"Heard what?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you get my letter?"</p>

<p>"<em>Your</em> letter? Why did <em>you</em> write? What is the
matter? Where is my aunt?" asked the disturbed girl.</p>

<p>"I wrote you last month."</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> did you write?"</p>

<p>"You never got it?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't! What has happened to my aunt?"</p>

<p>"She had a stroke, Palla."</p>

<p>"What! Is&mdash;is she dead!"</p>

<p>"Six weeks ago come Sunday."</p>

<p>The girl's knees weakened and she sat down suddenly on the stairs.</p>

<p>"Dead? My Aunt Emeline?"</p>

<p>"She had a stroke a year ago. It made her a little stiff in one
leg. But she wouldn't tell you&mdash;wouldn't bother you. She was that
proud of you living as you did with all those kings and queens.
'No,' sez she to me, 'no, Martha, I ain't a-goin' to worry Palla.
She and the Queen have got their hands full, what with the wicked
way those Rooshian people are behaving. No,' sez she, 'I'll git
well by the time she comes home for a visit after the war&#11834;'"</p>

<p>Martha's spectacles became dim. She seated herself on the stairs
and wiped them on her apron.</p>

<p>"It came in the night," she said, peering blindly at Palla....
"I wondered why she was late to breakfast. When I went up she
was lying there with her eyes open&mdash;just as natural&#11834;"</p>

<p>Palla's head dropped and she covered her face with both hands.</p>
