<p>Gudrun was away in London, having a little show of her work, with a
friend, and looking round, preparing for flight from Beldover. Come
what might she would be on the wing in a very short time. She received
a letter from Winifred Crich, ornamented with drawings.</p>

<p>'Father also has been to London, to be examined by the doctors. It made
him very tired. They say he must rest a very great deal, so he is
mostly in bed. He brought me a lovely tropical parrot in faience, of
Dresden ware, also a man ploughing, and two mice climbing up a stalk,
also in faience. The mice were Copenhagen ware. They are the best, but
mice don't shine so much, otherwise they are very good, their tails are
slim and long. They all shine nearly like glass. Of course it is the
glaze, but I don't like it. Gerald likes the man ploughing the best,
his trousers are torn, he is ploughing with an ox, being I suppose a
German peasant. It is all grey and white, white shirt and grey
trousers, but very shiny and clean. Mr Birkin likes the girl best,
under the hawthorn blossom, with a lamb, and with daffodils painted on
her skirts, in the drawing room. But that is silly, because the lamb is
not a real lamb, and she is silly too.</p>

<p>'Dear Miss Brangwen, are you coming back soon, you are very much missed
here. I enclose a drawing of father sitting up in bed. He says he hopes
you are not going to forsake us. Oh dear Miss Brangwen, I am sure you
won't. Do come back and draw the ferrets, they are the most lovely
noble darlings in the world. We might carve them in holly-wood, playing
against a background of green leaves. Oh do let us, for they are most
beautiful.</p>

<p>'Father says we might have a studio. Gerald says we could easily have a
beautiful one over the stables, it would only need windows to be put in
the slant of the roof, which is a simple matter. Then you could stay
here all day and work, and we could live in the studio, like two real
artists, like the man in the picture in the hall, with the frying-pan
and the walls all covered with drawings. I long to be free, to live the
free life of an artist. Even Gerald told father that only an artist is
free, because he lives in a creative world of his own - '</p>

<p>Gudrun caught the drift of the family intentions, in this letter.
Gerald wanted her to be attached to the household at Shortlands, he was
using Winifred as his stalking-horse. The father thought only of his
child, he saw a rock of salvation in Gudrun. And Gudrun admired him for
his perspicacity. The child, moreover, was really exceptional. Gudrun
was quite content. She was quite willing, given a studio, to spend her
days at Shortlands. She disliked the Grammar School already thoroughly,
she wanted to be free. If a studio were provided, she would be free to
go on with her work, she would await the turn of events with complete
serenity. And she was really interested in Winifred, she would be quite
glad to understand the girl.</p>

<p>So there was quite a little festivity on Winifred's account, the day
Gudrun returned to Shortlands.</p>

<p>'You should make a bunch of flowers to give to Miss Brangwen when she
arrives,' Gerald said smiling to his sister.</p>

<p>'Oh no,' cried Winifred, 'it's silly.'</p>

<p>'Not at all. It is a very charming and ordinary attention.'</p>

<p>'Oh, it is silly,' protested Winifred, with all the extreme MAUVAISE
HONTE of her years. Nevertheless, the idea appealed to her. She wanted
very much to carry it out. She flitted round the green-houses and the
conservatory looking wistfully at the flowers on their stems. And the
more she looked, the more she LONGED to have a bunch of the blossoms
she saw, the more fascinated she became with her little vision of
ceremony, and the more consumedly shy and self-conscious she grew, till
she was almost beside herself. She could not get the idea out of her
mind. It was as if some haunting challenge prompted her, and she had
not enough courage to take it up. So again she drifted into the
green-houses, looking at the lovely roses in their pots, and at the
virginal cyclamens, and at the mystic white clusters of a creeper. The
beauty, oh the beauty of them, and oh the paradisal bliss, if she
should have a perfect bouquet and could give it to Gudrun the next day.
Her passion and her complete indecision almost made her ill.</p>

<p>At last she slid to her father's side.</p>

<p>'Daddie - ' she said.</p>

<p>'What, my precious?'</p>

<p>But she hung back, the tears almost coming to her eyes, in her
sensitive confusion. Her father looked at her, and his heart ran hot
with tenderness, an anguish of poignant love.</p>

<p>'What do you want to say to me, my love?'</p>

<p>'Daddie - !' her eyes smiled laconically - 'isn't it silly if I give Miss
Brangwen some flowers when she comes?'</p>

<p>The sick man looked at the bright, knowing eyes of his child, and his
heart burned with love.</p>

<p>'No, darling, that's not silly. It's what they do to queens.'</p>

<p>This was not very reassuring to Winifred. She half suspected that
queens in themselves were a silliness. Yet she so wanted her little
romantic occasion.</p>

<p>'Shall I then?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Give Miss Brangwen some flowers? Do, Birdie. Tell Wilson I say you are
to have what you want.'</p>

<p>The child smiled a small, subtle, unconscious smile to herself, in
anticipation of her way.</p>

<p>'But I won't get them till tomorrow,' she said.</p>

<p>'Not till tomorrow, Birdie. Give me a kiss then - '</p>

<p>Winifred silently kissed the sick man, and drifted out of the room. She
again went the round of the green-houses and the conservatory,
informing the gardener, in her high, peremptory, simple fashion, of
what she wanted, telling him all the blooms she had selected.</p>

<p>'What do you want these for?' Wilson asked.</p>

<p>'I want them,' she said. She wished servants did not ask questions.</p>

<p>'Ay, you've said as much. But what do you want them for, for
decoration, or to send away, or what?'</p>

<p>'I want them for a presentation bouquet.'</p>

<p>'A presentation bouquet! Who's coming then? - the Duchess of Portland?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Oh, not her? Well you'll have a rare poppy-show if you put all the
things you've mentioned into your bouquet.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I want a rare poppy-show.'</p>

<p>'You do! Then there's no more to be said.'</p>

<p>The next day Winifred, in a dress of silvery velvet, and holding a
gaudy bunch of flowers in her hand, waited with keen impatience in the
schoolroom, looking down the drive for Gudrun's arrival. It was a wet
morning. Under her nose was the strange fragrance of hot-house flowers,
the bunch was like a little fire to her, she seemed to have a strange
new fire in her heart. This slight sense of romance stirred her like an
intoxicant.</p>

<p>At last she saw Gudrun coming, and she ran downstairs to warn her
father and Gerald. They, laughing at her anxiety and gravity, came with
her into the hall. The man-servant came hastening to the door, and
there he was, relieving Gudrun of her umbrella, and then of her
raincoat. The welcoming party hung back till their visitor entered the
hall.</p>

<p>Gudrun was flushed with the rain, her hair was blown in loose little
curls, she was like a flower just opened in the rain, the heart of the
blossom just newly visible, seeming to emit a warmth of retained
sunshine. Gerald winced in spirit, seeing her so beautiful and unknown.
She was wearing a soft blue dress, and her stockings were of dark red.</p>

<p>Winifred advanced with odd, stately formality.</p>

<p>'We are so glad you've come back,' she said. 'These are your flowers.'
She presented the bouquet.</p>

<p>'Mine!' cried Gudrun. She was suspended for a moment, then a vivid
flush went over her, she was as if blinded for a moment with a flame of
pleasure. Then her eyes, strange and flaming, lifted and looked at the
father, and at Gerald. And again Gerald shrank in spirit, as if it
would be more than he could bear, as her hot, exposed eyes rested on
him. There was something so revealed, she was revealed beyond bearing,
to his eyes. He turned his face aside. And he felt he would not be able
to avert her. And he writhed under the imprisonment.</p>

<p>Gudrun put her face into the flowers.</p>

<p>'But how beautiful they are!' she said, in a muffled voice. Then, with
a strange, suddenly revealed passion, she stooped and kissed Winifred.</p>

<p>Mr Crich went forward with his hand held out to her.</p>

<p>'I was afraid you were going to run away from us,' he said, playfully.</p>

<p>Gudrun looked up at him with a luminous, roguish, unknown face.</p>

<p>'Really!' she replied. 'No, I didn't want to stay in London.' Her voice
seemed to imply that she was glad to get back to Shortlands, her tone
was warm and subtly caressing.</p>

<p>'That is a good thing,' smiled the father. 'You see you are very
welcome here among us.'</p>

<p>Gudrun only looked into his face with dark-blue, warm, shy eyes. She
was unconsciously carried away by her own power.</p>

<p>'And you look as if you came home in every possible triumph,' Mr Crich
continued, holding her hand.</p>

<p>'No,' she said, glowing strangely. 'I haven't had any triumph till I
came here.'</p>

<p>'Ah, come, come! We're not going to hear any of those tales. Haven't we
read notices in the newspaper, Gerald?'</p>

<p>'You came off pretty well,' said Gerald to her, shaking hands. 'Did you
sell anything?'</p>

<p>'No,' she said, 'not much.'</p>

<p>'Just as well,' he said.</p>

<p>She wondered what he meant. But she was all aglow with her reception,
carried away by this little flattering ceremonial on her behalf.</p>

<p>'Winifred,' said the father, 'have you a pair of shoes for Miss
Brangwen? You had better change at once - '</p>

<p>Gudrun went out with her bouquet in her hand.</p>

<p>'Quite a remarkable young woman,' said the father to Gerald, when she
had gone.</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied Gerald briefly, as if he did not like the observation.</p>

<p>Mr Crich liked Gudrun to sit with him for half an hour. Usually he was
ashy and wretched, with all the life gnawed out of him. But as soon as
he rallied, he liked to make believe that he was just as before, quite
well and in the midst of life - not of the outer world, but in the midst
of a strong essential life. And to this belief, Gudrun contributed
perfectly. With her, he could get by stimulation those precious
half-hours of strength and exaltation and pure freedom, when he seemed
to live more than he had ever lived.</p>

<p>She came to him as he lay propped up in the library. His face was like
yellow wax, his eyes darkened, as it were sightless. His black beard,
now streaked with grey, seemed to spring out of the waxy flesh of a
corpse. Yet the atmosphere about him was energetic and playful. Gudrun
subscribed to this, perfectly. To her fancy, he was just an ordinary
man. Only his rather terrible appearance was photographed upon her
soul, away beneath her consciousness. She knew that, in spite of his
playfulness, his eyes could not change from their darkened vacancy,
they were the eyes of a man who is dead.</p>

<p>'Ah, this is Miss Brangwen,' he said, suddenly rousing as she entered,
announced by the man-servant. 'Thomas, put Miss Brangwen a chair
here - that's right.' He looked at her soft, fresh face with pleasure.
It gave him the illusion of life. 'Now, you will have a glass of sherry
and a little piece of cake. Thomas - '</p>

<p>'No thank you,' said Gudrun. And as soon as she had said it, her heart
sank horribly. The sick man seemed to fall into a gap of death, at her
contradiction. She ought to play up to him, not to contravene him. In
an instant she was smiling her rather roguish smile.</p>

<p>'I don't like sherry very much,' she said. 'But I like almost anything
else.'</p>

<p>The sick man caught at this straw instantly.</p>

<p>'Not sherry! No! Something else! What then? What is there, Thomas?'</p>

<p>'Port wine - curacao - '</p>

<p>'I would love some curacao - ' said Gudrun, looking at the sick man
confidingly.</p>

<p>'You would. Well then Thomas, curacao - and a little cake, or a
biscuit?'</p>

<p>'A biscuit,' said Gudrun. She did not want anything, but she was wise.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>He waited till she was settled with her little glass and her biscuit.
Then he was satisfied.</p>

<p>'You have heard the plan,' he said with some excitement, 'for a studio
for Winifred, over the stables?'</p>

<p>'No!' exclaimed Gudrun, in mock wonder.</p>

<p>'Oh! - I thought Winnie wrote it to you, in her letter!'</p>

<p>'Oh - yes - of course. But I thought perhaps it was only her own little
idea - ' Gudrun smiled subtly, indulgently. The sick man smiled also,
elated.</p>

<p>'Oh no. It is a real project. There is a good room under the roof of
the stables - with sloping rafters. We had thought of converting it into
a studio.'</p>

<p>'How VERY nice that would be!' cried Gudrun, with excited warmth. The
thought of the rafters stirred her.</p>

<p>'You think it would? Well, it can be done.'</p>

<p>'But how perfectly splendid for Winifred! Of course, it is just what is
needed, if she is to work at all seriously. One must have one's
workshop, otherwise one never ceases to be an amateur.'</p>

<p>'Is that so? Yes. Of course, I should like you to share it with
Winifred.'</p>

<p>'Thank you SO much.'</p>

<p>Gudrun knew all these things already, but she must look shy and very
grateful, as if overcome.</p>

<p>'Of course, what I should like best, would be if you could give up your
work at the Grammar School, and just avail yourself of the studio, and
work there - well, as much or as little as you liked - '</p>

<p>He looked at Gudrun with dark, vacant eyes. She looked back at him as
if full of gratitude. These phrases of a dying man were so complete and
natural, coming like echoes through his dead mouth.</p>

<p>'And as to your earnings - you don't mind taking from me what you have
taken from the Education Committee, do you? I don't want you to be a
loser.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said Gudrun, 'if I can have the studio and work there, I can earn
money enough, really I can.'</p>

<p>'Well,' he said, pleased to be the benefactor, 'we can see about all
that. You wouldn't mind spending your days here?'</p>

<p>'If there were a studio to work in,' said Gudrun, 'I could ask for
nothing better.'</p>

<p>'Is that so?'</p>

<p>He was really very pleased. But already he was getting tired. She could
see the grey, awful semi-consciousness of mere pain and dissolution
coming over him again, the torture coming into the vacancy of his
darkened eyes. It was not over yet, this process of death. She rose
softly saying:</p>

<p>'Perhaps you will sleep. I must look for Winifred.'</p>

<p>She went out, telling the nurse that she had left him. Day by day the
tissue of the sick man was further and further reduced, nearer and
nearer the process came, towards the last knot which held the human
being in its unity. But this knot was hard and unrelaxed, the will of
the dying man never gave way. He might be dead in nine-tenths, yet the
remaining tenth remained unchanged, till it too was torn apart. With
his will he held the unit of himself firm, but the circle of his power
was ever and ever reduced, it would be reduced to a point at last, then
swept away.</p>

<p>To adhere to life, he must adhere to human relationships, and he caught
at every straw. Winifred, the butler, the nurse, Gudrun, these were the
people who meant all to him, in these last resources. Gerald, in his
father's presence, stiffened with repulsion. It was so, to a less
degree, with all the other children except Winifred. They could not see
anything but the death, when they looked at their father. It was as if
some subterranean dislike overcame them. They could not see the
familiar face, hear the familiar voice. They were overwhelmed by the
antipathy of visible and audible death. Gerald could not breathe in his
father's presence. He must get out at once. And so, in the same way,
the father could not bear the presence of his son. It sent a final
irritation through the soul of the dying man.</p>

<p>The studio was made ready, Gudrun and Winifred moved in. They enjoyed
so much the ordering and the appointing of it. And now they need hardly
be in the house at all. They had their meals in the studio, they lived
there safely. For the house was becoming dreadful. There were two
nurses in white, flitting silently about, like heralds of death. The
father was confined to his bed, there was a come and go of SOTTO-VOCE
sisters and brothers and children.</p>

<p>Winifred was her father's constant visitor. Every morning, after
breakfast, she went into his room when he was washed and propped up in
bed, to spend half an hour with him.</p>

<p>'Are you better, Daddie?' she asked him invariably.</p>

<p>And invariably he answered:</p>

<p>'Yes, I think I'm a little better, pet.'</p>

<p>She held his hand in both her own, lovingly and protectively. And this
was very dear to him.</p>

<p>She ran in again as a rule at lunch time, to tell him the course of
events, and every evening, when the curtains were drawn, and his room
was cosy, she spent a long time with him. Gudrun was gone home,
Winifred was alone in the house: she liked best to be with her father.
They talked and prattled at random, he always as if he were well, just
the same as when he was going about. So that Winifred, with a child's
subtle instinct for avoiding the painful things, behaved as if nothing
serious was the matter. Instinctively, she withheld her attention, and
was happy. Yet in her remoter soul, she knew as well as the adults
knew: perhaps better.</p>

<p>Her father was quite well in his make-belief with her. But when she
went away, he relapsed under the misery of his dissolution. But still
there were these bright moments, though as his strength waned, his
faculty for attention grew weaker, and the nurse had to send Winifred
away, to save him from exhaustion.</p>

<p>He never admitted that he was going to die. He knew it was so, he knew
it was the end. Yet even to himself he did not admit it. He hated the
fact, mortally. His will was rigid. He could not bear being overcome by
death. For him, there was no death. And yet, at times, he felt a great
need to cry out and to wail and complain. He would have liked to cry
aloud to Gerald, so that his son should be horrified out of his
composure. Gerald was instinctively aware of this, and he recoiled, to
avoid any such thing. This uncleanness of death repelled him too much.
One should die quickly, like the Romans, one should be master of one's
fate in dying as in living. He was convulsed in the clasp of this death
of his father's, as in the coils of the great serpent of Laocoon. The
great serpent had got the father, and the son was dragged into the
embrace of horrifying death along with him. He resisted always. And in
some strange way, he was a tower of strength to his father.</p>

<p>The last time the dying man asked to see Gudrun he was grey with near
death. Yet he must see someone, he must, in the intervals of
consciousness, catch into connection with the living world, lest he
should have to accept his own situation. Fortunately he was most of his
time dazed and half gone. And he spent many hours dimly thinking of the
past, as it were, dimly re-living his old experiences. But there were
times even to the end when he was capable of realising what was
happening to him in the present, the death that was on him. And these
were the times when he called in outside help, no matter whose. For to
realise this death that he was dying was a death beyond death, never to
be borne. It was an admission never to be made.</p>

<p>Gudrun was shocked by his appearance, and by the darkened, almost
disintegrated eyes, that still were unconquered and firm.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said in his weakened voice, 'and how are you and Winifred
getting on?'</p>

<p>'Oh, very well indeed,' replied Gudrun.</p>

<p>There were slight dead gaps in the conversation, as if the ideas called
up were only elusive straws floating on the dark chaos of the sick
man's dying.</p>

<p>'The studio answers all right?' he said.</p>

<p>'Splendid. It couldn't be more beautiful and perfect,' said Gudrun.</p>

<p>She waited for what he would say next.</p>

<p>'And you think Winifred has the makings of a sculptor?'</p>

<p>It was strange how hollow the words were, meaningless.</p>

<p>'I'm sure she has. She will do good things one day.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Then her life won't be altogether wasted, you think?'</p>

<p>Gudrun was rather surprised.</p>

<p>'Sure it won't!' she exclaimed softly.</p>

<p>'That's right.'</p>

<p>Again Gudrun waited for what he would say.</p>

<p>'You find life pleasant, it is good to live, isn't it?' he asked, with
a pitiful faint smile that was almost too much for Gudrun.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she smiled - she would lie at random - 'I get a pretty good time I
believe.'</p>

<p>'That's right. A happy nature is a great asset.'</p>

<p>Again Gudrun smiled, though her soul was dry with repulsion. Did one
have to die like this - having the life extracted forcibly from one,
whilst one smiled and made conversation to the end? Was there no other
way? Must one go through all the horror of this victory over death, the
triumph of the integral will, that would not be broken till it
disappeared utterly? One must, it was the only way. She admired the
self-possession and the control of the dying man exceedingly. But she
loathed the death itself. She was glad the everyday world held good,
and she need not recognise anything beyond.</p>

<p>'You are quite all right here? - nothing we can do for you? - nothing you
find wrong in your position?'</p>

<p>'Except that you are too good to me,' said Gudrun.</p>

<p>'Ah, well, the fault of that lies with yourself,' he said, and he felt
a little exultation, that he had made this speech.</p>

<p>He was still so strong and living! But the nausea of death began to
creep back on him, in reaction.</p>

<p>Gudrun went away, back to Winifred. Mademoiselle had left, Gudrun
stayed a good deal at Shortlands, and a tutor came in to carry on
Winifred's education. But he did not live in the house, he was
connected with the Grammar School.</p>

<p>One day, Gudrun was to drive with Winifred and Gerald and Birkin to
town, in the car. It was a dark, showery day. Winifred and Gudrun were
ready and waiting at the door. Winifred was very quiet, but Gudrun had
not noticed. Suddenly the child asked, in a voice of unconcern:</p>

<p>'Do you think my father's going to die, Miss Brangwen?'</p>

<p>Gudrun started.</p>

<p>'I don't know,' she replied.</p>

<p>'Don't you truly?'</p>

<p>'Nobody knows for certain. He MAY die, of course.'</p>

<p>The child pondered a few moments, then she asked:</p>

<p>'But do you THINK he will die?'</p>

<p>It was put almost like a question in geography or science, insistent,
as if she would force an admission from the adult. The watchful,
slightly triumphant child was almost diabolical.</p>

<p>'Do I think he will die?' repeated Gudrun. 'Yes, I do.'</p>

<p>But Winifred's large eyes were fixed on her, and the girl did not move.</p>

<p>'He is very ill,' said Gudrun.</p>

<p>A small smile came over Winifred's face, subtle and sceptical.</p>

<p>'I don't believe he will,' the child asserted, mockingly, and she moved
away into the drive. Gudrun watched the isolated figure, and her heart
stood still. Winifred was playing with a little rivulet of water,
absorbedly as if nothing had been said.</p>

<p>'I've made a proper dam,' she said, out of the moist distance.</p>

<p>Gerald came to the door from out of the hall behind.</p>

<p>'It is just as well she doesn't choose to believe it,' he said.</p>

<p>Gudrun looked at him. Their eyes met; and they exchanged a sardonic
understanding.</p>

<p>'Just as well,' said Gudrun.</p>

<p>He looked at her again, and a fire flickered up in his eyes.</p>

<p>'Best to dance while Rome burns, since it must burn, don't you think?'
he said.</p>

<p>She was rather taken aback. But, gathering herself together, she
replied:</p>

<p>'Oh - better dance than wail, certainly.'</p>

<p>'So I think.'</p>

<p>And they both felt the subterranean desire to let go, to fling away
everything, and lapse into a sheer unrestraint, brutal and licentious.
A strange black passion surged up pure in Gudrun. She felt strong. She
felt her hands so strong, as if she could tear the world asunder with
them. She remembered the abandonments of Roman licence, and her heart
grew hot. She knew she wanted this herself also - or something,
something equivalent. Ah, if that which was unknown and suppressed in
her were once let loose, what an orgiastic and satisfying event it
would be. And she wanted it, she trembled slightly from the proximity
of the man, who stood just behind her, suggestive of the same black
licentiousness that rose in herself. She wanted it with him, this
unacknowledged frenzy. For a moment the clear perception of this
preoccupied her, distinct and perfect in its final reality. Then she
shut it off completely, saying:</p>

<p>'We might as well go down to the lodge after Winifred - we can get in
the care there.'</p>

<p>'So we can,' he answered, going with her.</p>

<p>They found Winifred at the lodge admiring the litter of purebred white
puppies. The girl looked up, and there was a rather ugly, unseeing cast
in her eyes as she turned to Gerald and Gudrun. She did not want to see
them.</p>

<p>'Look!' she cried. 'Three new puppies! Marshall says this one seems
perfect. Isn't it a sweetling? But it isn't so nice as its mother.' She
turned to caress the fine white bull-terrier bitch that stood uneasily
near her.</p>

<p>'My dearest Lady Crich,' she said, 'you are beautiful as an angel on
earth. Angel - angel - don't you think she's good enough and beautiful
enough to go to heaven, Gudrun? They will be in heaven, won't they - and
ESPECIALLY my darling Lady Crich! Mrs Marshall, I say!'</p>

<p>'Yes, Miss Winifred?' said the woman, appearing at the door.</p>

<p>'Oh do call this one Lady Winifred, if she turns out perfect, will you?
Do tell Marshall to call it Lady Winifred.'</p>

<p>'I'll tell him - but I'm afraid that's a gentleman puppy, Miss
Winifred.'</p>

<p>'Oh NO!' There was the sound of a car. 'There's Rupert!' cried the
child, and she ran to the gate.</p>

<p>Birkin, driving his car, pulled up outside the lodge gate.</p>

<p>'We're ready!' cried Winifred. 'I want to sit in front with you,
Rupert. May I?'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid you'll fidget about and fall out,' he said.</p>

<p>'No I won't. I do want to sit in front next to you. It makes my feet so
lovely and warm, from the engines.'</p>

<p>Birkin helped her up, amused at sending Gerald to sit by Gudrun in the
body of the car.</p>

<p>'Have you any news, Rupert?' Gerald called, as they rushed along the
lanes.</p>

<p>'News?' exclaimed Birkin.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Gerald looked at Gudrun, who sat by his side, and he said, his
eyes narrowly laughing, 'I want to know whether I ought to congratulate
him, but I can't get anything definite out of him.'</p>

<p>Gudrun flushed deeply.</p>

<p>'Congratulate him on what?' she asked.</p>

<p>'There was some mention of an engagement - at least, he said something
to me about it.'</p>

<p>Gudrun flushed darkly.</p>

<p>'You mean with Ursula?' she said, in challenge.</p>

<p>'Yes. That is so, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'I don't think there's any engagement,' said Gudrun, coldly.</p>

<p>'That so? Still no developments, Rupert?' he called.</p>

<p>'Where? Matrimonial? No.'</p>

<p>'How's that?' called Gudrun.</p>

<p>Birkin glanced quickly round. There was irritation in his eyes also.</p>

<p>'Why?' he replied. 'What do you think of it, Gudrun?'</p>

<p>'Oh,' she cried, determined to fling her stone also into the pool,
since they had begun, 'I don't think she wants an engagement.
Naturally, she's a bird that prefers the bush.' Gudrun's voice was
clear and gong-like. It reminded Rupert of her father's, so strong and
vibrant.</p>

<p>'And I,' said Birkin, his face playful but yet determined, 'I want a
binding contract, and am not keen on love, particularly free love.'</p>

<p>They were both amused. WHY this public avowal? Gerald seemed suspended
a moment, in amusement.</p>

<p>'Love isn't good enough for you?' he called.</p>

<p>'No!' shouted Birkin.</p>

<p>'Ha, well that's being over-refined,' said Gerald, and the car ran
through the mud.</p>

<p>'What's the matter, really?' said Gerald, turning to Gudrun.</p>

<p>This was an assumption of a sort of intimacy that irritated Gudrun
almost like an affront. It seemed to her that Gerald was deliberately
insulting her, and infringing on the decent privacy of them all.</p>

<p>'What is it?' she said, in her high, repellent voice. 'Don't ask me! - I
know nothing about ULTIMATE marriage, I assure you: or even
penultimate.'</p>

<p>'Only the ordinary unwarrantable brand!' replied Gerald. 'Just so - same
here. I am no expert on marriage, and degrees of ultimateness. It seems
to be a bee that buzzes loudly in Rupert's bonnet.'</p>

<p>'Exactly! But that is his trouble, exactly! Instead of wanting a woman
for herself, he wants his IDEAS fulfilled. Which, when it comes to
actual practice, is not good enough.'</p>

<p>'Oh no. Best go slap for what's womanly in woman, like a bull at a
gate.' Then he seemed to glimmer in himself. 'You think love is the
ticket, do you?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Certainly, while it lasts - you only can't insist on permanency,' came
Gudrun's voice, strident above the noise.</p>

<p>'Marriage or no marriage, ultimate or penultimate or just so-so? - take
the love as you find it.'</p>

<p>'As you please, or as you don't please,' she echoed. 'Marriage is a
social arrangement, I take it, and has nothing to do with the question
of love.'</p>

<p>His eyes were flickering on her all the time. She felt as is he were
kissing her freely and malevolently. It made the colour burn in her
cheeks, but her heart was quite firm and unfailing.</p>

<p>'You think Rupert is off his head a bit?' Gerald asked.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed with acknowledgment.</p>

<p>'As regards a woman, yes,' she said, 'I do. There IS such a thing as
two people being in love for the whole of their lives - perhaps. But
marriage is neither here nor there, even then. If they are in love,
well and good. If not - why break eggs about it!'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Gerald. 'That's how it strikes me. But what about Rupert?'</p>

<p>'I can't make out - neither can he nor anybody. He seems to think that
if you marry you can get through marriage into a third heaven, or
something - all very vague.'</p>

<p>'Very! And who wants a third heaven? As a matter of fact, Rupert has a
great yearning to be SAFE - to tie himself to the mast.'</p>

<p>'Yes. It seems to me he's mistaken there too,' said Gudrun. 'I'm sure a
mistress is more likely to be faithful than a wife - just because she is
her OWN mistress. No - he says he believes that a man and wife can go
further than any other two beings - but WHERE, is not explained. They
can know each other, heavenly and hellish, but particularly hellish, so
perfectly that they go beyond heaven and hell - into - there it all
breaks down - into nowhere.'</p>

<p>'Into Paradise, he says,' laughed Gerald.</p>

<p>Gudrun shrugged her shoulders. 'FE M'EN FICHE of your Paradise!' she
said.</p>

<p>'Not being a Mohammedan,' said Gerald. Birkin sat motionless, driving
the car, quite unconscious of what they said. And Gudrun, sitting
immediately behind him, felt a sort of ironic pleasure in thus exposing
him.</p>

<p>'He says,' she added, with a grimace of irony, 'that you can find an
eternal equilibrium in marriage, if you accept the unison, and still
leave yourself separate, don't try to fuse.'</p>

<p>'Doesn't inspire me,' said Gerald.</p>

<p>'That's just it,' said Gudrun.</p>

<p>'I believe in love, in a real ABANDON, if you're capable of it,' said
Gerald.</p>

<p>'So do I,' said she.</p>

<p>'And so does Rupert, too - though he is always shouting.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Gudrun. 'He won't abandon himself to the other person. You
can't be sure of him. That's the trouble I think.'</p>

<p>'Yet he wants marriage! Marriage - ET PUIS?'</p>

<p>'Le paradis!' mocked Gudrun.</p>

<p>Birkin, as he drove, felt a creeping of the spine, as if somebody was
threatening his neck. But he shrugged with indifference. It began to
rain. Here was a change. He stopped the car and got down to put up the
hood.</p>
