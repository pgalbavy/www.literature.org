<p>The three carefully approached the camp-fire, and soon assured
themselves that there was but a single person near it, an old
Indian who sat with closed eyes and nodding head, totally unmindful
of their presence.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is all alone," remarked Howard, in response to the statement
that Tim had made on first seeing the fire. "But he has no gun,
so far as I can see."</p>

<p>"Has he anything to eat?" inquired Elwood. "For that is getting
to be the most important matter."</p>

<p>"There doesn't appear to be any."</p>

<p>"Jist howld still where you baas, till I takes a look around,"
said Tim, with an admonitory wave of the hand.</p>

<p>They obeyed while he went still nearer on tiptoe. When he was
scarcely twenty feet away he paused, and stooping down and bending
his head first to one side and then to the other, and raising
and arching his neck until his longitudinal dimensions became
fearful, he at last satisfied himself that the Indian was alone.</p>

<p>Without moving his feet, Tim now turned his head and motioned
for his companions to join him. They did so very carefully and
silently, and the three men then stood where the light of the
fire shone full in their faces, and where they could not help
being the first objects the Indian would see when he was pleased
to look up.</p>

<p>"We'll have to wake him," whispered Tim, "and shall I yill, or
hit him with a stone on top of the head?"</p>

<p>"Neither; I have heard that the slumber of Indians is very light,
and if you just speak or make a slight noise I have no doubt it
will rouse him."</p>

<p>The fire, which had at its first kindling been large, was now
smouldering as though it had not been touched for several hours.
The Indian was seated on a large stone, his arms hanging listlessly
over his knees, and his head sunk so low that his features could
not be seen. Instead of the defiant scalp-lock drooping from his
crown, his hair was long and luxuriant, and plentifully mixed
with gray. It hung loosely over his shoulders, and in front of
his face, and helped to give him a strange, repulsive appearance.</p>

<p>"I say, owld gintleman, are you draaming, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>As quick as lightning the head of the Indian flashed up, and
his black eyes were centered with a look of alarm upon the individuals
before him. Tim had had some experience with these people when
a miner, and he now began making signs to the savage, who seemed
on the point of springing up and darting away. Naturally enough
the Irishman continued talking, although it was certain that the
one could not understand a word the other uttered.</p>

<p>"We maan no harrum," said the Irishman, raising his hands and
letting them fall at his side, to show that he carried no weapons,
and held good will toward the stranger. The boys judged it best
to imitate their comrade; and after standing a few moments, the
three walked quietly up to the fire. The startled Indian instantly
rose to his feet and placed his hand upon the haft of a large
knife at his waist.</p>

<p>"None of that, ye spalpeen, or I'll smash you to smithereens!"
said Tim, who, although his words were of such dire portent, spoke
as gently as if he were seeking to quiet an infant.</p>

<p>They now noticed that the Indian was very old. His face was scarred
and wrinkled, his body bent, and his limbs tottered as if scarcely
able to bear his weight; but his eye was as keen and defiant as
the eagle's, and he stood ready to defend himself if harm were
offered him.</p>

<p>Tim did the most prudent thing possible. He advanced straight
to the savage and offered his hand. This means of salutation was
understood by the latter, who, after some tottering hesitation,
raised his right hand from the knife and returned the pressure.
Dropping it, he looked toward Elwood and Howard, who saluted him
in the same manner, and the parties were now satisfied regarding
the feelings of each other.</p>

<p>"Ask him for something to eat!" said Elwood; "I am beginning
to feel faint for the want of food."</p>

<p>"What good will the same do? He hasn't anything to give."</p>

<p>"He must live some way himself, and what will support such an
old man as he is, is surely good for us."</p>

<p>The signs that Tim now made were unmistakable in their import.
He opened his huge mouth until the cavern was fearful to contemplate;
then he snapped his teeth together like a dog that has failed
to catch a piece of meat thrown to him; after which he carried
his hand back and forth to his mouth, and opened and shut it again.</p>

<p>The Indian watched these manuevers a moment, and then gave an
exclamation intended solely for his own benefit&mdash;and which, therefore,
it is not necessary to give, if we could, and we can't&mdash;and turning
his back, commenced moving away with the feeble, uncertain gait
of old age.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" inquired Howard.</p>

<p>The savage, seeing they did not follow, paused and looked back.</p>

<p>"That is an invitation," said Tim; "do yees foller."</p>

<p>"But where will he lead us?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell?"</p>

<p>"But it may be into danger," admonished the most cautious Howard.</p>

<p>"It's the only chance we've got to save ourselves from starving,
and for me getting a shmoke out of a pipe, which I am as hungry
for as I am for a few pounds of mate."</p>

<p>The three, the Irishman taking the lead, did not hesitate longer,
but stepped forward, and the Indian immediately resumed his guidance.
The boys could not avoid some alarm and misgiving in thus following
blindly an Indian whom they had not seen until a few minutes before,
and who, they had every reason to believe, was hostile; but there
seemed no other course, and they obeyed the suggestion of Tim
O'Rooney.</p>

<p>The Indian led the way for several hundred yards, when he halted
before one of the rudest and oddest habitations imaginable. It
was made of stones, stumps, limbs, dirt and skins, its dimensions
being about twenty feet in every direction. The savage paused
but a moment when he shoved a large skin aside, entered and held
it open for his friends to do the same. Tim O'Rooney peered cautiously
into the lodge before trusting himself within it, but seeing nothing
alarming, he stepped briskly forward, and was followed by the
two boys and Terror.</p>

<p>A dim fire was burning in one corner, against the face of a rock,
and opposite it lay a bundle of clothes, which, upon being rather
roughly touched by the foot of the Indian, resolved itself into
a being of the feminine gender, unquestionably the partner of
the master of the lodge. A few words were exchanged between the
two, when the squaw busied herself in preparing a meal, while
her husband stirred the fire into a cheerful blaze that brightly
illuminated every portion of the singular dwelling. He seemed
entirely forgetful of the presence of the strangers, who seated
themselves upon a broad flat stone and calmly awaited the result
of his doings.</p>

<p>The old lady speedily appeared with a huge piece of meat, which
was soon roasting on the fire, its savory odor filling the apartment,
and rendering our friends half frantic in their starving condition.
It was quickly cooked; the Indian severed it into four equal portions
with his hunting-knife, and tossed one to each of his visitors,
including the dog, which was really suffering for the want of
nourishment.</p>

<p>As Elwood and Howard ravenously ate the well-cooked, juicy meat,
free from pepper and salt, they were sure they had never tasted
such a delicious morsel in all their life. The pieces were of
a generous size, and after all three had gormandized themselves
until, absolutely, they could contain no more, each had some left.
This, as a matter of course, was thrown to Terror, and by the
time he had swallowed them all, he licked his jaws to show that
his pangs of hunger were also fully satisfied.</p>
