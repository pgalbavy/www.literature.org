<p>Our various departures were unassuming, all but the American’s.
Sandy spent a busy fortnight in his subterranean fashion, now
in the British Museum, now running about the country to see old
exploring companions, now at the War Office, now at the Foreign
Office, but mostly in my flat, sunk in an arm-chair and meditating.
He left finally on December 1st as a King’s Messenger for Cairo.
Once there I knew the King’s Messenger would disappear, and some
queer Oriental ruffian take his place. It would have been impertinence
in me to inquire into his plans. He was the real professional,
and I was only the dabbler.</p>

<p>Blenkiron was a different matter. Sir Walter told me to look
out for squalls, and the twinkle in his eye gave me a notion of
what was coming. The first thing the sportsman did was to write
a letter to the papers signed with his name. There had been a
debate in the House of Commons on foreign policy, and the speech
of some idiot there gave him his cue. He declared that he had
been heart and soul with the British at the start, but that he
was reluctantly compelled to change his views. He said our blockade
of Germany had broken all the laws of God and humanity, and he
reckoned that Britain was now the worst exponent of Prussianism
going. That letter made a fine racket, and the paper that printed
it had a row with the Censor. But that was only the beginning
of Mr Blenkiron’s campaign. He got mixed up with some mountebanks
called the League of Democrats against Aggression, gentlemen who
thought that Germany was all right if we could only keep from
hurting her feelings. He addressed a meeting under their auspices,
which was broken up by the crowd, but not before John S. had got
off his chest a lot of amazing stuff. I wasn’t there, but a man
who was told me that he never heard such clotted nonsense. He
said that Germany was right in wanting the freedom of the seas,
and that America would back her up, and that the British Navy
was a bigger menace to the peace of the world than the Kaiser’s
army. He admitted that he had once thought differently, but he
was an honest man and not afraid to face facts. The oration closed
suddenly, when he got a brussels-sprout in the eye, at which my
friend said he swore in a very unpacifist style.</p>

<p>After that he wrote other letters to the Press, saying that there
was no more liberty of speech in England, and a lot of scallywags
backed him up. Some Americans wanted to tar and feather him, and
he got kicked out of the Savoy. There was an agitation to get
him deported, and questions were asked in Parliament, and the
Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs said his department had the
matter in hand. I was beginning to think that Blenkiron was carrying
his tomfoolery too far, so I went to see Sir Walter, but he told
me to keep my mind easy.</p>

<p>"Our friend’s motto is ‘Thorough’," he said, "and he knows very
well what he is about. We have officially requested him to leave,
and he sails from Newcastle on Monday. He will be shadowed wherever
he goes, and we hope to provoke more outbreaks. He is a very capable
fellow."</p>

<p>The last I saw of him was on the Saturday afternoon when I met
him in St James’s Street and offered to shake hands. He told me
that my uniform was a pollution, and made a speech to a small
crowd about it. They hissed him and he had to get into a taxi.
As he departed there was just the suspicion of a wink in his left
eye. On Monday I read that he had gone off, and the papers observed
that our shores were well quit of him.</p>

<p>I sailed on December 3rd from Liverpool in a boat bound for the
Argentine that was due to put in at Lisbon. I had of course to
get a Foreign Office passport to leave England, but after that
my connection with the Government ceased. All the details of my
journey were carefully thought out. Lisbon would be a good jumping-off
place, for it was the rendezvous of scallywags from most parts
of Africa. My kit was an old Gladstone bag, and my clothes were
the relics of my South African wardrobe. I let my beard grow for
some days before I sailed, and, since it grows fast, I went on
board with the kind of hairy chin you will see on the young Boer.
My name was now Brandt, Cornelis Brandt—at least so my passport
said, and passports never lie.</p>

<p>There were just two other passengers on that beastly boat, and
they never appeared till we were out of the Bay. I was pretty
bad myself, but managed to move about all the time, for the frowst
in my cabin would have sickened a hippo. The old tub took two
days and a night to waddle from Ushant to Finisterre. Then the
weather changed and we came out of snow-squalls into something
very like summer. The hills of Portugal were all blue and yellow
like the Kalahari, and before we made the Tagus I was beginning
to forget I had ever left Rhodesia. There was a Dutchman among
the sailors with whom I used to patter the taal, and but for "Good
morning" and "Good evening" in broken English to the captain,
that was about all the talking I did on the cruise.</p>

<p>We dropped anchor off the quays of Lisbon on a shiny blue morning,
pretty near warm enough to wear flannels. I had now got to be
very wary. I did not leave the ship with the shore-going boat,
but made a leisurely breakfast. Then I strolled on deck, and there,
just casting anchor in the middle of the stream, was another ship
with a blue and white funnel I knew so well. I calculated that
a month before she had been smelling the mangrove swamps of Angola.
Nothing could better answer my purpose. I proposed to board her,
pretending I was looking for a friend, and come on shore from
her, so that anyone in Lisbon who chose to be curious would think
I had landed straight from Portuguese Africa.</p>

<p>I hailed one of the adjacent ruffians, and got into his rowboat,
with my kit. We reached the vessel—they called her the <em>Henry
the Navigator</em>—just as the first shore-boat was leaving. The
crowd in it were all Portuguese, which suited my book.</p>

<p>But when I went up the ladder the first man I met was old Peter
Pienaar.</p>

<p>Here was a piece of sheer monumental luck. Peter had opened his
eyes and his mouth, and had got as far as "Allemachtig", when
I shut him up.</p>

<p>"Brandt," I said, "Cornelis Brandt. That’s my name now, and don’t
you forget it. Who is the captain here? Is it still old Sloggett?"</p>

<p>"<em>Ja,</em>" said Peter, pulling himself together. "He was
speaking about you yesterday."</p>

<p>This was better and better. I sent Peter below to get hold of
Sloggett, and presently I had a few words with that gentleman
in his cabin with the door shut.</p>

<p>"You’ve got to enter my name in the ship’s books. I came aboard
at Mossamedes. And my name’s Cornelis Brandt."</p>

<p>At first Sloggett was for objecting. He said it was a felony.
I told him that I dared say it was, but he had got to do it, for
reasons which I couldn’t give, but which were highly creditable
to all parties. In the end he agreed, and I saw it done. I had
a pull on old Sloggett, for I had known him ever since he owned
a dissolute tug-boat at Delagoa Bay.</p>

<p>Then Peter and I went ashore and swaggered into Lisbon as if
we owned De Beers. We put up at the big hotel opposite the railway
station, and looked and behaved like a pair of lowbred South Africans
home for a spree. It was a fine bright day, so I hired a motor-car
and said I would drive it myself. We asked the name of some beauty-spot
to visit, and were told Cintra and shown the road to it. I wanted
a quiet place to talk, for I had a good deal to say to Peter Pienaar.</p>

<p>I christened that car the Lusitanian Terror, and it was a marvel
that we did not smash ourselves up. There was something immortally
wrong with its steering gear. Half a dozen times we slewed across
the road, inviting destruction. But we got there in the end, and
had luncheon in an hotel opposite the Moorish palace. There we
left the car and wandered up the slopes of a hill, where, sitting
among scrub very like the veld, I told Peter the situation of
affairs.</p>

<p>But first a word must be said about Peter. He was the man that
taught me all I ever knew of veld-craft, and a good deal about
human nature besides. He was out of the Old Colony—Burgersdorp,
I think—but he had come to the Transvaal when the Lydenburg goldfields
started. He was prospector, transport-rider, and hunter in turns,
but principally hunter. In those early days he was none too good
a citizen. He was in Swaziland with Bob Macnab, and you know what
that means. Then he took to working off bogus gold propositions
on Kimberley and Johannesburg magnates, and what he didn’t know
about salting a mine wasn’t knowledge. After that he was in the
Kalahari, where he and Scotty Smith were familiar names. An era
of comparative respectability dawned for him with the Matabele
War, when he did uncommon good scouting and transport work. Cecil
Rhodes wanted to establish him on a stock farm down Salisbury
way, but Peter was an independent devil and would call no man
master. He took to big-game hunting, which was what God intended
him for, for he could track a tsessebe in thick bush, and was
far the finest shot I have seen in my life. He took parties to
the Pungwe flats, and Barotseland, and up to Tanganyika. Then
he made a speciality of the Ngami region, where I once hunted
with him, and he was with me when I went prospecting in Damaraland.</p>

<p>When the Boer War started, Peter, like many of the very great
hunters, took the British side and did most of our intelligence
work in the North Transvaal. Beyers would have hanged him if he
could have caught him, and there was no love lost between Peter
and his own people for many a day. When it was all over and things
had calmed down a bit, he settled in Bulawayo and used to go with
me when I went on trek. At the time when I left Africa two years
before, I had lost sight of him for months, and heard that he
was somewhere on the Congo poaching elephants. He had always a
great idea of making things hum so loud in Angola that the Union
Government would have to step in and annex it. After Rhodes Peter
had the biggest notions south of the Line.</p>

<p>He was a man of about five foot ten, very thin and active, and
as strong as a buffalo. He had pale blue eyes, a face as gentle
as a girl’s, and a soft sleepy voice. From his present appearance
it looked as if he had been living hard lately. His clothes were
of the cut you might expect to get at Lobito Bay, he was as lean
as a rake, deeply browned with the sun, and there was a lot of
grey in his beard. He was fifty-six years old, and used to be
taken for forty. Now he looked about his age.</p>

<p>I first asked him what he had been up to since the war began.
He spat, in the Kaffir way he had, and said he had been having
hell’s time.</p>

<p>"I got hung up on the Kafue," he said. "When I heard from old
Letsitela that the white men were fighting I had a bright idea
that I might get into German South West from the north. You see
I knew that Botha couldn’t long keep out of the war. Well, I got
into German territory all right, and then a <em>skellum</em> of
an officer came along, and commandeered all my mules, and wanted
to commandeer me with them for his fool army. He was a very ugly
man with a yellow face." Peter filled a deep pipe from a kudu-skin
pouch.</p>

<p>"Were you commandeered?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No. I shot him—not so as to kill, but to wound badly. It was
all right, for he fired first on me. Got me too in the left shoulder.
But that was the beginning of bad trouble. I trekked east pretty
fast, and got over the border among the Ovamba. I have made many
journeys, but that was the worst. Four days I went without water,
and six without food. Then by bad luck I fell in with "Nkitla—you
remember, the half-caste chief. He said I owed him money for cattle
which I bought when I came there with Carowab. It was a lie, but
he held to it, and would give me no transport. So I crossed the
Kalahari on my feet. Ugh, it was as slow as a vrouw coming from
<em>nachtmaal</em>. It took weeks and weeks, and when I came to
Lechwe’s kraal, I heard that the fighting was over and that Botha
had conquered the Germans. That, too, was a lie, but it deceived
me, and I went north into Rhodesia, where I learned the truth.
But by then I judged the war had gone too far for me to make any
profit out of it, so I went into Angola to look for German refugees.
By that time I was hating Germans worse than hell."</p>

<p>"But what did you propose to do with them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I had a notion they would make trouble with the Government in
those parts. I don’t specially love the Portugoose, but I’m for
him against the Germans every day. Well, there was trouble, and
I had a merry time for a month or two. But by and by it petered
out, and I thought I had better clear for Europe, for South Africa
was settling down just as the big show was getting really interesting.
So here I am, Cornelis, my old friend. If I shave my beard will
they let me join the Flying Corps?"</p>

<p>I looked at Peter sitting there smoking, as imperturbable as
if he had been growing mealies in Natal all his life and had run
home for a month’s holiday with his people in Peckham.</p>

<p>"You’re coming with me, my lad," I said. "We’re going into Germany."</p>

<p>Peter showed no surprise. "Keep in mind that I don’t like the
Germans," was all he said. "I’m a quiet Christian man, but I’ve
the devil of a temper."</p>

<p>Then I told him the story of our mission. "You and I have got
to be Maritz’s men. We went into Angola, and now we’re trekking
for the Fatherland to get a bit of our own back from the infernal
English. Neither of us knows any German—publicly. We’d better
plan out the fighting we were in—Kakamas will do for one, and
Schuit Drift. You were a Ngamiland hunter before the war. They
won’t have your <em>dossier</em>, so you can tell any lie you
like. I’d better be an educated Afrikander, one of Beyers’s bright
lads, and a pal of old Hertzog. We can let our imagination loose
about that part, but we must stick to the same yarn about the
fighting."</p>

<p>"<em>Ja</em>, Cornelis," said Peter. (He had called me Cornelis
ever since I had told him my new name. He was a wonderful chap
for catching on to any game.) "But after we get into Germany,
what then? There can’t be much difficulty about the beginning.
But once we’re among the beer-swillers I don’t quite see our line.
We’re to find out about something that’s going on in Turkey? When
I was a boy the predikant used to preach about Turkey. I wish
I was better educated and remembered whereabouts in the map it
was."</p>

<p>"You leave that to me," I said; "I’ll explain it all to you before
we get there. We haven’t got much of a spoor, but we’ll cast about,
and with luck will pick it up. I’ve seen you do it often enough
when we hunted kudu on the Kafue."</p>

<p>Peter nodded. "Do we sit still in a German town?" he asked anxiously.
"I shouldn’t like that, Cornelis."</p>

<p>"We move gently eastward to Constantinople," I said.</p>

<p>Peter grinned. "We should cover a lot of new country. You can
reckon on me, friend Cornelis. I’ve always had a hankering to
see Europe."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and stretched his long arms.</p>

<p>"We’d better begin at once. God, I wonder what’s happened to
old Solly Maritz, with his bottle face? Yon was a fine battle
at the drift when I was sitting up to my neck in the Orange praying
that Brits’ lads would take my head for a stone."</p>

<p>Peter was as thorough a mountebank, when he got started, as Blenkiron
himself. All the way back to Lisbon he yarned about Maritz and
his adventures in German South West till I half believed they
were true. He made a very good story of our doings, and by his
constant harping on it I pretty soon got it into my memory. That
was always Peter’s way. He said if you were going to play a part,
you must think yourself into it, convince yourself that you were
it, till you really were it and didn’t act but behaved naturally.
The two men who had started that morning from the hotel door had
been bogus enough, but the two men that returned were genuine
desperadoes itching to get a shot at England.</p>

<p>We spent the evening piling up evidence in our favour. Some kind
of republic had been started in Portugal, and ordinarily the cafes
would have been full of politicians, but the war had quieted all
these local squabbles, and the talk was of nothing but what was
doing in France and Russia. The place we went to was a big, well-lighted
show on a main street, and there were a lot of sharp-eyed fellows
wandering about that I guessed were spies and police agents. I
knew that Britain was the one country that doesn’t bother about
this kind of game, and that it would be safe enough to let ourselves
go.</p>

<p>I talked Portuguese fairly well, and Peter spoke it like a Lourenco
Marques bar-keeper, with a lot of Shangaan words to fill up. He
started on curacao, which I reckoned was a new drink to him, and
presently his tongue ran freely. Several neighbours pricked up
their ears, and soon we had a small crowd round our table.</p>

<p>We talked to each other of Maritz and our doings. It didn’t seem
to be a popular subject in that cafe. One big blue-black fellow
said that Maritz was a dirty swine who would soon be hanged. Peter
quickly caught his knife-wrist with one hand and his throat with
the other, and demanded an apology. He got it. The Lisbon <em>boulevardiers</em>
have not lost any lions.</p>

<p>After that there was a bit of a squash in our corner. Those near
to us were very quiet and polite, but the outer fringe made remarks.
When Peter said that if Portugal, which he admitted he loved,
was going to stick to England she was backing the wrong horse,
there was a murmur of disapproval. One decent-looking old fellow,
who had the air of a ship’s captain, flushed all over his honest
face, and stood up looking straight at Peter. I saw that we had
struck an Englishman, and mentioned it to Peter in Dutch.</p>

<p>Peter played his part perfectly. He suddenly shut up, and, with
furtive looks around him, began to jabber to me in a low voice.
He was the very picture of the old stage conspirator.</p>

<p>The old fellow stood staring at us. "I don’t very well understand
this damned lingo," he said; "but if so be you dirty Dutchmen
are sayin’ anything against England, I’ll ask you to repeat it.
And if so be as you repeats it I’ll take either of you on and
knock the face off him."</p>

<p>He was a chap after my own heart, but I had to keep the game
up. I said in Dutch to Peter that we mustn’t get brawling in a
public house. "Remember the big thing," I said darkly. Peter nodded,
and the old fellow, after staring at us for a bit, spat scornfully,
and walked out.</p>

<p>"The time is coming when the Englander will sing small," I observed
to the crowd. We stood drinks to one or two, and then swaggered
into the street. At the door a hand touched my arm, and, looking
down, I saw a little scrap of a man in a fur coat.</p>

<p>"Will the gentlemen walk a step with me and drink a glass of
beer?" he said in very stiff Dutch.</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"<em>Gott strafe England!</em>" was his answer, and, turning
back the lapel of his coat, he showed some kind of ribbon in his
buttonhole.</p>

<p>"Amen," said Peter. "Lead on, friend. We don’t mind if we do."</p>

<p>He led us to a back street and then up two pairs of stairs to
a very snug little flat. The place was filled with fine red lacquer,
and I guessed that art-dealing was his nominal business. Portugal,
since the republic broke up the convents and sold up the big royalist
grandees, was full of bargains in the lacquer and curio line.</p>

<p>He filled us two long tankards of very good Munich beer.</p>

<p>"<em>Prosit</em>," he said, raising his glass. "You are from
South Africa. What make you in Europe?"</p>

<p>We both looked sullen and secretive.</p>

<p>"That’s our own business," I answered. "You don’t expect to buy
our confidence with a glass of beer."</p>

<p>"So?" he said. "Then I will put it differently. From your speech
in the cafe I judge you do not love the English."</p>

<p>Peter said something about stamping on their grandmothers, a
Kaffir phrase which sounded gruesome in Dutch.</p>

<p>The man laughed. "That is all I want to know. You are on the
German side?"</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," I said. "If they treat me fair I’ll
fight for them, or for anybody else that makes war on England.
England has stolen my country and corrupted my people and made
me an exile. We Afrikanders do not forget. We may be slow but
we win in the end. We two are men worth a great price. Germany
fights England in East Africa. We know the natives as no Englishmen
can ever know them. They are too soft and easy and the Kaffirs
laugh at them. But we can handle the blacks so that they will
fight like devils for fear of us. What is the reward, little man,
for our services? I will tell you. There will be no reward. We
ask none. We fight for hate of England."</p>

<p>Peter grunted a deep approval.</p>

<p>"That is good talk," said our entertainer, and his close-set
eyes flashed. "There is room in Germany for such men as you. Where
are you going now, I beg to know."</p>

<p>"To Holland," I said. "Then maybe we will go to Germany. We are
tired with travel and may rest a bit. This war will last long
and our chance will come."</p>

<p>"But you may miss your market," he said significantly. "A ship
sails tomorrow for Rotterdam. If you take my advice, you will
go with her."</p>

<p>This was what I wanted, for if we stayed in Lisbon some real
soldier of Maritz might drop in any day and blow the gaff.</p>

<p>"I recommend you to sail in the <em>Machado</em>," he repeated.
"There is work for you in Germany—oh yes, much work; but if you
delay the chance may pass. I will arrange your journey. It is
my business to help the allies of my fatherland."</p>

<p>He wrote down our names and an epitome of our doings contributed
by Peter, who required two mugs of beer to help him through. He
was a Bavarian, it seemed, and we drank to the health of Prince
Rupprecht, the same blighter I was trying to do in at Loos. That
was an irony which Peter unfortunately could not appreciate. If
he could he would have enjoyed it.</p>

<p>The little chap saw us back to our hotel, and was with us the
next morning after breakfast, bringing the steamer tickets. We
got on board about two in the afternoon, but on my advice he did
not see us off. I told him that, being British subjects and rebels
at that, we did not want to run any risks on board, assuming a
British cruiser caught us up and searched us. But Peter took twenty
pounds off him for travelling expenses, it being his rule never
to miss an opportunity of spoiling the Egyptians.</p>

<p>As we were dropping down the Tagus we passed the old <em>Henry
the Navigator</em>.</p>

<p>"I met Sloggett in the street this morning," said Peter, "and
he told me a little German man had been off in a boat at daybreak
looking up the passenger list. Yon was a right notion of yours,
Cornelis. I am glad we are going among Germans. They are careful
people whom it is a pleasure to meet."</p>
