<p>Solomon Owl looked so wise that many of his neighbors fell into the habit
of going to him for advice. If two of the forest folk chanced to have a
dispute which they could not settle between them they frequently visited
Solomon and asked him to decide which was in the right. And in the course
of time Solomon became known far and wide for his ability to patch up a
quarrel.
</p>
<p>At last Jimmy Rabbit stopped Solomon Owl one night and suggested that he
hang a sign outside his house, so that there shouldn’t be anybody in the
whole valley that wouldn’t know what to do in case he found himself in an
argument.
</p><p>Solomon decided on the spot that Jimmy Rabbit’s idea was a good one. So he
hurried home and before morning he had his sign made, and put out where
everyone could see it. It looked like this:
</p><p><strong>DISPUTES SETTLED WITHIN</strong>
</p><p>There was only one objection to the sign. As soon as Jimmy Rabbit saw it
he told Solomon that it should have said:
</p><p><strong>DISPUTES SETTLED WITHOUT</strong>
</p><p>“Without what?” Solomon Owl inquired.
</p><p>“Why, without going into your house!” said Jimmy Rabbit. “I can’t climb a
tree, you know. And neither can Tommy Fox. We might have a dispute
to-night; and how could you ever settle it?”
</p><p>“Oh, I shall be willing to step outside,” Solomon told him. And he refused
to change the sign, declaring that he liked it just as it was.
</p><p>Now, there was only one trouble with Solomon Owl’s settling of disputes.
Many of the forest folk wanted to see him in the daytime. And <u>night</u> was
the only time <u>he</u> was willing to see them. But he heard so many
objections to that arrangement that in the end Solomon agreed to meet
people at dusk and at dawn, when it was neither very dark nor very light.
On the whole he found that way very satisfactory, because there was just
enough light at dusk and at dawn to make him blink. And when Solomon
blinked he looked even wiser than ever.
</p><p>Well, the first disputing pair that came to Solomon’s tree after he hung
out his new sign were old Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay. They reached the
hemlock grove soon after sunset and squalled loudly for Solomon. “Hurry!”
Mr. Crow cried, as soon as Solomon Owl stepped outside his door. “It will
be dark before we know it; and it’s almost our bedtime.”
</p><p>“What’s your difficulty?” Solomon asked them.
</p><p>Mr. Crow looked at Jasper Jay. And then he looked at Solomon again.
</p><p>“Maybe you won’t like to hear it,” he said. And he winked at Jasper. “But
you’ve put out this sign—so we’ve come here.”
</p><p>“You’ve done just right!” exclaimed Solomon Owl. “And as for my not liking
to hear the trouble, it’s your dispute and not mine. So I don’t see how it
concerns me—except to settle it.”
</p><p>“Very Well,” Mr. Crow answered. “The dispute, then, is this: Jasper says
that in spite of your looking so wise, you’re really the stupidest person
in Pleasant Valley.”
</p><p>“He does, eh?” cried Solomon Owl, while Jasper Jay laughed loudly. “And
you, of course, do not agree with him,” Solomon continued.
</p><p>“I do not!” Mr. Crow declared.
</p><p>“Good!” said Solomon, nodding his head approvingly.
</p><p>“No, I do not agree with Jasper Jay,” Mr. Crow said. “I claim that there’s
one other person more stupid than you are—and that’s Fatty Coon.”
</p><p>Well, Solomon Owl certainly was displeased. And it didn’t make him feel
any happier to hear Jasper Jay’s boisterous shouts, or the hoarse
“<u>haw-haw</u>” of old Mr. Crow.
</p><p>“I hope you can decide which one of us is right,” Mr. Crow ventured.
</p><p>“I am, of course!” cried Jasper Jay.
</p><p>“You’re not!” Mr. Crow shouted. And to Solomon Owl he said, “We’ve been
disputing like this all day long.”
</p><p>Solomon Owl didn’t know what to say. If he announced that Jasper was right
it would be the same as admitting that he was the stupidest person in the
whole neighborhood. And if he said that old Mr. Crow’s opinion was correct
he would not be much better off. Naturally he didn’t want to tell either
of them that he was right.
</p><p>“I’ll have to think about this,” Solomon observed at last.
</p><p>“We don’t want to wait,” said Mr. Crow. “If we keep on disputing we’re
likely to have a fight.”
</p><p>Now, Solomon Owl hoped that they would have a fight. So he was determined
to keep them waiting for his decision.
</p><p>“Come back to-morrow at this time,” he said.
