<p>In September Athalie Greensleeve wrote her last letter to Clive
Bailey. It began with a page or two of shyly solicitous inquiries
concerning his well-being, his happiness, his plans; did not refer
to his long silence; did refer to his anticipated return; did
not mention her own accumulating domestic and financial embarrassments
and the successive strokes of misfortune dealt her by those twin
and formidable bravos, Fate and Chance; but did mention and enumerate
everything that had occurred in her life which bore the slightest
resemblance to a blessing.</p>

<p>Her letter continued:</p>

<p>   "My sisters Doris and Catharine have gone into vaudeville   
with a very pretty act called 'April Rain.'</p>

<p>   "That they had decided to do this and had been rehearsing
it    came as a complete surprise to me. Genevieve Hunting is
also    in it, and a man named Max Klepper who wrote the piece   
including lyrics and music.</p>

<p>   "They opened at the Old Dominion Theatre, remained there a   
week, and then started West. Which makes it a trifle lonely   
for me; but I don't really mind if they only keep well and   
are successful and happy in their venture. Their idea and    their
desire, of course, is to return to New York at the    earliest
opportunity. But nobody seems to have any idea how    soon that
may happen. Meanwhile the weather is cooler and    Hafiz remains
well and adorable.</p>

<p>   "I have been out very little except to look for a position.   
Mr. Wahlbaum is dead and I left the store. Sunday morning I   
took a few flowers to Mr. Wahlbaum's grave. He was very kind   
to me, Clive. In the afternoon I took a train to the Spring   
Pond Cemetery. Father's and mother's graves had been well    cared
for and were smoothly green. The four young oak trees I    planted
are growing nicely. Mother was fond of trees. I am    sure she
likes my little oaks.</p>

<p>   "It was a beautiful, cool, sunny day; and after I left the   
Cemetery I walked along the well remembered road toward    Spring
Pond. It is not very far, but I had never been any    nearer to
it than the Cemetery since my sisters and I went    away.</p>

<p>   "Such odd sensations came over me as I walked alone there   
amid familiar scenes: and, curiously, everything seemed to   
have shrunk to miniature size&mdash;houses, fields, distances all   
seemed much less impressive. But the Bay was intensely blue;   
the grasses and reeds in the salt meadows were already tipped   
with a golden colour here and there; flocks of purple grackle   
and red-winged blackbirds rose, drifted, and settled,    chattering
and squealing among the cat-tails just as they    used to do when
I was a child; and the big, slow-sailing    mouse-hawks drifted
and glided over the pastures, and when    they tipped sideways
I could see the white moon-spot on their    backs, just as I remembered
to look for it when I was a    little, little girl.</p>

<p>   "And the odours, Clive! How the scent of the August fields,   
of the crisp salt hay, seemed to grip at my heart!&mdash;all the   
subtle, evanescent odours characteristic of that part of Long   
Island seemed to gather, blend, and exhale for my particular   
benefit that afternoon.</p>

<p>   "The old tavern appeared to me so much smaller, so much more   
weather-beaten and shabby than my recollection of it. The    sign
still hung there&mdash;'Hotel Greensleeve'&mdash;and as I walked    by it
I looked up at the window of my mother's room. The    blinds were
closed; nobody appeared to be around. I don't    know why, Clive,
but it seemed to me that I must go in for a    moment and take
one more look at my mother's room.... I am    glad I did. There
was nobody to stop me. I went up the stairs    on tiptoe and opened
her door, and looked in. <em>She was there,    sewing.</em></p>

<p>   "I went in very softly and sat down on the carpet by her   
chair.... It was the happiest moment I have known since she   
died.</p>

<p>   "And when she was no longer there I rose and crept down the   
stairs and through the hallway to the bar; and peeped in. An   
old man sat there asleep by the empty stove. And after a    moment
I decided it was Mr. Ledlie. But he has grown    old&mdash;old!&mdash;and
I let him sleep on in the sunshine without    disturbing him.</p>

<p>   "It was the same stove where you and I sat and nibbled peach   
turnovers so many years ago. I wanted to see it again.</p>

<p>   "So I went back to New York in the late golden afternoon   
feeling very peaceful and dreamy,&mdash;and a trifle tired. And   
found Hafiz stretched on the lounge; and stretched myself out   
beside him, taking the drowsy, purring, spoiled thing into my   
arms. And went to sleep to dream of you who gave me Hafiz, my   
dear and beloved friend.</p>
