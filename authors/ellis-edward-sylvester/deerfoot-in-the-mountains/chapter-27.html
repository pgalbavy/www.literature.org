<p>The remainder of the homeward journey was without special incident.
It was several days before Victor Shelton fully recovered from
the pounding caused by his fall into the torrent. The loss of
his rifle was keenly felt, but he did not fret, for it would have
been ungrateful after his marvelous escape.</p>

<p>Jack Halloway's spirits were irrepressible, and his good nature
was like so much sunshine. The only fault to be found with him
was his inclination to burst into song, without waiting for urging
on the part of his friends. He was gifted with a tremendous voice,
but unfortunately he had no more idea of a tune than a grizzly
bear. But no one could criticize the fellow, who was the life
of the little party.</p>

<p>The course of our friends was southeast, leading through the
present States of Wyoming, Colorado and into Kansas, where they
struck the trail of the year before. This was followed across
Missouri, and, without mishap, all four reached in due time that
old French town on the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Deerfoot and the boys stayed there for one night and a part of
a day. It was a visit which they always remembered. The only fly
in the ointment was the discovery by Jack Halloway that Dick Burley,
after all, had broken his promise. He had not been in St. Louis
twenty-four hours when he sauntered down to French Pete's place.
That worthy met him with a grin, supposing he had come to make
his report, whose nature was not doubted. Then Dick, after denouncing
the fellow as he deserved, proceeded to business in as emphatic
a fashion as Jack had done the preceding year. He was equally
thorough, perhaps more so, for he not only left the place a wreck,
and the proprietor senseless, but "laid out" two brawlers who
happened to be present and were imprudent enough to try to help
the landlord.</p>

<p>"I've one hope," said Jack, in telling of the incident. "Pete
will start up agin and then it'll be <em>my</em> turn to make
a friendly call on him."</p>

<p>In that humble home, on the upper margin of the straggling town
of St. Louis, Jack Halloway introduced George and Victor Shelton
and Deerfoot to his mother. She was a sprightly little lady, who
could not have weighed a hundred pounds, and whose soft, wavy,
white hair and pink cheeks and regular features spoke of the unusual
beauty that was hers when she was the belle of the town. She had
a serene beauty and winsomeness that warmed the hearts of the
callers from the moment they first saw her.</p>

<p>As soon as the introductions and greetings were over, Jack caught
his mother in his arms and tossed her as high as the ceiling would
permit, catching her as she descended and kissing her as if she
were a little child. Then, waving the others to seats, he dropped
into the single rocking chair and held her on his knee during
the conversation that followed. Her soul was wrapped up in this
massive boy with the strength of a giant, and her happiness over
his restoration to her after her years of prayer had a pathos
and sweetness that nothing else in all the world could give.</p>

<p>When the chatter had gone on for a few minutes Jack drew his
mother's face down beside his own and whispered:</p>

<p>"Did you ever see as handsome a chap as that young Indian sitting
over there in the corner? Look how modest he is, as if he didn't
wish to be noticed. Didn't you remember, when I told you his name
is Deerfoot, that he's the chap that made me throw away my flask
of whiskey and was the cause of my becoming a <em>man</em>?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the astonished parent, "I didn't recall it. I must
have a talk with him before he leaves us."</p>

<p>It was arranged after supper that George and Victor should go
to the home of Dick Burley to sleep. Room could have been made
for them in the cabin of Jack Halloway by letting the three rest
on the floor, and he and his mother would have been pleased; but
the brothers showed good taste by accepting the invitation of
Burley, at whose house, for the first time in many months, they
slept in a bed. There was happy content in that home also, for
what loving, devoted wife is not thankful when her husband is
restored to her and is in his right mind?</p>

<p>That humble home where Jack Halloway smoked his pipe, with his
mother knitting beside him and Deerfoot a little way off in his
chair, was the picture of serene, grateful pleasure on the cool
summer night, long ago, when the three sat in converse.</p>

<p>The youth was so drawn to the pure, sweet-faced, motherly lady
that he could not refuse her request to tell her about himself.
He talked more freely than was his wont, and said many things
he would not have said in the presence of others. She penetrated
the nobility of the youth, who could read and write well, whose
mind was stored with considerable knowledge, whose woodcraft approached
as near perfection as mortal man can attain, and whose strength,
skill and prowess (as she gathered from incidents brought out
in the course of the evening) were the superior of any person's
whom she had ever seen. In addition, as she said to her son the
next day, anyone would be tempted to talk to Deerfoot, because
it was such a pleasure to look upon the handsome countenance and
to make him smile and show his beautiful teeth.</p>

<p>So it was that Deerfoot was compelled to tell the whole story
of his encounter with Taggarak, with its remarkable sequel; of
his fight with the grizzly bear, and his conquest of Whirlwind,
the peerless stallion. He never would have done this but for the
persistent questioning of Mrs. Halloway. The boys had told Jack
enough on the long ride from the mountains to St. Louis for him
to give his mother the necessary pointers, and he helped her in
driving the Shawanoe into a corner, where he could not otherwise
extricate himself.</p>

<p>The wonderful thing in the estimation of the good woman was that
the hero of these and many other exploits was a <em>Christian</em>.
She had never seen one of his race who professed to be a follower
of the Meek and Lowly One, though she had heard of such from the
missionaries; but she agreed with her son that no more perfect
exemplar of Christianity was to be found anywhere.</p>

<p>On the morrow, when the time came to part, Mrs. Halloway took
the hand of Deerfoot in her dainty palm, and in a trembling voice
thanked him for what he had done for her through what he did for
her son. She promised to pray for him every day of her remaining
life, and while he stood trying to keep back the tears she added:</p>

<p>"Please bend your head a little."</p>

<p>He bent down and she touched her lips to his forehead, and, still
holding the hand, said so that all, Jack, the Shelton boys and
Dick Burley, could hear, as they gathered round to say the parting
words:</p>

<p>"Well done, good and faithful servant!"</p>

<p>The benison thus bestowed remained with Deerfoot all the way
home and to the end of his life. In the cool depths of the forest,
amid the fragrance of brown leaves, the bark of trees and of bursting
bud and blossom, and by the flow of the crystal brook, he heard
the gentle whisper. It came to him when the snow sifted against
his frame and the bite of the Arctic blast was as merciless as
the fangs of the she-wolf. Above the crash of the hurricane that
uprooted and splintered the century-old monarchs of the woods
the words rang out like the notes of an angel's trumpet, and in
the watches of the night, under the star-gleam or in the fleecy
moonlight, while stillness brooded over a sleeping world, the
music swung back and forth like a censer through the corridors
of the soul, with a sweetness that told him the strings of the
harp throbbed under the touch of the fingers of God himself.</p>
