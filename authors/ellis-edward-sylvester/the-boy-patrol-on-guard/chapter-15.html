<p>Uncle Elk declined the invitation of Scout Master Hall to stay
over night at the bungalow, and bidding his friends good bye,
with the promise soon to see them again, he went forth staff in
hand into the dim woods on his tramp to his lonely home to the
eastward.</p>

<p>It cannot be said of any portion of our country that it enjoys
a perfect climate, though some sections are highly favored in
that respect. Maine is an ideal summer resort, with its crystal
waters, its cool breezes and its pure air. When people were panting
with intolerable heat in many cities, I have never known an uncomfortable
night or oppressive midday in the southern part of the Pine Tree
State.</p>

<p>All the same, the weather at times on the seacoast is about as
disagreeable as it can well be. Drizzling rain and mists, dank,
impenetrable fogs and chilling winds make a roaring fire attractive,
and cause many a person to long for his city home, where every
convenience and luxury are at command. I make no reference to
the winter season, except to say that there is no better State
in the Union to avoid unless you have a fondness for arctic exploration.</p>

<p>The morning succeeding Uncle Elk’s last call brought lowering
skies. The chill in the air presaged an unwelcome change, when
the bungalow would prove far more inviting than the open woods,
even though the Boy Scouts were provided with tents and all the
protection possible against climatic severity. Since, however,
the dismal shift was not likely to come for several hours, our
young friends determined to make the best use possible of the
hours at their command. So, as they had done before, they separated
into small groups, most of which took different directions in
the woods. Scout Master Hall went with Chase his leader and Robe
his corporal on a hunt for birds, or rather to study their peculiarities.
Nearly all the scouts were amateur ornithologists, and there was
no little rivalry among them as to who could discover the greater
variety of feathered songsters.</p>

<p>I am sure you will agree with me that this field is one of the
most fascinating in natural history. I should like to copy the
report which Patrol Leader Chase and three of the other boys read
at the following business meeting of the troop, but I think we
have dipped far enough into scientific matters for the present,
and shall defer the treat to another season. If you feel like
making an effort to learn about our "little brothers of the air,"
I commend the following table from the official Handbook of the
Boy Scouts:</p>

<p>Alvin Landon, Chester Haynes and Mike Murphy decided to borrow
one of the canoes belonging to the clubhouse, paddle across the
lake and call upon Doctor Spellman, who had dropped into the home
of Uncle Elk the day before. The weather was favorable for fishing,
the game being abundant in Gosling Lake, but such sport could
wait, and the lads agreed that nothing ought to divert them from
their social obligations.</p>

<p>The three had gained more or less experience in the management
of canoes during their stay on Southport Island. Alvin was the
most and Mike the least expert, though the latter was not as awkward
as would be supposed. Two paddles belonged to each craft, the
third being taken from the second boat, so that all the youths
were provided. These implements were about four feet long and
were broadened at one end into a thin but tough blade and at the
other into a comfortable hand grip. Seated on the wicker seats
and facing forward, the task of driving the canoe may be continued
a long while before it becomes tiresome.</p>

<p>An axiom is that no person should ever enter a canoe when it
is not afloat, on account of its frailty. Grasping the curving
bow with one hand, Alvin drew the craft alongside the bank where
the water was several feet deep, and held it steady while his
friends stepped carefully in and seated themselves, Alvin at the
stern, which was a counterpart of the bow, while Chester located
himself on the forward seat and Mike in the middle.</p>

<p>"I’m to sarve as a balance wheel," he said as they moved gingerly
out from shore; "the same being what me mither’s cousin Tom remarked
whin he was bouncing over the cobble stones with his fut fast
in the stirrup of the donkey he had fell from; I’ll hev an eye
on both of ye and don’t forgit I’m still first mate."</p>

<p>"You were first mate of the <em>Deerfoot</em>, not of a canoe,"
said Alvin.</p>

<p>"The <em>Deerfut</em> gave me the training fur the harder work
of managing this ship."</p>

<p>Our friends would have had to search for the camp which they
intended to visit, but for the guidance given by a thin wavering
column of smoke which filtered upwards from among the trees a
short distance back from the shore of the lake, where the camp
itself was hidden by the foliage. The distance to be passed was
a little less than a mile and the youths rippled smoothly forward
with their eyes fixed on their destination. As they drew near,
they observed a smaller canoe than their own drawn a little way
up the shingle. It was the craft used by Doctor Spellman when
fishing or exploring the sheet of water. Since the owner was not
in sight, it was fair to suppose he was at home unless perhaps
he was absent on an excursion in the woods.</p>

<p>In due time the canoe was driven alongside the other and drawn
far enough up the shore to be secure against drifting away. The
three stepped ashore, and followed a faintly worn path up the
slight incline among the trees and undergrowth with Alvin in the
lead. Less than a hundred yards took them to a pleasant scene,
all of whose points they learned a short time afterward.</p>

<p>It may be said that Doctor Spellman used the last thing in the
way of an improved dwelling in the wilderness. This was a portable
house, and consisted of two rooms, the side walls formed of screen
cloth protected inside when necessary by canvas drops, pierced
with small windows of a flexible transparent material. Outside
were canvas drops which could be lowered if the occupants wished
to shut up the house and which when raised formed projecting awnings
where one was well protected by the shade thus provided. There
were two windows at either end of the house and a front door.</p>

<p>Should you ever indulge in a few weeks’ outing in the woods,
take no furniture with you that will not fold and no article that
is not indispensable. Folding cots, a table, and the same kind
of camp chairs can be packed in a small space and cost little
to move. The doctor had sets of three folding canvas shelves fastened
to wooden slats which could be stowed in a few inches of space,
water proof canvas buckets holding three gallons each which folded
compactly; waterproof canvas folding basins and folding rubber
bathtubs, while a packing box with the addition of a shelf made
a fine dresser. Extra shelves were put up by the doctor when he
laid the floor of his dwelling and hooked the different parts
together. Finally he provided himself with a hammock which was
hung between two sturdy saplings, and brought with him only unbreakable
dishes.</p>

<p>Most people in such situations bring a cheap wood or oil stove,
but Doctor Spellman used the primitive contrivance already described,
which consisted of big properly arranged stones.</p>

<p>On one of the camp chairs sat Doctor Spellman smoking one of
the expensive cigars to which Uncle Elk had alluded. He wore white
flannels turned up at the bottom, high tan shoes and a soft Panama
hat. The boys noticed his full, grizzled beard and recalled the
declaration of their Instructor concerning his age. He had a newspaper
which he was reading when he heard the approaching footsteps,
but laid it on his knee and removing his eye-glasses faced his
callers.</p>

<p>Nearby sat Mrs. Spellman, a charming and strikingly beautiful
woman of a decided brunette type. Her dark eyes were set in a
face of Grecian regularity of feature, softened by her olive skin
and crowned by dusky hair filled with lights and shadows. She
was clad in sensible woods costume of blouse and short skirt which
revealed her small feet encased in hunting boots.</p>

<p>The moment the boys appeared, the host and hostess rose to greet
them. Each lad removed his hat and respectfully bowed, Alvin acting
as spokesman:</p>

<p>"Good morning; I hope we are not intruding."</p>

<p>"Visitors are too few in this part of the world," replied the
doctor, "for them to be otherwise than welcome. I am Doctor Spellman
from Boston; this is Mrs. Spellman; we have a third member of
our family, but she seems to be invisible at this moment. Pray
be seated."</p>

<p>Of course the boys declined the chairs offered since it would
leave the host and hostess without any support of that nature.
The callers sat down on a log, in the butt was an axe of which
the blade had been buried with the handle sloping upward.</p>

<p>Alvin in turn introduced himself and companions and all were
at ease.</p>

<p>"You are with the party stopping at the clubhouse on the other
side of the lake? I judge from the display of flags and a glimpse
of you through my binoculars that you are a troop of Boy Scouts
on a vacation."</p>

<p>"Yes; we expect to stay there through the month of August."</p>

<p>"Since you came last it was my duty to call upon you and I should
have done so to-day had not the weather been threatening a little
while ago."</p>

<p>"We can afford to waive ceremony while in the woods," replied
Alvin; "we shall count upon seeing you both quite often."</p>

<p>"You certainly shall. To-morrow is Sunday, and if it clears up
you may expect me and possibly Mrs. Spellman and our little one."</p>

<p>In answer to the inquiring look of her husband the wife nodded.</p>

<p>"Don’t fancy that you can do your visiting without taking me
along. You left me home yesterday."</p>

<p>"That, my dear, was unintentional; I had no thought of stopping
at the cabin of the hermit until I had been out some time in the
canoe and noticed the path leading to his cabin."</p>

<p>Alvin related the particulars of the call of himself and friends
upon Uncle Elk and the clever manner in which he penetrated the
personality of Doctor Spellman.</p>

<p>"Are you acquainted with him?" asked Chester Haynes of their
host.</p>

<p>"Only by reputation. He is known as Elkanah Sisum, though I have
a suspicion—perhaps not well founded—that that is not his right
name. I have been told that he is a man of superior culture. In
fact, a glance at his book shelves proves that. It is said that
a great sorrow drove him into the wilderness and made an exile
of him. I have no knowledge of its nature, but of course," added
the doctor with a wink, "some woman was at the bottom of it."</p>

<p>"An unnecessary remark," replied the wife, "since that is rarely
true."</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester glanced significantly at each other and the
former said:</p>

<p>"Isn’t it singular that he should have told us last night the
story of a man who more than a hundred years ago became an exile
and wanderer because the woman whom he loved rejected him for
another? There must have been a resemblance between the case and
his own."</p>

<p>"You are alluding to Johnny Appleseed, and it is another coincidence
that wife and I were talking about that strange character last
evening, probably at the very time you were listening to the old
man’s account. I believe there was a remote relationship between
wife’s ancestors and Jonathan Chapman’s, which explains why we
are familiar with a story that is not generally known."</p>

<p>"It was certainly new to all of us and Uncle Elk, as he likes
to be called, related it with rare skill."</p>

<p>"He has never hinted anything of the facts of his own case?"</p>

<p>"No, and of course we cannot question him."</p>

<p>"The truth will become known sooner or later. There are several
old persons in Portland who can clear up the mystery, which, however,
may wait. While I think of it, I wish to tender you my professional
services should they be needed, which I sincerely hope they will
not. I have brought my case of instruments and a few simple remedies
with me, more as a matter of prudence regarding my own family."</p>

<p>"That is very kind of you, and your offer is appreciated."</p>

<p>"I believe the Boy Scouts are pretty well instructed as to first
aid to the injured, but accidents are always liable to happen.
I wish you and your friends to feel free to call upon me at any
time, with the understanding that no fee is involved. I did not
come into the Maine woods to earn a living."</p>

<p>"But to benefit his city patients," remarked his wife; "when
we return home we shall find them nearly all recovered."</p>

<p>"Hardly possible, since I have turned them over to my brother
practitioners."</p>

<p>"Which makes the probability the greater."</p>

<p>The boys joined in the laugh at the physician’s expense, and
he, rising from his camp stool, bowed profoundly to his better
half.</p>

<p>"The team which brought our stuff over the new road through the
woods is the same that I understand brings your supplies. I expected
from the way we were hauled and flung about in the plunging of
the horses that I should have several cases of broken necks to
look after, but we got through better than I expected."</p>

<p>"Docther, don’t ye think <em>I</em> look pale?" </p>
