A WOLF, sorely wounded and bitten by dogs, lay sick and maimed in
his lair.  Being in want of food, he called to a Sheep who was
passing, and asked him to fetch some water from a stream flowing
close beside him.  "For," he said, "if you will bring me drink, I
will find means to provide myself with meat."  "Yes," said the
Sheep, "if I should bring you the draught, you would doubtless
make me provide the meat also."  
 
Hypocritical speeches are easily seen through.
