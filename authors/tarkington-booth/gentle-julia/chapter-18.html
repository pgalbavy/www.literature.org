<p>They went satirically down the street, their chumminess with
one another bountifully increased by their common derision of
the outsider on the porch; and even at a distance they still contrived
to make themselves intolerable; looking back over their shoulders,
at intervals, with say-not-so expressions on their faces. Even
when these faces were far enough away to be but yellowish oval
planes, their say-not-so expressions were still bitingly eloquent.</p>

<p>Now a northern breeze chilled the air, as the hateful three became
indistinguishable in the haze of autumn dusk, whereupon Florence
stopped swinging her foot, left the railing, and went morosely
into the house. And here it was her fortune to make two discoveries
vital to her present career; the first arising out of a conversation
between her father and mother in the library, where a gossipy
fire of soft coal encouraged this proper Sunday afternoon entertainment
for man and wife.</p>

<p>"Sit down and rest, Florence," said her mother. "I'm afraid you
play too hard when Patty and the boys are here. Do sit down quietly
and rest yourself a little while." And as Florence obeyed, Mrs.
Atwater turned to her husband, resuming: "Well, that's what <em>I</em>
said. I told Aunt Carrie I thought the same way about it that
<em>you</em> did. Of course nobody <em>ever</em> knows what Julia's
going to do next, and nobody needs to be surprised at anything
she does do. Ever since she came home from school, about four-fifths
of all the young men in town have been wild about her&mdash;and so's
every old bachelor, for the matter of that!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Mr. Atwater added. "And every old widower, too."</p>

<p>His wife warmly accepted the amendment. "And every old widower,
too," she said, nodding. "Rather! And of course Julia's just done
exactly as she pleased about everything, and naturally she's going
to do as she pleases about <em>this</em>."</p>

<p>"Well, of course it's her own affair, Mollie," Mr. Atwater said
mildly. "She couldn't be expected to consult the whole Atwater
family connection before she&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she agreed. "I don't say she could. Still, it <em>is</em>
rather upsetting, coming so suddenly like this, when not one of
the family has ever seen him&mdash;never even heard his very name before."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>"'Well, men ... I don't want to see any loafin'
around here, men. I expect I'll have a pretty good newspaper this
week.'"</em>]</p>

<p>"Well, that part of it isn't especially strange, Mollie. He was
born and brought up in a town three hundred miles from here. I
don't see just how we <em>could</em> have heard his name unless
he visited here or got into the papers in some way."</p>

<p>Mrs. Atwater seemed unwilling to yield a mysterious point. She
rocked decorously in her rocking-chair, shook her head, and after
setting her lips rigidly, opened them to insist that she could
never change her mind: Julia had acted very abruptly. "Why couldn't
she have let her poor father know at least a <em>few</em> days
before she did?"</p>

<p>Mr. Atwater sighed. "Why, she explains in her letter that she
only knew it, herself, an hour before she wrote."</p>

<p>"Her poor father!" his wife repeated commiseratingly.</p>

<p>"Why, Mollie, I don't see how father's especially to be pitied."</p>

<p>"Don't you?" said Mrs. Atwater. "That old man, to have to live
in that big house all alone, except a few negro servants?"</p>

<p>"Why, no! About half the houses in the neighbourhood, up and
down the street, are fully occupied by close relatives of his:
I doubt if he'll be really as lonely as he'd like to be. And he's
often said he'd give a great deal if Julia had been a plain, unpopular
girl. I'm strongly of the opinion, myself, that he'll be pleased
about this. Of course it may upset him a little at first."</p>

<p>"Yes; I think it will!" Mrs. Atwater shook her head forebodingly.
"And he isn't the only one it's going to upset."</p>

<p>"No, he isn't," her husband admitted seriously. "That's always
been the trouble with Julia; she never could bear to seem disappointing;
and so, of course, I suppose every one of 'em has a special idea
that he's really about the top of the list with her."</p>

<p>"Every last one of 'em is positive of it," said Mrs. Atwater.
"That was Julia's way with 'em!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Julia's always been much too kind-hearted for other people's
good." Thus Mr. Atwater summed up Julia; and he was her brother.
Additionally, since he was the older, he had known her since her
birth.</p>

<p>"If you ask <em>me</em>," said his wife, "I'll really be surprised
if it all goes through without a suicide."</p>

<p>"Oh, not quite suicide, perhaps," Mr. Atwater protested. "I'm
glad it's a fairly dry town though."</p>

<p>She failed to fathom his simple meaning. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, some of 'em might feel <em>that</em> desperate at least,"
he explained. "Prohibition's a safeguard for the disappointed
in love."</p>

<p>This phrase and a previous one stirred Florence, who had been
sitting quietly, according to request, and "resting", but not
resting her curiosity. "<em>Who's</em> disappointed in love, papa?"
she inquired with an explosive eagerness that slightly startled
her preoccupied parents. "What <em>is</em> all this about Aunt
Julia, and grandpa goin' to live alone, and people committing
suicide and prohibition and everything? What <em>is</em> all this,
mamma?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Florence."</p>

<p>"Nothing! That's what you always say about the very most inter'sting
things that happen in the whole family! What <em>is</em> all this,
papa?"</p>

<p>"It's nothing that would be interesting to little girls, Florence.
Merely some family matters."</p>

<p>"My goodness!" Florence exclaimed. "I'm not a 'little girl' any
more, papa! You're <em>always</em> forgetting my age! And if it's
a family matter I belong to the family, I guess, about as much
as anybody else, don't I? Grandpa himself isn't any <em>more</em>
one of the family than I am, I don't care <em>how</em> old he
is!"</p>

<p>This was undeniable, and her father laughed. "It's really nothing
you'd care about one way or the other," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd care about it if it's a secret," Florence insisted.
"If it's a secret I'd want to know it, whatever it's about."</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't a secret, particularly, I suppose. At least, it's
not to be made public for a time; it's only to be known in the
family."</p>

<p>"Well, didn't I just <em>prove</em> I'm as much one o' the family
as&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," her father said soothingly. "I don't suppose there's
any harm in your knowing it&mdash;if you won't go telling everybody.
Your Aunt Julia has just written us that she's engaged."</p>

<p>Mrs. Atwater uttered an exclamation, but she was too late to
check him.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you oughtn't to have told Florence. She <em>isn't</em>
just the most discreet&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" he laughed. "She certainly is 'one of the family', however,
and Julia wrote that all of the family might be told. You'll not
speak of it outside the family, will you, Florence?"</p>

<p>But Florence was not yet able to speak of it, even inside the
family; so surprising, sometimes, are parents' theories of what
will not interest their children. She sat staring, her mouth open,
and in the uncertain illumination of the room these symptoms of
her emotional condition went unobserved.</p>

<p>"I say, you won't speak of Julia's engagement outside the family,
will you, Florence?"</p>

<p>"Papa!" she gasped. "Did Aunt Julia write she was <em>engaged</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"To get <em>married</em>?"</p>

<p>"It would seem so."</p>

<p>"To <em>who</em>?"</p>

<p>"'To whom,' Florence," her mother suggested primly.</p>

<p>"Mamma!" the daughter cried. "Who's Aunt Julia engaged to get
married to? Noble Dill?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious, <em>no</em>!" Mrs. Atwater exclaimed. "What an
absurd idea! It's to a young man in the place she's visiting&mdash;a
stranger to all of us. Julia only met him a few weeks ago." Here
she forgot Florence, and turned again to her husband, wearing
her former expression of experienced foreboding.</p>

<p>"It's just as I said. It's exactly like Julia to do such a reckless
thing!"</p>

<p>"But as we don't know anything at all about the young man," he
remonstrated, "how do you know it's reckless?"</p>

<p>"How do you know he's young?" Mrs. Atwater retorted crisply.
"All in the world she said about him was that he's a lawyer. He
may be a widower, for all we know, or divorced, with seven or
eight children."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mollie!"</p>

<p>"Why, he <em>might</em>!" she insisted. "For all we know, he
may be a widower for the third or fourth <em>time</em>, or divorced,
with any <em>number</em> of children! If such a person proposed
to Julia, you know yourself she'd hate to be disappointing!"</p>

<p>Her husband laughed. "I don't think she'd go so far as to actually
accept 'such a person' and write home to announce her engagement
to the family. I suppose most of her swains here have been in
the habit of proposing to her just as frequently as she was unable
to prevent them from going that far; and while I don't think she's
been as discouraging with them as she might have been, she's never
really accepted any of 'em. She's never been engaged before."</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. Atwater admitted. "Not to this extent! She's never
quite announced it to the family before, that is."</p>

<p>"Yes; I'd hate to have Julia's job when she comes back!" Julia's
brother admitted ruefully.</p>

<p>"What job?"</p>

<p>"Breaking it to her admirers."</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>she</em> isn't going to do that!"</p>

<p>"She'll have to, now," he said. "She'll either have to write
the news to 'em, or else tell 'em, face to face, when she comes
home."</p>

<p>"She won't do either."</p>

<p>"Why, how could she get out of it?"</p>

<p>His wife smiled pityingly. "She hasn't set a time for coming
home, has she? Don't you know enough of Julia's ways to see she'll
never in the world stand up to the music? She writes that all
the family can be told, because she knows the news will leak out,
here and there, in confidence, little by little, so by the time
she gets home they'll all have been through their first spasms,
and after that she hopes they'll just send her some forgiving
flowers and greet her with manly hand-clasps&mdash;and get ready to
usher at the wedding!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Atwater, "I'm afraid you're right. It does seem
rather like Julia to stay away till the first of the worst is
over. I'm really sorry for some of 'em. I suppose it <em>will</em>
get whispered about, and they'll hear it; and there are some of
the poor things that might take it pretty hard."</p>

<p>"'Take it pretty hard!'" his wife echoed loudly. "There's <em>one</em>
of 'em, at least, who'll just merely lose his reason!"</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"Noble Dill."</p>

<p>At this, the slender form of Florence underwent a spasmodic seizure
in her chair, but as the fit was short and also noiseless, it
passed without being noticed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Atwater thoughtfully. "I suppose he will."</p>

<p>"He certainly will!" Mrs. Atwater declared. "Noble's mother told
me last week that he'd got so he was just as liable to drop a
fountain-pen in his coffee as a lump of sugar; and when any one
speaks to him he either doesn't know it, or else jumps. When he
says anything, himself, she says they can scarcely ever make out
what he's talking about. He was trying enough before Julia went
away; but since she's been gone Mrs. Dill says he's like nothing
in her experience. She says he doesn't inherit it; Mr. Dill wasn't
anything like this about her."</p>

<p>Mr. Atwater smiled faintly. "Mrs. Dill wasn't anything like Julia."</p>

<p>"No," said his wife. "She was quite a sensible girl. I'd hate
to be in her place now, though, when she tells Noble about <em>this</em>."</p>

<p>"How can Mrs. Dill tell him, since she doesn't know it herself?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;perhaps she ought to know it, so that she <em>could</em>
tell him. <em>Somebody</em> ought to tell him, and it ought to
be done with the greatest tact. It ought to be broken to him with
the most delicate care and sympathy, or the consequences&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Nobody could foretell the consequences," her husband interrupted:&mdash;"no
matter how tactfully it's broken to Noble."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I suppose that's true. I think the poor thing's
likely to lose his reason unless it <em>is</em> done tactfully,
though."</p>

<p>"Do you think we really ought to tell Mrs. Dill, Mollie? I mean,
seriously: Do you?"</p>

<p>For some moments she considered his question, then replied, "No.
It's possible we'd be following a Christian course in doing it;
but still we're rather bound not to speak of it outside the family,
and when it does get outside the family I think we'd better not
be the ones responsible&mdash;especially since it might easily be traced
to us. I think it's usually better to keep out of things when
there's any doubt."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, meditating. "I never knew any harm to come of
people's sticking to their own affairs."</p>

<p>But as he and his wife became silent for a time, musing in the
firelight, their daughter's special convictions were far from
coinciding with theirs, although she, likewise, was silent&mdash;a
singularity they should have observed. So far were they from a
true comprehension of her, they were unaware that she had more
than a casual, young-cousinly interest in Julia Atwater's engagement
and in those possible consequences to Noble Dill just sketched
with some intentional exaggeration. They did not even notice her
expression when Mr. Atwater snapped on the light, in order to
read; and she went quietly out of the library and up the stairs
to her own room.</p>

<p>On the floor, near her bed, where Patty Fairchild had left her
coat and hat, Florence made another discovery. Two small, folded
slips of paper lay there, dropped by Miss Fairchild when she put
on her coat in the darkening room. They were the replies to Patty's
whispered questions in the game on the steps&mdash;the pledged Truth,
written by Henry Rooter and Herbert Atwater on their sacred words
and honours. The infatuated pair had either overestimated Patty's
caution, or else each had thought she would so prize his little
missive that she would treasure it in a tender safety, perhaps
pinned upon her blouse (at the first opportunity) over her heart.
It is positively safe to say that neither of the two veracities
would ever have been set upon paper had Herbert and Henry any
foreshadowing that Patty might be careless; and the partners would
have been seized with the utmost horror could they have conceived
the possibility of their trustful messages ever falling into the
hands of the relentless creature who now, without an instant's
honourable hesitation, unfolded and read them.</p>

<p>"<em>Yes if I got to tell the truth I know I have got pretty
eyes</em>," Herbert had unfortunately written. "I <em>am glad
you think so too Patty because your eyes are too Herbert Illingsworth
Atwater, Jr.</em>"</p>

<p>And Mr. Henry Rooter had likewise ruined himself in a coincidental
manner:</p>

<p>"<em>Well Patty my eyes are pretty but suppose I would like to
trade with yours because you have beautiful eyes also, sure as
my name is Henry Rooter.</em>"</p>

<p>Florence stood close to the pink-shaded electric drop-light over
her small white dressing-table, reading again and again these
pathetically honest little confidences. Her eyelids were withdrawn
to an unprecedented retirement, so remarkably she stared; while
her mouth seemed to prepare itself for the attempted reception
of a bulk beyond its capacity. And these plastic tokens, so immoderate
as to be ordinarily the consequence of nothing short of horror,
were overlaid by others, subtler and more gleaming, which wrought
the true significance of the contortion&mdash;a joy that was dumfounding.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were first of Fortune's kindness in selecting her
for a favour so miraculously dovetailing into the precise need
of her life; then she considered Henry and Herbert, each at this
hour probably brushing his hair in preparation for the Sunday
evening meal, and both touchingly unconscious of the calamity
now befalling them; but what eventually engrossed her mind was
a thought about Wallie Torbin.</p>

<p>This Master Torbin, fourteen years of age, was in all the town
the boy most dreaded by his fellow-boys, and also by girls, including
many of both sexes who knew him only by sight&mdash;and hearing. He
had no physical endowment or attainment worth mention; but boys
who could "whip him with one hand" became sycophants in his presence;
the terror he inspired was moral. He had a special over-development
of a faculty exercised clumsily enough by most human beings, especially
in their youth; in other words, he had a genius&mdash;not, however,
a genius having to do with anything generally recognized as art
or science. True, if he had been a violinist prodigy or mathematical
prodigy, he would have had some respect from his fellows&mdash;about
equal to that he might have received if he were gifted with some
pleasant deformity, such as six toes on a foot&mdash;but he would never
have enjoyed such deadly prestige as had actually come to be his.
In brief, then, Wallie Torbin had a genius for mockery.</p>

<p>Almost from his babyhood he had been a child of one purpose:
to increase by burlesques the sufferings of unfortunate friends.
If one of them wept, Wallie incessantly pursued him, yelping in
horrid mimicry; if one were chastised he could not appear out-of-doors
for days except to encounter Wallie and a complete rehearsal of
the recent agony. "Quit, Papa! <em>Pah</em>-puh, quee-yet! I'll
<em>never</em> do it again, Pah-puh! Oh, <em>lemme</em> alone,
Pah-<em>puh</em>!"</p>

<p>As he grew older, his insatiate curiosity enabled him to expose
unnumbered weaknesses, indiscretions, and social misfortunes on
the part of acquaintances and schoolmates; and to every exposure
his noise and energy gave a hideous publicity: the more his victim
sought privacy the more persistently he was followed by Wallie,
vociferous and attended by hilarious spectators. But above all
other things, what most stimulated the demoniac boy to prodigies
of satire was a tender episode or any symptom connected with the
dawn of love. Florence herself had suffered at intervals throughout
her eleventh summer because Wallie discovered that Georgie Beck
had sent her a valentine; and the humorist's many, many squealings
of that valentine's affectionate quatrain finally left her unable
to decide which she hated the more, Wallie or Georgie. That was
the worst of Wallie: he never "let up"; and in Florence's circle
there was no more sobering threat than, "I'll tell Wallie Torbin!"
As for Henry Rooter and Herbert Illingsworth Atwater, Jr., they
would as soon have had a Head-hunter on their trail as Wallie
Torbin in the possession of anything that could incriminate them
in an implication of love&mdash;or an acknowledgment (in their own
handwriting!) of their own beauty.</p>

<p>The fabric of civilized life is interwoven with blackmail: even
some of the noblest people do favours for other people who are
depended upon not to tell somebody something that the noblest
people have done. Blackmail is born into us all, and our nurses
teach us more blackmail by threatening to tell our parents if
we won't do this and that&mdash;and our parents threaten to tell the
doctor&mdash;and so we learn! Blackmail is part of the daily life of
a child. Displeased, his first resort to get his way with other
children is a threat to "tell," but by-and-by his experience discovers
the mutual benefit of honour among blackmailers. Therefore, at
eight it is no longer the ticket to threaten to tell the teacher;
and, a little later, threatening to tell any adult at all is considered
something of a breakdown in morals. Notoriously, the code is more
liable to infraction by people of the physically weaker sex, for
the very reason, of course, that their inferiority of muscle so
frequently compels such a sin, if they are to have their way.
But for Florence there was now no such temptation. Looking to
the demolition of Atwater &amp; Rooter, an exposure before adults
of the results of "Truth" would have been an effect of the sickliest
pallor compared to what might be accomplished by a careful use
of the catastrophic Wallie Torbin.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening it was her privileged custom to go to the house
of fat old Great-Uncle Joseph and remain until nine o'clock, in
chatty companionship with Uncle Joseph and Aunt Carrie, his wife,
and a few other relatives (including Herbert) who were in the
habit of dropping in there, on Sunday evenings. In summer, lemonade
and cake were frequently provided; in the autumn, one still found
cake, and perhaps a pitcher of clear new cider: apples were a
certainty.</p>

<p>This evening was glorious: there were apples and cider and cake,
with walnuts, perfectly cracked, and a large open-hearted box
of candy; for Uncle Joseph and Aunt Carrie had foreseen the coming
of several more Atwaters than usual, to talk over the new affairs
of their beautiful relative, Julia. Seldom have any relative's
new affairs been more thoroughly talked over than were Julia's
that evening; though all the time by means of symbols, since it
was thought wiser that Herbert and Florence should not yet be
told of Julia's engagement; and Florence's parents were not present
to confess their indiscretion. Julia was referred to as "the traveller";
other makeshifts were employed with the most knowing caution,
and all the while Florence merely ate inscrutably. The more sincere
Herbert was placid; the foods absorbing his attention.</p>

<p>"Well, all I say is, the traveller better enjoy herself on her
travels," said Aunt Fanny, finally, as the subject appeared to
be wearing toward exhaustion. "She certainly is in for it when
the voyaging is over and she arrives in the port she sailed from,
and has to show her papers. I agree with the rest of you: she'll
have a great deal to answer for, and most of all about the shortest
one. My own opinion is that the shortest one is going to burst
like a balloon."</p>

<p>"The shortest one," as the demure Florence had understood from
the first, was none other than her Very Ideal. Now she looked
up from the stool where she sat with her back against a pilaster
of the mantelpiece. "Uncle Joseph," she said;&mdash;"I was just thinking.
What is a person's reason?"</p>

<p>The fat gentleman, rosy with firelight and cider, finished his
fifth glass before responding. "Well, there <em>are</em> persons
I never could find any reason for at all. 'A person's reason'?
What do you mean, 'a person's reason,' Florence?"</p>

<p>"I mean: like when somebody says, 'They'll lose their reason,'"
she explained. "Has everybody got a reason, and if they have,
what is it, and how do they lose it, and what would they do then?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I see!" he said. "You needn't worry. I suppose since you
heard it you've been hunting all over yourself for your reason
and looking to see if there was one hanging out of anybody else,
somewhere. No; it's something you can't see, ordinarily, Florence.
Losing your reason is just another way of saying, 'going crazy'!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" she murmured, and appeared to be disturbed.</p>

<p>At this, Herbert thought proper to offer a witticism for the
pleasure of the company.</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> know, Florence," he said, "it only means acting
like <em>you</em> most always do." He applauded himself with a
burst of changing laughter ranging from a bullfrog croak to a
collapsing soprano; then he added: "Espeshually when you come
around my and Henry's Newspaper Building! You cert'nly 'lose your
reason' every time you come around <em>that</em> ole place!"</p>

<p>"Well, course I haf to act like the people that's already there,"
Florence retorted, not sharply, but in a musing tone that should
have warned him. It was not her wont to use a quiet voice for
repartee. Thinking her humble, he laughed the more raucously.</p>

<p>"Oh, Florence!" he besought her. "Say not so! Say not so!"</p>

<p>"Children, children!" Uncle Joseph remonstrated.</p>

<p>Herbert changed his tone; he became seriously plaintive. "Well,
she does act that way, Uncle Joseph! When she comes around there
you'd think we were runnin' a lunatic asylum, the way she takes
on. She hollers and bellers and squalls and squawks. The least
little teeny thing she don't like about the way we run our paper,
she comes flappin' over there and goes to screechin' around you
could hear her out at the Poor House Farm!"</p>

<p>"Now, now, Herbert," his Aunt Fanny interposed. "Poor little
Florence isn't saying anything impolite to you&mdash;not right now,
at any rate. Why don't you be a little sweet to her just for once?"</p>

<p>Her unfortunate expression revolted all the manliness in Herbert's
bosom. "Be a little <em>sweet</em> to her?" he echoed with poignant
incredulity, and then in candour made plain how poorly Aunt Fanny
inspired him. "I just exackly as soon be a little sweet to an
alligator," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" said Aunt Carrie.</p>

<p>"I would!" Herbert insisted. "Or a mosquito. I'd rather, to <em>either</em>
of 'em, 'cause anyway they don't make so much noise. Why, you
just ought to <em>hear</em> her," he went on, growing more and
more severe. "You ought to just come around our Newspaper Building
any afternoon you please, after school, when Henry and I are tryin'
to do our work in anyway <em>some</em> peace. Why, she just squawks
and squalls and squ&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It must be terrible," Uncle Joseph interrupted. "What do you
do all that for, Florence, every afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Just for exercise," she answered dreamily; and her placidity
the more exasperated her journalist cousin.</p>

<p>"She does it because she thinks <em>she</em> ought to be runnin'
our own newspaper, my and Henry's; that's why she does it! She
thinks she knows more about how to run newspapers than anybody
alive; but there's one thing she's goin' to find out; and that
is, she don't get anything <em>more</em> to do with my and Henry's
newspaper. We wouldn't have another single one of her ole poems
in it, no matter how much she offered to pay us! Uncle Joseph,
I think you ought to <em>tell</em> her she's got no business around
my and Henry's Newspaper Building."</p>

<p>"But, Herbert," Aunt Fanny suggested;&mdash;"you might let Florence
have a little share in it of some sort. Then everything would
be all right."</p>

<p>"It would?" he said. "It <em>woo</em>-wud? Oh, my goodness, Aunt
Fanny, I guess you'd like to see our newspaper just utterably
ruined! Why, we wouldn't let that girl have any more to do with
it than we would some horse!"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" both Aunt Fanny and Aunt Carrie exclaimed, shocked.</p>

<p>"We wouldn't," Herbert insisted. "A horse would know any amount
more how to run a newspaper than she does. Soon as we got our
printing-press, we said right then that we made up our minds Florence
Atwater wasn't ever goin' to have a single thing to do with our
newspaper. If you let her have anything to do with anything she
wants to run the whole thing. But she might just as well learn
to stay away from our Newspaper Building, because after we got
her out yesterday we fixed a way so's she'll never get in <em>there</em>
again!"</p>

<p>Florence looked at him demurely. "Are you sure, Herbert?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"Just you try it!" he advised her, and he laughed tauntingly.
"Just come around to-morrow and try it; that's all I ask!"</p>

<p>"I cert'nly intend to," she responded with dignity. "I may have
a slight supprise for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>Florence</em>, say not so! Say not so, Florence! Say
not so!"</p>

<p>At this, she looked full upon him, and already she had something
in the nature of a surprise for him; for so powerful was the still
balefulness of her glance that he was slightly startled. "I might
say not so," she said. "I might, if I was speaking of what pretty
eyes you say yourself you know you have, Herbert."</p>

<p>It staggered him. "What&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin'," she replied airily.</p>

<p>Herbert began to be mistrustful of the solid earth: somewhere
there was a fearful threat to his equipoise. "What you talkin'
about?" he said with an effort to speak scornfully; but his sensitive
voice almost failed him.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin'," said Florence. "Just about what pretty eyes you
know you have, and Patty's being pretty, too, and so you're glad
she thinks yours are pretty, the way <em>you</em> do&mdash;and everything!"</p>

<p>Herbert visibly gulped. He believed that Patty had betrayed him;
had betrayed the sworn confidence of "Truth!"</p>

<p>"That's all I was talkin' about," Florence added. "Just about
how you knew you had such pretty eyes. Say not so, Herbert! Say
not so!"</p>

<p>"Look here!" he said. "When'd you see Patty again between this
afternoon and when you came over here?"</p>

<p>"What makes you think I saw her?"</p>

<p>"Did you telephone her?"</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>Once more Herbert gulped. "Well, I guess you're ready to believe
anything anybody tells you," he said, with palsied bravado. "You
don't believe everything Patty Fairchild says, do you?"</p>

<p>"Why, Herbert! Doesn't she always tell the <em>truth</em>?"</p>

<p>"Her? Why, half the time," poor Herbert babbled, "you can't tell
whether she's just makin' up what she says or not. If you've gone
and believed everything that ole girl told you, you haven't got
even what little sense I used to think you had!" So base we are
under strain, sometimes&mdash;so base when our good name is threatened
with the truth of us! "I wouldn't believe anything she said,"
he added, in a sickish voice, "if she told me fifty times and
crossed her heart!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you if she said you <em>wrote down</em> how pretty
you knew your eyes were, Herbert? Wouldn't you if it was on paper
in your own handwriting?"</p>

<p>"What's this about Herbert having 'pretty eyes'?" Uncle Joe inquired,
again bringing general attention to the young cousins; and Herbert
shuddered. This fat uncle had an unpleasant reputation as a joker.</p>

<p>The nephew desperately fell back upon the hopeless device of
attempting to drown out his opponent's voice as she began to reply.
He became vociferous with scornful laughter, badly cracked. "Florence
got mad!" he shouted, mingling the purported information with
hoots and cacklings. "She got mad because I and Henry played some
games with Patty and wouldn't let her play! She's tryin' to make
up stories on us to get even. She made it up! It's all made up!
She&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, no," Mr. Atwater interrupted. "Let Florence tell us. Florence,
what was it about Herbert's knowing he had 'pretty eyes'?"</p>

<p>Herbert attempted to continue the drowning out. He bawled. "She
made it <em>up</em>! It's somep'n she made up her_self_! She&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Herbert," said Uncle Joseph;&mdash;"if you don't keep quiet, I'll
take back the printing-press."</p>

<p>Herbert substituted a gulp for the continuation of his noise.</p>

<p>"Now, Florence," said Uncle Joseph, "tell us what you were saying
about how Herbert knows he has such 'pretty eyes'."</p>

<p>Then it seemed to Herbert that a miracle befell. Florence looked
up, smiling modestly. "Oh, it wasn't anything, Uncle Joseph,"
she said. "I was Just trying to tease Herbert any way I could
think of."</p>

<p>"Oh, was that all?" A hopeful light faded out of Uncle Joseph's
large and inexpressive face. "I thought perhaps you'd detected
him in some indiscretion."</p>

<p>Florence laughed, "I was just teasin' him. It wasn't anything,
Uncle Joseph."</p>

<p>Hereupon, Herbert resumed a confused breathing. Dazed, he remained
uneasy, profoundly so: and gratitude was no part of his emotion.
He well understood that in conflicts such as these Florence was
never susceptible to impulses of compassion; in fact, if there
was warfare between them, experience had taught him to be wariest
when she seemed kindest. He moved away from her, and went into
another room where his condition was one of increasing mental
discomfort, though he looked over the pictures in his great-uncle's
copy of "Paradise Lost." These illustrations, by M. Gustave Doré,
failed to aid in reassuring his troubled mind.</p>

<p>When Florence left the house, he impulsively accompanied her,
maintaining a nervous silence as they walked the short distance
between Uncle Joseph's front gate and her own. There, however,
he spoke.</p>

<p>"Look here! You don't haf to go and believe everything that ole
girl told you, do you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Florence heartily. "I don't haf to."</p>

<p>"Well, look here," he urged, helpless but to repeat. "You don't
haf to believe whatever it was she went and told you, do you?"</p>

<p>"What was it you think she told me, Herbert?"</p>

<p>"All that guff&mdash;you know. Well, whatever it was you <em>said</em>
she told you."</p>

<p>"I didn't," said Florence. "I didn't say she told me anything
at all."</p>

<p>"Well, she did, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," Florence replied, lightly. "She didn't say anything
to <em>me</em>. Only I'm glad to have your <em>opinion</em> of
her, how she's such a story-teller and all&mdash;if I ever want to
tell her, and everything!"</p>

<p>But Herbert had greater alarms than this, and the greater obscured
the lesser. "Look here," he said, "if she didn't tell you, how'd
you know it then?"</p>

<p>"How'd I know what?"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that big story about my ever writin' I knew I had"&mdash;he
gulped again&mdash;"pretty eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh, about <em>that</em>!" Florence said, and swung the gate
shut between them. "Well, I guess it's too late to tell you to-night,
Herbert; but maybe if you and that nasty little Henry Rooter do
every single thing I tell you to, and do it just <em>exackly</em>
like I tell you from this time on, why maybe &mdash;I only say
'maybe'&mdash;well, maybe I'll tell you some day when I feel like it."</p>

<p>She ran up the path and up the veranda steps, but paused before
opening the front door, and called back to the waiting Herbert:</p>

<p>"The only person I'd ever <em>think</em> of tellin' about it
before I tell you would be a boy I know." She coughed, and added
as by an afterthought, "He'd just love to know all about it; I
know he would. So, when I tell anybody about it I'll only tell
just you and this other boy."</p>

<p>"What other boy?" Herbert demanded.</p>

<p>And her reply, thrilling through the darkness, left him demoralized
with horror.</p>

<p>"Wallie Torbin!"</p>
