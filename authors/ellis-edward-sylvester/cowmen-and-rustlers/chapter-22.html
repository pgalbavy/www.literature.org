<p>It seemed strange that the messenger, if such he was, should
know the right course to follow in order to reach the camp of
Capt. Asbury, for he was riding directly toward it, and that,
too, at the highest speed of which his horse was capable.</p>

<p>But Monteith Sterry had noted a fact which escaped the captain,
though he was an observant man. The horseman was not approaching
the camp at the moment the couple reached the crest of the elevation
and began scrutinizing the surrounding country; he was going at
right angles to it, but (as it afterward proved) he carried a
glass, with which, at that moment, he was also scanning the horizon
for something he was very anxious to find.</p>

<p>Fortunately he caught sight of the couple, and though he could
not be assured of their identity at so great a distance, the suspicion
of the truth as to Capt. Asbury caused him to put his animal to
his best speed.</p>

<p>In a brief time he rode up. While some rods away he recognized
the captain and saluted him. A little nearer approach and he identified
Sterry, who was astonished beyond measure to discover that he
was his old friend, Dick Hawkridge, toward whose ranch he had
ridden on the preceding evening.</p>

<p>"You're out early, Dick," was the salutation of Sterry, as his
old friend reined up beside him and extended his hand.</p>

<p>"And are riding hard," added Capt. Asbury, who liked the young
man.</p>

<p>"I ride hard," replied Hawkridge, gravely, "because there is
need of it; I was looking for you."</p>

<p>"And why looking for me?" inquired the captain.</p>

<p>"Because you and your men are in great peril."</p>

<p>"Ah. What might be its nature?"</p>

<p>"From the rustlers."</p>

<p>"I was trying to persuade myself that it was they who were in
peril from us, but you put it differently."</p>

<p>"It might be as you wish if you had twenty-five or fifty men;
but with less than a dozen, and more than twice that number looking
for you, discretion is the better part of valor."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Hawkridge, how all this interesting information came
to you," continued Capt. Asbury.</p>

<p>"My ranch is not far to the northward, my cattle are ranging
among the foothills of the Big Horn Mountains, and all my hands
are with them. I sat up late last night, going over my accounts
and trying to get them into shape, and it was past midnight when
two rustlers rode up. I supposed they meant to stay all night
and invited them in. I have never had any trouble with them, and
they had two purposes in calling. One was to give me a little
advice, and the other to secure information."</p>

<p>"Their advice, I suppose, was that you cast in your fortunes
with them, and take up the business of branding mavericks and
altering other brands."</p>

<p>"Hardly that, but it was that I should keep out of the trouble,
for there are going to be ugly times. Now you know that, however
much I may wish to let things proceed smoothly, I will never identify
myself with the law-breakers. I gave my callers to understand
that, and I think they respect my position.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," added Hawkridge, thoughtfully, "that there
have been some woeful mistakes made. The Cattle Association have
organized an expedition to rid Johnson, Natroma and Converse Counties
of cattle-thieves, as they call them. They have imported twenty-five
picked men from Texas, every one of whom is a fighter and dead
shot, with Capt. Smith, an ex-<em>U.S. </em>marshal, as their
leader. One of the party may be taken as a type of the rest. He
is Scott Davis, once a guard on the Deadwood coach, and he carries
a gun with twenty notches on the stock, each representing the
death of a road-agent or other outlaw.</p>

<p>"The expedition left Cheyenne some days ago and is somewhere
in this section. Strong as it is, it is doomed to defeat, for
I don't care how brave and skilful those fellows are, they are
no more so than the rustlers, who far outnumber them.</p>

<p>"However, it isn't that which concerns you and me just now, though
it may do so later. The rustlers have learned that you are out
with a small party, and they are after you."</p>

<p>Capt. Asbury was a brave man, and he did not start on hearing
this announcement, for he had been expecting it from the first;
but he was prudent as well as daring, and he knew his young friend
did not underestimate the danger of himself and companions.</p>

<p>"Have they learned anything about last night's doings?" asked
Sterry.</p>

<p>"That's what started me off after you in such a hurry. My callers
stayed more than two hours, and were about leaving when who should
ride up but Duke Vesey, with his story of the killing of his comrade,
Jack Perkins, by you and your men."</p>

<p>"I suppose he called it a murder," remarked Capt. Asbury, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Yes, the worst kind, too. I knew he was drawing a long bow,
but he will tell it to others, and it will spread like wildfire.
He was looking for Ira Inman, Larch Cadmus and his party. There
are more of them than you and others are aware of, riding up and
down the country, ripe for any mischief. From what I know, Inman
and a dozen of the most desperate rustlers are in the neighborhood,
and as the two fellows who were at my ranch volunteered to help
Vesey find them they will do it pretty soon, if they have not
already done so. Vesey declared it as his belief that you would
be discovered not far from his burned home, so as soon as they
left I mounted my best horse and started to give you warning."</p>

<p>"I appreciate your kindness, Hawkridge; how did you know the
right direction?"</p>

<p>"I knew the course to Vesey's ranch, and was speeding that way
when I caught sight of you and Sterry on the top of this hill.
I took a squint through my glass, was pretty sure who it was,
and then came like mad. I didn't suspect it was you though, Mont,
until I almost ran against you."</p>

<p>"Did Vesey say anything about me?" asked Sterry, with a meaning
glance at the captain.</p>

<p>"He said you had acted like a white man in some dispute, but
he didn't give the particulars and I didn't question him. He is
intensely bitter against the captain and his party, and declares
that not one of them shall get out of the country alive; and,
captain, Duke Vesey is a man of his word."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose I may consider myself disposed of," replied Asbury,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Not as bad as that, but it depends upon yourself."</p>

<p>"What do you advise?"</p>

<p>"Start southward at once with your men; if you meet the Texans
and their friends, join them if you choose; it will make their
strength so much the greater, and they need it all. If you fail
to meet them, keep on till you cross the Platte and strike Fort
Fetterman. In other words, captain, you have no business to be
where you are."</p>
