<p>I do not know how it is that I shall find words in which to write down
the loveliness of that Gouverneur of Old Harpeth. He was not as tall
as my Uncle, the General Robert, and he was slender and lithe as some
wild thing in a forest, but the power in the broadness of his
shoulders and in the strength of his nervous hands was of a greatness
of which to be frightened; that is, I think, of which a man should be
frightened but in which a woman would take much glory. His hair was of
the tarnished gold of a sunset storm and upon his temples was a curved
crest of white that sparkled like the spray of a wave. All of which I
must have seen with some kind of inward eyes, for from the moment my
eyes lifted themselves from contemplating the carpet in embarrassment
over my tweed trousers they were looking into his in a way which at
dawn my eyes have gazed into the morning star rising near to me over
the little wood at the Chateau de Grez. I did not for many days know
whether those eyes were gray or blue or purple, for when I regarded
them I forgot to decide, and also they were so deep and shadowed by
the blackness of their lashes and brows that such a decision was
difficult. At this time I only knew that in them lay the fire of the
lightning over Old Harpeth when the storm breaks, the laugh of the
very small boy who splashes bare feet in the water with glee, and also
a coldness of the stars upon the frost of winter. I was glad that I
came across the dark ocean to flee from the cruel guns into a strange
land to look into those eyes.
</p><p>"It is good that you have come, Robert Carruthers, for the General and
I both need you," were the words I heard him saying to me in a voice
that was as deep and of as much interest as the eyes, and as he spoke
those words he took one of my hands in both of his strong ones. "And
if you say snails, snails it shall be, if Cato and I have to invade
every rose garden in Hayesville and vicinity and stay up all night to
catch them."
</p><p>"I think I shall choose that corn pone and whiskey that my Uncle, the
General Robert, has promised to me from one bad tempered cook at the
time of my luncheon," I found myself saying with a laugh that answered
the bare-footed boy who suddenly looked at me out of the cool eyes.
</p><p>"I thought I would let him have a try-out with Kizzie before we
decided what to feed the savages," also said my Uncle, the General
Robert, with a laugh. "Besides, he's one himself and I'll have to go
slow and tame him gradually."
</p><p>"No, he's ours. He's just come back to his own from a strange land,
General, and you'll kill the fatted calf or rooster, whichever Kizzie
decides, with joy at getting him." And this time the star eyes gave to
me the quick sympathy for which I had prayed before the Virgin with
the Infant in her arms in the little chapel of the old convent just
before we had to flee from the shells, leaving my father to the
Sisters to bury after the enemy had come. I think my eyes did tell
that tale to his and the tears ached in my throat.
</p><p>"I know, boy," he said softly and then turned and presented me to the
Mr. Clendenning who was arranging papers at a desk beside the window.
</p><p>I do like with my whole heart that funny Buzz Clendenning, who has the
reddest hair, the largest brown speckles on his face and the widest
mouth that I have ever beheld. Also, his laugh is even wider than is
his mouth and overflows the remainder of his face in ripples of what
is called grin. He is not much taller than am I, but of much more
powerful build, as is natural, though he did not at that moment
recognize the reason thereof.
</p><p>"Shake hands, boys; don't stand looking at each other like young
puppies," said my Uncle, the General Robert, as he clapped his hand on
the back of the Mr. Buzz Clendenning. "You don't have to fight it out.
Your fathers licked each other week about for twenty years."
</p><p>"Can't I even ask him to take off his coat once, General?" answered
that Mr. Buzz with the grin all over his face and spreading to my
countenance as he took my hand in his to administer one of those
shakes of which I had had so many since my arrival in America. For a
second he looked startled and glanced down at my white hand that he
held in his and from it to my eyes that were looking into his with the
entire friendliness of my heart. Suddenly I had a great fright of
discovery within me and my knees began to again tremble together for
their skirts, but before that fright had reached my eyes quite, I had
born to me an elder brother in the person of that Buzz Clendenning,
and I now know that I can never lose him, even when he knows that--
</p><p>"I'm no shakes in the duel, Prince, so let's kiss and make up before
you get out your sword," he said as he also, as my Uncle, the General
Robert, had done, laid an arm across my shoulders in an embrace of
affection. It was then I made a discovery in the strange land into
which I was penetrating: Men have much sentiment in their hearts that
it is impossible for a woman to discover from behind a fan. They keep
it entirely for each other as comrades, and I received a large portion
of such an affection when that Mr. Buzz Clendenning adopted me in what
he thought was my foreign weakness, as a small brother to be protected
in his large heart.
</p><p>"I am very happy to so salute you instead of the duel," I made answer
and did immediately put a kiss on his one cheek, expecting that he
would return it upon my cheeks, first one and then another, as is the
custom of comrades and officers in France.
</p><p>"Here, help! Don't do that again or I'll call out the police,"
responded that funny Mr. Buzz Clendenning, as he shook me away from
him, while my Uncle, the General Robert, and the great Gouverneur did
both indulge in laughter.
</p><p>"I am abashed and I beg your pardon for offending against the customs
of your country. I do remember now that my father did not permit such
a salutation from his brother officers, and I will not do so again,
Monsieur Buzz Clendenning," I said as my cheeks became crimson with
mortification and tears would have come over my eyes had my pride
permitted.
</p><p>"This is what he meant you to do, Buzz, you duffer. I said good-bye to
twenty-two of my friends this way the day I set sail from old
Heidelberg," and as he spoke, that great and beautiful and exalted
Gouverneur Faulkner did bend his head to mine and give to me the
correct comrade salute of my own country on first one of my cheeks and
then upon the other.
</p><p>"I thank you, your Excellency," I murmured with gratitude. I wonder
what that Russian Count Estzkerwitch or Mr. Peter Scudder or Lord
Leigholm on those Scotch moors, would have thought to hear Roberta,
Marquise of Grez and Bye, express such gratitude for two small pecks
upon her cheek delivered in America.
</p><p>"Yes, sir, it's mighty pretty to look at but I reckon the kid had
better stow the habit before he is introduced to Jeff Whitworth and
Miles Menefee and the rest of the bunch," said that Mr. Buzz as he
left off wiping from his cheek with the back of his hand the kiss I
had put there, and administered to me another embrace on my shoulders
with his long arm. "Besides, youngster, there are <u>girls</u> in
Hayesville," he added with a grin that again was reflected on my face
without my will and which did entirely take away my anger and
embarrassment at his repulse.
</p><p>"Girls! Girls!" exploded my Uncle, the General Robert. "The female
young generally known as girls are about as much use to humanity as a
bunch of pin feathers tied with a pink ribbon would be in the place of
the household feather duster that the Lord lets them grow into after
they reach their years of discretion. Robert has no time to waste with
the unfledged. Don't even suggest it to him, Clendenning. And now you
can take him around to my house and tell Kizzie to begin filling you
both up while I wait for a moment to go over these papers with the
Governor. And both of you avoid the female young, for we've work for
you; mind you, work and no gallivanting. Now go! Depart!"
</p><p>"The old boy is a forty-two centimeter gun that fires at the mention
of the lovely sex and doesn't stop until the ammunition gives out,"
said Mr. Buzz Clendenning as he slid into the seat of his slim gray
racer beside me and started from the curb on high without a single
kick of the engine. "I'd like to wish a nice girl, whom he couldn't
shake off, onto him for about a week and watch him squirm along to
surrender. Wait until you see Sue Tomlinson get hold of him down on
the street some day. He shuts his eyes and just fires away at her
while she purrs at him, and it is a sight for the gods. Sue's father
died and left her with her invalid mother and not enough money to
invite in the auctioneer, but the General took some old accounts of
the Doctor's, collected and invested them and made up plenty of money
for Sue's grubstake, though he goes around three blocks to get past
her. Sue adores him and approaches him from all sides, but has never
made a landing yet. Say, you'll like Sue. She is pretty enough to eat,
but don't try to bite. It's no use."
</p><p>"Is it that this lovely Mademoiselle Sue does not like gentlemen save
my Uncle, the General Robert?" I asked with great interest. I was glad
in my heart that I was soon to see and speak with a nice girl even if
it had to be in character of a man.
</p><p>"Oh, she loves us--all," answered that Mr. Buzz with the greatest
gloom. "<u>All</u> of us--every blamed son-of-a-gun of us."
</p><p>"Oh, I comprehend now that it is your wish that she love only you, Mr.
Clendenning, and are sad that she does not," I said as I looked at him
with much sympathy.
</p><p>"That is about it, Prince, but don't say I said so. Everybody chases
Susan. She even wins an occasional ice cream smile from His
Excellency. I bet she'd go up against that august iceberg itself in a
try-out for a 'First Lady of the State' badge if Mrs. Pat Whitworth
hadn't got the whole woman bunch to believe she has a corner on his
ice. Mrs. Pat is some little cornerer, believe me."
</p><p>"Oh, I did like that Madam Whitworth, and I hope that it will be my
pleasure to see her again soon," I said with an ice in my voice as I
caught my breath while Mr. Buzz Clendenning drove between two cars and
a wagon with not so much as an inch to spare on all three sides of the
car. It is as I like to drive when at the wheel, but sitting beside
another--
</p><p>"You'll see her at the Governor's dinner for you Tuesday, if not
sooner, and just watch her and the General war dance with each other.
He opens his eyes when Mrs. Pat attacks and he imagines he is the
whole Harpeth Valley Militia defending His Excellency of Iceland from
her wiles. Just watch him!" And this time it was three wagons that we
slid between and beyond.
</p><p>"Why is it that the great Gouverneur Faulkner has such a coldness for
ladies?" I asked of that Mr. Buzz. "I did find him to be of such a
beautiful kindness."
</p><p>"He's been too much chased. He's got his fingers crossed on them, they
tell me. Just watch him in action at his dinner. He side-steps so
gently that they never know it."
</p><p>"Why is it then that he gives to me this dinner of honor when he so
dislikes all--that is, I mean to ask of you why is it that I am so
honored by that very great Gouverneur Faulkner of the State of
Harpeth?" I asked, and I had a great fright that I had again so nearly
betrayed Robert Carruthers to be one of the sex so hated by that noble
gentleman, the Gouverneur Faulkner. "I must think of myself as a man
in future," I commanded myself.
</p><p>"Didn't the General tell you about it? It is to introduce you to the
flower and chivalry of your native land. Believe me, it will be some
dinner dance. The General wanted it to be a stag, but Sue fought to
the last trench, which was tears, and he gave in. These days the
Governor loses no chance to honor his Secretary of State for--for
political reasons," and as he spoke that good Mr. Clendenning looked
at the wheel for steering, and I could see that there was deep concern
in his eyes.
</p><p>"Is it that--that trouble of mules, Monsieur Clendenning?" I asked of
him softly in a woman's way for administering sympathy for distress
but without the masculine discretion that I was to learn swiftly
thereafter to employ.
</p><p>"Don't talk about it, for I don't know how much either of us knows or
our chief wants us to know, but Governor Williamson Faulkner is a man
of honor and I'd stake my life on that. He's being pushed hard
and--Gee! Here we are at the General's and I can smell Kizzie's cream
gravy with my mind's nose. I understand that your father was the last
Henry Carruthers of five born up in the old mahogany bedstead that the
General inhabits between the hours of one and five A.M. Some shack,
this of the General's, isn't it? Nothing finer in the State." And as
he spoke that Mr. Buzz Clendenning stopped the car before the home of
my Uncle, the General Robert, and we alighted from it together.
</p><p>I do not know how it is that I can put into words the beautiful
feeling that rose from the inwardness of me as I stood in front of the
home of my fathers in this far-away America. The entire city of
Hayesville is a city of old homes, I had noticed as I drove in the
gray car so rapidly along with Mr. Buzz Clendenning while he was
speaking to me, but no house had been so beautiful as was this one. It
was old, with almost the vine-covered age of the Chateau de Grez, but
instead of being of gray stone it was of a red brick that was as warm
as the embers of an oak fire with the film of ashes crusting upon it.
Thus it seemed to be both red and gray beneath the vines that were
casting delicate green traceries over its walls. Great white pillars
were to the front of it like at the Mansion of the Gouverneur, and
many wide windows and doors opened out from it. Two old oak trees
which give to it the name of Twin Oaks stood at each side of the old
brick walk that led from the tall gate, and as I walked under them I
felt that I had from a cruel world come home.
