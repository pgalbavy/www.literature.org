<p>There are few moments in life to compare with a traveller's first
sight of a new land which is destined to be for short or long
his home. When, after a fair and speedy voyage, we passed Point
Comfort, and had rid ourselves of the revenue men, and the tides
bore us up the estuary of a noble river, I stood on deck and drank
in the heady foreign scents with a boyish ecstasy. Presently we
had opened the capital city, which seemed to me no more than a
village set amid gardens, and Mr. Lambie had come aboard and greeted
me. He conveyed me to the best ordinary in the town which stood
over against the Court-house. Late in the afternoon, just before
the dark fell, I walked out to drink my fill of the place.</p>

<p>You are to remember that I was a country lad who had never set
foot forth of Scotland. I was very young, and hot on the quest
of new sights and doings. As I walked down the unpaven street
and through the narrow tobacco-grown lanes, the strange smell
of it all intoxicated me like wine.</p>

<p>There was a great red sunset burning over the blue river and
kindling the far forests till they glowed like jewels. The frogs
were croaking among the reeds, and the wild duck squattered in
the dusk. I passed an Indian, the first I had seen, with cock's
feathers on his head, and a curiously tattooed chest, moving as
light as a sleep-walker. One or two townsfolk took the air, smoking
their long pipes, and down by the water a negro girl was singing
a wild melody. The whole place was like a mad, sweet-scented dream
to one just come from the unfeatured ocean, and with a memory
only of grim Scots cities and dour Scots hills. I felt as if I
had come into a large and generous land, and I thanked God that
I was but twenty-three.</p>

<p>But as I was mooning along there came a sudden interruption on
my dreams. I was beyond the houses, in a path which ran among
tobacco-sheds and little gardens, with the river lapping a stone's-throw
off. Down a side alley I caught a glimpse of a figure that seemed
familiar.</p>

<p>'Twas that of a tall, hulking man, moving quickly among the tobacco
plants, with something stealthy in his air. The broad, bowed shoulders
and the lean head brought back to me the rainy moorlands about
the Cauldstaneslap and the mad fellow whose prison I had shared.
Muckle John had gone to the Plantations, and 'twas Muckle John
or the devil that was moving there in the half light.</p>

<p>I cried on him, and ran down the side alley.</p>

<p>But it seemed that he did not want company, for he broke into
a run.</p>

<p>Now in those days I rejoiced in the strength of my legs, and
I was determined not to be thus balked. So I doubled after him
into a maze of tobacco and melon beds.</p>

<p>But it seemed he knew how to run. I caught a glimpse of his hairy
legs round the corner of a shed, and then lost him in a patch
of cane. Then I came out on a sort of causeway floored with boards
which covered a marshy sluice, and there I made great strides
on him. He was clear against the sky now, and I could see that
he was clad only in shirt and cotton breeches, while at his waist
flapped an ugly sheath-knife.</p>

<p>Rounding the hut corner I ran full into a man.</p>

<p>"Hold you," cried the stranger, and laid hands on my arm; but
I shook him off violently, and continued the race. The collision
had cracked my temper, and I had a mind to give Muckle John a
lesson in civility. For Muckle John it was beyond doubt; not two
men in the broad earth had that ungainly bend of neck.</p>

<p>The next I knew we were out on the river bank on a shore of hard
clay which the tides had created. Here I saw him more clearly,
and I began to doubt. I might be chasing some river-side ruffian,
who would give me a knife in my belly for my pains.</p>

<p>The doubt slackened my pace, and he gained on me. Then I saw
his intention. There was a flat-bottomed wherry tied up by the
bank, and for this he made. He flung off the rope, seized a long
pole, and began to push away.</p>

<p>The last rays of the westering sun fell on his face, and my hesitation
vanished. For those pent-house brows and deep-set, wild-cat eyes
were fixed for ever in my memory.</p>

<p>I cried to him as I ran, but he never looked my road. Somehow
it was borne in on me that at all costs I must have speech with
him. The wherry was a yard or two from the shore when I jumped
for its stern.</p>

<p>I lighted firm on the wood, and for a moment looked Muckle John
in the face. I saw a countenance lean like a starved wolf, with
great weals as of old wounds on cheek and brow. But only for a,
second, for as I balanced myself to step forward he rammed the
butt of the pole in my chest, so that I staggered and fell plump
in the river.</p>

<p>The water was only up to my middle, but before I could clamber
back he had shipped his oars, and was well into the centre of
the stream.</p>

<p>I stood staring like a zany, while black anger filled my heart.
I plucked my pistol forth, and for a second was on the verge of
murder, for I could have shot him like a rabbit. But God mercifully
restrained my foolish passion, and presently the boat and the
rower vanished in the evening haze.</p>

<p>"This is a bonny beginning!" thought I, as I waded through the
mud to the shore. I was wearing my best clothes in honour of my
arrival, and they were all fouled and plashing.</p>

<p>Then on the bank above me I saw the fellow who had run into me
and hindered my catching Muckle John on dry land. He was shaking
with laughter.</p>

<p>I was silly and hot-headed in those days, and my wetting had
not disposed me to be laughed at. In this fellow I saw a confederate
of Gib's, and if I had lost one I had the other. So I marched
up to him and very roundly damned his insolence.</p>

<p>He was a stern, lantern-jawed man of forty or so, dressed very
roughly in leather breeches and a frieze coat. Long grey woollen
stockings were rolled above his knees, and slung on his back was
an ancient musket.</p>

<p>"Easy, my lad," he said. "It's a free country, and there's no
statute against mirth."</p>

<p>"I'll have you before the sheriff," I cried. "You tripped me
up when I was on the track of the biggest rogue in America."</p>

<p>"So!" said he, mocking me. "You'll be a good judge of rogues.
Was it a runaway redemptioner, maybe? You'd be looking for the
twenty hogsheads reward."</p>

<p>This was more than I could stand. I was carrying a pistol in
my hand, and I stuck it to his ear. "March, my friend," I said.
"You'll walk before me to a Justice of the Peace, and explain
your doings this night."</p>

<p>I had never threatened a man with a deadly weapon before, and
I was to learn a most unforgettable lesson. A hand shot out, caught
my wrist, and forced it upwards in a grip of steel. And when I
would have used my right fist in his face another hand seized
that, and my arms were padlocked.</p>

<p>Cool, ironical eyes looked into mine.</p>

<p>"You're very free with your little gun, my lad. Let me give you
a word in season. Never hold a pistol to a man unless you mean
to shoot. If your eyes waver you had better had a porridge stick."</p>

<p>He pressed my wrist back till my fingers relaxed, and he caught
my pistol in his teeth. With a quick movement of the head he dropped
it inside his shirt.</p>

<p>"There's some would have killed you for that trick, young sir,"
he said. "It's trying to the temper to have gunpowder so near
a man's brain. But you're young, and, by your speech, a new-comer.
So instead I'll offer you a drink."</p>

<p>He dropped my wrists, and motioned me to follow him. Very crestfallen
and ashamed, I walked in his wake to a little shanty almost on
the wateredge. The place was some kind of inn, for a negro brought
us two tankards of apple-jack, and tobacco pipes, and lit a foul-smelling
lantern, which he set between us.</p>

<p>"First," says the man, "let me tell you that I never before clapped
eyes on the long piece of rascality you were seeking. He looked
like one that had cheated the gallows."</p>

<p>"He was a man I knew in Scotland," I said grumpily.</p>

<p>"Likely enough. There's a heap of Scots redemptioners hereaways.
I'm out of Scotland myself, or my forbears were, but my father
was settled in the Antrim Glens. There's wild devils among them,
and your friend looked as if he had given the slip to the hounds
in the marshes. There was little left of his breeches.... Drink,
man, or you'll get fever from your wet duds."</p>

<p>I drank, and the strong stuff mounted to my unaccustomed brain;
my tongue was loosened, my ill-temper mellowed, and I found myself
telling this grim fellow much that was in my heart.</p>

<p>"So you're a merchant," he said. "It's not for me to call down
an honest trade, but we could be doing with fewer merchants in
these parts. They're so many leeches that suck our blood. Are
you here to make siller?"</p>

<p>I said I was, and he laughed. "I never heard of your uncle's
business, Mr. Garvald, but you'll find it a stiff task to compete
with the lads from Bristol and London. They've got the whole dominion
by the scruff of the neck."</p>

<p>I replied that I was not in awe of them, and that I could hold
my own with anybody in a fair trade.</p>

<p>"Fair trade!" he cried scornfully. "That's just what you won't
get. That's a thing unkenned in Virginia. Look you here, my lad.
The Parliament in London treats us Virginians like so many puling
bairns. We cannot sell our tobacco except to English merchants,
and we cannot buy a horn spoon except it comes in an English ship.
What's the result of that? You, as a merchant, can tell me fine.
The English fix what price they like for our goods, and it's the
lowest conceivable, and they make their own price for what they
sell us, and that's as high as a Jew's. There's a fine profit
there for the gentlemen-venturers of Bristol, but it's starvation
and damnation for us poor Virginians."</p>

<p>"What's the result?" he cried again. "Why, that there's nothing
to be had in the land except what the merchants bring. There's
scarcely a smith or a wright or a cobbler between the James and
the Potomac. If I want a bed to lie in, I have to wait till the
coming of the tobacco convoy, and go down to the wharves and pay
a hundred pounds of sweet-scented for a thing you would buy in
the Candleriggs for twenty shillings. How, in God's name, is a
farmer to live if he has to pay usury for every plough and spade
and yard of dimity!"</p>

<p>"Remember you're speaking to a merchant," I said. "You've told
me the very thing to encourage me. If prices are high, it's all
the better for me."</p>

<p>"It would be," he said grimly, "if your name werena what it is,
and you came from elsewhere than the Clyde. D'you think the proud
English corporations are going to let you inside? Not them. The
most you'll get will be the scraps that fall from their table,
my poor Lazarus, and for these you'll have to go hat in hand to
Dives."</p>

<p>His face grew suddenly earnest, and he leaned on the table and
looked me straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>"You're a young lad and a new-comer, and the accursed scales
of Virginia are not yet on your eyes. Forbye, I think you've spirit,
though it's maybe mixed with a deal of folly. You've your choice
before you, Mr. Garvald. You can become a lickspittle like the
rest of them, and no doubt you'll gather a wheen bawbees, but
it will be a poor shivering soul will meet its Maker in the hinder
end. Or you can play the man and be a good Virginian. I'll not
say it's an easy part. You'll find plenty to cry you down, and
there will be hard knocks going; but by your face I judge you're
not afraid of that. Let me tell you this land is on the edge of
hell, and there's sore need for stout men. They'll declare in
this town that there's no Indians on this side the mountains that
would dare to lift a tomahawk. Little they ken!"</p>

<p>In his eagerness he had gripped my arm, and his dark, lean face
was thrust close to mine.</p>

<p>"I was with Bacon in '76, in the fray with the Susquehannocks.
I speak the Indian tongues, and there's few alive that ken the
tribes like me. The folk here live snug in the Tidewater, which
is maybe a hundred miles wide from the sea, but of the West they
ken nothing. There might be an army thousands strong concealed
a day's journey from the manors, and never a word would be heard
of it."</p>

<p>"But they tell me the Indians are changed nowadays," I put in.
"They say they've settled down to peaceful ways like any Christian."</p>

<p>"Put your head into a catamount's mouth, if you please," he said
grimly, "but never trust an Indian. The only good kind is the
dead kind. I tell you we're living on the edge of hell. It may
come this year or next year or five years hence, but come it will.
I hear we are fighting the French, and that means that the tribes
of the Canadas will be on the move. Little you know the speed
of a war-party. They would cut my throat one morning, and be hammering
at the doors of James Town before sundown. There should be a line
of forts in the West from the Roanoke to the Potomac, and every
man within fifty miles should keep a gun loaded and a horse saddled.
But, think you the Council will move? It costs money, say the
wiseacres, as if money were not cheaper than a slit wizzand!"</p>

<p>I was deeply solemnized, though I scarce understood the full
drift of his words, and the queer thing was that I was not ill-pleased.
I had come out to seek for trade, and it looked as if I were to
find war. And all this when I was not four hours landed.</p>

<p>"What think you of that?" he asked, as I kept silent, "I've been
warned. A man I know on the Rappahannock passed the word that
the Long House was stirring. Tell that to the gentry in James
Town. What side are you going for, young sir?"</p>

<p>"I'll take my time," I said, "and see for myself. Ask me again
this day six months."</p>

<p>He laughed loud. "A very proper answer for a Scot," he cried.
"See for yourself, travel the country, and use the wits God gave
you to form your judgment."</p>

<p>He paid the lawing, and said he would put me on the road back.
"These alleys are not very healthy at this hour for a young gentleman
in braw clothes."</p>

<p>Once outside the tavern he led me by many curious by-paths till
I found myself on the river-side just below the Court-house. It
struck me that my new friend was not a popular personage in the
town, for he would stop and reconnoitre at every turning, and
he chose the darkest side of the road.</p>

<p>"Good-night to you," he said at length. "And when you have finished
your travels come west to the South Fork River and ask for Simon
Frew, and I'll complete your education."</p>

<p>I went to bed in a glow of excitement. On the morrow I should
begin a new life in a world of wonders, and I rejoiced to think
that there was more than merchandise in the prospect.</p>
