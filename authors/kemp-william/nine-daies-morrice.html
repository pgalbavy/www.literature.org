<P>
--------------------------------
<P>
Honorable Mistris in the waine of my little wit, I am forst to desire
your protection, else every Ballad-singer will proclaime me bankrupt of
honesty, A sort of mad fellows seeing me merrily dispos'd in a Morrice,
have so bepainted mee in print since my gambols began from London to
Norwich, that (having but an ill face before) I shall appeare to the
world without a face, if your fayre hand wipe not away their foule
colours. One hath written Kemps farewell to the tune of Kery,
merym Buffe: another his desperate daungers in his late travaile: the
third his entertainement to New-Market; which towne I came never neere
by the length of halfe the heath. Some sweare in a Trenchmore I have
trode a good way to winne the world: others that guesse righter,
affirme, I have without good help daunst myselfe out of the world: many
say things that were never thought, But in a word your poor servant
offers the truth of his progresse and profit to your honorable view,
receive it I beseech you, such as it is, rude and plaine, for I know
your pure judgement, lookes as soone to see beauty in a Blackamoore, or
heare smooth speech from a Stammerer, as to finde anyting but blunt
mirth in a Morrice dauncer, especially such a one as Will Kemp,
that hath spent his life in mad jigges and merry jestes. Three reasons
moove me to make a publik this journey, one to reprove lying fooles I
never knew: the other to comend loving friends, which by the way I daily
found: the third to shew my duety to your honorable selfe, whose favours
(among other bountifull friends) makes me (dispight of this sad world)
judge my hart Corke, & my heeles feathers, so that me thinkes I could
flye to Rome (at least hop to Rome, as the olde Proverb is) with a
morter on my head. In which light conveit I lowly begge pardon and
leave, for my Tabrer strikes his huntsup, I must to Norwich: Imagine
Noble Mistris, I am now setting from Lord Mayors, the houre about
seaven, the morning gloomy, the company many, my hart merry.
Your worthy Ladyships most
unworthy servant,
William Kemp
<P>
<P>
<P>
Kemps nine daies wonder:
<P>
Performed in a Morrice from London to Norwich.
Wherein every dayes journey is pleasantly set downe, to satisfie
his friends the truth, against all lying Ballad-makers;
what he did, how he was welcome, and by whome entertained.
<P>
---------------
<P>
The first daies journey, being the first
Munday in cleane Lent, from the right honorable the Lord Mayors of
London.
<P>
The first mundaye in Lant, the close morning promising a cleere day,
(attended on by Thomas Slye my Taberer, William Bee my servant and
George Sprat, appointed for my overseer, that I should take no other
ease but my prescribed order) my selfe, thats I, otherwise called
Caualiero Kemp, head-Master of Morrice-dauncers, high Head-borough of
heighs, and onely tricker of your Trill-lilles, and best bel-shangles
betweene Sion and mount Surrey [Sion neere Brainford, and mount Surrey
by Norwich.] began frolickly to foote it, from the right honorable the
Lord Mayors of London, towards the right worshipfull (and truly
bountifull) Master Mayors of Norwich.
<P>
My setting forward was somewhat before seaven in the morning, my Taberer
stroke up merrily, and as fast as kinde peoples thronging together would
give me leave, thorow London I leapt: By the way many good olde people
and divers others of yonger yeeres, of meere kindness, gave me bowd
sixpences and grotes, blessing me with their harty prayers and God-speedes.
<P>
Seeing past White chappell, and having left faire London, with all that
North-east Suburb before named, multitudes of Londoners left not me: but
eyther to keepe a custome which many holde, that Mile-end is no walke
without a recreatio at Stratford Bow with Creame and Cakes, or else for
love they beare toward me, or perhappes to make themselves merry, if I
should chance (as many thought) to give over my Morrice within a mile of
Mile-end. How ever, many a thousand brought me to Bow, where I rested a
while from dancing, but had small rest with those that would have urg'd
me to drinking. But I warrant you Will Kemp was wise enough: to their
ful cups, kinde thanks was my returne, with Gentlemanlike protestations:
as, truely sir, I dare not: it stands not with the congruity of my
health. Congruitie said I: how came that strange language in my mouth: I
thinke scarcely that it is any Christen worde, and yet it may be a good
worde for uoght I knowe, though I never made it, nor doe verye well
understand it; yet I am sure I have bought it at the word-mongers, at as
deare a rate as I could have had a whole 100. of Bavives at the wood-mongers.
Farewell Congruitie for I meane now to be more concise, and stand upon
evener bases: but I must neither stand nor sit, the Tabrer strikes
alarum. Tickle it good Tom, Ile follow thee. Farewell Bowe, have over
the Bridge, where I once heard say, honest Conscience was once drownd.
Its pittye if it were so: but thats no matter belonging to our Morrice,
lets now along to Stratford Langton.
<P>
Many good fellows being there met, and knowing how well I loved the
sporte, had prepared a Beare-bayting: but so unreasonable were the
multitudes of people, that I could only heare the Beare roare, and the
dogges howle: therefore forward I went with my hey de gaies to Ilford,
where I againe rested, and was by the people of the towne and countrey
there-about, very very welcomed: being offered carowles in the great
spoon, [a great spoone in Infor holding above a quart] one whole draught
being able at that time to have drawne my little wit drye: but being
afrayde of the olde Proverbe (He had need of a long spoone that eates
with the devill) I soberly gave my boone Companyons the slip.
<P>
From Ilford by Moone-shine, I set forward, dauncing within a quarter of
a myle of Romford: wherein the high way, two strong Jades (having belike
some great quarell to me unknowne) were beating & byting either of
other. And such through Gods help was my good hap, that I escaped their
hoofes, both being raysed with their fore feete over my head, like two
Smithes over an Anvyle.
<P>
There being the end of my first dayes Morrice, a kinde Gentleman of
London lighting from his horse, would have no nay but I should leap into
his saddle. To be plain with ye, I was not proud , but kindly tooke his
kindlyer offer, chiefely thereto urg'd by my weariness: so I rid to my
Inne at Romford.
<P>
In that towne, to give rest to my well labour'd limbes, I continued two
dayes, bing much beholding to the towns-men for there love, but more to
the Londoners, that came hourely thither in great numbers to visite me:
offring much more kindness then I was willing to accept.
<P>
The second dayes journey, beeing Thursday
of the first weeke.
<P>
Thursday being Market day at Burnt-wood, Tom Slye was earlyer up then
the Lark, and sounded merrily at the Morrice: I rowsed my selfe, and
returned from Romford ro the place wher I tooke horse the first night,
dauncing that quarter of a myle backe againe thorow Romford, and so
merrily to Burnt-wood: yet now I remember it well, I had no great cause
of mirth, for at Romford townes end I strained my hip, and for a time
indured exceeding paine: but being loath to trouble a Surgeon I held on,
finding remedy by labour that had hurt mee, for it came in a turne, and
so in my daunce I turned it out of my service againe.
<P>
The multitudes were se great at my commin to Burntwood, that I had much
a doe (though I made many intreaties and staies) to get passage to my Inne.
<P>
In this towne two Cut-purses were taken, that with other two of their
companions followed mee from London (as many better disposed persons
did:) but these two dy-doppers gave out when they were appregended, that
they had laid wagers and betted about my journey, whereupon the Officers
bringing them to my Inne, I justly denyed their acquaintance, saving
that I remembred one of them to be a noted Cut-purse, such a one as we
tye to a poaston on our stage, for all people to wonder at, when at a
play they ae taken pilfring.
<P>
This fellow & his half brother being found with the deed, were sent to
Jayle: their other two consorts had the charity of the towne, & after a
dance of Trenchmore at the whipping crosse, they were sent back to
London: where I am afraid there are too many of their occupation. To bee
short I thought my selfe well rid of foure such followers, and I wish
hartily that the whole world were cleer of such companions.
<P>
Having rested well at Burntwood, the Moone shining clearely, and the
weather being calme, in the evening I tript it to Ingerstone, stealing
away from those numbers of people that followed mee: yet doe I what I
could, U had about fiftie in the company, some of London, the other of
the Country thereabout, that would needs when they heard my Taber,
trudge after me through thicke and thin.
<P>
The third dayes journey, being Friday of
the first weeke.
<P>
On Friday morning I set forward towardes Chelmsford, not having past two
hundred, being the least company that I had in the day time: betweene
London and that place, Onward I went thus easily followed, till I come
to Witford-bridge where a number of country people, and many Gentlemen
and Gentlewomen, were gathered together to wee me. Sir Thomas Mildmay
standing at his Parkepale, received gently a payre of garters of me:
gloves, points, and garters, being my ordinary marchandize, that I put
out to venter for performance of my merry voyage.
<P>
So mauch a doe I had to passe by the people at Chelmsford, that it was
more than an houre ere I could recover my Inne gate, where I was faine
to lacke myselfe in my Chamber, and pacifie them with wordes out of a
window insteed of deeds: to deale plainely I was so weary, that I could
dance no more.
<P>
The next morning I footed it three myle of my way toward Braintree: but
returned bacek againe to Chelmsford, where I lay that Satterday and the
next Sunday. The good cheere and kinde welcome I had at Chelmsford, was
much more than I was willing to entertaine: for my onely desire was to
refraine drinke, and be temperate in my dyet.
<P>
At Chelmsford a Mayde not passing foureteene yeares of age, dwelling
with one Sudley my kinde friend, made request to her Master and Dame,
that she might daunce the Morrice with me in a great large roome. They
being intreated I was soone wonne, to fit her with bels, besides she
would have the olde fashion with napkins on her armes, and to our jumps
we fell. A whole houre she held out: but then being ready to lye downe I
left her off: but thus much in her praise, I would have challenged the
strongest man in Chelmsford, and amongst many I thinke few would have
done so much.
<P>
<P>
The fourth dayes journey, beeing
Munday of the second
weeke.
<P>
On Munday morning very early, I red the 3. myles that I daunst the
satterday before: where alighting, my Taberer strucke up, and lightly I
tript forward, but I had the heaviest way that ever mad Morrice-dancer
trod: yet
<P>
With hey and ho, through thicke and thin,
the hobby horse quite forgotten,
I follow'd as I did begin,
although the way were rotten
<P>
This foule way I could finde no ease in, thicke woods being on eyther
side the lane: the lane likewise being full of deep holes. sometimes I
skipt up to the waste: but it is and old Proverb. That it is a little
comfort to the miserable to have companions, and amidst this merry way,
I had some mirth by an unlookt for accident.
<P>
It was the custome of honest Country Fellows my unknowne friends, upon
hearing of my Pype (which might well be heard in a still morning or
evening a myle) to get up and beare mee company a little way. In this
foule way two pretty plaine youthes watcht me, and with their kindness
somewhat hindred me. One a fine light fellow
would be still before me, the other ever at my heeles. At length comming
to a broad plash of water and mud, which could not be avoyded, I fetcht
a rise, yet fell in over the anckles at the further end. My youth that
follow'd me, tooke his jump, and stuck fast in the midst crying out to
his companion, come George, call yee this dauncing, Ile goe no further:
for indeede hee could goe no further, till his fellow was faine to wade
and help him out. I could not chuse but lough to see howe like two
frogges they laboured: a hartye farwell I gave them, and they faintly
bad God speed me, saying if I daunst that durties way this seaven yeares
againe, they would never daunce after me.
<P>
Well, with much a doo I got into Braintree by noone, tarried there
Munday night and the next day: onely I daunst three miles on Tewsday, to
ease my Wednesdaies journey.
<P>
If I should deny that I was welcome at Braintree, I should slander an
honest crew of kind men, among whome I far'd well, slept well, and was
every way well usde.
<P>
<P>
The fift dayes journey being Wednesday of
the second weeke.
<P>
Taking advantage of my 3. miles that I had daunst ye day before, this
wednesday morning I tript it to Sudbury, whether came to see a very
kinde Gentleman Master Foskew, that had before travailed a foote from
London to Barwick: who giving me good counsaile to observe temperate
dyet for my health, and other advise to bee carefull of my company,
besides his liberall entertainment, departed leaving me much indebted to
his love.
<P>
In this towne of Sudbury, there came a lusty tall fellow, a butcher by
his profession, that would in a Morrice keepe mee company to Bury: I
being glad of his friendly offer, gave him thatkes, and forward wee did
set: but ere ever wee had measur'd halfe a mile of our way, he gave me
over in the plain field, protesting, that if he might get a 100. pound,
he would not hold out with me, for indeed my pace in dauncing is not ordinary.
<P>
As he and I were parting, a lusty Country lasse bing among the people,
cal'd him faint hearted lout: saying, if I had begun to daunce, I would
have held out one myle though it had cast my life. At which wordes many
laughed. Nay saith she, if the Dauncer will lend me a leash of his
belles, Ile venter to treade one mile with him my selfe. I lookt upon
her, saw mirth in her eies, heard boldnes in her words, and beheld her
ready to tucke up her russet petticoate, I fitted her with bels: which
he merrily taking, garisht her thicke short legs, and with a smooth brow
bad the Tabrer begin. The Drum strucke, forward marcht I with my merry
Mayde-marian: who shooke her fat sides: and fotted it merrily to Melford,
being a long myle. There parting with her, I gave her (besides her skin
full of drinke) and English crowne to buy more drinke, for good wench
she was in a pittious heate: my kindnes she requited with dropping some
dozen of short courtsies, and bidding God blesse the Dauncer, I bad her
adieu: and to give her her due, she had a good care, daunst truely, and
wee parted friendly. But ere I part with her a good fellow my friend,
havin writ an odde Rime of her, I will make bolde to set it downe.
<P>
A Country Lasse browne as a berry,
Blith of blee in heart as merry,
Cheekes well fed and sides well larded
Every bone with fat flesh guarded,
Meeting merry Kemp by chaunce,
Was Marrian in his Morrice daunce,
Her stump legs with bels were garnisht,
Her browne browes with sweating varnish;
Her browne hips when she was lag,
To win her ground, went swig a swag,
Which to see all that came after,
Were repleate with mirthfull laughter.
Yet she thumpt it on her way,
With a sportly hey de gay,
At a mile her daunce she ended,
Kindly paide and well commended.
<P>
At Melford, divers Gentlemen met mee, who brought me to one master
Colts, a very kinde and worshipfull Gentleman, where I had unexpected
entertainment till the Satterday. From whose house having hope somewhat
to amend my way to Bury, I determined to goe by Clare, but I found it to
be both farther and fouler.
<P>
<P>
The sixt dayes journey being Satterday of
the second weeke.
<P>
From Wednesday night til Satterday having bin very troublesome, but much
more welcome to master Colts: in the morning I tooke my leave, and was
accompanied with many Gentlemen a myle of my way. Whicn myle master
Calts his foole would needs daunce with me, and had his desire, where
leaving me, two fooles parted faire in a foule way: I keeping on my
course to Clare, where I a wahile rested, and then cheerefully set
forward to Bury.
<P>
Passing from Clare towards Bury, I was invited to the house of a very
bountiful widdow, whose husband during his life was a Yeoman of that
Countrie, dying rich no doubt, as might well appeare, by the riches and
plentie, that abounded in every corner of the house. She is called the
Widdow Everet.
<P>
At her house were met above thirty Gentlemen. Such, and so plentifull
variety of good fare, I have very sildome seene in any Commoners house.
Her behavious being very modest and freendly, argued her bringing up not
to be rude. She was a woman of good presence: and if a foole may judge,
of no small discretioin.
<P>
From this widdowes I daunst to Bury, comming in on the Satterday in the
afternoone, at what time the right Honorable, the Lord Chiefe Justice
antred at an other gate of the towne, the wondring and regardles
multitude making his honor cleere way, left the streetes where he past
to gape at me: the throng of them being so great, that poore Will Kemp
was seaven times stayed ere hee could recover his Inne. By reason of the
great snow that then fell, I stayd at Bury from Satterday in the second
week of my setting foorth, til Thursday night the next weeke following.
<P>
The seaventh dayes journey being Friday of
the third weeke.
<P>
Upon Fryday morning I set on towardes Thetford, dauncing that tenne mile
in three houres: for I left Bury fomewhat after seaven in the morning,
and was at Thetford somewhat after ten that same forenoone. But indeed
considering how I had been booted the other journeys before, and that
all this way ar the most of it was over a heath, it was no great wonder:
for I far'd like one that had escaped the stockes, and tride the use of
his legs to out-run the Constable: so light was my heeles, that I
counted the ten mile no bettr than a leape.
<P>
At my entrance into Thetford, the people came in great numbers to see
mee: for there were many there, being Size time. The noble Gentleman Sir
Edwin Rich, gave me entertainment in such bountifull sort, during my
continuance there Satterday and Sunday, that I want fitte words to
expresse the least part of his worthy usage of my unwortines: and to
conclude liberally as hee had begun and continued, at my departure on
Munday, his worship gave me five pound.
<P>
<P>
The eyght dayes journey being Munday of
the fourth weeke.
<P>
On Munday morning I daunst to Rackland ere I rested, and comming to my
Inne where the hoast was a very boone companion, I desir'd to see him:
but in no case he would be spoken with, till he had shifted himselfe
from his working dayes sute. Being armed at all poyntes, from the cap to
the codpeece, his blacke shooes shining, and made straght with copper
buckles of the best, his garters in the fashion, and every garment
fitting Corremsquandam (to use his owne word): hee enters the hass with
his bonnet in his hand, began to crye out.
<P>
O Kemp deere Master Kemp: you are even as welcome as as as, and so
stammering, he began to study for a fit comparison, and I thanke him at
last he fitted me: fo saith he, thou art even as welcome, as the Queenes
best grey-hound. After this dogged yet well-meaning salutation, the
Carrowles were called in: and my friendly Hoast of Rackland began with.
All this: blessing the houre uppon his knees, that any of the Queenes
Majesties well-willer or friends would vouchsafe to come within his
house: as if never had any such had been within his doores before.
<P>
I tooke his good meaning, and gave him great thankes for his kindnesse:
and having rested mee well, began to take my course for Hingham, whether
my honest hoast of Rackland would needs be my guide: but good true
fat-belly he had not followed mee two fieldes, but he lyes all along,
and cryes after me to come backe and speake with him, dauncer quoth hee
if thou daunce a Gods name God speede thee: I cannot follow thee a foote
farther, but adieu good dauncer, God speed thee of thou daunce a Gods name.
<P>
I having haste of my way, and he being able to keep no way, there wee
parted. Farewell he, he was a kinde good fellow, a true Troyan: and it
ever be my lucke to meete him at more leasure, Ile make him full amendes
with a Cup full of Canarie, But nowe I am a little better advis'd, wee
must not thus let my madde hoast passe: for my friend late mentioned
before, that made the odde rime ob my Maide-marian, would needes
remember my hoast. Such as it is Ile bluntly set downe.
<P>
He was a man not over spare,
In his eybals dwelt no care,
Anon anon and welcome friend,
Were the most wordes he usde to spend,
Save sometime he would sit and tell,
What wonders once in Bullayne fell;
Closing each period of his tale,
With a full cup of Nut-browne Ale.
Turwin and Turneys siedge were hot,
Yet all my Hoast remembers not.
Ketsfield and Muselborough fray,
Were batlles fought but yesterday.
O twas a goodly matter then,
To see your sword and buckler men;
They would meete them every where:
And now a man is but a pricke,
A boy arm'd with a poating sticke,
Will dare to challenge Cutting Dicke.
O t'is a world the world to see,
But twill not mend for thee nor mee.
By this some guest cryes ho the house,
A fresh friend hath a fresh carouse,
Still he will drinke, and still be dry,
And quafee with every company.
Saint Martin send him merry mates
To anter at his hostree gates:
For a blither lad than he
Cannot an Inkeeper be.
<P>
Well once againe farewell mine Hoast at Rockland: after al these
farewels I am sure to Hingham I found a foule way, as before I had done
from Thetford to Rockland.
<P>
Yet besides the deep way I was much hindred by the desire people had to
see me. For even as our Shop-keepers will hayle, and pull a man with
Lack ye :`what do you lack Gentlemen:' My ware is best cryes one: mine
best in England sayes an other: heere shall you have choyse saith the
third: so was the dyvers ?oyees of the young men and Maydens, which I
should meete at everie myles ende, thronging by twentie, and sometime
fortie, yea hundreths in a companie: One crying the fayrest way was
thorow their Village: another, this is the nearest and fayrest way, when
you have past but a myle and a halfe: an other sort crie, turne on the
left hand, some on the right hand: that I was so amazed, I knewe not
sometime which way I might best take: but hap hazard, the people still
accompanying me, wherewith I was much comforted, though the wayes were
badde: but as I said before at last I overtooke it.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The ninth dayes journey, being Wednesday
of the seconde weeke.
<P>
The next morning I left Hingham, nor staying till I came to
Barford-bridge, five young men running all the way with me, for
othrewise my pace was not for footemen.
<P>
From Barford bridge I daunst to Norwich: but coming within sight of the
Citty, perceiving so great a multitude and throng of people still
crowding more and more about me, mistrusting it would be a let to my
determined expedition, and pleasurable humour: which I long before
conceived to delight this Citty with (so far, as my best skill, and
industry of my long travelled sinewes could affoord them) I was advised,
and so tooke ease by that advise, to stay my Morrice a little above
Saint Giles his gate, where I tooke my gelding, and so rid into the
Citty, procrastinating my merry Morrice daunce through the Citty till
better opportunitie.
<P>
Being come into the Citty: Master Roger Wiler the Maior, and sundry
other of his worshipfull Brethren sent for me: who perceiveing howe I
intended to daunce into the Cittye that nyght: and being well satisfied
with the reasons, they allotted me time enough not to daunce in till
Satterday after: to the end that divers knights and Gentlemen, together
with their wines and Children (who had beene many dayes before deceyved
with expectation of my comming) might nowe have sufficient warning,
accordinly by Satterday following.
<P>
In the meane space, and during my still continuance in the Cittye
afterwards, they not onely very courteously offered to beare mine owne
charges and my followers, but very bountifully performed it at the
common charges: the Mayor and many of the Aldermen often times besides
invited us privately to theyr severall houses.
<P>
To make a short end of this tedious description of my entertainment:
Satterday no sooner came, but I returned without the Citty through Saint
Giles his gate: and beganne my Morrice where I left at that gate, but I
antred in at Saint Stephens gate, where one Thomas Gilbert in name of
all the rest of the Cittizens gave me a friendly and exceeding kind
welcome: I have no reason to omit, unlesse I would condemne my selfe of
ingratitude, partlye for the private affection of the writer towardes
me: as also for the generall love and favour I found in them, from the
highest to the lowest, the richest as the poorest. It followes in these
few lynes.
<P>
Master Kemp his welcome
to Norwich.
<P>
W ith hart, and hand, among the rest,
E specially you welcome are:
L ong looked for, as welcome guest,
C ome now at last you be from farre.
O f most within the Citty sure,
M any good wishes you have had.
E ach one did pray you might indure,
W ith courage good the match you made.
I ntend they did with gladsome hearts,
L ike your well willers, you to meete:
K now you also they'l doe their parts,
E yther in field or house to greete
M ore you then any with you came,
P rocur'd thereto with trump and fame.
<P>
Your well-willer,
<P>
T.G.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
Passing the gate, Wifflers (such Officers as were appointed by the
Mayor) to make me way through the throng of the people, which prest so
mightily upon me: with great labour I got thorow that narrow preaze into
the open market place. Where on the crosse, ready prepared, stood the
Citty Waytes, which not a little refreshed my weariness with towling
thorow so narrow a lane, as the people left me: such Waytes (under
Benedicite be it spoken) fewe Citties in our Realme have the like, none
better. Who besides their excellency in wind instruments, their rare
cunning on the Vyoll, and Violin: theyr voices be admirable, everie one
of them able to serve in any Cathedrall Church in Christendome for
Quiristers.
<P>
Passing by the Market place, the presse still increasing by the number
of boyes, girles, men and women, thronging more and more before me to
see the end. It was the mischaunce of a homely maide, that belike, was
but newly crept into the fashion of long wasted peticaotes tyde with
points, & had, as it seemed but one point tyed before, as I was
fetching a leape, it fell out that I set my foote on her skirts: the
point eyther breaking or stretching, off fell her peticoate from her
waste, but as chance was, though hir smock were course, it was cleanely:
yet the poore wench was so ashamed, the rather for that she could hardly
recover her coate againe from unruly boies, that looking before like one
that had the greene sicknesse, now had she her cheekes all coloured with
scarlet. I was sorry for her, but on I went towards the Maiors, and
deceived the people, by leaping over the Church-yard wass at S. Johns,
getting so into M. Mayors gates a neerer way: but at last I found it the
further way about: being forced on the Tewsday following to renew my
former daunce, because George Sprat my over-seer having lost me in the
throng, would not be deposed that I had daunst it, since he saw me not:
and I must confesse I did not wel, for the CIttizens had caused all the
turne-pikes to be taken up on Satterday, that I might not bee hindred.
But now I returne againe to my Jump, the measure of which is to be seene
in the Guild-hall at Norwich, where my buskins, that I then Wore, and
daunst in from London thither, stand equally devided, nailde on the
wall. The plenty of good cheere at the Mayors, his bounty, and kinde
usage, together with the General welcomes of his wurshipful brethren,
and many other knights, Ladies, Gentlemen & Gentlewomen, so much
exceeded my expectation, as I adivg'd my selfe most bound to them all.
The Maior gave me five pound in Elsabeth angels: which Maior
(faire Madame, to whom I too presumptiously dedicate my idle paces) as a
man worthy of a singuler and impartiall admiration, if our criticke
humorous mindes could as prodigally conceive as he deserves, for his
chast life, liberality, & tempreance in possessing worldly benefits: he
lives unmarried and childlesse, never purchased house nor land: the
house he dwels in thes yeere, being but hyred: he lives upon
marchandies, being a Marchant venturer. If our marchants & and
Gentlemen would take example by this man, Gentlemen would not sell their
lands, to become bankrout Marchants, nor Marchants live in the
possessions of youth-beguiled gentlemen: who cast themselves out of
their parents heritages for a few out-cast commodities. But wit whither
wilt thou: What hath Morrice tripping Will to do with that: it keeps not
time wt his dance: therefore roome you moral precepts, give my hands
leave to perfect this worthlesse poore tottered volume.
<P>
Pardon me Madame, that I am thus tedious, I cannot chuse but comend
sacred liberality, which makes poore wretches partakers of all
comfortable benefits, besides the love & favour already repeated:
M. Weild the mayor gave me 40. s. yeerely during my life, making me a
free man of the marchant venturers, this is the substance of my journey:
therfore let no man beleeve how ever before by lying ballets & rumours
they have bin abus'd: yr either waies were laid open for me, or that I
delivered gifts to her Majesty. Its good being merry my masters, but in
a meane, & al my mirths, (meane though they be) have bin & ever shal
be imploi'd to the delight of my royal Mistris: whose sacred name ought
not to be remembred among such ribald rimes as these late thinbreecht
lying Balletsingers have proclaimed it.
<P>
It resteth now that in a word I shew, what profit I have made by my
Morrice: true it is I put out some money to have threefold gaine at my
returne, some that lave me, regard my paines, & respect their promise,
have sent home the treble worth, some other at the first sight have
paide me, if I come to seek thee , others I cannot see, nor wil
willingly be found, and these are the greater number. If they had al usd
me wel, or al ill: Iwould have boldly set downe the true sum of my final
gain or losse, but I wil have patience, some few daies longer. At ye
end of which time, if any be behinde, I wil draw a cattalogue of al
their names I ventur'd with: those yt have shewne themselves honest
men, I wil set before them this Caracter H. for honesty: before the other
Bench-whistlers shal stand K. for Ketlers & keistrels, that wil drive a
good companion without need in them to contend for his owne, but I hope
I shall have no such neede. If I have, your Honorable protection shall
thus far defend your poore servant, that he may being a plain man, call a
spade a spade. Thus fearing your Ladyship is wearier with reading this
tow, then I was in all my merry travaile, I crave pardon: and conclude
this first pamphlet that ever Will Kemp offred to the Presse, being
thereunto prest on the one side by the pittifull papers pasted on every
poast, of that which was neither so nor so, and in the other side urg'd
thereto in duety to expresse with thankefulnes the kind entertainment I
found.
<P>
Your honors porre servant.

Kemps humble request to the impudent generation of
Ballad-makers and their coherents; that it would please their
rascalities to pitty his paines in the great journey he pretends, and not
fill the country with lyes of his never done actes as they did in his
late Morrice to Norwich.

My notable Shakerags, the effect of my sute is discovered in the Title
of my supplication. But for your better understandings: for that Iknow
you to be a sort of witles beetle-heads, that can understand nothing,
but what is knockt into your scalpes; These are by these presentes to
certifies unto your block-headships, that I William Kemp, whom you had
neer hand rent in sunder with your unreasonable rimes, am shortly God
willing to set forward as merily as I may; whether I my selfe know not.
Wherefore by the way I would with ye, imploy not your little wits in
certifying the world that I am gone to Rome, Jerusalem, Venice, or any
other place at your idle appoint. I knowe the best of ye by the lyes ye
writ of me, got not the price of a good hat to cover your brainless
heads: If any of ye had come to me, my bounty should have exceeded the
best of your good masters the Ballad-buiers, I wold have apparrelled
your dry pates in party coloured bonnets,& bestowed a leash of my cast
belles to have crown'd ye with cox-combs. I have made a privie search,
what private Jigmonger of your jolly number, hath been the Author of
thesis abhominable ballets written of me: I was told it was the great
ballet-maker T.D. alias Tho. Deloney, Chronicler of the memorable lives
of the 6. yeomen of the west, Jack of Newbery, the Gentle-craft,& such
like honest men: omitted by Stow, Hollinshead, Grafton, Hal,
froysart, &  the rest of those wel deserving writers: but I was given
since to understand, your late generall Thos. dyd poorely, as ye all must
do, and was honestly buried: which is much to be doubted of some of you.
The quest of inquiry finding him by death acquited of the Inditement, I
was let to wit, yt another Lord of litle wit, one whose imployment for
the Pageant, was utterly spent, he being knowne to be Eldertons
immediate heyre, was vehemently suspected: but after due inquesetion was
made, he was at that time knowne to lige lika a man in a mist, having
quite given over the mistery. Still the search continuing, I met a
proper upright youth, onely for a little stooping in the shoulders: all
hart to the heele, a penny poet whose first making was the miserable
stolne story of Macdoel, or Macdobeth, or Macsomewhat: for I am sure a
Mac it was, though I never had the maw to see it: & hee tolde me there
was a fat filthy balletmaker, that should have once been his Journeyman
to the trade: who liv'd about the towne: and ten to one, bat he had thus
terribly abused me & my Taberer: for thet he was able to do such a
thing in print. A shrewd presumption: I found him about the bankside,
sitting at a play, I desired to speake with him, had him to a Taverne,
charg'd a pipe with Tobacco and then laid this terrible accusation to
his charge. He swels presently like one og the foure windes, the
violence of his breath, blew the Tobacco out of the pipe, & the heate
of his wrath drunke dry two bowlfuls of Rhenish wine. At length having
power to speake. Name my accuser saith he, or I defye thee Kemp at the
quart staffe. I told him, & all his anger turned to laughter: swearing
it did him good to have ill words of a hoddy doddy, a habber de hoy, a
chicken, a squib, a squall: One that hath not wit enough to make a
ballet, that by Pol and Aedipol, would Pol his father,
Derick his dad: doe anie thing how ill so ever, to please his apish
humor. I hardly beleeved, this youth that I tooke to be gracious, had
bin so graceless: but I heard afterwards his mother in law was eye and
eare witness of his fathers abuse by this blessed childe ona publique
stage, in a merry Hoast of an Innes part. Yet all this while could not I
finde out the true ballet-maker. Till buy chaunce a friend of mine puld
out of his packet a booke in Latine called Mundus Furiosus:
printed at Cullen, written by one of the vildest and arrantest
lying Cullians that ever writ booke, his name Jansonius, who taking upon
him to write an abstract of all the turbulent actions that had beene
lately attempted or performed in Christendome, like an unchritian
wretch, writes onely by report, partially, and scoffingly of such whose
pages showes hee was unworthy to wipe, far indeed he is now dead:
farewell he, every dog must have day. But see the luck on't: this
beggerly lying busie-bodies name, brought out the Ballad-maker: and it
was generally confirmed, it was his kinsman: he confesses himselfe
guilty, let and man look on his face: if there be not so redde a colour
that all the sope in the towne will not washe white, let me be turned to
a Whiting as I passe betweene Dover and Calles. Well, God forgive thee
honest fellow, I see thou hast grace in thee: I prethee do so no more,
leace writing these beastly ballets, make not good wenches Prophetesses,
for little or no profit, nor for a sixe-penny matter, revive not a poore
fellowes fault thats hanged for his offence: it may be thy owne destiny
one day, prethee be good to them. Call up the olde Melpomene, whose
straubery quill may write the bloody lines of the blew Lady, and the
Prince of the burning crowne: a better subject I can tell ye: than your
knight of the Red Crosse. So farewel, and crosse me no more I prethee
with thy rabbel of bald rimes, least at my returne I set a crosse on thy
forehead, that all men may know thee for a foole.
