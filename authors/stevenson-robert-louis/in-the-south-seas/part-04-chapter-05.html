<p>We saw but little of the commons of the isle.  At first we met them at
the well, where they washed their linen and we drew water for the table.
The combination was distasteful; and, having a tyrant at command, we
applied to the king and had the place enclosed in our tapu.  It was one
of the few favours which Tembinok’ visibly boggled about granting, and it
may be conceived how little popular it made the strangers.  Many
villagers passed us daily going afield; but they fetched a wide circuit
round our tapu, and seemed to avert their looks.  At times we went
ourselves into the village—a strange place.  Dutch by its canals,
Oriental by the height and steepness of the roofs, which looked at dusk
like temples; but we were rarely called into a house: no welcome, no
friendship, was offered us; and of home life we had but the one view: the
waking of a corpse, a frigid, painful scene: the widow holding on her lap
the cold, bluish body of her husband, and now partaking of the
refreshments which made the round of the company, now weeping and kissing
the pale mouth.  (‘I fear you feel this affliction deeply,’ said the
Scottish minister.  ‘Eh, sir, and that I do!’ replied the widow.  ‘I’ve
been greetin’ a’ nicht; an’ noo I’m just gaun to sup this bit parritch,
and then I’ll begin an’ greet again.’)  In our walks abroad I have always
supposed the islanders avoided us, perhaps from distaste, perhaps by
order; and those whom we met we took generally by surprise.  The surface
of the isle is diversified with palm groves, thickets, and romantic
dingles four feet deep, relics of old taro plantation; and it is thus
possible to stumble unawares on folk resting or hiding from their work.
About pistol-shot from our township there lay a pond in the bottom of a
jungle; here the maids of the isle came to bathe, and were several times
alarmed by our intrusion.  Not for them are the bright cold rivers of
Tahiti or Upolu, not for them to splash and laugh in the hour of the dusk
with a villageful of gay companions; but to steal here solitary, to
crouch in a place like a cow-wallow, and wash (if that can be called
washing) in lukewarm mud, brown as their own skins.  Other, but still
rare, encounters occur to my memory.  I was several times arrested by a
tender sound in the bush of voices talking, soft as flutes and with quiet
intonations.  Hope told a flattering tale; I put aside the leaves; and
behold! in place of the expected dryads, a pair of all too solid ladies
squatting over a clay pipe in the ungraceful <u>ridi</u>.  The beauty of the
voice and the eye was all that remained to those vast dames; but that of
the voice was indeed exquisite.  It is strange I should have never heard
a more winning sound of speech, yet the dialect should be one remarkable
for violent, ugly, and outlandish vocables; so that Tembinok’ himself
declared it made him weary, and professed to find repose in talking
English.
</p>
<p>The state of this folk, of whom I saw so little, I can merely guess at.
The king himself explains the situation with some art.  ‘No; I no pay
them,’ he once said.  ‘I give them tobacco.  They work for me <u>all the
same brothers</u>.’  It is true there was a brother once in Arden!  But we
prefer the shorter word.  They bear every servile mark,—levity like a
child’s, incurable idleness, incurious content.  The insolence of the
cook was a trait of his own; not so his levity, which he shared with the
innocent Uncle Parker.  With equal unconcern both gambolled under the
shadow of the gallows, and took liberties with death that might have
surprised a careless student of man’s nature.  I wrote of Parker that he
behaved like a boy of ten: what was he else, being a slave of sixty?  He
had passed all his years in school, fed, clad, thought for, commanded;
and had grown familiar and coquetted with the fear of punishment.  By
terror you may drive men long, but not far.  Here, in Apemama, they work
at the constant and the instant peril of their lives; and are plunged in
a kind of lethargy of laziness.  It is common to see one go afield in his
stiff mat ungirt, so that he walks elbows-in like a trussed fowl; and
whatsoever his right hand findeth to do, the other must be off duty
holding on his clothes.  It is common to see two men carrying between
them on a pole a single bucket of water.  To make two bites of a cherry
is good enough: to make two burthens of a soldier’s kit, for a distance
of perhaps half a furlong, passes measure.  Woman, being the less
childish animal, is less relaxed by servile conditions.  Even in the
king’s absence, even when they were alone, I have seen Apemama women work
with constancy.  But the outside to be hoped for in a man is that he may
attack his task in little languid fits, and lounge between-whiles.  So I
have seen a painter, with his pipe going, and a friend by the studio
fireside.  You might suppose the race to lack civility, even vitality,
until you saw them in the dance.  Night after night, and sometimes day
after day, they rolled out their choruses in the great Speak House—solemn
andantes and adagios, led by the clapped hand, and delivered with an
energy that shook the roof.  The time was not so slow, though it was slow
for the islands; but I have chosen rather to indicate the effect upon the
hearer.  Their music had a church-like character from near at hand, and
seemed to European ears more regular than the run of island music.  Twice
I have heard a discord regularly solved.  From farther off, heard at
Equator Town for instance, the measures rose and fell and crepitated like
the barking of hounds in a distant kennel.
</p><p>The slaves are certainly not overworked—children of ten do more without
fatigue—and the Apemama labourers have holidays, when the singing begins
early in the afternoon.  The diet is hard; copra and a sweetmeat of
pounded pandanus are the only dishes I observed outside the palace; but
there seems no defect in quantity, and the king shares with them his
turtles.  Three came in a boat from Kuria during our stay; one was kept
for the palace, one sent to us, one presented to the village.  It is the
habit of the islanders to cook the turtle in its carapace; we had been
promised the shells, and we asked a tapu on this foolish practice.  The
face of Tembinok’ darkened and he answered nothing.  Hesitation in the
question of the well I could understand, for water is scarce on a low
island; that he should refuse to interfere upon a point of cookery was
more than I had dreamed of; and I gathered (rightly or wrongly) that he
was scrupulous of touching in the least degree the private life and
habits of his slaves.  So that even here, in full despotism, public
opinion has weight; even here, in the midst of slavery, freedom has a
corner.
</p><p>Orderly, sober, and innocent, life flows in the isle from day to day as
in a model plantation under a model planter.  It is impossible to doubt
the beneficence of that stern rule.  A curious politeness, a soft and
gracious manner, something effeminate and courtly, distinguishes the
islanders of Apemama; it is talked of by all the traders, it was felt
even by residents so little beloved as ourselves, and noticeable even in
the cook, and even in that scoundrel’s hours of insolence.  The king,
with his manly and plain bearing, stood out alone; you might say he was
the only Gilbert Islander in Apemama.  Violence, so common in Butaritari,
seems unknown.  So are theft and drunkenness.  I am assured the
experiment has been made of leaving sovereigns on the beach before the
village; they lay there untouched.  In all our time on the island I was
but once asked for drink.  This was by a mighty plausible fellow, wearing
European clothes and speaking excellent English—Tamaiti his name, or, as
the whites have now corrupted it, ‘Tom White’: one of the king’s
supercargoes at three pounds a month and a percentage, a medical man
besides, and in his private hours a wizard.  He found me one day in the
outskirts of the village, in a secluded place, hot and private, where the
taro-pits are deep and the plants high.  Here he buttonholed me, and,
looking about him like a conspirator, inquired if I had gin.
</p><p>I told him I had.  He remarked that gin was forbidden, lauded the
prohibition a while, and then went on to explain that he was a doctor, or
‘dogstar’ as he pronounced the word, that gin was necessary to him for
his medical infusions, that he was quite out of it, and that he would be
obliged to me for some in a bottle.  I told him I had passed the king my
word on landing; but since his case was so exceptional, I would go down
to the palace at once, and had no doubt that Tembinok’ would set me free.
Tom White was immediately overwhelmed with embarrassment and terror,
besought me in the most moving terms not to betray him, and fled my
neighbourhood.  He had none of the cook’s valour; it was weeks before he
dared to meet my eye; and then only by the order of the king and on
particular business.
</p><p>The more I viewed and admired this triumph of firm rule, the more I was
haunted and troubled by a problem, the problem (perhaps) of to-morrow for
ourselves.  Here was a people protected from all serious misfortune,
relieved of all serious anxieties, and deprived of what we call our
liberty.  Did they like it? and what was their sentiment toward the
ruler?  The first question I could not of course ask, nor perhaps the
natives answer.  Even the second was delicate; yet at last, and under
charming and strange circumstances, I found my opportunity to put it and
a man to reply.  It was near the full of the moon, with a delicious
breeze; the isle was bright as day—to sleep would have been sacrilege;
and I walked in the bush, playing my pipe.  It must have been the sound
of what I am pleased to call my music that attracted in my direction
another wanderer of the night.  This was a young man attired in a fine
mat, and with a garland on his hair, for he was new come from dancing and
singing in the public hall; and his body, his face, and his eyes were all
of an enchanting beauty.  Every here and there in the Gilberts youths are
to be found of this absurd perfection; I have seen five of us pass half
an hour in admiration of a boy at Mariki; and Te Kop (my friend in the
fine mat and garland) I had already several times remarked, and long ago
set down as the loveliest animal in Apemama.  The philtre of admiration
must be very strong, or these natives specially susceptible to its
effects, for I have scarce ever admired a person in the islands but what
he has sought my particular acquaintance.  So it was with Te Kop.  He led
me to the ocean side; and for an hour or two we sat smoking and talking
on the resplendent sand and under the ineffable brightness of the moon.
My friend showed himself very sensible of the beauty and amenity of the
hour.  ‘Good night! Good wind!’ he kept exclaiming, and as he said the
words he seemed to hug myself.  I had long before invented such
reiterated expressions of delight for a character (Felipe, in the story
of <u>Olalla</u>) intended to be partly bestial.  But there was nothing
bestial in Te Kop; only a childish pleasure in the moment.  He was no
less pleased with his companion, or was good enough to say so; honoured
me, before he left, by calling me Te Kop; apostrophised me as ‘My name!’
with an intonation exquisitely tender, laying his hand at the same time
swiftly on my knee; and after we had risen, and our paths began to
separate in the bush, twice cried to me with a sort of gentle ecstasy, ‘I
like you too much!’  From the beginning he had made no secret of his
terror of the king; would not sit down nor speak above a whisper till he
had put the whole breadth of the isle between himself and his monarch,
then harmlessly asleep; and even there, even within a stone-cast of the
outer sea, our talk covered by the sound of the surf and the rattle of
the wind among the palms, continued to speak guardedly, softening his
silver voice (which rang loud enough in the chorus) and looking about him
like a man in fear of spies.  The strange thing is that I should have
beheld him no more.  In any other island in the whole South Seas, if I
had advanced half as far with any native, he would have been at my door
next morning, bringing and expecting gifts.  But Te Kop vanished in the
bush for ever.  My house, of course, was unapproachable; but he knew
where to find me on the ocean beach, where I went daily.  I was the
<u>Kaupoi</u>, the rich man; my tobacco and trade were known to be endless: he
was sure of a present.  I am at a loss how to explain his behaviour,
unless it be supposed that he recalled with terror and regret a passage
in our interview.  Here it is:
</p><p>‘The king, he good man?’ I asked.
</p><p>‘Suppose he like you, he good man,’ replied Te Kop: ‘no like, no good.’
</p><p>That is one way of putting it, of course.  Te Kop himself was probably no
favourite, for he scarce appealed to my judgment as a type of industry.
And there must be many others whom the king (to adhere to the formula)
does not like.  Do these unfortunates like the king?  Or is not rather
the repulsion mutual? and the conscientious Tembinok’, like the
conscientious Braxfield before him, and many other conscientious rulers
and judges before either, surrounded by a considerable body of
‘grumbletonians’?  Take the cook, for instance, when he passed us by,
blue with rage and terror.  He was very wroth with me; I think by all the
old principles of human nature he was not very well pleased with his
sovereign.  It was the rich man he sought to waylay: I think it must have
been by the turn of a hair that it was not the king he waylaid instead.
And the king gives, or seems to give, plenty of opportunities; day and
night he goes abroad alone, whether armed or not I can but guess; and the
taro-patches, where his business must so often carry him, seem designed
for assassination.  The case of the cook was heavy indeed to my
conscience.  I did not like to kill my enemy at second-hand; but had I a
right to conceal from the king, who had trusted me, the dangerous secret
character of his attendant?  And suppose the king should fall, what would
be the fate of the king’s friends?  It was our opinion at the time that
we should pay dear for the closing of the well; that our breath was in
the king’s nostrils; that if the king should by any chance be bludgeoned
in a taro-patch, the philosophical and musical inhabitants of Equator
Town might lay aside their pleasant instruments, and betake themselves to
what defence they had, with a very dim prospect of success.  These
speculations were forced upon us by an incident which I am ashamed to
betray.  The schooner <u>H. L. Haseltine</u> (since capsized at sea, with the
loss of eleven lives) put into Apemama in a good hour for us, who had
near exhausted our supplies.  The king, after his habit, spent day after
day on board; the gin proved unhappily to his taste; he brought a store
of it ashore with him; and for some time the sole tyrant of the isle was
half-seas-over.  He was not drunk—the man is not a drunkard, he has
always stores of liquor at hand, which he uses with moderation,—but he
was muzzy, dull, and confused.  He came one day to lunch with us, and
while the cloth was being laid fell asleep in his chair.  His confusion,
when he awoke and found he had been detected, was equalled by our
uneasiness.  When he was gone we sat and spoke of his peril, which we
thought to be in some degree our own; of how easily the man might be
surprised in such a state by <u>grumbletonians</u>; of the strange scenes that
would follow—the royal treasures and stores at the mercy of the rabble,
the palace overrun, the garrison of women turned adrift.  And as we
talked we were startled by a gun-shot and a sudden, barbaric outcry.  I
believe we all changed colour; but it was only the king firing at a dog
and the chorus striking up in the Speak House.  A day or two later I
learned the king was very sick; went down, diagnosed the case; and took
at once the highest medical degree by the exhibition of bicarbonate of
soda.  Within the hour Richard was himself again; and I found him at the
unfinished house, enjoying the double pleasure of directing Rubam and
making a dinner of cocoa-nut dumplings, and all eagerness to have the
formula of this new sort of <u>pain-killer</u>—for <u>pain-killer</u> in the
islands is the generic name of medicine.  So ended the king’s modest
spree and our anxiety.
</p><p>On the face of things, I ought to say, loyalty appeared unshaken.  When
the schooner at last returned for us, after much experience of baffling
winds, she brought a rumour that Tebureimoa had declared war on Apemama.
Tembinok’ became a new man; his face radiant; his attitude, as I saw him
preside over a council of chiefs in one of the palace maniap’s, eager as
a boy’s; his voice sounding abroad, shrill and jubilant, over half the
compound.  War is what he wants, and here was his chance.  The English
captain, when he flung his arms in the lagoon, had forbidden him (except
in one case) all military adventures in the future: here was the case
arrived.  All morning the council sat; men were drilled, arms were
bought, the sound of firing disturbed the afternoon; the king devised and
communicated to me his plan of campaign, which was highly elaborate and
ingenious, but perhaps a trifle fine-spun for the rough and random
vicissitudes of war.  And in all this bustle the temper of the people
appeared excellent, an unwonted animation in every face, and even Uncle
Parker burning with military zeal.
</p><p>Of course it was a false alarm.  Tebureimoa had other fish to fry.  The
ambassador who accompanied us on our return to Butaritari found him
retired to a small island on the reef, in a huff with the Old Men, a tiff
with the traders, and more fear of insurrection at home than appetite for
wars abroad.  The plenipotentiary had been placed under my protection;
and we solemnly saluted when we met.  He proved an excellent fisherman,
and caught bonito over the ship’s side.  He pulled a good oar, and made
himself useful for a whole fiery afternoon, towing the becalmed <u>Equator</u>
off Mariki.  He went to his post and did no good.  He returned home
again, having done no harm.  <u>O si sic omnes</u>!
