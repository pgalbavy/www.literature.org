<p>As the sound of the furious voice stopped short, there fell a
stricken silence upon these three men.</p>

<p>Old Carson Tinker's gaze drifted downward from his employer's
face. He sat, then, gazing into the rosy little fire until something
upon the lapel of his coat caught his attention&mdash;a wilted and
disreputable carnation. He threw it into the fire; and, with a
sombre satisfaction, watched it sizzle. This brief pleasure ended,
he became expressionless and relapsed into complete mummification.</p>

<p>Potter cleared his throat several times, and as many times seemed
about to speak, and did not; but finally, hearing a murmur from
the old man gazing at the fire, he requested to be informed of
its nature.</p>

<p>"What?" Tinker asked, feebly.</p>

<p>"I said: 'What are you mumbling about?'"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"What was it you said?"</p>

<p>"I said it was the bride-look," said the old man gently. "That's
what it was about her&mdash;the bride-look."</p>

<p>"The bride-look!"</p>

<p>It was a word that went deep into the mourning heart of the playwright.
"The bride-look!" That was it: the bride's happiness!</p>

<p>"She had more than that," said Potter peevishly, but, if the
others had noticed it his voice shook. "She could act! And I don't
know how the devil to get along without that hypocrite. Just like
her to marry the first regular man that asked her!"</p>

<p>Then young Stewart Canby had a vision of a room in a boarding-house
far over in Brooklyn, and of two poor, brave young people there,
and of a loss more actual than his own&mdash;a vision of a hard-working,
careworn, stalwart Packer trying to comfort a weeping little bride
who had lost her chance&mdash;the one chance&mdash;"that might never have
come!"</p>

<p>Something leaped into generous life within him.</p>

<p>"I think I was almost going to ask her to marry me, to-morrow,"
he said, turning to Talbot Potter. "But I'm glad Packer's the
man. For years he's been a kind of nurse for you, Mr. Potter.
And that's what she needs&mdash;a nurse&mdash;because she's a genius, too.
And it will all be wasted if she doesn't get her chance!"</p>

<p>"Are you asking me to take her back?" Potter cried fiercely.
"Do you think I'll break one of my iron&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We couldn't all have married her!" said the playwright with
a fine inspiration. "But if you take her back we can all see her&mdash;every
day!"</p>

<p>The actor gazed upon him sternly, but with sensitive lips beginning
to quiver. He spoke uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Well," he began. "I'm no stubborn Frenchman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do it!" cried Canby.</p>

<p>Then Potter's expression changed; he looked queer.</p>

<p>He clapped his hands loudly; &mdash;Sato appeared.</p>

<p>"Sato, take that stuff out." He pointed to the untouched whiskey.
"Order supper at ten o'clock&mdash;for five people. Champagne. Orchids.
Get me a taxicab in half an hour."</p>

<p>"Yisso!"</p>

<p>Tinker rose, astounded. "Taxicab? Where you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To Brooklyn!" shouted Potter with shining eyes. "She'll drive
with me if I bring them both, I guess, won't she?"</p>

<p>He began to sing:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"For to-night we'll merry, merry be!<br/>
&nbsp;For to-night we'll merry, merry be&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>Leaping uproariously upon the aged Tinker, he caught him by the
waist and waltzed him round and round the room.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>
