<P>
Sir Nathaniel was in the library next morning, after breakfast, when
Adam came to him carrying a letter.
<P>
"Her ladyship doesn't lose any time.  She has begun work already!"
<P>
Sir Nathaniel, who was writing at a table near the window, looked
up.
<P>
"What is it?" said he.
<P>
Adam held out the letter he was carrying.  It was in a blazoned
envelope.
<P>
"Ha!" said Sir Nathaniel, "from the White Worm!  I expected
something of the kind."
<P>
"But," said Adam, "how could she have known we were here?  She
didn't know last night."
<P>
"I don't think we need trouble about that, Adam.  There is so much
we do not understand.  This is only another mystery.  Suffice it
that she does know--perhaps it is all the better and safer for us."
<P>
"How is that?" asked Adam with a puzzled look.
<P>
"General process of reasoning, my boy; and the experience of some
years in the diplomatic world.  This creature is a monster without
heart or consideration for anything or anyone.  She is not nearly so
dangerous in the open as when she has the dark to protect her.
Besides, we know, by our own experience of her movements, that for
some reason she shuns publicity.  In spite of her vast bulk and
abnormal strength, she is afraid to attack openly.  After all, she
is only a snake and with a snake's nature, which is to keep low and
squirm, and proceed by stealth and cunning.  She will never attack
when she can run away, although she knows well that running away
would probably be fatal to her.  What is the letter about?"
<P>
Sir Nathaniel's voice was calm and self-possessed.  When he was
engaged in any struggle of wits he was all diplomatist.
<P>
"She asks Mimi and me to tea this afternoon at Diana's Grove, and
hopes that you also will favour her."
<P>
Sir Nathaniel smiled.
<P>
"Please ask Mrs. Salton to accept for us all."
<P>
"She means some deadly mischief.  Surely--surely it would be wiser
not."
<P>
"It is an old trick that we learn early in diplomacy, Adam--to fight
on ground of your own choice.  It is true that she suggested the
place on this occasion; but by accepting it we make it ours.
Moreover, she will not be able to understand our reason for doing
so, and her own bad conscience--if she has any, bad or good--and her
own fears and doubts will play our game for us.  No, my dear boy,
let us accept, by all means."
<P>
Adam said nothing, but silently held out his hand, which his
companion shook:  no words were necessary.
<P>
When it was getting near tea-time, Mimi asked Sir Nathaniel how they
were going.
<P>
"We must make a point of going in state.  We want all possible
publicity."  Mimi looked at him inquiringly.  "Certainly, my dear,
in the present circumstances publicity is a part of safety.  Do not
be surprised if, whilst we are at Diana's Grove, occasional messages
come for you--for all or any of us."
<P>
"I see!" said Mrs. Salton.  "You are taking no chances."
<P>
"None, my dear.  All I have learned at foreign courts, and amongst
civilised and uncivilised people, is going to be utilised within the
next couple of hours."
<P>
Sir Nathaniel's voice was full of seriousness, and it brought to
Mimi in a convincing way the awful gravity of the occasion
<P>
In due course, they set out in a carriage drawn by a fine pair of
horses, who soon devoured the few miles of their journey.  Before
they came to the gate, Sir Nathaniel turned to Mimi.
<P>
"I have arranged with Adam certain signals which may be necessary if
certain eventualities occur.  These need be nothing to do with you
directly.  But bear in mind that if I ask you or Adam to do
anything, do not lose a second in the doing of it.  We must try to
pass off such moments with an appearance of unconcern.  In all
probability, nothing requiring such care will occur.  The White Worm
will not try force, though she has so much of it to spare.  Whatever
she may attempt to-day, of harm to any of us, will be in the way of
secret plot.  Some other time she may try force, but--if I am able
to judge such a thing--not to-day.  The messengers who may ask for
any of us will not be witnesses only, they may help to stave off
danger."  Seeing query in her face, he went on:  "Of what kind the
danger may be, I know not, and cannot guess.  It will doubtless be
some ordinary circumstance; but none the less dangerous on that
account.  Here we are at the gate.  Now, be careful in all matters,
however small.  To keep your head is half the battle."
<P>
There were a number of men in livery in the hall when they arrived.
The doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and Lady Arabella
came forth and offered them cordial welcome.  This having been got
over, Lady Arabella led them into another room where tea was served.
<P>
Adam was acutely watchful and suspicious of everything, and saw on
the far side of this room a panelled iron door of the same colour
and configuration as the outer door of the room where was the well-
hole wherein Oolanga had disappeared.  Something in the sight
alarmed him, and he quietly stood near the door.  He made no
movement, even of his eyes, but he could see that Sir Nathaniel was
watching him intently, and, he fancied, with approval.
<P>
They all sat near the table spread for tea, Adam still near the
door.  Lady Arabella fanned herself, complaining of heat, and told
one of the footmen to throw all the outer doors open.
<P>
Tea was in progress when Mimi suddenly started up with a look of
fright on her face; at the same moment, the men became cognisant of
a thick smoke which began to spread through the room--a smoke which
made those who experienced it gasp and choke.  The footmen began to
edge uneasily towards the inner door.  Denser and denser grew the
smoke, and more acrid its smell.  Mimi, towards whom the draught
from the open door wafted the smoke, rose up choking, and ran to the
inner door, which she threw open to its fullest extent, disclosing
on the outside a curtain of thin silk, fixed to the doorposts.  The
draught from the open door swayed the thin silk towards her, and in
her fright, she tore down the curtain, which enveloped her from head
to foot.  Then she ran through the still open door, heedless of the
fact that she could not see where she was going.  Adam, followed by
Sir Nathaniel, rushed forward and joined her--Adam catching his wife
by the arm and holding her tight.  It was well that he did so, for
just before her lay the black orifice of the well-hole, which, of
course, she could not see with the silk curtain round her head.  The
floor was extremely slippery; something like thick oil had been
spilled where she had to pass; and close to the edge of the hole her
feet shot from under her, and she stumbled forward towards the well-
hole.
<P>
When Adam saw Mimi slip, he flung himself backward, still holding
her.  His weight told, and he dragged her up from the hole and they
fell together on the floor outside the zone of slipperiness.  In a
moment he had raised her up, and together they rushed out through
the open door into the sunlight, Sir Nathaniel close behind them.
They were all pale except the old diplomatist, who looked both calm
and cool.  It sustained and cheered Adam and his wife to see him
thus master of himself.  Both managed to follow his example, to the
wonderment of the footmen, who saw the three who had just escaped a
terrible danger walking together gaily, as, under the guiding
pressure of Sir Nathaniel's hand, they turned to re-enter the house.
<P>
Lady Arabella, whose face had blanched to a deadly white, now
resumed her ministrations at the tea-board as though nothing unusual
had happened.  The slop-basin was full of half-burned brown paper,
over which tea had been poured.
<P>
Sir Nathaniel had been narrowly observing his hostess, and took the
first opportunity afforded him of whispering to Adam:
<P>
"The real attack is to come--she is too quiet.  When I give my hand
to your wife to lead her out, come with us--and caution her to
hurry.  Don't lose a second, even if you have to make a scene.  Hs-
s-s-h!"
<P>
Then they resumed their places close to the table, and the servants,
in obedience to Lady Arabella's order, brought in fresh tea.
<P>
Thence on, that tea-party seemed to Adam, whose faculties were at
their utmost intensity, like a terrible dream.  As for poor Mimi,
she was so overwrought both with present and future fear, and with
horror at the danger she had escaped, that her faculties were numb.
However, she was braced up for a trial, and she felt assured that
whatever might come she would be able to go through with it.  Sir
Nathaniel seemed just as usual--suave, dignified, and thoughtful--
perfect master of himself.
<P>
To her husband, it was evident that Mimi was ill at ease.  The way
she kept turning her head to look around her, the quick coming and
going of the colour of her face, her hurried breathing, alternating
with periods of suspicious calm, were evidences of mental
perturbation.  To her, the attitude of Lady Arabella seemed
compounded of social sweetness and personal consideration.  It would
be hard to imagine more thoughtful and tender kindness towards an
honoured guest.
<P>
When tea was over and the servants had come to clear away the cups,
Lady Arabella, putting her arm round Mimi's waist, strolled with her
into an adjoining room, where she collected a number of photographs
which were scattered about, and, sitting down beside her guest,
began to show them to her.  While she was doing this, the servants
closed all the doors of the suite of rooms, as well as that which
opened from the room outside--that of the well-hole into the avenue.
Suddenly, without any seeming cause, the light in the room began to
grow dim.  Sir Nathaniel, who was sitting close to Mimi, rose to his
feet, and, crying, "Quick!" caught hold of her hand and began to
drag her from the room.  Adam caught her other hand, and between
them they drew her through the outer door which the servants were
beginning to close.  It was difficult at first to find the way, the
darkness was so great; but to their relief when Adam whistled
shrilly, the carriage and horses, which had been waiting in the
angle of the avenue, dashed up.  Her husband and Sir Nathaniel
lifted--almost threw--Mimi into the carriage.  The postillion plied
whip and spur, and the vehicle, rocking with its speed, swept
through the gate and tore up the road.  Behind them was a hubbub--
servants rushing about, orders being shouted out, doors shutting,
and somewhere, seemingly far back in the house, a strange noise.
Every nerve of the horses was strained as they dashed recklessly
along the road.  The two men held Mimi between them, the arms of
both of them round her as though protectingly.  As they went, there
was a sudden rise in the ground; but the horses, breathing heavily,
dashed up it at racing speed, not slackening their pace when the
hill fell away again, leaving them to hurry along the downgrade.
<P>
It would be foolish to say that neither Adam nor Mimi had any fear
in returning to Doom Tower.  Mimi felt it more keenly than her
husband, whose nerves were harder, and who was more inured to
danger.  Still she bore up bravely, and as usual the effort was
helpful to her.  When once she was in the study in the top of the
turret, she almost forgot the terrors which lay outside in the dark.
She did not attempt to peep out of the window; but Adam did--and saw
nothing.  The moonlight showed all the surrounding country, but
nowhere was to be observed that tremulous line of green light.
<P>
The peaceful night had a good effect on them all; danger, being
unseen, seemed far off.  At times it was hard to realise that it had
ever been.  With courage restored, Adam rose early and walked along
the Brow, seeing no change in the signs of life in Castra Regis.
What he did see, to his wonder and concern, on his returning
homeward, was Lady Arabella, in her tight-fitting white dress and
ermine collar, but without her emeralds; she was emerging from the
gate of Diana's Grove and walking towards the Castle.  Pondering on
this and trying to find some meaning in it, occupied his thoughts
till he joined Mimi and Sir Nathaniel at breakfast.  They began the
meal in silence.  What had been had been, and was known to them all.
Moreover, it was not a pleasant topic.
<P>
A fillip was given to the conversation when Adam told of his seeing
Lady Arabella, on her way to Castra Regis.  They each had something
to say of her, and of what her wishes or intentions were towards
Edgar Caswall.  Mimi spoke bitterly of her in every aspect.  She had
not forgotten--and never would--never could--the occasion when, to
harm Lilla, the woman had consorted even with the nigger.  As a
social matter, she was disgusted with her for following up the rich
landowner--"throwing herself at his head so shamelessly," was how
she expressed it.  She was interested to know that the great kite
still flew from Caswall's tower.  But beyond such matters she did
not try to go.  The only comment she made was of strongly expressed
surprise at her ladyship's "cheek" in ignoring her own criminal
acts, and her impudence in taking it for granted that others had
overlooked them also.
