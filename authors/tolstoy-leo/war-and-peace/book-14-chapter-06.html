<p>After talking for some time with the esaul about next day's
attack, which now, seeing how near they were to the French, he
seemed to have definitely decided on, Denisov turned his horse and
rode back.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, my lad, we'll go and get dwy,&quot; he said to Petya.</p>

<p>As they approached the watchhouse Denisov stopped, peering into
the forest. Among the trees a man with long legs and long, swinging
arms, wearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a Kazan hat, was
approaching with long, light steps. He had a musketoon over his
shoulder and an ax stuck in his girdle. When he espied Denisov he
hastily threw something into the bushes, removed his sodden hat by its
floppy brim, and approached his commander. It was Tikhon. His wrinkled
and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with
self-satisfied merriment. He lifted his head high and gazed at Denisov
as if repressing a laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, where did you disappear to?&quot; inquired Denisov.</p>

<p>&quot;Where did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen,&quot; answered Tikhon
boldly and hurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you push yourself in there by daylight? You ass! Well,
why haven't you taken one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I took one all right,&quot; said Tikhon.</p>

<p>&quot;Where is he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You see, I took him first thing at dawn,&quot; Tikhon continued,
spreading out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes.
&quot;I took him into the forest. Then I see he's no good and think I'll go
and fetch a likelier one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You see?... What a wogue- it's just as I thought,&quot; said Denisov
to the esaul. &quot;Why didn't you bwing that one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What was the good of bringing him?&quot; Tikhon interrupted hastily
and angrily- &quot;that one wouldn't have done for you. As if I don't
know what sort you want!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a bwute you are!... Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I went for another one,&quot; Tikhon continued, &quot;and I crept like this
through the wood and lay down.&quot; (He suddenly lay down on his stomach
with a supple movement to show how he had done it.) &quot;One turned up and
I grabbed him, like this.&quot; (He jumped up quickly and lightly.)
&quot;'Come along to the colonel,' I said. He starts yelling, and
suddenly there were four of them. They rushed at me with their
little swords. So I went for them with my ax, this way: 'What are
you up to?' says I. 'Christ be with you!'&quot; shouted Tikhon, waving
his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the
puddles!&quot; said the esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.</p>

<p>Petya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained
from laughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from Tikhon's face to the
esaul's and Denisov's, unable to make out what it all meant.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't play the fool!&quot; said Denisov, coughing angrily. &quot;Why didn't
you bwing the first one?&quot;</p>

<p>Tikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other,
then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish grin,
disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth (that was why he was called
Shcherbaty- the gap-toothed). Denisov smiled, and Petya burst into a
peal of merry laughter in which Tikhon himself joined.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing,&quot; said Tikhon. &quot;The
clothes on him- poor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your
honor! Why, he says: 'I'm a general's son myself, I won't go!' he
says.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are a bwute!&quot; said Denisov. &quot;I wanted to question...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I questioned him,&quot; said Tikhon. &quot;He said he didn't know much.
'There are a lot of us,' he says, 'but all poor stuff- only soldiers
in name,' he says. 'Shout loud at them,' he says, 'and you'll take
them all,'&quot; Tikhon concluded, looking cheerfully and resolutely into
Denisov's eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll give you a hundwed sharp lashes- that'll teach you to play the
fool!&quot; said Denisov severely.</p>

<p>&quot;But why are you angry?&quot; remonstrated Tikhon, &quot;just as if I'd
never seen your Frenchmen! Only wait till it gets dark and I'll
fetch you any of them you want- three if you like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, let's go,&quot; said Denisov, and rode all the way to the
watchhouse in silence and frowning angrily.</p>

<p>Tikhon followed behind and Petya heard the Cossacks laughing with
him and at him, about some pair of boots he had thrown into the
bushes.</p>

<p>When the fit of laughter that had seized him at Tikhon's words and
smile had passed and Petya realized for a moment that this Tikhon
had killed a man, he felt uneasy. He looked round at the captive
drummer boy and felt a pang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted
only a moment. He felt it necessary to hold his head higher, to
brace himself, and to question the esaul with an air of importance
about tomorrow's undertaking, that he might not be unworthy of the
company in which he found himself.</p>

<p>The officer who had been sent to inquire met Denisov on the way with
the news that Dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him.</p>

<p>Denisov at once cheered up and, calling Petya to him, said: &quot;Well,
tell me about yourself.&quot;</p>
