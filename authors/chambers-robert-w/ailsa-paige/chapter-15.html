<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Toward the end of June, as Claymore's new provisional brigade
of Sykes's division, Fitz John Porter's superb corps d'armee,
neared the designated rendezvous, some particularly dirty veteran
regiments, bivouacked along the fields, crowded to the roadside,
fairly writhing in their scorn and derision.</p>

<p>"Fresh fish!  Oh&mdash;h!  Fresh fi&mdash;sh!" they shouted.  "My God,
boys, just see them pretty red pants!  Mother! Come and look. 
Oh, papa, what are they?  Sa&mdash;ay, would you gentlemen kindly tell
us poor old sodgers what kind ov a hell ov a, dressmaker cut out
them pantalettes?  I wish I could go out to play with these nice,
perlite little boys?  Oh, children! why <em>didn't</em> you bring
your nursemaids with you?"</p>

<p>The 3rd Zouaves marched past the jeering veterans, grinding their
teeth, but making no effort at retort.  They knew well enough
by this time that any attempt to retort would be worse than useless.</p>

<p>As the head of the column of the 8th Lancers appeared from the
West at the forks of the other road, the dingy veterans fairly
danced in malicious delight:</p>

<p>"Excuse us," they simpered, kissing their dirty finger-tips to
the horsemen, "<em>ex</em>-cuse us, please, but do tell us how
you left dear old Fift' Avenoo.  Them rocking hosses need a leetle
new paint where they sit down, me lords.  Hey, you ain't got any
old red silk stockings we can use for guidons, have you?  Oh,
Alonzo darling! curl my hair an' wet me with expensive cologne!"</p>

<p>Colonel Egerton's 20th Dragoons, being in blue and orange, got
off easier, though the freshness of their uniforms was tremendously
resented; but McDunn's 10th Flying Battery, in brand new uniforms,
ran the full fierce fire of chaff; the indignant cannoneers were
begged to disclose the name of the stage line which had supplied
their battery horses; and Arthur Wye, driving the showy swing
team of No. 6, Left Section, shouted back in his penetrating voice:</p>

<p>"If you want to know who sells broken-down nags to suckers, it's
Simon Cameron!&mdash;you Dutch-faced, barrel-bellied, Pennsylvania
scuts!"</p>

<p>A bull-like bellow of laughter burst from the battery; even Captain
McDunn's grin neutralised the scowling visage he turned to conceal
it.  And the fury of the Pennsylvanians knew no bounds; for, from
general to drummer boy, the troops of that great State were horribly
sensitive to any comment on the Hon. Mr. Cameron's horse transactions.</p>

<p>Warren's matchless brigade followed; but the 6th Lancers had
seen service and they were not jeered; nor were the 5th and 10th
Zouaves, the 1st Connecticut Heavy Artillery and the Rhode Island
Battery.</p>

<p>Berkley, riding with his troop, bridle loose in both gauntleted
hands, lance swinging wide from stirrup and elbow loop, looked
to the left and noticed Warren's regiments swinging out across
the breezy uplands.  Half an hour later he saw the 3rd Zouaves
enter a wheat field to the left of the road, form on their colour
front, unsling knapsacks, and stack arms.  McDunn's battery found
a gap in the fence and followed, the guns bumping and bouncing
out over a potato field; and presently Egerton's Dragoons turned
sharply to the right and entered a cool road that ran along a
bushy hollow.</p>

<p>The 8th Lancers kept straight on for five or six hundred yards,
until they encountered their regimental quartermaster and camping
party.  Then they wheeled to the right, passed through a thin
belt of shade trees, across a splendid marl drive and a vast unkempt
lawn.  Beyond this they skirted a typical planter's house of the
better class, with its white galleries, green blinds, quarters,
smoke houses, barns, and outhouses innumerable; and halted, each
troop moving to a point a little in the rear of where its horses
were to be secured, and forming one rank.  The bugles sounded
"Dismount!" Eight hundred sun-burned riders set foot to sod, details
were made to hold the horses, lances were stacked, picket ropes
fixed, shelter tents erected, sabre and bridle hung on the twelve
weapons of the troop-carbineers, and the standard carried to Colonel
Arran's tent.</p>

<p>Directly to the right was a gentle declivity with a clear, rapid
stream splashing the bottom grasses.  Beyond the stream a low
green hill rose, concealing the landscape and the river beyond.</p>

<p>And here, on the breezy meadow slope, Egerton's Dragoons went
into camp and sent out their fatigue parties and grand guards.</p>

<p>Company and squadron streets were laid out, sinks dug, shelter
tents pitched, firewood brought, horses picketed.  Twenty paces
in front of each pile of tents the kitchens were established;
all the regimental cavalry waggons came up promptly and were parked
in the rear of the picket line for sick horses; the belated and
hated sutler of the 8th Lancers drove hastily in, deaf to the
blandishments of veterans along the roadside, who eyed him malevolently
and with every desire to work him substantial harm.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon there was much visiting along the lines
and between distant camps; the day was cloudless and perfect;
magnolia and china-berry scented the winds which furrowed every
grassy hillside; flags fluttered, breezy gusts of bugle music
incited the birds to rivalry.  Peace and sunshine lay over all,
and there was nothing sinister to offend save, far along the horizon,
the low, unbroken monotone of cannon, never louder, never lower,
steady, dull, interminable; and on the southern horizon a single
tall cloud, slanting a trifle to the east, like a silver pillar
out of plumb.</p>

<p>Berkley's attention was directed to it by a suspicious comrade;
they both gazed at it curiously, listening to the low mutter of
the cannonade; then Berkley frowned, folded both gauntlets, placed
them in his belt, passed his hand over his freshly shaven chin,
and, pocketing his cob pipe, sauntered forth to visit and gossip
with those he knew in other camps.</p>

<p>"Hello, Burgess," he said humorously; "how are you making out?"</p>

<p>His late valet's arm twitched instinctively toward the salute
he dared not offer; he glanced stealthily right and left before
answering:</p>

<p>"I am doing very well, sir, thank you."</p>

<p>"I told you to cut out the 'sir,' didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;beg pardon&#11834;"</p>

<p>Berkley eyed him.  "You've got your chance," he said.  "Your
rank and mine are equal.  Do you take pleasure in continually
reminding yourself of your recent position of servitude?"</p>

<p>"Sir?&mdash;beg pardon&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Can't you help it?  Is it born in you?"</p>

<p>Burgess stood silent, considering, then he lifted his ugly face
and looked hard at Berkley.</p>

<p>"I am not ashamed of having served you.  I am more comfortable
under orders. . . .  I liked to dress you up . . .  I wish to
God it was that way now."</p>

<p>"Don't you want your independence?"</p>

<p>"My independence," repeated Burgess, "I had it&mdash;more of it when
I was looking out for you, sir, than I have now in this damn regiment&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, what did you enlist for?"</p>

<p>"You've asked me that many times, sir, and I don't know. . .
.  I'd rather be around, handy like&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You'll get killed some day, don't you know it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir.  I guess you'll look out for me.  You always did."</p>

<p>"How the devil can I prevent one of those big shells from knocking
you off your horse!"</p>

<p>Burgess, patient, undisturbed, let the, question go with a slight
smile.</p>

<p>"What a jackass you are!" said Berkley irritably; "here's a dollar
to get some pie.  And if you can cheat that cursed sutler, do
it!"</p>

<p>He himself purchased two big pies from the sutler after an angry
haggle in which he was easily worsted; and he munched away contentedly
as he walked toward the lines of the 3rd Zouaves, his spurs and
sabre jingling, Burgess following respectfully at heel.</p>

<p>"Hello, Steve!" he called out to a sun-burnt young zouave who
was drying his freshly washed turban in the hill breeze.  "I always
heard you fellows wore infant's underclothes, but I never believed
it before!"</p>

<p>"That's my turban, you idiot!" retorted Stephen, turning red
as several of McDunn's artillerymen began to laugh.  But he came
over and shook hands and accepted a big piece of pie without further
resentment.  "Hello, Burgess," he added.</p>

<p>"How do you do, sir."</p>

<p>"That damned Dutch sutler of ours," commented Berkley, "puts
clay in his pie-erust.  We'll certainly have to fix him before
long. How are you, Steve, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Both socks full of tallow; otherwise I'm feeling fine," said
the boy.  "Did you hear those dirty Bucktail veterans back there
poking fun at us?  Well, we never answer 'em nowadays; but the
Zouaves are getting fearfully sick of it; and if we don't go into
battle pretty soon there'll be a private war on&mdash;" he winked&mdash;"with
those Pennsylvanians, you bet.  And I guess the Lancers will be
in it, too."</p>

<p>Berkley cast an evil eye on a pair of Pennsylvania soldiers who
had come to see how the Zou-zous made camp; then he shrugged his
shoulders, watching Burgess, who had started away to roam hungrily
around the sutler's camp again.</p>

<p>"After all," he said, "these veterans have a right to jeer at
us. They've seen war; and now they know whether they'll fight
or run away.  It's more than we know, so far."</p>

<p>"Well, I tell you," said Stephen candidly, "there's no chance
of my running away.  A fellow can't skedaddle when his father's
looking at him.  Besides, Phil, I don't know how it is, but I'm
not very much afraid, not as much as I thought I'd be."</p>

<p>Berkley looked at him curiously.  "Have you been much under fire?"</p>

<p>"Only that affair at the Blue Bridge&mdash;you know yourself how it
was. After the first shell had made me rather sick at my stomach
I was all right&mdash;except that I hated to see father sitting up
there on his horse while we were all lying snug in the wheat.
. . .  How did you feel when the big shells came over?"</p>

<p>"Bad," said Berkley briefly.</p>

<p>"Sick?"</p>

<p>"Worse."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you should feel queer, Phil&mdash;after that bully
thing you did with the escort&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" cut in Berkley savagely, "I'm sick of hearing about
it. If you all knew that I was too scared to realise what I was
doing you'd let up on that episode."</p>

<p>Stephen laughed.  "I hope our boys get scared in the same way.
. . .  Hello, here's a friend of yours I believe&#11834;"</p>

<p>They turned to encounter Casson, the big dragoon, arm in arm
with the artilleryman, Arthur Wye.</p>

<p>"Give us some pie, you son of a gun!" they suggested unceremoniously;
and when supplied and munching, they all locked arms and strolled
out across the grass toward the hill, where already, dark against
the blinding blue, hundreds of idle soldiers had gathered to sit
on the turf and stare at the tall cloud on the horizon, or watch
the signal officer on the higher hill beyond, seated at his telescope,
while, beside him, a soldier swung dirty square flags in the wind,</p>

<p>As they arrived on the crest a quick exclamation escaped them;
for there, beyond, mile on mile, lay the armed host of which their
regiments were tiny portions.</p>

<p>"Lord!" said Stephen in a low, surprised voice, "did you fellows
know that the whole army was near here?"</p>

<p>"Not I," said Berkley, gazing spellbound out across the rolling
panorama of river, swamp, woods, and fields.  "I don't believe
it occurs very often, either&mdash;the chance to see an entire army
all at once, encamped right at your feet.  What a lot of people
and animals!"</p>

<p>They sat down, cross-legged, enjoying their pie, eyes wandering
wonderingly over the magic landscape.  Here and there a marquee
marked some general's headquarters, but except for these there
were no tents save shelter tents in sight, and not so many of
these, because many divisions had bivouacked, and others were
in cantonments where the white cupola of some house glimmered,
or the thin spire of a church pierced green trees.</p>

<p>Here and there they noted and pointed out to each other roads
over which cavalry moved or long waggon trains crept.  Down along
the swamps that edged the river they could see soldiers building
corduroy, repairing bridges, digging ditches, and, in one spot,
erecting a fort.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," said Casson, whose regiment, dismounted, had served
muddy apprenticeship along the York River, "if they're going to
begin that kind of thing again I'd rather be at home laying gas
pipes on Broadway!"</p>

<p>"What kind of thing?" demanded Stephen.</p>

<p>"That road making, swamp digging&mdash;all that fixing up forts for
big guns that nobody has a chance to fire because the Johnnies
get out just when everything's ready to blow 'em into the Union
again. <em>A&mdash;</em>h!" he added in disgust, "didn't we have a
dose of that at Yorktown and Williamsburg?  Why doesn't Little
Mac start us hell-bent for Richmond and let us catch 'em on the
jump?"</p>

<p>For a while, their mouths full of pie, the soldiers, with the
exception of Berkley, criticised their commander-in-chief, freely&mdash;their
corps commanders, and every officer down to their particular corporals. 
That lasted for ten minutes.  Then one and all began comparing
these same maligned officers most favourably with other officers
of other corps; and they ended, as usual, by endorsing their commander-in-chief
with enthusiasm, and by praising every officer under whom they
served.</p>

<p>Then they boasted of their individual regiments&mdash;all except Berkley&mdash;extolling
their discipline, their marching, their foraging efficiency, their
martyr-like endurance.</p>

<p>"What's your Colonel like, anyway?" inquired Casson, turning
to Berkley.</p>

<p>"He's a good officer," said the latter indifferently.</p>

<p>"Do you like him?"</p>

<p>"He has&mdash;merit."</p>

<p>"Jerusalem!" laughed Wye, "if that isn't a kick in the seat of
his pants!"</p>

<p>Berkley reddened.  "You're mistaken, Arthur."</p>

<p>"Didn't you tell me at Alexandria that you hated him?"</p>

<p>"I said that&mdash;yes.  I was disappointed because the Westchester
Horse was not attached to John Casson's regiment. . . .  I don't&mdash;dislike
Colonel Arran."</p>

<p>Berkley was still red; he lay in the grass on his stomach, watching
the big cloud pile on the horizon.</p>

<p>"You know," said Casson, "that part of our army stretches as
far as that smoke.  We're the rear-guard."</p>

<p>"Listen to the guns," said Wye, pretending technical familiarity
even at that distance.  "They're big fellows&mdash;those Dahlgrens
and Columbiads&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, bosh!" snapped Casson, "you can't tell a howitzer from a
rocket!"</p>

<p>Wye sat up, thoroughly offended.  "To prove <em>your</em> dense
ignorance, you yellow-bellied dragoon, let me ask you a simple
question: When a shell is fired toward you <em>can</em> you see
it coming?"</p>

<p>"Certainly.  Didn't we see the big shells at Yorktown&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Wait!  When a solid shot is fired, can you see it when it is
coming toward you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No you can't, you ignoramus! You can see a shell coming or going;
you can see a solid shot going&mdash;never coming from the enemy's
guns. Aw! go soak that bull head of yours and wear a lady-like
havelock!"</p>

<p>The bickering discussion became general for a moment, then, still
disputing, Casson and Wye walked off toward camp, and Stephen
and Berkley followed.</p>

<p>"Have you heard from your mother?" asked the latter, as they
sauntered along over the grass.</p>

<p>"Yes, twice.  Father was worried half to death because she hadn't
yet left Paigecourt.  Isn't it strange, Phil, that after all we're
so near mother's old home?  And father was all against her going,
I tell you, I'm worried."</p>

<p>"She has probably gone by this time," observed Berkley.</p>

<p>The boy nodded doubtfully; then: "I had a fine letter from Ailsa.
She sent me twenty dollars," he added naively, "but our sutler
has got it all."</p>

<p>"What did Ailsa say?" asked Berkley casually.</p>

<p>"Oh, she enquired about father and me&mdash;and you, too, I believe.
Oh, yes; she wanted me to say to you that she was well&#11834;and so
is that other girl&mdash;what's her name?"</p>

<p>"Letty Lynden?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes &mdash;Letty Lynden.  They're in a horrible kind of
a temporary hospital down on the York River along with the Sisters
of Charity; and she said she had just received orders to pack
up and start west with the ambulances."</p>

<p>"West?"</p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>After a silence Berkley said:</p>

<p>"I heard from her yesterday."</p>

<p>"You did!"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Unless your father already knows, it might be well to
say to him that Ailsa's ambulance train is ordered to rendezvous
in the rear of the 5th Provisional Corps head-quarters."</p>

<p>"Our corps!"</p>

<p>"That looks like it, doesn't it?  The 5th Provisional Corps is
Porter's."  He turned and looked back, out across the country.</p>

<p>"She may be somewhere out yonder, at this very moment, Steve."
He made a vague gesture toward the west, stood looking for a while,
then turned and walked slowly on with head lowered.</p>

<p>"I wish my mother and Ailsa were back in New York," said the
boy fretfully.  "I don't see why the whole family should get into
hot water at the same time."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't surprise me very much if Ailsa's ambulance landed
beside your mother's door at Paigecourt," said Berkley.  "The
head-quarters of the 5th Corps cannot be very far from Paigecourt."
At the cavalry lines he offered his hand to Stephen in farewell.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said the boy.  "I wish you the luck of the 6th Lancers.
Since Hanover Court-House nobody calls 'em 'fresh fish'&mdash;just
because they charged a few Johnnies with the lance and took a
few prisoners and lost thirty horses."</p>

<p>Berkley laughed.  "Thanks; and I wish you the luck of the 5th
Zouaves.  They're into everything, I hear, particularly hen-coops
and pigpens.  Casson says they live high in the 5th Zouaves. .
. Good-bye, old fellow . . .  will you remember me to your father?"</p>

<p>"I will when he lets me talk to him," grinned Stephen.  "We're
a disciplined regiment &mdash;I found that out right away&mdash;and
there's nothing soft for me to expect just because my father is
colonel and Josiah Lent happens to be major."</p>

<p>The regimental bands played the next day; the distant cannonade
had ceased; sunshine fell from a cloudless sky, and the army watched
a military balloon, the "Intrepid," high glistening above the
river, its cables trailing in gracious curves earthward.</p>

<p>Porter's 5th Corps now formed the rear-guard of the army; entire
regiments went on picket, even the two regiments of Lancers took
their turn, though not armed for that duty.  During the day there
had been some unusually brisk firing along the river, near enough
to cause regiments that had never been under fire to prick up
a thousand pairs of ears and listen.  As the day lengthened toward
evening, picket firing became incessant, and the occasional solid
report of a cannon from the shore opposite disclosed the presence
of Confederate batteries, the nearness of which surprised many
an untried soldier.</p>

<p>Toward sundown Berkley saw a business-like cavalry officer ride
into camp with an escort of the 5th Regulars.  Men around him
said that the officer was General Philip St. George Cooke, and
that the chances were that the regiments of the reserve were going
into action pretty soon.</p>

<p>About 3 o'clock the next morning boots and saddles sounded from
the head-quarters of the Cavalry Reserve brigade and the 5th and
6th United States Cavalry, followed by Colonel Rush's Lancers,
rode out of their camp grounds and were presently followed by
the 1st United States and a squadron of Pennsylvania carbineers.</p>

<p>The troopers of the 8th Lancers watched them ride away in the
dawn; but mo orders came to follow them, and, discontented, muttering,
they went sullenly about their duties, wondering why they, also,
had not been called on.</p>

<p>That nobody had caught the great Confederate cavalryman did not
console them; they had to listen to the jeers of the infantry,
blaming them for Stuart's great raid around the entire Union army;
in sickening reiteration came the question: "Who ever saw a dead
cavalryman?"  And, besides, one morning in a road near camp, some
of the 8th Lancers heard comments from a group of general officers
which were not at all flattering to their own cavalry.</p>

<p>"You see," said a burly colonel of engineers, "that this army
doesn't know what real cavalry looks like&mdash;except when it gets
a glimpse of Jeb Stuart's command."</p>

<p>An infantry colonel coincided with him, profanely:</p>

<p>"That damned rebel cavalry chases ours with a regularity and
persistence that makes me ill.  Did the world ever see the like
of it?  You send out one of our mounted regiments to look for
a mounted rebel regiment, and the moment it finds what it's lookin'
for the rebs give a pleased sort of yell, and ours turn tail.
Because it's become a habit: that's why our cavalry runs!  And
then the fun begins!  Lord God Almighty! what's the matter with
our cavalry?"</p>

<p>"You can't make cavalry in a few months," observed a colonel
of heavy artillery, stretching his fat, scarlet-striped legs in
his stirrups.  "What do you expect?  Every man, woman, and child
south of Mason and Dixon's Line knows how to ride.  The Southerners
are born horsemen.  We in the North are not.  That's the difference.
We've got to learn to be.  Take a raw soldier and send him forth
mounted on an animal with which he has only a most formal acquaintance,
and his terrors are increased twofold.  When you give him a sabre,
pistol, and carbine, to take care of when he has all he can do
to take care of himself, those terrors increase in proportion. 
<em>Then</em> show him the enemy and send him into battle&mdash;and
what is the result?  Skedaddle!</p>

<p>"Don't make any mistake; we haven't any cavalry yet.  Some day
we will, when our men learn to ride faster than a walk."</p>

<p>"God!" muttered a brigadier-general under his white moustache;
"it's been a bitter pill to swallow&mdash;this raid around our entire
army by fifteen hundred of Jeb Stuart's riders and two iron guns!"</p>

<p>The half dozen lancers, lying on their bellies in the grass on
the bank above the road where this discussion took place remained
crimson, mute, paralysed with mortification.  Was <em>that</em>
what the army thought of them?</p>

<p>But they had little time for nursing their mortification that
morning; the firing along the river was breaking out in patches
with a viciousness and volume heretofore unheard; and a six-gun
Confederate field battery had joined in, arousing the entire camp
of Claymore's brigade.  Louder and louder grew the uproar along
the river; smoke rose and took silvery-edged shape in the sunshine;
bugles were calling to the colours regiments encamped on the right;
a light battery trotted out across a distant meadow, unlimbered
and went smartly into action.</p>

<p>About noon the bugles summoned the 3rd Zouaves.  As they were
forming, the camps of the 8th Lancers and the 10th Light Battery
rang with bugle music.  Berkley, standing to horse, saw the Zouaves
leaving the hill at a jog-trot, their red legs twinkling; but
half way down the slope they were halted to dress ranks; and the
Lancers, cantering ahead, turned westward and moved off along
the edge of the river swamp toward the piled-up cloud of smoke
down stream.</p>

<p>After them trotted the 10th New York Flying Battery as though
on parade, their guidons standing straight out behind the red-and-white
guidons of the Lancers.</p>

<p>The Zouaves had now reached wet land, where a staff officer met
Colonel Craig and piloted him through a field of brush and wild
grass, and under the parapets of an emplacement for big guns,
on which men were nonchalantly working, to the beginning of a
newly laid road of logs.  The noise of musketry and the smoke
had become prodigious.  On the logs of the road lay the first
big pool of blood that many of them had ever seen.  What it had
come from they could not determine; there was nothing dead or
dying there.</p>

<p>The men glanced askance at the swamp where the black shining
water had risen almost level with the edges of the road; but the
Colonel and his staff, still mounted, rode coolly over it, and
the regiment followed.</p>

<p>The corduroy road through the heavily wooded swamp which the
3rd Zouaves now followed was the only inlet to the noisy scene
of local action, and the only outlet, too.</p>

<p>Except for watching the shells at Blue Bridge, the regiment had
never been in battle, had never seen or heard a real battle; many
had never even seen a wounded man.  They understood that they
were going into battle now; and now the regiment caught sight
of its first wounded men.  Stretchers passed close to them on
which soldiers lay naked to the waist, some with breasts glistening
red and wet from unstopped haemorrhage, some with white bodies
marked only by the little round blue hole with its darker centre.
Soldiers passed them, limping, bloody rags dripping from thigh
or knee; others staggered along with faces the colour of clay,
leaning on the arms of comrades, still others were carried out
feet first, sagging, a dead-weight in the arms of those who bore
them.  One man with half his fingers gone, the raw stumps spread,
hurried out, screaming, and scattering blood as he ran.</p>

<p>The regiment passed an artilleryman lying in the water whose
head, except for the lower jaw, was entirely missing; and another
on his back in the ooze whose bowels were protruding between his
fingers; and he was trying very feebly to force them back, while
two comrades strove in vain to lift him.</p>

<p>The regiment sickened as it looked; here and there a young zouave
turned deathly pale, reeled out of the ranks, leaned against a
tree, nauseated, only to lurch forward again at the summons of
the provost guard; here and there a soldier disengaged his white
turban from his fez and dropped it to form a sort of Havelock;
for the vertical sun was turning the men dizzy, and the sights
they saw were rapidly unnerving them.</p>

<p>They heard the tremendous thunder and felt the concussion of
big guns; the steady raining rattle of musketry, the bark of howitzers,
the sharp, clean crack of rifled field guns dismayed them. Sometimes,
far away, they could distinguish the full deep cheering of a Union
regiment; and once they caught the distant treble battle cry of
the South.  There were moments when a sudden lull in the noise
startled the entire regiment.  Even their officers looked up sharply
at such times.  But ahead they could still see Colonel Craig riding
calmly forward, his big horse picking its leisurely way over the
endless road of logs; they could see the clipped gray head of
Major Lent under its red forage-cap, steady, immovable, as he
controlled his nervous mount with practised indifference.</p>

<p>It was broiling hot in the swamp; the Zouaves stood bathed in
perspiration as the regiment halted for a few minutes, then they
moved forward again toward a hard ridge of grass which glimmered
green beyond the tangled thicket's edges.</p>

<p>Here the regiment was formed in line of battle, and ordered to
lie down.</p>

<p>Stephen wiped his sweaty hands on his jacket and, lifting his
head from the grass, looked cautiously around.  Already there
had been fighting here; a section of a dismantled battery stood
in the road ahead; dead men lay around it; smoke still hung blue
in the woods. The air reeked.</p>

<p>The Zouaves lay in long scarlet rows on the grass; their officers
stood leaning on their naked swords, peering ahead where the Colonel,
Major, and a mounted bugler were intently watching something&mdash;the
two officers using field glasses.  In a few moments both officers
dismounted, flung their bridles to an orderly, and came back,
walking rather quickly.  Major Lent drawing his bright, heavy
sword and tucking up his gold-embroidered sleeves as he came on.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Colonel Craig cheerfully, "we are going in. 
All you've got to do can be done quickly and thoroughly with the
bayonet.  Don't cock your muskets, don't fire unless you're told
to.  Perhaps you won't have to fire at all.  All I want of you
is to keep straight on after me&mdash;right through those dry woods,
there. Try to keep your intervals and alignment; don't yell until
you sight the enemy, don't lose your heads, trust your officers. 
Where they go you are safest."</p>

<p>He dropped his eye-glasses into his slashed pocket, drew out
and put on a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles.  The soldiers saw
him smile and say something to Major Lent, saw him bare his handsome
sword, saw the buglers setting the shining bugles to their lips.</p>

<p>"Now, <em>charge</em>, you red-legged rascals!" shouted Major
Lent; and up from the grass rose a wave of scarlet and flashing
steel.</p>

<p>Charge! Charge! echoed the bugles; a wailing storm, high among
the tree tops, passed over them as they entered the dry woods
on a run; branches crashed earthward, twig's and limbs crackled
down in whirling confusion.  But there was nothing in the woods
except smoke&mdash;and the streaming storm shrilling overhead, raining
down on them leaves and boughs and splintered sticks.</p>

<p>The belt of woodland was very narrow; already the men could see
sunlight on the farther edge, and catch glimpses of fields; and
still they ran forward, keeping their alignment as best they might
among the trees; and came, very soon, to the wood's edge.  Here
they were halted and ordered to lie down again; and they lay there,
close to the ground among the dead leaves, while from above living
leaves rained on them in never-ending showers, and the wild tempest
sped overhead unchecked.</p>

<p>Far out across the fields in the sunshine, looking diminutive
as toys in the distance, four cannon puffed smoke toward them. 
The Zouaves could see the guns&mdash;see even the limbers and caissons
behind, and the harnessed teams, and the cannoneers very busily
at work in the sunshine.  Then a long low wall of white smoke
suddenly appeared along a rail fence in front of the guns, and
at the same time the air thickened with bullets storming in all
about them.</p>

<p>The Colonel and the Major had run hastily out into the field. 
"Get up! Get up!" shouted the company officers.  "Left dress,
there! Forward!  Don't cock your rifles; don't fire until you're
told to. Steady there on the left.  Forward!  Forward!"</p>

<p>"Now yell, you red-legs!  Yell!"</p>

<p>As they started running, their regimental colours fell, man and
nag sprawling in the grass; and the entire line halted, bewildered.
The next instant a zouave had lifted the colours, and was running
forward; and: "Get on there!  Continue the movement!  What in
hell's the matter with you Zouaves!" shouted their lieutenant-colonel. 
And the sagging scarlet line bellied out, straightened as the
flanks caught up, and swept out into the sunshine with a cheer&mdash;the
peculiar Zouave cheer&mdash;not very full yet, for they had not yet
lost the troubled wonder of things.</p>

<p>Stephen, running with shouldered musket, saw close ahead a long
line of blue smoke and flame, but instead of the enemy there was
nothing hidden behind the smoke except a long field-ditch in which
dry brush was burning.</p>

<p>Into the ditch tumbled the regiment, and lay panting, coughing,
kicking out the embers, and hugging the ground closely, because
now the storm that had swept the tree tops was shaving the weeds
and grass around them; and the drone of bullets streaming over
the ditch rose to a loud, fierce whine.</p>

<p>Up in the blue sky little white clouds suddenly unfolded themselves
with light reports, and disappeared, leaving jagged streamers
of vapour afloat here and there; the near jarring discharge of
artillery shook the ground till bits of sod fell in particles,
crumbling from the ditch's edge; the outrageous racket of musketry
never slackened.</p>

<p>Lying there, they heard a sudden burst of cheering, and far to
the left saw another regiment come tumbling into the ditch and
crouch, huddled there in a blue line stretching as far away as
they could see.  And again the firing increased to a stunning
roar, and there were more cheers; and, to their right, another
regiment came running and rolling into the ditch.</p>

<p>Officers, recklessly erect, stood here and there along the interior
of the ditch; then from the lair of each regiment flags emerged,
bugles blew clear and impatient; there came an upheaval of bayonets,
and the three regiments scrambled to their feet, over the ditch's
edge, and surged forward into the sunshine.</p>

<p>Across the fields Stephen saw guns being limbered up; and drivers
lashing their horses to a gallop across a bridge.  The regiment
on their left was firing by wings as it advanced, the regiment
on the right had broken into a heavy run, yelling: "Hey!  We want
them guns!  Wait a second, will yer?  Where you takin' them guns
to?"</p>

<p>There was a new rail fence close in front of the Zouaves, barring
their way to the bridge; and suddenly, from behind it, men arose
with levelled muskets; and the Zouaves dropped flat to the volley
that buried the fence in smoke.</p>

<p>"Now, boys!" cried Colonel Craig, "we've got to have that bridge!
So we'll finish this business right here with the bayonet.  Come
on and let's end it <em>now</em>!"</p>

<p>Major Lent ran forward and started to climb the smoky fence;
everywhere the Zouaves were swarming along the newly split rails
or driving their bayonets through the smoke at the gray phantoms
clustering behind.  Shots rang out, the crack of stock against
stock, the ringing clamour and click of steel filled the air.</p>

<p>The zouave next to Stephen lurched up against him spouting blood
from the neck; on the other side of him another, a sergeant, too,
had gone stark mad, apparently, and was swinging his terrible
sabre bayonet without regard to friend or foe; and still another
man of his squad, swearing horridly, had clutched a ghostly enemy
in the smoke across the fence and was trying to strangle him with
his bare hands.</p>

<p>Stephen, bewildered by a blow which glanced from his head to
his left shoulder, clung to his musket and tried to stagger forward,
but a bayonet seared his right temple, tearing the scalp and letting
down a rush of blood all over his face and eyes.   Blinded, the
boy called instinctively: "Father!  I'm hurt!  Could you help
me!"</p>

<p>Colonel Craig turned white under his tan, and looked back.</p>

<p>"I can't help you, my boy.  Sergeant, will you look after my
son?" And he ran forward into the infernal network of bayonets,
calling out: "Get through there, boys.  We might as well clean
up this mess while we're about it.  Pull down that fence!  Never
mind those men behind it!&mdash;rush it!  Kick it over!  Now come on! 
I don't ask you to do anything that I don't do.  Major Lent and
I will take you through.  Come on and take that bridge!"</p>

<p>A captain, fighting back the bayonets with his sword, suddenly
floundered to the fence top and clung, balanced on his belly,
shouting hysterically:</p>

<p>"Look at the Lancers!  Look at 'em coming!  Now, Zouaves!  Pull
down the fence and give them a chance to charge the bridge!"</p>

<p>Over a low swell of land some horsemen trotted into view; behind
them the horizon was suddenly filled with the swimming scarlet
pennons of the Lancers.  A thousand horses' heads shot up against
the sky line, manes tossing; a thousand lance points fell to a
glittering level.</p>

<p>They were cheering shrilly as they came on; the Zouaves heard
them, the gray infantry regiment gave way, turned, filed off,
retreating toward the bridge at a slow trot like some baffled
but dangerous animal; and after it ran the Zouaves, firing, screaming,
maddened to hysteria by their first engagement, until their panting
officers and their bugles together barely managed to halt them
short of the edges of utter annihilation just as a full Confederate
brigade rose grimly from the wood's edge across the stream, ready
to end their hysterical yelling for ever.</p>

<p>Stephen, sitting on the grass among the dead and stricken, tied
his bloody turban, pulled the red fez close over it, smeared the
blood from his eyes, and, clutching his musket, stood up unsteadily.</p>

<p>He could see the charge of the 8th Lancers&mdash;see the horsemen
wheel and veer wildly as they received the fire of the Confederate
troops from the woods across the stream, squadron after squadron
sheering off at a gallop and driving past the infantry, pell-mell,
a wild riot of maddened horses, yelling riders, and streaming
scarlet pennons descending in one vivid, headlong torrent to the
bridge. But the structure was already hopelessly afire; and the
baffled carbineers of the advance reined up at the edge of the
burning timbers and sent an angry volley after the gray infantry
now jogging back into the woods beyond.  Then, suddenly, the Zouaves
heard the Lancers cheering wildly in the smoke of the burning
structure, but did not know what it meant.</p>

<p>It meant &mdash;Berkley.</p>

<p>Fear had squired him that day.  When the bugles sounded through
the cannon thunder and his squadron trotted out, Fear, on a paler
horse than Death bestrides, cantered with him, knee to knee. 
Fear's startled eyes looked into his through the jetted smoke
of musketry, through the tumult of the horses and the trumpets;
Fear made his voice light and thin, so that he scarcely heard
it amid the fierce cheering of his comrades, the pounding of hoofs,
the futile clattering of equipments.</p>

<p>It was all a swift and terrible nightmare to him&mdash;the squadrons
breaking into a gallop, the woods suddenly belted with smoke,
the thud and thwack of bullets pelting leather and living flesh,
the frantic plunging of stricken horses, the lightning down-crash
of riders hurled earthward at full speed, the brief glimpses of
scarlet streaks under foot&mdash;of a horse's belly and agonised iron-shod
feet, of a white face battered instantly into obliteration, of
the ruddy smoke flowing with sparks amid which bugles rang above
the clashing halt of maddened squadrons.</p>

<p>Then, through the rolling ocean of smoke, he saw officers and
men trying to hack away and beat out the burning timbers&mdash;saw
a reckless carbineer&mdash;his own tent-mate&mdash;dismount and run out
across the planking which was already afire, saw him stumble and
roll over as a bullet hit him, get to his knees blindly, trip
and fall flat in the smoke.  Then Fear bellowed in Berkley's ear;
but he had already clapped spurs to his horse, cantering out across
the burning planking and straight into the smoke pall.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Burgess?" he shouted.  The Fear of Death stiffened
his lips as he reined up in the whirling spark-shot obscurity.
"Burgess&mdash;damn you&mdash;answer me, can't you!" he stammered, half
strangled in the smoke, trying to master his terrified mount with
rein and knee and heel.</p>

<p>Vaguely he heard comrades shouting for him to come back, heard
shells exploding amid the smoke, wheeled his staggering horse,
bent swiftly and grasped at an inanimate form in the smoke, missed,
dismounted and clutched the senseless carbineer&mdash;his comrade&mdash;and
once his valet.</p>

<p>Out of the fiery tunnel came tearing his terrified horse, riderless;
out of the billowing, ruddy vapours reeled Berkley, dragging the
carbineer.</p>

<p>It was the regiment cheering him that the Zouaves heard.</p>

<p>The fields were now swimming in bluish smoke; through it the
Zouaves were reforming as they marched.  Little heaps of brilliant
colour dotting the meadow were being lifted and carried off the
field by comrades; a few dismounted carbineers ran hither and
thither, shooting hopelessly crippled horses.  Here and there
a dead lancer lay flat in the grass, his scarlet pennon a vivid
spot beside him.</p>

<p>The hill road to the burning bridge was now choked with Colonel
Arran's regiment, returning to the crest of the hill; through
the blackish and rolling smoke from the bridge infantry were creeping
swiftly forward toward the river bank, and very soon the intermittent
picket firing began again, running up and down the creek bank
and out across the swamp lands, noisily increasing as it woke
up vicious volleys from the woods on the opposite bank, and finally
aroused the cannon to thunderous anger.</p>

<p>Berkley, standing to horse with his regiment on the sparsely
wooded hill crest, could see the crowding convolutions of smoke
rising from the thickets, as each gun spoke from the Confederate
batteries.  But to him their thunder was like the thunder in a
dream.</p>

<p>Hour after hour the regiment stood to horse; hour after hour
the battle roared west and south of them.  An irregular cloud,
slender at the base, spreading on top, towered to mid zenith above
the forest.  Otherwise, save for the fleecy explosion of shells
in the quivering blue vault above, nothing troubled the sunshine
that lay over hill and valley, wood and river and meadowland.</p>

<p>McDunn's battery was not firing; the Zouaves lay dozing awake
in the young clover, the Lancers, standing to horse, looked out
across the world of trees and saw nothing stirring save a bird
or two winging hastily northward.</p>

<p>Berkley could distinguish a portion of the road that ran down
to the burning bridge, where part of McDunn's battery was in position.
Across the hills to the left a scarlet windrow undulating on either
flank of the battery marked the line of battle where the Zouaves
lay in a clover-field, within supporting distance of the guns.</p>

<p>Except for these, and a glimpse of Lowe's balloon overhead, Berkley
could not see anything whatever even remotely connected with the
uproar which continued steadily in the west and south.  Nobody
seemed to know whose troops were engaged, where they came from,
whither they were trying to force a fiery road through a land
in arms against their progress.</p>

<p>At times, to Berkley, it seemed as though every tree, every hill,
every thicket was watching him with sombre intent; as if Nature
herself were hostile, stealthy, sinister, screening terrors yet
unloosed, silently storing up violence in dim woods, aiding and
abetting ambush with all her clustering foliage; and that every
river, every swamp, every sunny vista concealed some hidden path
to death.</p>

<p>He stood rigid at his horse's head, lance in hand, dirty, smoke-blackened,
his ears deafened by the cannonade, his eyes cool and alert, warily
scanning hill and hollow and thicket.</p>

<p>Dead men of his regiment were borne past him; he glanced furtively
at them, not yet certain that the lower form of fear had left
him, not yet quite realising that he had blundered into manhood&mdash;that
for the first time in his life he was ready to take his chance
with life.</p>

<p>But, little by little, as the hours passed, there in the trodden
grass he began to understand something of the unformulated decision
that had been slowly growing in him&mdash;of the determination, taking
shape, to deal more nobly with himself&mdash;with this harmless self
which had accepted unworthiness and all its attributes, and which
riven pride would have flung back at the civilisation which branded
him as base.</p>

<p>It came&mdash;this knowledge&mdash;like a slowly increasing flare of light;
and at last he said under his breath, to himself:</p>

<p>"Nothing is unworthily born that is born of God's own law.  I
have been what I chose.  I can be what I will."</p>

<p>A gracious phantom grew under his eyes taking exquisite shape
before him; and dim-eyed, he stared at it till it dwindled, faded,
dissolved into empty air and sunshine.</p>

<p>No; he could never marry without revealing what he was; and that
he would never do because of loyalty to that tender ghost which
he must shield for ever even as he would have shielded her in
life.</p>

<p>No living soul had any right to know.  No love of his for any
woman could ever justify betrayal of what alone concerned the
dead.</p>

<p>The shells, which, short fused, had been bursting high above
the swamp to the right, suddenly began to fall nearer the cavalry,
and after a while a shell exploded among them, killing a horse.</p>

<p>They retired by squadrons, leisurely, and in good order; but
the shells followed them, searching them out and now and then
finding them with a deafening racket and cloud of smoke, out of
which mangled horses reared, staggered, and rolled over screaming;
out of which a rider, here and there was hurled sideways, head
first, or sent spinning and headless among his white-faced comrades.</p>

<p>McDunn's guns had opened now, attempting to extinguish the fire
of the troublesome Confederate battery.  Berkley, teeth set, pallid,
kept his place in the ranks, and hung to his horse's head until
he got the animal calmed again.  One of his sleeves was covered
with blood from a comrade's horse, blown into fragments beside
him.</p>

<p>He could see McDunn's gunners working methodically amid the vapours
steaming back from the battery as it fired by sections; saw the
guns jump, buried in smoke; saw the long flames flicker, flicker,
flicker through the cannon mist; felt the solid air strike him
in the face at each discharge.</p>

<p>Hallam, white as a sheet, stood motionless at the head of his
troop; a shell had just burst, but it was as though he dared not
look back until Colonel Arran rode slowly over to the stricken
company&mdash;and saw Berkley still standing at his horse's head, and
gave him a look that the younger man never forgot.</p>

<p>Again, by troops, the Lancers retired; and again the yelling
shells found them, and they retired to the base of a hill.  And
came upon a division in full panic.</p>

<p>Over a culvert and down a wooded road troops of all arms were
riotously retreating, cavalry, baggage-waggons, battered fragments
of infantry regiments, ambulances, all mixed and huddled pell-mell
into a headlong retreat that stretched to the rear as far as the
eye could see.</p>

<p>Astonished, the Lancers looked on, not understanding, fearful
of some tremendous disaster.  A regiment of regular cavalry of
the Provost Guard was riding through the fugitives, turning, checking,
cutting out, driving, separating the disorganised mob; but it
was hard work, and many got away, and teamsters began to cut traces,
and skulking cavalrymen clapped spurs and rode over screeching
deserters who blocked their path.  It was a squalid sight; the
Lancers looked on appalled.</p>

<p>Colonel Arran rode his horse slowly along the front of his regiment,
talking quietly to his men.</p>

<p>"It's only one or two of the raw brigades and a few teamsters
and frightened sutlers&mdash;that's all.  Better that the Provost Guard
should let them through; better to sift out that kind of soldier."
. . .  He calmly turned his horse's head and rode back along the
lines of horses and dismounted troopers, commenting reassuringly
on what was taking place around them.</p>

<p>"There is never any safety in running away unless your officers
order you to run.  The discipline of a regiment is the only security
for the individual.  There is every chance of safety as long as
a regiment holds together; no chance at all if it disintegrates.</p>

<p>"The regulars understand that; it is what makes them formidable;
it is what preserves them individually, and every man knows it. 
The regulars don't run; it happens to be contrary to their traditions;
but those traditions originated less in sentiment than in plain
common-sense."</p>

<p>He turned his horse and walked the animal slowly along the lines.</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly gratified by the conduct of this regiment,"
he said.  "You have done all that has been asked of you.  To do
more than is asked of you is not commendable in a soldier, though
it may display individual courage. . . .  The carbineer, Burgess,
10th troop, Captain Hallam, was foolhardy to attempt the bridge
without orders. . . .  The lancer, Ormond, 10th troop, Captain
Hallam, however, did his full duty&mdash;admirably&mdash;when he faced death
to rescue a wounded comrade from the flames. . . .  In England
a Victoria Cross is given for deeds of this kind.  The regiment
respects him&mdash;and respects itself. . . .  I care to believe that
there is not one officer or trooper in my command who is not ready
to lay down his life for a friend. . . .  I am happy in the consciousness
that it is not courage which is lacking in this command; it is
only experience.  And that will come; it came with the shells
on the slope yonder.  There is no more severe test of a regiment's
discipline than to endure the enemy's fire without being able
to retaliate."</p>

<p>The regiment's eyes were fastened on their colonel's tall heavy
figure as he walked his powerful horse slowly to and fro along
their front, talking to them in his calm, passionless manner.
Strained muscles and tense nerves relaxed; breath came more regularly
and naturally; men ventured to look about them more freely, to
loosen the spasmodic grip on curb and snaffle, to speak to comrades
in low tones, inquiring what damage other troops had sustained.</p>

<p>The regular cavalry of the Provost Guard had turned the tide
of stragglers now, letting through only the wounded and the teams.
But across the open fields wreckage from the battle was streaming
in every direction; and so stupid and bewildered with fear were
some of the fugitives that McDunn's battery had to cease its fire
for a time, while the officers ran forward through the smoke,
shouting and gesticulating to warn the mass of skulkers out of
the way.</p>

<p>And now a fearful uproar of artillery arose immediately to the
west, shells began to rain in the river woods, then shrapnel,
then, in long clattering cadence, volley succeeded volley, faster,
faster, till the outcrash became one solid, rippling roar.</p>

<p>Far to the west across the country the Lancers saw regiments
passing forward through the trees at a quick-step; saw batteries
galloping hither and thither, aides-de-camp and staff-officers
racing to and fro at full speed.</p>

<p>The 3rd Zouaves rose from the clover, shouldered muskets, and
moved forward on a run; a staff-officer wheeled out of the road,
jumped his horse over the culvert, and galloped up to Colonel
Arran.  And the next moment the Lancers were in the saddle and
moving at a trot out toward the left of McDunn's battery.</p>

<p>They stood facing the woods, lances poised, for about ten minutes,
when a general officer with dragoon escort came galloping down
the road and through the meadow toward McDunn's battery.  It was
Claymore, their general of brigade.</p>

<p>"Retire by prolonge!" he shouted to the battery commander, pulling
in his sweating horse.  "We've got to get out of this!"  And to
Colonel Arran, who had ridden up, flushed and astonished: "We've
got to leave this place," he repeated shortly.  "They're driving
the Zouaves in on us."</p>

<p>All along the edge of the woods the red breeches of the Zouaves
were reappearing, slowly retreating in excellent order before
something as yet unseen.  The men turned every few paces to fire
by companies, only to wheel again, jog-trot toward the rear, halt,
load, swing to deliver their fire, then resume their jogging retreat.</p>

<p>Back they fell, farther, farther, while McDunn's battery continued
to fire and retire by prolonge, and the Lancers, long weapons
disengaged, accompanied them, ready to support the guns in an
emergency.</p>

<p>The emergency seemed very near.  Farther to the left a blue regiment
appeared enveloped in spouting smoke, fairly hurled bodily from
the woods; Egerton's 20th Dragoons came out of a concealed valley
on a trot, looking behind them, their rear squadron firing from
the saddle in orderly retreat; the Zouaves, powder soiled, drenched
in sweat, bloody, dishevelled, passed to the left of the battery
and lay down.</p>

<p>Then, from far along the stretch of woods, arose a sound, incessant,
high-pitched&mdash;a sustained treble cadence, nearer, nearer, louder,
shriller, like the excited cry of a hunting pack, bursting into
a paroxysm of hysterical chorus as a long line of gray men leaped
from the wood's edge and swept headlong toward the guns.</p>

<p>Berkley felt every nerve in his body leap as his lance fell to
a level with eight hundred other lances; he saw the battery bury
itself in smoke as gun after gun drove its cannister into obscurity
or ripped the smoke with sheets of grape; he saw the Zouaves rise
from the grass, deliver their fire, sink back, rise again while
their front spouted smoke and flame.</p>

<p>The awful roar of the firing to the right deafened him; he caught
a glimpse of squadrons of regular cavalry in the road, slinging
carbines and drawing sabres; a muffled blast of bugles reached
his ears; and the nest moment he was trotting out into the smoke.</p>

<p>After that it was a gallop at full speed; and he remembered nothing
very distinctly, saw nothing clearly, except that, everywhere
among his squadron ran yelling men on foot, shooting, lunging
with bayonets, striking with clubbed rifles.  Twice he felt the
shocking impact of his lance point; once he drove the ferruled
counterpoise at a man who went down under his horse's feet.  One
moment there was a perfect whirlwind of scarlet pennons flapping
around him, another and he was galloping alone across the grass,
lance crossed from right to left, tugging at his bridle.  Then
he set the reeking ferrule in his stirrup boot, slung the shaft
from the braided arm loop, and drew his revolver&mdash;the new weapon
lately issued, with its curious fixed ammunition and its cap imbedded.</p>

<p>There were groups of gray infantry in the field, walking, running,
or standing still and firing; groups of lancers and dragoons trotting
here and there, wheeling, galloping furiously at the men on foot. 
A number of foot soldiers were crowding around a mixed company
of dragoons and Lancers, striking at them, shooting into them. 
He saw the Lieutenant-colonel of his own regiment tumble out of
his saddle; saw Major Lent put his horse to a dead run and ride
over a squad of infantry; saw Colonel Arran disengage his horse
from the crush, wheel, and begin to use his heavy sabre in the
mass around him.</p>

<p>Bugles sounded persistently; he set spurs to his tired horse
and rode toward the buglers, and found himself beside Colonel
Arran, who, crimson in the face, was whipping his way out with
dripping sabre.</p>

<p>Across a rivulet on the edge of the woods he could see the regimental
colours and the bulk of his regiment re-forming; and he spurred
forward to join them, skirting the edge of a tangle of infantry,
dragoons, and lancers who were having a limited but bloody affair
of their own in a cornfield where a flag tossed wildly&mdash;a very
beautiful, square red flag, its folds emblazoned with a blue cross
set with stars,</p>

<p>Out of the melee a score of dishevelled lancers came plunging
through the corn, striking right and left at the infantry that
clung to them with the fury of panthers; the square battle flag,
flung hither and thither, was coming close to him; he emptied
his revolver at the man who carried it, caught at the staff, missed,
was almost blinded by the flashing blast from a rifle, set spurs
to his horse, leaned wide from his saddle, seized the silk, jerked
it from its rings, and, swaying, deluged with blood from a sword-thrust
in the face, let his frantic horse carry him whither it listed,
away, away, over the swimming green that his sickened eyes could
see no longer.</p>
