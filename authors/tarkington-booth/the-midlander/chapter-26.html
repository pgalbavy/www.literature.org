<p><em>SHE </em>was mistaken about Martha, who never had the definite
hope Lena’s imagination attributed to her. Martha was steadfast
because she could not help it, having been born with this endowment
evidently; and her tenderness for the boy she had loved so heartily
was imperishable; but the Dan Oliphant of the middle years did
not seem to her to be that boy. What she felt for the big middle-aged
man, she felt only because he had long ago been the beloved youth;
she was not in love with him, nor with anybody. This was the explanation
she still found it necessary to make to his brother about once
a year—usually on New Year’s Day; for it was Harlan’s habit to
select that hopeful anniversary as a good time to dwell a little
upon his patience.</p>

<p>"You call it your patience, but it became only your habit long
ago," she told him. "It would really unsettle you badly if I ever
said I’d marry you, Harlan; and it would unsettle you even more
if I not only said I would, but went ahead and did it. You’d find
you’d never forgive me for upsetting your routine. If we were
married, where in the world would you ever <em>go</em>? You haven’t
been anywhere for so long, except to see me, that you’d be left
without the destination you’ve been accustomed to. It’s gallant
of you to still mention your willingness, every now and then,
and I own up that I rather expect it and should miss it if you
didn’t; but if you want to marry, you ought to look about for—well,
say a pretty widow of twenty-nine, Harlan. She’d be better for
you than one of the ‘buds,’ though you could have whichever you
chose;—they’d jump at the chance! The trouble with me is that
I’m too old—and I’m horribly afraid I look my age."</p>

<p>The fear was warranted, though it need not have been a fear.
She had escaped the portliness that seemed to threaten her at
thirty, and had escaped too far, perhaps; but her thinness was
not angular; and if she looked her age, then that age was no more
than a pleasantly responsible age, as Harlan told her, and neither
a careworn nor a gray-haired age. In fact, it must be the perfect
age, he said—and he wondered if it mightn’t be as kind as it looked,
and be the perfect age for him.</p>

<p>At that, she became more serious. "I’m surprised at myself every
year I grow older," she said. "I’m so much more romantic than
I was at twenty, and it seems I keep growing more so. At twenty
how I’d have laughed if I’d heard of a woman of forty who said
she couldn’t marry because she was in love with no one! I suppose
what would have struck me as funniest would have been the idea
of a woman of forty talking about marrying at all."</p>

<p>She was "in love with no one," but she could still be Harlan’s
brother’s champion, if need arose; and after George McMillan took
up his residence in the town, and began his mild rivalry, she
had this amiable bachelor to second her. Moreover, it is to be
admitted for her that she, who in the bloom of youth had never
known how to display the faintest symptoms of coquetry, now sometimes
enjoyed tokens of disturbance unwillingly exhibited by Harlan
when the rival appeared to win an advantage. McMillan, dark and
growing a little bald, counterbalanced what was lacking above
by a decoration below already rare in the land, but not yet a
curiosity, a Van Dyke beard, well suited to his face. In manner,
too, he was equal to the flavour of a fine old portrait, and he
had spoken from his childhood in the accent Harlan had carefully
acquired. Thus the latter was sometimes but too well encountered
on his own ground.</p>

<p>He met one of these defeats in an early April twilight when he
had expected to find Martha alone, as he knew a meeting of the
board of directors of the "Ornaby Four" had been called for that
evening, and George McMillan was a member of the board. The air
was warm with one of the misplacements of this season, when sometimes
a midsummer day wanders from its proper moorings and irrationally
ascends almost to the chilly headwaters of spring. Martha was
upon the veranda, occupied with a fan and the conversation of
Mr. McMillan when Harlan arrived; and the newcomer was so maladroit
as to make his disappointed expectations plain.</p>

<p>"I thought you had a directors’ meeting," he said, almost with
his greeting and before he had seated himself in one of the wicker
chairs brought out upon the veranda by the unseasonable warmth.
"I thought there was——"</p>

<p>George assented placidly. "There was, but it couldn’t be held.
Our president had to go to another one that he’s president of—the
Broadwood Interurban. It’s in difficulties, I’m afraid, because
of too high wages and too much competition by motorcycles and
small cars. I hope Dan can straighten it out."</p>

<p>"I hope so," Harlan said. "That is, strictly as his brother I
hope so. As a human being still trying to exist in what was once
a comfortable house, I might take another attitude. I live deep
in the downtown district now, for my worst sins, and those long
Broadwood cars screech every hour, night and day, on a curve not
a hundred yards from my library." He sighed. "But why should I
waste my breath, still complaining? It all grows steadily worse
and worse, year after year, and if one happens to like living
in a city in his own native land, there’s nowhere to escape to.
I suppose National Avenue—poor thing, look at the wreck of it!—I
say I suppose it couldn’t have hoped to escape the fate of Fifth
Avenue; for the same miserable ruction is going on all over the
country. My illustrious brother and his kind have ruined everything
that was peaceful and everything that was clean—they began by
murdering the English language, and now they’ve murdered all whiteness.
Beauty is dead."</p>

<p>"Isn’t that only a question of your definition?" McMillan inquired.</p>

<p>"Why is it?"</p>

<p>"For one reason, because everything’s a question of definitions."</p>

<p>"No, it isn’t," Harlan returned somewhat brusquely; and Martha
sat in silence, amused to perceive that her two callers had straightway
resumed a tilting not infrequent when they met. A lady’s part
was only to preside at the joust. "There’s only one definition
of beauty," Harlan added to his contradiction.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"The one Athens believed in."</p>

<p>"It won’t do for that brother of yours," his antagonist returned.
"The Greeks are dead, and you can’t tie Dan and his sort down
to a dead definition. The growth isn’t beautiful to you, but it
is to them, or else they wouldn’t make it. Of course you’re sure
you’re right about your own definition, but they’re so busy making
what <em>they</em>’re sure is beautiful they don’t even know that
anybody disagrees with them. It won’t do you the slightest good
to disagree with them, either."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because they’ve got everything in their hands," George McMillan
replied cheerfully;—"and they’re too busy to listen to any one
who isn’t making something besides criticisms."</p>

<p>"And for that reason," Harlan began, "all of us who care for
what’s quiet and cool and charming in life are to hold our peace
and let——"</p>

<p>He was interrupted, unable to make himself heard because of a
shattering uproar that came from beyond the iron fence to the
south. A long and narrow motor car, enamelled Chinese red, stood
in the Oliphants’ driveway, and an undersized boy of sixteen had
just run out of the house and jumped into the driver’s seat. Dusk
had not fallen darkly; he saw the group upon the neighbouring
veranda well enough, but either thought it too much effort to
salute Martha and his uncles, or was preoccupied with the starting
of his car;—he gave no sign of being aware of them. Evidently
the unmuffled machine-gun firing of his exhaust was delightful
to his young ears, for he increased its violence to the utmost,
although the noise was unlawful, and continued it as he shot the
car down the drive, out of the gates and down the street at a
speed also unlawful.</p>

<p>"There, at least," Harlan said, "is something of which criticism
might possibly be listened to with good effect—even by my busy
brother."</p>

<p>But George laughed and shook his head. "No. That’s the very last
thing he’d allow you to criticize. He’d only tell you that Henry
is ‘the finest young man God ever made!’ In fact, that’s what
he told me yesterday evening when I dined there; and I had more
than a suspicion I’d caught a whiff of something suggesting a
cocktail from our mutual nephew, as he came in for a hurried dinner
between speedings. But that isn’t Dan’s fault."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," Harlan said. "Giving a sixteen-year-old boy a car
like that!"</p>

<p>"No, the fault is my sister’s. What’s a boy to do when his mother
keeps him hanging around Paris so long in the autumn that it’s
too late for him to make up his class-work, and he has only a
tutor to cajole? I don’t blame Henry much. In fact, the older
I grow the less I blame anything."</p>

<p>"No?" Harlan said. "I’m afraid the world won’t get anywhere very
fast unless there are some people to point out its mistakes."</p>

<p>But the other bachelor jouster was not at all disconcerted by
this reproof, nor by the tone of it, which was incautiously superior.
"By George, Oliphant, I always <em>have</em> believed you were
really a true Westerner under that surface of yours! The way you
said ‘the world won’t get anywhere very fast’ was precisely in
the right tone. You’re reverting to type, and if the reversion
doesn’t stop I shan’t be surprised to hear of your breathing deep
of the smoke and calling it ‘Prosperity’ with the best of them!"</p>

<p>Harlan was displeased. "I suppose the smoke comes under your
definition of beauty, too, doesn’t it?"</p>

<p>"It isn’t my definition," George explained. "I was groping for
Dan’s. Yes, I think the smoke’s beautiful to him because he believes
it means growth and power, and he thinks they’re beautiful."</p>

<p>"I dare say. Would you consider it a rational view for any even
half-educated man to hold—that soft-coal smoke is beautiful? Do
you think so, Martha, when it makes pneumonia epidemic, ruins
everything white that you have in your house and everything white
that you wear? Do you?"</p>

<p>"It’s pretty trying," she answered, as a conscientious housewife,
but added hopefully: "We’ll get rid of it some day, though. So
many people are complaining of it I’m sure they’ll do something
about it before long."</p>

<p>Harlan laughed dryly, for he had hoped she would say that. "I’ve
been re-reading John Evelyn’s diary," he said. "Evelyn declared
the London smoke was getting so dreadful that a stop would have
to be put to it somehow. The king told him to devise a plan for
getting rid of it, and Evelyn set about it quite hopefully. That
was in the latter part of the seventeenth century. Evelyn is dead,
but the smoke’s still there."</p>

<p>"And yet," George McMillan said coolly, "I’m told they’ve made
quite a place of London, in spite of that!"</p>

<p>Martha laughed aloud, and Harlan was so unfortunate as to be
annoyed. "It seems rather a childish argument in view of the fact
that we sit here in the atmosphere of what might well be a freight
yard," he said; and, turning to Martha he spoke in a lowered voice,
audible to his opponent, yet carrying the implication that McMillan
was excluded from the conference. "My committee have at last got
the symphony organization completed," he said. "The orchestra
knows it can depend on a reliable support now, and the first concert
will be two weeks from to-night. I hope you won’t mind going with
me."</p>

<p>"No; I won’t mind," she said, and hospitably explained to McMillan:
"We’ve been trying for years to expand our week of the ‘April
Festival’ into something more permanent. Mr. Oliphant has done
most of the work, and it’s really a public service. It will be
good news for your sister;—I understand she’s always felt we were
a lost people, in music particularly."</p>

<p>"We’ll have a start at any rate," Harlan said, as he rose to
go. "That is, if the smoke doesn’t throttle our singers. Venable
is back from South America and there ought to be some interest
to hear him."</p>

<p>"Venable?" George repeated. "Did you say Venable?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the baritone. He’s still just in his prime; at least so
his agent says. Have you ever heard him?"</p>

<p>"Long ago," the other returned. "I——" He stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"Did you know him?" Martha asked.</p>

<p>"No. That is, I had a short interview with him once, but—no,
I shouldn’t say I know him." He rose, in courtesy to the departing
Harlan, and extended his hand. "You mustn’t wait behind the next
corner and leap out on me with a bowie-knife, Oliphant," he said.
"I didn’t mean to be such a disagreeable arguer."</p>

<p>"Not at all," Harlan returned, somewhat coldly, though he added
an effect of geniality to his departure by a murmur of laughter,
and got away without any further emphasis upon his disappointment
at finding his rival in possession. The latter gentleman, however,
made little use of the field left open to him. Not long after
Harlan had gone Martha noticed that her remaining guest seemed
to be rather absent-minded, and she rallied him upon it.</p>

<p>"I’m afraid you thrive upon conflict, Mr. McMillan."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Peace doesn’t seem to stimulate you—or else <em>I</em> don’t!
You’ve hardly spoken since Mr. Oliphant left. I’m afraid you’re——"</p>

<p>"You’re afraid I’m what?" he said, as she paused; and although
the dusk had fallen now, it was not too dark for her to see that
his preoccupation was serious.</p>

<p>"Are you troubled about anything?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No. Why?"</p>

<p>"I thought you looked——"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he said. "It’s nothing. Perhaps I am a little bothered,"
he admitted. "But it’s only about business."</p>

<p>"Not about the ‘Ornaby Four?’" she said, surprised. "I thought
it was established as a tremendous success."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is," he assured her promptly. "It is. It’s an extraordinary
little car and nothing can stop it—except temporarily. It’s bound
to climb over any little temporary difficulties. We may have made
mistakes, but they won’t amount to anything in the long run."</p>

<p>"You say you <em>have</em> made mistakes?"</p>

<p>"Not until this year, and even then nothing we can’t remedy.
You see Dan’s a great fellow for believing in almost anything
that’s new, and an inventor came along last summer with a new
type of friction clutch; and we put it in our car. Then I’m afraid
we built a fairly enormous number of ‘Fours’ during the winter,
but you see we were justified in that, because we knew there’d
be a demand for them."</p>

<p>"And there wasn’t?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; there was. But——" he paused; then went on: "Well, the
people haven’t seemed to like the new clutch, and that gives us
rather a black eye for the time being. Of course we’re going to
do our best to straighten things out; we’ll put our old clutch
back on all the new cars, but——"</p>

<p>He paused uncomfortably again, and she inquired: "But won’t that
make everything all right again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes—after a time. The trouble is, I’m afraid it’s stopped
our sales rather flat—for the time being, that is. You see, there’s
a lot of money we expected would be pouring in on us about now—and
it doesn’t pour. I’m not really worried, but I’m a little afraid
Dan might need it, because his inter-urban ventures appear to
have been—well, rather hazardous. You told me once that his brother’s
description of him was ‘dancing on the tight-rope’ and in a way
that’s not so far wrong. Of course he’ll pull through." George
suddenly struck the stone railing beside him a light blow with
his open hand, and jumped up. "Good gracious! What am I doing
but talking business to a lady on a spring evening? I knew I was
in my dotage!" And he went to the steps.</p>

<p>"Wait," Martha said hurriedly. "You don’t really think——"</p>

<p>"That Dan Oliphant’s affairs are in any real danger? No; of course
not;—I don’t know what made me run on like that. Men go through
these little disturbances every day; it’s a part of the game they
play, and they don’t think anything about it. You can be sure
<em>he</em> isn’t worrying. Did you ever know him to let such
things stop him? He’s been through a thousand of ’em and walked
over ’em. He’s absolutely all right."</p>

<p>"You’re sure?" she said, as he went down the steps.</p>

<p>"He’s absolutely all right, and I’d take my oath to it," George
said; but he added: "That is, he is if the banks don’t call him."</p>

<p>"If the banks don’t what?"</p>

<p>He laughed reassuringly. "If the banks don’t do something they
have no reason to do and certainly won’t do. Good-night. I’m going
to stop in next door and see my sister a little while before she
goes to bed."</p>

<p>His figure grew dimmer as he went toward the gate, and Martha,
staring after him, began to be haunted by that mysterious phrase
of his, "if the banks don’t call him." </p>
