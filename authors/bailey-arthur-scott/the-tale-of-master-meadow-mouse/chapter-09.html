<p>MOSES MOUSE, who lived in the farmhouse, had warned Master Meadow Mouse.
He had warned him to look out for Miss Snooper's nose.
</p>
<p>Master Meadow Mouse did not pay any great attention to his new friend's
advice. He was building himself a new home in Farmer Green's woodpile.
And he went about his work as if there wasn't a cat within a hundred
miles.
</p><p>Then, one day, he caught a glimpse of Miss Snooper. He peeped out from a
chink in the woodpile and saw her sitting on a stick of wood. She was so
near him that Master Meadow Mouse could have leaped upon her back in
one spring.
</p><p>But he didn't do that. He gazed at her with round eyes, for Miss Snooper
looked very fierce, especially when she opened her mouth and showed her
sharp teeth as she yawned. Master Meadow Mouse saw that she was a quite
different creature from the awkward kitten whom he had bitten on the
nose earlier in the summer.
</p><p>"Goodness!" thought Master Meadow Mouse, staring at Miss Snooper with
great awe. "Goodness! Her whiskers are longer than mine!"
</p><p>And then he drew back very softly and crept to his nest in the woodpile.
</p><p>That night Moses Mouse came to make another call. And he brought his
wife with him, so that she might see the stranger with the short tail
who was going to live in Farmer Green's woodpile.
</p><p>"I saw Miss Snooper to-day," Master Meadow Mouse told them.
</p><p>"Did you bite her nose?" Mrs. Mouse asked him eagerly; for her husband
had told her all about the newcomer.
</p><p>"No!" said Master Meadow Mouse. "No! I was too busy, building my new
home, to stop and bite her."
</p><p>"Isn't he brave!" whispered Mrs. Moses Mouse to her husband.
</p><p>From where they sat, on the top of the woodpile, Master Meadow Mouse and
his callers caught sight of a dark shape that moved stealthily towards
them through the shadows.
</p><p>"It's Miss Snooper herself!" Mrs. Mouse cried. And quick as a wink she
dived down among the sticks of wood, with her husband following close
behind her.
</p><p>"Probably Master Meadow Mouse will bite Miss Snooper's nose this time,"
she said to Moses, when she had reached a safe retreat.
</p><p>"He isn't biting it now," Moses Mouse replied, "because he's crowding
right behind me."
</p><p>"Miss Snooper has come," Mrs. Mouse said to Master Meadow Mouse. "Maybe
you didn't understand that it was she."
</p><p>"Let her come!" Master Meadow Mouse squeaked.
</p><p>"Isn't he brave!" Mrs. Moses Mouse murmured.
</p><p>"I'll bite her nose if she sticks it into this crevice," Master Mouse
declared.
</p><p>"Isn't he brave!" she breathed into her husband's ear.
</p><p>"I'm not so sure of that," said Moses Mouse in an undertone. "He <u>talks</u>
a good deal about nose-biting. I should like to see him <u>do</u> it. I knew
Miss Snooper was skulking around the yard to-night. That's why I came
to call on this chap. I wanted to see whether he'd fight or run."
</p><p>Meanwhile Miss Snooper climbed all over the woodpile. She could hear
faint squeaks somewhere. And she was almost frantic because she couldn't
squirm under the wood and find whoever was talking.
</p><p>It was almost morning before Moses Mouse and his wife dared to steal
back to the farmhouse. When they left the woodpile Master Meadow Mouse
left it too. He had decided, during the night, that he wouldn't live in
the farmyard.
</p><p>"I've become very tired of this old Cat," he told his companions--Mr.
and Mrs. Moses Mouse. "I shouldn't care to stay where I had to see her
often."
