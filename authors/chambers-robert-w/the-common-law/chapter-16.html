<p>On the morning of the first day of June Neville came into his
studio and found there a letter from Valerie:</p>

<p>"<em>DEAREST: I </em>am not keeping my word to you; I am asking
you for more time; and I know you will grant it.</p>

<p>"José Querida's death has had a curious effect on me. I was inclined
to care very sincerely for him; I comprehended him better than
many people, I think. Yet there was much in him that I never understood.
And I doubt that he ever entirely understood himself.</p>

<p>"I believe that he was really a great painter, Louis&mdash;and have
sometimes thought that his character was mediæval at the foundations&mdash;with
five centuries of civilisation thinly deposited over the bed-rock....
In him there seemed to be something primitive; something untamable,
and utterly irreconcilable with, the fundamental characteristics
of modern man.</p>

<p>"He was my friend.... Friendship, they say, is a record of misunderstandings;
and it was so with us But may I tell you something? José Querida
loved me&mdash;in his own fashion.</p>

<p>"What kind of a love it was&mdash;of what value &mdash;I can not tell
you. I do not think it was very high in the scale. Only he felt
it for me, and for no other woman, I believe.</p>

<p>"It never was a love that I could entirely understand or respect;
yet,&mdash;it is odd but true &mdash;I cared something for it&mdash;perhaps
because, in spite of its unfamiliar and sometimes repellent disguises&mdash;it
<em>was</em> love after all.</p>

<p>"And now, as at heart and in mind you and I are one; and as I
keep nothing of real importance from you&mdash;perhaps <em>can</em>
not; I must tell you that José Querida came that day to ask me
to marry him.</p>

<p>"I tried to make him understand that I could not think of such
a thing; and he lost his head and became violent. That is how
the table fell: &mdash;I had started toward the door when he sprang
back to block me, and the low window-sill caught him under the
knees, and he fell outward into the yard.</p>

<p>"I know of course that no blame could rest on me, but it was
a terrible and dreadful thing that happened there in one brief
second; and somehow it seems to have moved in me depths that have
never before been stirred.</p>

<p>"The newspapers, as you know, published it merely as an accident&mdash;which
it really was. But they might have made it, by innuendo, a horror
for me. However, they put it so simply and so unsuspiciously that
José Querida might have been any nice man calling on any nice
woman.</p>

<p>"Louis, I have never been so lonely in my life as I have been
since José Querida died; alas! not because he has gone out of
my life forever, but because, somehow, the manner of his death
has made me realise how difficult it is for a woman alone to contend
with men in a man's own world.</p>

<p>"Do what she may to maintain her freedom, her integrity, there
is always,&mdash;sometimes impalpable, sometimes not&mdash;a steady, remorseless
pressure on her, forcing her unwillingly to take frightened cognisance
of men;&mdash;take into account their inexorable desire for domination;
the subtle cohesion existent among them which, at moments, becomes
like a wall of adamant barring, limiting, inclosing and forcing
women toward the deep-worn grooves which women have trodden through
the sad centuries;&mdash;and which they tread still&mdash;and will tread
perhaps for years to come before the real enfranchisement of mankind
begins.</p>

<p>"I do not mean to write bitterly, dear; but, somehow, all this
seems to bear significantly, ominously, upon my situation in the
world.</p>

<p>"When I first knew you I felt so young, so confident, so free,
so scornful of custom, so wholesomely emancipated from silly and
unjust conventions, that perhaps I overestimated my own vigour
and ability to go my way, unvexed, unfettered in this man's world,
and let the world make its own journey in peace. But it will not.</p>

<p>"Twice, now, within a month,&mdash;and not through any conscious fault
of mine&mdash;this man's world has shown its teeth at me; I have been
menaced by its innate scorn of woman, and have, by chance, escaped
a publicity which would have damned me so utterly that I would
not have cared to live.</p>

<p>"And dear, for the first time I really begin to understand now
what the shelter of a family means; what it is to have law on
my side,&mdash;and a man who understands his man's world well enough
to fight it with its own weapons;&mdash;well enough to protect a woman
from things she never dreamed might menace her.</p>

<p>"When that policeman came into my room,&mdash;dear, you will think
me a perfect coward&mdash;but suddenly I seemed to realise what law
meant, and that it had power to protect me or destroy me.... And
I was frightened,&mdash;and the table lay there with the fragments
of broken china&mdash;and there was that dreadful window&mdash;and I &mdash;I
who knew how he died! &mdash;Louis! Louis! guiltless as I was,&mdash;blameless
in thought and deed &mdash;I died a thousand deaths there while
the big policeman and the reporters were questioning me.</p>

<p>"If it had not been for what José was generous enough to say,
I could never have thought out a lie to tell them; I should have
told them how it had really happened.... And what the papers would
have printed about him and about me, God only knows.</p>

<p>"Never, never had I needed you as I needed you at that moment....
Well; I lied to them, somehow; I said to them what José had said&mdash;that
he was seated on the window-ledge, lost his balance, clutched
at the table, overturned it, and fell. And they believed me....
It is the first lie since I was a little child, that I have ever
knowingly told.... And I know now that I could never contrive
to tell another.</p>

<p>"Dear, let me try to think out what is best for us.... And forgive
me, Louis, if I can not help a thought or two of self creeping
in. I am so terribly alone. Somehow I am beginning to believe
that it may sometimes be a weakness to totally ignore one's self....
Not that I consider myself of importance compared to you, my darling;
not that I would fail to set aside any thought of self where your
welfare is concerned. You know that, don't you?</p>

<p>"But I have been wondering how it would be with you if I passed
quietly and absolutely out of your life. That is what I am trying
to determine. Because it must be either that or the tie unrecognised
by civilisation. And which would be better for you? I do not know
yet. I ask more time. Don't write me. Your silence will accord
it.</p>

<p>"You are always in my thoughts.</p>

<p>"<em>VALERIE</em>."</p>

<p>Ogilvy came into the studio that afternoon, loquacious, in excellent
humour, and lighting a pipe, detailed what news he had while Neville
tried to hide his own deep perplexity and anxiety under a cordial
welcome.</p>

<p>"You know," said Ogilvy, "that all the time you've given me and
all your kindness and encouragement has made a corker of that
picture of mine."</p>

<p>"You did it yourself," said Neville. "It's good work, Sam."</p>

<p>"Sure it's good work&mdash;being mostly yours. And what do you think,
Kelly; it's sold!"</p>

<p>"Good for you!"</p>

<p>"Certainly it's good for me. I need the mazuma. A courteous multi
purchased it for his Long Branch cottage&mdash;said cottage costing
a million. What?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're doing very well," laughed Neville.</p>

<p>"I've <em>got</em> to.... I've&mdash;h'm!&mdash;undertaken to assume obligations
toward civilisation&mdash;h'm!&mdash;and certain duties to my&mdash;h'm&mdash;country&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What on earth are you driving at?" asked Neville, eying him.</p>

<p>"Huh! Driving single just at present; practising for tandem&mdash;h'm!&mdash;and
a spike&mdash;h'm&mdash;some day &mdash;I hope&mdash;of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sam!"</p>

<p>"Hey?"</p>

<p>"Are you trying to say something?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, no! Why, Kelly, did you suspect that I was really
attempting to convey anything to you which I was really too damned
embarrassed to tell you in the patois of my native city?"</p>

<p>"It sounded that way," observed Neville, smiling.</p>

<p>"Did it?" Ogilvy considered, head on one side. "Did it sound
anything like a&mdash;h'm!&mdash;a man who was trying to&mdash;h'm!&mdash;to tell
you that he was going to&mdash;h'm!&mdash;to try to get somebody to try
to let him try to tell her that he wanted to&mdash;marry her?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed Neville, bewildered, "what do you mean?"</p>

<p>Ogilvy pirouetted, picked up a mahl-stick, and began a lively
fencing bout with an imaginary adversary.</p>

<p>"I'm going to get married," he said amiably.</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"To Hélène d'Enver. Only she doesn't know it yet."</p>

<p>"What an infernal idiot you are, Sam!"</p>

<p>"Ya-as, so they say. Some say I'm an ass, others a bally idiot,
others merely refer to me as imbecile. And so it goes, Kelly,&mdash;so
it goes."</p>

<p>He flourished his mahl-stick, neatly punctured the air, and cried
"Hah!" very fiercely.</p>

<p>Then he said:</p>

<p>"I've concluded to let Hélène know about it this afternoon."</p>

<p>"About what?&mdash;you monkey?"</p>

<p>"About our marriage. <em>Won't</em> it surprise her though! Oh,
no! But I think I'll let her into the secret before some suspicious
gink gets wind of it and tells her himself."</p>

<p>Neville looked at the boy, perplexed, undecided, until he caught
his eye. And over Sam's countenance stole a vivid and beauteous
blush.</p>

<p>"Sam! <em>I&mdash;</em>upon my word I believe you mean it!"</p>

<p>"Sure I do!"</p>

<p>Neville grasped his hand:</p>

<p>"My dear fellow!" he said cordially, "I was slow, not unsympathetic.
I'm frightfully glad &mdash;I'm perfectly delighted. She's a charming
and sincere woman. Go in and win and God bless you both!"</p>

<p>Ogilvy wrung his hand, then, to relieve his feelings, ran all
over the floor like a spider and was pretending to spin a huge
web in a corner when Harry Annan and Rita Tevis came in and discovered
him.</p>

<p>"Hah!" he exclaimed, "flies! Two nice, silly, appetising flies.
Pretend to fall into my web, Rita, and begin to buzz like mad!"</p>

<p>Rita's dainty nose went up into the air, but Annan succumbed
to the alluring suggestion, and presently he was buzzing frantically
in a corner while Sam spun an imaginary web all over him.</p>

<p>Rita and Neville looked on for a while.</p>

<p>"Sam never will grow up," she said disdainfully.</p>

<p>"He's fortunate," observed Neville.</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> don't think so."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what I did think, Rita. How is John?"</p>

<p>"I came to tell you. He has gone to Dartford."</p>

<p>"To see Dr. Ogilvy? Good! I'm glad, Rita. Billy Ogilvy usually
makes people do what he tells them to do."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Ogilvy ... began a lively fencing bout with an
imaginary adversary."]</p>

<p>The girl stood silent, eyes lowered. After a while she looked
up at him; and in her unfaltering but sorrowful gaze he read the
tragedy which he had long since suspected.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a moment; he held out both hands; she laid
hers in them, and her gaze became remote.</p>

<p>After a while she said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Let me be with you now and then while he's away; will you, Kelly?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Would you like to pose for me? I haven't anything pressing
on hand. You might begin now if it suits you."</p>

<p>"May I?" she asked gratefully.</p>

<p>"Of course, child.... Let me think&mdash;" He looked again into her
dark blue eyes, absently, then suddenly his attention became riveted
upon something which he seemed to be reading in her face.</p>

<p>Long before Sam and Harry had ended their puppy-like scuffling
and had retired to woo their respective deputy-muses, Rita was
seated on the model-stand, and Neville had already begun that
strange and sombre picture afterward so famous, and about which
one of the finest of our modern poets wrote:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Her gold hair, fallen about her face<br/>
Made light within that shadowy place,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But on her garments lay the dust<br/>
Of many a vanished race.

</p>
<p>
"Her deep eyes, gazing straight ahead,<br/>
Saw years and days and hours long dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While strange gems glittered at her feet,<br/>
Yellow, and green, and red.

</p>
<p>
"And ever from the shadows came<br/>
Voices to pierce her heart like flame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The great bats fanned her with their wings,<br/>
The voices called her name.

</p>
<p>
"But yet her look turned not aside<br/>
From the black deep where dreams abide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where worlds and pageantries lay dead<br/>
Beneath that viewless tide.

</p>
<p>
"Her elbow on her knee was set,<br/>
Her strong hand propt her chin, and yet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No man might name that look she wore,<br/>
Nor any man forget."

</p>
</div>
<p>All day long in the pleasant June weather they worked together
over the picture; and if he really knew what he was about, it
is uncertain, for his thoughts were of Valerie; and he painted
as in a dream, and with a shadowy splendour that seemed even to
him unreal.</p>

<p>They scarcely spoke; now and then Rita came silently on sandalled
feet to stand behind him and look at what he had done.</p>

<p>The first time she thought to herself, "Querida!" But the second
time she remained mute; and when the daylight was waning to a
golden gloom in the room she came a third time and stood with
one hand on his arm, her eyes fixed upon the dawning mystery on
the canvas&mdash;spellbound under the sombre magnificence already vaguely
shadowed forth from infinite depth of shade.</p>

<p>Gladys came and rubbed and purred around his legs; the most recent
progeny toddled after her, ratty tails erect; sportive, casual
little optimists frisking unsteadily on wavering legs among the
fading sunbeams on the floor.</p>

<p>The sunbeams died out on wall and ceiling; high through the glass
roof above, a shoal of rosy clouds paled to saffron, then to a
cinder gray. And the first night-hawk, like a huge, erratic swallow,
sailed into view, soaring, tumbling aloft, while its short raucous
cry sounded incessantly above the roofs and chimneys.</p>

<p>Neville was still seated before his canvas, palette flat across
his left arm, the sheaf of wet brushes held loosely.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are dining with Valerie," he said.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Valerie has gone away."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Kelly.... I was not to know."</p>

<p>"I see." He picked up a handful of waste and slowly began to
clean the brushes, one by one. Then he drove them deep into a
bowl of black soap.</p>

<p>"Shall we dine together here, Rita?"</p>

<p>"If you care to have me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>He laid aside his palette, rang up the kitchen, gave his order,
and slowly returned to where Rita was seated.</p>

<p>Dinner was rather a silent affair. They touched briefly and formally
on Querida and his ripening talent prematurely annihilated; they
spoke of men they knew who were to come after him&mdash;a long, long
way after him.</p>

<p>"I don't know who is to take his place," mused Neville over his
claret.</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>"Not his place, Rita. He thought so; but that place must remain
his."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But you are carving out your own niche in a higher
tier. You are already beginning to do it; and yesterday his niche
was the higher.... Yet, after all&mdash;after all&mdash;"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Then Rita came silently on sandalled feet to
stand behind him and look at what he had done."]</p>

<p>He nodded. "Yes," he said, "what does it matter to him, now?
A man carves out his resting place as you say, but he carves it
out in vain. Those who come after him will either place him in
his proper sepulchre ... or utterly neglect him.... And neglect
or transfer will cause him neither happiness nor pain.... Both
are ended for Querida;&mdash;let men exalt him above all, or bury him
and his work out of sight&mdash;what does he care about it now? He
has had all that life held for him, and what another life may
promise him no man can know. All reward for labour is here, Rita;
and the reward lasts only while the pleasure in labour lasts.
Creative work&mdash;even if well done&mdash;loses its savour when it is
finished. Happiness in it ends with the final touch. It is like
a dead thing to him who created it; men's praise or blame makes
little impression; and the aftertaste of both is either bitter
or flat and lasts but a moment."</p>

<p>"Are you a little morbid, Kelly?"</p>

<p>"Am I?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me so."</p>

<p>"And you, Rita?"</p>

<p>She shook her pretty head in silence.</p>

<p>After a while Gladys jumped up into her lap, and she lay back
in her arm-chair smoothing the creature's fur, and gazing absently
into space.</p>

<p>"Kelly," she said, "how many, many years ago it seems when you
came up to Delaware County to see us."</p>

<p>"It seems very long ago to me, too."</p>

<p>She lifted her blue eyes:</p>

<p>"May I speak plainly? I have known you a long while. There is
only one man I like better. But there is no woman in the world
whom I love as I love Valerie West.... May I speak plainly?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;be fair to her, Kelly. Will you?"</p>

<p>"I will try."</p>

<p>"Try very hard. For after all it <em>is</em> a man's world, and
she doesn't understand it. Try to be fair to her, Kelly. For&mdash;whether
or not the laws that govern the world are man-made and unjust&mdash;they
are, nevertheless, the only laws. Few men can successfully fight
them; no woman can&mdash;yet.... I am not angering you, am I?"</p>

<p>"No. Go on."</p>

<p>"I have so little to say &mdash;I who feel so deeply&mdash;deeply....
And the laws are always there, Kelly, always there&mdash;fair or unfair,
just or unjust&mdash;they are always there to govern the world that
framed them. And a woman disobeys them at her peril."</p>

<p>She moved slightly in her chair and sat supporting her head on
one pretty ringless hand.</p>

<p>"Yet," she said, "although a woman disobeys any law at her peril&mdash;laws
which a man may often ignore with impunity&mdash;there is one law to
which no woman should dare subscribe. And it is sometimes known
as 'The Common Law of Marriage.'"</p>

<p>She sat silent for a while, her gaze never leaving his shadowy
face.</p>

<p>"That is the only law&mdash;if it is truly a law&mdash;that a woman must
ignore. All others it is best for her to observe. And if the laws
of marriage are merely man-made or divine, I do not know. There
is a din in the world to-day which drowns the voices preaching
old beliefs.... And a girl is deafened by the clamour.... And
I don't know.</p>

<p>"But, it seems to me, that back of the laws men have made&mdash;if
there be nothing divine in their inspiration&mdash;there is another
foundation solid enough to carry them. Because it seems to me
that the world's laws&mdash;even when unjust&mdash;are built on natural
laws. And how can a girl say that these natural laws are unjust
because they have fashioned her to bear children and feed them
from her own body?</p>

<p>"And another thing, Kelly; if a man breaks a man-made law&mdash;founded,
we believe, on a divine commandment&mdash;he suffers only in a spiritual
and moral sense.... And with us it may be more than that. For
women, at least, hell is on earth."</p>

<p>He stirred in his chair, and his sombre gaze rested on the floor
at her feet.</p>

<p>"What are we to do?" he said dully.</p>

<p>Rita shook her head:</p>

<p>"I don't know. I am not instructing you, Kelly, only recalling
to your mind what you already know; what all men know, and find
so convenient to forget. Love is not excuse enough; the peril
is unequally divided. The chances are uneven; the odds are unfair.
If a man really loves a woman, how can he hazard her in a game
of chance that is not square? How can he let her offer more than
he has at stake&mdash;even if she is willing? How can he permit her
to risk more than he is even able to risk? How can he accept a
magnanimity which leaves him her hopeless debtor? But men have
done it, men will continue to do it; God alone knows how they
reconcile it with their manhood or find it in their hearts to
deal so unfairly by us. But they do.... And still we stake all;
and proudly overlook the chances against us; and face the contemptible
odds with a smile, dauntless and&mdash;damned!"</p>

<p>He leaned forward in the dusk; she could see his bloodless features
now only as a pale blot in the twilight.</p>

<p>"All this I knew, Rita. But it is just as well, perhaps, that
you remind me."</p>

<p>"I thought it might be as well. The world has grown very clever;
but after all there is no steadier anchor for a soul than a platitude."</p>

<p>Ogilvy and Annan came mincing in about nine o'clock, disposed
for flippancy and gossip; but neither Neville nor Rita encouraged
them; so after a while they took their unimpaired cheerfulness
and horse-play elsewhere, leaving the two occupants of the studio
to their own silent devices.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when he walked back with Rita to her rooms.</p>

<p>And now day followed day in a sequence of limpid dawns and cloudless
sunsets. Summer began with a clear, hot week in June, followed
by three days' steady downpour which freshened and cooled the
city and unfolded, in square and park, everything green into magnificent
maturity.</p>

<p>Every day Neville and Rita worked together in the studio; and
every evening they walked together in the park or sat in the cool,
dusky studio, companionably conversational or permitting silence
to act as their interpreter.</p>

<p>Then John Burleson came back from Dartford after remaining there
ten days under Dr. Ogilvy's observation; and Rita arrived at the
studio next day almost smiling.</p>

<p>"We're' going to Arizona," she said. "<em>What</em> do you think
of that, Kelly?"</p>

<p>"You poor child!" exclaimed Neville, taking her hands into his
and holding them closely.</p>

<p>"Why, Kelly," she said gently, "I knew he had to go. This has
not taken me unawares."</p>

<p>"I hoped there might be some doubt," he said.</p>

<p>"There was none in my mind. I foresaw it. Listen to me: twice
in a woman's life a woman becomes a prophetess. That fatal clairvoyance
is permitted to a woman twice in her life&mdash;and the second time
it is neither for herself that she foresees the future, nor for
him whom she loves...."</p>

<p>"I wish &mdash;I wish&mdash;" he hesitated; and she flushed brightly.</p>

<p>"I know what you wish, Kelly dear. I don't think it will ever
happen. But it is so much for me to be permitted to remain near
him&mdash;so much! &mdash;Ah, you don't know, Kelly! You don't know!"</p>

<p>"Would you marry him?"</p>

<p>Her honest blue eyes met his:</p>

<p>"If he asked me; and if he still wished it&mdash;after he knew."</p>

<p>"Could you ever be less to him&mdash;and perhaps more, Rita?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>He nodded deliberately.</p>

<p>She hung her head.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "if I could be no more I would be what I could."</p>

<p>"And you tell <em>me</em> that, after all that you have said?"</p>

<p>"I did not pretend to speak for men, Kelly. I told you that women
had, and women still would overlook the chances menacing them
and face the odds dauntlessly.... Because, whatever a man is&mdash;if
a woman loves him enough&mdash;he is worth to her what she gives."</p>

<p>"Rita! Rita! Is it <em>you</em> who content yourself with such
sorry philosophy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I. You asked me and I answer you. Whatever I said
&mdash;I know only one thing now. And you know what that is."</p>

<p>"And where am I to look for sympathy and support in my own decision?
What can I think now about all that you have said to me?"</p>

<p>"You will never forget it, Kelly&mdash;whatever becomes of the girl
who said it. Because it's the truth, no matter whose lips uttered
it."</p>

<p>He released her hands and she went away to dress herself for
the pose. When she returned and seated herself he picked up his
palette and brushes and began in silence.</p>

</div>
<p>That evening he went to see John Buries on and found him smoking
tranquilly in the midst of disorder. Packing cases, trunks, bundles,
boxes were scattered and piled up in every direction, and the
master of the establishment, apparently in excellent health, reclined
on a lounge in the centre of chaos, the long clay stem of a church-warden
pipe between his lips, puffing rings at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Hello, Kelly!" he exclaimed, sitting up; "I've got to move out
of this place. Rita told you all about it, didn't she? Isn't it
rotten hard luck?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. What did Billy Ogilvy say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've got <em>it</em> all right. Not seriously yet. What's
Arizona like, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Half hell, half paradise, they say."</p>

<p>"Then me for the celestial section. Ogilvy gave me the name of
a place"&mdash;he fumbled about&mdash;"Rita has it, I believe.... Isn't
she a corker to go? My conscience, Kelly, what a Godsend it will
be to have a Massachusetts girl out there to talk to!"</p>

<p>"Isn't she going as your model?"</p>

<p>"My Lord, man! Don't you talk to a model? Is a nice girl who
poses for a fellow anything extra-human or superhuman or&mdash;or unhuman
or inhuman&mdash;so that intelligent conversation becomes impossible?"</p>

<p>"No," began Neville, laughing, but Burleson interrupted excitedly:</p>

<p>"A girl can be anything she chooses if she's all right, can't
she? And Rita comes from Massachusetts, doesn't she?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Not only from Massachusetts, but from Hitherford!" added Burleson
triumphantly. "I came from Hitherford. My grandfather knew hers.
Why, man alive, Rita Tevis is entitled to do anything she chooses
to do."</p>

<p>"That's one way of looking at it, anyway," admitted Neville gravely.</p>

<p>"I look at it that way. <em>You</em> can't; you're not from Massachusetts;
but you have a sort of a New England name, too. It's Yankee, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Southern."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Burleson, honestly depressed; "I <em>am</em> sorry.
There were Nevilles in Hitherford Lower Falls two hundred years
ago. I've always liked to think of you as originating, somehow
or other, in Massachusetts Bay."</p>

<p>"No, John: unlike McGinty, I am unfamiliar with the cod-thronged
ocean deeps.... When are you going?"</p>

<p>"Day after to-morrow. Rita says you don't need her any longer
on that picture&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord, man! If I did I wouldn't hold you up. But don't worry,
John; she wouldn't let me.... She's a fine specimen of girl,"
he added casually.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'You'd better understand, Kelly, that Rita Tevis
is as well born as I am.'"]</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that is news to me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I'm sure you find her amusing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Amusing," repeated Neville innocently. "Don't you?"</p>

<p>"That is scarcely the word I would have chosen, Kelly. I have
a very warm admiration and a very sincere respect for Rita Tevis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John! You sound like a Puritan making love!"</p>

<p>Burleson was intensely annoyed:</p>

<p>"You'd better understand, Kelly, that Rita Tevis is as well born
as I am, and that there would be nothing at all incongruous in
any declaration that any decent man might make her!"</p>

<p>"Why, I know that."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you do. And I'm gratified that what you said has given
me the opportunity to make myself very plain on the subject of
Rita Tevis. It may amaze you to know that her great grandsire
carried a flintlock with the Hitherford Minute Men, and fell most
respectably at Boston Neck."</p>

<p>"Certainly, John. I knew she was all right. But I wasn't sure
you knew it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Confound it! Of course I did. I've always known it. Do you think
I'd care for her so much if she wasn't all right?"</p>

<p>Neville smiled at him gravely, then held out his hand:</p>

<p>"Give my love to her, John. I'll see you both again before you
go."</p>

<p>For nearly two weeks he had not heard a word from Valerie West.
Rita and John Burleson had departed, cheerful, sure of early convalescence
and a complete and radical cure.</p>

<p>Neville went with them to the train, but his mind was full of
his own troubles and he could scarcely keep his attention on the
ponderous conversation of Burleson, who was admonishing him and
Ogilvy impartially concerning the true interpretation of creative
art.</p>

<p>He turned aside to Rita when opportunity offered and said in
a low voice:</p>

<p>"Before you go, tell me where Valerie is."</p>

<p>"I can't, Kelly."</p>

<p>"Did you promise her not to?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He said, slowly: "I haven't had one word from her in nearly two
weeks. Is she well?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She came into town this morning to say good-bye to me."</p>

<p>"I didn't know she was out of town," he said, troubled.</p>

<p>"She has been, and is now. That's all I can tell you, Kelly dear."</p>

<p>"She <em>is</em> coming back, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"Don't you know?"</p>

<p>She looked into his anxious and miserable face and gently shook
her head:</p>

<p>"I <em>don't</em> know, Kelly."</p>

<p>"Didn't she say&mdash;intimate anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No.... I don't think she knows&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>He said, very quietly: "If she ever comes to any conclusion that
it is better for us both never to meet again &mdash;I might be
as dead as Querida for any work I should ever again set hand to.</p>

<p>"If she will not marry me, but will let things remain as they
are, at least I can go on caring for her and working out this
miserable problem of life. But if she goes out of my life, life
will go out of me. I know that now."</p>

<p>Rita looked at him pitifully:</p>

<p>"Valerie's mind is her own, Kelly. It is the most honest mind
I have ever known; and nothing on earth&mdash;no pain that her decision
might inflict upon her&mdash;would swerve it a hair's breath from what
she concludes is the right thing to do."</p>

<p>"I know it," he said, swallowing a sudden throb of fear.</p>

<p>"Then what can I say to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I must wait."</p>

<p>"Kelly, if you loved her enough you would not even wait."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Because her return to you will mean only one thing. Are you
going to accept it of her?"</p>

<p>"What can I do? I can't live without her!"</p>

<p>"<em>Her</em> problem is nobler, Kelly. She is asking herself
not whether she can live life through without <em>you</em>&mdash;but
whether you can live life well, and to the full, without <em>her</em>?"</p>

<p>Neville flushed painfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "<em>that is</em> Valerie. I'm not worth the
anxiety, the sorrow that I have brought her. I'm not worth marrying;
and I'm not worth a heavier sacrifice.... I'm trying to think
less of myself, Rita, and more of her.... Perhaps, if I knew she
were happy, I could stand&mdash;losing her.... If she could be&mdash;without
me&mdash;" He checked himself, for the struggle was unnerving him;
then he set his face firmly and looked straight at Rita.</p>

<p>"Do you believe she could forget me and be contented and tranquil&mdash;if
I gave her the chance?"</p>

<p>"Are <em>you</em> talking of self-sacrifice for <em>her</em>
sake?"</p>

<p>He drew a deep, uneven breath:</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>suppose it's&mdash;that."</p>

<p>"You mean that you're willing to eliminate yourself and give
her an opportunity to see a little of the world&mdash;a little of its
order and tranquillity and quieter happiness?&mdash;a chance to meet
interesting women and attractive men of her own age&mdash;as she is
certain to do through her intimacy with the Countess d'Enver?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "that is what must be done.... I've been blind&mdash;and
rottenly selfish. I did not mean to be.... I've tried to force
her &mdash;I have done nothing else since I fell in love with
her, but force her toward people whom she has a perfect right
not to care for&mdash;even if they happen to be my own people. She
has felt nothing but a steady and stupid pressure from me;&mdash;heard
from me nothing except importunities&mdash;the merciless, obstinate
urging of my own views&mdash;which, God forgive me, I thought were
the only views because they were respectable!"</p>

<p>He stood, head lowered, nervously clenching and unclenching his
hands.</p>

<p>"It was not for her own sake&mdash;that's the worst of it! It was
for my sake&mdash;because I've had respectability inculcated until
I can't conceive of my doing anything not respectable.... Once,
something else got away with me&mdash;and I gave it rein for a moment&mdash;until
checked.... I'm really no different from other men."</p>

<p>"I think you are beginning to be, Kelly."</p>

<p>"Am I? I don't know. But the worst of it was my selfishness&mdash;my
fixed idea that her marrying me was the <em>only</em> salvation
for her.... I never thought of giving her a chance of seeing other
people&mdash;other men&mdash;better men&mdash;of seeing a tranquil, well-ordered
world&mdash;of being in it and of it. I behaved as though my world&mdash;the
fragment inhabited by my friends and family&mdash;was the only alternative
to this one. I've been a fool, Rita; and a cruel one."</p>

<p>"No, only an average man, Kelly.... If I give you Valerie's address,
would you write and give her her freedom&mdash;for her own sake?&mdash;the
freedom to try life in that well-ordered world we speak of?...
Because she is very young. Life is all before her. Who can foretell
what friends she may be destined to make; what opportunities she
may have. I care a great deal for you, Kelly; but I love Valerie....
And, there <em>are</em> other men in the world after all;&mdash;but
there is only one Valerie.... And&mdash;<em>how truly do you love her</em>?"</p>

<p>"Enough," he said under his breath.</p>

<p>"Enough to&mdash;leave her alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then write and tell her so. Here is the address."</p>

<p>She slipped a small bit of folded paper into Neville's land.</p>

<p>"We must join the others, now," she said calmly.</p>

<p>Annan had come up, and he and Ogilvy were noisily baiting Burleson
amid shouts of laughter and a protesting roar from John.</p>

<p>"Stop it, you wretches," said Rita amiably, entering the little
group. "John, are you never going to earn not to pay any attention
to this pair of infants?"</p>

<p>"Are you going to kiss me good-bye, Rita, when the train departs?"
inquired Sam, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Certainly; I kissed Gladys good-bye&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Before all this waiting room full of people?" persisted Sam.
"<em>Are</em> you?"</p>

<p>"Why I'll do it now if you like, Sammy dear."</p>

<p>"They'll take you for my sister," said Sam, disgusted.</p>

<p>"Or your nurse; John, what <em>is</em> that man bellowing through
the megaphone?"</p>

<p>"Our train," said Burleson, picking up the satchels. He dropped
them again to shake the hands that were offered:</p>

<p>"Good-bye, John, dear old fellow! You'll get all over this thing
in a jiffy out there You'll be back in no time at all! Don't worry,
and get well!"</p>

<p>He smiled confidently and shook all their hands Rita's pretty
face was pale; she let Ogilvy kiss her cheek, shook hands with
Annan, and then, turning to Neville, put both hands on his shoulders
and kissed him on the mouth.</p>

<p>"Give her her chance, Kelly," she whispered ... "And it shall
be rendered unto you seven-fold."</p>

<p>"No, Rita; it never will be now."</p>

<p>"Who knows?"</p>

<p>"Rita! Rita!" he said under his breath, "when I am ending, she
must begin.... You are right: this world needs her. Try as I might,
I never could be worth what she is worth without effort. It is
my life which does not matter, not hers. I will do what ought
to be done. Don't be afraid. I will do it. And thank God that
it is not too late."</p>

<p>That night, seated at his desk in the studio, he looked at the
calendar. It was the thirteenth day since he had heard from her;
the last day but two of the fifteen days she had asked for. The
day after to-morrow she would have come, or would have written
him that she was renouncing him forever for his own sake. Which
might it have been? He would never know now.</p>

<p>He wrote her:</p>

<p>"Dearest of women, Rita has been loyal to you. It was only when
I explained to her for what purpose I wished your address that
she wisely gave it to me.</p>

<p>"Dearest, from the beginning of our acquaintance and afterward
when it ripened into friendship and finally became love, upon
you has rested the burden of decision; and I have permitted it.</p>

<p>"Even now, as I am writing here in the studio, the burden lies
heavily upon your girl's shoulders and is weighting your girl's
heart. And it must not be so any longer.</p>

<p>"I have never, perhaps, really meant to be selfish; a man in
love really doesn't know what he means. But now I know what I
have done; and what must be undone.</p>

<p>"You were perfectly right. It was for you to say whether you
would marry me or not. It was for you to decide whether it was
possible or impossible for you to appear as my wife in a world
in which you had had no experience. It was for you to generously
decide whether a rupture between that world and myself&mdash;between
my family and myself&mdash;would render me&mdash;and yourself&mdash;eternally
unhappy.</p>

<p>"You were free to decide; you used your own intellect, and you
so decided. And I had no right to question you &mdash;I have no
right now. I shall never question you again.</p>

<p>"Then, because you loved me, and because it was the kind of love
that ignored self, you offered me a supreme sacrifice. And I did
not refuse; I merely continued to fight for what I thought ought
to be&mdash;distressing, confusing, paining you with the stupid, obstinate
reiterations of my importunities. And you stood fast by your colours.</p>

<p>"Dear, I <em>was</em> wrong. And so were you. Those were not
the only alternatives. I allowed them to appear so because of
selfishness.... Alas, Valerie, in spite of all I have protested
and professed of love and passion for you, to-day, for the first
time, have I really loved you enough to consider you, alone. And
with God's help I will do so always.</p>

<p>"You have offered me two alternatives: to give yourself and your
life to me without marriage; or to quietly slip out of my life
forever.</p>

<p>"And it never occurred to you&mdash;and I say, with shame, that it
never occurred to me&mdash;that I might quietly efface myself and my
demands from <em>your</em> life: leave you free and at peace to
rest and develop in that new and quieter world which your beauty
and goodness has opened to you.</p>

<p>"Desirable people have met you more than half-way, and they like
you. Your little friend, Hélène d'Enver is a genuine and charming
woman. Your friendship for her will mean all that you have so
far missed in life all that a girl is entitled to.</p>

<p>"Through her you will widen the circle of your acquaintances
and form newer and better friendships You will meet men and women
of your own age and your own tastes which is what ought to happen.</p>

<p>"And it is right and just and fair that you enter into the beginning
of your future with a mind unvexed and a heart untroubled by conflicts
which can never solve for you and me any future life together.</p>

<p>"I do not believe you will ever forget me, or wish to, wholly.
Time heals&mdash;otherwise the world had gone mad some centuries ago.</p>

<p>"But whatever destiny is reserved for you, I know you will meet
it with the tranquillity and the sweet courage which you have
always shown.</p>

<p>"What kind of future I wish for you, I need not write here. You
know. And it is for the sake of that future&mdash;for the sake of the
girl whose unselfish life has at last taught me and shamed me,
that I give you up forever.</p>

<p>"Dear, perhaps you had better not answer this for a long, long
time. Then, when that clever surgeon, Time, has effaced all scars&mdash;and
when not only tranquillity is yours but, perhaps, a deeper happiness
is in sight, write and tell me so. And the great god Kelly, nodding
before his easel, will rouse up from his Olympian revery and totter
away to find a sheaf of blessings to bestow upon the finest, truest,
and loveliest girl in all the world.</p>

<p>"<em>Halcyonii dies! Fortem posce animum! Forsan et haec olim
meminisse juvabit. Vale!</em></p>
