<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The chronology of that last dark and bitter week in November
might have been written "necrology."</p>

<p>On Monday Colonel Mallett died about sundown; on Wednesday the
Hon. John D. Ellis, while examining an automatic revolver in his
bath-room, met with one of those unfortunate and fatal accidents
which sometimes happen in times of great financial depression.</p>

<p>Thursday Amos Flack carelessly disappeared, leaving no address;
and on the last day of the week Emanuel Klawber politely excused
himself to a group of very solemn gentlemen who had been assisting
him in the well-known and popular game of "Hunt the Books"; and,
stepping outside the door of the director's office, carefully
destroyed what little life had not already been scared out of
his three-hundred-pound person.</p>

<p>It had been raining all day; Dysart had not felt very well, and
Klawber's unpleasant performance made him ill. He stood in the
rain watching the ambulance arriving at a gallop, then, sickened,
turned away through the dark and dripping crowds, crossed the
street, and, lowering his head against the storm, drove both gloved
hands deep into the pockets of his fashionably cut rain-coat,
and started for home.</p>

<p>It mattered nothing to him that several hard-working newspaper
men might desire to secure his version of Mr. Klawber's taking
off, or of his explanation for it or his sensations concerning
it. It mattered nothing to him that the afternoon papers reported
the arrest of James Skelton, or that Max Moebus had inadvertently,
and no doubt in a moment of intense abstraction, taken a steamer
for Europe and the books of the Shoshone Bank.</p>

<p>These matters, now seemed a great way off&mdash;too unreal to be of
personal moment. He was feeling sick; that occupied his mind.
Also the slush on the sidewalk had wet through his shoes, which
probably was not good for his cough.</p>

<p>It was scarcely two in the afternoon, yet there remained so little
daylight that the electricity burned in the shops along Fifth
Avenue. Through a smutty, grayish gloom, rain drove densely; his
hat and waterproof coat were heavy with it, the bottoms of his
trousers soaked.</p>

<p>Passing the Patroons Club it occurred to him that hot whiskey
might extinguish his cough. The liveried servants at the door,
in the cloak-room&mdash;the page who took his order, the white-headed
butler who had always personally served him, and who served him
now, all hesitated and gazed curiously at him. He paid no attention
at the time but remembered it afterward.</p>

<p>For an hour he sat alone in the vast empty room before a fire
of English cannel coal, taking his hot whiskey and lemon in slow,
absent-minded gulps. Patches of deep colour lay flat under his
cheek-bones, his sunken abstracted eyes never left the coals.</p>

<p>The painted gaze of dead Presidents and Governors looked down
at him from their old-time frames ranged in stately ranks along
the oaken wainscot. Over the mantel the amazing, Hebraic countenance
of a moose leered at him out of little sly, sardonic little eyes,
almost bantering in their evil immobility.</p>

<p>He had presented the trophy to the club after a trip somewhere,
leaving the impression that he had shot it. He seldom looked at
it, never at the silver-engraved inscription on the walnut shield.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, now as he sat there, he thought of the trophy
and looked up at it; and for the first time in his life read the
inscription.</p>

<p>It made no visible impression upon him except that for a brief
moment the small and vivid patches of colour in his wasted cheeks
faintly tinted the general pallor. But this died out as soon as
it appeared; he drank deliberately, set the hot glass on a table
at his elbow, long, bony fingers still retaining a grip upon it.</p>

<p>And into his unconcentrated thoughts, strangely enough, came
the memories of little meannesses which he had committed&mdash;trivial
things that he supposed he had forgotten long ago; and at first,
annoyed, he let memory drift.</p>

<p>But, imperceptibly, from the shallows of these little long-forgotten
meannesses, memory drifted uncontrolled into deeper currents;
and, disdainful, he made no effort to control it; and later, could
not. And for the first time in his life he took the trouble to
understand the reason of his unpopularity among men. He had cared
nothing for them.</p>

<p>He cared nothing for them now, unless that half tolerant, half
disdainful companionship of years with Delancy Grandcourt could
be called caring for a man. If their relations ever had been anything
more than a habit he did not know; on what their friendship had
ever been founded he could not tell. It had been his habit to
take from Delancy, accept, or help himself. He had helped himself
to Rosalie Dene; and not long ago he had accepted all that Delancy
offered, almost convinced at the time that it would disappear
in the debacle when the Algonquin crumbled into a rubbish heap
of rotten securities.</p>

<p>A curious friendship&mdash;and the only friend he ever had had among
men&mdash;stupid, inertly at hand, as inevitably to be counted on as
some battered toy of childhood which escaped the dust heap so
long that custom tolerates its occupation of any closet space
convenient: and habit, at intervals, picks it up to see what's
left of it.</p>

<p>He had finished his whiskey; the fire seemed to have grown too
hot, and he shoved back his chair. But the room, too, was becoming
close, even stifling. Perspiration glistened on his forehead;
he rose and began to wander from room to room, followed always
by the stealthy glances of servants.</p>

<p>The sweat on his face had become unpleasantly cold; he came back
to the fire, endured it for a few moments, then, burning and shivering
at the same time, and preferring the latter sensation, he went
out to his letter-box and unlocked it. There was only one envelope
there, a letter from the governing board of the club requesting
his resignation.</p>

<p>The possibility of such an event had never occurred to him; he
read the letter again, folded and placed it in his pocket, went
back to the fire with the idea of burning it, took it out, read
it again, folded it absently, and replaced it in his pocket.</p>

<p>At that time, except for the dull surprise, the episode did not
seem to affect him particularly. So many things had been accumulating,
so many matters had been menacing him, that one cloud more among
the dark, ominous masses gathering made no deeper impression than
slight surprise.</p>

<p>For a while he stood motionless, hands in his trousers' pockets,
head lowered; then, as somebody entered the farther door, he turned
instinctively and stepped into a private card room, closing the
polished mahogany door. The door opened a moment later and Delancy
Grandcourt walked in.</p>

<p>"Hello," he said briefly. Dysart, by the window, looked around
at him without any expression whatever.</p>

<p>"Have you heard about Klawber?" asked Delancy. "They're calling
the extra."</p>

<p>Dysart looked out of the window. "That's fast work," he said.</p>

<p>Grandcourt stood for a while in silence, then seated himself,
saying:</p>

<p>"He ought to have lived and tried to make good."</p>

<p>"He couldn't."</p>

<p>"He ought to have tried. What's the good of lying down that way?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I guess he was tired."</p>

<p>"That doesn't relieve his creditors."</p>

<p>"No, but it relieves Klawber."</p>

<p>Grandcourt said: "You always view things from that side, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"What side?"</p>

<p>"That of personal convenience."</p>

<p>"Yes. Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Where is it landing you?"</p>

<p>"I haven't gone into that very thoroughly." There was a trace
of irritation in Dysart's voice; he passed one hand over his forehead;
it was icy, and the hair on it damp. "What the devil do you want
of me, anyway?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing.... I have never wanted anything of you, have I?"</p>

<p>Dysart walked the width of the room, then the length of it, then
came and stood by the table, resting on it with one thin hand,
in which his damp handkerchief was crushed to a wad.</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> is it you've got to say, Delancy? Is it about
that loan?"</p>

<p>"No. Have you heard a word out of me about it?"</p>

<p>"You've been devilish glum. Good God, I don't blame you; I ought
not to have touched it; I must have been crazy to let you try
to help me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It was my affair. What I choose to do concerns myself," said
Grandcourt, his heavy, troubled face turning redder. "And, Jack,
I understand that my father is making things disagreeable for
you. I've told him not to; and you mustn't let it worry you, because
what I had was my own and what I did with it my own business."</p>

<p>"Anyway," observed Dysart, after a moment's reflection, "your
family is wealthy."</p>

<p>A darker flush stained Grandcourt's face; and Dysart's misinterpretation
of his philosophy almost stung him into fierce retort; but as
his heavy lips unclosed in anger, his eyes fell on Dysart's ravaged
face, and he sat silent, his personal feelings merged in an evergrowing
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Why do you cough like that, Jack?" he demanded after a paroxysm
had shaken the other into an armchair, where he lay sweating and
panting:</p>

<p>"It's a cold," Dysart managed to say; "been hanging on for a
month."</p>

<p>"Three months," said Grandcourt tersely. "Why don't you take
care of it?"</p>

<p>There was a silence; nothing more was said about the cold; and
presently Grandcourt drew a letter from his pocket and handed
it silently to Dysart. It was in Rosalie's handwriting, dated
two months before, and directed to Dysart at Baltimore. The post-office
authorities had marked it, "No address," and had returned it a
few days since to the sender.</p>

<p>These details Dysart noticed on the envelope and the heading
of the first page; he glanced over a line or two, lowered the
letter, and looked questioningly over it at Grandcourt:</p>

<p>"What's it about?&mdash;if you know," he asked wearily. "I'm not inclined
just now to read anything that may be unpleasant."</p>

<p>Grandcourt said quietly:</p>

<p>"I have not read the letter, but your wife has told me something
of what it contains. She wrote and mailed it to you weeks ago&mdash;before
the crash&mdash;saying, I believe, that adversity was not the time
for the settlement of domestic differences, and that if her private
fortune could avert disaster, you were to write immediately to
her attorneys."</p>

<p>Dysart gazed at him as though stunned; then his dull gaze fell
once more on the envelope. He examined it, went all over it with
lack-lustre eyes, laid it aside, and finally began to read his
wife's letter&mdash;the letter that had never reached him because he
had used another name on the hotel register in Baltimore.</p>

<p>Grandcourt watched him with painful interest as he sat, hunched
up, coughing at intervals, and poring over his wife's long, angular
chirography. There was much between the lines to read, but Dysart
could never read it; much to understand, but he could never understand
it.</p>

<p>
"Delancy tells me," she wrote, "that you are threatened with very<br/>
serious difficulties. Once or twice you yourself have said as much<br/>
to me; and my answer was that they no longer concerned me.

</p>
<p>
"The situation is this: I have, as you know, consulted counsel with<br/>
a view to begin proceedings for a separation. This has been<br/>
discontinued&mdash;temporarily, at any rate&mdash;because I have been led to<br/>
believe by your friend, Delancy Grandcourt, that the present is no<br/>
time to add to your perplexities.

</p>
<p>
"He has, I may add, induced me to believe other things which my<br/>
better sense rejects; but no woman's logic&mdash;which is always half<br/>
sentiment&mdash;could remain unshaken by the simple loyalty to you and to<br/>
me of this friend of yours and of mine. And this letter would never<br/>
have been written except, practically, at his dictation. Kindly<br/>
refrain from showing it to him as my acknowledgment here of his<br/>
influence in the matter would grieve him very deeply.

</p>
<p>
"Because he believes that it is still possible for you and me to<br/>
return to civilised relations; he believes that I care for you,<br/>
that, in your own leisurely and superficial fashion, you still<br/>
really honour the vows that bound you&mdash;still in your heart care for<br/>
me. Let him believe it; and if you will, for his sake, let us resume<br/>
the surface semblance of a common life which, until he persuaded me,<br/>
I was determined to abandon.

</p>
<p>
"It is an effort to write this; I do it for his sake, and, in that<br/>
way, for yours. I don't think you care about me; I don't think you<br/>
ever did or ever will. Yet you must know how it was with me until I<br/>
could endure my isolation no longer. And I say to you perfectly<br/>
frankly that now I care more for this friend of yours, Delancy<br/>
Grandcourt, than I care for anybody in the world. Which is why I<br/>
write you to offer what I have offered, and to say that if my<br/>
private fortune can carry you through the disaster which is so<br/>
plainly impending, please write to my attorneys at once as they have<br/>
all power in the matter."

</p>
</div>
<p>The postscript was dated ten days later, from Dysart's own house:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Receiving no reply, I telephoned you, but Brandon says you are away<br/>
from the city on business and have left no address, so I took the<br/>
liberty of entering your house, selecting this letter from the mass<br/>
of nine days' old mail awaiting you, and shall direct it to you at<br/>
the hotel in Baltimore where Bunny Gray says that somebody has seen<br/>
you several times with a Mr. Skelton."

</p>
</div>
<p>As Dysart read, he wiped the chilly perspiration from his haggard
face at intervals, never taking his eyes from the written pages.
And at last he finished his wife's letter, sat very silent, save
when the cough shook him, the sheets of the letter lying loosely
in his nerveless hand.</p>

<p>It was becoming plain to him, in a confused sort of way, that
something beside bad luck and his own miscalculations, was working
against him&mdash;had been stealthily moving toward his undoing for
a year, now; something occult, sinister, inexorable.</p>

<p>He thought of the register at the hotel in Baltimore, of the
name he lived under there during that interval in his career for
which he had accounted to nobody, and never would account&mdash;on
earth. And into his memory rose the pale face of Sylvia Quest;
and he looked down at the letter trembling in his hand and thought
of her and of his wife and of the Algonquin Trust Company, and
of the chances of salvation he had missed.</p>

<p>Grandcourt sat looking at him; there was something in his gaze
almost doglike:</p>

<p>"Have you read it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Dysart glanced up abstractedly: "Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it what I told you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;substantially." He dried his damp face; "it comes rather
late, you know."</p>

<p>"Not <em>too</em> late," said the other, mistaking him; "your
wife is still ready to meet you half-way, Jack."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;that? I meant the Algonquin matter&mdash;" He checked himself,
seeing for the first time in his life contempt distorting Grandcourt's
heavy face.</p>

<p>"Man! Man!" he said thickly, "is there nothing in that letter
for you except money offered?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I say, is there nothing in that message to you that touches
the manhood in you?"</p>

<p>"You don't know what is in it," said Dysart listlessly. Even
Grandcourt's contempt no longer produced any sensation; he looked
at the letter, tore it into long strips, crumpled them and stood
up with a physical effort:</p>

<p>"I'm going to burn this. Have you anything else to say?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Good God, Jack, <em>don't</em> you care for your wife?
<em>Can't</em> you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." His tone became querulous. "How can a man tell
why he becomes indifferent to a woman? I don't know. I never did
know. I can't explain it. But he does."</p>

<p>Grandcourt stared at him. And suddenly the latent fear that had
been torturing him for the last two weeks died out utterly: this
man would never need watching to prevent any attempt at self-destruction;
this man before him was not of that caste. His self-centred absorption
was of a totally different nature.</p>

<p>He said, very red in the face, but with a voice well modulated
and even:</p>

<p>"I think I've made a good deal of an ass of myself. I think I
may safely be cast for that rôle in future. Most people, including
yourself, think I'm fitted for it; and most people, and yourself,
are right. And I'll admit it now by taking the liberty of asking
you whom you were with in Baltimore."</p>

<p>"None of your damned business!" said Dysart, wheeling short on
him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. I did not believe it at the time, but I do now....
And her brother is after you with a gun."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That you'd better get out of town unless you want an uglier
scandal on your hands."</p>

<p>Dysart stood breathing fast and with such effort that his chest
moved visibly as the lungs strained under the tension:</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that drunken whelp suspects anything so&mdash;so
wildly absurd&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Which drunken whelp? There are several in town?"</p>

<p>Dysart glared at him, careless of what he might now believe.</p>

<p>"I take it you mean that little cur, Quest."</p>

<p>"Yes, I happen to mean Quest."</p>

<p>Dysart gave an ugly laugh and turned short on his heel:</p>

<p>"The whole damn lot of you make me sick," he said. "So does this
club."</p>

<p>A servant held his rain-coat and handed him his hat; he shook
his bent shoulders, stifled a cough, and went out into the rain.</p>

<p>In his own home his little old father, carefully be-wigged, painted,
cleaned and dressed, came trotting into the lamp-lit living-room
fresh from the ministrations of his valet.</p>

<p>"There you are, Jack!&mdash;te-he! Oh, yes, there you are, you young
dog!&mdash;all a-drip with rain for the love o' the ladies, eh, Jack?
Te-he&mdash;one's been here to see you&mdash;a little white doll in chinchillas,
and scared to death at my civilities&mdash;as though she knew the Dysarts&mdash;te-he!
Oh, yes, the Dysarts, Jack. But it was monstrous imprudent, my
son&mdash;and a good thing that your wife remains at Lenox so late
this season&mdash;te-he! A lucky thing, you young dog! And what the
devil do you mean by it&mdash;eh? What d'ye mean, I say!"</p>

<p>Leering, peering, his painted lips pursed up, the little old
man seated himself, gazing with dim, restless eyes at the shadowy
blur which represented to him his handsome son&mdash;a Dysart all through,
elegant, debonair, resistless, and, married or single, fatal to
feminine peace of mind. Generations ago Dysarts had been shot
very conventionally at ten paces owing to this same debonair resistlessness;
Dysarts had slipped into and out of all sorts of unsavoury messes
on account of this fatal family failing; some had been neatly
winged, some thrust through; some, in a more sordid age, permitted
counsel of ability to explain to a jury how guiltless a careless
gentleman could be under the most unfortunate and extenuating
appearances.</p>

<p>The son stood in his wet clothes, haggard, lined, ghastly in
contrast to the startling red of his lips, looking at his smirking
father: then he leaned over and touched a bell.</p>

<p>"Who was it who called on Mrs. Dysart?" he asked, as a servant
appeared.</p>

<p>"Miss Quest, sir," said the man, accepting the cue with stolid
philosophy.</p>

<p>"Did Miss Quest leave any message?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir: Miss Quest desired <em>Mrs.</em> Dysart to telephone
her on <em>Mrs.</em> Dysart's return from&mdash;the country, sir&mdash;it
being a matter of very great importance."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"Thank <em>you</em>, sir."</p>

<p>The servant withdrew; the son stood gazing into the hallway.
Behind him his father mumbled and muttered and chuckled to himself
in his easy-chair by the fire!</p>

<p>"Te-he! They are all alike, the Dysarts&mdash;oh, yes, all alike!
And now it's that young dog &mdash;Jack!&mdash;te-he!&mdash;yes, it's Jack,
now! But he's a good son, my boy Jack; he's a good son to me and
he's all Dysart, all Dysart; bon chien chasse de race!&mdash;te-he!
Oui, ma fois!&mdash;bon chien chasse de race."</p>
