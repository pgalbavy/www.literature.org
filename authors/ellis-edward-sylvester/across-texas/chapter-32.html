<p><em>SUFFICIENT </em>has been told to show that Eph Bozeman’s
stealthy approach to the mission building was attended by one
stirring incident, if not more.</p>

<p>Leaving his comrades on the crest of the elevation, he strode
forward at a rapid pace, until he had passed most of the intervening
distance. Then he slackened his gait and crouched low, his body
bent, until he resembled a person gathering himself for a powerful
leap. This was his favorite posture when engaged upon such dangerous
business, and he kept it until prudence told him there was too
great a risk attending it.</p>

<p>His object was to defer creeping to the last moment, since his
progress must become slower, but he was too much of a veteran
to allow the question of convenience to detract from his vigilance.</p>

<p>At the point he had fixed in his mind he sank to the ground,
and began using his hands and knees, not the most agreeable form
of locomotion, since, as will be remembered, he carried his heavy
rifle with him.</p>

<p>As yet he had seen and heard nothing of the Apaches, but believed
a brush with them was inevitable before he could enter the building.
He reasoned that since they knew of the presence of the white
men inside, and were unaware of the others outside, they would
devote themselves to circling about the structure, and maintaining
a sharp lookout that none of the occupants got away during the
night. The prospect of adding two or three more victims to the
long list of massacres they had committed in the Southwest was
too tempting to be passed by, until all prospect of success was
gone.</p>

<p>The trapper’s belief was that the warriors would remain mounted,
though he was too experienced to guide his own movements upon
that theory alone.</p>

<p>So long as he kept his position close to the earth, he could
discover the approach of a horseman before the latter saw him,
to say nothing of the slight noise of the pony’s hoofs, which
was sure to betray him.</p>

<p>Twice he caught the latter sound, and ceasing his progress lay
flat, listening and peering around in the gloom; but the riders
did not come nigh enough for him to discern them; and after a
brief wait he resumed his slow and laborious progress.</p>

<p>From what had taken place, he was absolutely certain that the
Apaches had no suspicion that any whites were near the building.
It followed therefore that no precaution had been taken against
his approach, but they were vigilant enough to demand all the
subtlety he possessed.</p>

<p>He was creeping forward in his guarded manner when, without the
least warning, he saw the outlines of a figure in front, which,
although dimly observed, he knew was one of the Apaches.</p>

<p>The trapper sank down again, with his keen eyes fixed on the
warrior, who was standing with his back toward him, apparently
studying the ground in the direction of the building, which was
too far off to be seen, since Eph himself could not catch the
most shadowy outlines of it.</p>

<p>Since the Apache had not observed the white man, there was no
cause why he should do so, unless accident should lead him to
face about. Without waiting a moment Eph began retreating, keeping
his gaze on the redskin, who faded almost from view in the gloom.</p>

<p>Then the trapper turned to the right and resumed his advance
toward the building. Time was too valuable to wait for the Indian
to shift his position, which, as likely as not, would prove unfavorable.</p>

<p>The flank movement was so regulated that he kept his enemy dimly
in sight, for he did not mean to be surprised by any sudden action
on his part.</p>

<p>All this was well enough, but the Apache overthrew the whole
scheme by an unexpected movement.</p>

<p>The trapper was on his right, and a couple of rods distant, when
the warrior seemed to conclude that it was time for him to do
something. He stepped off at his usual pace, which would have
carried him speedily beyond sight had Eph been somewhere else,
but unfortunately he moved straight toward the old hunter.</p>

<p>To retreat or advance would have been certain betrayal, and Eph
did not attempt it. Instead, he silently drew his pistol and grasped
it, ready for firing.</p>

<p>The Apache had no thought of anything of this kind, but he had
taken less than three paces, when he discovered the figure on
the earth in front of him. He uttered no outcry, but stopped and
placed his hand at his waist, as if to draw a weapon therefrom.
He, too, carried a gun, most likely a Winchester, and was expert
in its use. He had no blanket, his body being bare above the waist,
and his long, coarse hair dangled about his shoulders. He was
much shorter and smaller in every way than the white man, but
every ounce of his body was like that of a tiger.</p>

<p>The Indian might have brought instant help by a signal, but to
do that would have been a confession that he was afraid to attack
a single individual, and the warrior "wasn’t that sort of a fellow."</p>

<p>His pause was only momentary. He stooped down like an animal
about to leap across a chasm and the trapper caught a movement
of his right hand, which convinced him the warrior had drawn a
knife and meant to spring upon him.</p>

<p>Eph’s revolver was leveled at the savage, who was still stealing
forward when a single chamber was discharged. The shot was unerring,
and (what was singular in the case of an American Indian) he sank
downward without any outcry.</p>

<p>The trapper needed no one to tell him what next to do. He knew
the report of his weapon would bring nearly if not all the other
Apaches to the spot, and he could not get away too soon. Springing
to his feet, he loped swiftly toward the building, never pausing
until he stood in front of the broad door.</p>

<p>He glanced keenly to the right and left while making this run,
but though he heard the sounds of hoofs, he saw none of the raiders
eager for the chance to cut him down.</p>

<p>Within a half minute after the shot was fired an Apache reached
the spot on his pony, and was quickly joined by five others, all
mounted. The prostrate figure told the story, but the author of
their comrade’s death was gone.</p>

<p>While one of them lifted the inanimate figure upon his steed,
the others separated to find the white man who had slain him.
They did this with rare skill, but they were misled from the start.
Knowing nothing of those outside the building, their supposition
must have been that one of them had stolen out of the structure
and gained this point before discovery. It was not to be supposed
that he was striving to enter instead of leave the place, and
they therefore widened the circle, when they should have contracted
it.</p>
