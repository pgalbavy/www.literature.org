<p>
The ones of us who had started the Society of the Wouldbegoods
began, at about this time, to bother.</p>

<p>They said we had not done anything really noble -  not worth
speaking of, that is - for over a week, and that it was high time to
begin again - 'with earnest endeavour', Daisy said.  So then Oswald
said - </p>

<p>'All right; but there ought to be an end to everything.  Let's each
of us think of one really noble and unselfish act, and the others
shall help to work it out, like we did when we were Treasure
Seekers.  Then when everybody's had their go-in we'll write every
single thing down in the Golden Deed book, and we'll draw two lines
in red ink at the bottom, like Father does at the end of an
account.  And after that, if anyone wants to be good they can jolly
well be good on our own, if at all.'</p>

<p>The ones who had made the Society did not welcome this wise idea,
but Dicky and Oswald were firm.</p>

<p>So they had to agree.  When Oswald is really firm, opposingness and
obstinacy have to give way.</p>

<p>Dora said, 'It would be a noble action to have all the
school-children from the village and give them tea and games in the
paddock.  They would think it so nice and good of us.'</p>

<p>But Dicky showed her that this would not be OUR good act, but
Father's, because he would have to pay for the tea, and he had
already stood us the keepsakes for the soldiers, as well as having
to stump up heavily over the coal barge.  And it is in vain being
noble and generous when someone else is paying for it all the time,
even if it happens to be your father.  Then three others had ideas
at the same time and began to explain what they were.</p>

<p>We were all in the dining-room, and perhaps we were making a bit of
a row.  Anyhow, Oswald for one, does not blame Albert's uncle for
opening his door and saying - </p>

<p>'I suppose I must not ask for complete silence.  That were too
much.  But if you could whistle, or stamp with your feet, or shriek
or howl - anything to vary the monotony of your well-sustained
conversation.'</p>

<p>Oswald said kindly, 'We're awfully sorry.  Are you busy?'</p>

<p>'Busy?' said Albert's uncle.  'My heroine is now hesitating on the
verge of an act which, for good or ill, must influence her whole
subsequent career.  You wouldn't like her to decide in the middle
of such a row that she can't hear herself think?'</p>

<p>We said, 'No, we wouldn't.'</p>

<p>Then he said, 'If any outdoor amusement should commend itself to
you this bright mid-summer day.'  So we all went out.</p>

<p>Then Daisy whispered to Dora - they always hang together.  Daisy is
not nearly so white-micey as she was at first, but she still seems
to fear the deadly ordeal of public speaking.  Dora said - </p>

<p>'Daisy's idea is a game that'll take us all day.  She thinks
keeping out of the way when he's making his heroine decide right
would be a noble act, and fit to write in the Golden Book; and we
might as well be playing something at the same time.'</p>

<p>We all said 'Yes, but what?'</p>

<p>There was a silent interval.</p>

<p>'Speak up, Daisy, my child.'  Oswald said; 'fear not to lay bare
the utmost thoughts of that faithful heart.'</p>

<p>Daisy giggled.  Our own girls never giggle - they laugh right out or
hold their tongues.  Their kind brothers have taught them this. 
Then Daisy said - </p>

<p>'If we could have a sort of play to keep us out of the way.  I once
read a story about an animal race.  Everybody had an animal, and
they had to go how they liked, and the one that got in first got
the prize.  There was a tortoise in it, and a rabbit, and a
peacock, and sheep, and dogs, and a kitten.'</p>

<p>This proposal left us cold, as Albert's uncle says, because we knew
there could not be any prize worth bothering about.  And though you
may be ever ready and willing to do anything for nothing, yet if
there's going to be a prize there must BE a prize and there's an
end of it.</p>

<p>Thus the idea was not followed up.  Dicky yawned and said, 'Let's
go into the barn and make a fort.'</p>

<p>So we did, with straw.  It does not hurt straw to be messed about
with like it does hay.</p>

<p>The downstairs - I mean down-ladder - part of the barn was fun too,
especially for Pincher.  There was as good ratting there as you
could wish to see.  Martha tried it, but she could not help running
kindly beside the rat, as if she was in double harness with it. 
This is the noble bull-dog's gentle and affectionate nature coming
out.  We all enjoyed the ratting that day, but it ended, as usual,
in the girls crying because of the poor rats.  Girls cannot help
this; we must not be waxy with them on account of it, they have
their nature, the same as bull-dogs have, and it is this that makes
them so useful in smoothing the pillows of the sick-bed and tending
wounded heroes.</p>

<p>However, the forts, and Pincher, and the girls crying, and having
to be thumped on the back, passed the time very agreeably till
dinner.  There was roast mutton with onion sauce, and a roly-poly
pudding.</p>

<p>Albert's uncle said we had certainly effaced ourselves effectually,
which means we hadn't bothered.</p>

<p>So we determined to do the same during the afternoon, for he told
us his heroine was by no means out of the wood yet.</p>

<p>And at first it was easy.  Jam roly gives you a peaceful feeling
and you do not at first care if you never play any runabout game
ever any more.  But after a while the torpor begins to pass away. 
Oswald was the first to recover from his.</p>

<p>He had been lying on his front part in the orchard, but now he
turned over on his back and kicked his legs up, and said - </p>

<p>'I say, look here; let's do something.'</p>

<p>Daisy looked thoughtful.  She was chewing the soft yellow parts of
grass, but I could see she was still thinking about that animal
race.  So I explained to her that it would be very poor fun without
a tortoise and a peacock, and she saw this, though not willingly.</p>

<p>It was H. O. who said - </p>

<p>'Doing anything with animals is prime, if they only will.  Let's
have a circus!'</p>

<p>At the word the last thought of the pudding faded from Oswald's
memory, and he stretched himself, sat up, and said - </p>

<p>'Bully for H. O.  Let's!'</p>

<p>The others also threw off the heavy weight of memory, and sat up
and said 'Let's!' too.</p>

<p>Never, never in all our lives had we had such a gay galaxy of
animals at our command.  The rabbits and the guinea-pigs, and even
all the bright, glass-eyed, stuffed denizens of our late-lamented
jungle paled into insignificance before the number of live things
on the farm.</p>

<p>(I hope you do not think that the words I use are getting too long.
I know they are the right words.  And Albert's uncle says your
style is always altered a bit by what you read.  And I have been
reading the Vicomte de Bragelonne.  Nearly all my new words come
out of those.)</p>

<p>'The worst of a circus is,' Dora said, 'that you've got to teach
the animals things.  A circus where the performing creatures hadn't
learned performing would be a bit silly.  Let's give up a week to
teaching them and then have the circus.'</p>

<p>Some people have no idea of the value of time.  And Dora is one of
those who do not understand that when you want to do a thing you do
want to, and not to do something else, and perhaps your own thing,
a week later.</p>

<p>Oswald said the first thing was to collect the performing animals.</p>

<p>'Then perhaps,' he said, 'we may find that they have hidden talents
hitherto unsuspected by their harsh masters.'</p>

<p>So Denny took a pencil and wrote a list of the animals required. 
This is it:</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>LIST OF ANIMALS REQUISITE FOR THE<br />
CIRCUS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>1 Bull for bull-fight.
1 Horse for ditto (if possible).
1 Goat to do Alpine feats of daring.
1 Donkey to play see-saw.
2 White pigs - one to be Learned, and the other to play with the
     clown.
Turkeys, as many as possible, because they can make a noise that
     sounds like an audience applauding.
The dogs, for any odd parts.
1 Large black pig - to be the Elephant in the procession.
Calves (several) to be camels, and to stand on tubs.</p>

<p>Daisy ought to have been captain because it was partly her idea,
but she let Oswald be, because she is of a retiring character. 
Oswald said - </p>

<p>'The first thing is to get all the creatures together; the paddock
at the side of the orchard is the very place, because the hedge is
good all round.  When we've got the performers all there we'll make
a programme, and then dress for our parts.  It's a pity there won't
be any audience but the turkeys.'</p>

<p>We took the animals in their right order, according to Denny's
list.  The bull was the first.  He is black.  He does not live in
the cowhouse with the other horned people; he has a house all to
himself two fields away.  Oswald and Alice went to fetch him.  They
took a halter to lead the bull by, and a whip, not to hurt the bull
with, but just to make him mind.</p>

<p>The others were to try to get one of the horses while we were gone.</p>

<p>Oswald as usual was full of bright ideas.</p>

<p>'I daresay,' he said, 'the bull will be shy at first, and he'll
have to be goaded into the arena.'</p>

<p>'But goads hurt,' Alice said.</p>

<p>'They don't hurt the bull,' Oswald said; 'his powerful hide is too
thick.'</p>

<p>'Then why does he attend to it,' Alice asked, 'if it doesn't hurt?'</p>

<p>'Properly-brought-up bulls attend because they know they ought,'
Oswald said.  'I think I shall ride the bull,' the brave boy went
on.  'A bull-fight, where an intrepid rider appears on the bull,
sharing its joys and sorrows.  It would be something quite new.'</p>

<p>'You can't ride bulls,' Alice said; 'at least, not if their backs
are sharp like cows.'</p>

<p>But Oswald thought he could.  The bull lives in a house made of
wood and prickly furze bushes, and he has a yard to his house.  You
cannot climb on the roof of his house at all comfortably.</p>

<p>When we got there he was half in his house and half out in his
yard, and he was swinging his tail because of the flies which
bothered.  It was a very hot day.</p>

<p>'You'll see,' Alice said, 'he won't want a goad.  He'll be so glad
to get out for a walk he'll drop his head in my hand like a tame
fawn, and follow me lovingly all the way.'</p>

<p>Oswald called to him.  He said, 'Bull! Bull! Bull! Bull!' because
we did not know the animal's real name.  The bull took no notice;
then Oswald picked up a stone and threw it at the bull, not
angrily, but just to make it pay attention.  But the bull did not
pay a farthing's worth of it.  So then Oswald leaned over the iron
gate of the bull's yard and just flicked the bull with the
whiplash.  And then the bull DID pay attention.  He started when
the lash struck him, then suddenly he faced round, uttering a roar
like that of the wounded King of Beasts, and putting his head down
close to his feet he ran straight at the iron gate where we were
standing.</p>

<p>Alice and Oswald mechanically turned away; they did not wish to
annoy the bull any more, and they ran as fast as they could across
the field so as not to keep the others waiting.</p>

<p>As they ran across the field Oswald had a dream-like fancy that
perhaps the bull had rooted up the gate with one paralysing blow,
and was now tearing across the field after him and Alice, with the
broken gate balanced on its horns.  We climbed the stile quickly
and looked back; the bull was still on the right side of the gate.</p>

<p>Oswald said, 'I think we'll do without the bull.  He did not seem
to want to come.  We must be kind to dumb animals.'</p>

<p>Alice said, between laughing and crying - </p>

<p>'Oh, Oswald, how can you!' But we did do without the bull, and we
did not tell the others how we had hurried to get back.  We just
said, 'The bull didn't seem to care about coming.'</p>

<p>The others had not been idle.  They had got old Clover, the
cart-horse, but she would do nothing but graze, so we decided not
to use her in the bull-fight, but to let her be the Elephant.  The
Elephant's is a nice quiet part, and she was quite big enough for
a young one.  Then the black pig could be Learned, and the other
two could be something else.  They had also got the goat; he was
tethered to a young tree.</p>

<p>The donkey was there.  Denny was leading him in the halter.  The
dogs were there, of course - they always are.</p>

<p>So now we only had to get the turkeys for the applause and the
calves and pigs.</p>

<p>The calves were easy to get, because they were in their own house. 
There were five.  And the pigs were in their houses too.  We got
them out after long and patient toil, and persuaded them that they
wanted to go into the paddock, where the circus was to be.  This is
done by pretending to drive them the other way.  A pig only knows
two ways - the way you want him to go, and the other.  But the
turkeys knew thousands of different ways, and tried them all.  They
made such an awful row, we had to drop all ideas of ever hearing
applause from their lips, so we came away and left them.</p>

<p>'Never mind,' H. O. said, 'they'll be sorry enough afterwards,
nasty, unobliging things, because now they won't see the circus. 
I hope the other animals will tell them about it.'</p>

<p>While the turkeys were engaged in baffling the rest of us, Dicky
had found three sheep who seemed to wish to join the glad throng,
so we let them.</p>

<p>Then we shut the gate of the paddock, and left the dumb circus
performers to make friends with each other while we dressed.</p>

<p>Oswald and H. O. were to be clowns.  It is quite easy with Albert's
uncle's pyjamas, and flour on your hair and face, and the red they
do the brick-floors with.</p>

<p>Alice had very short pink and white skirts, and roses in her hair
and round her dress.  Her dress was the pink calico and white
muslin stuff off the dressing-table in the girls' room fastened
with pins and tied round the waist with a small bath towel.  She
was to be the Dauntless Equestrienne, and to give her enhancing act
a barebacked daring, riding either a pig or a sheep, whichever we
found was freshest and most skittish.  Dora was dressed for the
Haute ecole, which means a riding-habit and a high hat.  She took
Dick's topper that he wears with his Etons, and a skirt of Mrs
Pettigrew's.  Daisy, dressed the same as Alice, taking the muslin
from Mrs Pettigrew's dressing-table with- out saying anything
beforehand.  None of us would have advised this, and indeed we were
thinking of trying to put it back, when Denny and Noel, who were
wishing to look like highwaymen, with brown-paper top-boots and
slouch hats and Turkish towel cloaks, suddenly stopped dressing and
gazed out of the window.</p>

<p>'Krikey!' said Dick, 'come on, Oswald!' and he bounded like an
antelope from the room.</p>

<p>Oswald and the rest followed, casting a hasty glance through the
window.  Noel had got brown-paper boots too, and a Turkish towel
cloak.  H. O. had been waiting for Dora to dress him up for the
other clown.  He had only his shirt and knickerbockers and his
braces on.  He came down as he was - as indeed we all did.  And no
wonder, for in the paddock, where the circus was to be, a
blood-thrilling thing had transpired.  The dogs were chasing the
sheep.  And we had now lived long enough in the country to know the
fell nature of our dogs' improper conduct.</p>

<p>We all rushed into the paddock, calling to Pincher, and Martha, and
Lady.  Pincher came almost at once.  He is a well-brought-up
dog - Oswald trained him.  Martha did not seem to hear.  She is
awfully deaf, but she did not matter so much, because the sheep
could walk away from her easily.  She has no pace and no wind.  But
Lady is a deer-hound.  She is used to pursuing that fleet and
antlered pride of the forest - the stag - and she can go like
billyo.  She was now far away in a distant region of the paddock,
with a fat sheep just before her in full flight.  I am sure if ever
anybody's eyes did start out of their heads with horror, like in
narratives of adventure, ours did then.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause of speechless horror.  We expected to
see Lady pull down her quarry, and we know what a lot of money a
sheep costs, to say nothing of its own personal feelings.</p>

<p>Then we started to run for all we were worth.  It is hard to run
swiftly as the arrow from the bow when you happen to be wearing
pyjamas belonging to a grown-up person - as I was - but even so I
beat Dicky.  He said afterwards it was because his brown-paper
boots came undone and tripped him up.  Alice came in third.  She
held on the dressing-table muslin and ran jolly well.  But ere we
reached the fatal spot all was very nearly up with the sheep.  We
heard a plop; Lady stopped and looked round.  She must have heard
us bellowing to her as we ran.  Then she came towards us, prancing
with happiness, but we said 'Down!' and 'Bad dog!' and ran sternly
on.</p>

<p>When we came to the brook which forms the northern boundary of the
paddock we saw the sheep struggling in the water.  It is not very
deep, and I believe the sheep could have stood up, and been well in
its depth, if it had liked, but it would not try.</p>

<p>It was a steepish bank.  Alice and I got down and stuck our legs
into the water, and then Dicky came down, and the three of us
hauled that sheep up by its shoulders till it could rest on Alice
and me as we sat on the bank.  It kicked all the time we were
hauling.  It gave one extra kick at last, that raised it up, and I
tell you that sopping wet, heavy, panting, silly donkey of a sheep
sat there on our laps like a pet dog; and Dicky got his shoulder
under it at the back and heaved constantly to keep it from flumping
off into the water again, while the others fetched the shepherd.</p>

<p>When the shepherd came he called us every name you can think of,
and then he said - </p>

<p>'Good thing master didn't come along.  He would ha' called you some
tidy names.'</p>

<p>He got the sheep out, and took it and the others away.  And the
calves too.  He did not seem to care about the other performing
animals.</p>

<p>Alice, Oswald and Dick had had almost enough circus for just then,
so we sat in the sun and dried ourselves and wrote the programme of
the circus.  This was it:</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>PROGRAMME<br />
</div></blockquote>

<h1 class="hft-headings">1.  Startling leap from the lofty precipice by the performing
sheep.  Real water, and real precipice.  The gallant rescue.  O. A.
and D. Bastable.  (We thought we might as well put
that in though it was over and had happened accidentally.)</h1>

<h1 class="hft-headings">2.  Graceful bare-backed equestrienne act on the trained pig,
Eliza.  A. Bastable.
3.  Amusing clown interlude, introducing trained dog, Pincher, and
the other white pig.  H. O. and O. Bastable.</h1>

<h1 class="hft-headings">4.  The See-Saw.  Trained donkeys.  (H. O. said we had only one
donkey, so Dicky said H. O. could be the other.  When peace was
restored we went on to 5.)</h1>

<h1 class="hft-headings">5.  Elegant equestrian act by D. Bastable.  Haute ecole, on Clover,
the incomparative trained elephant from the plains of Venezuela.</h1>

<h1 class="hft-headings">6.  Alpine feat of daring.  The climbing of the Andes, by Billy,
the well-known acrobatic goat.  (We thought we could make the Andes
out of hurdles and things, and so we could have but for what always
happens.  (This is the unexpected.  (This is a saying Father told
me - but I see I am three deep in brackets so I will close them
before I get into any more).).).</h1>

<h1 class="hft-headings">7.  The Black but Learned Pig.  ('I daresay he knows something,'
Alice said, 'if we can only find out what.'  We DID find out all
too soon.)</h1>

<p>We could not think of anything else, and our things were nearly
dry - all except Dick's brown-paper top-boots, which were mingled
with the gurgling waters of the brook.</p>

<p>We went back to the seat of action - which was the iron trough where
the sheep have their salt put - and began to dress up the creatures.</p>

<p>We had just tied the Union Jack we made out of Daisy's flannel
petticoat and cetera, when we gave the soldiers the baccy, round
the waist of the Black and Learned Pig, when we heard screams from
the back part of the house, and suddenly we saw that Billy, the
acrobatic goat, had got loose from the tree we had tied him to. 
(He had eaten all the parts of its bark that he could get at, but
we did not notice it until next day, when led to the spot by a
grown-up.)</p>

<p>The gate of the paddock was open.  The gate leading to the bridge
that goes over the moat to the back door was open too.  We hastily
proceeded in the direction of the screams, and, guided by the
sound, threaded our way into the kitchen.  As we went, Noel, ever
fertile in melancholy ideas, said he wondered whether Mrs Pettigrew
was being robbed, or only murdered.</p>

<p>In the kitchen we saw that Noel was wrong as usual.  It was
neither.  Mrs Pettigrew, screaming like a steam-siren and waving a
broom, occupied the foreground.  In the distance the maid was
shrieking in a hoarse and monotonous way, and trying to shut
herself up inside a clothes-horse on which washing was being aired.</p>

<p>On the dresser - which he had ascended by a chair - was Billy, the
acrobatic goat, doing his Alpine daring act.  He had found out his
Andes for himself, and even as we gazed he turned and tossed his
head in a way that showed us some mysterious purpose was hidden
beneath his calm exterior.  The next moment he put his off-horn
neatly behind the end plate of the next to the bottom row, and ran
it along against the wall.  The plates fell crashing on to the soup
tureen and vegetable dishes which adorned the lower range of the
Andes.</p>

<p>Mrs Pettigrew's screams were almost drowned in the discarding crash
and crackle of the falling avalanche of crockery.</p>

<p>Oswald, though stricken with horror and polite regret, preserved
the most dauntless coolness.</p>

<p>Disregarding the mop which Mrs Pettigrew kept on poking at the goat
in a timid yet cross way, he sprang forward, crying out to his
trusty followers, 'Stand by to catch him!'</p>

<p>But Dick had thought of the same thing, and ere Oswald could carry
out his long-cherished and general-like design, Dicky had caught
the goat's legs and tripped it up.  The goat fell against another
row of plates, righted itself hastily in the gloomy ruins of the
soup tureen and the sauce-boats, and then fell again, this time
towards Dicky.  The two fell heavily on the ground together.  The
trusty followers had been so struck by the daring of Dicky and his
lion-hearted brother, that they had not stood by to catch anything.</p>

<p>The goat was not hurt, but Dicky had a sprained thumb and a lump on
his head like a black marble door-knob.  He had to go to bed.</p>

<p>I will draw a veil and asterisks over what Mrs Pettigrew said. 
Also Albert's uncle, who was brought to the scene of ruin by her
screams.  Few words escaped our lips.  There are times when it is
not wise to argue; however, little what has occurred is really our
fault.</p>

<p>When they had said what they deemed enough and we were let go, we
all went out.  Then Alice said distractedly, in a voice which she
vainly strove to render firm - </p>

<p>'Let's give up the circus.  Let's put the toys back in the
boxes - no, I don't mean that - the creatures in their places - and
drop the whole thing.  I want to go and read to Dicky.'</p>

<p>Oswald has a spirit that no reverses can depreciate.  He hates to
be beaten.  But he gave in to Alice, as the others said so too, and
we went out to collect the performing troop and sort it out into
its proper places.</p>

<p>Alas! we came too late.  In the interest we had felt about whether
Mrs Pettigrew was the abject victim of burglars or not, we had left
both gates open again.  The old horse - I mean the trained elephant
from Venezuela - was there all right enough.  The dogs we had beaten
and tied up after the first act, when the intrepid sheep bounded,
as it says in the programme.  The two white pigs were there, but
the donkey was gone.  We heard his hoofs down the road, growing
fainter and fainter, in the direction of the 'Rose and Crown'.  And
just round the gatepost we saw a flash of red and white and blue
and black that told us, with dumb signification, that the pig was
off in exactly the opposite direction.  Why couldn't they have gone
the same way?  But no, one was a pig and the other was a donkey, as
Denny said afterwards.</p>

<p>Daisy and H. O. started after the donkey; the rest of us, with one
accord, pursued the pig - I don't know why.  It trotted quietly down
the road; it looked very black against the white road, and the ends
on the top, where the Union Jack was tied, bobbed brightly as it
trotted.  At first we thought it would be easy to catch up to it. 
This was an error.</p>

<p>When we ran faster it ran faster; when we stopped it stopped and
looked round at us, and nodded.  (I daresay you won't swallow this,
but you may safely.  It's as true as true, and so's all that about
the goat.  I give you my sacred word of honour.) I tell you the pig
nodded as much as to say - </p>

<p>'Oh, yes.  You think you will, but you won't!' and then as soon as
we moved again off it went.  That pig led us on and on, o'er miles
and miles of strange country.  One thing, it did keep to the roads.
When we met people, which wasn't often, we called out to them to
help us, but they only waved their arms and roared with laughter. 
One chap on a bicycle almost tumbled off his machine, and then he
got off it and propped it against a gate and sat down in the hedge
to laugh properly.  You remember Alice was still dressed up as the
gay equestrienne in the dressing-table pink and white, with rosy
garlands, now very droopy, and she had no stockings on, only white
sand-shoes, because she thought they would be easier than boots for
balancing on the pig in the graceful bare-backed act.</p>

<p>Oswald was attired in red paint and flour and pyjamas, for a clown.
It is really IMPOSSIBLE to run speedfully in another man's pyjamas,
so Oswald had taken them off, and wore his own brown knickerbockers
belonging to his Norfolks.  He had tied the pyjamas round his neck,
to carry them easily.  He was afraid to leave them in a ditch, as
Alice suggested, because he did not know the roads, and for aught
he recked they might have been infested with footpads.  If it had
been his own pyjamas it would have been different.  (I'm going to
ask for pyjamas next winter, they are so useful in many ways.)</p>

<p>Noel was a highwayman in brown-paper gaiters and bath towels and a
cocked hat of newspaper.  I don't know how he kept it on.  And the
pig was encircled by the dauntless banner of our country.  All the
same, I think if I had seen a band of youthful travellers in bitter
distress about a pig I should have tried to lend a helping hand and
not sat roaring in the hedge, no matter how the travellers and the
pig might have been dressed.</p>

<p>It was hotter than anyone would believe who has never had occasion
to hunt the pig when dressed for quite another part.  The flour got
out of Oswald's hair into his eyes and his mouth.  His brow was wet
with what the village blacksmith's was wet with, and not his fair
brow alone.  It ran down his face and washed the red off in
streaks, and when he rubbed his eyes he only made it worse.  Alice
had to run holding the equestrienne skirts on with both hands, and
I think the brown-paper boots bothered Noel from the first.  Dora
had her skirt over her arm and carried the topper in her hand.  It
was no use to tell ourselves it was a wild boar hunt - we were long
past that.</p>

<p>At last we met a man who took pity on us.  He was a kind-hearted
man.  I think, perhaps, he had a pig of his own - or, perhaps,
children.  Honour to his name!</p>

<p>He stood in the middle of the road and waved his arms.  The pig
right-wheeled through a gate into a private garden and cantered up
the drive.  We followed.  What else were we to do, I should like to
know?</p>

<p>The Learned Black Pig seemed to know its way.  It turned first to
the right and then to the left, and emerged on a lawn.</p>

<p>'Now, all together!' cried Oswald, mustering his failing voice to
give the word of command.  'Surround him! - cut off his retreat!'</p>

<p>We almost surrounded him.  He edged off towards the house.</p>

<p>'Now we've got him!' cried the crafty Oswald, as the pig got on to
a bed of yellow pansies close against the red house wall.</p>

<p>All would even then have been well, but Denny, at the last, shrank
from meeting the pig face to face in a manly way.  He let the pig
pass him, and the next moment, with a squeak that said 'There now!'
as plain as words, the pig bolted into a French window.  The
pursuers halted not.  This was no time for trivial ceremony.  In
another moment the pig was a captive.  Alice and Oswald had their
arms round him under the ruins of a table that had had teacups on
it, and around the hunters and their prey stood the startled
members of a parish society for making clothes for the poor
heathen, that that pig had led us into the very midst of.  They
were reading a missionary report or something when we ran our
quarry to earth under their table.  Even as he crossed the
threshold I heard something about 'black brothers being already
white to the harvest'.  All the ladies had been sewing flannel
things for the poor blacks while the curate read aloud to them. 
You think they screamed when they saw the Pig and Us?  You are
right.</p>

<p>On the whole, I cannot say that the missionary people behaved
badly.  Oswald explained that it was entirely the pig's doing, and
asked pardon quite properly for any alarm the ladies had felt; and
Alice said how sorry we were but really it was NOT our fault this
time.  The curate looked a bit nasty, but the presence of ladies
made him keep his hot blood to himself.</p>

<p>When we had explained, we said, 'Might we go?' The curate said,
'The sooner the better.'  But the Lady of the House asked for our
names and addresses, and said she should write to our Father.  (She
did, and we heard of it too.) They did not do anything to us, as
Oswald at one time believed to be the curate's idea.  They let us
go.</p>

<p>And we went, after we had asked for a piece of rope to lead the pig
by.</p>

<p>'In case it should come back into your nice room,' Alice said. 
'And that would be such a pity, wouldn't it?'</p>

<p>A little girl in a starched pinafore was sent for the rope.  And as
soon as the pig had agreed to let us tie it round his neck we came
away.  The scene in the drawing-room had not been long.  The pig
went slowly,</p>

<p>'Like the meandering brook,'</p>

<p>Denny said.  just by the gate the shrubs rustled and opened, and
the little girl came out.  Her pinafore was full of cake.</p>

<p>'Here,' she said.  'You must be hungry if you've come all that way.</p>

<p>I think they might have given you some tea after all the trouble
you've had.'  We took the cake with correct thanks.</p>

<p>'I wish I could play at circuses,' she said.  'Tell me about it.'</p>

<p>We told her while we ate the cake; and when we had done she said
perhaps it was better to hear about than do, especially the goat's
part and Dicky's.</p>

<p>'But I do wish auntie had given you tea,' she said.</p>

<p>We told her not to be too hard on her aunt, because you have to
make allowances for grown-up people.  When we parted she said she
would never forget us, and Oswald gave her his pocket button-hook
and corkscrew combined for a keepsake.</p>

<p>Dicky's act with the goat (which is true, and no kid) was the only
thing out of that day that was put in the Golden Deed book, and he
put that in himself while we were hunting the pig.</p>

<p>Alice and me capturing the pig was never put in.  We would scorn to
write our own good actions, but I suppose Dicky was dull with us
all away; and you must pity the dull, and not blame them.</p>

<p>I will not seek to unfold to you how we got the pig home, or how
the donkey was caught (that was poor sport compared to the pig). 
Nor will I tell you a word of all that was said and done to the
intrepid hunters of the Black and Learned.  I have told you all the
interesting part.  Seek not to know the rest.  It is better buried
in obliquity.</p>
