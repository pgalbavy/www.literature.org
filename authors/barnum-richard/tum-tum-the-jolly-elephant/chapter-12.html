<p>Tum Tum tried to get in front of Sharp Tooth and stop the tiger from
getting out of his cage, but the big elephant was not quick enough.
Besides, the tiger moved so swiftly, that hardly any one could have
stopped him.
</p><p>"Come back here! Come back!" cried Tum Tum, when he saw Sharp Tooth
running out of the tent.
</p><p>"Indeed I will not! I'm off to the jungle!" snarled the striped beast.
"Come on, Roarer!" she called.
</p><p>But Roarer could not, for Maggo, the big elephant, had placed herself in
front of the door of his cage, and was leaning against it. And Maggo was
so big and heavy that Roarer could not push open the iron-barred door.
</p><p>"Get out of my way!" cried the lion to the elephant.
</p><p>"No, no! I will not!" answered brave Maggo.
</p><p>Then the lion put his paws through the bars of the cage and scratched
Maggo, but the lady elephant did not mind that. She made a loud noise
through her trunk, and this call brought the keepers on the run. One of
them saw what the matter was.
</p><p>"Quick!" cried this keeper. "The lion's cage door is not fastened. He is
trying to get out, but the elephant is holding him in. Quick! Fasten
shut the door!"
</p><p>Then the circus men, very quickly, made the door tightly shut, and that
was the end of Roarer's chances for getting out. Oh, but that lion was
angry!
</p><p>He sprang about the cage, roaring loudly, but he could not get out to go
and join Sharp Tooth, the tiger.
</p><p>"Some of you put some salve on the elephant's scratches," said the head
circus man, "while I look to see if any other animals have gotten
loose."
</p><p>Then he saw the open door of the tiger's cage, and he cried:
</p><p>"Sharp Tooth is loose! We must go and find that tiger!"
</p><p>Then some one else called:
</p><p>"And Tum Tum is gone also!"
</p><p>"What, Tum Tum gone!" cried the elephant trainer. "That's so," he said,
as he saw that the place where Tum Tum used to stand was empty.
</p><p>"I wonder where Tum Tum can be?" said the keeper. Maggo wished she
could tell how Tum Tum had tried to stop the tiger from running away,
but how the big elephant had not been in time. However, the head keeper
must have guessed it.
</p><p>"I don't believe Tum Tum ran away," he said. "He must have gone out
after the tiger. Come on, we must find them both."
</p><p>As it happened, the circus performance was over, so there were no boys
or girls, or men and women, to be frightened by hearing that the tiger
was loose. Sharp Tooth was so excited at getting out of the cage, that
she did not try to bite anybody. She slipped out of the tent, and ran
toward some woods near the circus lot.
</p><p>But Tum Tum was right after her. The tiger could go along very fast, but
the elephant could travel almost as quickly, and he kept right behind
the striped beast.
</p><p>"Ha! Go on back! Stop following me!" snarled Sharp Tooth.
</p><p>"No, I'll not," answered the brave elephant. "I want you to come back to
the circus."
</p><p>"I'll never come!" snapped the tiger.
</p><p>"Oh, yes, you will," the elephant said.
</p><p>The tiger kept on, and Tum Tum followed. Finally the tiger ran up a tree
and crouched out on a big limb.
</p><p>"Ha! Now you can't follow me!" she said to the elephant. "You can't
climb up this tree!"
</p><p>"No, but I can stay here until you come down," said Tum Tum, "and that's
what I'll do."
</p><p>"Bah!" snarled the tiger. "Go away and let me alone!"
</p><p>But Tum Tum would not. He stayed under the tree where the tiger was, for
he knew that soon the circus men would come to hunt for Sharp Tooth, to
put her back in her cage.
</p><p>And, surely enough, that is just what happened. The head keeper could
easily see which way the tiger and elephant had gone, for, though Sharp
Tooth did not make much of a track, Tum Tum did. An elephant cannot
crash and push his way through the bushes and trees without making a
broad path. And this path the circus men followed. Soon they came to the
tree in which Sharp Tooth was crouching.
</p><p>"Here she is!" cried one. "Bring up the cage!"
</p><p>The tiger's empty cage was wheeled under the tree, and the door was
open. Inside was put a nice piece of meat, such as the tiger loved, and
she was very hungry now.
</p><p>"You had better go down in your cage and behave yourself," said Tum Tum.
</p><p>"No, I will not!" snarled the tiger. But when the circus men snapped
their whips, and fired off guns, and brought blazing torches,
Sharp Tooth was afraid. Besides, she was very hungry, and as the lion
had not run away with her, she was afraid she could never get to the
jungle alone.
</p><p>[Illustration: He stayed under the tree where the tiger was, for he knew

</p><p>"I guess I had better go down in my cage," said the tiger. "But," she
added to Tum Tum, "if ever I get a chance to scratch you, I will."
</p><p>Into the cage she jumped, and the circus men slammed the door shut. The
tiger was caught again.
</p><p>"Good old boy, Tum Tum!" called the elephant's keeper to him, as they
were going back to the animal tent. "You saved the tiger from getting
away, and that was a good thing, for Sharp Tooth might have bitten
someone. You are a very good elephant!"
</p><p>This made Tum Tum feel quite happy, more happy even than did the nice
big lumps of sugar, and loaves of bread, he was given for his supper as
a reward.
</p><p>For you know animals like to be spoken kindly to, as well we do, boys
and girls. You just try it with your dog. Speak harshly to him, or scold
him, and see how he cringes down, and tucks his tail between his legs.
He knows when you are not kind to him.
</p><p>And then try speaking nicely. Tell him what a good dog he is, and how
much you like him, and see what a change there is.
</p><p>He will jump up, and wag his tail, and bark, he is so glad because you
are speaking kindly to him. And, if you let him, he will try to kiss you
with his red tongue. Oh, yes, indeed, animals know a great deal more
than most persons think they do.
</p><p>So that was how Sharp Tooth got out of her cage, and how Tum Tum helped
to catch her again. After that the animals' cages were never left open,
even for a second.
</p><p>"Did you get very scratched?" asked Tum Tum of Maggo, when everything
was once more quiet in the animal tent.
</p><p>"No, not much," answered the lady elephant.
</p><p>"I'm sorry I was not quick enough for the tiger," said Tum Tum. "Never
mind, it is all over now."
</p><p>Then the two elephant friends stood side by side in the tent and ate hay
and talked to each other in elephant language.
</p><p>And now my story of Tum Tum is drawing to a close. I shall tell you one
more thing that happened to him, and then I am finished.
</p><p>One day the circus was showing near a large city, and great crowds of
people came out to see it. There were boys and girls--more than Tum Tum
had ever seen before. The big tent was full.
</p><p>Tum Tum did all his tricks as best he could. He stood on his head, and
on his hind legs. He sat up at the table, and made believe eat a meal.
In this trick Mappo, the merry monkey, had a part, for he sat up with
Tum Tum, and they both ate.
</p><p>When the circus was almost over, and Tum Tum had played soldier, and
marched out of the ring carrying Mappo on his back, while Mappo waved a
flag, the little monkey, who could see out of the top of the tent said:
</p><p>"Tum Tum, we are going to have a big thunder shower. I can see the
lightning and the black clouds."
</p><p>"Well, it will not hurt us," said Tum Tum. "We often used to have
thunder storms in the jungle, and here we are under a tent."
</p><p>Then, suddenly the storm came. It grew very black, and the thunder and
lightning frightened the big crowds in the circus tent. It rained very
hard, too, so that some of the tent ropes were made loose and slipped.
</p><p>"Run out, quick!" suddenly called a man. "The tent is going to fall on
us! Run, everybody!"
</p><p>"No! Sit still! Keep your seats!" the circus men cried, but the crowd
was frightened and ran.
</p><p>Just then, one of the big poles of the tent began to fall.
</p><p>"That pole must not fall!" cried Tum Tum's keeper. "But how can I hold
it up? I am not strong enough."
</p><p>Then he looked at Tum Tum, the big elephant.
</p><p>"Ha! Tum Tum will hold up the pole, until all the people get out of the
tent!" cried the circus man. "Here, Tum Tum," he called. "Hold up this
pole."
</p><p>Tum Tum knew what was wanted of him. He pushed his strong head against
the pole, and it did not fall over. Tum Tum held it up, and the tent did
not come down.
</p><p>"Tum Tum, you are a fine elephant!" cried his master. "I love you!"
</p><p>The rain was soon over, and that night, after the evening performance,
the circus went on to another town.
</p><p>That brings me to the end of Tum Tum's adventures. But I have some
stories about other animals, and in the next book I'll tell you about
"Don, a Runaway Dog; His Many Adventures."
</p><p>As for Tum Tum, he lived in the circus for many, many years, growing
older and stronger and wiser every day, and everybody thought he was the
jolliest elephant in all the world.
