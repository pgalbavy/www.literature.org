<p>"Penrod," said his mother, "what did you do with that loaf of
bread Della says you took from the table?"</p>

<p>"Ma'am? <em>WHAT </em>loaf o' bread?"</p>

<p>"I believe I can't let you go outdoors this afternoon," Mrs.
Schofield said severely. "If you were hungry, you know perfectly
well all you had to do was to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I wasn't hungry; I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can explain later," Mrs. Schofield said. "You'll have all
afternoon."</p>

<p>Penrod's heart grew cold.</p>

<p>"I <em>CAN'T </em>stay in," he protested. "I've asked Sam Williams
to come over."</p>

<p>"I'll telephone Mrs. Williams."</p>

<p>"Mamma!" Penrod's voice became agonized. "I <em>HAD </em>to give
that bread to a&mdash;to a poor ole man. He was starving and so were
his children and his wife. They were all just <em>STARVING&mdash;</em>and
they couldn't wait while I took time to come and ask you, Mamma.
I got to GO outdoors this afternoon. I <em>GOT </em>to! Sam's&mdash;"</p>

<p>She relented.</p>

<p>In the carriage-house, half an hour later, Penrod gave an account
of the episode.</p>

<p>"Where'd we been, I'd just like to know," he concluded, "if I
hadn't got out here this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I could managed him all right," Sam said. "I was
in the passageway, a minute ago, takin' a look at him. He's standin'
up again. I expect he wants more to eat."</p>

<p>"Well, we got to fix about that," said Penrod. "But what I mean&mdash;if
I'd had to stay in the house, where would we been about the most
important thing in the whole biz'nuss?"</p>

<p>"What you talkin' about?"</p>

<p>"Well, why can't you wait till I tell you?" Penrod's tone had
become peevish. For that matter, so had Sam's; they were developing
one of the little differences, or quarrels, that composed the
very texture of their friendship.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you tell me, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, how can I?" Penrod demanded. "You keep talkin' every minute."</p>

<p>"I'm not talkin' <em>NOW, </em>am I?" Sam protested. "You can
tell me <em>NOW, </em>can't you? I'm not talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are, too!" Penrod shouted. "You talk all the time! You&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by Whitey's peculiar cough. Both boys jumped
and forgot their argument.</p>

<p>"He means he wants some more to eat, I bet," said Sam.</p>

<p>"Well, if he does, he's got to wait," Penrod declared. "We got
to get the most important thing of all fixed up first."</p>

<p>"What's that, Penrod?"</p>

<p>"The reward," said Penrod mildly. "That's what I was tryin' to
tell you about, Sam, if you'd ever give me half a chance."</p>

<p>"Well, I <em>DID </em>give you a chance. I kept <em>TELLIN' </em>you
to tell me, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You never! You kept sayin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>They renewed this discussion, protracting it indefinitely; but
as each persisted in clinging to his own interpretation of the
facts, the question still remains unsettled. It was abandoned,
or rather, it merged into another during the later stages of the
debate, this other being concerned with which of the debaters
had the least "sense." Each made the plain statement that if he
were more deficient than his opponent in that regard, self-destruction
would be his only refuge. Each declared that he would "rather
die than be talked to death"; and then, as the two approached
a point bluntly recriminative, Whitey coughed again, whereupon
they were miraculously silent, and went into the passageway in
a perfectly amiable manner.</p>

<p>"I got to have a good look at him, for once," Penrod said, as
he stared frowningly at Whitey. "We got to fix up about that reward."</p>

<p>"I want to take a good ole look at him myself," Sam said.</p>

<p>After supplying Whitey with another bucket of water, they returned
to the carriage-house and seated themselves thoughtfully. In truth,
they were something a shade more than thoughtful; the adventure
to which they had committed themselves was beginning to be a little
overpowering. If Whitey had been a dog, a goat, a fowl, or even
a stray calf, they would have felt equal to him; but now that
the earlier glow of their wild daring had disappeared, vague apprehensions
stirred. Their "good look"  at Whitey had not reassured them&mdash;he
seemed large, Gothic and unusual.</p>

<p>Whisperings within them began to urge that for boys to undertake
an enterprise connected with so huge an animal as an actual horse
was perilous. Beneath the surface of their musings, dim but ominous
prophecies moved; both boys began to have the feeling that, somehow,
this affair was going to get beyond them and that they would be
in heavy trouble before it was over&mdash;they knew not why. They knew
why no more than they knew why they felt it imperative to keep
the fact of Whitey's presence in the stable a secret from their
respective families; but they did begin to realize that keeping
a secret of that size was going to be attended with some difficulty.
In brief, their sensations were becoming comparable to those of
the man who stole a house.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, after a short period given to unspoken misgivings,
they returned to the subject of the reward. The money-value of
bay horses, as compared to white, was again discussed, and each
announced his certainty that nothing less than "a good ole hunderd
dollars" would be offered for the return of Whitey.</p>

<p>But immediately after so speaking they fell into another silence,
due to sinking feelings. They had spoken loudly and confidently,
and yet they knew, somehow, that such things were not to be. According
to their knowledge, it was perfectly reasonable to suppose that
they would receive this fortune; but they frightened themselves
in speaking of it. They knew that they <em>COULD </em>not have
a hundred dollars for their own. An oppression, as from something
awful and criminal, descended upon them at intervals.</p>

<p>Presently, however, they were warmed to a little cheerfulness
again by Penrod's suggestion that they should put a notice in
the paper. Neither of them had the slightest idea how to get it
there; but such details as that were beyond the horizon; they
occupied themselves with the question of what their advertisement
ought to "say". Finding that they differed irreconcilably, Penrod
went to his cache in the sawdust-box and brought two pencils and
a supply of paper. He gave one of the pencils and several sheets
to Sam; then both boys bent themselves in silence to the labour
of practical composition. Penrod produced the briefer paragraph.
(See Fig. I.) Sam's was more ample. (See Fig. <em>II.) &#11834;[</em>Transcribed

<p>Neither Sam nor Penrod showed any interest in what the other
had written; but both felt that something praiseworthy had been
accomplished. Penrod exhaled a sigh, as of relief, and, in a manner
he had observed his father use sometimes, he said:</p>

<p>"Thank goodness, <em>THAT'S </em>off my mind, anyway!"</p>

<p>"What we goin' do next, Penrod?" Sam asked deferentially, the
borrowed manner having some effect upon him.</p>

<p>"I don't know what <em>YOU'RE </em>goin' to do," Penrod returned,
picking up the old cigarbox that had contained the paper and pencils.
"I'M goin' to put mine in here, so's it'll come in handy when
I haf to get at it."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I'll keep mine there, too," Sam said. Thereupon
he deposited his scribbled slip beside Penrod's in the cigarbox,
and the box was solemnly returned to the secret place whence it
had been taken.</p>

<p>"There, <em>THAT'S '</em>tended to!" Sam said, and, unconsciously
imitating his friend's imitation, he gave forth audibly a breath
of satisfaction and relief.</p>

<p>Both boys felt that the financial side of their great affair
had been conscientiously looked to, that the question of the reward
was settled, and that everything was proceeding in a businesslike
manner. Therefore, they were able to turn their attention to another
matter.</p>

<p>This was the question of Whitey's next meal. After their exploits
of the morning, and the consequent imperilment of Penrod, they
decided that nothing more was to be done in apples, vegetables
or bread; it was evident that Whitey must be fed from the bosom
of nature.</p>

<p>"We couldn't pull enough o' that frostbit ole grass in the yard
to feed him," Penrod said gloomily. "We could work a week and
not get enough to make him swaller more'n about twice. All we
got this morning, he blew most of it away. He'd try to scoop it
in toward his teeth with his lip, and then he'd haf to kind of
blow out his breath, and after that all the grass that'd be left
was just some wet pieces stickin' to the outsides of his face.
Well, and you know how he acted about that maple branch. We can't
trust him with branches."</p>

<p>Sam jumped up.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> know!" he cried. "There's lots of leaves left on
the branches. We can give them to him."</p>

<p>"I just said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't mean the branches," Sam explained. "We'll leave the
branches on the trees, but just pull the leaves off the branches
and put 'em in the bucket and feed 'em to him out of the bucket."</p>

<p>Penrod thought this plan worth trying, and for three-quarters
of an hour the two boys were busy with the lower branches of various
trees in the yard. Thus they managed to supply Whitey with a fair
quantity of wet leaves, which he ate in a perfunctory way, displaying
little of his earlier enthusiasm. And the work of his purveyors
might have been more tedious if it had been less damp, for a boy
is seldom bored by anything that involves his staying-out in the
rain without protection. The drizzle had thickened; the leaves
were heavy with water, and at every jerk the branches sent fat
drops over the two collectors. They attained a noteworthy state
of sogginess.</p>

<p>Finally, they were brought to the attention of the authorities
indoors, and Della appeared upon the back porch.</p>

<p>"Musther Penrod," she called, "y'r mamma says ye'll c'm in the
house this minute an' change y'r shoes an' stockin's an' everythun'
else ye got on! D'ye hear me?"</p>

<p>Penrod, taken by surprise and unpleasantly alarmed, darted away
from the tree he was depleting and ran for the stable.</p>

<p>"You tell her I'm dry as toast!" he shouted over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Della withdrew, wearing the air of a person gratuitously insulted;
and a moment later she issued from the kitchen, carrying an umbrella.
She opened it and walked resolutely to the stable.</p>

<p>"She says I'm to bring ye in the house," said Della, "an' I'm
goin' to bring ye!"</p>

<p>Sam had joined Penrod in the carriage-house, and, with the beginnings
of an unnamed terror, the two beheld this grim advance. But they
did not stay for its culmination. Without a word to each other
they hurriedly tiptoed up the stairs to the gloomy loft, and there
they paused, listening.</p>

<p>They heard Della's steps upon the carriage-house floor.</p>

<p>"Ah, there's plenty places t'hide in," they heard her say; "but
I'll show ye! She tole me to bring ye, and I'm&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was interrupted by a peculiar sound&mdash;loud, chilling, dismal,
and unmistakably not of human origin. The boys knew it for Whitey's
cough; but Della had not their experience. A smothered shriek
reached their ears; there was a scurrying noise, and then, with
horror, they heard Della's footsteps in the passageway that ran
by Whitey's manger. Immediately there came a louder shriek, and
even in the anguish of knowing their secret discovered, they were
shocked to hear distinctly the words, "O Lard in hivvin!" in the
well-known voice of Della. She shrieked again, and they heard
the rush of her footfalls across the carriage-house floor. Wild
words came from the outer air, and the kitchen door slammed violently.
It was all over. She had gone to "tell".</p>

<p>Penrod and Sam plunged down the stairs and out of the stable.
They climbed the back fence and fled up the alley. They turned
into Sam's yard, and, without consultation, headed for the cellar
doors, nor paused till they found themselves in the farthest,
darkest and gloomiest recess of the cellar. There, perspiring,
stricken with fear, they sank down upon the earthen floor, with
their moist backs against the stone wall.</p>

<p>Thus with boys. The vague apprehensions that had been creeping
upon Penrod and Sam all afternoon had become monstrous; the unknown
was before them. How great their crime would turn out to be (now
that it was in the hands of grown people) they did not know; but,
since it concerned a horse, it would undoubtedly be considered
of terrible dimensions.</p>

<p>Their plans for a reward, and all the things that had seemed
both innocent and practical in the morning, now staggered their
minds as manifestations of criminal folly. A new and terrible
light seemed to play upon the day's exploits; they had chased
a horse belonging to strangers, and it would be said that they
deliberately drove him into the stable and there concealed him.
They had, in truth, virtually stolen him, and they had stolen
food for him. The waning light through the small window above
them warned Penrod that his inroads upon the vegetables in his
own cellar must soon be discovered. Della, that Nemesis, would
seek them in order to prepare them for dinner, and she would find
them not. But she would recall his excursion to the cellar, for
she had seen him when he came up; and also the truth would be
known concerning the loaf of bread. Altogether, Penrod felt that
his case was worse than Sam's&mdash;until Sam offered a suggestion
that roused such horrible possibilities concerning the principal
item of their offense that all thought of the smaller indictments
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Listen, Penrod," Sam quavered: "What&mdash;what if that&mdash;what if
that ole horse maybe b'longed to a&mdash;policeman!" Sam's imagination
was not of the comforting kind. "What'd they&mdash;do to us, Penrod,
if it turned out he was some policeman's horse?"</p>

<p>Penrod was able only to shake his head. He did not reply in words;
but both boys thenceforth considered it almost inevitable that
Whitey had belonged to a policeman, and, in their sense of so
ultimate a disaster, they ceased for a time to brood upon what
their parents would probably do to them. The penalty for stealing
a policeman's horse would be only a step short of capital, they
were sure. They would not be hanged; but vague, looming sketches
of something called the penitentiary began to flicker before them.</p>

<p>It grew darker in the cellar, so that finally they could not
see each other.</p>

<p>"I guess they're huntin' for us by now," Sam said huskily. "I
don't &mdash;I don't like it much down here, Penrod."</p>

<p>Penrod's hoarse whisper came from the profound gloom: "Well,
who ever said you did?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" Sam paused; then he said plaintively, "I wish we'd never
<em>SEEN </em>that dern ole horse."</p>

<p>"It was every bit his fault," said Penrod. "We didn't do anything.
If he hadn't come stickin' his ole head in our stable, it'd never
happened at all. Ole fool!" He rose. "I'm goin' to get out of
here; I guess I've stood about enough for one day."</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;where you goin', Penrod? You aren't goin' <em>HOME, </em>are
you?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm not! What you take me for? You think I'm crazy?"</p>

<p>"Well, where <em>CAN </em>we go?"</p>

<p>How far Penrod's desperation actually would have led him is doubtful;
but he made this statement: "I don't know where <em>YOU'RE </em>goin',
but I'M goin' to walk straight out in the country till I come
to a farmhouse and say my name's George and live there!"</p>

<p>"I'll do it, too," Sam whispered eagerly. "I'll say my name's
Henry."</p>

<p>"Well, we better get started," said the executive Penrod. "We
got to get away from here, anyway."</p>

<p>But when they came to ascend the steps leading to the "outside
doors", they found that those doors had been closed and locked
for the night.</p>

<p>"It's no use," Sam lamented, "and we can't bust 'em, cause I
tried to, once before. Fanny always locks 'em about five o'clock
&mdash;I forgot. We got to go up the stairway and try to sneak
out through the house."</p>

<p>They tiptoed back, and up the inner stairs. They paused at the
top, then breathlessly stepped out into a hall that was entirely
dark. Sam touched Penrod's sleeve in warning and bent to listen
at a door.</p>

<p>Immediately that door opened, revealing the bright library, where
sat Penrod's mother and Sam's father.</p>

<p>It was Sam's mother who had opened the door. "Come into the library,
boys," she said. "Mrs. Schofield is just telling us about it."</p>

<p>And as the two comrades moved dumbly into the lighted room, Penrod's
mother rose, and, taking him by the shoulder, urged him close
to the fire.</p>

<p>"You stand there and try to dry off a little, while I finish
telling Mr. and Mrs. Williams about you and Sam," she said. "You'd
better make Sam keep near the fire, too, Mrs. Williams, because
they both got wringing wet. Think of their running off just when
most people would have wanted to stay! Well, I'll go on with the
story, then. Della told me all about it, and what the cook next
door said <em>SHE'D </em>seen, how they'd been trying to pull
grass and leaves for the poor old thing all day&mdash;and all about
the apples they carried from <em>YOUR </em>cellar, and getting
wet and working in the rain as hard as they could&mdash;and they'd
given him a loaf of bread! Shame on you, Penrod!" She paused to
laugh; but there was a little moisture about her eyes, even before
she laughed. "And they'd fed him on potatoes and lettuce and cabbage
and turnips out of <em>OUR </em>cellar! And I wish you'd see the
sawdust bed they made for him! Well, when I'd telephoned, and
the Humane Society man got there, he said it was the most touching
thing he ever knew. It seems he <em>KNEW </em>this horse, and
had been looking for him. He said ninety-nine boys out of a hundred
would have chased the poor old thing away, and he was going to
see to it that this case didn't go unnoticed, because the local
branch of the society gives little silver medals for special acts
like this. And the last thing he said was that he was sure Penrod
and Sam each would be awarded one at the meeting of the society
next Thursday night."</p>

<p>... On the following Saturday a yodel sounded from the sunny
sidewalk in front of the Schofields' house, and Penrod, issuing
forth, beheld the familiar figure of Samuel Williams waiting.</p>

<p>Upon Sam's breast there glittered a round bit of silver suspended
by a white ribbon from a bar of the same metal. Upon the breast
of Penrod was a decoration precisely similar.</p>

<p>"'Lo, Penrod," said Sam. "What are you goin' to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'"</p>

<p>"I got mine on," said Sam.</p>

<p>"I have, too," said Penrod. "I wouldn't take a hunderd dollars
for mine."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't take two hunderd for mine," said Sam.</p>

<p>Each glanced pleasantly at the other's medal. They faced each
other without shame. Neither had the slightest sense of hypocrisy
in himself or in his comrade. On the contrary!</p>

<p>Penrod's eyes went from Sam's medal back to his own; thence they
wandered, with perhaps a little disappointment, to the lifeless
street and to the empty yards and spectatorless windows of the
neighbourhood. Then he looked southward toward the busy heart
of the town, where multitudes were.</p>

<p>"Let's go down and see what time it is by the court-house-clock,"
said Penrod.</p>
