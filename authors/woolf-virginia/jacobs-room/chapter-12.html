<p>The water fell off a ledge like lead&mdash;like a chain with thick
white links. The train ran out into a steep green meadow, and
Jacob saw striped tulips growing and heard a bird singing, in
Italy.</p>

<p>A motor car full of Italian officers ran along the flat road
and kept up with the train, raising dust behind it. There were
trees laced together with vines&mdash;as Virgil said. Here was a station;
and a tremendous leave-taking going on, with women in high yellow
boots and odd pale boys in ringed socks. Virgil's bees had gone
about the plains of Lombardy. It was the custom of the ancients
to train vines between elms. Then at Milan there were sharp-winged
hawks, of a bright brown, cutting figures over the roofs.</p>

<p>These Italian carriages get damnably hot with the afternoon sun
on them, and the chances are that before the engine has pulled
to the top of the gorge the clanking chain will have broken. Up,
up, up, it goes, like a train on a scenic railway. Every peak
is covered with sharp trees, and amazing white villages are crowded
on ledges. There is always a white tower on the very summit, flat
red-frilled roofs, and a sheer drop beneath. It is not a country
in which one walks after tea. For one thing there is no grass.
A whole hillside will be ruled with olive trees. Already in April
the earth is clotted into dry dust between them. And there are
neither stiles nor footpaths, nor lanes chequered with the shadows
of leaves nor eighteenth-century inns with bow-windows, where
one eats ham and eggs. Oh no, Italy is all fierceness, bareness,
exposure, and black priests shuffling along the roads. It is strange,
too, how you never get away from villas.</p>

<p>Still, to be travelling on one's own with a hundred pounds to
spend is a fine affair. And if his money gave out, as it probably
would, he would go on foot. He could live on bread and wine&mdash;the
wine in straw bottles&mdash;for after doing Greece he was going to
knock off Rome. The Roman civilization was a very inferior affair,
no doubt. But Bonamy talked a lot of rot, all the same. "You ought
to have been in Athens," he would say to Bonamy when he got back.
"Standing on the Parthenon," he would say, or "The ruins of the
Coliseum suggest some fairly sublime reflections," which he would
write out at length in letters. It might turn to an essay upon
civilization. A comparison between the ancients and moderns, with
some pretty sharp hits at Mr. Asquith&mdash;something in the style
of Gibbon.</p>

<p>A stout gentleman laboriously hauled himself in, dusty, baggy,
slung with gold chains, and Jacob, regretting that he did not
come of the Latin race, looked out of the window.</p>

<p>It is a strange reflection that by travelling two days and nights
you are in the heart of Italy. Accidental villas among olive trees
appear; and men-servants watering the cactuses. Black victorias
drive in between pompous pillars with plaster shields stuck to
them. It is at once momentary and astonishingly intimate&mdash;to be
displayed before the eyes of a foreigner. And there is a lonely
hill-top where no one ever comes, and yet it is seen by me who
was lately driving down Piccadilly on an omnibus. And what I should
like would be to get out among the fields, sit down and hear the
grasshoppers, and take up a handful of earth &mdash;Italian earth,
as this is Italian dust upon my shoes.</p>

<p>Jacob heard them crying strange names at railway stations through
the night. The train stopped and he heard frogs croaking close
by, and he wrinkled back the blind cautiously and saw a vast strange
marsh all white in the moonlight. The carriage was thick with
cigar smoke, which floated round the globe with the green shade
on it. The Italian gentleman lay snoring with his boots off and
his waistcoat unbuttoned.... And all this business of going to
Greece seemed to Jacob an intolerable weariness&mdash;sitting in hotels
by oneself and looking at monuments&mdash;he'd have done better to
go to Cornwall with Timmy Durrant.... "<em>O&mdash;</em>h," Jacob protested,
as the darkness began breaking in front of him and the light showed
through, but the man was reaching across him to get something&mdash;the
fat Italian man in his dicky, unshaven, crumpled, obese, was opening
the door and going off to have a wash.</p>

<p>So Jacob sat up, and saw a lean Italian sportsman with a gun
walking down the road in the early morning light, and the whole
idea of the Parthenon came upon him in a clap.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he thought, "we must be nearly there!" and he stuck
his head out of the window and got the air full in his face.</p>

<p>It is highly exasperating that twenty-five people of your acquaintance
should be able to say straight off something very much to the
point about being in Greece, while for yourself there is a stopper
upon all emotions whatsoever. For after washing at the hotel at
Patras, Jacob had followed the tram lines a mile or so out; and
followed them a mile or so back; he had met several droves of
turkeys; several strings of donkeys; had got lost in back streets;
had read advertisements of corsets and of Maggi's consomme; children
had trodden on his toes; the place smelt of bad cheese; and he
was glad to find himself suddenly come out opposite his hotel.
There was an old copy of the Daily Mail lying among coffee-cups;
which he read. But what could he do after dinner?</p>

<p>No doubt we should be, on the whole, much worse off than we are
without our astonishing gift for illusion. At the age of twelve
or so, having given up dolls and broken our steam engines, France,
but much more probably Italy, and India almost for a certainty,
draws the superfluous imagination. One's aunts have been to Rome;
and every one has an uncle who was last heard of&mdash;poor man&mdash;in
Rangoon. He will never come back any more. But it is the governesses
who start the Greek myth. Look at that for a head (they say)&mdash;nose,
you see, straight as a dart, curls, eyebrows&mdash;everything appropriate
to manly beauty; while his legs and arms have lines on them which
indicate a perfect degree of development&mdash;the Greeks caring for
the body as much as for the face. And the Greeks could paint fruit
so that birds pecked at it. First you read Xenophon; then Euripides.
One day&mdash;that was an occasion, by God&mdash;what people have said appears
to have sense in it; "the Greek spirit"; the Greek this, that,
and the other; though it is absurd, by the way, to say that any
Greek comes near Shakespeare. The point is, however, that we have
been brought up in an illusion.</p>

<p>Jacob, no doubt, thought something in this fashion, the Daily
Mail crumpled in his hand; his legs extended; the very picture
of boredom.</p>

<p>"But it's the way we're brought up," he went on.</p>

<p>And it all seemed to him very distasteful. Something ought to
be done about it. And from being moderately depressed he became
like a man about to be executed. Clara Durrant had left him at
a party to talk to an American called Pilchard. And he had come
all the way to Greece and left her. They wore evening-dresses,
and talked nonsense&mdash;what damned nonsense&mdash;and he put out his
hand for the Globe Trotter, an international magazine which is
supplied free of charge to the proprietors of hotels.</p>

<p>In spite of its ramshackle condition modern Greece is highly
advanced in the electric tramway system, so that while Jacob sat
in the hotel sitting-room the trams clanked, chimed, rang, rang,
rang imperiously to get the donkeys out of the way, and one old
woman who refused to budge, beneath the windows. The whole of
civilization was being condemned.</p>

<p>The waiter was quite indifferent to that too. Aristotle, a dirty
man, carnivorously interested in the body of the only guest now
occupying the only arm-chair, came into the room ostentatiously,
put something down, put something straight, and saw that Jacob
was still there.</p>

<p>"I shall want to be called early to-morrow," said Jacob, over
his shoulder. "I am going to Olympia."</p>

<p>This gloom, this surrender to the dark waters which lap us about,
is a modern invention. Perhaps, as Cruttendon said, we do not
believe enough. Our fathers at any rate had something to demolish.
So have we for the matter of that, thought Jacob, crumpling the
Daily Mail in his hand. He would go into Parliament and make fine
speeches&mdash;but what use are fine speeches and Parliament, once
you surrender an inch to the black waters? Indeed there has never
been any explanation of the ebb and flow in our veins&mdash;of happiness
and unhappiness. That respectability and evening parties where
one has to dress, and wretched slums at the back of Gray's Inn&mdash;something
solid, immovable, and grotesque&mdash;is at the back of it, Jacob thought
probable. But then there was the British Empire which was beginning
to puzzle him; nor was he altogether in favour of giving Home
Rule to Ireland. What did the Daily Mail say about that?</p>

<p>For he had grown to be a man, and was about to be immersed in
things&mdash;as indeed the chambermaid, emptying his basin upstairs,
fingering keys, studs, pencils, and bottles of tabloids strewn
on the dressing-table, was aware.</p>

<p>That he had grown to be a man was a fact that Florinda knew,
as she knew everything, by instinct.</p>

<p>And Betty Flanders even now suspected it, as she read his letter,
posted at Milan, "Telling me," she complained to Mrs. Jarvis,
"really nothing that I want to know"; but she brooded over it.</p>

<p>Fanny Elmer felt it to desperation. For he would take his stick
and his hat and would walk to the window, and look perfectly absent-minded
and very stern too, she thought.</p>

<p>"I am going," he would say, "to cadge a meal of Bonamy."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I can drown myself in the Thames," Fanny cried, as she
hurried past the Foundling Hospital.</p>

<p>"But the Daily Mail isn't to be trusted," Jacob said to himself,
looking about for something else to read. And he sighed again,
being indeed so profoundly gloomy that gloom must have been lodged
in him to cloud him at any moment, which was odd in a man who
enjoyed things so, was not much given to analysis, but was horribly
romantic, of course, Bonamy thought, in his rooms in Lincoln's
Inn.</p>

<p>"He will fall in love," thought Bonamy. "Some Greek woman with
a straight nose."</p>

<p>It was to Bonamy that Jacob wrote from Patras&mdash;to Bonamy who
couldn't love a woman and never read a foolish book.</p>

<p>There are very few good books after all, for we can't count profuse
histories, travels in mule carts to discover the sources of the
Nile, or the volubility of fiction.</p>

<p>I like books whose virtue is all drawn together in a page or
two. I like sentences that don't budge though armies cross them.
I like words to be hard&mdash;such were Bonamy's views, and they won
him the hostility of those whose taste is all for the fresh growths
of the morning, who throw up the window, and find the poppies
spread in the sun, and can't forbear a shout of jubilation at
the astonishing fertility of English literature. That was not
Bonamy's way at all. That his taste in literature affected his
friendships, and made him silent, secretive, fastidious, and only
quite at his ease with one or two young men of his own way of
thinking, was the charge against him.</p>

<p>But then Jacob Flanders was not at all of his own way of thinking&mdash;far
from it, Bonamy sighed, laying the thin sheets of notepaper on
the table and falling into thought about Jacob's character, not
for the first time.</p>

<p>The trouble was this romantic vein in him. "But mixed with the
stupidity which leads him into these absurd predicaments," thought
Bonamy, "there is something&mdash;something"&mdash;he sighed, for he was
fonder of Jacob than of any one in the world.</p>

<p>Jacob went to the window and stood with his hands in his pockets.
There he saw three Greeks in kilts; the masts of ships; idle or
busy people of the lower classes strolling or stepping out briskly,
or falling into groups and gesticulating with their hands. Their
lack of concern for him was not the cause of his gloom; but some
more profound conviction&mdash;it was not that he himself happened
to be lonely, but that all people are.</p>

<p>Yet next day, as the train slowly rounded a hill on the way to
Olympia, the Greek peasant women were out among the vines; the
old Greek men were sitting at the stations, sipping sweet wine.
And though Jacob remained gloomy he had never suspected how tremendously
pleasant it is to be alone; out of England; on one's own; cut
off from the whole thing. There are very sharp bare hills on the
way to Olympia; and between them blue sea in triangular spaces.
A little like the Cornish coast. Well now, to go walking by oneself
all day&mdash;to get on to that track and follow it up between the
bushes&mdash;or are they small trees?&mdash;to the top of that mountain
from which one can see half the nations of antiquity&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jacob, for his carriage was empty, "let's look at
the map." Blame it or praise it, there is no denying the wild
horse in us. To gallop intemperately; fall on the sand tired out;
to feel the earth spin; to have&mdash;positively&mdash;a rush of friendship
for stones and grasses, as if humanity were over, and as for men
and women, let them go hang&mdash;there is no getting over the fact
that this desire seizes us pretty often.</p>

<p>The evening air slightly moved the dirty curtains in the hotel
window at Olympia.</p>

<p>"I am full of love for every one," thought Mrs. Wentworth Williams,
"&mdash;for the poor most of all&mdash;for the peasants coming back in the
evening with their burdens. And everything is soft and vague and
very sad. It is sad, it is sad. But everything has meaning," thought
Sandra Wentworth Williams, raising her head a little and looking
very beautiful, tragic, and exalted. "One must love everything."</p>

<p>She held in her hand a little book convenient for travelling&mdash;stories
by Tchekov&mdash;as she stood, veiled, in white, in the window of the
hotel at Olympia. How beautiful the evening was! and her beauty
was its beauty. The tragedy of Greece was the tragedy of all high
souls. The inevitable compromise. She seemed to have grasped something.
She would write it down. And moving to the table where her husband
sat reading she leant her chin in her hands and thought of the
peasants, of suffering, of her own beauty, of the inevitable compromise,
and of how she would write it down. Nor did Evan Williams say
anything brutal, banal, or foolish when he shut his book and put
it away to make room for the plates of soup which were now being
placed before them. Only his drooping bloodhound eyes and his
heavy sallow cheeks expressed his melancholy tolerance, his conviction
that though forced to live with circumspection and deliberation
he could never possibly achieve any of those objects which, as
he knew, are the only ones worth pursuing. His consideration was
flawless; his silence unbroken.</p>

<p>"Everything seems to mean so much," said Sandra. But with the
sound of her own voice the spell was broken. She forgot the peasants.
Only there remained with her a sense of her own beauty, and in
front, luckily, there was a looking-glass.</p>

<p>"I am very beautiful," she thought.</p>

<p>She shifted her hat slightly. Her husband saw her looking in
the glass; and agreed that beauty is important; it is an inheritance;
one cannot ignore it. But it is a barrier; it is in fact rather
a bore. So he drank his soup; and kept his eyes fixed upon the
window.</p>

<p>"Quails," said Mrs. Wentworth Williams languidly. "And then goat,
I suppose; and then..."</p>

<p>"Caramel custard presumably," said her husband in the same cadence,
with his toothpick out already.</p>

<p>She laid her spoon upon her plate, and her soup was taken away
half finished. Never did she do anything without dignity; for
hers was the English type which is so Greek, save that villagers
have touched their hats to it, the vicarage reveres it; and upper-gardeners
and under-gardeners respectfully straighten their backs as she
comes down the broad terrace on Sunday morning, dallying at the
stone urns with the Prime Minister to pick a rose&mdash;which, perhaps,
she was trying to forget, as her eye wandered round the dining-room
of the inn at Olympia, seeking the window where her book lay,
where a few minutes ago she had discovered something&mdash;something
very profound it had been, about love and sadness and the peasants.</p>

<p>But it was Evan who sighed; not in despair nor indeed in rebellion.
But, being the most ambitious of men and temperamentally the most
sluggish, he had accomplished nothing; had the political history
of England at his finger-ends, and living much in company with
Chatham, Pitt, Burke, and Charles James Fox could not help contrasting
himself and his age with them and theirs. "Yet there never was
a time when great men are more needed," he was in the habit of
saying to himself, with a sigh. Here he was picking his teeth
in an inn at Olympia. He had done. But Sandra's eyes wandered.</p>

<p>"Those pink melons are sure to be dangerous," he said gloomily.
And as he spoke the door opened and in came a young man in a grey
check suit.</p>

<p>"Beautiful but dangerous," said Sandra, immediately talking to
her husband in the presence of a third person. ("Ah, an English
boy on tour," she thought to herself.)</p>

<p>And Evan knew all that too.</p>

<p>Yes, he knew all that; and he admired her. Very pleasant, he
thought, to have affairs. But for himself, what with his height
(Napoleon was five feet four, he remembered), his bulk, his inability
to impose his own personality (and yet great men are needed more
than ever now, he sighed), it was useless. He threw away his cigar,
went up to Jacob and asked him, with a simple sort of sincerity
which Jacob liked, whether he had come straight out from England.</p>

<p>"How very English!" Sandra laughed when the waiter told them
next morning that the young gentleman had left at five to climb
the mountain. "I am sure he asked you for a bath?" at which the
waiter shook his head, and said that he would ask the manager.</p>

<p>"You do not understand," laughed Sandra. "Never mind."</p>

<p>Stretched on the top of the mountain, quite alone, Jacob enjoyed
himself immensely. Probably he had never been so happy in the
whole of his life.</p>

<p>But at dinner that night Mr. Williams asked him whether he would
like to see the paper; then Mrs. Williams asked him (as they strolled
on the terrace smoking&mdash;and how could he refuse that man's cigar?)
whether he'd seen the theatre by moonlight; whether he knew Everard
Sherborn; whether he read Greek and whether (Evan rose silently
and went in) if he had to sacrifice one it would be the French
literature or the Russian?</p>

<p>"And now," wrote Jacob in his letter to Bonamy, "I shall have
to read her cursed book"&mdash;her Tchekov, he meant, for she had lent
it him.</p>

<p>Though the opinion is unpopular it seems likely enough that bare
places, fields too thick with stones to be ploughed, tossing sea-meadows
half-way between England and America, suit us better than cities.</p>

<p>There is something absolute in us which despises qualification.
It is this which is teased and twisted in society. People come
together in a room. "So delighted," says somebody, "to meet you,"
and that is a lie. And then: "I enjoy the spring more than the
autumn now. One does, I think, as one gets older." For women are
always, always, always talking about what one feels, and if they
say "as one gets older," they mean you to reply with something
quite off the point.</p>

<p>Jacob sat himself down in the quarry where the Greeks had cut
marble for the theatre. It is hot work walking up Greek hills
at midday. The wild red cyclamen was out; he had seen the little
tortoises hobbling from clump to clump; the air smelt strong and
suddenly sweet, and the sun, striking on jagged splinters of marble,
was very dazzling to the eyes. Composed, commanding, contemptuous,
a little melancholy, and bored with an august kind of boredom,
there he sat smoking his pipe.</p>

<p>Bonamy would have said that this was the sort of thing that made
him uneasy&mdash;when Jacob got into the doldrums, looked like a Margate
fisherman out of a job, or a British Admiral. You couldn't make
him understand a thing when he was in a mood like that. One had
better leave him alone. He was dull. He was apt to be grumpy.</p>

<p>He was up very early, looking at the statues with his Baedeker.</p>

<p>Sandra Wentworth Williams, ranging the world before breakfast
in quest of adventure or a point of view, all in white, not so
very tall perhaps, but uncommonly upright &mdash;Sandra Williams
got Jacob's head exactly on a level with the head of the Hermes
of Praxiteles. The comparison was all in his favour. But before
she could say a single word he had gone out of the Museum and
left her.</p>

<p>Still, a lady of fashion travels with more than one dress, and
if white suits the morning hour, perhaps sandy yellow with purple
spots on it, a black hat, and a volume of Balzac, suit the evening.
Thus she was arranged on the terrace when Jacob came in. Very
beautiful she looked. With her hands folded she mused, seemed
to listen to her husband, seemed to watch the peasants coming
down with brushwood on their backs, seemed to notice how the hill
changed from blue to black, seemed to discriminate between truth
and falsehood, Jacob thought, and crossed his legs suddenly, observing
the extreme shabbiness of his trousers.</p>

<p>"But he is very distinguished looking," Sandra decided.</p>

<p>And Evan Williams, lying back in his chair with the paper on
his knees, envied them. The best thing he could do would be to
publish, with Macmillans, his monograph upon the foreign policy
of Chatham. But confound this tumid, queasy feeling&mdash;this restlessness,
swelling, and heat&mdash;it was jealousy! jealousy! jealousy! which
he had sworn never to feel again.</p>

<p>"Come with us to Corinth, Flanders," he said with more than his
usual energy, stopping by Jacob's chair. He was relieved by Jacob's
reply, or rather by the solid, direct, if shy manner in which
he said that he would like very much to come with them to Corinth.</p>

<p>"Here is a fellow," thought Evan Williams, "who might do very
well in politics."</p>

<p>"I intend to come to Greece every year so long as I live," Jacob
wrote to Bonamy. "It is the only chance I can see of protecting
oneself from civilization."</p>

<p>"Goodness knows what he means by that," Bonamy sighed. For as
he never said a clumsy thing himself, these dark sayings of Jacob's
made him feel apprehensive, yet somehow impressed, his own turn
being all for the definite, the concrete, and the rational.</p>

<p>Nothing could be much simpler than what Sandra said as she descended
the Acro-Corinth, keeping to the little path, while Jacob strode
over rougher ground by her side. She had been left motherless
at the age of four; and the Park was vast.</p>

<p>"One never seemed able to get out of it," she laughed. Of course
there was the library, and dear Mr. Jones, and notions about things.
"I used to stray into the kitchen and sit upon the butler's knees,"
she laughed, sadly though.</p>

<p>Jacob thought that if he had been there he would have saved her;
for she had been exposed to great dangers, he felt, and, he thought
to himself, "People wouldn't understand a woman talking as she
talks."</p>

<p>She made little of the roughness of the hill; and wore breeches,
he saw, under her short skirts.</p>

<p>"Women like Fanny Elmer don't," he thought. "What's-her-name
Carslake didn't; yet they pretend..."</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams said things straight out. He was surprised by his
own knowledge of the rules of behaviour; how much more can be
said than one thought; how open one can be with a woman; and how
little he had known himself before.</p>

<p>Evan joined them on the road; and as they drove along up hill
and down hill (for Greece is in a state of effervescence, yet
astonishingly clean-cut, a treeless land, where you see the ground
between the blades, each hill cut and shaped and outlined as often
as not against sparkling deep blue waters, islands white as sand
floating on the horizon, occasional groves of palm trees standing
in the valleys, which are scattered with black goats, spotted
with little olive trees and sometimes have white hollows, rayed
and criss-crossed, in their flanks), as they drove up hill and
down he scowled in the corner of the carriage, with his paw so
tightly closed that the skin was stretched between the knuckles
and the little hairs stood upright. Sandra rode opposite, dominant,
like a Victory prepared to fling into the air.</p>

<p>"Heartless!" thought Evan (which was untrue).</p>

<p>"Brainless!" he suspected (and that was not true either). "Still...!"
He envied her.</p>

<p>When bedtime came the difficulty was to write to Bonamy, Jacob
found. Yet he had seen Salamis, and Marathon in the distance.
Poor old Bonamy! No; there was something queer about it. He could
not write to Bonamy.</p>

<p>"I shall go to Athens all the same," he resolved, looking very
set, with this hook dragging in his side.</p>

<p>The Williamses had already been to Athens.</p>

<p>Athens is still quite capable of striking a young man as the
oddest combination, the most incongruous assortment. Now it is
suburban; now immortal. Now cheap continental jewellery is laid
upon plush trays. Now the stately woman stands naked, save for
a wave of drapery above the knee. No form can he set on his sensations
as he strolls, one blazing afternoon, along the Parisian boulevard
and skips out of the way of the royal landau which, looking indescribably
ramshackle, rattles along the pitted roadway, saluted by citizens
of both sexes cheaply dressed in bowler hats and continental costumes;
though a shepherd in kilt, cap, and gaiters very nearly drives
his herd of goats between the royal wheels; and all the time the
Acropolis surges into the air, raises itself above the town, like
a large immobile wave with the yellow columns of the Parthenon
firmly planted upon it.</p>

<p>The yellow columns of the Parthenon are to be seen at all hours
of the day firmly planted upon the Acropolis; though at sunset,
when the ships in the Piraeus fire their guns, a bell rings, a
man in uniform (the waistcoat unbuttoned) appears; and the women
roll up the black stockings which they are knitting in the shadow
of the columns, call to the children, and troop off down the hill
back to their houses.</p>

<p>There they are again, the pillars, the pediment, the Temple of
Victory and the Erechtheum, set on a tawny rock cleft with shadows,
directly you unlatch your shutters in the morning and, leaning
out, hear the clatter, the clamour, the whip cracking in the street
below. There they are.</p>

<p>The extreme definiteness with which they stand, now a brilliant
white, again yellow, and in some lights red, imposes ideas of
durability, of the emergence through the earth of some spiritual
energy elsewhere dissipated in elegant trifles. But this durability
exists quite independently of our admiration. Although the beauty
is sufficiently humane to weaken us, to stir the deep deposit
of mud&mdash;memories, abandonments, regrets, sentimental devotions&mdash;the
Parthenon is separate from all that; and if you consider how it
has stood out all night, for centuries, you begin to connect the
blaze (at midday the glare is dazzling and the frieze almost invisible)
with the idea that perhaps it is beauty alone that is immortal.</p>

<p>Added to this, compared with the blistered stucco, the new love
songs rasped out to the strum of guitar and gramophone, and the
mobile yet insignificant faces of the street, the Parthenon is
really astonishing in its silent composure; which is so vigorous
that, far from being decayed, the Parthenon appears, on the contrary,
likely to outlast the entire world.</p>

<p>"And the Greeks, like sensible men, never bothered to finish
the backs of their statues," said Jacob, shading his eyes and
observing that the side of the figure which is turned away from
view is left in the rough.</p>

<p>He noted the slight irregularity in the line of the steps which
"the artistic sense of the Greeks preferred to mathematical accuracy,"
he read in his guide-book.</p>

<p>He stood on the exact spot where the great statue of Athena used
to stand, and identified the more famous landmarks of the scene
beneath.</p>

<p>In short he was accurate and diligent; but profoundly morose.
Moreover he was pestered by guides. This was on Monday.</p>

<p>But on Wednesday he wrote a telegram to Bonamy, telling him to
come at once. And then he crumpled it in his hand and threw it
in the gutter.</p>

<p>"For one thing he wouldn't come," he thought. "And then I daresay
this sort of thing wears off." "This sort of thing" being that
uneasy, painful feeling, something like selfishness&mdash;one wishes
almost that the thing would stop&mdash;it is getting more and more
beyond what is possible&mdash;"If it goes on much longer I shan't be
able to cope with it&mdash;but if some one else were seeing it at the
same time &mdash;Bonamy is stuffed in his room in Lincoln's Inn&mdash;oh,
I say, damn it all, I say,"&mdash;the sight of Hymettus, Pentelicus,
Lycabettus on one side, and the sea on the other, as one stands
in the Parthenon at sunset, the sky pink feathered, the plain
all colours, the marble tawny in one's eyes, is thus oppressive.
Luckily Jacob had little sense of personal association; he seldom
thought of Plato or Socrates in the flesh; on the other hand his
feeling for architecture was very strong; he preferred statues
to pictures; and he was beginning to think a great deal about
the problems of civilization, which were solved, of course, so
very remarkably by the ancient Greeks, though their solution is
no help to us. Then the hook gave a great tug in his side as he
lay in bed on Wednesday night; and he turned over with a desperate
sort of tumble, remembering Sandra Wentworth Williams with whom
he was in love.</p>

<p>Next day he climbed Pentelicus.</p>

<p>The day after he went up to the Acropolis. The hour was early;
the place almost deserted; and possibly there was thunder in the
air. But the sun struck full upon the Acropolis.</p>

<p>Jacob's intention was to sit down and read, and, finding a drum
of marble conveniently placed, from which Marathon could be seen,
and yet it was in the shade, while the Erechtheum blazed white
in front of him, there he sat. And after reading a page he put
his thumb in his book. Why not rule countries in the way they
should be ruled? And he read again.</p>

<p>No doubt his position there overlooking Marathon somehow raised
his spirits. Or it may have been that a slow capacious brain has
these moments of flowering. Or he had, insensibly, while he was
abroad, got into the way of thinking about politics.</p>

<p>And then looking up and seeing the sharp outline, his meditations
were given an extraordinary edge; Greece was over; the Parthenon
in ruins; yet there he was.</p>

<p>(Ladies with green and white umbrellas passed through the courtyard
&mdash;French ladies on their way to join their husbands in Constantinople.)</p>

<p>Jacob read on again. And laying the book on the ground he began,
as if inspired by what he had read, to write a note upon the importance
of history&mdash;upon democracy&mdash;one of those scribbles upon which
the work of a lifetime may be based; or again, it falls out of
a book twenty years later, and one can't remember a word of it.
It is a little painful. It had better be burnt.</p>

<p>Jacob wrote; began to draw a straight nose; when all the French
ladies opening and shutting their umbrellas just beneath him exclaimed,
looking at the sky, that one did not know what to expect&mdash;rain
or fine weather?</p>

<p>Jacob got up and strolled across to the Erechtheum. There are
still several women standing there holding the roof on their heads.
Jacob straightened himself slightly; for stability and balance
affect the body first. These statues annulled things so! He stared
at them, then turned, and there was Madame Lucien Grave perched
on a block of marble with her kodak pointed at his head. Of course
she jumped down, in spite of her age, her figure, and her tight
boots&mdash;having, now that her daughter was married, lapsed with
a luxurious abandonment, grand enough in its way, into the fleshy
grotesque; she jumped down, but not before Jacob had seen her.</p>

<p>"Damn these women&mdash;damn these women!" he thought. And he went
to fetch his book which he had left lying on the ground in the
Parthenon.</p>

<p>"How they spoil things," he murmured, leaning against one of
the pillars, pressing his book tight between his arm and his side.
(As for the weather, no doubt the storm would break soon; Athens
was under cloud.)</p>

<p>"It is those damned women," said Jacob, without any trace of
bitterness, but rather with sadness and disappointment that what
might have been should never be.</p>

<p>(This violent disillusionment is generally to be expected in
young men in the prime of life, sound of wind and limb, who will
soon become fathers of families and directors of banks.)</p>

<p>Then, making sure that the Frenchwomen had gone, and looking
cautiously round him, Jacob strolled over to the Erechtheum and
looked rather furtively at the goddess on the left-hand side holding
the roof on her head. She reminded him of Sandra Wentworth Williams.
He looked at her, then looked away. He looked at her, then looked
away. He was extraordinarily moved, and with the battered Greek
nose in his head, with Sandra in his head, with all sorts of things
in his head, off he started to walk right up to the top of Mount
Hymettus, alone, in the heat.</p>

<p>That very afternoon Bonamy went expressly to talk about Jacob
to tea with Clara Durrant in the square behind Sloane Street where,
on hot spring days, there are striped blinds over the front windows,
single horses pawing the macadam outside the doors, and elderly
gentlemen in yellow waistcoats ringing bells and stepping in very
politely when the maid demurely replies that Mrs. Durrant is at
home.</p>

<p>Bonamy sat with Clara in the sunny front room with the barrel
organ piping sweetly outside; the water-cart going slowly along
spraying the pavement; the carriages jingling, and all the silver
and chintz, brown and blue rugs and vases filled with green boughs,
striped with trembling yellow bars.</p>

<p>The insipidity of what was said needs no illustration &mdash;Bonamy
kept on gently returning quiet answers and accumulating amazement
at an existence squeezed and emasculated within a white satin
shoe (Mrs. Durrant meanwhile enunciating strident politics with
Sir Somebody in the back room) until the virginity of Clara's
soul appeared to him candid; the depths unknown; and he would
have brought out Jacob's name had he not begun to feel positively
certain that Clara loved him&mdash;and could do nothing whatever.</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever!" he exclaimed, as the door shut, and, for
a man of his temperament, got a very queer feeling, as he walked
through the park, of carriages irresistibly driven; of flower
beds uncompromisingly geometrical; of force rushing round geometrical
patterns in the most senseless way in the world. "Was Clara,"
he thought, pausing to watch the boys bathing in the Serpentine,
"the silent woman?&mdash;would Jacob marry her?"</p>

<p>But in Athens in the sunshine, in Athens, where it is almost
impossible to get afternoon tea, and elderly gentlemen who talk
politics talk them all the other way round, in Athens sat Sandra
Wentworth Williams, veiled, in white, her legs stretched in front
of her, one elbow on the arm of the bamboo chair, blue clouds
wavering and drifting from her cigarette.</p>

<p>The orange trees which flourish in the Square of the Constitution,
the band, the dragging of feet, the sky, the houses, lemon and
rose coloured&mdash;all this became so significant to Mrs. Wentworth
Williams after her second cup of coffee that she began dramatizing
the story of the noble and impulsive Englishwoman who had offered
a seat in her carriage to the old American lady at Mycenae (Mrs.
Duggan)&mdash;not altogether a false story, though it said nothing
of Evan, standing first on one foot, then on the other, waiting
for the women to stop chattering.</p>

<p>"I am putting the life of Father Damien into verse," Mrs. Duggan
had said, for she had lost everything&mdash;everything in the world,
husband and child and everything, but faith remained.</p>

<p>Sandra, floating from the particular to the universal, lay back
in a trance.</p>

<p>The flight of time which hurries us so tragically along; the
eternal drudge and drone, now bursting into fiery flame like those
brief balls of yellow among green leaves (she was looking at orange
trees); kisses on lips that are to die; the world turning, turning
in mazes of heat and sound&mdash;though to be sure there is the quiet
evening with its lovely pallor, "For I am sensitive to every side
of it," Sandra thought, "and Mrs. Duggan will write to me for
ever, and I shall answer her letters." Now the royal band marching
by with the national flag stirred wider rings of emotion, and
life became something that the courageous mount and ride out to
sea on&mdash;the hair blown back (so she envisaged it, and the breeze
stirred slightly among the orange trees) and she herself was emerging
from silver spray&mdash;when she saw Jacob. He was standing in the
Square with a book under his arm looking vacantly about him. That
he was heavily built and might become stout in time was a fact.</p>

<p>But she suspected him of being a mere bumpkin.</p>

<p>"There is that young man," she said, peevishly, throwing away
her cigarette, "that Mr. Flanders."</p>

<p>"Where?" said Evan. "I don't see him."</p>

<p>"Oh, walking away&mdash;behind the trees now. No, you can't see him.
But we are sure to run into him," which, of course, they did.</p>

<p>But how far was he a mere bumpkin? How far was Jacob Flanders
at the age of twenty-six a stupid fellow? It is no use trying
to sum people up. One must follow hints, not exactly what is said,
nor yet entirely what is done. Some, it is true, take ineffaceable
impressions of character at once. Others dally, loiter, and get
blown this way and that. Kind old ladies assure us that cats are
often the best judges of character. A cat will always go to a
good man, they say; but then, Mrs. Whitehorn, Jacob's landlady,
loathed cats.</p>

<p>There is also the highly respectable opinion that character-mongering
is much overdone nowadays. After all, what does it matter&mdash;that
Fanny Elmer was all sentiment and sensation, and Mrs. Durrant
hard as iron? that Clara, owing (so the character-mongers said)
largely to her mother's influence, never yet had the chance to
do anything off her own bat, and only to very observant eyes displayed
deeps of feeling which were positively alarming; and would certainly
throw herself away upon some one unworthy of her one of these
days unless, so the character-mongers said, she had a spark of
her mother's spirit in her&mdash;was somehow heroic. But what a term
to apply to Clara Durrant! Simple to a degree, others thought
her. And that is the very reason, so they said, why she attracts
Dick Bonamy&mdash;the young man with the Wellington nose. Now HE'S
a dark horse if you like. And there these gossips would suddenly
pause. Obviously they meant to hint at his peculiar disposition&mdash;long
rumoured among them.</p>

<p>"But sometimes it is precisely a woman like Clara that men of
that temperament need..." Miss Julia Eliot would hint.</p>

<p>"Well," Mr. Bowley would reply, "it may be so."</p>

<p>For however long these gossips sit, and however they stuff out
their victims' characters till they are swollen and tender as
the livers of geese exposed to a hot fire, they never come to
a decision.</p>

<p>"That young man, Jacob Flanders," they would say, "so distinguished
looking&mdash;and yet so awkward." Then they would apply themselves
to Jacob and vacillate eternally between the two extremes. He
rode to hounds&mdash;after a fashion, for he hadn't a penny.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear who his father was?" asked Julia Eliot.</p>

<p>"His mother, they say, is somehow connected with the Rocksbiers,"
replied Mr. Bowley.</p>

<p>"He doesn't overwork himself anyhow."</p>

<p>"His friends are very fond of him."</p>

<p>"Dick Bonamy, you mean?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't mean that. It's evidently the other way with Jacob.
He is precisely the young man to fall headlong in love and repent
it for the rest of his life."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Bowley," said Mrs. Durrant, sweeping down upon them
in her imperious manner, "you remember Mrs. Adams? Well, that
is her niece." And Mr. Bowley, getting up, bowed politely and
fetched strawberries.</p>

<p>So we are driven back to see what the other side means&mdash;the men
in clubs and Cabinets&mdash;when they say that character-drawing is
a frivolous fireside art, a matter of pins and needles, exquisite
outlines enclosing vacancy, flourishes, and mere scrawls.</p>

<p>The battleships ray out over the North Sea, keeping their stations
accurately apart. At a given signal all the guns are trained on
a target which (the master gunner counts the seconds, watch in
hand&mdash;at the sixth he looks up) flames into splinters. With equal
nonchalance a dozen young men in the prime of life descend with
composed faces into the depths of the sea; and there impassively
(though with perfect mastery of machinery) suffocate uncomplainingly
together. Like blocks of tin soldiers the army covers the cornfield,
moves up the hillside, stops, reels slightly this way and that,
and falls flat, save that, through field glasses, it can be seen
that one or two pieces still agitate up and down like fragments
of broken match-stick.</p>

<p>These actions, together with the incessant commerce of banks,
laboratories, chancellories, and houses of business, are the strokes
which oar the world forward, they say. And they are dealt by men
as smoothly sculptured as the impassive policeman at Ludgate Circus.
But you will observe that far from being padded to rotundity his
face is stiff from force of will, and lean from the efforts of
keeping it so. When his right arm rises, all the force in his
veins flows straight from shoulder to finger-tips; not an ounce
is diverted into sudden impulses, sentimental regrets, wire-drawn
distinctions. The buses punctually stop.</p>

<p>It is thus that we live, they say, driven by an unseizable force.
They say that the novelists never catch it; that it goes hurtling
through their nets and leaves them torn to ribbons. This, they
say, is what we live by&mdash;this unseizable force.</p>

<p>"Where are the men?" said old General Gibbons, looking round
the drawing-room, full as usual on Sunday afternoons of well-dressed
people. "Where are the guns?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Durrant looked too.</p>

<p>Clara, thinking that her mother wanted her, came in; then went
out again.</p>

<p>They were talking about Germany at the Durrants, and Jacob (driven
by this unseizable force) walked rapidly down Hermes Street and
ran straight into the Williamses.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Sandra, with a cordiality which she suddenly felt.
And Evan added, "What luck!"</p>

<p>The dinner which they gave him in the hotel which looks on to
the Square of the Constitution was excellent. Plated baskets contained
fresh rolls. There was real butter. And the meat scarcely needed
the disguise of innumerable little red and green vegetables glazed
in sauce.</p>

<p>It was strange, though. There were the little tables set out
at intervals on the scarlet floor with the Greek King's monogram
wrought in yellow. Sandra dined in her hat, veiled as usual. Evan
looked this way and that over his shoulder; imperturbable yet
supple; and sometimes sighed. It was strange. For they were English
people come together in Athens on a May evening. Jacob, helping
himself to this and that, answered intelligently, yet with a ring
in his voice.</p>

<p>The Williamses were going to Constantinople early next morning,
they said.</p>

<p>"Before you are up," said Sandra.</p>

<p>They would leave Jacob alone, then. Turning very slightly, Evan
ordered something&mdash;a bottle of wine&mdash;from which he helped Jacob,
with a kind of solicitude, with a kind of paternal solicitude,
if that were possible. To be left alone&mdash;that was good for a young
fellow. Never was there a time when the country had more need
of men. He sighed.</p>

<p>"And you have been to the Acropolis?" asked Sandra.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jacob. And they moved off to the window together,
while Evan spoke to the head waiter about calling them early.</p>

<p>"It is astonishing," said Jacob, in a gruff voice.</p>

<p>Sandra opened her eyes very slightly. Possibly her nostrils expanded
a little too.</p>

<p>"At half-past six then," said Evan, coming towards them, looking
as if he faced something in facing his wife and Jacob standing
with their backs to the window.</p>

<p>Sandra smiled at him.</p>

<p>And, as he went to the window and had nothing to say she added,
in broken half-sentences:</p>

<p>"Well, but how lovely&mdash;wouldn't it be? The Acropolis, Evan&mdash;or
are you too tired?"</p>

<p>At that Evan looked at them, or, since Jacob was staring ahead
of him, at his wife, surlily, sullenly, yet with a kind of distress&mdash;not
that she would pity him. Nor would the implacable spirit of love,
for anything he could do, cease its tortures.</p>

<p>They left him and he sat in the smoking-room, which looks out
on to the Square of the Constitution.</p>

<p>"Evan is happier alone," said Sandra. "We have been separated
from the newspapers. Well, it is better that people should have
what they want.... You have seen all these wonderful things since
we met.... What impression ... I think that you are changed."</p>

<p>"You want to go to the Acropolis," said Jacob. "Up here then."</p>

<p>"One will remember it all one's life," said Sandra.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jacob. "I wish you could have come in the day-time."</p>

<p>"This is more wonderful," said Sandra, waving her hand.</p>

<p>Jacob looked vaguely.</p>

<p>"But you should see the Parthenon in the day-time," he said.
"You couldn't come to-morrow&mdash;it would be too early?"</p>

<p>"You have sat there for hours and hours by yourself?"</p>

<p>"There were some awful women this morning," said Jacob.</p>

<p>"Awful women?" Sandra echoed.</p>

<p>"Frenchwomen."</p>

<p>"But something very wonderful has happened," said Sandra. Ten
minutes, fifteen minutes, half an hour&mdash;that was all the time
before her.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"When one is your age&mdash;when one is young. What will you do? You
will fall in love&mdash;oh yes! But don't be in too great a hurry.
I am so much older."</p>

<p>She was brushed off the pavement by parading men.</p>

<p>"Shall we go on?" Jacob asked.</p>

<p>"Let us go on," she insisted.</p>

<p>For she could not stop until she had told him&mdash;or heard him say&mdash;or
was it some action on his part that she required? Far away on
the horizon she discerned it and could not rest.</p>

<p>"You'd never get English people to sit out like this," he said.</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;no. When you get back to England you won't forget this&mdash;or
come with us to Constantinople!" she cried suddenly.</p>

<p>"But then..."</p>

<p>Sandra sighed.</p>

<p>"You must go to Delphi, of course," she said. "But," she asked
herself, "what do I want from him? Perhaps it is something that
I have missed...."</p>

<p>"You will get there about six in the evening," she said. "You
will see the eagles."</p>

<p>Jacob looked set and even desperate by the light at the street
corner and yet composed. He was suffering, perhaps. He was credulous.
Yet there was something caustic about him. He had in him the seeds
of extreme disillusionment, which would come to him from women
in middle life. Perhaps if one strove hard enough to reach the
top of the hill it need not come to him&mdash;this disillusionment
from women in middle life.</p>

<p>"The hotel is awful," she said. "The last visitors had left their
basins full of dirty water. There is always that," she laughed.</p>

<p>"The people one meets <em>ARE </em>beastly," Jacob said.</p>

<p>His excitement was clear enough.</p>

<p>"Write and tell me about it," she said. "And tell me what you
feel and what you think. Tell me everything."</p>

<p>The night was dark. The Acropolis was a jagged mound.</p>

<p>"I should like to, awfully," he said.</p>

<p>"When we get back to London, we shall meet..."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I suppose they leave the gates open?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We could climb them!" she answered wildly.</p>

<p>Obscuring the moon and altogether darkening the Acropolis the
clouds passed from east to west. The clouds solidified; the vapours
thickened; the trailing veils stayed and accumulated.</p>

<p>It was dark now over Athens, except for gauzy red streaks where
the streets ran; and the front of the Palace was cadaverous from
electric light. At sea the piers stood out, marked by separate
dots; the waves being invisible, and promontories and islands
were dark humps with a few lights.</p>

<p>"I'd love to bring my brother, if I may," Jacob murmured.</p>

<p>"And then when your mother comes to London&mdash;," said Sandra.</p>

<p>The mainland of Greece was dark; and somewhere off Euboea a cloud
must have touched the waves and spattered them&mdash;the dolphins circling
deeper and deeper into the sea. Violent was the wind now rushing
down the Sea of Marmara between Greece and the plains of Troy.</p>

<p>In Greece and the uplands of Albania and Turkey, the wind scours
the sand and the dust, and sows itself thick with dry particles.
And then it pelts the smooth domes of the mosques, and makes the
cypresses, standing stiff by the turbaned tombstones of Mohammedans,
creak and bristle.</p>

<p>Sandra's veils were swirled about her.</p>

<p>"I will give you my copy," said Jacob. "Here. Will you keep it?"</p>

<p>(The book was the poems of Donne.)</p>

<p>Now the agitation of the air uncovered a racing star. Now it
was dark. Now one after another lights were extinguished. Now
great towns&mdash;Paris&mdash;Constantinople &mdash;London&mdash;were black as
strewn rocks. Waterways might be distinguished. In England the
trees were heavy in leaf. Here perhaps in some southern wood an
old man lit dry ferns and the birds were startled. The sheep coughed;
one flower bent slightly towards another. The English sky is softer,
milkier than the Eastern. Something gentle has passed into it
from the grass-rounded hills, something damp. The salt gale blew
in at Betty Flanders's bedroom window, and the widow lady, raising
herself slightly on her elbow, sighed like one who realizes, but
would fain ward off a little longer&mdash;oh, a little longer!&mdash;the
oppression of eternity.</p>

<p>But to return to Jacob and Sandra.</p>

<p>They had vanished. There was the Acropolis; but had they reached
it? The columns and the Temple remain; the emotion of the living
breaks fresh on them year after year; and of that what remains?</p>

<p>As for reaching the Acropolis who shall say that we ever do it,
or that when Jacob woke next morning he found anything hard and
durable to keep for ever? Still, he went with them to Constantinople.</p>

<p>Sandra Wentworth Williams certainly woke to find a copy of Donne's
poems upon her dressing-table. And the book would be stood on
the shelf in the English country house where Sally Duggan's Life
of Father Damien in verse would join it one of these days. There
were ten or twelve little volumes already. Strolling in at dusk,
Sandra would open the books and her eyes would brighten (but not
at the print), and subsiding into the arm-chair she would suck
back again the soul of the moment; or, for sometimes she was restless,
would pull out book after book and swing across the whole space
of her life like an acrobat from bar to bar. She had had her moments.
Meanwhile, the great clock on the landing ticked and Sandra would
hear time accumulating, and ask herself, "What for? What for?"</p>

<p>"What for? What for?" Sandra would say, putting the book back,
and strolling to the looking-glass and pressing her hair. And
Miss Edwards would be startled at dinner, as she opened her mouth
to admit roast mutton, by Sandra's sudden solicitude: "Are you
happy, Miss Edwards?"&mdash;a thing Cissy Edwards hadn't thought of
for years.</p>

<p>"What for? What for?" Jacob never asked himself any such questions,
to judge by the way he laced his boots; shaved himself; to judge
by the depth of his sleep that night, with the wind fidgeting
at the shutters, and half-a-dozen mosquitoes singing in his ears.
He was young&mdash;a man. And then Sandra was right when she judged
him to be credulous as yet. At forty it might be a different matter.
Already he had marked the things he liked in Donne, and they were
savage enough. However, you might place beside them passages of
the purest poetry in Shakespeare.</p>

<p>But the wind was rolling the darkness through the streets of
Athens, rolling it, one might suppose, with a sort of trampling
energy of mood which forbids too close an analysis of the feelings
of any single person, or inspection of features. All faces &mdash;Greek,
Levantine, Turkish, English&mdash;would have looked much the same in
that darkness. At length the columns and the Temples whiten, yellow,
turn rose; and the Pyramids and St. Peter's arise, and at last
sluggish St. Paul's looms up.</p>

<p>The Christians have the right to rouse most cities with their
interpretation of the day's meaning. Then, less melodiously, dissenters
of different sects issue a cantankerous emendation. The steamers,
resounding like gigantic tuning-forks, state the old old fact&mdash;how
there is a sea coldly, greenly, swaying outside. But nowadays
it is the thin voice of duty, piping in a white thread from the
top of a funnel, that collects the largest multitudes, and night
is nothing but a long-drawn sigh between hammer-strokes, a deep
breath&mdash;you can hear it from an open window even in the heart
of London.</p>

<p>But who, save the nerve-worn and sleepless, or thinkers standing
with hands to the eyes on some crag above the multitude, see things
thus in skeleton outline, bare of flesh? In Surbiton the skeleton
is wrapped in flesh.</p>

<p>"The kettle never boils so well on a sunny morning," says Mrs.
Grandage, glancing at the clock on the mantelpiece. Then the grey
Persian cat stretches itself on the window-seat, and buffets a
moth with soft round paws. And before breakfast is half over (they
were late today), a baby is deposited in her lap, and she must
guard the sugar basin while Tom Grandage reads the golfing article
in the "Times," sips his coffee, wipes his moustaches, and is
off to the office, where he is the greatest authority upon the
foreign exchanges and marked for promotion. The skeleton is well
wrapped in flesh. Even this dark night when the wind rolls the
darkness through Lombard Street and Fetter Lane and Bedford Square
it stirs (since it is summer-time and the height of the season),
plane trees spangled with electric light, and curtains still preserving
the room from the dawn. People still murmur over the last word
said on the staircase, or strain, all through their dreams, for
the voice of the alarum clock. So when the wind roams through
a forest innumerable twigs stir; hives are brushed; insects sway
on grass blades; the spider runs rapidly up a crease in the bark;
and the whole air is tremulous with breathing; elastic with filaments.</p>

<p>Only here&mdash;in Lombard Street and Fetter Lane and Bedford Square&mdash;each
insect carries a globe of the world in his head, and the webs
of the forest are schemes evolved for the smooth conduct of business;
and honey is treasure of one sort and another; and the stir in
the air is the indescribable agitation of life.</p>

<p>But colour returns; runs up the stalks of the grass; blows out
into tulips and crocuses; solidly stripes the tree trunks; and
fills the gauze of the air and the grasses and pools.</p>

<p>The Bank of England emerges; and the Monument with its bristling
head of golden hair; the dray horses crossing London Bridge show
grey and strawberry and iron-coloured. There is a whir of wings
as the suburban trains rush into the terminus. And the light mounts
over the faces of all the tall blind houses, slides through a
chink and paints the lustrous bellying crimson curtains; the green
wine-glasses; the coffee-cups; and the chairs standing askew.</p>

<p>Sunlight strikes in upon shaving-glasses; and gleaming brass
cans; upon all the jolly trappings of the day; the bright, inquisitive,
armoured, resplendent, summer's day, which has long since vanquished
chaos; which has dried the melancholy mediaeval mists; drained
the swamp and stood glass and stone upon it; and equipped our
brains and bodies with such an armoury of weapons that merely
to see the flash and thrust of limbs engaged in the conduct of
daily life is better than the old pageant of armies drawn out
in battle array upon the plain.</p>
