<p>Nero thought the circus a very queer place indeed. It was as queer to
him as the wild jungle would be to you if you saw it for the first time.
But strange as it was, the circus, where he now found himself, seemed
much nicer to Nero than being cooped up in the dark ship or in the
freight car.
</p><p>For there were many wild animals in the circus--other lions, tigers,
elephants, camels, giraffes, several cages of monkeys, some wolves, a
bear or two, and others that Nero did not see until later. And there was
also a queer, wild-animal smell, which Nero liked very much. It was
almost like the smell of the jungle, and it made him homesick when he
thought of the deep tangle of green vines, the thick trees and the
silent pools of water.
</p><p>"We are glad to have you in our circus," said the elephant, who had
called himself Tum Tum, speaking to Nero. "Of course it isn't very
lively now, but wait until we get out on the road, giving a show every
day in a new place, and traveling about! Then you'll like it!"
</p><p>"Doesn't the circus stay here every day?" asked Nero, as he looked
across to another lion in a cage. Nero hoped this lion would speak to
him, but the big fellow seemed to be asleep.
</p><p>"The circus stay here? I should say not!" cried Tum Tum, speaking
through his long trunk. "Why, this is only the winter barn, where we
stay when the weather is cold. We don't have any shows in winter. The
people don't come in to see us, and we don't do any of our tricks. It is
only when the show goes on the road in summer, with the big white tent,
all covered with gay flags, and the bands playing music, that we have
the good times. Here we just rest, eat, and sometimes learn new tricks."
</p><p>"Tricks!" exclaimed Nero. "Tricks? Are they something good to eat?"
</p><p>"Tricks good to eat!" laughed Tum Tum in his jolly voice. "No indeed!
Tricks are things you do. But often, after we do ours well, the trainer
gives us good things to eat."
</p><p>"I fell into a big hole in the jungle once," said Nero. "Is that a
trick?"
</p><p>"Not exactly," answered Tum Tum. "Here, I'll show you what a trick is.
This is only one of my easy ones, though," and then suddenly the big
elephant stood on his hind legs, waving his trunk in the air.
</p><p>"Oh, so that's a trick," said Nero. "Well, I could do that."
</p><p>But when he tried to stand up on his hind legs in his cage he could not.
He had not learned how to balance himself.
</p><p>"So you do tricks in a circus, do you?" went on Nero. "That reminds me.
In the jungle I heard some monkeys speak of a circus, and also of a chap
named Mappo. Is he here?"
</p><p>"He used to be," said Tum Tum. "Mappo was one of our merriest monkeys.
We all liked him, but he went to live with some people. I don't know
where he is now. But he was in this circus. And to think of your meeting
some of his friends in the jungle! Tell me, did you see any of mine?"
</p><p>"Well, I met lots of elephants," answered Nero, "but I didn't have much
time to stop and talk with them. I met a rhinoceros, though, and he said
something about Chunky, a happy hippo, who used to live in the jungle
near him."
</p><p>"Oh, Chunky is here, in this very circus!" cried Tum Tum. "But he stays
in a water-tank, so we don't very often see him. He'll be glad to know
you met his rhinoceros friend. I'll tell him the first time I get a
chance. But, speaking of tricks, there's a chap over there who does some
fine ones," and Tum Tum pointed with his trunk to a cage in which was a
shaggy, black animal.
</p><p>"Who is it?" asked Nero.
</p><p>"Dido, the dancing bear," answered the elephant. "He dances on a
platform, which is strapped to my back out in the circus rings; he jumps
through a hoop of blazing fire; and he turns somersaults."
</p><p>"I turned some somersaults too, after they put me in a cage and brought
me from the jungle," said Nero, as he thought of his voyage on the ship.
</p><p>"Well, maybe you can learn to do them here, and that will be a trick,"
returned Tum Tum. "But you should see Dido, the dancing bear. He surely
can dance!"
</p><p>"Who is talking about me?" asked the shaggy creature in the other cage.
</p><p>"We are, Dido," answered Tum Tum. "I was just telling the new lion how
you dance on a platform over my back."
</p><p>"Oh, yes," said the bear, opening wide his mouth and showing his red
tongue. "And I wish I could soon start to doing that again. I am getting
tired of the circus barn. I want to be out in the tent."
</p><p>"It will soon be warm enough," said Tum Tum. "Summer will soon be here,
and then we shall have hot weather."
</p><p>"Does it get as hot as in the jungle?" Nero asked.
</p><p>"Sometimes," answered the jolly elephant. "But here comes your keeper,
I guess. He is going to give you some meat."
</p><p>And, surely enough, along came a circus man with a big chunk of meat on
a large, iron fork. He poked the meat in through the bars of the cage to
Nero, and the lion was so hungry that he began eating at once.
</p><p>The man who had fed him stood in front of the cage, looking at Nero.
</p><p>"You look like a fine chap," said the man, talking partly to himself and
partly to the jungle animal. "I think we shall be good friends, and I
will teach you some tricks. Then the boys and girls who come to the
circus will want to watch you. Yes, I'll teach you some tricks. Come,
let's be friends."
</p><p>Slowly and carefully the circus trainer reached his hand toward Nero's
paw, which was between two bars and partly outside the cage. Nero,
looking out of the corners of his eyes as he gnawed the bone and chewed
the meat, did not know what the man was trying to do. Perhaps the lion
thought that the man was trying to take away the meat.
</p><p>Whatever he thought, Nero suddenly jumped up and struck with all his
force at the man's hand. But the man was too quick. He pulled his hand
out of the way, and Nero's paw hit the iron bars. And as it happened to
be the paw that had been struck by the bullet, Nero felt great pain,
for the bullet was still in the flesh, though healed over.
</p><p>"Ouch!" cried Nero, in lion language.
</p><p>"That will teach you not to strike at me when I am only trying to pat
you and be kind to you," said the man with a laugh. "You are beginning
to learn things, my lion friend."
</p><p>The man stayed for some time in front of Nero's cage, talking kindly to
the lion, but Nero paid no attention to him. He only ate the meat. Then,
when it was all gone, Nero felt thirsty.
</p><p>"I'll get you some water," said the man, and he did.
</p><p>"Well, you are kind to me, anyhow," thought Nero, "even if you did try
to take away my bone," but of course the man had not tried to do that.
</p><p>For about a week Nero lived in his circus cage in the big barn, where
the animals were kept warm all winter. Nothing much happened, except
that the same man, every day, brought food and water to the wild jungle
lion. And by this time Nero was not so wild as he had been at first. He
gave up trying to break the iron bars with his paws, and no longer tried
to bite them with his teeth. They were too strong for him.
</p><p>Then, one day, the trainer man came again to the lion's cage, with a
nice, sweet piece of meat.
</p><p>"My, how good that is!" said Nero to himself, as he ate it.
</p><p>As Nero was chewing away, the man slowly put out his hand toward the
lion's paw, which was out between the bars. But Nero saw him, and again
the old fear came back that the man was going to take away the meat, and
Nero did not want that to happen.
</p><p>"Look out!" roared Nero, in lion talk. "Look out or I'll scratch you!"
</p><p>"Don't do that!" said another voice. A voice that Nero knew came from
the other lion cage, that had recently been moved up near his. "Don't be
silly, Nero!" said the other circus lion, whose name was Leo. "I used to
be as wild as you are, and live in the jungle. But they caught me and
brought me here to the circus; and now I like it very much. I, too,
tried to scratch the man when he wanted to touch my paw, but I learned
better. So must you. The man is your friend. He will feed you and give
you water to drink. So don't scratch him. He only wants to pat you and
rub you."
</p><p>"Oh, well, if he only wants to do that, all right," said Nero. "He can
do that. I thought he wanted to take my meat."
</p><p>And then, when the man saw that Nero was quieting down, he reached out
his hand again, and this time he touched Nero's big paw, with its sharp
claws. One blow of it would have broken the man's arm, but Nero did not
strike the blow. He had learned that the man would not hurt him.
</p><p>And a few days after this Nero and the trainer had become such good
friends that the man could open the iron door and go inside Nero's cage
and the lion would only blink his big eyes, and not even growl. He had
learned that the man would not hurt him.
</p><p>And so Nero's circus lessons began. The first one he learned was leaping
over a long stick which the man held stretched out in the cage. At the
beginning Nero did not know what the stick was for, but he could see
that the man did not intend to strike him with it.
</p><p>The trainer kept bringing the stick nearer and nearer to Nero, who
backed into the corner of the cage. At last the lion could back no
farther, as he was close against the wall of the cage.
</p><p>"Well, if he doesn't take that stick out of my way I'll jump right over
it!" said Nero to himself. And that is just what he did, and the man
clapped his hands in delight, and cried:
</p><p>"There! You have learned your first trick! That's fine! Now I must teach
you more!"
</p><p>Nero was fast becoming a regular circus lion.
