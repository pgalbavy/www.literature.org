<p>_(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_
</p>
<p>As I remarked once before, I am essentially a man of peace. I yearn
for a quiet life—and that’s just the one thing I don’t seem able
to have. I am always in the middle of storms and alarms. The relief
of getting away from Pagett with his incessant nosing out of
intrigues was enormous, and Miss Pettigrew is certainly a useful
creature. Although there is nothing of the houri about her, one or
two of her accomplishments are invaluable. It is true that I had
a touch of liver at Bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence,
but I had had a disturbed night in the train. At 3 a.m. an
exquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero
of the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was
going. Disregarding my first murmur of “Tea—and for God’s sake
don’t put sugar in it,” he repeated his question, laying stress on
the fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer. I
finally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no
infectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest
of motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names
and my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep,
but some officious ass aroused me at 5.30 with a cup of liquid
sugar which he called tea. I don’t think I threw it at him, but I
know that that was what I wanted to do. He brought me unsugared
tea, stone cold, at 6, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted,
to awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden
giraffe, all legs and neck!
</p><p>But for these small contretemps, all had been going smoothly. And
then fresh calamity befell.
</p><p>It was the night of our arrival at the Falls. I was dictating to
Miss Pettigrew in my sitting-room, when suddenly Mrs. Blair burst
in without a word of excuse and wearing most compromising attire.
</p><p>“Where’s Anne?” she cried.
</p><p>A nice question to ask. As though I were responsible for the girl.
What did she expect Miss Pettigrew to think? That I was in the
habit of producing Anne Beddingfeld from my pocket at midnight or
thereabouts? Very compromising for a man in my position.
</p><p>“I presume,” I said coldly, “that she is in her bed.”
</p><p>I cleared my throat and glanced at Miss Pettigrew, to show that I
was ready to resume dictating. I hoped Mrs. Blair would take the
hint. She did nothing of the kind. Instead she sank into a chair
and waved a slippered foot in an agitated manner.
</p><p>“She’s not in her room. I’ve been there. I had a dream—a terrible
dream—that she was in some awful danger, and I got up and went to
her room, just to reassure myself, you know. She wasn’t there and
her bed hadn’t been slept in.”
</p><p>She looked at me appealingly.
</p><p>“What shall I do, Sir Eustace?”
</p><p>Repressing the desire to reply, “Go to bed, and don’t worry over
nothing. An able-bodied young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is
perfectly well able to take care of herself,” I frowned judicially.
</p><p>“What does Race say about it?”
</p><p>Why should Race have it all his own way? Let him have some of the
disadvantages as well as the advantages of female society.
</p><p>“I can’t find him anywhere.”
</p><p>She was evidently making a night of it. I sighed and sat down in
a chair.
</p><p>“I don’t quite see the reason for your agitation,” I said patiently.
</p><p>“My dream——”
</p><p>“That curry we had for dinner!”
</p><p>“Oh, Sir Eustace!”
</p><p>The woman was quite indignant. And yet everybody knows that
nightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating.
</p><p>“After all,” I continued persuasively, “why shouldn’t Anne
Beddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without having the
whole hotel aroused about it?”
</p><p>“You think they’ve just gone out for a stroll together? But it’s
after midnight!”
</p><p>“One does these foolish things when one is young,” I murmured,
“though Race is certainly old enough to know better.”
</p><p>“Do you really think so?”
</p><p>“I dare say they’ve run away to make a match of it,” I continued
soothingly, though fully aware that I was making an idiotic
suggestion. For, after all, at a place like this, where is there
to run away to?
</p><p>I don’t know how much longer I should have gone on making feeble
remarks, but at that moment Race himself walked in upon us. At any
rate, I had been partly right—<u>he</u> had been out for a stroll, but
he hadn’t taken Anne with him. However, I had been quite wrong in
my way of dealing with the situation. I was soon shown that. Race
had the whole hotel turned upside-down in three minutes. I’ve never
seen a man more upset.
</p><p>The thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked
out of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven,
and she was never seen again. The idea of suicide seems impossible.
She was one of those energetic young women who are in love with
life, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There
was no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can’t
have left the place. Then where the devil is she?
</p><p>Race is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone
unturned. All the D.C.’s, or whatever they call themselves, for
hundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service. The
native trackers have run about on all fours. Everything that can
be done is being done—but no sign of Anne Beddingfeld. The accepted
theory is that she walked in her sleep. There are signs on the path
near the bridge which seem to show that the girl walked deliberately
off the edge. If so, of course, she must have been dashed to pieces
on the rocks below. Unfortunately, most of the footprints were
obliterated by a party of tourists who chose to walk that way early
on the Monday morning.
</p><p>I don’t know that it’s a very satisfactory theory. In my young
days, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn’t hurt
themselves—that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don’t
think the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either.
</p><p>I can’t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has
changed. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes
obvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used
to be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous,
hysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning
to think that it is high time I went to Jo’burg.
</p><p>A rumour came along yesterday of a mysterious island somewhere up
the river, with a man and a girl on it. Race got very excited. It
turned out to be all a mare’s-nest, however. The man had been there
for years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes
parties up and down the river in the season and points out
crocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them. I believe that
he keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat
on occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party
feel they have really got to the back of beyond at last. How long
the girl has been there is not definitely known, but it seems
pretty clear that she can’t be Anne, and there is a certain delicacy
in interfering in other people’s affairs. If I were this young
fellow, I should certainly kick Race off the island if he came
asking questions about my love affairs.
</p><p><u>Later.</u>
</p><p>It is definitely settled that I go to Jo’burg to-morrow. Race urges
me to do so. Things are getting unpleasant there, by all I hear,
but I might as well go before they get worse. I dare say I shall
be shot by a striker, anyway. Mrs. Blair was to have accompanied
me, but at the last minute she changed her mind and decided to stay
on at the Falls. It seems as though she couldn’t bear to take her
eyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some
hesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of
her souvenirs for her?
</p><p>“Not the animals?” I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I
should get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later.
</p><p>In the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small
wooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles. The animals
are to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape
Town by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored.
</p><p>The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly
awkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I
pointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home
those animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece!
</p><p>Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo’burg. I shall
make an excuse of Mrs. Blair’s cases to keep him in Cape Town. I
have written him that he must receive the cases and see to their
safe disposal, as they contain rare curios of immense value.
</p><p>So all is settled, and I and Miss Pettigrew go off into the blue
together. And any one who has seen Miss Pettigrew will admit that
it is perfectly respectable.
