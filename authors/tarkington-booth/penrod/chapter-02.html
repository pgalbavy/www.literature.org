<p>The author of "Harold Ramorez," etc., lit one of the hayseed
cigarettes, seated himself comfortably, with his back against
the wall and his right shoulder just under the lantern, elevated
his knees to support the note-book, turned to a blank page, and
wrote, slowly and earnestly:</p>

<p>"<em>CHAPITER THE SIXTH</em>"</p>

<p>He took a knife from his pocket, and, broodingly, his eyes upon
the inward embryos of vision, sharpened his pencil. After that,
he extended a foot and meditatively rubbed Duke's back with the
side of his shoe. Creation, with Penrod, did not leap, full-armed,
from the brain; but finally he began to produce. He wrote very
slowly at first, and then with increasing rapidity; faster and
faster, gathering momentum and growing more and more fevered as
he sped, till at last the true fire came, without which no lamp
of real literature may be made to burn.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson reched for his gun but our hero had him covred and
soon said Well I guess you don't come any of that on me my freind.</p>

<p>Well what makes you so sure about it sneered the other bitting
his lip so savageley that the blood ran. You are nothing but a
common Roadagent any way and I do not propose to be bafled by
such, Ramorez laughed at this and kep Mr. Wilson covred by his
ottomatick.</p>

<p>Soon the two men were struggling together in the death-roes but
soon Mr Wilson got him bound and gaged his mouth and went away
for awhile leavin our hero, it was dark and he writhd at his bonds
writhing on the floor wile the rats came out of their holes and
bit him and vernim got all over him from the floor of that helish
spot but soon he managed to push the gag out of his mouth with
the end of his toungeu and got all his bonds off.</p>

<p>Soon Mr Wilson came back to tant him with his helpless condition
flowed by his gang of detectives and they said Oh look at Ramorez
sneering at his plight and tanted him with his helpless condition
because Ramorez had put the bonds back sos he would look the same
but could throw them off him when he wanted to Just look at him
now sneered they. To hear him talk you would thought he was hot
stuff and they said Look at him now, him that was going to do
so much, Oh I would not like to be in his fix.</p>

<p>Soon Harold got mad at this and jumped up with blasing eyes throwin
off his bonds like they were air Ha Ha sneered he I guess you
better not talk so much next time. Soon there flowed another awful
struggle and siezin his ottomatick back from Mr Wilson he shot
two of the detectives through the heart Bing Bing went the ottomatick
and two more went to meet their Maker only two detectives left
now and so he stabbed one and the scondrel went to meet his Maker
for now our hero was fighting for his very life. It was dark in
there now for night had falen and a terrible view met the eye
Blood was just all over everything and the rats were eatin the
dead men.</p>

<p>Soon our hero manged to get his back to the wall for he was fighting
for his very life now and shot Mr Wilson through the abodmen Oh
said Mr Wilson you&#11834; &#11834; &#11834; (The dashes are Penrod's.)</p>

<p>Mr Wilson stagerd back vile oaths soilin his lips for he was
in pain Why you&#11834; &#11834;you sneered he I will get you yet&#11834;
&#11834;you Harold Ramorez</p>

<p>The remainin scondrel had an ax which he came near our heros
head with but missed him and ramand stuck in the wall Our heros
amunition was exhaused what was he to do, the remanin scondrel
would soon get his ax lose so our hero sprung forward and bit
him till his teeth met in the flech for now our hero was fighting
for his very life. At this the remanin scondrel also cursed and
swore vile oaths. Oh sneered he&#11834; &#11834;you Harold Ramorez
what did you bite me for Yes sneered Mr Wilson also and he has
shot me in the abdomen too the&#11834;</p>

<p>Soon they were both cursin and reviln him together Why you&#11834;
&#11834; &#11834; &#11834;sneered they what did you want to injure us for&#11834;you
Harold Ramorez you have not got any sence and you think you are
so much but you are no better than anybody else and you are a&#11834;
&#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834;</p>

<p>Soon our hero could stand this no longer. If you could learn
to act like gentlmen said he I would not do any more to you now
and your low vile exppresions have not got any effect on me only
to injure your own self when you go to meet your Maker Oh I guess
you have had enogh for one day and I think you have learned a
lesson and will not soon atemp to beard Harold Ramorez again so
with a tantig laugh he cooly lit a cigarrete and takin the keys
of the cell from Mr Wilson poket went on out.</p>

<p>Soon Mr Wilson and the wonded detective manged to bind up their
wonds and got up off the floor&#11834; &#11834;it I will have that dasstads
life now sneered they if we have to swing for it&#11834; &#11834; &#11834;
&#11834;him he shall not eccape us again the low down&#11834; &#11834; &#11834;
&#11834; &#11834;</p>

<p>Chapiter seventh</p>

<p>A mule train of heavily laden burros laden with gold from the
mines was to be seen wondering among the highest clifts and gorgs
of the Rocky Mts and a tall man with a long silken mustash and
a cartigde belt could be heard cursin vile oaths because he well
knew this was the lair of Harold Ramorez Why&#11834; &#11834; &#11834;you
you&#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834; mules you sneered he because the poor mules
were not able to go any quicker &#11834; you I will show you Why&#11834;
&#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834;it sneered he his oaths growing viler
and viler I will whip you&#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834;you
sos you will not be able to walk for a week&#11834; &#11834;you you mean
old&#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834; &#11834;mules you</p>

<p>Scarcly had the vile words left his lips when&#11834;</p>

<p>"<em>PENROD</em>!"</p>

<p>It was his mother's voice, calling from the back porch.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the noon whistles began to blow, far and near;
and the romancer in the sawdust-box, summoned prosaically from
steep mountain passes above the clouds, paused with stubby pencil
halfway from lip to knee. His eyes were shining: there was a rapt
sweetness in his gaze. As he wrote, his burden had grown lighter;
thoughts of Mrs. Lora Rewbush had almost left him; and in particular
as he recounted (even by the chaste dash) the annoyed expressions
of Mr. Wilson, the wounded detective, and the silken moustached
mule-driver, he had felt mysteriously relieved concerning the
Child Sir Lancelot. Altogether he looked a better and a brighter
boy.</p>

<p>"Pen-<em>ROD</em>!"</p>

<p>The rapt look faded slowly. He sighed, but moved not.</p>

<p>"Penrod! We're having lunch early just on your account, so you'll
have plenty of time to be dressed for the pageant. Hurry!"</p>

<p>There was silence in Penrod's aerie.</p>

<p>"<em>PEN-</em>rod!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Schofields voice sounded nearer, indicating a threatened
approach. Penrod bestirred himself: he blew out the lantern, and
shouted plaintively:</p>

<p>"Well, ain't I coming fast's I can?"</p>

<p>"Do hurry," returned the voice, withdrawing; and the kitchen
door could be heard to close.</p>

<p>Languidly, Penrod proceeded to set his house in order.</p>

<p>Replacing his manuscript and pencil in the cigar-box, he carefully
buried the box in the sawdust, put the lantern and oil-can back
in the soap-box, adjusted the elevator for the reception of Duke,
and, in no uncertain tone, invited the devoted animal to enter.</p>

<p>Duke stretched himself amiably, affecting not to hear; and when
this pretence became so obvious that even a dog could keep it
up no longer, sat down in a corner, facing it, his back to his
master, and his head perpendicular, nose upward, supported by
the convergence of the two walls. This, from a dog, is the last
word, the comble of the immutable. Penrod commanded, stormed,
tried gentleness; persuaded with honeyed words and pictured rewards.
Duke's eyes looked backward; otherwise he moved not. Time elapsed.
Penrod stooped to flattery, finally to insincere caresses; then,
losing patience spouted sudden threats.</p>

<p>Duke remained immovable, frozen fast to his great gesture of
implacable despair.</p>

<p>A footstep sounded on the threshold of the store-room.</p>

<p>"Penrod, come down from that box this instant!"</p>

<p>"Ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Are you up in that sawdust-box again?" As Mrs. Schofield had
just heard her son's voice issue from the box, and also, as she
knew he was there anyhow, her question must have been put for
oratorical purposes only. "Because if you are," she continued
promptly, "I'm going to ask your papa not to let you play there
any&#11834;"</p>

<p>Penrod's forehead, his eyes, the tops of his ears, and most of
his hair, became visible to her at the top of the box. "I ain't
'playing!'" he said indignantly.</p>

<p>"Well, what <em>ARE </em>you doing?"</p>

<p>"Just coming down," he replied, in a grieved but patient tone.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you <em>COME</em>?"</p>

<p>"I got Duke here. I got to get him <em>DOWN, </em>haven't I?
You don't suppose I want to leave a poor dog in here to starve,
do you?"</p>

<p>"Well, hand him down over the side to me. Let me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'll get him down all right," said Penrod. "I got him up here,
and I guess I can get him down!"</p>

<p>"Well then, DO it!"</p>

<p>"I will if you'll let me alone. If you'll go on back to the house
I promise to be there inside of two minutes. Honest!"</p>

<p>He put extreme urgency into this, and his mother turned toward
the house. "If you're not there in two minutes&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I will be!"</p>

<p>After her departure, Penrod expended some finalities of eloquence
upon Duke, then disgustedly gathered him up in his arms, dumped
him into the basket and, shouting sternly, "All in for the ground
floor&mdash;step back there, madam&mdash;all ready, Jim!" lowered dog and
basket to the floor of the storeroom. Duke sprang out in tumultuous
relief, and bestowed frantic affection upon his master as the
latter slid down from the box.</p>

<p>Penrod dusted himself sketchily, experiencing a sense of satisfaction,
dulled by the overhanging afternoon, perhaps, but perceptible:
he had the feeling of one who has been true to a cause. The operation
of the elevator was unsinful and, save for the shock to Duke's
nervous system, it was harmless; but Penrod could not possibly
have brought himself to exhibit it in the presence of his mother
or any other grown person in the world. The reasons for secrecy
were undefined; at least, Penrod did not define them.</p>
