A MONKEY perched upon a lofty tree saw some Fishermen casting
their nets into a river, and narrowly watched their proceedings. 
The Fishermen after a while gave up fishing, and on going home to
dinner left their nets upon the bank.  The Monkey, who is the
most imitative of animals, descended from the treetop and
endeavored to do as they had done.  Having handled the net, he
threw it into the river, but became tangled in the meshes and
drowned.  With his last breath he said to himself, "I am rightly
served; for what business had I who had never handled a net to
try and catch fish?'
