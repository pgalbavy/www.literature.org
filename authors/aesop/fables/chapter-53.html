A SICK STAG lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground. 
His companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health,
and each one helped himself to a share of the food which had been
placed for his use; so that he died, not from his sickness, but
from the failure of the means of living.  
 
Evil companions bring more hurt than profit.
