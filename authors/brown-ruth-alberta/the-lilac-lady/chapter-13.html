<p>"What do you think's happened now?" asked Peace, seating herself
gloomily upon the footstool beside the invalid, and thrusting
a long grass-blade between her teeth.</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know," smiled the older girl. "You look as
if it were quite a calamity."</p>

<p>"It's worse'n a c'lamity. It's a <em>capostrophe</em>. Glen's
gone and got the croup&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, so his papa told Aunt Pen this morning. How is the poor
little fellow now?"</p>

<p>"He's better, doctor says; but his cold is dreadfully bad and
may last for days, so Elspeth can't hear the children practise
for next Sunday &mdash;I mean a week from tomorrow. That is Children's
Day, you know. And Miss Kinney has ab-so-lute-ly refused to sing
for us, 'cause Elspeth asked Mildred George to take a solo part,
too, and Miss Kinney doesn't like Mildred. Why are huming beings
so mean and horrid to each other? Now, I wouldn't care if I found
someone which could sing better'n I,&mdash;s'posing I could sing at
all. I'd just help her make all the music she could and be glad
there was somebody who could beat me."</p>

<p>"Would you really?" asked the lame girl with a queer little note
of doubt in her voice.</p>

<p>"Why, of course! I sh'd hate to think I was the best singer God
knew how to make."</p>

<p>This was an idea which the invalid had never heard expressed
before; but still somewhat skeptical, she asked, "Do you feel
that way about whistling, too?"</p>

<p>"I sure do! I like to whistle, and it's nice to know I can beat
all the boys that go to our school, and even Saint John. But you
should hear Mike O'Hara! Oh, but he can whistle! It sounds like
the woods full of birds. It's&mdash;it's&mdash;it's&mdash;" words failed her&mdash;"it's
<em>heaven</em> to listen to him. I'm glad I <em>know</em> someone
who whistles better than I can, 'cause there's that to work for,
to aim at. But if I ever get so I can whistle as well as he does,
I s'pose there will be lots better ones still. Miss Kinney wants
to be the very best singer at Hill Street Church, though, and
she's afraid if Mildred gets to taking solo parts in the exercises
folks will want her all the time; so she's just trying to spoil
the whole program that Saint Elspeth has worked so hard over."</p>

<p>Peace's observations were sometimes positively uncanny, and as
she voiced this sentiment, the Lilac Lady asked curiously, "How
do you know that is her reason? Did she tell you, or did Mildred?"</p>

<p>"Neither one. I heard Mrs. Porter tell Elspeth yesterday that
Miss Kinney had cold feet; so after she was gone, I asked about
it. Saint John was there, and Elspeth just laughed and said it
was a remark I must forget, 'cause it wasn't real kind to speak
so about anybody. But when I was in bed and they thought I'd gone
to sleep, I heard Saint John ask Elizabeth about it, and she told
him how Miss Kinney was acting, and how the program would all
be spoiled, 'cause there isn't anyone to take her place in the
solo parts, and it is too late now to drill the children for anything
else. It's even worse now, with Glen down sick so's Elspeth can't
help get up some other program."</p>

<p>"What kind of exercises were you going to have, may I ask? You
have had such hard work to keep from telling me at different times
that I thought perhaps it was a secret."</p>

<p>"Elspeth wanted it as a surprise, you know, so I thought it would
be better not to talk about it even with you. Do you care?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, dearie, only I had an idea that possibly I might
take Elizabeth's place for a few days, with Aunt Pen's help. She
used to be a famous driller for children's entertainments, and
I know she would be more than pleased to have her finger in this
pie, for she admires your young preacher very much, while Beth
is an old friend of hers. The children could come here to rehearse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but wouldn't that be fine! You do have the splendidest thinks!
Who'd take Miss Kinney's part? That's the most important of all.
Would you?"</p>

<p>"I? Oh, Peace, how could <em>I</em> take part&mdash;a cripple? I haven't
been outside these gardens for years."</p>

<p>"It's time you had a change, then. It wouldn't hurt you to be
rolled down the street in your chair, would it?"</p>

<p>"So everyone could see and pity me?" The voice was full of scathing
bitterness.</p>

<p>"So everyone could know and love you, my Lilac Lady! They couldn't
<em>help</em> loving you. I wanted to hug you the first time I
ever laid eyes on you, and I don't feel any different yet."</p>

<p>"All the world is not like you."</p>

<p>"No, I reckon it ain't, 'cause there's millions and millions
of pig-tailed Chinamen and little brown Japs, and Esquimeaux who
take baths in whale oil 'stead of water, which ain't a bit like
me. But I'm speaking of 'Merican children. They'd love you for
the way you sing and tell stories first, most likely; but when
they came to know you yourself, they'd like just the bare you.
Tony and Ethel and Lottie and George and all the rest of the Home
children can't talk enough about you, and Miss Chase says they're
'most wild to think you want 'em to come every week steady this
summer. She says a person like you can do 'em more good now than
years of sermons after they are older. She calls you the children's
'good angel.' I meant to tell you before, 'cause I thought you'd
like to know, but somehow this fuss of Elspeth's made me forget
everything else. Say! Why couldn't we get the Home children to
help us in our choruses? They usu'ly go to the church just across
the street from there on account of it being nearer, but I'm sure
the matron would let 'em help us this one time, 'specially as
tomorrow is their Children's Sunday. Tony told me."</p>

<p>"That is a splendid plan, Peace. If you think Aunt Pen and I
can take Elizabeth's place until Glen is better, I'll send Hicks
over to the Home with a note for Miss Chase, and we will have
a rehearsal this very afternoon. Can you get me the music?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Elspeth's got the song-books at the parsonage now. There
was to be a practise this afternoon for the <em>corn-tatter</em>,
but she thought she'd just have to send 'em home as fast as they
came. I'll run right over and tell her your plans so's she'll
have the children come over here instead. It will be ever so nice
to have the boys and girls from the Home take part, 'cause there
didn't begin to be enough lilies or poppies or vi'lets, and so
many had dropped out of the rose chorus that only Mittie Cole
is left. She's a good singer, though, if she doesn't get too scared."</p>

<p>"Well, you run along and get me as many copies of the cantata
as you can. Tell Elizabeth I will be very careful of them."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell her you'll take Miss Kinney's part?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," was the hasty answer. "If she asks about it, you
might say that it will be taken care of, so she need not fret
the least little bit."</p>

<p>"Oh, and say, what about the flowers for the Home children? I
guess likely we can't have them after all, 'cause we're to be
dressed up in flowers to represent our parts."</p>

<p>"Flowers? Oh, I will attend to that. Our French maid is perfection
when it comes to getting up costumes of any kind."</p>

<p>"It ain't <em>costumes</em>. It's just our flowers, but there
are daisies and poppies and vi'lets and maybe others that ain't
in blossom yet or else are all done for; so's we would either
have to buy them at the greenhouses or get artificial ones."</p>

<p>"That is easily done, dear. Elise can do wonders with crÃªpe paper
and the glue-pot. Don't you worry about the Home children if Miss
Chase will let us borrow them."</p>

<p>So Peace skipped joyously home to pour out the good news to the
preacher's troubled little wife, who was worrying alternately
over the hoarse, sick little man lying in her arms and the program
for Children's Sunday, which now looked as if it must prove a
failure in spite of all the time and hard work she had given it.
So when the child explained the Lilac Lady's plans, Elizabeth
gladly resigned the cantata music, expressed her sincere thanks
by kissing Peace warmly&mdash;for she knew, of course, that whatever
beautiful plans the young crippled neighbor might have, they were
prompted by the active brain under the bobbing brown curls&mdash;and
returned with a lighter heart to her vigil over Glen.</p>

<p>Miss Chase was glad to lend the children to Hill Street Church,
and they were overjoyed at the idea of being loaned. As they proved
to be apt pupils, they were already quite familiar with the beautiful
songs by the time the original chorus members put in appearance
at the parsonage for the afternoon's rehearsal. At first, the
regular scholars were inclined to criticize the new plans which
dragged in the little Home waifs; but Aunt Pen, who had readily
agreed to help, was very tactful, the lame girl very lovable,
and in a few minutes all the objections had been swept aside and
harmony reigned supreme. Then they settled down to hard work,
and how they did practise! Aunt Pen played the piano, Giuseppe
took up the refrain on his violin, and the great stone house fairly
rang with the chorus of the hundred or more voices. Indifference
melted into interest, and interest into enthusiasm. Before the
afternoon had drawn to a close, every heart present was fairly
aching for the coming of Children's Sunday with its beautiful
service of song, and the Lilac Lady was triumphant.</p>

<p>"But who will take Miss Kinney's part?" frowned Marjorie Hopper,
the deacon's granddaughter. "She told papa last night that she
simply washed her hands of the whole affair."</p>

<p>"Never you fret," said Peace, nodding her head sagely. "Let her
wash! We've got someone to take it who can sing lots prettier
than she ever thought of doing."</p>

<p>"Not Mildred&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Mildred's got her own part, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a sudden movement in the invalid's chair, and the lame
girl sat up with a most becoming blush tinting the waxen cheeks.
"Can you keep a secret, children?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Of course!" they shouted, gathering around her to hear what
the secret might be.</p>

<p>"Well, I am going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take Miss Kinney's place," finished Tony, with a deep sigh of
anticipated pleasure.</p>

<p>"I knew she'd do it!" crowed Peace, dancing a jig for pure joy.</p>

<p>"Will you?" asked Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Would you like it?"</p>

<p>"Like it! Well, I guess yes!" they shouted again.</p>

<p>"You can beat Miss Kinney all hollow," added George with blunt,
boyish admiration.</p>

<p>"I am not figuring on that," smiled the invalid, amused at the
thought. "I don't care any more about being 'it,' as you children
say. I just want to help Hill Street Church, for it has brought
me the sun again when I thought I had lost it forever."</p>

<p>They looked at her mystified, uncomprehending, but no one asked
her to explain; they were content to know that she was to take
the important solo part which Miss Kinney had thrown down.</p>

<p>Thus the days flew by, and Children's Sunday dawned bright and
cool. Glen was almost well, but Elizabeth did not feel that she
could leave him in any other hands, and he was still too fretful
to attend the service. In her quandary she flew to Aunt Pen, and
that worthy lady smiled happily as she answered, "Of course, I
can take charge if you wish, and I shall count it a privilege.
You have done so much for Myra&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank Peace for that. She is the one who found out her hiding-place."</p>

<p>"I do thank Peace with all my heart, and it has been a pleasure
to help her with her beautiful, generous, impulsive plans. She
suggested&mdash;well, you must come this morning and hear the children.
We simply can't let you off. Sit near the door if you like, so
you can take the baby out if he frets,&mdash;but I don't think he will.
He loves music, and we've quite a surprise in store for the congregation."</p>

<p>And indeed, it proved a great surprise, for no one saw the wheel-chair
which Hicks rolled stealthily into the tiny church early that
morning and hid so skilfully behind tall banks of fern and great
clusters of roses that only the lovely face of the lame girl could
be seen by the congregation&mdash;she was still very sensitive concerning
her sad affliction. And when the happy-hearted children, almost
covered with the garlands of flowers they carried, took their
places around their queen, the platform looked like some great,
wonderful garden, where children's faces were the blossoms.</p>

<p>And the music! How can words describe the joyous anthems which
filled the sanctuary with praise and thanksgiving, or the gloriously
sweet, silvery tones of the garden queen when she lifted her voice
and poured out her soul in song that bright June morning. All
the bitterness of the long months of anguish, despair and rebellion
had been swept forever out of her heart, and in its place reigned
the gladness, the rapture, the supreme joy which triumphs even
over death. It seemed almost as if some angel choir had opened
the gates of heaven and let the strains of celestial music flood
the earth. It was inspiring, uplifting, sublime!</p>

<p>But that was not all. When the beautiful service had ended, and
the congregation was slowly filing out into the sunshine again,
there stood the wheel-chair by the door, and the lame girl, her
blue eyes alight with happiness, her face wreathed in smiles,
greeted one by one the friends of the old days from whom she had
so long hidden herself away.</p>
