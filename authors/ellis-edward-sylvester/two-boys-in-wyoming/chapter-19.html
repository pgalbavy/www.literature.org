<p>Hank Hazletine and Jack Dudley having failed to find the missing
Fred Greenwood, let us try our hand at the task.</p>

<p>Going back to that afternoon when the elder youth from his concealment
on the crest of the ridge fired down into the little herd of antelope
grazing in the valley in front of him, and secured a supper for
the two, it will be remembered that Fred had started along the
side of the valley, with a view of placing himself beyond the
game and rendering the success of himself and friend certain.</p>

<p>He never dreamed of danger to himself. His attention was fixed
upon the pretty animals, and, hungry as he was, he felt a sympathy
for them, knowing that in all probability one of the number would
be sacrificed. Nevertheless, he put forth the utmost pains to
prevent their taking alarm, and there is hardly a doubt that he
would have succeeded in his purpose but for the catastrophe which
overtook him when half the distance had been passed.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while he was stealing forward in a crouching posture,
a low, threatening voice reached his ear. Only the single word,
"<em>Stop!</em>" was uttered, but it could not have startled the
youth more than the whir of a rattlesnake under his feet. Before
he could straighten up he turned his head like a flash. Not a
rod distant, kneeling upon one knee, was Motoza, the Sioux, with
his Winchester aimed at him!</p>

<p>Believing that he would press the trigger of his weapon the next
moment, Fred Greenwood was transfixed. He could only look at his
enemy and await the end. He was without the power to raise a finger
in his own defence.</p>

<p>"Drop gun!" commanded his master. The words showed the lad that
he had a few minutes at least to live, but the "drop" was on him
and he promptly obeyed.</p>

<p>"Drop little gun!" added the Sioux, who never wavered in keeping
his rifle pointed at the chest of the young man.</p>

<p>Fred withdrew his revolver and flung it at his feet. He was now
without a single firearm. An infant could not have been more helpless.</p>

<p>As yet he had not spoken a word. He recalled the warning of Jack
Dudley, and knew the ferocious hatred this vagrant redskin held
toward him. To appeal for mercy would delight the miscreant and
not aid the prisoner. He tried another tack.</p>

<p>"What do you want with me, Motoza?"</p>

<p>The question pleased the Sioux, who, partly lowering his rifle,
still held it ready for instant use. His ugly countenance was
broken by the old grin.</p>

<p>"Huh! You call Motoza tief, eh?"</p>

<p>"That's what I called you, and that's what you are!"</p>

<p>"Huh! Me kill you!"</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> can do that easily enough, but you'll never live
to brag about it. If the officers don't hang you, Hank Hazletine
will make daylight shine through your hide! He is only waiting
for an excuse."</p>

<p>"White man dog&mdash;me not afraid&mdash;me kill <em>him</em>!" said the
Sioux, with a dangerous glitter in his snake-like eyes.</p>

<p>"You can't do it too soon. But what are you waiting for?"</p>

<p>Motoza had not counted upon such defiance; but if it lessened
his contempt it did not diminish his hate nor weaken his purpose.</p>

<p>"You go; me follow; me point rifle if you run; if you call, me
shoot!"</p>

<p>"Which way do you wish me to travel?"</p>

<p>The Sioux pointed toward the bend in the valley for which Fred
was making when checked in this peremptory manner. To obey was
to take him further from his comrade, but he obeyed.</p>

<p>As he moved off, Motoza picked up the two weapons from the ground,
thrusting the revolver into the girdle at his waist, while he
carried the Winchester in his other hand. Fred heard him a few
paces in the rear, as well as the repetition of his threats to
fire on the least attempt of the prisoner to regain his freedom
or to attract the attention of his friends.</p>

<p>The youth never doubted that he would carry out this threat,
and he would have been a zany to draw the explosion of wrath.
He walked forward and did his best to obey the orders of his enemy
in spirit and letter.</p>

<p>The young man thought intently. The shock of the belief that
instant death impended was somewhat softened by the knowledge
that the crisis was deferred for a time at least, though it was
impossible to guess for how long.</p>

<p>What was the ultimate intention of the Sioux? It seemed probable
to Fred that he was afraid to slay him at the spot of capture,
since the body would be sure of discovery by his friends, with
a good chance of learning the identity of the assassin. What more
likely, therefore, than that he was conducting him to some remote
place, where his body would never be found?</p>

<p>It was not natural that an active, sturdy youth like Fred Greenwood
should submit to be led thus meekly to slaughter, but in what
possible way could he help himself? If he wheeled about to assail
the buck he was without a single weapon, while the Sioux was doubly
armed. A glance over his shoulder showed his enemy almost within
arm's reach.</p>

<p>Not the least trying feature of this extraordinary proceeding
was that Fred had to hear the report of Jack Dudley's rifle, followed
by his shouts, which plainly reached the ears of the one who dared
make no reply. He could only continue walking until the bend in
the valley was passed, when a change of direction took place.</p>

<p>It was no longer necessary to conceal themselves from observation,
for there was no one to be feared. From the facts that afterward
came to light there is little doubt that Tozer and Motoza had
held a conference previous to the capture and fixed upon a definite
line of procedure, for otherwise it is not conceivable that the
Sioux would have spared the life of his captive.</p>

<p>With numerous turnings, and with the sounds of Jack Dudley's
shouts and firing faintly reaching his ears, young Greenwood continued
marching in front of his captor long after the sun had set and
night closed in. He had lost all idea of the points of the compass,
but the fact that the tramp continued and that no harm was done
him inspired the prisoner with a degree of hope that was altogether
lacking at the opening of his strange adventure.</p>

<p>Suddenly a roaring noise struck him, and a short distance further
he reached the break in the canyon with which he had become familiar.
This enabled him to locate himself, and he looked around to learn
the further wishes of his master. From the moment of starting
Fred had been on the alert for a chance to make a break for liberty,
but none occurred. The Sioux was too vigilant to tempt him.</p>

<p>The long immunity from harm had given the lad a certain self-assurance.
As yet he had formed no suspicion of the real purpose of the Sioux,
but, somehow or other, he believed his own death was not likely
to be attempted for a number of hours to come.</p>

<p>"Well, Motoza, here we are! What's the next step?"</p>

<p>The Indian raised one of the hands grasping a Winchester and
pointed toward the canyon.</p>

<p>"Go dere&mdash;jump on rock!"</p>

<p>"My gracious! I can't do that!"</p>

<p>"Den me kill!"</p>

<p>As if angered beyond restraint, he made a leap toward the startled
youth, who recoiled a step, and, esteeming a death by drowning
preferable to the one which threatened him, made haste to reply:</p>

<p>"All right; I'll try it."</p>

<p>But it was necessary that the miscreant should give some instructions
to his prisoner. These were simple. He was to leap upon the rock
nearest to shore, and then, by the same means, ascend the canyon
until ordered to stop. From what has already been related concerning
Jack Dudley's experience, it will be seen that the task was difficult
and dangerous.</p>

<p>There was no choice, however. He had gained a general knowledge
of the canyon and felt almost certain he would be overtaken by
accident; but in many respects his experience was so similar to
that which was afterward undergone by his comrade that the particulars
need not be dwelt upon. He found the work less laborious than
he expected. The Sioux by gesture indicated the rocks, when they
were not clear to the boy, who found no trouble in making the
leaps. In every case he had hardly landed when the buck dropped
lightly at his side.</p>

<p>A desperate scheme was half-formed more than once while this
singular progress was going on. It was purposely to miss his footing
and allow himself to be carried away by the tumultuous torrent.
He was restrained by two good reasons. Motoza was likely to seize
him before he was swept beyond reach, and if he did not he would
inevitably drown. Accordingly, Fred kept at it until finally they
reached the ledge up which Hank Hazletine climbed twenty-four
hours later.</p>

<p>By this time a suspicion of the partial truth had penetrated
the mind of Fred. There must be some cavity in the rocks where
his captor meant to hold him for awhile as prisoner. The plan
of securing a large ransom in payment for his freedom was not
dreamt of by the youth. No one would think of looking in this
place for him, and he would be secure for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>Motoza had learned several things from his association with those
of Caucasian blood, one of which was that a rubber match-safe
is preferable to rubbing two dry sticks together when in need
of fire, or using the old-fashioned steel and flint.</p>

<p>He managed with some trouble to make Fred understand he was to
climb up the ledge, and he followed so deftly that the prisoner
was given no chance to try to prevent him. A minute after they
stood side by side, Motoza struck a match, and his captive had
a glimpse of the cavern which has already been described.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the end of the journey. This was to be the prison
of Fred Greenwood until when? When was he to be released, or was
he not to be released at all?</p>

<p>Passing well back in the gloom the two sat down, so far removed
from the roar and tumult of the torrent that they could talk without
difficulty. Fred was still apprehensive of some sudden violence
from the Sioux, and, though in the gloom he could see nothing
of him, he was ready to make the best struggle possible.</p>

<p>"Am I to stay here, Motoza?" he asked, raising his voice to a
high pitch.</p>

<p>Instead of replying directly, the Indian asked:</p>

<p>"Huh! you fader hab heap money, eh?"</p>

<p>This simple question revealed the whole plot and confirmed the
statement already made that the scheme for holding Fred Greenwood
for ransom by his relatives was arranged before his abduction
took place.</p>

<p>It was a great discovery for Fred Greenwood to make. On the instant
nearly all his fears vanished and his heart glowed with hope.
This being remembered, he can hardly be blamed for drawing matters
with rather a long bow.</p>

<p>"Yes," he made haste to say, "my father has money; a hundred
times more than I have," all which was true without involving
more than a moderate sum.</p>

<p>"He gib heap money fur <em>you</em>, eh?"</p>

<p>"Of course; I come high."</p>

<p>"He gib thousand&mdash;gib ten thousand&mdash;hundred thousand&mdash;million
dollar&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's a pretty good sum; I'm afraid my father wouldn't
think I am worth as much as that; but there's no doubt, Motoza,
he will pay you a good price; is it your plan to sell me to him?"</p>

<p>The Sioux made no answer to this, though Fred repeated the question.
The sullen silence of the Indian brought back the misgivings of
the captive. He could not doubt that he had been abducted with
a view of being ransomed, but it was impossible to credit Motoza
with the whole scheme. He must have allies, and, knowing nothing
of Bill Tozer, Fred suspected that a half-dozen vagrant Indians,
more or less, were engaged in it, though it seemed singular that
no one else had shown himself thus far.</p>

<p>Although the prisoner had been in better spirits than would be
suspected, his situation was uncomfortable and he lost hope with
the passage of the hours. Motoza refused to hold any further conversation,
and was evidently brooding over something of an unpleasant nature.
By and by he lit his pipe and silently puffed. He was sitting
on the flinty floor, with his back against the side of the cavern
and his legs thrust out in front of him.</p>

<p>Now and then, when he drew a little harder on the pipe, the glow
in the bowl revealed the tip of his nose, a part of the painted
forehead, and the glittering black eyes. It was a gruesome picture,
for, even when he was invisible, it seemed to Fred he could see
the gleam of those eyes fixed upon him.</p>

<p>"Now, I know he hates me beyond expression," mused the youth,
"and nothing would delight him more than to torture me to death.
If he agrees to give me my liberty, it will be just like him to
kill me as soon as he gets the money which father will gladly
pay for my safety."</p>

<p>It will be seen that the trend of Fred's thoughts was similar
to those of Hank Hazletine, when considering the same matter.
Whatever project might be in the minds of others, the youth would
be in danger so long as he was in the power of the wretch whom
he had unpardonably insulted.</p>

<p>Naturally, Fred had asked himself more than once whether it was
possible for him to make his escape from the cavern. It was out
of the question so long as the Sioux was his companion, but if
he should leave him alone, even for a short time, the youth was
resolved to make the attempt.</p>

<p>These and similar thoughts were chasing one another through his
brain when he fell asleep. He was very tired from his long tramp
and did not open his eyes until the faint light of morning penetrated
his prison. He had not forgotten to wind his watch, and when he
looked at it he saw to his astonishment that it was nearly eight
o'clock. He had slept for more than ten hours.</p>

<p>The next cause of his surprise was to find he was alone. Motoza
had left while he was asleep, though how long previous it was
impossible to guess. But the hunger which Fred Greenwood had felt
on more than one previous occasion was as naught compared to the
ravenous appetite that now had possession of him. It was a long
time since he had eaten, and it looked as if it would be a long
time before he ate again. There was absolutely nothing in the
cavern beside himself. He felt in his pockets in the weak hope
of finding a forgotten fish-hook that could be used, though he
possessed nothing in the nature of bait; but, inasmuch as he had
not brought a hook with him, it would not do to say he succeeded
in his search, though he displaced the piece of writing-paper
afterward found by his friend.</p>

<p>Forcing all thought of food from him for the time, he asked why,
now that his gaoler was absent, he should not pick his way down
the canyon and make a break for liberty. At the same time he could
not forget that one of the most improbable acts of the Sioux would
be to give him any chance at all to escape.</p>

<p>It was more than likely that Motoza had laid the temptation in
his way, that it might serve him as a pretext for shooting his
prisoner. Fred resolved, therefore, to be careful in all that
he did. The necessity of drinking and bathing his face was his
excuse for walking out to the border of the ledge and letting
himself down to the rock underneath. There he dipped up what water
he needed in the palms of his hands, and while doing so scanned
every part of the canyon in his field of vision.</p>

<p>He noted the narrow strip of sky far aloft, the tumbling waters
above and below where he stood, the black boulders protruding
their heads above the torrent which flung itself fiercely against
them, the craggy walls of the canyon, but nowhere did he catch
sight of the Sioux who had brought him hither. None the less,
Fred felt so certain his black eyes were watching him from some
hidden point that he did not yield to the temptation to leap to
the nearest boulder and start on his flight for liberty. Instead,
he grasped the margin of the ledge and drew himself up to his
former place.</p>

<p>There, however, he paused with folded arms and surveyed the strange
scene more leisurely than before. He was anxious to discover the
Sioux if anywhere in sight, but the fellow did not show himself.</p>

<p>The roar of the canyon had been in his ears so long that it seemed
like silence, and it had lulled him to sleep hours before. He
was still suffering from hunger and longed for the return of his
captor, for he thought he would bring food with him.</p>

<p>Providentially the lad had stood in this position but a short
time when he looked aloft toward the sky. At the moment of doing
so he uttered an exclamation of affright and leaped back into
the mouth of the cavern. The next instant a boulder that must
have weighed a ton crashed upon the ledge where he had been standing,
splintered off a number of pieces, and plunged into the torrent
below.</p>

<p>Fred did not try to make himself believe that the falling of
this mass of stone was an accident. Motoza or one of his allies
had been on the watch above for the appearance of the youth, and
when the boulder had been adjusted as well as possible it was
tumbled over into the canyon. Had Fred remained on the spot a
few moments longer he would have been crushed like an insect under
the wheel of a steam-engine.</p>

<p>It was a startling occurrence, and in his weakened condition
made him so faint that he withdrew still further into the cavern
and sat down, trembling like a leaf. His hunger had vanished and
hope almost departed.</p>

<p>"It will not do for me to leave the cavern in the daytime, for
he is waiting for me to do so. I can't do it at night without
some one to guide me. He means to keep me here until I die of
starvation."</p>

<p>Fred had come really to believe this. He knew enough of Indian
nature to understand that the race rarely inflict instant death
upon an enemy when it is in their power to subject him to torture
or slay in some horrible fashion. Motoza had not slain him before
because he was unwilling that the one whom he hated so intensely
should receive such mercy. It would be a hundredfold sweeter to
the Sioux to see his prisoner dying by inches.</p>

<p>"If he has a plan for making father pay a ransom for me it will
take a number of days to bring the thing to an end. During all
that time I am to be left without a morsel of food; he would deprive
me of water, too, if he could."</p>

<p>It was a shocking conclusion to form, but the usually clear-headed
boy became convinced he was right.</p>

<p>"Poor Jack must be worried almost to death," he murmured, sitting
on the stones and giving rein to his fancies; "he will know that
something has gone wrong with me, but he can never know what it
was. Hank will lay it to Motoza, for he has said there is nothing
too wicked for him to do, but the cowman has no way of finding
what has become of me, and he can't make Motoza tell him. He and
Jack may hunt for weeks without suspecting where I am."</p>

<p>In this declaration Fred Greenwood, as is known, was not quite
correct, though the search of his friends was fruitless.</p>
