<p>The afternoon was very hot, so hot that the breaking of the waves
on the shore sounded like the repeated sigh of some exhausted
creature, and even on the terrace under an awning the bricks were
hot, and the air danced perpetually over the short dry grass.
The red flowers in the stone basins were drooping with the heat,
and the white blossoms which had been so smooth and thick only
a few weeks ago were now dry, and their edges were curled and
yellow. Only the stiff and hostile plants of the south, whose
fleshy leaves seemed to be grown upon spines, still remained standing
upright and defied the sun to beat them down. It was too hot to
talk, and it was not easy to find any book that would withstand
the power of the sun. Many books had been tried and then let fall,
and now Terence was reading Milton aloud, because he said the
words of Milton had substance and shape, so that it was not necessary
to understand what he was saying; one could merely listen to his
words; one could almost handle them.</p>

<p>There is a gentle nymph not far from hence,</p>

<p>he read,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
That with moist curb sways the smooth Severn stream.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabrina is her name, a virgin pure;<br/>
Whilom she was the daughter of Locrine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That had the sceptre from his father Brute.

</p>
</div>
<p>The words, in spite of what Terence had said, seemed to be laden
with meaning, and perhaps it was for this reason that it was painful
to listen to them; they sounded strange; they meant different
things from what they usually meant. Rachel at any rate could
not keep her attention fixed upon them, but went off upon curious
trains of thought suggested by words such as "curb" and "Locrine"
and "Brute," which brought unpleasant sights before her eyes,
independently of their meaning. Owing to the heat and the dancing
air the garden too looked strange&mdash;the trees were either too near
or too far, and her head almost certainly ached. She was not quite
certain, and therefore she did not know, whether to tell Terence
now, or to let him go on reading. She decided that she would wait
until he came to the end of a stanza, and if by that time she
had turned her head this way and that, and it ached in every position
undoubtedly, she would say very calmly that her head ached.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
Sabrina fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen where thou art sitting<br/>
Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In twisted braids of lilies knitting<br/>
The loose train of thy amber dropping hair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen for dear honour's sake,<br/>
Goddess of the silver lake,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen and save!

</p>
</div>
<p>But her head ached; it ached whichever way she turned it.</p>

<p>She sat up and said as she had determined, "My head aches so
that I shall go indoors." He was half-way through the next verse,
but he dropped the book instantly.</p>

<p>"Your head aches?" he repeated.</p>

<p>For a few moments they sat looking at one another in silence,
holding each other's hands. During this time his sense of dismay
and catastrophe were almost physically painful; all round him
he seemed to hear the shiver of broken glass which, as it fell
to earth, left him sitting in the open air. But at the end of
two minutes, noticing that she was not sharing his dismay, but
was only rather more languid and heavy-eyed than usual, he recovered,
fetched Helen, and asked her to tell him what they had better
do, for Rachel had a headache.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ambrose was not discomposed, but advised that she should
go to bed, and added that she must expect her head to ache if
she sat up to all hours and went out in the heat, but a few hours
in bed would cure it completely. Terence was unreasonably reassured
by her words, as he had been unreasonably depressed the moment
before. Helen's sense seemed to have much in common with the ruthless
good sense of nature, which avenged rashness by a headache, and,
like nature's good sense, might be depended upon.</p>

<p>Rachel went to bed; she lay in the dark, it seemed to her, for
a very long time, but at length, waking from a transparent kind
of sleep, she saw the windows white in front of her, and recollected
that some time before she had gone to bed with a headache, and
that Helen had said it would be gone when she woke. She supposed,
therefore, that she was now quite well again. At the same time
the wall of her room was painfully white, and curved slightly,
instead of being straight and flat. Turning her eyes to the window,
she was not reassured by what she saw there. The movement of the
blind as it filled with air and blew slowly out, drawing the cord
with a little trailing sound along the floor, seemed to her terrifying,
as if it were the movement of an animal in the room. She shut
her eyes, and the pulse in her head beat so strongly that each
thump seemed to tread upon a nerve, piercing her forehead with
a little stab of pain. It might not be the same headache, but
she certainly had a headache. She turned from side to side, in
the hope that the coolness of the sheets would cure her, and that
when she next opened her eyes to look the room would be as usual.
After a considerable number of vain experiments, she resolved
to put the matter beyond a doubt. She got out of bed and stood
upright, holding on to the brass ball at the end of the bedstead.
Ice-cold at first, it soon became as hot as the palm of her hand,
and as the pains in her head and body and the instability of the
floor proved that it would be far more intolerable to stand and
walk than to lie in bed, she got into bed again; but though the
change was refreshing at first, the discomfort of bed was soon
as great as the discomfort of standing up. She accepted the idea
that she would have to stay in bed all day long, and as she laid
her head on the pillow, relinquished the happiness of the day.</p>

<p>When Helen came in an hour or two later, suddenly stopped her
cheerful words, looked startled for a second and then unnaturally
calm, the fact that she was ill was put beyond a doubt. It was
confirmed when the whole household knew of it, when the song that
some one was singing in the garden stopped suddenly, and when
Maria, as she brought water, slipped past the bed with averted
eyes. There was all the morning to get through, and then all the
afternoon, and at intervals she made an effort to cross over into
the ordinary world, but she found that her heat and discomfort
had put a gulf between her world and the ordinary world which
she could not bridge. At one point the door opened, and Helen
came in with a little dark man who had&mdash;it was the chief thing
she noticed about him&mdash;very hairy hands. She was drowsy and intolerably
hot, and as he seemed shy and obsequious she scarcely troubled
to answer him, although she understood that he was a doctor. At
another point the door opened and Terence came in very gently,
smiling too steadily, as she realised, for it to be natural. He
sat down and talked to her, stroking her hands until it became
irksome to her to lie any more in the same position and she turned
round, and when she looked up again Helen was beside her and Terence
had gone. It did not matter; she would see him to-morrow when
things would be ordinary again. Her chief occupation during the
day was to try to remember how the lines went:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,<br/>
In twisted braids of lilies knitting<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The loose train of thy amber dropping hair;

</p>
</div>
<p>and the effort worried her because the adjectives persisted in
getting into the wrong places.</p>

<p>The second day did not differ very much from the first day, except
that her bed had become very important, and the world outside,
when she tried to think of it, appeared distinctly further off.
The glassy, cool, translucent wave was almost visible before her,
curling up at the end of the bed, and as it was refreshingly cool
she tried to keep her mind fixed upon it. Helen was here, and
Helen was there all day long; sometimes she said that it was lunchtime,
and sometimes that it was teatime; but by the next day all landmarks
were obliterated, and the outer world was so far away that the
different sounds, such as the sounds of people moving overhead,
could only be ascribed to their cause by a great effort of memory.
The recollection of what she had felt, or of what she had been
doing and thinking three days before, had faded entirely. On the
other hand, every object in the room, and the bed itself, and
her own body with its various limbs and their different sensations
were more and more important each day. She was completely cut
off, and unable to communicate with the rest of the world, isolated
alone with her body.</p>

<p>Hours and hours would pass thus, without getting any further
through the morning, or again a few minutes would lead from broad
daylight to the depths of the night. One evening when the room
appeared very dim, either because it was evening or because the
blinds were drawn, Helen said to her, "Some one is going to sit
here to-night. You won't mind?"</p>

<p>Opening her eyes, Rachel saw not only Helen but a nurse in spectacles,
whose face vaguely recalled something that she had once seen.
She had seen her in the chapel. "Nurse McInnis," said Helen, and
the nurse smiled steadily as they all did, and said that she did
not find many people who were frightened of her. After waiting
for a moment they both disappeared, and having turned on her pillow
Rachel woke to find herself in the midst of one of those interminable
nights which do not end at twelve, but go on into the double figures&mdash;thirteen,
fourteen, and so on until they reach the twenties, and then the
thirties, and then the forties. She realised that there is nothing
to prevent nights from doing this if they choose. At a great distance
an elderly woman sat with her head bent down; Rachel raised herself
slightly and saw with dismay that she was playing cards by the
light of a candle which stood in the hollow of a newspaper. The
sight had something inexplicably sinister about it, and she was
terrified and cried out, upon which the woman laid down her cards
and came across the room, shading the candle with her hands. Coming
nearer and nearer across the great space of the room, she stood
at last above Rachel's head and said, "Not asleep? Let me make
you comfortable."</p>

<p>She put down the candle and began to arrange the bedclothes.
It struck Rachel that a woman who sat playing cards in a cavern
all night long would have very cold hands, and she shrunk from
the touch of them.</p>

<p>"Why, there's a toe all the way down there!" the woman said,
proceeding to tuck in the bedclothes. Rachel did not realise that
the toe was hers.</p>

<p>"You must try and lie still," she proceeded, "because if you
lie still you will be less hot, and if you toss about you will
make yourself more hot, and we don't want you to be any hotter
than you are." She stood looking down upon Rachel for an enormous
length of time.</p>

<p>"And the quieter you lie the sooner you will be well," she repeated.</p>

<p>Rachel kept her eyes fixed upon the peaked shadow on the ceiling,
and all her energy was concentrated upon the desire that this
shadow should move. But the shadow and the woman seemed to be
eternally fixed above her. She shut her eyes. When she opened
them again several more hours had passed, but the night still
lasted interminably. The woman was still playing cards, only she
sat now in a tunnel under a river, and the light stood in a little
archway in the wall above her. She cried "Terence!" and the peaked
shadow again moved across the ceiling, as the woman with an enormous
slow movement rose, and they both stood still above her.</p>

<p>"It's just as difficult to keep you in bed as it was to keep
Mr. Forrest in bed," the woman said, "and he was such a tall gentleman."</p>

<p>In order to get rid of this terrible stationary sight Rachel
again shut her eyes, and found herself walking through a tunnel
under the Thames, where there were little deformed women sitting
in archways playing cards, while the bricks of which the wall
was made oozed with damp, which collected into drops and slid
down the wall. But the little old women became Helen and Nurse
McInnis after a time, standing in the window together whispering,
whispering incessantly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile outside her room the sounds, the movements, and the
lives of the other people in the house went on in the ordinary
light of the sun, throughout the usual succession of hours. When,
on the first day of her illness, it became clear that she would
not be absolutely well, for her temperature was very high, until
Friday, that day being Tuesday, Terence was filled with resentment,
not against her, but against the force outside them which was
separating them. He counted up the number of days that would almost
certainly be spoilt for them. He realised, with an odd mixture
of pleasure and annoyance, that, for the first time in his life,
he was so dependent upon another person that his happiness was
in her keeping. The days were completely wasted upon trifling,
immaterial things, for after three weeks of such intimacy and
intensity all the usual occupations were unbearably flat and beside
the point. The least intolerable occupation was to talk to St.
John about Rachel's illness, and to discuss every symptom and
its meaning, and, when this subject was exhausted, to discuss
illness of all kinds, and what caused them, and what cured them.</p>

<p>Twice every day he went in to sit with Rachel, and twice every
day the same thing happened. On going into her room, which was
not very dark, where the music was lying about as usual, and her
books and letters, his spirits rose instantly. When he saw her
he felt completely reassured. She did not look very ill. Sitting
by her side he would tell her what he had been doing, using his
natural voice to speak to her, only a few tones lower down than
usual; but by the time he had sat there for five minutes he was
plunged into the deepest gloom. She was not the same; he could
not bring them back to their old relationship; but although he
knew that it was foolish he could not prevent himself from endeavouring
to bring her back, to make her remember, and when this failed
he was in despair. He always concluded as he left her room that
it was worse to see her than not to see her, but by degrees, as
the day wore on, the desire to see her returned and became almost
too great to be borne.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning when Terence went into her room he felt the
usual increase of confidence. She turned round and made an effort
to remember certain facts from the world that was so many millions
of miles away.</p>

<p>"You have come up from the hotel?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No; I'm staying here for the present," he said. "We've just
had luncheon," he continued, "and the mail has come in. There's
a bundle of letters for you&mdash;letters from England."</p>

<p>Instead of saying, as he meant her to say, that she wished to
see them, she said nothing for some time.</p>

<p>"You see, there they go, rolling off the edge of the hill," she
said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Rolling, Rachel? What do you see rolling? There's nothing rolling."</p>

<p>"The old woman with the knife," she replied, not speaking to
Terence in particular, and looking past him. As she appeared to
be looking at a vase on the shelf opposite, he rose and took it
down.</p>

<p>"Now they can't roll any more," he said cheerfully. Nevertheless
she lay gazing at the same spot, and paid him no further attention
although he spoke to her. He became so profoundly wretched that
he could not endure to sit with her, but wandered about until
he found St. John, who was reading <em>The</em> <em>Times</em>
in the verandah. He laid it aside patiently, and heard all that
Terence had to say about delirium. He was very patient with Terence.
He treated him like a child.</p>

<p>By Friday it could not be denied that the illness was no longer
an attack that would pass off in a day or two; it was a real illness
that required a good deal of organisation, and engrossed the attention
of at least five people, but there was no reason to be anxious.
Instead of lasting five days it was going to last ten days. Rodriguez
was understood to say that there were well-known varieties of
this illness. Rodriguez appeared to think that they were treating
the illness with undue anxiety. His visits were always marked
by the same show of confidence, and in his interviews with Terence
he always waved aside his anxious and minute questions with a
kind of flourish which seemed to indicate that they were all taking
it much too seriously. He seemed curiously unwilling to sit down.</p>

<p>"A high temperature," he said, looking furtively about the room,
and appearing to be more interested in the furniture and in Helen's
embroidery than in anything else. "In this climate you must expect
a high temperature. You need not be alarmed by that. It is the
pulse we go by" (he tapped his own hairy wrist), "and the pulse
continues excellent."</p>

<p>Thereupon he bowed and slipped out. The interview was conducted
laboriously upon both sides in French, and this, together with
the fact that he was optimistic, and that Terence respected the
medical profession from hearsay, made him less critical than he
would have been had he encountered the doctor in any other capacity.
Unconsciously he took Rodriguez' side against Helen, who seemed
to have taken an unreasonable prejudice against him.</p>

<p>When Saturday came it was evident that the hours of the day must
be more strictly organised than they had been. St. John offered
his services; he said that he had nothing to do, and that he might
as well spend the day at the villa if he could be of use. As if
they were starting on a difficult expedition together, they parcelled
out their duties between them, writing out an elaborate scheme
of hours upon a large sheet of paper which was pinned to the drawing-room
door. Their distance from the town, and the difficulty of procuring
rare things with unknown names from the most unexpected places,
made it necessary to think very carefully, and they found it unexpectedly
difficult to do the simple but practical things that were required
of them, as if they, being very tall, were asked to stoop down
and arrange minute grains of sand in a pattern on the ground.</p>

<p>It was St. John's duty to fetch what was needed from the town,
so that Terence would sit all through the long hot hours alone
in the drawing-room, near the open door, listening for any movement
upstairs, or call from Helen. He always forgot to pull down the
blinds, so that he sat in bright sunshine, which worried him without
his knowing what was the cause of it. The room was terribly stiff
and uncomfortable. There were hats in the chairs, and medicine
bottles among the books. He tried to read, but good books were
too good, and bad books were too bad, and the only thing he could
tolerate was the newspaper, which with its news of London, and
the movements of real people who were giving dinner-parties and
making speeches, seemed to give a little background of reality
to what was otherwise mere nightmare. Then, just as his attention
was fixed on the print, a soft call would come from Helen, or
Mrs. Chailey would bring in something which was wanted upstairs,
and he would run up very quietly in his socks, and put the jug
on the little table which stood crowded with jugs and cups outside
the bedroom door; or if he could catch Helen for a moment he would
ask, "How is she?"</p>

<p>"Rather restless. . . . On the whole, quieter, I think."</p>

<p>The answer would be one or the other.</p>

<p>As usual she seemed to reserve something which she did not say,
and Terence was conscious that they disagreed, and, without saying
it aloud, were arguing against each other. But she was too hurried
and pre-occupied to talk.</p>

<p>The strain of listening and the effort of making practical arrangements
and seeing that things worked smoothly, absorbed all Terence's
power. Involved in this long dreary nightmare, he did not attempt
to think what it amounted to. Rachel was ill; that was all; he
must see that there was medicine and milk, and that things were
ready when they were wanted. Thought had ceased; life itself had
come to a standstill. Sunday was rather worse than Saturday had
been, simply because the strain was a little greater every day,
although nothing else had changed. The separate feelings of pleasure,
interest, and pain, which combine to make up the ordinary day,
were merged in one long-drawn sensation of sordid misery and profound
boredom. He had never been so bored since he was shut up in the
nursery alone as a child. The vision of Rachel as she was now,
confused and heedless, had almost obliterated the vision of her
as she had been once long ago; he could hardly believe that they
had ever been happy, or engaged to be married, for what were feelings,
what was there to be felt? Confusion covered every sight and person,
and he seemed to see St. John, Ridley, and the stray people who
came up now and then from the hotel to enquire, through a mist;
the only people who were not hidden in this mist were Helen and
Rodriguez, because they could tell him something definite about
Rachel.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the day followed the usual forms. At certain hours
they went into the dining-room, and when they sat round the table
they talked about indifferent things. St. John usually made it
his business to start the talk and to keep it from dying out.</p>

<p>"I've discovered the way to get Sancho past the white house,"
said St. John on Sunday at luncheon. "You crackle a piece of paper
in his ear, then he bolts for about a hundred yards, but he goes
on quite well after that."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he wants corn. You should see that he has corn."</p>

<p>"I don't think much of the stuff they give him; and Angelo seems
a dirty little rascal."</p>

<p>There was then a long silence. Ridley murmured a few lines of
poetry under his breath, and remarked, as if to conceal the fact
that he had done so, "Very hot to-day."</p>

<p>"Two degrees higher than it was yesterday," said St. John. "I
wonder where these nuts come from," he observed, taking a nut
out of the plate, turning it over in his fingers, and looking
at it curiously.</p>

<p>"London, I should think," said Terence, looking at the nut too.</p>

<p>"A competent man of business could make a fortune here in no
time," St. John continued. "I suppose the heat does something
funny to people's brains. Even the English go a little queer.
Anyhow they're hopeless people to deal with. They kept me three-quarters
of an hour waiting at the chemist's this morning, for no reason
whatever."</p>

<p>There was another long pause. Then Ridley enquired, "Rodriguez
seems satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Quite," said Terence with decision. "It's just got to run its
course." Whereupon Ridley heaved a deep sigh. He was genuinely
sorry for every one, but at the same time he missed Helen considerably,
and was a little aggrieved by the constant presence of the two
young men.</p>

<p>They moved back into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Look here, Hirst," said Terence, "there's nothing to be done
for two hours." He consulted the sheet pinned to the door. "You
go and lie down. I'll wait here. Chailey sits with Rachel while
Helen has her luncheon."</p>

<p>It was asking a good deal of Hirst to tell him to go without
waiting for a sight of Helen. These little glimpses of Helen were
the only respites from strain and boredom, and very often they
seemed to make up for the discomfort of the day, although she
might not have anything to tell them. However, as they were on
an expedition together, he had made up his mind to obey.</p>

<p>Helen was very late in coming down. She looked like a person
who has been sitting for a long time in the dark. She was pale
and thinner, and the expression of her eyes was harassed but determined.
She ate her luncheon quickly, and seemed indifferent to what she
was doing. She brushed aside Terence's enquiries, and at last,
as if he had not spoken, she looked at him with a slight frown
and said:</p>

<p>"We can't go on like this, Terence. Either you've got to find
another doctor, or you must tell Rodriguez to stop coming, and
I'll manage for myself. It's no use for him to say that Rachel's
better; she's not better; she's worse."</p>

<p>Terence suffered a terrific shock, like that which he had suffered
when Rachel said, "My head aches." He stilled it by reflecting
that Helen was overwrought, and he was upheld in this opinion
by his obstinate sense that she was opposed to him in the argument.</p>

<p>"Do you think she's in danger?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No one can go on being as ill as that day after day&mdash;" Helen
replied. She looked at him, and spoke as if she felt some indignation
with somebody.</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll talk to Rodriguez this afternoon," he replied.</p>

<p>Helen went upstairs at once.</p>

<p>Nothing now could assuage Terence's anxiety. He could not read,
nor could he sit still, and his sense of security was shaken,
in spite of the fact that he was determined that Helen was exaggerating,
and that Rachel was not very ill. But he wanted a third person
to confirm him in his belief.</p>

<p>Directly Rodriguez came down he demanded, "Well, how is she?
Do you think her worse?"</p>

<p>"There is no reason for anxiety, I tell you&mdash;none," Rodriguez
replied in his execrable French, smiling uneasily, and making
little movements all the time as if to get away.</p>

<p>Hewet stood firmly between him and the door. He was determined
to see for himself what kind of man he was. His confidence in
the man vanished as he looked at him and saw his insignificance,
his dirty appearance, his shiftiness, and his unintelligent, hairy
face. It was strange that he had never seen this before.</p>

<p>"You won't object, of course, if we ask you to consult another
doctor?" he continued.</p>

<p>At this the little man became openly incensed.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he cried. "You have not confidence in me? You object to
my treatment? You wish me to give up the case?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," Terence replied, "but in serious illness of this
kind&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rodriguez shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It is not serious, I assure you. You are overanxious. The young
lady is not seriously ill, and I am a doctor. The lady of course
is frightened," he sneered. "I understand that perfectly."</p>

<p>"The name and address of the doctor is&mdash;?" Terence continued.</p>

<p>"There is no other doctor," Rodriguez replied sullenly. "Every
one has confidence in me. Look! I will show you."</p>

<p>He took out a packet of old letters and began turning them over
as if in search of one that would confute Terence's suspicions.
As he searched, he began to tell a story about an English lord
who had trusted him&mdash;a great English lord, whose name he had,
unfortunately, forgotten.</p>

<p>"There is no other doctor in the place," he concluded, still
turning over the letters.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Terence shortly. "I will make enquiries for
myself." Rodriguez put the letters back in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Very well," he remarked. "I have no objection."</p>

<p>He lifted his eyebrows, shrugged his shoulders, as if to repeat
that they took the illness much too seriously and that there was
no other doctor, and slipped out, leaving behind him an impression
that he was conscious that he was distrusted, and that his malice
was aroused.</p>

<p>After this Terence could no longer stay downstairs. He went up,
knocked at Rachel's door, and asked Helen whether he might see
her for a few minutes. He had not seen her yesterday. She made
no objection, and went and sat at a table in the window.</p>

<p>Terence sat down by the bedside. Rachel's face was changed. She
looked as though she were entirely concentrated upon the effort
of keeping alive. Her lips were drawn, and her cheeks were sunken
and flushed, though without colour. Her eyes were not entirely
shut, the lower half of the white part showing, not as if she
saw, but as if they remained open because she was too much exhausted
to close them. She opened them completely when he kissed her.
But she only saw an old woman slicing a man's head off with a
knife.</p>

<p>"There it falls!" she murmured. She then turned to Terence and
asked him anxiously some question about a man with mules, which
he could not understand. "Why doesn't he come? Why doesn't he
come?" she repeated. He was appalled to think of the dirty little
man downstairs in connection with illness like this, and turning
instinctively to Helen, but she was doing something at a table
in the window, and did not seem to realise how great the shock
to him must be. He rose to go, for he could not endure to listen
any longer; his heart beat quickly and painfully with anger and
misery. As he passed Helen she asked him in the same weary, unnatural,
but determined voice to fetch her more ice, and to have the jug
outside filled with fresh milk.</p>

<p>When he had done these errands he went to find Hirst. Exhausted
and very hot, St. John had fallen asleep on a bed, but Terence
woke him without scruple.</p>

<p>"Helen thinks she's worse," he said. "There's no doubt she's
frightfully ill. Rodriguez is useless. We must get another doctor."</p>

<p>"But there is no other doctor," said Hirst drowsily, sitting
up and rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't be a damned fool!" Terence exclaimed. "Of course there's
another doctor, and, if there isn't, you've got to find one. It
ought to have been done days ago. I'm going down to saddle the
horse." He could not stay still in one place.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes St. John was riding to the town in the
scorching heat in search of a doctor, his orders being to find
one and bring him back if he had to be fetched in a special train.</p>

<p>"We ought to have done it days ago," Hewet repeated angrily.</p>

<p>When he went back into the drawing-room he found that Mrs. Flushing
was there, standing very erect in the middle of the room, having
arrived, as people did in these days, by the kitchen or through
the garden unannounced.</p>

<p>"She's better?" Mrs. Flushing enquired abruptly; they did not
attempt to shake hands.</p>

<p>"No," said Terence. "If anything, they think she's worse."</p>

<p>Mrs. Flushing seemed to consider for a moment or two, looking
straight at Terence all the time.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you," she said, speaking in nervous jerks, "it's
always about the seventh day one begins to get anxious. I daresay
you've been sittin' here worryin' by yourself. You think she's
bad, but any one comin' with a fresh eye would see she was better.
Mr. Elliot's had fever; he's all right now," she threw out. "It
wasn't anythin' she caught on the expedition. What's it matter&mdash;a
few days' fever? My brother had fever for twenty-six days once.
And in a week or two he was up and about. We gave him nothin'
but milk and arrowroot&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Chailey came in with a message.</p>

<p>"I'm wanted upstairs," said Terence.</p>

<p>"You see&mdash;she'll be better," Mrs. Flushing jerked out as he left
the room. Her anxiety to persuade Terence was very great, and
when he left her without saying anything she felt dissatisfied
and restless; she did not like to stay, but she could not bear
to go. She wandered from room to room looking for some one to
talk to, but all the rooms were empty.</p>

<p>Terence went upstairs, stood inside the door to take Helen's
directions, looked over at Rachel, but did not attempt to speak
to her. She appeared vaguely conscious of his presence, but it
seemed to disturb her, and she turned, so that she lay with her
back to him.</p>

<p>For six days indeed she had been oblivious of the world outside,
because it needed all her attention to follow the hot, red, quick
sights which passed incessantly before her eyes. She knew that
it was of enormous importance that she should attend to these
sights and grasp their meaning, but she was always being just
too late to hear or see something which would explain it all.
For this reason, the faces, &mdash;Helen's face, the nurse's,
Terence's, the doctor's,&mdash;which occasionally forced themselves
very close to her, were worrying because they distracted her attention
and she might miss the clue. However, on the fourth afternoon
she was suddenly unable to keep Helen's face distinct from the
sights themselves; her lips widened as she bent down over the
bed, and she began to gabble unintelligibly like the rest. The
sights were all concerned in some plot, some adventure, some escape.
The nature of what they were doing changed incessantly, although
there was always a reason behind it, which she must endeavour
to grasp. Now they were among trees and savages, now they were
on the sea, now they were on the tops of high towers; now they
jumped; now they flew. But just as the crisis was about to happen,
something invariably slipped in her brain, so that the whole effort
had to begin over again. The heat was suffocating. At last the
faces went further away; she fell into a deep pool of sticky water,
which eventually closed over her head. She saw nothing and heard
nothing but a faint booming sound, which was the sound of the
sea rolling over her head. While all her tormentors thought that
she was dead, she was not dead, but curled up at the bottom of
the sea. There she lay, sometimes seeing darkness, sometimes light,
while every now and then some one turned her over at the bottom
of the sea.</p>

<p>After St. John had spent some hours in the heat of the sun wrangling
with evasive and very garrulous natives, he extracted the information
that there was a doctor, a French doctor, who was at present away
on a holiday in the hills. It was quite impossible, so they said,
to find him. With his experience of the country, St. John thought
it unlikely that a telegram would either be sent or received;
but having reduced the distance of the hill town, in which he
was staying, from a hundred miles to thirty miles, and having
hired a carriage and horses, he started at once to fetch the doctor
himself. He succeeded in finding him, and eventually forced the
unwilling man to leave his young wife and return forthwith. They
reached the villa at midday on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Terence came out to receive them, and St. John was struck by
the fact that he had grown perceptibly thinner in the interval;
he was white too; his eyes looked strange. But the curt speech
and the sulky masterful manner of Dr. Lesage impressed them both
favourably, although at the same time it was obvious that he was
very much annoyed at the whole affair. Coming downstairs he gave
his directions emphatically, but it never occurred to him to give
an opinion either because of the presence of Rodriguez who was
now obsequious as well as malicious, or because he took it for
granted that they knew already what was to be known.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said with a shrug of his shoulders, when Terence
asked him, "Is she very ill?"</p>

<p>They were both conscious of a certain sense of relief when Dr.
Lesage was gone, leaving explicit directions, and promising another
visit in a few hours' time; but, unfortunately, the rise of their
spirits led them to talk more than usual, and in talking they
quarrelled. They quarrelled about a road, the Portsmouth Road.
St. John said that it is macadamised where it passes Hindhead,
and Terence knew as well as he knew his own name that it is not
macadamised at that point. In the course of the argument they
said some very sharp things to each other, and the rest of the
dinner was eaten in silence, save for an occasional half-stifled
reflection from Ridley.</p>

<p>When it grew dark and the lamps were brought in, Terence felt
unable to control his irritation any longer. St. John went to
bed in a state of complete exhaustion, bidding Terence good-night
with rather more affection than usual because of their quarrel,
and Ridley retired to his books. Left alone, Terence walked up
and down the room; he stood at the open window.</p>

<p>The lights were coming out one after another in the town beneath,
and it was very peaceful and cool in the garden, so that he stepped
out on to the terrace. As he stood there in the darkness, able
only to see the shapes of trees through the fine grey light, he
was overcome by a desire to escape, to have done with this suffering,
to forget that Rachel was ill. He allowed himself to lapse into
forgetfulness of everything. As if a wind that had been raging
incessantly suddenly fell asleep, the fret and strain and anxiety
which had been pressing on him passed away. He seemed to stand
in an unvexed space of air, on a little island by himself; he
was free and immune from pain. It did not matter whether Rachel
was well or ill; it did not matter whether they were apart or
together; nothing mattered&mdash;nothing mattered. The waves beat on
the shore far away, and the soft wind passed through the branches
of the trees, seeming to encircle him with peace and security,
with dark and nothingness. Surely the world of strife and fret
and anxiety was not the real world, but this was the real world,
the world that lay beneath the superficial world, so that, whatever
happened, one was secure. The quiet and peace seemed to lap his
body in a fine cool sheet, soothing every nerve; his mind seemed
once more to expand, and become natural.</p>

<p>But when he had stood thus for a time a noise in the house roused
him; he turned instinctively and went into the drawing-room. The
sight of the lamp-lit room brought back so abruptly all that he
had forgotten that he stood for a moment unable to move. He remembered
everything, the hour, the minute even, what point they had reached,
and what was to come. He cursed himself for making believe for
a minute that things were different from what they are. The night
was now harder to face than ever.</p>

<p>Unable to stay in the empty drawing-room, he wandered out and
sat on the stairs half-way up to Rachel's room. He longed for
some one to talk to, but Hirst was asleep, and Ridley was asleep;
there was no sound in Rachel's room. The only sound in the house
was the sound of Chailey moving in the kitchen. At last there
was a rustling on the stairs overhead, and Nurse McInnis came
down fastening the links in her cuffs, in preparation for the
night's watch. Terence rose and stopped her. He had scarcely spoken
to her, but it was possible that she might confirm him in the
belief which still persisted in his own mind that Rachel was not
seriously ill. He told her in a whisper that Dr. Lesage had been
and what he had said.</p>

<p>"Now, Nurse," he whispered, "please tell me your opinion. Do
you consider that she is very seriously ill? Is she in any danger?"</p>

<p>"The doctor has said&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I want your opinion. You have had experience of many
cases like this?"</p>

<p>"I could not tell you more than Dr. Lesage, Mr. Hewet," she replied
cautiously, as though her words might be used against her. "The
case is serious, but you may feel quite certain that we are doing
all we can for Miss Vinrace." She spoke with some professional
self-approbation. But she realised perhaps that she did not satisfy
the young man, who still blocked her way, for she shifted her
feet slightly upon the stair and looked out of the window where
they could see the moon over the sea.</p>

<p>"If you ask me," she began in a curiously stealthy tone, "I never
like May for my patients."</p>

<p>"May?" Terence repeated.</p>

<p>"It may be a fancy, but I don't like to see anybody fall ill
in May," she continued. "Things seem to go wrong in May. Perhaps
it's the moon. They say the moon affects the brain, don't they,
Sir?"</p>

<p>He looked at her but he could not answer her; like all the others,
when one looked at her she seemed to shrivel beneath one's eyes
and become worthless, malicious, and untrustworthy.</p>

<p>She slipped past him and disappeared.</p>

<p>Though he went to his room he was unable even to take his clothes
off. For a long time he paced up and down, and then leaning out
of the window gazed at the earth which lay so dark against the
paler blue of the sky. With a mixture of fear and loathing he
looked at the slim black cypress trees which were still visible
in the garden, and heard the unfamiliar creaking and grating sounds
which show that the earth is still hot. All these sights and sounds
appeared sinister and full of hostility and foreboding; together
with the natives and the nurse and the doctor and the terrible
force of the illness itself they seemed to be in conspiracy against
him. They seemed to join together in their effort to extract the
greatest possible amount of suffering from him. He could not get
used to his pain, it was a revelation to him. He had never realised
before that underneath every action, underneath the life of every
day, pain lies, quiescent, but ready to devour; he seemed to be
able to see suffering, as if it were a fire, curling up over the
edges of all action, eating away the lives of men and women. He
thought for the first time with understanding of words which had
before seemed to him empty: the struggle of life; the hardness
of life. Now he knew for himself that life is hard and full of
suffering. He looked at the scattered lights in the town beneath,
and thought of Arthur and Susan, or Evelyn and Perrott venturing
out unwittingly, and by their happiness laying themselves open
to suffering such as this. How did they dare to love each other,
he wondered; how had he himself dared to live as he had lived,
rapidly and carelessly, passing from one thing to another, loving
Rachel as he had loved her? Never again would he feel secure;
he would never believe in the stability of life, or forget what
depths of pain lie beneath small happiness and feelings of content
and safety. It seemed to him as he looked back that their happiness
had never been so great as his pain was now. There had always
been something imperfect in their happiness, something they had
wanted and had not been able to get. It had been fragmentary and
incomplete, because they were so young and had not known what
they were doing.</p>

<p>The light of his candle flickered over the boughs of a tree outside
the window, and as the branch swayed in the darkness there came
before his mind a picture of all the world that lay outside his
window; he thought of the immense river and the immense forest,
the vast stretches of dry earth and the plains of the sea that
encircled the earth; from the sea the sky rose steep and enormous,
and the air washed profoundly between the sky and the sea. How
vast and dark it must be tonight, lying exposed to the wind; and
in all this great space it was curious to think how few the towns
were, and how small little rings of light, or single glow-worms
he figured them, scattered here and there, among the swelling
uncultivated folds of the world. And in those towns were little
men and women, tiny men and women. Oh, it was absurd, when one
thought of it, to sit here in a little room suffering and caring.
What did anything matter? Rachel, a tiny creature, lay ill beneath
him, and here in his little room he suffered on her account. The
nearness of their bodies in this vast universe, and the minuteness
of their bodies, seemed to him absurd and laughable. Nothing mattered,
he repeated; they had no power, no hope. He leant on the window-sill,
thinking, until he almost forgot the time and the place. Nevertheless,
although he was convinced that it was absurd and laughable, and
that they were small and hopeless, he never lost the sense that
these thoughts somehow formed part of a life which he and Rachel
would live together.</p>

<p>Owing perhaps to the change of doctor, Rachel appeared to be
rather better next day. Terribly pale and worn though Helen looked,
there was a slight lifting of the cloud which had hung all these
days in her eyes.</p>

<p>"She talked to me," she said voluntarily. "She asked me what
day of the week it was, like herself."</p>

<p>Then suddenly, without any warning or any apparent reason, the
tears formed in her eyes and rolled steadily down her cheeks.
She cried with scarcely any attempt at movement of her features,
and without any attempt to stop herself, as if she did not know
that she was crying. In spite of the relief which her words gave
him, Terence was dismayed by the sight; had everything given way?
Were there no limits to the power of this illness? Would everything
go down before it? Helen had always seemed to him strong and determined,
and now she was like a child. He took her in his arms, and she
clung to him like a child, crying softly and quietly upon his
shoulder. Then she roused herself and wiped her tears away; it
was silly to behave like that, she said; very silly, she repeated,
when there could be no doubt that Rachel was better. She asked
Terence to forgive her for her folly. She stopped at the door
and came back and kissed him without saying anything.</p>

<p>On this day indeed Rachel was conscious of what went on round
her. She had come to the surface of the dark, sticky pool, and
a wave seemed to bear her up and down with it; she had ceased
to have any will of her own; she lay on the top of the wave conscious
of some pain, but chiefly of weakness. The wave was replaced by
the side of a mountain. Her body became a drift of melting snow,
above which her knees rose in huge peaked mountains of bare bone.
It was true that she saw Helen and saw her room, but everything
had become very pale and semi-transparent. Sometimes she could
see through the wall in front of her. Sometimes when Helen went
away she seemed to go so far that Rachel's eyes could hardly follow
her. The room also had an odd power of expanding, and though she
pushed her voice out as far as possible until sometimes it became
a bird and flew away, she thought it doubtful whether it ever
reached the person she was talking to. There were immense intervals
or chasms, for things still had the power to appear visibly before
her, between one moment and the next; it sometimes took an hour
for Helen to raise her arm, pausing long between each jerky movement,
and pour out medicine. Helen's form stooping to raise her in bed
appeared of gigantic size, and came down upon her like the ceiling
falling. But for long spaces of time she would merely lie conscious
of her body floating on the top of the bed and her mind driven
to some remote corner of her body, or escaped and gone flitting
round the room. All sights were something of an effort, but the
sight of Terence was the greatest effort, because he forced her
to join mind to body in the desire to remember something. She
did not wish to remember; it troubled her when people tried to
disturb her loneliness; she wished to be alone. She wished for
nothing else in the world.</p>

<p>Although she had cried, Terence observed Helen's greater hopefulness
with something like triumph; in the argument between them she
had made the first sign of admitting herself in the wrong. He
waited for Dr. Lesage to come down that afternoon with considerable
anxiety, but with the same certainty at the back of his mind that
he would in time force them all to admit that they were in the
wrong.</p>

<p>As usual, Dr. Lesage was sulky in his manner and very short in
his answers. To Terence's demand, "She seems to be better?" he
replied, looking at him in an odd way, "She has a chance of life."</p>

<p>The door shut and Terence walked across to the window. He leant
his forehead against the pane.</p>

<p>"Rachel," he repeated to himself. "She has a chance of life.
Rachel."</p>

<p>How could they say these things of Rachel? Had any one yesterday
seriously believed that Rachel was dying? They had been engaged
for four weeks. A fortnight ago she had been perfectly well. What
could fourteen days have done to bring her from that state to
this? To realise what they meant by saying that she had a chance
of life was beyond him, knowing as he did that they were engaged.
He turned, still enveloped in the same dreary mist, and walked
towards the door. Suddenly he saw it all. He saw the room and
the garden, and the trees moving in the air, they could go on
without her; she could die. For the first time since she fell
ill he remembered exactly what she looked like and the way in
which they cared for each other. The immense happiness of feeling
her close to him mingled with a more intense anxiety than he had
felt yet. He could not let her die; he could not live without
her. But after a momentary struggle, the curtain fell again, and
he saw nothing and felt nothing clearly. It was all going on&mdash;going
on still, in the same way as before. Save for a physical pain
when his heart beat, and the fact that his fingers were icy cold,
he did not realise that he was anxious about anything. Within
his mind he seemed to feel nothing about Rachel or about any one
or anything in the world. He went on giving orders, arranging
with Mrs. Chailey, writing out lists, and every now and then he
went upstairs and put something quietly on the table outside Rachel's
door. That night Dr. Lesage seemed to be less sulky than usual.
He stayed voluntarily for a few moments, and, addressing St. John
and Terence equally, as if he did not remember which of them was
engaged to the young lady, said, "I consider that her condition
to-night is very grave."</p>

<p>Neither of them went to bed or suggested that the other should
go to bed. They sat in the drawing-room playing picquet with the
door open. St. John made up a bed upon the sofa, and when it was
ready insisted that Terence should lie upon it. They began to
quarrel as to who should lie on the sofa and who should lie upon
a couple of chairs covered with rugs. St. John forced Terence
at last to lie down upon the sofa.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Terence," he said. "You'll only get ill if
you don't sleep."</p>

<p>"Old fellow," he began, as Terence still refused, and stopped
abruptly, fearing sentimentality; he found that he was on the
verge of tears.</p>

<p>He began to say what he had long been wanting to say, that he
was sorry for Terence, that he cared for him, that he cared for
Rachel. Did she know how much he cared for her&mdash;had she said anything,
asked perhaps? He was very anxious to say this, but he refrained,
thinking that it was a selfish question after all, and what was
the use of bothering Terence to talk about such things? He was
already half asleep. But St. John could not sleep at once. If
only, he thought to himself, as he lay in the darkness, something
would happen&mdash;if only this strain would come to an end. He did
not mind what happened, so long as the succession of these hard
and dreary days was broken; he did not mind if she died. He felt
himself disloyal in not minding it, but it seemed to him that
he had no feelings left.</p>

<p>All night long there was no call or movement, except the opening
and shutting of the bedroom door once. By degrees the light returned
into the untidy room. At six the servants began to move; at seven
they crept downstairs into the kitchen; and half an hour later
the day began again.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was not the same as the days that had gone before,
although it would have been hard to say in what the difference
consisted. Perhaps it was that they seemed to be waiting for something.
There were certainly fewer things to be done than usual. People
drifted through the drawing-room &mdash;Mr. Flushing, Mr. and
Mrs. Thornbury. They spoke very apologetically in low tones, refusing
to sit down, but remaining for a considerable time standing up,
although the only thing they had to say was, "Is there anything
we can do?" and there was nothing they could do.</p>

<p>Feeling oddly detached from it all, Terence remembered how Helen
had said that whenever anything happened to you this was how people
behaved. Was she right, or was she wrong? He was too little interested
to frame an opinion of his own. He put things away in his mind,
as if one of these days he would think about them, but not now.
The mist of unreality had deepened and deepened until it had produced
a feeling of numbness all over his body. Was it his body? Were
those really his own hands?</p>

<p>This morning also for the first time Ridley found it impossible
to sit alone in his room. He was very uncomfortable downstairs,
and, as he did not know what was going on, constantly in the way;
but he would not leave the drawing-room. Too restless to read,
and having nothing to do, he began to pace up and down reciting
poetry in an undertone. Occupied in various ways&mdash;now in undoing
parcels, now in uncorking bottles, now in writing directions,
the sound of Ridley's song and the beat of his pacing worked into
the minds of Terence and St. John all the morning as a half comprehended
refrain.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
They wrestled up, they wrestled down,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They wrestled sore and still:<br/>
The fiend who blinds the eyes of men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That night he had his will.

</p>
<p>
Like stags full spent, among the bent<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They dropped awhile to rest&mdash;

</p>
</div>
<p>"Oh, it's intolerable!" Hirst exclaimed, and then checked himself,
as if it were a breach of their agreement. Again and again Terence
would creep half-way up the stairs in case he might be able to
glean news of Rachel. But the only news now was of a very fragmentary
kind; she had drunk something; she had slept a little; she seemed
quieter. In the same way, Dr. Lesage confined himself to talking
about details, save once when he volunteered the information that
he had just been called in to ascertain, by severing a vein in
the wrist, that an old lady of eighty-five was really dead. She
had a horror of being buried alive.</p>

<p>"It is a horror," he remarked, "that we generally find in the
very old, and seldom in the young." They both expressed their
interest in what he told them; it seemed to them very strange.
Another strange thing about the day was that the luncheon was
forgotten by all of them until it was late in the afternoon, and
then Mrs. Chailey waited on them, and looked strange too, because
she wore a stiff print dress, and her sleeves were rolled up above
her elbows. She seemed as oblivious of her appearance, however,
as if she had been called out of her bed by a midnight alarm of
fire, and she had forgotten, too, her reserve and her composure;
she talked to them quite familiarly as if she had nursed them
and held them naked on her knee. She assured them over and over
again that it was their duty to eat.</p>

<p>The afternoon, being thus shortened, passed more quickly than
they expected. Once Mrs. Flushing opened the door, but on seeing
them shut it again quickly; once Helen came down to fetch something,
but she stopped as she left the room to look at a letter addressed
to her. She stood for a moment turning it over, and the extraordinary
and mournful beauty of her attitude struck Terence in the way
things struck him now&mdash;as something to be put away in his mind
and to be thought about afterwards. They scarcely spoke, the argument
between them seeming to be suspended or forgotten.</p>

<p>Now that the afternoon sun had left the front of the house, Ridley
paced up and down the terrace repeating stanzas of a long poem,
in a subdued but suddenly sonorous voice. Fragments of the poem
were wafted in at the open window as he passed and repassed.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
Peor and Baalim<br/>

</div>
<p>The sound of these words were strangely discomforting to both
the young men, but they had to be borne. As the evening drew on
and the red light of the sunset glittered far away on the sea,
the same sense of desperation attacked both Terence and St. John
at the thought that the day was nearly over, and that another
night was at hand. The appearance of one light after another in
the town beneath them produced in Hirst a repetition of his terrible
and disgusting desire to break down and sob. Then the lamps were
brought in by Chailey. She explained that Maria, in opening a
bottle, had been so foolish as to cut her arm badly, but she had
bound it up; it was unfortunate when there was so much work to
be done. Chailey herself limped because of the rheumatism in her
feet, but it appeared to her mere waste of time to take any notice
of the unruly flesh of servants. The evening went on. Dr. Lesage
arrived unexpectedly, and stayed upstairs a very long time. He
came down once and drank a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>"She is very ill," he said in answer to Ridley's question. All
the annoyance had by this time left his manner, he was grave and
formal, but at the same time it was full of consideration, which
had not marked it before. He went upstairs again. The three men
sat together in the drawing-room. Ridley was quite quiet now,
and his attention seemed to be thoroughly awakened. Save for little
half-voluntary movements and exclamations that were stifled at
once, they waited in complete silence. It seemed as if they were
at last brought together face to face with something definite.</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven o'clock when Dr. Lesage again appeared in
the room. He approached them very slowly, and did not speak at
once. He looked first at St. John and then at Terence, and said
to Terence, "Mr. Hewet, I think you should go upstairs now."</p>

<p>Terence rose immediately, leaving the others seated with Dr.
Lesage standing motionless between them.</p>

<p>Chailey was in the passage outside, repeating over and over again,
"It's wicked&mdash;it's wicked."</p>

<p>Terence paid her no attention; he heard what she was saying,
but it conveyed no meaning to his mind. All the way upstairs he
kept saying to himself, "This has not happened to me. It is not
possible that this has happened to me."</p>

<p>He looked curiously at his own hand on the banisters. The stairs
were very steep, and it seemed to take him a long time to surmount
them. Instead of feeling keenly, as he knew that he ought to feel,
he felt nothing at all. When he opened the door he saw Helen sitting
by the bedside. There were shaded lights on the table, and the
room, though it seemed to be full of a great many things, was
very tidy. There was a faint and not unpleasant smell of disinfectants.
Helen rose and gave up her chair to him in silence. As they passed
each other their eyes met in a peculiar level glance, he wondered
at the extraordinary clearness of his eyes, and at the deep calm
and sadness that dwelt in them. He sat down by the bedside, and
a moment afterwards heard the door shut gently behind her. He
was alone with Rachel, and a faint reflection of the sense of
relief that they used to feel when they were left alone possessed
him. He looked at her. He expected to find some terrible change
in her, but there was none. She looked indeed very thin, and,
as far as he could see, very tired, but she was the same as she
had always been. Moreover, she saw him and knew him. She smiled
at him and said, "Hullo, Terence."</p>

<p>The curtain which had been drawn between them for so long vanished
immediately.</p>

<p>"Well, Rachel," he replied in his usual voice, upon which she
opened her eyes quite widely and smiled with her familiar smile.
He kissed her and took her hand.</p>

<p>"It's been wretched without you," he said.</p>

<p>She still looked at him and smiled, but soon a slight look of
fatigue or perplexity came into her eyes and she shut them again.</p>

<p>"But when we're together we're perfectly happy," he said. He
continued to hold her hand.</p>

<p>The light being dim, it was impossible to see any change in her
face. An immense feeling of peace came over Terence, so that he
had no wish to move or to speak. The terrible torture and unreality
of the last days were over, and he had come out now into perfect
certainty and peace. His mind began to work naturally again and
with great ease. The longer he sat there the more profoundly was
he conscious of the peace invading every corner of his soul. Once
he held his breath and listened acutely; she was still breathing;
he went on thinking for some time; they seemed to be thinking
together; he seemed to be Rachel as well as himself; and then
he listened again; no, she had ceased to breathe. So much the
better&mdash;this was death. It was nothing; it was to cease to breathe.
It was happiness, it was perfect happiness. They had now what
they had always wanted to have, the union which had been impossible
while they lived. Unconscious whether he thought the words or
spoke them aloud, he said, "No two people have ever been so happy
as we have been. No one has ever loved as we have loved."</p>

<p>It seemed to him that their complete union and happiness filled
the room with rings eddying more and more widely. He had no wish
in the world left unfulfilled. They possessed what could never
be taken from them.</p>

<p>He was not conscious that any one had come into the room, but
later, moments later, or hours later perhaps, he felt an arm behind
him. The arms were round him. He did not want to have arms round
him, and the mysterious whispering voices annoyed him. He laid
Rachel's hand, which was now cold, upon the counterpane, and rose
from his chair, and walked across to the window. The windows were
uncurtained, and showed the moon, and a long silver pathway upon
the surface of the waves.</p>

<p>"Why," he said, in his ordinary tone of voice, "look at the moon.
There's a halo round the moon. We shall have rain to-morrow."</p>

<p>The arms, whether they were the arms of man or of woman, were
round him again; they were pushing him gently towards the door.
He turned of his own accord and walked steadily in advance of
the arms, conscious of a little amusement at the strange way in
which people behaved merely because some one was dead. He would
go if they wished it, but nothing they could do would disturb
his happiness.</p>

<p>As he saw the passage outside the room, and the table with the
cups and the plates, it suddenly came over him that here was a
world in which he would never see Rachel again.</p>

<p>"Rachel! Rachel!" he shrieked, trying to rush back to her. But
they prevented him, and pushed him down the passage and into a
bedroom far from her room. Downstairs they could hear the thud
of his feet on the floor, as he struggled to break free; and twice
they heard him shout, "Rachel, Rachel!"</p>
