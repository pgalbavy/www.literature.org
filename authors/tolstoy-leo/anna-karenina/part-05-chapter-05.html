<P>
In the church there was all  Moscow, all the friends and
relations; and  during the ceremony of plighting troth, in the
brilliantly lighted church, there was an incessant flow of
discreetly subdued talk in the circle of gaily dressed women and
girls, and men in white ties, frockcoats, and uniforms. The talk
was principally kept up by the men, while the women were absorbed
in watching every detail of the ceremony, which always means so
much to them.
<P>
In the little group nearest to the bride were her two sisters:
Dolly, and the other one, the self-possessed beauty, Madame
Lvova, who had just arrived from abroad.
<P>
"Why is it Marie's in lilac, as bad as black, at a wedding?" said
Madame Korsunskaya.
<P>
"With her complexion, it's the one salvation," responded Madame
Trubetskaya. "I wonder why they had the wedding in the evening?
It's like shop-people . . ."
<P>
"So much prettier. I was married in the evening too . . ."
answered Madame Korsunskaya, and she sighed, remembering how
charming she had been that day, and how absurdly in love her
husband was, and how different it all was now.
<P>
"They say if any one's best man more than ten times, he'll never
be married. I wanted to be for the tenth time, but the post was
taken," said Count Siniavin to the pretty Princess Tcharskaya,
who had designs on him.
<P>
Princess Tcharskaya only answered with a smile. She looked at
Kitty, thinking how and when she would stand with Count Siniavin
in Kitty's place, and how she would remind him then of his joke
to-day.
<P>
Shtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor, Madame Nikolaeva, that
he meant to put the crown on Kitty's chignon for luck.
<P>
"She ought not to have worn a chignon," answered Madame
Nikolaeva, who had long ago made up her mind that if the elderly
widower she was angling for married her, the wedding should be of
the simplest. "I don't like such grandeur."
<P>
Sergey Ivanovitch was talking to Darya Alexandrovna, jestingly
assuring her that the custom of going away after the wedding was
becoming common because newly married people always felt a little
ashamed of themselves.
<P>
"Your brother may feel proud of himself. She's a marvel of
sweetness. I believe you're envious."
<P>
"Oh, I've got over that, Darya Alexandrovna," he answered, and a
melancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his face.
<P>
Stepan Arkadyevitch was telling his sister-in-law his joke about
divorce.
<P>
"The wreath wants setting straight," she answered, not hearing
him.
<P>
"What a pity she's lost her looks so," Countess Nordston said to
Madame Lvova. "Still he's not worth her little finger, is he?"
<P>
"Oh, I like him so--not because he's my future beau-frere,"
answered Madame Lvova. "And how well he's behaving! It's so
difficult, too, to look well in such a position, not to be
ridiculous. And he's not ridiculous, and not affected; one can
see he's moved."
<P>
"You expected it, I suppose?"
<P>
"Almost. She always cared for him."
<P>
"Well, we shall see which of them will step on the rug first. I
warned Kitty."
<P>
"It will make no difference," said Madame Lvova; "we're all
obedient wives; it's in our family."
<P>
"Oh, I stepped on the rug before Vassily on purpose. And you,
Dolly?"
<P>
Dolly stood beside them; she heard them, but she did not answer.
She was deeply moved. The tears stood in her eyes, and she could
not have spoken without crying. She was rejoicing over Kitty and
Levin; going back in thought to her own wedding, she glanced at
the radiant figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgot all the
present, and remembered only her own innocent love. She recalled
not herself only, but all her women-friends and acquaintances.
She thought of them on the one day of their triumph, when they
had stood hke Kitty under the wedding crown, with love and hope
and dread in their hearts, renouncing the past, and stepping
forward into the mysterious future. Among the brides that came
back to her memory, she thought too of her darlng Anna, of whose
proposed divorce she had just been hearing. And she had stood
just as innocent in orange flowers and bridal veil. And now? "It
s terribly strange," she said to herself. It was not merely the
sisters, the women-friends and female relations of the bride who
were following every detail of the ceremony. Women who were quite
strangers, mere spectators, were watching it excitedly, holding
their breath, in fear of losing a single movement or expression
of the bride and bridegroom, and angrily not answering, often not
hearing, the remarks of the callous men, who kept making joking
or irrelevant observations.
<P>
"Why has she been crying? Is she being married against her will?"
<P>
"Against her will to a fine fellow like that? A prince, isn't
he?"
<P>
"Is that her sister in the white satin? Just listen how the
deacon booms out, 'And fearing her husband.'"
<P>
"Are the choristers from Tchudovo?"
<P>
"No, from the Synod."
<P>
"I asked the footman. He says he's going to take her home to his
country place at once. Awfully rich, they say. That's why she's
being married to him."
<P>
"No, they're a well-matched pair."
<P>
"I say, Marya Vassibevna, you were making out those fly-away
crinolines were not being worn. Just look at her in the puce
dress--an ambassador's wife they say she is--how her skirt
bounces out from side to sides"
<P>
"What a pretty dear the bride is--like a lamb decked with
flowers! Well, say what you will, we women feel for our sister."
<P>
Such were the comments in the crowd of gazing women who had
succeeded in slipping in at the church doors.
