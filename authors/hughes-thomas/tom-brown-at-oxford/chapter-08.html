<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>"My father is an old commander in the Royal Navy. He was a second
cousin of Nelson's Hardy, and that, believe, was what led him
into the navy, for he had no interest whatever of his own. It
was a visit which Nelson's Hardy, then a young lieutenant, paid
to his relative, my grandfather, which decided my father, he has
told me: but he always had a strong bent to the sea, though he
was a boy of very studious habits.</p>

<p>"However, those were times when brave men who knew and loved
their profession couldn't be overlooked, and my dear old father
fought his way up step by step&mdash;not very fast certainly, but,
still fast enough to keep him in heart about his chances in life.
I can show you the accounts of some of the affairs he was in,
in James's History, which you see up on my shelf there, or I could
tell them you myself; but I hope some day, you will know him,
and then you will hear them in perfection.</p>

<p>"My father was made commander towards the end of the war, and
got a ship, which he sailed with a convoy of merchantmen from
Bristol. It was the last voyage he ever made in active service;
but the Admiralty was so well satisfied with his conduct in it
that they kept his ship in commission two years after peace was
declared. And well they might be; for in the Spanish main he fought
an action which lasted, on and off, for two days, with a French
sloop of war, and a privateer, which he always thought was an
American, either of which ought to have been a match for him.
But he had been with Vincent in the <em>Arrow</em>, and was not
likely to think much of such small odds as that. At any rate he
beat them off, and not a prize could either of them make out of
his convoy, though I believe his ship was never fit for anything
afterwards, and was broken up as soon as she was out of commission.
We have got her compasses, and the old flag which flew at the
peak through the whole voyage, at home now. It was my father's
own flag, and his fancy to have it always flying. More than half
the men were killed, or badly hit&mdash;the dear old father amongst
the rest. A ball took off part of his knee cap, and he had to
fight the last six hours of the action sitting in a chair on the
quarter-deck; but he says it made the men fight better than when
he was among them, seeing him sitting there sucking oranges.</p>

<p>"Well, he came home with a stiff leg. The Bristol merchants gave
him the freedom of the city in a gold box, and a splendidly-mounted
sword with an inscription on the blade, which hangs over the mantel-piece
at home. When I first left home, I asked him to give me his old
service sword, which used to hang by the other, and he gave it
me at once, though I was only a lad of seventeen, as he would
give me his right eye, dear old father, which is the only one
he has now; the other he lost from a cutlass wound in a boarding-party.
There it hangs, and those are his epaulettes in the tin case.
They used to lie under my pillow before I had a room of my own,
and many a cowardly down-hearted fit have they helped me to pull
through, Brown; and many a mean act have they helped to keep me
from doing. There they are always; and the sight of them brings
home the dear old man to me as nothing else does, hardly even
his letters. I must be a great scoundrel to go very wrong with
such a father.</p>

<p>"Let's see&mdash;where was I? Oh, yes; I remember. Well, my father
got his box and sword, and some very handsome letters from several
great men. We have them all in a book at home, and I know them
by heart. The ones he values most are from Collingwood, and his
old captain, Vincent, and from his cousin Nelson's Hardy, who
didn't come off very well himself after the war. But my poor old
father never got another ship. For some time he went up every
year to London, and was always, he says, very kindly received
by the people in power, and often dined with one and another Lord
of the Admiralty who had been an old messmate. But he was longing
for employment; and it used to prey on him while he was in his
prime to feel year after year slipping away and he still without
a ship. But why should I abuse people, and think it hard, when
he doesn't? 'You see, Jack,' he said to me the last time we spoke
about it, 'after all I was a battered old hulk, lame and half
blind. So was Nelson you'll say: but every man isn't a Nelson,
my boy.</p>

<p>'And though I might think I could con or fight a ship as well
as ever, I can't say other folk who didn't know me were wrong
for not agreeing with me. Would you, now Jack, appoint a lame
and blind man to command your ship, if you had one?' But he left
off applying for work as soon as he was fifty, (I just remember
the time), for he began to doubt then whether he was quite so
fit to command a vessel as a younger man; and, though he had a
much better chance after that of getting a ship (for William IV
came to the throne, who knew all about him), he never went near
the Admiralty again. 'God forbid,' he said, 'that his Majesty
should take me if there's a better man to be had.'</p>

<p>"But I have forgotten to tell you how I came into the world,
and am telling you my father's story instead of my own. You seem
to like hearing about it though, and you can't understand one
without the other. However, when my father was made commander,
he married, and bought, with his prize-money and savings, a cottage
and piece of land, in a village on the south coast, where he left
his wife when he went on his last voyage. They had waited some
years, for neither of them had any money; but there never were
two people who wanted it less, or did more good without it to
all who came near them. They had a hard time of it too, for my
father had to go on half-pay; and a commander's half-pay isn't
much to live upon and keep a family. For they had a family; three
besides me; but they are all gone. And my mother, too; she died
when I was quite a boy, and left him and me alone; and since then
I have never known what a woman's love is, for I have no near
relations; and a man with such prospects as mine had better keep
down all&mdash;however, there's no need to go into any notions; I won't
wander any more if I can help it.</p>

<p>"I know my father was very poor when my mother died, and I think
(though he never told me so) that he had mortgaged our cottage,
and was very near having to sell it at one time. The expenses
of my mother's illness had been very heavy; I know a good deal
of the best furniture was sold&mdash;all, indeed except a handsome
arm chair and a little work table of my mother's. She used to
sit in the chair, in her last illness, on our lawn, and watch
the sunsets. And he sat by her, and watched her, and sometimes
read the Bible to her; while I played about with a big black dog
we had then, named Vincent, after my father's old captain; or
with Burt, his old boatswain, who came with his wife to live with
my father before I can recollect, and lives with us still. He
did everything in the garden, and about the house; and in the
house, too, when his wife was ill, for he can turn his hand to
most anything, like most old salts. It was he who rigged up the
mast and weather-cock on the lawn, and used to let me run up the
old flag on Sundays, and on my father's wedding-day, and on the
anniversary of his action, and of Vincent's action in the Arrow.</p>

<p>"After my mother's death my father sent away all the servants,
for the boatswain and his wife are more like friends. I was wrong
to say that no woman has loved me since my mother's death, for
I believe dear old nanny loves me as if I were her own child.
My father, after this, used to sit silent for hours together,
doing nothing but look over the sea, but, except for that, was
not much changed. After a short time he took to teaching me to
read, and from that time I never was away from him for an hour,
except when I was asleep, until I went out into the world.</p>

<p>"As I told you, my father was naturally fond of study. He had
kept up the little Latin he had learnt as a boy, and had always
been reading whatever he could lay his hands on; so that I couldn't
have had a better tutor. They were no lessons to me, particularly
the geographical ones; for there was no part of the world's sea-coast
that he did not know, and could tell me what it and the people
were like; and often when Burt happened to come in at such times,
and heard what my father was talking about, he would give us some
of his adventures and ideas of geography, which were very queer
indeed.</p>

<p>"When I was nearly ten, a new vicar came. He was about my father's
age and a widower, like him; only he had no child. Like him, too,
he had no private fortune, and the living is a very poor one.
He soon became very intimate with us, and made my father his churchwarden;
and, after being present at some of our lessons, volunteered to
teach me Greek, which, he said, it was time I should begin to
learn.</p>

<p>"This was great relief to my father, who had bought a Greek grammar
and dictionary, and a delectus, some time before; and I could
see him often, dear old father, with his glass in his eye, puzzling
away over them when I was playing, or reading Cook's Voyages,
for it had grown to be the wish of his heart that I should be
a scholar, and should go into orders. So he was going to teach
me Greek himself, for there was no one in the parish except the
Vicar who knew a word of anything but English&mdash;so that he could
not have got me a tutor, and the thought of sending me to school
had never crossed his mind, even if he could have afforded to
do either. My father only sat by at Greek lessons, and took no
part; but first he began to put in a word here and there, and
then would repeat words and sentences himself, and look over my
book while I construed, and very soon was just as regular a pupil
of the Vicar's as I.</p>

<p>"The Vicar was for the most part very proud of his pupils, and
the kindest of masters; but every now and then he used to be hard
on my father, which made me furious, though he never seemed to
mind it. I used to make mistakes on purpose at those times to
show that I was worse than he at any rate. But this only happened
after we had had a political discussion at dinner; for we dined
at three, and took to our Greek afterwards, to suit the Vicar's
time, who was generally a guest. My father is a Tory, of course,
as you may guess, and the Vicar was a Liberal, of a very mild
sort, as I have since thought; a Whig of '88,' he used to call
himself. But he was in favor of the Reform Bill, which was enough
for my father, who lectured him about loyalty, and opening the
flood-gates to revolution; and used to call up old Burt from the
kitchen, where he was smoking his pipe, and ask him what he used
to think of the Radicals on board ship; and Burt's regular reply
was&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Skulks, yer honor, regular skulks. I wouldn't give the twist
of a fiddler's elbow for all the lot of 'em as ever pretended
to handle a swab, or handle a topsail.'</p>

<p>"The Vicar always tried to argue, but, as Burt and I were the
only audience, my father was always triumphant; only he took it
out of us afterwards, at the Greek. Often I used to think, when
they were reading history, and talking about the characters, that
my father was much the more liberal of the two.</p>

<p>"About this time he bought a small half-decked boat of ten tons,
for he and Burt agreed that I ought to learn to handle a boat,
although I was not to go to sea; and when they got the Vicar in
the boat on the summer evenings (for he was always ready for a
sail though he was a very bad sailor), I believe they used to
steer as near the wind as possible, and get into short chopping
seas on purpose. But I don't think he was ever frightened, though
he used sometimes to be very ill.</p>

<p>"And so I went on, learned all I could from my father, and the
Vicar, and old Burt, till I was sixteen. By that time I had begun
to think for myself; and I had made up my mind that it was time
I should do something. No boy ever wanted to leave home less,
I believe; but I saw that I must make a move if I was ever to
be what my father wished me to be. So I spoke to the Vicar, and
he quite agreed with me, and made inquiries amongst his acquaintance;
and so, before I was seventeen, I was offered the place of under-master
in a commercial school, about twenty miles from home. The Vicar
brought the offer, and my father was very angry at first; but
we talked him over, and so I took the situation.</p>

<p>"And I am very glad I did, although there were many drawbacks.
The salary was 35L a year, and for that I had to drill all the
boys in English, and arithmetic, and Latin, and to teach the Greek
grammar to the five or six who paid extra to learn it. Out of
the school I had always to be with them, and was responsible for
the discipline. It was weary work very often, and what seemed
the worst part of it to me, at the time, was the trade spirit
which leavened the whole of the establishment. The master and
owner of the school, who was a keen vulgar man, but always civil
enough to me, thought of nothing but what would pay. And this
seemed to be what filled the school. Fathers sent their boys,
because the place was so practical, and nothing was taught (except
as extras) which was not to be of so-called real use to the boys
in the world. We had our work quite clearly laid down for us;
and it was, not to put the boys in the way of getting real knowledge
or understanding, or any of the things Solomon talks about, but
to put them in the way of getting on.</p>

<p>"I spent three years at that school, and in that time I rounded
myself pretty well in Latin and Greek&mdash;better, I believe, than
I should have done if I had been at a first-rate school myself;
and I hope I did the boys some good, and taught some of them that
cunning was not the best quality to start in life with. And I
was not often very unhappy, for I could always look forward to
my holidays with my father.</p>

<p>"However, I own that I never was better pleased than one Christmas
when the Vicar came over to our cottage, and brought with him
a letter from the Principal of St. Ambrose College, Oxford, appointing
me to a servitorship. My father was even more delighted than I,
and that evening produced a bottle of old rum, which was part
of his ship's stock, and had gone all through his action, and
been in his cellar ever since. And we three in the parlor, and
old Burt and his wife in the kitchen, finished it that night;
the boatswain, I must own, taking the lion's share. The Vicar
took occasion, in the course of the evening, to hint that it was
only poor men who took these places at the University; and that
I might find some inconvenience, and suffer some annoyance, by
not being exactly in the same position as other men. But my dear
old father would not hear of it; I was now going to be in amongst
the very pick of English gentlemen&mdash;what could it matter whether
I had money or not? That was the last thing which real gentlemen
thought of. Besides, why was I to be so very poor? He should be
able to allow me whatever would be necessary to make me comfortable.
'But, Jack,' he said suddenly, later in the evening, 'one meets
low fellows everywhere. You have met them, I know, often at the
confounded school, and will meet them again. Never you be ashamed
of your poverty, my boy.' I promised readily enough, for I didn't
think I could be more tried in that way than I had been already.
I had lived for three years amongst people whose class notoriously
measured all things by a money standard; now that was all over,
I thought. It's easy making promises in the dark. The Vicar, however,
would not let the matter rest; so we resolved ourselves into a
Committee of Ways and Means, and my father engaged to lay before
us an exact statement of his affairs next day. I went to the door
with the Vicar, and he told me to come and see him in the morning.</p>

<p>"I half-guessed what he wanted to see me for. He knew all my
father's affairs perfectly well, and wished to prepare me for
what was to come in the evening. 'Your father,' he said, 'is one
of the most liberal men I ever met; he is almost the only person
who gives anything to the schools and other charities in this
parish, and he gives to the utmost. You would not wish him, I
know, to cut off these gifts, which bring the highest reward with
them, when they are made in the spirit in which he makes them.
Then he is getting old, and you would never like him to deny himself
the comforts (and few enough they are) which he is used to. He
has nothing but his half-pay to live on; and out of that he pays
50L a year for insurance; for he has insured his life, that you
may have something besides the cottage and land when he dies.
I only tell you this that you may know the facts beforehand. I
am sure you would never take a penny from him if you could help
it. But he won't be happy unless he makes you some allowance;
and he can do it without crippling himself. He has been paying
off an old mortgage on his property here for many years, by installments
of 40L a year, and the last was paid last Michaelmas; so that
it will not inconvenience him to make you that allowance. Now,
you will not be able to live properly upon that at Oxford, even
as a servitor. I speak to you now, my dear Jack, as your oldest
friend (except Burt), and you must allow me the privilege of an
old friend. I have more than I want, and I propose to make up
your allowance at Oxford to 80L a year, and upon that I think
you may manage to get on. Now, it will not be quite candid, but
I think, under the circumstances, we shall be justified in representing
to your father that 40L a year will be ample for him to allow
you. You see what I mean?</p>

<p>"I remember almost word for word what the Vicar said; for it
is not often in one's life that one meets with this sort of friend.
At first I thanked him, but refused to take anything from him.
I had saved enough, I said, to carry me through Oxford. But he
would not be put off; and I found that his heart was as much set
on making me an allowance himself as on saving my father. So I
agreed to take 25L a year from him.</p>

<p>"When we met again in the evening, to hear my father's statement,
it was as good as a play to see the dear old man, with his spectacles
on and his papers before him, proving in some wonderful way that
he could easily allow me at least 80L or 100L a year. I believe
it cost the Vicar some twinges of conscience to persuade him that
all I should want would be 40L a year; and it was very hard work;
but at last we succeeded, and it was so settled. During the next
three weeks the preparations for my start occupied us all. The
Vicar looked out all the classics, which he insisted that I should
take. There they stand on that middle shelf&mdash;all well bound, you
see, and many of them old college prizes. My father made an expedition
to the nearest town, and came back with a large new portmanteau
and hat-box; and the next day the leading tailor came over to
fit me out with new clothes. In fact, if I had not resisted stoutly,
I should have come to college with half the contents of the cottage,
and Burt as valet; for the old boatswain was as bad as the other
two. But I compromised the matter with him by accepting his pocket
compass and the picture of the brig which hangs there; the two
things, next to his wife, which he values, I believe, most in
the world.</p>

<p>"Well, it is now two years last October since I came to Oxford
as a servitor; so you see I have pretty, nearly finished my time
here. I was more than twenty then&mdash;much older as you know, than
most freshmen. I daresay it was partly owing to the difference
in age, and partly to the fact that I knew no one when I came
up, but mostly to my own bad management and odd temper, that I
did not get on better than I have done with the men here. Sometimes
I think that our college is a bad specimen, for I have made several
friends amongst out-college men. At any rate, the fact is, as
you have no doubt found out&mdash;and I hope I haven't tried at all
to conceal it&mdash;that I am out of the pale, as it were. In fact,
with the exception of one of the tutors, and one man who was a
freshman with me, I do not know a man in college except as a mere
speaking acquaintance.</p>

<p>"I had been rather thrown off my balance, I think, at the change
in my life, for at first I made a great fool of myself. I had
believed too readily what my father had said, and thought that
at Oxford I should see no more of what I had been used to. Here
I thought that the last thing a man would be valued by would be
the length of his purse, and that no one would look down upon
me because I performed some services to the college in return
for my keep, instead of paying for it in money.</p>

<p>"Yes, I made a great fool of myself, no doubt of that; and, what
is worse, I broke my promise to my father &mdash;I often <em>was</em>
ashamed of my poverty, and tried at first to hide it, for somehow
the spirit of the place carried me along with it. I couldn't help
wishing to be thought of and treated as an equal by the men. It's
a very bitter thing for a proud, shy, sensitive fellow, as I am
by nature, to have to bear the sort of assumption and insolence
one meets with. I furnished my rooms well, and dressed well. Ah!
you stare; but this is not the furniture I started with; I sold
it all when I came to my senses, and put in this tumble-down second-hand
stuff, and I have worn out my fine clothes. I know I'm not well
dressed now. (Tom nodded ready acquiescence to this position.)
Yes, though I still wince a little now and then&mdash;a great deal
oftener than I like &mdash;I don't carry any false colors. I can't
quite conquer the feeling of shame (for shame it is, I am afraid),
but at any rate I don't try to hide my poverty any longer, I haven't
for these eighteen months. I have a grim sort of pleasure in pushing
it in everybody's face. (Tom assented with a smile, remembering
how excessively uncomfortable Hardy had made him by this little
peculiarity the first time he was in his rooms.) The first thing
which opened my eyes a little was the conduct of the tradesmen.
My bills all came in within a week of the delivery of the furniture
and clothes; some of them wouldn't leave the things without payment.
I was very angry and vexed, not at the bills, for I had my savings,
which were more than enough to pay for everything. But I knew
that these same tradesmen never thought of asking for payment
under a year, oftener two, from other men. Well, it was a lesson.
Credit for gentlemen-commoners, ready-money dealings with servitors!
I owe the Oxford tradesmen much for that lesson. If they would
only treat every man who comes up as a servitor, it would save
a deal of misery.</p>

<p>"My cure was completed by much higher folk, though. I can't go
through the whole treatment, but will give you a specimen or two
of the doses, giving precedence (as is the way here) to those
administered by the highest in rank. I got them from all sorts
of people, but none did me more good than the lords' pills. Amongst
other ways of getting on I took to sparring, which was then very
much in vogue. I am a good hand at it, and very fond of it, so
that it wasn't altogether flunkeyism, I'm glad to think. In my
second term two or three fighting men came down from London, and
gave a benefit at the Weirs. I was there, and set to with one
of them. We were well matched, and both of us did our very best;
and when we had had our turn we drew down the house, as they say.
Several young tufts and others of the faster men came up to me
afterwards and complimented me. They did the same by the professional,
but it didn't occur to me at the time that they put us both in
the same category.</p>

<p>"I am free to own that I was really pleased two days afterwards,
when a most elaborate flunkey brought a card to my door inscribed
'The Viscount Philippine, Ch. Ch., at home to-night, eight o'clock&mdash;sparring.'
Luckily, I made a light dinner, and went sharp to time into Christ
Church. The porter directed me to the noble Viscount's rooms;
they were most splendid, certainly&mdash;first floor rooms in Peckwater.
I was shown into the large room, which was magnificently furnished
and lighted. A good space was cleared in the centre; there were
all sorts of bottles and glasses on the sideboard. There might
have been twelve or thirteen men present, almost all in tufts
or gentlemen commoners' caps. One or two of our college I recognized.
The fighting man was also there, stripped for sparring, which
none of the rest were. It was plain that the sport had not begun;
I think he was doing some trick of strength as I came in. My noble
host came forward with a nod and asked me if I would take anything,
and when I declined, said, 'Then will you put on the gloves?'
I looked at him rather surprised, and thought it an odd way to
treat the only stranger in his rooms. However, I stripped, put
on the gloves, and one of the others came forward to tie them
for me. While he was doing it I heard my host say to the man,
'A five-pound note, mind, if you do it within the quarter-of-an-hour.'
'Only half-minute time, then, my lord,' he answered. The man who
was tying my gloves said, 'Be steady; don't give him a chance
to knock you down.' It flashed across me in a moment now why I
was there; but it was too late to draw back; so we stood up and
began sparring. I played very steadily and light at first to see
whether my suspicions were well founded, and in two minutes I
was satisfied. My opponent tried every dodge to bring on a rally,
and when he was foiled I could see that he was shifting his glove.
I stopped and insisted that his gloves should be tied, and then
we went on again.</p>

<p>"I kept on the defensive. The man was in bad training, and luckily
I had the advantage by an inch or so in length of arm. Before
five minutes was over, I had caught enough of the bystander's
remarks to know that my noble host had betted a pony that I should
be knocked down in a quarter-of-an-hour. My one object now was
to make him lose his money. My opponent did his utmost for his
patron, and fairly winded himself in his efforts to get at me.
He had to call time twice himself. I said not a word; my time
would come I knew, if I could keep on my legs, and of this I had
little fear. I held myself together, made no attack, and my length
of arm gave me the advantage in every counter. It was all I could
do, though, to keep clear of his rushes as the time drew on. On
he came time after time, careless of guarding, and he was full
as good a man as I. 'Time's up; it's past the quarter.' 'No, by
Jove half a minute yet; now's your time, said my noble host to
his man, who answered by a rush. I met him as before with a steady
counter, but this time my blow got home under his chin, and he
staggered, lost his footing, and went fairly over on his back.</p>

<p>"Most of the bystanders seemed delighted, and some of them hurried
towards me. But I tore off the gloves, flung them on the ground,
and turned to my host. I could hardly speak, but I made an effort,
and said quietly, 'You have brought a stranger to your rooms,
and have tried to make him fight for your amusement; now I tell
you it is a blackguard act of yours&mdash;an act which no gentleman
would have done.' My noble host made no remark. I threw on my
waist-coat, and then turned to the rest and said '<em>Gentlemen</em>
would not have stood by and seen it done.' I went up to the side-board,
uncorked a bottle of champagne, and half filled a tumbler, before
a word was spoken. Then one of the visitors stepped forward and
said, 'Mr. Hardy, I hope you won't go, there has been a mistake;
we did not know of this. I am sure many of us are very sorry for
what has occurred; stay and look on, we will all of us spar.'
I looked at him, and then at my host, to see whether the latter
joined in the apology. Not he, he was doing the dignified sulky,
and most of the rest seemed to me to be with him. 'Will any of
you spar with me?' I said, tauntingly, tossing off the champagne.
'Certainly, the new speaker said directly, 'If you wish it, and
are not too tired, I will spar with you myself; you will, won't
you, James?' and he turned to one of the other men. If any of
them had backed him by a word I should probably have stayed; several
of them, I learnt afterwards, would have liked to have done so,
but it was an awkward scene to interfere in. I stopped a moment
and then said, with a sneer, 'You're too small, and none of the
other gentlemen seem inclined to offer.'</p>

<p>"I saw that I had hurt him, and felt pleased at the moment I
had done so. I was now ready to start, and I could not think of
anything more unpleasant to say at the moment; so I went up to
my antagonist, who was standing with the gloves on still, not
quite knowing what to be at, and held out my hand. 'I can shake
hands with you at any rate,' I said; 'you only did what you were
paid for in the regular way of business, and you did your best.'
He looked rather sheepish, but held out his gloved hand, which
I shook. 'Now, I have the honor to wish you all a very good evening;'
and so I left the place and got home to my own rooms, and sat
down there with several new ideas in my head. On the whole, the
lesson was not a very bitter one, for I felt that I had had the
best of the game. The only thing I really was sorry for was my
own insolence to the man who had come forward as a peacemaker.
I had remarked his face before. I don't know how it is with you,
but I can never help looking at a tuft&mdash;the gold tassel draws
one's eye somehow; and then it's an awful position, after all,
for mere boys to be placed in. So I knew his face before that
day, though I had only seen him two or three times in the street.
Now it was much more clearly impressed on my mind; and I called
it up and looked it over, half hoping that I should detect something
to justify me to myself, but without success. However, I got the
whole affair pretty well out of my head by bedtime.</p>

<p>"While I was at breakfast the next morning, my scout came in
with a face of the most ludicrous importance, and quite a deferential
manner. I declare I don't think he has ever got back since that
day to his original free-and-easy swagger. He laid a card on my
table, paused a moment, and then said, 'His ludship is houtside
watin', sir.'</p>

<p>"I had had enough of lords' cards; and the scene of yesterday
rose painfully before me as I threw the card into the fire without
looking at it, and said, 'Tell him I am engaged.'</p>

<p>"My scout, with something like a shudder at my audacity, replied,
'His ludship told me to say, sir, as his bis'ness was very particular,
so hif you was engaged he would call again in 'arf an hour.'</p>

<p>"Tell him to come in, then, if he won't take a civil hint.' I
felt sure who it would be, but hardly knew whether to be pleased
or annoyed, when in another minute the door opened, and in walked
the peacemaker. I don't know which of us was the most embarrassed;
he walked straight up to me without lifting his eyes, and held
out his hand saying, 'I hope, Mr. Hardy, you will shake hands
with me now.'</p>

<p>"'Certainly, my lord,' I said, taking his hand; 'I am sorry for
what I said to you yesterday, when my blood was up.'</p>

<p>"'You said no more than we deserved,' he answered twirling his
cap by the long gold tassel; 'I could not be comfortable without
coming to assure you again myself, that neither I, nor, I believe,
half the men in Philippine's rooms yesterday, knew anything of
the bet. I really cannot tell you how annoyed I have been about
it.'</p>

<p>"I assured him that he might make himself quite easy, and then
remained standing, expecting him to go, and not knowing exactly
what to say further. But he begged me to go on with my breakfast,
and sat down, and then asked me to give him a cup of tea, as he
had not breakfasted. So in a few minutes we were sitting opposite
one another over tea and bread and butter, for he didn't ask for,
and I didn't offer, anything else. It was rather a trying meal,
for each of us was doing all he could to make out the other. I
only hope I was as pleasant as he was. After breakfast he went
and I thought the acquaintance was probably at an end; he had
done all that a gentleman need have done, and had well-nigh healed
a raw place in my mental skin.</p>

<p>"But I was mistaken. Without intruding himself on me, he managed
somehow or another to keep on building up the acquaintance little
by little. For some time I looked out very jealously for any patronizing
airs, and even after I was convinced, that he had nothing of the
sort in him, avoided him as much as I could, though he was the
most pleasant and best-informed man I knew. However, we became
intimate, and I saw a good deal of him in a quiet way, at his
own rooms. I wouldn't go to his parties, and asked him not to
come to me here, for my horror of being thought a tuft-hunter
had become almost a disease. He was not so old as I, but he was
just leaving the University, for he had come up early, and lord's
sons are allowed to go out in two years; &mdash;I suppose because
the authorities think they will do less harm here in two than
three years; but it is sometimes hard on poor men, who have to
earn their bread, to see such a privilege given to those who want
it least. When he left, he made me promise to go and pay him a
visit&mdash;which I did in the long vacation, at a splendid place up
in the North, and enjoyed myself more than I care to own. His
father, who is quite worthy of his son, and all his family, were
as kind as people could be.</p>

<p>"Well, amongst other folks I met there a young sprig of nobility
who was coming up here the next term. He had been brought up abroad,
and, I suppose, knew very few men of his own age in England. He
was not a bad style of boy, but rather too demonstrative, and
not strong-headed. He took to me wonderfully, was delighted to
hear that I was up at Oxford, and talked constantly of how much
we should see of one another. As it happened, I was almost the
first man he met when he got off the coach at the 'Angel,' at
the beginning of his first term. He almost embraced me, and nothing
would serve but I must dine with him at the inn, and we spent
the evening together, and parted dear friends. Two days afterwards
we met in the street; he was with two other youngsters, and gave
me a polished and distant bow; in another week he passed me as
if we had never met.</p>

<p>"I don't blame him, poor boy. My only wonder is, that any of
them ever get through this place without being thoroughly spoilt.
From Vice-Chancellor down to scout's boy, the whole of Oxford
seems to be in league to turn their boys heads, even if they come
up with them set on straight, which toadying servants at home
take care shall never happen if they can hinder it. The only men
who would do them good up here, both dons and undergraduates,
keep out of their way, very naturally. Gentlemen-commoners have
a little better chance, though not much, and seem to me to be
worse than the tufts, and to furnish most of their toadies.</p>

<p>"Well, you are tired of my railing? I daresay I am rabid about
it all. Only it does go to my heart to think what this place might
be, and what it is. I see I needn't give you any more of my experience.</p>

<p>"You'll understand now some of the things that have puzzled you
about me. Oh! I know they did; you needn't look apologetic. I
don't wonder, or blame you. I am a very queer bird for the perch
I have lit on; I know that as well as anybody. The only wonder
is that you ever took the trouble to try to lime me. Now have
another glass of toddy. Why! it is near twelve. I must have one
pipe and turn in. No Aristophanes to-night."</p>
