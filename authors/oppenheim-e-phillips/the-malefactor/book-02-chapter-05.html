<P>
"It was here," she said, as they passed through the walled garden seawards,
"that I saw you first--you and the other gentleman who was so kind to me."
<P>
Wingrave nodded.
<P>
"I believe that I remember it," he said; "you were a mournful-looking object
in a very soiled pinafore and most untidy hair."
<P>
"I had been out on the cliffs," she reminded him, "where I am taking you now.
If you are going to make unkind remarks about my hair, I think that I had
better fetch a hat."
<P>
"Pray don't leave me," he answered. "I should certainly lose my way. Your hair
in those days was, I fancy, a little more--unkempt!"
<P>
She laughed.
<P>
"It used to be cut short," she said. "Hideous! There! Isn't that glorious?"
<P>
She had opened the postern gate in the wall, and through the narrow opening
was framed a wonderful picture of the Cornish sea, rolling into the
rock-studded bay. Its soft thunder was in their ears; salt and fragrant, the
west wind swept into their faces. She closed the gate behind her, and stepped
blithely forward.
<P>
"Come!" she cried. "We will climb the cliffs where we left you alone once
before."
<P>
Side by side they stood looking over the ocean. Her head was thrown back, her
lips a little parted. He watched her curiously.
<P>
"You must have sea blood in your veins," he remarked. "You listen as though
you heard music all the time."
<P>
"And what about you?" she asked him, smiling. "You are the grandson of Admiral
Sir Wingrave Seton who commanded a frigate at Trafalgar, and an ancestor of
yours fought in the Armada."
<P>
"I am afraid," he said quietly, "that there is a hiatus in my life somewhere.
There are no voices which call to me any more, and my family records are so
much dead parchment."
<P>
Trouble passed into her glowing face and clouded her eyes.
<P>
"Ah!" she said, "I do not like to hear you talk so. Do you know that when you
do, you make me afraid that something I have always hoped for will never come
to pass?"
<P>
"What is it?" he asked.
<P>
"I have always hoped," she said, "that some day you would come once more to
Tredowen. I suppose I am rather a fanciful person. This is a country of
superstitions and fancies, you know; but sometimes when I have been alone in
the picture gallery with all that long line of dark faces looking down upon me
from the walls, I have felt like an interloper. Always they seem to be
waiting! Tonight, after dinner, I will take you there. I will try and show you
what I mean."
<P>
He shook his head.
<P>
"I shall never come back," he said, "and there are no more of my name."
<P>
She hesitated. When at last she spoke, the color was coming and going in her
cheeks.
<P>
"Sir Wingrave," she said, "I am only an ignorant girl, and I have no right to
talk to you like this. Please be angry with me if you want to. I deserve it. I
know all about--that ten years! Couldn't you forget it, and come back? None of
the country people round here, your own people, believe anything evil about
you. You were struck, and you struck back again. A man would do that. You
could be as lonely as you liked here, or you could have friends if you wished
for them. But this is the place where you ought to live. You would be happier
here, I believe, than in exile. The love of it all would come back, you would
never be lonely. It is the same sea which sang to you when you were a child,
and to your fathers before you. It would bring you forgetfulness when you
wanted it, or--"
<P>
Wingrave interrupted her. His tone was cold, but not unkind.
<P>
"My dear young lady," he said, "it is very good of you to be so sympathetic,
but I am afraid I am not at all the sort of person you imagine me to be. What
I was before those ten years--well, I have forgotten. What I am now, I
unfortunately know. I am a soured, malevolent being whose only pleasure lies
in the dealing out to others some portion of the unhappiness which was dealt
out to me."
<P>
"I do not believe it," she declared briskly.
<P>
He shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"Nevertheless, it is true," he declared coolly. "Listen! More or less you
interest me. I will tell you something which I have never yet told to a single
human being. I need not go into particulars. You will probably believe a broad
statement. My ten years' imprisonment was more or less an injustice!"
<P>
"Sir Wingrave!"
<P>
He checked her. There was not a tremor in his tone. The gesture with which he
had repelled her was stiff and emotionless.
<P>
"I went into prison one man, I came out another. While I live, I shall never
be able to think kindly again of a single one of my fellow creatures. It was
not my fault. So far as our affections are concerned, we are machines, all of
us. Well, my mainspring has broken."
<P>
"I don't believe it," she declared.
<P>
"It is, nevertheless, true," he affirmed calmly. "I am living in exile because
I have no friends, because friends have become an impossibility to me. I shall
not tell you any more of my life because you are young and you would not
believe me if I did. Some day," he added grimly, "you will probably hear for
yourself."
<P>
"I shall never believe anything," she declared, "which I do not choose to
believe. I shall never believe, for instance, that you are quite what you
think yourself."
<P>
"We will talk of other things," he said. "Five years ago, you showed
Aynesworth where the seagulls built."
<P>
"And now I will show you," she exclaimed, "if you are sure that your head is
steady enough. Come along!" . . .
<P>
It was after dinner that she took him into the picture gallery. Miss Harrison,
very much disturbed by the presence of the master of Tredowen, and still more
so by the hint which she had already received as to coming changes, followed
them at a little distance.
<P>
"I am so sorry," Juliet said, "that we have no cigars or cigarettes."
<P>
"I seldom smoke," Wingrave answered.
<P>
"If only we had had the slightest idea of your coming," Miss Harrison said for
the tenth time, "we would have made more adequate preparations. The wine
cellar, at least, could have been opened. I allowed Mr. and Mrs. Tresfarwin to
go for their holiday only yesterday, and the cellars, of course, are never
touched."
<P>
"Your claret was excellent," Wingrave assured her.
<P>
"I am quite sure," Miss Harrison said, "that claret from the local grocer is
not what you are accustomed to--"
<P>
"My dear madam," Wingrave protested, "I seldom touch wine. Show me which
picture it is, Juliet, that you--ah!"
<P>
She had led him to the end of the gallery and stopped before what seemed to be
a plain oak cupboard surrounded by a massive frame. She looked at him half
fearfully.
<P>
"You want to see that picture?" he asked.
<P>
"If I might."
<P>
He drew a bunch of keys from his pocket and calmly selected one. It was a
little rusty, but the cupboard turned at once on its hinges. A woman's face
smiled down upon them, dark and splendid, from the glowing touch of a great
painter. Juliet studied it eagerly, and then stole a sidelong glance at the
man by her side. He was surveying it critically and without any apparent
emotion.
<P>
"Herkomer's, I think," he remarked. "Quite one of his best."
<P>
"It is your mother?" she whispered.
<P>
He nodded.
<P>
"I'm not great at genealogy," he said, "but I can go as far back as that. She
was by way of being a great lady, the daughter of the Duke of Warminster."
<P>
"You were an only son," she said softly. "She must have been very fond of
you."
<P>
"Customary thing, I suppose," he remarked. "Lucky for her, under the
circumstances, that she died young."
<P>
He closed the oaken door in front of the picture, and locked it.
<P>
"I should like to see the armory," he said; "but I really forget--let me see,
it is at the end of the long gallery, isn't it?"
<P>
She led him there without a word. She was getting a little afraid of him. They
inspected the library and wandered back into the picture gallery. It was she,
now, who was silent. She had shown him all her favorite treasures without
being able to evoke a single spark of enthusiasm.
<P>
"Once," she remarked, "we all had a terrible fright. We were told that
everything was going to be sold."
<P>
He nodded.
<P>
"I did think of it," he admitted; "but there seemed to be no hurry. All these
things are growing into money year by year. Some day I shall send everything
to Christie's."
<P>
She looked at him in horror.
<P>
"You cannot--oh, you cannot mean it?" she cried.
<P>
"Why not? They are no use to me."
<P>
"No use?" she faltered.
<P>
"Not a bit. I don't suppose I shall see them again for many years. And the
money--well, one can use that."
<P>
"But I thought--that you were rich?" she faltered.
<P>
"So I am," he answered, "and yet I go on making more and more, and I shall go
on. Money is the whip with which its possessor can scourge humanity. It is
with money that I deal out my--forgive me, I forgot that I was talking aloud,
and to a child," he wound up suddenly.
<P>
She looked at him, dry-eyed, but with a strained look of sorrow strangely
altering her girlish face.
<P>
"You must be very unhappy," she said.
<P>
"Not at all," he assured her. "I am one of those fortunate persons who have
outlived happiness and unhappiness. I have nothing to do but live--and pay off
a few little debts."
<P>
He rose directly afterwards, and she walked with him out to the gardens whence
a short cut led to the village.
<P>
"I have not tried again to make you change your mind," he said as they stood
for a moment on the terrace. "If my wishes have any weight with you, I trust
that you will do nothing without consulting Mr. Pengarth."
<P>
"And you--" she faltered, "are you--never in London? Sha'n't I see you again
any time?"
<P>
"If you care to, by all means," he answered. "Tell Mr. Pengarth to let me have
your address. Goodbye! Thank you for taking care of my treasures so well."
<P>
She held his cold hand in hers and suddenly raised it to her lips. Then she
turned away and hurried indoors.
<P>
Wingrave stood still for a moment and gazed at his hand through the darkness
as though the ghosts of dead things had flitted out from the dark laurel
shrubs. Then he laughed quietly to himself.
