<p>It is useless to dwell upon the grief and consternation of the
occupants of the flatboat when the discovery was made that little
Mabel Ashbridge was missing.</p>

<p>The parents and brother, after the first shock, bore the affliction
with rare courage. By common impulse, they looked to the two persons
best fitted of all to give counsel and hope, Missionary Finley
and Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>Young George Ashbridge was the first to speak after the fearful
lull that followed the cry of the stricken mother. Touching the
arm of Boone, he asked:</p>

<p>"Can we not work the flatboat back to shore, charge upon the
Shawanoes, and recover her before they have time to rally?"</p>

<p>"It might do," replied the pioneer, feelingly, "if we had daylight
to help us, but not while the night lasts. I had a son shot down
by the varmints just as I was entering Kentucky, and they ran
off with a daughter of mine, whom I took back from them, but the
sarcumstances was different from this."</p>

<p>"But we must do something; we cannot go to the block-house and
leave the dear little one behind. I would give my life to save
her."</p>

<p>"So would we all, so would we all," repeated Boone, touched by
the memory of his own sorrows, "but we must not shut our eyes
from seeing things as they are."</p>

<p>The youth groaned in anguish and said no more. The hardest thing
of all was to remain idle while the cherished sister was in her
dreadful peril.</p>

<p>"I'll let myself overboard," said the veteran, "swim back, and
do what I can to help Simon."</p>

<p>"You can give him no help," gently interposed the missionary;
"in truth, Kenton will do better without than with you."</p>

<p>"I'm of that way of thinking myself," said Boone, "though if
Simon was expecting me it would be different."</p>

<p>"But he won't expect you; he saw what none else of us saw&mdash;the
capture of the little one, and will do all that mortal man can
do."</p>

<p>"I don't remember whether I told him the camp of The Panther
and his party is just on t'other side of Rattlesnake Gulch or
not."</p>

<p>"Probably you did tell him, but it matters little if you did
not; he will speedily learn the truth. They are likely to take
the child there, and she will not arrive in camp much sooner than
Kenton will reach the vicinity."</p>

<p>The parents were quick to notice that Boone and the missionary
spoke as if there were little, if any, doubt in their minds that
this course would be followed.</p>

<p>"Suppose," said Mr. Ashbridge, in a tremulous voice, "she is
not spared to be taken into camp?"</p>

<p>"We are all in the hands of our Heavenly Father," reverently
replied the good man, "He doeth all things well, and we must accept
His will with resignation. If the little one has not been spared,
then it is already too late for us to give her aid; if she has
escaped death, then I believe she is in the camp of the Shawanoes."</p>

<p>"And we can steal up and charge upon them," said the brother,
to whom the inaction was becoming intolerable.</p>

<p>"Such a proceeding would insure her instant death," said Mr.
Finley.</p>

<p>"And why? Boone can guide us to the direct spot, so there will
be no mistake about that, and a quick rally and charge will decide
it."</p>

<p>"You forget, George," responded the missionary, in his fatherly
way, "that though The Panther has established his camp on the
other side of the gulch, all his warriors are not there; some
of them are watching us, as best they can, from the shore; by
the time we turned about, and long before we could reach land,
it would be known to The Panther, or the ambuscade he formed hours
ago would be made as effective as though you had all pressed on
without halt."</p>

<p>"Boone said a few minutes ago that if we had daylight instead
of darkness to help us, there would be hope."</p>

<p>"And he is wise, as he always is, for we should have put back
at once; and doing so, immediately on the heels of our flight,
the Shawanoes would not have been given time to prepare a surprise
for us; it is too late now, and the circumstances prevent any
attempt of that nature."</p>

<p>"Then we can do nothing at all&mdash;nothing except to wait until
Kenton makes his report," remarked the father, despairingly.</p>

<p>Instead of replying, the missionary turned to Boone, at his elbow,
and whispered something. The pioneer answered in the same guarded
manner, and the conversation, inaudible to others, continued for
some minutes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile two of the rangers kept toiling at the sweeps, so gently
that it did not interfere with what was said and done by the others,
and the craft slowly approached the Ohio shore.</p>

<p>Starting up, the missionary looked around and inquired:</p>

<p>"What has become of the canoe Jethro and I brought with us?"</p>

<p>"It floated free during the fight," replied one of the rangers,
"and he swam after it. I reckon he has reached the other side
of the river, and is waiting somewhere along the bank."</p>

<p>A general turning of heads and peering in different directions
followed, but nothing was seen of the missing youth. Several wondered
why the reverend gentleman should have made the inquiry, when
the more momentous subject was upon all minds, but he offered
no explanation.</p>

<p>The wind that had brought the flatboat to this point on the river,
and then died out, did not resume its force and direction. It
blew gently, but veered around from the north, so that its tendency
was to drive the craft back to the Kentucky shore. It required
hard work at the sweeps to overcome the momentum, but as the Ohio
side was approached the forest shut off and so lessened the power
of the wind that the boat was forced in close to the bank and
brought to a standstill, where all could leap ashore without difficulty.</p>

<p>And now had the missing child been with them all would have been
as hopeful as could have been desired. Some seven or eight miles
away, and on the same side of the river, stood the strong, rugged
block-house, where the small garrison, under charge of the veteran
Captain Bushwick, could laugh to scorn the assault of a force
ten times as numerous as that under the leadership of The Panther.</p>

<p>A distinctly marked trail wound along the northern branch of
the Ohio, so that it could be readily followed by the fugitives,
even without the escort of the rangers that had been sent out
to their assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. Finley gently suggested that the two families should push
on to the block-house, leaving the others to do what they could
for the help of the child. Mr. Ashbridge, as quietly but firmly,
made answer that neither he, his son nor his wife would move a
step until the fate of his child was determined beyond all doubt.
Mr. Altman, his wife and daughter Agnes felt the same way, and
the good man did not urge his proposal.</p>

<p>"I would probably feel and act the same if I were similarly placed,"
he said, with a touch of sympathy which impressed every one. "You
have the sorrowful consolation of knowing that the suspense won't
last long&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ship ahoy, dar! Show yo' colors!" came in a sepulchral voice
from the shadows along shore. All recognized the tones, and before
any reply could be made Jethro Juggens paddled up against the
prow in his canoe.</p>

<p>"Wasn't suah dat war yo' or de heathen," he added, stepping over
the gunwale and joining his friends, who were all pleased to learn
it had gone so well with him.</p>

<p>Called upon to explain, he promptly did so in characteristic
style:</p>

<p>"While dat little flurry dat didn't 'mount to nuffin' was gwine
on 'long shore, I seed one ob de heathen tryin' to run off wid
de canoe. I wasn't gwine to stand nuffin like dat, and I was b'iling
mad. So I flopped overboard and swam after de boat; de Injin seed
me comin' and tried to dodge, but I cotched him by de heels and
whanged his head agin de canoe; den I got in and paddled ashore
and waited for yo' folks, and hyar I is, and mighty glad to see
yo' all."</p>

<p>No one deemed it worth while to contradict this wild yarn, and
Jethro naturally supposed it was believed.</p>

<p>"Friends," said Mr. Finley, amid the hush that fell upon all,
"Mr. Boone and I, after talking over the matter, have made a change
of plan. I shall cross the river to the other side and see what
I can do, with the help of Heaven, for the little child."</p>

<p>Mr. Ashbridge was impelled to question the wisdom of this step,
for it was hardly to be supposed that a man of peace, whose profession
was the opposite of those around him, was the best person to attempt
the perilous task; but, brief as was the acquaintance of all with
the missionary, he had won their confidence.</p>

<p>Besides, the scheme, whatever it was, had the guarantee of Boone
himself as to its wisdom, and was therefore beyond cavil.</p>

<p>"God go with you!" was the fervent exclamation of the father,
as he took the hand of the good man. "Would that I could help."</p>

<p>"Gladly would I take you if I saw any possible aid you could
afford, but the only aid, friends, that any of you can give me
is your prayers."</p>

<p>"You will have them unceasingly," said Mrs. Ashbridge, clinging
to the hand of the missionary, as if he was her only earthly comforter.</p>

<p>"I dare not tell you to hope for the best," he said, unwilling
to awaken an expectation that was likely to be followed by bitter
disappointment, "but I can only add that whatever may come, try
to say 'God's will be done.' I shall count upon all of you remaining
here until definite news reaches you."</p>

<p>"Have no fear of our going before that," replied Mr. Altman;
"we are distressed as deeply as our friends, and can hardly bear
the suspense."</p>

<p>As the missionary was stepping over the flatboat into the canoe,
George Ashbridge caught his arm, and plead in a low, earnest voice:</p>

<p>"I am sure I can be of some help; please take me. I can't stand
it to remain behind to wait and wait&mdash;not knowing what the tidings
will be."</p>

<p>"My dear boy," replied Mr. Finley, laying his hand upon his shoulder,
"if any one was to go with me it should be you, for none can be
more capable, but be assured that your company would be a hindrance,
as you would admit if you knew my plan."</p>

<p>The sorrowing brother still held his arm, but could not speak.
The missionary gently removed his grasp, and, entering the canoe,
paddled directly out upon the river. The figure of the boat and
occupant quickly passed from view, and those who remained behind,
though they listened intently, could not catch the faintest sound
to betray his progress or change of direction.</p>

<p>Now that the party left in the flatboat had some leisure on their
hands, they devoted it to looking after their own wounds, and
in taking a precaution, which was only ordinary prudence, against
surprise. Two of the rangers entered the wood, one passing a short
distance up and the other down stream. Their duty was to guard
against surprise from the Shawanoes.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that The Panther and his party, after
being once repulsed, would accept that as final. They knew the
fugitives were provided with a strong escort, and were on their
way to the block-house. Even though they could not be wholly cut
off, great damage might be inflicted, and more of the intending
settlers placed beyond the power of invading the hunting grounds
of the red men. That they would make the attempt was to be set
down as one of the certainties of the immediate future.</p>

<p>One of the rangers had been killed during the attack and three
others severely wounded; but when, with the assistance of the
women, their hurts had been bandaged or attended to, they made
light of them, insisting that they were as ready for effective
service as before. Indeed, it was one of the wounded men that
threaded his way up the river bank to help guard against surprise
from their enemies.</p>

<p>Another change of direction was noted in the wind. Beginning
by blowing directly up stream, it had continued to veer until
its course was almost directly opposite, so that, had the flatboat
ventured out in the current with its sail still spread, its progress
down stream would have been more rapid than ever before.</p>

<p>"Marse George," said Jethro, "whar does dis riber flow?"</p>

<p>Wondering at the meaning of the question, the youth replied,
after a moment's hesitation:</p>

<p>"It flows into the Mississippi."</p>

<p>"And what becomes ob dat?"</p>

<p>"It empties into the Gulf of Mexico, which joins the Atlantic
Ocean."</p>

<p>"And dat runs along de oder side ob Wirginny, I hab heard."</p>

<p>"Yes, such is the fact."</p>

<p>"I've an idee; let's put out in de middle ob dis riber, and go
scootin' down de Massipp to de Gulf ob Mexico, and den up de ocean
to Wirginny; dar we'll carry de flatboat ober land till we strike
de Ohio ag'in, and den come down to de block-house from de oder
side. It'll be a round-about way, but we'll got dar, suah."</p>
