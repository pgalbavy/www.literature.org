<P>
THE sight that met Moody's view wrung him to the heart.
<P>
Isabel and the dog were at play together. Among the varied
accomplishments possessed by Tommie, the capacity to take his
part at a game of hide-and-seek was one. His playfellow for the
time being put a shawl or a handkerchief over his head, so as to
prevent him from seeing, and then hid among the furniture a
pocketbook, or a cigar-case, or a purse, or anything else that
happened to be at hand, leaving the dog to find it, with his keen
sense of smell to guide him. Doubly relieved by the fit and the
bleeding, Tommie's spirits had revived; and he and Isabel had
just begun their game when Moody looked into the room, charged
with his terrible errand. "You're burning, Tommie, you're
burning!" cried the girl, laughing and clapping her hands. The
next moment she happened to look round and saw Moody through the
parted curtains. His face warned her instantly that something
serious had happened. She advanced a few steps, her eyes resting
on him in silent alarm. He was himself too painfully agitated to
speak. Not a word was exchanged between Lady Lydiard and Mr. Troy
in the next room. In the complete stillness that prevailed, the
dog was heard sniffing and fidgeting about the furniture. Robert
took Isabel by the hand and led her into the drawing-room. "For
God's sake, spare her, my Lady!" he whispered. The lawyer heard
him. "No," said Mr. Troy. "Be merciful, and tell her the truth!"
<P>
He spoke to a woman who stood in no need of his advice. The
inherent nobility in Lady Lydiard's nature was aroused: her great
heart offered itself patiently to any sorrow, to any sacrifice.
<P>
Putting her arm round Isabel--half caressing her, half supporting
her--Lady Lydiard accepted the whole responsibility and told the
whole truth.
<P>
Reeling under the first shock, the poor girl recovered herself
with admirable courage. She raised her head, and eyed the lawyer
without uttering a word. In its artless consciousness of
innocence the look was nothing less than sublime. Addressing
herself to Mr. Troy, Lady Lydiard pointed to Isabel. "Do you see
guilt there?" she asked.
<P>
Mr. Troy made no answer. In the melancholy experience of humanity
to which his profession condemned him, he had seen conscious
guilt assume the face of innocence, and helpless innocence admit
the disguise of guilt: the keenest observation, in either case,
failing completely to detect the truth. Lady Lydiard
misinterpreted his silence as expressing the sullen
self-assertion of a heartless man. She turned from him, in
contempt, and held out her hand to Isabel.
<P>
"Mr. Troy is not satisfied yet," she said bitterly. "My love,
take my hand, and look me in the face as your equal; I know no
difference of rank at such a time as this. Before God, who hears
you, are you innocent of the theft of the bank-note?"
<P>
"Before God, who hears me," Isabel answered, "I am innocent."
<P>
Lady Lydiard looked once more at the lawyer, and waited to hear
if he believed _that_.
<P>
Mr. Troy took refuge in dumb diplomacy--he made a low bow. It
might have meant that he believed Isabel, or it might have meant
that he modestly withdrew his own opinion into the background.
Lady Lydiard did not condescend to inquire what it meant.
<P>
"The sooner we bring this painful scene to an end the better,"
she said. "I shall be glad to avail myself of your professional
assistance, Mr. Troy, within certain limits. Outside of my house,
I beg that you will spare no trouble in tracing the lost money to
the person who has really stolen it. Inside of my house, I must
positively request that the disappearance of the note may never
be alluded to, in any way whatever, until your inquiries have
been successful in discovering the thief. In the meanwhile, Mrs.
Tollmidge and her family must not be sufferers by my loss: I
shall pay the money again." She paused, and pressed Isabel's hand
with affectionate fervor. "My child," she said, "one last word to
you, and I have done. You remain here, with my trust in you, and
my love for you, absolutely unshaken. When you think of what has
been said here to-day, never forget that."
<P>
Isabel bent her head, and kissed the kind hand that still held
hers. The high spirit that was in her, inspired by Lady Lydiard's
example, rose equal to the dreadful situation in which she was
placed.
<P>
"No, my Lady," she said calmly and sadly; "it cannot be. What
this gentleman has said of me is not to be denied--the
appearances are against me. The letter was open, and I was alone
in the room with it, and Mr. Moody told me that a valuable
inclosure was inside it. Dear and kind mistress! I am not fit to
be a member of your household, I am not worthy to live with the
honest people who serve you, while my innocence is in doubt. It
is enough for me now that _you_ don't doubt it. I can wait
patiently, after that, for the day that gives me back my good
name. Oh, my Lady, don't cry about it! Pray, pray don't cry!"
<P>
Lady Lydiard's self-control failed her for the first time.
Isabel's courage had made Isabel dearer to her than ever. She
sank into a chair, and covered her face with her handkerchief.
Mr. Troy turned aside abruptly, and examined a Japanese vase,
without any idea in his mind of what he was looking at. Lady
Lydiard had gravely misjudged him in believing him to be a
heartless man.
<P>
Isabel followed the lawyer, and touched him gently on the arm to
rouse his attention.
<P>
"I have one relation living, sir--an aunt--who will receive me if
I go to her," she said simply. "Is there any harm in my going?
Lady Lydiard will give you the address when you want me. Spare
her Ladyship, sir, all the pain and trouble that you can."
<P>
At last the heart that was in Mr. Troy asserted itself. "You are
a fine creature!" he said, with a burst of enthusiasm. "I agree
with Lady Lydiard--I believe you are innocent, too; and I will
leave no effort untried to find the proof of it." He turned aside
again, and had another look at the Japanese vase.
<P>
As the lawyer withdrew himself from observation, Moody approached
Isabel.
<P>
Thus far he had stood apart, watching her and listening to her in
silence. Not a look that had crossed her face, not a word that
had fallen from her, had escaped him. Unconsciously on her side,
unconsciously on his side, she now wrought on his nature with a
purifying and ennobling influence which animated it with a new
life. All that had been selfish and violent in his passion for
her left him to return no more. The immeasurable devotion which
he laid at her feet, in the days that were yet to come--the
unyielding courage which cheerfully accepted the sacrifice of
himself when events demanded it at a later period of his
life--struck root in him now. Without attempting to conceal the
tears that were falling fast over his cheeks--striving vainly to
express those new thoughts in him that were beyond the reach of
words--he stood before her the truest friend and servant that
ever woman had.
<P>
"Oh, my dear! my heart is heavy for you. Take me to serve you and
help you. Her Ladyship's kindness will permit it, I am sure."
<P>
He could say no more. In those simple words the cry of his heart
reached her. "Forgive me, Robert," she answered, gratefully, "if
I said anything to pain you when we spoke together a little while
since. I didn't mean it." She gave him her hand, and looked
timidly over her shoulder at Lady Lydiard. "Let me go!" she said,
in low, broken tones, "Let me go!"
<P>
Mr. Troy heard her, and stepped forward to interfere before Lady
Lydiard could speak. The man had recovered his self-control; the
lawyer took his place again on the scene.
<P>
"You must not leave us, my dear," he said to Isabel, "until I
have put a question to Mr. Moody in which you are interested. Do
you happen to have the number of the lost bank-note?" he asked,
turning to the steward.
<P>
Moody produced his slip of paper with the number on it. Mr. Troy
made two copies of it before he returned the paper. One copy he
put in his pocket, the other he handed to Isabel.
<P>
"Keep it carefully," he said. "Neither you nor I know how soon it
may be of use to you."
<P>
Receiving the copy from him, she felt mechanically in her apron
for her pocketbook. She had used it, in playing with the dog, as
an object to hide from him; but she had suffered, and was still
suffering, too keenly to be capable of the effort of remembrance.
Moody, eager to help her even in the most trifling thing, guessed
what had happened. "You were playing with Tommie," he said; "is
it in the next room?"
<P>
The dog heard his name pronounced through the open door. The next
moment he trotted into the drawing-room with Isabel's pocketbook
in his mouth. He was a strong, well-grown Scotch terrier of the
largest size, with bright, intelligent eyes, and a coat of thick
curling white hair, diversified by two light brown patches on his
back. As he reached the middle of the room, and looked from one
to another of the persons present, the fine sympathy of his race
told him that there was trouble among his human friends. His tail
dropped; he whined softly as he approached Isabel, and laid her
pocketbook at her feet.
<P>
She knelt as she picked up the pocketbook, and raised her
playfellow of happier days to take her leave of him. As the dog
put his paws on her shoulders, returning her caress, her first
tears fell. "Foolish of me," she said, faintly, "to cry over a
dog. I can't help it. Good-by, Tommie!"
<P>
Putting him away from her gently, she walked towards the door.
The dog instantly followed. She put him away from her, for the
second time, and left him. He was not to be denied; he followed
her again, and took the skirt of her dress in his teeth, as if to
hold her back. Robert forced the dog, growling and resisting with
all his might, to let go of the dress. "Don't be rough with him,"
said Isabel. "Put him on her ladyship's lap; he will be quieter
there." Robert obeyed. He whispered to Lady Lydiard as she
received the dog; she seemed to be still incapable of
speaking--she bowed her head in silent assent. Robert hurried
back to Isabel before she had passed the door. "Not alone!" he
said entreatingly. "Her Ladyship permits it, Isabel. Let me see
you safe to your aunt's house."
<P>
Isabel looked at him, felt for him, and yielded.
<P>
"Yes," she answered softly; "to make amends for what I said to
you when I was thoughtless and happy!" She waited a little to
compose herself before she spoke her farewell words to Lady
Lydiard. "Good-by, my Lady. Your kindness has not been thrown
away on an ungrateful girl. I love you, and thank you, with all
my heart."
<P>
Lady Lydiard rose, placing the dog on the chair as she left it.
She seemed to have grown older by years, instead of by minutes,
in the short interval that had passed since she had hidden her
face from view. "I can't bear it!" she cried, in husky, broken
tones. "Isabel! Isabel! I forbid you to leave me!"
<P>
But one person could venture to resist her. That person was Mr.
Troy--and Mr. Troy knew it.
<P>
"Control yourself," he said to her in a whisper. "The girl is
doing what is best and most becoming in her position--and is
doing it with a patience and courage wonderful to see. Sh e
places herself under the protection of her nearest relative,
until her character is vindicated and her position in your house
is once more beyond a doubt. Is this a time to throw obstacles in
her way? Be worthy of yourself, Lady Lydiard and think of the day
when she will return to you without the breath of a suspicion to
rest on her!"
<P>
There was no disputing with him--he was too plainly in the right
. Lady Lydiard submitted; she concealed the torture that her own
resolution inflicted on her with an endurance which was, indeed,
worthy of herself. Taking Isabel in her arms she kissed her in a
passion of sorrow and love. "My poor dear! My own sweet girl!
don't suppose that this is a parting kiss! I shall see you
again--often and often I shall see you again at your aunt's!" At
a sign from Mr. Troy, Robert took Isabel's arm in his and led her
away. Tommie, watching her from his chair, lifted his little
white muzzle as his playfellow looked back on passing the
doorway. The long, melancholy, farewell howl of the dog was the
last sound Isabel Miller heard as she left the house.
