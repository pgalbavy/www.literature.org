<p>The little craft was fairly under way, and with favoring wind
and current, ought to reach Zalapata in the course of ten or twelve
hours. Martella, the new recruit, so to speak, seeing there was
nothing just then for him to do, sat down at the bow of the boat
and smoked his cigarette, while Captain Guzman kept company with
Major Starland at the stern.</p>

<p>"Two years ago, when there was war between Atlamalco and Zalapata,"
explained the native officer, "we captured a party of raiders
in the mountains and shot them all excepting one. He was Martella,
who, being wounded, was saved at my prayer. Since then we have
been friends."</p>

<p>"He ought to be your life friend if there is any such thing as
gratitude in his nature."</p>

<p>"I have been to see him and he comes to see me. Martella is one
who speaks the truth."</p>

<p>"I was not aware that&mdash;barring yourself&mdash;there was any man in
this part of the world who had that virtue."</p>

<p>"What did President Yozarro tell you?" asked the Captain so bluntly
that the American resented it.</p>

<p>"You have no warrant for asking that question."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Major; I do not ask to know what he said about the
claim of President Bambos, for I already know that."</p>

<p>"You do! Well, what was it?"</p>

<p>"He said he would pay the amount of the claim and asked you to
tell President Bambos he is very sorry."</p>

<p>"You are right; that is what he said."</p>

<p>"But he did not pay you the money; and, begging pardon again,
Major, you intended to pay it yourself to President Bambos, as
if it came from General Yozarro."</p>

<p>"You would be called a mind reader, Captain, in my country, for
you are right in everything you say. It will spoil his game, however,
if General Bambos is as keen as you."</p>

<p>"If he is, he will not let you discover it; he is determined
to go to war against General Yozarro, and no matter what you do,
you cannot prevent it, unless&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?"</p>

<p>"You take away the cause of his making war."</p>

<p>"The cause! You speak in riddles."</p>

<p>Instead of directly replying, the Captain asked the startling
question:</p>

<p>"You inquired of General Yozarro about the Señorita, your sister:
what answer did he make to you?"</p>

<p>"You have not forgotten the tugboat we saw pass down the river
last night; I heard it returning to Atlamalco."</p>

<p>"So also did I."</p>

<p>"On its first voyage, it carried my sister as one of the passengers,
she not knowing I had left Zalapata, and she is there awaiting
my coming."</p>

<p>Captain Guzman, sitting at the elbow of the American, gazed off
toward the wooded plain as if in reverie. His words did not seem
to be addressed to any one, but were as if he communed with himself:</p>

<p>"Five hours after the gunboat went up the river, it passed where
we were resting on its way back to Atlamalco. The distance from
where we were to Zalapata is eighty miles and to make the trip
the boat would need eight or ten hours."</p>

<p>"What the mischief are you driving at? General Yozarro told me
he took the lady thither."</p>

<p>Captain Guzman withdrew his gaze from the shore, and looking
calmly in the face of Major Starland, said:</p>

<p>"General Yozarro lied."</p>

<p>"How can you know that?"</p>

<p>"Do you not see that the gunboat could not do what he said it
did? But Martella here was on the boat and knows all."</p>

<p>"Call him, that I may question him."</p>

<p>"No need of that; I have questioned him; I know that your real
business with General Yozarro was to meet the Señorita, your sister,
and I know all that Martella knows."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"Señoritas Starland and Estacardo were passengers on the boat,
but ten miles down the river they went ashore, and, under the
escort of two soldiers, set out for the summer home of General
Yozarro."</p>

<p>"Where is that?"</p>

<p>"A mile from the river among the mountains; the air there is
cooler than at Atlamalco, and General Yozarro spends much of the
hot season at <em>Castillo Descanso</em>, or 'Castle of Rest.'
Señorita Estacardo is his niece; he is a widower; he loves your
sister and he hopes by his kindness and attention to win her for
his wife, and to do this, he sees he must keep you and her apart
as long as he can."</p>

<p>"The infernal scoundrel! She shall die before wedding him!"</p>

<p>"He knows how you feel: that is why he strives to keep you apart."</p>

<p>"He'll have a good time in doing it! Do you know the path that
leads to the summer quarters of this precious dog?"</p>

<p>"Well enough to guide you thither, but Martella knows it better
than I."</p>

<p>"Can he be hired to guide us thither?"</p>

<p>"No, for he will do so without pay."</p>

<p>"I shall join General Bambos in his war against Yozarro, and
we'll make him pay dear for his deviltry."</p>

<p>"Do you prefer the friendship of General Bambos to that of General
Yozarro?"</p>

<p>"I don't care a picayune for either, but I will use one against
the other."</p>

<p>"You forget that there is no choice between the good will of
the two. When you came up the forked river you first called at
Zalapata."</p>

<p>"What of it?"</p>

<p>"General Bambos was a guest on your yacht."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He met Señorita Starland; he has a wife and several children,
but he loves the Señorita as much as does General Yozarro."</p>

<p>"What a couple of wretches! Do you tell me that <em>that</em>
is why he means to go to war with General Yozarro?"</p>

<p>"That is his reason; I could not tell you before; his claim for
damages is a pretext; he hopes to defeat General Yozarro and to
compel him to give up the Señorita. Neither he nor General Yozarro
cares for you, whom they regard as an obstacle; they will be glad
to put you out of the way."</p>
