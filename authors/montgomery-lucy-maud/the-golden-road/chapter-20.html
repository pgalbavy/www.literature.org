As will be seen there is no Honour Roll in this number.  Even
Felicity has thought all the beautiful thoughts that can be
thought and cannot think any more.  Peter has never got drunk but,
under existing circumstances, that is not greatly to his credit. 
As for our written resolutions they have silently disappeared from
our chamber walls and the place that once knew them knows them no
more for ever.  (PETER, PERPLEXEDLY:  "Seems to me I've heard
something like that before.") It is very sad but we will all make
some new resolutions next year and maybe it will be easier to keep
those.

THE STORY OF THE LOCKET THAT WAS BAKED
<P>
This was a story my Aunt Jane told me about her granma when she
was a little girl.  Its funny to think of baking a locket, but it
wasn't to eat.  She was my great granma but Ill call her granma
for short.  It happened when she was ten years old.  Of course she
wasent anybodys granma then.  Her father and mother and her were
living in a new settlement called Brinsley.  Their nearest naybor
was a mile away.  One day her Aunt Hannah from Charlottetown came
and wanted her ma to go visiting with her.  At first granma's ma
thought she couldent go because it was baking day and granma's pa
was away.  But granma wasent afraid to stay alone and she knew how
to bake the bread so she made her ma go and her Aunt Hannah took
off the handsome gold locket and chain she was waring round her
neck and hung it on granmas and told her she could ware it all
day.  Granma was awful pleased for she had never had any jewelry. 
She did all the chores and then was needing the loaves when she
looked up and saw a tramp coming in and he was an awful villenus
looking tramp.  He dident even pass the time of day but just set
down on a chair.  Poor granma was awful fritened and she turned
her back on him and went on needing the loaf cold and trembling--
that is, granma was trembling not the loaf.  She was worried about
the locket.  She didn't know how she could hide it for to get
anywhere she would have to turn round and pass him.
<P>
All of a suddent she thought she would hide it in the bread.  She
put her hand up and pulled it hard and quick and broke the
fastening and needed it right into the loaf.  Then she put the
loaf in the pan and set it in the oven.
<P>
The tramp hadent seen her do it and then he asked for something to
eat.  Granma got him up a meal and when hed et it he began
prowling about the kitchen looking into everything and opening the
cubbord doors.  Then he went into granma's mas room and turned the
buro drawers and trunk inside out and threw the things in them all
about.  All he found was a purse with a dollar in it and he swore
about it and took it and went away.  When granma was sure he was
really gone she broke down and cried.  She forgot all about the
bread and it burned as black as coal.  When she smelled it burning
granma run and pulled it out.  She was awful scared the locket was
spoiled but she sawed open the loaf and it was there safe and
sound.  When her Aunt Hannah came back she said granma deserved
the locket because she had saved it so clever and she gave it to
her and grandma always wore it and was very proud of it.  And
granma used to say that was the only loaf of bread she ever
spoiled in her life.

(FELICITY:  "Those stories are all very well but they are only true
stories.  It's easy enough to write true stories.  I thought Peter
was appointed fiction editor, but he has never written any fiction
since the paper started.  That's not MY idea of a fiction editor. 
He ought to make up stories out of his own head."  PETER,
SPUNKILY:  "I can do it, too, and I will next time.  And it ain't
easier to write true stories.  It's harder, 'cause you have to
stick to facts."  FELICITY:  "I don't believe you could make up a
story."  PETER:  "I'll show you!")

MY MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE
<P>
It's my turn to write it but I'm SO NERVOUS.  My worst adventure
happened TWO YEARS AGO.  It was an awful one.  I had a striped
ribbon, striped brown and yellow and I LOST IT.  I was very sorry
for it was a handsome ribbon and all the girls in school were
jealous of it.  (FELICITY:  "I wasn't.  I didn't think it one bit
pretty."  CECILY:  "Hush!") I hunted everywhere but I couldn't find
it.  Next day was Sunday and I was running into the house by the
front door and I saw SOMETHING LYING ON THE STEP and I thought it
was my ribbon and I made a grab at it as I passed.  But, oh, it
was A SNAKE!  Oh, I can never describe how I felt when I felt that
awful thing WRIGGLING IN MY HAND.  I let it go and SCREAMED AND
SCREAMED, and ma was cross at me for yelling on Sunday and made me
read seven chapters in the Bible but I didn't mind that much after
what I had come through.  I would rather DIE than have SUCH AN
EXPERIENCE again.

(DAN:  "Great snakes, who got that up?  I'll bet it was Peter." 
FELICITY, WITH DIGNITY:  "Well, it's more than YOU could do.  YOU
couldn't write poetry to save your life."  PETER, ASIDE TO
BEVERLEY:  "She seems quite pleased.  I'm glad I wrote it, but it
was awful hard work.")

FELICITY, WHO WROTE IT:  "I think it is just as appropriate to a
wedding as to a funeral!")

Roger IS smart.  It was so easy to fool you.")

Flossie tells me.  He says he means to keep it always for a
remembrance though he has given up hope."  DAN:  "I'll steal it out
of his Bible in Sunday School."  CECILY, BLUSHING:  "Oh, let him
keep it if it is any comfort to him.  Besides, it isn't right to
steal."  DAN:  "He stole it."  CECILY:  "But Mr. Marwood says two
wrongs never make a right.")

ANXIOUS INQUIRER:--It is not advisable to curl your hair with
mucilage if you can get anything else.  Quince juice is better.

biscuits?")

No, F-l-x, a little caterpillar is not called a kittenpillar. 
(FELIX, ENRAGED:  "I never asked that!  Dan just makes that
etiquette column up from beginning to end!"  FELICITY:  "I don't
see what that kind of a question has to do with etiquette
anyhow.")
<P>
Yes, P-t-r, it is quite proper to treat a lady friend to ice cream
twice if you can afford it.
<P>
No, F-l-c-t-y, it is not ladylike to chew tobacco.  Better stick
to spruce gum.

FASHION NOTES
<P>
Frilled muslin aprons will be much worn this summer.  It is no
longer fashionable to trim them with knitted lace.  One pocket is
considered smart.
<P>
Clam-shells are fashionable keepsakes.  You write your name and
the date inside one and your friend writes hers in the other and
you exchange.

FUNNY PARAGRAPHS
<P>
MR. PERKINS:--"Peter, name the large islands of the world."
<P>
PETER:--"The Island, the British Isles and Australia." (PETER,
DEFIANTLY:  "Well, Mr. Perkins said he guessed I was right, so you
needn't laugh.")
<P>
This is a true joke and really happened.  It's about Mr. Samuel
Clask again.  He was once leading a prayer meeting and he looked
through the window and saw the constable driving up and guessed he
was after him because he was always in debt.  So in a great hurry
he called on Brother Casey to lead in prayer and while Brother
Casey was praying with his eyes shut and everybody else had their
heads bowed Mr. Clask got out of the window and got away before
the constable got in because he didn't like to come in till the
prayer was finished.
<P>
Uncle Roger says it was a smart trick on Mr. Clask's part, but I
don't think there was much religion about it.
<P>
                                        FELIX KING.
