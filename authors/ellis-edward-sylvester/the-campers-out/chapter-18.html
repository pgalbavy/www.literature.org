<p>It would be supposed that common gratitude would have filled
the heart of Jim McGovern after his rescue from death by the very
lad whom he had sought to injure, but when he returned to the
tent, changed his draggled garments, helped himself to strong
spirits and began puffing a cigarette, he was angered at seeing
the smile on the face of his companion.</p>

<p>"What’s the matter with you?" he growled.</p>

<p>"Nothing, only I think you and I ought to learn how to swim."</p>

<p>"I don’t see any need of it," replied Jim, who was in a savage
humor.</p>

<p>"Then you won’t have to yell for Dick Halliard to help you out
when you tumble into the mill-pond."</p>

<p>"He didn’t help me out; what are you talking about?" "He said
so, and you didn’t deny it."</p>

<p>"It was <em>me</em> that helped <em>him</em> out," was the unblushing
response of young McGovern, growing angrier every minute; "and
I’m going to get even with him."</p>

<p>"Get even for what? For helping him out?"</p>

<p>"For lying about me; I don’t allow any chap to do that."</p>

<p>"How are you going to do it, Jim?" asked Tom, glad of a chance
to tantalize his companion.</p>

<p>"Why, how do you suppose? I’ll lay for him."</p>

<p>"Ah, that reminds me!" said his companion; "I forgot it until
this minute."</p>

<p>"What’s that?"</p>

<p>"Why, when Bob started out this evening, he said he was going
to do that very thing—lay for young Halliard."</p>

<p>"What’s <em>he</em> got against him?" demanded Jim, resenting
the idea that any one should rob him of his anticipated pleasure.</p>

<p>"You heard what he said last night; Halliard holds himself so
much better than he that he feels it his duty to bring him down
a peg or two; he told me that while you and I took a stroll wherever
we chose, he would go down to Piketon to get some things at the
store and before he came back would fix Halliard."</p>

<p>"I wonder if he did it before Halliard pulled me out of the pond—I
mean before I pulled him out."</p>

<p>"If he did, it couldn’t have amounted to much, for he didn’t
act like a chap suffering harm. No, it must be that Bob has missed
him; but he’s likely to catch him on the way back. It’s so late
that Bob must be coming home, and he’ll be sure to meet the young
gentleman and will give him a laying-out that he will remember
for years."</p>

<p>Jim smoked a few minutes in silence. It is a principle of human
nature that if we do another a kindness we are apt to feel more
friendly disposed toward him than before, while the one receiving
the favor is inclined to resent it. His gratitude may overmaster
this mean emotion, but there is something in the thought of being
under obligations to another which is unpleasant, and results
in stirring up emotions that are no credit to us.</p>

<p>Jim McGovern could not forget that he was trying to injure an
innocent person when that person saved him from drowning. Had
he not been thus engaged, probably he might not have felt so ugly
toward him. But his situation was so humiliating, considered in
all aspects, that he looked upon Dick Halliard with more dislike
than upon his bitterest enemy.</p>

<p>"Tom," said he, rising to his feet and flinging away the remnant
of a cigarette, "I aint going to stand it."</p>

<p>"You are standing it this minute after sitting all the evening."</p>

<p>"Stop trying to be funny; I’m going after that Halliard."</p>

<p>"When—to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No, to-night; right away."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, it is very late; wait until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I can’t do it; I’m mad clear through; I’m off!"</p>

<p>He started toward the opening, but Tom sprang up and caught his
arm.</p>

<p>"If you are bent on going take your weapons with you. There’s
no telling how badly you’ll need ’em."</p>

<p>"No; I don’t intend to shoot anybody, but I mean to give that
fellow the biggest whipping of his life."</p>

<p>"How are you going to manage it?"</p>

<p>"I can’t stop to explain. I’ll tell you when I come back;" and,
without saying anything more, the wrathful Ranger strode toward
the mill-pond, where he took the main path leading to the highway.
As he saw the gleam of the water he shuddered to recall how near
he came to death; but his evil nature had no room at that time
for the sweet, tender emotions that should have filled him.</p>

<p>At the moment of leaving camp he had fixed upon no clear method
of procedure, and he gave his meditations now to the best plan
for punishing his preserver.</p>

<p>"It’s easy enough," he added, after walking a short way; "I’ll
go to the door and knock, and if it isn’t young Halliard that
opens it, I’ll ask for him, saying I must see him on something
important. Then, when I get him outside, I’ll jump on him. I can
do him up before anybody comes to his help. If he’s the first
one to show himself, it’ll be all the better."</p>

<p>Bob had pointed out the modest little home of Dick Halliard that
day, while the three Piketon Rangers were returning from their
call at their leader’s house. Consequently McGovern had no trouble
in finding the place. He was surprised to observe the twinkle
of a light from an upper window, which he accepted as proof that
Dick was in the act of retiring.</p>

<p>I wonder whether, if he had known it was the light burning in
the sick chamber of his preserver’s parent, it would have restrained
him from pushing on with his scheme of revenge. I fear not.</p>

<p>Standing in front of the gate the Ranger spent several minutes
in making what might be called a reconnoissance.</p>

<p>So far as he could discover everything was silent and no one
was astir. It was the only house in sight, and the lamp, showing
through the curtain, was the solitary sign of wakefulness in Dick
Halliard’s home. No shadows passed in front of the light, and
he wondered why it was that all was so strangely quiet.</p>

<p>But the impressiveness of the hour did not deter the evil youth
from carrying out his purpose. He softly opened the gate and moved
as stealthily as a burglar along the short path leading to the
front door.</p>

<p>Here he paused a few seconds to make sure his plan would work
perfectly.</p>

<p>"When he shows himself, I’ll step back and ask him to come outside,
as I don’t want any one to hear me. I’ll get him to shut the door
and leave the porch; then when I’ve got him where I want him,
I’ll let him have a half-dozen right and left-handers, and run
as hard I can down the road. Nobody round here knows me and he
won’t get a good look at my face. If he does and makes a kick
over it, I’ll prove an alibi."</p>

<p>Nothing seemed amiss, and the expectant McGovern reached up his
hand to sound the old-fashioned knocker.</p>

<p>"More than likely it will be young Halliard himself that will
come to the door—gracious! I never thought of that!"</p>

<p>At that moment Bowser, the big bull-dog belonging to Dick Halliard,
having heard a slight noise in front, came trotting around the
corner of the house to see whether there were any tramps for him
to devour.</p>

<p>Had Jim kept his place he would not have been molested, for Bowser
was too well trained to harm any one calling in the right way,
and whose appearance was not against him. But the instant the
youth caught sight of the ferocious canine, he did the very worst
thing possible—he started to run.</p>

<p>Bowser accepted this as proof that he was there on wrong business,
and he dashed after him like a runaway engine. Before Jim could
open and pass through the gate, the dog was nipping at the calves
of his legs with a vigor that compelled the terrified youth to
yell at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>Dick Halliard heard the shout, and, springing from his bed, threw
up the window and called to the animal to forbear. Bowser disliked
to obey, for he was just getting fairly at work; but he came trotting
back with his head down and a reproachful glance at his young
master, for having interfered at such an unlucky time for him.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as it is impossible to do justice to Jim McGovern’s
feelings, while making his way back to the tent in the woods,
we will not attempt to do so. Silence is the more eloquent under
such circumstances.</p>
