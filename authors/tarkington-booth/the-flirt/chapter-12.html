<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Within a week Mr. Madison's illness was a settled institution
in the household; the presence of the nurse lost novelty, even
to Hedrick, and became a part of life; the day was measured by
the three regular visits of the doctor. To the younger members
of the family it seemed already that their father had always been
sick, and that he always would be; indeed, to Cora and Hedrick
he had become only a weak and querulous voice beyond a closed
door. Doctor Sloane was serious but reassuring, his daily announcement
being that his patient was in "no immediate danger."</p>

<p>Mrs. Madison did not share her children's sanguine adaptability;
and, of the three, Cora was the greatest solace to the mother's
troubled heart, though Mrs. Madison never recognized this without
a sense of injustice to Laura, for Laura now was housewife and
housekeeper&mdash;that is, she did all the work except the cooking,
and on "wash-day" she did that. But Cora's help was to the very
spirit itself, for she was sprightly in these hours of trial:
with indomitable gayety she cheered her mother, inspiring in her
a firmer confidence, and, most stimulating of all, Cora steadfastly
refused to consider her father's condition as serious, or its
outcome as doubtful.</p>

<p>Old Sloane exaggerated, she said; and she made fun of his gravity,
his clothes and his walk, which she mimicked till she drew a reluctant
and protesting laugh from even her mother. Mrs. Madison was sure
she "couldn't get through" this experience save for Cora, who
was indeed the light of the threatened house.</p>

<p>Strange perversities of this world: Cora's gayety was almost
unbearable to her brother. Not because he thought it either unfeeling
or out of place under the circumstances (an aspect he failed to
consider), but because years of warfare had so frequently made
him connect cheerfulness on her part with some unworthily won
triumph over himself that habit prevailed, and he could not be
a witness of her high spirits without a strong sense of injury.
Additionally, he was subject to a deeply implanted suspicion of
any appearance of unusual happiness in her as having source, if
not in his own defeat, then in something vaguely "soft" and wholly
distasteful. She grated upon him; he chafed, and his sufferings
reached the surface. Finally, in a reckless moment, one evening
at dinner, he broke out with a shout and hurled a newly devised
couplet concerning luv-a-ly slush at his, sister's head. The nurse
was present: Cora left the table; and Hedrick later received a
serious warning from Laura. She suggested that it might become
expedient to place him in Cora's power.</p>

<p>"Cora knows perfectly well that something peculiar happened to
you," she advised him. "And she knows that I know what it was;
and she says it isn't very sisterly of me not to tell her. Now,
Hedrick, there was no secret about it; you didn't <em>confide</em>
your&mdash;your trouble to me, and it would be perfectly honourable
of me to tell it. I wont{sic} unless you make me, but if you can't
be polite and keep peace with Cora&mdash;at least while papa is sick
I think it may be necessary. I believe," she finished with imperfect
gravity, "that it&mdash;it would keep things quieter."</p>

<p>The thoughts of a boy may be long, long thoughts, but he cannot
persistently remember to fear a threatened catastrophe. Youth
is too quickly intimate with peril. Hedrick had become familiar
with his own, had grown so accustomed to it he was in danger of
forgetting it altogether; therefore it was out of perspective.
The episode of Lolita had begun to appear as a thing of the distant
and clouded past: time is so long at thirteen. Added to this,
his late immaculate deportment had been, as Laura suggested, a
severe strain; the machinery of his nature was out of adjustment
and demanded a violent reaction before it could get to running
again at average speed. Also, it is evident that his destruction
had been planned on high, for he was mad enough to answer flippantly:</p>

<p>"Tell her! Go on and tell her&mdash;<em>I</em> give you leaf! <em>that</em>
wasn't anything anyway&mdash;just helped you get a little idiot girl
home. What is there to that? I never saw her before; never saw
her again; didn't have half as much to do with her as you did
yourself. She was a lot more <em>your</em> friend than mine; I
didn't even know her. I guess you'll have to get something better
on me than that, before you try to boss <em>this</em> ranch, Laura
Madison!"</p>

<p>That night, in bed, he wondered if he had not been perhaps a
trifle rash; but the day was bright when he awoke, and no apprehension
shadowed his morning face as he appeared at the breakfast table.
On the contrary, a great weight had lifted from him; clearly his
defiance had been the proper thing; he had shown Laura that her
power over him was but imaginary. Hypnotized by his own words
to her, he believed them; and his previous terrors became gossamer;
nay, they were now merely laughable. His own remorse and shame
were wholly blotted from memory, and he could not understand why
in the world he had been so afraid, nor why he had felt it so
necessary to placate Laura. She looked very meek this morning.
<em>That</em> showed! The strong hand was the right policy in
dealing with women. He was tempted to insane daring: the rash,
unfortunate child waltzed on the lip of the crater.</p>

<p>"Told Cora yet?" he asked, with scornful laughter.</p>

<p>"Told me what?" Cora looked quickly up from her plate.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing about this Corliss," he returned scathingly. "Don't
get excited."</p>

<p>"Hedrick!" remonstrated his mother, out of habit.</p>

<p>"She never thinks of anything else these days," he retorted.
"Rides with him every evening in his pe-rin-sley hired machine,
doesn't she?"</p>

<p>"Really, you should be more careful about the way you handle
a spoon, Hedrick," said Cora languidly, and with at least a foundation
of fact. "It is not the proper implement for decorating the cheeks.
We all need nourishment, but it is <em>so</em> difficult when
one sees a deposit of breakfast-food in the ear of one's vis-a-vis."</p>

<p>Hedrick too impulsively felt of his ears and was but the worse
stung to find them immaculate and the latter half of the indictment
unjustified.</p>

<p>"Spoon!" he cried. "I wouldn't talk about spoons if I were you,
Cora-lee! After what I saw in the library the other night, believe
<em>me</em>, you're the one of this family that better be careful
how you `handle a spoon'!"</p>

<p>Cora had a moment of panic. She let the cup she was lifting drop
noisily upon its saucer, and gazed whitely at the boy, her mouth
opening wide.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he went on, with a dreadful laugh. "I didn't hear you
asking this Corliss to kiss you! Oh, no!"</p>

<p>At this, though her mother and Laura both started, a faint, odd
relief showed itself in Cora's expression. She recovered herself.</p>

<p>"You little liar!" she flashed, and, with a single quick look
at her mother, as of one too proud to appeal, left the room.</p>

<p>"Hedrick, Hedrick, Hedrick!" wailed Mrs. Madison. "And she told
me you drove her from the table last night too, right before Miss
Peirce!" Miss Peirce was the nurse, fortunately at this moment
in the sick-room.</p>

<p>"I <em>did</em> hear her ask him that," he insisted, sullenly.
"Don't you believe it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!"</p>

<p>Burning with outrage, he also left his meal unfinished and departed
in high dignity. He passed through the kitchen, however, on his
way out of the house; but, finding an unusual politeness to the
cook nothing except its own reward, went on his way with a bitter
perception of the emptiness of the world and other places.</p>

<p>"Your father managed to talk more last night," said Mrs. Madison
pathetically to Laura. "He made me understand that he was fretting
about how little we'd been able to give our children; so few advantages;
it's always troubled him terribly. But sometimes I wonder if we've
done right: we've neither of us ever exercised any discipline.
We just couldn't bear to. You see, not having any money, or the
things money could buy, to give, I think we've instinctively tried
to make up for it by indulgence in other ways, and perhaps it's
been a bad thing. Not," she added hastily, "not that you aren't
all three the best children any mother and father ever had! <em>He</em>
said so. He said the only trouble was that our children were too
good for us." She shook her head remorsefully throughout Laura's
natural reply to this; was silent a while; then, as she rose,
she said timidly, not looking at her daughter: "Of course Hedrick
didn't mean to tell an outright lie. They were just talking, and
perhaps he&mdash;perhaps he heard something that made him think what
he <em>did</em>. People are so often mistaken in what they hear,
even when they're talking right to each other, and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Isn't it more likely," said Laura, gravely, "that Cora was telling
some story or incident, and that Hedrick overheard that part of
it, and thought she was speaking directly to Mr. Corliss?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" cried the mother with instant and buoyant relief;
and when the three ladies convened, a little later, Cora (unquestioned)
not only confirmed this explanation, but repeated in detail the
story she had related to Mr. Corliss. Laura had been quick.</p>

<p>Hedrick passed a variegated morning among comrades. He obtained
prestige as having a father like-to-die, but another boy turned
up who had learned to chew tobacco. Then Hedrick was pronounced
inferior to others in turning "cartwheels," but succeeded in a
wrestling match for an apple, which he needed. Later, he was chased
empty-handed from the rear of an ice-wagon, but greatly admired
for his retorts to the vociferous chaser: the other boys rightly
considered that what he said to the ice-man was much more horrible
than what the ice-man said to him. The ice-man had a fair vocabulary,
but it lacked pliancy; seemed stiff and fastidious compared with
the flexible Saxon in which Hedrick sketched a family tree lacking,
perhaps, some plausibility as having produced even an ice-man,
but curiously interesting zoologically.</p>

<p>He came home at noon with the flush of this victory new upon
his brow. He felt equal to anything, and upon Cora's appearing
at lunch with a blithe, bright air and a new arrangement of her
hair, he opened a fresh campaign with ill-omened bravado.</p>

<p>"Ear-muffs in style for September, are they?" he inquired in
allusion to a symmetrical and becoming undulation upon each side
of her head. "Too bad Ray Vilas can't come any more; he'd like
those, I know he would."</p>

<p>Cora, who was talking jauntily to her mother, went on without
heeding. She affected her enunciation at times with a slight lisp;
spoke preciously and over-exquisitely, purposely mincing the letter
R, at the same time assuming a manner of artificial distinction
and conscious elegance which never failed to produce in her brother
the last stage of exasperation. She did this now. Charming woman,
that dear Mrs. Villard, she prattled. "I met her downtown this
morning. Dear mamma, you should but have seen her delight when
she saw <em>me</em>. She was but just returned from Bar Harbor&#11834;"</p>

<p>"`Baw-hawbaw'!" Poor Hedrick was successfully infuriated immediately.
"What in thunder is `Baw-hawbaw'? Mrs. Villawd! Baw-hawbaw! Oh,
maw!"</p>

<p>"She had no idea she should find <em>me</em> in town, she said,"
Cora ran on, happily. "She came back early on account of the children
having to be sent to school. She has such adorable children&mdash;beautiful,
dimpled babes&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>SLUSH! SLUSH! LUV-A-LY SLUSH</em>!"</p>

<p>" &mdash;And her dear son, Egerton Villard, he's grown to be
such a comely lad, and he has the most charming courtly manners:
he helped his mother out of her carriage with all the air of a
man of the world, and bowed to me as to a duchess. I think he
might be a great influence for good if the dear Villards would
but sometimes let him associate a little with our unfortunate
Hedrick. Egerton Villard is really <em>distingue</em>; he has
a beautiful head; and if he could be induced but to let Hedrick
follow him about but a little&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'll beat his beautiful head off for him if he but butts in
on me but a little!" Hedrick promised earnestly. "Idiot!"</p>

<p>Cora turned toward him innocently. "What did you say, Hedrick?"</p>

<p>"I said `Idiot'!"</p>

<p>"You mean Egerton Villard?"</p>

<p>"Both of you!"</p>

<p>"You think I'm an idiot, Hedrick?" Her tone was calm, merely
inquisitive.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said pleasantly. "Don't you think if I were <em>really</em>
an idiot I'd be even fonder of you than I am?"</p>

<p>It took his breath. In a panic he sat waiting he knew not what;
but Cora blandly resumed her interrupted remarks to her mother,
beginning a description of Mrs. Villard's dress; Laura was talking
unconcernedly to Miss Peirce; no one appeared to be aware that
anything unusual had been said. His breath came back, and, summoning
his presence of mind, he found himself able to consider his position
with some degree of assurance. Perhaps, after all, Cora's retort
had been merely a coincidence. He went over and over it in his
mind, making a pretence, meanwhile, to be busy with his plate.
"If I were <em>really</em> an idiot." . . . It was the "<em>really</em>"
that troubled him. But for that one word, he could have decided
that her remark was a coincidence; but "<em>really</em>" was ominous;
had a sinister ring. "If I were <em>really</em> an idiot!" Suddenly
the pleasant clouds that had obscured his memory of the fatal
evening were swept away as by a monstrous Hand: it all came back
to him with sickening clearness. So is it always with the sinner
with his sin and its threatened discovery. Again, in his miserable
mind, he sat beside Lolita on the fence, with the moon shining
through her hair; and he knew&mdash;for he had often read it&mdash;that
a man could be punished his whole life through for a single moment's
weakness. A man might become rich, great, honoured, and have a
large family, but his one soft sin would follow him, hunt him
out and pull him down at last. "<em>Really</em> an idiot!" Did
that relentless Comanche, Cora, know this Thing? He shuddered.
Then he fell back upon his faith in Providence. It <em>could</em>
not be that she knew! Ah, no! Heaven would not let the world be
so bad as that! And yet it did sometimes become negligent&mdash;he
remembered the case of a baby-girl cousin who fell into the bath-tub
and was drowned. Providence had allowed that: What assurance had
he that it would not go a step farther?</p>

<p>"Why, Hedrick," said Cora, turning toward him cheerfully, "you're
not really eating anything; you're only pretending to." His heart
sank with apprehension. Was it coming? "You really must eat,"
she went on. "School begins so soon, you must be strong, you know.
How we shall miss you here at home during your hours of work!"</p>

<p>With that, the burden fell from his shoulders, his increasing
terrors took wing. If Laura had told his ghastly secret to Cora,
the latter would not have had recourse to such weak satire as
this. Cora was not the kind of person to try a popgun on an enemy
when she had a thirteen-inch gun at her disposal; so he reasoned;
and in the gush of his relief and happiness, responded:</p>

<p>"You're a little too cocky lately, Cora-lee: I wish you were
<em>my</em> daughter&mdash;just about five minutes!"</p>

<p>Cora looked upon him fondly. "What would you do to me," she inquired
with a terrible sweetness&mdash;"darling little boy?"</p>

<p>Hedrick's head swam. The blow was square in the face; it jarred
every bone; the world seemed to topple. His mother, rising from
her chair, choked slightly, and hurried to join the nurse, who
was already on her way upstairs. Cora sent an affectionate laugh
across the table to her stunned antagonist.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't beat me, would you, dear?" she murmured. "I'm almost
sure you wouldn't; not if I asked you to kiss me some <em>more</em>."</p>

<p>All doubt was gone, the last hope fled! The worst had arrived.
A vision of the awful future flamed across his staggered mind.
The doors to the arena were flung open: the wild beasts howled
for hunger of him; the spectators waited.</p>

<p>Cora began lightly to sing:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
. . . "Dear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would thou wert near<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear me tell how fair thou art!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since thou art gone I mourn all alone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my Lolita&#11834;"

</p>
</div>
<p>She broke off to explain: "It's one of those passionate little
Spanish serenades, Hedrick. I'll sing it for your boy-friends
next time they come to play in the yard. I think they'd like it.
When they know why you like it so much, I'm sure they will. Of
course you <em>do</em> like it&mdash;you roguish little lover!" A spasm
rewarded this demoniacal phrase. "Darling little boy, the serenade
goes on like this:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Oh, my Lolita, come to my heart:<br/>
Oh, come beloved, love let me press thee,<br/>
While I caress thee<br/>
In one long kiss, Lolita!<br/>
Lolita come! Let me&#11834;"

</p>
</div>
<p>Hedrick sprang to his feet with a yell of agony. "Laura Madison,
you tattle-tale," he bellowed, "I'll never forgive you as long
as I live! I'll get even with you if it takes a thousand years!"</p>

<p>With that, and pausing merely to kick a rung out of a chair which
happened to be in his way, he rushed from the room.</p>

<p>His sisters had risen to go, and Cora flung her arms round Laura
in ecstacy. "You mean old viper!" she cried. "You could have told
me days ago! It's almost too good to be true: it's the first time
in my whole life I've felt safe from the Pest for a moment!"</p>

<p>Laura shook her head. "My conscience troubles me; it did seem
as if I ought to tell you&mdash;and mamma thought so, too; and I gave
him warning, but now that I have done it, it seems rather mean
and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed Cora. "You just gave me a chance to protect myself
for once, thank heaven!" And she picked up her skirts and danced
her way into the front hall.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," said Laura, following, "I shouldn't have done it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Laura," cried the younger girl, "I am having the best time,
these days! This just caps it." She lowered her voice, but her
eyes grew even brighter. "I think I've shown a certain gentleman
a few things he didn't understand!"</p>

<p>"Who, dear?"</p>

<p>"Val," returned Cora lightly; "Valentine Corliss. I think he
knows a little more about women than he did when he first came
here."</p>

<p>"You've had a difference with him?" asked Laura with eager hopefulness.
"You've broken with him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, no! Nothing like that." Cora leaned to her confidentially.
"He told me, once, he'd be at the feet of any woman that could
help put through an affair like his oil scheme, and I decided
I'd just show him what I could do. He'd talk about it to me; then
he'd laugh at me. That very Sunday when I got papa to go in&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But he didn't," said Laura helplessly. "He only said he'd try
to&#11834;when he gets well."</p>

<p>"It's all the same&mdash;and it'll be a great thing for him, too,"
said Cora, gayly. "Well, that very afternoon before Val left,
he practically told me I was no good. Of course he didn't use
just those words&mdash;that isn't his way&mdash;but he laughed at me. And
haven't I shown him! I sent Richard a note that very night saying
papa had consented to be secretary of the company, and Richard
had said he'd go in if papa did that, and he couldn't break his
word&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know," said Laura, sighing. "I know."</p>

<p>"Laura" &mdash;Cora spoke with sudden gravity&mdash;"did you ever
know anybody like me? I'm almost getting superstitious about it,
because it seems to me I <em>always</em> get just what I set out
to get. I believe I could have anything in the world if I tried
for it."</p>

<p>"I hope so, if you tried for something good for you," said Laura
sadly. "Cora, dear, you will&mdash;you will be a little easy on Hedrick,
won't you?"</p>

<p>Cora leaned against the newel and laughed till she was exhausted.</p>
