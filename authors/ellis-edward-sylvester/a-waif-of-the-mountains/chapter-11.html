<p>"Wade Ruggles, as I'm alive!" exclaimed the delighted landlord,
rushing forward and grasping his hand. Instantly the group closed
in, and there was such laughing and handshaking that for a time
nothing was clearly distinguished.</p>

<p>"I was suspicious," remarked the parson; "but, though you both
had beards when you went away, these have grown so much that they
have greatly altered your appearance."</p>

<p>He scanned the other man closely, but before the parson had identified
him, several others had done so.</p>

<p>"It's Al Bidwell!"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the laughing Ruggles; "that's the fellow, but
I'm sorry to say that since they made a major-general of him,
he's become a reg'lar dude. He doesn't go out when it rains for
fear of soiling his uniform, and the noise of powder makes him
sick, so be careful how you handle the delicate fellow."</p>

<p>"Well, you do not need to be told," was the hearty response of
the parson, "that no one could be more welcome than you; let's
shake hands all around again."</p>

<p>It was some minutes before the flurry was over, for the delight
on both sides was unbounded and the joy of the reunion great.</p>

<p>One member of the group lingered in the background. Her face
was flushed with delighted expectancy, but with a coyness unknown
in her earlier years, she hesitated on the outer edge of the circle.
She could not mingle with the rush and waited until the flurry
was over. The men were scarcely less embarrassed than she, and
while not appearing to see her, both were watching her every movement.
When the time came that the meeting could no longer be delayed,
Ruggles walked to her and extended his hand.</p>

<p>"Well, Nellie, aren't you glad to see me?"</p>

<p>The crinkling of the whiskers at the side of the invisible mouth
showed that he was laughing, and indeed his white teeth gleamed
through his wealth of beard. Nellie promptly advanced and met
him half way.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ruggles, I can't tell you how glad I am to meet you again."</p>

<p>He had been asking himself whether it would do to kiss this vision
of loveliness. He wished to do so, but was afraid. However, the
question was settled by the girl, who, instead of taking the hand,
flung her arms about his neck and saluted him fervently, that
is as well as she could under the conditions.</p>

<p>Al Bidwell came forward and was received in the same manner.
Then, as the two men stepped back and looked admiringly at her,
she said:</p>

<p>"I can see you are the same and yet those beards make you look
different; I love to think of you as you were when you bade us
good-by and rode off four years ago."</p>

<p>"We shall be glad to fix up our faces in the old style," said
Ruggles, while his companion nodded assent. If she had asked them
to cut off their heads they would have unhesitatingly agreed to
do it.</p>

<p>"No doubt we've changed somewhat," said Bidwell, "but not one
half so much as you."</p>

<p>"As I!" she repeated in astonishment; "why, I am just the same,"
and she looked down at her dress, as if seeking the explanation
of his remark; "I haven't changed a bit."</p>

<p>"Not in goodness and all that sort of thing, but we left a little
girl and now I'm blessed if we don't find a young woman, and yet
it's the same little girl after all."</p>

<p>The maidenly blush darkened her face and she laughed.</p>

<p>"You couldn't expect me to stand still all these years."</p>

<p>"No; though we would have been glad if you had done so."</p>

<p>The three were standing apart, the others with commendable delicacy
leaving them to themselves. Nellie laid her arm on the sleeve
of Ruggles, and looking up yearningly in his face she asked:</p>

<p>"Can you give me any news of father?"</p>

<p>"Being as him and me was on different sides, I haven't seen or
heard a thing of him since we parted in San Francisco, but I hope
all has gone well with him."</p>

<p>She turned to Bidwell, who said:</p>

<p>"Me and him was thrown together once or twice and I met him after
Gettysburg, where neither of us got a scratch, which is more than
tens of thousands of others can say. Then I seen him in front
of Petersburg, where we had the same good luck agin, but in the
fighting round there we lost track of each other. Are you worried
about him, little gal?"</p>

<p>"Very much," she mournfully replied; "never once did Vose Adams
come back from Sacramento without one or two letters from him,
but he has now done so twice, and I haven't heard a word. I fear
father is dead; if he is, my heart is broken and I shall die too."</p>

<p>What could they say to cheer her, for Vose Adams made still another
journey westward with the same dismal emptiness of the mail bag,
so far as she was concerned. Every one did his utmost to cheer
her, but none succeeded. The ground taken was that the parent
had set out on his return, but had been hindered by some cause
which would be explained when he finally arrived. When not one
of the men himself believed the story, how could he hope to make
the mourning daughter believe it?</p>

<p>Felix Brush took a different stand from the others. He early
settled into the belief that Captain Dawson was dead, and that
it was wrong to encourage hope on the part of the child when the
disappointment must be more bitter in the end.</p>

<p>"If you are never to see him again in this world," he said, at
the close of a sultry afternoon, as the two were seated on a rocky
ledge near the cabin in which she had made her home all alone
during her parent's long absence, "what a blessed memory he leaves
behind him! Died on the field of battle, or in camp or hospital,
in the service of his country,&mdash;what more glorious epitaph can
patriot desire?"</p>

<p>"If he is dead then I shall die; I shall pray that I may do so,
so that I shall soon see him again."</p>

<p>"My dear child, you must show some of the courage of your parent
and prove that you are a soldier's daughter. Your blow is a severe
one, but it has fallen upon thousands of others, and they have
bravely met it. You are young; you have seen nothing of the great
world around you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not care to see anything of it," she interrupted with a
sigh.</p>

<p>"You will feel different when you have recovered from the blow.
It is an amazing world, my dear. The cities and towns; the great
ocean; the works of art; the ships and steamboats; the vast structures;
the railways; the multitudes of people; the lands beyond the seas,
with still more marvelous scenes,&mdash;all these will expand like
fairy land before you and make you wonder that you ever should
have wished to leave such a realm of beauty and miracles while
in your youth."</p>

<p>Nellie sat for some time in silence, and then rose to her feet
with a weary sigh. Without speaking, she turned to walk away,
but not in the direction of her own home.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To look for him," was her sorrowful reply.</p>

<p>It was what he suspected and feared. He knew she had done the
same thing night after night for weeks past, even when the rains
fell and the chilling blasts made her shiver with discomfort.
He could not interpose, and with the reflection that perhaps it
was as well, he turned mournfully aside and walked slowly toward
the cabins.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nellie Dawson passed beyond the limits of the settlement
until all the houses were behind her. She did not sit down, but
folding her arms, after gathering her shawl about her, bent her
gaze upon the trail, which wound in and out at the bottom of the
ca√±on below, for a fourth of a mile, when a mass of projecting
rocks hid it from sight.</p>

<p>Night was closing in. Already the grim walls, thousands of feet
in height, were wrapped in gloom, and few eyes beside hers could
have traced the devious mule path for more than a hundred yards
from where she stood. The clear sky was studded with stars, but
the moon had not yet climbed from behind the towering peaks, which
would shut out its light until near the zenith.</p>

<p>The soft murmur of the distant waterfall, the sound of voices
behind her, the faint, hollow roar, which always is present in
a vast solitude, filled the great space around her and made the
stillness grander and more impressive.</p>

<p>All this had been in her ears many a time before, and little
heed did she give to it now. Her musings were with that loved
one, who had been silent for so many weeks, and for whose coming
she longed with an unspeakable longing. She knew the course of
the trail so well, though she had never been far over it, that
she was aware at what point he must first appear, if he ever appeared,
and upon that point she centered her attention.</p>

<p>"Something tells me that when father comes it will be in the
night time," she said; "I know he has tried hard to reach me,
and what could it be that held him back? I will not believe he
is dead until&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her heart gave a quicker throb, for surely that was a faint sound
in the path, though too far off for her to perceive the cause.
She could not tell its precise nature, but fancied it was the
footfall of some animal. She took several quick steps forward
on tiptoe, with head extended, peering and listening, with all
her senses at the highest tension.</p>

<p>Hark! she heard it again. Surely it was the noise of hoofs, for
it was repeated and the sounds ran into each other as if the animal
were trotting or galloping, or mayhap there was more than one
of them.</p>

<p>Yes; some one was drawing nigh on the back of horse or mule.
There was no mistaking the hoof beats, and in the gloom the figure
of an animal and his rider assumed vague form, growing more distinct
each moment. Nellie broke into a run, her arms outstretched and
her hair flying.</p>

<p>"Father! father! I know it is you! It is I &mdash;Nellie, your
own Nellie, who has waited so long for you! You have come at last!"</p>
