<p>The Son of The First Woman strode proudly through the forest. He
carried a spear, jauntily, and there was a bow and arrows slung to his
back. Behind him came ten other males of his species, similarly armed,
and each walked as though he owned the earth he trod. Toward them along
the trail, though still beyond their sight, or hearing, or smell, came
a woman of their kind. She, too, walked with fearless step. Presently
her eyes narrowed and she paused, up-pricking her great, flat ears
to listen; sniffing the air. Men! She increased her gait to a trot,
bearing down upon them. There was more than one--there were several.
If she came upon them suddenly they would be startled, filled with
confusion, and no doubt she could seize one of them before they took to
flight. If not--the feathered pebbles at her girdle would seek one out.
</p>
<p>For some time men had been scarce. Many women of her tribe who had gone
out into the forest to capture mates had never returned. She had seen
the corpses of several of these herself, lying in the forest. She had
wondered what had killed them. But here were men at last, the first she
had discovered in two moons, and this time she would not return empty
handed to her cave.
</p><p>At a sudden turning of the forest trail she came within sight of them,
but saw, to her dismay, that they were still a long way off. They
would be sure to escape if they saw her, and she was upon the point
of hiding when she realized that already it was too late. One of them
was pointing at her. Loosing a missile from her girdle and grasping
her cudgel more firmly she started toward them at a rapid, lumbering
run. She was both surprised and pleased when she saw that they made no
attempt to escape. How terrified they must be to stand thus docilely
while she approached them. But what was this? They were advancing to
meet her! And now she saw the expressions upon their faces. No fear
there--only rage and menace. What were the strange things they carried
in their hands? One who was running toward her, the nearest, paused and
hurled a long pointed stick at her. It was sharp and when it grazed her
shoulder it brought blood. Another paused and holding a little stick
across a longer stick, the ends of which were bent back with a piece
of gut, suddenly released the smaller stick, which leaped through the
air and pierced the flesh beneath one of her arms. And behind these two
the others were rushing upon her with similar weapons. She recalled the
corpses of women she had seen in the forest and the dearth of men for
the past several moons, and though she was dull of wit yet she was not
without reasoning faculties and so she compared these facts with the
occurrences of the past few seconds with a resultant judgment that sent
her lumbering away, in the direction from which she had come, as fast
as her hairy legs could carry her, nor did she once pause in her mad
flight until she sank exhausted at the mouth of her own cave.
</p><p>The men did not pursue her. As yet they had not reached that stage
in their emancipation that was to give them sufficient courage and
confidence in themselves to entirely overcome their hereditary fear of
women. To chase one away was sufficient. To pursue her would have been
tempting Providence.
</p><p>When the other women of the tribe saw their fellow stagger to her cave
and sensed that her condition was the result of terror and the physical
strain of long flight they seized their cudgels and ran forth, prepared
to meet and vanquish her pursuer, which they immediately assumed to be
a lion. But no lion appeared and then some of them wandered to the side
of the woman who lay panting on her threshold.
</p><p>"From what did you run?" they asked her in their simple sign language.
</p><p>"Men," she replied.
</p><p>Disgust showed plainly upon every face, and one of them kicked her and
another spat upon her.
</p><p>"There were many," she told them, "and they would have killed me with
flying sticks. Look!" and she showed them the spear wound, and the
arrow still embedded in the flesh beneath her arm. "They did not run
from me, but came forward to attack me. Thus have all the women been
killed whose corpses we have seen in the forest during the past few
moons."
</p><p>This troubled them. They ceased to annoy the prostrate woman. Their
leader, the fiercest of them, paced to and fro, making hideous faces.
Suddenly she halted.
</p><p>"Come!" she signaled. "We shall go forth together and find these men,
and bring them back and punish them." She shook her cudgel above her
head and grimaced horribly.
</p><p>The others danced about her, imitating her expression and her actions,
and when she started off toward the forest they trooped behind her, a
savage, blood-thirsty company--all but the woman who still lay panting
where she had fallen. She had had enough of man--she was through with
him forever.
</p>
<p>"For this you shall die!" screamed Caraftap, as he rushed upon Tarzan
of the Apes in the long gallery of the slaves' quarters in the quarry
of Elkomoelhago, king of Veltopismakus.
</p><p>The ape-man stepped quickly aside, avoiding the other, and tripped him
with a foot, sending him sprawling, face downward, upon the floor.
Caraftap, before he arose, looked about as though in search of a
weapon and, his eyes alighting upon the hot brazier, he reached forth
to seize it. A murmur of disapproval rose from the slaves who, having
been occupied nearby, had seen the inception of the quarrel.
</p><p>"No weapons!" cried one. "It is not permitted among us. Fight with your
bare hands or not at all."
</p><p>But Caraftap was too drunk with hate and jealousy to hear them or to
heed, and so he grasped the brazier and, rising, rushed at Tarzan to
hurl it in his face. Now it was another who tripped him and this time
two slaves leaped upon him and wrenched the brazier from his hand.
"Fight fair!" they admonished him, and dragged him to his feet.
</p><p>Tarzan had stood smiling and indifferent, for the rage of others
amused him where it was greater than circumstances warranted, and now
he waited for Caraftap and when his adversary saw the smile upon his
face it but increased his spleen, so that he fairly leaped upon the
ape-man in his madness to destroy him, and Tarzan met him with the most
surprising defense that Caraftap, who for long had been a bully among
the slaves, ever had encountered. It was a doubled fist at the end
of a straight arm and it caught Caraftap upon the point of his chin,
stretching him upon his back. The slaves, who had by this time gathered
in considerable numbers to watch the quarrel, voiced their approval in
the shrill, "Ee-ah-ee-ah," that constituted one form of applause.
</p><p>Dazed and groggy, Caraftap staggered to his feet once more and with
lowered head looked about him as though in search of his enemy. The
girl, Talaskar, had come to Tarzan's side and was standing there
looking up into his face.
</p><p>"You are very strong," she said, but the expression in her eyes said
more, or at least it seemed to Caraftap to say more. It seemed to speak
of love, whereas it was only the admiration that a normal woman always
feels for strength exercised in a worthy cause.
</p><p>Caraftap made a noise in his throat that sounded much like the squeal
of an angry pig and once again he rushed upon the ape-man. Behind them
some slaves were being let into the corridor and as the aperture was
open one of the warriors beyond it, who chanced to be stooping down
at the time, could see within. He saw but little, though what he saw
was enough--a large slave with a shock of black hair raising another
large slave high above his head and dashing him to the hard floor. The
warrior, pushing the slaves aside, scrambled through into the corridor
and ran forward toward the center. Before they were aware of his
presence he stood facing Tarzan and Talaskar. It was Kalfastoban.
</p><p>"What is the meaning of this?" he cried in a loud voice, and then:
"Ah, ha! I see. It is The Giant. He would show the other slaves how
strong he is, would he?" He glanced at Caraftap, struggling to rise
from the floor, and his face grew very dark--Caraftap was a favorite of
his. "Such things are not permitted here, fellow!" he cried, shaking
his fist in the ape-man's face, and forgetting in his anger that the
new slave neither spoke nor understood. But presently he recollected
and motioned Tarzan to follow him. "A hundred lashes will explain to
him that he must not quarrel," he said aloud to no one in particular,
but he was looking at Talaskar.
</p><p>"Do not punish him," cried the girl, still forgetful of herself. "It
was all Caraftap's fault, Zuanthrol but acted in self-defense."
</p><p>Kalfastoban could not take his eyes from the girl's face and presently
she sensed her danger and flushed, but still she stood her ground,
interceding for the ape-man. A crooked smile twisted Kalfastoban's
mouth as he laid a familiar hand upon her shoulder.
</p><p>"How old are you?" he asked.
</p><p>She told him, shuddering.
</p><p>"I shall see your master and purchase you," he announced. "Take no
mate."
</p><p>Tarzan was looking at Talaskar and it seemed that he could see her
wilt, as a flower wilts in noxious air, and then Kalfastoban turned
upon him.
</p><p>"You cannot understand me, you stupid beast," he said; "but I can
tell you, and those around you may listen and, perhaps, guide you from
danger. This time I shall let you off, but let it happen again and you
shall have a hundred lashes, or worse, maybe; and if I hear that you
have had aught to do with this girl, whom I intend to purchase and take
to the surface, it will go still harder with you," with which he strode
to the entrance and passed through into the corridor beyond.
</p><p>After the Vental had departed and the door of the chamber been closed
a hand was laid upon Tarzan's shoulder from behind and a man's voice
called him by name: "Tarzan!" It sounded strange in his ears, far down
in this buried chamber beneath the ground, in an alien city and among
an alien people, not one of whom ever had heard his name, but as he
turned to face the man who had greeted him a look of recognition and a
smile of pleasure overspread his features.
</p><p>"Kom--!" he started to ejaculate, but the other placed a finger to his
lips. "Not here," he said. "Here I am Aoponato."
</p><p>"But your stature! You are as large as I. It is beyond me. What has
happened to swell the race of Minunians to such relatively gigantic
proportions?"
</p><p>Komodoflorensal smiled. "Human egotism would not permit you to
attribute this change to an opposite cause from that to which you have
ascribed it," he said.
</p><p>Tarzan knit his brows and gazed long and thoughtfully at his royal
friend. An expression that was of mingled incredulity and amusement
crept gradually over his countenance.
</p><p>"You mean," he asked slowly, "that I have been reduced in size to the
stature of a Minunian?"
</p><p>Komodoflorensal nodded. "Is it not easier to believe that than to think
that an entire race of people and all their belongings, even their
dwellings and the stones that they were built of, and all their weapons
and their diadets, had been increased in size to your own stature?"
</p><p>"But I tell you it is impossible!" cried the ape-man.
</p><p>"I should have said the same thing a few moons ago," replied the
prince. "Even when I heard the rumor here that they had reduced you
I did not believe it, not for a long time, and I was still a bit
skeptical until I entered this chamber and saw you with my own eyes."
</p><p>"How was it accomplished?" demanded Tarzan.
</p><p>"The greatest mind in Veltopismakus, and perhaps in all Minuni, is
Zoanthrohago," explained Komodoflorensal. "We have recognized this
for many moons, for, during the occasional intervals that we are at
peace with Veltopismakus, there is some exchange of ideas as well as
goods between the two cities, and thus we heard of the many marvels
attributed to this greatest of walmaks."
</p><p>"I have never heard a wizard spoken of in Minuni until now," said
Tarzan, for he thought that that was the meaning of the word <u>walmak</u>,
and perhaps it is, as nearly as it can be translated into English. A
scientist who works miracles would be, perhaps, a truer definition.
</p><p>"It was Zoanthrohago who captured you," continued Aoponato,
"encompassing your fall by means at once scientific and miraculous.
After you had fallen he caused you to lose consciousness and while you
were in that condition you were dragged hither by a score of diadets
hitched to a hastily improvised litter built of small trees tied
securely one to the other, after their branches had been removed. It
was after they had you safely within Veltopismakus that Zoanthrohago
set to work upon you to reduce your stature, using apparatus that he
has built himself. I have heard them discussing it and they say that it
did not take him long."
</p><p>"I hope that Zoanthrohago has the power to undo that which he has
done," said the ape-man.
</p><p>"They say that that is doubtful. He has never been able to make
a creature larger than it formerly was, though in his numerous
experiments he has reduced the size of many of the lower animals.
The fact of the matter is," continued Aoponato, "that he has been
searching for a means to enlarge the Veltopismakusians so that they
may overcome all the other peoples of Minuni, but he has only succeeded
in developing a method that gives precisely opposite results from that
which they seek, so, if he cannot make others larger, I doubt if he can
make you any larger than you now are."
</p><p>"I would be rather helpless among the enemies of my own world," said
Tarzan, ruefully.
</p><p>"You need not worry about that, my friend," said the prince gently.
</p><p>"Why?" asked the ape-man.
</p><p>"Because you have very little chance of reaching your own world again,"
said Komodoflorensal, a trifle sadly. "I have no hope of ever seeing
Trohanadalmakus again. Only by the utter overthrow of Veltopismakus
by my father's warriors could I hope for rescue, since nothing less
could overcome the guard in the quarry mouth. While we often capture
slaves of the white tunic from the enemies' cities, it is seldom that
we gather in any of the green tunic. Only in the rare cases of utter
surprise attacks by daylight do any of us catch an enemy's green slaves
above ground, and surprise day attacks may occur once in the lifetime
of a man, or never."
</p><p>"You believe that we will spend the rest of our lives in this
underground hole?" demanded Tarzan.
</p><p>"Unless we chance to be used for labor above-ground during the daytime,
occasionally," replied the prince of Trohanadalmakus, with a wry smile.
</p><p>The ape-man shrugged. "We shall see," he said.
</p><p>After Kalfastoban had left, Caraftap had limped away to the far end of
the chamber, muttering to himself, his ugly face black and scowling.
</p><p>"I am afraid that he will make you trouble," Talaskar said to Tarzan,
indicating the disgruntled slave with a nod of her shapely head, "and I
am sorry, for it is all my fault."
</p><p>"Your fault?" demanded Komodoflorensal.
</p><p>"Yes," said the girl. "Caraftap was threatening me when Aopontando
interfered and punished him."
</p><p>"Aopontando?" queried Komodoflorensal.
</p><p>"That is my number," explained Tarzan.
</p><p>"And it was on account of Talaskar that you were fighting? I thank you,
my friend. I am sorry that I was not here to protect her. Talaskar
cooks for me. She is a good girl." Komodoflorensal was looking at the
girl as he spoke and Tarzan saw how her eyes lowered beneath his gaze
and the delicate flush that mounted her cheeks, and he realized that he
was down-wind from an idea, and smiled.
</p><p>"So this is the Aoponato of whom you told me?" he said to Talaskar.
</p><p>"Yes, this is he."
</p><p>"I am sorry that he was captured, but it is good to find a friend
here," said the ape-man. "We three should be able to hit upon some
plan of escape," but they shook their heads, smiling sadly.
</p><p>For a while, after they had eaten, they sat talking together, being
joined occasionally by other slaves, for Tarzan had many friends here
now since he had chastized Caraftap and they would have talked all
night had not the ape-man questioned Komodoflorensal as to the sleeping
arrangements of the slaves.
</p><p>Komodoflorensal laughed, and pointed here and there about the chamber
at recumbent figures lying upon the hard earthen floor; men, women
and children sleeping, for the most part, where they had eaten their
evening meal.
</p><p>"The green slaves are not pampered," he remarked laconically.
</p><p>"I can sleep anywhere," said Tarzan, "but more easily when it is dark.
I shall wait until the lights are extinguished."
</p><p>"You will wait forever, then," Komodoflorensal told him.
</p><p>"The lights are never extinguished?" demanded the ape-man.
</p><p>"Were they, we should all be soon dead," replied the prince. "These
flames serve two purposes--they dissipate the darkness and consume
the foul gases that would otherwise quickly asphyxiate us. Unlike the
ordinary flame, that consumes oxygen, these candles, perfected from the
discoveries and inventions of an ancient Minunian scientist, consume
the deadly gases and liberate oxygen. It is because of this even more
than for the light they give that they are used exclusively throughout
Minuni. Even our domes would be dark, ill-smelling, noxious places were
it not for them, while the quarries would be absolutely unworkable."
</p><p>"Then I shall not wait for them to be extinguished," said Tarzan,
stretching himself at full length upon the dirt floor, with a nod and a
"Tuano!"--a Minunian "Good night!"--to Talaskar and Komodoflorensal.
