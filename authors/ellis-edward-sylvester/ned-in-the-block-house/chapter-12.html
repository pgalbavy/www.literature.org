<p>The garrison within the block-house saw the November day draw
to an end, and the darkness of night closing in over river, forest
and clearing, with sad forebodings of what was to come before
the rising of the morrow's sun.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston and Jo Stinger agreed that the experiment with
the burning arrows had resulted more favorably to the Wyandots
than to the whites. The flaming missiles were undoubtedly launched
as a test or experiment. True, each one had fallen to the ground
without inflicting material damage, but one of them clung to its
position so long as to encourage the assailants to repeat the
attempt.</p>

<p>"When the roof is stuck full of 'em," said Stinger, "and they're
p'inting upward like the quills of a porcupine, and every one
of them arrers is a camp-fire of itself, why then, look out,&mdash;that's
all I've got to say."</p>

<p>"I know of no reason why&mdash;hello! there's another!"</p>

<p>The speakers ran to the loopholes and looked out. Megill said
it had been fired from the cabin nearest them: he had noticed
the wisp of burning tow at the moment it sprang upward from the
window. The archer who dispatched it, kept himself out of view,
Megill only catching sight of his brawny hand, as he launched
the flaming shaft.</p>

<p>This arrow was not heard to slide down the roof and fall to the
ground as did the others. It kept its place, and so profound was
the stillness within the block-house that every one distinctly
heard the crackling of the flames overhead.</p>

<p>More than one heart beat faster, as the friends looked at each
other, and more than one face blanched, when the full import of
this ominous occurrence became known.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger drew his chair beneath the trap-door and carefully
lifted the slabs a few inches. He saw the arrow, which had been
fired with astonishing accuracy, and which had been sent to such
a height that it descended almost perpendicularly, the flint-head
sinking a full inch in the dry wood.</p>

<p>This rapid sweep through air had fanned the twist of tow into
a strong blaze, and it was now burning vigorously. The flame was
so hot indeed that the shaft had caught fire, and it looked, at
the first glance, as though it would communicate with the roof
itself.</p>

<p>This was hardly likely; though, as Stinger himself had declared,
the danger would be very imminent when a large number were burning
at the same time on different portions of the top of the building.</p>

<p>The pioneer extended the barrel of his rifle until he reached
the burning missile, when he knocked it loose by a smart blow.
As before, it slid down the steeply shelving roof and dropped,
smoking, to the ground, where it burned itself harmlessly away.</p>

<p>The expectation was general on the part of the garrison that
a shower of burning arrows would now be sent from every portion
of the wood. The suspense was great, but, to the surprise of all,
the minutes passed without any demonstration of the kind.</p>

<p>The night, like the preceding one, was chilly and crisp, but
it was clearer. A gibbous moon shone from the sky, save when the
straggling clouds drifted across its face, and sent grotesque
shadows gliding along the clearing and over the block-house and
woods. A dozen black specks, almost in the shape of the letter
Y, suddenly passed over the moon, and the honking cry which sounded
high up in air, showed they were wild geese flying southward.</p>

<p>As the minutes wore on without any molestation from the Wyandots,
Mrs. Preston went down the ladder and started the smouldering
embers into life. This was not for the purpose of cooking, for
enough of that was done at noon, and the rations had already been
distributed; but it was with a view of adding to the comfort of
those above, by giving them a little warmth.</p>

<p>She took care to keep out of the range of any lurking red men
who might steal up and fire through the windows on the opposite
side, the only spot from which a shot could reach her; but to
attain the point of firing, an Indian would have been forced to
scale the stockade, and none of them as yet had attempted that.</p>

<p>Ned Preston stooped at the loophole, looking out over the clearing
toward the Licking, from which he and Blossom Brown had made such
a daring run for life and liberty. Out in the darkness beyond,
he had parted from Deerfoot the Shawanoe, the Indian youth who
was so deeply attached to him. Ned more than suspected his friend
had given up his life for his sake. Placed, as was Deerfoot, there
seemed to be no possibility of his eluding the Wyandots, who looked
upon him as the worst of traitors that encumbered the earth.</p>

<p>"He asked me about the Great Spirit of the white man," thought
Ned Preston, as he recalled that conversation over the letter
which was tied to the arrow sent through the window; "and I promised
I would tell him something: I feel as though I had not done my
duty."</p>

<p>The lad was thoughtful a moment, oppressed by the remorse which
comes to us when we feel we have thrown away an opportunity that
may never return; but he soon rallied, as he remembered the words
so often spoken by his good mother.</p>

<p>"God knows all hearts and he judges us aright: if Deerfoot was
groping after our Great Spirit, he found him before he died, for
God is so good and kind that he has gone to him, but O how glad
I would be, if I could only believe Deerfoot had got away, and
that I shall see him again!"</p>

<p>Ned Preston was roused from these gloomy reflections by the discovery
that something was going on in front of him, though for some time
he could not divine its character.</p>

<p>The uncertain light of the moon annoyed him, and prevented his
learning what would have been quickly detected by Jo Stinger.</p>

<p>When the moon shone with unobstructed light, Ned could follow
the outlines of the Wyandot warrior stretched out in death on
the clearing in front: when the clouds drifted over its face,
everything was swallowed in darkness.</p>

<p>In the mood of young Preston, a person sometimes shows a singular
disposition to observe trifling details and incidents. On almost
any other occasion he would not have noticed that the body of
the Wyandot lay in such a position that the head was within an
arm's length of a stump, while the feet was about the same distance
from another.</p>

<p>At the moment of deepest mental depression, the boy noted this,
and he muttered to himself, during the succeeding minutes, until
the moon came out again from behind the clouds. Just then he was
looking toward the prostrate figure, and he observed that it had
shifted its position.</p>

<p>The head was within a few inches of a stump, while the feet were
correspondingly removed from the other. The difference was so
marked that there was no room for self-deception in the matter.</p>

<p>"It must be he is alive!" was the thought of Ned, "and has been
feigning death all these hours."</p>

<p>He was on the point of calling to his uncle, when he reflected
that no mercy was likely to be shown the warrior, in case he was
only wounded. Ned felt a sympathy for the poor wretch, and, though
he had been his most merciless enemy, the boy resolved that he
would do nothing to obstruct his final escape.</p>

<p>He now centered his gaze on the figure and watched it with deep
interest. So long as the flood of moonlight rested on it, it remained
as motionless as the stumps near it; but at the end of ten minutes
a thick cloud sailed slowly by the orb, obscuring its light only
a few minutes.</p>

<p>As soon as all was clear, Ned exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>He's moved again!</em>"</p>

<p>"That's so, but he had help."</p>

<p>It was Jo Stinger who stood at the elbow of Ned, looking through
the adjoining loophole. The boy turned to the scout, and said
in an entreating voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't shoot him, Jo; give the poor fellow a chance!"</p>

<p>Jo laughed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't waste ammunition on dead men: that varmint has been
as dead as Julius CÃ¦sar ever since he was shot."</p>

<p>"But how does he manage to move himself then?"</p>

<p>"Bless your soul, he doesn't do it: there's a Wyandot behind
that stump at his head, and he's taking a hitch at him whenever
the moon gives him a show."</p>

<p>Ned Preston was astonished, for the truth had never occurred
to him. Jo added&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've catched a glimpse of him once or twice, as he darted from
one stump to another. He came from the river bank, and I could
have picked him off, but I knowed what he's arter, and it's a
principle with the Colonel and me, never to interfere with the
varmints when they want to bury their dead."</p>

<p>Ned Preston was greatly relieved to hear this, but the two said
nothing to the others, through fear that Megill or Turner would
not be so considerate of the wishes of the Colonel, whose authority
over them was more nominal than actual.</p>

<p>The Wyandot who had taken on himself the duty of carrying away
the body of his fallen companion, seemed to acquire confidence
from his success. While Ned and Stinger were watching his movements,
and while the moon shone with unobstructed light, they saw the
body drawn entirely behind the stump, where, after some maneuvering,
the warrior partly straightened up, holding the burden over his
shoulders and back.</p>

<p>Then he sped with surprising quickness for the river bank, down
which he vanished with the load.</p>

<p>His work was done, and the deliverer doubtless believed he had
outwitted the whites, who could have shot him without difficulty
as he ran.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston, and indeed all the garrison, were constantly
expecting the shower of burning arrows, and, because they were
delayed, no one dared hope the Wyandots had given over the intention
of burning them out of their refuge.</p>

<p>When Ned grew weary of scanning the clearing with its uncertain
light, he walked to the northern side of the room which commanded
a view of one portion of the stockade.</p>

<p>Before doing so, he turned to converse a few minutes with his
uncle and aunt. There was no light burning in the upper story,
for the reason that it was likely to serve as a guide to some
of the Indian marksmen who might steal up near enough to fire
through the loopholes.</p>

<p>The children had lain down in the corner, where, after saying
their prayers, they were sleeping the sweet refreshing sleep of
innocency and childhood.</p>

<p>"Their mother is pretty well worn out," said the Colonel, "and
I have persuaded her to take a little rest while the opportunity
is hers."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that, but there is no telling when she will be
awakened&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Hello! there's more mischief!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was recognized as that of Jo Stinger, who had
also shifted his position to the northern side. Colonel Preston
and his nephew instantly hastened to the loopholes and looked
out in the gloom, which just then was at its deepest, as a mass
of clouds were gradually gliding before the moon, which could
be seen only very faintly, when some of the torn edges allowed
its rays to steal through.</p>

<p>"What is it, Jo?" asked the Colonel, rifle in hand.</p>

<p>"About a minute ago, I seen the heads of two of the varmints;
I oughtn't to have hollered as I did, but I was sort of took off
my guard, as you may say."</p>

<p>"Where were they?"</p>

<p>"Out yonder on the stockade; I make no doubt they're climbing
over."</p>

<p>"Give them a shot the moment you get the chance."</p>

<p>"You may be sure I will," replied Jo, who was just able to catch
a glimpse of the moon, which seemed to be struggling to free itself
from the clouds that were smothering it.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston and Ned also shoved their guns through the loopholes,
so as to be ready to fire the instant the opportunity offered.</p>

<p>Jo had indicated the exact place, so that their gaze was turned
to the right point. The Wyandots were not forgetful of the uncertain
light which alternately favored and opposed them. When, therefore,
the eyes were directed toward the proper point, nothing was seen
but the sharply pointed pickets pointing upward, and which looked
as difficult to scale as the spiked fences of modern days.</p>

<p>"They're there," whispered Jo, "and when you see a head, blaze
away at it."</p>

<p>The words were yet in his mouth, when the outlines of a tufted
crown appeared above the stockade, where the Wyandot paused, as
if peeping over. Then a second was outlined at his elbow, the
two remaining stationary a full minute.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot just yet," whispered Stinger.</p>

<p>Ned wondered why the delay was suggested, after his previous
instruction; but, a moment after, the two Wyandots, no doubt with
the assistance of others, suddenly rose higher, so that their
shoulders and bodies were dimly seen. They were climbing over
the stockade.</p>

<p>"<em>Now!</em>" said Jo Stinger.</p>

<p>All three fired, and the red men instantly vanished. It was almost
impossible to take fair aim, but it looked as if the warriors
had been "hit hard."</p>

<p>"We dropped them," said Ned, with some excitement.</p>

<p>"Yes, but they dropped themselves; they're inside the stockade."</p>

<p>"What harm can two of them do, if they <em>are</em> there?" asked
Colonel Preston, quite hopeful that they had slain the Indians.</p>

<p>"There are a half dozen of the varmints at least inside," was
the disquieting statement of Stinger.</p>

<p>"We ought to be able to see them," observed Colonel Preston,
looking searchingly at the spot where the two were discovered.</p>

<p>"When they stand still, you can't see 'em; but when they stir
around, you can just make 'em out."</p>

<p>The reason why the Wyandots had selected this side of the stockade,
was now apparent. The position of the moon in the heavens was
such that the pickets threw a wall of shadow several feet within
the square. When the warriors dropped to the ground, they were
in such gloom that it was almost impossible to see them, except
when they moved away from the fence.</p>

<p>All this being true, it still was not easy to divine their purpose
in climbing the pickets. So long as they remained within the square,
they were in range of the Kentuckians' rifles as much as though
on the clearing in front.</p>
