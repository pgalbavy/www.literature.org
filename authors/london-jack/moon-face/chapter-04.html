<P>
THE elevator boy smiled knowingly to him self. When he took her up, he had
noted the sparkle in her eyes, the color in her cheeks. His little cage had
quite warmed with the glow of her repressed eagerness. And now, on the down
trip, it was glacier-like. The sparkle and the color were gone. She was
frowning, and what little he could see of her eyes was cold and steel-gray.
Oh, he knew the symptoms, he did. He was an observer, and he knew it, too, and
some day, when he was big enough, he was going to be a reporter, sure. And in
the meantime he studied the procession of life as it streamed up and down
eighteen sky-scraper floors in his elevator car. He slid the door open for her
sympathetically and watched her trip determinedly out into the street.
<P>
There was a robustness in her carriage which came of the soil rather than of
the city pavement. But it was a robustness in a finer than the wonted sense, a
vigorous daintiness, it might be called, which gave an impression of virility
with none of the womanly left out. It told of a heredity of seekers and
fighters, of people that worked stoutly with head and hand, of ghosts that
reached down out of the misty past and moulded and made her to be a doer of
things.
<P>
But she was a little angry, and a great deal hurt. "I can guess what you would
tell me," the editor had kindly but firmly interrupted her lengthy preamble in
the long-looked-forward-to interview just ended. "And you have told me
enough," he had gone on (heartlessly, she was sure, as she went over the
conversation in its freshness). "You have done no newspaper work. You are
undrilled, undisciplined, unhammered into shape. You have received a
high-school education, and possibly topped it off with normal school or
college. You have stood well in English. Your friends have all told you how
cleverly you write, and how beautifully, and so forth and so forth. You think
you can do newspaper work, and you want me to put you on. Well, I am sorry,
but there are no openings. If you knew how crowded--"
<P>
"But if there are no openings," she had interrupted, in turn, "how did those
who are in, get in? How am I to show that I am eligible to get in?"
<P>
"They made themselves indispensable," was the terse response. "Make yourself
indispensable."
<P>
"But how can I, if I do not get the chance?"
<P>
"Make your chance."
<P>
"But how?" she had insisted, at the same time privately deeming him a most
unreasonable man.
<P>
"How? That is your business, not mine," he said conclusively, rising in token
that the interview was at an end. "I must inform you, my dear young lady, that
there have been at least eighteen other aspiring young ladies here this week,
and that I have not the time to tell each and every one of them how. The
function I perform on this paper is hardly that of instructor in a school of
journalism."
<P>
She caught an outbound car, and ere she descended from it she had conned the
conversation over and over again. "But how?" she repeated to herself, as she
climbed the three flights of stairs to the rooms where she and her sister
"bach'ed." "But how?" And so she continued to put the interrogation, for the
stubborn Scotch blood, though many times removed from Scottish soil, was still
strong in her. And, further, there was need that she should learn how. Her
sister Letty and she had come up from an interior town to the city to make
their way in the world. John Wyman was land-poor. Disastrous business
enterprises had burdened his acres and forced his two girls, Edna and Letty,
into doing something for themselves. A year of school-teaching and of
night-study of shorthand and typewriting had capitalized their city project
and fitted them for the venture, which same venture was turning out anything
but successful. The city seemed crowded with inexperienced stenographers and
typewriters, and they had nothing but their own inexperience to offer. Edna's
secret ambition had been journalism; but she had planned a clerical position
first, so that she might have time and space in which to determine where and
on what line of journalism she would embark. But the clerical position had not
been forthcoming, either for Letty or her, and day by day their little hoard
dwindled, though the room rent remained normal and the stove consumed coal
with undiminished voracity. And it was a slim little hoard by now.
<P>
"There's Max Irwin," Letty said, talking it over. "He's a journalist with a
national reputation. Go and see him, Ed. He knows how, and he should be able
to tell you how."
<P>
"But I don't know him," Edna objected.
<P>
"No more than you knew the editor you saw to-day."
<P>
"Y-e-s," (long and judicially), "but that's different."
<P>
"Not a bit different from the strange men and women you'll interview when
you've learned how," Letty encouraged.
<P>
"I hadn't looked at it in that light," Edna conceded. "After all, where's the
difference between, interviewing Mr. Max Irwin for some paper, or interviewing
Mr. Max Irwin for myself? It will be practice, too. I'll go and look him up in
the directory."
<P>
"Letty, I know I can write if I get the chance," she announced decisively a
moment later. "I just FEEL that I have the feel of it, if you know what I
mean."
<P>
And Letty knew and nodded. "I wonder what he is like?" she asked softly.
<P>
"I'll make it my business to find out," Edna assured her; "and I'll let you
know inside forty-eight hours."
<P>
Letty clapped her hands. "Good! That's the newspaper spirit! Make it
twenty-four hours and you are perfect!"
<P>
 "--and I am very sorry to trouble you," she concluded the statement of her
case to Max Irwin, famous war correspondent and veteran journalist.
<P>
"Not at all," he answered, with a deprecatory wave of the hand. "If you don't
do your own talking, who's to do it for you? Now I understand your predicament
precisely. You want to get on the INTELLIGENCER, you want to get in at once,
and you have had no previous experience. In the first place, then, have you
any pull? There are a dozen men in the city, a line from whom would be an
open-sesame. After that you would stand or fall by your own ability. There's
Senator Longbridge, for instance, and Claus Inskeep the street-car magnate,
and Lane, and McChesney--" He paused, with voice suspended.
<P>
"I am sure I know none of them," she answered despondently.
<P>
"It's not necessary. Do you know any one that knows them? or any one that
knows any one else that knows them?"
<P>
Edna shook her head.
<P>
"Then we must think of something else," he went on, cheerfully. "You'll have
to do something yourself. Let me see."
<P>
He stopped and thought for a moment, with closed eyes and wrinkled forehead.
She was watching him, studying him intently, when his blue eyes opened with a
snap and his face suddenly brightened.
<P>
"I have it! But no, wait a minute."
<P>
And for a minute it was his turn to study her. And study her he did, till she
could feel her cheeks flushing under his gaze.
<P>
"You'll do, I think, though it remains to be seen," he said enigmatically. "It
will show the stuff that's in you, besides, and it will be a better claim upon
the INTELLIGENCER people than all the lines from all the senators and magnates
in the world. The thing for you is to do Amateur Night at the Loops."
<P>
"I--I hardly understand," Edna said, for his suggestion conveyed no meaning to
her. "What are the 'Loops'? and what is 'Amateur Night'?"
<P>
"I forgot you said you were from the interior. But so much the better, if
you've only got the journalistic grip. It will be a first impression, and
first impressions are always unbiased, unprejudiced, fresh, vivid. The Loops
are out on the rim of the city, near the Park,--a place of diversion. There's
a scenic railway, a water toboggan slide, a concert band, a theatre, wild
animals, moving pictures, and so forth and so forth. The common people go
there to look at the animals and enjoy themselves, and the other people go
there to enjoy themselves by watching the common people enjoy themselves. A
democratic, fresh-air-breathing, frolicking affair, that's what the Loops are.
<P>
"But the theatre is what concerns you. It's vaudeville. One turn follows
another--jugglers, acrobats, rubber-jointed wonders, fire-dancers, coon-song
artists, singers, players, female impersonators, sentimental soloists, and so
forth and so forth. These people are professional vaudevillists. They make
their living that way. Many are excellently paid. Some are free rovers, doing
a turn wherever they can get an opening, at the Obermann, the Orpheus, the
Alcatraz, the Louvre, and so forth and so forth. Others cover circuit pretty
well all over the country. An interesting phase of life, and the pay is big
enough to attract many aspirants.
<P>
"Now the management of the Loops, in its bid for popularity, instituted what
is called 'Amateur Night'; that is to say, twice a week, after the
professionals have done their turns, the stage is given over to the aspiring
amateurs. The audience remains to criticise. The populace becomes the arbiter
of art--or it thinks it does, which is the same thing; and it pays its money
and is well pleased with itself, and Amateur Night is a paying proposition to
the management.
<P>
"But the point of Amateur Night, and it is well to note it, is that these
amateurs are not really amateurs. They are paid for doing their turn. At the
best, they may be termed 'professional amateurs.' It stands to reason that the
management could not get people to face a rampant audience for nothing, and on
such occasions the audience certainly goes mad. It's great fun--for the
audience. But the thing for you to do, and it requires nerve, I assure you, is
to go out, make arrangements for two turns, (Wednesday and Saturday nights, I
believe), do your two turns, and write it up for the SUNDAY INTELLIGENCER."
<P>
"But--but," she quavered, "I--I--" and there was a suggestion of
disappointment and tears in her voice.
<P>
"I see," he said kindly. "You were expecting something else, something
different, something better. We all do at first. But remember the admiral of
the Queen's Na-vee, who swept the floor and polished up the handle of the big
front door. You must face the drudgery of apprenticeship or quit right now.
What do you say?"
<P>
The abruptness with which he demanded her decision startled her. As she
faltered, she could see a shade of disappointment beginning to darken his
face.
<P>
"In a way it must be considered a test," he added encouragingly. "A severe
one, but so much the better. Now is the time. Are you game?"
<P>
"I'll try," she said faintly, at the same time making a note of the
directness, abruptness, and haste of these city men with whom she was coming
in contact.
<P>
"Good! Why, when I started in, I had the dreariest, deadliest details
imaginable. And after that, for a weary time, I did the police and divorce
courts. But it all came well in the end and did me good. You are luckier in
making your start with Sunday work. It's not particularly great. What of it?
Do it. Show the stuff you're made of, and you'll get a call for better
work--better class and better pay. Now you go out this afternoon to the Loops,
and engage to do two turns."
<P>
"But what kind of turns can I do?" Edna asked dubiously.
<P>
"Do? That's easy. Can you sing? Never mind, don't need to sing. Screech, do
anything--that's what you're paid for, to afford amusement, to give bad art
for the populace to howl down. And when you do your turn, take some one along
for chaperon. Be afraid of no one. Talk up. Move about among the amateurs
waiting their turn, pump them, study them, photograph them in your brain. Get
the atmosphere, the color, strong color, lots of it. Dig right in with both
hands, and get the essence of it, the spirit, the significance. What does it
mean? Find out what it means. That's what you're there for. That's what the
readers of the SUNDAY INTELLIGENCER want to know.
<P>
"Be terse in style, vigorous of phrase, apt, concretely apt, in similitude.
Avoid platitudes and commonplaces. Exercise selection. Seize upon things
salient, eliminate the rest, and you have pictures. Paint those pictures in
words and the INTELLIGENCER will have you. Get hold of a few back numbers, and
study the SUNDAY INTELLIGENCER feature story. Tell it all in the opening
paragraph as advertisement of contents, and in the contents tell it all over
again. Then put a snapper at the end, so if they're crowded for space they can
cut off your contents anywhere, reattach the snapper, and the story will still
retain form. There, that's enough. Study the rest out for yourself."
<P>
They both rose to their feet, Edna quite carried away by his enthusiasm and
his quick, jerky sentences, bristling with the things she wanted to know.
<P>
"And remember, Miss Wyman, if you're ambitious, that the aim and end of
journalism is not the feature article. Avoid the rut. The feature is a trick.
Master it, but don't let it master you. But master it you must; for if you
can't learn to do a feature well, you can never expect to do anything better.
In short, put your whole self into it, and yet, outside of it, above it,
remain yourself, if you follow me. And now good luck to you."
<P>
They had reached the door and were shaking hands.
<P>
"And one thing more," he interrupted her thanks, "let me see your copy before
you turn it in. I may be able to put you straight here and there."
<P>
Edna found the manager of the Loops a full-fleshed, heavy-jowled man, bushy of
eyebrow and generally belligerent of aspect, with an absent-minded scowl on
his face and a black cigar stuck in the midst thereof. Symes was his name, she
had learned, Ernst Symes.
<P>
"Whatcher turn?" he demanded, ere half her brief application had left her
lips.
<P>
"Sentimental soloist, soprano," she answered promptly, remembering Irwin's
advice to talk up.
<P>
"Whatcher name?" Mr. Symes asked, scarcely deigning to glance at her.
<P>
She hesitated. So rapidly had she been rushed into the adventure that she had
not considered the question of a name at all.
<P>
"Any name? Stage name?" he bellowed impatiently.
<P>
"Nan Bellayne," she invented on the spur of the moment. "B-e-l-l-a-y-n-e. Yes,
that's it."
<P>
He scribbled it into a notebook. "All right. Take your turn Wednesday and
Saturday."
<P>
"How much do I get?" Edna demanded.
<P>
"Two-an'-a-half a turn. Two turns, five. Getcher pay first Monday after second
turn."
<P>
And without the simple courtesy of "Good day," he turned his back on her and
plunged into the newspaper he had been reading when she entered.
<P>
 Edna came early on Wednesday evening, Letty with her, and in a telescope
basket her costume--a simple affair. A plaid shawl borrowed from the
washerwoman, a ragged scrubbing skirt borrowed from the charwoman, and a gray
wig rented from a costumer for twenty-five cents a night, completed the
outfit; for Edna had elected to be an old Irishwoman singing broken-heartedly
after her wandering boy.
<P>
Though they had come early, she found everything in uproar. The main
performance was under way, the orchestra was playing and the audience
intermittently applauding. The infusion of the amateurs clogged the working of
things behind the stage, crowded the passages, dressing rooms, and wings, and
forced everybody into everybody else's way. This was particularly distasteful
to the professionals, who carried themselves as befitted those of a higher
caste, and whose behavior toward the pariah amateurs was marked by hauteur and
even brutality. And Edna, bullied and elbowed and shoved about, clinging
desperately to her basket and seeking a dressing room, took note of it all.
<P>
A dressing room she finally found, jammed with three other amateur "ladies,"
who were "making up" with much noise, high-pitched voices, and squabbling over
a lone mirror. Her own make-up was so simple that it was quickly accomplished,
and she left the trio of ladies holding an armed truce while they passed
judgment upon her. Letty was close at her shoulder, and with patience and
persistence they managed to get a nook in one of the wings which commanded a
view of the stage.
<P>
A small, dark man, dapper and debonair, swallow-tailed and top-hatted, was
waltzing about the stage with dainty, mincing steps, and in a thin little
voice singing something or other about somebody or something evidently
pathetic. As his waning voice neared the end of the lines, a large woman,
crowned with an amazing wealth of blond hair, thrust rudely past Edna, trod
heavily on her toes, and shoved her contemptuously to the side. "Bloomin'
hamateur!" she hissed as she went past, and the next instant she was on the
stage, graciously bowing to the audience, while the small, dark man twirled
extravagantly about on his tiptoes.
<P>
"Hello, girls!"
<P>
This greeting, drawled with an inimitable vocal caress in every syllable,
close in her ear, caused Edna to give a startled little jump. A smooth-faced,
moon-faced young man was smiling at her good-naturedly. His "make-up" was
plainly that of the stock tramp of the stage, though the inevitable whiskers
were lacking.
<P>
"Oh, it don't take a minute to slap'm on," he explained, divining the search
in her eyes and waving in his hand the adornment in question. "They make a
feller sweat," he explained further. And then, "What's yer turn?"
<P>
"Soprano--sentimental," she answered, trying to be offhand and at ease.
<P>
"Whata you doin' it for?" he demanded directly.
<P>
"For fun; what else?" she countered.
<P>
"I just sized you up for that as soon as I put eyes on you. You ain't graftin'
for a paper, are you?"
<P>
"I never met but one editor in my life," she replied evasively, "and I,
he--well, we didn't get on very well together."
<P>
"Hittin' 'm for a job?"
<P>
Edna nodded carelessly, though inwardly anxious and cudgelling her brains for
something to turn the conversation.
<P>
"What'd he say?"
<P>
"That eighteen other girls had already been there that week."
<P>
"Gave you the icy mit, eh?" The moon-faced young man laughed and slapped his
thighs. "You see, we're kind of suspicious. The Sunday papers 'd like to get
Amateur Night done up brown in a nice little package, and the manager don't
see it that way. Gets wild-eyed at the thought of it."
<P>
"And what's your turn?" she asked.
<P>
"Who? me? Oh, I'm doin' the tramp act tonight. I'm Charley Welsh, you know."
<P>
She felt that by the mention of his name he intended to convey to her complete
enlightenment, but the best she could do was to say politely, "Oh, is that
so?"
<P>
She wanted to laugh at the hurt disappointment which came into his face, but
concealed her amusement.
<P>
"Come, now," he said brusquely, "you can't stand there and tell me you've
never heard of Charley Welsh? Well, you must be young. Why, I'm an Only, the
Only amateur at that. Sure, you must have seen me. I'm everywhere. I could be
a professional, but I get more dough out of it by doin' the amateur."
<P>
"But what's an 'Only'?" she queried. "I want to learn."
<P>
"Sure," Charley Welsh said gallantly. "I'll put you wise. An 'Only' is a
nonpareil, the feller that does one kind of a turn better'n any other feller.
He's the Only, see?"
<P>
And Edna saw.
<P>
"To get a line on the biz," he continued, "throw yer lamps on me. I'm the Only
all-round amateur. To-night I make a bluff at the tramp act. It's harder to
bluff it than to really do it, but then it's acting, it's amateur, it's art.
See? I do everything, from Sheeny monologue to team song and dance and Dutch
comedian. Sure, I'm Charley Welsh, the Only Charley Welsh."
<P>
And in this fashion, while the thin, dark man and the large, blond woman
warbled dulcetly out on the stage and the other professionals followed in
their turns, did Charley Welsh put Edna wise, giving her much miscellaneous
and superfluous information and much that she stored away for the SUNDAY
INTELLIGENCER.
<P>
"Well, tra la loo," he said suddenly. "There's his highness chasin' you up.
Yer first on the bill. Never mind the row when you go on. Just finish yer turn
like a lady."
<P>
It was at that moment that Edna felt her journalistic ambition departing from
her, and was aware of an overmastering desire to be somewhere else. But the
stage manager, like an ogre, barred her retreat. She could hear the opening
bars of her song going up from the orchestra and the noises of the house dying
away to the silence of anticipation.
<P>
"Go ahead," Letty whispered, pressing her hand; and from the other side came
the peremptory "Don't flunk!" of Charley Welsh.
<P>
But her feet seemed rooted to the floor, and she leaned weakly against a shift
scene. The orchestra was beginning over again, and a lone voice from the house
piped with startling distinctness:
<P>
"Puzzle picture! Find Nannie!"
<P>
A roar of laughter greeted the sally, and Edna shrank back. But the strong
hand of the manager descended on her shoulder, and with a quick, powerful
shove propelled her out on to the stage. His hand and arm had flashed into
full view, and the audience, grasping the situation, thundered its
appreciation. The orchestra was drowned out by the terrible din, and Edna
could see the bows scraping away across the violins, apparently without sound.
It was impossible for her to begin in time, and as she patiently waited, arms
akimbo and ears straining for the music, the house let loose again (a favorite
trick, she afterward learned, of confusing the amateur by preventing him or
her from hearing the orchestra).
<P>
But Edna was recovering her presence of mind. She became aware, pit to dome,
of a vast sea of smiling and fun-distorted faces, of vast roars of laughter,
rising wave on wave, and then her Scotch blood went cold and angry. The
hard-working but silent orchestra gave her the cue, and, without making a
sound, she began to move her lips, stretch forth her arms, and sway her body,
as though she were really singing. The noise in the house redoubled in the
attempt to drown her voice, but she serenely went on with her pantomime. This
seemed to continue an interminable time, when the audience, tiring of its
prank and in order to hear, suddenly stilled its clamor, and discovered the
dumb show she had been making. For a moment all was silent, save for the
orchestra, her lips moving on without a sound, and then the audience realized
that it had been sold, and broke out afresh, this time with genuine applause
in acknowledgment of her victory. She chose this as the happy moment for her
exit, and with a bow and a backward retreat, she was off the stage in Letty's
arms.
<P>
The worst was past, and for the rest of the evening she moved about among the
amateurs and professionals, talking, listening, observing, finding out what it
meant and taking mental notes of it all. Charley Welsh constituted himself her
preceptor and guardian angel, and so well did he perform the self-allotted
task that when it was all over she felt fully prepared to write her article.
But the proposition had been to do two turns, and her native pluck forced her
to live up to it. Also, in the course of the intervening days, she discovered
fleeting impressions that required verification; so, on Saturday, she was back
again, with her telescope basket and Letty.
<P>
The manager seemed looking for her, and she caught an expression of relief in
his eyes when he first saw her. He hurried up, greeted her, and bowed with a
respect ludicrously at variance with his previous ogre-like behavior. And as
he bowed, across his shoulders she saw Charley Welsh deliberately wink.
<P>
But the surprise had just begun. The manager begged to be introduced to her
sister, chatted entertainingly with the pair of them, and strove greatly and
anxiously to be agreeable. He even went so far as to give Edna a dressing room
to herself, to the unspeakable envy of the three other amateur ladies of
previous acquaintance. Edna was nonplussed, and it was not till she met
Charley Welsh in the passage that light was thrown on the mystery.
<P>
"Hello!" he greeted her. "On Easy Street, eh? Everything slidin' your way."
<P>
She smiled brightly.
<P>
"Thinks yer a female reporter, sure. I almost split when I saw'm layin'
himself out sweet an' pleasin'. Honest, now, that ain't yer graft, is it?"
<P>
"I told you my experience with editors," she parried. "And honest now, it was
honest, too."
<P>
But the Only Charley Welsh shook his head dubiously. "Not that I care a rap,"
he declared. "And if you are, just gimme a couple of lines of notice, the
right kind, good ad, you know. And if yer not, why yer all right anyway. Yer
not our class, that's straight."
<P>
After her turn, which she did this time with the nerve of an old campaigner,
the manager returned to the charge; and after saying nice things and being
generally nice himself, he came to the point.
<P>
"You'll treat us well, I hope," he said insinuatingly. "Do the right thing by
us, and all that?"
<P>
"Oh," she answered innocently, "you couldn't persuade me to do another turn; I
know I seemed to take and that you'd like to have me, but I really, really
can't."
<P>
"You know what I mean," he said, with a touch of his old bulldozing manner.
<P>
"No, I really won't," she persisted. "Vaudeville's too--too wearing on the
nerves, my nerves, at any rate."
<P>
Whereat he looked puzzled and doubtful, and forbore to press the point
further.
<P>
But on Monday morning, when she came to his office to get her pay for the two
turns, it was he who puzzled her.
<P>
"You surely must have mistaken me," he lied glibly. "I remember saying
something about paying your car fare. We always do this, you know, but we
never, never pay amateurs. That would take the life and sparkle out of the
whole thing. No, Charley Welsh was stringing you. He gets paid nothing for his
turns. No amateur gets paid. The idea is ridiculous. However, here's fifty
cents. It will pay your sister's car fare also. And,"--very
suavely,--"speaking for the Loops, permit me to thank you for the kind and
successful contribution of your services."
<P>
That afternoon, true to her promise to Max Irwin, she placed her typewritten
copy into his hands. And while he ran over it, he nodded his head from time to
time, and maintained a running fire of commendatory remarks: "Good!--that's
it!--that's the stuff!--psychology's all right!--the very idea!--you've caught
it!--excellent!--missed it a bit here, but it'll go--that's vigorous!
--strong!--vivid!--pictures! pictures!--excellent!--most excellent!"
<P>
And when he had run down to the bottom of the last page, holding out his hand:
"My dear Miss Wyman, I congratulate you. I must say you have exceeded my
expectations, which, to say the least, were large. You are a journalist, a
natural journalist. You've got the grip, and you're sure to get on. The
INTELLIGENCER will take it, without doubt, and take you too. They'll have to
take you. If they don't, some of the other papers will get you."
<P>
"But what's this?" he queried, the next instant, his face going serious.
"You've said nothing about receiving the pay for your turns, and that's one of
the points of the feature. I expressly mentioned it, if you'll remember."
<P>
"It will never do," he said, shaking his head ominously, when she had
explained. "You simply must collect that money somehow. Let me see. Let me
think a moment."
<P>
"Never mind, Mr. Irwin," she said. "I've bothered you enough. Let me use your
'phone, please, and I'll try Mr. Ernst Symes again."
<P>
He vacated his chair by the desk, and Edna took down the receiver.
<P>
"Charley Welsh is sick," she began, when the connection had been made. "What?
No I'm not Charley Welsh. Charley Welsh is sick, and his sister wants to know
if she can come out this afternoon and draw his pay for him?"
<P>
"Tell Charley Welsh's sister that Charley Welsh was out this morning, and drew
his own pay," came back the manager's familiar tones, crisp with asperity.
<P>
"All right," Edna went on. "And now Nan Bellayne wants to know if she and her
sister can come out this afternoon and draw Nan Bellayne's pay?"
<P>
"What'd he say? What'd he say?" Max Irwin cried excitedly, as she hung up.
<P>
"That Nan Bellayne was too much for him, and that she and her sister could
come out and get her pay and the freedom of the Loops, to boot."
<P>
"One thing, more," he interrupted her thanks at the door, as on her previous
visit. "Now that you've shown the stuff you're made of, I should esteem it,
ahem, a privilege to give you a line myself to the INTELLIGENCER people."
<P>
