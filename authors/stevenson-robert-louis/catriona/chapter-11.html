<p>I lost no time, but down through the valley and by Stockbridge
and Silvermills as hard as I could stave. It was Alan’s tryst
to be every night between twelve and two "in a bit scrog of wood
by east of Silvermills and by south the south mill-lade." This
I found easy enough, where it grew on a steep brae, with the mill-lade
flowing swift and deep along the foot of it; and here I began
to walk slower and to reflect more reasonably on my employment.
I saw I had made but a fool’s bargain with Catriona. It was not
to be supposed that Neil was sent alone upon his errand, but perhaps
he was the only man belonging to James More; in which case I should
have done all I could to hang Catriona’s father, and nothing the
least material to help myself. To tell the truth, I fancied neither
one of these ideas. Suppose by holding back Neil, the girl should
have helped to hang her father, I thought she would never forgive
herself this side of time. And suppose there were others pursuing
me that moment, what kind of a gift was I come bringing to Alan?
and how would I like that?</p>

<p>I was up with the west end of that wood when these two considerations
struck me like a cudgel. My feet stopped of themselves and my
heart along with them. "What wild game is this that I have been
playing?" thought I; and turned instantly upon my heels to go
elsewhere.</p>

<p>This brought my face to Silvermills; the path came past the village
with a crook, but all plainly visible; and, Highland or Lowland,
there was nobody stirring. Here was my advantage, here was just
such a conjuncture as Stewart had counselled me to profit by,
and I ran by the side of the mill-lade, fetched about beyond the
east corner of the wood, threaded through the midst of it, and
returned to the west selvage, whence I could again command the
path, and yet be myself unseen. Again it was all empty, and my
heart began to rise.</p>

<p>For more than an hour I sat close in the border of the trees,
and no hare or eagle could have kept a more particular watch.
When that hour began the sun was already set, but the sky still
all golden and the daylight clear; before the hour was done it
had fallen to be half mirk, the images and distances of things
were mingled, and observation began to be difficult. All that
time not a foot of man had come east from Silvermills, and the
few that had gone west were honest countryfolk and their wives
upon the road to bed. If I were tracked by the most cunning spies
in Europe, I judged it was beyond the course of nature they could
have any jealousy of where I was: and going a little further home
into the wood I lay down to wait for Alan.</p>

<p>The strain of my attention had been great, for I had watched
not the path only, but every bush and field within my vision.
That was now at an end. The moon, which was in her first quarter,
glinted a little in the wood; all round there was a stillness
of the country; and as I lay there on my back, the next three
or four hours, I had a fine occasion to review my conduct.</p>

<p>Two things became plain to me first: that I had no right to go
that day to Dean, and (having gone there) had now no right to
be lying where I was. This (where Alan was to come) was just the
one wood in all broad Scotland that was, by every proper feeling,
closed against me; I admitted that, and yet stayed on, wondering
at myself. I thought of the measure with which I had meted to
Catriona that same night; how I had prated of the two lives I
carried, and had thus forced her to enjeopardy her father’s; and
how I was here exposing them again, it seemed in wantonness. A
good conscience is eight parts of courage. No sooner had I lost
conceit of my behaviour, than I seemed to stand disarmed amidst
a throng of terrors. Of a sudden I sat up. How if I went now to
Prestongrange, caught him (as I still easily might) before he
slept, and made a full submission? Who could blame me? Not Stewart
the Writer; I had but to say that I was followed, despaired of
getting clear, and so gave in. Not Catriona: here, too, I had
my answer ready; that I could not bear she should expose her father.
So, in a moment, I could lay all these troubles by, which were
after all and truly none of mine; swim clear of the Appin Murder;
get forth out of hand-stroke of all the Stewarts and Campbells,
all the Whigs and Tories, in the land; and live henceforth to
my own mind, and be able to enjoy and to improve my fortunes,
and devote some hours of my youth to courting Catriona, which
would be surely a more suitable occupation than to hide and run
and be followed like a hunted thief, and begin over again the
dreadful miseries of my escape with Alan.</p>

<p>At first I thought no shame of this capitulation; I was only
amazed I had not thought upon the thing and done it earlier; and
began to inquire into the causes of the change. These I traced
to my lowness of spirits, that back to my late recklessness, and
that again to the common, old, public, disconsidered sin of self-indulgence.
Instantly the text came in my head, "<em>How can Satan cast out
Satan</em>?" What? (I thought) I had, by self-indulgence; and
the following of pleasant paths, and the lure of a young maid,
cast myself wholly out of conceit with my own character, and jeopardised
the lives of James and Alan? And I was to seek the way out by
the same road as I had entered in? No; the hurt that had been
caused by self-indulgence must be cured by self-denial; the flesh
I had pampered must be crucified. I looked about me for that course
which I least liked to follow: this was to leave the wood without
waiting to see Alan, and go forth again alone, in the dark and
in the midst of my perplexed and dangerous fortunes.</p>

<p>I have been the more careful to narrate this passage of my reflections,
because I think it is of some utility, and may serve as an example
to young men. But there is reason (they say) in planting kale,
and even in ethic and religion, room for common sense. It was
already close on Alan’s hour, and the moon was down. If I left
(as I could not very decently whistle to my spies to follow me)
they might miss me in the dark and tack themselves to Alan by
mistake. If I stayed, I could at the least of it set my friend
upon his guard which might prove his mere salvation. I had adventured
other peoples’ safety in a course of self-indulgence; to have
endangered them again, and now on a mere design of penance, would
have been scarce rational. Accordingly, I had scarce risen from
my place ere I sat down again, but already in a different frame
of spirits, and equally marvelling at my past weakness and rejoicing
in my present composure.</p>

<p>Presently after came a crackling in the thicket. Putting my mouth
near down to the ground, I whistled a note or two, of Alan’s air;
an answer came in the like guarded tone, and soon we had knocked
together in the dark.</p>

<p>"Is this you at last, Davie?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Just myself," said I.</p>

<p>"God, man, but I’ve been wearying to see ye!" says he. "I’ve
had the longest kind of a time. A’ day, I’ve had my dwelling into
the inside of a stack of hay, where I couldnae see the nebs of
my ten fingers; and then two hours of it waiting here for you,
and you never coming! Dod, and ye’re none too soon the way it
is, with me to sail the morn! The morn? what am I saying?—the
day, I mean."</p>

<p>"Ay, Alan, man, the day, sure enough," said I. "It’s past twelve
now, surely, and ye sail the day. This’ll be a long road you have
before you."</p>

<p>"We’ll have a long crack of it first," said he.</p>

<p>"Well, indeed, and I have a good deal it will be telling you
to hear," said I.</p>

<p>And I told him what behooved, making rather a jumble of it, but
clear enough when done. He heard me out with very few questions,
laughing here and there like a man delighted: and the sound of
his laughing (above all there, in the dark, where neither one
of us could see the other) was extraordinary friendly to my heart.</p>

<p>"Ay, Davie, ye’re a queer character," says he, when I had done:
"a queer bitch after a’, and I have no mind of meeting with the
like of ye. As for your story, Prestongrange is a Whig like yoursel’,
so I’ll say the less of him; and, dod! I believe he was the best
friend ye had, if ye could only trust him. But Simon Fraser and
James More are my ain kind of cattle, and I’ll give them the name
that they deserve. The muckle black deil was father to the Frasers,
a’body kens that; and as for the Gregara, I never could abye the
reek of them since I could stotter on two feet. I bloodied the
nose of one, I mind, when I was still so wambly on my legs that
I cowped upon the top of him. A proud man was my father that day,
God rest him! and I think he had the cause. I’ll never can deny
but what Robin was something of a piper," he added; "but as for
James More, the deil guide him for me!"</p>

<p>"One thing we have to consider," said I. "Was Charles Stewart
right or wrong? Is it only me they’re after, or the pair of us?"</p>

<p>"And what’s your ain opinion, you that’s a man of so much experience?"
said he.</p>

<p>"It passes me," said I.</p>

<p>"And me too," says Alan. "Do ye think this lass would keep her
word to ye?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I do that," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, there’s nae telling," said he. "And anyway, that’s over
and done: he’ll be joined to the rest of them lang syne."</p>

<p>"How many would ye think there would be of them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That depends," said Alan. "If it was only you, they would likely
send two-three lively, brisk young birkies, and if they thought
that I was to appear in the employ, I daresay ten or twelve,"
said he.</p>

<p>It was no use, I gave a little crack of laughter.</p>

<p>"And I think your own two eyes will have seen me drive that number,
or the double of it, nearer hand!" cries he.</p>

<p>"It matters the less," said I, "because I am well rid of them
for this time."</p>

<p>"Nae doubt that’s your opinion," said he; "but I wouldnae be
the least surprised if they were hunkering this wood. Ye see,
David man; they’ll be Hieland folk. There’ll be some Frasers,
I’m thinking, and some of the Gregara; and I would never deny
but what the both of them, and the Gregara in especial, were clever
experienced persons. A man kens little till he’s driven a spreagh
of neat cattle (say) ten miles through a throng lowland country
and the black soldiers maybe at his tail. It’s there that I learned
a great part of my penetration. And ye need nae tell me: it’s
better than war; which is the next best, however, though generally
rather a bauchle of a business. Now the Gregara have had grand
practice."</p>

<p>"No doubt that’s a branch of education that was left out with
me," said I.</p>

<p>"And I can see the marks of it upon ye constantly," said Alan.
"But that’s the strange thing about you folk of the college learning:
ye’re ignorat, and ye cannae see ’t. Wae’s me for my Greek and
Hebrew; but, man, I ken that I dinnae ken them—there’s the differ
of it. Now, here’s you. Ye lie on your wame a bittie in the bield
of this wood, and ye tell me that ye’ve cuist off these Frasers
and Macgregors. Why? <em>Because I couldnae see them</em>, says
you. Ye blockhead, that’s their livelihood."</p>

<p>"Take the worst of it," said I, "and what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"I am thinking of that same," said he. "We might twine. It wouldnae
be greatly to my taste; and forbye that, I see reasons against
it. First, it’s now unco dark, and it’s just humanly possible
we might give them the clean slip. If we keep together, we make
but the ae line of it; if we gang separate, we make twae of them:
the more likelihood to stave in upon some of these gentry of yours.
And then, second, if they keep the track of us, it may come to
a fecht for it yet, Davie; and then, I’ll confess I would be blythe
to have you at my oxter, and I think you would be none the worse
of having me at yours. So, by my way of it, we should creep out
of this wood no further gone than just the inside of next minute,
and hold away east for Gillane, where I’m to find my ship. It’ll
be like old days while it lasts, Davie; and (come the time) we’ll
have to think what you should be doing. I’m wae to leave ye here,
wanting me."</p>

<p>"Have with ye, then!" says I. "Do ye gang back where you were
stopping?"</p>

<p>"Deil a fear!" said Alan. "They were good folks to me, but I
think they would be a good deal disappointed if they saw my bonny
face again. For (the way times go) I am nae just what ye could
call a Walcome Guest. Which makes me the keener for your company,
Mr. David Balfour of the Shaws, and set ye up! For, leave aside
twa cracks here in the wood with Charlie Stewart, I have scarce
said black or white since the day we parted at Corstorphine."</p>

<p>With which he rose from his place, and we began to move quietly
eastward through the wood.</p>
