But this was not to be the only eventful conversation
which Mrs. Westmacott held that day, nor was the Admiral
the only person in the Wilderness who was destined to
find his opinions considerably changed.  Two neighboring
families, the Winslows from Anerley, and the
Cumberbatches from Gipsy Hill, had been invited to tennis
by Mrs. Westmacott, and the lawn was gay in the evening
with the blazers of the young men and the bright dresses
of the girls.  To the older people, sitting round in
their wicker-work garden chairs, the darting, stooping,
springing white figures, the sweep of skirts, and twinkle
of canvas shoes, the click of the rackets and sharp whiz
of the balls, with the continual "fifteen love--fifteen
all!" of the marker, made up a merry and exhilarating
scene.  To see their sons and daughters so flushed and
healthy and happy, gave them also a reflected glow,
and it was hard to say who had most pleasure from the
game, those who played or those who watched.
<P>
Mrs. Westmacott had just finished a set when she
caught a glimpse of Clara Walker sitting alone at the
farther end of the ground.  She ran down the court,
cleared the net to the amazement of the visitors, and
seated herself beside her.  Clara's reserved and refined
nature shrank somewhat from the boisterous frankness and
strange manners of the widow, and yet her feminine
instinct told her that beneath all her peculiarities
there lay much that was good and noble.  She smiled up at
her, therefore, and nodded a greeting.
<P>
"Why aren't you playing, then?  Don't, for goodness'
sake, begin to be languid and young ladyish!  When you
give up active sports you give up youth."
<P>
"I have played a set, Mrs. Westmacott."
<P>
"That's right, my dear." She sat down beside her, and
tapped her upon the arm with her tennis racket.  "I like
you, my dear, and I am going to call you Clara.  You are
not as aggressive as I should wish, Clara, but still I
like you very much.  Self-sacrifice is all very well, you
know, but we have had rather too much of it on our side,
and should like to see a little on the other.  What do
you think of my nephew Charles?"
<P>
The question was so sudden and unexpected that Clara
gave quite a jump in her chair.  "I--I--I hardly ever
have thought of your nephew Charles."
<P>
"No?  Oh, you must think him well over, for I want to
speak to you about him."
<P>
"To me?  But why?"
<P>
"It seemed to me most delicate.  You see, Clara, the
matter stands in this way.  It is quite possible that I
may soon find myself in a completely new sphere of life,
which will involve fresh duties and make it impossible
for me to keep up a household which Charles can share."
<P>
Clara stared.  Did this mean that she was about to
marry again?  What else could it point to?
<P>
"Therefore Charles must have a household of his own. 
That is obvious.  Now, I don't approve of bachelor
establishments.  Do you?"
<P>
"Really, Mrs. Westmacott, I have never thought of the
matter."
<P>
"Oh, you little sly puss!  Was there ever a girl who
never thought of the matter?  I think that a young man of
six-and-twenty ought to be married."
<P>
Clara felt very uncomfortable.  The awful thought had
come upon her that this ambassadress had come to her as
a proxy with a proposal of marriage.  But how could that
be?  She had not spoken more than three or four times
with her nephew, and knew nothing more of him than he had
told her on the evening before.  It was impossible, then. 
And yet what could his aunt mean by this discussion of
his private affairs?
<P>
"Do you not think yourself," she persisted, "that a
young man of six-and-twenty is better married?"
<P>
"I should think that he is old enough to decide for
himself."
<P>
"Yes, yes.  He has done so.  But Charles is just a
little shy, just a little slow in expressing himself.  I
thought that I would pave the way for him.  Two women can
arrange these things so much better.  Men sometimes have
a difficulty in making themselves clear."
<P>
"I really hardly follow you, Mrs. Westmacott," cried
Clara in despair.
<P>
"He has no profession.  But he has nice tastes.  He
reads Browning every night.  And he is most amazingly
strong.  When he was younger we used to put on the gloves
together, but I cannot persuade him to now, for he says
he cannot play light enough.  I should allow him five
hundred, which should be enough at first."
<P>
"My dear Mrs. Westmacott," cried Clara, "I assure you
that I have not the least idea what it is that you are
talking of."
<P>
"Do you think your sister Ida would have my nephew
Charles?"
<P>
Her sister Ida?  Quite a little thrill of relief and
of pleasure ran through her at the thought.  Ida and
Charles Westmacott.  She had never thought of it.  And
yet they had been a good deal together.  They had played
tennis.  They had shared the tandem tricycle.  Again came
the thrill of joy, and close at its heels the cold
questionings of conscience.  Why this joy?  What was the
real source of it?  Was it that deep down, somewhere
pushed back in the black recesses of the soul, there was
the thought lurking that if Charles prospered in his
wooing then Harold Denver would still be free?  How mean,
how unmaidenly, how unsisterly the thought!  She crushed
it down and thrust it aside, but still it would push up
its wicked little head.  She crimsoned with shame at her
own baseness, as she turned once more to her companion.
<P>
"I really do not know," she said.
<P>
"She is not engaged?"
<P>
"Not that I know of."
<P>
"You speak hesitatingly."
<P>
"Because I am not sure.  But he may ask.  She cannot
but be flattered."
<P>
"Quite so.  I tell him that it is the most practical
compliment which a man can pay to a woman.  He is a
little shy, but when he sets himself to do it he will
do it.  He is very much in love with her, I assure
you.  These little lively people always do attract
the slow and heavy ones, which is nature's device for the
neutralizing of bores.  But they are all going in.  I
think if you will allow me that I will just take the
opportunity to tell him that, as far as you know, there
is no positive obstacle in the way."
<P>
"As far as I know, "Clara repeated, as the widow
moved away to where the players were grouped round the
net, or sauntering slowly towards the house.  She rose to
follow her, but her head was in a whirl with new
thoughts, and she sat down again.  Which would be best
for Ida, Harold or Charles?  She thought it over with as
much solicitude as a mother who plans for her only child. 
Harold had seemed to her to be in many ways the noblest
and the best young man whom she had known.  If ever she
was to love a man it would be such a man as that.  But
she must not think of herself.  She had reason to believe
that both these men loved her sister.  Which would be the
best for her?  But perhaps the matter was already
decided.  She could not forget the scrap of conversation
which she had heard the night before, nor the secret
which her sister had refused to confide to her.  If Ida
would not tell her, there was but one person who could. 
She raised her eyes and there was Harold Denver
standing before her.
<P>
"You were lost in your thoughts," said he, smiling. 
"I hope that they were pleasant ones."
<P>
"Oh, I was planning," said she, rising.  "It seems
rather a waste of time as a rule, for things have a way
of working themselves out just as you least expect."
<P>
"What were you planning, then?"
<P>
"The future."
<P>
"Whose?"
<P>
"Oh, my own and Ida's."
<P>
"And was I included in your joint futures?
<P>
"I hope all our friends were included."
<P>
"Don't go in," said he, as she began to move slowly
towards the house.  "I wanted to have a word.  Let us
stroll up and down the lawn.  Perhaps you are cold.  If
you are, I could bring you out a shawl."
<P>
"Oh, no, I am not cold."
<P>
"I was speaking to your sister Ida last night." She
noticed that there was a slight quiver in his voice, and,
glancing up at his dark, clear-cut face, she saw that he
was very grave.  She felt that it was settled, that he
had come to ask her for her sister's hand.
<P>
"She is a charming girl," said he, after a pause.
<P>
"Indeed she is," cried Clara warmly.  "And no one who
has not lived with her and known her intimately can
tell how charming and good she is.  She is like a sunbeam
in the house."
<P>
"No one who was not good could be so absolutely happy
as she seems to be.  Heaven's last gift, I think, is a
mind so pure and a spirit so high that it is unable even
to see what is impure and evil in the world around us. 
For as long as we can see it, how can we be truly happy?"
<P>
"She has a deeper side also.  She does not turn it to
the world, and it is not natural that she should, for she
is very young.  But she thinks, and has aspirations of
her own."
<P>
"You cannot admire her more than I do.  Indeed, Miss
Walker, I only ask to be brought into nearer relationship
with her, and to feel that there is a permanent bond
between us."
<P>
It had come at last.  For a moment her heart was
numbed within her, and then a flood of sisterly love
carried all before it.  Down with that dark thought which
would still try to raise its unhallowed head!  She turned
to Harold with sparkling eyes and words of pleasure upon
her lips.
<P>
"I should wish to be near and dear to both of you,"
said he, as he took her hand.  "I should wish Ida to be
my sister, and you my wife."
<P>
She said nothing.  She only stood looking at him with
parted lips and great, dark, questioning eyes.  The
lawn had vanished away, the sloping gardens, the brick
villas, the darkening sky with half a pale moon beginning
to show over the chimney-tops.  All was gone, and she was
only conscious of a dark, earnest, pleading face, and of
a voice, far away, disconnected from herself, the voice
of a man telling a woman how he loved her.  He was
unhappy, said the voice, his life was a void; there was
but one thing that could save him; he had come to the
parting of the ways, here lay happiness and honor, and
all that was high and noble; there lay the soul-killing
round, the lonely life, the base pursuit of money, the
sordid, selfish aims.  He needed but the hand of the
woman that he loved to lead him into the better path. 
And how he loved her his life would show.  He loved her
for her sweetness, for her womanliness, for her strength. 
He had need of her.  Would she not come to him?  And then
of a sudden as she listened it came home to her that the
man was Harold Denver, and that she was the woman, and
that all God's work was very beautiful--the green sward
beneath her feet, the rustling leaves, the long orange
slashes in the western sky.  She spoke; she scarce knew
what the broken words were, but she saw the light of joy
shine out on his face, and her hand was still in his as
they wandered amid the twilight.  They said no more
now, but only wandered and felt each other's presence. 
All was fresh around them, familiar and yet new, tinged
with the beauty of their new-found happiness.
<P>
"Did you not know it before?" he asked.  "I did not
dare to think it."
<P>
"What a mask of ice I must wear!  How could a man
feel as I have done without showing it?  Your sister at
least knew."
<P>
"Ida!"
<P>
"It was last night.  She began to praise you, I said
what I felt, and then in an instant it was all out."
<P>
"But what could you--what could you see in me?  Oh,
I do pray that you may not repent it!"  The gentle heart
was ruffled amid its joy by the thought of its own
unworthiness.
<P>
"Repent it!  I feel that I am a saved man.  You do
not know how degrading this city life is, how debasing,
and yet how absorbing.  Money for ever clinks in your
ear.  You can think of nothing else.  From the bottom of
my heart I hate it, and yet how can I draw back without
bringing grief to my dear old father?  There was but one
way in which I could defy the taint, and that was by
having a home influence so pure and so high that it may
brace me up against all that draws me down.  I have felt
that influence already.  I know that when I am talking to
you I am a better man.  It is you who, must go with
me through life, or I must walk for ever alone."
<P>
"Oh, Harold, I am so happy!"  Still they wandered
amid the darkening shadows, while one by one the stars
peeped out in the blue black sky above them.  At last a
chill night wind blew up from the east, and brought them
back to the realities of life.
<P>
"You must go in.  You will be cold."
<P>
"My father will wonder where I am.  Shall I say
anything to him?"
<P>
"If you like, my darling.  Or I will in the morning. 
I must tell my mother to-night.  I know how delighted she
will be."
<P>
"I do hope so."
<P>
"Let me take you up the garden path.  It is so dark. 
Your lamp is not lit yet.  There is the window.  Till
to-morrow, then, dearest."
<P>
"Till to-morrow, Harold."
<P>
"My own darling!"  He stooped, and their lips met for
the first time.  Then, as she pushed open the folding
windows she heard his quick, firm step as it passed down
the graveled path.  A lamp was lit as she entered the
room, and there was Ida, dancing about like a mischievous
little fairy in front of her.
<P>
"And have you anything to tell me?" she asked, with
a solemn face.  Then, suddenly throwing her arms round
her sister's neck, "Oh, you dear, dear old Clara!  I am
so pleased.  I am so pleased."
