<p>Two weeks after Joan left Riggan, she entered the village of Ashley-Wold
on foot. With the exception of a few miles here and there, when a
friendly wagoner had offered her a lift, she had made all her journey in
this manner. She had met with discouragement and disappointment. She had
not fancied that it would be an easy matter to find work, though she
had expressed no doubt to Anice, but it was even a more difficult matter
than she had imagined. At some places work was not to be had, in others
the fact that she was an utter stranger went against her.
</p>
<p>It was evening when she came to Ashley-Wold; the rain was falling soft
and slowly, and the air was chill. She was cold, and faint with hunger.
The firelight that shone through the cottage windows brought to her an
acute sense of her bodily weariness through its suggestion of rest and
cheerfulness. The few passers-by--principally men and women returning
from their daily labor--glanced at her curiously.
</p><p>She had held to the letter as a last resource. When she could not help
herself she would ask for assistance, but not until then. Still she had
always turned her face toward Ashley-Wold, Now she meant to go to Mrs.
Galloway and deliver the letter.
</p><p>Upon entering the village she had stopped and asked a farmer for
directions. He had stared at her at first, hardly comprehending her
northern dialect, but had finally understood and pointed out the house,
whose gables could be seen from the road-side.
</p><p>So Joan made her way toward it through the evening rain and mist. It
was a pretty place, with a quaint picturesqueness. A hedge, which was
a marvel of trimness, surrounded the garden, ivy clung to the walls and
gables, and fancifully clipped box and other evergreens made a modest
greenery about it, winter though it was. At her first glance at this
garden Joan felt something familiar in it. Perhaps Anice herself had
planned some portion of it. Joan paused a moment and stood looking over
the hedge.
</p><p>Mrs. Galloway, sitting at her work-table near the window, had found her
attention attracted a few moments before by a tall young woman coming
down the road which passed on one side of the hedge.
</p><p>“There is something a little remarkable about her,” she said. “She
certainly does not belong to Ashley-Wold.”
</p><p>Then Joan stopped by the hedge and she saw her face and uttered a low
exclamation of surprise at its beauty. She drew nearer to the window and
looked out at her.
</p><p>“She must be very cold,” said Mrs. Galloway. “She looks as if she had
made a long journey. I will send Hollis to her.”
</p><p>A few minutes later there tripped down the garden-walk a trimly attired
young housemaid.
</p><p>The mistress had seen her from the window and thought she looked cold
and tired. Would she come into the house to rest?
</p><p>Joan answered with a tinge of color on her cheek. She felt a little like
a beggar.
</p><p>“Thank yo'; I'll come,” she said. “If th' mistress is Mrs. Galloway, I
ha' a letter fur her fro' Lancashire.”
</p><p>Mrs. Galloway met them on the threshold.
</p><p>“The young woman, ma'am,” said the servant, “has a letter from
Lancashire.”
</p><p>“From Lancashire!” said Mrs. Galloway.
</p><p>“Fro' Riggan, mistress,” said Joan. “Fro' Miss Anice. I'm Joan Lowrie.”
</p><p>That Joan Lowrie was a name familiar to her was evident by the change in
Mrs. Galloway's face. A faint flush of pleasure warmed it, and she spoke
quickly.
</p><p>“Joan Lowrie!” she said. “My dear child's friend! Then I know you very
well. Come into the room, my dear.”
</p><p>She led her into the room and closed the door.
</p><p>“You are very cold and your shawl is wet,” laying a kind hand upon it.
“Give it to me, and take a seat by the fire. You must warm yourself
thoroughly and have a cup of tea,” she said, “and then I will begin to
ask questions.”
</p><p>There was a wide, low-seated, low-armed, soft-cushioned chair at one
side of the fire, and in this chair she had made Joan seat herself. The
sudden change from the chill dampness of the winter day to the exquisite
relief and rest, almost overcame the girl. She was deadly pale when Mrs.
Galloway ceased, and her lips trembled; she tried to speak, and for a
moment could not; tears rushed to her eyes and stood in them. But she
managed to answer at last.
</p><p>“I beg yo're pardon,” she said. “Yo' ha' no need to moind me. Th' warmth
has made me a bit faint, that's aw. I've noan been used to it lately.”
</p><p>Mrs. Galloway came and stood near her.
</p><p>“I am sorry to hear that, my dear,” she said.
</p><p>“Yo're very kind, ma'am,” Joan answered.
</p><p>She drew the letter from her dress and handed it to her.
</p><p>“I getten that fro' Miss Anice the neet I left Riggan,” she said.
</p><p>When the tea was brought in and Joan had sat down, the old lady read the
letter.
</p><p>“<u>Keep her with you if you can. Give her the help she needs most. She
has had a hard life, and wants to forget it.</u>”
</p><p>“Now, I wonder,” said Mrs. Galloway to herself, “what the help is that
she needs most?”
</p><p>The rare beauty of the face impressed her as it invariably impressed
strangers, but she looked beneath the surface and saw something more in
it than its beauty. She saw its sadness, its resolution.
</p><p>When Joan rose from the table, the old lady was still standing with the
letter in her hand. She folded it and spoke to her.
</p><p>“If you are sufficiently rested, I should like you to sit down and talk
to me a little. I want to speak to you about your plans.”
</p><p>“Then,” said Joan, “happen I'd better tell yo' at th' start as I ha'
none.”
</p><p>Mrs. Galloway put her hand upon her shoulder.
</p><p>“Then,” she returned, “that is all the better for me, for I have in my
mind one of my own. You would like to find work to help you----”
</p><p>“I <u>mun</u> find work,” Joan interrupted, “or starve.”
</p><p>“Of any kind?” questioningly.
</p><p>“I ha' worked at th' pit's mouth aw my life,” said Joan. “I need na be
dainty, yo' see.”
</p><p>Mrs. Galloway smoothed the back of the small, withered hand upon her
knee with the palm of the other.
</p><p>“Then, perhaps,” she said slowly, “you will not refuse to accept my
offer and stay here--with me?”
</p><p>“Wi' yo'?” Joan exclaimed. “I am an old woman, you see,” Mrs. Galloway
answered. “I have lived in Ashley-Wold all my life, and have, as it
were, accumulated duties, and now as the years go by, I do not find it
so easy to perform them as I used to. I need a companion who is young
and strong, and quick to understand the wants of those who suffer. Will
you stay here and help <u>me?</u>”
</p><p>“Wi' yo'?” said Joan again. “Nay,” she cried; “nay--that is not fur me.
I am na fit.”
</p><p>On her way to her chamber some hours later Mrs. Galloway stopped at the
room which had been Anice's, and looked in upon her guest. But Joan was
not asleep, as she had hoped to find her. She stood at the fireside,
looking into the blaze.
</p><p>“Will you come here a minnit?” she said.
</p><p>She looked haggard and wearied, but the eyes she raised to her hostess
were resolute.
</p><p>“Theer's summat as I ha' held back fro' sayin' to yo',” she said, “an'
th' more I think on it, th' more I see as I mun tell yo' if I mean
to begin fair an' clear. I ha' a trouble as I'm fain to hide; it's
a trouble as I ha' fowt wi' an' ha' na helped mysen agen. It's na a
shame,” straightening herself; “it's a trouble such as ony woman might
bear an' be honest. I coom away fro' Riggan to be out o' th' way on
it--not to forget it, for I conna--but so as I should na be so near
to--to th' hurt on it.”
</p><p>“I do not need another word,” Mrs. Galloway answered. “If you had chosen
to keep it a secret, it would have been your own secret as long as you
chose that it should be so. There is nothing more you need? Very well
Good-night, my dear!”
