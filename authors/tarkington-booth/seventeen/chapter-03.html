<p>"OH <em>WILL&mdash;EE!"</em></p>

<p>Thus a shrill voice, to his ears hideously different from that
other, interrupted and dispersed his visions. Little Jane, his
ten-year-old sister, stood upon the front porch, the door open
behind her, and in her hand she held a large slab of bread-and-butter
covered with apple sauce and powdered sugar. Evidence that she
had sampled this compound was upon her cheeks, and to her brother
she was a repulsive sight.</p>

<p>"Will-ee!" she shrilled. "Look! <em>GOOD!" </em>And to emphasize
the adjective she indelicately patted the region of her body in
which she believed her stomach to be located. "There's a slice
for you on the dining-room table," she informed him, joyously.</p>

<p>Outraged, he entered the house without a word to her, and, proceeding
to the dining-room, laid hands upon the slice she had mentioned,
but declined to eat it in Jane's company. He was in an exalted
mood, and though in no condition of mind or body would he refuse
food of almost any kind, Jane was an intrusion he could not suffer
at this time.</p>

<p>He carried the refection to his own room and, locking the door,
sat down to eat, while, even as he ate, the spell that was upon
him deepened in intensity.</p>

<p>"Oh, eyes!" he whispered, softly, in that cool privacy and shelter
from the world. "Oh, eyes of blue!"</p>

<p>The mirror of a dressing-table sent him the reflection of his
own eyes, which also were blue; and he gazed upon them and upon
the rest of his image the while he ate his bread-and-butter and
apple sauce and sugar. Thus, watching himself eat, he continued
to stare dreamily at the mirror until the bread-and-butter and
apple sauce and sugar had disappeared, whereupon he rose and approached
the dressing-table to study himself at greater advantage.</p>

<p>He assumed as repulsive an expression as he could command, at
the same time making the kingly gesture of one who repels unwelcome
attentions; and it is beyond doubt that he was thus acting a little
scene of indifference. Other symbolic dramas followed, though
an invisible observer might have been puzzled for a key to some
of them. One, however, would have proved easily intelligible:
his expression having altered to a look of pity and contrition,
he turned from the mirror, and, walking slowly to a chair across
the room, used his right hand in a peculiar manner, seeming to
stroke the air at a point about ten inches above the back of the
chair. "There, there, little girl," he said in a low, gentle voice.
"I didn't know you cared!"</p>

<p>Then, with a rather abrupt dismissal of this theme, he returned
to the mirror and, after a questioning scrutiny, nodded solemnly,
forming with his lips the words, "The real thing&mdash;the real thing
at last!" He meant that, after many imitations had imposed upon
him, Love&mdash;the real thing&mdash;had come to him in the end. And as
he turned away he murmured, "And even her name&mdash;unknown!"</p>

<p>This evidently was a thought that continued to occupy him, for
he walked up and down the room, frowning; but suddenly his brow
cleared and his eye lit with purpose. Seating himself at a small
writing-table by the window, he proceeded to express his personality&mdash;though
with considerable labor&mdash;in something which he did not doubt to
be a poem.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour having sufficed for its completion,
including "rewriting and polish," he solemnly signed it, and then
read it several times in a state of hushed astonishment. He had
never dreamed that he could do anything like this.</p>

<em>MILADY<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I </em>do not know her name<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it would be the same<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<em>WILLIAM SYLVANUS BAXTER, </em>Esq., July 14

</p>
</div>
<p>It is impossible to say how many times he might have read the
poem over, always with increasing amazement at his new-found powers,
had he not been interrupted by the odious voice of Jane.</p>

<p>"Will&mdash;ee!"</p>

<p>To William, in his high and lonely mood, this piercing summons
brought an actual shudder, and the very thought of Jane (with
tokens of apple sauce and sugar still upon her cheek, probably)
seemed a kind of sacrilege. He fiercely swore his favorite oath,
acquired from the hero of a work of fiction he admired, "Ye gods!"
and concealed his poem in the drawer of the writing-table, for
Jane's footsteps were approaching his door.</p>

<p>"Will&mdash;ee! Mamma wants you." She tried the handle of the door.</p>

<p>"G'way!" he said.</p>

<p>"Will&mdash;ee!" Jane hammered upon the door with her fist. "Will&mdash;ee!"</p>

<p>"What you want?" he shouted.</p>

<p>Jane explained, certain pauses indicating that her attention
was partially diverted to another slice of bread-and-butter and
apple sauce and sugar. "Will&mdash;ee, mamma wants you&mdash;wants you to
go help Genesis bring some wash-tubs home and a tin clo'es-boiler&mdash;from
the second-hand man's store."</p>

<p>"<em>WHAT</em>!"</p>

<p>Jane repeated the outrageous message, adding, "She wants you
to hurry&mdash;and I got some more bread-and-butter and apple sauce
and sugar for comin' to tell you."</p>

<p>William left no doubt in Jane's mind about his attitude in reference
to the whole matter. His refusal was direct and infuriated, but,
in the midst of a multitude of plain statements which he was making,
there was a decisive tapping upon the door at a point higher than
Jane could reach, and his mother's voice interrupted:</p>

<p>"Hush, Willie! Open the door, please."</p>

<p>He obeyed furiously, and Mrs. Baxter walked in with a deprecating
air, while Jane followed, so profoundly interested that, until
almost the close of the interview, she held her bread-and-butter
and apple sauce and sugar at a sort of way-station on its journey
to her mouth.</p>

<p>"That's a nice thing to ask me to do!" stormed the unfortunate
William. "Ye gods! Do you think Joe Bullitt's mother would dare
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, dearie!" Mrs. Baxter begged, pacifically. "I just want
to explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Explain'! Ye gods!"</p>

<p>"Now, now, just a minute, Willie!" she said. "What I wanted to
explain was why it's necessary for you to go with Genesis for
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never!" he shouted. "Never! You expect me to walk through the
public streets with that awful-lookin' old nigger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Genesis isn't old," she managed to interpolate. "He&mdash;"</p>

<p>But her frantic son disregarded her. "Second-hand wash-tubs!"
he vociferated. "And tin clothes-boilers! <em>THAT'S </em>what
you want your <em>SON </em>to carry through the public streets
in broad daylight! Ye gods!"</p>

<p>"Well, there isn't anybody else," she said. "Please don't rave
so, Willie, and say 'Ye gods' so much; it really isn't nice. I'm
sure nobody 'll notice you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Nobody'!" His voice cracked in anguish. "Oh no! Nobody except
the whole town! <em>WHY, </em>when there's anything disgusting
has to be done in this family&mdash;why do <em>I</em> always have to
be the one? Why can't Genesis bring the second-hand wash-tubs
without ME? Why can't the second-hand store deliver 'em? Why can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's what I want to tell you," she interposed, hurriedly,
and as the youth lifted his arms on high in a gesture of ultimate
despair, and then threw himself miserably into a chair, she obtained
the floor. "The second-hand store doesn't deliver things," she
said. "I bought them at an auction, and it's going out of business,
and they have to be taken away before half past four this afternoon.
Genesis can't bring them in the wheelbarrow, because, he says,
the wheel is broken, and he says he can't possibly carry two tubs
and a wash-boiler himself; and he can't make two trips because
it's a mile and a half, and I don't like to ask him, anyway; and
it would take too long, because he has to get back and finish
cutting the grass before your papa gets home this evening. Papa
said he <em>HAD </em>to! Now, I don't like to ask you, but it
really isn't much. You and Genesis can just slip up there and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Slip!" moaned William. "'Just <em>SLIP </em>up there'! Ye gods!"</p>

<p>"Genesis is waiting on the back porch," she said. "Really it
isn't worth your making all this fuss about."</p>

<p>"Oh no!" he returned, with plaintive satire. "It's nothing! Nothing
at all!"</p>

<p>"Why, <em>I</em> shouldn't mind it," she said; briskly, "if I
had the time. In fact, I'll have to, if you won't."</p>

<p>"Ye gods!" He clasped his head in his hands, crushed, for he
knew that the curse was upon him and he must go. "Ye gods!"</p>

<p>And then, as he stamped to the door, his tragic eye fell upon
Jane, and he emitted a final cry of pain:</p>

<p>"Can't you <em>EVER </em>wash your face?" he shouted.</p>
