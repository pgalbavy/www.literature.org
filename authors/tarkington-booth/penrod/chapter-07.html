<p>Next day, Penrod acquired a dime by a simple and antique process
which was without doubt sometimes practised by the boys of Babylon.
When the teacher of his class in Sunday-school requested the weekly
contribution, Penrod, fumbling honestly (at first) in the wrong
pockets, managed to look so embarrassed that the gentle lady told
him not to mind, and said she was often forgetful herself. She
was so sweet about it that, looking into the future, Penrod began
to feel confident of a small but regular income.</p>

<p>At the close of the afternoon services he did not go home, but
proceeded to squander the funds just withheld from China upon
an orgy of the most pungently forbidden description. In a Drug
Emporium, near the church, he purchased a five-cent sack of candy
consisting for the most part of the heavily flavoured hoofs of
horned cattle, but undeniably substantial, and so generously capable
of resisting solution that the purchaser must needs be avaricious
beyond reason who did not realize his money's worth.</p>

<p>Equipped with this collation, Penrod contributed his remaining
nickel to a picture show, countenanced upon the seventh day by
the legal but not the moral authorities. Here, in cozy darkness,
he placidly insulted his liver with jaw-breaker upon jaw-breaker
from the paper sack, and in a surfeit of content watched the silent
actors on the screen.</p>

<p>One film made a lasting impression upon him. It depicted with
relentless pathos the drunkard's progress; beginning with his
conversion to beer in the company of loose travelling men; pursuing
him through an inexplicable lapse into evening clothes and the
society of some remarkably painful ladies, next, exhibiting the
effects of alcohol on the victim's domestic disposition, the unfortunate
man was seen in the act of striking his wife and, subsequently,
his pleading baby daughter with an abnormally heavy walking-stick.
Their flight&mdash;through the snow&mdash;to seek the protection of a relative
was shown, and finally, the drunkard's picturesque behaviour at
the portals of a madhouse.</p>

<p>So fascinated was Penrod that he postponed his departure until
this film came round again, by which time he had finished his
unnatural repast and almost, but not quite, decided against following
the profession of a drunkard when he grew up.</p>

<p>Emerging, satiated, from the theatre, a public timepiece before
a jeweller's shop confronted him with an unexpected dial and imminent
perplexities. How was he to explain at home these hours of dalliance?
There was a steadfast rule that he return direct from Sunday-school;
and Sunday rules were important, because on that day there was
his father, always at home and at hand, perilously ready for action.
One of the hardest conditions of boyhood is the almost continuous
strain put upon the powers of invention by the constant and harassing
necessity for explanations of every natural act.</p>

<p>Proceeding homeward through the deepening twilight as rapidly
as possible, at a gait half skip and half canter, Penrod made
up his mind in what manner he would account for his long delay,
and, as he drew nearer, rehearsed in words the opening passage
of his defence.</p>

<p>"Now see here," he determined to begin; "I do not wished to be
blamed for things I couldn't help, nor any other boy. I was going
along the street by a cottage and a lady put her head out of the
window and said her husband was drunk and whipping her and her
little girl, and she asked me wouldn't I come in and help hold
him. So I went in and tried to get hold of this drunken lady's
husband where he was whipping their baby daughter, but he wouldn't
pay any attention, and I <em>TOLD </em>her I ought to be getting
home, but she kep' on askin' me to stay&#11834;"</p>

<p>At this point he reached the corner of his own yard, where a
coincidence not only checked the rehearsal of his eloquence but
happily obviated all occasion for it. A cab from the station drew
up in front of the gate, and there descended a troubled lady in
black and a fragile little girl about three. Mrs. Schofield rushed
from the house and enfolded both in hospitable arms.</p>

<p>They were Penrod's Aunt Clara and cousin, also Clara, from Dayton,
Illinois, and in the flurry of their arrival everybody forgot
to put Penrod to the question. It is doubtful, however, if he
felt any relief; there may have been even a slight, unconscious
disappointment not altogether dissimilar to that of an actor deprived
of a good part.</p>

<p>In the course of some really necessary preparations for dinner
he stepped from the bathroom into the pink-and-white bedchamber
of his sister, and addressed her rather thickly through a towel.</p>

<p>"When'd mamma find out Aunt Clara and Cousin Clara were coming?"</p>

<p>"Not till she saw them from the window. She just happened to
look out as they drove up. Aunt Clara telegraphed this morning,
but it wasn't delivered."</p>

<p>"How long they goin' to stay?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Penrod ceased to rub his shining face, and thoughtfully tossed
the towel through the bathroom door. "Uncle John won't try to
make 'em come back home, I guess, will he?" (Uncle John was Aunt
Clara's husband, a successful manufacturer of stoves, and his
lifelong regret was that he had not entered the Baptist ministry.)
"He'll let 'em stay here quietly, won't he?"</p>

<p>"What <em>ARE </em>you talking about?" demanded Margaret, turning
from her mirror. "Uncle John sent them here. Why shouldn't he
let them stay?"</p>

<p>Penrod looked crestfallen. "Then he hasn't taken to drink?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" She emphasized the denial with a pretty peal
of soprano laughter.</p>

<p>"Then why," asked her brother gloomily, "why did Aunt Clara look
so worried when she got here?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious! Don't people worry about anything except somebody's
drinking? Where did you get such an idea?"</p>

<p>"Well," he persisted, "you don't <em>KNOW </em>it ain't that."</p>

<p>She laughed again, wholeheartedly. "Poor Uncle John! He won't
even allow grape juice or ginger ale in his house. They came because
they were afraid little Clara might catch the measles. She's very
delicate, and there's such an epidemic of measles among the children
over in Dayton the schools had to be closed. Uncle John got so
worried that last night he dreamed about it; and this morning
he couldn't stand it any longer and packed them off over here,
though he thinks its wicked to travel on Sunday. And Aunt Clara
was worried when she got here because they'd forgotten to check
her trunk and it will have to be sent by express. Now what in
the name of the common sense put it into your head that Uncle
John had taken to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing." He turned lifelessly away and went downstairs,
a new-born hope dying in his bosom. Life seems so needlessly dull
sometimes.</p>
