<p>The first thing I saw down there was the upper part of a man’s
body projecting backward, as it were, from one of the doors at
the foot of the stairs. His eyes looked at me very wide and still.
In one hand he held a dinner plate, in the other a cloth.</p>

<p>"I am your new Captain," I said quietly.</p>

<p>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, he had got rid of the
plate and the cloth and jumped to open the cabin door. As soon
as I passed into the saloon he vanished, but only to reappear
instantly, buttoning up a jacket he had put on with the swiftness
of a "quick-change" artist.</p>

<p>"Where’s the chief mate?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In the hold, I think, sir. I saw him go down the after-hatch
ten minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Tell him I am on board."</p>

<p>The mahogany table under the skylight shone in the twilight like
a dark pool of water. The sideboard, surmounted by a wide looking-glass
in an ormulu frame, had a marble top. It bore a pair of silver-plated
lamps and some other pieces&mdash;obviously a harbour display. The
saloon itself was panelled in two kinds of wood in the excellent
simple taste prevailing when the ship was built.</p>

<p>I sat down in the armchair at the head of the table&mdash;the captain’s
chair, with a small tell-tale compass swung above it&mdash;a mute reminder
of unremitting vigilance.</p>

<p>A succession of men had sat in that chair. I became aware of
that thought suddenly, vividly, as though each had left a little
of himself between the four walls of these ornate bulkheads; as
if a sort of composite soul, the soul of command, had whispered
suddenly to mine of long days at sea and of anxious moments.</p>

<p>"You, too!" it seemed to say, "you, too, shall taste of that
peace and that unrest in a searching intimacy with your own self&mdash;obscure
as we were and as supreme in the face of all the winds and all
the seas, in an immensity that receives no impress, preserves
no memories, and keeps no reckoning of lives."</p>

<p>Deep within the tarnished ormulu frame, in the hot half-light
sifted through the awning, I saw my own face propped between my
hands. And I stared back at myself with the perfect detachment
of distance, rather with curiosity than with any other feeling,
except of some sympathy for this latest representative of what
for all intents and purposes was a dynasty, continuous not in
blood indeed, but in its experience, in its training, in its conception
of duty, and in the blessed simplicity of its traditional point
of view on life.</p>

<p>It struck me that this quietly staring man whom I was watching,
both as if he were myself and somebody else, was not exactly a
lonely figure. He had his place in a line of men whom he did not
know, of whom he had never heard; but who were fashioned by the
same influences, whose souls in relation to their humble life’s
work had no secrets for him.</p>

<p>Suddenly I perceived that there was another man in the saloon,
standing a little on one side and looking intently at me. The
chief mate. His long, red moustache determined the character of
his physiognomy, which struck me as pugnacious in (strange to
say) a ghastly sort of way.</p>

<p>How long had he been there looking at me, appraising me in my
unguarded day-dreaming state? I would have been more disconcerted
if, having the clock set in the top of the mirror-frame right
in front of me, I had not noticed that its long hand had hardly
moved at all.</p>

<p>I could not have been in that cabin more than two minutes altogether.
Say three. . . . So he could not have been watching me more than
a mere fraction of a minute, luckily. Still, I regretted the occurrence.</p>

<p>But I showed nothing of it as I rose leisurely (it had to be
leisurely) and greeted him with perfect friendliness.</p>

<p>There was something reluctant and at the same time attentive
in his bearing. His name was Burns. We left the cabin and went
round the ship together. His face in the full light of day appeared
very pale, meagre, even haggard. Somehow I had a delicacy as to
looking too often at him; his eyes, on the contrary, remained
fairly glued on my face. They were greenish and had an expectant
expression.</p>

<p>He answered all my questions readily enough, but my ear seemed
to catch a tone of unwillingness. The second officer, with three
or four hands, was busy forward. The mate mentioned his name and
I nodded to him in passing. He was very young. He struck me as
rather a cub.</p>

<p>When we returned below, I sat down on one end of a deep, semi-circular,
or, rather, semi-oval settee, upholstered in red plush. It extended
right across the whole after-end of the cabin. Mr. Burns motioned
to sit down, dropped into one of the swivel-chairs round the table,
and kept his eyes on me as persistently as ever, and with that
strange air as if all this were make-believe and he expected me
to get up, burst into a laugh, slap him on the back, and vanish
from the cabin.</p>

<p>There was an odd stress in the situation which began to make
me uncomfortable. I tried to react against this vague feeling.</p>

<p>"It’s only my inexperience," I thought.</p>

<p>In the face of that man, several years, I judged, older than
myself, I became aware of what I had left already behind me&mdash;my
youth. And that was indeed poor comfort. Youth is a fine thing,
a mighty power&mdash;as long as one does not think of it. I felt I
was becoming self-conscious. Almost against my will I assumed
a moody gravity. I said: "I see you have kept her in very good
order, Mr. Burns."</p>

<p>Directly I had uttered these words I asked myself angrily why
the deuce did I want to say that? Mr. Burns in answer had only
blinked at me. What on earth did he mean?</p>

<p>I fell back on a question which had been in my thoughts for a
long time&mdash;the most natural question on the lips of any seaman
whatever joining a ship. I voiced it (confound this self-consciousness)
in a degaged cheerful tone: "I suppose she can travel&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>Now a question like this might have been answered normally, either
in accents of apologetic sorrow or with a visibly suppressed pride,
in a "I don’t want to boast, but you shall see," sort of tone.
There are sailors, too, who would have been roughly outspoken:
"Lazy brute," or openly delighted: "She’s a flyer." Two ways,
if four manners.</p>

<p>But Mr. Burns found another way, a way of his own which had,
at all events, the merit of saving his breath, if no other.</p>

<p>Again he did not say anything. He only frowned. And it was an
angry frown. I waited. Nothing more came.</p>

<p>"What’s the matter? . . . Can’t you tell after being nearly two
years in the ship?" I addressed him sharply.</p>

<p>He looked as startled for a moment as though he had discovered
my presence only that very moment. But this passed off almost
at once. He put on an air of indifference. But I suppose he thought
it better to say something. He said that a ship needed, just like
a man, the chance to show the best she could do, and that this
ship had never had a chance since he had been on board of her.
Not that he could remember. The last captain. . . . He paused.</p>

<p>"Has he been so very unlucky?" I asked with frank incredulity.
Mr. Burns turned his eyes away from me. No, the late captain was
not an unlucky man. One couldn’t say that. But he had not seemed
to want to make use of his luck.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns&mdash;man of enigmatic moods&mdash;made this statement with an
inanimate face and staring wilfully at the rudder casing. The
statement itself was obscurely suggestive. I asked quietly:</p>

<p>"Where did he die?"</p>

<p>"In this saloon. Just where you are sitting now," answered Mr.
Burns.</p>

<p>I repressed a silly impulse to jump up; but upon the whole I
was relieved to hear that he had not died in the bed which was
now to be mine. I pointed out to the chief mate that what I really
wanted to know was where he had buried his late captain.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns said that it was at the entrance to the gulf. A roomy
grave; a sufficient answer. But the mate, overcoming visibly something
within him&mdash;something like a curious reluctance to believe in
my advent (as an irrevocable fact, at any rate), did not stop
at that&mdash;though, indeed, he may have wished to do so.</p>

<p>As a compromise with his feelings, I believe, he addressed himself
persistently to the rudder-casing, so that to me he had the appearance
of a man talking in solitude, a little unconsciously, however.</p>

<p>His tale was that at seven bells in the forenoon watch he had
all hands mustered on the quarterdeck and told them they had better
go down to say good-bye to the captain.</p>

<p>Those words, as if grudged to an intruding personage, were enough
for me to evoke vividly that strange ceremony: The bare-footed,
bare-headed seamen crowding shyly into that cabin, a small mob
pressed against that sideboard, uncomfortable rather than moved,
shirts open on sunburnt chests, weather-beaten faces, and all
staring at the dying man with the same grave and expectant expression.</p>

<p>"Was he conscious?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He didn’t speak, but he moved his eyes to look at them," said
the mate.</p>

<p>After waiting a moment, Mr. Burns motioned the crew to leave
the cabin, but he detained the two eldest men to stay with the
captain while he went on deck with his sextant to "take the sun."
It was getting toward noon and he was anxious to obtain a good
observation for latitude. When he returned below to put his sextant
away he found that the two men had retreated out into the lobby.
Through the open door he had a view of the captain lying easy
against the pillows. He had "passed away" while Mr. Burns was
taking this observation. As near noon as possible. He had hardly
changed his position.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns sighed, glanced at me inquisitively, as much as to
say, "Aren’t you going yet?" and then turned his thoughts from
his new captain back to the old, who, being dead, had no authority,
was not in anybody’s way, and was much easier to deal with.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns dealt with him at some length. He was a peculiar man&mdash;of
sixty-five about&mdash;iron gray, hard-faced, obstinate, and uncommunicative.
He used to keep the ship loafing at sea for inscrutable reasons.
Would come on deck at night sometimes, take some sail off her,
God only knows why or wherefore, then go below, shut himself up
in his cabin, and play on the violin for hours&mdash;till daybreak
perhaps. In fact, he spent most of his time day or night playing
the violin. That was when the fit took him. Very loud, too.</p>

<p>It came to this, that Mr. Burns mustered his courage one day
and remonstrated earnestly with the captain. Neither he nor the
second mate could get a wink of sleep in their watches below for
the noise. . . . And how could they be expected to keep awake
while on duty? He pleaded. The answer of that stern man was that
if he and the second mate didn’t like the noise, they were welcome
to pack up their traps and walk over the side. When this alternative
was offered the ship happened to be 600 miles from the nearest
land.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns at this point looked at me with an air of curiosity.
I began to think that my predecessor was a remarkably peculiar
old man.</p>

<p>But I had to hear stranger things yet. It came out that this
stern, grim, wind-tanned, rough, sea-salted, taciturn sailor of
sixty-five was not only an artist, but a lover as well. In Haiphong,
when they got there after a course of most unprofitable peregrinations
(during which the ship was nearly lost twice), he got himself,
in Mr. Burns’ own words, "mixed up" with some woman. Mr. Burns
had had no personal knowledge of that affair, but positive evidence
of it existed in the shape of a photograph taken in Haiphong.
Mr. Burns found it in one of the drawers in the captain’s room.</p>

<p>In due course I, too, saw that amazing human document (I even
threw it overboard later). There he sat, with his hands reposing
on his knees, bald, squat, gray, bristly, recalling a wild boar
somehow; and by his side towered an awful mature, white female
with rapacious nostrils and a cheaply ill-omened stare in her
enormous eyes. She was disguised in some semi-oriental, vulgar,
fancy costume. She resembled a low-class medium or one of those
women who tell fortunes by cards for half a crown. And yet she
was striking. A professional sorceress from the slums. It was
incomprehensible. There was something awful in the thought that
she was the last reflection of the world of passion for the fierce
soul which seemed to look at one out of the sardonically savage
face of that old seaman. However, I noticed that she was holding
some musical instrument&mdash;guitar or mandoline&mdash;in her hand. Perhaps
that was the secret of her sortilege.</p>

<p>For Mr. Burns that photograph explained why the unloaded ship
had kept sweltering at anchor for three weeks in a pestilential
hot harbour without air. They lay there and gasped. The captain,
appearing now and then on short visits, mumbled to Mr. Burns unlikely
tales about some letters he was waiting for.</p>

<p>Suddenly, after vanishing for a week, he came on board in the
middle of the night and took the ship out to sea with the first
break of dawn. Daylight showed him looking wild and ill. The mere
getting clear of the land took two days, and somehow or other
they bumped slightly on a reef. However, no leak developed, and
the captain, growling "no matter,"  informed Mr. Burns that he
had made up his mind to take the ship to Hong-Kong and drydock
her there.</p>

<p>At this Mr. Burns was plunged into despair. For indeed, to beat
up to Hong-Kong against a fierce monsoon, with a ship not sufficiently
ballasted and with her supply of water not completed, was an insane
project.</p>

<p>But the captain growled peremptorily, "Stick her at it," and
Mr. Burns, dismayed and enraged, stuck her at it, and kept her
at it, blowing away sails, straining the spars, exhausting the
crew&mdash;nearly maddened by the absolute conviction that the attempt
was impossible and was bound to end in some catastrophe.</p>

<p>Meantime the captain, shut up in his cabin and wedged in a corner
of his settee against the crazy bounding of the ship, played the
violin&mdash;or, at any rate, made continuous noise on it.</p>

<p>When he appeared on deck he would not speak and not always answer
when spoken to. It was obvious that he was ill in some mysterious
manner, and beginning to break up.</p>

<p>As the days went by the sounds of the violin became less and
less loud, till at last only a feeble scratching would meet Mr.
Burns’ ear as he stood in the saloon listening outside the door
of the captain’s state-room.</p>

<p>One afternoon in perfect desperation he burst into that room
and made such a scene, tearing his hair and shouting such horrid
imprecations that he cowed the contemptuous spirit of the sick
man. The water-tanks were low, they had not gained fifty miles
in a fortnight. She would never reach Hong-Kong.</p>

<p>It was like fighting desperately toward destruction for the ship
and the men. This was evident without argument. Mr. Burns, losing
all restraint, put his face close to his captain’s and fairly
yelled: "You, sir, are going out of the world. But I can’t wait
till you are dead before I put the helm up. You must do it yourself.
You must do it now!"</p>

<p>The man on the couch snarled in contempt. "So I am going out
of the world&mdash;am I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;you haven’t many days left in it," said Mr. Burns
calming down. "One can see it by your face."</p>

<p>"My face, eh? . . . Well, put up the helm and be damned to you."</p>

<p>Burns flew on deck, got the ship before the wind, then came down
again composed, but resolute.</p>

<p>"I’ve shaped a course for Pulo Condor, sir," he said. "When we
make it, if you are still with us, you’ll tell me into what port
you wish me to take the ship and I’ll do it."</p>

<p>The old man gave him a look of savage spite, and said those atrocious
words in deadly, slow tones.</p>

<p>"If I had my wish, neither the ship nor any of you would ever
reach a port. And I hope you won’t."</p>

<p>Mr. Burns was profoundly shocked. I believe he was positively
frightened at the time. It seems, however, that he managed to
produce such an effective laugh that it was the old man’s turn
to be frightened. He shrank within himself and turned his back
on him.</p>

<p>"And his head was not gone then," Mr. Burns assured me excitedly.
"He meant every word of it."</p>

<p>"Such was practically the late captain’s last speech. No connected
sentence passed his lips afterward. That night he used the last
of his strength to throw his fiddle over the side. No one had
actually seen him in the act, but after his death Mr. Burns couldn’t
find the thing anywhere. The empty case was very much in evidence,
but the fiddle was clearly not in the ship. And where else could
it have gone to but overboard?"</p>

<p>"Threw his violin overboard!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"He did," cried Mr. Burns excitedly. "And it’s my belief he would
have tried to take the ship down with him if it had been in human
power. He never meant her to see home again. He wouldn’t write
to his owners, he never wrote to his old wife, either&mdash;he wasn’t
going to. He had made up his mind to cut adrift from everything.
That’s what it was. He didn’t care for business, or freights,
or for making a passage&mdash;or anything. He meant to have gone wandering
about the world till he lost her with all hands."</p>

<p>Mr. Burns looked like a man who had escaped great danger. For
a little he would have exclaimed: "If it hadn’t been for me!"
And the transparent innocence of his indignant eyes was underlined
quaintly by the arrogant pair of moustaches which he proceeded
to twist, and as if extend, horizontally.</p>

<p>I might have smiled if I had not been busy with my own sensations,
which were not those of Mr. Burns. I was already the man in command.
My sensations could not be like those of any other man on board.
In that community I stood, like a king in his country, in a class
all by myself. I mean an hereditary king, not a mere elected head
of a state. I was brought there to rule by an agency as remote
from the people and as inscrutable almost to them as the Grace
of God.</p>

<p>And like a member of a dynasty, feeling a semimystical bond with
the dead, I was profoundly shocked by my immediate predecessor.</p>

<p>That man had been in all essentials but his age just such another
man as myself. Yet the end of his life was a complete act of treason,
the betrayal of a tradition which seemed to me as imperative as
any guide on earth could be. It appeared that even at sea a man
could become the victim of evil spirits. I felt on my face the
breath of unknown powers that shape our destinies.</p>

<p>Not to let the silence last too long I asked Mr. Burns if he
had written to his captain’s wife. He shook his head. He had written
to nobody.</p>

<p>In a moment he became sombre. He never thought of writing. It
took him all his time to watch incessantly the loading of the
ship by a rascally Chinese stevedore. In this Mr. Burns gave me
the first glimpse of the real chief mate’s soul which dwelt uneasily
in his body.</p>

<p>He mused, then hastened on with gloomy force.</p>

<p>"Yes! The captain died as near noon as possible. I looked through
his papers in the afternoon. I read the service over him at sunset
and then I stuck the ship’s head north and brought her in here.
<em>I&mdash;</em>brought&mdash;her&mdash;in."</p>

<p>He struck the table with his fist.</p>

<p>"She would hardly have come in by herself," I observed. "But
why didn’t you make for Singapore instead?"</p>

<p>His eyes wavered. "The nearest port," he muttered sullenly.</p>

<p>I had framed the question in perfect innocence, but his answer
(the difference in distance was insignificant) and his manner
offered me a clue to the simple truth. He took the ship to a port
where he expected to be confirmed in his temporary command from
lack of a qualified master to put over his head. Whereas Singapore,
he surmised justly, would be full of qualified men. But his naive
reasoning forgot to take into account the telegraph cable reposing
on the bottom of the very Gulf up which he had turned that ship
which he imagined himself to have saved from destruction. Hence
the bitter flavour of our interview. I tasted it more and more
distinctly&mdash;and it was less and less to my taste.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Burns," I began very firmly. "You may as well
understand that I did not run after this command. It was pushed
in my way. I’ve accepted it. I am here to take the ship home first
of all, and you may be sure that I shall see to it that every
one of you on board here does his duty to that end. This is all
I have to say&mdash;for the present."</p>

<p>He was on his feet by this time, but instead of taking his dismissal
he remained with trembling, indignant lips, and looking at me
hard as though, really, after this, there was nothing for me to
do in common decency but to vanish from his outraged sight. Like
all very simple emotional states this was moving. I felt sorry
for him&mdash;almost sympathetic, till (seeing that I did not vanish)
he spoke in a tone of forced restraint.</p>

<p>"If I hadn’t a wife and a child at home you may be sure, sir,
I would have asked you to let me go the very minute you came on
board."</p>

<p>I answered him with a matter-of-course calmness as though some
remote third person were in question.</p>

<p>"And I, Mr. Burns, would not have let you go. You have signed
the ship’s articles as chief officer, and till they are terminated
at the final port of discharge I shall expect you to attend to
your duty and give me the benefit of your experience to the best
of your ability."</p>

<p>Stony incredulity lingered in his eyes: but it broke down before
my friendly attitude. With a slight upward toss of his arms (I
got to know that gesture well afterward) he bolted out of the
cabin.</p>

<p>We might have saved ourselves that little passage of harmless
sparring. Before many days had elapsed it was Mr. Burns who was
pleading with me anxiously not to leave him behind; while I could
only return him but doubtful answers. The whole thing took on
a somewhat tragic complexion.</p>

<p>And this horrible problem was only an extraneous episode, a mere
complication in the general problem of how to get that ship&mdash;which
was mine with her appurtenances and her men, with her body and
her spirit now slumbering in that pestilential river&mdash;how to get
her out to sea.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns, while still acting captain, had hastened to sign a
charter-party which in an ideal world without guile would have
been an excellent document. Directly I ran my eye over it I foresaw
trouble ahead unless the people of the other part were quite exceptionally
fair-minded and open to argument.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns, to whom I imparted my fears, chose to take great umbrage
at them. He looked at me with that usual incredulous stare, and
said bitterly:</p>

<p>"I suppose, sir, you want to make out I’ve acted like a fool?"</p>

<p>I told him, with my systematic kindliness which always seemed
to augment his surprise, that I did not want to make out anything.
I would leave that to the future.</p>

<p>And, sure enough, the future brought in a lot of trouble. There
were days when I used to remember Captain Giles with nothing short
of abhorrence. His confounded acuteness had let me in for this
job; while his prophecy that I "would have my hands full" coming
true, made it appear as if done on purpose to play an evil joke
on my young innocence.</p>

<p>Yes. I had my hands full of complications which were most valuable
as "experience." People have a great opinion of the advantages
of experience. But in this connection experience means always
something disagreeable as opposed to the charm and innocence of
illusions.</p>

<p>I must say I was losing mine rapidly. But on these instructive
complications I must not enlarge more than to say that they could
all be resumed in the one word: Delay.</p>

<p>A mankind which has invented the proverb, "Time is money," will
understand my vexation. The word "Delay" entered the secret chamber
of my brain, resounded there like a tolling bell which maddens
the ear, affected all my senses, took on a black colouring, a
bitter taste, a deadly meaning.</p>

<p>"I am really sorry to see you worried like this. Indeed, I am.
. . ."</p>

<p>It was the only humane speech I used to hear at that time. And
it came from a doctor, appropriately enough.</p>

<p>A doctor is humane by definition. But that man was so in reality.
His speech was not professional. I was not ill. But other people
were, and that was the reason of his visiting the ship.</p>

<p>He was the doctor of our Legation and, of course, of the Consulate,
too. He looked after the ship’s health, which generally was poor,
and trembling, as it were, on the verge of a break-up. Yes. The
men ailed. And thus time was not only money, but life as well.</p>

<p>I had never seen such a steady ship’s company. As the doctor
remarked to me: "You seem to have a most respectable lot of seamen."
Not only were they consistently sober, but they did not even want
to go ashore. Care was taken to expose them as little as possible
to the sun. They were employed on light work under the awnings.
And the humane doctor commended me.</p>

<p>"Your arrangements appear to me to be very judicious, my dear
Captain."</p>

<p>It is difficult to express how much that pronouncement comforted
me. The doctor’s round, full face framed in a light-coloured whisker
was the perfection of a dignified amenity. He was the only human
being in the world who seemed to take the slightest interest in
me. He would generally sit in the cabin for half an hour or so
at every visit.</p>

<p>I said to him one day:</p>

<p>"I suppose the only thing now is to take care of them as you
are doing till I can get the ship to sea?"</p>

<p>He inclined his head, shutting his eyes under the large spectacles,
and murmured:</p>

<p>"The sea . . . undoubtedly."</p>

<p>The first member of the crew fairly knocked over was the steward&mdash;the
first man to whom I had spoken on board. He was taken ashore (with
choleric symptoms) and died there at the end of a week. Then,
while I was still under the startling impression of this first
home-thrust of the climate, Mr. Burns gave up and went to bed
in a raging fever without saying a word to anybody.</p>

<p>I believe he had partly fretted himself into that illness; the
climate did the rest with the swiftness of an invisible monster
ambushed in the air, in the water, in the mud of the river-bank.
Mr. Burns was a predestined victim.</p>

<p>I discovered him lying on his back, glaring sullenly and radiating
heat on one like a small furnace. He would hardly answer my questions,
and only grumbled. Couldn’t a man take an afternoon off duty with
a bad headache&mdash;for once?</p>

<p>That evening, as I sat in the saloon after dinner, I could hear
him muttering continuously in his room. Ransome, who was clearing
the table, said to me:</p>

<p>"I am afraid, sir, I won’t be able to give the mate all the attention
he’s likely to need. I will have to be forward in the galley a
great part of my time."</p>

<p>Ransome was the cook. The mate had pointed him out to me the
first day, standing on the deck, his arms crossed on his broad
chest, gazing on the river.</p>

<p>Even at a distance his well-proportioned figure, something thoroughly
sailor-like in his poise, made him noticeable. On nearer view
the intelligent, quiet eyes, a well-bred face, the disciplined
independence of his manner made up an attractive personality.
When, in addition, Mr. Burns told me that he was the best seaman
in the ship, I expressed my surprise that in his earliest prime
and of such appearance he should sign on as cook on board a ship.</p>

<p>"It’s his heart," Mr. Burns had said. "There’s something wrong
with it. He mustn’t exert himself too much or he may drop dead
suddenly."</p>

<p>And he was the only one the climate had not touched&mdash;perhaps
because, carrying a deadly enemy in his breast, he had schooled
himself into a systematic control of feelings and movements. When
one was in the secret this was apparent in his manner. After the
poor steward died, and as he could not be replaced by a white
man in this Oriental port, Ransome had volunteered to do the double
work.</p>

<p>"I can do it all right, sir, as long as I go about it quietly,"
he had assured me.</p>

<p>But obviously he couldn’t be expected to take up sick-nursing
in addition. Moreover, the doctor peremptorily ordered Mr. Burns
ashore.</p>

<p>With a seaman on each side holding him up under the arms, the
mate went over the gangway more sullen than ever. We built him
up with pillows in the gharry, and he made an effort to say brokenly:</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;you’ve got&mdash;what you wanted&mdash;got me out of&mdash;the ship."</p>

<p>"You were never more mistaken in your life, Mr. Burns," I said
quietly, duly smiling at him; and the trap drove off to a sort
of sanatorium, a pavilion of bricks which the doctor had in the
grounds of his residence.</p>

<p>I visited Mr. Burns regularly. After the first few days, when
he didn’t know anybody, he received me as if I had come either
to gloat over an enemy or else to curry favour with a deeply wronged
person. It was either one or the other, just as it happened according
to his fantastic sickroom moods. Whichever it was, he managed
to convey it to me even during the period when he appeared almost
too weak to talk. I treated him to my invariable kindliness.</p>

<p>Then one day, suddenly, a surge of downright panic burst through
all this craziness.</p>

<p>If I left him behind in this deadly place he would die. He felt
it, he was certain of it. But I wouldn’t have the heart to leave
him ashore. He had a wife and child in Sydney.</p>

<p>He produced his wasted forearms from under the sheet which covered
him and clasped his fleshless claws. He would die! He would die
here. . . .</p>

<p>He absolutely managed to sit up, but only for a moment, and when
he fell back I really thought that he would die there and then.
I called to the Bengali dispenser, and hastened away from the
room.</p>

<p>Next day he upset me thoroughly by renewing his entreaties. I
returned an evasive answer, and left him the picture of ghastly
despair. The day after I went in with reluctance, and he attacked
me at once in a much stronger voice and with an abundance of argument
which was quite startling. He presented his case with a sort of
crazy vigour, and asked me finally how would I like to have a
man’s death on my conscience? He wanted me to promise that I would
not sail without him.</p>

<p>I said that I really must consult the doctor first. He cried
out at that. The doctor! Never! That would be a death sentence.</p>

<p>The effort had exhausted him. He closed his eyes, but went on
rambling in a low voice. I had hated him from the start. The late
captain had hated him, too. Had wished him dead. Had wished all
hands dead. . . .</p>

<p>"What do you want to stand in with that wicked corpse for, sir?
He’ll have you, too," he ended, blinking his glazed eyes vacantly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Burns," I cried, very much discomposed, "what on earth are
you talking about?"</p>

<p>He seemed to come to himself, though he was too weak to start.</p>

<p>"I don’t know," he said languidly. "But don’t ask that doctor,
sir. You and I are sailors. Don’t ask him, sir. Some day perhaps
you will have a wife and child yourself."</p>

<p>And again he pleaded for the promise that I would not leave him
behind. I had the firmness of mind not to give it to him. Afterward
this sternness seemed criminal; for my mind was made up. That
prostrated man, with hardly strength enough to breathe and ravaged
by a passion of fear, was irresistible. And, besides, he had happened
to hit on the right words. He and I were sailors. That was a claim,
for I had no other family. As to the wife and child (some day)
argument, it had no force. It sounded merely bizarre.</p>

<p>I could imagine no claim that would be stronger and more absorbing
than the claim of that ship, of these men snared in the river
by silly commercial complications, as if in some poisonous trap.</p>

<p>However, I had nearly fought my way out. Out to sea. The sea&mdash;which
was pure, safe, and friendly. Three days more.</p>

<p>That thought sustained and carried me on my way back to the ship.
In the saloon the doctor’s voice greeted me, and his large form
followed his voice, issuing out of the starboard spare cabin where
the ship’s medicine chest was kept securely lashed in the bed-place.</p>

<p>Finding that I was not on board he had gone in there, he said,
to inspect the supply of drugs, bandages, and so on. Everything
was completed and in order.</p>

<p>I thanked him; I had just been thinking of asking him to do that
very thing, as in a couple of days, as he knew, we were going
to sea, where all our troubles of every sort would be over at
last.</p>

<p>He listened gravely and made no answer. But when I opened to
him my mind as to Mr. Burns he sat down by my side, and, laying
his hand on my knee amicably, begged me to think what it was I
was exposing myself to.</p>

<p>The man was just strong enough to bear being moved and no more.
But he couldn’t stand a return of the fever. I had before me a
passage of sixty days perhaps, beginning with intricate navigation
and ending probably with a lot of bad weather. Could I run the
risk of having to go through it single-handed, with no chief officer
and with a second quite a youth? . . .</p>

<p>He might have added that it was my first command, too. He did
probably think of that fact, for he checked himself. It was very
present to my mind.</p>

<p>He advised me earnestly to cable to Singapore for a chief officer,
even if I had to delay my sailing for a week.</p>

<p>"Never," I said. The very thought gave me the shivers. The hands
seemed fairly fit, all of them, and this was the time to get them
away. Once at sea I was not afraid of facing anything. The sea
was now the only remedy for all my troubles.</p>

<p>The doctor’s glasses were directed at me like two lamps searching
the genuineness of my resolution. He opened his lips as if to
argue further, but shut them again without saying anything. I
had a vision so vivid of poor Burns in his exhaustion, helplessness,
and anguish, that it moved me more than the reality I had come
away from only an hour before. It was purged from the drawbacks
of his personality, and I could not resist it.</p>

<p>"Look here," I said. "Unless you tell me officially that the
man must not be moved I’ll make arrangements to have him brought
on board tomorrow, and shall take the ship out of the river next
morning, even if I have to anchor outside the bar for a couple
of days to get her ready for sea."</p>

<p>"Oh! I’ll make all the arrangements myself," said the doctor
at once. "I spoke as I did only as a friend&mdash;as a well-wisher,
and that sort of thing."</p>

<p>He rose in his dignified simplicity and gave me a warm handshake,
rather solemnly, I thought. But he was as good as his word. When
Mr. Burns appeared at the gangway carried on a stretcher, the
doctor himself walked by its side. The programme had been altered
in so far that this transportation had been left to the last moment,
on the very morning of our departure.</p>

<p>It was barely an hour after sunrise. The doctor waved his big
arm to me from the shore and walked back at once to his trap,
which had followed him empty to the river-side. Mr. Burns, carried
across the quarter-deck, had the appearance of being absolutely
lifeless. Ransome went down to settle him in his cabin. I had
to remain on deck to look after the ship, for the tug had got
hold of our towrope already.</p>

<p>The splash of our shore-fasts falling in the water produced a
complete change of feeling in me. It was like the imperfect relief
of awakening from a nightmare. But when the ship’s head swung
down the river away from that town, Oriental and squalid, I missed
the expected elation of that striven-for moment. What there was,
undoubtedly, was a relaxation of tension which translated itself
into a sense of weariness after an inglorious fight.</p>

<p>About midday we anchored a mile outside the bar. The afternoon
was busy for all hands. Watching the work from the poop, where
I remained all the time, I detected in it some of the languor
of the six weeks spent in the steaming heat of the river. The
first breeze would blow that away. Now the calm was complete.
I judged that the second officer&mdash;a callow youth with an unpromising
face&mdash;was not, to put it mildly, of that invaluable stuff from
which a commander’s right hand is made. But I was glad to catch
along the main deck a few smiles on those seamen’s faces at which
I had hardly had time to have a good look as yet. Having thrown
off the mortal coil of shore affairs, I felt myself familiar with
them and yet a little strange, like a long-lost wanderer among
his kin.</p>

<p>Ransome flitted continually to and fro between the galley and
the cabin. It was a pleasure to look at him. The man positively
had grace. He alone of all the crew had not had a day’s illness
in port. But with the knowledge of that uneasy heart within his
breast I could detect the restraint he put on the natural sailor-like
agility of his movements. It was as though he had something very
fragile or very explosive to carry about his person and was all
the time aware of it.</p>

<p>I had occasion to address him once or twice. He answered me in
his pleasant, quiet voice and with a faint, slightly wistful smile.
Mr. Burns appeared to be resting. He seemed fairly comfortable.</p>

<p>After sunset I came out on deck again to meet only a still void.
The thin, featureless crust of the coast could not be distinguished.
The darkness had risen around the ship like a mysterious emanation
from the dumb and lonely waters. I leaned on the rail and turned
my ear to the shadows of the night. Not a sound. My command might
have been a planet flying vertiginously on its appointed path
in a space of infinite silence. I clung to the rail as if my sense
of balance were leaving me for good. How absurd. I failed nervously.</p>

<p>"On deck there!"</p>

<p>The immediate answer, "Yes, sir," broke the spell. The anchor-watch
man ran up the poop ladder smartly. I told him to report at once
the slightest sign of a breeze coming.</p>

<p>Going below I looked in on Mr. Burns. In fact, I could not avoid
seeing him, for his door stood open. The man was so wasted that,
in this white cabin, under a white sheet, and with his diminished
head sunk in the white pillow, his red moustaches captured their
eyes exclusively, like something artificial&mdash;a pair of moustaches
from a shop exhibited there in the harsh light of the bulkhead-lamp
without a shade.</p>

<p>While I stared with a sort of wonder he asserted himself by opening
his eyes and even moving them in my direction. A minute stir.</p>

<p>"Dead calm, Mr. Burns," I said resignedly.</p>

<p>In an unexpectedly distinct voice Mr. Burns began a rambling
speech. Its tone was very strange, not as if affected by his illness,
but as if of a different nature. It sounded unearthly. As to the
matter, I seemed to make out that it was the fault of the "old
man"&mdash;the late captain&mdash;ambushed down there under the sea with
some evil intention. It was a weird story.</p>

<p>I listened to the end; then stepping into the cabin I laid my
hand on the mate’s forehead. It was cool. He was light-headed
only from extreme weakness. Suddenly he seemed to become aware
of me, and in his own voice&mdash;of course, very feeble&mdash;he asked
regretfully:</p>

<p>"Is there no chance at all to get under way, sir?"</p>

<p>"What’s the good of letting go our hold of the ground only to
drift, Mr. Burns?" I answered.</p>

<p>He sighed and I left him to his immobility. His hold on life
was as slender as his hold on sanity. I was oppressed by my lonely
responsibilities. I went into my cabin to seek relief in a few
hours’ sleep, but almost before I closed my eyes the man on deck
came down reporting a light breeze. Enough to get under way with,
he said.</p>

<p>And it was no more than just enough. I ordered the windlass manned,
the sails loosed, and the topsails set. But by the time I had
cast the ship I could hardly feel any breath of wind. Nevertheless,
I trimmed the yards and put everything on her. I was not going
to give up the attempt.</p>
