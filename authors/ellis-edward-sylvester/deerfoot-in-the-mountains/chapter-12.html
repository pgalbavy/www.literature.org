<p>"Well," said Victor Shelton, "our tramping is through for several
months to come, and we may as well settle ourselves for the winter."</p>

<p>"There doesn't seem much to do in the way of settling," returned
his brother; "here we are, and here we must stay till spring comes
round. I wish it were with us now, for since we have started for
the Ohio I have become homesick."</p>

<p>"We'll soon get used to this life and shall feel better when
Deerfoot joins us."</p>

<p>They had removed the saddles and bridles from their horses and
the pack from the sturdy, faithful Zigzag, and brought them into
their new home, after which the animals, including Bug, the property
of Mul-tal-la, had been turned loose to browse with the others
at the rear of the village. Blankets were spread on the ground
at one side of the tepee, to serve as seats and couches, and the
other conveniences, which made up most of the burden carried thousands
of miles by Zigzag, were distributed with some taste about the
interior. Their native friends had shown their thoughtfulness
by heaping a pile of dry sticks under the chimney, with more placed
within reach. The starting of the fire was left to the lads. Nothing
in the way of food was in sight, but the brothers had no fear
of being forgotten or overlooked. It was several hours before
nightfall, and they reclined on the furs to rest themselves before
going outside. A dozen or more curious men and boys were lounging
near, for the murmur of their voices reached the brothers, but
no one ventured to intrude upon their privacy.</p>

<p>"George, when we get back to Ohio we shall be able to tell a
story that will beat anything Simon Kenton can relate."</p>

<p>"How? There are not many that have passed through as much as
he."</p>

<p>"But he has never been west of the Mississippi, and it isn't
likely he ever will go. We must have gone two thousand miles beyond.
When we see him again won't we make him open his eyes with our
story of a winter among a tribe of Indians far over toward the
Stony Mountains?"</p>

<p>"It will be a great story, indeed; but Victor, how are we going
to pass the more than a hundred days that we must stay in this
settlement?"</p>

<p>"Time goes fast enough when we are on the move, either shooting
rapids in a river, riding our horses or tramping on foot, but
it is mighty dull to sit still and do nothing, and we mustn't
think of any such thing."</p>

<p>"But what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"What shall we do? Lots of things. We can hunt and fish, play
games with the youngsters, learn to tramp on snowshoes when winter
is fairly here, and, if Taggarak goes off on any raids, we ought
to be able to make a full man apiece."</p>

<p>George looked into the face of his brother to see if he was in
earnest.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that, Victor?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do. Why not?"</p>

<p>"It is well enough to fight when you have to, but Deerfoot will
never let you do anything of that kind, nor would I agree to it.
It would be trying to kill other people just for the fun of doing
so, and <em>that</em> is contrary to what the Shawanoe has taught
us."</p>

<p>"I suppose we shall have to get on as best we can with the other
amusements, but I tremble when I think of the weather that will
be here in a few weeks."</p>

<p>George looked around at the brown shaggy walls of buffalo fur.
He grasped some of the long soft hairs in his palm and stroked
the cool mass.</p>

<p>"We need never run short of fuel, and when the fire is going
and the door shut I don't see why we shall not be as warm as in
our own home at Woodvale. But what shall we <em>do</em>? <em>That's</em>
the question. It will be tiresome beyond bearing to lie here stretched
hour after hour during the day."</p>

<p>"Plague take it!" impatiently exclaimed Victor; "who is going
to do anything of the kind? I should like to see Deerfoot let
you sleep and lounge your days away. He will share the lodge with
us, and you may be sure he'll keep things moving. There isn't
any weather cold enough nor snow deep enough to hold him within
doors, and he'll hustle you out with him. So let's hear no more
of that. Then you mustn't forget, George, that we shall make lots
of acquaintances among these people. We have learned to speak
a good many words of Blackfoot, and shall learn more; we shall
take a liking to some of these folks, and, if we have any kind
of tact, shall make them like us. Most of them have never before
looked upon a white person, but they will soon get over their
wonder, and we shall all stand on the same level."</p>

<p>"Well, Victor, you have done a good deal to cheer me up. I guess
it was the homesickness, after all, that made me blue. See here,
these two fellows that put up this house for us have been such
good friends that we must be able to call them by name."</p>

<p>"Mul-tal-la has repeated them several times to us."</p>

<p>"Now, will you repeat either of the names to me?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't do it to save my life. They are so long and outlandish
that I can never get my, tongue around them."</p>

<p>"Let's give them shorter names."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you name the taller one, who has such a crooked
nose."</p>

<p>George reflected a moment and replied;</p>

<p>"I'll call him 'Spink;' that is short and easily remembered.
I don't think he will be offended, for he seems to be good-natured."</p>

<p>"We can fancy that it may mean in some language, 'He that looks
Sweeter than Honey,' and he will be delighted when we manage to
make it clear with the help of Mul-tal-la. I have the other fellow
named."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Jiggers, or, The Warrior that showed Chief Taggarak all He Knows.
<em>That</em> ought to make him proud and happy."</p>

<p>So the two Blackfeet who had befriended the brothers received
their names, and will be hereafter thus known when we refer to
them, instead of using the difficult titles by which they were
called by those of their own race.</p>

<p>From his seat opposite the door that was closed Victor had noticed
a peculiar agitation now and then of the buffalo flap. Once, when
the corner was drawn a little aside, he caught the sparkle of
a bright eye, which was instantly withdrawn, as if the owner had
noticed that his peeping was observed and he was scared. By and
by the eye appeared again, and remained longer than before.</p>

<p>Victor smiled and crooked his finger at the peeping Tom. A moment
later the flap was pulled aside, so as to display the head of
an urchin some ten or twelve years old. Victor had whispered an
explanation to his brother, and both looked at the boy, who had
mustered up enough courage to step inside the tepee and then paused,
as if afraid to come forward.</p>

<p>This young Blackfoot had the broadest, chubbiest face the boys
had ever seen, and the grin on it seemed to touch each ear. He
was short, stocky, and the picture of good nature. He wore no
cap, and his thick black hair was cut so that it hung no lower
than his chin on each side. He wore a hunting shirt, leggings
and moccasins that were not very tidy, and he carried nothing
in the nature of a weapon about him.</p>

<p>Victor and George could not restrain a laugh at the chap's appearance.
The former continued to beckon to him, and said:</p>

<p>"Come here, Smiler, and shake hands with your friend."</p>

<p>He still hesitated, and, rising to his feet, Victor walked toward
him, speaking so soothingly that the visitor kept his place, though
apparently ready to duck his head and dash outdoors. He knew nothing
about the ceremony of shaking hands, but he allowed Victor to
take his palm in his own, and to lead him back to a seat on the
furs between the brothers. A few minutes sufficed to make him
feel at ease.</p>

<p>George and Victor called all their knowledge of Blackfoot into
use, but they could not think of a word that was intelligible
to the youngster, nor could they induce him to speak. He held
his forefinger between his lips, shook his head now and then,
and glanced slyly from one boy to the other, evidently well pleased
but still embarrassed and a little distrustful.</p>

<p>Victor suddenly crossed over to where most of the contents of
the pack carried by Zigzag had been laid out. Among these were
several gaudy trinkets brought all the way from Woodvale and carefully
reserved for special use. From the lot he took a string of bright
crimson, blue and green beads, strung upon a linen thread, the
loop being long enough to slip over the black crown and leave
the lower part resting in all its dazzling beauty on the breast
of the lad.</p>

<p>You cannot imagine the wonder and delight of the dusky urchin.
For a few seconds he seemed too overcome to speak, and hardly
breathed. He looked down at the glittering string, then drew his
forefinger from between his lips and gingerly caressed the prize.
Growing bolder, he raised the loop to his mouth as if to taste
it. Pressing one of the beads with his even white teeth, the tiny
glass snapped into fragments, some of which flew several feet
away. The youngster was startled and glanced up at Victor, as
if expecting a reproof.</p>

<p>The lad pleasantly shook his head to signify that the present
did not form a staple article of food, and then the urchin slipped
off the pile of furs and stood upon his sturdy legs. Looking gratefully
up at the paleface he lifted the string over his head and handed
the beads back to Victor. The latter took them from his hand and
immediately slipped them about his neck again, thus showing that
they belonged to the caller. Then the little one broke into grateful
laughter, ran to the door, thrust aside the flap, and was gone.</p>

<p>"You couldn't have hit upon a better name than 'Smiler,'" said
George Shelton, much amused by the peculiar visit they had received.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see one with so broad a grin? My only fear is that
the other chaps will be jealous of him and expect us to give them
presents, too. We haven't enough to go a tenth of the way round;
but I couldn't refuse that codger."</p>

<p>The caller had not been gone two minutes when Mul-tal-la came
in, bringing with him some buffalo meat that he had procured from
a neighbor. It was uncooked, which was a small matter to the brothers,
who were glad to see him, for he was the one person in the village
with whom they could converse freely. Carefully placing the meat
on several sticks, so as to protect it from dirt, he sat down
to chat a few minutes with his young friends.</p>

<p>He told them of his visit to his father and mother, whose hearts
were made as glad as his own, after their long separation; of
his call on the father and mother of the companion whose body
lay at rest many hundreds of miles away in the East, and of the
comforting assurance that was now his that nothing was to be feared
from the resentment of Chief Taggarak. Spink and Jiggers had received
within the preceding ten days the assurance from the sachem himself,
so that all uneasiness was gone from the heart of Mul-tal-la.
But, had not the counsel of the two messengers been followed,
nothing would have restrained Taggarak from taking the life of
the one that had failed to bring back his comrade.</p>

<p>Victor told of the visit just received from the urchin, and of
the present made to him, much to the lad's delight.</p>

<p>"We christened him 'Smiler,'" said Victor, "for I never saw such
a grin on the face of man or boy."</p>

<p>"We could not help giving him the beads, but fear it will make
trouble, for all the other boys in the village will want something,
and we haven't supply for half a dozen."</p>

<p>"It might have been as my brothers say," replied Mul-tal-la,
"if the boy had been the son of one of the ordinary warriors like
myself, but he is not."</p>

<p>"Has he a distinguished father?" asked the wondering George.</p>

<p>"He is the son of Taggarak, our great war chief."</p>

<p>"I never dreamed of that," exclaimed the pleased Victor. "It
surely could not have happened better. How is it that he was braver
than the other boys and came into the lodge when all the others
kept at a distance?"</p>

<p>"That," said the Blackfoot significantly, "is because he is the
son of Taggarak and <em>knows it</em>. He can do nothing that
can bring him punishment, unless it comes from his father, and
he does not punish him unless he acts as if he is afraid of something."</p>

<p>"How many children has Taggarak?"</p>

<p>"Only two&mdash;the one whom you saw, who bears the same name as his
father, and another boy about half as old, who is Ap-pa-pa-alk.
He promises to grow up like his father and to become one of the
greatest warriors among all the Blackfeet."</p>

<p>"When the chief learns that Taggarak Junior and we have become
friends, and he sees the beads around the neck of his boy, will
he not be pleased and feel kindly toward us, who gave him the
little present?"</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la was thoughtful for a minute before replying.</p>

<p>"The war chief is a man of strange moods. It may make no difference
in his feelings toward my brothers, but Mul-tal-la does not think
he will <em>hate</em> them for what they have done."</p>
