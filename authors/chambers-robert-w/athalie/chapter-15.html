<p>To her sisters Athalie wrote:</p>

<p>   "For reasons of economy, and other reasons, I have moved to   
1006 West Fifty-fifth Street where I have the top floor. I   
think that you both can find accommodations in this house    when
you return to New York.</p>

<p>   "So far I have not secured a position. Please don't think
I    am discouraged. I do hope that you are well and successful."</p>

<p>Their address, at that time, was Vancouver, B. C.</p>

<p>To Clive Bailey, Jr., his agent wrote:</p>

<p>   "Miss Athalie Greensleeve called at the office this morning   
and returned the keys to the apartment which she has    occupied.</p>

<p>   "Miss Greensleeve explained to me a fact of which I had not   
been aware, viz.: that the furniture, books, hangings,    pictures,
porcelains, rugs, clothing, furs, bed and table    linen, silver,
etc., etc., belong to you and not to her as I    had supposed.</p>

<p>   "I have compared the contents of the apartment with the   
minute inventory given me by Miss Greensleeve. Everything is   
accounted for; all is in excellent order.</p>

<p>   "I have, therefore, locked up the apartment, pending orders   
from you regarding its disposition,"&mdash;etc., etc.</p>

<p>The tall shabby house in Fifty-fourth Street was one of a five-storied
row built by a speculator to attract fashion many years before.
Fashion ignored the bait.</p>

<p>A small square of paper which had once been white was pasted
on the brick front just over the tarnished door-bell. On it was
written in ink: "Furnished Rooms."</p>

<p>Answering in person the first advertisement she had turned to
in the morning paper Athalie had found this place. There was nothing
attractive about it except the price; but that was sufficient
in this emergency. For the girl would not permit herself to remain
another night in the pretty apartment furnished for her by the
man whose engagement had been announced to her through the daily
papers.</p>

<p>And nothing of his would she take with her except the old gun-metal
wrist-watch, and Hafiz, and the barred basket in which Hafiz had
arrived. Everything else she left, her toilet silver, desk-set,
her evening gowns and wraps, gloves, negligées, boudoir caps,
slippers, silk stockings, all her bath linen, everything that
she herself had not purchased out of her own salary&mdash;even the
little silver cupid holding aloft his torch, which had been her
night-light.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "With a basket containing Hafiz, her suit-case,
and a furled umbrella she started for her new lodgings."]</p>

<p>Never again could she illuminate that torch. The other woman
must do that.</p>

<p>She went about quietly from room to room, lowering the shades
and drawing the curtains. There was brilliant colour in her cheeks,
an undimmed beauty in her eyes; pride crowned the golden head
held steady and high on its slender, snowy neck. Only the lips
threatened betrayal; and were bitten as punishment into immobility.</p>

<p>Her small steamer trunk went by a rickety private express for
fifty cents: with the basket containing Hafiz, her suit-case,
and a furled umbrella she started for her new lodgings.</p>

<p>Michael, opening the lower grille for her, stammered: "God knows
why ye do this, Miss! Th' young Masther'll be afther givin' me
the sack av ye lave the house unbeknowns't him!"</p>

<p>"I can't stay, Michael. He knows I can't. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye Miss! God be good to ye&mdash;an' th' pusheen&mdash;!" laying
a huge but gentle paw on Hafiz's basket whence a gentle plaint
arose.</p>

<p>And so Athalie and Hafiz departed into the world together; and
presently bivouacked; their first étape on life's long journey
ending on the top floor of 1006 West Fifty-fifth Street.</p>

<p>The landlady was a thin, anxious, and very common woman with
false hair and teeth; and evidently determined to secure Athalie
for a lodger.</p>

<p>But the terms she offered the girl for the entire top floor were
so absurdly small that Athalie hesitated, astonished and perplexed.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a jinx in the place," said the landlady; "I ain't
aiming to deceive nobody, and I'll tell you the God-awful truth.
If I don't," she added naïvely, "somebody else is sure to hand
it to you and you'll get sore on me and quit."</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> the matter with the apartment?" inquired the
girl uneasily.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you: the lady that had it went dead on me last August."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"No, dearie. It was chloral. And of course, the papers got hold
of it and nobody wants the apartment. That's why you get it cheap&mdash;if
you'll take it and chase out the jinx that's been wished on me.
Will you, dearie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the girl, looking around at the newly decorated
and cheerful rooms.</p>

<p>The landlady sniffed: "It certainly was one on me when I let
that jinx into my house&mdash;to have her go dead on me and all like
that."</p>

<p>"Poor thing," murmured Athalie, partly to herself.</p>

<p>"No, she wasn't poor. You ought to have seen her rings! Them's
what got her into trouble, dearie;&mdash;and the roll she flashed."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it suicide?" asked Athalie.</p>


<p>"I gotta tell you the truth. No, it wasn't. She was feeling fine
and dandy. Business had went good.... There was a young man to
visit her that evening. I seen him go up the stairs.... But I
was that sleepy I went to bed. So I didn't see him come down.
And next day at noon when I went up to do the room she lay dead
onto the floor, and her rings gone, and the roll missing out of
her stocking."</p>

<p>"Did the man kill her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dearie. And the papers had it. That's what put me in Dutch.
I gotta be honest with <em>you</em>. You'd hear it, anyway."</p>

<p>"But how could he give her chloral&mdash;"</p>

<p>The anxious, excited little woman's volubility could suffer restraint
no longer:</p>

<p>"Oh, he could dope her easy in the dark!" she burst out. "Not
that the house ain't thur'ly respectable as far as I can help
it, and all my lodgers is refined. No, Miss Greensleeve, I won't
stand for nothing that ain't refined and genteel. Only what can
a honest woman do when she's abed and asleep, what with all the
latch keys and entertainin', and things like that? No, Miss Greensleeve,
I ain't got myself to blame, being decent and law-abiding and
all like that, what with the police keeping tabs and the neighbourhood
not being Fifth Avenoo either!&mdash;and this jinx wished on me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose you ain't a-goin' to stay here now that you've
learned all about these goin's on and all like that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Please</em> wait!"&mdash;for the voluble landlady was already
beginning to sniffle;&mdash;"I am perfectly willing to stay, Mrs. Meehan,&mdash;if
you will promise to be a little patient about my rent until I
secure a position&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I will, Miss Greensleeve! I ain't plannin' to press you
none! I know how it is with money and with young ladies. Easy
come, easy go! Just give me what you can. I ain't fixed any too
good myself, what with butchers and bakers and rent owed me and
all like that. I guess I can trust you to act fair and square&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; I am square&mdash;so far."</p>

<p>Mrs. Meehan began to sob, partly with relief, partly with a general
tendency to sentimental hysteria: "I can see that, dearie. And
say&mdash;if you're quiet, I ain't peekin' around corners and through
key-holes. No, Miss Greensleeve; that ain't my style! Quiet behaved
young ladies can have their company without me saying nothing
to nobody. All I ask is that no lady will cut up flossy in any
shape, form, or manner, but behave genteel and refined to one
and all. I don't want no policeman in the area. That ain't much
to ask, is it?" she gasped, fairly out of breath between eloquence
and tears.</p>

<p>"No," said Athalie with a faint smile, "it isn't much to ask."</p>

<p>And so the agreement was concluded; Mrs. Meehan brought in fresh
linen for bed and bathroom, pulled out the new bureau drawers
and dusted them, carried away a few anæmic geraniums in pots,
and swept the new hardwood floor with a dry mop, explaining that
the entire apartment had been renovated and redecorated since
the tragic episode of last August, and that all the furniture
was brand new.</p>

<p>"Her trunks and clothes and all like that was took by the police,"
explained Mrs. Meehan, "but she left some rubbish behind a sliding
panel which they didn't find. I found it and I put it on the top
shelf in the closet&mdash;"</p>

<p>She dragged a chair thither, mounted it, and presently came trotting
back to the front room, carrying in both arms a bulky box of green
morocco and a large paper parcel bursting with odds and ends of
tinsel and silk. These she dumped on the centre table, saying:
"She had a cabinet-maker fix up a cupboard in the baseboard, and
that's where she kept gimcracks. The police done me damage enough
without my showin' them her hidin' place and the things she kept
there. Here &mdash;I'll show it to you! It's full of keys and
electric wires and switches&mdash;"</p>

<p>She took Athalie by the arm and drew her over to the west side
of the room.</p>

<p>"You can't see nothing there, can you?" she demanded, pointing
at the high wainscoting of dull wood polished by age.</p>

<p>Athalie confessed she could not.</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Meehan passed her bony hand along the panels until her work-worn
forefinger rested on a polished knot in the richly grained wood.
Then she pushed; and the entire square of panels swung outward,
lowering like a drawbridge, and presently rested flat on the floor.</p>

<p>"How odd!" exclaimed Athalie, kneeling to see better.</p>

<p>What she saw was a cupboard lined with asbestos, and an elaborate
electric switchboard set with keys from which innumerable insulated
wires radiated, entering tubes that disappeared in every direction.</p>

<p>"What are all these for?" she asked, rising to her feet.</p>

<p>"Dearie, I've got to be honest with <em>you</em>. This here lady
was a meejum."</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>what?"</p>

<p>"A meejum."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you know, dearie? She threw trances for twenty per.
She seen things. She done stunts with tables and tambourines and
accordions. Why this here place is all wired and fixed up between
the walls and the ceiling and roof and the flooring, too. There
is chimes and bells and harmonicas and mechanical banjos under
the flooring and in the walls and ceiling. There's a whispering
phonograph, too, and something that sighs and sobs. Also a machine
that is full of singing birds that pipe up just as sweet and soft
and natural as can be.</p>

<p>"On rainy days you can amuse yourself with them keys; I don't
like to fool with them myself, being nervous with a weak back
and my vittles not setting right and all like that&mdash;" Again she
ran down from sheer lack of breath.</p>

<p>Athalie gazed curiously at the secret cupboard. After a few moments
she bent over, lifted and replaced the panelling and passed her
slim hand over the wainscot, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"So the woman was a trance-medium," she said, half to herself.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Greensleeve. She read the stars, too, and she done
cards on the side; you know&mdash;all about a blond gentleman that
wants to meet you and a dark lady comin' over the water to do
something mean to you. She charged high, but she had customers
enough&mdash;swell ladies, too, in their automobiles, and old gentlemen
and young and all like that.... Here's part of her outfit"&mdash;leading
Athalie to the centre table and opening the green morocco box.</p>

<p>In the box was a slim bronze tripod and a big sphere of crystal.
Mrs. Meehan placed the tripod on the table and set the crystal
sphere upon it, saying dubiously: "She claimed that she could
see things in that. I guess it was part of her game. I ain't never
seen nothing into that glass ball, and I've looked, too. You can
have it if you want it. It's kind of cute to set on the mantel."</p>

<p>She began to paw and grub and rummage in the big paper parcel,
scratching about in the glittering mess of silk and embroidery
with a pertinacity entirely gallinaceous.</p>

<p>"You can have these, too," she said to Athalie&mdash;"if you want
'em. They're heathen I guess&mdash;" holding up some tawdry Japanese
and home-made Chinese finery.</p>

<p>But Athalie declined the dead woman's robes of office and Mrs.
Meehan rolled them up in the wrapping paper and took them and
herself off, very profuse in her gratitude to Athalie for consenting
to occupy the apartment and thereby remove the "jinx" that had
inhabited it since the tragedy of the month before.</p>

<p>A very soft and melancholy mew from the basket informed the girl
that Hafiz desired his liberty. So she let him out and he trotted
at her heels as she walked about inspecting the apartment. Also
he did considerable inspecting on his own account, sniffing at
every door-sill and crack, jumping up on chairs to look out of
windows, prowling in and out of closets, his plumy tail jerking
with dubiousness and indecision.</p>

<p>The apartment was certainly clean. Evidently the house had been
a good one in its day, for the trim was dark old mahogany, rich
and beautiful in colour; and the fireplace was rather pretty with
its acanthus leaves and roses deeply carved in marble which time
had toned to an ivory tint.</p>

<p>The darkly stained floor of hardwood was, of course, modern.
So were the new and very hideous oriental rugs made in Hoboken,
and the aniline pink wall-paper, and the brand new furniture still
smelling of department store varnish. Hideous, too, were the electric
fixtures, the gas-log in the old-time fireplace, and the bargain
counter bric-a-brac geometrically spaced upon the handsome old
mantel.</p>

<p>But there were possibilities in the big, square room facing south
and in the two smaller bed chambers fronting the north. A modern
bathroom connected these.</p>

<p>To find an entire top floor in New York at such a price was as
amazing as it was comfortable to the girl who had not expected
to be able to afford more than a small bedroom.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>She had a little money left, enough to purchase food and a few
pots and pans to cook it over the gas range in one of the smaller
rooms.</p>

<p>And here she and Hafiz had their first meal on the long world-trail
stretching away before her. After which she sat for a while by
the window in a stiff arm-chair, thinking of Clive and of his
silence, and of the young girl he was one day to marry.</p>

<p>Southward, the lights of the city began to break out and sparkle
through the autumn haze; tall towers, hitherto invisible, suddenly
glimmered against the sky-line. A double vista of lighted street
lamps stretched east and west below her.</p>

<p>The dusty-violet light of evening softened the shabby street
below, veiling ugliness and squalor and subtly transmuting meanness
and poverty to picturesqueness&mdash;as artists, using only the flattering
simplicity of essentials, show us in etching and aquarelle the
romance of the commonplace. And so the rusty iron balconies of
a chop suey across the street became quaint and curious: dragon
and swinging gilded sign, banner and garish fretwork grew mellow
and mysterious under the ruddy Hunter's Moon sailing aloft out
of the city's haze like a great Chinese lantern.</p>

<p>From an unseen steeple or two chimes sounded the hour. Farther
away in the city a bell answered. It is not a city of belfries
and chimes; only locally and by hazard are bell notes distinguishable
above the interminable rolling monotone of the streets.</p>

<p>And now, the haze thickening, distant reverberations, deep, mellow,
melancholy, grew in the night air: fog horns from the two rivers
and the bay.</p>

<p>Leaning both elbows on the sill of the opened window Athalie
gazed wearily into the street where noisy children shrilled at
one another and dodged vehicles like those quick tiny creatures
whirling on ponds.</p>

<p>Here and there, the flare of petroleum torches lighted push-carts
piled with fruit or laden with bowls of lemonade and hokey-pokey.
Sidewalks were crowded with shabby people gossiping in groups
or passing east and west&mdash;about what squalid business only they
could know.</p>

<p>On the stoops of all the dwellings, brick or brownstone, people
sat; the men in shirt-sleeves, the young girls bare-headed, and
in light summer gowns. Pianos sounded through open parlour windows;
there was dancing going on somewhere in the block.</p>

<p>Eastward where the street intersected the glare of the dingy
avenue, a policeman stood on fixed post, the electric lights guttering
on his metal-work when he turned. Athalie had laid her cheek on
her arms and closed her eyes, from fatigue, perhaps; perhaps to
force back the tears which, nevertheless, glimmered on her lashes
where they lay close to the curved white cheeks.</p>

<p>Little by little the girl was taking degree after degree in her
post-graduate course, the study of which was man.</p>

<p>And for the first time in her life a new reaction in the laboratory
of experience had revealed to her a new element in her analysis;
bitterness.</p>

<p>Which is akin to resentment. And to these it is easy to ally
recklessness.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>There came to her a moment, as she sat huddled there at the window,
when endurance suddenly flashed into a white anger; and she found
herself on her feet, pacing the room as caged things pace, with
a sort of blindly fixed purpose, seeing everything yet looking
at nothing that she passed.</p>

<p>But after this had lasted long enough she halted, gazing about
her as though for something that might aid her. But there was
only the room and the furniture, and Hafiz asleep on a chair;
only these and the crystal sphere on its slim bronze tripod. And
suddenly she found herself on her knees beside it, staring into
its dusky transparent depths, fixing her mind, concentrating every
thought, straining every faculty, every nerve in the one desperate
and imperative desire.</p>

<p>But through the crystal's depths there is no aid for those who
"see clearly," no comfort, no answer. She could not find there
the man she searched for&mdash;the man for whom her soul cried out
in fear, in anger, in despair. As in a glass, darkly, only her
own face she saw, fire-edged with a light like that which burns
deep in black opals.</p>

<p>Prone on the floor at last, her white face framed by her hands,
her eyes wide open in the dark, she finally understood that her
clear vision was of no avail where she herself was concerned;
that they who see clearly can never use that vision to help themselves.</p>

<p>Fiercely she resented it,&mdash;the more bitterly because for the
first time in her life she had condescended to any voluntary effort
toward clairvoyance.</p>

<p>Wearily she sat up on the floor and gathered her knees into her
arms, staring at nothing there in the darkness while the slow
tears fell.</p>

<p>Never before had she known loneliness. A man had made her understand
it. Never before had she known bitterness. A man had taught it
to her. Never again should any man do what this man had done to
her! She was learning resentment.</p>

<p>All men should be the same to her hereafter. All men should stand
already condemned. Never again should one among them betray her
mind to reveal itself, persuade her heart to response, her lips
to sacrifice their sweetness and their pride, her soul to stir
in its sleep, awake, and answer. And for what the minds and hearts
of men might bring upon themselves, let men be responsible. Their
inclinations, offers, protests, promises as far as they regarded
herself could never again affect her. Let man look to himself;
his desires no longer concerned her. Let him keep his distance&mdash;or
take his chances. And there were no chances.</p>

<p>Athalie was learning resentment.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>Somebody was knocking. Athalie rose from the floor, turned on
the lights, dried her eyes, went slowly to the door, and opened
it.</p>

<p>A large, fat, pallid woman stood in the hallway. Her eyes were
as washed out as her faded, yellowish hair; and her kimono needed
washing.</p>

<p>"Good evening," she said cordially, coming in without any encouragement
from Athalie and settling her uncorseted bulk in the arm-chair.
"My name is Grace Bellmore, &mdash;Mrs. Grace Bellmore. I have
the rear rooms under yours. If you're ever lonely come down and
talk it over. Neighbours are not what they might be in this house.
Look out for the Meehan, too. I'd call her a cat only I like cats.
Say, that's a fine one on your bed there. Persian? Oh, Angora&mdash;"
here she fished out a cigarette from the pocket of her wrapper,
found a match, scratched it on the sole of her ample slipper,
and lighted her cigarette.</p>

<p>"Have one?" she inquired. "No? Don't like them? Oh, well, you'll
come to 'em. Everything comes easy when you're lonely. <em>I</em>
know. You don't have to tell me. God! I get so sick of my own
company sometimes&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned her head to gaze about her, twisting her heavy, creased
neck as far as the folds of fat permitted: "You had your nerve
with you when you took this place. I knew Mrs. Del Garmo. I warned
her, too. But she was a bone-head. A woman can't be careless in
this town. And when it comes to men&mdash;say, Miss Greensleeve, I
want to know their names before they ask me to dinner and start
in calling me Grace. It's Grace <em>after</em> meat with <em>me</em>!"
And she laughed and laughed, slapping her fat knee with a pudgy,
ring-laden hand.</p>

<p>Athalie, secretly dismayed, forced a polite smile. Mrs. Bellmore
blew a few smoke rings toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Are you in business, Miss Greensleeve?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... I am looking for a position."</p>

<p>"What a pretty voice&mdash;and refined way of speaking!" exclaimed
Mrs. Bellmore frankly. "I guess you've seen better days. Most
people have. Tell you the truth, though, I haven't. I'm better
off than I ever was before. Of course this is the dull season,
but things are picking up. What is your line, Miss Greensleeve?"</p>

<p>"Stenographer."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, I don't suppose I could do anything for you, could
I?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what your business is," ventured Athalie, who,
heretofore had not dared even to surmise what might be the vocation
of this very large and faded woman who wore a pink kimono and
a dozen rings on her nicotine-stained fingers, and who smoked
incessantly.</p>

<p>The woman seemed to be a trifle surprised: "Haven't you ever
heard of Grace Bellmore?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Athalie with increasing diffidence.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe you wouldn't, not being in the profession. The managers
all know me. I run an Emergency Agency on Broadway."</p>

<p>"I don't think I understand," said the girl.</p>

<p>"No? Then it's like this: a show gets stuck and needs a quick
study. They call me up and I throw them what they want at an hour's
notice. They can always count on me for anything from wardrobe
mistress to prima donna. That's how I get mine," she concluded
with a jolly laugh.</p>

<p>Athalie, feeling a little more confidence in her visitor, smiled
at her.</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;you're a beauty!" exclaimed Mrs. Bellmore, gazing at her.
"You're all there, too. I could place you easy if you ever need
it. You don't sing, do you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ever had your voice tried?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Dance?"</p>

<p>"I dance&mdash;whatever is being danced&mdash;rather easily."</p>

<p>"No stage experience?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what do you say, Miss Greensleeve?"</p>

<p>Athalie coloured and laughed: "Thank you, but I had rather work
at stenography."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellmore said: "I certainly hate to admit it, and knock
my own profession, but any good stenographer in a year makes more
than many a star you read about.... Unless there's men putting
up for her."</p>

<p>Athalie nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"All the same you'd make a peach of a show-girl," added Mrs.
Bellmore regretfully. And, after a rather intent interval of silent
scrutiny: "You're a <em>good</em> girl, too.... Say, you <em>do</em>
get pretty lonely sometimes, don't you, dear?"</p>

<p>Athalie flushed and shook her head. Mrs. Bellmore lighted another
cigarette from the smouldering remnant of the previous one, and
flung the gilt-tipped remains through the window.</p>

<p>"Ten to one it hits a crook if it hits anybody," she remarked.
"This is a fierce neighbourhood,&mdash;all sorts of joints, and then
some. But I like my rooms. I don't guess you'll be bothered. A
girl is more likely to get spoken to in the swell part of town.
Well,&mdash;" she struggled to her fat feet&mdash;"I'll be going. If you're
lonely, drop in during the evening. I'm at the office all day
except Sundays and holidays."</p>

<p>They stood, confronted, looking at each other for a moment. Then,
impulsively the fat woman offered her hand:</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid of me," she said. "I may look crooked, but I'm
not. Your mother wouldn't mind my knowing you."</p>

<p>She held Athalie's narrow hand for a moment, and the girl looked
into the faded eyes.</p>

<p>"Thank you for coming," she said. "I <em>was</em> lonely."</p>

<p>"Good girls usually are. It's a hell of an alternative, isn't
it? I don't mean to be profane; hell is the word. It's hell either
way for a girl alone."</p>

<p>Athalie nodded silently. Mrs. Bellmore looked at her, then glanced
around the room, curiously.</p>

<p>"Hello," she said abruptly, "what's that?"</p>

<p>Athalie's eyes followed hers: "Do you mean the crystal?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Say&mdash;" she turned to Athalie, nodding profound emphasis
on every word she uttered:&mdash;"Say, I <em>thought</em> there was
something else to you&mdash;something I couldn't quite get next to.
Now I know what's been bothering me about you. You're clairvoyant!"</p>

<p>Athalie's cheeks grew warm: "I am not a medium," she said. "That
crystal is not my own."</p>

<p>"That may be. Maybe you don't think you are a medium. But you
are, Miss Greensleeve. <em>I</em> know. I'm a little that way,
too,&mdash;just a very little. Oh, I could go into the business and
fake it of course,&mdash;like all the others&mdash;or most of them. But
you are the real thing. Why," she exclaimed in vexation, "didn't
I know it as soon as I laid eyes on you? I certainly was subconscious
of something. Why you could do anything you pleased with the power
you have if you'd care to learn the business. There's money in
it&mdash;take it from me!"</p>

<p>Athalie said, after a few moments of silence: "I don't think
I understand. Is there a way of&mdash;of developing clear vision?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you ever tried?"</p>

<p>"Never.... Except when a little while ago I went over to the
crystal and&mdash;and tried to find&mdash;somebody."</p>

<p>"Did you find&mdash;that person?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellmore shook her fat head: "You needn't tell me any more.
You can't ever do yourself any good by crystal gazing&mdash;you poor
child."</p>

<p>Athalie's head dropped.</p>

<p>"No, it's no use," said the other. "If you go into the business
and play square you can sometimes help others. But I guess the
crystal is mostly fake. Mrs. Del Garmo had one like yours. She
admitted to me that she never saw anything in it until she hypnotised
herself. And she could do that by looking steadily at a brass
knob on a bed-post; and see as much in it as in her crystal."</p>

<p>The fat woman lighted another cigarette and blew a contemplative
whiff toward the crystal: "No: at best the game is a crooked one,
even for the few who have really any occult power."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the girl, surprised.</p>

<p>"Because they are usually clever, nimble-witted, full of intuition.
Deduction is an instinct with them. And it is very easy to elaborate
from a basis of truth;&mdash;it's more than a temptation to intelligence
to complete a story desired and already paid for by a client.
Because almost invariably the client is as stupid as the medium
is intelligent. And, take it from me, it's impossible not to use
your intelligence when a partly finished business deal requires
it."</p>

<p>Athalie was silent.</p>

<p>"<em>I'd</em> do it," laughed Mrs. Bellmore.</p>

<p>Athalie said nothing.</p>

<p>"Say, on the level," said the older woman, "do you see a lot
that we others can't see, Miss Greensleeve?"</p>

<p>"I have seen&mdash;some things."</p>

<p>"Plenty, too, I'll bet! Oh, it's in your pretty face, in your
eyes!&mdash;it's in you, all about you. I'm not much in that line but
I can feel it in the air. Why I felt it as soon as I came into
your room, but I was that stupid&mdash;thinking of Mrs. Del Garmo&mdash;and
never associating it with you!... Do you do any trance work?"</p>

<p>"No.... I have never cultivated&mdash;anything of that sort."</p>

<p>"I know. The really gifted don't cultivate the power as a rule.
Only one now and then, and here and there. The others are pure
frauds&mdash;almost every one of them. But&mdash;" she looked searchingly
at the girl,&mdash;"you're no fraud! Why you're full of it!&mdash;full&mdash;saturated&mdash;alive
with&mdash;with vitality&mdash;psychical and physical! &mdash;You're a glorious
thing&mdash;half spiritual, half human&mdash;a superb combination of vitality,
sacred and profane!" &mdash;She checked herself and turned on
the girl almost savagely: "Who was the fool of a man you were
looking for in the crystal?... Very well; don't tell then. I didn't
suppose you would. Only &mdash;God help him for the fool he is&mdash;and
forgive him for what he has done to you!... And may I never enter
this room again and find you with the tears freshly scrubbed out
of the most honest eyes God ever gave a woman!... Good night,
Miss Greensleeve!"</p>

<p>"Good night," said Athalie.</p>

<p>After she had closed the door and locked it she turned back into
the empty room, moving uncertainly as though scarcely knowing
what she was about. And then, suddenly, the terror of utter desolation
seized her, and for the first time she realised what Clive had
been to her, <em>and what he had not been</em>&mdash;understood for
the first time in her life the complex miracle called love, its
synthesis, its every element, every molecule, every atom, and
flung herself across the bed, half strangled, sobbing out her
passion and her grief.</p>

<p>Dawn found her lying there; but the ravage of that night had
stripped her of much that she had been, and never again would
be. And what had been taken from her was slowly being replaced
by what she had never yet been. Night stripped her; the red dawn
clothed her.</p>

<p>She sat up, dry-eyed, unbound her hair, flung from her the crumpled
negligée. Presently the first golden-pink ray of the rising sun
fell across her snowy body, and she flung out her lovely arms
to it as though to draw it into her empty heart.</p>

<p>Hafiz, blinking his jewelled eyes, watched her lazily from his
pillow.</p>
