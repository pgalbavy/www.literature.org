<p>The farm was less than a hundred yards from the wood's edge.  The
wall of trees formed the fourth side to the open quadrangle.  The
house faced the wood.  With tangled emotions, Syson noted the plum
blossom falling on the profuse, coloured primroses, which he
himself had brought here and set.  How they had increased!  There
were thick tufts of scarlet, and pink, and pale purple primroses
under the plum trees.  He saw somebody glance at him through the
kitchen window, heard men's voices.</p>

<p>The door opened suddenly: very womanly she had grown!  He felt
himself going pale.</p>

<p>&quot;You? - Addy!&quot; she exclaimed, and stood motionless.</p>

<p>&quot;Who?&quot; called the farmer's voice.  Men's low voices answered.
Those low voices, curious and almost jeering, roused the tormented
spirit in the visitor.  Smiling brilliantly at her, he waited.</p>

<p>&quot;Myself - why not?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>The flush burned very deep on her cheek and throat.</p>

<p>&quot;We are just finishing dinner,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I will stay outside.&quot;  He made a motion to show that he would
sit on the red earthenware pipkin that stood near the door among
the daffodils, and contained the drinking water.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, come in,&quot; she said hurriedly.  He followed her.  In the
doorway, he glanced swiftly over the family, and bowed.  Everyone
was confused.  The farmer, his wife, and the four sons sat at the
coarsely laid dinner-table, the men with arms bare to the elbows.</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry I come at lunch-time,&quot; said Syson.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, Addy!&quot; said the farmer, assuming the old form of address,
but his tone cold.  &quot;How are you?&quot;</p>

<p>And he shook hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall you have a bit?&quot; he invited the young visitor, but taking
for granted the offer would be refused.  He assumed that Syson was
become too refined to eat so roughly.  The young man winced at the
imputation.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you had any dinner?&quot; asked the daughter.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Syson.  &quot;It is too early.  I shall be back at half-
past one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You call it lunch, don't you?&quot; asked the eldest son, almost
ironical.  He had once been an intimate friend of this young man.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll give Addy something when we've finished,&quot; said the mother,
an invalid, deprecating.</p>

<p>&quot;No - don't trouble.  I don't want to give you any trouble,&quot; said
Syson.</p>

<p>&quot;You could allus live on fresh air an' scenery,&quot; laughed the
youngest son, a lad of nineteen.</p>

<p>Syson went round the buildings, and into the orchard at the back of
the house, where daffodils all along the hedgerow swung like
yellow, ruffled birds on their perches.  He loved the place
extraordinarily, the hills ranging round, with bear-skin woods
covering their giant shoulders, and small red farms like brooches
clasping their garments; the blue streak of water in the valley,
the bareness of the home pasture, the sound of myriad-threaded
bird-singing, which went mostly unheard.  To his last day, he would
dream of this place, when he felt the sun on his face, or saw the
small handfuls of snow between the winter twigs, or smelt the
coming of spring.</p>

<p>Hilda was very womanly.  In her presence he felt constrained.  She
was twenty-nine, as he was, but she seemed to him much older.  He
felt foolish, almost unreal, beside her.  She was so static.  As he
was fingering some shed plum blossom on a low bough, she came to
the back door to shake the table-cloth.  Fowls raced from the
stackyard, birds rustled from the trees.  Her dark hair was
gathered up in a coil like a crown on her head.  She was very
straight, distant in her bearing.  As she folded the cloth, she
looked away over the hills.</p>

<p>Presently Syson returned indoors.  She had prepared eggs and curd
cheese, stewed gooseberries and cream.</p>

<p>&quot;Since you will dine to-night,&quot; she said, &quot;I have only given you a
light lunch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is awfully nice,&quot; he said.  &quot;You keep a real idyllic atmosphere - 
your belt of straw and ivy buds.&quot;</p>

<p>Still they hurt each other.</p>

<p>He was uneasy before her.  Her brief, sure speech, her distant
bearing, were unfamiliar to him.  He admired again her grey-black
eyebrows, and her lashes.  Their eyes met.  He saw, in the
beautiful grey and black of her glance, tears and a strange light,
and at the back of all, calm acceptance of herself, and triumph
over him.</p>

<p>He felt himself shrinking.  With an effort he kept up the ironic
manner.</p>

<p>She sent him into the parlour while she washed the dishes.  The
long low room was refurnished from the Abbey sale, with chairs
upholstered in claret-coloured rep, many years old, and an oval
table of polished walnut, and another piano, handsome, though still
antique.  In spite of the strangeness, he was pleased.  Opening a
high cupboard let into the thickness of the wall, he found it full
of his books, his old lesson-books, and volumes of verse he had
sent her, English and German.  The daffodils in the white window-
bottoms shone across the room, he could almost feel their rays.
The old glamour caught him again.  His youthful water-colours on
the wall no longer made him grin; he remembered how fervently he
had tried to paint for her, twelve years before.</p>

<p>She entered, wiping a dish, and he saw again the bright, kernel-
white beauty of her arms.</p>

<p>&quot;You are quite splendid here,&quot; he said, and their eyes met.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you like it?&quot; she asked.  It was the old, low, husky tone of
intimacy.  He felt a quick change beginning in his blood.  It was
the old, delicious sublimation, the thinning, almost the vaporizing
of himself, as if his spirit were to be liberated.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye,&quot; he nodded, smiling at her like a boy again.  She bowed her
head.</p>

<p>&quot;This was the countess's chair,&quot; she said in low tones.  &quot;I found
her scissors down here between the padding.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you?  Where are they?&quot;</p>

<p>Quickly, with a lilt in her movement, she fetched her work-basket,
and together they examined the long-shanked old scissors.</p>

<p>&quot;What a ballad of dead ladies!&quot; he said, laughing, as he fitted his
fingers into the round loops of the countess's scissors.</p>

<p>&quot;I knew you could use them,&quot; she said, with certainty.  He looked
at his fingers, and at the scissors.  She meant his fingers were
fine enough for the small-looped scissors.</p>

<p>&quot;That is something to be said for me,&quot; he laughed, putting the
scissors aside.  She turned to the window.  He noticed the fine,
fair down on her cheek and her upper lip, and her soft, white neck,
like the throat of a nettle flower, and her fore-arms, bright as
newly blanched kernels.  He was looking at her with new eyes, and
she was a different person to him.  He did not know her.  But he
could regard her objectively now.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we go out awhile?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; he answered.  But the predominant emotion, that troubled the
excitement and perplexity of his heart, was fear, fear of that
which he saw.  There was about her the same manner, the same
intonation in her voice, now as then, but she was not what he had
known her to be.  He knew quite well what she had been for him.
And gradually he was realizing that she was something quite other,
and always had been.</p>

<p>She put no covering on her head, merely took off her apron, saying,
&quot;We will go by the larches.&quot;  As they passed the old orchard, she
called him in to show him a blue-tit's nest in one of the apple
trees, and a sycock's in the hedge.  He rather wondered at her
surety, at a certain hardness like arrogance hidden under her
humility.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at the apple buds,&quot; she said, and he then perceived myriads
of little scarlet balls among the drooping boughs.  Watching his
face, her eyes went hard.  She saw the scales were fallen from him,
and at last he was going to see her as she was.  It was the thing
she had most dreaded in the past, and most needed, for her soul's
sake.  Now he was going to see her as she was.  He would not love
her, and he would know he never could have loved her.  The old
illusion gone, they were strangers, crude and entire.  But he would
give her her due - she would have her due from him.</p>

<p>She was brilliant as he had not known her.  She showed him nests: a
jenny wren's in a low bush.</p>

<p>&quot;See this jinty's!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He was surprised to hear her use the local name.  She reached
carefully through the thorns, and put her fingers in the nest's
round door.</p>

<p>&quot;Five!&quot; she said.  &quot;Tiny little things.&quot;</p>

<p>She showed him nests of robins, and chaffinches, and linnets, and
buntings; of a wagtail beside the water.</p>

<p>&quot;And if we go down, nearer the lake, I will show you a kingfisher's
. . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Among the young fir trees,&quot; she said, &quot;there's a throstle's or a
blackie's on nearly every bough, every ledge.  The first day, when
I had seen them all, I felt as if I mustn't go in the wood.  It
seemed a city of birds: and in the morning, hearing them all, I
thought of the noisy early markets.  I was afraid to go in my own
wood.&quot;</p>

<p>She was using the language they had both of them invented.  Now it
was all her own.  He had done with it.  She did not mind his
silence, but was always dominant, letting him see her wood.  As
they came along a marshy path where forget-me-nots were opening in
a rich blue drift:  &quot;We know all the birds, but there are many
flowers we can't find out,&quot; she said.  It was half an appeal to
him, who had known the names of things.</p>

<p>She looked dreamily across to the open fields that slept in the
sun.</p>

<p>&quot;I have a lover as well, you know,&quot; she said, with assurance, yet
dropping again almost into the intimate tone.</p>

<p>This woke in him the spirit to fight her.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I met him.  He is good-looking - also in Arcady.&quot;</p>

<p>Without answering, she turned into a dark path that led up-hill,
where the trees and undergrowth were very thick.</p>

<p>&quot;They did well,&quot; she said at length, &quot;to have various altars to
various gods, in old days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah yes!&quot; he agreed.  &quot;To whom is the new one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are no old ones,&quot; she said.  &quot;I was always looking for
this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And whose is it?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said, looking full at him.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm very glad, for your sake,&quot; he said, &quot;that you are satisfied.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye - but the man doesn't matter so much,&quot; she said.  There was a
pause.</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; he exclaimed, astonished, yet recognizing her as her real
self.</p>

<p>&quot;It is one's self that matters,&quot; she said.  &quot;Whether one is being
one's own self and serving one's own God.&quot;</p>

<p>There was silence, during which he pondered.  The path was almost
flowerless, gloomy.  At the side, his heels sank into soft clay.</p>
