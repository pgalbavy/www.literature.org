<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>In September, her marriage to Siward excitingly imminent, Sylvia
had been seized with a passion for wholesale renunciation and
rigid self-chastisement. All that had been so materially desirable
to her in life, all that she had heretofore worshipped, in and
belonging to her own world, she now denied. Down went the miniature
golden calf from the altar in her private shrine, its tiny crashing
fall making considerable racket throughout her world, and the
planets and satellites adjacent to that section of the social
system which she had long been expected to dominate.</p>

<p>The spectacle of their youthful ruler-elect in sackcloth as the
future bride of a business man had more than disconcerted them.
The amazing announcement of Quarrier's engagement to Agatha Caithness
stupefied the elect, rendering in one harrowing instant null and
void the thousand petty plans and plots, intrigues and schemes,
upon which future social constructions on the social structure
had been based.</p>

<p>The grief and amazement of Major Belwether, already distracted
by his non-participation, through his own fault, in Plank's consolidation
of Amalgamated with Inter-County, was pitiable to the verge of
the unpleasant. Like panic-stricken rabbits, his thoughts ran
in circles, and he skipped in their wake, scurrying from Quarrier
to Harrington, from Harrington to Plank, from Plank to Siward,
in distracted hope of recovering his equilibrium and squatting
safely somewhere in somebody's luxuriantly perpetual cabbage-patch.
He even squeezed under the fence and hopped humbly about old Peter
Caithness, who suddenly assumed monumental proportions among those
who had so long tolerated him.</p>

<p>But Quarrier coldly drove him away and the increasing crowds
besieging poor, bewildered old Peter Caithness trod upon the major,
and there was nothing for him to do but to scuttle back to his
own brush-heap and huddle there, squeaking pitifully.</p>

<p>As for Grace Ferrall, she lost no time in tears, but took Agatha
publicly to her bosom, turned furiously on Quarrier in private,
and for the first time in her life permitted herself the luxury
of telling him exactly what she thought of him.</p>

<p>"You had your chance," she said; "but you are all surface! There's
nothing to you but soft beard and manicuring, and the reticence
of stupidity! The one girl for you&mdash;and you couldn't hold on to
her! The one chance of your life&mdash;and it's escaped you, leaving
a tuft of pompadour hair and a pair of woman's eyes protruding
from the golden dust-heap your father buried you in. Now you'd
better sit there and let it cover your mouth, and try to breathe
through your nose. Agatha is looking for a new sensation; she's
tried everything, now she's going to try you, that's all. She
will be an invaluable leader, Howard, and we shall not yawn, I
assure you. But, oh! the chance you've lost, for lack of a drop
of red blood, and a barber to give you the beard of a man!"</p>

<p>Which merely deepened the fear and hatred which Quarrier had
entertained for his pretty cousin from the depths of his silk-wadded
cradle. As for Kemp Ferrall, now third vice-president of Inter-County,
he only laughed with the tolerance of a man in safety; and, looking
at Quarrier through the pickets of the financial fence, not only
forgot how close his escape had been, but, being a busy and progressive
young man, began to consider how he might ultimately extract a
little profit from the expensive tenant of the enclosure.</p>

<p>Grace made the journey to town to express herself freely for
Sylvia's benefit; but when she saw Sylvia, the girl's radiant
beauty checked her, and all she could say was: "My dear! my dear,
I knew you would do it! I knew you would fling him on his head.
It's in your blood, you little jade! you little jilt! you mix
of a baggage! I knew you'd behave like all the women of your race!"</p>

<p>Sylvia held Mrs. Ferrall's pretty face impressed between both
her hands, and looking her mischievously in the eyes, she whispered:</p>

<p>"'Comme vous, maman, faut-il faire? &mdash;Eh! mes petits-enfants,
pourquoi, Quand j'ai fait comme ma grand' mère, Ne feriez-vous
pas comme moi?'"</p>

<p>"O Lord!" said Mrs. Ferrall, "I'll never meddle again&mdash;and the
entire world may marry and take the consequences!" Then she drove
to the Santa Regina, where Marion was to join her in her return
to Shotover; and she was already trying to make up her disturbed
mind as to which might prove the more suitable for Marion &mdash;Captain
Voucher, gloomily recovering from his defeat by Quarrier, or Billy
Fleetwood, who didn't want to marry anybody.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Siward's new duties as second vice-president
of Inter-County had given him scant leisure for open-air convalescence.
He was busy with Plank; he was also busy with the private investigation
stirred up at the Patroons' Club and the Lenox, and which was
slowly but inevitably resulting in clearing him, so that his restoration
to good standing and full membership remained now only a matter
of formal procedure.</p>

<p>So Siward was becoming a very busy man among men; and Plank,
still carrying on his broad shoulders burdens unbearable by any
man save such a man as he, shook his heavy head, and ordered Siward
into the open. And Siward, who had learned to obey, obeyed.</p>

<p>But September had nearly ended, when Leila, in Plank's private
car, attended by Siward and Sylvia and two trained nurses, arrived
at the Fells. The nurses &mdash;Plank's idea&mdash;were a surprise
to Leila; and the day after her arrival at the Fells she dismissed
them, got out of bed, and dressed and came downstairs all alone,
on a pair of sound though faltering legs.</p>

<p>Sylvia and Siward were in the music-room, very busily figuring
out the probable cost of a house in that section of the city east
of Park Avenue, where the newly married imprudent are forming
colonies&mdash;a just punishment for those reckless brides who marry
for love, and are obliged to drive over two car-tracks to reach
their wealthy friends and relatives of the Golden Zone.</p>

<p>And Leila, in her pretty invalid's gown of lace, stood silently
at the music-room door, watching them. Her thick, dark hair was
braided, and looped up under a black bow behind; and she looked
like a curious and impertinent schoolgirl peeping at them there
through the crack of the door, bending forward, her joined hands
flattened between her knees.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said at length, in a frankly disappointed voice, "is
that all you do when your chaperone is abed?"</p>

<p>"Angel!" cried Sylvia, springing up, "how in the world did you
ever manage to come downstairs?"</p>

<p>"On the usual number of feet. If you think it's very gay up there&mdash;" 
She laid her hands in Sylvia's, and looked at Siward with all
the old mockery in her eyes&mdash;eyes which slanted a little at the
corners, Japanese-wise: "Stephen, you are growing positively plump.
You'd better not do that until Sylvia marries you. Look at him,
dear! He's getting all smooth in the cheeks, like a horrid undergraduate
boy!"</p>

<p>She released one hand and greeted Siward. "Thank you," she said
serenely, replying to his inquiry, "I am perfectly well. You pay
me no compliment when you ask me, after you have seen me." And
to Sylvia, looking at her white flannels: "What have you been
playing? What do you find to do with yourself, Sylvia, with that
plump sun-burned boy at your heels all day long? Are there no
men about?"</p>

<p>"One's coming to-day," said Sylvia, laughing; and slipping her
arm around Leila's waist, she strolled with her out through the
tall glass doors to the terrace, with a backward glance of airy
dismissal for Siward.</p>

<p>Plank had wired from New York, the night before, that he was
coming; in another hour he would be there. Leila knew it perfectly
well, and she looked into the wickedly expressive young face of
the girl beside her, eyes soft but unsmiling.</p>

<p>"Child, child," she murmured, "you do not know how much of a
man a man can be!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!" said Sylvia hotly.</p>

<p>Leila smiled. "Hush, you little silly! I've talked Stephen and
praised Stephen to you for days and days, and the moment I dare
mention another man you fly at me, hair on end!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Leila, I know it! I'm perfectly mad about him, that's all.
But don't you think he is looking like himself again? And, Leila,
isn't he strangely attractive? &mdash;I don't mean just because
I happen to be in love with him, but give me a perfectly cold
and unbiassed opinion, dear, because there is simply no use in
a girl's blinding herself to facts, or in ignoring certain fixed
laws of symmetry, which it is perfectly obvious that Mr. Siward
fulfils in those well-known and established proportions which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sylvia!"</p>

<p>"What?" she asked, startled.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Only for two solid weeks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, if you are not interested&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I am, child &mdash;I am! desperately interested! He is handsome!
I knew him before you did, and I thought so then!"</p>

<p>"Did you?" said Sylvia, troubled.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. When I wore short skirts I kissed him, too!"</p>

<p>"Did you? <em>W&mdash;</em>what did he wear?"</p>

<p>"Knickerbockers, silly! You don't think he was still in the cradle,
do you? I'm not as aged as that!"</p>

<p>"I missed a great deal in my childhood," said Sylvia naïvely.</p>

<p>"By not knowing Stephen? Pooh! He used to pinch me, and then
we'd put out our tongues in mutual derision. Once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Sylvia faintly. "And anyhow, you probably taught
him. … Look at him as he saunters across the lawn, Leila&mdash;look
at him!"</p>

<p>"Well? I see him."</p>

<p>"Isn't he almost an ideal?"</p>

<p>"He is. He certainly is, dear."</p>

<p>"Do you think he walks as though he were perfectly well?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," said Leila thoughtfully. "Sometimes people
whose walk is a gracefully languid saunter develop adipose tissue
after forty."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Really, Leila, do you think he walks like a perfectly
well man?"</p>

<p>"He may be coming down with whooping-cough&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sylvia rose indignantly, but Leila pulled her back to the sun-warmed
marble bench:</p>

<p>"A girl in love loses her sense of humour temporarily. Sit down,
you little vixen!"</p>

<p>"Leila, you laugh at everything when I don't feel like it."</p>

<p>"I'm not in love, and that's why."</p>

<p>"You are in love!"</p>

<p>Leila looked at her, then under her breath: "In love, am <em>I&mdash;</em>with
the whole young world ringing with the laughter I had forgotten
the very sound of? Do you call that love?&mdash;with the sea and sky
laughing back at me, and the wind in my ears fairly tremulous
with laughter? Do you, who look out upon the pretty world so seriously
through those sea-blue eyes of yours, think that I can be in love?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Leila, a girl's happiness is serious enough, isn't it? Dear,
it frightens me! I was so close to losing it&mdash;once."</p>

<p>"I lost mine," said Leila, closing her eyes for a moment. "I
shall not sigh if I find it again."</p>

<p>They sat there in the sun, Leila's hand lying idly in Sylvia's,
the soft sea-wind stirring their hair, and in their ears the thunderous
undertone of the mounting sea.</p>

<p>"Look at Stephen!" murmured Sylvia, her enraptured eyes following
him as he strolled hatless and coatless along the cliff's edge,
the sun glimmering on his short hair, a tall, slim, well-coupled,
strongly knit shape against the sky and sea.</p>

<p>But Leila's quick ear had caught a significant sound from the
gravel drive behind her, and she stood up, a delicious colour
tinting her face.</p>

<p>"Are you going in?" asked Sylvia. Then she, too, heard the subdued
whirring of a motor from the front of the house, and she looked
at Leila as she turned and recrossed the terrace, walking slowly
but erect, her pretty head held high.</p>

<p>Then Sylvia faced the sea again and presently descended the terrace,
crossing the long lawn toward the headland, where Siward stood
looking out across the water.</p>

<p>Leila, from the music-room, watched her; then she heard Plank's
voice, and his step on the stair, and she called out to him gaily:</p>

<p>"I am downstairs, thank you. How dared you send me those foolish
nurses!"</p>

<p>She was laughing when he came into the room, standing there erect,
head high, a brilliant colour in her cheeks; and she offered him
both hands which he took between his own, holding them strongly,
and looking into her face with steady, questioning eyes.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said, still smiling, but her scarlet under-lip trembled
a little; then: "Yes, you may say what you wish&mdash;what I &mdash;I
wish you to say. … There can be no harm in talking about it. But&mdash;will
you be very gentle with me? Don't m-make me cry; I h-have &mdash;I
am t-trying to remember how it feels to laugh once more."</p>

<p>Sylvia, lying in the hot sand on the tiny crescent beach under
the cliffs, listened gravely to Siward's figures, as, note-book
in hand, he went over the real-estate problem, commenting thoughtfully
as he discussed the houses offered.</p>

<p>"Twenty by a hundred and two; good rear, north side of the street&mdash;next
door to the Tommy Barclays, you know, Sylvia; only they're asking
forty-two-five."</p>

<p>"That is an outrage!" said Sylvia seriously; "besides, I remember
there was a wretched cellar, and only a butler's pantry extension.
I'd much rather have that little house in Sixty-fourth Street,
where the Fetherbraynes live&mdash;next house on the west, you know.
Then we can pull it down and build&mdash;when we want to."</p>

<p>"We won't be able to afford to build for a while, you know,"
said Siward doubtfully.</p>

<p>"What do we care, dear? We'll have millions of things to do,
anyway, and what is the use of building?"</p>

<p>"As many things to do as that?" he said, looking over his note-book
with a smile.</p>

<p>"More! Are we not just beginning to live, and open our eyes,
silly? Listen: Books, books, books, from top to bottom of the
house, that is what I want first of all&mdash;except my piano."</p>

<p>"Do let us have a little plumbing, dear," he said so seriously
that for a fraction of a second she was on the verge of taking
him seriously.</p>

<p>"Why extravagant plumbing when books furnish sufficient circulation
for the flow of soul, dear?" she retorted gravely.</p>

<p>"Nobody we know will ever come to see us, if they think we read
books,"  said Siward.</p>

<p>"Isn't it delightful!" sighed Sylvia. "We're going to become
frumps! I mustn't forget the blue stockings for my trousseau,
and you mustn't forget the California claret for the cellar, dear.
We will need it when we read Henry James to each other."</p>

<p>Siward, resting his weight on one hand, laughed, and looked out
at the surf drenching the reefs with silver.</p>

<p>"To think," he said, "that I could ever have been enough afraid
of the sea to hate it! After all, at low tide the reef is always
there in the same place and none the worse for the drenching.
All that surf only shows how strong a rock can be."</p>

<p>He smiled, and turned to look at Sylvia; and she lay there, silent,
blue eyes looking back into his. Suddenly they glimmered with
tears, and she stretched out both arms, drawing his head down
to hers convulsively, her quivering mouth crushed against his
lips. Then she rose to her knees, to her feet, dazed, brushing
the tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>"To think&mdash;to think," she stammered, "that I might have let you
face the world alone! Dearest, dearest, we must fight a good fight.
The sea is always there&mdash;always, always there!"</p>

<p>He looked straight into her eyes, fearlessly, tenderly, and she
looked back with the divine, untroubled gaze of a child, laying
her slender, sun-tanned hands in his.</p>

<p>And, deep in his body, as he stood there, he heard the low challenge
of his soul on guard; and he knew that the Enemy listened.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>
