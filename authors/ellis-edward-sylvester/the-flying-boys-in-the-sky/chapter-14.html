<p>As straight downward as if fired from the zenith, a tiny missile
shot through the air so swiftly that no one saw it. It struck
the ground directly in front of the four men and burst with a
deafening report. In the same second, another followed the first,
landing just behind the group with the same terrifying explosion.
All saw the flash, the smoke and the flying particles.</p>

<p>Then a third and fourth followed with similar results. Succeeding
the fire and crash a voice rang out:</p>

<p>"Run for your lives! Take to the woods or you are dead men!"</p>

<p>The command, which sounded as if it came from heaven, acted like
an electric shock upon the four young men, who with gasps of dismay
dived in among the trees with such headlong panic that two dropped
their hats, and the others stumbled, crawling forward and scrambling
to their feet as best they could.</p>

<p>The bewildered Harvey might have done the same, for it seemed
the only way of escaping a frightful death, had he not fancied
there was a familiar note in the deep bass voice. When he looked
aloft, the strange occurrence was explained. Balanced directly
overhead and not more than a hundred feet high, floated a monoplane.
A slim man more than six feet tall and clothed in a long flapping
duster was standing erect with a small, oblong object in his hand
to which he had just applied a match. He let it hiss for a moment,
and then tossed it away so that it fell only a few feet from where
Harvey stood.</p>

<p>"Don’t be scared," he called; "I’m just practicing how to drop
a bomb on the deck of a vessel; these things make a loud noise
but nothing more."</p>

<p>As the delighted youth stared upward, he saw painted in glaring
letters on the under side of the single plane the words:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"<em>THE DRAGON OF THE SKIES</em>."

</p>

<p>"Aren’t you coming down to call?" asked Harvey. "No one could
be so welcome as you."</p>

<p>"So I judged from the way things looked; I have been up here
some time watching matters. You keeled over that brute beautifully."</p>

<p>"He is showing signs of revival."</p>

<p>"Stand a little out of the way and watch me help revive him."</p>

<p>Harvey, relieved beyond expression by the happy turn of affairs,
sprang several paces aside and watched his friend aloft. He was
still standing erect, balanced so perfectly in the calm that he
did not have to steady himself. The missiles which he had flung
to the earth were simply giant firecrackers, some six inches long
and more than an inch in diameter. He knew when he lighted the
powder-soaked string which served as a fuse how many seconds it
would require to reach the powder within. It has been shown how
accurate he was in his calculations.</p>

<p>Harvey saw the flicker of the smoking match as it was touched
to the short dangling twist of fuse attached to the cracker which
he held in his left hand beside his waist, while with one eye
closed he squinted along the red tube as if aiming a gun. Then
he parted his thumb and forefinger and the cracker tumbled downward
end over end, and either through extraordinary skill or by good
luck dropped upon the chest of Bill and burst with terrific force
and deafening noise.</p>

<p>It certainly "revived" the man, for with a howl he leaped to
his feet and plunged in among the trees in the wildest panic conceivable.
A fifty-pound bombshell would have caused more damage but could
not have created greater terror.</p>

<p>Harvey in the reaction of his spirits leaned against his biplane
to keep from falling through excessive mirth. He had never seen
anything so funny in his life. In the midst of his merriment,
Professor Milo Morgan called down:</p>

<p>"I must be off; good-bye; better not bother with such folks as
these."</p>

<p>"But, Professor, won’t you make me a call?"</p>

<p>"Haven’t time; other matters are awaiting me."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me anything about Bohunkus?"</p>

<p>"He’s round on the other side of the wood, waiting for you."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the elongated aviator extended one arm, so that
no doubt was left of the direction meant. Then he resumed his
seat, and the Dragon of the Skies darted into space like an eagle
diving from his mountain perch.</p>

<p>Harvey noticed again that swiftly as the man was speeding, his
monoplane seemed to emit no noise whatever. It was certainly a
remarkable muffler that enabled him to do this, and it explained
why none of the party below had any inkling of the crank’s proximity
until he made it known in the startling manner described. Moreover
his uplifter held him sustained without motion, as we sometimes
see a bird hovering over the ocean and preparing to dart downward
for its prey.</p>

<p>"He has made enough inventions already to give him riches beyond
estimate, but the fact seems to be the last to enter his head."</p>

<p>But Harvey could not forget his dusky comrade. Professor Morgan
had told where he could be found, provided he had not gone elsewhere
in the meantime. The five young men with whom the couple had had
their affray were still capable of making trouble. It was possible
that when they found none was harmed, they would return to look
into matters. The minutes were too valuable to be wasted.</p>

<p>Although the aeroplane had been exposed to danger it had suffered
no injury. Instead of procuring a brake, in the form of a prop
from the nearby wood, with which to hold the machine until momentum
was gathered, the young aviator whirled the propeller about, stepped
into his seat and grasped the control. The motor started at once
and sent out its deafening racket. The little rubber-tired wheels
began slowly turning and sped swiftly across the open space. Harvey
waited until he was going very fast, when he drew back the handle
and in the same instant felt he was traveling on nothing. Upward
and outward he shot to a height of three hundred feet, when he
circled about and came back over the wood, beyond which he glided
to the other side.</p>

<p>It was there he ought to find Bohunkus. Slowing his progress
as much as he could and still remain aloft, he scanned the earth
in quest of the colored youth. There was the stretch of woodland,
meadow and sparsely cultivated ground, with the small dwelling
in the distance, the landscape being crossed by a winding creek
which skirted the forest and lost itself far to the eastward.</p>

<p>But Bohunkus Johnson was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"Likely enough he has started off on a run again with nobody
chasing him and may not look behind until he has gone several
miles. It would serve him right if I left him to get home the
best he can. He has enough money to pay his way and—."</p>

<p>Harvey’s eye rested on a large maple lying on the edge of the
wood. It had fallen recently, for the foliage of the abundant
limbs was still green. The trunk, which must have been two feet
in diameter at the base, showed no branches for several yards,
but was held a little above the ground by the sturdy and bent
limbs upon which the greater weight was resting.</p>

<p>There was no particular reason why this object should interest
Harvey, but it did, and he scrutinized it closely, as he slowly
sailed past. Something moved, but so vaguely that he could not
identify it. The object appeared to be under the log in the open
space between it and the ground upon which it was supported. The
distance was so trifling that Harvey did not call his binoculars
into use.</p>

<p>The top of a person’s head, without a cap or covering except
a mass of black wool, and a pair of staring eyes, showed over
the top of the log. Their owner was watching the biplane, as if
uncertain of its identity. Had the individual remained stationary,
he would have come into clear view, as Harvey glided beyond him,
but before that could take place, he ducked under the maple, whisked
beneath, and raising his head, again peered over the trunk from
the other side. He did not speak, but evidently was mystified
and undecided what to do.</p>

<p>The amused Harvey curved about and then volplaned to the ground
within fifty paces of the fallen tree. As he did so, he saw Bohunkus
standing erect and grinning at him. He had donned his cap and
was delighted.</p>

<p>"Did I scare yo’?" he asked, going forward to meet his friend.</p>

<p>"Scare me? How could you do that?"</p>

<p>"I knowed it was yo’ all de time; I thought I’d have a little
fun wid yo’."</p>

<p>"What were you doing behind that log, Bunk?"</p>

<p>"Nuffin; I felt sorter tired and laid down to rest till yo’ come
along; I was getting out ob patience wid yo’; what made yo’ so
late?"</p>

<p>"I have been looking for you; those were queer performances on
your part."</p>

<p>"What oblusions am yo’ obluding to, Harv?"</p>

<p>"You gave that fellow the best thumping he ever had, and then
jumped up and ran off like a big coward."</p>

<p>"Didn’t run away from nobody; it was dem ’leben fellers wid dere
loaded guns dat was a chasing me like all creation; wouldn’t yo’
run yo’self?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if I had been attacked by such a force, but I stayed
behind and entertained the other four and there was only the one
that troubled you. What became of that fellow who tried so hard
to overtake you?"</p>

<p>"He’s dead," was the solemn answer of Bunk.</p>

<p>"What killed him?"</p>

<p>"Me," was the unblushing response; "I kept running till I got
him away from de oder nine, so dey couldn’t help him; den I whirled
about and lammed him so hard dat it was de last ob him; he’ll
neber insult any ’spectable colored gemman agin."</p>

<p>"Well, Bunk, I am afraid you will have to do your job over, for
I saw him only a little while ago. He may be near at hand this
minute."</p>

<p>And Harvey glanced around as if alarmed by the probability of
such a thing.</p>

<p>"Being dat am de way things stand, hadn’t we better emigrate,
Harv?" </p>
