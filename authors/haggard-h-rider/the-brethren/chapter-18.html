<p>Many a day had gone by since the brethren bade farewell to
Rosamund at Damascus. Now, one burning July night, they sat upon
their horses, the moonlight gleaming on their mail. Still as
statues they sat, looking out from a rocky mountain top across
that grey and arid plain which stretches from near Nazareth to
the lip of the hills at whose foot lies Tiberias on the Sea of
Galilee. Beneath them, camped around the fountain of Seffurieh,
were spread the hosts of the Franks to which they did sentinel;
thirteen hundred knights, twenty thousand foot, and hordes of
Turcopoles--that is, natives of the country, armed after the
fashion of the Saracens. Two miles away to the southeast
glimmered the white houses of Nazareth, set in the lap of the
mountains. Nazareth, the holy city, where for thirty years lived
and toiled the Saviour of the world. Doubtless, thought Godwin,
His feet had often trod that mountain whereon they stood, and in
the watered vales below His hands had sped the plow or reaped the
corn. Long, long had His voice been silent, yet to Godwin's ears
it still seemed to speak in the murmur of the vast camp, and to
echo from the slopes of the Galilean hills, and the words it said
were: "I bring not peace, but a sword."
</p>
<p>To-morrow they were to advance, so rumour said, across yonder
desert plain and give battle to Saladin, who lay with all his
power by Hattin, above Tiberias.
</p><p>Godwin and his brother thought that it was a madness; for they
had seen the might of the Saracens and ridden across that thirsty
plain beneath the summer sun. But who were they, two wandering,
unattended knights, that they should dare to lift up their voices
against those of the lords of the land, skilled from their birth
in desert warfare? Yet Godwin's heart was troubled and fear took
hold of him, not for himself, but for all the countless army that
lay asleep yonder, and for the cause of Christendom, which staked
its last throw upon this battle.
</p><p>"I go to watch yonder; bide you here," he said to Wulf, and,
turning the head of Flame, rode some sixty yards over a shoulder
of the rock to the further edge of the mountain which looked
towards the north. Here he could see neither the camp, nor Wulf,
nor any living thing, but indeed was utterly alone. Dismounting,
and bidding the horse stand, which it would do like a dog, he
walked forward a few steps to where there was a rock, and,
kneeling down, began to pray with all the strength of his pure,
warrior heart.
</p><p>"O Lord," he prayed, "Who once wast man and a dweller in these
mountains, and knowest what is in man, hear me. I am afraid for
all the thousands who sleep round Nazareth; not for myself, who
care nothing for my life, but for all those, Thy servants and my
brethren. Yes, and for the Cross upon which Thou didst hang, and
for the faith itself throughout the East. Oh! give me light! Oh!
let me hear and see, that I may warn them, unless my fears are
vain!"
</p><p>So he murmured to Heaven above and beat his hands against his
brow, praying, ever praying, as he had never prayed before, that
wisdom and vision might be given to his soul.
</p><p>It seemed to Godwin that a sleep fell on him--at least, his mind
grew clouded and confused. Then it cleared again, slowly, as
stirred water clears, till it was bright and still; yet another
mind to that which was his servant day by day which never could
see or hear those things he saw and heard in that strange hour.
Lo! he heard the spirits pass, whispering as they went;
whispering, and, as it seemed to him, weeping also for some great
woe which was to be; weeping yonder over Nazareth. Then like
curtains the veils were lifted from his eyes, and as they swung
aside he saw further, and yet further.
</p><p>He saw the king of the Franks in his tent beneath, and about him
the council of his captains, among them the fierce-eyed master of
the Templars, and a man whom he had seen in Jerusalem where they
had been dwelling, and knew for Count Raymond of Tripoli, the
lord of Tiberias. They were reasoning together, till, presently,
in a rage, the Master of the Templars drew his sword and dashed
it down upon the table.
</p><p>Another veil was lifted, and lo! he saw the camp of Saladin, the
mighty, endless camp, with its ten thousand tents, amongst which
the Saracens cried to Allah through all the watches of the night.
He saw the royal pavilion, and in it the Sultan walked to and fro
alone--none of his emirs, not even his son, were with him. He was
lost in thought, and Godwin read his thought.
</p><p>It was: "Behind me the Jordan and the Sea of Galilee, into which,
if my flanks were turned, I should be driven, I and all my host.
In front the territories of the Franks, where I have no friend;
and by Nazareth their great army. Allah alone can help me. If
they sit still and force me to advance across the desert and
attack them before my army melts away, then I am lost. If they
advance upon me round the Mountain Tabor and by the watered land,
I may be lost. But if--oh! if Allah should make them mad, and
they should strike straight across the desert--then, then they
are lost, and the reign of the Cross in Syria is forever at an
end. I will wait here. I will wait here. . ."
</p><p>Look! near to the pavilion of Saladin stood another tent, closely
guarded, and in it on a cushioned bed lay two women. One was
Rosamund, but she slept sound; and the other was Masouda, and she
was waking, for her eyes met his in the darkness.
</p><p>The last veil was withdrawn, and now Godwin saw a sight at which
his soul shivered. A fire-blackened plain, and above it a
frowning mountain, and that mountain thick, thick with dead,
thousands and thousands and thousands of dead, among which the
hyenas wandered and the night-birds screamed. He could see their
faces, many of them he knew again as those of living men whom he
had met in Jerusalem and elsewhere, or had noted with the army.
He could hear also the moanings of the few who were yet alive.
</p><p>About that field--yes, and in the camp of Saladin, where lay more
dead--his body seemed to wander searching for something, he knew
not what, till it came to him that it was the corpse of Wulf for
which he sought and found it not--nay, nor his own either. Then
once more he heard the spirits pass--a very great company, for to
them were gathered all those dead--heard them pass away, wailing,
ever more faintly wailing for the lost cause of Christ, wailing
over Nazareth.
</p><p>Godwin awoke from his dream trembling, mounted his horse, and
rode back to Wulf. Beneath, as before, lay the sleeping camp,
yonder stretched the brown desert, and there sat Wulf watching
both.
</p><p>"Tell me," asked Godwin, "how long is it since I left you?"
</p><p>"Some few minutes--ten perhaps," answered his brother.
</p><p>"A short while to have seen so much," replied Godwin. Then Wulf
looked at him curiously and asked:
</p><p>"What have you seen?"
</p><p>"If I told you, Wulf, you would not believe."
</p><p>"Tell me, and I will say."
</p><p>So Godwin told him all, and at the end asked him, "What think
you?"
</p><p>Wulf considered awhile, and answered:
</p><p>"Well, brother, you have touched no wine to-day, so you are not
drunk, and you have done nothing foolish, so you are not mad.
Therefore it would seem that the saints have been talking to you,
or, at least, so I should think of any other man whom I knew to
be as good as you are. Yet it is folk like you that see visions,
and those visions are not always true, for sometimes, I believe,
the devil is their showman. Our watch is ended, for I hear the
horses of the knights who come to relieve us. Listen; this is my
counsel. In the camp yonder is our friend with whom we travelled
from Jerusalem, Egbert, the bishop of Nazareth, who marches with
the host. Let us go to him and lay this matter before him, for he
is a holy man and learned; no false, self-seeking priest."
</p><p>Godwin nodded in assent, and presently, when the other knights
were come and they had made their report to them, they rode off
together to the tent of Egbert, and, leaving their horses in
charge of a servant, entered.
</p><p>Egbert was an Englishman who had spent more than thirty years of
his life in the East, whereof the suns had tanned his wrinkled
face to the hue of bronze, that seemed the darker in contrast
with his blue eyes and snow-white hair and beard. Entering the
tent, they found him at his prayers before a little image of the
Virgin, and stood with bowed heads until he had finished.
Presently he rose, and greeting them with a blessing, asked them
what they needed.
</p><p>"Your counsel, holy father," answered Wulf. "Godwin, set out your
tale."
</p><p>So, having seen that the tent flap was closed and that none
lingered near, Godwin told him his dream.
</p><p>The old man listened patiently, nor did he seem surprised at this
strange story, since in those days men saw--or thought they
saw--many such visions, which were accepted by the Church as
true.
</p><p>When he had finished Godwin asked of him as he had asked of Wulf:
"What think you, holy father? Is this a dream, or is it a
message? And if so, from whom comes the message?"
</p><p>"Godwin D'Arcy," he answered, "in my youth I knew your father. It
was I who shrove him when he lay dying of his wounds, and a
nobler soul never passed from earth to heaven. After you had left
Damascus, when you were the guest of Saladin, we dwelt together
in the same lodging in Jerusalem, and together we travelled here,
during all which time I learned to know you also as the worthy
son of a worthy sire--no dissolute knight, but a true servant of
the Church. It well may be that to such a one as you foresight
has been given, that through you those who rule us may be warned,
and all Christendom saved from great sorrow and disgrace. Come;
let us go to the king, and tell this story, for he still sits in
council yonder."
</p><p>So they went out together and rode to the royal tent. Here the
bishop was admitted, leaving them without.
</p><p>Presently he returned and beckoned to them, and as they passed,
the guards whispered to them:
</p><p>"A strange council, sirs, and a fateful!"
</p><p>Already it was near midnight, but still the great pavilion was
crowded with barons and chief captains who sat in groups, or sat
round a narrow table made of boards placed upon trestles. At the
head of that table sat the king, Guy of Lusignan, a weak-faced
man, clad in splendid armour. On his right was the white-haired
Count Raymond of Tripoli, and on his left the black-bearded,
frowning Master of the Templars, clad in his white mantle on the
left breast of which the red cross was blazoned.
</p><p>Words had been running high, their faces showed it, but just then
a silence reigned as though the disputants were weary, and the
king leaned back in his chair, passing his hand to and fro across
his forehead. He looked up, and seeing the bishop, asked
peevishly:
</p><p>"What is it now? Oh! I remember, some tale from those tall twin
knights. Well, bring them forward and speak it out, for we have
no time to lose."
</p><p>So the three of them came forward and at Godwin's prayer the
bishop Egbert told of the vision that had come to him not more
than an hour ago while he kept watch upon the mountain top. At
first one or two of the barons seemed disposed to laugh, but when
they looked at Godwin's high and spiritual face, their laughter
died away, for it did not seem wonderful to them that such a man
should see visions. Indeed, as the tale of the rocky hill and the
dead who were stretched upon it went on, they grew white with
fear, and whitest of them all was the king, Guy of Lusignan.
</p><p>"Is all this true, Sir Godwin?" he asked, when the bishop had
finished.
</p><p>"It is true, my lord king," answered Godwin.
</p><p>"His word is not enough," broke in the Master of the Templars.
"Let him swear to it on the Holy Rood, knowing that if he lies it
will blast his soul to all eternity." And the council muttered,
"Ay, let him swear."
</p><p>Now there was an annexe to the tent, rudely furnished as a
chapel, and at the end of this annexe a tall, veiled object.
Rufinus, the bishop of Acre, who was clad in the armour of a
knight, went to the object, and drawing the veil, revealed a
broken, blackened cross, set around with jewels, that stood
about the height of a man above the ground, for all the
lower part was gone.
</p><p>At the sight of it Godwin and every man present there fell upon
his knees, for since St. Helena found it, over seven centuries
before, this had been accounted the most precious relic in all
Christendom; the very wood upon which the Saviour suffered, as,
indeed, it may have been.
</p><p>Millions had worshipped it, tens of thousands had died for it,
and now, in the hour of this great struggle between Christ and
the false prophet it was brought from its shrine that the host
which escorted it might prove invincible in battle. Soldiers who
fought around the very Cross could not be defeated, they said,
for, if need were, legions of angels would come to aid them.
</p><p>Godwin and Wulf stared at the relic with wonder, fear, and
adoration. There were the nail marks, there was the place where
the scroll of Pilate had been affixed above the holy head--almost
could they seem to see that Form divine and dying.
</p><p>"Now," broke in the voice of the Master of the Templars, "let Sir
Godwin D'Arcy swear to the truth of his tale upon this Rood."
</p><p>Rising from his knees Godwin advanced to the Cross, and laying
his hand upon the wood, said: "Upon the very Rood I swear that
not much more than an hour ago I saw the vision which has been
told to the king's highness and to all; that I believe this
vision was sent to me in answer to my prayer to preserve our host
and the holy city from the power of the Saracen, and that it is a
true foreshadowing of what will come about should we advance upon
the Sultan. I can say no more. I swear, knowing that if I lie
eternal damnation is my doom."
</p><p>The bishop drew back the covering over the Cross, and in silence
the council took their seats again about the table. Now the king
was very pale, and fearful; indeed a gloom lay upon all of them.
</p><p>"It would seem," he said, "that here a messenger has been sent to
us from heaven. Dare we disobey his message?"
</p><p>The Grand Templar lifted his rugged, frowning face. "A messenger
from heaven, said you, king? To me he seems more like a messenger
from Saladin. Tell us, Sir Godwin, were not you and your brother
once the Sultan's guests at Damascus?"
</p><p>"That is so, my lord Templar. We left before the war was
declared."
</p><p>"And," went on the Master, "were you not officers of the Sultan's
bodyguard?"
</p><p>Now all looked intently at Godwin, who hesitated a little,
foreseeing how his answer would be read, whereon Wulf spoke in
his loud voice:
</p><p>"Ay, we acted as such for awhile, and--doubtless you have heard
the story--saved Saladin's life when he was attacked by the
Assassins."
</p><p>"Oh!" said the Templar with bitter sarcasm, "you saved Saladin's
life, did you? I can well believe it. You, being Christians, who
above everything should desire the death of Saladin, saved his
life! Now, Sir Knights, answer me one more question--"
</p><p>"Sir Templar, with my tongue or with my sword?" broke in Wulf,
but the king held up his hand and bade him be silent.
</p><p>"A truce to your tavern ruffling, young sir, and answer," went on
the Templar. "Or, rather, do you answer, Sir Godwin. Is your
cousin, Rosamund, the daughter of Sir Andrew D'Arcy, a niece of
Saladin, and has she been created by him princess of Baalbec, and
is she at this moment in his city of Damascus?"
</p><p>"She is his niece," answered Godwin quietly; "she is the princess
of Baalbec, but at this moment she is not in Damascus."
</p><p>"How do you know that, Sir Godwin?"
</p><p>"I know it because in the vision of which you have been told I
saw her sleeping in a tent in the camp of Saladin."
</p><p>Now the council began to laugh, but Godwin, with a set, white
face, went on:
</p><p>"Ay, my lord Templar, and near that very blazoned tent I saw
scores of the Templars and of the Hospitallers lying dead.
Remember it when the dreadful hour comes and you see them also."
</p><p>Now the laughter died away, and a murmur of fear ran round the
board, mixed with such words as "Wizardry." "He has learnt it
from the Paynims." "A black sorcerer, without doubt."
</p><p>Only the Templar, who feared neither man nor spirit, laughed, and
gave him the lie with his eyes.
</p><p>"You do not believe me," said Godwin, "nor will you believe me
when I say that while I was on guard on yonder hill-top I saw you
wrangling with the Count of Tripoli--ay, and draw your sword and
dash it down in front of him upon this very table."
</p><p>Now again the council stared and muttered, for they too had seen
this thing; but the Master answered:
</p><p>"He may have learnt it otherwise than from an angel. Folk have
been in and out of this tent. My lord king, have we more time to
waste upon these visions of a knight of whom all we know for
certain is, that like his brother, he has been in the service of
Saladin, which they left, he says, in order to fight against him
in this war. It may be so; it is not for us to judge; though were
the times different I would inform against Sir Godwin D'Arcy as a
sorcerer, and one who has been in traitorous communication with
our common foe."
</p><p>"And I would thrust the lie down your throat with my sword's
point!" shouted Wulf.
</p><p>But Godwin only shrugged: his shoulders and said nothing, and the
Master went on, taking no heed.
</p><p>"King, we await your word, and it must be spoken soon, for in
four hours it will be dawn. Do we march against Saladin like
bold, Christian men, or do we bide here like cowards?"
</p><p>Then Count Raymond of Tripoli rose, and said:
</p><p>"Before you answer, king, hear me, if it be for the last time,
who am old in war and know the Saracens. My town of Tiberias is
sacked; my vassals have been put to the sword by thousands; my
wife is imprisoned in her citadel, and soon must yield, if she be
not rescued. Yet I say to you, and to the barons here assembled,
better so than that you should advance across the desert to
attack Saladin. Leave Tiberias to its fate and my wife with it,
and save your army, which is the last hope of the Christians of
the East. Christ has no more soldiers in these lands, Jerusalem
has no other shield. The army of the Sultan is larger than yours;
his cavalry are more skilled. Turn his flank--or, better still,
bide here and await his attack, and victory will be to the
soldiers of the Cross. Advance and the vision of that knight at
whom you scoff will come true, and the cause of Christendom be
lost in Syria. I have spoken, and for the last time."
</p><p>"Like his friend the knight of Visions," sneered the Grand
Master, "the count Raymond is an old ally of Saladin. Will you
take such coward council? On--on! and smite these heathen dogs,
or be forever shamed. On, in the name of the Cross! The Cross is
with us!"
</p><p>"Ay," answered Raymond, "for the last time."
</p><p>Then there arose a tumult through which every man shouted to his
fellow, some saying one thing and some another, while the king
sat at the head of the board, his face hidden in his hands.
Presently he lifted it, and said:
</p><p>"I command that we march at dawn. If the count Raymond and these
brethren think the words unwise, let them leave us and remain
here under guard until the issue be known."
</p><p>Now followed a great silence, for all there knew that the words
were fateful, in the midst of which Count Raymond said:
</p><p>"Nay, I go with you," while Godwin echoed, "And we go also to
show whether or not we are the spies of Saladin."
</p><p>Of these speeches none of them seemed to take heed, for all were
lost in their own thoughts. One by one they rose, bowed to the
king, and left the tent to give their commands and rest awhile,
before it was time to ride. Godwin and Wulf went also, and with
them the bishop of Nazareth, who wrung his hands and seemed ill
at ease. But Wulf comforted him, saying:
</p><p>"Grieve no more, father; let us think of the joy of battle, not
of the sorrow by which it may be followed."
</p><p>"I find no joy in battles," answered the holy Egbert.
</p><p>When they had slept awhile, Godwin and Wulf rose and fed their
horses. After they had washed and groomed them, they tested and
did on their armour, then took them down to the spring to drink
their fill, as their masters did. Also Wulf, who was cunning in
war, brought with him four large wineskins which he had provided
against this hour, and filling them with pure water, fastened two
of them with thongs behind the saddle of Godwin and two behind
his own. Further, he filled the water-bottles at their
saddle-bows, saying:
</p><p>"At least we will be among the last to die of thirst."
</p><p>Then they went back and watched the host break its camp, which it
did with no light heart, for many of them knew of the danger in
which they stood; moreover, the tale of Godwin's vision had been
spread abroad. Not knowing where to go, they and Egbert, the
bishop of Nazareth--who was unarmed and rode upon a mule, for
stay behind he would not--joined themselves to the great body of
knights who followed the king. As they did so, the Templars, five
hundred strong, came up, a fierce and gallant band, and the
Master, who was at their head, saw the brethren and called out,
pointing to the wineskins which were hung behind their saddles:
</p><p>"What do these water-carriers here among brave knights who trust
in God alone?"
</p><p>Wulf would have answered, but Godwin bade him be silent, saying:
</p><p>"Fall back; we will find less ill-omened company."
</p><p>So they stood on one side and bowed themselves as the Cross went
by, guarded by the mailed bishop of Acre. Then came Reginald of
Chatillon, Saladin's enemy, the cause of all this woe, who saw
them and cried:
</p><p>"Sir Knights, whatever they may say, I know you for brave men,
for I have heard the tale of your doings among the Assassins.
There is room for you among my suite--follow me."
</p><p>"As well him as another," said Godwin. "Let us go where we are
led." So they followed him.
</p><p>By the time that the army reached Kenna, where once the water was
made wine, the July sun was already hot, and the spring was so
soon drunk dry that many men could get no water. On they pushed
into the desert lands below, which lay between them and Tiberias,
and were bordered on the right and left by hills. Now clouds of
dust were seen moving across the plains, and in the heart of them
bodies of Saracen horsemen, which continually attacked the
vanguard under Count Raymond, and as continually retreated before
they could be crushed, slaying many with their spears and arrows.
Also these came round behind them, and charged the rearguard,
where marched the Templars and the light-armed troops named
Turcopoles, and the band of Reginald de Chatillon, with which
rode the brethren.
</p><p>From noon till near sundown the long harassed line, broken now
into fragments, struggled forward across the rough, stony plain,
the burning heat beating upon their armour till the air danced
about it as it does before a fire. Towards evening men and horses
became exhausted, and the soldiers cried to their captains to
lead them to water. But in that place there was no water. The
rearguard fell behind, worn out with constant attacks that must
be repelled in the burning heat, so that there was a great gap
between it and the king who marched in the centre. Messages
reached them to push on, but they could not, and at length camp
was pitched in the desert near a place called Marescalcia, and
upon this camp Raymond and his vanguard were forced back. As
Godwin and Wulf rode up, they saw him come in bringing his
wounded with him, and heard him pray the king to push on and at
all hazards to cut his way through to the lake, where they might
drink--ay, and heard the king say that he could not, since the
soldiers would march no more that day. Then Raymond wrung his
hands in despair and rode back to his men, crying aloud:
</p><p>"Alas! alas! Oh! Lord God, alas! We are dead, and Thy Kingdom is
lost."
</p><p>That night none slept, for all were athirst, and who can sleep
with a burning throat? Now also Godwin and Wulf were no longer
laughed at because of the water-skins they carried on their
horses. Rather did great nobles come to them, and almost on their
knees crave for the boon of a single cup. Having watered their
horses sparingly from a bowl, they gave what they could, till at
length only two skins remained, and one of these was spilt by a
thief, who crept up and slashed it with his knife that he might
drink while the water ran to waste. After this the brethren drew
their swords and watched, swearing that they would kill any man
who so much as touched the skin which was left. All that long
night through there arose a confused clamour from the camp, of
which the burden seemed to be, "Water! Give us water!" while from
without came the shouts of the Saracens calling upon Allah. Here,
too, the hot ground was covered with scrub dried to tinder by the
summer drought, and to this the Saracens set fire so that the
smoke rolled down on the Christian host and choked them, and the
place became a hell.
</p><p>Day dawned at last; and the army was formed up in order of
battle, its two wings being thrown forward. Thus they struggled
on, those of them that were not too weak to stir, who were
slaughtered as they lay. Nor as yet did the Saracens attack them,
since they knew that the sun was stronger than all their spears.
On they laboured towards the northern wells, till about mid-day
the battle began with a flight of arrows so thick that for awhile
it hid the heavens.
</p><p>After this came charge and counter-charge, attack and repulse,
and always above the noise of war that dreadful cry for water.
What chanced Godwin and Wulf never knew, for the smoke and dust
blinded them so that they could see but a little way. At length
there was a last furious charge, and the knights with whom they
were clove the dense mass of Saracens like a serpent of steel,
leaving a broad trail of dead behind them. When they pulled rein
and wiped the sweat from their eyes it was to find themselves
with thousands of others upon the top of a steep hill, of which
the sides were thick with dry grass and bush that already was
being fired.
</p><p>"The Rood! The Rood! Rally round the Rood!" said a voice, and
looking behind them they saw the black and jewelled fragment of
the true Cross set upon a rock, and by it the bishop of Acre.
Then the smoke of the burning grass rose up and hid it from their
sight.
</p><p>Now began one of the most hideous fights that is told of in the
history of the world. Again and again the Saracens attacked in
thousands, and again and again they were driven back by the
desperate valour of the Franks, who fought on, their jaws agape
with thirst. A blackbearded man stumbled up to the brethren, his
tongue protruding from his lips, and they knew him for the Master
of the Templars.
</p><p>"For the love of Christ, give me to drink," he said, recognizing
them as the knights at whom he had mocked as water-carriers.
</p><p>They gave him of the little they had left, and while they and
their horses drank the rest themselves, saw him rush down the
hill refreshed, shaking his red sword. Then came a pause, and
they heard the voice of the bishop of Nazareth, who had clung to
them all this while, saying, as though to himself:
</p><p>"And here it was that the Saviour preached the Sermon on the
Mount. Yes, He preached the words of peace upon this very spot.
Oh! it cannot be that He will desert us--it cannot be."
</p><p>While the Saracens held off, the soldiers began to put up the
king's pavilion, and with it other tents, around the rock on
which stood the Cross.
</p><p>"Do they mean to camp here?" asked Wulf bitterly.
</p><p>"Peace," answered Godwin; "they hope to make a wall about the
Rood. But it is of no avail, for this is the place of my dream."
</p><p>Wulf shrugged his shoulders. "At least, let us die well," he
said.
</p><p>Then the last attack began. Up the hillside rose dense volumes of
smoke, and with the smoke came the Saracens. Thrice they were
driven back; thrice they came on. At the fourth onset few of the
Franks could fight more, for thirst had conquered them on this
waterless hill of Hattin. They lay down upon the dry grass with
gaping jaws and protruding tongues, and let themselves be slain or
taken prisoners. A great company of Saracen horsemen broke
through the ring and rushed at the scarlet tent. It rocked to and
fro, then down it fell in a red heap, entangling the king in its
folds.
</p><p>At the foot of the Cross, Rufinus, the bishop of Acre, still
fought on bravely. Suddenly an arrow struck him in the throat,
and throwing his arms wide, he fell to earth. Then the Saracens
hurled themselves upon the Rood, tore it from its place, and with
mockery and spittings bore it down the hill towards their camp,
as ants may be seen carrying a little stick into their nest,
while all who were left alive of the Christian army stared
upwards, as though they awaited some miracle from Heaven. But no
angels appeared in the brazen sky, and knowing that God had
deserted them, they groaned aloud in their shame and
wretchedness.
</p><p>"Come," said Godwin to Wulf in a strange, quiet voice. "We have
seen enough. It is time to die. Look! yonder below us are the
Mameluks, our old regiment, and amongst them Saladin, for I see
his banner. Having had water, we and our horses are still fresh
and strong. Now, let us make an end of which they will tell in
Essex yonder. Charge for the flag of Saladin!"
</p><p>Wulf nodded, and side by side they sped down the hill. Scimitars
flashed at them, arrows struck upon their mail and the shields
blazoned with the Death's-head D'Arcy crest. Through it all they
went unscathed, and while the army of the Saracens stared, at the
foot of the Horn of Hattin turned their horses' heads straight
for the royal standard of Saladin. On they struggled, felling or
riding down a foe at every stride. On, still on, although Flame
and Smoke bled from a score of wounds.
</p><p>They were among the Mameluks, where their line was thin; by
Heaven! they were through them, and riding straight at the
well-known figure of the Sultan, mounted on his white horse with
his young son and his emir, the prince Hassan, at his side.
</p><p>"Saladin for you, Hassan for me," shouted Wulf.
</p><p>Then they met, and all the host of Islam cried out in dismay as
they saw the Commander of the Faithful and his horse borne to the
earth before the last despairing charge of these mad Christian
knights. Another instant, and the Sultan was on his feet again,
and a score of scimitars were striking at Godwin. His horse Flame
sank down dying, but he sprang from the saddle, swinging the long
sword. Now Saladin recognized the crest upon his buckler, and
cried out:
</p><p>"Yield you, Sir Godwin! You have done well--yield you!"
</p><p>But Godwin, who would not yield, answered:
</p><p>"When I am dead--not before."
</p><p>Thereupon Saladin spoke a word, and while certain of his Mameluks
engaged Godwin in front, keeping out of reach of that red and
terrible sword, others crept up behind, and springing on him,
seized his arms and dragged him to the ground, where they bound
him fast.
</p><p>Meanwhile Wulf had fared otherwise, for it was his horse Smoke,
already stabbed to the vitals, that fell as he plunged on prince
Hassan. Yet he also arose but little hurt, and cried out:
</p><p>"Thus, Hassan, old foe and friend, we meet at last in war. Come,
I would pay the debt I owe you for that drugged wine, man to man
and sword to sword."
</p><p>"Indeed, it is due, Sir Wulf," answered the prince, laughing.
"Guards, touch not this brave knight who has dared so much to
reach me. Sultan, I ask a boon. Between Sir Wulf and me there is
an ancient quarrel that can only be washed away in blood. Let it
be decided here and now, and let this be your decree--that if I
fall in fair fight, none shall set upon my conqueror, and no
vengeance shall be taken for my blood."
</p><p>"Good," said Saladin. "Then Sir Wulf shall be my prisoner and no
more, as his brother is already. I owe it to the men who saved my
life when we were friends. Give the Frank to drink that the fight
may be fair."
</p><p>So they gave Wulf a cup of which he drank, and when he had done
it was handed to Godwin. For even the Mameluks knew and loved
these brethren who had been their officers, and praised the
fierce charge that they had dared to make alone.
</p><p>Hassan sprang to the ground, saying:
</p><p>"Your horse is dead, Sir Wulf, so we must fight afoot."
</p><p>"Generous as ever," laughed Wulf. "Even the poisoned wine was a
gift!"
</p><p>"If so, for the last time, I fear me," answered Hassan with a
smile.
</p><p>Then they faced each other, and oh! the scene was strange. Up on
the slopes of Hattin the fight still raged. There amidst the
smoke and fires of the burning grass little companies of soldiers
stood back to back while the Saracens wheeled round them,
thrusting and cutting at them till they fell. Here and there
knights charged singly or in groups, and so came to death or
capture. About the plain hundreds of foot soldiers were being
slaughtered, while their officers were taken prisoners. Towards
the camp of Saladin a company advanced with sounds of triumph,
carrying aloft a black stump which was the holy Rood, while
others drove or led mobs of prisoners, among them the king and
his chosen knights.
</p><p>The wilderness was red with blood, the air was rent with shouts
of victory and cries of agony or despair. And there, in the midst
of it all, ringed round with grave, courteous Saracens, stood the
emir, clad above his mail in his white robe and jewelled turban,
facing the great Christian knight, with harness hacked and
reddened, the light of battle shining in his fierce eyes, and a
smile upon his stained features.
</p><p>For those who watched the battle was forgotten--or, rather, its
interest was centred on this point.
</p><p>"It will be a good fight," said one of them to Godwin, whom they
had suffered to rise, "for though your brother is the younger and
the heavier man, he is hurt and weary, whereas the emir is fresh
and unwounded. Ah! they are at it!"
</p><p>Hassan had struck first and the blow went home. Falling upon the
point of Wulf's steel helm, the heavy, razoredged scimitar
glanced from it and shore away the links from the flap which hung
upon his shoulder, causing the Frank to stagger. Again he struck,
this time upon the shield, and so heavily that Wulf came to his
knees.
</p><p>"Your brother is sped," said the Saracen captain to Godwin, but
Godwin only answered:
</p><p>"Wait."
</p><p>As he spoke Wulf twisted his body out of reach of a third blow,
and while Hassan staggered forward with the weight of the missed
stroke, placed his hand upon the ground, and springing to his
feet, ran backwards six or eight paces.
</p><p>"He flies!" cried the Saracens; but again Godwin said, "Wait."
Nor was there long to wait.
</p><p>For now, throwing aside his buckler and grasping the great sword
in both his hands, with a shout of "A D'Arcy! A D'Arcy!" Wulf
leapt at Hassan as a wounded lion leaps. The sword wheeled and
fell, and lo! the shield of the Saracen was severed in two. Again
it fell, and his turbaned helm was cloven. A third time, and the
right arm and shoulder with the scimitar that grasped it seemed
to spring from his body, and Hassan sank dying to the ground.
</p><p>Wulf stood and looked at him, while a murmur of grief went up
from those who watched, for they loved this emir. Hassan beckoned
to the victor with his left hand, and throwing down his sword to
show that he feared no treachery, Wulf came to him and knelt
beside him.
</p><p>"A good stroke," Hassan said faintly, "that could shear the
double links of Damascus steel as though it were silk. Well, as I
told you long ago, I knew that the hour of our meeting in war
would be an ill hour for me, and my debt is paid. Farewell, brave
knight. Would I could hope that we should meet in Paradise! Take
that star jewel, the badge of my House, from my turban and wear
it in memory of me. Long, long and happy be your days."
</p><p>Then, while Wulf held him in his arms, Saladin came up and spoke
to him, till he fell back and was dead.
</p><p>Thus died Hassan, and thus ended the battle of Hattin, which
broke the power of the Christians in the East.
