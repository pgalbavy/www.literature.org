<p>The tunnel through which Ashman propelled the canoe containing
himself and Ariel, was more than a hundred yards in length.  It
was only for the smallest distance that the craft was in darkness,
when the water began to reflect light and reveal its outlines.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the tunnel was passed, and they debouched
into an expansion of the enchanted lake.  The second division
was similar to the other and almost as large, but its appearance
was tenfold more wonderful.</p>

<p>The sheet of water may be said to have been divided into two
nearly equal parts by the narrow tunnel running under the mass
of rocks described.  One division was in the outer air, after
the usual fashion of lakes, while the other was wholly underground.</p>

<p>The interior lake was nearly circular in shape, with an arching
roof hundreds of feet high.  It was surrounded by towering crags,
and volcanic masses of stone, which gave it an appearance different
from anything on which Fred Ashman had ever looked.  Nothing grander,
wilder, more picturesque or romantic can be conceived.  It was
a scene which an explorer could stand for hours and contemplate
in rapt admiration.</p>

<p>But the most amazing feature of this underground lake was the
way in which it was illuminated, so that every portion stood out
in as bold relief as if under the flaming sun of mid-day.</p>

<p>At the western side, the shore, as was the case in nearly all
other directions, was a mass of jagged rocks, piled upon each
other in the wildest confusion.  Beyond these rocks, was a vast
chasm above the level of the lake, and extending right and left
for a distance of fifty rods.  This huge chasm was one mass of
crimson light, whose rays pierced every nook and cranny on every
side of the lake.</p>

<p>The eye gazing in that direction saw something similar to that
which greets the traveller in the far north, when viewing the
play of the aurora borealis in the horizon, or when the red sun
is rising from its ocean bed.</p>

<p>This enormous opening was so surcharged with light that Ashman,
after contemplating it but a minute or two, did not need to ask
its source. Beyond the area of illumination was the burning mountain
whose blood-red glow covered the entire surface and shores of
the underground portion of the enchanted lake.  The volcano had
been aflame for ages, and was likely to continue to burn for centuries
to come.</p>

<p>Such an eternal conflagration must have an outlet for the vast
quantity of vapor generated, and Ashman wondered that he had not
noticed the ascending smoke on his way thither.  He recalled that
when he and his friend were coming up the Xingu, far below the
last rapids, they observed a dark cloud resting in the western
horizon.  There was no thought at that time that it was caused
by a burning mountain, but such must have been the fact.  The
most singular fact was, that while on his way across the lake
to the tunnel, he had failed to notice and remark it.</p>

<p>There was a steady draft in the direction of the flaming cavern. 
He had observed it while paddling through the tunnel where it
was strong enough to assist in the propulsion of the canoe.  It
was caused by the ascent of the vapor through the chimney of the
fiery mountain, and averted the intolerable heat that otherwise
would have been felt over every portion of the lake.  As it was,
a moderate increase of temperature was perceptible.</p>

<p>Ashman was tempted to paddle the canoe to the black rocks which
separated the chasm from the lake, and he timidly moved the blade,
restrained by the fear of something in the nature of a "back draft,"
which might consume them before they could escape.</p>

<p>Ariel assured him that she had never encountered or heard of
anything of the kind, though she had often visited this remarkable
region in the company of her father.  Thereupon Ashman sent the
boat ahead faster than before, and a minute later the bow touched
the rocky wharf.</p>

<p>Stepping out, he drew the bow upon the rocks, so as to hold it
fast, and, extending his hand, assisted her to shore.  Then he
drew the craft still further up, and, taking her hand again in
his own, began picking their way over the jagged bowlders and
stones to the edge of the volcano.</p>

<p>From the margin of the lake to the other side of the mass of
rocks was a hundred feet.  This may be defined as a solid wall,
shutting out the water from the burning mountain.  The rocks rose
to a height of a dozen rods or so, attaining which a spectator
found himself half-way across the dividing ridge, where, viewed
from the lake, his figure looked as if stamped in ink on the crimson
background.</p>

<p>It was here that the lovers paused and viewed the striking picture
spread out before their vision.</p>

<p>That which they saw might properly be considered the crater of
the volcano.  It was four or five acres in extent, irregular in
contour, and so filled with gases and vapors that one could not
see the bottom, while the jagged boundary on the farther side
came out to view only at intervals, when the obstructing smoke
was swept aside.</p>

<p>Spiral columns of black vapor twisted swiftly upward from the
fiery depths, sometimes side by side, and sometimes they would
unite and climb toward the opening above, like a couple of huge
serpents struggling together.  The air quivered and pulsated in
certain portions, as if with fervid heat, and Ashman fancied once
or twice that he caught glimpses of a vast mass of molten stuff,
far down in the mountain, surging; seething and turning upon itself
with terrific violence.  But the glare was so dazzling that it
was like staring at the sun, and he was compelled to withdraw
his gaze.</p>

<p>The opening above, through which all this vapor and gas effected
its escape into the clear atmosphere outside, was of irregular
outline and no more than twenty feet across.  It was at a great
height above the spectators, and ought to have been visible many
miles in every direction.</p>

<p>Now and then Ashman caught the odor of the sulphurous fumes rising
from the naming depth, and he could not help reflecting that if
the ascending vapors should swerve toward them only for a minute
or two, they would be asphyxiated before they could get away;
but he could not shrink, when his lovely companion stood so boldly
by his side, unmoved by the impressive scene.</p>

<p>When he had become accustomed in a degree to the sight, the like
of which he had never viewed before, he recalled that they could
not occupy a more conspicuous position, in the event of being
pursued by their enemies to the underground lake.</p>

<p>As we have explained, they were standing on the highest portion
of the rocky wall, separating the burning mountain from the subterranean
portion of the enchanted lake.  In this situation, they were in
sight from every portion of the shore; any one entering by the
tunnel, as they had done, would descry them almost at once, because
of the vivid background against which their figures were thrown.</p>

<p>This fact led Ashman to turn to his love and suggest that they
should leave the spot.  She nodded her head in acquiescence, and,
still clasping hands, they began picking their way down among
the bowlders to the spot where they had left their canoe a short
time before.</p>
