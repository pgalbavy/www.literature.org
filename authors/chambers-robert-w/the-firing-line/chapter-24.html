<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>When Portlaw arrived home late that evening there existed within
his somewhat ordinary intellect a sense of triumph. The weak usually
experience it at the beginning and through every step of their
own subjugation.</p>

<p>Malcourt, having decided to take an express which stopped on
signal at six in the morning, was reading as usual before the
empty fireplace; and at the first glance he suspected what had
begun to happen to Portlaw.</p>

<p>The latter bustled about the room with an air of more or less
importance, sorted his letters, fussed with a newspaper; and every
now and then Malcourt, glancing up, caught Portlaw's eyes peeping
triumphantly around corners at him.</p>

<p>"You've been riding?" he said, much amused. "Are you stiff?"</p>

<p>"A trifle," replied the other carelessly. "I must keep it up.
Really, you know, I've rather neglected the horses lately."</p>

<p>"Rather. So you're taking up riding again?"</p>

<p>Portlaw nodded: "I've come to the conclusion that I need exercise."</p>

<p>Malcourt, who had been urging him for years to exercise, nodded
approval as though the suggestion were a brand-new one.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Portlaw, "I shall ride, I think, every day. I intend
to do a good bit of tramping, too. It's excellent for the liver,
Louis."</p>

<p>At this piece of inspired information Malcourt assumed an expression
of deepest interest, but hoped Portlaw might not overdo it.</p>

<p>"I'm going to diet, too," observed Portlaw, watching the effect
of this astounding statement on his superintendent. "My theory
is that we all eat too much."</p>

<p>"Don't do anything Spartan," said Malcourt warningly; "a man
at your time of life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My&mdash;what! Confound it, Louis, I'm well this side of forty!"</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps; but when a man reaches your age there is not much
left for him but the happiness of overeating&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What d'y' mean?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; only as he's out of the race with younger men as far
as a pretty woman is concerned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who's out!" demanded Portlaw, red in the face. "What sort of
men do you suppose interest women? Broilers? I always thought
your knowledge of women was superficial; now I know it. And you
don't know everything about everything else, either&mdash;about summonses
and lawsuits, for example." And he cast an exultant look at his
superintendent.</p>

<p>But Malcourt let him tell the news in his own way; and he did,
imparting it in bits with naive enjoyment, apparently utterly
unconscious that he was doing exactly what his superintendent
had told him to do.</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> a diplomat, aren't you?" said Malcourt with
a weary smile.</p>

<p>"A little, a little," admitted Portlaw modestly. "I merely mentioned
these things&mdash;" He waved his hand to check any possible eulogy
of himself from Malcourt. "I'll merely say this: that when I make
up my mind to settle anything&mdash;" He waved his hand again, condescendingly.</p>

<p>"That man," thought Malcourt, "will be done for in a year. Any
woman could have had him; the deuce of it was to find one who'd
take him. I think she's found."</p>

<p>And looking up blandly:</p>

<p>"Porty, old fellow, you're really rather past the marrying age&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll do what I please!" shouted Portlaw, exasperated.</p>

<p>Malcourt had two ways of making Portlaw do a thing; one was to
tell him not to, the other the reverse. He always ended by doing
it anyway; but the quicker result was obtained by the first method.</p>

<p>So Malcourt went to New York next morning convinced that Portlaw's
bachelor days were numbered; aware, also, that as soon as Mrs.
Ascott took the helm his own tenure of office would promptly expire.
He wished it to expire, easily, agreeably, naturally; and that
is why he had chosen to shove Portlaw in the general direction
of the hymeneal altar.</p>

<p>He did not care very much for Portlaw&mdash;scarcely enough to avoid
hurting his feelings by abandoning him. But now he had arranged
it so that to all appearances the abandoning would be done by
Portlaw, inspired by the stronger mind of Mrs. Ascott. It had
been easy and rather amusing to arrange; it saved wordy and endless
disputes with Portlaw; it would give him a longed-for release
from an occupation he had come to hate.</p>

<p>Malcourt was tired. He wanted a year of freedom from dependence,
surcease of responsibility&mdash;a year to roam where he wished, foregather
with whom he pleased, haunt the places congenial to him, come
and go unhampered; a year of it&mdash;only one year. What remained
for him to do after the year had expired he thought he understood;
yes, he was practically certain&mdash;had always been.</p>

<p>But first must come that wonderful year he had planned&mdash;or, if
he tired of the pleasure sooner, then, as the caprice stirred
him, he would do what he had planned to do ever since his father
died. The details only remained to be settled.</p>

<p>For Malcourt, with all the contradictions in his character, all
his cynicism, effrontery, ruthlessness, preferred to do things
in a manner calculated to spare the prejudices of others; and
if there was a way to accomplish a thing without hurting people,
he usually took the trouble to do it in that way. If not, he did
it anyway.</p>

<p>And now, at last, he saw before him the beginning of that curious
year for which he had so long waited; and, concerning the closing
details of which, he had pondered so often with his dark, handsome
head lowered and slightly turned, listening, always listening.</p>

<p>But nothing of this had he spoken of to his wife. It was not
necessary. He had a year in which to live in a certain manner
and do a certain thing; and it was going to amuse him to do it
in a way which would harm nobody.</p>

<p>The year promised to be an interesting one, to judge from all
signs. For one item his sister, Lady Tressilvain, was impending
from Paris&mdash;also his brother-in-law&mdash;complicating the humour of
the visitation. Malcourt's marriage to an heiress was the perfectly
obvious incentive of the visit. And when they wrote that they
were coming to New York, it amused Malcourt exceedingly to invite
them to Luckless Lake. But he said nothing about it to Portlaw
or his wife.</p>

<p>Then, for another thing, the regeneration and development, ethically
and artistically, of Dolly Wilming amused him. He wanted to be
near enough to watch it&mdash;without, however, any real faith in its
continuation.</p>

<p>And, also, there was Miss Suydam. Her development would not be
quite as agreeable to witness; process of disillusioning her,
little by little, until he had undermined himself sufficiently
to make the final break with her very easy&mdash;for her. Of course
it interested him; all intrigue did where skill was required with
women.</p>

<p>And, last of all, yet of supreme importance, he desired leisure,
undisturbed, to study his own cumulative development, to humorously
thwart it, or misunderstand it, or slyly aid it now and then&mdash;always
aware of and attentive to that extraneous something which held
him so motionless, at moments, listening attentively as though
to a command.</p>

<p>For, from that morning four years ago when, crushed with fatigue,
he strove to keep his vigil beside his father who, toward daybreak,
had been feigning sleep&mdash;from that dreadful dawn when, waking
with the crash of the shot in his ears, his blinded gaze beheld
the passing of a soul&mdash;he understood that he was no longer his
own master.</p>

<p>Not that the occult triad, Chance, Fate, and Destiny ruled; they
only modified his orbit. But from the centre of things Something
that ruled them was pulling him toward it, slowly, steadily, inexorably
drawing him nearer, lessening the circumference of his path, attenuating
it, circumscribing, limiting, controlling. And long since he had
learned to name this thing, undismayed&mdash;this one thing remaining
in the world in which his father's son might take a sporting interest.</p>

</div>
<p>He had been in New York two weeks, enjoying existence in his
own fashion, untroubled by any demands, questions, or scruples
concerning responsibility, when a passionate letter from Portlaw
disturbed the placid interlude:</p>

<p>   "Confound it, Louis, haven't you the common decency to come
back    when you know I've had a bunch of people here to be entertained?</p>

<p>   "Nobody's heard a peep from you. What on earth do you mean
by    this?</p>

<p>   "Miss Palliser, Mrs. Ascott, Miss Cardross are here, also   
Wayward, and Gray Cardross&mdash;which with you and Mrs. Malcourt and   
myself solves the Bridge proposition&mdash;or would have solved it.   
But without warning, yesterday, your sister and brother-in-law   
arrived, bag and baggage, and Mrs. Malcourt has given them the   
west wing of your house. I believe she was as astonished as I,   
but she will not admit it.</p>

<p>   "I don't know whether this is some sorry jest of yours&mdash;not
that    Lady Tressilvain and her noble spouse are unwelcome&mdash;but
for    Heaven's sake consider Wayward's feelings&mdash;cooped up in
camp with    his ex-wife! It wasn't a very funny thing to do,
Louis; but now    that it's done you can come back and take care
of the mess you've    made.</p>

<p>   "As for Mrs. Malcourt, she is not merely a trump, she is a   
hundred aces and a grand slam in a redoubled Without!&mdash;if that's   
possible. But Mrs. Ascott is my pillar of support in what might   
easily become a fool of a situation.</p>

<p>   "And you, you amateur idiot!&mdash;are down there in town, humorously   
awaiting the shriek of anguish from me. Well, you've heard me.   
But it's not a senseless shriek; it's a dignified protest. I tell   
you I've learned to depend on myself, recently&mdash;at Mrs. Ascott's   
suggestion. And I'm doing it now by wiring Virginia Suydam to   
come and fill in the third table.</p>

<p>   "Now I want you to come back at once. If you don't I'm going
to    have a serious talk with you, Louis. I've taken Mrs. Ascott
into    my confidence more or less and she agrees with me that
I ought to    lay down a strong, rigid policy and that it is your
duty to    execute it. In fact she also took me into her confidence
and gave    me, at my request, a very clear idea of how she would
run this    place; and to my surprise and gratification I find
that her ideas    of discipline, taste, and economy are exactly
mine, although I    thought of them first and perhaps have influenced
her in this    matter as I have in others. That is, of course,
natural, she    being a woman.</p>

<p>   "I think I ought to be frank with you, Louis. It isn't good
form    for you to leave Mrs. Malcourt the way you do every week
or two    and disappear in New York and give no explanation. You
haven't    been married long enough to do that. It isn't square
to me,    either.</p>

<p>   "And while I'm about it I want to add that, at Mrs. Ascott's   
suggestion&mdash;which really is my own idea    &mdash;I have decided
not to    build all those Rhine castles, which useless notion,
if I am not    mistaken, originated with you. I don't want to
disfigure my    beautiful wilderness. Mrs. Ascott and I had a
very plain talk    with Hamil and we forced him to agree with
us that the less he    did to improve my place the better for
the place. He seemed to    take it good-humouredly. He left yesterday
to look over Mrs.    Ascott's place and plan for her a formal
garden and Trianon at    Pride's Hall. So he being out I wired
also to Virginia and to    Philip Gatewood, which will make it
right&mdash;four at a table. Your    brother-in-law plays a stiff game
and your sister is a    wonder!&mdash;five grand slams last night!
But I played like a    dub    &mdash;I'd been riding and walking
and canoeing all day with Mrs.    Ascott and I was terribly sleepy.</p>

<p>   "So come on up, Louis. I'll forgive you&mdash;but don't mind if
I    growl at you before Mrs. Ascott as she thinks I ought to   
discipline you. And, confound it, I ought to, and I will, too,
if    you don't look out. But I'll be devilish glad to see you.</p>

"Yours,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"W. <em>VAN BEUREN PORTLAW</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>Malcourt, in his arm-chair by the open window, lay back full
length, every fibre of him vibrating with laughter.</p>

<p>Dolly Wilming at the piano continued running over the pretty
firework melodies of last season's metropolitan success&mdash;a success
built entirely on a Viennese waltz, the air of which might have
been taken from almost any popular Yankee hymn-book.</p>

<p>He folded Portlaw's letter and pocketed it; and lay for a while
under the open window, enjoying his own noiseless mirth, gaily
accompanied by Dolly Winning's fresh, clear singing or her capricious
improvising.</p>

<p>Begonias bloomed in a riotous row on the sill, nodding gently
in the river-wind which also fluttered the flags and sails on
yacht, schooner, and sloop under the wall of the Palisades.</p>

<p>That day the North River was more green than blue&mdash;like the eyes
of a girl he knew; summer, crowned and trimmed with green, brooded
on the long rock rampart across the stream. Turquoise patches
of sky and big clouds, leafy parapets, ships passing to the sea;
and in mid-stream an anchored island of steel painted white and
buff, bristling with long thin guns, the flower-like flag rippling
astern; another battle-ship farther north; another, another; and
farther still the white tomb&mdash;unlovely mansion of the dead&mdash;on
outpost duty above the river, guarding with the warning of its
dead glories the unlovely mansions of the living ranged along
the most noble terrace in the world.</p>

<p>And everywhere to north, south, and east, the endless waste of
city, stark, clean-cut, naked alike of tree and of art, unsoftened
even by the haze of its own exudations&mdash;everywhere the window-riddled
blocks of oblongs and cubes gridironed with steel rails &mdash;New
York in all the painted squalor of its Pueblo splendour.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>"You say you are doing well in everything except French and Italian?"</p>

<p>Dolly, still humming to her own accompaniment, looked over her
shoulder and nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, how the dickens are you ever going to sing at either Opera
or on the road or anywhere if you don't learn French and Italian?"</p>

<p>"I'm trying, Louis."</p>

<p>"Go ahead; let's hear something, then."</p>

<p>And she sang very intelligently and in excellent taste:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Pendant que, plein d'amour, j'expire à votre porte,<br/>
Vous dormez d'un paisible sommeil&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>and turned questioningly to him.</p>

<p>"That's all right; try another."</p>

<p>So, serenely obedient, she sang:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Chantons Margot, nos amours,<br/>
Margot leste et bien tournée&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>"Well, I don't see anything the matter with your French," he
muttered.</p>

<p>The girl coloured with pleasure, resting pensively above the
key-board; but he had no further requests to make and presently
she swung around on the piano-stool, looking at him.</p>

<p>"You sing all right; you are doing your part&mdash;as far as I can
discover."</p>

<p>"There is nothing for you to discover that I have not told you,"
she said gravely. In her manner there was a subdued dignity which
he had noticed recently&mdash;something of the self-confidence of the
very young and unspoiled&mdash;which, considering all things, he could
not exactly account for.</p>

<p>"Does that doddering old dancing-master of yours behave himself?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;since you spoke to him. Mr. Bulder came to the school again."</p>

<p>"What did you say to him?"</p>

<p>"I told him that you wouldn't let me sing in 'The Inca.'"</p>

<p>"And what did Bulder say?"</p>

<p>"He was persistent but perfectly respectful; asked if he might
confer with you. He wrote to you I think, didn't he?"</p>

<p>Malcourt nodded and lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Dolly," he said, "do you want to sing <em>Chaské</em> in 'The
Inca' next winter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do&mdash;if you think it is all right." She added in a low
voice: "I want to do what will please you, Louis."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether it's the best thing to do, but&mdash;you may
have to." He laid his cigarette in a saucer, watched the smoke
curling ceilingward, and said as though to himself:</p>

<p>"I should like to be certain that you can support yourself&mdash;within
a reasonable time from now&mdash;say a year. That is all, Dolly."</p>

<p>"I can do it now if you wish it&mdash;" The expression of his face
checked her.</p>

<p>"I don't mean a variety career devoted to 'mother' songs," he
said with a sneer. "There's a middle course between diamonds and
'sinkers.' You'll get there if you don't kick over the traces....
Have you made any more friends?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are they respectable?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, colouring.</p>

<p>"Has anybody been impertinent?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Williams."</p>

<p>"I'll attend to him&mdash;the little squirt!... Who are your new friends?"</p>

<p>"There's a perfectly sweet girl in the French class, Marguerite
Barret. I think she likes me.... Louis, I don't believe you understand
how very happy I am beginning to be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do people come here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, on Sunday afternoons; I know nearly a dozen nice girls
now, and those men I told you about &mdash;Mr. Snyder, Mr. Jim
Anthony and his brother the artist, and Mr. Cass and Mr. Renwick."</p>

<p>"You can cut out Renwick," he said briefly.</p>

<p>She seemed surprised. "He has always been perfectly nice to me,
Louis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut him out, Dolly. I know the breed."</p>

<p>"Of course, if you wish."</p>

<p>He looked at her, convinced in spite of himself. "Always ask
me about people. If I don't know I can find out."</p>

<p>"I always do," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe you do.... You're all right, Dolly&mdash;so far....
There, don't look at me in that distressed-dove fashion; I <em>know</em>
you are all right and mean to be for your own sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For yours also," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;that's all right, too&mdash;story-book fidelity; my preserver
ever!&mdash;What? &mdash;Sure&mdash;and a slow curtain.... There, there,
Dolly&mdash;where's your sense of humour! Good Lord, what's changing
you into a bread-and-butter boarding-school sentimentalist!&mdash;to
feel hurt at nothing! Hello! look at that kitten of yours climbing
your silk curtains! Spank the rascal!"</p>

<p>But the girl caught up the kitten and tucked it up under her
chin, smiling across at Malcourt, who had picked up his hat, gloves,
and stick.</p>

<p>"Will you come to-morrow?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going away for a while."</p>

<p>Her face fell; she rose, placed the kitten on the lounge, and
walked up to him, both hands clasped loosely behind her back,
wistfully acquiescent.</p>

<p>"It's going to be lonely again for me," she said.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You've just read me your visiting list&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had rather have you here than anybody."</p>

<p>"Dolly, you'll get over that absurd sense of obligatory regard
for me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had <em>rather</em> have you, Louis."</p>

<p>"I know. That's very sweet of you&mdash;and very proper.... You are
all right.... I'll be back in a week or ten days, and," smilingly,
"mind you have your report ready! If you've been a good girl we'll
talk over 'The Inca' again and&mdash;perhaps&mdash;we'll have Mr. Bulder
up to luncheon.... Good-bye."</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, looking up into his face.</p>

<p>"Smile!" he insisted.</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>So he went away, rather satiated with the pleasures of self-denial;
but the lightly latent mockery soon broke out again in a smile
as he reached the street.</p>

<p>"What a mess!" he grinned to himself. "The Tressilvains at Portlaw's!
And Wayward! and Shiela and Virginia and that awful Louis Malcourt!
It only wants Hamil to make the jolliest little hell of it. O
my, O my, what an amusing mess!"</p>

<p>However, he knew what Portlaw didn't know, that Virginia would
never accept that invitation, and that neither Wayward nor Constance
Palliser would remain one day under the roof that harboured the
sister of Louis Malcourt.</p>
