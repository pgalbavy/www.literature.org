<p>"There's one thing certain," said Jack Carleton to himself, as
he gathered the Indian blanket around his shoulders, like one
lying down to pleasant dreams, "I can keep awake a good deal more
easily than I did last night. I'm pretty tired, but I slept so
much toward morning that it will be no trouble to go twenty-four
hours without any more."</p>

<p>The temperature was milder than at that time, so that the lad
found the thick blanket uncomfortably warm when wrapped closely
around him. He flung out his feet and arms as a child often does
with its bed coverings, and adjusted his body so as to keep his
eye on the sentinel, without (as the captive believed) any suspicion
of his intention.</p>

<p>The other couples sank into refreshing slumber within a few minutes
after lying down, and it certainly was singular that the warrior
who sat half revealed, with his back against the tree, should
have continued as motionless as did the chief Ogallah the evening
before. It was impossible that two scenes should resemble each
other more closely than those named.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he can keep it up as long as the old fellow
did. If he tries it, he will be dreaming, and when he and the
rest awake, they will find I am miles off and going with might
and main for home. My gracious! but I shall have a long distance
to travel, and it will be hard work to keep out of their way."</p>

<p>Fixing his eyes on the form as it was shown by the flickering
camp-fire, Jack prepared to watch with more patience than he showed
in the former instance. The sound of the splashing brook and the
soft stirring of the night wind were soothing to the tired boy.
By-and-by his eyelids drooped, then closed, and his senses passed
from him. Never was he sunk in sounder sleep.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred to disturb him, and he slept hour after hour,
never opening his eyes until it was broad daylight and Ogallah
and his warriors were astir.</p>

<p>Jack was chagrined beyond expression when he found what he had
done, or, rather, what he had failed to do. The opportunity for
which he had sighed so long had slipped irrevocably from his grasp.
So convinced was he of this fact that he gave over all thought
of escape while on the journey.</p>

<p>"The Indian village can't be far off, and I must now go ahead
and take my chances. But this is getting tiresome."</p>

<p>The last remark referred to the absence of any preparations for
breakfast. He had made no complaint the evening before, but it
was a hardship to continue his fast. Inasmuch, however, as there
was no help for it, he submitted without a murmur.</p>

<p>There was now no pretence of treading in each other's footsteps,
but the party straggled up the ridge like a lot of weary pedestrians.
No one seemed to pay any attention to the single captive, most
likely because there was no call to do so. He might desire to
make a break for liberty, but he could not go further than they
were willing to permit.</p>

<p>The top of the ridge was marked by a bare spot, where some charred
sticks showed a fire had been recently kindled. There could be
no doubt that it was there the answering signal had been made
to the call of Ogallah.</p>

<p>But looking down the western slope of the ridge, Jack Carleton's
eyes rested on a scene more interesting than any that had met
his gaze since leaving home. Less than a mile off, close to the
shore of a winding stream and in the middle of a partially cleared
space, stood the Indian village toward which his footsteps had
been tending for nearly two days, and where he was likely to spend
an indefinite captivity.</p>

<p>The stream was perhaps a hundred feet in width. It shone brightly
in the morning sun, and the current was clearer than that of the
river crossed the day before. It wound its way westward as far
as the eye could follow it, flowing into a tributary of the Osage,
thence to the Missouri, and so on to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>The Indian village numbered between twenty and thirty lodges,
wigwams or dwellings as they may be called. Some of them were
made of bison and deer skins, and were of irregular, conical shape;
others were mere huts, covered with grass, leaves, limbs and dirt,
while one or two were mainly composed of stones piled in the form
of rude walls and roofed in the rude fashion described.</p>

<p>These primitive structures were scattered irregularly over a
space of half an acre, which might be called a clearing, inasmuch
as only a few stumps and broken trees were to be seen. But nothing
in the way of corn or vegetables was growing, and the air of dilapidation,
untidiness and squalor pervading the whole scene, was characteristic
of the race, and was that which robs it of the romance which in
the minds of many attaches to the name of the American Indian.</p>

<p>Viewed from the ridge, Jack could see figures moving to and fro
in the aimless manner natural to such indolent people. There were
children running and playing among the stumps and dwellings&mdash;half
naked little knots of humanity, who in a few years would become
the repulsive squaws or terrible warriors of the tribe. Three
of the youngsters were having a high time with a canoe lying against
the shore. They were splashing the water over each other, plunging
into the stream and scrambling out again without regard to the
wear or tear of their clothing, and playing all sorts of tricks
on each other, while a half dozen playmates were standing on the
bank laughing so heartily that a spectator would have found it
hard to understand why the American race is so often described
as of a melancholy temperament.</p>

<p>Now and then some squaw could be seen trudging along under a
load of sticks, while more than likely her lazy husband was asleep
within the wigwam. A half dozen warriors strolled off toward the
woods, rifles in hand, and most likely with the intention of going
upon a hunt. Just before leaving the clearing, one of them caught
sight of the group on the top of the ridge. Immediately they swung
their arms and sent several ringing whoops across as a salutation
to their friends.</p>

<p>Ogallah answered, and he and his party moved down the slope toward
their homes. Having saluted each other in this fashion, the warriors
of the village speedily vanished in the wood. They must have known
that the returning company had a prisoner with them, but it will
be seen they felt no particular interest in the matter.</p>

<p>But if such was the fact respecting the hunters, it was far different
with those who were left behind. The moment the five warriors
emerged from the wood, with the captive walking among them, the
whole village was thrown in a turmoil of excitement. Squaws and
children rushed forward, men came to the entrances of their wigwams,
and some strolled out to make a closer investigation of the matter.</p>

<p>It was a trying moment to Jack Carleton, for it may be said that
he had discounted it during the preceding day. He forced himself
to smile, and when the chattering, grunting, shouting crowd gathered
around him so closely that he was forced to stop walking, he shook,
so far as he could, most of the scores of hands that were pushed
against him.</p>

<p>All this was well enough, but it was not long before their attention
took an unpleasant form. Some of the half grown bucks either feigned
or really were angered because Jack could not give them heed,
and struck him with the flat of their hands about the chest and
shoulders. The boy turned when the first blow was delivered, and
the Indian indulged in a taunting grimace. Jack clenched his fist
and was on the point of striking him in the face when his good
sense restrained him. He needed no one to tell him the consequences
of such rashness.</p>

<p>The attentions soon became so boisterous that Ogallah interfered.
He flung the crowd right and left, commanding them to disperse,
and then beckoned the youth to follow him toward a lodge near
the center of the village. Jack was glad enough to do so, and
was speedily relieved of annoyance.</p>

<p>The sachem conducted the boy to his own dwelling where none of
the curious dare follow him, though the crowd gathered on the
outside and peeped within, like so many persons seeking a free
survey of a circus.</p>

<p>Suspecting that this was likely to be his new home for an indefinite
time, Jack Carleton was quick to acquaint himself with the interior.
The structure, as I have said, stood near the middle of the village,
and was the largest of the collection. It is rare that an aboriginal
building bears such resemblance to those made by the white men
of the border, for the American race has never shown any aptitude
in architecture.</p>

<p>Ogallah's house was a log cabin, perhaps twenty feet long by
half as many wide. The logs were roughly dovetailed at the corners,
but none of the numerous crevices were stopped by mortar or clay,
and daylight could be discerned through many a rent, which in
cold weather admitted the keen cutting wind.</p>

<p>A single opening served as a door. Aboriginal ingenuity could
not pass beyond this rude contrivance, so having opened the way
for ingress and egress, the builder was content to hang a bison
skin as a curtain. This could be readily pulled aside by any one,
and the door locked by fastening the corners. Windows are a sinful
extravagance to the American Indian, and there was not one in
the village to which Jack Carleton was taken. When the open door,
the burning fire, the hole which answered for a chimney, and the
numerous crevices did not give enough light for the interior,
the occupants went outside to obtain it.</p>

<p>Having put up the four walls of logs and roofed them with branches,
covered with leaves, dirt and grass, Ogallah was content to lean
back, fold his arms and smoke his pipe in placid triumph. The
floor was the earth, worn hard and smooth by the feet of the family,
and the fire was kindled on the ground at the further end, where
the vapor found its way through the irregular opening made for
the purpose. There was nothing in the nature of a chair or bench
in the place. Bison and deer robes formed the couches, and the
pegs driven in the logs held blankets, bows, and furs of animals
(most of the last, however, lying on the ground), leggings and
other articles worn by the chieftain and his wife.</p>

<p>These two were the only occupants of the place previous to the
coming of Jack Carleton. Ogallah was in middle life, and had been
the father of but a single son, who died while yet a papoose.
His wife was tall and muscular, evidently a woman with a strong
will, and well worthy to be the consort of an Indian chief. She
did not rush to her husband and embrace him the moment she caught
sight of him. Indeed, she had not ventured outside the lodge,
though she could not have failed to hear the unusual turmoil.</p>

<p>She would not have been human had she not shown some curiosity
respecting her husband's companion. Jack doffed his hat and bowed
to her with elaborate courtesy, after which he leaned his rifle
against the side of the wigwam and folded his arms. The squaw
surveyed him for a full minute, during which he stood as if awaiting
her commands, and then, turning to her husband, the two held a
short but vigorous conversation.</p>

<p>The wife must have been expecting him, for she was engaged in
cooking some venison in the usual aboriginal fashion, and, to
the great relief of the boy, the two were not kept waiting for
their meal. Seating themselves cross-legged on the ground, the
half-cooked meat was taken in their hands, and, with no other
utensils than his hunting knife, each made his morning meal.</p>

<p>And so at last Jack Carleton was a captive among a tribe of Indians
whose totem was unknown to him. Whether he was to remain with
them until manhood, or whether he was to be put to death long
before that period, were questions whose answers he did not dare
try to conjecture.</p>

<p>His situation was a most extraordinary one, as every reader will
admit. He knew of more than one instance where children who were
captured when quite small, had become so attached to the rude
ways and wild life of the red men, that they refused to go back
to their own people when the offer presented itself, but it was
too late in the day for such an experience to befall him.</p>

<p>And now, for a time, we must leave Jack Carleton to himself,
while we give attention to other incidents which are destined
to have a bearing on his fate.</p>
