<P>The little troop, without looking behind them or exchanging
a word, fled at a rapid gallop, fording a little stream, of
which none of them knew the name, and leaving on their left
a town which Athos declared to be Durham. At last they came
in sight of a small wood, and spurring their horses afresh,
rode in its direction.</P>
<P>As soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain
sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one
who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council
together. The two grooms held the horses, that they might
take a little rest without being unsaddled, and Grimaud was
posted as sentinel.</P>
<P>&quot;Come, first of all,&quot; said Athos to D'Artagnan, &quot;my friend,
that I may shake hands with you  -  you, our rescuer  -  you,
the true hero of us all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Athos is right  -  you have my adoration,&quot; said Aramis, in
his turn pressing his hand. &quot;To what are you not equal, with
your superior intelligence, infallible eye, your arm of iron
and your enterprising mind!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now,&quot; said the Gascon, &quot;that is all well, I accept for
Porthos and myself everything  -  thanks and compliments; we
have plenty of time to spare.&quot;</P>
<P>The two friends, recalled by D'Artagnan to what was also due
to Porthos, pressed his hand in their turn.</P>
<P>&quot;And now,&quot; said Athos, &quot;it is not our plan to run anywhere
and like madmen, but we must map up our campaign. What shall
we do?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What are we going to do, i'faith? It is not very difficult
to say.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tell us, then, D'Artagnan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We are going to reach the nearest seaport, unite our little
resources, hire a vessel and return to France. As for me I
will give my last sou for it. Life is the greatest treasure,
and speaking candidly, ours hangs by a thread.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you say to this, Du Vallon?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I,&quot; said Porthos, &quot;I am entirely of D'Artagnan's opinion;
this is a `beastly' country, this England.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are quite decided, then, to leave it?&quot; asked Athos of
D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Egad! I don't see what is to keep me here.&quot;</P>
<P>A glance was exchanged between Athos and Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;Go, then, my friends,&quot; said the former, sighing.</P>
<P>&quot;How, go then?&quot; exclaimed D'Artagnan. &quot;Let us go, you mean?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, my friend,&quot; said Athos, &quot;you must leave us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Leave you!&quot; cried D'Artagnan, quite bewildered at this
unexpected announcement.</P>
<P>&quot;Bah!&quot; said Porthos, &quot;why separate, since we are all
together?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because you can and ought to return to France; your mission
is accomplished, but ours is not.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your mission is not accomplished?&quot; exclaimed D'Artagnan,
looking in astonishment at Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;No, my friend,&quot; replied Athos, in his gentle but decided
voice, &quot;we came here to defend King Charles; we have but ill
defended him  -  it remains for us to save him!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To save the king?&quot; said D'Artagnan, looking at Aramis as he
had looked at Athos.</P>
<P>Aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan's countenance took an expression of the deepest
compassion; he began to think he had to do with madmen.</P>
<P>&quot;You cannot be speaking seriously, Athos!&quot; said he; &quot;the
king is surrounded by an army, which is conducting him to
London. This army is commanded by a butcher, or the son of a
butcher  -  it matters little  -  Colonel Harrison. His
majesty, I can assure you, will be tried on his arrival in
London; I have heard enough from the lips of Oliver Cromwell
to know what to expect.&quot;</P>
<P>A second look was exchanged between Athos and Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;And when the trial is ended there will be no delay in
putting the sentence into execution,&quot; continued D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;And to what penalty do you think the king will be
condemned?&quot; asked Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;The penalty of death, I greatly fear; they have gone too
far for him to pardon them, and there is nothing left to
them but one thing, and that is to kill him. Have you never
heard what Oliver Cromwell said when he came to Paris and
was shown the dungeon at Vincennes where Monsieur de Vendome
was imprisoned?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What did he say?&quot; asked Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;`Princes must be knocked on the head.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I remember it,&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;And you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution, now
that he has got hold of the king?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On the contrary, I am certain he will do so. But then that
is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august
head so threatened.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Athos, you are becoming mad.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, my friend,&quot; Athos gently replied, &quot;but De Winter sought
us out in France and introduced us, Monsieur d'Herblay and
myself, to Madame Henrietta. Her majesty did us the honor to
ask our aid for her husband. We engaged our word; our word
included everything. It was our strength, our intelligence,
our life, in short, that we promised. It remains now for us
to keep our word. Is that your opinion, D'Herblay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;we have promised.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then,&quot; continued Athos, &quot;we have another reason; it is this
 -  listen: In France at this moment everything is poor and
paltry. We have a king ten years old, who doesn't yet know
what he wants; we have a queen blinded by a belated passion;
we have a minister who governs France as he would govern a
great farm  -  that is to say, intent only on turning out all
the gold he can by the exercise of Italian cunning and
invention; we have princes who set up a personal and
egotistic opposition, who will draw from Mazarin's hands
only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as
bribes. I have served them without enthusiasm  -  God knows
that I estimated them at their real value, and that they are
not high in my esteem  -  but on principle. To-day I am
engaged in a different affair. I have encountered misfortune
in a high place, a royal misfortune, a European misfortune;
I attach myself to it. If we can succeed in saving the king
it will be good; if we die for him it will be grand.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So you know beforehand you must perish!&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;We fear so, and our only regret is to die so far from both
of you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What will you do in a foreign land, an enemy's country?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I traveled in England when I was young, I speak English
like an Englishman, and Aramis, too, knows something of the
language. Ah! if we had you, my friends! With you,
D'Artagnan, with you, Porthos  -  all four reunited for the
first time for twenty years  -  we would dare not only
England, but the three kingdoms put together!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And did you promise the queen,&quot; resumed D'Artagnan,
petulantly, &quot;to storm the Tower of London, to kill a hundred
thousand soldiers, to fight victoriously against the wishes
of the nation and the ambition of a man, and when that man
is Cromwell? Do not exaggerate your duty. In Heaven's name,
my dear Athos, do not make a useless sacrifice. When I see
you merely, you look like a reasonable being; when you
speak, I seem to have to do with a madman. Come, Porthos,
join me; say frankly, what do you think of this business?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing good,&quot; replied Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;Come,&quot; continued D'Artagnan, who, irritated that instead of
listening to him Athos seemed to be attending to his own
thoughts, &quot;you have never found yourself the worse for my
advice. Well, then, believe me, Athos, your mission is
ended, and ended nobly; return to France with us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Friend,&quot; said Athos, &quot;our resolution is irrevocable.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then you have some other motive unknown to us?&quot;</P>
<P>Athos smiled and D'Artagnan struck his hand together in
anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could
discover; but to all these reasons Athos contented himself
by replying with a calm, sweet smile and Aramis by nodding
his head.</P>
<P>&quot;Very well,&quot; cried D'Artagnan, at last, furious, &quot;very well,
since you wish it, let us leave our bones in this beggarly
land, where it is always cold, where fine weather is a fog,
fog is rain, and rain a deluge; where the sun represents the
moon and the moon a cream cheese; in truth, whether we die
here or elsewhere matters little, since we must die.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Only reflect, my good fellow,&quot; said Athos, &quot;it is but dying
rather sooner.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pooh! a little sooner or a little later, it isn't worth
quarreling over.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If I am astonished at anything,&quot; remarked Porthos,
sententiously, &quot;it is that it has not already happened.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, it will happen, you may be sure,&quot; said D'Artagnan. &quot;So
it is agreed, and if Porthos makes no objection  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I,&quot; said Porthos, &quot;I will do whatever you please; and
besides, I think what the Comte de la Fere said just now is
very good.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But your future career, D'Artagnan  -  your ambition,
Porthos?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Our future, our ambition!&quot; replied D'Artagnan, with
feverish volubility. &quot;Need we think of that since we are to
save the king? The king saved  -  we shall assemble our
friends together  -  we will head the Puritans  -  reconquer
England; we shall re-enter London  -  place him securely on
his throne  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And he will make us dukes and peers,&quot; said Porthos, whose
eyes sparkled with joy at this imaginary prospect.</P>
<P>&quot;Or he will forget us,&quot; added D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, that has happened, friend Porthos. It seems to me
that we once rendered Anne of Austria a service not much
less than that which to-day we are trying to perform for
Charles I.; but, none the less, Anne of Austria has
forgotten us for twenty years.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, in spite of that, D'Artagnan,&quot; said Athos, &quot;you are
not sorry that you were useful to her?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, indeed,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;I admit even that in my
darkest moments I find consolation in that remembrance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You see, then, D'Artagnan, though princes often are
ungrateful, God never is.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Athos,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;I believe that were you to fall
in with the devil, you would conduct yourself so well that
you would take him with you to Heaven.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So, then?&quot; said Athos, offering his hand to D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;'Tis settled,&quot; replied D'Artagnan. &quot;I find England a
charming country, and I stay  -  but on one condition only.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That I am not forced to learn English.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, now,&quot; said Athos, triumphantly, &quot;I swear to you, my
friend, by the God who hears us  -  I believe that there is a
power watching over us, and that we shall all four see
France again.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So be it!&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;but I  -  I confess I have a
contrary conviction.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Our good D'Artagnan,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;represents among us the
opposition in parliament, which always says no, and always
does aye.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But in the meantime saves the country,&quot; added Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, now that everything is decided,&quot; cried Porthos,
rubbing his hands, &quot;suppose we think of dinner! It seems to
me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have
always dined.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! yes, speak of dinner in a country where for a feast
they eat boiled mutton, and as a treat drink beer. What the
devil did you come to such a country for, Athos? But I
forgot,&quot; added the Gascon, smiling, &quot;pardon, I forgot you
are no longer Athos; but never mind, let us hear your plan
for dinner, Porthos.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My plan!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, have you a plan?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No! I am hungry, that is all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pardieu, if that is all, I am hungry, too; but it is not
everything to be hungry, one must find something to eat,
unless we browse on the grass, like our horses  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; exclaimed Aramis, who was not quite so indifferent to
the good things of the earth as Athos, &quot;do you remember,
when we were at Parpaillot, the beautiful oysters that we
ate?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And the legs of mutton of the salt marshes,&quot; said Porthos,
smacking his lips.</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; suggested D'Artagnan, &quot;have we not our friend
Musqueton, who managed for us so well at Chantilly,
Porthos?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Porthos, &quot;we have Musqueton, but since he has
been steward, he has become very heavy; never mind, let us
call him, and to make sure that he will reply agreeably  -  - </P>
<P>&quot;Here! Mouston,&quot; cried Porthos.</P>
<P>Mouston appeared, with a most piteous face.</P>
<P>&quot;What is the matter, my dear M. Mouston?&quot; asked D'Artagnan.
&quot;Are you ill?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sir, I am very hungry,&quot; replied Mouston.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, it is just for that reason that we have called you,
my good M. Mouston. Could you not procure us a few of those
nice little rabbits, and some of those delicious partridges,
of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel  -  -  ?
'Faith, I do not remember the name of the hotel.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At the hotel of  -  -  ,&quot; said Porthos; &quot;by my faith  -  nor
do I remember it either.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It does not matter; and a few of those bottles of old
Burgundy wine, which cured your master so quickly of his
sprain!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alas! sir,&quot; said Musqueton, &quot;I much fear that what you ask
for are very rare things in this detestable and barren
country, and I think we should do better to go and seek
hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the
fringe of the forest.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How! is there a house in the neighborhood?&quot; asked
D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied Musqueton.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, let us, as you say, go and ask a dinner from the
master of that house. What is your opinion, gentlemen, and
does not M. Mouston's suggestion appear to you full of
sense?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Aramis, &quot;suppose the master is a Puritan?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So much the better, mordioux!&quot; replied D'Artagnan; &quot;if he
is a Puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king,
and in honor of the news he will kill for us his fatted
hens.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But if he should be a cavalier?&quot; said Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;In that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will
pluck for us his black fowls.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are very happy,&quot; exclaimed Athos, laughing, in spite of
himself, at the sally of the irresistible Gascon; &quot;for you
see the bright side of everything.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What would you have?&quot; said D'Artagnan. &quot;I come from a land
where there is not a cloud in the sky.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is not like this, then,&quot; said Porthos stretching out his
hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on
his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain.</P>
<P>&quot;Come, come,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;more reason why we should
start on our journey. Halloo, Grimaud!&quot;</P>
<P>Grimaud appeared.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Grimaud, my friend, have you seen anything?&quot; asked
the Gascon.</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing!&quot; replied Grimaud.</P>
<P>&quot;Those idiots!&quot; cried Porthos, &quot;they have not even pursued
us. Oh! if we had been in their place!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, they are wrong,&quot; said D'Artagnan. &quot;I would willingly
have said two words to Mordaunt in this little desert. It is
an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think, decidedly,&quot; observed Aramis, &quot;gentlemen, that the
son hasn't his mother's energy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What, my good fellow!&quot; replied Athos, &quot;wait awhile; we have
scarcely left him two hours ago  -  he does not know yet in
what direction we came nor where we are. We may say that he
is not equal to his mother when we put foot in France, if we
are not poisoned or killed before then.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Meanwhile, let us dine,&quot; suggested Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;I'faith, yes,&quot; said Athos, &quot;for I am hungry.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Look out for the black fowls!&quot; cried Aramis.</P>
<P>And the four friends, guided by Musqueton, took up the way
toward the house, already almost restored to their former
gayety; for they were now, as Athos had said, all four once
more united and of single mind.</P></div>
