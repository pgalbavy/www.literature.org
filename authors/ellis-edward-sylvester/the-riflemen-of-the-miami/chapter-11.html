<p>As Oonamoo and O'Hara pressed forward, they found they were gaining
very rapidly upon the pursuers and pursued. As for the Huron,
he had an apprehension amounting almost to a certain conviction
that the leader of the Riflemen, after all, had committed a sad
mistake, in believing that he was safe from his enemies, after
being rejoined by Edith. This belief had led him into some trap,
and the faithful Indian felt that his services were sorely needed
at that very moment.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the day, when he and the hunter ascended
a sort of ridge, which afforded them quite an extensive view of
the surrounding wilderness. Here, carefully protecting their persons
from observation, they looked out over the forest in quest of
signs of human beings. The unexperienced person might have looked
for hours without discovering the slightest evidence of animal
life in the vast expanse spread out before him. He would have
seen the dark emerald of these western wilds cut by the gleaming
silver of many a stream and river; the tree-tops gently bowed,
like a field of grain, when the breeze rides over it; and overhead,
perhaps, would have been noted the flocks of birds circling in
curious figures; but all beneath would have been silent&mdash;silent,
save in that deep, solemn murmur which comes up perpetually like
the voice of the ocean.</p>

<p>But the Huron had scarcely glanced over the sylvan scene, when
his dark eye rested upon what, to him, was a most palpable evidence
of the presence of others in these woods. About a half-mile distant,
on the edge of a small clearing, stood the remains of a log fort.
This was subjected to a most searching scrutiny by both, but,
for a time, O'Hara discovered nothing unusual in its appearance.</p>

<p>"He's dere&mdash;he and the gal," said Oonamoo, pointing toward the
pile of logs.</p>

<p>"How do you know that? Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"See now what he done&mdash;he's dere. Look agin."</p>

<p>"I've looked at them logs ever since we've been standing here,
but hain't seen Lew or the gal yet."</p>

<p>"Eber seen logs afore?"</p>

<p>"Have I ever seen them logs before? Yes, often."</p>

<p>"How they look when last see him?"</p>

<p>"The same as they do now, I believe."</p>

<p>"Sure?" asked Oonamoo, in a tone that revealed all to O'Hara.
He now looked again toward the remains of the log-fort, and understood
at once the meaning of the Huron's question. He had passed by
the spot during the preceding autumn, and noticed that the logs
were scattered and thrown down, as if a tornado had passed over
the spot. Now, however, there was system in their arrangement&mdash;proof
sure that the hand of man had been employed upon them. The Huron
had seen them scarcely a week before, and knew that all these
changes had been made since&mdash;that, in fact, Lewis Dernor had made
them, and at that moment was standing at bay behind them.</p>

<p>While yet they were looking, they saw something gleam for an
instant in the sunlight, and then disappear as if drawn behind
the logs.</p>

<p>"That was Lew's rifle," said O'Hara. "He always keeps the barrel
polished up so that it nearly blinds a person to shoot."</p>

<p>"'Sh! look."</p>

<p>At the point where they had witnessed the movement of this bright
object, they now saw a red jet of flame spout out, a wreath of
blue smoke arise, and then came the report of a rifle.</p>

<p>"There's one red-skin the less," said O'Hara. "When Lew pulls
trigger, <em>something</em> is sure to go under."</p>

<p>"Want us there," said Oonamoo, starting down the ridge on his
peculiar trot, and moving off toward what may now properly be
termed a fort. Upon coming in its vicinity, both exercised the
greatest caution in their movements, knowing, as they did, that
it was besieged by their deadly enemies. A half-hour's reconnoitering
by both showed that there were ten Indians, exclusive of one dead
one, collected at one end of the clearing, where each, safely
ensconced behind a tree, was patiently waiting for a shot at the
Rifleman, whom they now at last believed they had fairly cornered.</p>

<p>Upon witnessing this condition of affairs, Oonamoo and O'Hara
debated a proposition proposed by the latter. It was that the
Huron, who was very fleet of foot, should instantly make all haste
to the settlement, and return with the Riflemen and a sufficient
force to scatter the besieging Indians to the four winds. This
undertaking would require more than five hours at the utmost to
fulfill it, but those five hours were so precious, that Oonamoo
decided not to make the attempt. He felt sure that unless Dernor
surrendered, the party of savages would attack the place in a
body before two hours elapsed; and, brave and determined as he
knew the Rifleman to be, he could see that a resistance upon his
part would be useless. He, therefore, acted with his usual wisdom,
in deciding to remain upon the ground to render assistance when
it would be needed.</p>

<p>The first plan adopted by O'Hara and the Huron was to keep their
position, remaining carefully concealed, until the savages should
move forward to the assault, when, as the former expressed it,
they would "wade in promiscuously." This project offered to its
originators the great point of excitement and desperate fighting,
but was finally rejected by the Huron for the last reason.</p>

<p>It is a very pleasant thing for a nation to think itself invincible
and able to conquer all others with which it may come in collision.
The same sensations, in a smaller degree, no doubt are experienced
by two persons when, in the flush of the moment, they feel able
to combat with five times their numbers; but, if time be allowed,
the "sober second thought" will prevail, and action will be guided
more by prudence than madness. The Huron was as brave a man as
ever breathed, but he was also as shrewd and cunning. He knew
well enough that should he and O'Hara rush in upon ten desperate,
well-armed warriors, no matter how fiercely they might fight,
the result would be that both would be killed and no one benefited.
He, therefore, determined to resort once more to his powers of
stratagem.</p>

<p>The great point now was to make Dernor aware of the vicinity
of his two friends. Without this Oonamoo would be more likely
to be shot by him than by the savages. This part of the stratagem
was the most difficult to accomplish. The Shawnees and Miamis
being collected at one end of the clearing, it could not be expected
that any signal, however skillfully or guardedly made, would attract
the notice of Dernor. It might possibly be seen by Edith, but
would not be understood. This means, therefore, was not even attempted.</p>

<p>The besieged Rifleman of course kept himself invisible. He had
become aware, when within a mile or so of the present spot, that
he was again pursued by his unrelenting enemies, and making all
haste thither, had thrown the logs together as compactly and securely
as the time allowed him would permit. He had brought down one
of his assailants, and they in turn had buried some twenty balls
in the logs around him, without inflicting injury upon either
Edith or himself.</p>

<p>In the hope of giving his leader an inkling of the condition
of affairs, O'Hara uttered a whistle, so perfect an imitation
of the call of a certain bird, that the suspicious Shawnees and
Miamis failed to notice it. Pausing a few moments, he repeated
it, and then awaited the action of Oonamoo. Whether Dernor had
caught the signal or not, of course his friends had no means of
judging; but the Huron, knowing that if he had not his own death
was certain, now coolly made the desperate attempt he had decided
upon.</p>

<p>Securely sheltered behind his log-fort, Dernor stood with cocked
rifle awaiting his chance to pick off one of his enemies. Every
faculty was absorbed in this, and he scarcely removed his eye
once from the spot where he knew they were collected. He was aware
of their exact number, as he was also of the fact that Girty,
the renegade, was not among them. His lips were compressed, a
dark scowl had settled upon his face, and it would have been easy
for any one to have read the iron determination of his heart.
He was at bay, it was true, and he was not ignorant of the desire
of the savages to gain possession of him. He said nothing to Edith
of the resolve he had made, but she needed no telling to understand
it. So long as life remained, her defender would never desert
her.</p>

<p>He was standing thus, gazing stealthily out through a loophole,
when Edith, who was watching every portion of the clearing, placed
her hand on his shoulder and told him that an Indian was stealing
toward them from the side opposite to that on which their enemies
were collected. As quick as thought Dernor wheeled around, pointed
his rifle out and took aim at the approaching savage. The latter
saw the movement, understood fully its cause, and yet made no
attempt to escape, relying entirely upon the chances of the Rifleman
discovering his identity before firing. His faith was rewarded,
although Oonamoo came nigher death in that single moment than
ever he imagined. Dernor's finger was already pressing the trigger,
when he saw directly behind the approaching Indian the barrel
of a rifle project from behind a tree and then disappear again.
This served to arrest his attention, and before he renewed his
aim the round face of O'Hara was thrust forth and disappeared
again. This led him to examine the face of the venturesome Indian.
A single glance and he recognized Oonamoo, the faithful Huron.
He instantly drew his rifle in, and the latter, understanding
the meaning of it, sprung nimbly forward, and with one bound cleared
the opposing barricades and came down beside the besieged Rifleman.
The latter grasped his hand and silently pressed it.</p>

<p>"Who is with you?" he asked, after relinquishing it.</p>

<p>"'Hara&mdash;short feller&mdash;legs like bent Injin's bow."</p>

<p>"Nobody else?"</p>

<p>"Nobody else," replied the Huron.</p>

<p>"You watch that side, then, Oonamoo, and I will attend to this."</p>

<p>"No watch this side&mdash;no Injin come here&mdash;all on toder side&mdash;me
watch with you&mdash;come round this side bime-by."</p>

<p>"Do as you please; you're an Injin and ought to understand them."</p>

<p>Oonamoo had been seen by the besieging savages as he bounded
over the logs, and, for a few minutes, they were puzzled to understand
the meaning of so singular an occurrence. Their first impression
was that one of their number, more daring than the others, had
taken this desperate means of getting at the Rifleman, and they
listened intently for sounds of combat and struggles between them;
but, as moment after moment passed without the silence being disturbed,
their eyes were opened to the fact that he had been reinforced
by a formidable ally; and this, too, when a little foresight on
their part would have prevented it. Having felt certain, previous
to this, that the white man had no friends in the vicinity, they
had neglected to surround his fort, so as to prevent their approach.
To prevent any thing further happening like this, a part of the
band now proceeded to get on the opposite side of him.</p>

<p>There was but one way in which this could be done without being
menaced by the rifles of the besieged party. Several of the Indians,
being careful to keep the protecting trees before them, slowly
retreated backward until they had gone far enough in the wood
to be safe, when they passed around and approached the fort from
the opposite side. It was not long before they became aware that
the friend of the Rifleman was fully as sagacious as himself,
and that, after all, the parties were not so unequally matched.
The threatening muzzles were constantly protruding from behind
those logs, and it was absolute suicide for any one to attempt
to stand before them.</p>

<p>Dernor having caught a glimpse of O'Hara, his companion, wondered
considerably that he did not follow the example of the Huron,
and unite with him in the fort. Thus strengthened, his confidence
would have been restored, and he would bid defiance to the Shawnees
and Miamis. But, as he waited, and finally saw that a number of
Indians had succeeded in getting behind him, he was compelled
to give up this hope. This excited speculation the more upon his
part, because he was fully aware of O'Hara's defects, and felt
that it would have been the most prudent course for him to adopt.
At length he questioned the Huron:</p>

<p>"Where's Tom?"</p>

<p>"Dunno&mdash;gone away."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he do as you did&mdash;come over and join me?"</p>

<p>"Tom 'Hara goin' <em>to do sumkin' else</em>&mdash;<em>he</em> know
what."</p>

<p>"I expect he does. He'd better move his carcase from where he
was a few minutes ago, or them dogs will move it for him."</p>

<p>"He know&mdash;<em>dey</em> won't move <em>him</em>&mdash;he get out way
soon enough."</p>

<p>"He's got too short legs," said Dernor, who, aware of the affection
the Huron bore him, and experiencing a sort of reaction of his
spirits after their continued depression, was disposed to quiz
Oonamoo a little.</p>

<p>"Got <em>long</em> eyes, dough," replied he, quickly.</p>

<p>"Got long eyes?" laughed Dernor. "I don't know as they're any
longer than mine."</p>

<p>"Good 'eal longer. Tom 'Hara neber let Shawnee and Miami get
him atween the logs&mdash;he know too much."</p>

<p>Dernor felt the sarcasm of this remark and took it kindly.</p>

<p>"Neither would they have got me here, had I been alone."</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe the expression that illuminated
the Huron's face at this remark. He turned his dark, basilisk
orbs (their fierceness now subdued into a softer light) full upon
Edith, who, seated upon a portion of one of the logs, was listening
to the conversation. The muscles around the corners of his mouth
twitched a little, a wrinkle or two gathered, his beautiful white
teeth became visible, but she only half-suspected that he was
smiling.</p>

<p>"Nice gal," said he, his voice now as soft as a woman's. "White
man love her&mdash;fight for her &mdash;Oonamoo do so too."</p>

<p>She did not know whether to be pleased or frightened at the look
of the Huron. In her perplexity she turned toward Dernor.</p>

<p>"You needn't be alarmed," said he, understanding her embarrassment.
"Oonamoo here is an old and tried friend, and will stand by you
as long as I will, which," he added, in a lower tone, "will be
as long as the One above gives me breath. He is devoted to me
if he doesn't love you."</p>

<p>"Yes, Oonamoo does&mdash;he love all white folks&mdash;love the gals&mdash;clever
to him and feed him when hungry."</p>

<p>Dernor merely smiled, believing that the remark of the savage
fully explained his passion without any qualifying observation
of his own.</p>

<p>"Oonamoo love white folks&mdash;love missionaries&mdash;tell him all about
God up dere"&mdash;pointing upward&mdash;"spirit land&mdash;happy place &mdash;Oonamoo
don't take scalp when Injin sleeping&mdash;so he go up dere when he
die."</p>

<p>"I believe you will, for if there ever was an honorable savage
you are one," said Dernor, warmly.</p>

<p>The Huron made no reply to this compliment, evidently thinking
enough had been said. It must not be supposed that this conversation
occurred in the connected form in which we have given it. Several
moments sometimes elapsed between the different remarks, and hardly
once during its progress did Dernor look at the savage. Once or
twice he turned toward Edith, as also did Oonamoo, but the danger
that menaced him was too great for either to be diverted from
it.</p>

<p>Some twenty minutes had elapsed, when an exclamation from the
Huron showed that some new scheme was afoot. Immediately after,
a blazing arrow came whizzing through the air, and buried itself
in the logs. The sharp crackling told that the twist of flame
had communicated with the logs and it was burning.</p>

<p>"My God! are we to be burnt alive?" exclaimed Dernor, losing
his self-possession for a moment.</p>

<p>"Ugh&mdash;can't burn&mdash;logs too wet&mdash;go out," replied his unmoved
companion.</p>

<p>So it proved, although an inch or two of some of the logs were
sufficiently seasoned to take fire, they were all too damp and
soaked to burn. Oonamoo had hardly spoken when the blaze went
out of itself. A perfect storm of arrows, tipped with burning
tow, now came sailing in upon them, but the only inconvenience
they occasioned was a blinding, suffocating smoke, which lasted,
however, but a few moments.</p>

<p>"Where the deuce did they get their bows and tow from?" asked
Dernor. "Do they carry such articles with them?"</p>

<p>"Sent for 'em after git here," replied Oonamoo.</p>

<p>"Won't any of these logs burn?"</p>

<p>"Too wet&mdash;smoke&mdash;but won't blaze."</p>

<p>The Indians soon found that nothing could be accomplished in
the way of burning out the fugitives, so they ceased the attempt
only to devise some other expedient. What this was to be, the
besieged party for a long time were unable to determine. The first
warning they had was a bullet, which grazed the face of Oonamoo,
coming in at the <em>top</em> of the fort.</p>

<p>"Ugh! Shawnee climb tree &mdash;Oonamoo fetch him out dere,"
said the latter, sheltering himself as quick as lightning, and
peering out in the hope of gaining a glimpse of the miscreant
who had come so near shooting him. He was disappointed, however,
the savage descending the tree with such skill and caution that
his person was never once exposed to the eagle eye of the Huron.</p>

<p>For an hour succeeding this last attempt nothing further was
done by the besieging savages. They carefully kept their bodies
concealed, so that the utmost watchfulness on the part of Oonamoo
and Dernor failed to get a shot at them. They saw enough, however,
to make them certain they were surrounded by their enemies, and
that for the present, at least, under Heaven, they had nothing
but their own bravery and good rifles to rely upon.</p>

<p>There were several means by which the fugitives could be compelled
to succumb in the end, if these means were only employed by the
savages. The first and obviously safest was to keep up the siege
until they were compelled to come to terms. Dernor had not a drop
of water nor a particle of food, and consequently this plan on
the part of the besiegers would have been only a question of time.
Again, a rapid and determined assault could scarcely fail to take
the Rifleman and the Huron. There were ten Indians to make the
attempt, but those ten knew well enough that two of their number
would never live to reach the fort in case the rush was made and
that there would be desperate work before the two men could be
overcome.</p>

<p>During the hour of silence these plans occurred to Dernor, and
he mentioned the first to Oonamoo. The cunning savage shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Won't do that&mdash;<em>afeard</em>."</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?"</p>

<p>"Settlement two&mdash;t'ree&mdash;fifteen mile off&mdash;<em>afeard</em> other
Long Knives come afore we got starve."</p>

<p>"I hope the boys are somewhere in the woods. Why don't the cowardly
dogs rush in upon us? They could batter these logs down in five
minutes."</p>

<p>"<em>Afeard</em> we batter <em>'em</em> down," replied the Huron,
with a sparkle of his black eyes.</p>

<p>"We would surely knock some of them over, but I don't suppose
we could finish up the whole ten."</p>

<p>"Finish some&mdash;don't know which&mdash;dat de reason."</p>

<p>"Their heads are so full of their devilish inventions, I should
think they could get up some way to attack us without getting
a shot at them."</p>

<p>"Attack purty soon&mdash;keep eye peeled&mdash;don't see notting?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," replied the Rifleman, who, all this time, was
peering through a chink in the logs and not looking at the Indian.</p>

<p>Taking it for granted that if the Huron saw no danger there could
be none, Dernor turned toward Edith, and asked, in that low, passionate
tone which he instinctively assumed in addressing her:</p>

<p>"And how do you feel, dear Edith, all this time?"</p>

<p>"<em>My</em> courage, I think, will bear up as long as <em>yours</em>,"
she answered, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"It will bear up to the end, then," he added. Then looking at
her a moment, he continued: "Edith, how you must feel toward me
for bringing you into this trouble! I have been thinking of it
for the last day or two."</p>

<p>"Did you do it on purpose?" she asked. "That is, did you <em>know</em>
we should be pursued and persecuted as we have been when we started?"</p>

<p>"Know it? of course not. I would have been shot before I would
have come."</p>

<p>"Then why do you ask me such a question? No, Lewis, I do not
blame you in the least. On the contrary, I shall never be able
to express the gratitude I feel for what you have done."</p>

<p>This was the first time Edith had addressed the Rifleman by his
given name, and it gave him a peculiar pleasure which it would
be difficult to describe. He was only restrained from approaching
by the reflection that he would cut a most ridiculous figure in
the presence of the Huron. His feelings were now such that, upon
his own account alone, he would have welcomed several days' siege.
In fact, he would have cared very little had Oonamoo been a hundred
miles distant just then.</p>

<p>But these emotions were only temporary. Five minutes later, he
felt heartily ashamed that he should have entertained them.</p>

<p>"I am certain, Edith&#11834;"</p>

<p>Further utterance was checked by an exclamation from the Huron.
Looking forth, Dernor saw that the crisis of the contest had arrived!</p>
