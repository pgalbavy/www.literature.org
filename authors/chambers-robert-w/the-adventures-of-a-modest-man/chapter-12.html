<p>"In my opinion," said I, "a man who comes to see Paris in three
months is a fool, and kin to that celebrated ass who circum-perambulated
the globe in eighty days. See all, see nothing. A man might camp
a lifetime in the Louvre and learn little about it before he left
for Père Lachaise. Yet here comes the United States in a gigantic
"<em>mônome</em>" to see the city in three weeks, when three years
is too short a time in which to appreciate the Carnavalet Museum
alone! I'm going home."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa!" said Alida.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," I snapped. "I'd rather be tried and convicted in
Oyster Bay on the charge of stealing my own pig than confess I
had 'seen Paris' in three months."</p>

<p>We had driven out to the Trocadero that day, and were now comfortably
seated in the tower of that somewhat shabby "palace," for the
purpose of obtaining a bird's eye view of the "Rive Droite" or
right bank of the Seine.</p>

<p>Elegant, modern, spotless, the Rive Droite spread out at our
feet, silver-gray squares of Renaissance architecture inlaid with
the delicate green of parks, circles, squares, and those endless
double and quadruple lines of trees which make Paris slums more
attractive than Fifth Avenue. Far as the eye could see stretched
the exquisite monotony of the Rive Droite, discreetly and artistically
broken by domes and spires of uncatalogued "monuments," in virgin
territory, unknown and unsuspected to those spiritual vandals
whose hordes raged through the boulevards, waving ten thousand
blood-red Baedekers at the paralyzed Parisians.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "now that we have 'seen' the Rive Droite, let's
cast a bird's-eye glance over Europe and Asia and go back to the
hotel for luncheon."</p>

<p>My sarcasm was lost on my daughters because they had moved out
of earshot. Alida was looking through a telescope held for her
by a friend of Captain de Barsac, an officer of artillery named
Captain Vicômte Torchon de Cluny. He was all over scarlet and
black and gold; when he walked his sabre made noises, and his
ringing spurs reminded me of the sound of sleigh-bells in Oyster
Bay.</p>

<p>My daughter Dulcima was observing the fortress of Mont-Valerien
through a tiny pair of jewelled opera-glasses, held for her by
Captain de Barsac. It was astonishing to see how tirelessly De
Barsac held those opera-glasses, which must have weighed at least
an ounce. But French officers are inured to hardships and fatigue.</p>

<p>"Is <em>that</em> a fortress?" asked Dulcima ironically. "I see
nothing but some low stone houses."</p>

<p>"Next to Gibraltar," said De Barsac, "it is the most powerful
fortress in the world, mademoiselle. It garrisons thousands of
men; its stores are enormous; it dominates not only Paris, but
all France."</p>

<p>"But where are the cannon?" asked Dulcima.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;exactly&mdash;where? That is what other nations pay millions
to find out&mdash;and cannot. Will you take my word for it that there
are one or two cannon there&mdash;and permit me to avoid particulars?"</p>

<p>"You might tell me where just one little unimportant cannon is?"
said my daughter, with the naïve curiosity which amuses the opposite
and still more curious sex.</p>

<p>"And endanger France?" asked De Barsac, with owl-like solemnity.</p>

<p>"Thank you," pouted Dulcima, perfectly aware that he was laughing.</p>

<p>Their voices became low, and relapsed into that buzzing murmur
which always defeats its own ends by arousing parental vigilance.</p>

<p>"Let us visit the aquarium," said I in a distinct and disagreeable
voice. Doubtless the "voice from the wilderness" was gratuitously
unwelcome to Messieurs De Barsac and Torchon de Cluny, but they
appeared to welcome the idea with a conciliatory alacrity noticeable
in young men when intruded upon by the parent of pretty daughters.
Dear me, how fond they appeared to be of me; what delightful information
they volunteered concerning the Trocadero, the Alexander Bridge,
the Champ de Mars.</p>

<p>The aquarium of the Trocadero is underground. To reach it you
simply walk down a hole in France and find yourself under the
earth, listening to the silvery prattle of a little brook which
runs over its bed of pebbles <em>above your head</em>, pouring
down little waterfalls into endless basins of glass which line
the damp arcades as far as you can see. The arcades themselves
are dim, the tanks, set in the solid rock, are illuminated from
above by holes in the ground, through which pours the yellow sunshine
of France.</p>

<p>Looking upward through the glass faces of the tanks you can see
the surface of the water with bubbles afloat, you can see the
waterfall tumbling in; you can catch glimpses of green grass and
bushes, and a bit of blue sky.</p>

<p>Into the tanks fall insects from the world above, and the fish
sail up to the surface and lazily suck in the hapless fly or spider
that tumbles onto the surface of the water.</p>

<p>It is a fresh-water aquarium. All the fresh-water fish of France
are represented here by fine specimens&mdash;pike, barbels, tench,
dace, perch, gudgeons, sea-trout, salmon, brown-trout, and that
lovely delicate trout-like fish called <em>l'Ombre de Chevallier</em>.
What it is I do not know, but it resembles our beautiful American
brook-trout in shape and marking; and is probably a hybrid, cultivated
by these clever French specialists in fish-propagation.</p>

<p>Coming to a long crystal-clear tank, I touched the glass with
my finger-tip, and a slender, delicate fish, colored like mother-of-pearl,
slowly turned to stare at me.</p>

<p>"This," said I, "is that aristocrat of the waters called the
'Grayling.' Notice its huge dorsal fin, its tender and diminutive
mouth. It takes a fly like a trout, but the angler who would bring
it to net must work gently and patiently, else the tender mouth
tears and the fish is lost. Is it not the most beautiful of all
fishes?</p>

<p>  "'Here and there a lusty trout;   Here and there a Grayling&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Ah, Tennyson knew. And that reminds me, Alida," I continued,
preparing to recount a personal adventure with a grayling in Austria&mdash;"that
reminds me&#11834;"</p>

<p>I turned around to find I had been addressing the empty and somewhat
humid atmosphere. My daughter Alida stood some distance away,
gazing absently at a tank full of small fry; and Captain Vicômte
Torchon de Cluny stood beside her, talking. Perhaps he was explaining
the habits of the fish in the tank.</p>

<p>My daughter Dulcima and Captain de Barsac I beheld far down the
arcades, strolling along without the faintest pretence of looking
at anything but each other.</p>

<p>"Very well," thought I to myself, "this aquarium is exactly the
place I expect to avoid in future&mdash;" And I cheerfully joined my
daughters as though they and their escorts had long missed me.</p>

<p>Now, of course, they all expressed an enthusiastic desire to
visit every tank and hear me explain the nature of their contents;
but it was too late.</p>

<p>"No," said I, "it is damp enough here to float all the fishes
in the Seine. And besides, as we are to 'see' the Rive Droite,
we should hasten, so that we may have at least half an hour to
devote to the remainder of France."</p>

<p>From the bowels of the earth we emerged into the sunshine, to
partake of an exceedingly modest luncheon in the Trocadero restaurant,
under the great waterfall.</p>

<p>Across the river a regiment of red-legged infantry marched, drums
and bugles sounding.</p>

<p>"All that territory over there," said De Barsac, "is given up
to barracks. It is an entire quarter of the city, occupied almost
exclusively by the military. There the streets run between miles
of monotonous barracks, through miles of arid parade grounds,
where all day long the <em>piou-pious</em> drill in the dust;
where the cavalry exercise; where the field-artillery go clanking
along the dreary streets toward their own exercise ground beyond
the Usine de Gaz. All day long that quarter of the city echoes
with drums beating and trumpets sounding, and the trample of passing
cavalry, and the clank and rattle of cannon. Truly, in the midst
of peace we prepare for&mdash;something else&mdash;we French."</p>

<p>"It is strange," said I, "that you have time to be the greatest
sculptors, architects, and painters in the world."</p>

<p>"In France, monsieur, we never lack time. It is only in America
that you corner time and dispense it at a profit."</p>

<p>"Time," said I, "is at once our most valuable and valueless commodity.
Our millionaires seldom have sufficient time to avoid indigestion.
Yet, although time is apparently so precious, there are among
us men who spend it in reading the New York <em>Herald</em> editorials.
I myself am often short of time, yet I take a Long Island newspaper
and sometimes even read it."</p>

<p>We had been walking through the gardens, while speaking, toward
a large crowd of people which had collected along the river. In
the centre of the crowd stood a taxicab, on the box of which danced
the cabby, gesticulating.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the scene of disturbance the first person
I saw distinctly was our acquaintance, the young man from East
Boston, hatless, dishevelled, all over dust, in the grasp of two
agents de police.</p>

<p>"He has been run over by a taxi," observed De Barsac. "They are
going to arrest him."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't they do it?" I said, indignantly, supposing
that De Barsac meant the chauffeur was to be arrested.</p>

<p>"They have done so."</p>

<p>"No, they haven't! They are holding the man who has been run
over!"</p>

<p>"Exactly. He has been run over and they are arresting him."</p>

<p>"Who?" I demanded, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Why, the man who has been run over!"</p>

<p>"But why, in Heaven's name!"</p>

<p>"Why? Because he allowed himself to be run over!"</p>

<p>"What!" I cried. "They arrest the man who has been run over,
and not the man who ran over him?"</p>

<p>"It is the law," said De Barsac, coolly.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that the <em>runner</em> is left free,
while the <em>runnee</em> is arrested?" I asked in deadly calmness,
reducing my question to legal and laconic language impossible
to misinterpret.</p>

<p>"Exactly. The person who permits a vehicle to run over him in
defiance of the French law, which says that nobody ought to let
himself be run over, is liable to arrest, imprisonment, and fine&mdash;unless,
of course, so badly injured that recovery is impossible."</p>

<p>Now at last I understood the Dreyfus Affaire. Now I began to
comprehend the laws of the Bandarlog. Now I could follow the subtle
logic of the philosophy embodied in "Alice in Wonderland" and
"Through the Looking-Glass!"</p>

<p>This was the country for me! Why, certainly; these people here
could understand a man who was guilty of stealing his own pig.</p>

<p>"I think I should like to live in Paris again," I said to my
daughters; then I approached the young man from East Boston and
bade him cheer up.</p>

<p>He was not hurt; he was only rumpled and dusty and hopping mad.</p>

<p>"I shall pay their darned fine," he said. "Then I'm going to
hire a cab and drive it myself, and hunt up that cabman who ran
over me, by Judas!"</p>

<p>That night I met Williams at the Café Jaune by previous and crafty
agreement; and it certainly was nice to be together after all
these years in the same old seats in the same café, and discuss
the days that we never could live again&mdash;and wouldn't want to
if we could&mdash;alas!</p>

<p>The talk fell on Ellis and Jones, and immediately I perceived
that Williams had skillfully steered the conversation toward those
two young men&mdash;and I knew devilish well he had a story to tell
me about them.</p>

<p>So I cut short his side-stepping and circling, and told him to
be about it as I wanted to devote one or two hours that night
to a matter which I had recently neglected &mdash;Sleep.</p>

<p>"That Jones," he said, "was a funny fellow. He and Ellis didn't
meet over here; Ellis was before his time. But they became excellent
friends under rather unusual circumstances.</p>

<p>"Ellis, you know, was always getting some trout fishing when
he was over here. He was a good deal of a general sportsman. As
for Jones&mdash;well, you remember that he had no use for anything
more strenuous than a motor tour."</p>

<p>"I remember," I said.</p>
