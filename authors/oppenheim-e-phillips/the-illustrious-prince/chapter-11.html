Mr. Robert Blaine-Harvey, American Ambassador and Plenipotentiary
Extraordinary to England, was a man of great culture, surprising
personal gifts, and with a diplomatic instinct which amounted
almost to genius. And yet there were times when he was puzzled.
For at least half an hour he had been sitting in his great
library, looking across the Park, and trying to make up his mind
on a very important matter. It seemed to him that he was face to
face with what amounted almost to a crisis in his career. His two
years at the Court of St. James had been pleasant and uneventful
enough. The small questions which had presented themselves for
adjustment between the two countries were, after all, of no
particular importance and were easily arranged. The days seemed
to have gone by for that over-strained sensitiveness which was
continually giving rise to senseless bickerings, when every
trilling breeze seemed to fan the smouldering fires of jealousy.
The two great English-speaking nations appeared finally to have
realized the absolute folly of continual disputes between
countries whose destiny and ideals were so completely in accord
and whose interests were, in the main, identical. A period of
absolute friendliness had ensued. And now there had come this
little cloud. It was small enough at present, but Mr. Harvey was
not the one to overlook its sinister possibilities. Two citizens
of his country had been barbarously murdered within the space of
a few hours, one in the heart of the most thickly populated
capital in the world, and there was a certain significance
attached to this fact which the Ambassador himself and those
others at Washington perfectly well realized. He glanced once
more at the most recent letter on the top of this pile of
correspondence and away again out into the Park. It was a
difficult matter, this. His friends at Washington did not
cultivate the art of obscurity in the words which they used, and
it had been suggested to him in black and white that the murder
of these two men, under the particular circumstances existing,
was a matter concerning which he should speak very plainly indeed
to certain August personages. Mr. Harvey, who was a born
diplomatist, understood the difficulties of such a proceeding a
good deal more than those who had propounded it.
<P>
There was a knock at the door, and a footman entered, ushering in
a visitor.
<P>
"The young lady whom you were expecting, sir," he announced
discreetly.
<P>
Mr. Harvey rose at once to his feet.
<P>
"My dear Penelope," he said, shaking hands with her, "this is
charming of you."
<P>
Penelope smiled.
<P>
"It seems quite like old times to feel myself at home here once
more," she declared.
<P>
Mr. Harvey did not pursue the subject. He was perfectly well
aware that Penelope, who had been his first wife's greatest
friend, had never altogether forgiven him for his somewhat brief
period of mourning. He drew an easy chair up to the side of his
desk and placed a footstool for her.
<P>
"I should not have sent for you," he said, "but I am really and
honestly in a dilemma. Do you know that, apart from endless
cables, Washington has favored me with one hundred and forty
pages of foolscap all about the events of the week before last?"
<P>
Penelope shivered a little.
<P>
"Poor Dicky!" she murmured, looking away into the fire. "And to
think that it was I who sent him to his death!"
<P>
Mr. Harvey shook his head.
<P>
"No," he said, "I do not think that you need reproach yourself
with that. As a matter of fact, I think that I should have sent
Dicky in any case. He is not so well known as the others, or
rather he wasn't associated so closely with the Embassy, and he
was constantly at the Savoy on his own account. If I had believed
that there was any danger in the enterprise," he continued, "I
should still have sent him. He was as strong as a young Hercules.
The hand which twisted that noose around his neck must have been
the hand of a magician with fingers of steel."
<P>
Penelope shivered again. Her face showed signs of distress.
<P>
"I do not think," she said, "that I am a nervous person, but I
cannot bear to think of it even now."
<P>
"Naturally," Mr. Harvey answered. "We were all fond of Dicky, and
such a thing has never happened, so far as I am aware, in any
European country. My own private secretary murdered in broad
daylight and with apparent impunity!"
<P>
"Murdered--and robbed!" she whispered, looking up at him with a
white face.
<P>
The frown on the Ambassador's forehead darkened.
<P>
"Not only that," he declared, "but the secrets of which he was
robbed have gone to the one country interested in the knowledge
of them."
<P>
"You are sure of that?" she asked hoarsely.
<P>
"I am sure of it," Mr. Harvey answered.
<P>
Penelope drew a little breath between her teeth. Her thoughts
flashed back to a recent dinner party. The Prince was once more
at her side. Almost she could hear his voice--low, clear, and yet
with that note of inexpressible, convincing finality. She heard
him speak of his country reverently, almost prayerfully; of the
sacrifices which true patriotism must always demand. What had
been in his mind, she wondered, at the back of his inscrutable
eyes, gazing, even at that moment, past the banks of flowers,
across the crowded room with all its splendor of light and color,
through the walls,--whither! She brushed the thought away. It was
absurd, incredible! She was allowing herself to be led away by
her old distrust of this man.
<P>
"I remarked just now," Mr. Harvey continued, "that such a thing
had never happened, so far as I was aware, in any European
country. My own words seem to suggest something to me. These
methods are not European. They savor more of the East."
<P>
"I think you had better go on," she said quietly. "There is
something in your mind. I can see that. You have told me so much
that you had better tell me the rest."
<P>
"The contents of those despatches," Mr. Harvey continued,
"intrusted in duplicate, as you have doubtless surmised, to Fynes
and to Coulson, contained an assurance that the sending of our
fleet to the Pacific was in fact, as well as in appearance, an
errand of peace. It was a demonstration, pure and simple. Behind
it there may have lain, indeed, a masterful purpose, the
determination of a great country to affirm her strenuous
existence in a manner most likely to impress the nations unused
to seeing her in such a role. It became necessary, in view of
certain suspicions, for me to be able to prove to the Government
here the absolutely pacific nature of our great enterprise. Those
despatches contained such proof. And now listen, Penelope. Before
the murder of poor Dicky Vanderpole, we know for a fact that a
great nation who chooses to consider herself our enemy in Eastern
waters was straining every nerve to prepare for war. Today those
preparations have slackened. A great loan has been withdrawn in
Paris, an invitation cabled to our fleet to visit Yokohama. These
things have a plain reading."
<P>
"Plain, indeed," Penelope assented, and she spoke in a low tone
because there was fear in her heart. "Why have you told me about
them? They throw a new light upon everything,--an awful light!"
<P>
"I have known you," the Ambassador said quietly, "since you were
a baby. Every member of your family has been a friend of mine.
You come of a silent race. I know very well that you are a person
of discretion. There are certain small ways in which a government
can occasionally be served by the help of some one outside its
diplomatic service altogether, some one who could not possibly be
connected with it. You know this very well, Penelope, because you
have already been of service to us on more than one occasion."
<P>
"It was a long time ago," she murmured.
<P>
"Not so very long," he reminded her. "But for the first of these
tragedies, Fynes' despatches would have reached me through you. I
am going to ask your help even once more."
<P>
In the somewhat cold spring sunlight which came streaming through
the large window, Penelope seemed a little pallid, as though,
indeed, the fatigue of the season, even in this its earlier
stages, were leaving its mark upon her. There were violet rims
under her eyes. A certain alertness seemed to have deserted her
usually piquant face. She sat listening with the air of one half
afraid, who has no hope of hearing pleasant things.
<P>
"It has been remarked," Mr. Harvey continued, "or rather I may
say that I myself have noticed, that you are on exceedingly
friendly terms with a very distinguished nobleman who is at
present visiting this country--I mean, of course, Prince Maiyo."
<P>
Her eyebrows were slowly elevated. Was that really the impression
people had! Her lips just moved.
<P>
"Well?" she asked.
<P>
"I have met Prince Maiyo myself," Mr. Harvey continued, "and I
have found him a charming representative of his race. I am not
going to say a word against him. If he were an American, we
should be proud of him. If he belonged to any other country, we
should accept him at once for what he appears to be.
Unfortunately, however, he belongs to a country which we have
some reason to mistrust. He belongs to a country in whose
national character we have not absolute confidence. For that
reason, my dear Penelope, we mistrust Prince Maiyo."
<P>
"I do not know him so well as you seem to imagine," Penelope said
slowly. "We are not even friends, in the ordinary acceptation of
the word. I am, to some extent, prejudiced against him. Yet I do
not believe that he is capable of a dishonorable action."
<P>
"Nor do I," the Ambassador declared smoothly. "Yet in every
country, almost in every man, the exact standard of dishonor
varies. A man will lie for a woman's sake, and even in the law
courts, certainly at his clubs and amongst his friends, it will
be accounted to his righteousness. A patriot will lie and
intrigue for his country's sake. Now I believe that to Prince
Maiyo Japan stands far above the whole world of womankind. I
believe that for her sake he would go to very great lengths
indeed."
<P>
"Go on, please," Penelope murmured.
<P>
"The Prince is over here on some sort of an errand which it isn't
our business to understand," Mr. Harvey said. "I have heard it
rumored that it is a special mission entirely concerned with the
renewal of the treaty between England and Japan. However that may
be, I have sat here, and I have thought, and I have come to this
conclusion, ridiculous though it may seem to you at first. I
believe that somewhere behind the hand which killed and robbed
Hamilton Fynes and poor Dicky stood the benevolent shadow of our
friend Prince Maiyo."
<P>
"You have no proof?" she asked breathlessly.
<P>
"No proof at all," the Ambassador admitted. "I am scarcely in a
position to search for any. The conclusion I have come to has
been simply arrived at through putting a few facts together and
considering them in the light of certain events. In the first
place, we cannot doubt that the secret of those despatches
reached at once the very people whom we should have preferred to
remain in ignorance of them. Haven't I told you of the sudden
cessation of the war alarm in Japan, when once she was assured,
by means which she could not mistrust, that it was not the
intention of the American nation to make war upon her? The
subtlety of those murders, and the knowledge by which they were
inspired, must have come from some one in an altogether unique
position. You may be sure that no one connected with the Japanese
Embassy here would be permitted for one single second to take
part in any such illegal act. They know better than that, these
wily Orientals. They will play the game from Grosvenor Place
right enough. But Prince Maiyo is here, and stands apart from any
accredited institution, although he has the confidence of his
Ambassador and can command the entire devotion of his own secret
service. I have not come to this conclusion hastily. I have
thought it out, step by step, and in my own mind I am now
absolutely convinced that both these murders were inspired by
Prince Maiyo."
<P>
"Even if this were so," Penelope said, "what can I do? Why have
you sent for me? The Prince and I are not on especially friendly
terms. It is only just lately that we have been decently civil to
one another."
<P>
The Ambassador looked at her with some surprise.
<P>
"My dear Penelope," he said, "I have seen you together the last
three or four evenings. The Prince looks at no one else while you
are there. He talks to you, I know, more freely than to any other
woman."
<P>
"It is by chance," Penelope protested. "I have tried to avoid
him."
<P>
"Then I cannot congratulate you upon your success," Mr. Harvey
said grimly.
<P>
"Things have changed a little between us, perhaps," Penelope
said. "What is it that you really want?"
<P>
"I want to know this," the Ambassador said slowly. "I want to
know how Japan became assured that America had no intention of
going to war with her. In other words, I want to know whether
those papers which were stolen from Fynes and poor Dicky found
their way to the Japanese Embassy or into the hands of Prince
Maiyo himself."
<P>
"Anything else?" she asked with a faint note of sarcasm in her
tone.
<P>
"Yes," Mr. Harvey replied, "there is something else. I should
like to know what attitude Prince Maiyo takes towards the
proposed renewal of the treaty between his country and Great
Britain."
<P>
She shook her head.
<P>
"Even if we were friends," she said, "the very closest of
friends, he would never tell me. He is far too clever."
<P>
"Do not be too sure," Mr. Harvey said. "Sometimes a man,
especially an Oriental, who does not understand the significance
of your sex in these matters, can be drawn on to speak more
freely to a woman than he would ever dream of doing to his best
friend. He would not tell you in as many words, of course. On the
other hand, he might show you what was in his mind."
<P>
"He is going back very shortly," Penelope remarked.
<P>
Mr. Harvey nodded.
<P>
"That is why I sent for you to come immediately. You will see him
tonight at Devenham House."
<P>
"With all the rest of the world," she answered, "but a man is not
likely to talk confidentially under such conditions."
<P>
Mr. Harvey rose to his feet.
<P>
"It is only a chance, of course," he admitted, "but remember that
you know more than any other person in this country except
myself. It would be impossible for the Prince to give you credit
for such knowledge. A casual remark, a word, perhaps, may be
sufficient."
<P>
Penelope held out her hand. The servant for whom the Ambassador
had rung was already in the room.
<P>
"I will try," she promised. "Ask Mrs. Harvey to excuse my going
up to see her this afternoon. I have another call to make, and I
want to rest before the function tonight."
<P>
The Ambassador bowed, and escorted her to the door.
<P>
"I have confidence in you, Penelope," he said. "You will try your
best?"
<P>
"Oh, yes!"she answered with a queer little laugh, "I shall do
that. But I don't think that even you quite understand Prince
Maiyo!"
