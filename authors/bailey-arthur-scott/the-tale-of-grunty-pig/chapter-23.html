<p>One day when Grunty Pig was at home, in the pigpen, a squeaky voiced
piped "Good morning!" to him. Looking up, Grunty saw a plump little
gentleman clinging to the top board on one side of the pen.
</p>
<p>"Good morning!" Grunty answered. "May I inquire what your name is?"
</p><p>"I'm Moses Mouse," his caller replied.
</p><p>"Do you live in the piggery?--or in the barn?" Grunty asked him.
</p><p>"Neither!" said Moses Mouse. "I live in the farmhouse. My wife and I
have a nest in the wall.... The cat's away," he explained. "That's why
I decided to stroll across the yard and visit you folks out here."
</p><p>"Some people," said Grunty Pig, "have all the luck. You live in the
farmhouse. Miss Kitty Cat lives in the farmhouse--when she's at home.
And old dog Spot spends a good deal of his time there--especially in
cold weather. It must be pleasant to have your home where there's always
plenty to eat, whenever you happen to feel hungry."
</p><p>"Miss Kitty Cat and old dog Spot always fare well," Mr. Mouse admitted.
"But I've often gone to bed half starved. Maybe you didn't know that
Mrs. Green is terribly neat. She doesn't leave much food around for us
Mice."
</p><p>"Well," Grunty remarked, "it's an honor, anyhow, to live in the
farmhouse. You ought not to complain about the food, even if it is a
bit scarce at times. I'd be glad to live there. And I dare say I'd find
a plenty to eat. The farmhouse is where the sour milk comes from."
</p><p>"If you feel like that," said Moses Mouse, "why don't you join us? Why
don't you come to the farmhouse for the winter, anyhow?"
</p><p>Grunty Pig shook his head.
</p><p>"No!" he said, half to himself. "No! I can't do it."
</p><p>"Why not?" Mr. Mouse wanted to know.
</p><p>"I've never been invited," Grunty told him, with something like a frown.
</p><p>Moses Mouse surprised him with a merry laugh.
</p><p>"Ho!" he exclaimed. "Neither have I. If I had waited for an invitation I
wouldn't be living in the farmhouse. I'd have shivered my days out in
the barn."
</p><p>Grunty Pig looked at his caller with growing interest. He would have
said that so tiny a gentleman would be too timid to crowd in where he
wasn't asked.
</p><p>"Don't wait any longer for an invitation," Moses Mouse urged him. "Go to
the farmhouse and walk right in."
</p><p>"Oughtn't I to rap?" Grunty inquired.
</p><p>"Certainly not!" said Moses Mouse. "Make yourself right at home. Act as
if the farmhouse belonged to you. That's the way I do. And nobody ever
bothers me, except Miss Kitty Cat--or Miss Snooper, as we Mice call her.
Even she can't drive me away from the farmhouse. I lived there before
she ever came to Pleasant Valley."
</p><p>"She certainly couldn't drive me away," Grunty Pig muttered. "Besides,
didn't you say she was away herself?"
</p><p>"Yes!" said Moses Mouse. "And I hope she has gone for good."
</p><p>"Then," said Grunty Pig, "it ought to be quite safe for me to go to the
farmhouse. And as soon as I have a chance to get out of this pen I'll do
as you suggest."
</p><p>"Good!" cried Moses Mouse. And he said that he hoped to have many a chat
with Grunty, at the farmhouse.
</p><p>"Umph!" said Grunty Pig. And Mr. Mouse was much pleased, for he took
that to mean "Yes!"
