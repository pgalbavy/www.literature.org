<p>Long and hard rode Tom Hardynge after his escape from the beleaguring
Apaches, for he was determined to save Ned and Dick if the thing
were within the range of human possibility. His mustang seemed
to understand what was expected of him, and he required no urging
from his master to maintain his arrowy flight. It was a literal
race between life and death. If he could reach Fort Havens in
time to procure succor, the man and the boy were saved. If not,
then they were doomed.</p>

<p>At daylight he was among the mountains, and the steed paused
a few seconds to swallow a little water from a tiny stream. An
hour later he ascended an elevation, and from his back the rider
took a survey of the plain stretched out before him.</p>

<p>Far away in the distance a dark, stationary object was discerned.
A keen eye could detect something fluttering above it in the wind.
That was the star-spangled banner, waving above Fort Havens. Yonder
was the destination toward which the little party had been laboring
for days and which there was no assurance of still reaching. The
scout had not yet passed half the distance intervening between
the fort and Hurricane Hill. Mercy to his beast compelled him
to give him a brief rest and an opportunity to eat a little food.
Then, away again.</p>

<p>It was the middle of the afternoon, and Tom was nearing the fort,
which was in distinct view a few miles ahead, when his attention
was arrested by the sight of a number of men moving along to the
north, and in a contrary direction to that which he himself was
following. They suddenly emerged from some hills, and rode at
a sweeping gallop. What surprised the hunter was the discovery
that they were United States cavalry, that had evidently come
from Fort Havens itself! How their appearance could be explained
was more than he could understand; but he saw at once that if
their co-operation could be secured, several hours' valuable time
might be saved. He turned the head of his mustang in that direction
and rode at the same tearing speed as before.</p>

<p>The cavalry detected his coming, reined up and awaited his approach.
The afternoon was well advanced when the hunter drew rein in front
of the company, and saluted the chief officer, who was Colonel
Chadmund himself, the commandant of Fort Havens, at the head of
seventy-five veteran cavalry. He recognized the scout, and rode
forward to meet him.</p>

<p>"Any news of my little boy, Tom?" he asked, before their palms
crossed.</p>

<p>"Alive and well."</p>

<p>"Thank God! thank God!" exclaimed the white-faced officer, trembling
with joy. "Have the Indians caught him?"</p>

<p>"No; but he is in danger. What are you doing with these men here?"</p>

<p>"An Indian came into the fort several hours ago, with the word
that Lone Wolf and a party of Apaches had driven two or three
persons to the top of Hurricane Hill, where they would soon be
caught unless assistance was sent them. The Indian is one of our
regular scouts, in whom we have much confidence, and thinking
it might be you, with possibly my little Ned, I put myself at
the head of the company and started out to see. I had very little
hope, however, of seeing him alive, for news had reached us of
the massacre of the escort party in Devil's Pass."</p>

<p>Hardynge, in a few minutes, explained the situation, and the
colonel was all excitement to be off again. Every hour&mdash;every
minute, indeed&mdash;was precious to him, and, as the two rode back,
the advance was resumed without a moment's delay. Instead of proceeding
back in a direct line, however, over the path traveled by the
scout, they made a detour to the northward, the configuration
of the country being such that a much nearer approach, undiscovered,
could be made from this direction than from any other.</p>

<p>There were several extra horses in the company, one of which
was appropriated by Tom, while he left his own to roam over the
plain and reach the fort whenever his disposition should take
him in that direction. Colonel Chadmund had taken the precaution
to mount all his men upon the best steeds at command, and they
were driven into a rapid, telling pace. They made good progress,
but when the sun set they had not yet reached a point from which
the most distant view of Hurricane Hill could be obtained. A more
moderate speed was kept up until midnight, when they went into
camp, picketed their animals, and resumed the march at daybreak.
The horses were forced to the greatest possible endurance, but
never did miles seem so long. It was high noon before a point
among the hills on the north was reached from which a fair view
of the pile of rocks could be obtained. Colonel Chadmund produced
his glass, and scrutinized the towering-like mass, in quest of
some sign of the defenders. Not the least could be obtained; but
he saw at the base the band of Apaches, spread out like a miniature
besieging army, and this, to the minds of all, was proof that
the garrison of Hurricane Hill were still at the post of duty.</p>

<p>It was necessary to approach as close to the spot as possible
without discovery, and then to charge down upon the Indians with
such fiery impetuosity that they would have no time to inflict
any damage upon the brave defenders. The appearance of the cavalry
would apprise them that the siege was at an end, and in the gnawing
rage thereat, they might charge up the incline and open a fire,
which would riddle Dick and Ned and from which there would be
no escape.</p>

<p>Colonel Chadmund understood Indian warfare so well as to know
that Lone Wolf had his scouts out, and it would be a difficult
matter to avoid them. Still the attempt was made, and by the middle
of the afternoon, the cavalry had reached a point barely two miles
away without his presence being suspected.</p>

<p>"I've been watching the place for half an hour," said the colonel,
as he lowered his glass, and handed it to Tom Hardynge, standing
at his elbow, "and it seems to me that the top of Hurricane Hill
is deserted, although the Apaches at the base seem to point the
other way."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," replied the hunter, impatiently. "You
don't 'spose they'd stand up in sight all the time, like a couple
of spoonies gettin' their pictures took? They're watchin' the
path that leads up to where they be."</p>

<p>It required but a few minutes to conclude their preparations,
when the seventy odd cavalrymen, armed to the teeth, burst forth
from the hills like a mountain torrent, and charged straight for
Lone Wolf and his band. The latter, of course, were quick to detect
it, and drew up with the purpose of making a fight; but when they
took in the strength of the company approaching, they changed
their minds, and broke and scattered like chaff before the whirlwind.</p>

<p>This was a severe disappointment, for the colonel and a dozen
of his best Indian fighters had arranged to make a determined
effort to rid the country of this pest. These were the best mounted
in the company, and in their eagerness they sped straight ahead
after the redskins, still hoping that some turn of fortune's wheel
would give them the coveted chance. But the mustangs of the Apaches
were fresh and fleet, and they had no purpose of meeting the United
States cavalry where there was anything like an equal advantage;
so they continued their flight with such persistent celerity that
they soon vanished from view.</p>

<p>The heart of Colonel Chadmund misgave him as he galloped toward
Hurricane Hill and saw no sign of life there. But while he was
alternating between hope and despair, the figure of a man appeared
around the corner of the rock, and then the form of a little boy
was discerned, as he came running across the prairie with out-stretched
arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, father! father!"</p>

<p>Colonel Chadmund leaped from the back of his horse and ran to
meet him.</p>

<p>"My darling boy! God be thanked!"</p>

<p>The stern old soldier wept like a child as he caught him in his
arms and hugged him to his breast, while more than one rough soldier,
looking on, dashed the tears from his eyes and tried to look as
if he were thinking of something else.</p>

<p>The danger was passed. Little Ned, carried in triumph to the
fort, remained the appointed time with his father at this advanced
frontier post, and when he returned to Santa Fe to his beloved
mother it was with an escort which guaranteed his safety.</p>

<p>Thus ended his adventures with what were then the scourges of
the great Southwest, but the memory of them is indelible and not
to be subdued by the lapse of years. In his manhood days he looks
back upon those troublous times when the wild riders left the
bones of venturesome white men to whiten upon the banks of the
Gila; and, although remembrance brings its thrill of excitement,
it is coupled with a shudder whenever Ned Chadmund thinks of his
passage "Through Apache Land."</p>
