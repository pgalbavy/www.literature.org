<P>
A few rays of fugitive sunshine were brightening Piccadilly when Geraldine and
her escort left the Ritz.  The momentary depression occasioned by the dramatic
little episode of a few minutes ago, seemed already to have passed from the
girl's manner.  She walked on, humming to herself.  As they paused to cross
the road, she glanced as though involuntarily at her companion.  His dark
morning clothes and rather abstracted air created an atmosphere of sombreness
about him of which she was suddenly conscious.
<P>
"Hugh, why don't you wear uniform in town?" she asked.
<P>
"Why should I?" he replied.  "After all, I am not really a fighting man, you
see."
<P>
"It's so becoming," she sighed.
<P>
He seemed to catch the reminiscent flash in her eyes as she looked down the
street, and a shadow of foreboding clouded his mind.
<P>
"You found Captain Granet interesting?"
<P>
"Very," she assented heartily.  "I think he is delightful, don't you?"
<P>
"He certainly seems to be a most attractive type of young man," Thomson
admitted.
<P>
"And how wonderful to have had such adventures!" she continued.  "Life has
become so strange, though, during the last few months.  To think that the only
time I ever saw him before was at a polo match, and to-day we sit side by side
in a restaurant, and, although he won't speak of them, one knows that he has
had all manner of marvellous adventures.  He was one of those who went
straight from the playing fields to look for glory, wasn't he, Hugh?  He made
a hundred and thirty-two for Middlesex the day before the war was declared."
<P>
"That's the type of young soldier who's going to carry us through, if any one
can," Major Thomson agreed cheerfully.
<P>
She suddenly clutched at his arm.
<P>
"Hugh," she exclaimed, pointing to a placard which a newsboy was carrying,
"that is the one thing I cannot bear, the one thing which I think if I were a
man would turn me into a savage!"
<P>
They both paused and read the headlines--
<P>
PASSENGER STEAMER TORPEDOED WITHOUT WARNING IN THE IRISH SEA.  TWENTY-TWO
LIVES LOST.
<P>
"That is the sort of thing," she groaned, "which makes one long to be not a
man but a god, to be able to wield thunderbolts and to deal out hell!"
<P>
"Good for you, Gerry," a strong, fresh voice behind them declared.  "That's my
job now.  Didn't you hear us shouting after you, Olive and I?  Look!"
<P>
Her brother waved a telegram.
<P>
"You've got your ship?" Thomson inquired.
<P>
"I've got what I wanted," the young man answered enthusiastically.  "I've got
a destroyer, one of the new type--forty knots an hour, a dear little row of
four-inch guns, and, my God! something else, I hope, that'll teach those
murderers a lesson," he added, shaking his fist towards the placard.
<P>
Geraldine laid her hand upon her brother's arm.
<P>
"When do you join, Ralph?"
<P>
"To-morrow night at Portsmouth," he replied.  "I'm afraid we shall be several
days before we are at work.  It's the Scorpion' they're giving me, Gerald--or
the mystery ship, as they call it in the navy."
<P>
"Why?" she asked.
<P>
His rather boyish face, curiously like his sister's, was suddenly transformed.
<P>
"Because we've got a rod in pickle for those cursed pirates--"
<P>
"Conyers!" Thomson interrupted.
<P>
The young man paused in his sentence.  Thomson was looking towards him with a
slight frown upon his forehead.
<P>
"Don't think I'm a fearful old woman," he said.  "I know we are all rather fed
up with these tales of spies and that sort of thing, but do you think it's
wise to even open your lips about a certain matter?"
<P>
"What the dickens do you know about it?" Conyers demanded.
<P>
"Nothing," Thomson assured him hastily, "nothing at all.  I am only going by
what you said yourself.  If there is any device on the Scorpion for dealing
with these infernal craft, I'd never breathe a word about it, if I were you. 
I'd put out to sea with a seal upon my lips, even before Geraldine here and
Miss Moreton."
<P>
The young man's cheeks were a little flushed.
<P>
"Perhaps you're right," he admitted.  "I was a little over-excited.  To get
the Scorpion was more, even, than I had dared to hope fore.  Still, before the
girls it didn't seem to matter very much.  There are no spies, anyhow, hiding
in the tress of Berkeley Street," he added, glancing about them.
<P>
Thomson held up his finger and stopped a taxicab.  
<P>
"You won't be annoyed with me, will you?" he said to Conyers.  "If you'd heard
half the stories I had of the things we have given away quite innocently--"
<P>
"That's all right," the young man interrupted, "only you mustn't think I'm a
gas-bag just because I said a word or two here before Gerry and Olive and you,
old fellow."
<P>
"Must you go, Hugh?" Geraldine asked.
<P>
"I am so sorry," he replied, "but I must.  I really have rather an important
appointment this afternoon."
<P>
"An appointment!" she grumbled.  "You are in London for so short a time and
you seem to be keeping appointments all the while.  I sha'nt let you go unless
you tell me what it's about."
<P>
"I have to inspect a new pattern of camp beadstead," he explained calmly.  "If
I may, I will telephone directly I am free and see if you are at liberty."
<P>
She shrugged her shoulders but gave him a pleasant little nod as he stepped
into the taxi.
<P>
"Sober old stick, Thomson," her brother observed, as they started off.  "I
didn't like his pulling me up like that but I expect he was right."
<P>
"I don't see what business it was of his and I think it was rather horrid of
him," Olive declared.  "As though Gerry or I mattered!"
<P>
"A chap like Thomson hasn't very much discretion, you see," Ralph Conyers
remarked.  "You'll have to wake him up a bit, Gerry, if you mean to get any
fun out of life."
<P>
There was just the faintest look of trouble in Geraldine's face.  She remained
perfectly loyal, however.
<P>
"Some of us take life more seriously than others," she sighed.  "Hugh is one
of them.  When one remembers all the terrible things he must have seen,
though, it is very hard to find fault with him."
<P>
They turned into the Square and paused before Olive's turning.
<P>
"You're coming down with me, Ralph, and you too, Geraldine?" she invited.
<P>
Conyers shook his head regretfully.
<P>
"I'm due at the Admiralty at four to receive my final instructions," he said. 
"I must move along at once."
<P>
The smile suddenly faded from his lips.  He seemed to be listening to the
calling of the newsboys down the street.  I don't know what my instructions
are going to be," he continued, dropping his voice a little, "but I'm sick of
making war the way our chaps are doing it.  If ever I'm lucky enough to get
one of those murderous submarines, I can promise you one thing--there'll be no
survivors."
<P>
For a moment or two they neither of them spoke.  From out of the windows of
the house before which they were standing came the music of a popular waltz. 
Olive turned a way with a little shiver.
<P>
"You think I'm brutal, dear," Conyers went on, as he patted her hand. 
"Remember, I've seen men killed--that's what makes the difference, Olive. 
Yes, I am different!  We are all different, we who've tackled the job. 
Thomson's different.  You young man at luncheon, Geraldine--what's his
name?--Granet--he's different.  There's something big and serious grown up
inside us, and the brute is looking out.  It has to be.  I'll come in later,
Olive.  Tell the mater I shall be home to dinner, Geraldine.  The governor's
waiting down at the Admiralty for me.  Good-bye, girls!"
<P>
He waved his hand and strode down towards the corner of the Square.  Both
girls watched him for a few moments.  His shoulders were as square as ever but
something had gone from the springiness of his gait.  There was nothing left
of the sailor's jaunty swagger.
<P>
"They are all like that," Geraldine whispered "when they've been face to face
with the real thing.  And we are only women, Olive."
