<p>I will not linger over the two films of this second performance and
the evident connection between them. At the present moment we are too
near the close of this extraordinary story to waste time over minute,
tedious, unimportant details. We must remember that, on the following
morning, a newspaper printed the first part, and, a few hours later,
the second part of the famous Prévotelle report, in which the problem
was attacked in so masterly a fashion and solved with so profoundly
impressive a display of method and logic. I shall never forget it. I
shall never forget that, during that night, while I sat in my bedroom
reflecting upon the manner in which Massignac had been spirited away,
during that night when the long-expected thunderstorm burst over the
Paris district, Benjamin Prévotelle was writing the opening pages of
his report. And I shall never forget that I was on the point of
hearing of all this from Benjamin Prévotelle himself!
</p><p>At ten o'clock, in fact, one of the neighbours living nearest to the
lodge, from whose house my uncle or Bérangère had been in the habit of
telephoning, sent word to say that he was connected with Paris and
that I was asked to come to the telephone without losing a minute.
</p><p>I went round in a very bad temper. I was worn out with fatigue. It was
raining cats and dogs; and the night was so dark that I knocked
against the trees and houses as I walked.
</p><p>The moment I arrived, I took up the receiver. Some one at the other
end addressed me in a trembling voice:
</p><p>"M. Beaugrand . . . M. Beaugrand . . . Excuse me . . . I have
discovered . . ."
</p><p>I did not understand at first and asked who was speaking.
</p><p>"My name will convey nothing to you," was the answer. "Benjamin
Prévotelle. I'm not a person of any particular importance. I am an
engineer by profession; I left the Central School two years ago."
</p><p>I interrupted him:
</p><p>"One moment, please, one moment. . . . Hullo! . . . Are you there?
. . . Benjamin Prévotelle? But I know your name! . . . Yes, I
remember, I've seen it in my uncle's papers."
</p><p>"Do you mean that? You've seen my name in Noël Dorgeroux's papers?"
</p><p>"Yes, in the middle of a paper, without comment of any kind."
</p><p>The speaker's excitement increased:
</p><p>"Oh," he said, "can it be possible? If Noël Dorgeroux made a note of
my name, it proves that he read a pamphlet of mine, a year ago, and
that he believed in the explanation of which I am beginning to catch a
glimpse to-day."
</p><p>"What explanation?" I asked, somewhat impatiently.
</p><p>"You'll understand, monsieur, you'll understand when you read my
report."
</p><p>"Your report?"
</p><p>"A report which I am writing now, to-night. . . . Listen: I was
present at both the exhibitions in the Yard and I have discovered.
. . ."
</p><p>"Discovered what, hang it all?"
</p><p>"The problem, monsieur, the solution of the problem."
</p><p>"What!" I exclaimed. "You've discovered it?"
</p><p>"Yes, monsieur. I may tell you it's a very simple problem, so simple
that I am anxious to be first in the field. Imagine, if any one else
were to publish the truth before me! So I rang up Meudon on the chance
of getting you called to the telephone. . . . Oh, do listen to me,
monsieur: you must believe me and help me. . . ."
</p><p>"Of course, of course," I replied, "but I don't quite see . . ."
</p><p>"Yes, yes," Benjamin Prévotelle implored, appealing to me, clinging to
me, so to speak, in a despairing tone of voice. "You can do a great
deal. I only want a few particulars. . . ."
</p><p>I confess that Benjamin Prévotelle's statements left me a little
doubtful. However, I answered:
</p><p>"If a few particulars can be of any use to you . . ."
</p><p>"Perhaps one alone will do," he said. "It's this. The wall with the
screen was entirely rebuilt by your uncle, Noël Dorgeroux, was it
not?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"And this wall, as you have said and as every one had observed, forms
a given angle with its lower part."
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"On the other hand, according to your depositions, Noël Dorgeroux
intended to have a second amphitheatre built in his garden and to use
the back of the same wall as a screen. That's so, is it not?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Well, this is the particular which I want you to give me. Have you
noticed whether the back of the wall forms the same angle with its
lower part?"
</p><p>"Yes, I've noticed that."
</p><p>"In that case," said Benjamin Prévotelle, with a note of increasing
triumph in his voice, "the evidence is complete. Noël Dorgeroux and I
are agreed. The pictures do not come from the wall itself. The cause
lies elsewhere. I will prove it; and, if M. Massignac would show a
little willingness to help . . ."
</p><p>"Théodore Massignac was kidnapped this evening," I remarked.
</p><p>"Kidnapped? What do you mean?"
</p><p>I repeated:
</p><p>"Yes, kidnapped; and I presume that the amphitheatre will be closed
until further notice."
</p><p>"But this is terrible, it's awful!" gasped Benjamin Prévotelle. "Why,
in that case they couldn't verify my theory! There would never be any
more pictures! No, look here, it's impossible. Just think, I don't
know the indispensable formula! Nobody does, except Massignac. Oh, no,
it is absolutely necessary . . . Hullo, hullo! Don't cut me off,
mademoiselle! . . . One moment more, monsieur. I'll tell you the whole
truth about the pictures. Three or four words will be enough. . . .
Hullo, hullo! . . ."
</p><p>Benjamin Prévotelle's voice suddenly died away. I was clearly aware of
the insuperable distance that separated him from me at the very moment
when I was about to learn the miraculous truth which he in his turn
laid claim to have discovered.
</p><p>I waited anxiously. A few minutes passed. Twice the telephone-bell
rang without my receiving any call. I decided to go away and had
reached the bottom of the stairs when I was summoned back in a hurry.
Some one was asking for me on the wire.
</p><p>"Some one!" I said, going upstairs again. "But it must be the same
person."
</p><p>And I at once took up the receiver:
</p><p>"Are you there? Is that M. Prévotelle?"
</p><p>At first I heard only my name, uttered in a very faint, indistinct
voice, a woman's voice:
</p><p>"Victorien. . . . Victorien. . . ."
</p><p>"Hullo!" I cried, very excitedly, though I did not yet understand.
"Hullo! . . . Yes, it's I, Victorien Beaugrand. I happened to be at
the telephone. . . . Hullo! . . . Who is it speaking?"
</p><p>For a few seconds the voice sounded nearer and then seemed to fall
away. After that came perfect silence. But I had caught these few
words:
</p><p>"Help, Victorien! . . . My father's life is in danger: help! . . .
Come to the Blue Lion at Bougival. . . ."
</p><p>I stood dumbfounded. I had recognised Bérangère's voice:
</p><p>"Bérangère," I muttered, "calling on me for help. . . ."
</p><p>Without even pausing to think, I rushed to the station.
</p><p>A train took me to Saint-Cloud and another two stations further.
Wading through the mud, under the pelting rain, and losing my way in
the dark, I covered the mile or two to Bougival on foot, arriving in
the middle of the night. The Blue Lion was closed. But a small boy
dozing under the porch asked me if I was M. Victorien Beaugrand. When
I answered that I was, he said that a lady, by the name of Bérangère,
had told him to wait for me and take me to her, at whatever time I
might arrive.
</p><p>I trudged beside the boy, through the empty streets of the little
town, to the banks of the Seine, which we followed for some distance.
The rain had stopped, but the darkness was still impenetrable.
</p><p>"The boat is here," said the boy.
</p><p>"Oh, are we crossing?"
</p><p>"Yes, the young lady is hiding on the other side. Be very careful not
to make a noise."
</p><p>We landed soon after. Then a stony path took us to a house where the
boy gave three knocks on the door.
</p><p>Some one opened the door. Still following my guide, I went up a few
steps, crossed a passage lighted by a candle and was shown into a dark
room with some one waiting in it. Instantly the light of an electric
lamp struck me full in the face.
</p><p>The barrel of a revolver was pointed at me and a man's voice said:
</p><p>"Silence, do you understand? The least sound, the least attempt at
escape; and you're done for. Otherwise you have nothing to fear; and
the best thing you can do is to go to sleep."
</p><p>The door was closed behind me. Two bolts were shot.
</p><p>I had fallen into the trap which the man Velmot--I did not hesitate to
fix upon him at once--had laid for me through the instrumentality of
Bérangère.
</p><hr/>
<p>This unaccountable adventure, like all those in which Bérangère was
involved, did not alarm me unduly at the moment. I was no doubt too
weary to seek reasons for the conduct of the girl and of the man under
whose instructions she was acting. Why had she betrayed me? How had I
incurred the man Velmot's ill-will? And what had induced him to
imprison me, if I had nothing to fear from him as he maintained? These
were all idle questions. After groping through the room and finding
that it contained a bed, or rather a mattress and blankets, I took off
my boots and outer clothing, wrapped myself in the blankets and in a
few minutes was fast asleep.
</p><p>I slept well into the following day. Meanwhile some one must have
entered the room, for I saw on a table a hunk of new bread and a
bottle of water. The cell which I occupied was a small one. Enough
light to enable me to see came through the slats of a wooden shutter,
which was firmly barricaded outside, as I discovered after opening the
narrow window. One of the slats was half broken. Through the gap I
perceived that my prison overlooked from a height of three or four
feet a strip of ground at the edge of which little waves lapped among
the reeds. Finding that, after crossing one river, I was facing
another, I concluded that Velmot had brought me to an island in the
Seine. Was this not the island which I had beheld, in a fleeting
vision, on the chapel in the cemetery? And was it not here that Velmot
and Massignac had established their head-quarters last winter?
</p><p>Part of the day passed in silence. But, about five o'clock, I heard a
sound of voices and outbursts of argument. This happened under my room
and consequently in a cellar the grating of which opened beneath my
window. On listening attentively, I seemed on several occasions to
recognize Massignac's voice.
</p><p>The discussion lasted fully an hour. Then some one made his appearance
outside my window and called out:
</p><p>"Hi, you chaps, come on and get ready! . . . . He's a stubborn beast
and won't speak unless we make him."
</p><p>It was the tall fellow who, the day before, had forced his way through
the crowd in the Yard by making an outcry about a wounded man. It was
Velmot, a leaner Velmot, without beard or glasses, Velmot, the
coxcomb, the object of Bérangère's affections.
</p><p>"<u>I'll</u> make him, the brute! Think of it. I've got him here, at my
mercy: is it likely that I shouldn't be able to make him spew up his
secret? No, no, we must finish it and by nightfall. You're still
decided?"
</p><p>He received two growls in reply. He sneered:
</p><p>"He's not half badly trussed up, eh? All right. I'll do without you.
Only just lend me a hand to begin with."
</p><p>He stepped into a boat fastened to a ring on the bank. One of the men
pushed it with a boat-hook between two stakes planted in the mud and
standing out well above the reeds. Velmot knotted one end of a thick
rope to the top of each stake and in the middle fastened an iron hook,
which thus hung four or five feet above the water.
</p><p>"That's it," he said, on returning. "I shan't want you any more. Take
the other boat and go and wait for me in the garage. I'll join you
there in three or four hours, when Massignac has blabbed his little
story and after I've had a little plain speaking with our new
prisoner. And then we'll be off."
</p><p>He walked away with his two assistants. When I saw him again, twenty
minutes later, he had a newspaper in his hand. He laid it on a little
table which stood just outside my window. Then he sat down and lit a
cigar. He turned his back to me, hiding the table from my view. But at
one moment he moved and I caught sight of his paper, the <u>Journal du
Soir</u>, which was folded across the page and which bore a heading in
capitals running right across the width of the sheet, with this
sensational title:
</p><pre>
      "THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MEUDON
          APPARITIONS REVEALED"</pre>
<p>I was shaken to the very depths of my being. So the young student had
not lied! Benjamin Prévotelle had discovered the truth and had
managed, in the space of a few hours, to set it forth in the report of
which he had spoken and to make it public.
</p><p>Glued to the shutter, how I strove to read the opening lines of the
article! These were the only lines that met my eyes, because of the
manner in which the paper was folded. And how great was my excitement
at each word that I made out!
</p><p>I have carefully preserved a copy of that paper, by which a part at
least of the great mystery was made known to me. Before reprinting the
famous report, which Benjamin Prévotelle had published that morning,
it said:
</p><pre>
      "Yes, the fantastic problem is solved. A contemporary
      published this morning, in the form of 'An Open Letter
      to the Academy of Science,' the most sober, luminous
      and convincing report conceivable. We do not know
      whether the official experts will agree with the
      conclusions of the report, but we doubt if the
      objections, which for that matter are frankly stated
      by the author, are strong enough, however grave they
      may be, to demolish the theory which he propounds. The
      arguments seem unanswerable. The proofs are such as to
      compel belief. And what doubles the value of this
      admirable theory is that it does not merely appear to
      be unassailable, but opens up to us the widest and
      most marvellous horizons. In fact, Noël Dorgeroux's
      discovery is no longer limited to what it is or what
      it seems to be. It implies consequences which cannot
      be foretold. It is calculated to upset all our ideas
      of man's past and all our conceptions of his future.
      Not since the beginning of the world has there been an
      event to compare with this. It is at the same time the
      most incomprehensible event and the most natural, the
      most complex and the simplest. A great scientist might
      have announced it to the world as the result of
      meditation. And he who, thanks both to able intuition
      and intelligent observation has achieved this
      inestimable glory is little more than a boy in years.
      "We subjoin a few particulars gleaned in the course of
      an interview which Benjamin Prévotelle was good enough
      to grant us. We apologize for being able to give no
      more details concerning his personality. How should it
      be otherwise: Benjamin Prévotelle is twenty-three
      years of age. He . . ."</pre>
<p>I had to stop here, as the subsequent lines escaped my eyes. Was I to
learn more?
</p><p>Velmot had risen from his chair and was walking to and fro. After a
brief disappearance, he returned with a bottle of some liqueur, of
which he drank two glasses in quick succession. Then he unfolded the
newspaper and began to peruse the report or rather to reperuse it, for
I had no doubt that he had read it before.
</p><p>His chair was right against my shutter. He sat leaning back, so that I
was able to see, not the end of the preliminary article, but the
report itself, which he read rather slowly.
</p><p>The daylight, proceeding from a sky whose clouds must have hidden the
sun, was meantime diminishing. I read simultaneously with Velmot:
</p><p>      "<u>An Open Letter to the Academy of Science</u>
</p><pre>
      "I will beg you, gentlemen, to regard this memorandum
      as only the briefest possible introduction to the more
      important essay which I propose to write and to the
      innumerable volumes to which it is certain to give
      rise in every country, to which volumes also it will
      serve as a modest preface.
      "I am writing hurriedly, allowing my pen to run away
      with me, improvising hastily as I go along. You will
      find omissions and defects which I do not attempt to
      conceal and which are due in equal proportions to the
      restricted number of observations which we were able
      to make at Meudon and to the obstinate refusal which
      M. Théodore Massignac opposes to every request for
      additional information. But the remarkable feeling
      aroused by the miraculous pictures makes it my duty to
      offer the results, as yet extremely incomplete, of an
      investigation in respect of which I have the
      legitimate ambition to reserve the right of priority.
      I thus hope, by confining my hypotheses to a definite
      channel, to assist towards establishing the truth and
      relieving the public mind.
      "My investigations were commenced immediately after
      the first revelations made by M. Victorien Beaugrand.
      I collated all his statements. I analysed all his
      impressions. I seized upon all that Noël Dorgeroux had
      said. I went over the details of all his experiments.
      And in consequence of carefully weighing and examining
      all these things I did not come to the first
      performance at Meudon with my hands in my pockets, as
      a lover of sensations and a dabbler in mystery. On the
      contrary, I came with a well-considered plan and with
      a few working-implements, deliberately selected and
      concealed under my own clothing and that of some of my
      friends who were good enough to assist me.
      "First of all, a camera. This was a matter of some
      difficulty. M. Théodore Massignac had his misgivings
      and had prohibited the introduction of so much as the
      smallest Kodak. Nevertheless I succeeded. I had to. I
      had to provide a definite answer to a first question,
      which might be called the critical question: are the
      Meudon apparitions due to individual or collective
      suggestions, possessing no reality outside those who
      experience them, or have they a real and external
      cause? That answer may certainly be deduced from the
      absolute identity of the impressions received by all
      the spectators. But to-day I am adducing a direct
      proof which I consider to be unassailable. The camera
      refuses any sort of suggestion. The camera is not a
      brain in which the picture can create itself, in which
      an hallucination is formed out of internal data. It is
      a witness that does not lie and is not mistaken. Well,
      this witness has spoken. The sensitive plate certifies
      the phenomena to be real. I hold at the disposal of
      the Academy seven negatives of the screen thus
      obtained by instantaneous exposures. Two of them,
      representing Rheims Cathedral on fire, are remarkably
      clear.
      "Here then the first point is settled: the screen is
      the seat of an emanation of light-rays.
      "While I was obtaining the proofs of this emanation, I
      submitted it to the means of investigation which
      physics places at our disposal. I was not,
      unfortunately, able to make as many or as accurate
      experiments as I should have wished. The distance of
      the wall, the local arrangements and the inadequacy of
      the light emitted by the screen were against me.
      Nevertheless, by using the spectroscope and the
      polarimeter, I ascertained that this light did not
      appear to differ perceptibly from the natural light
      diffused by a white surface.
      "But a more tangible result and one to which I attach
      the greatest importance was obtained by examining the
      screen by means of a revolving mirror. It is well
      known that, if our ordinary cinematographic pictures
      projected on a screen be viewed in a mirror to which
      we impart a rapid rotary movement, the successive
      pictures are dislocated and yield images in the field
      of the mirror. A similar effect can be obtained,
      though less distinctly, by turning one's head quickly
      so as to project the successive pictures upon
      different points of the retina. It was therefore
      indicated that I should apply this method of analysis
      to the animated projections produced at Meudon. I was
      thus able to prove positively that these projections,
      like those of the ordinary cinematograph, break up
      into separate and successive images, but with a
      rapidity which is notably greater than in the
      operations to which we are accustomed, for I found
      that they average 28 to the second. On the other hand,
      these images are not emitted at regular intervals. I
      observed rhythmical alterations of acceleration and
      retardation and I am inclined to believe that the
      rhythmical variations are not unconnected with the
      extraordinary impression of steroscopic relief which
      all the spectators at Meudon received.
      "The foregoing observations led up to a scientific
      certainty and naturally guided my investigations into
      a definite channel: the Meudon pictures are genuine
      cinematographic projections thrown upon the screen and
      perceived by the spectators in the ordinary manner.
      But where is the projecting-apparatus? How does it
      work? This is where the gravest difficulty lies, for
      hitherto no trace of an apparatus has been discovered,
      nor even the least clue to the existence of any
      apparatus whatever.
      "Is it allowable to suppose, as I did not fail to do,
      that the projections may proceed from within the
      screen, by means of an underground device which it is
      not impossible to imagine? This last theory would
      obviously greatly relieve our minds, by attributing
      the visions to some clever trick. But it was not
      without good reason that first M. Victorien Beaugrand
      and afterwards the audience itself refused to accept
      it. The visions bear a stamp of authenticity and
      unexpectedness which strikes all who see them, without
      any exception. Moreover, the specialists in
      cinematographic "faking," when questioned, frankly
      proclaim that their expert knowledge is at a loss and
      their technique at fault. It may even be declared that
      the exhibitor of these images possesses no power
      beyond that of receiving them on a suitable screen and
      that he himself does not know what is about to appear
      on the screen. Lastly, it may be added that the
      preparation of such films as that would be a long and
      complicated operation, necessitating an extensive
      equipment and a numerous staff of actors; and it is
      really impossible that these preparations can have
      been effected in absolute secrecy.
      "This is exactly the point to which my enquiries had
      led me on the night before the last, after the first
      performance. I will not presume to say that I knew
      more than any chance member of the public about that
      which constitutes the fundamental nature of the
      problem. Nevertheless, when I took my seat at the
      second performance, I was in a better condition
      mentally than any of the other onlookers. I was
      standing on solid ground. I was self controlled, free
      of feverish excitement or any other factor that might
      diminish the intensity of my attention. I was hampered
      by no preconceived ideas; and no new idea, no new fact
      could come within my grasp without my immediately
      perceiving it.
      "This was what happened. The new fact was the
      bewildering and mystifying spectacle of the grotesque
      Shapes. I did not at once draw the conclusion which
      this spectacle entailed, or at least I was not aware
      of so doing. But my perceptions were aroused. Those
      beings equipped with three arms became connected in my
      mind with the initial riddle of the Three Eyes. If I
      did not yet understand, at least I had a presentiment
      of the truth; if I did not know, at least I suspected
      that I was about to know. The door was opening. The
      light was beginning to dawn.
      "A few minutes later, as will be remembered, came the
      gruesome picture of a cart conveying two gendarmes, a
      priest and a king who was being led to his death. It
      was a confused, fragmentary, mutilated picture,
      continually broken up and pieced together again. Why?
      For, after all, the thing was not normal. Until then,
      as we know and as M. Victorien Beaugrand had told us,
      until then the pictures were always admirably
      distinct. And suddenly we beheld a flickering,
      defective image, confused, dim and at moments almost
      invisible. Why?
      "At that critical instant, this was the only train of
      thought permissible. The horror and strangeness of the
      spectacle no longer counted. Why was this, technically
      speaking, a defective picture? Why was the faultless
      mechanism, which until now had worked with perfect
      smoothness, suddenly disordered? What was the grain of
      sand that had thrown it out of gear?
      "Really the problem was proposed to me with a
      simplicity that confounded me. The terms of the
      problem were familiar to all. We had before us
      cinematographic pictures. These cinematographic
      pictures did not proceed from the wall itself. They
      did not come from any part of the amphitheatre. Then
      whence were they projected? And what obstacle was now
      preventing their free projection?
      "Instinctively, I made the only movement that could be
      made, the movement which a child would have made if
      that elementary question had been put to it: I raised
      my eyes to the sky.
      "It was absolutely clear, an immense, empty sky.
      "Clear and empty, yes, but in the part which my eyes
      were able to interrogate. Was it the same in the part
      hidden from my view by the upper wall of the
      amphitheatre?
      "The mere silent utterance of the words which
      propounded the question was enough to make me almost
      swoon with anxiety. They bore the tremendous truth
      within themselves. I had only to speak them for the
      great mystery to vanish utterly.
