<p>At midnight there was no mistaking the palpable uneasiness with
which Mr. Percy, faithful sentry, regarded the behaviour of Miss
Elliott and myself as we sat conversing upon the veranda of the
pavilion. It was not fear for the security of his prisoner which
troubled him, but the unseemliness of the young woman's persistence
in remaining to this hour under an espionage no more matronly
than that of a sketch-book abandoned on the table when we had
come out to the open. The youth had veiled his splendours with
more splendour: a long overcoat of so glorious a plaid it paled
the planets above us; and he wandered restlessly about the garden
in this refulgence, glancing at us now and then with what, in
spite of the insufficient revelation of the starlight, we both
recognised as a chilling disapproval. The lights of the inn were
all out; the courtyard was dark. The Spanish woman and Monsieur
Rameau had made their appearance for a moment, half an hour earlier,
to exchange a word with their fellow vigilant, and, soon after,
the extinguishing of the lamps in their respective apartments
denoted their retirement for the night. In the "Grande Suite"
all had been dark and silent for an hour. About the whole place
the only sign of life, aside from those signs furnished by our
three selves, was a rhythmical sound from an open window near
the kitchen, where incontrovertibly slumbered our maitre d'hotel
after the cares of the day.</p>

<p>Upon the occasion of our forest meeting Mr. Percy had signified
his desire to hear some talk of Art. I think he had his fill to-night&mdash;and
more; for that was the subject chosen by my dashing companion,
and vivaciously exploited until our awaited hour was at hand.
Heaven knows what nonsense I prattled, I do not; I do not think
I knew at the time. I talked mechanically, trying hard not to
betray my increasing excitement.</p>

<p>Under cover of this traduction of the Muse I served, I kept going
over and over the details of Louise Harman's plan, as the girl
beside me had outlined it, bending above the smudgy sketch-book.
"To make them think the flight is for Paris," she had urged, "to
Paris by way of Lisieux. To make that man yonder believe that
it is toward Lisieux, while they turn at the crossroads, and drive
across the country to Trouville for the morning boat to Havre."</p>

<p>It was simple; that was its great virtue. If they were well started,
they were safe; and well started meant only that Larrabee Harman
should leave the inn without an alarm, for an alarm sounded too
soon meant "racing and chasing on Canoby Lea," before they could
get out of the immediate neighbourhood. But with two hours' start,
and the pursuit spending most of its energy in the wrong direction&mdash;that
is, toward Lisieux and Paris&mdash;they would be on the deck of the
French-Canadian liner to-morrow noon, sailing out of the harbour
of Le Havre, with nothing but the Atlantic Ocean between them
and the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>I thought of the woman who dared this flight for her lover, of
the woman who came full-armed between him and the world, a Valkyr
winging down to bear him away to a heaven she would make for him
herself. Gentle as she was, there must have been a Valkyr in her
somewhere, or she could not attempt this. She swept in, not only
between him and the world, but between him and the destroying
demons his own sins had raised to beset him. There, I thought,
was a whole love; or there she was not only wife but mother to
him.</p>

<p>And I remembered the dream of her I had before I ever saw her,
on that first night after I came down to Normandy, when Amedee's
talk of "Madame d'Armand" had brought her into my thoughts. I
remembered that I had dreamed of finding her statue, but it was
veiled and I could not uncover it. And to-night it seemed to me
that the veil had lifted, and the statue was a figure of Mercy
in the beautiful likeness of Louise Harman. Then Keredec was wrong,
optimist as he was, since a will such as hers could save him she
loved, even from his own acts.</p>

<p>"And when you come to Monticelli's first style&mdash;" Miss Elliott's
voice rose a little, and I caught the sound of a new thrill vibrating
in it&mdash;"you find a hundred others of his epoch doing it quite
as well, not a <em>BIT </em>of a bit less commonplace&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly, and looking up, as I had fifty times
in the last twenty minutes, I saw that a light shone from Keredec's
window.</p>

<p>"I dare say they <em>ARE </em>commonplace," I remarked, rising.
"But now, if you will permit me, I'll offer you my escort back
to Quesnay."</p>

<p>I went into my room, put on my cap, lit a lantern, and returned
with it to the veranda. "If you are ready?" I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite," she answered, and we crossed the garden as far as
the steps.</p>

<p>Mr. Percy signified his approval.</p>

<p>"Gunna see the little lady home, are you?" he said graciously.
"I was <em>THINKIN' </em>it was about time, m'self!"</p>

<p>The salon door of the "Grand Suite" opened, above me, and at
the sound, the youth started, springing back to see what it portended,
but I ran quickly up the steps. Keredec stood in the doorway,
bare-headed and in his shirt-sleeves; in one hand he held a travelling-bag,
which he immediately gave me, setting his other for a second upon
my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my good, good friend," he said with an emotion in
his big voice which made me glad of what I was doing. He went
back into the room, closing the door, and I descended the steps
as rapidly as I had run up them. Without pausing, I started for
the rear of the courtyard, Miss Elliott accompanying me.</p>

<p>The sentry had watched these proceedings open-mouthed, more mystified
than alarmed. "Luk here," he said, "I want t' know whut this means."</p>

<p>"Anything you choose to think it means," I laughed, beginning
to walk a little more rapidly. He glanced up at the windows of
the "Grande Suite," which were again dark, and began to follow
us slowly. "What you gut in that grip?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You don't think we're carrying off Mr. Harman?"</p>

<p>"I reckon HE'S in his room all right," said the youth grimly;
"unless he's <em>FLEW </em>out. But I want t' know what you think
y're doin'?"</p>

<p>"Just now," I replied, "I'm opening this door."</p>

<p>This was a fact he could not question. We emerged at the foot
of a lane behind the inn; it was long and narrow, bordered by
stone walls, and at the other end debouched upon a road which
passed the rear of the Baudry cottage.</p>

<p>Miss Elliott took my arm, and we entered the lane.</p>

<p>Mr. Percy paused undecidedly. "I want t' know whut you think
y're doin'?" he repeated angrily, calling after us.</p>

<p>"It's very simple," I called in turn. "Can't I do an errand for
a friend? Can't I even carry his travelling-bag for him, without
going into explanations to everybody I happen to meet? And," I
added, permitting some anxiety to be marked in my voice, "I think
you may as well go back. We're not going far enough to need a
guard."</p>

<p>Mr. Percy allowed an oath to escape him, and we heard him muttering
to himself. Then his foot-steps sounded behind us.</p>

<p>"He's coming!" Miss Elliott whispered, with nervous exultation,
looking over her shoulder. "He's going to follow."</p>

<p>"He was sure to," said I.</p>

<p>We trudged briskly on, followed at some fifty paces by the perturbed
watchman. Presently I heard my companion utter a sigh so profound
that it was a whispered moan.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I murmured.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's the thought of Quesnay and to-morrow; facing them with
<em>THIS!" </em>she quavered. "Louise has written a letter for
me to give them, but I'll have to tell them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not alone," I whispered. "I'll be there when you come down from
your room in the morning."</p>

<p>We were embarked upon a singular adventure, not unattended by
a certain danger; we were tingling with a hundred apprehensions,
occupied with the vital necessity of drawing the little spy after
us&mdash;and that was a strange moment for a man (and an elderly painter-man
of no mark, at that!) to hear himself called what I was called
then, in a tremulous whisper close to my ear. Of course she has
denied it since; nevertheless, she said it&mdash;twice, for I pretended
not to hear her the first time. I made no answer, for something
in the word she called me, and in her seeming to mean it, made
me choke up so that I could not even whisper; but I made up my
mind that, after <em>THAT </em>if this girl saw Mr. Earl Percy
on his way back to the inn before she wished him to go, it would
be because he had killed me.</p>

<p>We were near the end of the lane when the neigh of a horse sounded
sonorously from the road beyond.</p>

<p>Mr. Percy came running up swiftly and darted by us.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" he called loudly. "Who's that in the cart yonder?"</p>

<p>I set my lantern on the ground close to the wall, and at the
same moment a horse and cart drew up on the road at the end of
the lane, showing against the starlight. It was Pere Baudry's
best horse, a stout gray, that would easily enough make Trouville
by daylight. A woman's figure and a man's (the latter that of
Pere Baudry himself) could be made out dimly on the seat of the
cart.</p>

<p>"Who is it, I say?" shouted our excited friend. "What kind of
a game d'ye think y're puttin' up on me here?"</p>

<p>He set his hand on the side of the cart and sprang upon the hub
of the wheel. A glance at the occupants satisfied him.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Harman!" he yelled. "Mrs. Harman!" He leaped down into
the road. "I knowed I was a fool to come away without wakin' up
Rameau. But you haven't beat us yet!"</p>

<p>He drove back into the lane, but just inside its entrance I met
him.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Back to the pigeon-house in a hurry. There's devilment here,
and I want Rameau. Git out o' my way!"</p>

<p>"You're not going back," said I.</p>

<p>"The hell I ain't!" said Mr. Percy. "I give ye two seconds t'
git out o' my &mdash;<em>TAKE YER HANDS OFFA ME</em>!"</p>

<p>I made sure of my grip, not upon the refulgent overcoat, for
I feared he might slip out of that, but upon the collars of his
coat and waistcoat, which I clenched together in my right hand.
I knew that he was quick, and I suspected that he was "scientific,"
but I did it before he had finished talking, and so made fast,
with my mind and heart and soul set upon sticking to him.</p>

<p>My suspicions as to his "science" were perfervidly justified.
"You long-legged devil!" he yelled, and I instantly received a
series of concussions upon the face and head which put me in supreme
doubt of my surroundings, for I seemed to have plunged, eyes foremost,
into the Milky Way. But I had my left arm around his neck, which
probably saved me from a coup de grace, as he was forced to pommel
me at half-length. Pommel it was; to use so gentle a word for
what to me was crash, bang, smash, battle, murder, earthquake
and tornado. I was conscious of some one screaming, and it seemed
a consoling part of my delirium that the cheek of Miss Anne Elliott
should be jammed tight against mine through one phase of the explosion.
My arms were wrenched, my fingers twisted and tortured, and, when
it was all too clear to me that I could not possibly bear one
added iota of physical pain, the ingenious fiend began to kick
my shins and knees with feet like crowbars.</p>

<p>Conflict of any sort was never my vocation. I had not been an
accessory-during-the-fact to a fight since I passed the truculent
age of fourteen; and it is a marvel that I was able to hang to
that dynamic bundle of trained muscles&mdash;which defines Mr. Earl
Percy well enough&mdash;for more than ten seconds. Yet I did hang to
him, as Pere Baudry testifies, for a minute and a half, which
seems no inconsiderable lapse of time to a person undergoing such
experiences as were then afflicting me.</p>

<p>It appeared to me that we were revolving in enormous circles
in the ether, and I had long since given my last gasp, when there
came a great roaring wind in my ears and a range of mountains
toppled upon us both; we went to earth beneath it.</p>

<p>"Ha! you must create violence, then?" roared the avalanche.</p>

<p>And the voice was the voice of Keredec.</p>

<p>Some one pulled me from underneath my struggling antagonist,
and, the power of sight in a hazy, zigzagging fashion coming back
to me, I perceived the figure of Miss Anne Elliott recumbent beside
me, her arms about Mr. Percy's prostrate body. The extraordinary
girl had fastened upon him, too, though I had not known it, and
she had gone to ground with us; but it is to be said for Mr. Earl
Percy that no blow of his touched her, and she was not hurt. Even
in the final extremities of temper, he had carefully discriminated
in my favour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harman was bending over her, and, as the girl sprang up
lightly, threw her arms about her. For my part, I rose more slowly,
section by section, wondering why I did not fall apart; lips,
nose, and cheeks bleeding, and I had a fear that I should need
to be led like a blind man, through my eyelids swelling shut.
That was something I earnestly desired should not happen; but
whether it did, or did not&mdash;or if the heavens fell! &mdash;I meant
to walk back to Quesnay with Anne Elliott that night, and, mangled,
broken, or half-dead, presenting whatever appearance of the prize-ring
or the abattoir that I might, I intended to take the same train
for Paris on the morrow that she did.</p>

<p>For our days together were not at an end; nor was it hers nor
my desire that they should be.</p>
