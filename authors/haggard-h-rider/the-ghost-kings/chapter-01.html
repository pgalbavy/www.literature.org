<p>The afternoon was intensely, terribly hot. Looked at from the high ground
where they were encamped above the river, the sea, a mile or two to her
right--for this was the coast of Pondo-land--to little Rachel Dove staring
at it with sad eyes, seemed an illimitable sheet of stagnant oil. Yet
there was no sun, for a grey haze hung like a veil beneath the arch of the
sky, so dense and thick that its rays were cut off from the earth which
lay below silent and stifled. Tom, the Kaffir driver, had told her that a
storm was coming, a father of storms, which would end the great drought.
Therefore he had gone to a kloof in the mountains where the oxen were in
charge of the other two native boys--since on this upland there was no
pasturage to drive them back to the waggon. For, as he explained to her,
in such tempests cattle are apt to take fright and rush away for miles,
and without cattle their plight would be even worse than it was at
present.
</p><p>At least this was what Tom said, but Rachel, who had been brought up among
natives and understood their mind, knew that his real reason was that he
wished to be out of the way when the baby was buried. Kaffirs do not like
death, unless it comes by the assegai in war, and Tom, a good creature,
had been fond of that baby during its short little life. Well, it was
buried now; he had finished digging its resting-place in the hard soil
before he went. Rachel, poor child, for she was but fifteen, had borne it
to its last bed, and her father had unpacked his surplice from a box, put
it on and read the Burial Service over the grave. Afterwards together they
had filled in that dry, red earth, and rolled stones on to it, and as
there were few flowers at this season of the year, placed a shrivelled
branch or two of mimosa upon the stones--the best offering they had to
make.
</p><p>Rachel and her father were the sole mourners at this funeral, if we may
omit two rock rabbits that sat upon a shelf of stone in a neighbouring
cliff, and an old baboon which peered at these strange proceedings from
its crest, and finally pushed down a boulder before it departed, barking
indignantly. Her mother could not come because she was ill with grief and
fever in a little tent by the waggon. When it was all over they returned
to her, and there had been a painful scene.
</p><p>Mrs. Dove was lying on a bed made of the cartel, or frame strung with
strips of green hide, which had been removed from the waggon, a pretty,
pale-faced woman with a profusion of fair hair. Rachel always remembered
that scene. The hot tent with its flaps turned up to let in whatever air
there might be. Her mother in a blue dressing-gown, dingy with wear and
travel, from which one of the ribbon bows hung by a thread, her face
turned to the canvas and weeping silently. The gaunt form of her father
with his fanatical, saint-like face, pale beneath its tan, his high
forehead over which fell one grizzled lock, his thin, set lips and
far-away grey eyes, taking off his surplice and folding it up with quick
movements of his nervous hands, and herself, a scared, wondering child,
watching them both and longing to slip away to indulge her grief in
solitude. It seemed an age before that surplice was folded, pushed into a
linen bag which in their old home used to hold dirty clothes, and finally
stowed away in a deal box with a broken hinge. At length it was done, and
her father straightened himself with a sigh, and said in a voice that
tried to be cheerful:
</p><p>“Do not weep, Janey. Remember this is all for the best. The Lord hath
taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord.”
</p><p>Her mother sat up looking at him reproachfully with her blue eyes, and
answered in her soft Scotch accent:
</p><p>“You said that to me before, John, when the other one went, down at
Grahamstown, and I am tired of hearing it. Don’t ask me to bless the Lord
when He takes my babes, no, nor any mother, He Who could spare them if He
chose. Why should the Lord give me fever so that I could not nurse it, and
make a snake bite the cow so that it died? If the Lord’s ways are such,
then those of the savages are more merciful.”
</p><p>“Janey, Janey, do not blaspheme,” her father had exclaimed. “You should
rejoice that the child is in Heaven.”
</p><p>“Then do you rejoice and leave me to grieve. From to-day I only make one
prayer, that I may never have another. John,” she added with a sudden
outburst, “it is your fault. You know well I told you how it would be. I
told you that if you would come this mad journey the babe would die, aye,
and I tell you”--here her voice sank to a kind of wailing whisper--“before
the tale is ended others will die too, all of us, except Rachel there, who
was born to live her life. Well, for my part, the sooner the better, for I
wish to go to sleep with my children.”
</p><p>“This is evil,” broke in her husband, “evil and rebellious--”
</p><p>“Then evil and rebellious let it be, John. But why am I evil if I have the
second sight like my mother before me? Oh! she warned me what must come if
I married you, and I would not listen; now I warn you, and you will not
listen. Well, so be it, we must dree our own weird, everyone of us, a
short one; all save Rachel, who was born to live her life. Man, I tell
you, that the Spirit drives you on to convert the heathen just for one
thing, that the heathen may make a martyr of you.”
</p><p>“So let them,” her father answered proudly. “I seek no better end.”
</p><p>“Aye,” she moaned, sinking back upon the cartel, “so let them, but my
babe, my poor babe! Why should my babe die because too much religion has
made you mad to win a martyr’s crown? Martyrs should not marry and have
children, John.”
</p><p>Then, unable to bear any more of it, Rachel had fled from the tent, and
sat herself down at a distance to watch the oily sea.
</p><p>It has been said that Rachel was only fifteen, but in Southern Africa
girls grow quickly to womanhood; also her experiences had been of a nature
to ripen her intelligence. Thus she was quite able to form a judgment of
her parents, their virtues and their weaknesses. Rachel was English born,
but had no recollection of England since she came to South Africa when she
was four years old. It was shortly after her birth that this
missionary-fury seized upon her father as a result of some meetings which
he had attended in London. He was then a clergyman with a good living in a
quiet Hertfordshire parish, and possessed of some private means, but
nothing would suit him short of abandoning all his prospects and sailing
for South Africa, in obedience to his “call.” Rachel knew all this because
her mother had often told her, adding that she and her people, who were of
a good Scotch family, had struggled against this South African scheme even
to the verge of open quarrel.
</p><p>At length, indeed, it came to a choice between submission and separation.
Mr. Dove had declared that not even for her sake would he be guilty of
“sin against the Spirit” which had chosen him to bring light to those who
sat in darkness--that is, the Kaffirs, and especially to that section of
them who were in bondage to the Boers. For at this time an agitation was
in progress in England which led ultimately to the freeing of the slaves
of the Cape Dutch, and afterwards to the exodus of the latter into the
wilderness and most of those wars with which our generation is familiar.
So, as she was devoted to her husband, who, apart from his religious
enthusiasm, or rather possession, was in truth a very lovable man, she
gave way and came. Before they sailed, however, the general gloom was
darkened by Mrs. Dove announcing that something in her heart told her that
neither of them would ever see home again, as they were doomed to die at
the hands of savages.
</p><p>Now whatever the reason or explanation, scientifically impossible as the
fact might be, it remained a fact that Janey Dove, like her mother and
several of her Scottish ancestors, was foresighted, or at least so her
kith and kin believed. Therefore, when she communicated to them her
conviction as though it were a piece of everyday intelligence, they never
doubted its accuracy for a minute, but only redoubled their efforts to
prevent her from going to Africa. Even her husband did not doubt it, but
remarked irritably that it seemed a pity she could not sometimes be
foresighted as to agreeable future events, since for his part he was quite
willing to wait for disagreeable ones until they happened. Not that he
quailed personally from the prospect of martyrdom; this he could
contemplate with complacency and even enthusiasm, but, zealot though he
was, he did shrink from the thought that his beautiful and delicate wife
might be called upon to share the glory of that crown. Indeed, as his own
purpose was unalterable, he now himself suggested that he should go forth
to seek it alone.
</p><p>Then it was that his wife showed an unsuspected strength of character. She
said that she had married him for better or for worse against the wishes
of her family; that she loved and respected him, and that she would rather
be murdered by Kaffirs in due season than endure a separation which might
be lifelong. So in the end the pair of them with their little daughter
Rachel departed in a sailing ship, and their friends and relations knew
them no more.
</p><p>Their subsequent history up to the date of the opening of this story may
be told in very few words. As a missionary the Reverend John Dove was not
a success. The Boers in the eastern part of the Cape Colony where he
laboured, did not appreciate his efforts to Christianise their slaves. The
slaves did not appreciate them either, inasmuch as, saint though he might
be, he quite lacked the sympathetic insight which would enable him to
understand that a native with thousands of generations of savagery behind
him is a different being from a highly educated Christian, and one who
should be judged by another law. Their sins, amongst which he included all
their most cherished inherited customs, appalled him, as he continually
proclaimed from the housetops. Moreover, when occasionally he did snatch a
brand from the burning, and the said brand subsequently proved that it was
still alight, or worse still, replaced its original failings by those of
the white man, such as drink, theft and lying, whereof before it had been
innocent, he would openly condemn it to eternal punishment. Further, he
was too insubordinate, or, as he called it, too honest, to submit to the
authority of his local superiors in the Church, and therefore would only
work for his own hand. Finally he caused his “cup to overflow,” as he
described it, or, in plain English, made the country too hot to hold him,
by becoming involved in a bitter quarrel with the Boers. Of these, on the
whole, worthy folk, he formed the worst; and in the main a very unjust
opinion, which he sent to England to be reprinted in Church papers, or to
the Home Government to be published in Blue-books. In due course these
documents reached South Africa again, where they were translated into
Dutch and became incidentally one of the causes of the Great Trek.
</p><p>The Boers were furious and threatened to shoot him as a slanderer. The
English authorities were also furious, and requested him to cease from
controversy or to leave the country. At last, stubborn as he might be,
circumstances proved too much for him, and as his conscience would not
allow him to be silent, Mr. Dove chose the latter alternative. The only
question was whither he should go. As he was well off, having inherited a
moderate fortune in addition to what he had before he left England, his
poor wife pleaded with him to return home, pointing out that there he
would be able to lay his case before the British public. This course had
attractions for him, but after a night’s reflection and prayer, he
rejected it as a specious temptation sent by Satan.
</p><p>What, he argued, should he return to live in luxury in England not only
unmartyred but a palpable failure, his mission quite unfulfilled? His wife
might go if she liked, and take their surviving children, Rachel and the
new-born baby boy, with her (they had buried two other little girls), but
he would stick to his post and his duty. He had seen some Englishmen who
had visited the country called Natal where white people were beginning to
settle. In that land it seemed there were no slave-driving Boers, and the
natives, according to all accounts, much needed the guidance of the
Gospel, especially a certain king of the people called Zulus, who was
named Chaka or Dingaan, he was not sure which. This ferocious person he
particularly desired to encounter, having little doubt that in the absence
of the contaminating Boer, he would be able to induce him to see the error
of his ways and change the national customs, especially those of fighting
and, worse still, of polygamy.
</p><p>His unhappy wife listened and wept, for now the martyr’s crown which she
had always foreseen, seemed uncomfortably near, indeed as it were, it
glowed blood red within reach of her hand. Moreover, in her heart she did
not believe that Kaffirs could be converted, at any rate at present. They
were fighting men, as her Highland forefathers had been, and her Scottish
blood could understand the weakness, while, as for this polygamy, she had
long ago secretly concluded that the practice was one which suited them
very well, as it had suited David and Solomon, and even Abraham. But for
all this, although she was sure in her uncanny fashion that her baby’s
death would come of her staying, she refused to leave her husband as she
had refused eleven years before.
</p><p>Doubtless affection was at the bottom of it, for Janey Dove was a very
faithful woman; also there were other things--her fatalism, and stronger
still, her weariness. She believed that they were doomed. Well, let the
doom fall; she had no fear of the Beyond. At the best it might be happy,
and at the worst deep, everlasting rest and peace, and she felt as though
she needed thousands of years of rest and peace. Moreover, she was sure no
harm would come to Rachel, the very apple of her eye; that she was marked
to live and to find happiness even in this wild land. So it came about
that she refused her husband’s offer to allow her to return home where she
had no longer any ties, and for perhaps the twentieth time prepared
herself to journey she knew not whither.
</p><p>Rachel, seated there in the sunless, sweltering heat, reflected on these
things. Of course she did not know all the story, but most of it had come
under her observation in one way or other, and being shrewd by nature, she
could guess the rest, for she who was companionless had much time for
reflection and for guessing. She sympathised with her father in his ideas,
understanding vaguely that there was something large and noble about them,
but in the main, body and mind, she was her mother’s child. Already she
showed her mother’s dreamy beauty, to which were added her father’s
straight features and clear grey eyes, together with a promise of his
height. But of his character she had little, that is outside of a courage
and fixity of purpose which marked them both.
</p><p> For the rest she was far, or fore-seeing, like her mother, apprehending
the end of things by some strange instinct; also very faithful in
character.
</p><p>Rachel was unhappy. She did not mind the hardship and the heat, for she
was accustomed to both, and her health was so perfect that it would have
needed much worse things to affect her. But she loved the baby that was
gone, and wondered whether she would ever see it again. On the whole she
thought so, for here that intuition of hers came in, but at the best she
was sure that there would be long to wait. She loved her mother also, and
grieved more for her than for herself, especially now when she was so ill.
Moreover, she knew and shared her mind. This journey, she felt, was
foolishness; her father was a man “led by a star” as the natives say, and
would follow it over the edge of the world and be no nearer. He was not
fit to have charge of her mother.
</p><p>Of herself she did not think so much. Still, at Grahamstown, for a year or
so there had been other children for companions, Dutch most of them, it is
true, and all rough in mind and manner. Yet they were white and human.
While she played with them she could forget she knew so much more than
they did; that, for instance, she could read the Gospels in Greek--which
her father had taught her ever since she was a little child--while they
could scarcely spell them out in the Taal, or Boer dialect, and that they
had never heard even of William the Conqueror. She did not care
particularly about Greek and William the Conqueror, but she did care for
friends, and now they were all gone from her, gone like the baby, as far
off as William the Conqueror. And she, she was alone in the wilderness
with a father who talked and thought of Heaven all day long, and a mother
who lived in memories and walked in the shadow of doom, and oh! she was
unhappy.
</p><p>Her grey eyes filled with tears so that she could no longer see that
everlasting ocean, which she did not regret as it wearied her. She wiped
them with the back of her hand that was burnt quite brown by the sun, and
turning impatiently, fell to watching two of those strange insects known
as the Praying Mantis, or often in South Africa as Hottentot gods, which
after a series of genuflections, were now fighting desperately among the
dead stalks of grass at her feet. Men could not be more savage, she
reflected, for really their ferocity was hideous. Then a great tear fell
upon the head of one of them, and astonished by this phenomenon, or
thinking perhaps that it had begun to rain, it ran away and hid itself,
while its adversary sat up and looked about it triumphantly, taking to
itself all the credit of conquest.
</p><p> She heard a step behind her, and having again furtively wiped her eyes
with her hand, the only handkerchief available, looked round to see her
father stalking towards her.
</p><p>“Why are you crying, Rachel?” he asked in an irritable voice. “It is wrong
to cry because your little brother has been taken to glory.”
</p><p>“Jesus cried over Lazarus, and He wasn’t even His brother,” she answered
in a reflective voice, then by way of defending herself added
inconsequently: “I was watching two Hottentot gods fight.”
</p><p>As Mr. Dove could think of no reply to her very final Scriptural example,
he attacked her on the latter point.
</p><p>“A cruel amusement,” he said, “especially as I have heard that boys, yes,
and men, too, pit these poor insects against each other, and make bets
upon them.”
</p><p>“Nature, is cruel, not I father. Nature is always cruel,” and she glanced
towards the little grave under the rock. Then, while for the second time
her father hesitated, not knowing what to answer, she added quickly, “Is
mother better now?”
</p><p>“No,” he said, “worse, I think, very hysterical and quite unable to see
things in the true light.”
</p><p>She rose and faced him, for she was a courageous child, then asked:
</p><p>“Father, why don’t you take her back? She isn’t fit to go on. It is wrong
to drag her into this wilderness.”
</p><p>At this question he grew very angry, and began to scold and to talk of the
wickedness of abandoning his “call.”
</p><p>“But mother has not got a ‘call,’” she broke in.
</p><p>Then, as for the third time he could find no answer, he declared
vehemently that they were both in league against him, instruments used by
the Evil One to tempt him from his duty by working on his natural fears
and affections, and so forth.
</p><p>The child watched him with her clear grey eyes, saying nothing further,
till at last he grew calm and paused.
</p><p>“We are all much upset,” he went on, rubbing his high forehead with his
thin hand. “I suppose it is the heat and this--this--trial of our faith.
What did I come to speak to you about? Oh! I remember; your mother will
eat nothing, and keeps asking for fruit. Do you know where there is any
fruit?”
</p><p>“It doesn’t grow here, father.” Then her face brightened, and she added:
“Yes, it does, though. The day that we outspanned in this camp mother and
I went down to the river and walked to that kind of island beyond the dry
donga to get some flowers that grow on the wet ground. I saw lots of Cape
gooseberries there, all quite ripe.”
</p><p>“Then go and get some, dear. You will have plenty of time before dark.”
</p><p>She started up as though to obey, then checked herself and said:
</p><p>“Mother told me that I was not to go to the river alone, because we saw
the spoor of lions and crocodiles in the mud.”
</p><p>“God will guard you from the lions and the crocodiles, if there are any,”
 he answered doggedly, for was not this an opportunity to show his faith?
“You are not afraid, are you?”
</p><p>“No, father. I am afraid of nothing, perhaps because I don’t care what
happens. I will get the basket and go at once.”
</p><p>In another minute she was walking quickly towards the river, a lonely
little figure in that great place. Mr. Dove watched her uneasily till she
was hidden in the haze, for his reason told him that this was a foolish
journey.
</p><p>“The Lord will send His angels to protect her,” he muttered to himself.
“Oh! if only I could have more faith, all these troubles come upon me from
a lack of faith, and through that I am continually tempted. I think I will
run after her and go, too. No, there is Janey calling me, I cannot leave
her alone. The Lord will protect her, but I need not mention to Janey that
she has gone, unless she asks me outright. She will be quite safe, the
storm will not break to-night.”
