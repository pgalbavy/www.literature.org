<p>It was the parson who now broke in.</p>

<p>"Why do we sit here, lamenting that which cannot be helped? Do
you mean to give up, captain, and let her go? Will you settle
down to toil in the diggings, giving her no further thought, while
this pretty-faced lieutenant is chuckling over the clever manner
by which he fooled you as well as us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" fairly shouted the roused parent; "I will follow them to
the ends of the earth! They shall not find a foot of ground that
will protect them! She has never seen me angry, but she shall
now!"</p>

<p>"We are with you," coolly responded Brush, "but only on one condition."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"That this account is to be settled with <em>him</em> alone;
you musn't speak so much as a cross word to Nellie; she will shed
many a bitter tear of sorrow; she will drain the cup to its dregs;
<em>he</em>, the cause of it all, is to be brought to judgment.
When do you wish to take up the pursuit?"</p>

<p>"Now!"</p>

<p>"And we are with you."</p>

<p>There was something wonderful in the way Parson Brush kept control
of himself. Externally he was as calm as when standing in front
of the adamantine blackboard, giving instruction to Nellie Dawson,
while down deep in his heart, raged a tempest such as rouses into
life the darkest passions that can nerve a man to wrong doing.
Believing it necessary to stir the father to action, he had done
it by well chosen words, that could not have been more effective.</p>

<p>For weeks and months the shadow had brooded over him. Sometimes
it seemed to lift and dissolve into unsubstantiality, only to
come back more baleful than before. And the moment when he had
about persuaded himself that it was but a figment of the imagination,
it had sprung into being and crushed him. But he was now stern,
remorseless, resolute, implacable.</p>

<p>It was much the same with Wade Ruggles. He strove desperately
to gain the remarkable control of his feelings, displayed by his
comrade, and partly succeeded. But there was a restless fidgeting
which caused him to move aimlessly about the room and showed itself
now and then in a slight tremulousness of the voice and hands,
but his eyes wore that steely glitter, which those at his side
had noticed when the rumble and grumble told that the battle was
on.</p>

<p>Captain Dawson went from one extreme to the other. Crazed, tumultuous
in his fury, and at first like a baffled tiger, he moderated his
voice and manner until his companions wondered at his self-poise.</p>

<p>"They have started for Sacramento and are now well advanced over
the trail," he remarked without any evidence of excitement.</p>

<p>"When do you imagine they set out?" asked Brush.</p>

<p>"Probably about the middle of the afternoon; possibly earlier."</p>

<p>"Then," said Ruggles, "they have a good six hours' start. They
haven't lost any time and must be fifteen or twenty miles away."</p>

<p>"The trail is easy traveling for twice that distance, as I recollect
it," observed the captain; "after that it grows rougher and they
will not be able to go so fast."</p>

<p>"This must have been arranged several days ago, though it is
only guesswork on our part. Of course she has taken considerable
clothing with her."</p>

<p>"I did not look into her room," said the captain; "there's no
use; it is enough to know they made their preparations and started,
accompanied by that dog Timon."</p>

<p>No time was wasted. They knew they would encounter cold weather,
for the autumn had fairly set in, and some portions of the trail
carried them to an elevation where it was chilly in midsummer.
Each took a thick blanket. The captain donned his military coat,
with the empty sleeve pinned to the breast, caught up his saddle
and trappings, his Winchester and revolver, and buckled the cartridge
belt around his waist. Then he was ready. Neither of the others
took coat or vest. The blanket flung around the shoulders was
all that was likely to be needed, in addition to the heavy flannel
shirt worn summer and winter.</p>

<p>Thus equipped, the three stood outside the cabin, with the moon
high in the sky, a gentle wind sweeping up the ca単on and loose
masses of clouds drifting in front of the orb of night. Here and
there a light twinkled from a shanty and the hum of voices sounded
faintly in their ears. Further off, at the extreme end of the
settlement, stood the Heavenly Bower, with the yellow rays streaming
from its two windows. They could picture the group gathered there,
as it had gathered night after night during the past years, full
of jest and story, and with never a thought of the tragedy that
had already begun.</p>

<p>"Shall we tell them?" asked Ruggles.</p>

<p>"No," answered Brush; "some of them might wish to go with us."</p>

<p>"And it might be well to take them," suggested Captain Dawson.</p>

<p>"We are enough," was the grim response of the parson.</p>

<p>Like so many phantoms, the men moved toward the further end of
the settlement. Opposite the last shanty a man assumed form in
the gloom. He had just emerged from his dwelling and stopped abruptly
at sight of the trio of shadows gliding past.</p>

<p>"What's up, pards?" he called.</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the curt answer of the captain, who was leading
and did not change his pace.</p>

<p>"You needn't be so huffy about it," growled the other, standing
still and puffing his pipe until they vanished.</p>

<p>"That was Vose Adams," remarked the captain over his shoulder;
"he'll tell the rest what he saw and it will be known to everybody
in the morning."</p>

<p>The little party was carefully descending the side of the ca単on,
with now and then a partial stumble, until they reached the bottom
of the broad valley where the grass grew luxuriantly nearly the
whole year. It was nutritious and succulent and afforded the best
of pasturage for the few horses and mules belonging to the miners.</p>

<p>Captain Dawson and Lieutenant Russell had ridden up the trail,
each mounted on a fine steed, which had brought them from Sacramento.
When the saddles and bridles were removed, the animals were turned
loose in the rich pasturage, which extended for miles over the
bottom of the ca単on. There, too, grazed the pony of Nellie Dawson,
the horses of Ruggles and Bidwell and the three mules owned by
Landlord Ortigies and Vose Adams. The latter were left to themselves,
except when needed for the periodical journeys to Sacramento.
The little drove constituted all the possessions of New Constantinople
in that line. Consequently, if any more of the miners wished to
join in the pursuit, they would have to do so on foot or on mule
back,&mdash;a fact which was likely to deter most of them.</p>

<p>In the early days of the settlement, before the descent of that
terrible blizzard, fully a dozen mules and horses were grazing
in the gorge, subject to the call of their owners, who, however,
did not expect to need them, unless they decided to remove to
some other site. But one morning every hoof had vanished and was
never seen again. The prints of moccasins, here and there in the
soft earth, left no doubt of the cause of their disappearance.
Perhaps this event had something to do with the permanence of
New Constantinople, since the means of a comfortable departure
with goods, chattels, tools and mining implements went off with
the animals.</p>

<p>After that the miners made no further investments in quadrupeds,
except to the extent of three or four mules, needed by Vose Adams,
though he was forced to make one journey to Sacramento on foot.
Thus matters stood until the addition of the horses. There was
always danger of their being stolen, but as the weeks and months
passed, without the occurrence of anything of that nature, the
matter was forgotten.</p>

<p>The three men were so familiar with the surroundings that they
made their way to the bottom of the ca単on with as much readiness
as if the sun were shining. Pausing beside the narrow, winding
stream, which at that season was no more than a brook, they stood
for several minutes peering here and there in the gloom, for the
animals indispensable for a successful pursuit of the eloping
ones.</p>

<p>"There's no saying how long it will take to find them," remarked
the captain impatiently; "it may be they have been grazing a mile
away."</p>

<p>"Have you any signal which your animal understands?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it is doubtful if he will obey it."</p>

<p>Captain Dawson placed his fingers between his lips and emitted
a peculiar tremulous whistle, repeating it three times with much
distinctness. Then all stood silent and listening.</p>

<p>"He may be asleep. Once he was prompt to obey me, but he has
been turned loose so long that there is little likelihood of his
heeding it."</p>

<p>"Try it again and a little stronger," suggested Ruggles.</p>

<p>The captain repeated the call until it seemed certain the animal
must hear it, but all the same, the result was nothing.</p>

<p>It was exasperating for the hounds thus to be held in leash when
the game was speeding from them, with the scent warm, but there
was no help for it.</p>

<p>"We are wasting time," said Dawson; "while you two go up the
gorge, I will take the other direction; look sharp for the animals
that are probably lying down; they are cunning and will not relish
being disturbed; if you find them whistle, and I'll do the same."</p>

<p>They separated, the captain following one course and his friends
the other.</p>

<p>"It'll be a bad go," remarked Ruggles, "if we don't find the
horses, for we won't have any show against them on their animals."</p>

<p>"Little indeed and yet it will not hold us back."</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" replied Ruggles with a concentration of passion
that made the words seem to hiss between his teeth.</p>

<p>Since the stream was so insignificant, Wade Ruggles leaped across
and went up the ca単on on the other side, his course being parallel
with his friend's. A hundred yards further and he made a discovery.</p>

<p>"Helloa, Brush, here they are!"</p>

<p>The parson bounded over the brook and hurried to his side, but
a disappointment followed. The three mules having cropped their
fill had lain down for the night but the horses were not in sight.</p>
