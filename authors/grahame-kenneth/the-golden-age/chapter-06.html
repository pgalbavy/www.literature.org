<p>NOBODY would have suspected Edward of being in love, had it not been
that after breakfast, with an overacted carelessness, ‘Anybody who
likes,’ he said, ‘can feed my rabbits,’ and he disappeared, with a
jauntiness that deceived nobody, in the direction of the orchard. Now
kingdoms might totter and reel, and convulsions play skittles with
the map of Europe; but the iron unwritten law prevailed, that each
boy severely fed his own rabbits. There was good ground, then, for
suspicion and alarm; and while the lettuce leaves were being drawn
through the wires, Harold and I conferred seriously on the situation.
</p><p>It may be thought that the affair was none of our business; and indeed
we cared little as individuals. We were only concerned as members of a
corporation, for each of whom the mental or physical ailment of one of
his fellows might have far-reaching effects. It was thought best that
Harold, as least open to suspicion of motive, should be despatched to
probe and peer. His instructions were, to proceed by a report on the
health of our rabbits in particular; to glide gently into a discussion
concerning rabbits in general, their customs, practices, and vices;
and to pass thence, by a natural transition, to the female sex, the
inherent flaws in its composition, and the reasons for regarding it
(speaking broadly) as dirt. He was especially to be very diplomatic,
and then to return and report progress. He departed on his mission
gaily; but his absence was short, and his return, discomfited and in
tears, seemed to betoken some want of parts for diplomacy. He had found
Edward, it appeared, pacing the orchard, with the sort of set smile
that mountebanks wear in their precarious antics, fixed painfully on
his face, as with pins. Harold had opened well, on the rabbit subject,
but, with a fatal confusion between the abstract and the concrete, had
then gone on to remark that Edward’s lop-eared doe, with her long
hindlegs and contemptuous twitch of the nose, always reminded him of
Sabina Larkin (a nine-year-old damsel, child of a neighbouring farmer):
at which point Edward, it would seem, had turned upon and savagely
maltreated him, twisting his arm and punching him in the short ribs.
So that Harold returned to the rabbit-hutches preceded by long-drawn
wails: anon wishing, with tears and sobs, that he were a man, to kick
his love-lorn brother; anon lamenting that ever he had been born.
</p><p>I was not big enough to stand up to Edward personally, so I had to
console the sufferer by allowing him to grease the wheels of the
donkey-cart—a luscious treat that had been specially reserved for me,
a week past, by the gardener’s boy, for putting in a good word on
his behalf with the new kitchen-maid. Harold was soon all smiles and
grease; and I was not, on the whole, dissatisfied with the significant
hint that had been gained as to the <u>fons et origo mali</u>.
</p><p>Fortunately, means were at hand for resolving any doubts on the
subject, since the morning was Sunday, and already the bells were
ringing for church. Lest the connexion may not be evident at first
sight, I should explain that the gloomy period of church-time, with its
enforced inaction and its lack of real interest—passed, too, within
sight of all that the village held of fairest—was just the one when a
young man’s fancies lightly turned to thoughts of love. The rest of
the week afforded no leisure for such trifling; but in church—well,
there was really nothing else to do! True, noughts-and-crosses might be
indulged in on flyleaves of prayer-books while the Litany dragged its
slow length along; but what balm or what solace could be found for the
Sermon? Naturally the eye, wandering here and there among the serried
ranks, made bold untrammelled choice among our fair fellow-supplicants.
It was in this way that, some months earlier, under the exceptional
strain of the Athanasian Creed, my roving fancy had settled upon the
baker’s wife as a fit object for a life-long devotion. Her riper charms
had conquered a heart which none of her be-muslined tittering juniors
had been able to subdue; and that she was already wedded had never
occurred to me as any bar to my affection. Edward’s general demeanour,
then, during morning service was safe to convict him; but there was
also a special test for the particular case. It happened that we sat in
a transept, and, the Larkins being behind us, Edward’s only chance of
feasting on Sabina’s charms was in the all-too fleeting interval when
we swung round eastwards. I was not mistaken. During the singing of the
Benedictus the impatient one made several false starts, and at last he
slewed fairly round before ‘As it was in the beginning, is now, and
ever shall be’ was half finished. The evidence was conclusive: a court
of law could have desired no better.
</p><p>The fact being patent, the next thing was to grapple with it; and my
mind was fully occupied during the sermon. There was really nothing
unfair or unbrotherly in my attitude. A philosophic affection such as
mine own, which clashed with nothing, was (I held) permissible; but the
volcanic passions in which Edward indulged about once a quarter were a
serious interference with business. To make matters worse, next week
there was a circus coming to the neighbourhood, to which we had all
been strictly forbidden to go; and without Edward no visit in contempt
of law and orders could be successfully brought off. I had sounded
him as to the circus on our way to church, and he had replied briefly
that the very thought of a clown made him sick. Morbidity could no
further go. But the sermon came to an end without any line of conduct
having suggested itself; and I walked home in some depression, feeling
sadly that Venus was in the ascendant and in direful opposition, while
Auriga—the circus star—drooped declinant, perilously near the horizon.
</p><p>By the irony of fate, Aunt Eliza, of all people, turned out to be the
_Dea ex machinâ_. The thing fell out in this wise. It was that lady’s
obnoxious practice to issue forth, of a Sunday afternoon, on a visit of
state to such farmers and cottagers as dwelt at hand; on which occasion
she was wont to hale a reluctant boy along with her, from the mixed
motives of propriety and his soul’s health. Much cudgelling of brains,
I suppose, had on that particular day made me torpid and unwary.
Anyhow, when a victim came to be sought for, I fell an easy prey, while
the others fled scatheless and whooping. Our first visit was to the
Larkins. Here ceremonial might be viewed in its finest flower, and we
conducted ourselves, like Queen Elizabeth when she trod the measure,
‘high and disposedly.’ In the low oak-panelled parlour cake and currant
wine were set forth, and, after courtesies and compliments exchanged,
Aunt Eliza, greatly condescending, talked the fashions with Mrs.
Larkin; while the farmer and I, perspiring with the unusual effort,
exchanged remarks on the mutability of the weather and the steady fall
in the price of corn. (Who would have thought, to hear us, that only
two short days ago we had confronted each other on either side of a
hedge? I triumphant, provocative, derisive? He flushed, wroth, cracking
his whip, and volleying forth profanity? So powerful is all-subduing
ceremony!) Sabina the while, demurely seated with a <u>Pilgrim’s
Progress</u> on her knee, and apparently absorbed in a brightly-coloured
presentment of ‘Apollyon Straddling Right across the Way,’ eyed me at
times with shy interest; but repelled all Aunt Eliza’s advances with a
frigid politeness for which I could not sufficiently admire her.
</p><p>‘It’s surprising to me,’ I heard my aunt remark presently, ‘how
my eldest nephew, Edward, despises little girls. I heard him tell
Charlotte the other day that he wished he could exchange her for a
pair of Japanese guinea-pigs. It made the poor child cry. Boys are so
heartless!’ (I saw Sabina stiffen as she sat, and her tip-tilted nose
twitched scornfully.) ‘Now this boy here——’ (my soul descended into my
very boots. Could the woman have intercepted any of my amorous glances
at the baker’s wife?) ‘Now this boy,’ my aunt went on, ‘is more human
altogether. Only yesterday he took his sister to the baker’s shop, and
spent his only penny buying her sweets. I thought it showed such a nice
disposition. I wish Edward were more like him!’
</p><p>I breathed again. It was unnecessary to explain my real motives
for that visit to the baker’s. Sabina’s face softened, and her
contemptuous nose descended from its altitude of scorn; she gave me one
shy glance of kindness, and then concentrated her attention upon Mercy
knocking at the Wicket Gate. I felt awfully mean as regarded Edward;
but what could I do? I was in Gaza, gagged and bound; the Philistines
hemmed me in.
</p><p>The same evening the storm burst, the bolt fell, and—to continue the
metaphor—the atmosphere grew serene and clear once more. The evening
service was shorter than usual, the vicar, as he ascended the pulpit
steps, having dropped two pages out of his sermon-case—unperceived by
any but ourselves, either at the moment or subsequently when the hiatus
was reached; so, as we joyfully shuffled out I whispered Edward that
by racing home at top speed we should make time to assume our bows and
arrows (laid aside for the day) and play at Indians and buffaloes with
Aunt Eliza’s fowls—already strolling roostwards, regardless of their
doom—before that sedately stepping lady could return. Edward hung at
the door, wavering; the suggestion had unhallowed charms. At that
moment Sabina issued primly forth, and, seeing Edward, put out her
tongue at him in the most exasperating manner conceivable; then passed
on her way, her shoulders rigid, her dainty head held high. A man can
stand very much in the cause of love: poverty, aunts, rivals, barriers
of every sort, all these only serve to fan the flame. But personal
ridicule is a shaft that reaches the very vitals. Edward led the race
home at a speed which one of Ballantyne’s heroes might have equalled
but never surpassed; and that evening the Indians dispersed Aunt
Eliza’s fowls over several square miles of country, so that the tale
of them remaineth incomplete unto this day. Edward himself, cheering
wildly, pursued the big Cochin-China cock till the bird sank gasping
under the drawing-room window, whereat its mistress stood petrified;
and after supper, in the shrubbery, smoked a half-consumed cigar he had
picked up in the road, and declared to an awe-stricken audience his
final, his immitigable resolve to go into the army.
</p><p>[Illustration: “EDWARD LED THE RACE HOME AT A SPEED WHICH ONE OF
<strong>BALLANTYNE’S HEROES MIGHT HAVE EQUALLED BUT NEVER SURPASSED”]</strong>
</p><p>The crisis was past, and Edward was saved!... And yet ... <u>sunt
lachrymæ rerum</u> ... to me watching the cigar-stump alternately
pale and glow against the dark background of laurel, a vision of a
tip-tilted nose, of a small head poised scornfully, seemed to hover
on the gathering gloom—seemed to grow and fade and grow again, like
the grin of the Cheshire cat—pathetically, reproachfully even; and the
charms of the baker’s wife slipped from my memory like snow-wreaths in
thaw. After all, Sabina was nowise to blame: why should the child be
punished? To-morrow I would give them the slip, and stroll round by
her garden promiscuous-like, at a time when the farmer was safe in the
rick-yard. If nothing came of it, there was no harm done; and if on the
contrary...!
