<p>"I suspected her from the first," explained Anthony. "There was
a light in her room on the night of the murder. Afterwards, I
wavered. I made inquiries about her in Brittany, and came back
satisfied that she was what she represented herself to be. I was
a fool. Because the Comtesse de Breteuil had employed a Mademoiselle
Brun and spoke highly of her, it never occurred to me that the
real Mademoiselle Brun might have been kidnapped on her way to
her new post, and that it might be a substitute taking her place.
Instead I shifted my suspicions to Mr. Fish. It was not until
he had followed me to Dover, and we had had a mutual explanation
that I began to see clearly. Once I knew that he was a Pinkerton’s
man, trailing King Victor, my suspicions swung back again to their
original object.</p>

<p>"The thing that worried me most was that Mrs. Revel had definitely
recognized the woman. Then I remembered that it was only <em>after</em>
I had mentioned her being Madame de Breteuil’s governess. And
all she had said was that that accounted for the fact that the
woman’s face was familiar to her. Superintendent Battle will tell
you that a deliberate plot was formed to keep Mrs. Revel from
coming to Chimneys. Nothing more nor less than a dead body, in
fact. And though the murder was the work of the Comrades of the
Red Hand, punishing supposed treachery on the part of the victim,
the staging of it, and the absence of the Comrades’ sign manual,
pointed to some abler intelligence directing operations. From
the first, I suspected some connection with Herzoslovakia. Mrs.
Revel was the only member of the house party who had been to the
country. I suspected at first that some one was impersonating
Prince Michael, but that proved to be a totally erroneous idea.
When I realized the possibility of Mademoiselle Brun’s being an
impostor, and added to that the fact that her face was familiar
to Mrs. Revel, I began to see daylight. It was evidently very
important that she should not be recognized, and Mrs. Revel was
the only person likely to do so."</p>

<p>"But who was she?" said Lord Caterham. "Some one Mrs. Revel had
known in Herzoslovakia?"</p>

<p>"I think the Baron might be able to tell us," said Anthony.</p>

<p>"I?" The Baron stared at him, then down at the motionless figure.</p>

<p>"Look well," said Anthony. "Don’t be put off by the make-up.
She was an actress once, remember."</p>

<p>The Baron stared again. Suddenly he started.</p>

<p>"God in heaven," he breathed, "it is not possible."</p>

<p>"What is not possible?" asked George. "Who is the lady? You recognize
her, Baron?"</p>

<p>"No, no, it is not possible." The Baron continued to mutter.
"She was killed. They were both killed. On the steps of the Palace.
Her body was recovered."</p>

<p>"Mutilated and unrecognizable," Anthony reminded him. "She managed
to put up a bluff. I think she escaped to America, and has spent
a good many years lying low in deadly terror of the Comrades of
the Red Hand. They promoted the Revolution, remember, and, to
use an expressive phrase, they always had it in for her. Then
King Victor was released, and they planned to recover the diamond
together. She was searching for it that night when she came suddenly
upon Prince Michael, and he recognized her. There was never much
fear of her meeting him in the ordinary way of things. Royal guests
don’t come in contact with governesses, and she could always retire
with a convenient <em>migraine</em>, as she did the day the Baron
was here.</p>

<p>"However, she met Prince Michael face to face when she least
expected it. Exposure and disgrace stared her in the face. She
shot him. It was she who placed the revolver in Isaacstein’s suit-case,
so as to confuse the trail, and she who returned the letters."</p>

<p>Lemoine moved forward.</p>

<p>"She was coming down to search for the jewel that night, you
say," he said. "Might she not have been going to meet her accomplice,
King Victor, who was coming from outside? Eh? What do you say
to that?"</p>

<p>Anthony sighed.</p>

<p>"Still at it, my dear Lemoine? How persistent you are! You won’t
take my hint that I’ve got a trump card up my sleeve?"</p>

<p>But George, whose mind worked slowly, now broke in.</p>

<p>"I am still completely at sea. Who was this lady, Baron? You
recognize her, it seems?"</p>

<p>But the Baron drew himself up and stood very straight and stiff.</p>

<p>"You are in error, Mr. Lomax. To my knowledge I have not this
lady seen before. A complete stranger she is to me."</p>

<p>"But——"</p>

<p>George stared at him—bewildered.</p>

<p>The Baron took him into a corner of the room, and murmured something
into his ear. Anthony watched, with a good deal of enjoyment,
George’s face turning slowly purple, his eyes bulging, and all
the incipient symptoms of apoplexy. A murmur of George’s throaty
voice came to him.</p>

<p>"Certainly ... certainly ... by all means ... no need at all
... complicate situation ... utmost discretion."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Lemoine hit the table sharply with his hand. "I do not
care about all this! The murder of Prince Michael—that was not
my affair. I want King Victor."</p>

<p>Anthony shook his head gently.</p>

<p>"I’m sorry for you, Lemoine. You’re really a very able fellow.
But, all the same, you’re going to lose the trick. I’m about to
play my trump card."</p>

<p>He stepped across the room and rang the bell. Tredwell answered
it.</p>

<p>"A gentleman arrived with me this evening, Tredwell."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a foreign gentleman."</p>

<p>"Quite so. Will you kindly ask him to join us here as soon as
possible?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Tredwell withdrew.</p>

<p>"Entry of the trump card, the mysterious Monsieur X," remarked
Anthony. "<em>Who is he?</em> Can anyone guess?"</p>

<p>"Putting two and two together," said Herman Isaacstein, "what
with your mysterious hints this morning, and your attitude this
afternoon, I should say there was no doubt about it. Somehow or
other you’ve managed to get hold of Prince Nicholas of Herzoslovakia."</p>

<p>"You think the same, Baron?"</p>

<p>"I do. Unless yet another impostor you have put forward. But
that I will not believe. With me, your dealings most honourable
have been."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Baron. I shan’t forget those words. So you are all
agreed?"</p>

<p>His eyes swept round the circle of waiting faces. Only Lemoine
did not respond, but kept his eyes fixed sullenly on the table.</p>

<p>Anthony’s quick ears had caught the sound of footsteps outside
in the hall.</p>

<p>"And yet, you know," he said with a queer smile, "you’re all
wrong!"</p>

<p>He crossed swiftly to the door and flung it open.</p>

<p>A man stood on the threshold—a man with a neat black beard, eyeglasses,
and a foppish appearance slightly marred by a bandage round the
head.</p>

<p>"<em>Allow me to present you to the real Monsieur Lemoine of
the Sûreté.</em>"</p>

<p>There was a rush and a scuffle, and then the nasal tones of Mr.
Hiram Fish rose bland and reassuring from the window.</p>

<p>"No, you don’t, Sonny—not this way. I have been stationed here
this whole evening for the particular purpose of preventing your
escape. You will observe that I have you covered well and good
with this gun of mine. I came over to get you, and I’ve got you—but
you sure are some lad!"</p>
