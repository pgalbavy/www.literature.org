<P>
&gt;From where Hamel stood a queer object came strangely into sight.
Below the terrace of St. David's Hall - from a spot, in fact, at
the base of the solid wall - it seemed as though a gate had been
opened, and there came towards him what he at first took to be a
tricycle.  As it came nearer, it presented even a weirder
appearance.  Mr. Fentolin, in a black cape and black skull cap,
sat a little forward in his electric carriage, with his hand upon
the guiding lever.  His head came scarcely above the back of the
little vehicle, his hands and body were motionless.  He seemed to
be progressing without the slightest effort, personal or mechanical,
as though he rode, in deed, in some ghostly vehicle.  From the same
place in the wall had issued, a moment or two later, a man upon a
bicycle, who was also coming towards him.  Hamel was scarcely
conscious of this secondary figure.  His eyes were fixed upon the
strange personage now rapidly approaching him.  There was something
which seemed scarcely human in that shrunken fragment of body, the
pale face with its waving white hair, the strange expression with
which he was being regarded.  The little vehicle came to a
standstill only a few feet away.  Mr. Fentolin leaned forward.  His
features had lost their delicately benevolent aspect; his words
were minatory.
<P>
"I am under the impression, sir," he said, " that I saw you with my
glasses from the window attempting to force an entrance into that
building."
<P>
Hamel nodded.
<P>
"I not only tried but I succeeded," he remarked.  "I got in through
the window."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin's eyes glittered for a moment.  Hamel, who had resumed
his place upon the rock close at hand, had been mixed up during his
lifetime in many wild escapades.  Yet at that moment he had a sudden
feeling that there were dangers in life which as yet he had not
faced.
<P>
"May I ask for your explanation or your excuse?" "
<P>
"You can call it an explanation or an excuse, whichever you like,"
Hamel replied steadily, "but the fact is that this little building,
which some one else seems to have appropriated, is mine.  If I had
not been a good-natured person, I should be engaged, at the present
moment, in turning out its furniture on to the beach."
<P>
"What is your name?" Mr. Fentolin asked suddenly.
<P>
"My name is Hamel - Richard Hamel."
<P>
For several moments there was silence.  Mr. Fentolin was still
leaning forward in his strange little vehicle.  The colour seemed
to have left even his lips.  The hard glitter in his eyes had given
place to an expression almost like fear.  He looked at Richard
Hamel as though he were some strange sea-monster come up from
underneath the sands.
<P>
"Richard Hamel," he repeated.  "Do you mean that you are the son of
Hamel, the R.A., who used to be in these parts so often?  He was my
brother's friend."
<P>
"I am his son."
<P>
"But his son was killed in the San Francisco earthquake.  I saw his
name in all the lists.  It was copied into the local papers here."
<P>
Hamel knocked the ashes from his pipe.
<P>
"I take a lot of killing," he observed.  "I was in that earthquake,
right enough, and in the hospital afterwards, but it was a man named
Hamel of Philadelphia who died."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin sat quite motionless for several moments.  He seemed,
if possible, to have shrunken into something smaller still.  A few
yards behind, Meekins had alighted from his bicycle and was standing
waiting.
<P>
"So you are Richard Hamel," Mr. Fentolin said at last very softly.
"Welcome back to England, Richard Hamel!  I knew your father
slightly, although we were never very friendly."
<P>
He stretched out his hand from underneath the coverlet of his little
vehicle - a hand with long, white fingers, slim and white and
shapely as a woman's.  A single ring with a dull green stone was on
his fourth finger.  Hamel shook bands with him as he would have
shaken hands with a woman.  Afterwards he rubbed his fingers slowly
together.  There was something about the touch which worried him.
<P>
"You have been making use of this little shanty, haven't you?" he
asked bluntly.
<P>
Mr. Fentolin nodded.  He was apparently begin ning to recover
himself.
<P>
"You must remember," he explained suavely, "that it was built by my
grandfather, and that we have had rights over the whole of the
foreshore here from time immemorial.  I know quite well that my
brother gave it to your father - or rather he sold it to him for a
nominal sum.  I must tell you that it was a most complicated
transaction.  He had the greatest difficulty in getting any lawyer
to draft the deed of sale.  There were so many ancient rights and
privileges which it was impossible to deal with.  Even now there
are grave doubts as to the validity of the transaction.  When nothing
was heard of you, and we all concluded that you were dead, I ventured
to take back what I honestly believed to be my own.  Owing," he
continued slowly, "to my unfortunate affliction, I am obliged to
depend for interest in my life upon various hobbies.  This little
place, queerly enough, has become one of them.  I have furnished it,
in a way; installed the telephone to the house, connected it with
my electric plant, and I come down here when I want to be quite
alone, and paint.  I watch the sea - such a sea sometimes, such
storms, such colour!  You notice that ridge of sand out yonder?  It
forms a sort of natural breakwater.  Even on the calmest day you
can trace that white line of foam."
<P>
"It is a strange coast," Hamel admitted.
<P>
Mr. Fentolin pointed with his forefinger northwards.
<P>
"Somewhere about there," he indicated, "is the entrance to the
tidal river which flows up to the village of St.  David's yonder.
You see?"
<P>
His finger traced its course until it came to a certain point near
the beach, where a tall black pillar stood, surmounted by a globe.
<P>
"I have had a light fixed there for the benefit or the fishermen,"
he said, "a light which I work from my own dynamo.  Between where
we are sitting now and there - only a little way out to sea - is a
jagged cluster of cruel rocks.  You can see them if you care to swim
out in calm weather.  Fishermen who tried to come in by night were
often trapped there and, in a rough sea, drowned.  That is why I
had that pillar of light built.  On stormy nights it shows the exact
entrance to the water causeway."
<P>
"Very kind of you indeed," Hamel remarked, "very benevolent."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin sighed.
<P>
"So few people have any real feeling for sailors," he continued.
"The fishermen around here are certainly rather a casual class.  Do
you know that there is scarcely one of them who can swim?  There
isn't one of them who isn't too lazy to learn even the simplest
stroke.  My brother used to say - dear Gerald - that it served them
right if they were drowned.  I have never been able to feel like
that, Mr. Hamel.  Life is such a wonderful thing.  One night," he
went on, dropping his voice and leaning a little forward in his
carriage -" it was just before, or was it just after I had fixed
that light - I was down here one dark winter night.  There was a
great north wind and a huge sea running.  It was as black as pitch,
but I heard a boat making for St. David's causeway strike on those
rocks just hidden in front there.  I heard those fishermen shriek
as they went under.  I heard their shouts for help, I heard their
death cries.  Very terrible, Mr. Hamel!  Very terrible!"
<P>
Hamel looked at the speaker curiously.  Mr. Fentolin seemed
absorbed in his subject.  He had spoken with relish, as one who
loves the things he speaks about.  Quite unaccountably, Hamel
found himself shivering.
<P>
"It was their mother," Mr. Fentolin continued, leaning again a
little forward in his chair, "their mother whom I saw pass along
the beach just now - a widow, too, poor thing.  She comes here
often - a morbid taste.  She spoke to you, I think?"
<P>
"She spoke to me strangely," Hamel admitted. "She gave me the
impression of a woman whose brain had been turned with grief."
<P>
"Too true," Mr. Fentolin sighed.  "The poor creature! I offered her
a small pension, but she would have none of it.  A superior woman
in her way once, filled now with queer fancies," he went on, eyeing
Hamel steadily,-" the very strangest fancies.  She spends her life
prowling about here.  No one in the village even knows how she lives.
Did she speak of me, by-the-by?"
<P>
"She spoke of you as being a very kind-hearted man."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin sighed.
<P>
"The poor creature!  Well, well, let us revert to the object of
your coming here.  Do you really wish to occupy this little shanty,
Mr. Hamel?"
<P>
"That was my idea," Hamel confessed.  "I only came back from Mexico
last month, and I very soon got fed up with life in town.  I am
going abroad again next year.  Till then, I am rather at a loose
end.  My father was always very keen indeed about this place, and
very anxious that I should come and stay here for a little time, so
I made up my mind to run down.  I've got some things waiting at
Norwich.  I thought I might hire a woman to look after me and spend
a few weeks here.  They tell me that the early spring is almost the
best time for this coast."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin nodded slowly.  He moistened his lips for a moment.
One might have imagined that he was anxious.
<P>
"Mr. Hamel," he said softly, "you are quite right.  It is the best
time to visit this coast.  But why make a hermit of yourself?  You
are a family friend.  Come and stay with us at the Hall for as long
as you like.  It will give me the utmost pleasure to welcome you
there," he went on earnestly, "and as for this little place, of what
use is it to you?  Let me buy it from you.  You are a man of the
world, I can see.  You may be rich, yet money has a definite value.
To me it has none.  That little place, as it stands, is probably
worth - say a hundred pounds.  Your father gave, if I remember
rightly, a five pound note for it.  I will give you a thousand for
it sooner than be disturbed."
<P>
Hamel frowned slightly.
<P>
"I could not possibly think," he said, "of selling what was
practically a gift to my father.  You are welcome to occupy the
place during my absence in any way you wish.  On the other hand, I
do not think that I care to part with it altogether, and I should
really like to spend just a day or so here.  I am used to roughing
it under all sorts of conditions - much more used to roughing it
than I am to staying at country houses."
 
Mr. Fentolin leaned a little out of his carriage.  He reached the
younger man's shoulder with his hand.
<P>
"Ah! Mr. Hamel," he pleaded, "don't make up your mind too suddenly.
Am I a little spoilt, I wonder?  Well, you see what sort of a
creature I am.  I have to go through life as best I may, and people
are kind to me.  It is very seldom I am crossed.  It is quite
astonishing how often people let me have my own way.  Do not make
up your mind too suddenly.  I have a niece and a nephew whom you
must meet.  There are some treasures, too, at St. David's Hall.
Look at it.  There isn't another house quite like it in England.
It is worth looking over."
<P>
"It is most impressive," Hamel agreed, "and wonderfully beautiful.
It seems odd," he added, with a laugh," that you should care about
this little shanty here, with all the beautiful rooms you must have
of your own."
<P>
"It's Naboth's vineyard," Mr. Fentolin groaned.  "Now, Mr. Hamel,
you are going to be gracious, aren't you?  Let us leave the question
of your little habitation here alone for the present.  Come back
with me.  My niece shall give you some tea, and you shall choose
your room from forty.  You can sleep in a haunted chamber, or a
historical chamber, in Queen Elizabeth's room, a Victorian chamber,
or a Louis Quinze room.  All my people have spent their substance
in furniture.  Don't look at your bag.  Clothes are unnecessary.  I
can supply you with everything.  Or, if you prefer it, I can send a
fast car into Norwich for your own things.  Come and be my guest,
please."
<P>
Hamel hesitated.  He had not the slightest desire to go to St.
David's Hall, and though he strove to ignore it, he was conscious
of an aversion of which he was heartily ashamed for this strange
fragment of humanity.  On the other hand, his mission, the actual
mission which had brought him down to these parts, could certainly
best be served by an entree into the Hall itself - and there was
the girl, whom he felt sure belonged there.  He had never for a
moment been able to dismiss her from his thoughts.  Her still, cold
face, the delicate perfection of her clothes and figure, the grey
eyes which had rested upon his so curiously, haunted him.  He was
desperately anxious to see her again.  If he refused this invitation,
if he rejected Mr. Fentolin's proffered friendship, it would be all
the more difficult.
<P>
"You are really very kind," he began hesitatingly -
<P>
"It is settled," Mr. Fentolin interrupted, "settled.  Meekins, you
can ride back again.  I shall not paint to-day.  Mr.  Hamel, you
will walk by my side, will you not?  I can run my little machine
quite slowly.  You see, I have an electric battery.  It needs
charging often, but I have a dynamo of my own.  You never saw a
vehicle like this in all your travellings, did you?"
<P>
Hamel shook his head.
<P>
"An electrical bath-chair," Mr. Fentolin continued.  "Practice has
made me remarkably skilful in its manipulation.  You see, I can
steer to an inch."
<P>
He was already turning around.  Hamel rose to his feet.
<P>
"You are really very kind," he said.  "I should like to come up and
see the Hall, at any rate, but in the meantime, as we are here,
could I just look over the inside of this little place?  I found the
large shed where the lifeboat used to be kept, locked up."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin was manoeuvring his carriage.  His back was towards
Hamel.
<P>
"By all means," he declared.  "We will go in together.  I have had
the entrance widened so that I can ride straight into the
sitting-room.  But wait."
<P>
He paused suddenly.  He felt in all his pockets.
<P>
"Dear me," he exclaimed, "I find that I have left the keys!  We
will come down a little later, if you do not mind, Mr.  Hamel.  Or
to-morrow, perhaps.  You will not mind?  It is very careless of me,
but seeing you about the place and imagining that you were an
intruder, made me angry, and I started off in a hurry.  Now walk by
my side up to the house, please, and talk to me.  It is so
interesting for me to meet men," he went on, as they started along
the straight path, "who do things in life; who go to foreign
countries, meet strange people, and have new experiences.  I have
been a good many years like this, you know."
<P>
"It is a great affliction," Hamel murmured sympathetically.
<P>
"In my youth I was an athlete," Mr. Fentolin continued.  "I played
cricket for the Varsity and for my county.  I hunted, too, and shot.
I did all the things a man loves to do.  I might still shoot, they
tell me, but my strength has ebbed away.  I am too weak to lift a
gun, too weak even to handle a fishing-rod.  I have just a few
hobbies in life which keep me alive.  Are you a politician, Mr.
Hamel?"
<P>
"Not in the least," Hamel replied.  "I have been out of England too
long to keep in touch with politics."
<P>
"Naturally," Mr. Fentolin agreed.  "It amuses me to follow the
course of events.  I have a good many friends in London and abroad
who are kind to me, who keep me informed, send me odd bits of
information not available for every one, and it amuses me to put
these things together in my mind and to try and play the prophet.
I was in the Foreign Office once, you know.  I take up my paper
every morning, and it is one of my chief interests to see how near
my own speculations come to the truth.  Just now for example, there
are strange things doing on the Continent."
<P>
"In America," Hamel remarked, "they affect to look upon England as
a doomed Power."
<P>
"Not altogether supine yet," Mr. Fentolin observed, "yet even this
last generation has seen weakening.  We have lost so much
self-reliance.  Perhaps it is having these grown-up children who we
think can take care of us - Canada and Australia, and the others.
However, we will not talk of politics.  It bores you, I can see.
We will try and find some other subject.  Now tell me, don't you
think this is ingenious?"
<P>
They had reached the foot of the hill upon which the Hall was
situated.  In front of them, underneath the terrace, was a little
iron gate, held open now by Meekins, who had gone on ahead and
dismounted from his bicycle.
<P>
"I have a subterranean way from here into the Hall," Mr. Fentolin
explained.  "Come with me.  You will only have to stoop a little,
and it may amuse you.  You need not be afraid.  There are electric
lights every ten yards.  I turn them on with this switch - see."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin touched a button in the wall, and the place was at
once brilliantly illuminated.  A little row of lights from the
ceiling and the walls stretched away as far as one could see.  They
passed through the iron gates, which shut behind them with a click.
Stooping a little, Hamel was still able to walk by the side of the
man in the chair.  They traversed about a hundred yards of
subterranean way.  Here and there a fungus hung down from the wall,
otherwise it was beautifully kept and dry.  By and by, with a
little turn, they came to an incline and another iron gate, held
open for them by a footman.  Mr. Fentolin sped up the last few feet
into the great hail, which seemed more imposing than ever by reason
of this unexpected entrance.  Hamel, blinking a little, stepped to
his side.
<P>
"Welcome!" Mr. Fentolin cried gaily.  "Welcome, my friend Mr. Hamel,
to St. David's Hall!"
