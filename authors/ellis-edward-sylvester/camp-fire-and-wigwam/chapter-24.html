<p>Jack Carleton saw that he was caught in an exceedingly unpleasant
dilemma. He had a considerable distance to walk to reach the lodge
of Ogallah and was sure to be tormented all the way. He could
not feel certain even, that the wigwam of the chieftain would
afford him protection, while nothing could be more manifest than
that this was but the beginning of a series of numberless persecutions
to which he would be subjected.</p>

<p>He was allowed to take six or eight steps in peace, when one
of the Indian boys slipped up behind and with his foot struck
his heel, just as it left the ground. This threw the toe behind
Jack's other leg and caused him to stumble again, though, as he
was expecting something of the kind, he recovered himself with
more ease.</p>

<p>A few seconds later, Jack was passing among the different lodges,
and walking rapidly toward that of the chieftain. His presence
became known to the whole village in a very brief time, and the
younger portion came flocking around him, as though he was some
wonderful curiosity, which, under the circumstances, was the fact.</p>

<p>Ogallah was among those who came to the front of the lodges to
learn what caused the uproar. When he caught sight of Jack, he
called out something and made excited gestures to him. The boy
supposed they were intended to hurry his return, and finding his
persecutors closing around him, he broke into a run.</p>

<p>Then the stones and clods began to fly. The whole rabble joined
in, and when the poor captive dodged into the wigwam, he was bruised
and half frightened to death. He watched the entrance in terror,
but his tormentors did not dare follow him into the home of their
chief, who would have been quick to resent such an invasion of
his dignity and rights.</p>

<p>Jack was panting and frightened, but he had received no serious
hurts. What alarmed him, more than everything else, was the foreshadowing
thus made of the treatment in store for him.</p>

<p>"I can't stand this," was his thought, after he had partly regained
his composure. "I shall have to stay in here altogether or run
the gauntlet every time I go out."</p>

<p>But all this time, Ogallah kept talking and making vigorous gestures
to him. The chief had followed him to the middle of the lodge,
where the two sat on the ground cross-legged and began eating
the meat which the squaw had prepared. She did not join them,
and the boy had little appetite after his exciting experience.
The gestures of Ogallah continued so long that it was evident
he was seeking to say something of importance to Jack.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the old fellow means," muttered the lad, ceasing
his meal and studying the gyrating arms and spluttering countenance.
The chieftain was striking the air as if fighting an imaginary
foe, and then, pointing toward Jack he nodded his head vigorously
and again pointed to the outside.</p>

<p>Suddenly the meaning of the pantomime broke upon the youth.</p>

<p>"By gracious! if he isn't urging me to sail into those fellows.
I say, Ogallah, will you back me up and see that I have fair play?"</p>

<p>Jack raised his voice to a loud key, as though that would help
the chieftain understand his words; but it could not be expected
that he would grasp their meaning, as they were not punctuated
with any gesture and accompanied only by an eager expression of
countenance.</p>

<p>But Ogallah probably saw that the youth had caught <em>his</em>
meaning, for he nodded his head and grinned with delight.</p>

<p>"If he will only keep the crowd off me," said Jack to himself,
"I won't ask anything better than a chance to get even with that
big fellow and after him the other two, if they want to take a
hand in the fun."</p>

<p>The voices and turmoil in front of the lodge showed that the
crowd were there waiting for Jack to come forth, that they might
continue the amusement which was interrupted by his flight. The
lad spent a minute or two in conversing by means of gestures with
the chief, whose meaning seemed plainer now that he had caught
the gist of his first proposal.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure he promises to see that I have fair play," thought
Jack; "but, if I am mistaken I shall get into a pretty scrape.
Anything, however, is preferable to this state of affairs, and
it must be ended one way or another very soon."</p>

<p>Ogallah showed a childish delight when he saw that the youth
had made up his mind to have a bout with the ringleaders who had
started out to make life a burden to him. Even the squaw partook
of the general excitement and followed the two out doors.</p>

<p>The chieftain cleared the way for the captive, who was greeted
with the most uproarious cries as soon as seen by the company,
which numbered over a hundred bucks, squaws and children, exclusive
of the dogs which added to the unearthly racket by their barking,
yelping and howling.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton kept well under the wing of Ogallah until he could
see what was to take place. The chief talked for a short time
with several of his warriors, who closed around him, the rest
holding him in such awe that they refrained from disturbing the
prisoner until permission was given.</p>

<p>It was quickly settled: Ogallah and two of his men cleared a
space a rod square and then beckoned to Jack, who walked defiantly
to the middle of it and folded his arms.</p>

<p>"Something must be done pretty soon," was his thought, as he
scanned the scowling, laughing, shouting mob. "They would like
to tear me to pieces, and, if they come all at once, they will
do it too."</p>

<p>The three Indian youths who had assailed Jack at the spring,
leaped about and were as frantically eager as so many bull-dogs
to fly at the poor fellow, who was never in sorer need of a powerful
friend.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of them received the signal, and, with a whoop of
delight, he lowered his head and ran at Jack like a Japanese wrestler
or a mad bull. The boy saw he meant to butt him in the stomach,
and if he did so he would suffer serious injury. Forewarned was
forearmed in his case, and, leaping aside, he tripped the Indian
as he shot by, and sent him sprawling on his hands and knees.
The uproar was deafening, but the contest, it may be said, had
only opened, and the young Sauk bounded to his feet as if made
of India Rubber. His coppery face was aglow with passion, and,
pausing but an instant, he made a second rush, though this time
he kept his head up, and spread out his arms so as to prevent
Jack escaping him.</p>

<p>Jack did not want to escape. He seized his assailant at the same
moment that the latter grasped him, and in a twinkling they were
interlocked and struggling like tigers. But the dusky youth was
not only younger and slighter than Jack, but he was not so strong.
Furthermore, his skill in wrestling was less than that of the
white youth, who, like all the youths of the border, was trained
in the rough, athletic exercise so popular with every people.</p>

<p>The contest was as brief as it was fierce. Suddenly a pair of
moccasins kicked the air, and the presumptuous young Sauk went
to the earth as if flung from the top of a church steeple. The
shock was tremendous and caused a momentary hush, for it looked
as if he had been killed.</p>

<p>The mother of the overthrown wrestler ran forward from the crowd,
and with wild lamentations, bent over him. When she saw him move
and found he was not dead, she whirled about, and, with a shriek,
made for Jack Carleton, who dreaded just such an attack; but Ogallah
seized her arm ere she reached the frightened youth, and flung
her back with a violence and a threat which stopped her from repeating
the attack.</p>

<p>This incident gave Jack great encouragement, for it confirmed
his belief that the sachem meant he should have fair treatment,
and would allow no dishonest advantage to be taken of him.</p>

<p>The second dusky youth, who was slighter than Jack, was signalled
to advance to the attack, but to the surprise of all, he shook
his head in dissent and declined to come forward. The manner in
which his companion had been handled was enough to convince him
that the most prudent thing for him to do was to play the part
of spectator only.</p>

<p>Not so, however, with the larger and older youth, who had arrived
almost at man's estate. He was quite an athlete among his people,
and could scarcely restrain his eagerness to attack the pale face,
who had vanquished an opponent younger and weaker than himself.
Ogallah nodded his head, and, amid a noise which may be called
applause, the young warrior strode forward and laid his hands
on Jack, who, realizing the difficult task before him, was resolute,
watchful, and yet confident.</p>

<p>The young Sauk seemed to be left handed, like Deerfoot, the Shawanoe,
for he placed himself on the right of Jack, and slid his arm over
the boy's neck, while Jack assumed his favorite hold with his
right. The Indian was slightly the taller, and was naked to the
waist, which was encircled by a girdle, containing no weapons,
below which were his breech clout, leggings and moccasins. There
was nothing on his arms, his costume being that of a professional
Indian wrestler "stripped for the fray."</p>

<p>When he slid his arm over Jack's neck, he bent his head forward
so that he could look down at their feet. Jack thus found the
black hair, parted in the middle and dangling over the coppery
shoulders, directly under his eyes. He noted the large, misshapen
nose, the narrow forehead, immensely broad temples, and uncouth
lower jaw, and, during the few seconds they were waiting, reflected
what an ugly warrior the youth was certain to prove if he lived
a few years longer.</p>

<p>He was the ringleader among Jack's persecutors, and the lad determined
to conquer him if within the range of the most desperate effort.
The style in which he took hold of the pale face told the latter
that he possessed considerable skill, and it would be a mistake
to estimate him too lightly.</p>

<p>Jack reached over his left hand to grasp the right of his antagonist,
but the latter declined to take it, and the free hands, therefore,
were held, as may be said, in reserve to be used as inclination
prompted.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Sauk kicked one of Jack's heels forward and made
a quick strong effort to fling him backward. It was done with
great deftness, and came within a hair of laying Jack flat on
his back. He recovered himself by a fierce effort, and the attempt
was instantly repeated, but he saved himself in better shape than
before.</p>

<p>Again the two crouched side by side, each with an arm over the
other, and watching like cats for the chance to seize an advantage.
As a feeler, Jack tried the same trick his foe had used, but the
Sauk was too watchful and was scarcely disturbed. All at once
the pale face slid his arm down until it rested on the girdle
at the waist of the Indian. Then joining his two hands and pressing
him until he could hardly breathe, Jack raised him like a flash,
clear of his feet, and made as if to throw him forward on his
face. At the instant the Sauk put forth his frantic efforts to
save himself from going in that direction, Jack reversed the enginery,
and sent him backward on his head with a shock that made the ground
tremble.</p>

<p>The fall was terrific, and looking down at the motionless figure,
Jack believed he had broken his neck.</p>

<p>"I hope I have," he muttered in the flush of his excitement,
"but that kind are tough&mdash;helloa!"</p>

<p>The prostrate youth began to gasp and make spasmodic movements
of his limbs&mdash;enough to prove he was alive.</p>

<p>While Jack stood surveying him, as if waiting another attack,
the mob broke into the most frightful yells and made a rush for
him. He had overthrown those that had been matched against him,
and now they meant to kill him; but Jack's faith in Ogallah was
not misplaced. He and his brother warriors interfered in such
a vigorous manner that not a hair of the boy's head was harmed,
and, turning around, he walked into the lodge of the chieftain,
conscious that he had won a great victory.</p>
