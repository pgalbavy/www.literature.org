Having burned my ship, I plunged into writing.  I am afraid I
always was an extremist.  Early and late I was at it--writing,
typing, studying grammar, studying writing and all the forms of
writing, and studying the writers who succeeded in order to find
out how they succeeded.  I managed on five hours' sleep in the
twenty-four, and came pretty close to working the nineteen waking
hours left to me.  My light burned till two and three in the
morning, which led a good neighbour woman into a bit of
sentimental Sherlock-Holmes deduction.  Never seeing me in the
day-time, she concluded that I was a gambler, and that the light
in my window was placed there by my mother to guide her erring son
home.
<P>
The trouble with the beginner at the writing game is the long, dry
spells, when there is never an editor's cheque and everything
pawnable is pawned.  I wore my summer suit pretty well through
that winter, and the following summer experienced the longest,
dryest spell of all, in the period when salaried men are gone on
vacation and manuscripts lie in editorial offices until vacation
is over.
<P>
My difficulty was that I had no one to advise me.  I didn't know a
soul who had written or who had ever tried to write.  I didn't
even know one reporter.  Also, to succeed at the writing game, I
found I had to unlearn about everything the teachers and
professors of literature of the high school and university had
taught me.  I was very indignant about this at the time; though
now I can understand it.  They did not know the trick of
successful writing in the years 1895 and 1896.  They knew all
about "Snow Bound" and "Sartor Resartus"; but the American editors
of 1899 did not want such truck.  They wanted the 1899 truck, and
offered to pay so well for it that the teachers and professors of
literature would have quit their jobs could they have supplied it.
<P>
I struggled along, stood off the butcher and the grocer, pawned my
watch and bicycle and my father's mackintosh, and I worked.  I
really did work, and went on short commons of sleep.  Critics have
complained about the swift education one of my characters, Martin
Eden, achieved.  In three years, from a sailor with a common
school education, I made a successful writer of him.  The critics
say this is impossible.  Yet I was Martin Eden.  At the end of
three working years, two of which were spent in high school and
the university and one spent at writing, and all three in studying
immensely and intensely, I was publishing stories in magazines
such as the "Atlantic Monthly," was correcting proofs of my first
book (issued by Houghton, Mifflin Co.), was selling sociological
articles to "Cosmopolitan" and "McClure's," had declined an
associate editorship proffered me by telegraph from New York City,
and was getting ready to marry.
<P>
Now the foregoing means work, especially the last year of it, when
I was learning my trade as a writer.  And in that year, running
short on sleep and tasking my brain to its limit, I neither drank
nor cared to drink.  So far as I was concerned, alcohol did not
exist.  I did suffer from brain-fag on occasion, but alcohol never
suggested itself as an ameliorative.  Heavens! Editorial
acceptances and cheques were all the amelioratives I needed.  A
thin envelope from an editor in the morning's mail was more
stimulating than half a dozen cocktails.  And if a cheque of
decent amount came out of the envelope, such incident in itself
was a whole drunk.
<P>
Furthermore, at that time in my life I did not know what a
cocktail was.  I remember, when my first book was published,
several Alaskans, who were members of the Bohemian Club,
entertained me one evening at the club in San Francisco.  We sat
in most wonderful leather chairs, and drinks were ordered.  Never
had I heard such an ordering of liqueurs and of highballs of
particular brands of Scotch.  I didn't know what a liqueur or a
highball was, and I didn't know that "Scotch" meant whisky.  I
knew only poor men's drinks, the drinks of the frontier and of
sailor-town--cheap beer and cheaper whisky that was just called
whisky and nothing else.  I was embarrassed to make a choice, and
the steward nearly collapsed when I ordered claret as an after-
dinner drink.
