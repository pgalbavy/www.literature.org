<p>Although Jethro Juggens was not in the slightest danger of molestation
by the Shawanoes from the moment he emerged from the cabin and
started across the clearing, he was not to escape all danger and
a great scare.</p>

<p>He chafed at the binding of the linen armor about his ankles.
He was impatient to walk faster, and could not do so in that situation.
His strength was great, but a Hercules could not have overcome
the obstacle without loosening it. Glancing to the right and left
and on all sides, and seeing nothing threatening, he decided to
end the intolerable annoyance in the only way possible. He therefore
stopped short and stooped over to loosen the bandages.</p>

<p>But lo! it was impossible. His body was so confined that he could
only make a slight inclination. The hands, which were partly covered,
would not reach further than a point just above his knees.</p>

<p>"I' clar to gracious!" exclaimed the alarmed Jethro, straightening
up like a jack-knife, "I's committed sooicide. I'll nebber be
able to get my feet free. I'll hab to lib dis way de rest ob my
life, and dat won't be berry long."</p>

<p>But the first shock over, the truth gradually dawned upon him
that inasmuch as he had wound himself up, he must possess the
ability to unwind himself. All he had to do was to begin at the
upper instead of the lower part of his body.</p>

<p>"Qu'ar I didn't tink ob dat," he said, with a chuckle at his
own fright.</p>

<p>It was the work of but a few minutes to unwrap his body and limbs,
when he kicked his feet free, and "Richard was himself again."
By that time, however, he had entirely freed himself from the
sheets, which he flung over his left arm, while he held his heavy
gun in his right.</p>

<p>"What's de use ob smotherin' myself to def," he muttered. "Dar
ain't no Injuns 'round, and dar won't be&mdash;gracious hebben."</p>

<p>From the edge of the wood, barely fifty feet away, a dark object
issued and advanced straight upon him.</p>

<p>"Dat's de Panther! I knows him by his face; he wants to git eben
wid me 'cause I wouldn't 'low him to stick his foot in my mouf."</p>

<p>Forgetful of the effective weapon he had in his hand, Jethro
made a dash for the flatboat, his nearest refuge, and forgetful,
too, of the voluminous folds over his arm, he tangled the lower
ends about his feet and sprawled headlong to the ground. This
completed the panic, and letting go of his rifle, he rolled over
on his back and made desperate efforts to gather the mass of linen
over his face and body, so as to protect him against bullet and
knife and tomahawk, somewhat as a child covers its head at night
to escape imaginary terrors.</p>

<p>There was so much of the stuff that the armoring of his head
and limbs was quite effective, but his feet were left wholly unprotected.
The only recourse left was to kick, which he proceeded to do with
a vigor that would have sent any man flying had he come within
reach of the whirring pedals.</p>

<p>When this had continued until Jethro was tired, he concluded
that the demonstration had frightened off his enemy. Dropping
his feet on the ground, he drew the covering of his face sufficiently
to one side to permit him to peep forth. Seeing nothing, he ventured
to raise his head a little higher and to look around.</p>

<p>The dark object that had thrown him into the panic was just disappearing
from sight in the direction of the wood whence it came. There
was enough moonlight at that moment for him to identify it.</p>

<p>"By gracious! it am a bar! I done forgot dat I had my loaded
gun and could hab drapped him easy. If any ob de folks had come
'long while I lay on my back kickin' at de sky, dey would hab
tought I had a bone in my froat and didn't know what to do wid
it."</p>

<p>In all probability the bear, when he first appeared, intended
to make an investigation, but the sight of a figure, smothered
in sheets and with his feet thrumming in the air like a couple
of drum sticks, must have frightened bruin into leaving the strange
animal alone.</p>

<p>Jethro was disposed to make chase after the animal and bring
him to account, but reflection showed the unwisdom of allowing
any diversion to interfere with the plain dictates of duty.</p>

<p>"Dar's no tellin' what trouble Mr. Kenton may hab tumbled into
widout habin' me dar to pull him out. De rest ob de folks don't
know how to shoot Injuns half as well as me."</p>

<p>It was evident the youth felt quite proud of his exploits, and
who can blame him? He surely had warrant for his pride. He had
decided to pay a visit to the flatboat even though time was so
urgent. It lay close against the bank, just as it had been left
earlier in the day, after the cargo was removed. Abandoning it
before a chance was given to break it up, and with the vague hope
that they might be permitted to turn it to account some time in
the future, the pioneers offered it no harm, nor was it injured
by the Indians who, later, came upon the scene.</p>

<p>Jethro stepped over the heavy gunwale and looked about him with
peculiar interest, for, as is well known, that craft was the scene
of many stirring incidents during the preceding twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>There was the long sweeping oar, balanced on a pivot at either
end, with the handle reaching almost to the middle of the boat.
That portion considered the stern (although in no respect did
it differ from the bow) had the covered space, used as sleeping
quarters for the females. At the other end was where the cooking
was done.</p>

<p>In the bottom lay the two long poles to be used in controlling
the boat when necessary, and, groping about, Jethro noticed the
pieces of rope that had served to bind The Panther, and which
no one had deemed valuable enough to be removed. Other pieces
of board and a few fragments of articles were scattered around,
but none was of any account. Jethro flung down his big armful
of linen at the bow, and, sitting upon them, gave himself over
to characteristic meditation.</p>

<p>There is no intellect so dull through which some bright thought
does not now and then flash. It may come and go too quickly to
be turned to account, but, all the same, it is that mystic throb
which proves that all human souls are beating in unison with the
divinity that created them.</p>

<p>Sitting thus at the prow of the flatboat, meditating upon the
strange occurrences through which he had passed since leaving
his old home in Virginia, a scheme gradually assumed definite
form in the brain of Jethro Juggens, whose brilliancy and originality
startled even himself.</p>

<p>And yet, when it comes to be analyzed, there was really nothing
startling and brilliant in it. The wonder would have been, if
any person, with a modicum of sense, could have held his place
under similar circumstances and not thought of that which gradually
worked its way into his consciousness.</p>

<p>There were the poles used in handling the flatboat; there were
bits of rope scattered about the bottom of the craft. He was sitting
upon almost half a score of tough, thin sheets of linen; he was
the possessor of a sharp knife and was dextrous in its use; and
the wind was blowing almost a gale from the west, and therefore
directly up stream; why not sail the flatboat up the Ohio?</p>

<p>This was the question which at first held the youth breathless
with the very grandeur and magnitude of the scheme; but, as fully
considered, it became simple and more practical.</p>

<p>Jethro was far from suspecting the real use to which his scheme
could be possibly put. He knew and suspected nothing of the desperate
straits in which his friends were placed at that very hour. He
had an altogether different project in view.</p>

<p>"Dey're pickin' dar way frough de woods, whar it's dark, and
habing all sorts ob trouble. Dey can't see tings, and dat makes
it wusser; de one dat's walkin' at de head will be sartin to hab
a limb cotch him under his chin and raise him off his feet; den
he'll feel like sw'aring, but will be afeared to do so, 'cause
de heathen might oberhear him and stop him, and make him explanify
de meanin' of his discumvations.</p>

<p>"De tramp wouldn't be much if de sun war shinin' so dat dey could
walk long widout steppin' on snakes. When dey see me come sailin'
up de ribber, why, dey will be so pleased dat Mr. Altman won't&mdash;dat
is, he won't obsist on my workin' so hard, and Mrs. Altman won't
frow out so many digustin' hints 'bout de bigness ob my appertite."</p>

<p>Having labored up to his decision, Jethro Juggens threw away
no time in carrying it out. It really seemed as if everything
had been directed for the last hour or two to prepare this very
course to him. The failure of the wooden box to serve him as an
armor, and the resort to the sheets of linen, the turning of his
steps toward the flatboat, and, above all, that strong, steadily-blowing
west wind&mdash;many persons would have seen something more than a
mere coincidence in these things, and who shall say that this
view would not have been right?</p>

<p>The task that presented itself to Jethro Juggens, though a hard
one, was by no means impossible. His keen-edged knife soon fashioned
excavations in the soft planking at the sides, through which he
passed some of the pieces of rope and fastened one of the poles
in an upright position, or nearly so, for he was wise enough to
place it so that it leaned backward like the masts of ordinary
sailing vessels. He secured this as strongly as he could, and
then did the same with the second pole on the other side, and
directly opposite the first.</p>

<p>He had now two strong uprights or masts. He examined and tested
them until certain that nothing more could be done to add to their
firmness. Then he set to work to knot or tie a number of the sheets
together at the corners, until a sail was fashioned of the right
dimensions, and this, in turn, was secured to the masts.</p>

<p>He went about the business with that deliberation and care which
marks the skilled workman. Almost any one, placed as he was, would
have been hasty, nervous and unfitted to do a good job. It would
have been neglected at some point, and, consequently, disaster
would have come at the beginning of the enterprise. Jethro wrought
as though such a thing as danger was not within a hundred miles,
and that, too, when he had recently passed through some terrifying
incidents.</p>

<p>When the work was completed, he had a sail containing something
like fifty square feet, the sheets secured together with no little
skill, and the masts so strongly set that they could be relied
upon, unless some unusual cause interfered with them. The only
probable contingency to cause misgiving was the wind.</p>

<p>That would not always blow from the west, and it might cease
within an hour, or even less time.</p>

<p>"It may get contrary," reflected Jethro, "and turn de oder way;
if dat am de case, dis old boat will go kitin' down de Ohio till
we strike de Massissip&mdash;and den &mdash;I done forgot what dat
riber runs into, but if I discomember incorrectly, it am de Red
Sea; don't want to go dar, so I'll jump ober board, if I can't
stop de boat, and take to de woods.</p>

<p>"Mebbe de gale will twist 'round and come from de souf; under
dem sarcummentions de boat'll bang in 'mong de trees and smash
tings. If Mr. Kenton had managed to got 'long when I ain't wid
him, and Mr. Boone don't fall down and hurt hisself, why dem two
might got de Injins togeder and hold dem on de Kentucky shore,
while I run ober' em wid de flatboat.</p>

<p>"Dat would gib' em such a good squshin' dat dey wouldn't bother
us for a good while. It happens, howsumeber, just now dat de wind
am blowin' right, and we kin sail up de Ohio as fur as we want,
dat is," qualified Jethro, "if we don't want to go furder dan
de wind will took us&mdash;but why don't the old ting start?"</p>

<p>The sail was spread, and the strong gale was impinging dead against
it, and yet, strange to say, the flatboat remained as motionless
as if sunk at the bottom of the river.</p>
