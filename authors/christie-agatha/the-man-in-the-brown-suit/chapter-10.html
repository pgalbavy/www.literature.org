<p>I was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right
trail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the
cabin. The asafœtida had got to be borne. I examined my facts
again.
</p>
<p>To-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would
happen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o’clock. In six hours
I should know.
</p><p>I don’t know how I got through the evening. I retired to my cabin
fairly early. I had told the stewardess that I had a cold in the
head and didn’t mind smells. She still seemed distressed, but I
was firm.
</p><p>The evening seemed interminable. I duly retired to bed, but in view
of emergencies I swathed myself in a thick flannel dressing-gown,
and encased my feet in slippers. Thus attired I felt that I could
spring up and take an active part in anything that happened.
</p><p>What did I expect to happen? I hardly knew. Vague fancies, most of
them wildly improbable, flitted through my brain. But one thing I
was firmly convinced of, at one o’clock <u>something</u> would happen.
</p><p>At various times, I heard my fellow-passengers coming to bed.
Fragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through
the open transom. Then, silence. Most of the lights went out. There
was still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a
certain amount of light in my cabin. I heard eight bells go. The
hour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known. I consulted
my watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot the time.
</p><p>If my deductions were wrong, if nothing happened at one o’clock,
I should have made a fool of myself, and spent all the money I had
in the world on a mare’s-nest. My heart beat painfully.
</p><p>Two bells went overhead. One o’clock! And nothing. Wait—what was
that? I heard the quick light patter of feet running—running along
the passage.
</p><p>Then with the suddenness of a bombshell my cabin door burst open
and a man almost fell inside.
</p><p>“Save me,” he said hoarsely. “They’re after me.”
</p><p>It was not a moment for argument or explanation. I could hear
footsteps outside. I had about forty seconds in which to act. I
had sprung to my feet and was standing facing the stranger in the
middle of the cabin.
</p><p>A cabin does not abound in hiding-places for a six-foot man. With
one arm I pulled out my cabin trunk. He slipped down behind it
under the bunk. I raised the lid. At the same time, with the other
hand I pulled down the wash-basin. A deft movement and my hair was
screwed into a tiny knot on the top of my head. From the point of
view of appearance it was inartistic, from another standpoint it
was supremely artistic. A lady, with her hair screwed into an
unbecoming knob and in the act of removing a piece of soap from
her trunk with which, apparently to wash her neck, could hardly be
suspected of harbouring a fugitive.
</p><p>There was a knock at the door, and without waiting for me to say,
“Come in,” it was pushed open.
</p><p>I don’t know what I expected to see. I think I had vague ideas of
Mr. Pagett brandishing a revolver. Or my missionary friend with a
sandbag, or some other lethal weapon. But certainly I did not
expect to see a night stewardess, with an inquiring face and
looking the essence of respectability.
</p><p>“I beg your pardon, miss, I thought you called out.”
</p><p>“No,” I said, “I didn’t.”
</p><p>“I’m sorry for interrupting you.”
</p><p>“That’s all right,” I said. “I couldn’t sleep. I thought a wash
would do me good.” It sounded rather as though it were a thing I
never had as a general rule.
</p><p>“I’m so sorry, miss,” said the stewardess again. “But there’s a
gentleman about who’s rather drunk, and we are afraid he might get
into one of the ladies’ cabins and frighten them.”
</p><p>“How dreadful,” I said, looking alarmed. “He won’t come in here,
will he?”
</p><p>“Oh, I don’t think so, miss. Ring the bell if he does. Good night.”
</p><p>“Good night.”
</p><p>I opened the door and peeped down the corridor. Except for the
retreating form of the stewardess, there was nobody in sight.
</p><p>Drunk! So that was the explanation of it. My histrionic talents
had been wasted. I pulled the cabin trunk out a little farther and
said:
</p><p>“Come out at once, please,” in an acid voice.
</p><p>There was no answer. I peered under the bunk. My visitor lay
immovable. He seemed to be asleep. I tugged at his shoulder. He
did not move.
</p><p>“Dead drunk,” I thought vexedly. “What <u>am</u> I to do?”
</p><p>Then I saw something that made me catch my breath, a small scarlet
spot on the floor.
</p><p>Using all my strength, I succeeded in dragging the man out into
the middle of the cabin. The dead whiteness of his face showed that
he had fainted. I found the cause of his fainting easily enough.
He had been stabbed under the left shoulder-blade—a nasty deep
wound. I got his coat off and set to work to attend to it.
</p><p>At the sting of the cold water he stirred, then sat up.
</p><p>“Keep still, please,” I said.
</p><p>He was the kind of young man who recovers his faculties very
quickly. He pulled himself to his feet and stood there swaying a
little.
</p><p>“Thank you, I don’t need anything done for me.”
</p><p>His manner was defiant, almost aggressive. Not a word of thanks—of
even common gratitude!
</p><p>“That is a nasty wound. You must let me dress it.”
</p><p>“You will do nothing of the kind.”
</p><p>He flung the words in my face as though I had been begging a favour
of him. My temper, never placid, rose.
</p><p>“I cannot congratulate you upon your manners,” I said coldly.
</p><p>“I can at least relieve you of my presence.” He started for the
door, but reeled as he did so. With an abrupt movement I pushed
him down upon the sofa.
</p><p>“Don’t be a fool,” I said unceremoniously. “You don’t want to go
bleeding all over the ship, do you?”
</p><p>He seemed to see the sense of that, for he sat quietly whilst I
bandaged up the wound as best I could.
</p><p>“There,” I said, bestowing a pat on my handiwork, “that will have
to do for the present. Are you better tempered now and do you feel
inclined to tell me what it’s all about?”
</p><p>“I’m sorry that I can’t satisfy your very natural curiosity.”
</p><p>“Why not?” I said, chagrined.
</p><p>He smiled nastily.
</p><p>“If you want a thing broadcasted, tell a woman. Otherwise keep your
mouth shut.”
</p><p>“Don’t you think I could keep a secret?”
</p><p>“I don’t think—I know.”
</p><p>He rose to his feet.
</p><p>“At any rate,” I said spitefully, “I shall be able to do a little
broadcasting about the events of this evening.”
</p><p>“I’ve no doubt you will too,” he said indifferently.
</p><p>“How dare you?” I cried angrily.
</p><p>We were facing each other, glaring at each other with the ferocity
of bitter enemies. For the first time, I took in the details of
his appearance, the close-cropped dark head, the lean jaw, the scar
on the brown cheek, the curious light grey eyes that looked into
mine with a sort of reckless mockery hard to describe. There was
something dangerous about him.
</p><p>“You haven’t thanked me yet for saving your life?” I said with
false sweetness.
</p><p>I hit him there. I saw him flinch distinctly. Intuitively I knew
that he hated above all to be reminded that he owed his life to
me. I didn’t care. I wanted to hurt him. I had never wanted to hurt
any one so much.
</p><p>“I wish to God you hadn’t!” he said explosively. “I’d be better
dead and out of it.”
</p><p>“I’m glad you acknowledge the debt. You can’t get out of it. I
saved your life and I’m waiting for you to say ‘Thank you.’”
</p><p>If looks could have killed, I think he would have liked to kill me
then. He pushed roughly past me. At the door he turned back, and
spoke over his shoulder.
</p><p>“I shall not thank you—now or at any other time. But I acknowledge
the debt. Some day I will pay it.”
</p><p>He was gone, leaving me with clenched hands, and my heart beating
like a mill race.
