<p>The trader accustomed to the manners of Eastern Polynesia has a lesson to
learn among the Gilberts.  The <u>ridi</u> is but a spare attire; as late as
thirty years back the women went naked until marriage; within ten years
the custom lingered; and these facts, above all when heard in
description, conveyed a very false idea of the manners of the group.  A
very intelligent missionary described it (in its former state) as a
‘Paradise of naked women’ for the resident whites.  It was at least a
platonic Paradise, where Lothario ventured at his peril.  Since 1860,
fourteen whites have perished on a single island, all for the same cause,
all found where they had no business, and speared by some indignant
father of a family; the figure was given me by one of their
contemporaries who had been more prudent and survived.  The strange
persistence of these fourteen martyrs might seem to point to monomania or
a series of romantic passions; gin is the more likely key.  The poor
buzzards sat alone in their houses by an open case; they drank; their
brain was fired; they stumbled towards the nearest houses on chance; and
the dart went through their liver.  In place of a Paradise the trader
found an archipelago of fierce husbands and of virtuous women.  ‘Of
course if you wish to make love to them, it’s the same as anywhere else,’
observed a trader innocently; but he and his companions rarely so choose.
</p>
<p>The trader must be credited with a virtue: he often makes a kind and
loyal husband.  Some of the worst beachcombers in the Pacific, some of
the last of the old school, have fallen in my path, and some of them were
admirable to their native wives, and one made a despairing widower.  The
position of a trader’s wife in the Gilberts is, besides, unusually
enviable.  She shares the immunities of her husband.  Curfew in
Butaritari sounds for her in vain.  Long after the bell is rung and the
great island ladies are confined for the night to their own roof, this
chartered libertine may scamper and giggle through the deserted streets
or go down to bathe in the dark.  The resources of the store are at her
hand; she goes arrayed like a queen, and feasts delicately everyday upon
tinned meats.  And she who was perhaps of no regard or station among
natives sits with captains, and is entertained on board of schooners.
Five of these privileged dames were some time our neighbours.  Four were
handsome skittish lasses, gamesome like children, and like children
liable to fits of pouting.  They wore dresses by day, but there was a
tendency after dark to strip these lendings and to career and squall
about the compound in the aboriginal <u>ridi</u>.  Games of cards were
continually played, with shells for counters; their course was much
marred by cheating; and the end of a round (above all if a man was of the
party) resolved itself into a scrimmage for the counters.  The fifth was
a matron.  It was a picture to see her sail to church on a Sunday, a
parasol in hand, a nursemaid following, and the baby buried in a trade
hat and armed with a patent feeding-bottle.  The service was enlivened by
her continual supervision and correction of the maid.  It was impossible
not to fancy the baby was a doll, and the church some European playroom.
All these women were legitimately married.  It is true that the
certificate of one, when she proudly showed it, proved to run thus, that
she was ‘married for one night,’ and her gracious partner was at liberty
to ‘send her to hell’ the next morning; but she was none the wiser or the
worse for the dastardly trick.  Another, I heard, was married on a work
of mine in a pirated edition; it answered the purpose as well as a Hall
Bible.  Notwithstanding all these allurements of social distinction, rare
food and raiment, a comparative vacation from toil, and legitimate
marriage contracted on a pirated edition, the trader must sometimes seek
long before he can be mated.  While I was in the group one had been eight
months on the quest, and he was still a bachelor.
</p><p>Within strictly native society the old laws and practices were harsh, but
not without a certain stamp of high-mindedness.  Stealthy adultery was
punished with death; open elopement was properly considered virtue in
comparison, and compounded for a fine in land.  The male adulterer alone
seems to have been punished.  It is correct manners for a jealous man to
hang himself; a jealous woman has a different remedy—she bites her rival.
Ten or twenty years ago it was a capital offence to raise a woman’s
<u>ridi</u>; to this day it is still punished with a heavy fine; and the
garment itself is still symbolically sacred.  Suppose a piece of land to
be disputed in Butaritari, the claimant who shall first hang a <u>ridi</u> on
the tapu-post has gained his cause, since no one can remove or touch it
but himself.
</p><p>The <u>ridi</u> was the badge not of the woman but the wife, the mark not of
her sex but of her station.  It was the collar on the slave’s neck, the
brand on merchandise.  The adulterous woman seems to have been spared;
were the husband offended, it would be a poor consolation to send his
draught cattle to the shambles.  Karaiti, to this day, calls his eight
wives ‘his horses,’ some trader having explained to him the employment of
these animals on farms; and Nanteitei hired out his wives to do
mason-work.  Husbands, at least when of high rank, had the power of life
and death; even whites seem to have possessed it; and their wives, when
they had transgressed beyond forgiveness, made haste to pronounce the
formula of deprecation—<u>I Kana Kim</u>.  This form of words had so much
virtue that a condemned criminal repeating it on a particular day to the
king who had condemned him, must be instantly released.  It is an offer
of abasement, and, strangely enough, the reverse—the imitation—is a
common vulgar insult in Great Britain to this day.  I give a scene
between a trader and his Gilbert Island wife, as it was told me by the
husband, now one of the oldest residents, but then a freshman in the
group.
</p><p>‘Go and light a fire,’ said the trader, ‘and when I have brought this oil
I will cook some fish.’  The woman grunted at him, island fashion.  ‘I am
not a pig that you should grunt at me,’ said he.
</p><p>‘I know you are not a pig,’ said the woman, ‘neither am I your slave.’
</p><p>‘To be sure you are not my slave, and if you do not care to stop with me,
you had better go home to your people,’ said he.  ‘But in the mean time
go and light the fire; and when I have brought this oil I will cook some
fish.’
</p><p>She went as if to obey; and presently when the trader looked she had
built a fire so big that the cook-house was catching in flames.
</p><p>‘<u>I Kana Kim</u>!’ she cried, as she saw him coming; but he recked not, and
hit her with a cooking-pot.  The leg pierced her skull, blood spouted, it
was thought she was a dead woman, and the natives surrounded the house in
a menacing expectation.  Another white was present, a man of older
experience.  ‘You will have us both killed if you go on like this,’ he
cried.  ‘She had said <u>I Kana Kim</u>!’  If she had not said <u>I Kana Kim</u> he
might have struck her with a caldron.  It was not the blow that made the
crime, but the disregard of an accepted formula.
</p><p>Polygamy, the particular sacredness of wives, their semi-servile state,
their seclusion in kings’ harems, even their privilege of biting, all
would seem to indicate a Mohammedan society and the opinion of the
soullessness of woman.  And not so in the least.  It is a mere
appearance.  After you have studied these extremes in one house, you may
go to the next and find all reversed, the woman the mistress, the man
only the first of her thralls.  The authority is not with the husband as
such, nor the wife as such.  It resides in the chief or the chief-woman;
in him or her who has inherited the lands of the clan, and stands to the
clansman in the place of parent, exacting their service, answerable for
their fines.  There is but the one source of power and the one ground of
dignity—rank.  The king married a chief-woman; she became his menial, and
must work with her hands on Messrs. Wightman’s pier.  The king divorced
her; she regained at once her former state and power.  She married the
Hawaiian sailor, and behold the man is her flunkey and can be shown the
door at pleasure.  Nay, and such low-born lords are even corrected
physically, and, like grown but dutiful children, must endure the
discipline.
</p><p>We were intimate in one such household, that of Nei Takauti and Nan Tok’;
I put the lady first of necessity.  During one week of fool’s paradise,
Mrs. Stevenson had gone alone to the sea-side of the island after shells.
I am very sure the proceeding was unsafe; and she soon perceived a man
and woman watching her.  Do what she would, her guardians held her
steadily in view; and when the afternoon began to fall, and they thought
she had stayed long enough, took her in charge, and by signs and broken
English ordered her home.  On the way the lady drew from her earring-hole
a clay pipe, the husband lighted it, and it was handed to my unfortunate
wife, who knew not how to refuse the incommodious favour; and when they
were all come to our house, the pair sat down beside her on the floor,
and improved the occasion with prayer.  From that day they were our
family friends; bringing thrice a day the beautiful island garlands of
white flowers, visiting us any evening, and frequently carrying us down
to their own maniap’ in return, the woman leading Mrs. Stevenson by the
hand like one child with another.
</p><p>Nan Tok’, the husband, was young, extremely handsome, of the most
approved good humour, and suffering in his precarious station from
suppressed high spirits.  Nei Takauti, the wife, was getting old; her
grown son by a former marriage had just hanged himself before his
mother’s eyes in despair at a well-merited rebuke.  Perhaps she had never
been beautiful, but her face was full of character, her eye of sombre
fire.  She was a high chief-woman, but by a strange exception for a
person of her rank, was small, spare, and sinewy, with lean small hands
and corded neck.  Her full dress of an evening was invariably a white
chemise—and for adornment, green leaves (or sometimes white blossoms)
stuck in her hair and thrust through her huge earring-holes.  The husband
on the contrary changed to view like a kaleidoscope.  Whatever pretty
thing my wife might have given to Nei Takauti—a string of beads, a
ribbon, a piece of bright fabric—appeared the next evening on the person
of Nan Tok’.  It was plain he was a clothes-horse; that he wore livery;
that, in a word, he was his wife’s wife.  They reversed the parts indeed,
down to the least particular; it was the husband who showed himself the
ministering angel in the hour of pain, while the wife displayed the
apathy and heartlessness of the proverbial man.
</p><p>When Nei Takauti had a headache Nan Tok’ was full of attention and
concern.  When the husband had a cold and a racking toothache the wife
heeded not, except to jeer.  It is always the woman’s part to fill and
light the pipe; Nei Takauti handed hers in silence to the wedded page;
but she carried it herself, as though the page were not entirely trusted.
Thus she kept the money, but it was he who ran the errands, anxiously
sedulous.  A cloud on her face dimmed instantly his beaming looks; on an
early visit to their maniap’ my wife saw he had cause to be wary.  Nan
Tok’ had a friend with him, a giddy young thing, of his own age and sex;
and they had worked themselves into that stage of jocularity when
consequences are too often disregarded.  Nei Takauti mentioned her own
name.  Instantly Nan Tok’ held up two fingers, his friend did likewise,
both in an ecstasy of slyness.  It was plain the lady had two names; and
from the nature of their merriment, and the wrath that gathered on her
brow, there must be something ticklish in the second.  The husband
pronounced it; a well-directed cocoa-nut from the hand of his wife caught
him on the side of the head, and the voices and the mirth of these
indiscreet young gentlemen ceased for the day.
</p><p>The people of Eastern Polynesia are never at a loss; their etiquette is
absolute and plenary; in every circumstance it tells them what to do and
how to do it.  The Gilbertines are seemingly more free, and pay for their
freedom (like ourselves) in frequent perplexity.  This was often the case
with the topsy-turvy couple.  We had once supplied them during a visit
with a pipe and tobacco; and when they had smoked and were about to
leave, they found themselves confronted with a problem: should they take
or leave what remained of the tobacco?  The piece of plug was taken up,
it was laid down again, it was handed back and forth, and argued over,
till the wife began to look haggard and the husband elderly.  They ended
by taking it, and I wager were not yet clear of the compound before they
were sure they had decided wrong.  Another time they had been given each
a liberal cup of coffee, and Nan Tok’ with difficulty and disaffection
made an end of his.  Nei Takauti had taken some, she had no mind for
more, plainly conceived it would be a breach of manners to set down the
cup unfinished, and ordered her wedded retainer to dispose of what was
left.  ‘I have swallowed all I can, I cannot swallow more, it is a
physical impossibility,’ he seemed to say; and his stern officer
reiterated her commands with secret imperative signals.  Luckless dog!
but in mere humanity we came to the rescue and removed the cup.
</p><p>I cannot but smile over this funny household; yet I remember the good
souls with affection and respect.  Their attention to ourselves was
surprising.  The garlands are much esteemed, the blossoms must be sought
far and wide; and though they had many retainers to call to their aid, we
often saw themselves passing afield after the blossoms, and the wife
engaged with her own in putting them together.  It was no want of only
that disregard so incident to husbands, that made Nei Takauti despise the
sufferings of Nan Tok’.  When my wife was unwell she proved a diligent
and kindly nurse; and the pair, to the extreme embarrassment of the
sufferer, became fixtures in the sick-room.  This rugged, capable,
imperious old dame, with the wild eyes, had deep and tender qualities:
her pride in her young husband it seemed that she dissembled, fearing
possibly to spoil him; and when she spoke of her dead son there came
something tragic in her face.  But I seemed to trace in the Gilbertines a
virility of sense and sentiment which distinguishes them (like their
harsh and uncouth language) from their brother islanders in the east.
