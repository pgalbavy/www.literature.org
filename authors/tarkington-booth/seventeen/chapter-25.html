<p>As a hurried worldling, in almost perfectly fitting evening clothes,
passed out of his father's gateway and hurried toward the place
whence faintly came the sound of dance-music, a child's voice
called sweetly from an unidentified window of the darkened house
behind him:</p>

<p>"Well, <em>ANYWAY, </em>you try and have a good time, Willie!"</p>

<p>William made no reply; he paused not in his stride. Jane's farewell
injunction, though obviously not ill-intended, seemed in poor
taste, and a reply might have encouraged her to believe that,
in some measure at least, he condescended to discuss his inner
life with her. He departed rapidly, but with hauteur. The moon
was up, but shade-trees were thick along the sidewalk, and the
hauteur was invisible to any human eye; nevertheless, William
considered it necessary.</p>

<p>Jane's friendly but ill-chosen "<em>ANYWAY" </em>had touched
doubts already annoying him. He was certain to be late to the
party&mdash;so late, indeed, that it might prove difficult to obtain
a proper number of dances with the sacred girl in whose honor
the celebration was being held. Too many were steeped in a sense
of her sacredness, well he wot! and he was unable to find room
in his apprehensive mind for any doubt that these others would
be accursedly diligent.</p>

<p>But as he hastened onward his spirits rose, and he did reply
to Jane, after all, though he had placed a hundred yards between
them.</p>

<p>"Yes, and you can bet your bottom dollar I will, too!" he muttered,
between his determined teeth.</p>

<p>The very utterance of the words increased the firmness of his
decision, and at the same time cheered him. His apprehensions
fell away, and a glamorous excitement took their place, as he
turned a corner and the music burst more loudly upon his tingling
ear. For there, not half-way to the next street, the fairy scene
lay spread before him.</p>

<p>Spellbound groups of uninvited persons, most of them colored,
rested their forearms upon the upper rail of the Parchers' picket
fence, offering to William's view a silhouette like that of a
crowd at a fire. Beyond the fence, bright forms went skimming,
shimmering, wavering over a white platform, while high overhead
the young moon sprayed a thinner light down through the maple
leaves, to where processions of rosy globes hung floating in the
blue night. The mild breeze trembled to the silver patterings
of a harp, to the sweet, barbaric chirping of plucked strings
of violin and 'cello&mdash;and swooned among the maple leaves to the
rhythmic crooning of a flute. And, all the while, from the platform
came the sounds of little cries in girlish voices, and the cadenced
shuffling of young feet, where the witching dancemusic had its
way, as ever and forever, with big and little slippers.</p>

<p>The heart of William had behaved tumultuously the summer long,
whenever his eyes beheld those pickets of the Parchers' fence,
but now it outdid all its previous riotings. He was forced to
open his mouth and gasp for breath, so deep was his draught of
that young wine, romance. Yonder&mdash;somewhere in the breath-taking
radiance&mdash;danced his Queen with all her Court about her. Queen
and Court, thought William, and nothing less exorbitant could
have expressed his feeling. For seventeen needs only some paper
lanterns, a fiddle, and a pretty girl&mdash;and Versailles is all there!</p>

<p>The moment was so rich that William crossed the street with a
slower step. His mood changed: an exaltation had come upon him,
though he was never for an instant unaware of the tragedy beneath
all this worldly show and glamor. It was the last night of the
divine visit; to-morrow the town would lie desolate, a hollow
shell in the dust, without her. Miss Pratt would be gone&mdash;gone
utterly&mdash;gone away on the <em>TRAIN! </em>But to-night was just
beginning, and to-night he would dance with her; he would dance
and dance with her&mdash;he would dance and dance like mad! He and
she, poetic and fated pair, would dance on and on! They would
be intoxicated by the lights&mdash;the lights, the flowers, and the
music. Nay, the flowers might droop, the lights might go out,
the music cease and dawn come&mdash;she and he would dance recklessly
on&mdash;on&mdash;on!</p>

<p>A sense of picturesqueness&mdash;his own picturesqueness&mdash;made him
walk rather theatrically as he passed through the groups of humble
onlookers outside the picket fence. Many of these turned to stare
at the belated guest, and William was unconscious of neither their
low estate nor his own quality as a patrician man-about-town in
almost perfectly fitting evening dress. A faint, cold smile was
allowed to appear upon his lips, and a fragment from a story he
had read came momentarily to his mind.... "Through the gaping
crowds the young Augustan noble was borne down from the Palatine,
scornful in his jeweled litter...."</p>

<p>An admiring murmur reached William's ear.</p>

<p>"OH, oh, honey! Look attem long-tail suit! 'At's a rich boy,
honey!"</p>

<p>"Yessum, SO! Bet he got his pockets pack' full o' twenty-dolluh
gol' pieces right iss minute!"</p>

<p>"You right, honey!"</p>

<p>William allowed the coldness of his faint smile to increase to
become scornful. These poor sidewalk creatures little knew what
seethed inside the alabaster of the young Augustan noble! What
was it to <em>THEM </em>that this was Miss Pratt's last night
and that he intended to dance and dance with her, on and on?</p>

<p>Almost sternly he left these squalid lives behind him and passed
to the festal gateway.</p>

<p>Upon one of the posts of that gateway there rested the elbow
of a contemplative man, middleaged or a little worse. Of all persons
having pleasure or business within the bright inclosure, he was,
that evening, the least important; being merely the background
parent who paid the bills. However, even this unconsidered elder
shared a thought in common with the Augustan now approaching:
Mr. Parcher had just been thinking that there was true romance
in the scene before him.</p>

<p>But what Mr. Parcher contemplated as romance arose from the fact
that these young people were dancing on a spot where their great-grandfathers
had scalped Indians. Music was made for them by descendants, it
might well be, of Romulus, of Messalina, of Benvenuto Cellini,
and, around behind the house, waiting to serve the dancers with
light food and drink, lounged and gossiped grandchildren of the
Congo, only a generation or so removed from dances for which a
chance stranger furnished both the occasion and the refreshments.
Such, in brief, was Mr. Parcher's peculiar view of what constituted
the romantic element.</p>

<p>And upon another subject preoccupying both Mr. Parcher and William,
their two views, though again founded upon one thought, had no
real congeniality. The preoccupying subject was the imminence
of Miss Pratt's departure;&mdash;neither Mr. Parcher nor William forgot
it for an instant. No matter what else played upon the surface
of their attention, each kept saying to himself, underneath: "This
is the last night&mdash;the last night! Miss Pratt is going away&mdash;going
away to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Mr. Parcher's expression was peaceful. It was more peaceful than
it had been for a long time. In fact, he wore the look of a man
who had been through the mill but now contemplated a restful and
health-restoring vacation. For there are people in this world
who have no respect for the memory of Ponce de Leon, and Mr. Parcher
had come to be of their number. The elimination of William from
his evenings had lightened the burden; nevertheless, Mr. Parcher
would have stated freely and openly to any responsible party that
a yearning for the renewal of his youth had not been intensified
by his daughter's having as a visitor, all summer long, a howling
belle of eighteen who talked baby-talk even at breakfast and spread
her suitors all over the small house&mdash;and its one veranda&mdash;from
eight in the morning until hours of the night long after their
mothers (in Mr. Parcher's opinion) should have sent their fathers
to march them home. Upon Mr. Parcher's optimism the effect of
so much unavoidable observation of young love had been fatal;
he declared repeatedly that his faith in the human race was about
gone. Furthermore, his physical constitution had proved pathetically
vulnerable to nightly quartets, quintets, and even octets, on
the porch below his bedchamber window, so that he was wont to
tell his wife that never, never could he expect to be again the
man he had been in the spring before Miss Pratt came to visit
May. And, referring to conversations which he almost continuously
overheard, perforce, Mr. Parcher said that if this was the way
HE talked at that age, he would far prefer to drown in an ordinary
fountain, and be dead and done with it, than to bathe in Ponce
de Leon's.</p>

<p>Altogether, the summer had been a severe one; he doubted that
he could have survived much more of it. And now that it was virtually
over, at last, he was so resigned to the departure of his daughter's
lovely little friend that he felt no regret for the splurge with
which her visit was closing. Nay, to speed the parting guest&mdash;such
was his lavish mood&mdash;twice and thrice over would he have paid
for the lights, the flowers, the music, the sandwiches, the coffee,
the chicken salad, the cake, the lemonade-punch, and the ice-cream.</p>

<p>Thus did the one thought divide itself between William and Mr.
Parcher, keeping itself deep and pure under all their other thoughts.
"Miss Pratt is going away!" thought William and Mr. Parcher. "Miss
<em>PRATT </em>is going away&mdash;to-morrow!"</p>

<p>The unuttered words advanced tragically toward the gate in the
head of William at the same time that they moved contentedly away
in the head of Mr. Parcher; for Mr. Parcher caught sight of his
wife just then, and went to join her as she sank wearily upon
the front steps.</p>

<p>"Taking a rest for a minute?" he inquired. "By George! we're
both entitled to a good <em>LONG </em>rest, after to-night! If
we could afford it, we'd go away to a quiet little sanitarium
in the hills, somewhere, and&mdash;" He ceased to speak and there was
the renewal of an old bitterness in his expression as his staring
eyes followed the movements of a stately young form entering the
gateway. "Look at it!" said Mr. Parcher in a whisper. "Just look
at it!"</p>

<p>"Look at what?" asked his wife.</p>

<p>"That Baxter boy!" said Mr. Parcher, as William passed on toward
the dancers. "What's he think he's imitating &mdash;Henry Irving?
Look at his walk!"</p>

<p>"He walks that way a good deal, lately, I've noticed," said Mrs.
Parcher in a tired voice. "So do Joe Bullitt and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He didn't even come to say good evening to you," Mr. Parcher
interrupted. "Talk about <em>MANNERS, </em>nowadays! These young&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He didn't see us."</p>

<p>"Well, we're used to that," said Mr. Parcher. "None of 'em see
us. They've worn holes in all the cane-seated chairs, they've
scuffed up the whole house, and I haven't been able to sit down
anywhere down-stairs for three months without sitting on some
dam boy; but they don't even know we're alive! Well, thank the
Lord, it's over&mdash;after to-night!" His voice became reflective.
"That Baxter boy was the worst, until he took to coming in the
daytime when I was down-town. I <em>COULDN'T </em>have stood it
if he'd kept on coming in the evening. If I'd had to listen to
any more of his talking or singing, either the embalmer or the
lunatic-asylum would have had me, sure! I see he's got hold of
his daddy's dress-suit again for to-night."</p>

<p>"Is it Mr. Baxter's dress-suit?" Mrs. Parcher inquired. "How
do you know?"</p>

<p>Mr. Parcher smiled. "How I happen to know is a secret," he said.
"I forgot about that. His little sister, Jane, told me that Mrs.
Baxter had hidden it, or something, so that Willie couldn't wear
it, but I guess Jane wouldn't mind my telling <em>YOU </em>that
she told me especially as they're letting him use it again to-night.
I suppose he feels grander 'n the King o' Siam!"</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. Parcher returned, thoughtfully. "I don't think he
does, just now." Her gaze was fixed upon the dancing-platform,
which most of the dancers were abandoning as the music fell away
to an interval of silence. In the center of the platform there
remained one group, consisting of Miss Pratt and five orators,
and of the orators the most impassioned and gesticulative was
William.</p>

<p>"They all seem to want to dance with her all the time," said
Mrs. Parcher. "I heard her telling one of the boys, half an hour
ago, that all she could give him was either the twenty-eighth
regular dance or the sixteenth 'extra.'"</p>

<p>"The what?" Mr. Parcher demanded, whirling to face her. "Do they
think this party's going to keep running till day after to-morrow?"
And then, as his eyes returned to the group on the platform, "That
boy seems to have quite a touch of emotional insanity," he remarked,
referring to William. "What IS the matter with him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," his wife returned. "Only trying to arrange a dance
with her. He seems to be in difficulties."</p>
