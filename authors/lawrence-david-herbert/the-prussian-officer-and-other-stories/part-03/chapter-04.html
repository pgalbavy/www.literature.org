<p>A few days after, old Mr Durant died.  Miss Louisa saw Alfred once
more, but he was stiff before her now, treating her not like a
person, but as if she were some sort of will in command and he a
separate, distinct will waiting in front of her.  She had never
felt such utter steel-plate separation from anyone.  It puzzled her
and frightened her.  What had become of him?  And she hated the
military discipline - she was antagonistic to it.  Now he was not
himself.  He was the will which obeys set over against the will
which commands.  She hesitated over accepting this.  He had put
himself out of her range.  He had ranked himself inferior,
subordinate to her.  And that was how he would get away from her,
that was how he would avoid all connection with her: by fronting
her impersonally from the opposite camp, by taking up the abstract
position of an inferior.</p>

<p>She went brooding steadily and sullenly over this, brooding and
brooding.  Her fierce, obstinate heart could not give way.  It
clung to its own rights.  Sometimes she dismissed him.  Why should
he, inferior, trouble her?</p>

<p>Then she relapsed to him, and almost hated him.  It was his way of
getting out of it.  She felt the cowardice of it, his calmly
placing her in a superior class, and placing himself inaccessibly
apart, in an inferior, as if she, the sensient woman who was fond
of him, did not count.  But she was not going to submit.  Dogged in
her heart she held on to him.</p>
