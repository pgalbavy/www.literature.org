<p>In the early morning of 4th September a whale-boat manned by natives
dragged us down the green lane of the anchorage and round the spouting
promontory.  On the shore level it was a hot, breathless, and yet crystal
morning; but high overhead the hills of Atuona were all cowled in cloud,
and the ocean-river of the trades streamed without pause.  As we crawled
from under the immediate shelter of the land, we reached at last the
limit of their influence.  The wind fell upon our sails in puffs, which
strengthened and grew more continuous; presently the <u>Casco</u> heeled down
to her day’s work; the whale-boat, quite outstripped, clung for a noisy
moment to her quarter; the stipulated bread, rum, and tobacco were passed
in; a moment more and the boat was in our wake, and our late pilots were
cheering our departure.
</p>
<p>This was the more inspiriting as we were bound for scenes so different,
and though on a brief voyage, yet for a new province of creation.  That
wide field of ocean, called loosely the South Seas, extends from tropic
to tropic, and from perhaps 123 degrees W. to 150 degrees E., a
parallelogram of one hundred degrees by forty-seven, where degrees are
the most spacious.  Much of it lies vacant, much is closely sown with
isles, and the isles are of two sorts.  No distinction is so continually
dwelt upon in South Sea talk as that between the ‘low’ and the ‘high’
island, and there is none more broadly marked in nature.  The Himalayas
are not more different from the Sahara.  On the one hand, and chiefly in
groups of from eight to a dozen, volcanic islands rise above the sea; few
reach an altitude of less than 4000 feet; one exceeds 13,000; their tops
are often obscured in cloud, they are all clothed with various forests,
all abound in food, and are all remarkable for picturesque and solemn
scenery.  On the other hand, we have the atoll; a thing of problematic
origin and history, the reputed creature of an insect apparently
unidentified; rudely annular in shape; enclosing a lagoon; rarely
extending beyond a quarter of a mile at its chief width; often rising at
its highest point to less than the stature of a man—man himself, the rat
and the land crab, its chief inhabitants; not more variously supplied
with plants; and offering to the eye, even when perfect, only a ring of
glittering beach and verdant foliage, enclosing and enclosed by the blue
sea.
</p><p>In no quarter are the atolls so thickly congregated, in none are they so
varied in size from the greatest to the least, and in none is navigation
so beset with perils, as in that archipelago that we were now to thread.
The huge system of the trades is, for some reason, quite confounded by
this multiplicity of reefs, the wind intermits, squalls are frequent from
the west and south-west, hurricanes are known.  The currents are,
besides, inextricably intermixed; dead reckoning becomes a farce; the
charts are not to be trusted; and such is the number and similarity of
these islands that, even when you have picked one up, you may be none the
wiser.  The reputation of the place is consequently infamous; insurance
offices exclude it from their field, and it was not without misgiving
that my captain risked the <u>Casco</u> in such waters.  I believe, indeed, it
is almost understood that yachts are to avoid this baffling archipelago;
and it required all my instances—and all Mr. Otis’s private taste for
adventure—to deflect our course across its midst.
</p><p>For a few days we sailed with a steady trade, and a steady westerly
current setting us to leeward; and toward sundown of the seventh it was
supposed we should have sighted Takaroa, one of Cook’s so-called King
George Islands.  The sun set; yet a while longer the old
moon—semi-brilliant herself, and with a silver belly, which was her
successor—sailed among gathering clouds; she, too, deserted us; stars of
every degree of sheen, and clouds of every variety of form disputed the
sub-lustrous night; and still we gazed in vain for Takaroa.  The mate
stood on the bowsprit, his tall grey figure slashing up and down against
the stars, and still
</p><p>             ‘nihil astra praeter<br/>
    Vidit et undas.
</p><p>The rest of us were grouped at the port anchor davit, staring with no
less assiduity, but with far less hope on the obscure horizon.  Islands
we beheld in plenty, but they were of ‘such stuff as dreams are made on,’
and vanished at a wink, only to appear in other places; and by and by not
only islands, but refulgent and revolving lights began to stud the
darkness; lighthouses of the mind or of the wearied optic nerve, solemnly
shining and winking as we passed.  At length the mate himself despaired,
scrambled on board again from his unrestful perch, and announced that we
had missed our destination.  He was the only man of practice in these
waters, our sole pilot, shipped for that end at Tai-o-hae.  If he
declared we had missed Takaroa, it was not for us to quarrel with the
fact, but, if we could, to explain it.  We had certainly run down our
southing.  Our canted wake upon the sea and our somewhat drunken-looking
course upon the chart both testified with no less certainty to an
impetuous westward current.  We had no choice but to conclude we were
again set down to leeward; and the best we could do was to bring the
<u>Casco</u> to the wind, keep a good watch, and expect morning.
</p><p>I slept that night, as was then my somewhat dangerous practice, on deck
upon the cockpit bench.  A stir at last awoke me, to see all the eastern
heaven dyed with faint orange, the binnacle lamp already dulled against
the brightness of the day, and the steersman leaning eagerly across the
wheel.  ‘There it is, sir!’ he cried, and pointed in the very eyeball of
the dawn.  For awhile I could see nothing but the bluish ruins of the
morning bank, which lay far along the horizon, like melting icebergs.
Then the sun rose, pierced a gap in these <u>débris</u> of vapours, and
displayed an inconsiderable islet, flat as a plate upon the sea, and
spiked with palms of disproportioned altitude.
</p><p>So far, so good.  Here was certainly an atoll; and we were certainly got
among the archipelago.  But which?  And where?  The isle was too small
for either Takaroa: in all our neighbourhood, indeed, there was none so
inconsiderable, save only Tikei; and Tikei, one of Roggewein’s so-called
Pernicious Islands, seemed beside the question.  At that rate, instead of
drifting to the west, we must have fetched up thirty miles to windward.
And how about the current?  It had been setting us down, by observation,
all these days: by the deflection of our wake, it should be setting us
down that moment.  When had it stopped?  When had it begun again? and
what kind of torrent was that which had swept us eastward in the
interval?  To these questions, so typical of navigation in that range of
isles, I have no answer.  Such were at least the facts; Tikei our island
turned out to be; and it was our first experience of the dangerous
archipelago, to make our landfall thirty miles out.
</p><p>The sight of Tikei, thrown direct against the splendour of the morning,
robbed of all its colour, and deformed with disproportioned trees like
bristles on a broom, had scarce prepared us to be much in love with
atolls.  Later the same day we saw under more fit conditions the island
of Taiaro.  <u>Lost in the Sea</u> is possibly the meaning of the name.  And
it was so we saw it; lost in blue sea and sky: a ring of white beach,
green underwood, and tossing palms, gem-like in colour; of a fairy, of a
heavenly prettiness.  The surf ran all around it, white as snow, and
broke at one point, far to seaward, on what seems an uncharted reef.
There was no smoke, no sign of man; indeed, the isle is not inhabited,
only visited at intervals.  And yet a trader (Mr. Narii Salmon) was
watching from the shore and wondering at the unexpected ship.  I have
spent since then long months upon low islands; I know the tedium of their
undistinguished days; I know the burden of their diet.  With whatever
envy we may have looked from the deck on these green coverts, it was with
a tenfold greater that Mr. Salmon and his comrades saw us steer, in our
trim ship, to seaward.
</p><p>The night fell lovely in the extreme.  After the moon went down, the
heaven was a thing to wonder at for stars.  And as I lay in the cockpit
and looked upon the steersman I was haunted by Emerson’s verses:
</p><p>    ‘And the lone seaman all the night
    Sails astonished among stars.’
</p><p>By this glittering and imperfect brightness, about four bells in the
first watch we made our third atoll, Raraka.  The low line of the isle
lay straight along the sky; so that I was at first reminded of a towpath,
and we seemed to be mounting some engineered and navigable stream.
Presently a red star appeared, about the height and brightness of a
danger signal, and with that my simile was changed; we seemed rather to
skirt the embankment of a railway, and the eye began to look
instinctively for the telegraph-posts, and the ear to expect the coming
of a train.  Here and there, but rarely, faint tree-tops broke the level.
And the sound of the surf accompanied us, now in a drowsy monotone, now
with a menacing swing.
</p><p>The isle lay nearly east and west, barring our advance on Fakarava.  We
must, therefore, hug the coast until we gained the western end, where,
through a passage eight miles wide, we might sail southward between
Raraka and the next isle, Kauehi.  We had the wind free, a lightish air;
but clouds of an inky blackness were beginning to arise, and at times it
lightened—without thunder.  Something, I know not what, continually set
us up upon the island.  We lay more and more to the nor’ard; and you
would have thought the shore copied our manœuvre and outsailed us. Once
and twice Raraka headed us again—again, in the sea fashion, the quite
innocent steersman was abused—and again the <u>Casco</u> kept away.  Had I
been called on, with no more light than that of our experience, to draw
the configuration of that island, I should have shown a series of
bow-window promontories, each overlapping the other to the nor’ard, and
the trend of the land from the south-east to the north-west, and behold,
on the chart it lay near east and west in a straight line.
</p><p>We had but just repeated our manœuvre and kept away—for not more than
five minutes the railway embankment had been lost to view and the surf to
hearing—when I was aware of land again, not only on the weather bow, but
dead ahead.  I played the part of the judicious landsman, holding my
peace till the last moment; and presently my mariners perceived it for
themselves.
</p><p>‘Land ahead!’ said the steersman.
</p><p>‘By God, it’s Kauehi!’ cried the mate.
</p><p>And so it was.  And with that I began to be sorry for cartographers.  We
were scarce doing three and a half; and they asked me to believe that (in
five minutes) we had dropped an island, passed eight miles of open water,
and run almost high and dry upon the next.  But my captain was more sorry
for himself to be afloat in such a labyrinth; laid the <u>Casco</u> to, with
the log line up and down, and sat on the stern rail and watched it till
the morning.  He had enough of night in the Paumotus.
</p><p>By daylight on the 9th we began to skirt Kauehi, and had now an
opportunity to see near at hand the geography of atolls.  Here and there,
where it was high, the farther side loomed up; here and there the near
side dipped entirely and showed a broad path of water into the lagoon;
here and there both sides were equally abased, and we could look right
through the discontinuous ring to the sea horizon on the south.
Conceive, on a vast scale, the submerged hoop of the duck-hunter, trimmed
with green rushes to conceal his head—water within, water without—you
have the image of the perfect atoll.  Conceive one that has been partly
plucked of its rush fringe; you have the atoll of Kauehi.  And for either
shore of it at closer quarters, conceive the line of some old Roman
highway traversing a wet morass, and here sunk out of view and there
re-arising, crowned with a green tuft of thicket; only instead of the
stagnant waters of a marsh, the live ocean now boiled against, now buried
the frail barrier.  Last night’s impression in the dark was thus
confirmed by day, and not corrected.  We sailed indeed by a mere causeway
in the sea, of nature’s handiwork, yet of no greater magnitude than many
of the works of man.
</p><p>The isle was uninhabited; it was all green brush and white sand, set in
transcendently blue water; even the coco-palms were rare, though some of
these completed the bright harmony of colour by hanging out a fan of
golden yellow.  For long there was no sign of life beyond the vegetable,
and no sound but the continuous grumble of the surf.  In silence and
desertion these fair shores slipped past, and were submerged and rose
again with clumps of thicket from the sea.  And then a bird or two
appeared, hovering and crying; swiftly these became more numerous, and
presently, looking ahead, we were aware of a vast effervescence of winged
life.  In this place the annular isle was mostly under water, carrying
here and there on its submerged line a wooded islet.  Over one of these
the birds hung and flew with an incredible density like that of gnats or
hiving bees; the mass flashed white and black, and heaved and quivered,
and the screaming of the creatures rose over the voice of the surf in a
shrill clattering whirr.  As you descend some inland valley a not
dissimilar sound announces the nearness of a mill and pouring river.
Some stragglers, as I said, came to meet our approach; a few still hung
about the ship as we departed.  The crying died away, the last pair of
wings was left behind, and once more the low shores of Kauehi streamed
past our eyes in silence like a picture.  I supposed at the time that the
birds lived, like ants or citizens, concentred where we saw them.  I have
been told since (I know not if correctly) that the whole isle, or much of
it, is similarly peopled; and that the effervescence at a single spot
would be the mark of a boat’s crew of egg-hunters from one of the
neighbouring inhabited atolls.  So that here at Kauehi, as the day before
at Taiaro, the <u>Casco</u> sailed by under the fire of unsuspected eyes.  And
one thing is surely true, that even on these ribbons of land an army
might lie hid and no passing mariner divine its presence.
