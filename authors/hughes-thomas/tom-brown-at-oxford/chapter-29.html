<p>"June 24, 184-.</p>

<p>"My Dear Tom, &mdash;Your letter came to hand this morning, and
it has, of course, given your mother and me much pain. It is not
the money that we care about, but that our son should have deliberately
undertaken, or pretended to undertake, what he must have known
at the time he could not perform himself.</p>

<p>"I have written to my bankers to pay 100L. at once to your account
at the Oxford Bank. I have also requested my solicitor to go over
to Oxford, and he will probably call on you the day after you
receive this. You say that this person who holds your note of
hand is now in Oxford. You will see him in the presence of my
solicitor, to whom you will hand the note when you have recovered
it. I shall consider afterwards what further steps will have to
be taken in the matter.</p>

<p>"You will not be of age for a year. It will be time enough then
to determine whether you will repay the balance of this money
out of the legacy to which you will be entitled under your grandfather's
will. In the meantime, I shall deduct at the rate of 50L. a year
from your allowance and I shall hold your bond in honor to reduce
your expenditure by this amount. You are no longer a boy, and
one of the first duties which a man owes to his friends and to
society is to live within his income.</p>

<p>"I make this advance to you on two conditions. First, that you
will never again put your hand to a note or bill in a transaction
of this kind. If you have money, lend it or spend it. You may
lend or spend foolishly, but that is not the point here; at any
rate you are dealing with what is your own. But in transactions
of this kind you are dealing with what is not your own. A gentleman
should shrink from the possibility of having to come on others,
even on his own father, for the fulfillment of his obligations,
as he would from a lie. I would sooner see a son of mine in his
grave than crawling on through life a slave to wants and habits
which he must gratify at other people's expense.</p>

<p>"My second condition is, that you put an end to your acquaintance
with these two gentlemen who have led you into this scrape, and
have divided the proceeds of your joint note between them. They
are both your seniors in standing, you say, and they appear to
be familiar with this plan of raising money at the expense of
other people. The plain English word for such doings is, swindling.
What pains me most is, that you have become intimate with young
men of this kind. I am not sure that it will not be my duty to
lay the whole matter before the authorities of the college. You
do not mention their names, and I respect the feeling which has
led you not to mention them. I shall know them quite soon enough
through my solicitor, who will forward me a copy of the note of
hand and signatures in due course.</p>

<p>"Your letter makes general allusion to other matters; and I gather
from it that you are dissatisfied with the manner in which you
have spent your first year at Oxford. I do not ask for specific
confessions, which you seem inclined to offer me; in fact, I would
sooner not have them, unless there is any other matter in which
you want assistance or advice from me. I know from experience
that Oxford is a place full of temptation of all kinds, offered
to young men at the most critical time of their lives. Knowing
this, I have deliberately accepted the responsibility of sending
you there, and I do not repent it. I am glad that you are dissatisfied
with your first year. If you had not been I should have felt much
more anxious about your second. Let bygones be bygones between
you and me. You know where to go for strength, and to make confessions
which no human ear should hear, for no human judgment can weigh
the cause. The secret places of a man's heart are for himself
and God. Your mother sends her love.</p>

<p>"I am, ever your affectionate father, &mdash;<em>JOHN BROWN</em>."</p>

<p>June 26th, 184-.</p>

<p>"MY <em>DEAR BOY, &</em>mdash;I am not sorry that you have taken
my last letter as you have done. It is quite right to be sensitive
on these points, and it will have done you no harm to have fancied
for forty-eight hours that you had in my judgment lost caste as
a gentleman. But now I am very glad to be able to ease your mind
on this point. You have done a very foolish thing; but it is only
the habit, and the getting others to bind themselves, and not
the doing it oneself for others, which is disgraceful. You are
going to pay honourably for your folly, and will owe me neither
thanks nor money in the transaction. I have chosen my own terms
for repayment, which you have accepted, and so the financial question
is disposed of.</p>

<p>"I have considered what you say as to your companions&mdash;friends
I will not call them&mdash;and will promise you not to take any further
steps, or to mention the subject to anyone. But I must insist
on my second condition, that you avoid all further intimacy with
them. I do not mean that you are to cut them, or do anything that
will attract attention. But, no more intimacy.</p>

<p>"And now, my dear boy, as to the rest of your letter. Mine must
indeed have failed to express my meaning. God forbid that there
should not be the most perfect confidence between us. There is
nothing which I desire or value more. I only question whether
special confessions will conduce to it. My experience is against
them. I almost doubt whether they can be perfectly honest between
man and man; and, taking into account the difference of our ages,
it seems to be much more likely that we should misunderstand one
another. But having said this, I leave it to you to follow your
own conscience in the matter. If there is any burthen which I
can help you to bear, it will be my greatest pleasure, as it is
my duty, to do it. So now, say what you please, or say no more.
If you speak, it will be to one who has felt and remembers a young
man's trials.</p>

<p>"We hope you will be able to come home to-morrow, or the next
day, at latest. Your mother is longing to see you, and I should
be glad to have you here a day or two before the assizes, which
are held next week. I should rather like you to accompany me to
them, as it will give me the opportunity of introducing you to
my brother magistrates from other parts of the county, whom you
are not likely to meet elsewhere, and it is a good thing for a
young man to know his own county well.</p>

<p>"The cricket club is very flourishing, you will be glad to hear,
and they have put off their best matches till your return; so
you are in great request, you see. I am told that the fishing
is very good this year, and am promised several days for you in
the club water.</p>

<p>"September is a long way off, but there is nothing like being
before hand; I have put your name down for a license; and it is
time you should have a good gun of your own; so I have ordered
one for you from a man who has lately settled in the county. He
was Purdy's foreman, with whom I used to build, and, I can see,
understands his business thoroughly. His locks are as good as
any I have ever seen. I have told him to make the stock rather
longer, and not quite so straight as that of my old double with
which you shot last year. I think I remember you criticized my
weapon on these points; but there will be time for you to alter
the details after you get home, if you disapprove of my orders.
It will be more satisfactory if it is built under your own eye.</p>

<p>"If you continue in the mind for a month's reading with your
friend Mr. Hardy, we will arrange it towards the end of the vacation;
but would he not come here? From what you say we should very much
like to know him. Pray ask him from me whether he will pass the
last month of the vacation here, reading with you. I should like
you to be his first regular pupil. Of course this will be my affair.
And now, God bless you, and come home as soon as you can. Your
mother sends her best love.</p>

<p>"Ever your most affectionate,</p>

<p>"<em>JOHN BROWN</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>ENGLEBOURN RECTORY, "</em>June 28th, 184-'</p>

<p>"<em>DEAREST MARY; &</em>mdash;How good of you to write to me
so soon! Your letter has come like a gleam of sunshine. I am in
the midst of worries already. Indeed, as you know, I could never
quite throw off the fear of what might be happening here, while
we were enjoying ourselves at Oxford, and it has all turned out
even worse than I expected. I shall never be able to go away again
in comfort, I think. And yet, if I had been here, I don't know
that I could have done any good. It is so very sad that poor papa
is unable to attend to his magistrate's business, and he has been
worse than usual, quite laid up in fact, since our return. There
is no other magistrate&mdash;not even a gentleman in the place, as
you know, except the curate; and they will not listen to him,
even if he would interfere in their quarrels. But he says he will
not meddle with secular matters; and, poor man, I cannot blame
him, for it is very easy and sad and wearing to be mixed up in
it all.</p>

<p>"But now I must tell you all my troubles. You remember the men
whom we saw mowing together just before we went to Oxford. Betty
Winburn's son was one of them, and I am afraid the rest are not
at all good company for him. When they had finished papa's hay,
they went to mow for Farmer Tester. You must remember him, dear,
I am sure; the tall, gaunt man, with heavy, thick lips and a broken
nose, and the top of his head quite flat, as if it had been cut
off a little above his eyebrows. He is a very miserly man, and
a hard master; at least all the poor people tell me so, and he
looks cruel. I have always been afraid of him, and disliked him,
for I remember as a child hearing papa complain how troublesome
he was in the vestry; and except old Simon, who, I believe, only
does it from perverseness, I have never heard anybody speak well
of him.</p>

<p>"The first day that the men went to mow for Farmer Tester, he
gave them sour beer to drink. You see, dear, they bargained to
mow for so much money and their beer. They were very discontented
at this, and they lost a good deal of time going to complain to
him about it, and they had high words with him.</p>

<p>"The men said the beer wasn't fit for pigs, and the farmer said
it was quite good enough 'for such as they,' and if they didn't
like his beer they might buy their own. In the evening, too, he
came down and complained that the mowing was bad, and then there
were more high words, for the men are very jealous about their
work. However they went to work as usual the next morning, and
all might have gone off quietly, but in the day Farmer Tester
found two pigs in his turnip field which adjoins the common, and
had them put in the pound. One of these pigs belonged to Betty
Winburn's son, and the other to one of the men who was mowing
with him; so, when they came home at night, they found what had
happened.</p>

<p>"The constable is our pound-keeper, the little man who amused
you so much; he plays the bass-viol in church. When he puts any
beasts into the pound he cuts a stick in two, and gives one piece
to the person who brings the beasts, and keeps the other himself,
and the owner of the beasts has to bring the other end of the
stick to him before he can let them out. Therefore, the owner,
you see, must go to the person who has pounded his beasts, and
make a bargain with him for payment of the damage which has been
done, and so get back the other end of the stick, which they call
the 'tally,' to produce to the pound-keeper.</p>

<p>"Well, the men went off to the constable's when they heard their
pigs were pounded, to find who had the 'tally,' and, when they
found it was Farmer Tester, they went in a body to his house to
remonstrate with him, and learn what he set the damages at. The
farmer used dreadful language to them, I hear, and said they weren't
fit to have pigs, and must pay half a crown for each pig, before
they could have the 'tally;' and the men irritated him by telling
him that his fences were a shame to the parish, because he was
too stingy to have them mended, and that the pigs couldn't have
found half a crown's worth of turnips in the whole field, for
he never put any manure on it except what he could get off the
road, which ought to belong to the poor. At last the farmer drove
them away saying he should stop the money out of the price he
was to pay for their mowing.</p>

<p>"Then there was very near being a riot in the parish; for some
of the men are very reckless people, and they went in the evening
and blew horns and beat kettles before his house, till the constable,
who has behaved very well, persuaded them to go away.</p>

<p>"In the morning one of the pigs had been taken out of the pound;
not Betty's son's, I am glad to say&mdash;for no doubt it was very
wrong of the men to take it out. The farmer was furious, and went
with the constable in the morning to find the pig, but they could
hear nothing of it anywhere. James Pope, the man to whom it belonged,
only laughed at them, and said he never could keep his pig in
himself, because it was grandson to one of the acting pigs that
went about to the fairs, and all the pigs of that family took
to climbing naturally; so his pig must have climbed out of the
pound. This of course was all a story; the men had lifted the
pig out of the pound, and then killed it, so that the farmer might
not find it, and sold the meat cheap all over the parish. Betty
went to the farmer that morning and paid the half crown, and got
her son's pig out before he came home; but Farmer Tester stopped
the other half crown out of the men's wages, which made matters
worse then ever.</p>

<p>"The day that we were in the Theatre at Oxford, Farmer Tester
was away at one of the markets. He turns his big cattle out to
graze on the common, which the poor people say he has no right
to do, and in the afternoon a pony of his got into the allotments,
and Betty's son caught it, and took it to the constable, and had
it put in the pound. The constable tried to persuade him not to
do it, but it was of no use; and so, when Farmer Tester came home,
he found that his turn had come. I am afraid that he was not sober,
for I hear that he behaved dreadfully both to the constable and
to Betty's son, and, when he found that he could not frighten
them, he declared he would have the law of them if it cost him
twenty pounds. So in the morning he went to fetch his lawyer,
and when we got home you can fancy what a scene it was.</p>

<p>"You remember how poorly papa was when you left us at Lambourn.
By the time we got home he was quite knocked up, and so nervous
that he was fit for nothing except to have a quiet cup of tea
in his own room. I was sure as we drove up the street, there was
something the matter. The ostler was watching outside the Red
Lion, and ran in as soon as we came in sight; and, as we passed
the door, out came Farmer Tester, looking very flushed in the
face, and carrying his great iron-handled whip, and a person with
him, who I found was his lawyer, and they marched after the carriage.
Then the constable was standing at his door too, and he came after
us, and there was a group of men outside the rectory gate. We
had not been in the house five minutes before a servant came in
to say that Farmer Tester and a gentlemen wanted to see papa on
particular business. Papa sent out word that he was very unwell,
and that it was not the proper time to come on business; he would
see them the next day at twelve o'clock. But they would not go
away, and then papa asked me to go out and see them. You can fancy
how disagreeable it was; and I was so angry with them for coming,
when they knew how nervous papa is after a journey, that I could
not have patience to persuade them to leave; and so at last they
made poor papa see them after all.</p>

<p>"He was lying on a sofa, and quite unfit to cope with a hard
bad man like Farmer Tester, and a fluent plausible lawyer. They
told their story all their own way, and the farmer declared that
the man had tempted the pony into the allotment with corn. And
the lawyer said that the constable had no right to keep the pony
in the pound, that he was liable to all sorts of punishments.
They wanted papa to make an order at once for the pound to be
opened, and I think he would have done so, but I asked him in
a whisper to send for the constable, and hear what he had to say.
The constable was waiting in the kitchen, so he came in in a minute.
You can't think how well he behaved; I have quite forgiven him
all his obstinacy about the singing. He told the whole story about
the pigs, and how Farmer Tester had stopped money out of the men's
wages. And when the lawyer tried to frighten him, he answered
him quite boldly, that he mightn't know so much about the law,
but he knew what was always the custom long before his time at
Englebourn about the pound, and if Farmer Tester wanted his beast
out, he must bring the 'tally' like another man. Then the lawyer
appealed to papa about the law, and said how absurd it was, and
that if such a custom were to be upheld, the man who had the 'tally'
might charge 100L. for the damage. And poor papa looked through
his law books, and could find nothing about it at all; and while
he was doing it Farmer Tester began to abuse the constable, and
said he sided with all the good-for-nothing fellows in the parish,
and that bad blood would come of it. But the constable quite fired
up at that, and told him that it was such as he who made bad blood
in the parish, and that poor folks had their rights as well as
their betters, and should have them as long as he was constable.
If he got papa's order to open the pound, he supposed he must
do it, and 'twas not for him to say what was law, but Henry Winburn
had had to get the 'tally' for his pig from Farmer Tester, and
what was fair for one was fair for all.</p>

<p>"I was afraid papa would have made the order, but the lawyer
said something at last which made him take the other side. So
he settled that the farmer should pay five shillings for the 'tally,'
which was what he had taken from Betty, and had stopped out of
the wages, and that was the only order he would make, and the
lawyer might do what he pleased about it. The constable seemed
satisfied with this, and undertook to take the money down to Harry
Winburn, for Farmer Tester declared he would sooner let the pony
starve than go himself. And so papa got rid of them after an hour
and more of this talk. The lawyer and Farmer Tester went away
grumbling and very angry to the Red Lion. I was very anxious to
hear how the matter ended; so I went after the constable to ask
him to come back and see me when he had settled it all, and about
nine o'clock he came. He had had a very hard job to get Harry
Winburn to take the money, and give up the 'tally.' The men said
that, if Farmer Tester could make them pay half-a-crown for a
pig in his turnips, which were no bigger than radishes, he ought
to pay ten shillings at least for his pony trampling down their
corn, which was half grown, and I couldn't help thinking this
seemed very reasonable. In the end, however, the constable had
persuaded them to take the money, and so the pony was let out.</p>

<p>"I told him how pleased I was at the way he had behaved, but
the little man didn't seem quite satisfied himself. He should
have liked to have given the lawyer a piece of his mind, he said,
only he was no scholar, 'but I've a got all the feelin's of a
man, miss, though I medn't have the ways o' bringin' on 'em out.'
You see I'm quite coming round to your opinion about him. But
when I said that I hoped all the trouble was over, he shook his
head, and he seems to think that the men will not forget it, and
that some of the wild ones will be trying to pay Farmer Tester
out in the winter nights, and I could see he was very anxious
about Harry Winburn; so I promised him to go and see Betty.</p>

<p>"I went down to her cottage yesterday, and found her very low,
poor old soul, about her son. She has had a bad attack again,
and I am afraid her heart is not right. She will not live long
if she has much to make her anxious, and how is that to be avoided?
For her son's courting is all going wrong, she can see, though
he will not tell her anything about it; but he gets more moody
and restless, she says, and don't take a pride in anything, not
even in his flowers or his allotment; and he takes to going about,
more and more every day, with these men, who will be sure to lead
him into trouble.</p>

<p>"After I left her, I walked up to the Hawk's Lynch, to see whether
the view and the air would not do me good. And it did do me a
great deal of good, dear, and I thought of you, and when I should
see your bright face and hear your happy laugh again. The village
looked so pretty and peaceful. I could hardly believe, while I
was up there, that there were all these miserable quarrels and
heartburnings going on in it. I suppose they go on everywhere,
but one can't help feeling as if there was something specially
hard in those which come under one's own eyes, and touch one's
self. And then they are so frivolous, and everything might go
on so comfortably if people would only be reasonable. I ought
to have been a man, I am sure, and then I might, perhaps, be able
to do more, and should have more influence. If poor papa were
only well and strong!</p>

<p>"But, dear, I shall tire you with all these long histories and
complainings. I have run on till I have no room left for anything
else; but you can't think what a comfort it is to me to write
it all to you, for I have no one to tell it to. I feel so much
better, and more cheerful, since I sat down to write this. You
must give my dear love to uncle and aunt, and let me hear from
you again whenever you have time. If you could come over again
and stay for a few days, it would be very kind; but I must not
press it, as there is nothing to attract you here, only we might
talk over all that we did and saw at Oxford. &mdash;Ever, dearest
Mary, your affectionate cousin,</p>

<p>"Katie"</p>

<p>"P. S. &mdash;I should like to have the pattern of the jacket
you wore the last day at Oxford. Could you cut it out in thin
paper and send it in your next?"</p>

<p>"July-,184-.</p>

<p>"MY <em>DEAR BROWN, &</em>mdash;I was very glad to see your hand,
and to hear such flourishing accounts of your vacation doings.
You won't get any like announcement of me, for cricket has not
yet come so far west as this, at least not to settle. We have
a few pioneers and squatters in the villages; but, I am sorry
to say, nothing yet like matches between the elevens of districts.
Neighbors we have none, except the rector; so I have plenty of
spare time, some of which I feel greatly disposed to devote to
you; and I hope you won't find me too tedious to read.</p>

<p>"It is very kind of your father to wish that you should be my
first pupil, and to propose that I should spend the last month
of this vacation with you in Berkshire. But I do not like to give
up a whole month. My father is getting old and infirm, and I can
see that it would be a great trial to him, although he urges it,
and is always telling me not to let him keep me at home. What
do you say to meeting me half way? I mean, that you should come
here for half of the time, and then that I should return with
you for the last fortnight of the vacation. This I could manage
perfectly.</p>

<p>"But you cannot in any case be my first pupil; for not to mention
that I have been, as you know, teaching for some years, I have
a pupil here, at this minute. You are not likely to guess who
it is, though you know him well enough&mdash;perhaps I should say too
well&mdash;so, in a word, it is Blake. I had not been at home three
days before I got a letter from him, asking me to take him, and
putting it in such a way that I couldn't refuse. I would sooner
not have had him, as I had already got out of taking a reading
party with some trouble, and felt inclined to enjoy myself here
in dignified idleness till next term. But what can you do when
a man puts it to you as a great personal favor, &amp;c. &amp;c.?
So I wrote to accept. You may imagine my disgust a day or two
afterwards, at getting a letter from an uncle of his, some official
person in London apparently, treating the whole matter in a <em>business</em>
point of view, and me as if I were a training groom. He is good
enough to suggest a stimulant to me in the shape of extra pay
and his future patronage in the event of his nephew's taking a
first in Michaelmas term. If I had received this letter before,
I think it would have turned the scale, and I should have refused.
But the thing was done, and Blake isn't fairly responsible for
his relative's views.</p>

<p>"So here he has been for a fortnight. He took a lodging in the
village at first; but of course my dear old father's ideas of
hospitality were shocked at this, and here he is, our inmate.</p>

<p>"He reads fiercely by fits and starts. A feeling of personal
hatred against the examiners seems to urge him on more than any
other motive; but this will not be strong enough to keep him to
regular work, and without regular work he won't do, notwithstanding
all his cleverness, and he is a marvellously clever fellow. So
the first thing I have to do is to get him steadily to the collar,
and how to do it is a pretty particular puzzle. For he hasn't
a grain of enthusiasm in his composition, nor any power, as far
as I can see, of throwing himself into the times and scenes of
which he is reading. The philosophy of Greece and the history
of Rome are matters of perfect indifference to him&mdash;to be got
up by catch-words and dates for examination and nothing more.
I don't think he would care a straw if Socrates had never lived,
or Hannibal had destroyed Rome. The greatest names and deeds of
the old world are just so many dead counters to him&mdash;the Jewish
just as much as the rest. I tried him with the story of the attempt
of Antiochus Epiphanes to conquer the Jews, and the glorious rising
of all that was living in the Holy Land under the Maccabees. Not
it bit of it; I couldn't get a spark out of him. He wouldn't even
read the story because it is in the Apocrypha, and so, as he said,
the d&#11834;d examiners couldn't ask him anything about it in the
schools.</p>

<p>"Then his sense of duty is quiet undeveloped. He has no notion
of going on doing anything disagreeable because he ought. So here
I am at fault again. Ambition he has in abundance; in fact so
strongly, that very likely it may in the end pull him through,
and make him work hard enough for his Oxford purposes at any rate.
But it wants repressing rather than encouragement, and I certainly
shan't appeal to it.</p>

<p>"You will begin to think I dislike him and want to get rid of
him, but it isn't the case. You know what a good temper he has,
and how remarkably well he talks; so he makes himself very pleasant,
and my father evidently enjoys his company; and then to be in
constant intercourse with a subtle intellect like his, is pleasantly
exciting, and keeps one alive and at high pressure, though one
can't help always wishing that it had a little heat in it. You
would be immensely amused if you could drop in on us.</p>

<p>"I think I have told you or you must have seen it for yourself,
that my father's principles are true blue, as becomes a sailor
of the time of the great war, while his instincts and practice
are liberal in the extreme. Our rector, on the contrary, is liberal
in principles, but an aristocrat of the aristocrats in instinct
and practice. They are always ready enough therefore to do battle,
and Blake delights in the war, and fans it and takes part in it
as a sort of free lance, laying little logical pitfalls for the
combatants alternately, with that deferential manner of his. He
gets some sort of intellectual pleasure, I suppose, out of seeing
where they ought to tumble in; for tumble in they don't, but clear
his pit-falls in their stride&mdash;at least my father does&mdash;quite
innocent of having neglected to distribute his middle term; and
the rector, if he has some inkling of these traps, brushes them
aside, and disdains to spend powder on anyone but his old adversary
and friend. I employ myself in trying to come down ruthlessly
on Blake himself; and so we spend our evenings after dinner, which
comes off at the primitive hour of five. We used to dine at three,
but my father has comformed now to college hours. If the rector
does not come, instead of argumentative talk, we get stories out
of my father. In the morning we bathe, and boat, and read. So,
you see, he and I have plenty of one another's company; and it
is certainly odd that we get on so well with so very few points
of sympathy. But, luckily, besides his good temper and cleverness,
he has plenty of humor. On the whole, I think we shall rub through
the two months which he is to spend here without getting to hate
one another, though there is little chance of our becoming friends.
Besides putting some history and science into him (scholarship
he does not need), I shall be satisfied if I can make him give
up his use of the pronoun 'you' before he goes. In talking of
the corn laws, or foreign policy, or India, or any other political
subject, however interesting, he never will identify himself as
an Englishman; and 'you do this,' or 'you expect that' is for
ever in his mouth, speaking of his own countrymen. I believe if
the French were to land to-morrow on Portland, he would comment
on our attempts to dislodge them as if he had no concern with
the business except as a looker-on.</p>

<p>"You will think all this rather a slow return for your jolly
gossiping letter, full of cricket, archery, fishing, and I know
not what pleasant goings-on. But what is one to do? one can only
write about what is one's subject of interest for the time being,
and Blake stands in that relation to me just now. I should prefer
it otherwise, but <em>si on n'a pas ce qu'on aime il faut aimer
ce qu'on a</em>. I have no incident to relate; these parts get
on without incidents somehow, and without society. I wish there
were some, particularly ladies' society. I break the tenth commandment
constantly, thinking of Commemoration, and that you are within
a ride of Miss Winter and her cousin. When you see them next,
pray present my respectful compliments. It is a sort of consolation
to think that one may cross their fancy for a moment and be remembered
as part of a picture which gives them pleasure. With such piece
of sentiment I may as well shut up. Don't you forget my message
now, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Believe me, ever yours most truly,</p>

<p>"<em>JOHN HARDY</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>P.S. &</em>mdash;I mean to speak to Blake, when I get a
chance, of that wretched debt which you have paid, unless you
object. I should think better of him if he seemed more uncomfortable
about his affairs. After all he may be more so than I think, for
he is very reserved on such subjects."</p>

<p>"<em>ENGLEBOURN RECTORY, "</em>July, 184-'</p>

<p>"<em>DEAREST MARY. &</em>mdash;I send the coachman with this
note in order that you may not be anxious about me. I have just
returned from poor Betty Winburn's cottage to write it. She is
very very ill, and I do not think can last out more than a day
or two; and she seems to cling to me so that I cannot have the
heart to leave her. Indeed, if I could make up my mind to do it,
I should never get her poor white eager face out of my head all
day, so that I should be very bad company, and quite out of place
at your party, making everybody melancholy and uncomfortable who
came near me. So, dear, I am not coming. Of course it is a great
disappointment. I had set my heart on being with you, and enjoying
it all thoroughly; and even at breakfast this morning knew of
nothing to hinder me. My dress is actually lying on the bed at
this minute, and it looks very pretty, especially the jacket like
yours, which I and Hopkins have managed to make up from the pattern
you sent, though you forgot the sleeves, which made it rather
hard to do. Ah, well; it is no use to think of how pleasant things
would have been which one cannot have. You must write me an account
of how it all went off, dear; or perhaps you can manage to get
over here before long to tell me.</p>

<p>"I must now go back to poor Betty. She is such a faithful, patient
old thing, and has been such a good woman all her life that there
is nothing painful in being by her now, and one feels sure that
it will be much happier and better for her to be at rest. If she
could only feel comfortable about her son, I am sure she would
think so herself. Oh, I forgot to say that her attack was brought
on by the shock of hearing that he had been summoned for an assault.
Farmer Tester's son, a young man about his own age, has, it seems,
been of late waylaying Simon's daughter and making love to her.
It is so very hard to make out the truth in matters of this kind.
Hopkins says she is a dressed-up little minx who runs after all
the young men in the parish; but really, from what I see and hear
from other persons, I think she is a good girl enough. Even Betty,
who looks on her as the cause of most of her own trouble, has
never said a word to make me think that she is at all a light
person, or more fond of admiration than any other good-looking
girl in the parish.</p>

<p>"But those Testers are a very wicked set. You cannot think what
a misfortune it is in a place like this to have these rich families
with estates of their own, in which the young men begin to think
themselves above the common farmers. They ape the gentlemen, and
give themselves great airs, but of course no gentleman will associate
with them, as they are quite uneducated; and the consequence is
that they live a great deal at home, and give themselves up to
all kinds of wickedness. This young Tester is one of these. His
father is a very bad old man, and does a great deal of harm here;
and the son is following in his steps, and is quite as bad, or
worse. So you see that I shall not easily believe that Harry Winburn
has been much in the wrong. However, all I know of it at present
is that young Tester was beaten by Harry yesterday evening in
the village street, and that they came to papa at once for a summons.</p>

<p>"Oh, here is the coachman ready to start; so I must conclude,
dear, and go back to my patient. I shall often think of you during
the day. I am sure you will have a charming party. With best love
to all, believe me, ever dearest,</p>

<p>"Your most affectionate,</p>

<p>"<em>KATIE</em>.</p>

<p>"P. S. &mdash;I am very glad that uncle and aunt take to Tom,
and that he is staying with you for some days. You will find him
very useful in making the party go off well, I am sure."</p>
