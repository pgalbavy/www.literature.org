<p>Some minutes later, on the northward speeding train, he left
Portlaw playing solitaire in their own compartment, and, crossing
the swaying corridor, entered the state-room opposite. Miss Wilming
was there, reading a novel, an enormous bunch of roses, a box
of bonbons, and a tiny kitten on the table before her. The kitten
was so young that it was shaky on its legs, and it wore very wide
eyes and a blue bow.</p>

<p>"Hello, Dolly," he said pleasantly. She answered rather faintly.</p>

<p>"What a voice&mdash;like the peep of an infant sparrow! Are you worrying?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"You needn't be. Alphonse will make a noise, of course, but you
needn't mind that. The main thing in life is to know what you
want to do and do it. Which I've never yet done in my life. Zut!
Zut!!&mdash;as our late Count Alphonse might say. And he'll say other
remarks when he finds you've gone, Dolly." And Malcourt, who was
a mimic, shrugged and raised his arms in Gallic appeal to the
gods of wrath, until he mouthed his face into a startling resemblance
to that of the bereft nobleman.</p>

<p>Then he laughed a little&mdash;not very heartily; then, in a more
familiar r√¥le, he sat down opposite the girl and held up one finger
of admonition and consolation.</p>

<p>"The main thing, Dolly, was to get clear of him&mdash;and all that
silly business. Yes? No? Bon!... And now everything is cleared
up between us, and I've told you what I'd do&mdash;if you really wanted
a chance. I believe in chances for people."</p>

<p>The girl, who was young, buried her delicate face in the roses
and looked at him. The kitten, balanced on tiny, wavering legs,
stared hard at him, too. He looked from girl to kitten, conscious
of the resemblance, and managed to smother a smile.</p>

<p>"You said," he repeated severely, "that you wanted a chance.
I told you what I could and would do; see that you live and dress
decently, stand for your musical, dramatic, athletic, and terpsichorean
education and drilling&mdash;but not for one atom of nonsense. Is that
clear?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Not one break; not one escapade, Dolly. It's up to you."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"All right, then. What's passed doesn't count. You start in and
see what you can do. They say they drag one about by the hair
at those dramatic schools. If they do, you've got to let 'em.
Anyway, things ought to come easier to you than to some, for you've
got a corking education, and you don't drink sloe-gin, and you
don't smoke."</p>

<p>"And I <em>can</em> cook," added the girl gravely, looking at
her childish ringless hands. The rings and a number of other details
had been left behind addressed to the count.</p>

<p>"The trouble will be," said Malcourt, "that you will miss the
brightness and frivolity of things. That kitten won't compensate."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? I haven't had very much of anything&mdash;even kittens,"
she said, picking up the soft ball of fur and holding it under
her chin.</p>

<p>"You missed the frivolous in life even before you had it. You'll
miss it again, too."</p>

<p>"But I've had it now."</p>

<p>"That doesn't count. The capacity for frivolity is always there.
You are reconciled just now to other things; that man is a beast
all right. Oh, yes; this is reaction, Dolly. The idea is to hang
on to this conservatism when it becomes stupid and irksome; when
you're tired and discouraged, and when you want to be amused and
be in bright, attractive places; and when you're lonesome&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lonesome?"</p>

<p>"Certainly you'll be lonesome if you're good."</p>

<p>"Am I not to see you?"</p>

<p>"I'll be in the backwoods working for a living&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but when you come to New York?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing."</p>

<p>"Often?"</p>

<p>"As often as it's advisable," he said pleasantly. "I want you
to make friends at school; I want you to have lots of them. A
bachelor girl has got to have 'em.... It's on your account and
theirs that I don't intend to have anybody make any mistake about
me.... Therefore, I'll come to see you when you've a friend or
two present. It's fairer to you. <em>Now</em> do you understand
me, Dolly?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it agreeable?"</p>

<p>"Y-es." And, flushing: "But I did not mistake you, Louis; and
there is no reason not to come, even if I am alone."</p>

<p>He laughed, lighted a cigarette, and stroked the kitten.</p>

<p>"It's an amusing experiment, anyway," he said.</p>

<p>"Have you never tried it before?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, several times."</p>

<p>"Were the several times successes?"</p>

<p>"Not one!" he said, laughing. "It's up to you, Dolly, to prove
me a bigger ass than I have been yet&mdash;or the reverse."</p>

<p>"It lies with me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Have I ever made love to you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ever even kissed you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ever been a brute?"</p>

<p>"No.... You are not very careful in speaking to me sometimes.
Once&mdash;at the Club&mdash;when Mr. Hamil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I <em>was</em> brutal. I know it. Do you want my respect?"</p>

<p>"Y-es."</p>

<p>"Earn it," he said drily.</p>

<p>The girl leaned back in her corner, flushed, silent, thoughtful;
and sometimes her eyes were fixed on vacancy, sometimes on him
where he sat in the opposite seat staring out into the blurred
darkness at the red eye of the beacon on Jupiter Light which turned
flaring, turned again, dwindling to a spark, and went out.</p>

<p>"Of what are you thinking?" she asked, noticing his frown.</p>

<p>He did not reply; he was thinking of Shiela Cardross. And, frowning,
he picked up the kitten, very gently, and flattered it until it
purred.</p>

<p>"It's about as big as a minute," said the girl, softly touching
the tiny head.</p>

<p>"There <em>are</em> minutes as big as elephants, too," he said,
amused. "Nice pussy!" The kitten, concurring in these sentiments,
purred with pleasure.</p>

<p>A little later he sauntered back to his own compartment, and,
taking out a memorandum, made some figures.</p>

<p>"Is that girl aboard?" asked Portlaw, looking up from the table,
his fat hands full of cards.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe so."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a deuce of a thing to do."</p>

<p>"What?"&mdash;absently.</p>

<p>"What! Why, to travel about the country with the nucleus of a
theatrical troupe on your hands&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She wanted another chance. Few get it."</p>

<p>"Very well, son, if you think you can afford to endow a home
for the frivolously erring! &mdash;And the chances are she'll
turn on you and scratch."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the chances favour that."</p>

<p>"She won't understand it; that sort never understands decency
in a man."</p>

<p>"Do you think it might damage my reputation to be misunderstood?"
sneered Malcourt. "I've taken a notion to give her a chance and
I'm going to do it."</p>

<p>Portlaw spread out his first row of cards. "You know what everybody
will think, I suppose."</p>

<p>Malcourt yawned.</p>

<p>Presently Portlaw began in a babyish-irritated voice: "I've buried
the deuce and trey of diamonds, and blocked myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>shut</em> up!" said Malcourt, who was hastily scribbling
a letter to Virginia Suydam.</p>

<p>He did not post it, however, until he reached New York, being
very forgetful and busy in taking money away from the exasperated
Portlaw through the medium of double dummy. Also he had a girl,
a kitten, and other details to look after, and several matters
to think over. So Virginia's letter waited.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>Virginia waited, too. She had several headaches to keep inquiring
friends at a distance, for her eyes were inclined to redness in
those days, and she developed a pronounced taste for the solitude
of the chapel and churchly things.</p>

<p>So when at length the letter arrived, Miss Suydam evaded Constance
and made for the beach; for it was her natural instinct to be
alone with Malcourt, and the instinct unconsciously included even
his memory.</p>

<p>Her maid was packing; Constance Palliser's maid was also up to
her chin in lingerie, and Constance hovered in the vicinity. So
there was no privacy there, and that was the reason Virginia evaded
them, side-stepped Gussie Vetchen at the desk, eluded old Classon
in the palm room, and fled like a ghost through the empty corridors
as though the deuce were at her heels instead of in her heart.</p>

<p>The heart of Virginia was cutting up. Alone in the corridors
she furtively glanced at the letter, kissed the edge of the envelope,
rolled and tucked it away in her glove, and continued her flight
in search of solitude.</p>

<p>The vast hotel seemed lonely enough, but it evidently was too
populous to suit Miss Suydam. Yet few guests remained, and the
larger caravansary was scheduled to close in another day or two,
the residue population to be transferred to "The Breakers."</p>

<p>The day was piping hot but magnificent; corridor, piazza, colonnade,
and garden were empty of life, except for a listless negro servant
dawdling here and there. Virginia managed to find a wheel-chair
under the colonnade and a fat black boy at the control to propel
it; and with her letter hidden in her glove, and her heart racing,
she seated herself, parasol tilted, chin in the air, and the chair
rolled noiselessly away through the dazzling sunshine of the gardens.</p>

<p>On the beach some barelegged children were wading in the surf's
bubbling ebb, hunting for king-crabs; an old black mammy, wearing
apron and scarlet turban, sat luxuriously in the burning sand
watching her thin-legged charges, and cooking the "misery" out
of her aged bones. Virginia could see nobody else, except a distant
swimmer beyond the raft, capped with a scarlet kerchief. This
was not solitude, but it must do.</p>

<p>So she dismissed her chair-boy and strolled out under the pier.
And, as nobody was there to interrupt her she sat down in the
sand and opened her letter with fingers that seemed absurdly helpless
and unsteady.</p>

<p>"On the train near Jupiter Light," it was headed; and presently
continued:</p>

<p>   "I am trying to be unselfishly honest with you to see how
it    feels. First&mdash;about my loving anybody. I never have; I have
on    several occasions been prepared to bestow heart and hand&mdash;been   
capable of doing it&mdash;and something happened every time. On one
of    these receptive occasions the thing that happened put me   
permanently out of business. I'll tell you about that later.</p>

<p>   "What I want to say is that the reason I don't love you is
not    because I can't, but because I won't! You don't understand
that.    Let me try to explain. I've always had the capacity for
really    loving some woman. I was more or less lonely and shy
as a child    and had few playmates&mdash;very few girls of my age.
I adored those I    knew&mdash;but&mdash;well, I was not considered to be
a very desirable    playmate by those parents who knew the Malcourt
history.</p>

<p>   "One family was nice to me&mdash;some of them. I usually cared
a great    deal for anybody who was nice to me.</p>

<p>   "The point of all this biography is that I'm usually somewhat   
absurdly touched by the friendship of an attractive woman of my   
own sort&mdash;or, rather, of the sort I might have been. That is my   
attitude toward you; you are amiable to me; I like you.</p>

<p>   "Now, why am I not in love with you? I've told you that it's   
because I will not let myself be in love with you. Why?</p>

<p>   "Dear&mdash;it's just because you <em>have</em> been nice to me.
Do you    understand? No, you don't. Then&mdash;to go back to what
I spoke of    &mdash;I    am not free to marry. I am married.
Now you know. And there's no    way out of it that I can see.</p>

<p>   "If I were in love with you I'd simply take you. I am only
your    friend&mdash;and I can't do you that injury. Curious, isn't
it, how    such a blackguard as I am can be so fastidious!</p>

<p>   "But that's the truth. And that, too, may explain a number
of    other matters.</p>

<p>   "So you see how it is, dear. The world <em>is</em> full of
a number of    things. One of them signs himself your friend,</p>

"<em>LOUIS MALCOURT</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>Virginia's eyes remained on the written page long after she had
finished reading. They closed once or twice, opened again, blue-green,
expressionless. Looking aloft after a while she tried to comprehend
that the sky was still overhead; but it seemed to be a tricky,
unsteady, unfamiliar sky, wavering, crawling across space like
the wrinkled sea beneath it. Confused, she turned, peering about;
the beach, too, was becoming unstable; and, through the sudden
rushing darkness that obscured things, she tried to rise, then
dropped full length along the sand.</p>

<p>A few seconds later&mdash;or perhaps minutes, or perhaps hours&mdash;she
found herself seated perfectly conscious, mechanically drying
the sea-water from her wet face; while beside her knelt a red-capped
figure in wet bathing-dress, both hands brimming with sea-water
which ran slowly between the delicate fingers and fell, sparkling.</p>

<p>"Do you feel better?" asked Shiela gently.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, perfectly conscious and vaguely surprised. Presently
she looked down at her skirts, groped about, turned, searching
with outstretched fingers. Then her eyes fell on the letter. It
lay on the sand beside her sunshade, carefully weighted with a
shell.</p>

<p>Neither she nor the girl beside her spoke. Virginia adjusted
her hat and veil, sat motionless for a few moments, then picked
up the water-stained letter and, rolling it, placed it in her
wet glove. A slow flame burned in her pallid cheeks; her eyes
remained downcast.</p>

<p>Shiela said with quick sympathy: "I never fainted in my life.
Is it painful?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it's only rather horrid.... I had been walking in the sun.
It is very hot on the beach, I think; don't you?"</p>

<p>"Very," said the girl gravely.</p>

<p>Virginia, head still bent, was touching her wet lace waist with
her wetter gloves.</p>

<p>"It was very good of you," she said, in a low voice&mdash;"and quite
stupid of me."</p>

<p>Shiela straightened to her full height and stood gravely watching
the sea-water trickle from her joined palms. When the last shining
drop had fallen she looked questioningly at Miss Suydam.</p>

<p>"I'm a little tired, that is all," said Virginia. She rose rather
unsteadily and took advantage of Shiela's firm young arm, which,
as they progressed, finally slipped around Miss Suydam's waist.</p>

<p>Very slowly they crossed the burning sands together, scarcely
exchanging a word until they reached the Cardross pavilion.</p>

<p>"If you'll wait until I have my shower I'll take you back in
my chair," said Shiela. "Come into my own dressing-room; there's
a lounge."</p>

<p>Virginia, white and haggard, seated herself, leaning back languidly
against the wall and closing her heavy eyes. They opened again
when Shiela came back from the shower, knotting in the girdle
of her snowy bath-robe, and seated herself while her maid unloosed
the thick hair and rubbed it till the brown-gold lustre came out
like little gleams of sunlight, and the ends of the burnished
tresses crisped and curled up on the smooth shoulders of snow
and rose.</p>

<p>Virginia's lips began to quiver; she was fairly flinching now
under the pitiless contrast, fascinated yet shrinking from the
splendid young creature before her, resting there aglow in all
the vigourous beauty of untainted health.</p>

<p>And from the mirror reflected, the clear eyes smiled back at
her, seeming to sear her very soul with their untarnished loveliness.</p>

<p>"Suppose you come and lunch with me?" said Shiela. "I happen
to be quite alone. My maid is very glad to do anything for you.
Will you come?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Virginia faintly.</p>

<p>An hour later they had luncheon together in the jasmine arbour;
and after that Virginia lay in the hammock under the orange-trees,
very still, very tired, glad of the silence, and of the soft cool
hand which covered hers so lightly, and, at rare intervals, pressed
hers more lightly still.</p>

<p>Shiela, elbow on knee, one arm across the hammock's edge, chin
cupped in her other palm, sat staring at vacancy beside the hammock
where Virginia lay. And sometimes her partly doubled fingers indented
her red lower lip, sometimes they half framed the oval face, as
she sat lost in thought beside the hammock where Virginia lay
so pale and still.</p>

<p>Musing there in the dappled light, already linked together by
that subtle sympathy which lies in silence and in a common need
of it, they scarcely stirred save when Shiela's fingers closed
almost imperceptibly on Virginia's hand, and Virginia's eyelids
quivered in vague response.</p>

<p>In youth, sadness and silence are near akin. That was the only
kinship they could claim&mdash;this slim, pale scion of a worn-out
line, and the nameless, parentless girl beside her. This kinship
was their only bond&mdash;unadmitted, uncomprehended by themselves;
kinship in love, and the sadness of it; in love, and the loneliness
of it; love&mdash;and the long hours of waiting; night, and the tears
of it.</p>

<p>The sun hung low behind the scented orange grove before Virginia
moved, laying her thin cheek on Shiela's hand.</p>

<p>"Did you see&mdash;that letter&mdash;in the sand?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The writing&mdash;you knew it?... Answer me, Shiela."</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew it."</p>

<p>Virginia lay very still for a while, then covered her face with
both hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear!" breathed Shiela, bending close beside
her.</p>

<p>Virginia lay motionless for a moment, then uncovered her face.</p>

<p>"It is strange," she said, in a colourless, almost inaudible
voice. "You see I am simply helpless&mdash;dependent on your mercy....
Because a woman does not faint over&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>The deep distress in Shiela's eyes held her silent for a space.
She looked back at her, then her brooding gaze shifted to the
laden branches overhead, to the leafy vistas beyond, to the ground
where the golden fruit lay burning in the red, level rays of the
western sun.</p>

<p>"I did not know he was married," she said vacantly.</p>

<p>Swift anger burned in Shiela's cheeks.</p>

<p>"He was a coward not to tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was honourable about it," said Virginia, in the same monotonous
voice. "Do you think I am shameless to admit it? Perhaps I am,
but it is fairer to him. As you know this much, you should know
the truth. And the truth is that he has never said he loved me."</p>

<p>Her face had become pinched and ghastly, but her mouth never
quivered under this final humiliation.</p>

<p>"Did you ever look upon a more brazen and defenceless woman&mdash;"
she began&mdash;and then very quietly and tearlessly broke down in
Shiela's tender arms, face hidden on the young girl's breast.</p>

<p>And Shiela's heart responded passionately; but all she could
find to say was: "Dear &mdash;I know&mdash;indeed, indeed I know&mdash;believe
me I know and understand!" And all she could do was to gather
the humbled woman into her arms until, her grief dry-spent, Virginia
raised her head and looked at Shiela with strange, quenched, tearless
eyes.</p>

<p>"We women are very helpless, very ignorant," she said, "even
the worst of us. And I doubt if in all our lives we are capable
of the harm that one man refrains from doing for an hour.... And
that, I think, is our only compensation.... What theirs may be
I do not know.... Dear, I am perfectly able to go, now.... I think
I see your mother coming."</p>

<p>They walked together to the terrace where Mrs. Cardross had just
arrived in the motor; and Shiela, herself shaken, wondered at
the serene poise with which Virginia sustained ten minutes of
commonplaces and then made her final adieux, saying that she was
leaving on the morning train.</p>

<p>"May we not see each other in town?" she added amiably; and,
to Shiela: "You will let me know when you come North? I shall
miss you until you come."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cardross sent her back in the motor, a trifle surprised
at any intimacy between Shiela and Virginia. She asked a frank
question or two and then retired to write to Mrs. Carrick, who,
uneasy, had at last gone North to find out what financial troubles
were keeping both her husband and her father so long away from
this southland that they loved so well.</p>

<p>Hamil, who was to leave for the North with his aunt and Virginia
early next morning, returned from the forest about sundown, reeking
as usual of the saddle, and rested a moment against the terrace
balustrade watching Mrs. Cardross and Shiela over their tea.</p>

<p>"That boy is actually ill," said the sympathetic matron. "Why
don't you give him some tea, Shiela? Or would you rather have
a little wine and a biscuit, Garret&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"And a few pills," added Shiela gravely. "I found a box of odds
and ends&mdash;powders, pills, tablets, which he might as well finish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shiela! Garret is <em>ill!</em>"</p>

<p>Hamil, busy with his Madeira and biscuit, laughed. He could not
realise he was on the eve of leaving, nor could Shiela.</p>

<p>"Never," said he to the anxious lady, "have I felt better in
my life; and I'm sure it is due to your medicines. It's all very
well for Shiela to laugh at quinine; mosquitoes don't sting her.
But I'd probably be an item in one of those phosphate beds by
this time if you hadn't taken care of me."</p>

<p>Shiela laughed; Hamil in excellent humour went off to dress.
Everybody seemed to be in particularly good spirits that evening,
but later, after dinner, Gray spoke complainingly of the continued
absence of his father.</p>

<p>"As for Acton Carrick, he's the limit," added Gray disgustedly.
"He hasn't been here this winter except for a day or two, and
then he took the train from Miami straight through to New York.
I say, Hamil, you'll look him up and write us about him, won't
you?"</p>

<p>Shiela looked at Hamil.</p>

<p>"Do you understand anything about financial troubles?" she asked
in a bantering voice.</p>

<p>"I've had some experience with my own," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, then, what is the matter with the market?"</p>

<p>"Shall I whisper it?"</p>

<p>"If you are prepared to rhyme it. I dare you!"</p>

<p>It was the rule of the house that anybody was privileged to whisper
at table provided they put what they had to communicate into rhyme.</p>

<p>So he thought busily a moment, then leaned over very gravely
and whispered close to her ear:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Tis money makes the market go;<br/>
When money's high the market's low;<br/>
When money's low the market's right,<br/>
And speculators sleep at night.<br/>
But, dear, there is another mart,<br/>
Where ticks the ticker called my heart;<br/>
And there exhaustless funds await,<br/>
To back my bankrupt trust in Fate;<br/>
For you will find, as I have found,<br/>
The old, old logic yet is sound,<br/>
And love still makes the world go round."

</p>
</div>
<p>"I always knew it," said Shiela contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Knew what, dear?" asked her mother, amused.</p>

<p>"That Mr. Hamil writes those sickening mottoes for Christmas
crackers."</p>

<p>"There are pretty ones in them&mdash;sometimes," said Cecile, reminiscently
spearing a big red strawberry which resembled the popular and
conventional conception of a fat human heart.</p>

<p>Gray, still serious, said: "Unless we are outside of the danger
zone I think father ought to teach me something about business."</p>

<p>"If we blow up," observed Cecile, "I'll do clever monologues
and support everybody. I'd like that. And Shiela already writes
poetry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Shiela, very pink.</p>

<p>"Shiela! You do!"</p>

<p>"I did in school&mdash;" turning pinker under Hamil's tormenting gaze.</p>

<p>"And you do yet! I found an attempt on the floor&mdash;in your flowing
penmanship," continued the pitiless younger sister. "What is there
to blush about? Of course Phil and I were not low enough to read
it, but I'll bet it was about somebody we all know! Do you want
to bet &mdash;Garry?"</p>

<p>"Cecile!" said her mother mildly.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother &mdash;I forgot that I'm not allowed to bet, but
if I was&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shiela, exasperated, looked at her mother, who shook her head
and rose from the table, taking Hamil's arm.</p>

<p>"You little imp!" breathed Shiela fiercely to Cecile, "if you
plague me again I'll inform Mr. Hamil of what happened to you
this morning."</p>

<p>"I don't care; Garry is part of the family," retorted Cecile,
flushed but defiant and not exactly daring to add: "or will be
soon." Then she put both arms around Shiela, and holding her imprisoned:</p>

<p>"<em>Are</em> you in love?&mdash;you darling!" she whispered persuasively.
"Oh, don't commit yourself if you feel <em>that</em> way!... And,
O Shiela, you should have seen Phil Gatewood following me in love-smitten
hops when I wouldn't listen! My dear, the creature managed to
plant both feet on my gown as I fled, and the parquet is <em>so</em>
slippery and the gown so flimsy and, oh, there was a dreadful
ripping sound and we both went down&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shiela was laughing now, holding her sister's gesticulating hands,
as she rattled on excitedly:</p>

<p>"I got to my feet in a blaze of fury, holding my gown on with
both hands&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cissy!"</p>

<p>"And he gave one horror-stricken look and ran&mdash;"</p>

<p>Swaying there together in the deserted dining-room, they gave
way to uncontrolled laughter. Laughter rang out from the living-room,
too, where Gray was informing Mrs. Cardross and Hamil of the untoward
climax to a spring-time wooing; and when Shiela and Cecile came
in the latter looked suspiciously at Hamil, requesting to know
the reason of his mirth.</p>

<p>"Somebody will have to whisper it to you in rhyme," said Hamil;
"it's not fit for prose, Cissy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cardross retired early. Gray went for a spin in his motor.
Cecile, mischievously persuaded that Hamil desired to have Shiela
to himself for half an hour, stifled her yawns and bedward inclinations
and remained primly near them until Gray returned.</p>

<p>Then the four played innocuous Bridge whist until Cecile's yawns
could no longer be disguised; and finally Gray rose in disgust
when she ignored the heart-convention and led him an unlovely
spade.</p>

<p>"How many kinds of a chump can you be in one day?" asked her
wrathful brother.</p>

<p>"Pons longa, vita brevis," observed Hamil, intensely amused.
"Don't sit on her, Gray."</p>

<p>"O dear! O dear!" said Cecile calmly, "I'd rather be stepped
on again than sat on like that!"</p>

<p>"You're a sweet little thing anyway," said Hamil, "even if you
do fall down in Bridge as well as otherwise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shiela! You told Garret!"</p>

<p>"Cunning child," said Hamil; "make her dance the baby-dance,
Shiela!" And he and her sister and brother seized her unwilling
hands and compelled her to turn round and round, while they chanted
in unison:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Cissy's Bridge is falling down,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling down,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling down,<br/>
Cissy's gown is falling down,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady!"

</p>
</div>
<p>"Garry, stop it!... It's only an excuse to hold Shiela's hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Shiela recited very gravely:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Father's in Manhattan town,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting up our money;<br/>
Philip's in the music-room,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling Cis his honey;<br/>
Cissy's sprinting through the hall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to be funny&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>"I <em>won't</em> dance!" cried Cecile. But they sang insultingly:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Rock-a-by Cissy!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip <em>will</em> slop!<br/>
Cissy is angry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Philip won't stop."

</p>
<p>
"If dresses are stepped upon,<br/>
Something will fall,<br/>
Down will come petticoat, Cissy, and all!"

</p>
</div>
<p>"O Garry, how <em>can</em> you!"</p>

<p>"Because you've been too gay lately; you're marked for discipline,
young lady!"</p>

<p>"Who told you? Shiela?&mdash;and it <em>was</em> my newest, dearest,
duck of a gown!... The situation was perfectly horrid, too. What
elephants men are!"</p>

<p>"You know, I'd accept him if I were you&mdash;just to teach him the
value of gowns," suggested Hamil.</p>

<p>But Shiela said seriously: "Phil Gatewood is a nice boy. We all
knew that he was going to ask you. You acted like a ninny, Cis."</p>

<p>"With my gown half off!&mdash;what would <em>you</em> have done?"
demanded the girl hotly.</p>

<p>"Destroyed him," admitted Shiela, "in one way or another, dear.
And now I am going to bed&mdash;if everybody has had enough of Cissy's
Bridge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Me for the hay," observed Gray emphatically.</p>

<p>So they all went up the stairway together, lingering a few moments
on the landing to say good night.</p>

<p>Cecile retired first, bewailing the humiliation of not having
a maid of her own and requesting Shiela to send hers as she was
too sleepy to undress.</p>

<p>Gray caught sight of a moth fluttering around the electric lights
and made considerable noise securing the specimen. After which
he also retired, cyanide jar containing the victim tucked under
his arm.</p>
