<p>It could not have been later than ten o'clock in the morning when a
puncher with sharp eyes might have seen two figures approaching the Bar T
ranch house on horseback. They rode needlessly close together and swung
their clasped and gauntleted hands like happy children.
</p><p>One was a girl into whose radiant eyes a new wonder had come, and the
other a handsome, tanned young man bathed in a deliriously happy
expression.
</p><p>"Isn't it jolly to be married without anyone's knowing?" cried Julie. "Oh,
but won't they be surprised at home?"
</p><p>"Rather!" remarked Bud, with a sobered expression. "I only hope your
father doesn't widow you just as I ride into the yard with the olive
branch."
</p><p>"Stop it, Bud! What puts such awful thoughts into your head?"
</p><p>"Experience. Your father was so mad about my getting the sheep across the
river that he started his punchers walking home that same night, and
nobody has seen him since."
</p><p>Larkin spoke the truth, but little exaggerated. Beef Bissell, humiliated,
beaten, and forced to accept the small end of a deal for once in his life,
had started from the useless cowmen's camp by the Gray Bull the very night
of the crossing. He ordered the men to follow and round up their stampeded
horses and then to ride home.
</p><p>Meanwhile he appropriated one horse that had not been in the corral and
trotted homeward, eaten by chagrin and beside himself with impotent fury.
</p><p>Bud and Julie had found this out the day of their talk concerning Lester,
when they forded the stream on horses and asked for Bissell. Under the
circumstances Bud developed a genius for inspiration that was little short
of marvelous.
</p><p>"What's the use of riding all the way home and having a grand row with
your father?" he asked. "Why not go over to Rattlesnake, where there's a
sky-pilot, and be married? Then we'll go home, and there can't be any row,
because there will only be one party in the mood for it."
</p><p>But the girl demurred. It was cruel to her father and mother, she said,
not to have them present on the greatest day of her life. She allowed it
was mighty ungrateful after all they had done for her. Then Bud took her
hand in his and told her his principal reasons.
</p><p>"I'm a business man, honey, and I've got to start north after Simmy and
the sheep in three or four days," he said. "Shearing is late now, but I
guess we can make it. This trouble has set me behind close to fifteen
thousand dollars, and everything is in a critical state.
</p><p>"I know it don't sound much like a lover, but as soon as we get on our
feet we'll take a honeymoon to Japan that will make you think I'd never
heard of a sheep.
</p><p>"You want your mother and father in on the joy, I know, but it doesn't
seem to me there can be much joy with nine or ten men sitting around
waiting for their necks to be stretched. Does it to you?"
</p><p>"No," said Julie, and shuddered.
</p><p>"Then come along over to Rattlesnake and be married. Then we'll ride back
to the Bar T, so you can see your folks, and I can see Caldwell. We can be
through and away before anything is really done about the rustlers."
</p><p>So it was arranged, and the two were married by an Episcopal clergyman who
had a surplice but no cassock, and whose trouser-legs looked very funny
moving about inside the thin, white material--and Julie nearly laughed out
loud.
</p><p>After the ceremony they had ridden out of town with their equipment and
made their first honeymoon camp in a cool, green place beside a little
brook that had trout in it and sang to them for hours on end.
</p><p>Now, the day afterward, they were on the way home, and not without a few
secret misgivings.
</p><p>As they neared the Bar T a single man rode out to meet them. It was
Lester, who had come the night before and was waiting for Bud, so as to be
present at the interview with Smithy Caldwell, whom he had not yet seen.
</p><p>He congratulated the pair warmly and rode with them to the corral.
</p><p>Suddenly there was a shriek, and Martha Bissell tore out of the
cook-house. She ran to Julie, kissed her, and welcomed her back; then when
she heard the news she picked up her apron to start crying, and dropped it
again, undecided what to do.
</p><p>What with Bissell's safe arrival and Julie's glorious home-coming the poor
woman was nearly out of her mind.
</p><p>The excitement brought Beef Bissell around the house from the front
veranda, where he had been grumbling and swearing all the morning. At
sight of Larkin he halted in his tracks and began to redden. But he got no
farther, for Julie flung herself into his arms, tears of happiness
streaming down her face, and overwhelmed him with caresses.
</p><p>Bissell was mightily relieved to see her. In fact, it had been all his
wife could do to restrain him from starting out to unearth Julie when he
arrived home and found her gone. But Martha said that the girl had gone to
find Larkin, and added that the two were old enough to settle their
troubles between them. So Bissell, remembering his last miserable
interview with his daughter, decided not to interfere.
</p><p>"Father, I'm married; please be happy and good to me," the girl said,
clinging to him, and the fury that had flown to his head like wine died a
natural death. After all, to see her happy was what he most wanted.
</p><p>"Are you sure he will love you always?" he asked gently.
</p><p>"Yes, father, I am. I refused to marry him long ago in Chicago." He kissed
her for the first time in a long while, and then gently disengaged himself
and took a step toward Bud.
</p><p>"Larkin," he said, "yuh were always lucky, but yuh've beat all records for
Wyoming now. I allow yuh can take her away with yuh on one condition."
</p><p>"What's that?"
</p><p>"That yuh never beat her like yuh beat me."
</p><p>"Agreed!" laughed Bud, and grasped the other's hand. "But can you stand a
sheepman in the family?"
</p><p>"I sure can, Larkin. Ever since I seen Jimmie Welsh and his men fight, I
ain't got anythin' against sheepmen."
</p><p>"Jimmie Welsh!" cried Bud. "Tell me, did any of his party come through
alive?"
</p><p>"Jes' Jimmie himself; the boys couldn't kill him, so he's over at Billy
Speaker's mendin' up. Heart's pretty near broke because he hasn't seen yuh
to explain why he's still alive."
</p><p>"Good old Jimmie!" said Bud, the tears leaping to his eyes. "Dearest," he
added, turning to Julie, "there's one more stop on our honeymoon, and
that's at Billy Speaker's to-morrow."
</p><p>Bissell continued the conversation, and asked for the full story of how
Bud had run down and captured the rustlers, saying that the whole cow
country owed him a debt, and if they had only known of the capture in
time would have let his sheep through without protest.
</p><p>"I imagined as much," remarked Bud; "but I didn't care to get them through
that way once I had started the other. I hope, Mr. Bissell, that we can be
friends, although we have been enemies up to now. I'm sorry I had to
sacrifice those cattle of the association, but there was no other way out
of it."
</p><p>"I'll tell yuh this, Larkin," returned Bissell. "Anybody that can beat me
at anything is good enough to be my friend fer life, an' I'm here to state
that yuh could count my friends of that type, before you came, on the
hairs of a hairless dog!"
</p><p>Bud laughed, they shook hands again, and peace was finally made between
them; but not until Beef Bissell had signed away half of the interest in
the Bar T to Julie as her dower.
</p><p>That was a happy and hilarious dinner at the ranch. Some of the cowboys
coming in at noon from near-by ranges heard of the marriage and cheered
the bride lustily when she appeared on the veranda. Bud made himself solid
with the disgruntled punchers by walking out to them and talking over the
battle of Welsh's Butte, while he rolled cigarettes and smoked them one
after another.
</p><p>Shortly afterward, Bud and Lester found themselves in a room with Smithy
Caldwell. The blackmailer, when he saw Lester, fell down in a faint, so
great was the shock to his already wrecked nervous system. The man was
really in a terrible condition both from physical fear and the tormenting
by his comrades. He started at every slight sound, whirled about fearfully
to meet any footfall that sounded near, and trembled with uncontrollable
nervous spasms.
</p><p>To both the Larkins he was a piteous sight, and Bud wondered that the
miserable creature had not gone mad.
</p><p>The wretch fell on his knees and pleaded with them for his life, so that
when Bud put the proposition squarely up to him that he forswear
everything in regard to the Larkin family, he could not accept it eagerly
enough.
</p><p>"But about the papers that you said were in Chicago?" asked Bud.
</p><p>"I lied about them," replied Smithy. "They're sewed in the lining of my
shirt. Give me your knife and I'll get 'em for you."
</p><p>"Give me your shirt and I'll find them," countered Bud; and he presently
did.
</p><p>Together the brothers looked them over. Every bit of incriminating
evidence was there, and as Bud slipped it all into his pocket he gave a
great sigh: "Thank Heaven, that's over!"
</p><p>He did not let Caldwell off, however, without securing from him the
written and signed statement that he wanted. When all was done they let
him go, and now his mind was almost as unbalanced by joy as it had
formerly been by fear.
</p><p>Bissell, knowing Caldwell's condition, had agreed to his being released on
clearing his account with the Larkins, for he realized that the man, in
fearing death, had suffered the penalty a thousand times, and that the
memory would remain with him through life, and perhaps help keep him
straight.
</p><p>Shortly after Bud and Lester had joined the others on the veranda again, a
sudden scream was heard from the bunk-house, followed by the sounds of a
terrible struggle. All hands rushed around to the rear and, with drawn
revolvers, forced an entrance among the sullen rustlers.
</p><p>On the floor in the middle of the room lay Smithy Caldwell, white and
contorted, while Mike Stelton was just rising from his prostrate body,
making sounds in his throat like a wild animal. Smithy was dead.
</p><p>"How'd it happen, boys?" asked Bissell.
</p><p>"This here Caldwell come out an' 'lowed as how he wasn't goin' to swing
like the rest of us, an' he began packin' up his truck. Stelton asked him
about it, an' when Smithy repeated what he said before and got plumb cocky
about it, Mike there smeared him plenty. Then he broke his neck. Smithy
betrayed Stelton, yuh know."
</p><p>There is not much more to tell, except that, three days later, the
rustlers paid the penalty of their lawless daring. It was the biggest
"hangin' bee" Wyoming had ever seen, and was largely attended by men of
all sections who stood for right and justice, if not law and order.
</p><p>Bud and Julie brought pride and sunlight to a slowly recuperating Jimmie
Welsh on their way north, and from him and Billy Speaker heard again the
details of the great fight. Now, if you go to Welsh's Butte, you will see
a tall white shaft rising amid the tumbling of the wretched hogbacks. On
one side are the names of the sheepmen who fell (including Jimmie, who is
still alive), and on the other those of the cowmen. It is the humble
offering of Bud and Julie Larkin.
</p><p>Time has proven that Bud's prophecy in regard to sheep was right. Wyoming
has far more sheep than cattle now, and one of the biggest of the ranches
is the former Bar T, run under the Larkin name, in connection with the
home ranch in Montana.
</p><p>I hope it will not be a shock to some readers to know that the first Bud
and Julie have another Bud and Julie, who are over twenty years of age,
quite old enough to have romances of their own.
</p><p>All their lives they have heard the story of the adventures that brought
their parents together, but all four rather sadly admit that the Free
Range, which Bud fought for so hard, is now almost a thing of the past,
that the great drives have passed never to return, and that the cowboy
himself is a dim figure against the prairie sunset.
