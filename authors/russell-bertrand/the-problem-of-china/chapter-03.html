<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>In order to understand the international position of China, some
facts concerning its nineteenth-century history are indispensable.
China was for many ages the supreme empire of the Far East, embracing
a vast and fertile area, inhabited by an industrious and civilized
people. Aristocracy, in our sense of the word, came to an end
before the beginning of the Christian era, and government was
in the hands of officials chosen for their proficiency in writing
in a dead language, as in England. Intercourse with the West was
spasmodic and chiefly religious. In the early centuries of the
Christian era, Buddhism was imported from India, and some Chinese
scholars penetrated to that country to master the theology of
the new religion in its native home, but in later times the intervening
barbarians made the journey practically impossible. Nestorian
Christianity reached China in the seventh century, and had a good
deal of influence, but died out again. (What is known on this
subject is chiefly from the Nestorian monument discovered in Hsianfu
in 1625.) In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries Roman
Catholic missionaries acquired considerable favour at Court, because
of their astronomical knowledge and their help in rectifying the
irregularities and confusions of the Chinese calendar.[24] Their
globes and astrolabes are still to be seen on the walls of Peking.
But in the long run they could not resist quarrels between different
orders, and were almost completely excluded from both China and
Japan.</p>

<p>In the year 1793, a British ambassador, Lord Macartney, arrived
in China, to request further trade facilities and the establishment
of a permanent British diplomatic representative. The Emperor
at this time was Chien Lung, the best of the Manchu dynasty, a
cultivated man, a patron of the arts, and an exquisite calligraphist.
(One finds specimens of his writing in all sorts of places in
China.) His reply to King George <em>III </em>is given by Backhouse
and Bland.[25] I wish I could quote it all, but some extracts
must suffice. It begins:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
You, O King, live beyond the confines of many seas, nevertheless,<br/>
impelled by your humble desire to partake of the benefits of our<br/>
civilization, you have despatched a mission respectfully bearing<br/>
your memorial.... To show your devotion, you have also sent<br/>
offerings of your country's produce. I have read your memorial:<br/>
the earnest terms in which it is cast reveal a respectful<br/>
humility on your part, which is highly praiseworthy.

</p>
</div>
<p>He goes on to explain, with the patient manner appropriate in
dealing with an importunate child, why George <em>III'</em>s desires
cannot possibly be gratified. An ambassador, he assures him, would
be useless, for:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
If you assert that your reverence for our Celestial Dynasty fills<br/>
you with a desire to acquire our civilization, our ceremonies and<br/>
code of laws differ so completely from your own that, even if<br/>
your Envoy were able to acquire the rudiments of our<br/>
civilization, you could not possibly transplant our manners and<br/>
customs to your alien soil. Therefore, however adept the Envoy<br/>
might become, nothing would be gained thereby.

</p>
<p>
Swaying the wide world, I have but one aim in view, namely, to<br/>
maintain a perfect governance and to fulfil the duties of the<br/>
State; strange and costly objects do not interest me. I ... have<br/>
no use for your country's manufactures. ...It behoves you, O<br/>
King, to respect my sentiments and to display even greater<br/>
devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission<br/>
to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity for your<br/>
country hereafter.

</p>
</div>
<p>He can understand the English desiring the produce of China,
but feels that they have nothing worth having to offer in exchange:</p>

<p>"Our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance
and lacks no product within its own borders. There was therefore
no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians in exchange
for our own produce. But as the tea, silk and porcelain which
the Celestial Empire produces are absolute necessities to European
nations and to yourselves," the limited trade hitherto permitted
at Canton is to continue.</p>

<p>He would have shown less favour to Lord Macartney, but "I do
not forget the lonely remoteness of your island, cut off from
the world by intervening wastes of sea, nor do I overlook your
excusable ignorance of the usages of our Celestial Empire." He
concludes with the injunction: "Tremblingly obey and show no negligence!"</p>

<p>What I want to suggest is that no one understands China until
this document has ceased to seem absurd. The Romans claimed to
rule the world, and what lay outside their Empire was to them
of no account. The Empire of Chien Lung was more extensive, with
probably a larger population; it had risen to greatness at the
same time as Rome, and had not fallen, but invariably defeated
all its enemies, either by war or by absorption. Its neighbours
were comparatively barbarous, except the Japanese, who acquired
their civilization by slavish imitation of China. The view of
Chien Lung was no more absurd than that of Alexander the Great,
sighing for new worlds to conquer when he had never even heard
of China, where Confucius had been dead already for a hundred
and fifty years. Nor was he mistaken as regards trade: China produces
everything needed for the happiness of its inhabitants, and we
have forced trade upon them solely for our benefit, giving them
in exchange only things which they would do better without.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for China, its culture was deficient in one respect,
namely science. In art and literature, in manners and customs,
it was at least the equal of Europe; at the time of the Renaissance,
Europe would not have been in any way the superior of the Celestial
Empire. There is a museum in Peking where, side by side with good
Chinese art, may be seen the presents which Louis <em>XIV </em>made
to the Emperor when he wished to impress him with the splendour
of <em>Le Roi Soleil</em>. Compared to the Chinese things surrounding
them, they were tawdry and barbaric. The fact that Britain has
produced Shakespeare and Milton, Locke and Hume, and all the other
men who have adorned literature and the arts, does not make us
superior to the Chinese. What makes us superior is Newton and
Robert Boyle and their scientific successors. They make us superior
by giving us greater proficiency in the art of killing. It is
easier for an Englishman to kill a Chinaman than for a Chinaman
to kill an Englishman. Therefore our civilization is superior
to that of China, and Chien Lung is absurd. When we had finished
with Napoleon, we soon set to work to demonstrate this proposition.</p>

<p>Our first war with China was in 1840, and was fought because
the Chinese Government endeavoured to stop the importation of
opium. It ended with the cession of Hong-Kong and the opening
of five ports to British trade, as well as (soon afterwards) to
the trade of France, America and Scandinavia. In 1856-60, the
English and French jointly made war on China, and destroyed the
Summer Palace near Peking,[26] a building whose artistic value,
on account of the treasures it contained, must have been about
equal to that of Saint Mark's in Venice and much greater than
that of Rheims Cathedral. This act did much to persuade the Chinese
of the superiority of our civilization so they opened seven more
ports and the river Yangtze, paid an indemnity and granted us
more territory at Hong-Kong. In 1870, the Chinese were rash enough
to murder a British diplomat, so the remaining British diplomats
demanded and obtained an indemnity, five more ports, and a fixed
tariff for opium. Next, the French took Annam and the British
took Burma, both formerly under Chinese suzerainty. Then came
the war with Japan in 1894-5, leading to Japan's complete victory
and conquest of Korea. Japan's acquisitions would have been much
greater but for the intervention of France, Germany and Russia,
England holding aloof. This was the beginning of our support of
Japan, inspired by fear of Russia. It also led to an alliance
between China and Russia, as a reward for which Russia acquired
all the important rights in Manchuria, which passed to Japan,
partly after the Russo-Japanese war, and partly after the Bolshevik
revolution.</p>

<p>The next incident begins with the murder of two German missionaries
in Shantung in 1897. Nothing in their life became them like the
leaving of it; for if they had lived they would probably have
made very few converts, whereas by dying they afforded the world
an object-lesson in Christian ethics. The Germans seized Kiaochow
Bay and created a naval base there; they also acquired railway
and mining rights in Shantung, which, by the Treaty of Versailles,
passed to Japan in accordance with the Fourteen Points. Shantung
therefore became virtually a Japanese possession, though America
at Washington has insisted upon its restitution. The services
of the two missionaries to civilization did not, however, end
in China, for their death was constantly used in the German Reichstag
during the first debates on the German Big Navy Bills, since it
was held that warships would make Germany respected in China.
Thus they helped to exacerbate the relations of England and Germany
and to hasten the advent of the Great War. They also helped to
bring on the Boxer rising, which is said to have begun as a movement
against the Germans in Shantung, though the other Powers emulated
the Germans in every respect, the Russians by creating a naval
base at Port Arthur, the British by acquiring Wei-hai-wei and
a sphere of influence in the Yangtze, and so on. The Americans
alone held aloof, proclaiming the policy of Chinese integrity
and the Open Door.</p>

<p>The Boxer rising is one of the few Chinese events that all Europeans
know about. After we had demonstrated our superior virtue by the
sack of Peking, we exacted a huge indemnity, and turned the Legation
Quarter of Peking into a fortified city. To this day, it is enclosed
by a wall, filled with European, American, and Japanese troops,
and surrounded by a bare space on which the Chinese are not allowed
to build. It is administered by the diplomatic body, and the Chinese
authorities have no powers over anyone within its gates. When
some unusually corrupt and traitorous Government is overthrown,
its members take refuge in the Japanese (or other) Legation and
so escape the punishment of their crimes, while within the sacred
precincts of the Legation Quarter the Americans erect a vast wireless
station said to be capable of communicating directly with the
United States. And so the refutation of Chien Lung is completed.</p>

<p>Out of the Boxer indemnity, however, one good thing has come.
The Americans found that, after paying all just claims for damages,
they still had a large surplus. This they returned to China to
be spent on higher education, partly in colleges in China under
American control, partly by sending advanced Chinese students
to American universities. The gain to China has been enormous,
and the benefit to America from the friendship of the Chinese
(especially the most educated of them) is incalculable. This is
obvious to everyone, yet England shows hardly any signs of following
suit.</p>

<p>To understand the difficulties with which the Chinese Government
is faced, it is necessary to realize the loss of fiscal independence
which, China has suffered as the result of the various wars and
treaties which have been forced upon her. In the early days, the
Chinese had no experience of European diplomacy, and did not know
what to avoid; in later days, they have not been allowed to treat
old treaties as scraps of paper, since that is the prerogative
of the Great Powers&mdash;a prerogative which every single one of them
exercises.</p>

<p>The best example of this state of affairs is the Customs tariff.[27]
At the end of our first war with China, in 1842, we concluded
a treaty which provided for a duty at treaty ports of 5 per cent.
on all imports and not more than 5 per cent on exports. This treaty
is the basis of the whole Customs system. At the end of our next
war, in 1858, we drew up a schedule of conventional prices on
which the 5 per cent. was to be calculated. This was to be revised
every ten years, but has in fact only been revised twice, once
in 1902 and once in 1918.[28] Revision of the schedule is merely
a change in the conventional prices, not a change in the tariff,
which remains fixed at 5 per cent. Change in the tariff is practically
impossible, since China has concluded commercial treaties involving
a most-favoured-nation clause, and the same tariff, with twelve
States besides Great Britain, and therefore any change in the
tariff requires the unanimous consent of thirteen Powers.</p>

<p>When foreign Powers speak of the Open Door as a panacea for China,
it must be remembered that the Open Door does nothing to give
the Chinese the usual autonomy as regards Customs that is enjoyed
by other sovereign States.[29] The treaty of 1842 on which the
system rests, has no time-limit of provision for denunciation
by either party, such as other commercial treaties contain. A
low tariff suits the Powers that wish to find a market for their
goods in China, and they have therefore no motive for consenting
to any alteration. In the past, when we practised free trade,
we could defend ourselves by saying that the policy we forced
upon China was the same as that which we adopted ourselves. But
no other nation could make this excuse, nor can we now that we
have abandoned free trade by the Safeguarding of Industries Act.</p>

<p>The import tariff being so low, the Chinese Government is compelled,
for the sake of revenue, to charge the maximum of 5 per cent,
on all exports. This, of course, hinders the development of Chinese
commerce, and is probably a mistake. But the need of sources of
revenue is desperate, and it is not surprising that the Chinese
authorities should consider the tax indispensable.</p>

<p>There is also another system in China, chiefly inherited from
the time of the Taiping rebellion, namely the erection of internal
customs barriers at various important points. This plan is still
adopted with the internal trade. But merchants dealing with the
interior and sending goods to or from a Treaty Port can escape
internal customs by the payment of half the duty charged under
the external tariff. As this is generally less than the internal
tariff charges, this provision favours foreign produce at the
expense of that of China. Of course the system of internal customs
is bad, but it is traditional, and is defended on the ground that
revenue is indispensable. China offered to abolish internal customs
in return for certain uniform increases in the import and export
tariff, and Great Britain, Japan, and the United States consented.
But there were ten other Powers whose consent was necessary, and
not all could be induced to agree. So the old system remains in
force, not chiefly through the fault of the Chinese central government.
It should be added that internal customs are collected by the
provincial authorities, who usually intercept them and use them
for private armies and civil war. At the present time, the Central
Government is not strong enough to stop these abuses.</p>

<p>The administration of the Customs is only partially in the hands
of the Chinese. By treaty, the Inspector-General, who is at the
head of the service, must be British so long as our trade with
China exceeds that of any other treaty State; and the appointment
of all subordinate officials is in his hands. In 1918 (the latest
year for which I have the figures) there were 7,500 persons employed
in the Customs, and of these 2,000 were non-Chinese. The first
Inspector-General was Sir Robert Hart, who, by the unanimous testimony
of all parties, fulfilled his duties exceedingly well. For the
time being, there is much to be said for the present system. The
Chinese have the appointment of the Inspector-General, and can
therefore choose a man who is sympathetic to their country. Chinese
officials are, as a rule, corrupt and indolent, so that control
by foreigners is necessary in creating a modern bureaucracy. So
long as the foreign officials are responsible to the Chinese Government,
not to foreign States, they fulfil a useful educative function,
and help to prepare the way for the creation of an efficient Chinese
State. The problem for China is to secure practical and intellectual
training from the white nations without becoming their slaves.
In dealing with this problem, the system adopted in the Customs
has much to recommend it during the early stages.[30]</p>

<p>At the same time, there are grave infringements of Chinese independence
in the present position of the Customs, apart altogether from
the fact that the tariff is fixed by treaty for ever. Much of
the revenue derivable from customs is mortgaged for various loans
and indemnities, so that the Customs cannot be dealt with from
the point of view of Chinese interests alone. Moreover, in the
present state of anarchy, the Customs administration can exercise
considerable control over Chinese politics by recognizing or not
recognizing a given <em>de facto</em> Government. (There is no
Government <em>de jure</em>, at any rate in the North.) At present,
the Customs Revenue is withheld in the South, and an artificial
bankruptcy is being engineered. In view of the reactionary instincts
of diplomats, this constitutes a terrible obstacle to internal
reform. It means that no Government which is in earnest in attempting
to introduce radical improvements can hope to enjoy the Customs
revenue, which interposes a formidable fiscal barrier in the way
of reconstruction.</p>

<p>There is a similar situation as regards the salt tax. This also
was accepted as security for various foreign loans, and in order
to make the security acceptable the foreign Powers concerned insisted
upon the employment of foreigners in the principal posts. As in
the case of the Customs, the foreign inspectors are appointed
by the Chinese Government, and the situation is in all respects
similar to that existing as regards the Customs.</p>

<p>The Customs and the salt tax form the security for various loans
to China. This, together with foreign administration, gives opportunities
of interference by the Powers which they show no inclination to
neglect. The way in which the situation is utilized may be illustrated
by three telegrams in <em>The Times</em> which appeared during
January of this year.</p>

<p>On January 14, 1922, <em>The Times</em> published the following
in a telegram from its Peking correspondent:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
It is curious to reflect that this country (China) could be<br/>
rendered completely solvent and the Government provided with a<br/>
substantial income almost by a stroke of the foreigner's pen,<br/>
while without that stroke there must be bankruptcy, pure and<br/>
simple. Despite constant civil war and political chaos, the<br/>
Customs revenue consistently grows, and last year exceeded all<br/>
records by £1,000,000. The increased duties sanctioned by the<br/>
Washington Conference will provide sufficient revenue to<br/>
liquidate the whole foreign and domestic floating debt in a very<br/>
few years, leaving the splendid salt surplus unencumbered for the<br/>
Government. The difficulty is not to provide money, but to find a<br/>
Government to which to entrust it. Nor is there any visible<br/>
prospect of the removal of this difficulty.

</p>
</div>
<p>I venture to think <em>The Times</em> would regard the difficulty
as removed if the Manchu Empire were restored.</p>

<p>As to the "splendid salt surplus," there are two telegrams from
the Peking correspondent to <em>The Times</em> (of January 12th
and 23rd, respectively) showing what we gain by making the Peking
Government artificially bankrupt. The first telegram (sent on
January 10th) is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Present conditions in China are aptly illustrated by what is<br/>
happening in one of the great salt revenue stations on the<br/>
Yangtsze, near Chinkiang. That portion of the Chinese fleet<br/>
faithful to the Central Government&mdash;the better half went over to<br/>
the Canton Government long ago&mdash;has dispatched a squadron of<br/>
gunboats to the salt station and notified Peking that if<br/>
$3,000,000 (about £400,000) arrears of pay were not immediately<br/>
forthcoming the amount would be forcibly recovered from the<br/>
revenue. Meanwhile the immense salt traffic on the Yangtsze has<br/>
been suspended. The Legations concerned have now sent an Identic<br/>
Note to the Government warning it of the necessity for<br/>
immediately securing the removal of the obstruction to the<br/>
traffic and to the operations of the foreign collectorate.

</p>
</div>
<p>The second telegram is equally interesting. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
The question of interference with the Salt Gabelle is assuming a<br/>
serious aspect. The Chinese squadron of gunboats referred to in<br/>
my message of the 10th is still blocking the salt traffic near<br/>
Chingkiang, while a new intruder in the shape of an agent of<br/>
Wu-Pei-Fu [the Liberal military leader] has installed himself in<br/>
the collectorate at Hankow, and is endeavouring to appropriate<br/>
the receipts for his powerful master. The British, French, and<br/>
Japanese Ministers accordingly have again addressed the<br/>
Government, giving notice that if these irregular proceedings do<br/>
not cease they will be compelled to take independent action. The<br/>
Reorganization Loan of £25,000,000 is secured on the salt<br/>
revenues, and interference with the foreign control of the<br/>
department constitutes an infringement of the loan agreement. In<br/>
various parts of China, some independent of Peking, others not,<br/>
the local <em>Tuchuns</em> (military governors) impound the collections<br/>
and materially diminish the total coming under the control of the<br/>
foreign inspectorate, but the balance remaining has been so<br/>
large, and protest so useless, that hitherto all concerned have<br/>
considered it expedient to acquiesce. But interference at points<br/>
on the Yangtsze, where naval force can be brought to bear, is<br/>
another matter. The situation is interesting in view of the<br/>
amiable resolutions adopted at Washington, by which the Powers<br/>
would seem to have debarred themselves, in the future, from any<br/>
active form of intervention in this country. In view of the<br/>
extensive opposition to the Liang Shih-yi Cabinet and the present<br/>
interference with the salt negotiations, the $90,000,000<br/>
(£11,000,000) loan to be secured on the salt surplus has been<br/>
dropped. The problem of how to weather the new year settlement on<br/>
January 28th remains unsolved.

</p>
</div>
<p>It is a pretty game: creating artificial bankruptcy, and then
inflicting punishment for the resulting anarchy. How regrettable
that the Washington Conference should attempt to interfere!</p>

<p>It is useless to deny that the Chinese have brought these troubles
upon themselves, by their inability to produce capable and honest
officials. This inability has its roots in Chinese ethics, which
lay stress upon a man's duty to his family rather than to the
public. An official is expected to keep all his relations supplied
with funds, and therefore can only be honest at the expense of
filial piety. The decay of the family system is a vital condition
of progress in China. All Young China realizes this, and one may
hope that twenty years hence the level of honesty among officials
may be not lower in China than in Europe&mdash;no very extravagant
hope. But for this purpose friendly contact with Western nations
is essential. If we insist upon rousing Chinese nationalism as
we have roused that of India and Japan, the Chinese will begin
to think that wherever they differ from Europe, they differ for
the better. There is more truth in this than Europeans like to
think, but it is not wholly true, and if it comes to be believed
our power for good in China will be at an end.</p>

<p>I have described briefly in this chapter what the Christian Powers
did to China while they were able to act independently of Japan.
But in modern China it is Japanese aggression that is the most
urgent problem. Before considering this, however, we must deal
briefly with the rise of modern Japan&mdash;a quite peculiar blend
of East and West, which I hope is not prophetic of the blend to
be ultimately achieved in China. But before passing to Japan,
I will give a brief description of the social and political condition
of modern China, without which Japan's action in China would be
unintelligible.</p>

nevertheless <em>The Times</em> assumed that his purpose was to
get the administration into the hands of the Chinese on account
of the opportunities of lucrative corruption which it would afford.
I wrote to <em>The Times</em> pointing out that they had confused
the administration with the tariff, and that Mr. Koo was dealing
only with the tariff. In view of the fact that they did not print
either my letter or any other to the same effect, are we to conclude
that their misrepresentation was deliberate and intentional?]</p>
