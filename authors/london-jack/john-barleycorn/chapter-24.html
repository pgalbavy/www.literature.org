Out in the country, at the Belmont Academy, I went to work in a
small, perfectly appointed steam laundry.  Another fellow and
myself did all the work from sorting and washing to ironing the
white shirts, collars and cuffs, and the "fancy starch" of the
wives of the professors.  We worked like tigers, especially as
summer came on and the academy boys took to the wearing of duck
trousers.  It consumes a dreadful lot of time to iron one pair of
duck trousers.  And there were so many pairs of them.  We sweated
our way through long sizzling weeks at a task that was never done;
and many a night, while the students snored in bed, my partner and
I toiled on under the electric light at steam mangle or ironing
board.
<P>
The hours were long, the work was arduous, despite the fact that
we became past masters in the art of eliminating waste motion. 
And I was receiving thirty dollars a month and board--a slight
increase over my coal-shovelling and cannery days, at least to the
extent of board, which cost my employer little (we ate in the
kitchen), but which was to me the equivalent of twenty dollars a
month.  My robuster strength of added years, my increased skill,
and all I had learned from the books, were responsible for this
increase of twenty dollars.  Judging by my rate of development, I
might hope before I died to be a night watchman for sixty dollars
a month, or a policeman actually receiving a hundred dollars with
pickings.
<P>
So relentlessly did my partner and I spring into our work
throughout the week that by Saturday night we were frazzled
wrecks.  I found myself in the old familiar work-beast condition,
toiling longer hours than the horses toiled, thinking scarcely
more frequent thoughts than horses think.  The books were closed
to me.  I had brought a trunkful to the laundry, but found myself
unable to read them.  I fell asleep the moment I tried to read;
and if I did manage to keep my eyes open for several pages, I
could not remember the contents of those pages.  I gave over
attempts on heavy study, such as jurisprudence, political economy,
and biology, and tried lighter stuff, such as history.  I fell
asleep.  I tried literature, and fell asleep.  And finally, when I
fell asleep over lively novels, I gave up.  I never succeeded in
reading one book in all the time I spent in the laundry.
<P>
And when Saturday night came, and the week's work was over until
Monday morning, I knew only one desire besides the desire to
sleep, and that was to get drunk.  This was the second time in my
life that I had heard the unmistakable call of John Barleycorn. 
The first time it had been because of brain-fag.  But I had no
over-worked brain now.  On the contrary, all I knew was the dull
numbness of a brain that was not worked at all.  That was the
trouble.  My brain had become so alert and eager, so quickened by
the wonder of the new world the books had discovered to it, that
it now suffered all the misery of stagnancy and inaction.
<P>
And I, the long time intimate of John Barleycorn, knew just what
he promised me--maggots of fancy, dreams of power, forgetfulness,
anything and everything save whirling washers, revolving mangles,
humming centrifugal wringers, and fancy starch and interminable
processions of duck trousers moving in steam under my flying iron. 
And that's it.  John Barleycorn makes his appeal to weakness and
failure, to weariness and exhaustion.  He is the easy way out. 
And he is lying all the time.  He offers false strength to the
body, false elevation to the spirit, making things seem what they
are not and vastly fairer than what they are.
<P>
But it must not be forgotten that John Barleycorn is protean.  As
well as to weakness and exhaustion, does he appeal to too much
strength, to superabundant vitality, to the ennui of idleness.  He
can tuck in his arm the arm of any man in any mood.  He can throw
the net of his lure over all men.  He exchanges new lamps for old,
the spangles of illusion for the drabs of reality, and in the end
cheats all who traffic with him.
<P>
I didn't get drunk, however, for the simple reason that it was a
mile and a half to the nearest saloon.  And this, in turn, was
because the call to get drunk was not very loud in my ears.  Had
it been loud, I would have travelled ten times the distance to win
to the saloon.  On the other hand, had the saloon been just around
the corner, I should have got drunk.  As it was, I would sprawl
out in the shade on my one day of rest and dally with the Sunday
papers.  But I was too weary even for their froth.  The comic
supplement might bring a pallid smile to my face, and then I would
fall asleep.
<P>
Although I did not yield to John Barleycorn while working in the
laundry, a certain definite result was produced.  I had heard the
call, felt the gnaw of desire, yearned for the anodyne.  I was
being prepared for the stronger desire of later years.
<P>
And the point is that this development of desire was entirely in
my brain.  My body did not cry out for alcohol.  As always,
alcohol was repulsive to my body.  When I was bodily weary from
shovelling coal the thought of taking a drink had never flickered
into my consciousness.  When I was brain-wearied after taking the
entrance examinations to the university, I promptly got drunk.  At
the laundry I was suffering physical exhaustion again, and
physical exhaustion that was not nearly so profound as that of the
coal-shovelling.  But there was a difference.  When I went coal-
shovelling my mind had not yet awakened.  Between that time and
the laundry my mind had found the kingdom of the mind.  While
shovelling coal my mind was somnolent.  While toiling in the
laundry my mind, informed and eager to do and be, was crucified.
<P>
And whether I yielded to drink, as at Benicia, or whether I
refrained, as at the laundry, in my brain the seeds of desire for
alcohol were germinating.
