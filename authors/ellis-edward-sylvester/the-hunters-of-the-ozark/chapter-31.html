<p>It was a thrilling story which Terry Clark had to tell about
his ride on the back of the buffalo, but, after all, it was not
so stirring as the experience which befell Fred Linden, and the
Irish lad declared that it surpassed his own in every respect.</p>

<p>"Thim Winnebagos are gittin' altogether too plintiful," said
he; "whin they come on horseback as will as on foot, there must
be more than we can take care of, though you managed the three
as well as I could have done the same mesilf. And so ye hit one
of 'em whin ye touched off yer gun, did ye?"</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of it, though I am sorry to say that it did
not end his career right away."</p>

<p>"It'll sarve him the good turn of givin' him time to think what
a maan spalpeen he is any way, and that's a good deal. And so
ye say they was mounted on horseback: what has become of thim?"</p>

<p>"They rode in among the trees over yonder, near where we kindled
the fire and cooked the buffalo steak."</p>

<p>Terry walked out to the edge of the prairie, and shading his
eyes, peered in that direction.</p>

<p>"I can see nuthin' of thim; they must have found out that ye
hadn't any frinds there after all the fuss ye made, and it may
be they will come back to sittle with ye."</p>

<p>"If I alone could attend to them, do you think we together have
any thing to fear?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, if it's only thim three, but we have seen so
many of the spalpeens that they won't be loikely to foind much
trouble in scarin' up a few hundred more and makin' it uncomfortable
for us."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Fred, with a sigh, "I am so relieved and thankful
to know how well we got through it all, that I am hopeful we shall
have no great trouble during the rest of the way. We ought to
be able to reach the camp by to-morrow night if we don't have
any interruption."</p>

<p>The young friends surely had good reason to feel grateful for
their deliverance from the perils of the morning, and with hopeful
hearts they walked along the margin of the wood until they came
to the point where the trail turned to the left. Over this they
started at a brisk pace, Fred slightly in advance of his companion,
for the path was not broad enough for them to walk any other way
with freedom.</p>

<p>"Terry," said the elder, "do you think it possible that the three
Winnebagos with whom I had the trouble could be the three that
we met last night, when we were about to cross the stream?"</p>

<p>"Niver," was the emphatic reply; "how could they have got around
so far in front? It was a good many miles the ither way that we
saw the same!"</p>

<p>"I have thought of that, but, you know, we spent several hours
in sleep, during which they might have turned back."</p>

<p>"But where could they have got their horses?"</p>

<p>"They may have had them within easy reach?"</p>

<p>"It couldn't be."</p>

<p>"I guess you are right; we hadn't a very good view of them last
night, though the moon shone on them when they were wading the
stream and I had a fancy that one of them looked like the fellow
I hit when I fired."</p>

<p>"All a fancy," insisted Terry.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no use of guessing, for any way it must be only
a guess; but where do you suppose Deerfoot is?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinkin' of the fellow and it saams to me that it's
time he showed up."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he could have passed us in the night."</p>

<p>"That couldn't be, for he meant to stay near the camp-fire where
we lift him till he found out what the spalpeens were goin' to
do, and he couldn't have got that chance till mornin'."</p>

<p>"Unless they made a start last night."</p>

<p>"Which the same they didn't do."</p>

<p>The boys were more in want of water than food, and fortunately
they had not gone far when they struck another stream, narrow
enough for them to leap across, and which afforded them a draught
with which to quench their thirst.</p>

<p>"Now," said Fred, "since we have had such a good breakfast, we
will think of nothing more to eat until night."</p>

<p>"I don't know about not <em>thinkin'</em> of the same," said
Terry doubtfully, "but I am with ye in agraain' that we won't
go out of the path to hunt any of the same onless&mdash;that is, onless
we should think what I've brought along isn't aqual to our appetites."</p>

<p>"We must have passed considerably more than half the distance
between home and the camp in the mountains," added the elder,
some minutes later; "so, if all goes well, we ought to be with
our friends some time to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p>"I'm of the opinion," remarked the sagacious Terry, "that Deerfut
sint us on ahead last night so as to git us out uv the way; thim
pritty legs of his can travel so fast that he wanted a chance
to stritch the same without waitin' fur us."</p>

<p>"More than likely you are right; whenever he thinks it necessary,
he will branch out ahead of the Winnebagos and overhaul us; so
even though we see nothing of him, we ought not to feel much concern."</p>

<p>"How about the wither, me lad?"</p>

<p>Fred had noticed since resuming their journey, that the sky,
which was clear and sunshiny in the morning, had become overcast.
The sun was no longer visible, and a chilliness in the air warned
them that the fine weather could not last much longer. They had
not only been favored in this respect, but for several days before
leaving home equally charming skies had spanned them. And so,
in accordance with the laws of our changeable climate, a disagreeable
turn was to be expected.</p>

<p>"I was hopeful that it would keep off until we reached camp,"
said Fred, looking up through the tree tops at the darkening sky;
"but that is too much, and we must take it as it comes."</p>

<p>"Push on as fast as ye choose."</p>

<p>Taking his friend at his word, Fred broke into a slow, easy trot,
not much more rapid than an ordinary walking gait, but one which
they could keep up a long time, where the ground was not too rough.
Terry of course did the same, and they covered fully two miles
in that manner, when they slackened their pace before an extensive
rise of the ground. But for that, they would have gone much further
at the same speed.</p>

<p>Some fifteen minutes were spent in clambering up the stony incline,
when they descended into a broad valley, the path still rough
and difficult of passage. They recognized a dull but increasing
roar as made by a rapid torrent, and ere long stopped on the edge
of a stream fifty feet wide, which dashed and foamed over the
rocks, breaking into eddies, and agitated pools, falling in foamy
cataracts and splashing forward again with a rollicking freedom
that formed one of the prettiest and most romantic sights on which
they had ever looked.</p>

<p>Directly at their feet was a curious formation. By some means
at a remote day, a number of hard stones had been flung downward
and given a spinning motion, which, acting on the softer sandstone
beneath, had begun hollowing it out, as if by the chisel of an
engraver. This strange operation had gone on for years, until
a bowl a dozen feet across and half as deep had been formed. It
was almost mathematically round, very smooth and with a tapering
shape to the bottom that made the resemblance to an enormous punch
bowl strikingly accurate.</p>

<p>This formation (which in accordance with the taste prevailing
in all parts of our country, should be christened the "Devil's
Punch Bowl"), was full of limpid water, fed by a slight overflow
from above and overrunning and flowing calmly over the lower rim.
In the bottom lay three stones, looking like cannon balls. These
were the tools with which the stream had carved the Devil's Punch
Bowl. Having done their work, they were resting in the bottom,
where they had lain for a period that could not be guessed.</p>

<p>Out beyond, a thin sheet of the water hung like a transparent
curtain over the edge of the rocks. It was so smooth and unruffled
that it seemed stationary, like a film of glass, but, after striking
the stones below, it broke into foam, whirlpools and eddies, which
helped to form as lovely and picturesque a scene as the most devoted
lover of nature could long to see.</p>

<p>The picture was so pretty indeed that the boys stood for several
minutes lost in admiration. They had never viewed any thing of
the kind, and it was something that would always be a pleasant
memory to them.</p>

<p>But, great as was their admiration, there was a startling question
that came to them: how was this interesting stream to be crossed?</p>

<p>In front and up and down the bank, the eyes searched in vain
for a ford. It was idle to think of ferrying themselves over,
while the cascades, pools, eddies and general "upsetting" of a
broad deep stream, made its passage as perilous as that of the
rapids nearer home in which the two had come so near losing their
lives.</p>

<p>"There is no possible way by which we can reach the other side,"
said Fred, after they had walked a few rods up and down the stream.</p>

<p>"I don't obsarve any way mesilf," was the response of Terry.</p>

<p>"But there <em>must</em> be, for how could father and the rest
have crossed?"</p>

<p>"They may have put up a bridge."</p>

<p>"But where is the bridge? There are no signs of any thing of
the kind," said the bewildered Fred; "they couldn't have made
a bridge without leaving it behind."</p>

<p>"The high water has swipt it away."</p>

<p>Fred stood surveying the stream and the banks, for several minutes,
during which he once more walked back and forth, but he was right
when he said that the place had never been spanned by even the
simplest structure, for it could not have been done without leaving
some traces behind.</p>

<p>This being the case, the mystery was greater than ever; for it
was certain that at that hour their friends were many miles distant
on the other side.</p>

<p>"This is a little ahead of any thing I ever heard tell of," remarked
Fred, taking off his cap and scratching his head, after the fashion
of Terry when he was puzzled.</p>

<p>"It couldn't be," ventured the latter, who also had his cap in
his hand and was stirring up his flaxen locks, "that they carried
a bridge along with 'em."</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"That's what I thought, as me sicond cousin remarked whin they
told him his uncle carried his shillaleh a half mile and passed
two persons without beltin' 'em over the head."</p>

<p>"There's something about this which I can not understand."</p>

<p>Terry turned and looked at him in his quizzical way and solemnly
extended his hand. Fred shook it as he wished, though he was far
from feeling in a sportive mood.</p>

<p>"They <em>must</em> have crossed," he added, replacing his cap
with some violence, compressing his lips and shaking his head
in a determined way; "do you walk up the bank, while I make a
search in the other direction; we <em>must</em> find the explanation."</p>

<p>The proposition was acted upon, Terry clambering carefully along
the slippery bank and over the rocks, until he was fully a hundred
yards from his friend, who busied himself in doing the same thing
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>All at once the Irish lad shouted. Looking up to him, Fred saw
that he was beckoning him to approach.</p>

<p>"I knew there must be something of the kind," thought Fred, who
after much labor placed himself beside his friend.</p>

<p>To his disappointment, Terry had paused before the worst part
of the series of cascades. It was at the broadest portion of the
stream, where the falls, whirlpools, eddies and deep water would
have turned back the most skillful swimmer.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the astonished Fred.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd show you the place where they <em>didn't</em>
cross," was his reply, and then he broke into the merriest laughter,
as well he might, for he had solved the mystery.</p>
