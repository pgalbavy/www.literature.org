<p>IT <em>MUST </em>not be supposed that Tom cared nothing for the
loss of his fortune. He was old enough to know the value of money,
and to realize the great difference it would make in the life
that lay before him. But he was one of those who think it foolish
to cry over spilled milk, and he at once resolved to make the
best of his position. As to the loss of such friends as the Davenports,
he cared little. He had always understood that they cared for
him only because he was rich, and he was neither astonished nor
disappointed at the change which had come over them.</p>

<p>He made two other calls and then returned to his boarding-house.
He went up-stairs to his room and packed his trunk. As he was
thus engaged, Mr. Middleton tapped at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Tom.</p>

<p>Mr. Middleton entered.</p>

<p>"There is a little matter I wished to speak to you about," said
Nathan.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sharp paid your board-bill up to to-day."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>"But there will be one day over, for which no pay has been received."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Tom; "there will be no difficulty about that. Tell
me how much it is, and I will pay you."</p>

<p>Mr. Middleton coughed.</p>

<p>"It can be settled another way," he said. "Mr. Sharp handed me
three dollars for your traveling expenses. I can take it out of
that."</p>

<p>"Just as you like."</p>

<p>"I find," proceeded Nathan, "that one-seventh of twenty dollars
is two dollars and eighty-six cents. I will, therefore, hand you
fourteen cents, and that will make us square."</p>

<p>Tom’s lip curled, for he fully appreciated Mr. Middleton’s meanness.</p>

<p>"Never mind about the change," he said. "Keep the three dollars."</p>

<p>"I am quite ready to pay you the fourteen cents," said Nathan.</p>

<p>"It’s of no consequence. Keep it to remember me by."</p>

<p>"I <em>shall</em> remember you, Thomas," said Mr. Middleton,
whose heart was touched by the unexpected gift. "I am really sorry
that circumstances are to separate us."</p>

<p>"No doubt you’ll miss my money," thought Tom; but it was his
rule to treat others as they treated him, and he answered politely:</p>

<p>"I should prefer to have kept my money, but I must take things
as they come."</p>

<p>"You may get a part of your money back; if you do, I shall be
happy to receive you back into my family on the same terms."</p>

<p>"I can’t tell what my plans will be," said Tom, who could not
pretend that he wished to return. "If I should desire to return,
I will write to you."</p>

<p>Mr. Middleton on second thoughts had thought it best to treat
our hero well, as there was no knowing but some of the bad investments
might turn out better than was expected.</p>

<p>Tom went to bed early. The next morning the Centerville stage
drove round to the door, and he got on board. Mr. Middleton bade
him a cordial farewell, but Mrs. Middleton had less hopes of the
restoration of his fortunes. She coldly said good-by, and Tom
shed no tears at parting.</p>

<p>Before twelve o’clock he entered Mr. Sharp’s office.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, Tom," said the lawyer, rising quickly. "I suppose
you’ve heard the news?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I am heartily sorry," said the lawyer. "I hope you don’t think
it my fault."</p>

<p>"I haven’t heard the particulars," said Tom; "but I felt sure
you were not to blame."</p>

<p>"Sit down, and I’ll tell you all about it," said Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>"I was going to ask that favor," said Tom. "I didn’t get a very
clear idea from Mr. Middleton as to what had happened, or rather
how it happened. He told me I had only a few hundred dollars to
look to now."</p>

<p>"I hope it will be better than that. Ten thousand dollars were
lent to Archibald Armstrong, a New York merchant, who has failed.
His estate will pay something, though very little. If only ten
per cent., that would amount to a thousand. That’s something."</p>

<p>"To be sure it is," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Then you have fifteen thousand dollars invested in mining shares.
They are worth very little, but they will sell for something."</p>

<p>"Do you think I shall get ten per cent. on these?"</p>

<p>"I think you will."</p>

<p>"Why, that will be fifteen hundred more! Really, things are not
so bad as they might be," said Tom cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I am glad you take it so well, Tom. But I can’t offer you any
hope of realizing anything from the balance. It was invested in
merchandise shipped to a foreign port, and the vessel, we have
every reason to believe, is lost."</p>

<p>"Not much chance there," said Tom.</p>

<p>"We had better give up all hopes in that quarter. As to the other
items, you may depend upon my doing my best for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tom warmly. "It is pleasant to get a little
sympathy. I didn’t get much in Plympton."</p>

<p>"From Mr. Middleton, you mean."</p>

<p>"Yes, and others. Mr. and Mrs. Middleton are both as mean as
they can well be. Notwithstanding the liberal board I paid, they
tried to starve me at first, but I wouldn’t stand it, and they
had to improve their fare."</p>

<p>"Didn’t they express any sorrow at losing you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they were sorry enough, but it was at losing the money.
Then there was a lawyer’s family, who were very polite and attentive
to me while I was rich; but as soon as they learned of my reverses,
they tried to look down upon me, but they didn’t succeed very
well," said Tom, with satisfaction. "I gave them as good as they
sent."</p>

<p>"I’ll warrant that, Tom," said Mr. Sharp, laughing. "You generally
do."</p>

<p>"I’d like to get rich again just to turn the tables on them,"
said Tom thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You must take the world as you find it," said the lawyer. "There
are more selfish than unselfish people in it. But you musn’t jump
to the conclusion that all men are mercenary."</p>

<p>"I am sure they are not," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Keep your confidence in human nature, my boy, and you will be
happier. Don’t become a cynic. It would only make you unhappy.
Besides it would be unjust to the large number of really excellent
people, some of whom I hope you will meet. But to come back to
your affairs, what would you like to do?"</p>

<p>"What can I do?"</p>

<p>"You can go to a boarding-school a year without exceeding the
money I have to your credit. Then if you realize what I think
probable, you can continue yet longer, and still have something
to begin the world with."</p>

<p>Tom looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"I am sixteen," he said, "and my education is good, though it
might be better. I have thought I should like to seek my fortune
in the world."</p>

<p>"Don’t decide hastily, Tom. Another year at school would do you
good."</p>

<p>"I know it, and I will take time to consider. But I must know
more of the world first. Give me fifty dollars, and let me go
to New York and look about me. It will keep me there a fortnight.
During that time I will look around and decide how to spend the
next year."</p>

<p>"You have my consent, Tom," said the lawyer. "The city abounds
in temptations, but you are sixteen, and I trust to your good
sense to keep clear of them. When do you want to go?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said Tom promptly.</p>

<p>"Very well. You will stay at my house to-day, and you can take
the morning train for the city to-morrow. The money shall be ready."</p>
