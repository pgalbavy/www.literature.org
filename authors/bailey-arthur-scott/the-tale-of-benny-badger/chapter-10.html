<p>Sure enough! Just as Mr. Coyote had promised, he was on hand the next
night to "help" Benny Badger catch Ground Squirrels.
</p>
<p>Benny regarded Mr. Coyote somewhat coldly, as the two met in the
moonlight.
</p><p>"How's your sore paw?" he asked Mr. Coyote.
</p><p>Now, Mr. Coyote had just come trotting up without the least sign of
lameness. But all at once he began to limp.
</p><p>"My poor paw's no better," he told Benny, as a look of pain crossed his
face.
</p><p>"Let me see it!" Benny said.
</p><p>And Mr. Coyote promptly held out one of his paws.
</p><p>Benny Badger snorted. He seemed quite disgusted.
</p><p>"This is not the same paw you showed me last night," he cried.
</p><p>"My mistake!" said Mr. Coyote easily. And he pulled back that paw and
thrust forth another.
</p><p>Benny Badger bent over it for a moment.
</p><p>"It <u>looks</u> all right," he grumbled.
</p><p>"I can't help that," Mr. Coyote snarled. "It couldn't hurt me any more,
no matter what happened to it."
</p><p>To Mr. Coyote's surprise, Benny Badger seized his paw in his powerful
jaws and held it in a viselike grip.
</p><p>"Ouch!" Mr. Coyote wailed, pulling back quickly--a move which only
caused him greater pain.
</p><p>"Your paw doesn't feel any worse, does it?" Benny Badger asked him as
well as he could, with his mouth so full.
</p><p>"Yes, it does!" Mr. Coyote howled.
</p><p>"Then you must have been mistaken when you said what you did only a
moment ago," Benny told him.
</p><p>"I must have been," Mr. Coyote admitted. . . . "Let me go!" he begged.
</p><p>But Benny Badger's jaws only closed the tighter.
</p><p>"I'll bite you if you don't stop that!" Mr. Coyote threatened.
</p><p>"My skin is very, very tough," Benny said. "And I can hurt you much more
than this if I want to."
</p><p>Mr. Coyote believed what Benny told him. So he made no more threats, but
began to whine piteously.
</p><p>"If you'll let me go I'll do anything you say," he promised.
</p><p>"Will you agree to keep away from me?" Benny Badger asked him.
</p><p>"Yes! Yes!" Mr. Coyote cried. "I promise!"
</p><p>"Good!" said Benny Badger. "I don't need your 'help,' as you call it,
any longer. And if you ever come near me again when I'm hunting for
Ground Squirrels, I'll----"
</p><p>Benny Badger never finished what he was saying, because he let go of Mr.
Coyote just then. And the moment Mr. Coyote felt himself free he leaped
away and tore off on three legs as if he were in a terrible hurry to get
somewhere else.
</p><p>"Much help I'd ever get from him!" Benny Badger grumbled to himself.
"He's too lazy to dig. But he isn't too lazy to grab the Ground
Squirrels that somebody else drives out for him."
