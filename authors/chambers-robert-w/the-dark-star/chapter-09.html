<p>"Long distance calling you, Mr. Stull. One moment, please....
Here's your party," concluded the operator.</p>

<p>Stull, huddled sleepily on his bed, picked up the transmitter
from the table beside him with a frightful yawn.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he inquired sourly.</p>

<p>"It's me &mdash;Ben!"</p>

<p>"Say, Eddie, have a heart, will you! I need the sleep&#11834;"</p>

<p>Brandes' voice was almost jovial:</p>

<p>"Wake up, you poor tout! It's nearly noon&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, wasn't I singing hymns with Doc and Cap till breakfast
time? And believe <em>me</em>, we trimmed the Senator's bunch!
They've got their transportation back to Albany, and that's about
all&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Careful what you say. I'm talking from the Gayfield House. The
Parson got here all right. He's just left. He'll tell you about
things. Listen, Ben, the chauffeur you sent me from Saratoga got
here last evening, too. I went out with him and he drives all
right. Did you look him up?"</p>

<p>"Now, how could I look him up when you gave me only a day to
get him for you?"</p>

<p>"Did he have references?"</p>

<p>"Sure, a wad of them. But I couldn't verify them."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"I forget his name. You ought to know it by now."</p>

<p>"How did you get him?"</p>

<p>"Left word at the desk. An hour later he came to my room with
a couple of bums. I told him about the job. I told him you wanted
a chauffeur willing to go abroad. He said he was all that and
then some. So I sent him on. Anything you don't fancy about him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, I guess. He seems all right. Only I like to know about
a man&#11834;"</p>

<p>"How can I find out if you don't give me time?"</p>

<p>"All right, Ben. I guess he'll do. By the way, I'm starting for
town in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"What's the idea?"</p>

<p>"Ask the Parson. Have you any other news except that you killed
that Albany bunch of grafters?"</p>

<p>"No.... <em>Yes</em>! But it ain't good news. I was going to
call you soon as I waked up&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"There ain't any trouble&mdash;<em>yet</em>. But a certain party has
showed up here&mdash;a very smooth young man whose business is hunting
trouble. Get me?"</p>

<p>After a silence Stull repeated:</p>

<p>"Get me, Eddie?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Listen. A certain slippery party&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Who, damn it? Talk out. I'm in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. Maxy Venem is here!"</p>

<p>The name of his wife's disbarred attorney sent a chill over Brandes.</p>

<p>"What's he doing in Saratoga?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to find out. He was to the races yesterday. He seen
Doc. Of course Doc hadn't laid eyes on you for a year. Oh, no,
indeed! Heard you was somewhere South, down and out. I don't guess
Maxy was fooled none. What we done here in Saratoga is growing
too big to hush up&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What <em>we've</em> done? Whad'ye mean, <em>we</em>? I told
you to work by yourself quietly, Ben, and keep me out of it."</p>

<p>"That's what I done. Didn't I circulate the news that you and
me had quit partnership? And even then you wouldn't take my advice.
Oh, no. You must show up here at the track with a young lady&#11834;"</p>

<p>"How long has Maxy Venem been in Saratoga?" snapped Brandes.</p>

<p>"He told Doc he just come, but Cap found out he'd been here a
week. All I hope is he didn't see you with the Brookhollow party&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you think he <em>did</em>?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Eddie. Max is a smooth guy&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Find out what he knows! Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Who? Me? Me try to make Maxy Venem talk? That snake? If he isn't
on to you now, that would be enough to put him wise. Act like
you had sense, Eddie. Call that <em>other matter</em> off and
slide for town&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I can't, Ben."</p>

<p>"You got to!"</p>

<p>"I <em>can't</em>, I tell you."</p>

<p>"You're nutty in the head! Don't you suppose that Max is wise
to what I've been doing here? And don't you suppose he knows damn
well that you're back of whatever I do? If you ain't crazy you'll
call that party off for a while."</p>

<p>Brandes' even voice over the telephone sounded a trifle unnatural,
almost hoarse:</p>

<p>"I can't call it off. <em>It's done.</em>"</p>

<p>"What's done?"</p>

<p>"What I told you I was going to do."</p>

<p>"<em>That!</em>"</p>

<p>"The Parson married us."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Wait! Parson Smawley married us, in church, assisted by the
local dominie. I didn't count on the dominie. It was her father's
idea. He butted in."</p>

<p>"Then is it&mdash;is it&#11834;?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm not sure about. You see, the Parson did it,
but the dominie stuck around. Whether he got a half nelson on
me I don't know till I ask. Anyway, I expected to clinch things&mdash;later&mdash;so
it doesn't really matter, unless Max Venem means bad. Does he,
do you think?"</p>

<p>"He <em>always</em> does, Eddie."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Well, then, I'll wait for a cable from you. And
if I've got to take three months off in Paris, why I've got to&mdash;that's
all."</p>

<p>"Good God! What about Stein? What about the theaytre?"</p>

<p>"<em>You'll</em> handle it for the first three months.... Say,
I've got to go, now. I think she's waiting&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"My&mdash;wife."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Yes. The chauffeur took her back to the house in the car to
put something in her suitcase that she forgot. I'm waiting for
her here at the Gayfield House. We're on our way to town. Going
to motor in. Our trunks have gone by rail."</p>

<p>After a silence, Stull's voice sounded again, tense, constrained:</p>

<p>"You better go aboard tonight."</p>

<p>"That's right, too."</p>

<p>"What's your ship?"</p>

<p>"<em>Lusitania.</em>"</p>

<p>"What'll I tell Stein?"</p>

<p>"Tell him I'll be back in a month. You look out for my end. I'll
be back in time."</p>

<p>"Will you cable me?"</p>

<p>"Sure. And if you get any later information about Max today,
call me at the Knickerbocker. We'll dine there and then go aboard."</p>

<p>"I get you.... Say, Eddie, I'm that worried! If this break of
yours don't kill our luck&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it! I'm going to fight for what I got till
someone hands me the count. She's the first thing I ever wanted.
I've got her and I guess I can keep her.... And listen: there's
nothing like her in all God's world!"</p>

<p>"When did you do&mdash;it?" demanded Stull, coldly.</p>

<p>"This morning at eleven. I just stepped over here to the garage.
I'm talking to you from the bar. She's back by this time and waiting,
I guess. So take care of yourself till I see you."</p>

<p>"Same to you, Eddie. And be leery of Max. He's <em>bad</em>.
When they disbar a man like that he's twice as dangerous as he
was. His ex-partner, Abe Grittlefeld, is a certain party's attorney
of record. Ask yourself what you'd be up against if that pair
of wolves get started after you! You know what Max would do to
you if he could. And Minna, too!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry."</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> worrying! And you ought to. You know what you
done to Max. Don't think he ever forgets. He'll do you if he can,
same as Minna will."</p>

<p>Brandes' stolid face lost a little of its sanguine colour, where
he stood in the telephone box behind the bar of the Gayfield House.</p>

<p>Yes, he knew well enough what he had once done to the disbarred
lawyer out in Athabasca when he was handling the Unknown and Venem,
the disbarred, was busy looking out for the Athabasca Blacksmith,
furnishing the corrupt brains for the firm of Venem and Grittlefeld,
and paying steady court to the prettiest girl in Athabasca, Ilse
Dumont.</p>

<p>And Brandes' Unknown had almost killed Max Venem's blacksmith;
Brandes had taken all Venem's money, and then his girl; more than
that, he had "made" this girl, in the theatrical sense of the
word; and he had gambled on her beauty and her voice and had won
out with both.</p>

<p>Then, while still banking her salary to reimburse himself for
his trouble with her, he had tired of her sufficiently to prove
unfaithful to his marriage vows at every opportunity. And opportunities
were many. Venem had never forgiven him; Ilse Dumont could not
understand treachery; and Venem's detectives furnished her with
food for thought that presently infuriated her.</p>

<p>And now she was employing Max Venem, once senior partner in the
firm of Venem and Grittlefeld, to guide her with his legal advice.
She wanted Brandes' ruin, if that could be accomplished; she wanted
her freedom anyway.</p>

<p>Until he had met Rue Carew he had taken measures to fight the
statutory charges, hoping to involve Venem and escape alimony.
Then he met Ruhannah, and became willing to pay for his freedom.
And he was still swamped in the vile bog of charges and countercharges,
not yet free from it, not yet on solid ground, when the eternal
gambler in him suggested to him that he take the chance of marrying
this young girl before he was legally free to do so.</p>

<p>Why on earth did he want to take such a chance? He had only a
few months to wait. He had never before really cared for any woman.
He loved her&mdash;as he understood love&mdash;as much as he was capable
of loving. If in all the world there was anything sacred to him,
it was his sentiment regarding Rue Carew. Yet, he was tempted
to take the chance. Even she could not escape his ruling passion;
at the last analysis, even she represented to him a gambler's
chance. But in Brandes there was another streak. He wanted to
take the chance that he could marry her before he had a right
to, and get away with it. But his nerve failed. And, at the last
moment, he had hedged, engaging Parson Smawley to play the lead
instead of an ordained clergyman.</p>

<p>All these things he now thought of as he stood undecided, worried,
in the telephone booth behind the bar at the Gayfield House. Twice
Stull had spoken, and had been bidden to wait and to hold the
wire.</p>

<p>Finally, shaking off the premonition of coming trouble, Brandes
called again:</p>

<p>"Ben?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm listening."</p>

<p>"I'll stay in Paris if there's trouble."</p>

<p>"And throw Stein down?"</p>

<p>"What else is there to do?"</p>

<p>"Well, you can wait, can't you? You don't seem to be able to
do that any more, but you better learn."</p>

<p>"All right. What next?"</p>

<p>"Make a quick getaway. <em>Now!</em>"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm going at once. Keep me posted, Ben. Be good!"</p>

<p>He hung up and went out to the wide, tree-shaded street where
Ruhannah sat in the runabout awaiting him, and the new chauffeur
stood by the car.</p>

<p>He took off his straw hat, pulled a cap and goggles from his
pocket. His man placed the straw hat in the boot.</p>

<p>"Get what you wanted, Rue?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you."</p>

<p>"Been waiting long?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't think so."</p>

<p>"All right," he said cheerily, climbing in beside her. "I'm sorry
I kept you waiting. Had a business matter to settle. Hungry?"</p>

<p>Rue, very still and colourless, said no, with a mechanical smile.
The chauffeur climbed to the rumble.</p>

<p>"I'll jam her through," nodded Brandes as the car moved swiftly
westward. "We'll lunch in Albany on time."</p>

<p>Half a mile, and they passed Neeland's Mills, where old Dick
Neeland stood in his boat out on the pond and cast a glittering
lure for pickerel.</p>

<p>She caught a glimpse of him&mdash;his sturdy frame, white hair, and
ruddy visage&mdash;and a swift, almost wistful memory of young Jim
Neeland passed through her mind.</p>

<p>But it was a very confused mind&mdash;only the bewildered mind of
a very young girl&mdash;and the memory of the boy flashed into its
confusion and out again as rapidly as the landscape sped away
behind the flying car.</p>

<p>Dully she was aware that she was leaving familiar and beloved
things, but could not seem to realise it&mdash;childhood, girlhood,
father and mother, Brookhollow, the mill, Gayfield, her friends,
all were vanishing in the flying dust behind her, dwindling, dissolving
into an infinitely growing distance.</p>

<p>They took the gradual slope of a mile-long hill as swallows take
the air; houses, barns, woods, orchards, grain fields, flew by
on either side; other cars approaching passed them like cannon
balls; the sunlit, undulating world flowed glittering away behind;
only the stainless blue ahead confronted them immovably&mdash;a vast,
magnificent goal, vague with the mystery of promise.</p>

<p>"On this trip," said Brandes, "we may only have time to see the
Loove and the palaces and all like that. Next year we'll fix it
so we can stay in Paris and you can study art."</p>

<p>Ruhannah's lips formed the words, "Thank you."</p>

<p>"Can't you learn to call me Eddie?" he urged.</p>

<p>The girl was silent.</p>

<p>"You're everything in the world to me, Rue."</p>

<p>The same little mechanical smile fixed itself on her lips, and
she looked straight ahead of her.</p>

<p>"Haven't you begun to love me just a little bit, Rue?"</p>

<p>"I like you. You are very kind to us."</p>

<p>"Don't your affection seem to grow a little stronger now?" he
urged.</p>

<p>"You are so kind to us," she repeated gratefully; "I like you
for it."</p>

<p>The utterly unawakened youth of her had always alternately fascinated
and troubled him. Gambler that he was, he had once understood
that patience is a gambler's only stock in trade. But now for
the first time in his career he found himself without it.</p>

<p>"You said," he insisted, "that you'd love me when we were married."</p>

<p>She turned her child's eyes on him in faint surprise:</p>

<p>"A wife loves her husband always, doesn't she?"</p>

<p>"Do <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall.... I haven't been married very long&mdash;long
enough to feel as though I am really married. When I begin to
realise it I shall understand, of course, that I love you."</p>

<p>It was the calm and immature reply of a little girl playing house.
He knew it. He looked at her pure, perplexed profile of a child
and knew that what he had said was futile&mdash;understood that it
was meaningless to her, that it was only confusing a mind already
dazed&mdash;a mind of which too much had been expected, too much demanded.</p>

<p>He leaned over and kissed the cold, almost colourless cheek;
her little mechanical smile came back. Then they remembered the
chauffeur behind them and Brandes reddened. He was unaccustomed
to a man on the rumble.</p>

<p>"Could I talk to mother on the telephone when we get to New York?"
she asked presently, still painfully flushed.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, of course."</p>

<p>"I just want to hear her voice," murmured Rue.</p>

<p>"Certainly. We can send her a wireless, too, when we're at sea."</p>

<p>That interested her. She enquired curiously in regard to wireless
telegraphy and other matters concerning ocean steamers.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>In Albany her first wave of loneliness came over her in the stuffy
dining-room of the big, pretentious hotel, when she found herself
seated at a small table alone with this man whom she seemed, somehow
or other, to have married.</p>

<p>As she did not appear inclined to eat, Brandes began to search
the card for something to tempt her. And, glancing up presently,
saw tears glimmering in her eyes.</p>

<p>For a moment he remained dumb as though stunned by some sudden
and terrible accusation&mdash;for a moment only. Then, in an unsteady
voice:</p>

<p>"Rue, darling. You must not feel lonely and frightened. I'll
do anything in the world for you. Don't you know it?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I tell you," he said in that even, concentrated voice of his
which scarcely moved his narrow lips, "I'm just crazy about you.
You're my own little wife. You're all I care about. If I can't
make you happy somebody ought to shoot me."</p>

<p>She tried to smile; her full lips trembled; a single tear, brimming,
fell on the cloth.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't mean to be silly.... But &mdash;Brookhollow
seems&mdash;ended&mdash;forever...."</p>

<p>"It's only forty miles," he said with heavy joviality. "Shall
we turn around and go back?"</p>

<p>She glanced up at him with an odd expression, as though she hoped
he meant it; then her little mechanical smile returned, and she
dried her eyes naïvely.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I cannot seem to get used to being married,"
she said. "I never thought that getting married would make me
so&mdash;so&mdash;lonely."</p>

<p>"Let's talk about art," he suggested. "You're crazy about art
and you're going to Paris. Isn't that fine."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Sure, it's fine. That's where art grows. Artville is Paris'
other name. It's all there, Rue&mdash;the Loove, the palaces, the Latin
Quarter, the statues, the churches, and all like that."</p>

<p>"What is the Louvre like?" she asked, tremulously, determined
to be brave.</p>

<p>As he had seen the Louvre only from the outside, his imaginary
description was cautious, general, and brief.</p>

<p>After a silence, Rue asked whether he thought that their suitcases
were quite safe.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he smiled. "I checked them."</p>

<p>"And you're sure they are safe?"</p>

<p>"Of course, darling. What worries you?"</p>

<p>And, as she hesitated, he remembered that she had forgotten to
put something into her suitcase and that the chauffeur had driven
her back to the house to get it while he himself went into the
Gayfield House to telephone Stull.</p>

<p>"What was it you went back for, Rue?" he asked.</p>

<p>"One thing I went back for was my money."</p>

<p>"Money? What money?"</p>

<p>"Money my grandmother left me. I was to have it when I married&mdash;six
thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"You mean you have it in your suitcase?" he asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"Yes, half of it."</p>

<p>"A cheque?"</p>

<p>"No, in hundreds."</p>

<p>"Bills?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I gave father three thousand. I kept three thousand."</p>

<p>"In bills," he repeated, laughing. "Is your suitcase locked?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I insisted on having my money in cash. So Mr. Wexall, of
the Mohawk Bank, sent a messenger with it last evening."</p>

<p>"But," he asked, still immensely amused, "why do you want to
travel about with three thousand dollars in bills in your suitcase?"</p>

<p>She flushed a little, tried to smile:</p>

<p>"I don't know why. I never before had any money. It is&mdash;pleasant
to know I have it."</p>

<p>"But I'll give you all you want, Rue."</p>

<p>"Thank you.... I have my own, you see."</p>

<p>"Of course. Put it away in some bank. When you want pin money,
ask me."</p>

<p>She shook her head with a troubled smile.</p>

<p>"I couldn't ask anybody for money," she explained.</p>

<p>"Then you don't have to. We'll fix your allowance."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I have my money, and I don't need it."</p>

<p>This seemed to amuse him tremendously; and even Rue laughed a
little.</p>

<p>"You are going to take your money to Paris?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"To buy things?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Just to have it with me."</p>

<p>His rather agreeable laughter sounded again.</p>

<p>"So <em>that</em> was what you forgot to put in your suitcase,"
he said. "No wonder you went back for it."</p>

<p>"There was something else very important, too."</p>

<p>"What, darling?"</p>

<p>"My drawings," she explained innocently.</p>

<p>"Your drawings! Do you mean you've got them, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I want to take them to Paris and compare them with the
pictures I shall see there. It ought to teach me a great deal.
Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Are you crazy to study?" he asked, touched to the quick by her
utter ignorance.</p>

<p>"It's all I dream about. If I could work that way and support
myself and my father and mother&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But, Rue! Wake up! We're married, little girl. You don't have
to work to support anybody!"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>forgot," said the girl vaguely, her confused grey
eyes resting on his laughing, greenish ones.</p>

<p>Still laughing, he summoned the waiter, paid the reckoning; Ruhannah
rose as he did; they went slowly out together.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk beside their car stood the new chauffeur, smoking
a cigarette which he threw away without haste when he caught sight
of them. However, he touched the peak of his cap civilly, with
his forefinger.</p>

<p>Brandes, lighting a cigar, let his slow eyes rest on the new
man for a moment. Then he helped Rue into the tonneau, got in
after her, and thoughtfully took the wheel, conscious that there
was something or other about his new chauffeur that he did not
find entirely to his liking.</p>
