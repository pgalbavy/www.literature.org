<p>Meanwhile the fugitives in the cavern were placed in a situation
almost as grave as that of Gravity Gimp himself.</p>

<p>The departure of the latter created a stir that lasted some minutes
after Mr. Brainerd drew back and whispered to his friends the
fact that the servant had reached the ground above, and was unmolested.</p>

<p>"He must pass over the spot where the man stood who fired the
shot," said Maggie Brainerd, "and he ought to find out who he
is."</p>

<p>"Provided the stranger remains there, which isn't likely."</p>

<p>The reader knows that this hope was disappointed, for the negro
saw nothing of the man nor did he once think of him, while making
the reconnoissance that resulted in his own capture.</p>

<p>"Now," said the father, who felt as though his responsibility
had increased since the departure of the African, "Aunt Peggy,
you must keep yourself and the girls as far back and away from
the mouth of the cavern as you can, for there's no telling when
a stray bullet may come in."</p>

<p>"I will see that we are all out of harm's way, while we are here,"
said Habakkuk McEwen.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt of that as far as yourself is concerned, but
your personal safety is not a matter of concern to any of us here."</p>

<p>"But, Richard," ventured Aunt Peggy, coming close to the elbow
of her brother-in-law, "what are <em>you</em> going to do?"</p>

<p>"I shall stay where I am, at the mouth of the cave, watching
that point yonder. It won't do to relax our vigilance, for a single
minute of such neglect may prove fatal."</p>

<p>"But you will be struck, if a shot is sent into this place."</p>

<p>"No one is safer than I; do you see?"</p>

<p>As he spoke he indicated a large, long stone, some twenty or
more inches in length and a third as thick.</p>

<p>"It's a loose piece of the rock, which I chanced upon. I laid
it in front of me across my line of vision to rest my gun upon.
That gives me an easy position, while I have a good breast-work."</p>

<p>"But don't you have to look over the line of protection, so as
to keep good watch?" asked Maggie.</p>

<p>"There must be a certain amount of danger, no matter how well
we are protected."</p>

<p>But there was one fact which Mr. Brainerd, with all his forethought,
failed to take note of: his anxiety was so great that he believed
he could do without sleep for a week, and yet he should have known
that if he undertook to lie down on his face and keep watch, no
solicitude nor effort of the will could keep him awake.</p>

<p>The only recourse is that of continual motion, as is the case
with the sailor on watch or the sentinel on guard at night.</p>

<p>In fact, no posture could have been more wooing to the gentle
goddess that steals away our senses ere we are aware.</p>

<p>The females, as Mr. Brainerd had suggested, withdrew to the rear
of the cavern, placing themselves at one side where no bullet
could reach them, unless fired from the mass of rocks that the
father was watching with such close attention.</p>

<p>Habakkuk McEwen, located near them, attempted a conversation,
but no one showed any disposition to take part, and Aunt Peggy
invited him so energetically to keep quiet that he complied.</p>

<p>As Mr. Brainerd lay extended on the flat, rocky floor of the
cavern, with his gun cocked and pointed outward, he asked himself
more than one question which he could not answer.</p>

<p>Looking as hopefully as he might at the situation, he saw no
ground for encouragement.</p>

<p>Gravity Gimp had departed, and he did not believe he would be
able to come back. In this belief the settler was correct, for
the African never placed foot in the cavern again.</p>

<p>He had gone, taking one of the guns with him, and so much power
of defense was abstracted from the little party without any possible
return.</p>

<p>Although Habakkuk McEwen seemed at first to be an acquisition,
yet the cowardice shown a short time before so displeased Mr.
Brainerd that, despite the necessity of union, he forbore almost
entirely to have any communication with him.</p>

<p>Stretched out thus in the rocky shelter, with his gun thrust
forward and his eyes fixed on the danger-point, the stillness
became oppressive.</p>

<p>The deep, hollow roar of the forest, the soft murmur of the river,
the distant crack of a rifle, and the shout of some wild Indian
or flying fugitive&mdash;all these came to the listener with impressive
distinctness.</p>

<p>But, at the same time, as I have shown, the situation was favorable
to slumber, and ere the watcher suspected it, his eyes closed
and his senses floated away.</p>

<p>He breathed so softly that none of his friends suspected he was
sleeping. Indeed, almost at the same time, Habakkuk drifted into
dreamland, his loud breathing being audible to all who were awake.</p>

<p>Eva Brainerd, with her head resting in the lap of her loved sister,
slept like an infant, but Maggie and Aunt Peggy kept as alert
as when they were in the small boat, pushing across the Susquehanna.
No two persons could realize the peril of their situation more
than did these two, who talked in low tones, and speculated as
to what was the best thing to do, if, indeed, they could do anything
at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Brainerd did not sleep long, his senses coming back to him
as softly as they had departed. When fully himself, his position
was the same as taken at first. His gun was still pointed toward
the column of rocks, that was more plainly visible than before,
now that the moon was higher in the sky.</p>

<p>He felt as though he had been sleeping for hours, though in reality
it was no more than fifteen minutes, and a shudder passed over
him at the consciousness that a hundred red men might have leaped
across the chasm in front without danger to themselves.</p>

<p>He could only hope that such advantage had not been taken of
his remissness. Hearing the faint murmur of Maggie and Aunt Peggy's
voices as they spoke to each other, he was on the point of turning
to ask them a question, when something like a shadow flitted across
the space which he was guarding.</p>

<p>He rubbed his eyes and looked again; another and then another
whisked by, like the flight of birds, and then he awoke to the
fact that, while he lay there, with his loaded and aimed rifle,
three Indian warriors had leaped across the opening that separated
them from the mass of rocks which commanded the situation.</p>

<p>Even supposing none had made the leap while the watcher was asleep,
it was certain that the number named had secured the shelter,
and now they could pick off every one in the cavern at their convenience,
without risk to themselves.</p>

<p>"I don't see any use of trying to hold out," muttered the watcher,
in the bitterness of spirit; "at such a time as this, when the
wretches get started, it seems as though everything favors them.
I thought since that shot came so opportunely, that we would receive
more help from the same source, but he, too, has slumbered, and
while he slept&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Father," broke in Maggie, "I hear some one overhead, just where
that person was when he fired his gun."</p>

<p>The girl was right, for her parent detected it at the same moment:
it was as if some one were scraping his feet over the upper surface
of the rocks, though it was impossible to imagine the meaning
of his action.</p>

<p>Then as the three listened, they thought he was gradually working
toward the edge of the ravine, until suddenly the sound stopped.</p>

<p>No one spoke, and all were fairly holding their breath, when,
to their dismay, a pair of feet, quickly followed by a pair of
shapely legs, appeared in front of the cavern, slowly descending,
and bringing more of the owner in sight.</p>

<p>Some one was lowering himself from the top of the ravine, with
the purpose of dropping in the path in front and entering the
cavern!</p>

<p>"It is an Injin," called out Aunt Peggy; "why don't you shoot
him, Richard, before he kills us all?"</p>

<p>At that instant the stranger dropped with a light bound, and,
looking around in the gloom, asked:</p>

<p>"Are you all here?"</p>

<p>The moment he spoke, the voice was recognized as that of Fred
Godfrey.</p>
