<p>The days that followed were troubled days and they brought to
Conscience's cheeks an accentuated pallor. Under her eyes were smudges
that made them seem very large and wistful. The minister was once more
in his arm chair, a little more broken, a little more fiercely
uncompromising of aspect, but the one normal solution of such a spent
and burdensome life: the solution of death, stood off from him. Upon his
daughter, whose lips were sealed against any protest by the belief that
even a small excitement might kill him, he vented long and bigoted
sermons of anathema. In these sermons, possibly, he was guilty of the
very heresy of which his daughter had said he was so intolerant. He
seemed to doubt himself, these days, that Satan wore a spiked tail and a
pair of cloven hoofs. Of late he rather leaned to the belief that the
Arch-tempter had returned to walk the earth in the guise of a young
Virginian and that he had assumed the incognito of Stuart Farquaharson.
</p>
<p>One refrain ran through every waking hour and troubled his sleep with
fantastic dreams. God commanded him to strip this tempter of his
habiliments of pretense and show the naked wickedness of his soul to the
girl's deluded eye. To that fancied command he dedicated himself as
whole-heartedly as a bloodhound gives itself to the man hunt.
</p><p>To Stuart one day, as they walked together in the woods, Conscience
confessed her fear that this constant hammering of persecution would
eventually batter down her capacity for sane judgment and she ended with
a sweeping denunciation of every form of bigotry.
</p><p>"Dear," he answered with the gravity of deep apprehension, "you say
that and you believe it and yet this same instinct of self-martyrdom is
the undertow of your life flood. If your given name didn't happen to be
Conscience your middle name would be just that."
</p><p>"I suppose I have a conscience of a sort--but a different, sort, I hope.
Is that such a serious fault?" she asked, and because the strain of
these days had tired and rubbed her nerves into the sensitiveness of
exhaustion, she asked it in a hurt and wounded tone.
</p><p>"It's an indispensable virtue," he declared. "Your father's conscience
was a virtue, too, until it ran amuck and became a savage menace. When
you were a child," he went on, speaking so earnestly that his brow was
drawn into an expression which she mistook for a frown of disapproval,
"your most characteristic quality was an irrepressible sense of humor.
It gave both sparkle and sanity to your outlook. It held you immune to
all bitterness."
</p><p>"And now?" She put the query somewhat faintly.
</p><p>"Now, more than ever, because the life around you is grayer, it's vital
that you cling to your golden talisman. To let it go means to be lost in
the fog."
</p><p>They were strolling along a woodland path and she was a few steps in
advance of him. He saw her shoulders stiffen, but it was not until he
overtook her that he discovered her eyes to be sparkling with tears.
</p><p>"What is it, dearest?" he contritely demanded, and after a long pause
she said:
</p><p>"Nothing, except that I feel as if you had slapped me in the face."
</p><p>"I! Slapped you in the face!" He could only reÃ«cho her words in
bewilderment and distress. "I don't understand."
</p><p>Laying a hand on her arm, he halted her in a place where the setting sun
was spilling streams of yellow light through the woodland aisles and
then her lips trembled; her eyes filled and she pressed both hands over
her face. After a moment she looked up and dashed the tears
contemptuously away.
</p><p>"No, I know you don't understand, dear. It's my own fault. I'm a weak
little fool," she said, "But it's all gotten horribly on my nerves. I
can't help it."
</p><p>"For God's sake," he begged, "tell me what I did or said?" And her words
came with a weary resignation.
</p><p>"I think you had better put me out of your life, Stuart. I've just
realized how things really are--you've told me. I can't go because I'm
chained to the galley. While Father lives my place is here."
</p><p>She broke off suddenly and his face took on a stunned amazement.
</p><p>"Out of my life!" exclaimed the man almost angrily. "Abandon you to all
this abysmal bigotry and--to this pharisaical web of ugly dogmas!
Conscience, you're falling into a melancholy morbidness."
</p><p>As she looked at him and saw the old smoldering fire in his eyes that
reminded her of his boyhood, a pathetic smile twisted the corners of her
lips.
</p><p>"Yes--I guess that's just it, Stuart," she said slowly, "You see, I may
have to stay here until, as you put it, I'm all faded out in the fog. If
I've changed so much already there's no telling what years of it will
turn me into."
</p><p>Stuart Farquaharson caught her impulsively in his arms and his words
came in tumultuous fervor.
</p><p>"What I said wasn't criticism," he declared. "God knows I couldn't
criticize you. You ought to know that. This is the nearest we've ever
come to a quarrel, dear, since the Barbara Freitchie days, and it's
closer than I want to come. Besides, it's not just your laughter that I
love. It's all of you: heart, mind, body: the whole lovely trinity of
yourself. I mean to wage unabated war against all these forces that are
trying to stifle your laughter into the pious smirk of the pharisee.
There's more of what God wants the world to feel in one peal of your
laughter than in all the psalms that this whole people ever whined
through their noses. You're one of the rare few who can go through life
being yourself--not just a copy and reflection of others. A hundred
years ago your own people would probably have burned you as a witch for
that. They've discontinued that form of worship now, but the cut of
their moral and intellectual jib is, in some essentials, the same. Thank
God, you have a different pattern of soul and I want you to keep it."
</p><p>She drew away from him and slowly her face cleared of its misery and the
eyes flashed into their old mischief-loving twinkle. "That's the first
real rise I've had out of you," she declared, "since Barbara waved the
stars and stripes at you. Then you were only defending Virginia, but now
you've assumed the offensive against all New England."
</p><p>But even in that mild disagreement they had, as he said, come nearer
than either liked to a quarrel--and neither could quite forget it. Both
felt that the thin edge of what might have been a disrupting wedge had
threatened their complete harmony.
</p><p>Because he could mark the transition of this thing called conscience
into an obsession, and because he, too, was worn in patience and
stinging with resentment against the injustice of the father, he fought
hotly, and his denunciations of various influences were burning and
scornful. So slowly but dangerously there crept into their arguments the
element of contention. Hitherto Stuart had made no tactical mistakes. He
had endured greatly and in patience, but now he was unconsciously
yielding to the temptation of assailing an abstract code in a fashion
which her troubled judgment might translate into attacks upon her
father. Out of that attitude was born for her a hard dilemma of
conflicting loyalties. It was all a fabric woven of gossamer threads,
but Gulliver was bound into helplessness by just such Lilliputian
fetters.
</p><p>Late one night, when the moon was at two-thirds of fullness and the air
touched with frost, Stuart abandoned the bed upon which he had been
restlessly tossing for hours. He kindled a pipe and sat meditating, none
too cheerfully, by the frail light of a bayberry candle. Through the
narrow corridors and boxed-in stair wells of a ramshackle hotel, came no
sounds except the minors of the night. Somewhere far off a dog barked
and somewhere near at hand a traveling salesman snored. In the flare and
sputter of the charring wick and melting wax shadows lengthened and
shortened like flapping flags of darkness.
</p><p>Then the jangle of the telephone bell in the office ripped the stillness
with a discordant suddenness which Farquaharson thought must arouse the
household, but the snoring beyond the wall went on, unbroken, and there
was no sound of a footfall on the creaking stair. At last Stuart,
himself, irritated by the strident urgency of its repetitions, reached
for his bath robe and went down. The clapper still trembled with the
echo of its last vibrations as he put the receiver to his ear and
answered.
</p><p>Then he started and his muscles grew taut, for the other voice was that
of Conscience and it shook with terrified unevenness and a tremulous
faintness like the leaping and weakening of a fevered pulse. He could
tell that she was talking guardedly with her lips close to the
transmitter.
</p><p>"I had to speak to you without waiting for morning," she told him,
recognizing his voice, "and yet--yet I don't know what to say."
</p><p>Recognizing from the wild note that she was laboring under some
unnatural strain, he answered soothingly, "I'm glad you called me,
dear."
</p><p>"What time is it?" she demanded next and when he told her it was well
after midnight she gave a low half-hysterical laugh. "I couldn't
sleep.... Father spent the afternoon exhorting me ... he was trying to
make me promise not to see you again ... and I was trying to keep him
from exciting himself." Her voice was so tense now as to be hardly
recognizable. "Every few minutes it looked as if he were about to fly
into a passion.... You know what that would mean ... and of course
I--I--couldn't promise."
</p><p>She paused for breath, but before he could speak, rushed on.
</p><p>"It's been an absolute reign of terror. Every nerve in my body is
jumping and quivering.... I think I'm going mad."
</p><p>"Listen." The man spoke as one might to a child who has awakened,
terrified, out of a nightmare and is afraid to be alone. "I'm coming out
there. You need to talk to some one. I'll leave the car out of hearing
in the road."
</p><p>"No, no!" she exclaimed in a wildly fluttering timbre of protest. "If he
woke up it would be worse than this afternoon--it might kill him!"
</p><p>But Stuart answered her with a quiet note of finality. "Wrap up
well--it's cool outside--and meet me on the verandah. We can talk more
safely that way than by 'phone. I'm going to obey the doctor
implicitly--unless you fail to meet me. If you do that--" he paused a
moment before hanging up the receiver--"I'll knock on the door."
</p><p>The moon had not yet set as he started on foot up the driveway of the
manse and the bare trees stood out stark and inky against the silver
mists. Before he was more than half-way to the house he saw her coming
to meet him, casting backward glances of anxiety over her shoulder.
</p><p>She was running with a ghostlike litheness through the moonlight, her
eyes wide and frightened and her whole seeming one of unreasoning panic
so that the man, who knew her dauntlessness of spirit, felt his heart
sink.
</p><p>"You shouldn't have done it," she began in a reproachful whisper. "You
shouldn't have come!" But he only caught her in his arms and held her so
close to his own heart that the wild palpitation of her bosom was calmed
against its steadiness. Her arms went gropingly round his neck and
clutched him as if he were the one stable thing that stood against an
allied ferocity of wind and wave.
</p><p>"You needed me," he said. "And when you need me I come--even if I have
to come like a burglar."
</p><p>The eyes which she raised to his face were tearless--but hardly sane.
She was fear-ridden by ghosts that struck at her normality and she
whispered, "Suppose he died by my fault?"
</p><p>At all costs, the lover resolved, Conscience must leave this place for a
time--until she could return with a stabler judgment. But just now he
could not argue with her.
</p><p>"We'll be very quiet," he said reassuringly. "If you hear any sound in
the house you can go back. You're overwrought, dearest, and I've only
come to be near you. Nobody will see me except yourself, but if at any
time before daylight you want me, come to your window and raise the
blind. I'll be where I can see."
</p><p>For a while she clung to him silently, her breath coming fast. About
them the moon shed a softness of pale silver and old ivory. The silence
seemed to carry a wordless hymn of peace and though they stood in shadow
there was light enough for lovers' eyes. The driven restlessness that
had made Conscience doubt her sanity was slowly yielding to a sense of
repose, as the tautened anguish of a mangled body relaxes to the balm of
an anesthetic. Slowly the slenderly curved and graciously proportioned
modeling of her lithe figure quieted from spasmodic unrest and the wild
racing measure of her heart-beat calmed. Then she turned up her face.
Her eyes cleared and her lips tilted their corners in a smile.
</p><p>"I'm a horrid little demon," she declared in a voice freighted with
self-scorn, but no longer panic-stricken. "I've always hated a coward,
and I'm probably the most amazingly craven one that ever lived. I do
nothing but call on you to fight my battles for me when I can't hold my
own."
</p><p>"You're an adorable little saint, with an absurd leaning toward
martyrdom," he fervently contradicted. "Why shouldn't you call on me?
Aren't you fighting about me?"
</p><p>Her dark eyes were for a moment serene because she was treasuring this
moment of moonlight and the respite of love against the chances of
to-morrow.
</p><p>"Anyhow you came--" she said, "and since you did there's at least one
more fight left in me." Then her voice grew again apprehensive. "It was
pretty bad before ... just hearing you preached against and being afraid
to reply because ... of the warning. Now he wants my promise that I'll
dismiss you forever ... and the worst of it is that he'll pound on it to
the end. What am I to do?"
</p><p>"Is there any question?" he gravely asked her. "<u>Could</u> you make that
promise?"
</p><p>"No--no!" He felt the figure in his arms flinch at the words, "There's
no question of <u>that</u>, but how am I to keep him from raging himself to
death?"
</p><p>"Hasn't the doctor warned him that he mustn't excite himself?"
</p><p>The dark head nodded and the fingers of the hands about his neck
tightened. "Of course," she said. "But there you have the tyranny of
weakness again. I must make the fight to keep him alive. He would
regard it as going righteously to death for his beliefs. That's just
the goodness-gone-wrongness of it all."
</p><p>"Blessed are the self-righteous," mused Farquaharson half aloud, "for
they shall supply their own absolution." To himself he was saying, "The
wretched old hellion!"
</p><p>"And then you see, after all," she added with the martyr's sophistry,
"in the fight for you, I'm only fighting for myself and in doing what I
can for him I'm trying to be unselfish."
</p><p>"Listen," the man spoke carefully, "that, too, is the
goodness-gone-wrongness as you call it; the sheer perversion of a duty
sense. If it were just myself to be thought of, perhaps I couldn't fight
you on a point of conscience. But it isn't just me--not if you love me."
</p><p>"Love you!" He felt the thrilled tremor that ran through her from head
to foot, and that made her bosom heave stormily. The moon had sunk a
little and the shadow in which they were standing had crawled onward so
that on her head fell a gleam of pale light, kindling her eyes and
touching her temples under the sooty shadows of her hair. Her lips were
parted and her voice trembled with the solemnity of a vow, too sacred to
be uttered without the fullest frankness. "In every way that I know how
to love, I love you! Everything that a woman can be to a man I want to
be to you and all that a woman can give to a man, I want to give to
you."
</p><p>It was he who trembled then and became unsteady with the intoxication of
triumph.
</p><p>"Then I'll fight for you, while I have breath, even if it means fighting
with you."
</p><p>Suddenly she caught at his arm with a spasmodic alarm, and he turned his
head as the screeching whine of a window sounded in the stillness. The
effort to raise it cautiously was indicated not by any noiselessness
but by the long duration of the sound. Then a woman's head with hair in
tight pigtails stood out against the pallid light of a bedroom lamp,
turned low, and the whispered challenge came out to them. "Who's out
there?"
</p><p>"Ssh!" cautioned the girl, tensely. "It's I, Auntie. Don't wake Father."
</p><p>Grudgingly the window creaked down and for seconds which lengthened
themselves interminably to the anxious ears of the pair in the shadows,
they waited with bated breath. Then Stuart whispered, "You must go to
sleep now."
</p><p>The rest of the far-spent night Stuart stood guard outside the house.
Once, a half hour after Conscience had gone in, her blind rose and she
stood silhouetted against the lamp-light. The man stepped out of his
shadow and raised a hand, and she waved back at him. Then the lamp went
out, and he surrendered himself to thought and resolves--and mistakes.
This submission to the tyranny of weakness had gone too far. She must go
away. He must take up the fight aggressively. He did not realize that he
who was fighting for her sense of humor had lost his own. He did not
foresee that he was preparing to throw the issue on dangerous ground,
pitting his stubbornness against her stubbornness, and raising the old
duel of temperaments to combat--the immemorial conflict between puritan
and cavalier.
