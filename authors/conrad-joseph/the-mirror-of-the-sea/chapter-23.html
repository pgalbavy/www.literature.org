<p> And so much depends upon the craft which, made by man, is one
with man, that the sea shall wear for him another aspect.  I remember
once seeing the commander—officially the master, by courtesy the
captain—of a fine iron ship of the old wool fleet shaking his
head at a very pretty brigantine.  She was bound the other way. 
She was a taut, trim, neat little craft, extremely well kept;
and on that serene evening when we passed her close she looked
the embodiment of coquettish comfort on the sea.  It was somewhere
near the Cape—<em>The</em> Cape being, of course, the Cape of
Good Hope, the Cape of Storms of its Portuguese discoverer.  And
whether it is that the word "storm" should not be pronounced upon
the sea where the storms dwell thickly, or because men are shy
of confessing their good hopes, it has become the nameless cape—the
Cape <em>tout court</em>. The other great cape of the world, strangely
enough, is seldom if ever called a cape.  We say, "a voyage round
the Horn"; "we rounded the Horn"; "we got a frightful battering
off the Horn"; but rarely "Cape Horn," and, indeed, with some
reason, for Cape Horn is as much an island as a cape. The third
stormy cape of the world, which is the Leeuwin, receives generally
its full name, as if to console its second-rate dignity.  These
are the capes that look upon the gales.</p>

<p>The little brigantine, then, had doubled the Cape.  Perhaps she
was coming from Port Elizabeth, from East London—who knows?  It
was many years ago, but I remember well the captain of the wool-clipper
nodding at her with the words, "Fancy having to go about the sea
in a thing like that!"</p>

<p>He was a man brought up in big deep-water ships, and the size
of the craft under his feet was a part of his conception of the
sea.  His own ship was certainly big as ships went then.  He may
have thought of the size of his cabin, or—unconsciously, perhaps—have
conjured up a vision of a vessel so small tossing amongst the
great seas.  I didn’t inquire, and to a young second mate the
captain of the little pretty brigantine, sitting astride a camp
stool with his chin resting on his hands that were crossed upon
the rail, might have appeared a minor king amongst men.  We passed
her within earshot, without a hail, reading each other’s names
with the naked eye.</p>

<p>Some years later, the second mate, the recipient of that almost
involuntary mutter, could have told his captain that a man brought
up in big ships may yet take a peculiar delight in what we should
both then have called a small craft.  Probably the captain of
the big ship would not have understood very well.  His answer
would have been a gruff, "Give me size," as I heard another man
reply to a remark praising the handiness of a small vessel.  It
was not a love of the grandiose or the prestige attached to the
command of great tonnage, for he continued, with an air of disgust
and contempt, "Why, you get flung out of your bunk as likely as
not in any sort of heavy weather."</p>

<p>I don’t know.  I remember a few nights in my lifetime, and in
a big ship, too (as big as they made them then), when one did
not get flung out of one’s bed simply because one never even attempted
to get in; one had been made too weary, too hopeless, to try. 
The expedient of turning your bedding out on to a damp floor and
lying on it there was no earthly good, since you could not keep
your place or get a second’s rest in that or any other position. 
But of the delight of seeing a small craft run bravely amongst
the great seas there can be no question to him whose soul does
not dwell ashore.  Thus I well remember a three days’ run got
out of a little barque of 400 tons somewhere between the islands
of St. Paul and Amsterdam and Cape Otway on the Australian coast. 
It was a hard, long gale, gray clouds and green sea, heavy weather
undoubtedly, but still what a sailor would call manageable.  Under
two lower topsails and a reefed foresail the barque seemed to
race with a long, steady sea that did not becalm her in the troughs. 
The solemn thundering combers caught her up from astern, passed
her with a fierce boiling up of foam level with the bulwarks,
swept on ahead with a swish and a roar: and the little vessel,
dipping her jib-boom into the tumbling froth, would go on running
in a smooth, glassy hollow, a deep valley between two ridges of
the sea, hiding the horizon ahead and astern.  There was such
fascination in her pluck, nimbleness, the continual exhibition
of unfailing seaworthiness, in the semblance of courage and endurance,
that I could not give up the delight of watching her run through
the three unforgettable days of that gale which my mate also delighted
to extol as "a famous shove."</p>

<p>And this is one of those gales whose memory in after-years returns,
welcome in dignified austerity, as you would remember with pleasure
the noble features of a stranger with whom you crossed swords
once in knightly encounter and are never to see again.  In this
way gales have their physiognomy.  You remember them by your own
feelings, and no two gales stamp themselves in the same way upon
your emotions.  Some cling to you in woebegone misery; others
come back fiercely and weirdly, like ghouls bent upon sucking
your strength away; others, again, have a catastrophic splendour;
some are unvenerated recollections, as of spiteful wild-cats clawing
at your agonized vitals; others are severe, like a visitation;
and one or two rise up draped and mysterious, with an aspect of
ominous menace.  In each of them there is a characteristic point
at which the whole feeling seems contained in one single moment.
Thus there is a certain four o’clock in the morning in the confused
roar of a black and white world when coming on deck to take charge
of my watch I received the instantaneous impression that the ship
could not live for another hour in such a raging sea.</p>

<p>I wonder what became of the men who silently (you couldn’t hear
yourself speak) must have shared that conviction with me.  To
be left to write about it is not, perhaps, the most enviable fate;
but the point is that this impression resumes in its intensity
the whole recollection of days and days of desperately dangerous
weather.  We were then, for reasons which it is not worth while
to specify, in the close neighbourhood of Kerguelen Land; and
now, when I open an atlas and look at the tiny dots on the map
of the Southern Ocean, I see as if engraved upon the paper the
enraged physiognomy of that gale.</p>

<p>Another, strangely, recalls a silent man.  And yet it was not
din that was wanting; in fact, it was terrific.  That one was
a gale that came upon the ship swiftly, like a parnpero, which
last is a very sudden wind indeed.  Before we knew very well what
was coming all the sails we had set had burst; the furled ones
were blowing loose, ropes flying, sea hissing—it hissed tremendously—wind
howling, and the ship lying on her side, so that half of the crew
were swimming and the other half clawing desperately at whatever
came to hand, according to the side of the deck each man had been
caught on by the catastrophe, either to leeward or to windward. 
The shouting I need not mention—it was the merest drop in an ocean
of noise—and yet the character of the gale seems contained in
the recollection of one small, not particularly impressive, sallow
man without a cap and with a very still face.  Captain Jones—let
us call him Jones—had been caught unawares.  Two orders he had
given at the first sign of an utterly unforeseen onset; after
that the magnitude of his mistake seemed to have overwhelmed him. 
We were doing what was needed and feasible.  The ship behaved
well.  Of course, it was some time before we could pause in our
fierce and laborious exertions; but all through the work, the
excitement, the uproar, and some dismay, we were aware of this
silent little man at the break of the poop, perfectly motionless,
soundless, and often hidden from us by the drift of sprays.</p>

<p>When we officers clambered at last upon the poop, he seemed to
come out of that numbed composure, and shouted to us down wind:
"Try the pumps." Afterwards he disappeared.  As to the ship, I
need not say that, although she was presently swallowed up in
one of the blackest nights I can remember, she did not disappear. 
In truth, I don’t fancy that there had ever been much danger of
that, but certainly the experience was noisy and particularly
distracting—and yet it is the memory of a very quiet silence that
survives.</p>
