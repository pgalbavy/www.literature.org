<p>"I wished to give yez a pleasant surprise, as the doctor said
when he told the man that his wife was dead," remarked Tim, in
explanation of his conduct. "Had there really been any of the
red gintlemen around I'd have told you soon enough."</p>

<p>Our young friends were too well pleased at the intelligence to
feel other than good natured, and they gladly forgave Tim for
his trespass upon their patience. Without waiting further they
walked hastily forward, and a moment later stood by the camp-fire.</p>

<p>Three men, apparently, had just aroused themselves from slumber,
and were now stirring around making preparations for their breakfast.
They were shaggy, unshorn, grimy-looking fellows, who had "run
wild" for several years, but who had not necessarily lost their
humanity, even though they had in a great degree lost its outward
semblance. In the center, a large bundle of sticks were burning
quite briskly, and one of the men was turning and watching some
meat that was cooking over it. The others had evidently just returned
from the river, for their red temples and foreheads still glistened
with moisture which sparkled like dew on their patriarchal beards.</p>

<p>They were rough, hardy-looking fellows, but Elwood felt little
apprehension as he stepped forward and said:</p>

<p>"Good morning, gentlemen!"</p>

<p>He who was cook turned his head, but a hot drop of moisture from
the steaming meat at that moment flew in his eye, and clapping
his finger to it, he muttered something, and forthwith and instantly
gave his exclusive attention to his culinary duties.</p>

<p>The second man was rubbing his face with a piece of coarse cloth,
and he suddenly paused with his black eyes glaring over the top,
his face resembling the head of some huge animal clambering over
the edge of a rock, and who, having just gained a foothold, is
looking hurriedly around for his prey.</p>

<p>The third was combing his hair, and just at this moment it was
moistened and sticking straight over his forehead like the horn
of an animal. He would run the comb through with his right hand
and then smooth the hair with his left. He stopped with both arms
crooked over his head, and wheeled around like an automaton, and
stared at the boy a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>"Well, there! Why didn't you ring the door-bell? I say, youngster,
come forward and give us a grip of your hand. Halloo! you've got
your brother with you!"</p>

<p>"Not my brother, but my cousin, Howard Lawrence."</p>

<p>The two boys shook hands with the three, and the grip that they
received from the horny palms made them wince with pain.</p>

<p>"But where'd you come from? We don't see a couple of youngsters
dressed up in your style promenading 'round in these parts every
day. Where'd you come from?"</p>

<p>"The steamer on which we took passage the other day from Panama,
was burned off the coast, and we got ashore on a raft."</p>

<p>"Be you the only ones?"</p>

<p>"No; there were quite a number that escaped."</p>

<p>"Where be they?"</p>

<p>"They were carried away by a vessel while we had wandered inland."</p>

<p>"And you two&mdash;halloo! here's your grandfather!"</p>

<p>"No; that is Tim O'Rooney, a good friend of ours."</p>

<p>"Your humble sarvint!" saluted the Irishman, removing his hat,
making a profound bow and scraping a large foot upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Well, there! We're glad to see you. What's all your names?"</p>

<p>They were given several times, and then carefully spelled at
the request of the large-whiskered man, who desired that no mistake
might be made.</p>

<p>"You may call me Ned Trimble, and that ugly-looking fellow 'tending
to the fire is George Wakeman, and that horrid-looking chap scrubbing
off his dirty face, is Alfred Wilkins. Neither of them know much,
and I brought them along to black my boots and dress my hair."</p>

<p>It looked as though Ned was a sort of a wag, for his companions
smiled as if they were used to that thing. He continued:</p>

<p>"We're a party of hunters that have been in Californy for the
last five years, and I rather guess I've prospected through every
part of it."</p>

<p>"You must be rich by this time."</p>

<p>"Rich!" laughed Ned Trimble. "Well there, we're everything but
rich. Somehow or other we hain't had the luck. We sold a claim
up in the diggings for five hundred dollars, and the next week
the party sold it for fifteen thousand. That's the way it has
always gone with us; but we are going to be rich yet&mdash;ain't we,
boys."</p>

<p>"Yes, if we only live long enough," replied Wakeman.</p>

<p>"I told you that chap hadn't much sense," remarked Ned, addressing
his three visitors. "He doesn't know enough to answer a question
as he oughter. I've been trying to teach him something, but I
shall have to give it up as a bad job. Been to breakfast?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>"Thought you hadn't. Cook, put up another slice, douse it in
butter, salt and pepper, and serve it up as you used to do when
I employed you at the Astor. Gentlemen, how do you like it, rare
or well done?"</p>

<p>All made answer that they were not particular, and Ned replied
thereunto as follows:</p>

<p>"Sensible fellows! If you don't care what you get, you won't
have to care much for what you don't get. What will you select
as a dessert? Plum, rice, bread, or cherry pudding? Apple, mince,
cranberry, plum, peach, or lemon pie? Cup-custard, tapioca, watermelon,
citron, or sherry, maderia, or port. Order which ever you choose,
gentlemen, it don't make any difference to us. We can give you
one just as well as the other."</p>

<p>"I suppose you can," laughed Howard; "so we'll not take the trouble
to order any."</p>

<p>"All right; as you please, gentlemen. We haven't any turkey or
oysters left so you will have to put up with a little antelope
that we shot yesterday afternoon. Fine condition for this time
of year, and the best kind of flesh to starve to death on."</p>

<p>"We haven't had a taste of it yet; but we devoured a goodly piece
of a mountain sheep."</p>

<p>"Just so. I was going to speak of a mountain sheep, if my servants
hadn't interrupted me so often with inquiries as to how they should
make the wine sauce. Ah! I see our meal is ready; we will therefore
repair to the banquet hall."</p>

<p>The six took their seats upon the leaves, and ate the meal in
the usual primitive manner, verifying the adage, "hunger is the
best sauce."</p>

<p>Ned Trimble enlivened the meal in his usual loquacious manner;
and after a great many words and circumlocution, the fact was
discovered that he and his friends had spent the last five years
in California, not having visited a civilized post within two
years.</p>

<p>Disgusted with their ill success in the Sacramento Valley, they
had pulled up stakes and started off to hunt new fields for themselves.
They were very cheerful and hopeful, and according to their accounts
had encountered every imaginable danger of the California wilds.</p>

<p>Elwood inquired whether they had met any grizzly bears.</p>

<p>"Grizzly bears!" repeated Ned, stopping just as he was about
to insert a huge piece of meat in his mouth. "Grizzly bears? Well,
there! <em>We've lived among 'em!</em>"</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I tracked a big grizzly in the Sierra Nevada for two days
and then I stopped."</p>

<p>"What made you stop?"</p>

<p><em>"I concluded the bear tracks were getting a little too fresh!"</em></p>
