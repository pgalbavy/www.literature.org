<p>Mr. G. R. Burkhill overwhelmed Ben Mayberry with thanks for the
heroic manner in which he saved his niece and strove to save his
sister. He offered the boy a handsome reward, but I am glad to
say Ben refused to accept it. He promised to write the boy concerning
the little one, but he must have forgotten his promise, as a long
time passed without anything being heard from him.</p>

<p>When I discovered that the seedy lounger about our office had
carefully taken down the cipher telegram addressed to Burkhill,
I was indignant, for it was well known that one of the most important
duties which the telegraph companies insist upon is the inviolability
of the messages intrusted to their wires. Nothing less than a
peremptory order from the court is sufficient to produce the telegrams
placed in our care.</p>

<p>I was on the point of leaving my desk and compelling the impudent
stranger to surrender the cipher he had surreptitiously secured,
but I restrained myself and allowed him to go without suspecting
my knowledge of his act.</p>

<p>"Ben," said I, addressing my young friend, whom I trusted beyond
any of the older operators, "did you notice that fellow who just
went out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I have seen him before. He followed me home last night,
and after I went in the house, he walked up and down the pavement
for more than half an hour. He was very careful, but I saw him
through the blinds."</p>

<p>"Has he ever said anything to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, except in the office."</p>

<p>"He took down every letter of that cipher telegram you just received
for Mr. Burkhill."</p>

<p>The boy was surprised and sat a minute in deep thought.</p>

<p>"Mr. Melville," he said, "if you have no objection, I shall study
out that cipher."</p>

<p>"That I think is impossible; it has been prepared with care,
and it will take a greater expert than you to unravel it."</p>

<p>Ben smiled in his pleasing way as he answered:</p>

<p>"I am fond of unraveling puzzles, and I believe I can take this
apart."</p>

<p>"I will be surprised if you succeed; but if you do, keep it a
secret from everyone but myself."</p>

<p>"You may depend on that."</p>

<p>The odd times which Ben could secure through the day were spent
in studying the mysterious letters; but when he placed it in his
pocket at night and started for home, he had not caught the first
glimmer of its meaning.</p>

<p>But he was hopeful and said he would never give it up until he
made it as clear as noonday, and I knew that if it was within
the range of accomplishment, he would keep his word. I have told
enough to show my readers he was unusually intelligent and quick-witted,
but I am free to confess that I had scarcely a hope of his success.</p>

<p>"I've got it!"</p>

<p>That was the whispered exclamation with which Ben Mayberry greeted
me the next morning when he entered the office.</p>

<p>"No! You're jesting," I answered, convinced, at the same time,
that he was in earnest.</p>

<p>"I'll soon show you," was his exultant response.</p>

<p>"How was it you struck the key?"</p>

<p>"That is hard to tell, more than you can explain how it is, after
you have puzzled your brain for a long time over an arithmetical
problem, it suddenly becomes clear to you."</p>

<p>He sat down by my desk.</p>

<p>"I figured and studied, and tried those letters every way I could
think of until midnight, and was on the point of going to bed,
when the whole thing flashed upon me. You know, Mr. Melville,
that in trying to unravel a cipher, the first thing necessary
is to find the key-word, for it must be there somewhere; and if
you look sharp enough it will reveal itself. One single letter
gave it to me."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"If you will look at the telegram," said Ben, spreading it out
before me, "you will notice that in one instance only is a single
letter seen standing by itself. That is the letter 'b,' which
I concluded must stand for the article 'a,' for I know of no other,
unless it is 'I.' Now, the letter 'b' is the second one in the
alphabet, and stands next in order to 'a.' If this system is followed
throughout the cipher, we have only to take, instead of the letters
as written, the next in order as they occur in the alphabet. But
when I tried it on the following word, it failed entirely. Luckily
I tested the second in the same manner, and I was surprised to
find it made a perfect word, viz.: 'chance.' The third came to
naught, but the fourth developed into 'your.' That proved that
every other word of the message was constructed in this manner,
and it did not take me long to bring them out into good English.
This was a big help, I can tell you, and it was not long before
I discovered that in the alternate words the system reversed;
that is, instead of taking the letter immediately succeeding,
the writer had used that which immediately precedes it in the
alphabet. Applying this key to the telegram, it read thus:</p>

<p>"'Must wait till fall; Sam has a better chance south. Your bank
will keep.'"</p>

<p>"Now," added Ben, who was warranted in feeling jubilant over
his success, "that is a very ordinary cipher&mdash;one which hundreds
would make out without trouble. Had the writer run his letters
all together&mdash;that is, without any break between the words &mdash;I
would have been stumped. Besides, he uses no blind words, as he
ought to have done; and it looks very much as if he calls everything
by its right name, something which I should think no person anxious
to keep such a secret would do. If he means 'bank,' he might as
well have called it by another name altogether."</p>

<p>"I think ordinarily he would have been safe in writing his cipher
as he has done; but, be that as it may, I am confident you have
made a most important discovery."</p>
