I WAS UNCONSCIOUS LITTLE MORE THAN AN INSTANT,
for as I lunged forward from the crossbeam to which I
had been clinging, and fell with a crash to the floor
of the cabin, the shock brought me to myself.
<P>
My first concern was with Perry.  I was horrified at the thought
that upon the very threshold of salvation he might be dead.
Tearing open his shirt I placed my ear to his breast.
I could have cried with relief--his heart was beating
quite regularly.
<P>
At the water tank I wetted my handkerchief, slapping it
smartly across his forehead and face several times.
In a moment I was rewarded by the raising of his lids.
For a time he lay wide-eyed and quite uncomprehending.
Then his scattered wits slowly foregathered, and he sat
up sniffing the air with an expression of wonderment upon
his face.
<P>
"Why, David," he cried at last, "it's air, as sure as I live.
Why--why what does it mean?  Where in the world are we?
What has happened?"
<P>
"It means that we're back at the surface all right, Perry," I
cried;
"but where, I don't know.  I haven't opened her up yet.
Been too busy reviving you.  Lord, man, but you had a close
squeak!"
<P>
"You say we're back at the surface, David?  How can
that be?  How long have I been unconscious?"
<P>
"Not long.  We turned in the ice stratum.
Don't you recall the sudden whirling of our seats?
After that the drill was above you instead of below.
We didn't notice it at the time; but I recall it now."
<P>
"You mean to say that we turned back in the ice stratum,
David?  That is not possible.  The prospector cannot turn
unless its nose is deflected from the outside--by some
external force or resistance--the steering wheel within
would have moved in response.  The steering wheel has
not budged, David, since we started.  You know that."
<P>
I did know it; but here we were with our drill racing in
pure air, and copious volumes of it pouring into the cabin.
<P>
"We couldn't have turned in the ice stratum, Perry, I know
as well as you," I replied; "but the fact remains
that we did, for here we are this minute at the surface
of the earth again, and I am going out to see just where."
<P>
"Better wait till morning, David--it must be midnight now."
<P>
I glanced at the chronometer.
<P>
"Half after twelve.  We have been out seventy-two hours,
so it must be midnight.  Nevertheless I am going to have
a look at the blessed sky that I had given up all hope
of ever seeing again," and so saying I lifted the bars
from the inner door, and swung it open.  There was quite
a quantity of loose material in the jacket, and this I
had to remove with a shovel to get at the opposite door
in the outer shell.
<P>
In a short time I had removed enough of the earth and rock
to the floor of the cabin to expose the door beyond.
Perry was directly behind me as I threw it open.
The upper half was above the surface of the ground.
With an expression of surprise I turned and looked at
Perry--it was broad daylight without!
<P>
"Something seems to have gone wrong either with our
calculations or the chronometer," I said.  Perry shook
his head--there was a strange expression in his eyes.
<P>
"Let's have a look beyond that door, David," he cried.
<P>
Together we stepped out to stand in silent contemplation
of a landscape at once weird and beautiful.  Before us
a low and level shore stretched down to a silent sea.
As far as the eye could reach the surface of the water
was dotted with countless tiny isles--some of towering,
barren, granitic rock--others resplendent in gorgeous
trappings of tropical vegetation, myriad starred with
the magnificent splendor of vivid blooms.
<P>
Behind us rose a dark and forbidding wood of giant
arborescent ferns intermingled with the commoner types
of a primeval tropical forest.  Huge creepers depended
in great loops from tree to tree, dense under-brush
overgrew a tangled mass of fallen trunks and branches.
Upon the outer verge we could see the same splendid
coloring of countless blossoms that glorified the islands,
but within the dense shadows all seemed dark and gloomy
as the grave.
<P>
And upon all the noonday sun poured its torrid rays
out of a cloudless sky.
<P>
"Where on earth can we be?" I asked, turning to Perry.
<P>
For some moments the old man did not reply.  He stood
with bowed head, buried in deep thought.  But at last
he spoke.
<P>
"David," he said, "I am not so sure that we are ON earth."
<P>
"What do you mean Perry?" I cried.  "Do you think that we
are dead, and this is heaven?" He smiled, and turning,
pointing to the nose of the prospector protruding from
the ground at our backs.
<P>
"But for that, David, I might believe that we were indeed
come to the country beyond the Styx.  The prospector
renders that theory untenable--it, certainly, could never
have gone to heaven.  However I am willing to concede
that we actually may be in another world from that
which we have always known.  If we are not ON earth,
there is every reason to believe that we may be IN it."
<P>
"We may have quartered through the earth's crust and come
out upon some tropical island of the West Indies,"
I suggested.  Again Perry shook his head.
<P>
"Let us wait and see, David," he replied, "and in the
meantime suppose we do a bit of exploring up and down
the coast--we may find a native who can enlighten us."
<P>
As we walked along the beach Perry gazed long and
earnestly across the water.  Evidently he was wrestling
with a mighty problem.
<P>
"David," he said abruptly, "do you perceive anything
unusual about the horizon?"
<P>
As I looked I began to appreciate the reason for the
strangeness of the landscape that had haunted me from
the first with an illusive suggestion of the bizarre
and unnatural--THERE WAS NO HORIZON!  As far as the eye
could reach out the sea continued and upon its bosom
floated tiny islands, those in the distance reduced
to mere specks; but ever beyond them was the sea,
until the impression became quite real that one was
LOOKING UP at the most distant point that the eyes
could fathom--the distance was lost in the distance.
That was all--there was no clear-cut horizontal
line marking the dip of the globe below the line of vision.
<P>
"A great light is commencing to break on me," continued Perry,
taking out his watch.  "I believe that I have partially
solved the riddle.  It is now two o'clock. When we emerged
from the prospector the sun was directly above us.
Where is it now?"
<P>
I glanced up to find the great orb still motionless
in the center of the heaven.  And such a sun!  I had
scarcely noticed it before.  Fully thrice the size of
the sun I had known throughout my life, and apparently
so near that the sight of it carried the conviction
that one might almost reach up and touch it.
<P>
"My God, Perry, where are we?" I exclaimed.  "This thing
is beginning to get on my nerves."
<P>
"I think that I may state quite positively, David,"
he commenced, "that we are--" but he got no further.
From behind us in the vicinity of the prospector there
came the most thunderous, awe-inspiring roar that ever
had fallen upon my ears.  With one accord we turned
to discover the author of that fearsome noise.
<P>
Had I still retained the suspicion that we were on earth the
sight that met my eyes would quite entirely have banished it.
Emerging from the forest was a colossal beast which closely
resembled a bear.  It was fully as large as the largest
elephant and with great forepaws armed with huge claws.
Its nose, or snout, depended nearly a foot below its
lower jaw, much after the manner of a rudimentary trunk.
The giant body was covered by a coat of thick, shaggy hair.
<P>
Roaring horribly it came toward us at a ponderous,
shuffling trot.  I turned to Perry to suggest that it
might be wise to seek other surroundings--the idea had
evidently occurred to Perry previously, for he was already
a hundred paces away, and with each second his prodigious
bounds increased the distance.  I had never guessed
what latent speed possibilities the old gentleman possessed.
<P>
I saw that he was headed toward a little point of the
forest which ran out toward the sea not far from where we
had been standing, and as the mighty creature, the sight
of which had galvanized him into such remarkable action,
was forging steadily toward me.  I set off after Perry,
though at a somewhat more decorous pace.  It was evident
that the massive beast pursuing us was not built for speed,
so all that I considered necessary was to gain the trees
sufficiently ahead of it to enable me to climb to the safety
of some great branch before it came up.
<P>
Notwithstanding our danger I could not help but laugh at
Perry's frantic capers as he essayed to gain the safety
of the lower branches of the trees he now had reached.
The stems were bare for a distance of some fifteen feet--at
least on those trees which Perry attempted to ascend,
for the suggestion of safety carried by the larger of
the forest giants had evidently attracted him to them.
A dozen times he scrambled up the trunks like a huge cat
only to fall back to the ground once more, and with each
failure he cast a horrified glance over his shoulder at
the oncoming brute, simultaneously emitting terror-stricken
shrieks that awoke the echoes of the grim forest.
<P>
At length he spied a dangling creeper about the bigness
of one's wrist, and when I reached the trees he was racing
madly up it, hand over hand.  He had almost reached the lowest
branch of the tree from which the creeper depended when
the thing parted beneath his weight and he fell sprawling
at my feet.
<P>
The misfortune now was no longer amusing, for the beast
was already too close to us for comfort.  Seizing Perry
by the shoulder I dragged him to his feet, and rushing
to a smaller tree--one that he could easily encircle with
his arms and legs--I boosted him as far up as I could,
and then left him to his fate, for a glance over my
shoulder revealed the awful beast almost upon me.
<P>
It was the great size of the thing alone that saved me.
Its enormous bulk rendered it too slow upon its feet
to cope with the agility of my young muscles, and so I was
enabled to dodge out of its way and run completely behind
it before its slow wits could direct it in pursuit.
<P>
The few seconds of grace that this gave me found me
safely lodged in the branches of a tree a few paces
from that in which Perry had at last found a haven.
<P>
Did I say safely lodged?  At the time I thought we were
quite safe, and so did Perry.  He was praying--raising
his voice in thanksgiving at our deliverance--and had
just completed a sort of paeon of gratitude that the thing
couldn't climb a tree when without warning it reared up
beneath him on its enormous tail and hind feet, and reached
those fearfully armed paws quite to the branch upon
which he crouched.
<P>
The accompanying roar was all but drowned in Perry's
scream of fright, and he came near tumbling headlong
into the gaping jaws beneath him, so precipitate was
his impetuous haste to vacate the dangerous limb.
It was with a deep sigh of relief that I saw him gain
a higher branch in safety.
<P>
And then the brute did that which froze us both anew
with horror.  Grasping the tree's stem with his powerful
paws he dragged down with all the great weight of his
huge bulk and all the irresistible force of those
mighty muscles.  Slowly, but surely, the stem began to
bend toward him.  Inch by inch he worked his paws upward
as the tree leaned more and more from the perpendicular.
Perry clung chattering in a panic of terror.  Higher and
higher into the bending and swaying tree he clambered.
More and more rapidly was the tree top inclining toward
the ground.
<P>
I saw now why the great brute was armed with such
enormous paws.  The use that he was putting them to was
precisely that for which nature had intended them.
The sloth-like creature was herbivorous, and to feed that mighty
carcass entire trees must be stripped of their foliage.
The reason for its attacking us might easily be accounted
for on the supposition of an ugly disposition such as that
which the fierce and stupid rhinoceros of Africa possesses.
But these were later reflections.  At the moment I was too
frantic with apprehension on Perry's behalf to consider aught
other than a means to save him from the death that loomed so
close.
<P>
Realizing that I could outdistance the clumsy brute in
the open, I dropped from my leafy sanctuary intent only on
distracting the thing's attention from Perry long enough
to enable the old man to gain the safety of a larger tree.
There were many close by which not even the terrific
strength of that titanic monster could bend.
<P>
As I touched the ground I snatched a broken limb from
the tangled mass that matted the jungle-like floor of the
forest and, leaping unnoticed behind the shaggy back,
dealt the brute a terrific blow.  My plan worked like magic.
From the previous slowness of the beast I had been led
to look for no such marvelous agility as he now displayed.
Releasing his hold upon the tree he dropped on all fours
and at the same time swung his great, wicked tail with a
force that would have broken every bone in my body had it
struck me; but, fortunately, I had turned to flee at the
very instant that I felt my blow land upon the towering back.
<P>
As it started in pursuit of me I made the mistake of running
along the edge of the forest rather than making for the
open beach.  In a moment I was knee-deep in rotting vegetation,
and the awful thing behind me was gaining rapidly
as I floundered and fell in my efforts to extricate myself.
<P>
A fallen log gave me an instant's advantage, for climbing
upon it I leaped to another a few paces farther on,
and in this way was able to keep clear of the mush that
carpeted the surrounding ground.  But the zigzag course
that this necessitated was placing such a heavy handicap
upon me that my pursuer was steadily gaining upon me.
<P>
Suddenly from behind I heard a tumult of howls, and sharp,
piercing barks--much the sound that a pack of wolves
raises when in full cry.  Involuntarily I glanced
backward to discover the origin of this new and menacing
note with the result that I missed my footing and went
sprawling once more upon my face in the deep muck.
<P>
My mammoth enemy was so close by this time that I knew I
must feel the weight of one of his terrible paws before I
could rise, but to my surprise the blow did not fall upon me.
The howling and snapping and barking of the new element
which had been infused into the melee now seemed centered
quite close behind me, and as I raised myself upon my hands
and glanced around I saw what it was that had distracted
the DYRYTH, as I afterward learned the thing is called,
from my trail.
<P>
It was surrounded by a pack of some hundred wolf-like
creatures--wild dogs they seemed--that rushed growling
and snapping in upon it from all sides, so that they sank
their white fangs into the slow brute and were away again
before it could reach them with its huge paws or sweeping tail.
<P>
But these were not all that my startled eyes perceived.
Chattering and gibbering through the lower branches of
the trees came a company of manlike creatures evidently
urging on the dog pack.  They were to all appearances
strikingly similar in aspect to the Negro of Africa.
Their skins were very black, and their features much
like those of the more pronounced Negroid type except
that the head receded more rapidly above the eyes,
leaving little or no forehead.  Their arms were rather
longer and their legs shorter in proportion to the torso
than in man, and later I noticed that their great toes
protruded at right angles from their feet--because of their
arboreal habits, I presume.  Behind them trailed long,
slender tails which they used in climbing quite as much as
they did either their hands or feet.
<P>
I had stumbled to my feet the moment that I discovered
that the wolf-dogs were holding the dyryth at bay.
At sight of me several of the savage creatures left off
worrying the great brute to come slinking with bared fangs
toward me, and as I turned to run toward the trees again
to seek safety among the lower branches, I saw a number
of the man-apes leaping and chattering in the foliage
of the nearest tree.
<P>
Between them and the beasts behind me there was little choice,
but at least there was a doubt as to the reception
these grotesque parodies on humanity would accord me,
while there was none as to the fate which awaited me
beneath the grinning fangs of my fierce pursuers.
<P>
And so I raced on toward the trees intending to pass
beneath that which held the man-things and take refuge
in another farther on; but the wolf-dogs were very close
behind me--so close that I had despaired of escaping them,
when one of the creatures in the tree above swung
down headforemost, his tail looped about a great limb,
and grasping me beneath my armpits swung me in safety up
among his fellows.
<P>
There they fell to examining me with the utmost excitement
and curiosity.  They picked at my clothing, my hair,
and my flesh.  They turned me about to see if I had a tail,
and when they discovered that I was not so equipped they
fell into roars of laughter.  Their teeth were very large
and white and even, except for the upper canines which were
a trifle longer than the others--protruding just a bit
when the mouth was closed.
<P>
When they had examined me for a few moments one of them
discovered that my clothing was not a part of me, with the
result that garment by garment they tore it from me amidst
peals of the wildest laughter.  Apelike, they essayed
to don the apparel themselves, but their ingenuity
was not sufficient to the task and so they gave it up.
<P>
In the meantime I had been straining my eyes to catch
a glimpse of Perry, but nowhere about could I see him,
although the clump of trees in which he had first taken
refuge was in full view.  I was much exercised by fear
that something had befallen him, and though I called his
name aloud several times there was no response.
<P>
Tired at last of playing with my clothing the creatures
threw it to the ground, and catching me, one on either side,
by an arm, started off at a most terrifying pace through
the tree tops.  Never have I experienced such a journey
before or since--even now I oftentimes awake from a deep
sleep haunted by the horrid remembrance of that awful experience.
<P>
From tree to tree the agile creatures sprang like flying
squirrels, while the cold sweat stood upon my brow as I
glimpsed the depths beneath, into which a single misstep
on the part of either of my bearers would hurl me.
As they bore me along, my mind was occupied with a thousand
bewildering thoughts.  What had become of Perry?  Would
I ever see him again?  What were the intentions of these
half-human things into whose hands I had fallen?  Were they
inhabitants of the same world into which I had been born?
No!  It could not be.  But yet where else?  I had not left
that earth--of that I was sure.  Still neither could I
reconcile the things which I had seen to a belief that
I was still in the world of my birth.  With a sigh I gave it up.
