<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>St. Ambrose's College was a moderate-sized one. There might have
been some seventy or eighty undergraduates in residence, when
our hero appeared there as a freshman. Of these, unfortunately
for the college, there were a very large proportion of the gentleman-commoners;
enough, in fact, with the other men whom they drew round them,
and who lived pretty much as they did, to form the largest and
leading set in the college. So the college was decidedly fast.</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of this set was the most reckless extravagance
of every kind. London wine merchants furnished them with liqueurs
at a guinea a bottle and wine at five guineas a dozen; Oxford
and London tailors vied with one another in providing them with
unheard-of quantities of the most gorgeous clothing. They drove
tandems in all directions, scattering their ample allowances,
which they treated as pocket money, about roadside inns and Oxford
taverns with open hand, and "going tick" for everything which
could by possibility be booked. Their cigars cost two guineas
a pound; their furniture was the best that could be bought; pine-apples,
forced fruit, and the most rare preserves figured at their wine
parties; they hunted, rode steeple-chases by day, played billiards
until the gates closed, and then were ready for <em>vingt-et-une</em>,
unlimited loo, and hot drink in their own rooms, as long as anyone
could be got to sit up and play.</p>

<p>The fast set then swamped, and gave the tone to the college;
at which fact no persons were more astonished and horrified than
the authorities of St. Ambrose.</p>

<p>That they of all bodies in the world should be fairly run away
with by a set of reckless, loose young spendthrifts, was indeed
a melancholy and unprecedented fact; for the body of fellows of
St. Ambrose was as distinguished for learning, morality and respectability
as any in the University. The foundation was not, indeed, actually
an open one. Oriel at that time alone enjoyed this distinction;
but there were a large number of open fellowships, and the income
of the college was large, and the livings belonging to it numerous;
so that the best men from other colleges were constantly coming
in. Some of these of a former generation had been eminently successful
in their management of the college. The St. Ambrose undergraduates
at one time had carried off almost all the university prizes,
and filled the class lists, while maintaining at the same time
the highest character for manliness and gentlemanly conduct. This
had lasted long enough to establish the fame of the college, and
great lords and statesmen had sent their sons there; head-masters
had struggled to get the names of their best pupils on the books;
in short, everyone who had a son, ward, or pupil, whom he wanted
to push forward in the world&mdash;who was meant to cut a figure, and
take the lead among men, left no stone unturned to get him into
St. Ambrose's; and thought the first, and a very long step gained
when he had succeeded.</p>

<p>But the governing bodies of colleges are always on the change,
and, in the course of things men of other ideas came to rule at
St. Ambrose&mdash;shrewd men of the world; men of business, some of
them, with good ideas of making the most of their advantages;
who said, "Go to; why should we not make the public pay for the
great benefits we confer on them? Have we not the very best article
in the educational market to supply&mdash;almost a monopoly of it&mdash;and
shall we not get the highest price for it?" So by degrees they
altered many things in the college. In the first place, under
their auspices, gentlemen-commoners increased and multiplied;
in fact, the eldest sons of baronets, even squires, were scarcely
admitted on any other footing. As these young gentlemen paid double
fees to the college, and had great expectations of all sorts,
it could not be expected that they should be subject to quite
the same discipline as the common run of men, who would have to
make their own way in the world. So the rules as to attendance
at chapel and lectures, though nominally the same for them as
for commoners, were in practice relaxed in their favour; and,
that they might find all things suitable to persons in their position,
the kitchen and buttery were worked up to a high state of perfection,
and St. Ambrose, from having been one of the most reasonable,
had come to be about the most expensive college in the university.
These changes worked as their promoters probably desired that
they should work, and the college was full of rich men, and commanded
in the university the sort of respect which riches bring with
them. But the old reputation, though still strong out of doors,
was beginning sadly to wane within the university precincts. Fewer
and fewer of the St. Ambrose men appeared in the class lists,
or amongst the prize-men. They no longer led the debates at the
Union; the boat lost place after place on the river; the eleven
got beaten in all their matches. The inaugurators of these changes
had passed away in their turn, and at last a reaction had commenced.
The fellows recently elected, and who were in residence at the
time we write of, were for the most part men of great attainments,
all of them men who had taken very high honors. The electors naturally
enough had chosen them as the most likely persons to restore,
as tutors, the golden days of the college; and they had been careful
in the selection to confine themselves to very quiet and studious
men, such as were likely to remain up at Oxford, passing over
men of more popular manners and active spirits, who would be sure
to flit soon into the world, and be of little more service to
St. Ambrose.</p>

<p>But these were not the men to get any hold on the fast set who
were now in the ascendant. It was not in the nature of things
that they should understand each other; in fact, they were hopelessly
at war, and the college was getting more and more out of gear
in consequence.</p>

<p>What they could do, however, they were doing; and under their
fostering care were growing up a small set, including most of
the scholars, who were likely, as far as they were concerned,
to retrieve the college character of the schools. But they were
too much like their tutors, men who did little else but read.
They neither wished for, nor were likely to gain, the slightest
influence on the fast set. The best men amongst them, too, were
diligent readers of the <em>Tracts for the Times</em>, and followers
of the able leaders of the High-church party, which was then a
growing one; and this led them also to form such friendships as
they made amongst out-college men of their own way of thinking-with
high churchmen, rather than St. Ambrose men. So they lived very
much to themselves, and scarcely interfered with the dominant
party.</p>

<p>Lastly, there was the boating set, which was beginning to revive
in the college, partly from the natural disgust of any body of
young Englishmen, at finding themselves distanced in an exercise
requiring strength and pluck, and partly from the fact, that the
captain for the time being was one of the best oars in the University
boat, and also a deservedly popular character. He was now in his
third year of residence, had won the pair-oar race, and had pulled
seven in the great yearly match with Cambridge, and by constant
hard work had managed to carry the St. Ambrose boat up to the
fifth place on the river. He will be introduced to you, gentle
reader, when the proper time comes; at present, we are only concerned
with a bird's-eye view of the college, that you may feel more
or less at home in it. The boating set was not so separate or
marked as the reading set, melting on one side into, and keeping
up more or less connexion with, the fast set, and also commanding
a sort of half allegiance from most of the men who belonged to
neither of the other sets. The minor divisions, of which of course
there were many, need not be particularized, as the above general
classification will be enough for the purposes of this history.</p>

<p>Our hero, on leaving school, having bound himself solemnly to
write all his doings and thoughts to the friend whom he had left
behind him: distance and separation were to make no difference
whatever in their friendship. This compact had been made on one
of their last evenings at Rugby. They were sitting together in
the six-form room, Tom splicing the handle of a favourite cricket
bat, and Arthur reading a volume of Raleigh's works. The Doctor
had lately been alluding to the "History of the World," and had
excited the curiosity of the active-minded amongst his pupils
about the great navigator, statesman, soldier, author, and fine
gentleman. So Raleigh's works were seized on by various voracious
young readers, and carried out of the school library; and Arthur
was now deep in a volume of the "Miscellanies," curled up on a
corner of the sofa. Presently, Tom heard something between a groan
and a protest, and, looking up, demanded explanations; in answer
to which, Arthur, in a voice half furious and half fearful, read
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And be sure of this, thou shalt never find a friend in thy young
years whose conditions and qualities will please thee after thou
comest to more discretion and judgment; and then all thou givest
is lost, and all wherein thou shalt trust such a one will be discovered."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that's Raleigh's?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;here it is, in his first letter to his son."</p>

<p>"What a cold-blooded old Philistine," said Tom.</p>

<p>"But it can't be true, do you think?" said Arthur.</p>

<p>And in short, after some personal reflections on Sir Walter,
they then and there resolved that, so far as they were concerned,
it was not, could not, and should not be true, that they would
remain faithful, the same to each other; and the greatest friends
in the world, through I know not what separations, trials, and
catastrophes. And for the better insuring this result, a correspondence,
regular as the recurring months, was to be maintained. It had
already lasted through the long vacation and up to Christmas without
sensibly dragging, though Tom's letters had been something of
the shortest in November, when he had lots of shooting, and two
days a week with the hounds. Now, however, having fairly got to
Oxford, he determined to make up for all short-comings. His first
letter from college, taken in connexion with the previous sketch
of the place, will probably accomplish the work of introduction
better than any detailed account by a third party; and it is therefore
given here verbatim:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>"St. Ambrose, Oxford,</em></p>

<p><em>"February, 184-</em></p>

<p>"MY <em>DEAR GEORDIE</em>,</p>

<p>"According to promise, I write to tell you how I get on up here,
and what sort of a place Oxford is. Of course, I don't know much
about it yet, having only been up some weeks, but you shall have
my first impressions.</p>

<p>"Well, first and foremost it's an awfully idle place; at any
rate for us freshmen. Fancy now. I am in twelve lectures a week
of an hour each &mdash;Greek Testament, first book of Herodotus,
second AEneid, and first book of Euclid! There's a treat! Two
hours a day; all over by twelve, or one at latest, and no extra
work at all, in the shape of copies of verses, themes, or other
exercises.</p>

<p>"I think sometimes I'm back in the lower fifth; for we don't
get through more than we used to do there; and if you were to
hear the men construe, it would make your hair stand on end. Where
on earth can they have come from? Unless they blunder on purpose,
as I often think. Of course, I never look at a lecture before
I go in, I know it all nearly by heart, so it would be sheer waste
of time. I hope I shall take to reading something or other by
myself; but you know I never was much of a hand at sapping, and,
for the present, the light work suits me well enough, for there's
plenty to see and learn about in this place.</p>

<p>"We keep very gentlemanly hours. Chapel every morning at eight,
and evening at seven. You must attend once a day, and twice on
Sundays&mdash;at least, that's the rule of our college&mdash;and be in gates
by twelve o'clock at night. Besides which, if you're a decently
steady fellow, you ought to dine in hall perhaps four days a week.
Hall is at five o'clock. And now you have the sum total. All the
rest of your time you may just do what you like with.</p>

<p>"So much for our work and hours. Now for the place. Well, it's
a grand old place, certainly; and I dare say, if a fellow goes
straight in it, and gets creditably through his three years, he
may end by loving it as much as we do the old school-house and
quadrangle at Rugby. Our college is a fair specimen: a venerable
old front of crumbling stone fronting the street, into which two
or three other colleges look also. Over the gateway is a large
room, where the college examinations go on, when there are any;
and, as you enter, you pass the porters lodge, where resides our
janitor, a bustling little man, with a pot belly, whose business
it is to put down the time at which the men come in at night,
and to keep all discommonsed tradesmen, stray dogs, and bad characters
generally, out of the college.</p>

<p>"The large quadrangle into which you come first, is bigger than
ours at Rugby, and a much more solemn and sleepy sort of a place,
with its gables and old mullioned windows. One side is occupied
by the hall and chapel; the principal's house takes up half another
side; and the rest is divided into staircases, on each of which
are six or eight sets of rooms, inhabited by us undergraduates,
and here and there a tutor or fellow dropped down amongst us (in
the first-floor rooms, of course), not exactly to keep order,
but to act as a sort of ballast. This quadrangle is the show part
of the college, and is generally respectable and quiet, which
is a good deal more than can be said for the inner quadrangle,
which you get at through a passage leading out of the other. The
rooms ain't half so large or good in the inner quad; and here's
where all we freshmen live, besides a lot of the older undergraduates
who don't care to change their rooms. Only one tutor has rooms
here; and I should think, if he's a reading man, it won't be long
before he clears out; for all sorts of high jinks go on on the
grass-plot, and the row on the staircases is often as bad, and
not half so respectable, as it used to be in the middle passage
in the last week of the half-year.</p>

<p>"My rooms are what they call garrets, right up in the roof, with
a commanding view of the college tiles and chimney pots, and of
houses at the back. No end of cats, both college Toms and strangers,
haunt the neighbourhood, and I am rapidly learning cat-talking
from them; but I'm not going to stand it &mdash;I don't want to
know cat-talk. The college Toms are protected by the statutes,
I believe; but I'm going to buy an air-gun for the benefit of
the strangers. My rooms are pleasant enough, at the top of the
kitchen staircase, and separated from all mankind by a great,
iron-clamped, outer door, my oak, which I sport when I go out
or want to be quiet; sitting room eighteen by twelve, bedroom
twelve by eight, and a little cupboard for the scout.</p>

<p>"Ah, Geordie, the scout is an institution! Fancy me waited upon
and valeted by a stout party in black of quiet, gentlemanly manners,
like the benevolent father in a comedy. He takes the deepest interest
in all my possessions and proceedings, and is evidently used to
good society, to judge by the amount of crockery and glass, wines,
liquors, and grocery, which he thinks indispensable for my due
establishment. He has also been good enough to recommend to me
many tradesmen who are ready to supply these articles in any quantities;
each of whom has been here already a dozen times, cap in hand,
and vowing that it is quite immaterial when I pay&mdash;which is very
kind of them; but, with the highest respect for friend Perkins
(my scout) and his obliging friends, I shall make some enquiries
before "letting in" with any of them. He waits on me in hall,
where we go in full fig of cap and gown at five, and get very
good dinners, and cheap enough. It is rather a fine old room,
with a good, arched, black oak ceiling and high panelling, hung
round with pictures of old swells, bishops and lords chiefly,
who have endowed the college in some way, or at least have fed
here in times gone by, and for whom, <em>"caeterisque benefactoribus
nostris,"</em> we daily give thanks in a long Latin grace, which
one of the undergraduates (I think it must be) goes and rattles
out at the end of the high table, and then comes down again from
the dais to his own place. No one feeds at the high table except
the dons and the gentlemen-commoners, who are undergraduates in
velvet caps and silk gowns. Why they wear these instead of cloth
and serge I haven't yet made out, I believe it is because they
pay double fees; but they seem uncommonly wretched up at the high
table, and I should think would sooner pay double to come to the
other end of the hall.</p>

<p>"The chapel is a quaint little place, about the size of the chancel
of Lutterworth Church. It just holds us all comfortably. The attendance
is regular enough, but I don't think the men care about it a bit
in general. Several I can see bring in Euclids, and other lecture
books, and the service is gone through at a great pace. I couldn't
think at first why some of the men seemed so uncomfortable and
stiff about the legs at morning service, but I find that they
are the hunting set, and come in with pea-coats over their pinks,
and trousers over their leather breeches and top-boots; which
accounts for it. There are a few others who seem very devout,
and bow a good deal, and turn towards the altar at different parts
of the service. These are of the Oxford High-church school, I
believe; but I shall soon find out more about them. On the whole
I feel less at home at present, I am sorry to say, in the chapel,
than anywhere else.</p>

<p>"I was very near forgetting a great institution of the college,
which is the buttery-hatch, just opposite the hall-door. Here
abides the fat old butler (all the servants at St. Ambrose's are
portly), and serves out limited bread, butter, and cheese, and
unlimited beer brewed by himself, for an hour in the morning,
at noon, and again at supper-time. Your scout always fetches you
a pint or so on each occasion in case you should want it, and
if you don't, it falls to him; but I can't say that my fellow
gets much, for I am naturally a thirsty soul, and cannot often
resist the malt myself, coming up as it does, fresh and cool,
in one of the silver tankards, of which we seem to have an endless
supply.</p>

<p>"I spent a day or two in the first week, before I got shaken
down into my place here, in going round and seeing the other colleges,
and finding out what great men had been at each (one got a taste
for that sort of work from the Doctor, and I'd nothing else to
do). Well, I never was more interested; fancy ferreting out Wycliffe,
the Black Prince, our friend Sir Walter Raleigh, Pym, Hampden,
Laud, Ireton, Butler, and Addison, in one afternoon. I walked
about two inches taller in my trencher cap after it. Perhaps I
may be going to make dear friends with some fellow who will change
the history of England. Why shouldn't I? There must have been
freshmen once who were chums of Wycliffe of Queen's, or Raleigh
of Oriel. I mooned up and down the High-street, staring at all
the young faces in caps, and wondering which of them would turn
out great generals, or statesmen, or poets. Some of them will,
of course, for there must be a dozen at least, I should think,
in every generation of undergraduates, who will have a good deal
to say to the ruling and guiding of the British nation before
they die.</p>

<p>"But, after all, the river is the feature of Oxford, to my mind;
a glorious stream, not five minutes' walk from the colleges, broad
enough in most places for three boats to row abreast. I expect
I will take to boating furiously: I have been down the river three
or four times already with some other freshmen, and it is glorious
exercise; that I can see, though we bungle and cut crabs desperately
at present.</p>

<p>"Here's a long yarn I'm spinning for you; and I dare say after
all you'll say it tells you nothing, and you'd rather have twenty
lines about the men, and what they're thinking about and the meaning,
and the inner life of the place, and all that. Patience, patience!
I don't know anything about it myself yet, and have had only time
to look at the shell, which is a very handsome and stately affair;
you shall have the kernel, if I ever get at it, in due time.</p>

<p>"And now write me a long letter directly, and tell me about the
Doctor, and who are in the Sixth, and how the house goes on, and
what sort of an eleven there'll be, and what you are doing and
thinking about. Come up here try for a scholarship; I'll take
you in and show you the lions. Remember me to old friends. &mdash;Ever
your affectionately,</p>

<p>T. B."</p>
