<p>On a cool summer's morning Ferdinand Frog was sitting among the reeds
near the bank of the pond when a harsh voice suddenly said:
</p>
<p>"Stop that!"
</p><p>Looking up, Mr. Frog saw a huge bird standing on one leg in the water,
watching him. The stranger was actually so big that Mr. Frog hadn't
noticed him.
</p><p>To be sure, he had seen what he thought was a stick stuck upright in the
muddy bottom of the pond. That was really the stranger's leg; but Mr.
Frog hadn't taken the trouble to glance upwards and see what was at the
top of it.
</p><p>Of course, Mr. Frog was frightened as soon as he discovered his mistake,
for the bird had a great, long bill. Without being told, Ferdinand Frog
knew that that bill could open like a trap--and seize him, too. But he
showed not the least sign that he was even disturbed.
</p><p>"Stop that, I say!" the stranger repeated, before Mr. Frog had so much
as said a word.
</p><p>"Stop what?" Mr. Frog asked.
</p><p>"Stop sticking your tongue out at me!" the other commanded.
</p><p>In spite of his alarm, when he heard that Ferdinand Frog began to laugh.
</p><p>"I beg your pardon," he said, "but I think you are mistaken. I wasn't
sticking my tongue out at you. I was only catching flies." Mr. Frog paid
no attention to the sneering laugh that the stranger gave. "You see,"
he went on, "I'm having my breakfast. And this is how I manage it: I
wait here without moving until a fly comes my way. Then I dart my tongue
at him as quick as lightning.
</p><p>"My tongue," Mr. Frog explained, "is fastened at the front of my mouth
instead of at the back. So I can often reach a fly when he thinks he's
perfectly safe. And furthermore, my tongue is so sticky that if it
touches a fly, he can't get away. Then I swallow that one and wait for
another."
</p><p>"A likely story!" the big bird scoffed. "I've been watching you for a
long time (Mr. Frog shivered when he heard that!) and I know what I'm
talking about. . . . There you go again!" he shrieked angrily, as
Ferdinand Frog's tongue flew out and captured another fly so quickly
that the stranger couldn't see just what had happened.
</p><p>"Listen to me a moment!" Mr. Frog said. "Like most people, I have to
eat. And when I eat I can't help sticking out my tongue. So I'd suggest
that if you don't care to watch me at my breakfast you'd better go away.
It certainly isn't my fault that you're standing right in front of me."
</p><p>But the stranger declined to move.
</p><p>"If you really meant to be polite," he grumbled, "you'd at least turn
your back when you stick out your tongue."
</p><p>But Mr. Frog never stirred. He was afraid that the moment he turned his
back the big bird would pounce upon him.
</p><p>"It's not necessary for me to turn around now," he explained. "I've
finished my breakfast. And I hope you've had yours, too."
</p><p>[Illustration: Grand-daddy Beaver Appeals to Mr. Frog]
</p><p>"I'm sorry to say that I have," the stranger answered with a sigh, as he
looked longingly at plump Mr. Frog. "I couldn't eat another mouthful if
it sat right in front of me."
</p><p>And then Ferdinand Frog felt as if a great weight had been lifted from
his mind. He smiled all over his face, to show the stranger that he was
glad to see him.
</p><p>"Ah!" Mr. Frog cried. "Then we can have a friendly chat together. I
always like to talk with travellers. . . . What a long, sharp bill you
have!"
</p><p>Now, some people would think that a rude remark. But it seemed to please
the stranger immensely.
