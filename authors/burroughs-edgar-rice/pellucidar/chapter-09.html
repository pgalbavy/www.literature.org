<P>
I had built a little shelter of rocks and brush where I
might crawl in and sleep out of the perpetual light and
heat of the noonday sun.  When I was tired or hungry I
retired to my humble cot.
<P>
My masters never interposed the slightest objection. 
As a matter of fact, they were very good to me, nor did
I see aught while I was among them to indicate that
they are ever else than a simple, kindly folk when left to
themselves.  Their awe-inspiring size, terrific strength,
mighty fighting-fangs, and hideous appearance are but
the attributes necessary to the successful waging of their
constant battle for survival, and well do they employ
them when the need arises.  The only flesh they eat is
that of herbivorous animals and birds.  When they hunt
the mighty thag, the prehistoric bos of the outer crust, a
single male, with his fiber rope, will catch and kill the
greatest of the bulls.
<P>
Well, as I was about to say, I had this little shelter at
the edge of my melon-patch.  Here I was resting from
my labors on a certain occasion when I heard a great
hub-bub in the village, which lay about a quarter of a
mile away.
<P>
Presently a male came racing toward the field, shouting excitedly.  As he approached I came from my shelter
to learn what all the commotion might be about, for the
monotony of my existence in the melon-patch must have
fostered that trait of my curiosity from which it had
always been my secret boast I am peculiarly free.
<P>
The other workers also ran forward to meet the messenger, who quickly unburdened himself of his information, and as quickly turned and scampered back toward
the village.  When running these beast-men often go
upon all fours.  Thus they leap over obstacles that
would slow up a human being, and upon the level attain
a speed that would make a thoroughbred look to his
laurels.  The result in this instance was that before I
had more than assimilated the gist of the word which
had been brought to the fields, I was alone, watching
my co-workers speeding villageward.
<P>
I was alone! It was the first time since my capture
that no beast-man had been within sight of me.  I was
alone! And all my captors were in the village at the opposite edge of the mesa repelling an attack of Hooja's
horde!
<P>
It seemed from the messenger's tale that two of
Gr-gr-gr's great males had been set upon by a half-dozen
of Hooja's cutthroats while the former were peaceably
returning from the thag hunt.  The two had returned to
the village unscratched, while but a single one of
Hooja's half-dozen had escaped to report the outcome
of the battle to their leader.  Now Hooja was coming to
punish Gr-gr-gr's people.  With his large force, armed
with the bows and arrows that Hooja had learned from
me to make, with long lances and sharp knives, I
feared that even the mighty strength of the beastmen
could avail them but little.
<P>
At last had come the opportunity for which I waited!
I was free to make for the far end of the mesa, find my
way to the valley below, and while the two forces were
engaged in their struggle, continue my search for
Hooja's village, which I had learned from the beast-men
lay farther on down the river that I had been following
when taken prisoner.
<P>
As I turned to make for the mesa's rim the sounds of
battle came plainly to my ears--the hoarse shouts of
men mingled with the half-beastly roars and growls of
the brute-folk.
<P>
Did I take advantage of my opportunity?
<P>
I did not.  Instead, lured by the din of strife and by the
desire to deliver a stroke, however feeble, against hated
Hooja, I wheeled and ran directly toward the village.
<P>
When I reached the edge of the plateau such a scene
met my astonished gaze as never before had startled it,
for the unique battle-methods of the half-brutes were
rather the most remarkable I had ever witnessed.  Along
the very edge of the cliff-top stood a thin line of mighty
males--the best rope-throwers of the tribe.  A few feet
behind these the rest of the males, with the exception
of about twenty, formed a second line.  Still farther in
the rear all the women and young children were clustered into a single group under the protection of the remaining twenty fighting males and all the old males.
<P>
But it was the work of the first two lines that interested me.  The forces of Hooja--a great horde of
savage Sagoths and primeval cave men--were working their way up the steep cliff-face, their agility but
slightly less than that of my captors who had clambered
so nimbly aloft--even he who was burdened by my
weight.
<P>
As the attackers came on they paused occasionally
wherever a projection gave them sufficient foothold and
launched arrows and spears at the defenders above
them.  During the entire battle both sides hurled taunts
and insults at one another--the human beings naturally
excelling the brutes in the coarseness and vileness of
their vilification and invective.
<P>
The "firing-line" of the brute-men wielded no weapon
other than their long fiber nooses.  When a foeman came
within range of them a noose would settle unerringly
about him and be would be dragged, fighting and yelling, to the cliff-top, unless, as occasionally occurred, he
was quick enough to draw his knife and cut the rope
above him, in which event he usually plunged downward to a no less certain death than that which awaited
him above.
<P>
Those who were hauled up within reach of the powerful clutches of the defenders had the nooses snatched
from them and were catapulted back through the first
line to the second, where they were seized and killed
by the simple expedient of a single powerful closing
of mighty fangs upon the backs of their necks.
<P>
But the arrows of the invaders were taking a much
heavier toll than the nooses of the defenders and I foresaw that it was but a matter of time before Hooja's
forces must conquer unless the brute-men changed
their tactics, or the cave men tired of the battle.
<P>
Gr-gr-gr was standing in the center of the first line. 
All about him were boulders and large fragments of
broken rock.  I approached him and without a word
toppled a large mass of rock over the edge of the
cliff.  It fell directly upon the head of an archer, crushing him to instant death and carrying his mangled
corpse with it to the bottom of the declivity, and on its
way brushing three more of the attackers into the hereafter.
<P>
Gr-gr-gr turned toward me in surprise.  For an instant he appeared to doubt the sincerity of my motives. 
I felt that perhaps my time had come when he reached
for me with one of his giant paws; but I dodged him,
and running a few paces to the right hurled down
another missile.  It, too, did its allotted work of destruction.  Then I picked up smaller fragments and with all
the control and accuracy for which I had earned justly
deserved fame in my collegiate days I rained down a hail
of death upon those beneath me.
<P>
Gr-gr-gr was coming toward me again.  I pointed to
the litter of rubble upon the cliff-top.
<P>
"Hurl these down upon the enemy!" I cried to him. 
"Tell your warriors to throw rocks down upon them!"
<P>
At my words the others of the first line, who had been
interested spectators of my tactics, seized upon great
boulders or bits of rock, whichever came first to their
hands, and, without, waiting for a command from Gr-
gr-gr, deluged the terrified cave men with a perfect
avalanche of stone.  In less than no time the cliff-face
was stripped of enemies and the village of Gr-gr-gr was
saved.
<P>
Gr-gr-gr was standing beside me when the last of the
cave men disappeared in rapid flight down the valley. 
He was looking at me intently.
<P>
"Those were your people," he said.  "Why did you kill
them?"
<P>
"They were not my people," I returned.  "I have told
you that before, but you would not believe me.  Will you
believe me now when I tell you that I hate Hooja and his
tribe as much as you do? Will you believe me when I
tell you that I wish to be the friend of Gr-gr-gr?"
<P>
For some time he stood there beside me, scratching
his head.  Evidently it was no less difficult for him to
readjust his preconceived conclusions than it is for most
human beings; but finally the idea percolated--which it
might never have done had he been a man, or I might
qualify that statement by saying had he been some
men.  Finally he spoke.
<P>
"Gilak," he said, "you have made Gr-gr-gr ashamed. 
He would have killed you.  How can he reward you?"
<P>
"Set me free," I replied quickly.
<P>
"You are free," he said.  "You may go down when you
wish, or you may stay with us.  If you go you may always
return.  We are your friends."
<P>
Naturally, I elected to go.  I explained all over again
to Gr-gr-gr the nature of my mission.  He listened attentively; after I had done he offered to send some of his
people with me to guide me to Hooja's village.  I was not
slow in accepting his offer.
<P>
First, however, we must eat.  The hunters upon whom
Hooja's men had fallen had brought back the meat of a
great thag.  There would be a feast to commemorate the
victory--a feast and dancing.
<P>
I had never witnessed a tribal function of the brutefolk, though I had often heard strange sounds coming
from the village, where I had not been allowed since
my capture.  Now I took part in one of their orgies.
<P>
It will live forever in my memory.  The combination
of bestiality and humanity was oftentimes pathetic,
and again grotesque or horrible.  Beneath the glaring
noonday sun, in the sweltering heat of the mesa-top,
the huge, hairy creatures leaped in a great circle. 
They coiled and threw their fiber-ropes; they hurled
taunts and insults at an imaginary foe; they fell upon
the carcass of the thag and literally tore it to pieces; and
they ceased only when, gorged, they could no longer
move.
<P>
I had to wait until the processes of digestion had released my escort from its torpor.  Some had eaten until
their abdomens were so distended that I thought they
must burst, for beside the thag there had been fully a
hundred antelopes of various sizes and varied degrees
of decomposition, which they had unearthed from burial beneath the floors of their lairs to grace the banquetboard.
<P>
But at last we were started--six great males and
myself.  Gr-gr-gr had returned my weapons to me, and
at last I was once more upon my oft-interrupted way
toward my goal.  Whether I should find Dian at the end
of my journey or no I could not even surmise; but I
was none the less impatient to be off, for if only the
worst lay in store for me I wished to know even the
worst at once.
<P>
I could scarce believe that my proud mate would still
be alive in the power of Hooja; but time upon Pellucidar
is so strange a thing that I realized that to her or to him
only a few minutes might have elapsed since his subtle
trickery had enabled him to steal her away from Phutra. 
Or she might have found the means either to repel his
advances or escape him.
<P>
As we descended the cliff we disturbed a great pack
of large hyena-like beasts--hyaena spelaeus, Perry calls
them--who were busy among the corpses of the cave
men fallen in battle.  The ugly creatures were far from
the cowardly things that our own hyenas are reputed
to be; they stood their ground with bared fangs as we
approached them.  But, as I was later to learn, so formidable are the brute-folk that there are few even of
the larger carnivora that will not make way for them
when they go abroad.  So the hyenas moved a little
from our line of march, closing in again upon their feasts
when we had passed.
<P>
We made our way steadily down the rim of the beautiful river which flows the length of the island, coming
at last to a wood rather denser than any that I had before encountered in this country.  Well within this forest
my escort halted.
<P>
"There!" they said, and pointed ahead.  "We are to go
no farther."
<P>
Thus having guided me to my destination they left
me. Ahead of me, through the trees, I could see what
appeared to be the foot of a steep hill.  Toward this I
made my way.  The forest ran to the very base of a cliff,
in the face of which were the mouths of many caves. 
They appeared untenanted; but I decided to watch for a
while before venturing farther.  A large tree, densely
foliaged, offered a splendid vantage-point from which to
spy upon the cliff, so I clambered among its branches
where, securely hidden, I could watch what transpired
about the caves.
<P>
It seemed that I had scarcely settled myself in a
comfortable position before a party of cave men
emerged from one of the smaller apertures in the cliff-face, about fifty feet from the base.  They descended
into the forest and disappeared.  Soon after came several others from the same cave, and after them, at a
short interval, a score of women and children, who came
into the wood to gather fruit.  There were several warriors with them--a guard, I presume.
<P>
After this came other parties, and two or three
groups who passed out of the forest and up the cliff-face
to enter the same cave.  I could not understand it.  All
who came out had emerged from the same cave.  All
who returned reentered it.  No other cave gave evidence
of habitation, and no cave but one of extraordinary
size could have accommodated all the people whom I
had seen pass in and out of its mouth.
<P>
For a long time I sat and watched the coming and
going of great numbers of the cave-folk.  Not once did
one leave the cliff by any other opening save that from
which I had seen the first party come, nor did any
re-enter the cliff through another aperture.
<P>
What a cave it must be, I thought, that houses an entire tribe! But dissatisfied of the truth of my surmise, I
climbed higher among the branches of the tree that I
might get a better view of other portions of the cliff. 
High above the ground I reached a point whence I
could see the summit of the hill.  Evidently it was a flat-topped butte similar to that on which dwelt the tribe
of Gr-gr-gr.
<P>
As I sat gazing at it a figure appeared at the very
edge.  It was that of a young girl in whose hair was a
gorgeous bloom plucked from some flowering tree of
the forest.  I had seen her pass beneath me but a short
while before and enter the small cave that had
swallowed all of the returning tribesmen.
<P>
The mystery was solved.  The cave was but the mouth
of a passage that led upward through the cliff to the
summit of the hill.  It served merely as an avenue from
their lofty citadel to the valley below.
<P>
No sooner had the truth flashed upon me than the
realization came that I must seek some other means of
reaching the village, for to pass unobserved through this
well-traveled thoroughfare would be impossible.  At the
moment there was no one in sight below me, so I slid
quickly from my arboreal watch-tower to the ground
and moved rapidly away to the right with the intention
of circling the hill if necessary until I had found an unwatched spot where I might have some slight chance of
scaling the heights and reaching the top unseen.
<P>
I kept close to the edge of the forest, in the very midst
of which the hill seemed to rise.  Though I carefully
scanned the cliff as I traversed its base, I saw no sign of
any other entrance than that to which my guides had
led me.
<P>
After some little time the roar of the sea broke upon
my ears.  Shortly after I came upon the broad ocean
which breaks at this point at the very foot of the great
hill where Hooja had found safe refuge for himself and
his villains.
<P>
I was just about to clamber along the jagged rocks
which lie at the base of the cliff next to the sea, in
search of some foothold to the top, when I chanced to
see a canoe rounding the end of the island.  I threw myself down behind a large boulder where I could watch
the dugout and its occupants without myself being seen.
<P>
They paddled toward me for a while and then, about
a hundred yards from me, they turned straight in
toward the foot of the frowning cliffs.  From where I was
it seemed that they were bent upon self-destruction,
since the roar of the breakers beating upon the perpendicular rock-face appeared to offer only death to any one
who might venture within their relentless clutch.
<P>
A mass of rock would soon hide them from my view;
but so keen was the excitement of the instant that I
could not refrain from crawling forward to a point
whence I could watch the dashing of the small craft to
pieces on the jagged rocks that loomed before her, although I risked discovery from above to accomplish my
design.
<P>
When I had reached a point where I could again
see the dugout, I was just in time to see it glide unharmed between two needle-pointed sentinels of granite
and float quietly upon the unruffled bosom of a tiny
cove.
<P>
Again I crouched behind a boulder to observe what
would next transpire; nor did I have long to wait. 
The dugout, which contained but two men, was drawn
close to the rocky wall.  A fiber rope, one end of which
was tied to the boat, was made fast about a projection of
the cliff face.
<P>
Then the two men commenced the ascent of the
almost perpendicular wall toward the summit several
hundred feet above.  I looked on in amazement, for,
splendid climbers though the cave men of Pellucidar
are, I never before had seen so remarkable a feat performed.  Upwardly they moved without a pause, to disappear at last over the summit.
<P>
When I felt reasonably sure that they had gone for
a while at least I crawled from my hiding-place and
at the risk of a broken neck leaped and scrambled to the
spot where their canoe was moored.
<P>
If they had scaled that cliff I could, and if I couldn't
I should die in the attempt.
<P>
But when I turned to the accomplishment of the task
I found it easier than I had imagined it would be, since
I immediately discovered that shallow hand and footholds had been scooped in the cliff's rocky face, forming
a crude ladder from the base to the summit.
<P>
At last I reached the top, and very glad I was, too. 
Cautiously I raised my head until my eyes were above
the cliff-crest.  Before me spread a rough mesa, liberally
sprinkled with large boulders.  There was no village in
sight nor any living creature.
<P>
I drew myself to level ground and stood erect.  A few
trees grew among the boulders.  Very carefully I advanced from tree to tree and boulder to boulder toward
the inland end of the mesa.  I stopped often to listen
and look cautiously about me in every direction.
<P>
How I wished that I had my revolvers and rifle! I
would not have to worm my way like a scared cat
toward Hooja's village, nor did I relish doing so now; but
Dian's life might hinge upon the success of my venture,
and so I could not afford to take chances.  To have met
suddenly with discovery and had a score or more of
armed warriors upon me might have been very grand
and heroic; but it would have immediately put an end
to all my earthly activities, nor have accomplished
aught in the service of Dian.
<P>
Well, I must have traveled nearly a mile across that
mesa without seeing a sign of anyone, when all of a sudden, as I crept around the edge of a boulder, I ran
plump into a man, down on all fours like myself, crawling toward me.
<P>
