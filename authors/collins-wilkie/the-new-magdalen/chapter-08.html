<P>
After an interval of rest Mercy was aroused by the shutting of a
glass door at the far end of the conservatory. This door, leading
into the garden, was used only by the inmates of the house, or by
old friends privileged to enter the reception-rooms by that way.
Assuming that either Horace or Lady Janet was returning to the
dining-room, Mercy raised herself a little on the' sofa and
listened.
<P>
The voice of one of the men-servants caught her ear. It was
answered by another voice, which instantly set her trembling in
every limb.
<P>
She started up, and listened again in speechless terror. Yes!
there was no mistaking it. The voice that was answering the
servant was the unforgotten voice which she had heard at the
Refuge. The visitor who had come in by the glass door was--Julian
Gray!
<P>
His rapid footsteps advanced nearer and nearer to the
dining-room. She recovered herself sufficiently to hurry to the
library door. Her hand shook so that she failed at first to open
it. She had just succeeded when she heard him again--speaking to
her.
<P>
"Pray don't run away! I am nothing very formidable. Only Lady
Janet's nephew--Julian Gray."
<P>
She turned slowly, spell-bound by his voice, and confronted him
in silence.
<P>
He was standing, hat in hand, at the entrance to the
conservatory, dressed in black, and wearing a white cravat, but
with a studious avoidance of anything specially clerical in the
make and form of his clothes. Young as he was, there were marks
of care already on his face, and the hair was prematurely thin
and scanty over his forehead. His slight, active figure was of no
more than the middle height. His complexion was pale. The lower
part of his face, without beard or whiskers, was in no way
remarkable. An average observer would have passed him by without
notice but for his eyes. These alone made a marked man of him.
The unusual size of the orbits in which they were set was enough
of itself to attract attention; it gave a grandeur to his head,
which the head, broad and firm as it was, did not possess. As to
the eyes themselves, the soft, lustrous brightness of them defied
analysis No two people could agree about their color; divided
opinion declaring alternately that they were dark gray or black.
Painters had tried to reproduce them, and had given up the
effort, in despair of seizing any one expression in the
bewildering variety of expressions which they presented to view.
They were eyes that could charm at one moment and terrify at
another; eyes that could set people laughing or crying almost at
will. In action and in repose they were irresistible alike. When
they first descried Mercy running to the door, they brightened
gayly with the merriment of a child. When she turned and faced
him, they changed instantly, softening and glowing as they mutely
owned the interest and the admiration which the first sight of
her had roused in him. His tone and manner altered at the same
time. He addressed her with the deepest respect when he spoke his
next words.
<P>
"Let me entreat you to favor me by resuming your seat," he said.
"And let me ask your pardon if I have thoughtlessly intruded on
you."
<P>
He paused, waiting for her reply before he advanced into the
room. Still spell-bound by his voice, she recovered self-control
enough to bow to him and to resume her place on the sofa. It was
impossible to leave him now. After looking at her for a moment,
he entered the room without speaking to her again. She was
beginning to perplex as well as to interest him. "No common
sorrow," he thought, "has set its mark on that woman's face; no
common heart beats in that woman's breast. Who can she be?"
<P>
Mercy rallied her courage, and forced herself to speak to him.
<P>
"Lady Janet is in the library, I believe," she said, timidly.
"Shall I tell her you are here?"
<P>
"Don't disturb Lady Janet, and don't disturb yourself." With that
answer he approached the luncheon-table, delicately giving her
time to feel more at her ease. He took up what Horace had left of
the bottle of claret, and poured it into a glass. "My aunt's
claret shall represent my aunt for the present," he said,
smiling, as he turned toward her once more. "I have had a long
walk, and I may venture to help myself in this house without
invitation. Is it useless to offer you anything?"
<P>
Mercy made the necessary reply. She was beginning already, after
her remarkable experience of him, to wonder at his easy manners
and his light way of talking.
<P>
He emptied his glass with the air of a man who thoroughly
understood and enjoyed good wine. "My aunt's claret is worthy of
my aunt," he said, with comic gravity, as he set down the glass.
"Both are the genuine products of Nature." He seated himself at
the table and looked critically at the different dishes left on
it. One dish especially attracted his attention. "What is this?"
he went on. "A French pie! It seems grossly unfair to taste
French wine and to pass over French pie without notice." He took
up a knife and fork, and enjoyed the pie as critically as he had
enjoyed the wine. "Worthy of the Great Nation!" he exclaimed,
with enthusiasm. "_Vive la France!_"
<P>
Mercy listened and looked, in inexpressible astonishment. He was
utterly unlike the picture which her fancy had drawn of him in
everyday life. Take off his white cravat, and nobody would have
discovered that this famous preacher was a clergyman!
<P>
He helped himself to another plateful of the pie, and spoke more
directly to Mercy, alternately eating and talking as composedly
and pleasantly as if they had known each other for years.
<P>
"I came here by way of Kensington Gardens," he said. "For some
time past I have been living in a flat, ugly, barren,
agricultural district. You can't think how pleasant I found the
picture presented by the Gardens, as a contrast. The ladies in
their rich winter dresses, the smart nursery maids, the lovely
children, the ever moving crowd skating on the ice of the Round
Pond; it was all so exhilarating after what I have been used to,
that I actually caught myself whistling as I walked through the
brilliant scene! (In my time boys used always to whistle when
they were in good spirits, and I have not got over the habit
yet.) Who do you think I met when I was in full song?"
<P>
As well as her amazement would let her, Mercy excused herself
from guessing. She had never in all her life before spoken to any
living being so confusedly and so unintelligently as she now
spoke to Julian Gray!
<P>
He went on more gayly than ever, without appearing to notice the
effect that he had produced on her.
<P>
"Whom did I meet," he repeated, "when I was in full song? My
bishop! If I had been whistling a sacred melody, his lordship
might perhaps have excused my vulgarity out of consideration for
my music. Unfortunately, the composition I was executing at the
moment (I am one of the loudest of living whistlers) was by
Verdi--" La Donna e Mobile"--familiar, no doubt, to his lordship
on the street organs. He recognized the tune, poor man, and when
I took off my hat to him he looked the other way. Strange, in a
world that is bursting with sin and sorrow, to treat such a
trifle seriously as a cheerful clergyman whistling a tune!" He
pushed away his plate as he said the last words, and went on
simply and earnestly in an altered tone. "I have never been
able," he said, "to see why we should assert ourselves among
other men as belonging to a particular caste, and as being
forbidden, in any harmless thing, to do as other people do. The
disciples of old set us no such example; they were wiser and
better than we are. I venture to say that one of the worst
obstacles in the way of our doing good among our fellow-creatures
is raised by the mere assumption of the clerical manner and the
clerical voice. For my part, I set up no claim to be more sacred
and more reverend than any other Christian man who does what good
he can." He glanced brightly at Mercy, looking at him in helpless
perplexity. The spirit of fun took possession of him again. "Are
you a Radical?" he asked, with a humorous twinkle in his large
lustrous eyes. "I am!"
<P>
Mercy tried hard to understand him, and tried in vain. Could this
be the preacher whose words had charmed, purified, ennobled her?
Was this the man whose sermon had drawn tears from women about
her whom she knew to be shameless and hardened in crime? Yes! The
eyes that now rested on her humorously were the beautiful eyes
which had once looked into her soul. The voice that had just
addressed a jesting question to her was the deep and mellow voice
which had once thrilled her to the heart. In the pulpit he was an
angel of mercy; out of the pulpit he was a boy let loose from
school.
<P>
"Don't let me startle you," he said, good-naturedly, noticing her
confusion. "Public opinion has called me by harder names than the
name of 'Radical.' I have been spending my time lately--as I told
you just now--in an agricultural district. My business there was
to perform the duty for the rector of the place, who wanted a
holiday. How do you think the experiment has ended? The Squire of
the parish calls me a Communist; the farmers denounce me as an
Incendiary; my friend the rector has been recalled in a hurry,
and I have now the honor of speaking to you in the character of a
banished man who has made a respectable neighborhood too hot to
hold him."
<P>
With that frank avowal he left the luncheon table, and took a
chair near Mercy.
<P>
"You will naturally be anxious," he went on, "to know what my
offense was. Do you understand Political Economy and the Laws of
Supply and Demand?"
<P>
Mercy owned that she did _not_ understand them.
<P>
"No more do I--in a Christian country," he said. "That was my
offense. You shall hear my confession (just as my aunt will hear
it) in two words." He paused for a little while; his variable
manner changed again. Mercy, shyly looking at him, saw a new
expression in his eyes--an expression which recalled her first
remembrance of him as nothing had recalled it yet. "I had no
idea," he resumed, "of what the life of a farm-laborer really
was, in some parts of England, until I undertook the rector's
duties. Never before had I seen such dire wretchedness as I saw
in the cottages. Never before had I met with such noble patience
under suffering as I found among the people. The martyrs of old
could endure, and die. I asked myself if they could endure, and
_live_, like the martyrs whom I saw round me?--live, week after
week, month after month, year after year, on the brink of
starvation; live, and see their pining children growing up round
them, to work and want in their turn; live, with the poor man's
parish prison to look to as the end, when hunger and labor have
done their worst! Was God's beautiful earth made to hold such
misery as this? I can hardly think of it, I can hardly speak of
it, even now, with dry eyes!"
<P>
His head sank on his breast. He waited--mastering his emotion
before he spoke again. Now, at last, she knew him once more. Now
he was the man, indeed, whom she had expected to see.
Unconsciously she sat listening, with her eyes fixed on his face,
with his heart hanging on his words, in the very attitude of the
by-gone day when she had heard him for the first time!
<P>
"I did all I could to plead for the helpless ones," he resumed.
"I went round among the holders of the land to say a word for the
tillers of the land. 'These patient people don't want much' (I
said); 'in the name of Christ, give them enough to live on!'
Political Economy shrieked at the horrid proposal; the Laws of
Supply and Demand veiled their majestic faces in dismay.
Starvation wages were the right wages, I was told. And why?
Because the laborer was obliged to accept them! I determined, so
far as one man could do it, that the laborer should _not_ be
obliged to accept them. I collected my own resources--I wrote to
my friends--and I removed some of the poor fellows to parts of
England where their work was better paid. Such was the conduct
which made the neighborhood too hot to hold me. So let it be! I
mean to go on. I am known in London; I can raise subscriptions.
The vile Laws of Supply and Demand shall find labor scarce in
that agricultural district; and pitiless Political Economy shall
spend a few extra shillings on the poor, as certainly as I am
that Radical, Communist, and Incendiary--Julian Gray!"
<P>
He rose--making a li ttle gesture of apology for the warmth with
which he had spoken--and took a turn in the room. Fired by _his_
enthusiasm, Mercy followed him. Her purse was in her hand, when
he turned and faced her.
<P>
"Pray let me offer my little tribute--such as it is!" she said,
eagerly.
<P>
A momentary flush spread over his pale cheeks as he looked at the
beautiful compassionate face pleading with him.
<P>
"No! no!" he said, smiling; "though I am a parson, I don't carry
the begging-box everywhere." Mercy attempted to press the purse
on him. The quaint humor began to twinkle again in his eyes as he
abruptly drew back from it. "Don't tempt me!" he said. "The
frailest of all human creatures is a clergyman tempted by a
subscription." Mercy persisted, and conquered; she made him prove
the truth of his own profound observation of clerical human
nature by taking a piece of money from the purse. "If I must take
it--I must!" he remarked. "Thank you for setting the good
example! thank you for giving the timely help! What name shall I
put down on my list?"
<P>
Mercy's eyes looked confusedly away from him. "No name," she
said, in a low voice. "My subscription is anonymous."
<P>
As she replied, the library door opened. To her infinite
relief--to Julian's secret disappointment--Lady Janet Roy and
Horace Holmcroft entered the room together.
<P>
"Julian!" exclaimed Lady Janet, holding up her hands in
astonishment.
<P>
He kissed his aunt on the cheek. "Your ladyship is looking
charmingly." He gave his hand to Horace. Horace took it, and
passed on to Mercy. They walked away together slowly to the other
end of the room. Julian seized on the chance which left him free
to speak privately to his aunt.
<P>
"I came in through the conservatory," he said. "And I found that
young lady in the room. Who is she?"
<P>
"Are you very much interested in her?" asked Lady Janet, in her
gravely ironical way.
<P>
Julian answered in one expressive word. "Indescribably!"
<P>
Lady Janet called to Mercy to join her.
<P>
"My dear," she said, "let me formally present my nephew to you.
Julian, this is Miss Grace Roseberry--" She suddenly checked
herself. The instant she pronounced the name, Julian started as
if it was a surprise to him. "What is it?" she asked, sharply.
<P>
"Nothing," he answered, bowing to Mercy, with a marked absence of
his former ease of manner. She returned the courtesy a little
restrainedly on her side. She, too, had seen him start when Lady
Janet mentioned the name by which she was known. The start meant
something. What could it be? Why did he turn aside, after bowing
to her, and address himself to Horace, with an absent look in his
face, as if his thoughts were far away from his words? A complete
change had come over him; and it dated from the moment when his
aunt had pronounced the name that was not _her_ name---the name
that she had stolen!
<P>
Lady Janet claimed Julian's attention, and left Horace free to
return to Mercy. "Your room is ready for you," she said. "You
will stay here, of course?" Julian accepted the
invitation---still with the air of a man whose mind was
preoccupied. Instead of looking at his aunt when he made his
reply, he looked round at Mercy with a troubled curiosity in his
face, very strange to see. Lady Janet tapped him impatiently on
the shoulder. "I expect people to look at me when people speak to
me," she said. "What are you staring at my adopted daughter for?"
<P>
"Your adopted daughter?" Julian repeated--looking at his aunt
this time, and looking very earnestly.
<P>
"Certainly! As Colonel Roseberry's daughter, she is connected
with me by marriage already. Did you think I had picked up a
foundling?"
<P>
Julian's face cleared; he looked relieved. "I had forgotten the
Colonel," he answered. "Of course the young lady is related to
us, as you say."
<P>
"Charmed, I am sure, to have satisfied you that Grace is not an
impostor," said Lady Janet, with satirical humility. She took
Julian's arm and drew him out of hearing of Horace and Mercy.
"About that letter of yours?" she proceeded. "There is one line
in it that rouses my curiosity. Who is the mysterious 'lady' whom
you wish to present to me?"
<P>
Julian started, and changed color.
<P>
"I can't tell you now," he said, in a whisper.
<P>
"Why not?"
<P>
To Lady Janet's unutterable astonishment, instead of replying,
Julian looked round at her adopted daughter once more.
<P>
"What has _she_ got to do with it?" asked the old lady, out of
all patience with him.
<P>
"It is impossible for me to tell you," he answered, gravely,
"while Miss Roseberry is in the room."
