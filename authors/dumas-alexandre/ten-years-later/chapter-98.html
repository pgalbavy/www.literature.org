<P>The clock of St. Paul was striking seven as Aramis, on
horseback, dressed as a simple citizen, that is to say, in
colored suit, with no distinctive mark about him, except a
kind of hunting-knife by his side, passed before the Rue du
Petit-Muse, and stopped opposite the Rue des Tourelles, at
the gate of the Bastile. Two sentinels were on duty at the
gate; they made no difficulty about admitting Aramis, who
entered without dismounting, and they pointed out the way he
was to go by a long passage with buildings on both sides.
This passage led to the drawbridge, or, in other words, to
the real entrance. The drawbridge was down, and the duty of
the day was about being entered upon. The sentinel at the
outer guardhouse stopped Aramis's further progress, asking
him, in a rough tone of voice, what had brought him there.
Aramis explained, with his usual politeness, that a wish to
speak to M. Baisemeaux de Montlezun had occasioned his
visit. The first sentinel then summoned a second sentinel,
stationed within an inner lodge, who showed his face at the
grating, and inspected the new arrival most attentively.
Aramis reiterated the expression of his wish to see the
governor, whereupon the sentinel called to an officer of
lower grade, who was walking about in a tolerably spacious
courtyard and who, in turn, on being informed of his object,
ran to seek one of the officers of the governor's staff. The
latter, after having listened to Aramis's request, begged
him to wait a moment, then went away a short distance, but
returned to ask his name. &quot;I cannot tell it you, monsieur,&quot;
said Aramis, &quot;I need only mention that I have matters of
such importance to communicate to the governor, that I can
only rely beforehand upon one thing, that M. de Baisemeaux
will be delighted to see me; nay, more than that, when you
have told him that it is the person whom he expected on the
first of June, I am convinced he will hasten here himself.&quot;
The officer could not possibly believe that a man of the
governor's importance should put himself out for a person of
so little importance as the citizen-looking visitor on
horseback. &quot;It happens most fortunately, monsieur,&quot; he said,
&quot;that the governor is just going out, and you can perceive
his carriage with the horses already harnessed, in the
courtyard yonder; there will be no occasion for him to come
to meet you, as he will see you as he passes by.&quot; Aramis
bowed to signify his assent; he did not wish to inspire
others with too exalted an opinion of himself, and therefore
waited patiently and in silence, leaning upon the saddle-bow
of his horse. Ten minutes had hardly elapsed when the
governor's carriage was observed to move. The governor
appeared at the door, and got into the carriage, which
immediately prepared to start. The same ceremony was
observed for the governor himself as with a suspected
stranger; the sentinel at the lodge advanced as the carriage
was about to pass under the arch, and the governor opened
the carriage-door, himself setting the example of obedience
to orders; so that, in this way, the sentinel could convince
himself that no one quitted the Bastile improperly. The
carriage rolled along under the archway, but at the moment
the iron-gate was opened, the officer approached the
carriage, which had been again stopped, and said something
to the governor, who immediately put his head out of the
door-way, and perceived Aramis on horseback at the end of
the drawbridge. He immediately uttered almost a shout of
delight, and got out, or rather darted out of his carriage,
running towards Aramis, whose hands he seized, making a
thousand apologies. He almost embraced him. &quot;What a
difficult matter to enter the Bastile!&quot; said Aramis. &quot;Is it
the same for those who are sent here against their wills, as
for those who come of their own accord?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A thousand pardons, my lord. How delighted I am to see your
Grace!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hush! What are you thinking of, my dear M. Baisemeaux? What
do you suppose would be thought of a bishop in my present
costume?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pray, excuse me, I had forgotten. Take this gentleman's
horse to the stables,&quot; cried Baisemeaux.</P>
<P>&quot;No, no,&quot; said Aramis; &quot;I have five thousand pistoles in the
saddle-bags.&quot;</P>
<P>The governor's countenance became so radiant, that if the
prisoners had seen him they would have imagined some prince
of the blood royal had arrived. &quot;Yes, you are right, the
horse shall be taken to the government house. Will you get
into the carriage, my dear M. d'Herblay? and it shall take
us back to my house.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Get into a carriage to cross a courtyard! do you believe I
am so great an invalid? No, no, we will go on foot.&quot;</P>
<P>Baisemeaux then offered his arm as a support, but the
prelate did not accept it. They arrived in this manner at
the government house, Baisemeaux rubbing his hands and
glancing at the horse from time to time, while Aramis was
looking at the bleak bare walls. A tolerably handsome
vestibule and a staircase of white stone led to the
governor's apartments, who crossed the ante-chamber, the
dining-room, where breakfast was being prepared, opened a
small side door, and closeted himself with his guest in a
large cabinet, the windows of which opened obliquely upon
the courtyard and the stables. Baisemeaux installed the
prelate with that all-inclusive politeness of which a good
man, or a grateful man, alone possesses the secret. An
arm-chair, a footstool, a small table beside him, on which
to rest his hand, everything was prepared by the governor
himself. With his own hands, too, he placed upon the table,
with much solicitude, the bag containing the gold, which one
of the soldiers had brought up with the most respectful
devotion; and the soldier having left the room, Baisemeaux
himself closed the door after him, drew aside one of the
window-curtains, and looked steadfastly at Aramis to see if
the prelate required anything further.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, my lord,&quot; he said, still standing up, &quot;of all men of
their word, you still continue to be the most punctual.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In matters of business, dear M. de Baisemeaux, exactitude
is not a virtue only, it is a duty as well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, in matters of business, certainly; but what you have
with me is not of that character; it is a service you are
rendering me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Come, confess, dear M. de Baisemeaux, that, notwithstanding
this exactitude, you have not been without a little
uneasiness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;About your health, I certainly have,&quot; stammered out
Baisemeaux.</P>
<P>&quot;I wished to come here yesterday, but I was not able, as I
was too fatigued,&quot; continued Aramis. Baisemeaux anxiously
slipped another cushion behind his guest's back. &quot;But,&quot;
continued Aramis, &quot;I promised myself to come and pay you a
visit to-day, early in the morning.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are really very kind, my lord.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And it was a good thing for me I was punctual, I think.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, you were going out.&quot; At which latter remark Baisemeaux
colored and said, &quot;It is true I was going out.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then I prevent you,&quot; said Aramis; whereupon the
embarrassment of Baisemeaux became visibly greater. &quot;I am
putting you to inconvenience,&quot; he continued, fixing a keen
glance upon the poor governor; &quot;if I had known that, I
should not have come.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How can your lordship imagine that you could ever
inconvenience me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Confess you were going in search of money.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; stammered out Baisemeaux, &quot;no! I assure you I was
going to  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Does the governor still intend to go to M. Fouquet?&quot;
suddenly called out the major from below. Baisemeaux ran to
the window like a madman. &quot;No, no,&quot; he exclaimed in a state
of desperation, &quot;who the deuce is speaking of M. Fouquet?
are you drunk below there? why an I interrupted when I am
engaged on business?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You were going to M. Fouquet's,&quot; said Aramis biting his
lips, &quot;to M. Fouquet, the abbe, or the superintendent?&quot;</P>
<P>Baisemeaux almost made up his mind to tell an untruth, but
he could not summon courage to do so. &quot;To the
superintendent,&quot; he said.</P>
<P>&quot;It is true, then, that you were in want of money, since you
were going to a person who gives it away!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I assure you, my lord  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You were afraid?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My dear lord, it was the uncertainty and ignorance in which
I was as to where you were to be found.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You would have found the money you require at M. Fouquet's,
for he is a man whose hand is always open.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I swear that I should never have ventured to ask M. Fouquet
for money. I only wished to ask him for your address.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To ask M. Fouquet for my address?&quot; exclaimed Aramis,
opening his eyes in real astonishment.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Baisemeaux, greatly disturbed by the glance
which the prelate fixed upon him,  -  &quot;at M. Fouquet's
certainly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is no harm in that, dear M. Baisemeaux, only I would
ask, why ask my address of M. Fouquet?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That I might write to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I understand,&quot; said Aramis, smiling, &quot;but that is not what
I meant; I do not ask you what you required my address for;
I only ask why you should go to M. Fouquet for it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Baisemeaux, &quot;as Belle-Isle is the property of M.
Fouquet, and as Belle-Isle is in the diocese of Vannes, and
as you are bishop of Vannes  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, my dear Baisemeaux, since you knew I was bishop of
Vannes, you had no occasion to ask M. Fouquet for my
address.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, monsieur,&quot; said Baisemeaux, completely at bay, &quot;if I
have acted indiscreetly, I beg your pardon most sincerely.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; observed Aramis, calmly: &quot;how can you possibly
have acted indiscreetly?&quot; And while he composed his face,
and continued to smile cheerfully on the governor, he was
considering how Baisemeaux, who was not aware of his
address, knew, however, that Vannes was his residence. &quot;I
shall clear all this up,&quot; he said to himself, and then
speaking aloud, added,  -  &quot;Well, my dear governor, shall we
now arrange our little accounts?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am at your orders, my lord; but tell me beforehand, my
lord, whether you will do me the honor to breakfast with me
as usual?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very willingly, indeed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thai's well,&quot; said Baisemeaux, as he struck the bell before
him three times.</P>
<P>&quot;What does that mean?&quot; inquired Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;That I have some one to breakfast with me, and that
preparations are to be made accordingly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you rang thrice. Really, my dear governor, I begin to
think you are acting ceremoniously with me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, indeed. Besides, the least I can do is to receive you
in the best way I can.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But why so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because not even a prince could have done what you have
done for me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nonsense! nonsense!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nay, I assure you  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us speak of other matters,&quot; said Aramis. &quot;Or rather,
tell me how your affairs here are getting on.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not over well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The deuce!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;M. de Mazarin was not hard enough.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I see; you require a government full of suspicion  - 
like that of the old cardinal, for instance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; matters went on better under him. The brother of his
`gray eminence' made his fortune here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Believe me, my dear governor,&quot; said Aramis, drawing closer
to Baisemeaux, &quot;a young king is well worth an old cardinal.
Youth has its suspicions, its fits of anger, its prejudices,
as old age has its hatreds, its precautions, and its fears.
Have you paid your three years' profits to Louviere and
Tremblay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Most certainly I have.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So that you have nothing more to give them than the fifty
thousand francs I have brought with me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you not saved anything, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My lord, in giving the fifty thousand francs of my own to
these gentlemen, I assure you that I give them everything I
gain. I told M. d'Artagnan so yesterday evening.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Aramis, whose eyes sparkled for a moment, but
became immediately afterwards as unmoved as before; &quot;so you
have seen my old friend D'Artagnan; how was he?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wonderfully well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what did you say to him, M. de Baisemeaux?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I told him,&quot; continued the governor, not perceiving his own
thoughtlessness, &quot;I told him that I fed my prisoners too
well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How many have you?&quot; inquired Aramis, in an indifferent tone
of voice.</P>
<P>&quot;Sixty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, that is a tolerably round number.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In former times, my lord, there were, during certain years,
as many as two hundred.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Still a minimum of sixty is not to be grumbled at.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps not; for, to anybody but myself, each prisoner
would bring in two hundred and fifty pistoles; for instance,
for a prince of the blood I have fifty francs a day.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Only you have no prince of the blood; at least, I suppose
so,&quot; said Aramis, with a slight tremor in his voice.</P>
<P>&quot;No, thank Heaven!  -  I mean, no, unfortunately.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you mean by unfortunately?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because my appointment would be improved by it. So, fifty
francs per day for a prince of the blood, thirty-six for a
marechal of France  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But you have as many marechals of France, I suppose, as you
have princes of the blood?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alas! no more. It is true lieutenant-generals and
brigadiers pay twenty-six francs, and I have two of them.
After that, come councilors of parliament, who bring me
fifteen francs, and I have six of them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I did not know,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;that councilors were so
productive.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but from fifteen francs I sink at once to ten francs;
namely, for an ordinary judge, and for an ecclesiastic.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you have seven, you say; an excellent affair.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nay, a bad one, and for this reason. How can I possibly
treat these poor fellows, who are of some good, at all
events, otherwise than as a councilor of parliament?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, you are right; I do not see five francs difference
between them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You understand; if I have a fine fish, I pay four or five
francs for it; if I get a fine fowl, it costs me a franc and
a half. I fatten a good deal of poultry, but I have to buy
grain, and you cannot imagine the army of rats that infest
this place.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not get half a dozen cats to deal with them?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Cats, indeed; yes, they eat them, but I was obliged to give
up the idea because of the way in which they treated my
grain. I have been obliged to have some terrier dogs sent me
from England to kill the rats. These dogs, unfortunately,
have tremendous appetites; they eat as much as a prisoner of
the fifth order, without taking into account the rabbits and
fowls they kill.&quot;</P>
<P>Was Aramis really listening or not? No one could have told;
his downcast eyes showed the attentive man; but the restless
hand betrayed the man absorbed in thought  -  Aramis was
meditating.</P>
<P>&quot;I was saying,&quot; continued Baisemeaux, &quot;that a good-sized
fowl costs me a franc and a half, and that a fine fish costs
me four or five francs. Three meals are served at the
Bastile, and, as the prisoners, having nothing to do, are
always eating, a ten-franc man costs me seven francs and a
half.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But did you not say that you treated those at ten francs
like those at fifteen?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, certainly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well! Then you gain seven francs and a half upon those
who pay you fifteen francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I must compensate myself somehow,&quot; said Baisemeaux, who saw
how he had been snapped up.</P>
<P>&quot;You are quite right, my dear governor; but have you no
prisoners below ten francs?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yes! we have citizens and barristers at five francs.</P>
<P>&quot;And do they eat, too?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not a doubt about it; only you understand that they do not
get fish or poultry, nor rich wines at every meal; but at
all events thrice a week they have a good dish at their
dinner.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Really, you are quite a philanthropist, my dear governor,
and you will ruin yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, understand me; when the fifteen-franc has not eaten his
fowl, or the ten-franc has left his dish unfinished, I send
it to the five-franc prisoner; it is a feast for the poor
devil, and one must be charitable, you know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what do you make out of your five-franc prisoners?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A franc and a half.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Baisemeaux, you're an honest fellow; in honest truth I say
so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, my lord. But I feel most for the small tradesmen
and bailiffs' clerks, who are rated at three francs. They do
not often see Rhine carp or Channel sturgeon.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But do not the five-franc gentlemen sometimes leave some
scraps?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! my lord, do not believe I am so stingy as that; I
delight the heart of some poor little tradesman or clerk by
sending him a wing of a red partridge, a slice of venison,
or a slice of a truffled pasty, dishes which he never tasted
except in his dreams; these are the leavings of the
twenty-four franc prisoners; and as he eats and drinks, at
dessert he cries `Long live the King,' and blesses the
Bastile; with a couple of bottles of champagne, which cost
me five sous, I made him tipsy every Sunday. That class of
people call down blessings upon me, and are sorry to leave
the prison. Do you know that I have remarked, and it does me
infinite honor, that certain prisoners, who have been set at
liberty, have, almost immediately afterwards, got imprisoned
again? Why should this be the case, unless it be to enjoy
the pleasures of my kitchen? It is really the fact.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis smiled with an expression of incredulity.</P>
<P>&quot;You smile,&quot; said Baisemeaux.</P>
<P>&quot;I do,&quot; returned Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;I tell you that we have names which have been inscribed on
our books thrice in the space of two years.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I must see it before I believe it,&quot; said Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I can show it to you, although it is prohibited to
communicate the registers to strangers; and if you really
wish to see it with your own eyes  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I should be delighted, I confess.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Baisemeaux, and he took out of a cupboard
a large register. Aramis followed him most anxiously with
his eyes, and Baisemeaux returned, placed the register upon
the table, and turned over the leaves for a minute, and
stayed at the letter M.</P>
<P>&quot;Look here,&quot; said he, &quot;Martinier, January, 1659; Martinier,
June, 1660; Martinier, March, 1661. Mazarinades, etc.; you
understand it was only a pretext; people were not sent to
the Bastile for jokes against M. Mazarin; the fellow
denounced himself in order to get imprisoned here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what was his object?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;None other than to return to my kitchen at three francs a
day,.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Three francs  -  poor devil!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The poet, my lord, belongs to the lowest scale, the same
style of board as the small tradesman and bailiff's clerk;
but I repeat, it is to those people only that I give these
little surprises.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis mechanically turned over the leaves of the register,
continuing to read the names, but without appearing to take
any interest in the names he read.</P>
<P>&quot;In 1661, you perceive,&quot; said Baisemeaux, &quot;eighty entries;
and in 1659, eighty also.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Aramis. &quot;Seldon; I seem to know that name. Was it
not you who spoke to me about a certain young man?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, a poor devil of a student, who made  -  What do you
call that where two Latin verses rhyme together?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A distich.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; that is it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Poor fellow; for a distich.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you know that he made this distich against the Jesuits?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That makes no difference; the punishment seems very
severe.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do not pity him; last year you seemed to interest yourself
in him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I did so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, as your interest is all-powerful here, my lord, I
have treated him since that time as a prisoner at fifteen
francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The same as this one, then,&quot; said Aramis, who had continued
turning over the leaves, and who had stopped at one of the
names which followed Martinier.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, the same as that one.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is that Marchiali an Italian?&quot; said Aramis, pointing with
his finger to the name which had attracted his attention.</P>
<P>&quot;Hush!&quot; said Baisemeaux.</P>
<P>&quot;Why hush?&quot; said Aramis, involuntarily clenching his white
hand.</P>
<P>&quot;I thought I had already spoken to you about that
Marchiali.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, it is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That may be, but perhaps I have spoken to you about him
without naming him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is he an old offender?&quot; asked Aramis, attempting to smile.</P>
<P>&quot;On the contrary, he is quite young.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is his crime, then, very heinous?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Unpardonable.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Has he assassinated any one?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bah!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;An incendiary, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bah!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Has he slandered any one?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no! It is he who  -  &quot; and Baisemeaux approached
Aramis's ear, making a sort of ear-trumpet of his hands, and
whispered: &quot;It is he who presumes to resemble the  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes.&quot; said Aramis, &quot;I now remember you already spoke
about it last year to me; but the crime appeared to me so
slight.</P>
<P>&quot;Slight, do you say?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Or rather, so involuntary.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My lord, it is not involuntarily that such a resemblance is
detected.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, the fact is, I had forgotten it. But, my dear host,&quot;
said Aramis, closing the register, &quot;if I am not mistaken, we
are summoned.&quot;</P>
<P>Baisemeaux took the register, hastily restored it to its
place in the closet, which he locked, and put the key in his
pocket. &quot;Will it be agreeable to your lordship to breakfast
now?&quot; said he; &quot;for you are right in supposing that
breakfast was announced.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Assuredly, my dear governor,&quot; and they passed into the
dining-room.</P></article>
