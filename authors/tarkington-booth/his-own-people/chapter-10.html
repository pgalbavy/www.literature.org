<p>A ten o'clock, a page bearing a card upon a silver tray knocked
upon the door, and stared with wide-eyed astonishment at the disordered
gentleman who opened it.</p>

<p>The card was Lady Mount-Rhyswicke's. Underneath the name was
written:</p>

<p>If you are there will you give me a few minutes? I am waiting
in a cab at the next corner by the fountain.</p>

<p>Mellin's hand shook as he read. He did not doubt that she came
as an emissary; probably they meant to hound him for payment of
the note he had given Sneyd, and at that thought he could have
shrieked with hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>"Do you speak English?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Spik little. Yes."</p>

<p>"Who gave you this card?"</p>

<p>"Coachman," said the boy. "He wait risposta."</p>

<p>"Tell him to say that I shall be there in five minutes."</p>

<p>"Fi' minute. Yes. Good-by."</p>

<p>Mellin was partly dressed&mdash;he had risen half an hour earlier
and had been distractedly pacing the floor when the page knocked&mdash;and
he completed his toilet quickly. He passed down the corridors,
descended by the stairway (feeling that to use the elevator would
be another abuse of the confidence of the hotel company) and slunk
across the lobby with the look and the sensations of a tramp who
knows that he will be kicked into the street if anybody catches
sight of him.</p>

<p>A closed cab stood near the fountain at the next corner. There
was a trunk on the box by the driver, and the roof was piled with
bags and rugs. He approached uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is this&mdash;is it Lady Mount-Rhyswicke?" he stammered pitifully.</p>

<p>She opened the door.</p>

<p>"Yes. Will you get in? We'll just drive round the block if you
don't mind. I'll bring you back here in ten minutes." And when
he had tremulously complied, "<em>Avanti, cocchiere</em>," she
called to the driver, and the tired little cab-horse began to
draw them slowly along the deserted street.</p>

<p>Lady Mount-Rhyswicke maintained silence for a time, while her
companion waited, his heart pounding with dreadful apprehensions.
Finally she gave a short, hard laugh and said:</p>

<p>"I saw your face by the corner light. Been havin' a hard day
of it?"</p>

<p>The fear of breaking down kept him from answering. He gulped
painfully once or twice, and turned his face away from her. Light
enough from a streetlamp shone in for her to see.</p>

<p>"I was rather afraid you'd refuse," she said seriously. "Really,
I wonder you were willin' to come!"</p>

<p>"I was &mdash;I was afraid not to." He choked out the confession
with the recklessness of final despair.</p>

<p>"So?" she said, with another short laugh. Then she resumed her
even, tired monotone: "Your little friend Cooley's note this morning
gave us all a rather fair notion as to what you must be thinkin'
of us. He seems to have found a sort of walkin' 'Who's-Who-on-the-Continent'
since last night. Pity for some people he didn't find it before!
I don't think I'm sympathetic with your little Cooley. I 'guess,'
as you Yankees say, 'he can stand it.' But"&mdash;her voice suddenly
became louder&mdash;"I'm not in the business of robbin' babies and
orphans, no, my dear friends, nor of helpin' anybody else to rob
them either! &mdash;Here you are!"</p>

<p>She thrust into his hand a small packet, securely wrapped in
paper and fastened with rubber bands. "There's your block of express
checks for six hundred dollars and your I O U to Sneyd with it.
Take better care of it next time."</p>

<p>He had been tremulous enough, but at that his whole body began
to shake violently.</p>

<p>"<em>What</em>!" he quavered.</p>

<p>"I say, take better care of it next time," she said, dropping
again into her monotone. "I didn't have such an easy time gettin'
it back from them as you might think. I've got rather a sore wrist,
in fact."</p>

<p>She paused at an inarticulate sound from him.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's soon mended," she laughed drearily. "The truth is,
it's been a good thing for me&mdash;your turning up. They're gettin'
in too deep water for me, Helene and her friends, and I've broken
with the lot, or they've broken with me, whichever it is. We couldn't
hang together after the fightin' we've done to-day. I had to do
a lot of threatenin' and things. Welch was ugly, so I had to be
ugly too. Never mind"&mdash;she checked an uncertain effort of his
to speak&mdash;"I saw what you were like, soon as we sat down at the
table last night&mdash;how new you were and all that. It needed only
a glance to see that Helene had made a mistake about you. She'd
got a notion you were a millionaire like the little Cooley, but
I knew better from your talk. She's clever, but she's French,
and she can't get it out of her head that you could be an American
and not a millionaire. Of course, they <em>all</em> knew better
when you brought out your express checks and talked like somebody
in one of the old-time story-books about 'debts of honor.' Even
Helene understood then that the express checks were all you had."
She laughed. "I didn't have any trouble gettin' the <em>note</em>
back!"</p>

<p>She paused again for a moment, then resumed: "There isn't much
use our goin' over it all, but I want you to know one thing. Your
little friend Cooley made it rather clear that he accused Helene
and me of signalin'. Well, I didn't. Perhaps that's the reason
you didn't lose as much as he did; I can't say. And one thing
more: all this isn't goin' to do you any harm. I'm not very keen
about philosophy and religion and that, but I believe if you're
let in for a lot of trouble, and it only <em>half</em> kills you,
you can get some good of it."</p>

<p>"Do you think," he stammered&mdash;"do you think I'm worth saving?"</p>

<p>She smiled faintly and said:</p>

<p>"You've probably got a sweetheart in the States somewhere&mdash;a
nice girl, a pretty young thing who goes to church and thinks
you're a great man, perhaps? Is it so?"</p>

<p>"I am not worthy," he began, choked suddenly, then finished&mdash;"to
breathe the same air!"</p>

<p>"That's quite right," Lady Mount-Rhyswicke assured him. "Think
what you'd think of her if she'd got herself into the same sort
of scrape by doin' the things you've been doin'! And remember
<em>that</em> if you ever feel impatient with her, or have any
temptations to superiority in times to come. And yet"&mdash;for the
moment she spoke earnestly&mdash;"you go back to your little girl,
but don't you tell her a word of this. You couldn't even tell
her that meetin' you has helped me, because she wouldn't understand."</p>

<p>"Nor do I. I can't."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's simple. I saw that if I was gettin' down to where I
was robbin' babies and orphans...." The cab halted. "Here's your
corner. I told him only to go round the block and come back. Good-by.
I'm off for Amalfi. It's a good place to rest."</p>

<p>He got out dazedly, and the driver cracked his whip over the
little horse; but Mellin lifted a detaining hand.</p>

<p>"<em>A spet</em>," called Lady Mount-Rhyswicke to the driver.
"What is it, Mr. Mellin?"</p>

<p>"I can't &mdash;I can't look you in the face," he stammered,
his attitude perfectly corroborative of his words. "I would&mdash;oh,
I would kneel in the dust here before you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Some of the poetry you told me you write?"</p>

<p>"I've never written any poetry," he said, not looking up. "Perhaps
I can&mdash;now. What I want to say is&mdash;I'm so ashamed of it &mdash;I
don't know how to get the words out, but I must. I may never see
you again, and I must. I 'm sorry&mdash;please try to forgive me &mdash;I
wasn't myself when I did it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blurt it out; that's the best way."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he floundered&mdash;"I'm sorry I kissed you."</p>

<p>She laughed her tired laugh and said in her tired voice the last
words he was ever destined to hear from her:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind, if you don't. It was so innocent, it was what
decided me."</p>

<p>One of the hundreds of good saints that belong to Rome must have
overheard her and pitied the young man, for it is ascribable only
to some such special act of mercy that Mellin understood (and
he did) exactly what she meant.</p>
