<p>"Great CÃ¦sar!" exclaimed the terrified McEwen, as he began swinging
back and forth, head downward, like a huge pendulum; "won't somebody
set me right side up?"</p>

<p>"Not another word," whispered Fred, catching him by the shoulders
and jerking him loose, "or I'll dash you head-first on the rocks."</p>

<p>With some difficulty, the troublesome New Englander was placed
on his feet, and finally the whole party stood erect at the bottom
of the ravine, unharmed and hopeful.</p>

<p>"If we are captured, it will be due to the presence of a natural-born
idiot with us," said Fred; "listen!"</p>

<p>It seemed at that moment as if a dozen owls were calling to each
other from different points in the woods. One or two sounds came
from the rocks overhead, near where the path terminated its ascent,
and must have been uttered by those who were seen there by Godfrey
a short time before.</p>

<p>"They have discovered us," he added, "and it is now do or die."</p>

<p>Not another word was spoken, and the youth led the way along
the ravine without any definite idea of where he was going, or
whether there was any chance of escaping what might be the very
trap into which their enemies were seeking to lure them.</p>

<p>The ground was rough and stony, and they scrambled forward like
a party of mountain tourists in a great hurry.</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey maintained his place at the head, Maggie and Eva
close behind, while Aunt Peggy, Mr. Brainerd, and Habakkuk McEwen
followed.</p>

<p>When they had gone less then a hundred yards, all were relieved
by finding they were steadily rising.</p>

<p>If this peculiarity continued, they must soon reach the level
ground above, and, in the darkness, would be able to go a good
distance before morning.</p>

<p>But it was almost idle to hope, for the thought was scarcely
in their minds when the whole party were brought to a standstill
by coming squarely against the solid wall.</p>

<p>"Is this the end of the path?" asked Brainerd, observing the
dilemma that checked them.</p>

<p>"I hope not&mdash;but let's look. Those signals going back and forth
across the valley refer to us. I believe the whole Indian force
know what we have done, and are arranging to capture us."</p>

<p>The probabilities pointed that way, and, when several minutes'
hurried search failed to find an outlet to the ravine, which now
narrowed until the two sides met, something akin to despair took
possession of the fugitives.</p>

<p>"It's my belief," ventured McEwen, "that the best thing we can
do is to open negotiations with the Senecas, with a view of obtaining
honorable terms. What are your views, Mr. Brainerd?"</p>

<p>"That the best thing for you to do is to hold your peace."</p>

<p>"Such is my own theory," added Fred, who had no patience with
the fellow. "Hello!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he made an upward leap, and catching the slight projecting
ledge of rock, to the amazement of the others, drew himself up
and secured stable footing. A few seconds were spent in a hasty
survey, when he dropped nimbly beside them again.</p>

<p>"I think there is a way out," he whispered; "but we can't climb
up there alone&mdash;that is, all of us: we have got to have help."</p>

<p>"And that cannot be obtained."</p>

<p>"Yes, it can; the grape-vine is just the thing; I can fasten
one end of that above, and then assist every one to the top."</p>

<p>"But it will be too dangerous for you to go back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait right where you are," broke in Fred; "don't move or make
any noise; I won't be gone long."</p>

<p>And before any more objection could be made he vanished in the
shadow.</p>

<p>Standing thus, with all their senses on the alert, they heard
sounds that were anything but reassuring.</p>

<p>The notes of the whip-poor-will and the dismal hooting of owls
came from different portions of the wood. Whether or not the Indians
knew precisely what the fugitives had done, they were unquestionably
aware that something unusual was going on.</p>

<p>A minute's reflection could not fail to show to all their hapless
situation. It may be said they were literally walled in, with
their enemies perched on the rocks on every hand, able to hold
them there as long as they chose.</p>

<p>However, no one was disposed to give up effort while any grounds
for making such effort was open.</p>

<p>As there was no saying how long the fugitives would be forced
to wait for the return of the lieutenant, they sat down on the
rocky seats, taking care that they kept in the dense shadow that
had served them so well.</p>

<p>Eva nestled by her father, and had placed her hand in his, and
was in the act of asking a question, when the sharp report of
a rifle was heard above their heads, and only a short distance
off.</p>

<p>The instant thought was, that Fred Godfrey had either shot some
one, or had been fired at himself.</p>

<p>But Mr. Brainerd was sure that the report came from the pile
of rocks that commanded the cavern just vacated by them. This
was a vast relief, but all shuddered to think what the results
would have been had the weapon been discharged only a few minutes
before.</p>

<p>With the bullet sent from such a point, it could not have failed
to do execution, for it will be recalled that the fugitives, while
preparing to start, were exposed to any bullet that might be sent
into the opening.</p>

<p>The supposition was, that though the red men could not see any
of the whites on account of the deep shadow to which we have referred
more than once, they knew the location of the cavern itself sufficiently
well to fire directly into it.</p>

<p>It will be seen, as a consequence, that such a shot, sent fifteen
minutes earlier, must have caused the death of one, at least,
of the company.</p>

<p>But, after all, would it have been anything more than anticipating
by a few hours their certain fate?</p>
