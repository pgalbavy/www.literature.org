Six thousand spent the winter of 1897 in Dawson, work on the
creeks went on apace, while beyond the passes it was reported
that one hundred thousand more were waiting for the spring.  Late
one brief afternoon, Daylight, on the benches between French Hill
and Skookum Hill, caught a wider vision of things.  Beneath him
lay the richest part of Eldorado Creek, while up and down Bonanza
he could see for miles.  It was a scene of a vast devastation. 
The hills, to their tops, had been shorn of trees, and their
naked sides showed signs of goring and perforating that even the
mantle of snow could not hide.  Beneath him, in every direction
were the cabins of men.  But not many men were visible.  A
blanket of smoke filled the valleys and turned the gray day to
melancholy twilight.  Smoke arose from a thousand holes in the
snow, where, deep down on bed-rock, in the frozen muck and
gravel, men crept and scratched and dug, and ever built more
fires to break the grip of the frost.  Here and there, where new
shafts were starting, these fires flamed redly.  Figures of men
crawled out of the holes, or disappeared into them, or, on raised
platforms of hand-hewn timber, windlassed the thawed gravel to
the surface, where it immediately froze.  The wreckage of the
spring washing appeared everywhere--piles of sluice-boxes,
sections of elevated flumes, huge water-wheels,--all the debris
of an army of gold-mad men.
<P>
"It-all's plain gophering," Daylight muttered aloud.
<P>
He looked at the naked hills and realized the enormous wastage of
wood that had taken place.  From this bird's-eye view he
realized the monstrous confusion of their excited workings.  It
was a gigantic inadequacy.  Each worked for himself, and the
result was chaos.  In this richest of diggings it cost out by
their feverish, unthinking methods another dollar was left
hopelessly in the earth.  Given another year, and most of the
claims would be worked out, and the sum of the gold taken out
would no more than equal what was left behind.  
<P>
Organization was what was needed, he decided; and his quick
imagination sketched Eldorado Creek, from mouth to source, and
from mountain top to mountain top, in the hands of one capable
management.  Even steam-thawing, as yet untried, but bound to
come, he saw would be a makeshift.  What should be done was to
hydraulic the valley sides and benches, and then, on the creek
bottom, to use gold-dredges such as he had heard described as
operating in California.
<P>
There was the very chance for another big killing.  He had
wondered just what was precisely the reason for the Guggenhammers
and the big English concerns sending in their high-salaried
experts.  That was their scheme.  That was why they had
approached him for the sale of worked-out claims and tailings. 
They were content to let the small mine-owners gopher out what
they could, for there would be millions in the leavings.
<P>
And, gazing down on the smoky inferno of crude effort, Daylight
outlined the new game he would play, a game in which the
Guggenhammers and the rest would have to reckon with him.  Cut
along with the delight in the new conception came a weariness. 
He was tired of the long Arctic years, and he was curious about
the Outside--the great world of which he had heard other men talk
and of which he was as ignorant as a child.  There were games out
there to play.  It was a larger table, and there was no reason
why he with his millions should not sit in and take a hand.  So
it was, that afternoon on Skookum Hill, that he resolved to play
this last best Klondike hand and pull for the Outside.
<P>
It took time, however.  He put trusted agents to work on the
heels of great experts, and on the creeks where they began to buy
he likewise bought.  Wherever they tried to corner a worked-out
creek, they found him standing in the way, owning blocks of
claims or artfully scattered claims that put all their plans to
naught.
<P>
"I play you-all wide open to win--am I right" he told them once,
in a heated conference.
<P>
Followed wars, truces, compromises, victories, and defeats.  By
1898, sixty thousand men were on the Klondike and all their
fortunes and affairs rocked back and forth and were affected by
the battles Daylight fought.  And more and more the taste for the
larger game urged in Daylight's mouth.  Here he was already
locked in grapples with the great Guggenhammers, and winning,
fiercely winning.  Possibly the severest struggle was waged on
Ophir, the veriest of moose-pastures, whose low-grade dirt was
valuable only because of its vastness.  The ownership of a block
of seven claims in the heart of it gave Daylight his grip and
they could not come to terms.  The Guggenhammer experts concluded
that it was too big for him to handle, and when they gave him an
ultimatum to that effect he accepted and bought them out.
<P>
The plan was his own, but he sent down to the States for
competent engineers to carry it out.  In the Rinkabilly
watershed, eighty miles away, he built his reservoir, and for
eighty miles the huge wooden conduit carried the water across
country to Ophir.  Estimated at three millions, the reservoir and
conduit cost nearer four.  Nor did he stop with this.  Electric
power plants were installed, and his workings were lighted as
well as run by electricity.  Other sourdoughs, who had struck it
rich in excess of all their dreams, shook their heads gloomily,
warned him that he would go broke, and declined to invest in so
extravagant a venture.
<P>
But Daylight smiled, and sold out the remainder of his town-site
holdings.  He sold at the right time, at the height of the placer
boom.  When he prophesied to his old cronies, in the Moosehorn
Saloon, that within five years town lots in Dawson could not be
given away, while the cabins would be chopped up for firewood, he
was laughed at roundly, and assured that the mother-lode would be
found ere that time.  But he went ahead, when his need for lumber
was finished, selling out his sawmills as well.  Likewise, he
began
to get rid of his scattered holdings on the various creeks, and
without thanks to any one he finished his conduit, built his
dredges, imported his machinery, and made the gold of Ophir
immediately accessible.  And he, who five years before had
crossed
over the divide from Indian River and threaded the silent
wilderness, his dogs packing Indian fashion, himself living
Indian
fashion on straight moose meat, now heard the hoarse whistles
calling his hundreds of laborers to work, and watched them toil
under the white glare of the arc-lamps.
<P>
But having done the thing, he was ready to depart.  And when he
let the word go out, the Guggenhammers vied with the English
concerns and with a new French company in bidding for Ophir and
all its plant.  The Guggenhammers bid highest, and the price they
paid netted Daylight a clean million.  It was current rumor that
he was worth anywhere from twenty to thirty millions.  But he
alone knew just how he stood, and that, with his last claim sold
and the table swept clean of his winnings, he had ridden his
hunch to the tune of just a trifle over eleven millions.
<P>
His departure was a thing that passed into the history of the
Yukon along with his other deeds.  All the Yukon was his guest,
Dawson the seat of the festivity.  On that one last night no
man's dust save his own was good.  Drinks were not to be
purchased.  Every saloon ran open, with extra relays of exhausted
bartenders, and the drinks were given away.  A man who refused
this hospitality, and persisted in paying, found a dozen fights
on his hands.  The veriest chechaquos rose up to defend the name
of Daylight from such insult.  And through it all, on moccasined
feet, moved Daylight, hell-roaring Burning Daylight,
over-spilling with good nature and camaraderie, howling his
he-wolf howl and claiming the night as his, bending men's arms
down on the bars, performing feats of strength, his bronzed face
flushed with drink, his black eyes flashing, clad in overalls and
blanket coat, his ear-flaps dangling and his gauntleted mittens
swinging from the cord across the shoulders.  But this time it
was neither an ante nor a stake that he threw away, but a mere
marker in the game that he who held so many markers would not
miss.
<P>
As a night, it eclipsed anything that Dawson had ever seen.  It
was Daylight's desire to make it memorable, and his attempt was a
success.  A goodly portion of Dawson got drunk that night.  The
fall weather was on, and, though the freeze-up of the Yukon still
delayed, the thermometer was down to twenty-five below zero and
falling.  Wherefore, it was necessary to organize gangs of
life-savers, who patrolled the streets to pick up drunken men
from where they fell in the snow and where an hour's sleep would
be fatal.  Daylight, whose whim it was to make them drunk by
hundreds and by thousands, was the one who initiated this life
saving.  He wanted Dawson to have its night, but, in his deeper
processes never careless nor wanton, he saw to it that it was a
night without accident.  And, like his olden nights, his ukase
went forth that there should be no quarrelling nor fighting,
offenders to be dealt with by him personally.  Nor did he have to
deal with any.  Hundreds of devoted followers saw to it that the
evilly disposed were rolled in the snow and hustled off to bed. 
In the great world, where great captains of industry die, all
wheels under their erstwhile management are stopped for a minute.
<P>
But in the Klondike, such was its hilarious sorrow at the
departure of its captain, that for twenty-four hours no wheels
revolved.  Even great Ophir, with its thousand men on the
pay-roll, closed down.  On the day after the night there were no
men present or fit to go to work.
<P>
Next morning, at break of day, Dawson said good-by.  The
thousands that lined the bank wore mittens and their ear-flaps
pulled down and tied.  It was thirty below zero, the rim-ice was
thickening, and the Yukon carried a run of mush-ice.  From the
deck of the Seattle, Daylight waved and called his farewells.  As
the lines were cast off and the steamer swung out into the
current, those near him saw the moisture well up in Daylight's
eyes.  In a way, it was to him departure from his native land,
this grim Arctic region which was practically the only land he
had known.  He tore off his cap and waved it.
<P>
"Good-by, you-all!" he called.  "Good-by, you-all!"
