There are not many people -- and as it is desirable that a
story-teller and a story-reader should establish a mutual
understanding as soon as possible, beg it to be noticed that I confine
this observation neither to young people nor to little people, but
extend it to all conditions of people: little and big, young and old: 
yet growing up,  or already growing down again -- there 
are not, I say, many people who would care to sleep in a church. I
don't mean at sermon-time in warm weather (when the thing has actually
been done, once or twice), but in the night, and alone. A great
multitude of persons will be violently astonished, I know, by this
position, in the broad bold Day. But it applies to Night. It must be
argued by night. And I will undertake to maintain it successfully on
any gusty winter's night appointed for the purpose, with any one
opponent chosen from the rest, who will meet me singly in an old
church-yard, before an old church-door; and will previously empower me
to lock him in, if needful to his satisfaction, until morning. 

<p>For the night-wind has a dismal trick of wandering round and round
a building of that sort, and moaning as it goes; and of trying, with
its unseen hand, the windows and the doors; and seeking out some
crevices by which to enter. And when it has got in; as one not finding
what it seeks, whatever that may be, it wails and howls to issue forth
again: and not content with stalking through the aisles, and gliding 
 round and round the pillars, and tempting the deep organ,
soars up to the roof, and strives to rend the rafters: then flings
itself despairingly upon the stones below, and passes, muttering, into
the vaults. Anon, it comes up stealthily, and creeps along the walls,
seeming to read, in whispers, the Inscriptions sacred to the Dead. At
some of these, it breaks out shrilly, as with laughter; and at others,
moans and cries as if it were lamenting. It has a ghostly sound too,
lingering within the altar; where it seems to chaunt, in its wild way,
of Wrong and Murder done, and false Gods worshipped; in defiance of
the Tables of the Law, which look so fair and smooth, but are so 
flawed and broken. Ugh! Heaven preserve us, sitting snugly round the
fire! It has an awful voice, that wind at Midnight, singing in a
churchl 

<p>But high up in the steeple! There the foul blast roars and
whistles! High up in the steeple, where it is free to come and go
through many an airy arch and loophole, and to twist and twine itself
about the giddy stair, and twirl the groaning weathercock, and make
the very tower shake and shiver! High up in  the steeple,
where the belfry is, and iron rails are ragged with rust; and sheets
of lead and copper shrivelled by the changing weather, crackle and
heave beneath the unaccustomed tread; and birds stuff shabby nests
into corners of old oaken joists and beams; and dust grows old and
grey; and speckled spiders, indolent and fat with long security, swing
 idly to and fro in the vibration of the bells, and never loose their
hold upon their thread-spun castles in the air, or climb up
sailor-like in quick alarm, or drop upon the ground and ply a score of
nimble legs to save a life! High up in the steeple of an old church,
far above the light and murmur of the town and far below the flying
clouds that shadow it, is the wild and dreary place at night: and high
up in the steeple of an old church, dwelt the Chimes I tell of. 

<p>They were old Chimes, trust me. Centuries ago, these Bells had been
baptized by bishops: so many centuries ago, that the register of their
baptism was lost long, long before the memory of man, and no one knew
their names. They had had their Godfathers  and Godmothers,
these Bells (for my own part, by the way, I would rather incur the
responsibility of being Godfather to a Bell than a Boy), and had had
their silver mugs no doubt, besides. But Time had mowed down their
sponsors, and Henry the Eighth had melted down their mugs; and they
now hung, nameless and mugless, in the church tower. 

<p>Not speechless, though. Far from it. They had clear, loud, lusty,
sounding voices, had these Bells; and far and wide they might be heard
upon the wind. Much too sturdy Chimes were they, to be dependent on
the pleasure of the wind, moreover; for, fighting gallantly against it
when it took an adverse whim, they would pour their cheerful notes
into a listening ear right royally; and bent on being heard, on stormy
 nights, by some poor mother watching a sick child, or some lone wife
whose husband was at sea, they had been sometimes known to beat a
blustering Nor'-Wester, aye, ``all to fits,'' as Toby Veck said;
-- for though they chose to call him Trotty Veck, his name was
Toby, and nobody could make it anything else either (except Tobias)
without a special act of parliament; he having been  as
lawfully christened in his day as the Bells had been in theirs, though
with not quite so much of solemnity or public rejoicing. 

<p>For my part, I confess myself of Toby Veck's belief, for I am sure
he had opportunities enough of forming a correct one. And whatever
Tobyv Veck said, I say. And I take my stand by Toby Veck, although he
<STRONG>did</STRONG> stand all day long (and weary work it was) just
outside the church-door. In fact he was a ticket-porter, Toby Veck,
and waited there for jobs. 

<p>And a breezy, goose-skinned, blue-nosed red-eyed, stony-toed,
tooth-chattering place it was, to wait in, in the winter-time, as Toby
Veck well knew. The wind came tearing round the corner --
especially the east wind -- as if it had sallied forth, express,
from the confines of the earth, to have a blow at Toby. And
oftentimes it seemed to come upon him sooner than it had expected, for
bouncing round the corner, and passing Toby, it would suddenly wheel
round again, as if it cried ``Why, here he is!'' Incontinently 
his little white apron would be caught up over his head like a naughty
boy's garments, and his feeble little cane would be seen  to
wrestle and struggle unavailingly in his hand, and his legs would
undergo tremendous agitation, and Toby himself all aslant, and facing
now in this direction, now in that, would be so banged and buffeted,
and touzled, and worried, and hustled, and lifted off his feet, as to
render it a state of things but one degree removed from a positive 
miracle, that he wasn't carried up bodily into the air as a colony of
frogs or snails or other portable creatures sometimes are, and rained
down again, to the great astonishment of the natives, on some strange
corner of the world where ticket-porters are unknown. <p>But, windy
weather, in spite of its using him so roughly, was, after all, a sort
of holiday for Toby. That's the fact. He didn't seem to wait so long
for sixpence in the wind, as at other times; for the having to fight
with that boisterous element took off his attention, and quite
freshened him up when he was getting hungry and low-spirited. A hard
frost too, or a fall of snow, was an Event; and it seemed to do him
good, somehow or other -- it would have been hard to say in what
respect though, Toby! So wind  and frost and snow, and perhaps
a good stiff storm of hail, were Toby Veck's red-letter days. 

<p>Wet weather was the worst; the cold damp, clammy wet, that wrapped
him up like a moist great-coat -- the only kind of great-coat
Toby owned, or could have added to his comfort by dispensing with. Wet
 days, when the rain came slowly, thickly, obstinately down; when the
streets's throat, like his own, was choked with mist; when smoking
umbrellas passed and re-passed, spinning round and round like so many 
teetotums, as they knocked against each other on the crowded footway,
throwing off a little whirlpool of uncomfortable sprinklings; when
gutters brawled and waterspouts were full and noisy; when the wet from
 the projecting stones and ledges of the church fell drip, drip, drip,
on Toby, making the wisp of straw on which he stood mere mud in no
time; those were the days that tried him. Then indeed, you might see 
Toby looking anxiously out from his shelter in an angle of the church
wall -- such a meagre shelter that in summer time it never cast a
shadow thicker than a good-sized walking-stick upon the sunny pavement
 -- with a disconsolate and lengthened face. But <illus>
coming out, a minute afterwards, to warm himself by 
exercise: and trotting up and down some dozen times: he would 
brighten even then, and go back more brightly to his niche. 

<p>They called him Trotty from his pace, which meant speed if it
didn't make it. He could have Walked faster perhaps; most likely; but
rob him of his trot, and Toby would have taken to his bed and died.
It bespattered him with mud in dirty weather; it cost him a world of
trouble; he could have walked with infinitely greater ease; but that
was one reason for his clinging to it so tenaciously. A weak, small, 
spare old man, he was a very Hercules, this Toby, in his good
intentions. He loved to earn his money. He delighted to believe
-- Toby was very poor, and couldn't well afford to part with a
delight -- that he was worth his salt. With a shilling or an
eighteenpenny message or small parcel in hand, his courage, always
high, rose higher. As he trotted on, he would call out to fast Postmen
ahead of him, to get out of the way; devoutly believing that in the
natural course of things he must inevitably overtake and run them
down; and he had perfect faith -- not often tested -- <pb
n=11> in his being able to carry anything that man could lift. 

<p>Thus, even when he came out of his nook to warm himself on a wet
day, Toby trotted. Making, with his leaky shoes, a crooked line of
slushy footprints in the mire; and blowing on his chilly hands and
rubbing them against each other, poorly defended from the searching
cold by threadbare mufflers of grey worsted, with a private apartment
only for the thumb, and a common room or tap for the rest of the
fingers; Toby, with his knees bent and his cane beneath his arm, still
trotted. Falling out into the road to look up at the belfry when the
Chimes resounded, Toby trotted still. 

<p>He made this last excursion several times a day, for they were
company to him; and when he heard their voices, he had an interest in
glancing at their lodging-place, and thinking how they were moved, and
 what hammers beat upon them. Perhaps he was the more curious about
these Bells, because there were points of resemblance between
themselves and him. They hung there, in all weathers, with the wind and
 rain driving in upon them; facing only the outsides of all those
houses; never getting any nearer to the blazing  fires that
gleamed and shone upon the windows, or came puffing out of the chimney
tops; and incapable of participation in any of the good things that
were constantly being handed, through the street doors and the area
railings, to prodigious cooks. Faces came and went at many windows:
sometimes pretty faces, youthful faces, pleasant faces: sometimes the
reverse: but Toby knew no more (though he often speculated on these
trifles, standing idle in the streets) whence they came, or where they
went, or whether, when the lips moved, one kind word was said of him
in all the year, than did the Chimes themselves. 

<p>Toby was not a casuist -- that he knew of, at least -- 
and I don't mean to say that when he began to take to the Bells, and
to knit up his first rough acquaintance with them into something of a
closer and more delicate woof, he passed through these considerations 
one by one, or held any formal review or great field-day in his
thoughts. But what I mean to say, and do say is, that as the functions
of Toby's body, his digestive organs for example, did of their own
cunning, and by a great many operations of which he was altogether
ignorant, and the knowledge of which  would have astonished
him very much, arrive at a certain end; so his mental faculties,
without his privity or concurrence, set all these wheels and springs
in motion, with a thousand others, when they worked to bring about
his liking for the Bells. 

<p>And though I had said his love, I would not have recalled the word,
though it would scarcely have expressed his complicated feeling. For,
being but a simple man, he invested them with a strange and solemn
character. They were so mysterious, often heard and never seen; so
high up, so far off, so full of such a deep strong melody, that he
regarded them with a species of awe; and sometimes when he looked up
at the dark arched windows in the tower, he half expected to be
beckoned to by something which was not a Bell, and yet was what he had
heard so often sounding in the Chimes. For all this. Toby scouted 
with indignation a certain flying rumour that the Chimes were haunted,
as implying the possibility of their being connected with any Evil
thing. In short, they were very often in his ears, and very often in
his thoughts, but always in his good opinion; and he very often <pb
n=14> got such a crick in his neck by staring with his mouth wide
open, at the steeple where they hung, that he was fain to take an
extra trot or two, afterwards, to cure it. 

<p>The very thing he was in the act of doing one cold day, when the
last drowsy sound of Twelve o'clock, just struck, was humming like a
melodious monster of a Bee, and not by any means a busy bee, all 
through the steeple. 

<p>``Dinner-time, eh!'' said Toby, trotting up and down before
the church. ``Ah!'' 

<p>Toby's nose was very red, and his eyelids were very red, and he
winked very much, and his shoulders were very near his ears, and his
legs were very stiff, and altogether he was evidently a long way upon
the frosty side of cool. 

<p>``Dinner-time, eh!'' repeated Toby, using his right-hand 
muffler like an infantine boxing-glove, and punishing his chest for
being cold. ``Ah-h-h-h!'' 

<p>He took a silent trot, after that, for a minute or two. 

<p>``There's nothing,'' said Toby, breaking forth afresh --
but here he stopped short in his trot, and  with a face of
great interest and some alarm, felt his nose carefully all the way up.
It was but a little way (not being much of a nose) and he had soon
finished. 

<p>``I thought it was gone,'' said Toby, trotting off again.
``It's all right, however. I am sure I couldn't blame it if it was
to go. It has precious hard service of it in the bitter weather, and
precious little to look forward to; for I don't take snuff myself. 
It's a good deal tried, poor creetur, at the best of times; for when
it <STRONG>does</STRONG> get hold of a pleasant whiff or so (which an't
too often), it's generally from somebody else's dinner, a-coming home
from the baker's.'' 

<p>The reflection reminded him of that other reflection, which he had
left unfinished 

<p>``There's nothing,'' said Toby, ``more regular in its 
coming round than dinner-time, and nothing less regular in its coming
round than dinner. That's the great difference between 'em. It's took
me a long time to find it out. I wonder whether it would be worth any
gentleman's while now, to buy that obserwation for the Papers; or the
Parliament!''  <p>Toby was only joking, for he gravely
shook his head in self-depreciation. 

<p>``Why! Lord!'' said Toby. ``The Papers is full of 
obserwations as it is; and so's the Parliament. Here's last week's
paper, now``; taking a very dirty one from his pocket, and holding
it from him at arm's length; ``full of obserwations! Full of
obserwations! I like to know the news as well as any man,'' said 
Toby, slowly; folding it a little smaller, and putting it in his
pocket again; ``but it almost goes against the grain with me to
read a paper now. It frightens me almost. I don't know what we poor
people are coming to. Lord send we may be coming to something better
in the New Year nigh upon us!'' 

<p>``Why, father, father!'' said a pleasant voice, hard by. 

<p>But Toby, not hearing it, continued to trot backwards and forwards;
musing as he went, and talking to himself. 

<p>``It seems as if we can't go right, or do right, or be 
righted,'' said Toby. ``I hadn't much schooling, myself, when I
was young; and I can't make out  whether we have any business
on the face of the earth, or not. Sometimes I think we must have a
little; and sometimes I think we must be intruding. I get so puzzled 
sometimes that I am not even able to make up my mind whether there is
any good at all in us, or whether we are born bad. We seem to be
dreadful things; we seem to give a deal of trouble; we are always
being complained of and guarded against. One way or other, we fill
the papers. Talk of a New Year!'' said Toby, mournfully. ``I can
bear up as well as another man at most times; better than a good many,
 for I am as strong as a lion, and all men an't; but supposing it
should really be that we have no right to a New Year -- supposing
we really <STRONG>are</STRONG> intruding --'' 

<p>``Why, father, father!'' said the pleasant voice again. 

<p>Toby heard it this time; started; stopped; and shortening his
sight, which had been directed a long way off as seeking for
enlightenment in the very heart of the approaching year, found himself
face to face with his own child, and looking close into her eyes. 
 <p>Bright eyes they were. Eyes that would bear a world of
looking in, before their depth was fathomed. Dark eyes, that reflected
back the eyes which searched them; not flashingly, or at the owner's
will, but with a clear, calm, honest, patient radiance, claiming
kindred with that light which Heaven called into being. Eyes that were
beautiful and true, and beaming with Hope. With Hope so young and
fresh; with Hope so buoyant, vigorous, and bright, despite the twenty 
years of work and poverty on which they had looked that they became a
voice to Trotty Veck, and said. ``I think we have some business
here -- a little!'' 

<p>Trotty kissed the lips belonging to the eyes, and squeezed the
blooming face between his hands. 

<p>``Why, Pet,'' said Trotty. ``What's to-do? I didn't expect
you to-day, Meg.'' 

<p>``Neither did I expect to come, father,'' cried the girl,
nodding her head and smiling as she spoke. ``But here I am! And not
alone; not alone!'' 

<p>``Why you don't mean to say,'' observed Trotty, looking
curiously at a covered basket which she carried in her hand, ``that
you --''  <p>``Smell it, father dear,'' said
Meg. ``Only smell it!'' 

<p>Trotty was going to lift up the cover at once, in a great hurry,
when she gaily interposed her hand. 

<p>``No, no, no,'' said Meg, with the glee of a child. 
``Lengthen it out a little. Let me just lift up the corner; just
the lit-tle ti-ny cor-ner, vou know,'' said Meg, suiting the action
to the word with the utmost gentleness, and speaking very softly, as
if she were afraid of being overheard by something inside the basket;
``there. Now. What's that?'' 

<p>Toby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge of the basket,
and cried out in a rapture: 

<p>``Why, it's hot!'' 

<p>``It's burning hot!'' cried Meg. ``Ha, ha, ha! It's 
scalding hot!'' 

<p>``Ha, ha, ha!'' roared Toby, with a sort of kick. ``It's
scalding hot.'' 

<p>``But what is it, father?'' said Meg. ``Come. You haven't
guessed what it is. And you must guess what it is. I can't think of
taking it out, till you guess what it is. Don't be in such a hurry!
Wait a minute! A little bit more of the cover. Now guess!'' <pb
n=20> <p>Meg was in a perfect fright lest he should guess right too
soon; shrinking away, as she held the basket towards him; curling up
her pretty shoulders; stopping her ear with her hand, as if by so
doing she could keep the right word out of Toby's lips; and laughing
softly the whole time. 

<p>Meanwhile Toby, putting a hand on each knee, bent down his nose to
the basket, and took a long inspiration at the lid; the grin upon his
withered face expanding in the process, as if he were inhaling 
laughing gas. 

<p>``Ah! It's very nice,'' said Toby. ``It an't -- I 
suppose it an't Polonies?'' 

<p>``No, no, no!'' cried Meg, delighted. ``Nothing like 
Polonies!'' 

<p>``No,'' said Toby, after another sniff. ``It's -- it's
 mellower than Polonies. It's very nice. It improves every moment.
It's too decided for Trotters. An't, it?'' 

<p>Meg was in an ecstasy. He could <STRONG>not</STRONG> have gone wider of
the mark than Trotters -- except Polonies. 

<p>``Liver?'' said Toby, communing with himself. ``No. 
There's a mildness about it that don't answer  to liver. 
Pettitoes? No. It an't faint enough for pettitoes.'' 

<p>``It wants the stringiness of Cock's heads. And I know it an't
sausages. I'll tell you what it is. It's chitterlings!'' 

<p>``No, it an't!'' cried Meg, in a burst of delight. ``No, 
it an't!'' 

<p>``Why, what am I a-thinking of!'' said Toby, suddenly 
recovering a position as near the perpendicular as it was possible for
him to assume. ``I shall forget my own name next. It's tripe!'' 

<p>Tripe it was; and Meg, in high joy, protested he should say, in
half a minute more, it was the best tripe ever stewed. 

<p>``And so,'' said Meg, busying herself exultingly with the
basket, ``I'll lay the cloth at once, father, for I have brought
the tripe in a basin, and tied the basin up in a pocket-handkerchief;
and if I like to be proud for once, and spread that for a cloth, and
call it a cloth, there's no law to prevent me; is there, father?'' 

<p>``Not that I know of, my dear,'' said Toby. ``But they're
always a bringing up some new law or other.''  <p>``And
according to what I was reading you in the paper the other day,
father; what the Judge said, you know; we poor people are supposed to
know them all Ha, ha! What a mistake! My goodness me, how clever they
think us!'' 

<p>``Yes, my dear,'' cried Trotty; ``and they'd be very fond
of any one of us that <STRONG>did</STRONG> know 'em all. He'd grow fat
upon the work he'd get, that man, and be popular with the gentle-folks
in his neighbourhood. Very much so!'' 

<p>``He'd eat his dinner with an appetite, whoever he was, if it
smelt like this,'' said Meg, cheerfully ``Make haste, for
there's a hot potato besides. and half a pint of fresh-drawn beer in a
bottle. Where will you dine, father? On the Post, or on the Steps? 
Dear, dear, how grand we are. Two places to choose from!'' 

<p>``The steps to-day, my Pct,'' said Trotty. ``Steps in dry
weather. Post in wet. There's a greater conveniency in the steps at
all times, because of the sitting down; but they're rheumatic in the
damp. 

<p>``Then here,'' said Meg, clapping her hands, after  a
 moment's bustle; ``here it is, all ready! And beautiful it looks!
Come, father. Come!'' 

<p>Since his discovery of the contents of the basket, Trotty had been
standing looking at her -- and had been speaking too -- in
an abstracted manner, which showed that though she was the object of
his thoughts and eyes, to the exclusion even of tripe, he neither saw 
nor thought about her as she was at that moment, but had before him
some imaginary rough sketch or drama of her future life. Roused, now,
by her cheerful summons, he shook off a melancholy shake of the head
which was just coming upon him, and trotted to her side. As she was
stooping to sit down, the Chimes rang. 

<p>``Amen!'' said Trotty, pulling off his hat and looking up
towards them. 

<p>``Amen to the Bells, father?'' cried Meg. 

<p>``They broke in like a grace, my dear,'' said Trotty, taking
his seat. ``They'd say a good one, I am sure, if they could. Many's
the kind thing they say to me.'' 

<p>``The Bells do, father!'' laughed Meg, as she set the basin,
and a knife and fork before him. ``Well!'' 
<p>``Seem to, my Pet,'' said Trotty, falling to with great
vigour. ``And where's the difference? If I hear 'em, what does it
matter whether they speak it or not? Why bless you, my dear,'' said
Toby, pointing at the tower with his fork, and becoming more animated
under the influence of dinner, ``how often have I heard them bells
say &onq;Toby Veck, Toby Veck, keep a good heart, Toby! Toby Veck,
Toby Veck, keep a good heart, Toby!&cnq; A million times? More!'' 

<p>``Well, I never!'' cried Meg. 

<p>She had, though -- over and over again. For it was Toby's
constant topic. 

<p>``When things is very bad,'' said Trotty; ``very bad 
indeed, I mean; almost at the worst; then it's &onq;Toby Veck, Toby
Veck, job coming soon, Toby! Toby Veck, Toby Veck, job coming soon,
Toby!&cnq; That way.'' 

<p>``And it comes -- at last, father,'' said Meg, with a 
touch of sadness in her pleasant voice. 

<p>``Always,'' answered the unconscious Toby. ``Never 
fails.'' 

<p>While this discourse was holding, Trotty made no  pause
in his attack upon the savoury meat before him, but cut and ate, and
cut and drank, and cut and chewed, and dodged about, from tripe to hot
potato, and from hot potato back again to tripe, with an unctuous and
unflagging relish. But happening now to look all round the street
-- in case anybody should be beckoning from any door or window,
for a porter -- his eyes, in coming back again, encountered Meg;
sitting opposite to him, with her arms folded: and only busy in
watching his progress with a smile of bappiness. 

<p>``Why, Lord forgive me!'' said Trotty, dropping his knife and
fork. ``My dove! Meg! Why didn't you tell me what a beast I
was?'' 

<p>``Father?'' 

<p>``Sitting here,'' said Trotty, in penitent explanation, 
``cramming, and stuffing, and gorging myself; and you before me
there, never so much as breaking your precious fast, not wanting to,
when --'' 

<p>``But I have broken it, father,'' interposed his daughter,
laughing, ``all to bits. I have had my dinner.'' 
<p>``Nonsense,'' said Trotty. ``Two dinners in one day! It
an't possible! You might as well tell me that two New Year's days will
come together, or that I have had a gold head all my life, and never
changed it.'' 

<p>``I have had my dinner, father, for all that,'' said Meg,
coming nearer to him. ``And if you'll go on with yours, I'll tell
you how and where; and how your dinner came to be bought; and --
and something else besides.'' 

<p>Toby still appeared incredulous; but she looked into his face with
her clear eyes, and laying her hand upon his shoulder, motioned him to
go on while the meat was hot. So Trotty took up his knife and fork 
again, and went to work. But much more slowly than before, and shaking
his head, as if he were not at all pleased with himself. 

<p>``I had my dinner, father,'' said Meg, after a little 
hesitation, ``with -- with Richard. His dinner-time was early;
and as he brought his dinner with him when he came to see me, we
-- we had it together, father.'' 

<p>Trotty took a little beer, and smacked his lips. Then he said
``Oh!'' -- because she waited. 

<p>``And Richard says, father --'' Meg resumed. Then
stopped. 

<p>``What does Richard say, Meg?'' asked Toby. 

<p>``Richard says, father --'' another stoppage. 

<p>``Richard's a long time saying it,'' said Toby. 

<p>``He says then, father,'' Meg continued, lifting up her eyes
at last, and speaking in a tremble, but quite plainly; ``another
year is nearly gone, and where is the use of waiting on from year to
year, when it is so unlikely we shall ever be better off than we are 
now? He says we are poor now, father, and we shall be poor then, but
we are young now, and years will make us old before we know it. He
says that if we wait: people in our condition: until we see our way 
quite clearly, the way will be a narrow one indeed -- the common
way. the Grave, father.'' 

<p>A bolder man than Trotty Veck must needs have drawn upon his
boldness largely, to deny it. Trotty held his peace. 

<p>``And how hard, father, to grow old, and die, and 
think we might have cheered and helped each other! How hard in all our
lives to love each other; and to grieve, apart, to see each other
working, changing, growing old and grey. Even if I got the better of 
it, and forgot him (which I never could), oh father dear, how hard to
have a heart so full as mine is now and live to have it slowly drained
out every drop without the recollection of one happy moment of a 
woman's life, to stay behind and comfort me, and make me better!'' 

<p>Trotty sat quite still. Meg dried her eyes, and said more gaily:
that is to say, with here a laugh, and there a sob, and here a laugh
and sob together: 

<p>``So Richard says, father; as his work was yesterday made
certain for some time to come, and as I love him, and have loved him
full three years -- ah! longer than that, if he knew it! --
will I marry him on New Year's Day; the best and happiest day, he
says, in the whole year, and one that is almost sure to bring good
fortune with it. It's a short notice, father -- isn't it? --
but I haven't my fortune to be settled or my wedding dresses to be
made, like the great ladies, father, have I? And he said so
much, and said it in his way; so strong and earnest, and all the time
so kind and gentle; that I said I'd come and talk to you, father. And
as they paid the money for that work of mine this morning
(unexpectedly, I am sure!) and as you have fared very poorly for a
whole week, and as I couldn't help wishing there should be something
to make this day a sort of holiday to you as well as a dear and happy
day to me, father, I made a little treat and brought it to surprise
you.'' 

<p>``And see how he leaves it cooling on the step!'' said
another voice. 

<p>It was the voice of this same Richard. who had come upon them
unobserved, and stood before the father and daughter; looking down
upon them with a face as glowing as the iron on which his stout 
sledge-hammer daily rung. A handsome, well-made powerful youngster he
was; with eyes that sparkled like the red-hot droppings from a furnace
fire; black hair that curled about his swarthy temples rarely; and a
smile -- a smile that bore out Meg's eulogium on his style of
conversation.  <p>``See how he leaves it cooling on the
step!'' said Richard. ``Meg don't know what he likes. Not
she!'' 

<p>Trotty, all action and enthusiasm, immediately reached up his hand
to Richard, and was going to address him in a great hurry, when the
house-door opened without any warning, and a footman very nearly put
his foot into the tripe. 

<p>``Out of the vays here, will you! You must always go and be
a-settin' on our steps, must you! You can't go and give a turn to none
of the neighbours never can't you! <STRONG>Will</STRONG> you clear the
road, or won't you?'' 

<p>Strictly speaking, the last question was irrelevant, as they had
already done it. 

<p>``What's the matter, what's the matter!'' said the gentleman
for whom the door was opened; coming out of the house at that kind of
light-heavy pace -- that peculiar compromise between a walk and a
 jog-trot -- with which a gentleman upon the smooth down-hill of
life, wearing creaking boots, a watch-chain, and clean linen,
<STRONG>may</STRONG> come out of his house: not only without any abatement
of his dignity, but with  an expression of having important
and wealthy engagements elsewhere. ``What's the matter. What's the
matter!'' 

<p>``You're always a-being begged, and prayed, upon your bended
knees you are,'' said the footman with great emphasis to Trotty
Veck, ``to let our door-steps be. Why don't you let 'em be? <emph
rend=sc>CAN'T</STRONG> you let 'em be?'' 

<p>``There! That'll do, that'll do!'' said the gentleman. 
``Halloa there! Porter!'' beckoning with his head to Trotty
Veck. ``Come here. What's that? Your dinner?'' 

<p>``Yes, sir,'' said Trotty, leaving it behind him in a corner.


<p>``Don't leave it there,'' exclaimed the gentleman. ``Bring
it here, bring it here. So! This is your dinner, is it?'' 

<p>``Yes, sir,'' repeated Trotty, looking with a fixed eye and a
watery mouth, at the piece of tripe he had reserved for a last
delicious tit-bit; which the gentleman was now turning over and over
on the end of the fork. 

<p>Two other gentlemen had come out with him. One  was a
low-spirited gentleman of middle age, of a meagre habit, and a
disconsolate face who kept his hands continually in the pockets of his
scanty pepper-and-salt trousers; very large and dog's-eared from that
custom; and was not particularly well brushed or washed. The other, a
full-sized, sleek, well-conditioned gentleman, in a blue coat with
bright buttons, and a white cravat. This gentleman had a very red
face, as if an undue proportion of the blood in his body were squeezed
up into his head; which perhaps accounted for his having also the
appearance of being rather cold about the heart. 

<p>He who had Toby's meat upon the fork, called to the first one by
the name of Filer; and they both drew near together. Mr. Filer being
exceedingly short-sighted, was obliged to go so close to the remnant 
of Toby's dinner before he could make out what it was, that Toby's
heart leaped up into his mouth. But Mr. Filer didn't eat it. 

<p>``This is a description of animal food, Alderman,'' said
Filer, making little punches in it, with a pencil-case, ``commonly
known to the labouring population of this country, by the name of
tripe.''  <p>The Alderman laughed, and winked; for he was 
a merry fellow, Alderman Cute. Oh, and a sly fellow too! A knowing
fellow. Up to everything. Not to be imposed upon. Deep in the people's
 hearts! He knew them, Cute did. I believe you! 

<p>``But who eats tripe?'' said Mr. Filer, looking round. 
``Tripe is without an exception the least economical, and the most
wasteful article of consumption that the markets of this country can
by possibility produce. The loss upon a pound of tripe has been found 
to be, in the boiling, seven-eights of a fifth more than the loss upon
a pound of any other animal substance whatever. Tripe is more
expensive, properly understood, than the hothouse pineapple. Taking 
into account the number of animals slaughtered yearly within the bills
of mortality alone; and forming a low estimate of the quantity of
tripe which the carcasses of those animals, reasonably well butchered,
 would yield; I find that the waste on that amount of tripe, if
boiled, would victual a garrison of five hundred men for five months
of thirty-one days each, and a February over. The Waste, the
Waste!''  <illus> <p>Trotty stood aghast, and his legs
shook under him. He seemed to have starved a garrison of five hundred 
men with his own hand.  <p>``Who eats tripe?'' said Mr.
Filer, warmly. ``Who eats tripe?'' 

<p>Trotty made a miserable bow. 

<p>``You do, do you?'' said Mr. Filer. ``Then I'll tell you
something. You snatch your tripe, my friend, out of the mouths of
widows and orphans.'' 

<p>``I hope not, Sir,'' said Trotty, faintly. ``I'd sooner 
die of want!'' 

<p>``Divide the amount of tripe before mentioned, Alderman,''
said Mr. Filer, ``by the estimated number of existing widows and
orphans, and the result will be one pennyweight of tripe to each. Not
a grain is left for that man. Consequently, he's a robber.'' 

<p>Trotty was so shocked, that it gave him no concern to see the
Alderman finish the tripe himself. It was a relief to get rid of it,
anyhow. 

<p>``And what do you say?'' asked the Alderman jocosely, of the
red-faced gentleman in the blue coat. ``You have heard friend
Filer. What do <STRONG>you</STRONG> say?'' 

<p>``What's it possible to say?'' returned the gentleman. 
``What <STRONG>is</STRONG> to be said? Who can take any 
interest in a fellow like this,'' meaning Trotty; ``in such 
degenerate times as these? Look at him! What an object! The good old
times, the grand old times, the great old times! <STRONG>Those</STRONG>
were the times for a bold peasantry, and all that sort of thing. Those
 were the times for every sort of thing, in fact. There's nothing
now-a-days. Ah!'' sighed the red-faced gentleman. ``The good old
times, the good old times!'' 

<p>The gentleman didn't specify what particular times he alluded to;
nor did he say whether he objected to the present times; from a
distinterested consciousness that they had done nothing very
remarkable in producing himself. 

<p>``The good old times, the good old times,'' repeated the
gentleman. ``What times they were! They were the only times. It's
no use talking about any other times, or discussing what the people
are in these times. You don't call these, times, do you? I don't. Look 
into Strutt's Costumes, and see what a Porter used to be, in any of
the good old English reigns.''  <p>``He hadn't, in his
very best circumstances, a shirt to his back, or a stocking to his
foot; and there was scarcely a vegetable in all England for him to put
 into his mouth,'' said Mr. Filer. ``I can prove it, by
tables.'' 

<p>But still the red-faced gentleman extolled the good old times, the
grand old times, the great old times. No matter what anybody else
said, he still went turning round and round in one set form of words 
concerning them; as a poor squirrel turns and turns in its revolving
cage; touching the mechanism, and trick of which, it has probably
quite as distinct perceptions, as ever this red-faced gentleman had of
his deceased Millennium. 

<p>It is possible that poor Trotty's faith in these very vague Old
Times was not entirely destroyed, for he felt vague enough, at that
moment. One thing, however, was plain to him, in the midst of his
distress; to wit, that however these gentlemen might differ in 
details, his misgivings of that morning, and of many other mornings,
were well founded. ``No, no. We can't go right or do right,''
thought Trotty  in despair. ``There is no good in us. We
are born bad!'' 

<p>But Trotty had a father's heart within him; which had somehow got
into his breast in spite of this decree; and he could not bear that
Meg, in the blush of her brief joy, should have her fortune read by
these wise gentlemen. ``God help her,'' thought poor Trotty. 
``She will know it soon enough.'' 

<p>He anxiously signed, therefore, to the young smith, to take her
away. But he was so busy, talking to her softly at a little distance,
that he only became conscious of this desire, simultaneously with
Alderman Cute. Now, the Alderman had not yet had his say, but
<STRONG>he</STRONG> was a philosopher, too -- practical, though! Oh,
very practical -- and, as he had no idea of losing any portion of
his audience, he cried ``Stop!'' 

<p>``Now, you know,'' said the Alderman, addressing his two
friends, with a self-complacent smile upon his face which was habitual
to him, ``I am a plain man, and a practical man; and I go to work
in a plain practical way. That's my way. There is not the least
mystery or difficulty in dealing with this sort of  people if
you only understand 'em, and can talk to 'em in their own manner. Now,
you Porter! Don't you ever tell me, or anybody else, my friend, that
you haven't always enough to eat, and of the best: because I know
better. I have tasted your tripe, you know, and you can't
<soCalled>chaff</soCalled> me. You understand what
<soCalled>chaff</soCalled> means, eh? That's the right word, isn't it?
Ha, ha, ha! Lord bless you,'' said the Alderman, turning to his
friends again, ``it's the easiest thing on earth to deal with this
sort of people, if you understand 'em.'' 

<p>Famous man for the common people, Alderman Cute! Never out of
temper with them! Easy, affable, joking, knowing gentleman! 

<p>``You see, my friend,'' pursued the Alderman, ``there's a
great deal of nonsense talked about Want -- <soCalled>hard
up</soCalled>, you know; that's the phrase, isn't it? ha! ha! ha! and
I intend to Put It Down. There's a certain amount of cant in vogue
about Starvation, and I mean to Put It Down. That's all! Lord bless
you,'' said the Alderman, turning to his friends again, you may Put
Down anything among this  sort of people, if you only know
the way to set about it!'' 

<p>Trotty took Meg's hand and drew it through his arm. He didn't seem
to know what he was doing though. 

<p>``Your daughter, eh?'' said the Alderman, chucking her
familiarly under the chin. 

<p>Always affable with the working classes, Alderman Cute! Knew what
pleased them! Not a bit of pride. 

<p>``Where's her mother?'' asked the worthy gentleman. 

<p>``Dead,'' said Toby. ``Her mother got up linen; and was
called to Heaven when She was born.'' 

<p>``Not to get up linen <STRONG>there</STRONG>, I suppose,''
remarked the Alderman pleasantly. 

<p>Toby might or might not have been able to separate his wife in
Heaven from her old pursuits. But query: If Mrs. Alderman Cute had
gone to Heaven, would Mr. Alderman Cute have pictured her as holding 
any state or station there? 

<p>``And you're making love to her, are you?'' said Cute to the
young smith.  <p>``Yes,'' returned Richard quickly, for
he was nettled by the question. ``And we are going to be married 
on New Year's Day.'' 

<p>``What do you mean!'' cried Filer sharply. ``Married!'' 

<p>``Why, yes, we're thinking of it, Master,'' said Richard.
``We're rather in a hurry, you see, in case it should be Put Down
first.'' 

<p>``Ah!'' cried Filer, with a groan. ``Put <STRONG>that</STRONG>
down indeed, Alderman, and you'll do something. Married! Married!!
The ignorance of the first principles of political economy on the part
of these people; their improvidence; their wickedness; is, by Heavens 
enough to -- Now look at that couple, will you!'' 

<p>Well? They were worth looking at. And marriage seemed as reasonable
and fair a deed as they need have in contemplation. 

<p>``A man may live to be as old as Methuselah,'' sald Mr.
Filer, ``and may labour all his life for the benefit of such people
as those; and may heap up facts on figures, facts on figures, facts on
figures,  mountains high and dry; and he can no more hope to
persuade 'em that they have no right or business to be married, than
he can hope to persuade 'em that they have no earthly right or
business to be born. And <STRONG>that</STRONG> we know they haven't. We
reduced it to a mathematical certainty long ago! 

<p>Alderman Cute was mightily diverted, and laid his right forefinger
on the side of his nose, as much as to say to both his friends,
``Observe me, will you! Keep your eye on the practical man!''
-- and called Meg to him. 

<p>``Come here, my girl!'' said Alderman Cute. 

<p>The young blood of her lover had been mounting, wrathfully, within
the last few minutes; and he was indisposed to let her come. But,
setting a constraint upon himself, he came forward with a stride as
Meg approached, and stood beside her. Trotty kept her hand within his
arm still, but looked from face to face as wildly as a sleeper in a
dream. 

<p>``Now, I'm going to give you a word or two of good advice, my
girl,'' said the Alderman, in his nice easy way. ``It's my place
to give advice, you know,  because I'm a Justice. You know
I'm a Justice, don't you?'' 

<p>Meg timidly said, ``Yes.'' But everybody knew Alderman Cute
was a Justice! Oh dear, so active a Justice always! Who such a mote of
brightness in the public eye, as Cute! 

<p>``You are going to be married, you say,'' pursued the
Alderman. ``Very unbecoming and indelicate in one of your sex! But
never mind that. After you are married, you'll quarrel with your
husband and come to be a distressed wife. You may think not-- 
but you will, because I tell you so. Now, I give you fair warning,
that I have made up my mind to Put distressed wives Down. So, don't be
brought before me. You'll have children -- boys. Those boys will
grow up bad, of course, and run wild in the streets, without shoes and
stockings. Mind my young friend! I'll convict 'em summarily, every
one, for I am determined to Put boys without shoes and stockings, 
Down. Perhaps your husband will die young (most likely) and leave you
with a baby. Then you'll be turned out of doors, and wander up and 
down the streets. Now, don't wander near me, my dear, for I
am resolved to Put all wandering mothers Down. All young mothers, of
all sorts and kinds, it's my determination to Put Down. Don't think to
 plead illness as an excuse with me; or babies as an excuse with me;
for all sick persons and young children (I hope you know the
church-service, but I'm afraid not) I am determined to Put Down. And
if you attempt, desperately, and ungratefullv. and impiously, and
fraudulently attempt, to drown yourself, or hang yourself, I'll have
no pity for you, for I have made up my mind to Put all suicide Down!
If there is one thing,'' said the Alderman, with his self-satisfied
 smile, ``on which I can be said to have made up my mind more than
on another, it is to Put suicide Down. So don't try it on. That's the
phrase, isn't it? Ha, ha! now we understand each other.'' 

<p>Toby knew not whether to be agonised or glad, to see that Meg had
turned a deadly white, and dropped her lover's hand. 

<p>``And as for you, you dull dog,'' said the Alderman, turning
with even increased cheerfulness and urbanity  to the young
smith, ``what are you thinking of being married for? What do you
want to be married for, you silly fellow? If I was a fine, young,
strapping chap like you, I should be ashamed of being milksop enough
to pin myself to a woman's apron-strings! Why, she'll be an old woman
before you're a middle-aged man! And a pretty figure you'll cut then,
with a draggle-tailed wife and a crowd of squalling children crying
after you wherever you go!'' 

<p>0h, he knew how to banter the common people, Alderman Cute! 

<p>``There! Go along with you,'' said the Alderman, ``and
repent. Don't make such a fool of yourself as to get married on New
Year's Day. You'll think very differently of it, long before next New
Year's Day; a trim young fellow like you, with all the girls looking
after you. There! Go along with you!'' 

<p>They went along. Not arm in arm, or hand in hand, or interchanging
bright glances; but, she in tears; he gloomy and down-looking. Were
these the hearts that had so lately made old Toby's leap up from its
 faintness? No, no. The Alderman (a blessing on his head!)
had Put <STRONG>them</STRONG> Down. 

<p>``As you happen to be here,'' said the Alderman to Toby,
``you shall carry a letter for me. Can you be quick? You're an old
man.'' 

<p>Toby, who had been looking after Meg, quite stupidly, made shift to
murmur out that he was very quick, and very strong. 

<p>``How old are you?'' inquired the Alderman. 

<p>``I'm over sixty, sir,'' said Toby. 

<p>``O! This man's a great deal past the average, you know,''
cried Mr. Filer, breaking in as if his patience would bear some
trying, but this really was carrying matters a little too far. 

<p>``I feel I'm intruding, sir,'' said Toby. ``I -- I
mis-doubted it this morning. Oh dear me!'' 

<p>The Alderman cut him short by giving him the letter from his
pocket. Toby would have got a shilling too; but Mr. Filer clearly
showing that in that case he would rob a certain given number of 
persons of ninepence-halfpenny a-piece, he only got sixpence; and
thought himself very well off to get that.  <p>Then the
Alderman gave an arm to each of his friends, and walked off in high
feather; but, he immediately came hurrying back alone, as if he had 
forgotten something 

<p>``Porter!'' said the Alderman. 

<p>``Sir!'' said Toby. 

<p>``Take care of that daughter of yours. She's much too
handsome.'' 

<p>``Even her good looks are stolen from somebody or other I
suppose,'' thought Toby, looking at the sixpence in his hand, and
thinking of the tripe. ``She's been and robbed five hundred ladies
of a bloom apiece, I shouldn't wonder. It's very dreadful!'' 

<p>``She's much too handsome, my man,'' repeated the Alderman.
``The chances are, that she'll come to no good, I clearly see.
Observe what I say. Take care of her!'' With which, he hurried off
again. 

<p>``Wrong every way. Wrong every way!'' said Trotty, clasping
his hands. ``Born bad. No business here!'' 

<p>The Chimes came clashing in upon him as he said the words. Full,
loud, and sounding -- but with no encouragement. No, not a drop. 
 <p>``The tune's changed,'' cried the old man, as he 
listened. ``There's not a word of all that fancy in it. Why should
there be? I have no business with the New Year nor with the old one
neither. Let me die!'' 

<p>Still the Bells, pealing forth their changes, made the very air
spin. Put 'em down, Put 'em down! Good old Times, Good old Times!
Facts and Figures, Facts and Figures! Put 'em down, Put 'em down. If
they said anything they said this, until the brain of Toby reeled. 

<p>He pressed his bewildered head between his hands, as if to keep it
from splitting asunder. A well-timed action, as it happened; for
finding the letter in one of them, and being by that means reminded of
his charge, he fell, mechanically, into his usual trot, and trotted
off.
