<p> "<em>GASPAR RUIZ </em>had clambered up on the sill, and sat
down there with his feet against the thickness of the wall and
his knees slightly bent. The window was not quite broad enough
for the length of his legs. It appeared to my crestfallen perception
that he meant to keep the window all to himself. He seemed to
be taking up a comfortable position. Nobody inside dared to approach
him now he could strike with his hands.</p>

<p>"‘Por Dios!’ I heard the sergeant muttering at my elbow, ‘I shall
shoot him through the head now, and get rid of that trouble. He
is a condemned man.’</p>

<p>"At that I looked at him angrily. ‘The general has not confirmed
the sentence,’ I said&mdash;though I knew well in my heart that these
were but vain words. The sentence required no confirmation. ‘You
have no right to shoot him unless he tries to escape,’ I added
firmly.</p>

<p>"‘But sangre de Dios!’ the sergeant yelled out, bringing his
musket up to the shoulder, ‘he is escaping now. Look!’</p>

<p>"But I, as if that Gaspar Ruiz had cast a spell upon me, struck
the musket upward, and the bullet flew over the roofs somewhere.
The sergeant dashed his arm to the ground and stared. He might
have commanded the soldiers to fire, but he did not. And if he
had he would not have been obeyed, I think, just then.</p>

<p>"With his feet against the thickness of the wall, and his hairy
hands grasping the iron bar, Gaspar sat still. It was an attitude.
Nothing happened for a time. And suddenly it dawned upon us that
he was straightening his bowed back and contracting his arms.
His lips were twisted into a snarl. Next thing we perceived was
that the bar of forged iron was being bent slowly by the mightiness
of his pull. The sun was beating full upon his cramped, unquivering
figure. A shower of sweat-drops burst out of his forehead. Watching
the bar grow crooked, I saw a little blood ooze from under his
finger-nails. Then he let go. For a moment he remained all huddled
up, with a hanging head, looking drowsily into the upturned palms
of his mighty hands. Indeed he seemed to have dozed off. Suddenly
he flung himself backwards on the sill, and setting the soles
of his bare feet against the other middle bar, he bent that one
too, but in the opposite direction from the first.</p>

<p>"Such was his strength, which in this case relieved my painful
feelings. And the man seemed to have done nothing. Except for
the change of position in order to use his feet, which made us
all start by its swiftness, my recollection is that of immobility.
But he had bent the bars wide apart. And now he could get out
if he liked; but he dropped his legs inwards; and looking over
his shoulder beckoned to the soldiers. ‘Hand up the water,’ he
said. ‘I will give them all a drink.’</p>

<p>"He was obeyed. For a moment I expected man and bucket to disappear,
overwhelmed by the rush of eagerness; I thought they would pull
him down with their teeth. There was a rush, but holding the bucket
on his lap he repulsed the assault of those wretches by the mere
swinging of his feet. They flew backwards at every kick, yelling
with pain; and the soldiers laughed, gazing at the window.</p>

<p>"They all laughed, holding their sides, except the sergeant,
who was gloomy and morose. He was afraid the prisoners would rise
and break out&mdash;which would have been a bad example. But there
was no fear of that, and I stood myself before the window with
my drawn sword. When sufficiently tamed by the strength of Gaspar
Ruiz, they came up one by one, stretching their necks and presenting
their lips to the edge of the bucket which the strong man tilted
towards them from his knees with an extraordinary air of charity,
gentleness and compassion. That benevolent appearance was of course
the effect of his care in not spilling the water and of his attitude
as he sat on the sill; for, if a man lingered with his lips glued
to the rim of the bucket after Gaspar Ruiz had said ‘You have
had enough,’ there would be no tenderness or mercy in the shove
of the foot which would send him groaning and doubled up far into
the interior of the prison, where he would knock down two or three
others before he fell himself. They came up to him again and again;
it looked as if they meant to drink the well dry before going
to their death; but the soldiers were so amused by Gaspar Ruiz’s
systematic proceedings that they carried the water up to the window
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"When the adjutant came out after his siesta there was some trouble
over this affair, I can assure you. And the worst of it, that
the general whom we expected never came to the castle that day."</p>

<p>The guests of General Santierra unanimously expressed their regret
that the man of such strength and patience had not been saved.</p>

<p>"He was not saved by my interference," said the General. "The
prisoners were led to execution half an hour before sunset. Gaspar
Ruiz, contrary to the sergeant’s apprehensions, gave no trouble.
There was no necessity to get a cavalry man with a lasso in order
to subdue him, as if he were a wild bull of the campo. I believe
he marched out with his arms free amongst the others who were
bound. I did not see. I was not there. I had been put under arrest
for interfering with the prisoner’s guard. About dusk, sitting
dismally in my quarters, I heard three volleys fired, and thought
that I should never hear of Gaspar Ruiz again. He fell with the
others. But we were to hear of him nevertheless, though the sergeant
boasted that, as he lay on his face expiring or dead in the heap
of the slain, he had slashed his neck with a sword. He had done
this, he said, to make sure of ridding the world of a dangerous
traitor.</p>

<p>"I confess to you, senores, that I thought of that strong man
with a sort of gratitude, and with some admiration. He had used
his strength honourably. There dwelt, then, in his soul no fierceness
corresponding to the vigour of his body."</p>
