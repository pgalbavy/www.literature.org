<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>One beautiful misummer night in 18&mdash; a large, heavily laden steamer
was making her way swiftly up the Pacific coast, in the direction
of San Francisco. She was opposite the California shore, only
a day's sail distant from the City of the Golden Gate, and many
of the passengers had already begun making preparations for landing,
even though a whole night and the better part of a day was to
intervene ere they could expect to set their feet upon solid land.</p>

<p>She was one of those magnificent steamers that ply regularly
between Panama and California. She had rather more than her full
cargo of freight and passengers; but, among the hundreds of the
latter, we have to do with but three.</p>

<p>On this moonlight night, there were gathered by themselves these
three personages, consisting of Tim O'Rooney, Elwood Brandon and
Howard Lawrence. The first was a burly, good-natured Irishman,
and the two latter were cousins, their ages differing by less
than a month, and both being in their sixteenth year.</p>

<p>The financial storm that swept over the country in 18&mdash;, toppling
down merchants and banking-houses like so many ten-pins, carried
with it in the general wreck and ruin, that of Brandon, Herman
&amp; Co., and the senior partner, Sylvanus Brandon, returned
to his home in Brooklyn, New York, one evening worse than penniless.
While he was meditating, dejected and gloomy, as to the means
by which he was to keep the wolf from the door, his clerk brought
him a letter which had been overlooked in the afternoon's mail,
postmarked, "San Francisco, Cal." At once he recognized the bold,
handsome superscription as that of his kind-hearted brother-in-law,
Thomas Lawrence. His heart beat with a strong hope as he broke
the envelope, and his eyes glistened ere he had read one-half.</p>

<p>In short, it stated that Mr. Lawrence had established himself
successfully in business, and was doing so well that he felt the
imperative need of a partner, and ended by urging Mr. Brandon
to accept the position. The bankrupt merchant laid the epistle
in his lap, removed his spectacles and looked smilingly toward
his wife. They held a long discussion, and both decided to accept
the offer at once, as there was no other recourse left to them.</p>

<p>It was evident from the letter that Mr. Lawrence had some apprehensions
regarding Mr. Brandon's ability to weather the storm, but he could
not be aware of his financial crash, as it had only become known
on the street within the last twenty-four hours. Mr. Brandon deemed
it proper, therefore, before closing with the offer, to acquaint
his brother-in-law with his circumstances, that he might fully
understand the disadvantage under which he would be placed by
the new partnership.</p>

<p>The letter was written and duly posted, and our friends rather
anxiously awaited the answer. It came in the gratifying form of
a draft for $1,000 to defray "his necessary expenses," and an
urgent entreaty to start without delay.</p>

<p>The advice was acted upon, and within two weeks of the reception
of the second letter, Mr. Brandon and his wife were on board the
steamer at New York, with their state-rooms engaged for California.
They had but one child, Elwood, whom they had placed at a private
school where he was to prepare himself for college, in company
with his cousin, Howard Lawrence, who had been sent from California
by his father and had entered the school at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. Brandon learned that Mr. Lawrence was a brother indeed. The
position in which the two men were placed proved so favorable
to the former that in a few years he found himself almost as wealthy
as in his palmiest days, when his name was such a power in Wall
Street. He had come to like the young and growing State of California,
and ere he had been there two years both himself and wife had
lost all longings for the metropolis of the New World.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Elwood and Howard were doing well at their
studies in Brooklyn. They had been inseparable friends from infancy,
and as their years increased the bonds of affection seemed to
strengthen between them. They were the only children of twin sisters,
and bore a remarkable resemblance in person, character and disposition.
Both had dark, curling, chestnut hair, hazel eyes, and an active
muscular organization that made them leaders in boyish pastimes
and sports. If there was any perceptible difference between the
two, it was that Elwood Brandon was a little more daring and impetuous
than his companion; he was apt to follow out his first impulses
and venture upon schemes without deliberating fully enough. Both
were generous, unselfish, and either would have willingly risked
his life for the other.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood until the summer when our young heroes had
completed their preparatory course, and were ready to enter college.
It was decided by their parents that this should be done in the
autumn, and that the summer of this year should be spent by the
boys with their parents in California. They had been separated
from them for five years, during which they had met but once,
when the parents made a journey to New York for that purpose,
spending several months with them. That visit, it may be said,
was now to be returned, and the boys meant that it should be returned
with interest.</p>

<p>And so Tim O'Rooney, a good-natured, trustworthy Irishman, who
had been in the employ of Mr. Lawrence for eight years, almost
ever since his arrival in America, was sent to New York to accompany
the boys on their visit home.</p>

<p>Howard and Elwood were standing one afternoon on the corner of
Montague Street, in Brooklyn, chatting with each other about their
expected trip to California. They had closed their school studies
a week before, and boy-like were now anxious to be off upon their
journey. Suddenly an Irishman came in sight, smoking furiously
at a short black pipe. The first glance showed them that it was
no other than Tim O'Rooney, the expected messenger.</p>

<p>"Isn't that good?" exclaimed Elwood, "the steamer sails on Saturday,
and we'll go in it. Here he comes, as though he was in a great
hurry!"</p>

<p>"Don't say anything, and see whether he will know us!"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he?"</p>

<p>"You know we've grown a good deal since he was here, and the
beard is getting so stiff on my chin that it scratches my hand
every time I touch it."</p>

<p>"Yes; that mustache, too, is making you look as fierce as a Bluebeard;
but here he is!"</p>

<p>At this instant Tim O'Rooney came opposite them. He merely glanced
up, puffed harder than ever and was passing on, when both burst
out in a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"Be the powers! what's the mather with ye spalpeens?" he angrily
demanded. "Can't a dacent man be passing the sthrats widout being
insulted-&mdash;Howly mother! is it yerselves or is it your grandfathers?"</p>

<p>He had recognized them, and a hearty hand-shaking followed. Tim
grinned a great deal over his mistake, and answered their questions
in his dry, witty way, and assured them that his instructions
were to bring them home as soon as possible. Accordingly, they
embarked on the steamer on the following Saturday; and, passing
over the unimportant incidents of their voyage, we come back to
our starting point, where all three were within a day's journey
of their destination.</p>
