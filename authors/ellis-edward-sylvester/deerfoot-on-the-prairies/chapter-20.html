<p>"IT can’t be," gasped the mystified George; "you’re mistaken."</p>

<p>"Come and see for yourself; where did you leave your clothes?"</p>

<p>"Over there on top of that boulder," replied George, coming forward
and staring at the object named.</p>

<p>"Well, do you see them <em>now</em>?"</p>

<p>"Maybe the wind blew them off," weakly suggested the other, although
he knew such a thing was impossible, for there had not been a
breath of air stirring for hours.</p>

<p>The two made careful search. Not a stitch of their garments was
to be seen.</p>

<p>"And the thieves have taken those we spread out to dry. Aren’t
we in a pretty fix? We’ll have to travel naked until we can kill
a bear or two and rob them of their hides."</p>

<p>"Who was the thief?" was the superfluous query of George, staring
here and there in quest of the wretch who had done this "low down"
thing. "You don’t suppose it was Mul-tal-la?"</p>

<p>"No; how could it be? What would he want of our clothes? We saw
him go down the trail; I don’t believe he is within a mile of
us."</p>

<p>"Maybe Black Elk and his warriors have been following and waiting
for a chance of this kind."</p>

<p>Victor shook his head. The thought was preposterous.</p>

<p>"He couldn’t have known there would be any such chance, and if
he wanted to do us harm he would have done it long ago. B-r-r-r-r!
I’m cold!" muttered the lad with a shiver.</p>

<p>The matter was becoming serious, for if their clothing was gone
they were in a woeful plight indeed. You will bear in mind that
coats, trousers, caps, stockings, shoes—everything had disappeared.
The theft included the underclothing that had been removed and
cleansed by the boys, as well as the extra suits taken from the
pack carried by Zigzag. Since these made up the only two undersuits
owned by the brothers, you will admit that their situation could
not have been more cheerless.</p>

<p>A curious fact was that their guns had not been disturbed, though
both were left leaning against the boulder on which the clothing
was laid, and must therefore have been seen by the rogue.</p>

<p>"We’ll have to go into the water to get warm again," said Victor,
with folded arms, bent form and rattling teeth. "I don’t see that
we can do anything but wait till Mul-tal-la comes back."</p>

<p>"What can <em>he</em> do?"</p>

<p>"If he can’t find our clothes he can go out and rob some bears
or other wild animals of theirs, and let us have ’em"——</p>

<p>George Shelton caught a flying glimpse of a tightly rolled bundle
of clothing which at that instant shot through the air and, striking
Victor in the back of the neck, sent him sprawling on his hands
and knees. George turned to see the point whence came the pack,
and at the same instant a similar one landed full in his face
and knocked him backward. But he had caught sight of Deerfoot,
the Shawanoe, who rose from the farther side of an adjoining boulder,
and both heard his chuckle, for he could not resist the temptation
of having a little fun at the expense of the brothers.</p>

<p>"We might have known it was <em>you</em>," exclaimed Victor,
clambering to his feet and proceeding to untie the knots in his
shirt and drawers, and finding it no slight task.</p>

<p>"We won’t forget this," added George, warningly; "you think you
are very smart, but we’ll catch you some time when you are not
watching."</p>

<p>Deerfoot was shaking with merriment, and as he came forward he
said:</p>

<p>"My brothers need not wear bare-skins as they feared they would
have to do."</p>

<p>(This is the only pun of which we have any record that was ever
made by Deerfoot.)</p>

<p>The shivering lads began donning their clothing, and then shook
hands with their friend. The meeting was a happy one. The Shawanoe
was as glad to see them as they were to meet him, whom they had
missed more than they had ever supposed could be possible. He
told them he had nursed Whirlwind until his lameness was gone,
when he set out at a leisurely pace to overtake his friends. On
the way he fell in with Black Elk, the Shoshone chief, and spent
several hours in his company. Though it was not easy for the two
to understand each other, they managed to do so through the universal
sign language to the extent that the Shawanoe learned that the
chieftain had acted the part of a friend to the Blackfoot and
the boys when they were in danger from a roving band of Cas-ta-ba-nas.
So, knowing all was well, Deerfoot had not hurried to overtake
the party in advance.</p>

<p>"Where’s Whirlwind?" asked Victor, while hastily dressing himself.</p>

<p>"He is modest," replied Deerfoot. "When my brothers are clad
to receive company he will come forward to greet them."</p>

<p>"Seems to me you’re getting mighty particular, Deerfoot."</p>

<p>It took the boys but a short time to dress, when, after hopping
about for a minute or two, to restore their numbed circulation,
they became comfortable. Being satisfied with an inspection, Deerfoot
emitted a sharp whistle. It was immediately answered by a neigh,
and the next moment the magnificent black stallion trotted into
view around a bend in the trail and approached the party. Proud
as ever, he paid no attention to the other horses, who raised
their heads and saluted him as he came in view.</p>

<p>Halting a few paces away, he looked at his master as if awaiting
his commands.</p>

<p>"Cannot Whirlwind bow to his friends?" gravely asked the Shawanoe;
"since they are not polite enough to salute him, let him teach
them what is right."</p>

<p>The horse bent his head forward, drawing in his nose slightly
and making a graceful obeisance.</p>

<p>"This is George Shelton; my brother does not know much, but he
means well."</p>

<p>Whirlwind stepped slowly forward and then sank on one knee. It
was the one that had been lame, but it was now as strong as ever.</p>

<p>"This is my brother Victor; he means well <em>sometimes</em>,
but my brother must not be trusted too far."</p>

<p>"I wonder that he pays us any attention after the character you
have given us," remarked Victor, who nevertheless bowed low to
the salutation of the stallion.</p>

<p>Deerfoot now gave a striking demonstration of the intelligence
of Whirlwind and of the training which he had received during
the comparatively brief time that he and his master had been alone
together. Not looking at him, the Shawanoe addressed Victor:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot would be glad if Whirlwind would stand up for him."</p>

<p>That the stallion understood these words was proved by his instantly
rising as nearly erect as possible on his hind feet.</p>

<p>"Now let him give my brother’s handkerchief to his brother."</p>

<p>Whirlwind thrust his nose forward and began fumbling about the
breast of Victor. In a moment he drew his handkerchief from an
inside pocket, stepped across to the pleased and wondering George,
and shoved it into his coat.</p>

<p>"That gives my brother two handkerchiefs. It is not right. Let
Whirlwind put the first one back where it belongs."</p>

<p>Without hesitation the animal obeyed.</p>

<p>"The gun leaning against the rock—the one nearest us—belongs
to my brother Victor. He is lazy; therefore let Whirlwind bring
it to him."</p>

<p>The stallion walked the few steps necessary, turned his head
sideways and, grasping the rifle of Victor near its stock in his
teeth, brought it to the amazed youth.</p>

<p>"Now make him bring mine to me," said George.</p>

<p>"No; he has done enough of that; get it for yourself. Now, Whirlwind,
Deerfoot is pleased with you; come forward and kiss him."</p>

<p>The horse walked up in front of the Shawanoe, thrust out his
tongue and licked his cheek. His master kissed his nose, patted
his neck and spoke endearingly to him. There could be no question
that the wonderful animal was happy and proud in the affection
of his master, who, in his way, was more remarkable than he, since
he had taught him all this.</p>

<p>"Only one thing is lacking," remarked Victor, after he and George
had expressed their amazement; "you ought to teach him to talk."</p>

<p>"Though he may not use words like men, yet he can make his meaning
known to Deerfoot, and that is enough."</p>

<p>"There isn’t any doubt about his knowing what <em>you</em> say.
You ought to teach him to be more considerate of the feelings
of Bug and Jack and Prince and Zigzag. He doesn’t seem to care
anything for them."</p>

<p>"Whirlwind has the right to treat those of his kind as he pleases.
None of them is his equal. Deerfoot is glad to see how careful
he is of his company. If he is willing to notice my brothers,"
added the Shawanoe with a smile, "isn’t <em>that</em> enough?"</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that the stallion gave the most remarkable
proof of his intelligence that had yet been seen. It almost struck
the boys dumb with astonishment.</p>

<p>You remember that after washing their underclothing they spread
them out on the ground to dry in the sun. Deerfoot brought the
garments from where he had hid them and again spread them out.
They had lain a considerable time, and Victor was about to inspect
them to see if the moisture had evaporated, but Deerfoot checked
him. Addressing the stallion he said:</p>

<p>"Let Whirlwind examine the clothes lying on the ground; if they
are dry, he will hand them to my brothers; if they are wet, he
will leave them lie where they are."</p>

<p>Victor’s first fear was that the brute was about to chew up his
garments, for he closed his teeth in a corner of his shirt, held
it a moment, sniffing at it, and then came over and laid it at
the feet of the youth. Of course he could not know that the article
belonged to this lad, for he had not been told.</p>

<p>He returned and in the same manner picked up the other garment
belonging to Victor and started to lay that also at his feet.
After a single pace he stopped, shook his head and flung the article
back where it had been lying.</p>

<p>"That isn’t quite dry enough," said the wondering and laughing
owner. "I wonder how it is with your clothes, George."</p>

<p>Precisely the same thing was repeated with the underclothing
belonging to George Shelton. One garment was dry, but the other
retained a little dampness, which, however, would soon disappear.</p>

<p>"Don’t ask him to do anything more," said Victor; "I shall be
scared. It does seem that such animals should have souls."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is sure they have," replied the Shawanoe with deep
feeling.</p>

<p>Deerfoot now told Whirlwind to leave them for the time. He strolled
off to the more abundant growth of grass on the other side of
the trail. The three watched him amusedly, and noticed that he
kept apart from the other horses. He was a born aristocrat, and
always would remain so.</p>

<p>Zigzag was munching and looked up at the stallion, as if he felt
like renewing the acquaintance that had not been of a very pleasing
character. He kept an eye on Whirlwind, and when he began cropping
the grass Zigzag had the temerity to try to join him. Before he
reached the stallion, however, he received too plain a hint to
disregard. Whirlwind deliberately faced the other way, thus placing
his heels toward the horse, so as to be ready for use when Zigzag
came within reach. The latter paused, looked reproachfully at
Whirlwind, and then solemnly walked back to his former companions.
The snubbing was as emphatic as the former and was sufficient.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mul-tal-la came in sight and joined his friends.
All sat down on the boulders and exchanged experiences. Deerfoot
had little to tell that was of interest. He was not disturbed
by the cloudburst, and his occupation while absent from his friends
had been, as he stated, the looking after and training of Whirlwind.
The animal recovered from his lameness sooner than his master
expected, and the latter could have rejoined his companions sooner,
but he spent hours in "getting acquainted" with his prize and
in training him to understand the words spoken to him. It has
already been told that some of the commands of Deerfoot were uttered
in a mixture of languages, or rather in no language at all, the
object being to throw difficulties in the way of anyone who might
possibly gain possession of the stallion for a time.</p>

<p>The Blackfoot gave it as his belief that they would have no further
trouble with people of his own race. They were approaching the
Blackfoot country, and, though some of the tribes through whose
grounds they must yet pass warred with one another, there was
no hostility between any of them and the Blackfeet, unless it
had broken out during the absence of Mul-tal-la, which was not
likely.</p>

<p>While the friends were holding this familiar converse, the Blackfoot
thought the time had come to warn them against a danger they were
likely to be called upon to face, though it had not presented
itself as yet. He told them of a species of bear, sometimes seen
farther north, which was of such enormous size and ferocity that
no single hunter dare fight him alone. Mul-tal-la said that he
and three of his people had had such a fight, with disastrous
results to the Blackfeet. Two of the latter had guns, which, though
of an antique pattern, were effective and would have quickly killed
an ordinary animal. The bear was shot repeatedly, but he slew
one of the warriors who had firearms and wounded another so badly
that he died a few weeks later. And in the end the bear got away,
apparently none the worse because of the bullets and arrows that
were driven into his body.</p>
