<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse acted as if he thought he had been a great help when he
said that Chirpy Cricket would have to think of another way to avoid
Simon Screecher's cruel talons. But the more Chirpy turned the matter
over in his mind the further he seemed to be from any plan. For several
days and nights he puzzled over his problem. And every time he heard
Simon Screecher's unearthly wail he shivered so hard that his fiddling
actually seemed to shiver too.
</p>
<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse inquired regularly whether Chirpy had hit upon any plan.
And at last Mr. Meadow Mouse announced that he would have to think of one
himself. So he sat down and looked very wise, while Chirpy Cricket
fiddled for him, because Mr. Meadow Mouse explained that his wits always
worked better when somebody made music for him.
</p><p>"Didn't you notice his cry a little while ago?" Mr. Meadow Mouse asked.
"Didn't you notice how his voice trembled?"
</p><p>"Yes!" Chirpy said. "Yes! Now that you speak of it, I remember that his
voice shook a good deal."
</p><p>"Ah!" Mr. Meadow Mouse exclaimed. "Something had frightened him. Now, you
had just begun to fiddle before he cried out. And there's no doubt in my
mind that your music scared Simon Screecher. So all you need do to feel
safe from him is to fiddle a plenty every night."
</p><p>Chirpy Cricket felt so happy all at once that he began a lively tune. And
sure enough! Simon Screecher squalled almost immediately.
</p><p>"That proves it!" Mr. Meadow Mouse exclaimed. And then he said good
evening and ran off to the place where Farmer Green had been threshing
oats, feeling very well pleased with himself.
</p><p>Chirpy Cricket took pains to follow Mr. Meadow Mouse's advice. And
neither Simon Screecher--nor his cousin Solomon Owl--troubled Chirpy all
the rest of the summer. He fiddled the nights away with more pleasure
than ever before. And by the time fall came all his neighbors agreed that
he had done even more than his part to make the summer gay for
everybody.
