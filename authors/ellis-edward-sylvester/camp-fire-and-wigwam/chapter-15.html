<p>Easy and negligent as was the posture assumed by Deerfoot the
Shawanoe, his eyes were never at rest. Resting for a moment on
the promontory, they darted to the right and left down the valley,
and even took in the shifting clouds in the sky above. But it
was the peak which riveted his attention, and which was scrutinized
with minute closeness until the gathering gloom shut it from sight.</p>

<p>It was not fairly dark when he kindled a fire on the very highest
point, and then placing himself so far from it that the glare
could not interfere with his sight, he looked out in the night.
The darkness was such that nothing could be seen beyond his immediate
surroundings, but he knew where to look for that which he expected
and yet did not want to see. For fully an hour the Shawanoe held
his motionless attitude, gazing as fixedly to the southward as
ever an eagle stared at the sun. Then that for which he was waiting
appeared.</p>

<p>From the very crest of the distant mountain peak, a flaming arrow
suddenly began climbing toward the stars. Up, up it went, as does
the rocket on a summer night, going slower and slower, like an
old man plodding up hill, until, wearied out, it paused, and,
for one instant remained stationary in the air, as if doubtful
whether to push on or to fall back. The flaming point swung over
until it pointed toward the ground, when it shot downward with
ever increasing swiftness until it vanished. It must have struck
within a yard of the spot from which it had been driven upward.</p>

<p>It was very rarely that Deerfoot showed excitement. He had drawn
his knife and challenged the great Tecumseh to mortal conflict,
and he had faced death a score of times in the most dreadful shapes,
but very rarely, if ever, was his heart stirred as by the sight
of the burning arrow on the distant mountain peak.</p>

<p>He straightened up with a quick inspiration, and his eyes followed
the course of the fiery missile from the moment of its appearance
until it vanished.</p>

<p>"<em>They have called for Deerfoot!</em>"</p>

<p>These were the remarkable words which fell from his lips, as
he plunged down the mountain side like one who knew a question
of life and death was before him. Although Deerfoot had formed
a friendship for Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub similar to that
which he had felt for Ned Preston and Wildblossom Brown, yet it
must be admitted that they were not the only ones to whom he was
strongly attached, and in whose fate he felt as deep an interest
as in that of any human being&mdash;all of which shall be made clear
in another place and at another time.</p>

<p>It was just one week later that Deerfoot made his appearance
near the settlement, and, pausing at a point which commanded a
view of the collection of cabins, he spent several minutes in
surveying them and the pioneers. He had traveled many miles, and
been through some singularly stirring scenes since he last looked
upon Martinsville, but the gracious Being that had protected him
all his life, did not desert him in his extremity, and the frame
was as supple and free from weakness or injury as when he faced
the other way.</p>

<p>When the burning arrow summoned Deerfoot down the mountain side,
he was glad indeed that he had decided the question whether or
not he should hunt for the boys as he did, for, had he done otherwise,
the opportunity that has been described could not have come to
him; but, when his duty was ended, the old doubt came back, until
he had been driven to return in order that he might settle the
question forever.</p>

<p>Looking down on the little settlement of Martinsville, he studied
the curious scene, for he was so close that he could identify
every person whom he knew. The settlement, as the reader has been
told, consisted of two rows of log cabins, facing each other.
They numbered about a score, and the street was fifty feet wide.
Besides that, each cabin had the same space between itself and
its neighbor, so that, few as were the structures, they were scattered
over considerable ground.</p>

<p>This ground, as well as much of it beyond, had been well cleared,
and the earth cultivated. There were horses and oxen to draw plows
and help bear the burdens. Besides the hunters' cabins, there
were storehouses, barns, and structures made for convenience or
necessity. From most of the soil that had been overturned were
sprouting corn, potatoes, and other vegetables. The time was not
distant when the wilderness should blossom as the rose.</p>

<p>A block-house near the middle of the settlement had been half
completed, when, so far as could be seen, the work was abandoned.
The rule with the frontier settlements was to put up a building
in which all could take refuge, should danger threaten; but often
the fort was so hastily and poorly made that it became a matter
of weakness rather than of strength. Colonel Martin and his brother
pioneers reached the conclusion that they were showing altogether
too much haste in rearing the structure, and they deferred its
completion to a more convenient season. Their duty to their families,
as they saw it, justified them in taking such a step, especially
in view of the fact that the Indians of the surrounding country
were not likely ever to cause them trouble.</p>

<p>The cleared land, as it was called, was still disfigured by numerous
unsightly stumps, around which the rude plow was pulled; but here
and there men were working to remove them, and ultimately all
would be uprooted and destroyed.</p>

<p>On the edge of the clearing, three woodsmen were swinging their
axes and burying their keen edges in the hearts of the monarchs
of the wood. Deerfoot looked at them several minutes, noticing
as he had done before, with childish wonder, how long it took
the sound caused by the blows to reach him. When one of the choppers
stopped to breathe and leaned on his axe, the sound of two blows
came to the listener, and when he resumed work, the youth saw
him in the act of striking the third time before the sound was
heard.</p>

<p>The scene was one of activity and industry. Even the children
seemed to have work instead of play to occupy them. The women,
as a matter of course, were among the busiest, and rarely did
one of them appear at the door of her cabin. When she did so,
it was only for a very brief while.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was looking fixedly at one of the houses near the middle
of the settlement, when a squatty figure, with a conical hat,
a heavy cane, and smoking a pipe, came out and walked slowly toward
a cabin only a short distance off. The Indian smiled in his momentary,
shadowy fashion when he recognized Jacob Relstaub, whom he had
frightened almost out of his wits a week before. No doubt the
German had told the incident many times afterward, and would always
insist he escaped by a veritable hair's breadth.</p>

<p>But Deerfoot was troubled in mind, for among all whom he saw
he recognized neither Jack Carleton nor Otto Relstaub. It was
not likely that, if they had returned from their hunt, both would
continue invisible very long; but when minute after minute passed
without showing either, his heart sank.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe knew a scene would be probable if Jacob Relstaub
caught sight of him, so he avoided the wrathful German. The appearance
of the handsome warrior moving among the cabins, naturally awakened
some interest. Men and children looked at him as he went by, and
several of the latter followed him. Deerfoot saluted all whose
eyes met his, calling out: "Good day; how is my brother?" in as
excellent English as any of them could have employed.</p>

<p>The Indian, it may be supposed, was known to nearly every one
by reputation. Most of the settlers had heard of his exploits
when they and he lived in Kentucky; they knew he guided Otto Relstaub
and Jack Carleton on their perilous journey from the Dark and
Bloody Ground into Louisiana; they were aware, too, that he could
read and write, and was one of the most sagacious and valuable
friends the settlers ever had or could have. The story which Jacob
Relstaub told was therefore received with much doubt, and no one
who listened felt any distrust of the loyalty of the young Shawanoe.
More than one declared on general principles that Relstaub would
have been served right had the warrior handled him roughly, as
it was well known he could have done had he been so minded.</p>

<p>Deerfoot walked quietly along the primitive street until opposite
the door of Widow Carleton's cabin. Without hesitation, he pulled
the latch string and stepped within. There was no start or change
of expression when he glanced about the apartment, but that single
glance told him the story.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton was standing at the table on the other side of
the room, occupied with the dishes that had served at the morning
meal. Her back was toward the visitor, but she turned like a flash
when she heard the door open. The scared, expectant, disappointed,
and apprehensive expression that flitted over her countenance,
like the passing of a cloud across a summer landscape, made known
the truth to the sagacious Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot's brother has not come back from his long hunt," he
said, in his usual voice, as he bowed and advanced to the middle
of the apartment.</p>

<p>"O Deerfoot!" moaned the mother, as, with tremulous lip, she
sank into the nearest chair and looked pleadingly toward him,
holding her apron ready to raise to her eyes; "tell me where is
my Jack!"</p>

<p>"My friend told Deerfoot that his brother had gone to hunt the
horse that has wandered off."</p>

<p>"But that was more than a week ago; he ought to have come back
a good while since. O Deerfoot&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But the horse has wandered many miles, and it will take my brother
a long time to find him," interrupted the visitor, who dreaded
the scene which he saw was sure to come.</p>

<p>"Do you think they are still hunting for him?" she asked with
a sudden, yearning eagerness that went to the heart of the Indian.
He could not speak an untruth, nor could he admit the great fear
that almost stopped the beating of his heart.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot cannot answer his friend; but he hopes soon to take
the hand of his brother."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will never be&mdash;it can never be. My poor Jack!"</p>

<p>Her grief could be restrained no longer. The apron was abruptly
raised to the eyes, and as the white hands were pressed against
the face her whole frame shook with emotion. Deerfoot looked steadily
at the pitiful scene, but he knew not what to say or do. It was
a vivid illustration of this strange nature of ours that the youth,
who absolutely knew not what fear was, and who had seen the glittering
tomahawk crash its way into the brain without a throb of pity,
now found his utmost self-command hardly able to save him from
breaking down as utterly as did the parent before him. He hastily
swallowed the lump that kept rising in his throat, blinked his
eyes very rapidly, coughed, fidgeted on the bench whereon he sat,
and, finally, looked away and upward at the rude rafters, so as
to avoid the sight of the sobbing woman.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is a pappoose," he muttered angrily, "that he weeps
when he knows not what for; he is a dog that whines before his
master strikes him."</p>

<p>A brief but resolute struggle gave him the mastery over his emotions,
though for a few seconds he dared not look towards his hostess.
When he timidly ventured to do so, she was rubbing her eyes with
the corner of her apron. The tempest of grief had passed, and
she was regaining mastery of herself, thereby rendering great
help to the valiant warrior.</p>

<p>"I know that it may be possible that Jack and Otto have gone
on a longer hunt than before, but they did not expect to be away
more than three or four days, and Jack would not willingly bring
sorrow to his mother."</p>

<p>"My brother may have gone so far that he has lost his way, and
is slow in finding it again."</p>

<p>"Do you think so, Deerfoot?"</p>

<p>The Indian fidgeted, but he could not avoid an answer.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot does not know; he cannot think right; he is in sore
trouble for his brothers."</p>

<p>"No one can help them like you. O Deerfoot, won't you find my
Jack and bring him home to me?"</p>

<p>The youthful warrior rose to his feet, and looking her in the
face, spoke the words, "<em>I will!</em>" Then he turned and strode
out of the door.</p>
