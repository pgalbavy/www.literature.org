<p>On the fourth day after the arrival of the hunters at their cabin,
the accident of which Mr. Linden made mention befell Bowlby. It
was early in the morning, when the three were making their round
of visits to the traps. Since no two inspected the same ones,
they were quite widely separated from each other. Bowlby was walking
over a rocky stretch of land alongside the creek when a loose
stone turned under his foot, giving his ankle such a wrench that
when he tried to stand he found he could not bear the least weight
on it. It was one of those hurts that are more painful and troublesome
than a fractured limb.</p>

<p>"Here's a pretty go," he growled, as he sat down on the ground,
his face contorted with pain; "it'll be a long time before I'll
be able to stand, and the boys will have to bring one of the hosses
here or else carry me home. <em>Hello!</em>"</p>

<p>He shouted at the top of his voice, feeling no alarm, for he
knew that his friends would come to his relief before long, even
if they did not hear his voice; but then he reflected, as he sat
on the ground beside the two beavers that he had killed and was
carrying to his home, that he was in bad form if a wild animal
should assail him, or there should happen to be a hostile Indian
prowling in the vicinity. He had left his gun at the cabin, as
was his practice, since he needed all his strength to bring in
the products of the traps.</p>

<p>He was startled, therefore, after his third shout; an Indian
warrior, fully armed, walked out of the wood and came toward him;
but his signs of peace, and more than all, the words he uttered,
removed his fears.</p>

<p>"My brother suffers; Deerfoot will help him to his cabin."</p>

<p>"If that's so," said the greatly relieved Bowlby, "you're just
the chap I'm waiting for. We'll leave these beavers here for the
others to come after, and if you'll let me lean on your shoulder
I guess I can hobble back; but I'll have to lean heavy," he added,
looking doubtfully at the Indian, "and you ain't much more than
a likely lad."</p>

<p>"Let my brother try me," said Deerfoot, with a smile.</p>

<p>The disabled hunter did try him, often compelled, as he was,
to bear to such an extent upon his new friend that it may be said
the latter sustained half his weight. The progress was slow, and
when they reached a small stream of water, Bowlby sat down and
allowed the young Shawanoe to bathe the inflamed limb. Great relief
was felt.</p>

<p>During this labored walk homeward, the two naturally talked a
good deal together and learned much about each other. Deerfoot
said that he had often hunted through the surrounding country,
and he told why it was he had found it necessary to leave his
tribe on the other side of the Mississippi. He said that he had
spent more than one night in the deserted cabin of Bowlby and
his friends during the summer months, when he found himself belated
in the vicinity, and he once shot a wolf that was resolved on
entering against his protest. It was his intention to make a call
upon the hunters, and if they needed his aid, he was glad to give
it in the way of helping trap or shoot game. You need not be told
that though James Bowlby felt an innate dislike of the American
race, there was now one exception: henceforth he was the sworn
friend of Deerfoot the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>Linden and Hardin had got back from making their rounds, and
were wondering what could have delayed their friend, when they
saw him limping painfully on one foot, and supported by a fine
looking young Indian warrior. Their astonishment was great, for
they could not understand what it meant. Linden hastened to the
help of Bowlby, but he waved him aside and said no one could do
as well as Deerfoot.</p>

<p>While Hardin went out to bring in the two beavers that had been
taken from the traps by Bowlby, the latter was assisted to a seat
on the log in front of the cabin. Then Deerfoot insisted on giving
attention to the injured limb. It had swollen a great deal since
he bathed it. There was nothing in the cabin in the way of ointment
or liniment, but Deerfoot hastened into the wood and soon came
back with the leaves of some plant whose virtues seemed to be
well known to him. These were wrapped in a piece of linen, which
the establishment managed to afford, and pounded to a pulp, and
then the poultice was gently applied to the inflamed ankle. Bowlby
declared that it felt better at once, but his face lengthened
when Deerfoot told him that it would be a moon, or several weeks,
before he would fully recover the use of his limb.</p>

<p>"That will make us short-handed, and we need every one," said
Mr. Linden; "I wish Fred was here to give us help."</p>

<p>"I think I can ride my hoss to Greville," said Bowlby, "and bring
him back with me."</p>

<p>"That is hardly worth while."</p>

<p>"Where is the home of my brother?" gently asked Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"At the settlement of Greville, about a hundred miles to the
north."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot knows where it is," he replied; "he will take a message
for his brother, for his footsteps lead him that way."</p>

<p>"You're a mighty clever Indian; I will be ever so much obliged
to you," said Linden; "I will write a few lines to my boy, which
will explain our trouble, though I have no doubt you could take
the message just as well; but it is such an unexpected one that
the boy might doubt it unless it was in my own writing. See?"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe nodded his head to signify that it was all clear
to him. Linden passed within the cabin, where he hurriedly wrote
the few lines that are already known to the reader, folded the
paper, and wrote on the outside:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>FREDERICK LINDEN,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Grevil."

</p>
</div>
<p>He then handed it to Deerfoot, saying:</p>

<p>"There is no special hurry, and if you are in the neighborhood
of Greville, and can make it convenient to leave that at my house,
it will be a great kindness to me."</p>

<p>"If the Great Spirit does not will different it shall be in his
hands before the setting of three more suns, but," added Deerfoot,
looking at the superscription on the back of the paper, "has not
my brother made a mistake?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"When Deerfoot writes the word 'Greville,' he adds two letters
more than does my brother; perhaps, though, Deerfoot is wrong."</p>

<p>No pen can describe the amazement that appeared on the faces
of Linden and Bowlby. Here was a young Indian teaching a white
man old enough to be his father how to spell in the English language!
Was the like ever known?</p>

<p>For a full minute neither of the hunters spoke. They were sitting
on the log, while Deerfoot was standing in front of them. He held
his rifle in his right hand and the folded piece of paper in his
left, while he looked inquiringly down in the faces of the two
men, whose mouths and eyes were open, as though they could not
believe the evidence of their own senses. Finally, with a deep
sigh, Linden slowly rose to his feet&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, by gracious! if that don't beat every thing! Do you mean
to say that you can read <em>writing</em>? Impossible!"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "For a full minute neither of the hunters spoke."]</p>

<p>Then, as if still in doubt, he reached out and took the paper.
Drawing a stump of a lead pencil from his pocket he completed
the word properly, opened the paper, and handing it back to the
Indian, said:</p>

<p>"Let's hear you read <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>"My brother writes so that any one can read his words," observed
the young Shawanoe by way of introduction, and then in a low,
soft voice he read the brief note from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Bowlby, who had not yet spoken, seemed unable to express his
emotions. Unable himself to read, the attainment of the Indian
was almost past belief. As the best thing, therefore, that he
could do, he solemnly reached out his hand to Linden and shook
it with great earnestness. Settling painfully back on the log,
he nodded his head several times as if he was almost overcome,
as indeed was the case.</p>

<p>I should state at this point that although Linden had not seen
fit to make it known, he had heard of Deerfoot the Shawanoe long
before. He knew of some of his exploits in Kentucky, as well as
those of later years on the western bank of the Mississippi (which
are told in the "Young Pioneer" and the "Log Cabin Series"), but
he had never met the youth, nor had he ever heard or suspected
that he knew how to read and write. Taking hold of his arm, he
asked:</p>

<p>"Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you learn that?
When I wrote to Fred that I would tell him some things about you
I did not know of the most extraordinary of all&mdash;that which I
have just seen. Sit right down here, between me and Jim, and let
us know all about it."</p>

<p>Deerfoot held back, but yielded, and finally answered in his
modest way the numerous questions with which he was plied. Bowlby
had managed to find his tongue, and his queries were about twice
as numerous as those of his companion. By the time that Deerfoot
had time to rest, Hardin came back, and there was little left
to tell.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe had captured the Hunters of the Ozark. They insisted
that he should stay to dinner with them, and he did so. Then he
was badgered to enter into a shooting match. All were fine marksmen,
and Linden was the best shot in Greville. Using his own rifle,
Deerfoot beat every one of them. Then he exchanged weapons and
allowed the crippled Bowlby to rest his piece, and the Shawanoe
beat all three just as badly as before. They were delighted, and
slapping him on the back, asked him to spend a week with them,
but he shook his head.</p>

<p>The sun was already beyond the meridian, and there were reasons
for his departure which he could not explain. They liked him too
well to insist, though they made him promise that on the first
chance he would make them a visit. Then Deerfoot gravely pressed
hands with all and quickly disappeared in the woods, taking the
trail that led toward Greville. You have already learned about
his meeting with Terry Clark and Fred Linden.</p>
