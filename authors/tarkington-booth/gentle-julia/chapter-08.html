<p>"Do you s'pose," she said, at last, in a musing voice: "Herbert,
do you s'pose maybe there's some poor family's children somewheres
that haven't got any playthings or anything and we could take
all these&#11834;"</p>

<p>But here Herbert proved unsympathetic. "I'm not goin' to give
my insecks to any poor people's children," he said emphatically.
"I don't care how poor they are!"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought maybe just as a surprise&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I won't do it. I had mighty hard work to catch this c'lection,
and I'm not goin' to give it away to anybody, I don't care how
surprised they'd be! Anyway, I'd never get any thanks for it;
they wouldn't know how to handle 'em, and they'd get all stung
up: and what'd be the use, anyhow? I don't see how <em>that's</em>
goin' to be somep'n so interesting we'd never forget it."</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I guess it wouldn't. I just thought it would
be kind of a bellnevolent thing to do."</p>

<p>This word disturbed Herbert, but he did not feel altogether secure
in his own impression that "benovvalent" was the proper rendition
of what she meant, and so refrained from criticism. Their musing
was resumed.</p>

<p>"There's one thing I do wish," Florence said suddenly, after
a time. "I wish we could find some way to use the c'lection that
would be useful for Noble Dill."</p>

<p>Now, at this, her cousin's face showed simple amazement. "What
on earth you talkin' about?"</p>

<p>"Noble Dill," she said dreamily. "He's the only one I like that
comes to see Aunt Julia. Anyway, I like him the most."</p>

<p>"I bet Aunt Julia don't!"</p>

<p>"I don't care: he's the one <em>I</em> wish she'd get married
to."</p>

<p>Herbert was astounded. "Noble Dill? Why, I heard mamma and Aunt
Hattie and Uncle Joe talkin' about him yesterday."</p>

<p>"What'd they say?"</p>

<p>"Most of the time," said Herbert, "they just laughed. They said
Noble Dill was the very last person in this town Aunt Julia'd
ever dream o' marryin'. They said he wasn't anything: they said
he wasn't handsome and he wasn't distingrished-looking&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I think he is," Florence interposed. "I think he's <em>very</em>
distingrished-looking."</p>

<p>"Well, they said he wasn't, and they know more'n you do. Why,
Noble Dill isn't hardly any taller'n I am myself, and he hasn't
got any muscle partickyourly. Aunt Julia wouldn't look at him!"</p>

<p>"She does, too! My goodness, how could he sit on the porch, right
in front of her, for two or three hours at a time, without her
lookin' at him?"</p>

<p>"I don't care," Herbert insisted stubbornly. "<em>They</em> said
Aunt Julia wouldn't. They said she was the worst flirt had ever
been in the whole family and Noble Dill had the worst case they
ever saw, but she wouldn't ever look at him, and if she did she'd
be crazy."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," said Florence, "I think he's the nicest of all
that goes to see her, and I wish we could use this c'lection some
way that would be nice for him."</p>

<p>Herbert renewed his protest. "How many times I got to tell you
I had a hard enough time catchin' this c'lection, day in and day
out, from before daylight till after dark, and then fixin' 'em
all up like this and everything! I don't prapose to waste 'em
just to suit Noble Dill, and I'm not goin' to give 'em away either.
If anybody wanted to buy 'em and offered a good fair price, money
down, why, I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>That's</em> it, Herbert!" his lady-cousin exclaimed with
sudden excitement. "Let's sell 'em!" She jumped up, her eyes bright.
"I bet we could get maybe five dollars for 'em. We can pour the
ones that are in the jars that haven't got tops and the ones in
the jelly glasses and pill-boxes&mdash;we can pour all those into the
jars that have got tops, and put the tops on again, and that'd
just about fill those jars&mdash;and then we could put 'em in a basket
and take 'em out and sell 'em!"</p>

<p>"Where could we sell 'em?" Herbert inquired, not convinced.</p>

<p>"At the fish store!" she cried. "Everybody uses bugs and worms
for bait when they go fishing, don't they? I bet the fish man'll
buy all the worms we got, even if he wouldn't buy anything else.
I bet he'll buy all the others, too! I bet he never saw as much
good bait as this all at one time in his whole life! I bet he'll
give us five dollars&mdash;maybe more!"</p>

<p>Herbert was dazzled; the thought of this market was a revelation&mdash;nothing
could have been more plausible. Considered as bait, the c'lection
at once seemed to acquire a practical and financial value which
it lacked, purely as a c'lection. And with that the amateur and
scientist disappeared, giving way to the person of affairs. "'Give
<em>us</em> five dollars'?" he said, in this capacity, and for
deeper effect he used a rhetorical expression: "Who do you think
is the owner of all this fish bait, may I ask you, pray?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you <em>may</em>, pray!" was his cousin's instant and supercilious
retort. "Pray where would you ever of got any five dollars from
any fish man, if it hadn't been for me, pray? Pray, didn't I first
sajest our doing somep'n with the bugs we'd never forget, and
if the fish man gives us five dollars for 'em won't we remember
it all our lives, pray? And, pray, what part did you think up
of all this, pray? Not one single thing, and if you don't divide
even with me, I'll run ahead and tell the fish man the whole c'lection
has been in bottles that had old medicine and poison in 'em&mdash;and
then where'll <em>you</em> be, pray?"</p>

<p>It is to be doubted that Florence possessed the cold-blooded
capacities with which this impromptu in diplomacy seemed to invest
her: probably she would never have gone so far. But the words
sufficed; and Herbert was so perfectly intimidated that he was
even unresentful. "Well, you can have your ole two dollars and
a half, whether you got a right to it or not," he said. "But you
got to carry the basket."</p>

<p>"No," said Florence. "This has got to be done right, Herbert.
We're partners now and everything's got to be divided just exackly
even. I'll carry the basket half the way and you carry it the
other half."</p>

<p>"Well&#11834;" he grumbled, consenting.</p>

<p>"That's the only right way," she said sunnily. "You carry it
till we get to the fish man's, and I'll carry it all the way back."</p>

<p>But even Herbert could perceive the inequality here. "It'll be
empty then," he protested.</p>

<p>"Fair's fair and wrong's wrong," she returned firmly. "I spoke
first to carry it on the way home, and the one that speaks first
gets it!"</p>

<p>"Look here!"</p>

<p>"Herbert, we got to get all these bugs fixed up and ready," she
urged. "We don't want to waste the whole afternoon just talkin'
about it, do we? Besides, Herbert, on the way home you'll have
two dollars and a half in your pocket, or anyway as much as you
have left, if you buy some soda and candy and things, and you'll
feel so fine then you won't mind whether you're carrying the basket
or not."</p>

<p>The picture she now suggested to Herbert's mind was of himself
carrying the basket both to the fish man and from the fish man:
and he found himself anxious to protest, yet helpless in a maze
of perplexity. "But wait a minute," he began. "You said&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Let's don't waste another minute," she interrupted briskly.
"I shouldn't wonder it was after four o'clock by this time, and
we both need money. Hurry, Herbert!"</p>

<p>"But didn't you say&#11834;" He paused to rub his head. "You said
I'd feel so good I wouldn't mind if <em>I&mdash;</em>if&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No. I said, 'Hurry'!"</p>

<p>"Well&#11834;" And though he felt that a subtle injustice lurked
somewhere, he was unable to think the matter out clearly into
its composing elements, and gave up trying. Nevertheless, as he
obeyed her, and began to "hurry," there remained with him an impression
that by some foggy and underhand process he had been committed
to acquiescence in an unfair division of labour.</p>

<p>In this he was not mistaken. An hour later he and Florence were
on their way home from the fish man's place of business, and Herbert,
having carried the basket thither, was now carrying it thence.
Moreover, his burden was precisely as heavy on this homeward leg
of the course as it had been on that terminating at the fish store,
for, covered by a discreet newspaper, the preserve and pickle
jars still remained within the basket, their crowding and indignant
contents intact. The fish man had explained in terms derisive,
but plain, the difference between a fish man and a fisherman.
He had maintained his definitions of the two economic functions
in spite of persistent arguments on the part of the bait-dealers,
and in the face of reductions that finally removed ninety per
cent. of their asking price. He wouldn't give fifty cents, or
ten cents, or one cent, he said: and he couldn't furnish the address
of anybody else that would. His fish came by express, he declared,
again and again: and the only people he knew that did any fishing
were mainly coloured, and dug their own bait; and though these
might possibly be willing to accept the angle worms as a gift,
they would probably incline to resent a generosity including so
many spiders, not to speak of the dangerous winged members of
the c'lection. On account of these latter, he jocosely professed
himself to be anxious lest the tops of some of the jars might
work loose&mdash;and altogether he was the most disheartening man they
had ever met.</p>

<p>Anticlimax was never the stimulant of amiability, and, after
an altercation on the pavement just outside of the store, during
which the derisive fish man continually called to them to go on
and take that there basket out of the neighbourhood, the cousins
moved morbidly away, and walked for a time in silence.</p>

<p>They brooded. Herbert was even more embittered with Florence
than he was with the fish man, and Florence found life full of
unexpectedness; it had been so clear to her that the fish man
would say: "Why, certainly. Here's five dollars; two dollars and
a half for each of you. Would you care to have the jars back?"
The facts, so contrary, seemed to wear the aspect of deliberate
malice, and she felt ill-used, especially as she had several physical
grievances, due to her assistance in pouring part of the c'lection
into the jars with tops. In spite of every precaution three or
four of the liveliest items had made their escape, during this
pouring, and had behaved resentfully. Florence bore one result
on the back of her left hand, two others on the thumb and second
finger of her right hand, and another, naturally the most conspicuous,
on the point of her chin. These had all been painful, in spite
of mud poultices, but, excited by the anticipation of a kindly
smiling fish man, and occupied with plans for getting Herbert
to spend part of his two dollars and a half for mutual refreshment,
she had borne up cheerfully. Now, comprehending that she had suffered
in vain, she suffered anew, and hated bugs, all fish men, and
the world.</p>

<p>It was Herbert who broke the silence and renewed the altercation.
"How far you expeck me to go on luggin' this ole basket?" he demanded
bitterly. "All the way home?"</p>

<p>"I don't care how far," she informed him. "You can throw it away
if you want to. It's certainly no propaty of mine, thank you!"</p>

<p>"Look here, didn't you promise you'd carry it home?"</p>

<p>"I said I <em>spoke</em> to. I didn't say I <em>would</em> carry
it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to know the dif&#11834;"</p>

<p>But Florence cut him off. "I'll tell you the difference, since
you're so anxious to know the truth, Mister Herbert Atwater! The
difference is just this: you had no biznuss to meddle with those
vile ole bugs in the first place, and get me all stung up so't
I shouldn't wonder I'd haf to have the doctor, time I get home,
and if I do I'm goin' to tell mamma all about it and make her
send the bill to your father. I want you to know I <em>hurt</em>!"</p>

<p>"My goodness!" Herbert burst out. "Don't you s'pose <em>I</em>
hurt any? I guess you don't hurt any worse than&#11834;"</p>

<p>She stopped him: "Listen!"</p>

<p>From down the street there came a brazen clamouring for the right
of way; it grew imperiously louder, and there were clatterings
and whizzings of metallic bodies at speed, while little blurs
and glistenings in the distance grew swiftly larger, taking shape
as a fire engine and a hose-cart. Then, round the near-by corner,
came perilously steering the long "hook-and-ladder wagon"; it
made the turn and went by, with its firemen imperturbable on the
running boards.</p>

<p>"Fire!" Florence cried joyfully. "Let's go!" And, pausing no
instant, she made off up the street, shouting at the top of her
voice: "<em>Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!</em>"</p>

<p>Herbert followed. He was not so swift a runner as she, though
this he never submitted to a test admitted to be fair and conclusive;
and he found her demonstration of superiority particularly offensive
now, as she called back over her shoulder: "Why don't you keep
up with me? Can't you keep up?"</p>

<p>"I'd <em>show</em> you!" he panted. "If I didn't haf to lug this
ole basket, I'd leave you a mile behind mighty quick."</p>

<p>"Well, why'n't you drop it, then?"</p>

<p>"You s'pose I'm goin' to throw my c'lection away after all the
trouble I been <em>through</em> with it?"</p>

<p>She slackened her gait, dropping back beside him. "Well, then,
if you think you could keep up with me if you didn't have it,
why'n't you leave it somewhere, and come back and get it after
the fire's over?"</p>

<p>"No place to leave it."</p>

<p>She laughed, and pointed. "Why'n't you leave it at grandpa's?"</p>

<p>"Will you wait for me and start fair?"</p>

<p>"Come on!" They obliqued across the street, still running forward,
and at their grandfather's gate Herbert turned in and sped toward
the house.</p>

<p>"Take it around to the kitchen and give it to Kitty Silver,"
Florence called. "Tell Kitty Silver to take care of it for you."</p>

<p>But Herbert was in no mind to follow her advice; a glance over
his shoulder showed that Florence was taking another unfair advantage
of him. "You wait!" he shouted. "You stand still till I get back
there! You got half a mile start a'ready! You wait till we can
start even!"</p>

<p>But Florence was skipping lightly away and she caroled over her
shoulder, waving her hand in mocking farewell as she began to
run:</p>

"Ole Mister Slowpoke can't catch me!<br/>

</p>

<p>"I'll show you!" he bellowed, and, not to lose more time, he
dashed up the steps of the deserted veranda, thrust his basket
deep underneath a wicker settee, and ran violently after his elusive
cousin.</p>

<p>She kept a tantalizing distance between them, but when they reached
the fire it was such a grand one they forgot all their differences&mdash;and
also all about the basket.</p>
