<p>The entrance to the common prison of Havana was a sort of lofty
tunnel, finished by great, iron-rusted, wooden gates. A civil
guard was exhibiting the judge's warrant for my committal to a
white-haired man, with a red face and blue eyes, that seemed to
look through tumbled bushes of silver eyebrows&mdash;the <em>alcayde</em>
of the prison. He bowed, and rattled two farcically large keys.
A practicable postern was ajar on the yellow wood of the studded
gates. It was as if it afforded a glimpse of the other side of
the world. The venerable turnkey, a gnome in a steeple-crowned
hat, protruded a blood-red hand backwards in the direction of
the postern.</p>

<p>"Señor Caballero," he croaked, "I pray you to consider this house
your own. My servants are yours."</p>

<p>Within was a gravel yard, shut in by portentous lead-white house-sides
with black window holes. Under each row of windows was a vast
vaulted tunnel, caged with iron bars, for all the world like beasts'
dens. It being day, the beasts were out and lounging about the
<em>patio</em>. They had an effect of infinite tranquillity, as
if they were ladies and gentlemen parading in a Sunday avenue.
Perhaps twenty of them, in snowy white shirts and black velvet
knee-breeches, strutted like pigeons in a knot, some with one
woman on the arm, some with two. Bundles of variegated rags lay
against the walls, as if they were sweepings. Well, they were
the sweepings of Havana jail. The men in white and black were
the great thieves... and there were children, too&mdash;the place was
the city orphanage. For the fifth part of a second my advent made
no difference. Then, at the far end, one of the men in black and
white separated himself, and came swiftly to me across the sunny
<em>patio</em>. The others followed slowly, with pea-fowl steps,
their women hanging to them and whispering. The bundles of rags
rose up towards me; others slunk furtively out of the barred dens.
The man who was approaching had the head of a Julius Cæsar of
fifty, for all the world as if he had stolen a bust and endowed
it with yellow skin and stubby gray and silver hair. He saluted
me with intense gravity and an imperial glance of yellow eyes
along a hooked nose. His linen was the most spotless broidered
and embossed stuff; îrom the crimson scarf round his waist protruded
the shagreen and silver handle of a long dagger. He said:</p>

<p>"Señor, I have the honour to salute you. I am Crisostomo Garcia.
I ask the courtesy of your trousers."</p>

<p>I did not answer him. I did not see what he wanted with my trousers,
which weren't anyway as valuable as his own. The others were closing
in on me like a solid wall. I leant back against the gate; I was
not frightened, but I was mightily excited. The man like Cæsar
looked fiercely at me, swayed a long way back on his haunches,
and imperiously motioned the crowd to recede.</p>

<p>"Señor Inglesito," he said, "the gift I have the honour to ask
of you is the price of my protection. Without it these, my brothers,
will tear you limb from limb, there will nothing of you remain."</p>

<p>His brothers set up a stealthy, sinister growl, that went round
among the heads like the mutter of an obscene echo among the mountain-tops.
I wondered whether this, perhaps, was the man who, O'Brien said,
would put a knife in my back. I hadn't any knife; I might knock
the fellow's teeth down his throat, though.</p>

<p>The <em>alcayde</em> thrust his immense hat, blood-red face,
and long, ragged, silver locks out of the little door. His features
were convulsed with indignation. He had been whispering with the
Civil Guard.</p>

<p>"Are you mad, gentlemen?" he said. "Do you wish to visit hell
before your times? Do you know who the senor is? Did you ever
hear of Carlos el Demonio? This is the <em>Inglesito</em> of Rio
Medio!"</p>

<p>It was plain that my deeds, such as they were, reported by O'Brien
spies, by the <em>Lugareños</em>, by all sorts of credulous gossipers,
had got me the devil of a reputation in the <em>patio</em> of
the jail. Men detached themselves from the crowd, and went running
about to announce my arrival. The <em>alcayde</em> drew his long
body into the <em>patio</em>, and turned to lock the little door
with an immense key. In the crowd all sorts of little movements
happened. Women crossed themselves, and furtively thrust pairs
of crooked, skinny, brown, black-nailed fingers in my direction.
The man like Cæsar said:</p>

<p>"I ask your pardon, Señor Caballero. I did not know. How could
I tell? You are free of all the <em>patios</em> in this land."</p>

<p>The tall <em>alcayde</em> finished grinding the immense key in
the lock, and touched me on the arm.</p>

<p>"If the senor will follow me," he said. "I will do the honours
of this humble mansion, and indicate a choice of rooms where he
may be free from the visits of these gentry."</p>

<p>We went up steps, and through long, shadowy corridors, with here
and there a dark, lounging figure, like a stag seen in the dim
aisles of a wood. The <em>alcayde</em> threw open a door.</p>

<p>The room was like a blazing oblong-box, filled with light, but
without window or chimney. Two men were fencing in the illumination
of some twenty candles stuck all round the mildewed white walls
on lumps of clay. There was a blaze of silver things, like an
altar of a wealthy church, from a black, carved table in the far
corner. The two men, in shirts and breeches, revolved round each
other, their rapiers clinking, their left arms scarved, holding
buttoned daggers. The <em>alcayde</em> proclaimed:</p>

<p>"Don Vincente Salazar, I have the honour to announce an English
senor."</p>

<p>The man with his face to me tossed his rapier impatiently into
a corner. He was a plump, dark Cuban, with a brooding truculence.
The other faced round quickly. His cheeks shone in the candle-light
like polished yellow leather, his eyes were narrow slits, his
face lugubrious. He scrutinized me intently, then drawled:</p>

<p>"My! You?... Hang me if I didn't think it would be you!"</p>

<p>He had the air of surveying a monstrosity, and pulled the neck
of his dirty print shirt open, panting. He slouched out into the
corridor, and began whispering eagerly to the <em>alcayde</em>.
The little Cuban glowered at me; I said I had the honour to salute
him.</p>

<p>He muttered something contemptuous between his teeth. Well, if
he didn't want to talk to me, I didn't want to talk to him. It
had struck me that the tall, sallow man was undoubtedly the second
mate of the <em>Thames</em>. Nicholas, the real Nikola el Escoces!
The Cuban grumbled suddenly:</p>

<p>"You, Señor, are without doubt one of the spies of that friend
of the priests, that O'Brien. Tell him to beware&mdash;that I bid him
beware. I, Don Vincente Salazar de Valdepefias y Forli y..."</p>

<p>I remembered the name; he was once the suitor of Seraphina&mdash;the
man O'Brien had put out of the way. He continued with a grotesque
frown of portentous significance:</p>

<p>"To-morrow I leave this place. And your compatriot is very much
afraid, Señor. Let him fear! Let him fear! But a thousand spies
should not save him."</p>

<p>The tall <em>alcayde</em> came hurriedly back and stood bowing
between us. He apologized abjectly to the Cuban for intruding
me upon him. But the room was the best in the place at the disposal
of the prisoners of the Juez O'Brien. And I was a noted <em>caballero</em>.
Heaven knows what I had not done in Rio Medio. Burnt, slain, ravished....
The Señor Juez was understood to be much incensed against me.
The gloomy Cuban at once rushed upon me, as if he would have taken
me into his arms.</p>

<p>"The <em>Inglesito</em> of Rio Medio!" he said. "Ha, ha! Much
have I heard of you. Much of the senor's valiance! Many tales!
That foul eater of the carrion of the priests wishes your life!
Ah, but let him beware! I shall save you, Señor &mdash;I, Don
Vincente Salazar."</p>

<p>He presented me with the room&mdash;a remarkably bare place but for
his properties: silver branch candlesticks, a silver chafing-dish
as large as a basin. They might have been chased by Cellini&mdash;one
used to find things like that in Cuba in those days, and Salazar
was the person to have them. Afterwards, at the time of the first
insurrection, his eight-mule harness was sold for four thousand
pounds in Paris&mdash;by reason of the gold and pearls upon it. The
atmosphere, he explained, was fetid, but his man was coming to
burn sandal-wood and beat the air with fans.</p>

<p>"And to-morrow!" he said, his eyes rolling. Suddenly he stopped.
"Señor," he said, "is it true that my venerated friend, my more
than father, has been murdered&mdash;at the instigation of that fiend?
Is it true that the senorita has disappeared? These tales are
told."</p>

<p>I said it was very true.</p>

<p>"They shall be avenged," he declared, "to-morrow! I shall seek
out the senorita. I shall find her. I shall find her! For me she
was destined by my venerable friend."</p>

<p>He snatched a black velvet jacket from the table and put it on.</p>

<p>"Afterwards, Señor, you shall relate. Have no fear. I shall save
you. I shall save all men oppressed by this scourge of the land.
For the moment afford me the opportunity to meditate." He crossed
his arms, and dropped his round head. "Alas, yes!" he meditated.</p>

<p>Suddenly he waved towards the door. "Señor," he said swiftly,
"I must have air; I stifle. Come with me to the corridor...."</p>

<p>He went towards the window giving on to the <em>patio</em>; he
stood in the shadow, his arms folded, his head hanging dejectedly.
At the moment it grew suddenly dark, as if a veil had been thrown
over a lamp. The sun had set outside the walls. A drum began to
beat. Down below in the obscurity the crowd separated into three
strings and moved slowly towards the barren tunnels. Under our
feet the white shirts disappeared; the ragged crowd gravitated
to the left; the small children strung into the square cage-door.
The drum beat again and the crowd hurried. Then there was a clang
of closing grilles and lights began to show behind the bars from
deep recesses. In a little time there was a repulsive hash of
heads and limbs to be seen under the arches vanishing a long way
within, and a little light washed across the gravel of the <em>patio</em>
from within.</p>

<p>"Señor," the Cuban said suddenly, "I will pronounce his panegyric.
He was a man of a great gentleness, of an inevitable nobility,
of an invariable courtesy. Where, in this degenerate age, shall
we find the like!" He stopped to breathe a sound of intense exasperation.</p>

<p>"When I think of these Irish,..." he said. "Of that O'Brien...." 
A servant was arranging the shining room that we had left. Salazar
interrupted himself to give some orders about a banquet, then
returned to me. "I tell you I am here for introducing my knife
to the spine of some sort of Madrid <em>embustero</em>, a man
who was insolent to my <em>amiga</em> Clara. Do you believe that
for that this O'Brien, by the influence of the priests whose soles
he licks with his tongue, has had me inclosed for many months?
Because he feared me! Aha! I was about to expose him to the noble
don who is now dead! I was about to wed the Señorita who has disappeared.
But to-morrow... I shall expose his intrigue to the Captain-General.
You, Señor, shall be my witness! I extend my protection to you...."
He crossed his arms and spoke with much deliberation. "Señor,
this Irishman incommodes me, Don Vincente Salazar de Valdepeñas
y Forli...." He nodded his head expressively. "Señor, we offered
these Irish the shelter of our robe for that your Government was
making martyrs of them who were good Christians, and it behoves
us to act in despite of your Government, who are heretics and
not to be tolerated upon God's Christian earth. But, Señor, if
they incommoded your Government as they do us, I do not wonder
that there was a desire to remove them. Señor, the life of that
man is not worth the price of eight mules, which is the price
I have paid for my release. I might walk free at this moment,
but it is not fitting that I should slink away under cover of
darkness. I shall go out in the daylight with my carriage. And
I will have an offering to show my friends who, like me, are incommoded
by this...." The man was a monomaniac; but it struck me that,
if I had been O'Brien, I should have felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p>In the dark of the corridor a long shape appeared, lounging.
The Cuban beside me started hospitably forward.</p>

<p>"<em>Vamos</em>," he said briskly; "to the banquet...." He waved
his hand towards the shining door and stood aside. We entered.</p>

<p>The other man was undoubtedly the Nova Scotian mate of the <em>Thames</em>,
the man who had dissuaded me from following Carlos on the day
we sailed into Kingston Harbour. He was chewing a toothpick, and
at the ruminant motion of his knife-jaws I seemed to see him,
sitting naked to the waist in his bunk, instead of upright there
in red trousers and a blue shirt&mdash;an immense lank-length of each.
I pieced his history together in a sort of flash. He was the true
Nikola el Escoces; his name was Nichols, and he came from Nova
Scotia. He had been the chief of O'Brien's <em>Lugareños</em>.
He surveyed me now with a twinkle in his eyes, his yellow jaws
as shiny-shaven as of old; his arms as much like a semaphore.
He said mockingly:</p>

<p>"So you went there, after all?"</p>

<p>But the Cuban was pressing us towards his banquet; there was
<em>gaspacho</em> in silver plates, and a man in livery holding
something in a napkin. It worried me. We surveyed each other in
silence. I wondered what Nichols knew; what it would be safe to
tell him; how much he could help me? One or other of these men
undoubtedly might. The Cuban was an imbecile; but he might have
some influence&mdash;and if he really were going out on the morrow,
and really did go to the Captain-General, he certainly could further
his own revenge on O'Brien by helping me.... But as for Nichols....</p>

<p>Salazar began to tell a long, exaggerated story about his cook,
whom he had imported from Paris.</p>

<p>"Think," he said; "I bring the fool two thousand miles&mdash;and then&mdash;not
even able to begin on a land-crab. A fool!"</p>

<p>The Nova Scotian cast an uninterested side glance at him, and
said in English, which Salazar did not understand:</p>

<p>"So you went there, after all? And now <em>he's</em> got you."
I did not answer him. "I know all about you," he added.</p>

<p>"It's more than I do about you," I said.</p>

<p>He rose and suddenly jerked the door open, peered on each side
of the corridor, and then sat down again.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid to tell," he said defiantly. "I'm not afraid
of anything. I'm safe."</p>

<p>The Cuban said to me in Spanish: "This senor is my friend. Everyone
who hates that devil is my friend."</p>

<p>"I'm safe," Nichols repeated. "I know too much about our friend
the raparee." He lowered his voice. "They say you're to be given
up for piracy, eh?" His eyes had an extraordinarily anxious leer.
"You are now, eh? For how much? Can't you tell a man? We're in
the same boat! I kin help you!"</p>

<p>Salazar accidentally knocked a silver goblet off the table and,
at the sound, Nichols sprang half off his chair. He glared in
a wild stare around him then grasped at a flagon of <em>aguardiente</em>
and drank.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of any damn thing" he said. "I've got a hold
on that man. He dursen't give me up. I kin see! He's going to
give you up and say you're responsible for it all."</p>

<p>"I don't know what he's going to do," I answered.</p>

<p>"Will you not, Señor," Salazar said suddenly, "relate, if you
can without distress, the heroic death of that venerated man?"</p>

<p>I glanced involuntarily at Nichols. "The distress," I said, "would
be very great. I was Don Balthasar's kinsman. The Señor O'Brien
had a great fear of my influence in the Casa. It was in trying
to take me away that Don Balthasar, who defended me, was slain
by the <em>Lugareños</em> of O'Brien."</p>

<p>Salazar said, "Aha! Aha! We are kindred spirits. Hated and loved
by the same souls. This fiend, Señor. And then...."</p>

<p>"I escaped by sea&mdash;in an open boat, in the confusion. When I
reached Havana, the <em>Juez</em> had me arrested."</p>

<p>Salazar raised both hands; his gestures, made for large, grave
men, were comic in him. They reduced Spanish manners to absurdity.
He said:</p>

<p>"That man dies. That man dies. To-morrow I go to the Captain-General.
He shall hear this story of yours, Señor. He shall know of these
machinations which bring honest men to this place. We are a band
of brothers...."</p>

<p>"That's what I say." Nichols leered at me. "We're all in the
same boat."</p>

<p>I expect he noticed that I wasn't moved by his declaration. He
said, still in English:</p>

<p>"Let us be open. Let's have a council of war. This O'Brien hates
me because I wouldn't fire on my own countrymen." He glanced furtively
at me. "I wouldn't," he asserted; "he wanted me to fire into their
boats; but I wouldn't. Don't you believe the tales they tell about
me! They tell worse about you. Who says I would fire on my countrymen?
Where's the man who says it?" He had been drinking more brandy
and glared ferociously at me. "None of your tricks, my hearty,"
he said. "None of your getting out and spreading tales. O'Brien's
my friend; he'll never give me up. He dursen't. I know too much.
You're a pirate! No doubt it was you who fired into them boats.
By God I'll be witness against you if they give me up. I'll show
you up."</p>

<p>All the while the little Cuban talked swiftly and with a saturnine
enthusiasm. He passed the wine rapidly.</p>

<p>"My own countrymen!" Nichols shouted. "Never! I shot a Yankee
lieutenant &mdash;Allen he was&mdash;with my own hand. That's another
thing. I'm not a man to trifle with. No, sir. Don't you try it....
Why, I've papers that would hang O'Brien. I sent them home to
Halifax. I know a trick worth his. By God, let him try it! Let
him only try it. He dursen't give me up...."</p>

<p>The man in livery came in to snuff the candles. Nichols sprang
from his seat in a panic and drew his knife with frantic haste.
He continued, glaring at me from the wall, the knife in his hand:</p>

<p>"Don't you dream of tricks. I've cut more throats than you've
kissed gals in your little life."</p>

<p>Salazar himself drew an immense pointed knife with a shagreen
hilt. He kissed it rapturously.</p>

<p>"Aha!... Aha!" he said, "bear this kiss into his ribs at the
back." His eyes glistened with this mania. "I swear it; when I
next see this dog; this friend of the priests." He threw the knife
on the table. "Look," he said, "was ever steel truer or more thirsty?"</p>

<p>"Don't you make no mistake," Nichols continued to me. "Don't
you think to presume. O'Brien's my friend. I'm here snug and out
of the way of the old fool of an admiral. That's why he's kept
waiting off the Morro. When he goes, I walk out free. Don't you
try to frighten me. I'm not a man to be frightened."</p>

<p>Salazar bubbled: "Ah, but now the wine flows and is red. We are
a band of brothers, each loving the other. Brothers, let us drink."</p>

<p>The air of close confinement, the blaze, the feel of the jail,
pressed upon me, and I felt sore, suddenly, at having eaten and
drunk with those two. The idea of Seraphina, asleep perhaps, crying
perhaps, something pure and distant and very blissful, came in
upon me irresistibly.</p>

<p>The little Cuban said, "We have had a very delightful conversation.
It is very plain this O'Brien must die."</p>

<p>I rose to my feet. "Gentlemen," I said in Spanish, "I am very
weary; I will go and sleep in the corridor."</p>

<p>The Cuban sprang towards me with an immense anxiety of hospitableness.
I was to sleep on his couch, the couch of cloth of gold. It was
impossible, it was insulting, that I should think of sleeping
in the corridor. He thrust me gently down upon it, making with
his plump hands the motions of smoothing it to receive me. I lay
down and turned my face to the wall.</p>

<p>It wasn't possible to sleep, even though the little Cuban, with
a tender solicitude, went round the walls blowing out the candles.
He might be useful to me, might really explain matters to the
Captain-General, or might even, as a last resource, take a letter
from me to the British Consul. But I should have to be alone with
him. Nichols was an abominable scoundrel; bloodthirsty to the
defenceless; a liar; craven before the ghost of a threat. No doubt
O'Brien did not want to give him up. Perhaps he <em>had</em> papers.
And no doubt, once he could find a trace of Seraphina's whereabouts,
O'Brien would give me up. All I could do was to hope for a gain
of time. And yet, if I gained time, it could only mean that I
should in the end be given up to the admiral.</p>

<p>And Seraphina's whereabouts. It came over me lamentably that
I myself did not know. The <em>Lion</em> might have sailed. It
was possible. She might be at sea. Then, perhaps, my only chance
of ever seeing her again lay in my being given up to the admiral,
to stand in England a trial, perhaps for piracy, perhaps for treason.
I might meet her only in England, after many years of imprisonment.
It wasn't possible. I would not believe in the possibility. How
I loved her! How wildly, how irrationally&mdash;this woman of another
race, of another world, bound to me by sufferings together, by
joys together. Irrationally! Looking at the matter now, the reason
is plain enough. Before then I had not lived. I had only waited&mdash;for
her and for what she stood for. It was in my blood, in my race,
in my tradition, in my training. We, all of us for generations,
had made for efficiency, for drill, for restraint. Our Romance
was just this very Spanish contrast, this obliquity of vision,
this slight tilt of the convex mirror that shaped the same world
so differently to onlookers at different points of its circle.</p>

<p>I could feel a little of it even then, when there was only the
merest chance of my going back to England and getting back towards
our old position on the rim of the mirror. The deviousness, the
wayward passion, even the sempiternal abuses of the land were
already beginning to take the aspect of something like quaint
impotence. It was charm that, now I was on the road away, was
becoming apparent. The inconveniences of life, the physical discomforts,
the smells of streets, the heat, dropped into the background.
I felt that I did not want to go away, irrevocably from a land
sanctioned by her presence, her young life. I turned uneasily
to the other side. At the heavy black table, in the light of a
single candle, the Cuban and the Nova Scotian were discussing,
their heads close together.</p>

<p>"I tell you no," Nichols was saying in a fluent, abominable,
literal translation into Spanish. "Take the knife so... thumb
upwards. Stab down in the soft between the neck and the shoulder-blade.
You get right into the lungs with the point. I've tried it: ten
times. Never stick the back. The chances are he moves, and you
hit a bone. There are no bones there. It's the way they kill pigs
in New Jersey."</p>

<p>The Cuban bent his brows as if he were reflecting over a chessboard.
"Ma...." he pondered. His knife was lying on the table. He unsheathed
it, then got up, and moved behind the seated Nova Scotian.</p>

<p>"You say... there?" he asked, pressing his little finger at the
base of Nichols' skinny column of a neck. "And then..." He measured
the length of the knife on Nichols's back twice with elaborate
care, breathing through his nostrils. Then he said with a convinced,
musing air, "It is true. It would go down into the lungs."</p>

<p>"And there are arteries and things," Nichols said.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," the Cuban answered, sheathing the knife and thrusting
it into his belt.</p>

<p>"With a knife that length it's perfect." Nichols waved his shadowy
hand towards Salazar's scarf. Salazar moved off a little.</p>

<p>"I see the advantages," he said. "No crying out, because of the
blood in the lungs. I thank yous Señor Escoces."</p>

<p>Nichols rose, lurching to his full height, and looked in my direction.
I closed my eyes. I did not wish him to talk to me. I heard him
say:</p>

<p>"Well, <em>hasta mas ver</em>. I shall get away from here. Good-night."</p>

<p>He swayed an immense shadow through the door. Salazar took the
candle and followed him into the corridor.</p>

<p>Yes, that was it, why she was so great a part, a whole wall,
a whole beam of my life's house. I saw her suddenly in the blackness,
her full red lips, her quivering nostrils, the curve of her breasts,
her lithe movements from the hips, the way she set her feet down,
the white flower waxen in the darkness of her hair, and the robin-wing
flutter of her lids over her gray eyes when she smiled. I moved
convulsively in my intense desire. I would have given my soul,
my share of eternity, my honour, only to see that flutter of the
lids over the shining gray eyes. I never felt I was beneath the
imponderable pressure of a prison's wall till then. She was infinite
miles away; I could not even imagine what inanimate things surrounded
her. She must be talking to someone else; fluttering her lids
like that. I recognized with a physical agony that was more than
jealousy how slight was my hold upon her. It was not in her race,
in her blood as in mine, to love me and my type. She had lived
all her life in the middle of Romance, and the very fire and passion
of her South must make me dim prose to her. I remember the flicker
of Salazar's returning candle, cast in lines like an advancing
scythe across the two walls from the corridor. I slept.</p>

<p>I had the feeling of appalled horror suddenly invading my sleep;
a vast voice seemed to be exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Tell me where she is!"</p>

<p>I looked at the glowing horn of a lanthorn. It was O'Brien who
held it. He stood over me, very sombre.</p>

<p>"Tell me where she is," he said, the moment my eyes opened.</p>

<p>I said, "She's... she's&mdash;-&mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p>It appalls me even now to think how narrow was my escape. It
was only because I had gone to sleep in the thought that I did
not know, that I answered that I did not know. Ah&mdash;he was a cunning
devil! To suddenly wake one; to get one's thoughts before one
had had time to think! I lay looking at him, shivering. I couldn't
even see much of his face.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" he said again. "Where? Dead? Dead? God have mercy
on your soul if the child is dead!"</p>

<p>I was still trembling. If I had told him! &mdash;I could hardly
believe I had not. He continued bending over me with an attitude
that hideously mocked solicitude.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" he asked again.</p>

<p>"Ransack the island," I said. He glared at me, lifting the lamp.
"The whole earth, if you like."</p>

<p>He ground his teeth, bending very low over me; then stood up,
raising his head into the shadow above the lamp.</p>

<p>"What do I care for all the admirals?" he was speaking to himself.
"No ship shall leave Havana till...." He groaned. I heard him
slap his forehead, and say distractedly, "But perhaps she is not
in a ship."</p>

<p>There was a silence in which I heard him breathe heavily, and
then he amazed me by saying:</p>

<p>"Have pity."</p>

<p>I laughed, lying on my back. "On you!"</p>

<p>He bent down. "Fool! on yourself."</p>

<p>A vast and towering shadow ran along the wall.</p>

<p>There wasn't a sound. The face of Salazar appeared behind him,
and an uplifted hand grasping a knife. O'Brien saw the horror
in my eyes. I gasped to him: "Look...." and before he could move
the knife went softly home between neck and shoulder. Salazar
glided to the door and turned to wave his hand at me. O'Brien's
lips were pressed tightly together, the handle of the knife was
against his ear, the lanthorn hung at the end of his rigid arm
for a moment. As he lowered it, the blood spurted from his shoulder
as if from a burst stand-pipe, only black and warm. It fell over
my face, over my hands, everywhere. For a minute of eternity his
agonized eyes searched my features, as if to discern whether I
had connived, whether I condoned.</p>

<p>I had started up, my face coming right against his. I felt an
immense horror. What did it mean? What had he done? He had been
such a power for so long, so inevitably, over my whole life that
I could not even begin to understand that this was not some new
subtle villainy of his. He shook his head slowly, his ear disturbing
the knife.</p>

<p>Then he turned jerkily on his heel, the lanthorn swinging round
and leaving me in his shadow. There were ten paces to reach the
door. It was like the finish of a race whether he would cover
the remaining seven after the first three steps. The dangling
lanthorn shed small patches of light through the holes in the
metal top, like sunlight through leaves, upon the gloom of the
remote ceiling. At the fifth step he pressed his hand spasmodically
to his mouth; at the sixth he wavered to one side. I made a sudden
motion as if to save him from falling. He was dying! He was dying!
I hardly realized what it meant. This immense weight was being
removed from me. I had no need to fear him any more. I couldn't
understand, I could only look. This was his passing. This....</p>

<p>He sank, knelt down, placing the Ian thorn on the floor. He covered
his face with his hands and began to cough incessantly, like a
man dying of consumption. The glowing top of the lanthorn hissed
and sputtered out in little sharp blows, like hammer strokes...
Carlos had coughed like that. Carlos was dead. Now O'Brien! He
was going. I should escape. It was all over. Was it all over?
He bowed stiffly forward, placing his hands on the stones, then
lay over on his side with his face to the light, his eyes glaring
at it. I sat motionless, watching him. The lanthorn lit the carved
leg of the black table and a dusty circle of the flags. The spurts
of blood from his shoulder grew less long in answer to the pulsing
of his heart; his fists unclenched, he drew his legs up to his
body, then sank down. His eyes looked suddenly at mine and, as
the features slowly relaxed, the smile seemed to come back, enigmatic,
round his mouth.</p>

<p>He was dead; he was gone; I was free! He would never know where
she was; never! He had gone, with the question on his lips; with
the agony of uncertainty in his eyes. From the door came an immense,
grotesque, and horrible chuckle.</p>

<p>"Aha!-Aha! I have saved you, Señor, I have protected you. We
are as brothers."</p>

<p>Against the tenuous blue light of the dawn Salazar was gesticulating
in the doorway. I felt a sudden repulsion; a feeling of intense
disgust. O'Brien lying there, I almost wished alive again &mdash;I
wanted to have him again, rather than that I should have been
relieved of him by that atrocious murder. I sat looking at both
of them.</p>

<p>Saved! By that lunatic? I suddenly appreciated the agony of mind
that alone could have brought O'Brien, the cautious, the all-seeing,
into this place&mdash;. to ask me a question that for him was answered
now. Answered for him more than for me.</p>

<p>Where was Seraphina? Where? How should I come to her? O'Brien
was dead. And <em>I.... </em>Could I walk out of this place and
go to her? O'Brien was dead. But I...</p>

<p>I suddenly realized that now I was the pirate Nikola el Escoces&mdash;that
now he was no more there, nothing could save me from being handed
over to the admiral. Nothing.</p>

<p>Salazar outside the door began to call boastfully towards the
sound of approaching footsteps.'</p>

<p>"Aha! Aha! Come all of you! See what I have done! Come, Señor
Alcayde! Come, brave soldiers..."</p>

<p>In that way died this man whose passion had for so long hung
over my life like a shadow. Looking at the matter now, I am, perhaps,
glad that he fell neither by my hand nor in my quarrel. I assuredly
had injured him the first; I had come upon his ground; I had thwarted
him; I had been a heavy weight at a time when his fortunes had
been failing. Failing they undoubtedly were. He had run his course
too far.</p>

<p>And, if his death removed him out of my path, the legacy of his
intrigue caused me suffering enough. Had he lived, there is no
knowing what he might have done. He was bound to deliver someone
to the British&mdash;either myself or Nichols. Perhaps, at the last
moment, he would have kept me in Havana. There is no saying.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly he had not wished to deliver Nichols; either because
he really knew too much or because he had scruples. Nichols had
certainly been faithful to him. And, with his fine irony, it was
delightful to him to think that I should die a felon's death in
England. For those reasons he had identified me with Nikola el
Escoces, intending to give up whichever suited him at the last
moment.</p>

<p>Now that was settled for him and for me. The delivery was to
take place at dawn, and O'Brien not to be found, the old Judge
of the First Instance had been sent to identify the prisoner.
He selected me, whom, of course, he recognized. There was no question
of Nichols, who had been imprisoned on a charge of theft trumped
up by O'Brien.</p>

<p>Salazar, whether he would have gone to the Captain-General or
not, was now entirely useless. He was retained to answer the charge
of murder. And to any protestations I could make, the old <em>Juez</em>
was entirely deaf.</p>

<p>"The senor must make representations to his own authorities,"
he said. "I have warrant for what I have done."</p>

<p>It was impossible to expose O'Brien to him. The soldiers of the
escort, in the dawn before the prison gates, simply laughed at
me.</p>

<p>They marched me down through the gray mists, to the water's edge.
Two soldiers held my arms; O'Brien's blood was drying on my face
and on my clothes. I was, even to myself, a miserable object.
Among the négresses on the slimy boat-steps a thick, short man
was asking questions. He opened amazed eyes at the sight of me.
It was Williams&mdash;the <em>Lion</em> was not yet gone then. If he
spoke to me, or gave token of connection with Seraphina, the Spaniards
would understand. They would take her from him certainly; perhaps
immure her in a convent. And now that I was bound irrevocably
for England, she must go, too. He was shouldering his way towards
my guards.</p>

<p>"Silence!" I shouted, without looking at him. "Go away, make
sail.... Tell Sebright...."</p>

<p>My guards seemed to think I had gone mad; they laid hands upon
me. I didn't struggle, and we passed down towards the landing
steps, brushing Williams aside. He stood perturbedly gazing after
me; then I saw him asking questions of a civil guard. A man-of-war's
boat, the ensign trailing in the glassy water, the glazed hats
of the seamen bobbing like clockwork, was flying towards us. Here
was England! Here was home! I should have to clear myself of felony,
to strain every nerve and cheat the gallows. If only Williams
understood, if only he did not make a fool of himself. I couldn't
see him any more; a jabbering crowd all round us was being kept
at a distance by the muskets of the soldiers. My only chance was
Sebright's intelligence. He might prevent Williams making a fool
of himself. The commander of the guard said to the lieutenant
from the flagship, who had landed, attended by the master-at-arms:</p>

<p>"I have the honour to deliver to your worship's custody the prisoner
promised to his excellency the English admiral. Here are the papers
disclosing his crimes to the justice. I beg for a receipt."</p>

<p>A shabby <em>escrivano</em> from the prison advanced bowing,
with an inkhorn, shaking a wet goose-quill. A <em>guardia civil</em>
offered his back. The lieutenant signed a paper hastily, then
looking hard at me, gave the order:</p>

<p>"Master-at-arms, handcuff one of the prisoner's hands to your
own wrist. He is a desperate character."</p>
