<p>Portlaw's camp in the southern foot-hills of the Adirondacks
was as much a real camp as the pretentious constructions at Newport
are real cottages. A modesty, akin to smugness, designates them
all with Heep-like humbleness under a nomenclature now tolerated
through usage; and, from the photographs sent him, Hamil was very
much disgusted to find a big, handsome two-story house, solidly
constructed of timber and native stone, dominating a clearing
in the woods, and distantly flanked by the superintendent's pretty
cottage, the guides' quarters, stables, kennels, coach-houses,
and hothouses with various auxiliary buildings still farther away
within the sombre circle of the surrounding pines.</p>

<p>To this aggravation of elaborate structures Portlaw, in a spasm
of modesty, had given the name of "Camp Chickadee"; and now he
wanted to stultify the remainder of his domain with concrete terraces,
bridges, lodges, and Gothic towers in various and pleasing stages
of ruin.</p>

<p>So Hamil's problem presented itself as one of those annoyingly
simple ones, entirely dependent upon Portlaw and good taste; and
Portlaw had none.</p>

<p>He had, however, some thirty thousand acres of woods and streams
and lakes fenced in with a twelve-foot barrier of cattle-proof
wire&mdash;partly a noble virgin wilderness unmarred by man-trails;
partly composed of lovely second growth scarcely scarred by that,
vile spoor which is the price Nature pays for the white-hided
invaders who walk erect, when not too drunk, and who foul and
smear and stain and desolate water and earth and air around them.</p>

<p>Why Portlaw desired to cut his wilderness into a mincing replica
of some emasculated British royal forest nobody seemed able to
explain. While at Palm Beach he had made two sage observations
to Hamil concerning the sacredness of trees; one was that there
are no trees in a Scotch deer forest, which proved to his satisfaction
that trees are unnecessary; the other embodied his memories of
seeing a herd of calf-like fallow deer decorating the grass under
the handsome oaks and beeches of some British nobleman's park.</p>

<p>Why Portlaw concerned himself at all with his wild, out-world
domain was a mystery, too; for he admitted that he spent almost
all day playing cards indoors or contriving with his cook some
new and succulent experiment in the gastronomical field.</p>

<p>Sometimes he cast a leaden eye outdoors when his dogs were exercised
from the kennel; rarely, and always unwillingly, he followed Malcourt
to the hatchery to watch the stripping, or to the exotic pheasantry
to inspect the breeding of birds entirely out of place in such
a climate.</p>

<p>He did like to see a fat deer; the fatter the better; he was
accustomed, too, to poke his thumb into the dead plumage of a
plump grouse when Malcourt's men laid out the braces, on which
he himself never drew trigger; and which interested him only when
on the table.</p>

<p>He wanted plenty of game and fish on the place for that reason;
he wanted his guests to shoot and fish for that reason, too. Otherwise
he cared nothing for his deer, his grouse, and his trout. And
why he suddenly had been bitten with a mania for "improving" the
flawless wilderness about him, even Malcourt did not know.</p>

<p>Hamil, therefore, was prepared for a simple yet difficult problem&mdash;to
do as little harm to the place as possible, and to appease Portlaw
at the same time, and curb his meddlesome and iconoclastic proclivities.</p>

<p>Spring had begun early in the North; shallow snows were fading
from the black forest soil along the streams' edges, and from
the pebbled shores of every little lake; already the soft ice
was afloat on pool and pond; muskrats swam; the eggs of the woodcock
were beginning their chilly incubation; and in one sheltered spring-hole
behind the greenhouse Malcourt discovered a solemn frog afloat.
It takes only a single frog to make the spring-time.</p>

<p>That week the trailing fragrance of arbutus hung over wet hollows
along the hills; and at night, high in the starlight, the thrilling
clangour of wild geese rang out&mdash;the truest sky-music of the North
among all the magic folk-songs of the wild.</p>

<p>The anchor-ice let go and went out early, and a few pioneer trout
jumped that week; the cock-grouse, magnificent in his exquisite
puffed ruff, paced the black-wet drumming log, and the hollow
woodlands throbbed all day with his fairy drumming.</p>

<p>On hard-wood ridges every sugar-bush ran sap; the aroma from
fire and kettle sweetened the air; a few battered, hibernating
butterflies crawled out of cracks and crannies and sat on the
sap-pans sunning their scarlet-banded wings.</p>

<p>And out of the hot South into the fading silver of this chill
Northern forest-world came Hamil, sunburned, sombre-eyed, silent.</p>

<p>Malcourt met him at Pride's Fall with a buckboard and a pair
of half-broken little Morgans; and away they tore into the woods,
scrambling uphill, plunging downhill, running away most of the
time to the secret satisfaction of Malcourt, who cared particularly
for what was unsafe in life.</p>

<p>He looked sideways at Hamil once or twice, and, a trifle disappointed
that the pace seemed to suit him, let the little horses out.</p>

<p>"Bad thing to meet a logging team," he observed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hamil absently. So Malcourt let the horses run away
when they cared to; they needed it and he enjoyed it. Besides
there were never any logging teams on that road.</p>

<p>Malcourt inquired politely concerning the Villa Cardross and
its occupants; Hamil answered in generalities.</p>

<p>"You've finished there, then!"</p>

<p>"Practically. I may go down in the autumn to look it over once
more."</p>

<p>"Is Cardross going to put in the Schwarzwald pigs?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they're ordered."</p>

<p>"Portlaw wants some here. I'd give ten dollars, poor as I am,
if I could get Portlaw out in the snow and fully occupied with
an irritated boar."</p>

<p>"Under such circumstances one goes up a tree?" inquired Hamil,
smiling.</p>

<p>"One does if one is not too fat and can shed snowshoes fast enough.
Otherwise one keeps on shooting one's 45-70. By the way, you were
in New York for a day or two. How's the market?"</p>

<p>"Sagging."</p>

<p>"Money?"</p>

<p>"Scarce. I saw Mr. Cardross and Acton Carrick. Nobody seems enthusiastic
over the prospect. While there are no loans being called there
are few being made. I heard rumours of course; a number of banks
and trust companies are getting themselves whispered about. Outside
of that I don't know, Malcourt, because I haven't much money and
what I have is on deposit with the Shoshone Securities Company
pending a chance for some safe and attractive investment."</p>

<p>"That's Cardross, Carrick &amp; Co."</p>

<p>"Yes." And as they whirled into the clearing and the big, handsome
house came into view he smiled: "Is this Camp Chickadee?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and yonder's my cottage on Luckless Lake&mdash;a nice name,"
added Malcourt, "but Portlaw says it's safer to leave the name
as it stands than to provoke the gods with boastful optimism by
changing it to Lucky Lake. Oh, it's a gay region; Lake Desolation
lies just beyond that spur; Lake Eternity east of us; Little Scalp
Lake west&mdash;a fine bunch of names for a landscape in hell; but
Portlaw won't change them. West and south the wet bones of the
Sacandaga lie; and south-east you're up against the Great Vlaie
and Frenchman's Creek and Sir William's remains from Guy Park
on the Mohawk to the Fish House and all that bally Revolutionary
tommy-rot." And as he blandly drew in his horses beside the porch:
"Look who's here! Who but our rotund friend and lover of all things
fat, lord of the manor of Chickadee-dee-dee which he has taught
the neighbouring dicky-birds, who sit around the house, to repeat
aloud in honour of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Louis! How are you, Hamil?" grunted Portlaw,
extending a heavily cushioned, highly coloured hand of welcome.</p>

<p>Hamil and Malcourt descended; a groom blanketed the horses and
took them to the stables; and Portlaw, with a large gesture of
impatient hospitality, led the way into a great, warm living-room,
snug, deeply and softly padded, and in which the fragrance of
burning birch-logs and simmering toddy blended agreeably in the
sunshine.</p>

<p>"For luncheon," began Portlaw with animation, "we're going to
try a new sauce on that pair of black ducks they brought in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In violation of the laws of game and decency," observed Malcourt,
shedding his fur coat and unstrapping the mail-satchel from Pride's
Fall.</p>

<p>"<em>Shut</em> up, Louis! Can't a man eat the things that come
into his own property?" And he continued unfolding to Hamil his
luncheon programme while, with a silver toddy-stick, heirloom
from bibulous generations of Portlaws, he stirred the steaming
concoction which, he explained, had been constructed after the
great Sir William's own receipt.</p>

<p>"You've never tried a Molly Brant toddy? Man alive, you've wasted
your youth," he insisted, genuinely grieved. "Well, wise men,
chiefs, and sachems, here's more hair on your scalp-locks, and
a fat buck to every bow!"</p>

<p>Malcourt picked up his glass. "<em>Choh</em>" he said maliciously;
but Portlaw did not understand the irony in the Seminole salutation
of The Black Drink; and the impudent toast was swallowed without
suspicion.</p>

<p>Then Hamil's luggage arrived, and he went away to inspect his
quarters, prepare for luncheon, and exchange his attire for forest
dress. For he meant to lose no time in the waste corners of the
earth when Gotham town might any day suddenly bloom like Eden
with the one young blossom that he loved.</p>

<p>There was not much for him in Eden now&mdash;little enough except
to be in her vicinity, near her at times, at intervals with her
long enough to exchange a word or two under the smooth mask of
convention which leaves even the eyes brightly expressionless.</p>

<p>Never again to touch her hand save under the formal laws sanctioned
by usage; never again to wake with the intimate fragrance of her
memory on his lips; never again to wait for the scented dusk to
give them to each other&mdash;to hear her frail gown's rustle on the
terrace, her footfall in the midnight corridor, her far, sweet
hail to him from the surf, her soft laughter under the roses on
the moon-lit balcony.</p>

<p>That&mdash;all of it&mdash;was forever ended. But he believed that the
pallid northern phantom of the past was still left to him; supposed
that now, at least, they might miserably consider themselves beyond
peril.</p>

<p>But what man supposes of woman is vain imagining; and in that
shadowy neutral ground which lies between martyrdom and sin no
maid dwells for very long before she crosses one frontier or the
other.</p>

<p>When he descended the stairs once more he found Portlaw, surrounded
by the contents of the mail-sack, and in a very bad temper, while
Malcourt stood warming his back at the blazing birch-logs, and
gazing rather stupidly at a folded telegram in his hands.</p>

<p>"Well, Hamil&mdash;damn it all! What do you think of that!" demanded
Portlaw, turning to Hamil as he entered the room; and unheeding
Malcourt's instinctive gesture of caution which he gave, not comprehending
why he gave it, Portlaw went on, fairly pouting out his irritation:</p>

<p>"In that bally mail-sack which Louis brought in from Pride's
Fall there's a telegram from your friend, Neville Cardross; and
why the devil he wants Louis to come to New York on the jump&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have a small balance at the Shoshone Trust," said Malcourt.
"Do you suppose there's anything queer about the company?"</p>

<p>Hamil shook his head, looking curiously at Malcourt.</p>

<p>"Well, what on earth do you think Cardross wants with you?" demanded
Portlaw. "Read that telegram again."</p>

<p>Again Malcourt's instinct seemed to warn him to silence. All
the same, with a glance at Hamil, he unfolded the bit of yellow
paper and read:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>LOUIS MALCOURT,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</em>Superintendent Luckless Lake,<br/>

</p>
</div>
<p>   "Your presence is required at my office in the Shoshone

importance. Telegraph what train you can catch. Mr. Carrick will   
meet you on the train at Albany.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>NEVILLE CARDROSS.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</em>Answer Paid."

</p>
</div>
<p>"Well, what the devil does it mean?" demanded Portlaw peevishly.
"I can't spare you now. How can I? Here's Hamil all ready for
you to take him about and show him what I want to have done&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wonder what it means," mused Malcourt. "Maybe there's something
wrong with the Tressilvain end of the family. The Shoshone Securities
people manage her investments here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The way to do is to wire and find out," grumbled Portlaw, leading
the way to the luncheon table as a servant announced that function.</p>

<p>For it was certainly a function with Portlaw; all eating was
more or less of a ceremony, and dinner rose to the dignity of
a rite.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what that telegram&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget it!" snapped Portlaw; "do you want to infect my luncheon?
When a man lunches he ought to give his entire mind to it. Talk
about your lost arts!&mdash;the art of eating scarcely survives at
all. Find it again and you revive that other lost art of prandial
conversation. Digestion's not possible without conversation. Hamil,
you look at your claret in a funny way."</p>

<p>"I was admiring the colour where the sun strikes through," said
the latter, amused.</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought you were remembering that claret is temporarily
unfashionable. That's part of the degeneracy of the times. There
never was and never will be any wine to equal it when it has the
body of a Burgundy and the bouquet of wild-grape blossoms. Louis,"
cocking his heavy red face and considering a morsel of duck, "what
is your opinion concerning the proper mélange for that plumcot
salad dressing?"</p>

<p>"They say," said Malcourt gravely, "that when it's mixed, a current
of electricity passed through it gives it a most astonishing flavour&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"So they say at the Stuyvesant Club."</p>

<p>Portlaw's eyes bulged; Hamil had to bend his head low over his
plate, but Malcourt's bland impudence remained unperturbed.</p>

<p>"Good God!" muttered Portlaw; "Hamil, did you ever hear of passing
electricity through a salad dressing composed of olive oil, astragon,
Arequipa pepper, salt, Samara mustard, essence of anchovy, chives,
distilled fresh mushrooms, truffles pickled in 1840 port&mdash;<em>did</em>
you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Hamil, "I never did."</p>

<p>For a while silence settled upon the table while Portlaw struggled
to digest mentally the gastronomic suggestion offered by Malcourt.</p>

<p>"I could send to town for a battery," he said hesitatingly; "or&mdash;there's
my own electric plant&mdash;"</p>

<p>Malcourt yawned. There was not much fun in exploiting such a
man. Besides, Hamil had turned uncomfortable, evidently considering
it the worst of taste on Malcourt's part.</p>

<p>"What am I to do about that telegram?" he asked, lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>Portlaw, immersed in sauce and the electrical problem, adjusted
his mind with an effort to this other and less amusing question.</p>

<p>"Wire for particulars and sit tight," advised Portlaw. "We've
just three now for 'Preference,' and if you go kiting off to town
Hamil and I will be forced into double dummy, and that's a horrible
mental strain on a man&mdash;isn't it, Hamil?"</p>

<p>"I <em>could</em> use the long-distance telephone," said Malcourt
pensively.</p>

<p>"Well, for the love of Mike go and do it!" shouted Portlaw, "and
let me try to enjoy this Andelys cheese."</p>

<p>So Malcourt sauntered out through the billiard-room, leaving
an aromatic trail of cigarette smoke in his wake; and he closed
all the intervening doors&mdash;why, he himself could not have explained.</p>

<p>He was absent a long time. Portlaw had terminated the table ceremony,
and now, ensconced among a dozen fat cushions by the fire, a plump
cigar burning fragrantly between his curiously clean-cut and sharply
chiselled lips, he sat enthroned, majestically digesting; and
his face of a Greek hero, marred by heavy flesh, had become almost
somnolent in its expression of well-being and corporeal contentment.</p>

<p>"I don't know what I'd do without Louis," he said sleepily. "He
keeps my men hustling, he answers for everything on the bally
place, he's so infernally clever that he amuses me and my guests,
he's on the job every minute. It would be devilishly unpleasant
for me if I lost him.... And I'm always afraid of it.... There
are usually a lot of receptive girls making large eyes at him....
My only safety is that they are so many&mdash;and so easy.... If Cardross
hadn't signed that telegram I'd bet my <em>bottes-sauvage</em>
it concerned some entanglement."</p>

<p>Hamil lay back in his chair and studied the forest through the
leaded casement. Sometimes he thought of Portlaw's perverse determination
to spoil the magnificent simplicity of the place with exotic effects
lugged in by the ears; sometimes he wondered what Mr. Cardross
could have to say to Malcourt&mdash;what matter of such urgent importance
could possibly concern those two men.</p>

<p>And, thinking, he thought of Shiela&mdash;and of their last moments
together; thought of her as he had left her, crouched there on
her knees beside the bed, her face and head buried in her crossed
arms.</p>

<p>Portlaw was nodding drowsily over his cigar; the April sunshine
streamed into the room through every leaded pane, inlaying the
floor with glowing diamonds; dogs barked from the distant kennels;
cocks were crowing from the farm. Outside the window he saw how
the lilac's dully varnished buds had swollen and where the prophecy
of snow-drop and crocus under the buckthorn hedge might be fulfilled
on the morrow. Already over the green-brown, soaking grass one
or two pioneer grackle were walking busily about; and somewhere
in a near tree the first robin chirked and chirped and fussed
in its loud and familiar fashion, only partly pleased to find
himself in the gray thaw of the scarcely comfortable North once
more.</p>

<p>Portlaw looked up dully: "Those robins come up here and fatten
on our fruit, and a fool law forbids us to shoot 'em. Robin pie,"
he added, "is not to be despised, but a sentimental legislature
is the limit.... Sentiment always did bore me.... How do you feel
after your luncheon?"</p>

<p>"All right," said Hamil, smiling. "I'd like to start out as soon
as Malcourt comes back."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't begin that sort of thing the moment you get here!"
protested Portlaw. "My heavens, man! there's no hurry. Can't you
smoke a cigar and play a card or two&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know I've other commissions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course; but I hoped you'd have time to take it easy.
I've looked forward to having you here&mdash;so has Malcourt; he thinks
you're about right, you know. And he makes damn few friends among
men&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened and Malcourt entered slowly, almost noiselessly.
There was not a vestige of colour in his face, nor of expression
as he crossed the room for a match and relighted his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired Portlaw, "did you get Cardross on the wire?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Malcourt stood motionless, hands in his pockets, the cigarette
smoke curling up blue in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"I've got to go," he said.</p>

<p>"What for?" demanded Portlaw, then sulkily begged pardon and
pouted his dissatisfaction in silence.</p>

<p>"When do you go, Malcourt?" asked Hamil, still wondering.</p>

<p>"Now." He lifted his head but looked across at Portlaw. "I've
telephoned the stable, and called up Pride's Fall to flag the
five-thirty express," he said.</p>

<p>Portlaw was growing madder and madder.</p>

<p>"Would you mind telling me when you expect to be back?" he inquired
ill-temperedly.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet."</p>

<p>"Don't know!" burst out Portlaw; "hell's bells!"</p>

<p>Malcourt shook his head.</p>

<p>Portlaw profanely requested information as to how the place was
to be kept going. Malcourt was patient with him to the verge of
indifference.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to blow up about. Hastings is competent to manage
things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That conceited pup!"</p>

<p>"Hastings understands," repeated Malcourt, in a listless voice.
"I've always counted on Alexander Hastings for any emergency.
He knows things, and he's capable.... Only don't be brusque. He
doesn't understand you as I do ... and he's fully your equal&mdash;fully&mdash;in
every way&mdash;and then some&mdash;" The weariness in his tone was close
to a sneer; he dropped his cigarette into the fire and began to
roll another.</p>

<p>"Louis," said Portlaw, frightened.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"What the devil is the meaning of all this? You <em>are</em>
coming back, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Malcourt continued to roll his cigarette, but after a while he
spoiled it and began to construct another.</p>

<p>"<em>Are</em> you, Louis?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Coming back here&mdash;soon?"</p>

<p>"If <em>I&mdash;</em>if it's the thing to do. I don't know yet. You
mustn't press the matter now."</p>

<p>"You think there's a chance that you won't come back at <em>all</em>!"
exclaimed Portlaw, aghast.</p>

<p>Malcourt's cigarette fell to pieces in his fingers.</p>

<p>"I'll come if I can, Billy. I tell you to let me alone.... I
don't know where I am coming out&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"If it's money you need, you know perfectly well&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Malcourt shook his head. From the moment of his entrance
he had kept his face carefully averted from Hamil's view; had
neither looked at him nor spoken except in monosyllabic answer
to a single question.</p>

<p>The rattle of the buckboard on the wet gravel drive brought Portlaw
to his feet. A servant appeared with Malcourt's suit-case and
overcoat.</p>

<p>"There's a trunk to follow; Williams is to pack what I need....
Good-bye, Billy. I wouldn't go if I didn't have to."</p>

<p>Portlaw took his offered hand as though dazed.</p>

<p>"You'll come back, of course," he said, "in a couple of days&mdash;or
a week if you like&mdash;but you'll be back, of course. You know if
there's anything the matter with your salary just say so. I always
meant you should feel perfectly free to fix your salary to suit
yourself. Only be sure to come back in a week, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Malcourt in a low voice. "I'd like to talk to
Hamil&mdash;if he can give me a few moments."</p>

<p>Bareheaded, Hamil stepped out into the clear, crisp, April sunshine
where the buckboard stood on the gravel.</p>

<p>The strong outdoor light emphasized Malcourt's excessive pallor,
and the hand he offered Hamil was icy. Then his nervous grasp
relaxed; he drew on his dog-pelt driving gloves and buttoned the
fur coat to the throat.</p>

<p>"I want you&mdash;to&mdash;to remember&mdash;remember that I always liked you,"
he said with an effort, in curious contrast to his habitual fluency.
"You won't believe it&mdash;some day. But it is true.... Perhaps I'll
prove it, yet.... My father used to say that everything except
death had been proven; and there remained, therefore, only one
event of any sporting interest to the world.... He was a very
interesting man&mdash;my father. He did not believe in death.... And
I do not.... This sloughing off of the material integument seems
to me purely a matter of the mechanical routine of evolution,
a natural process in further and inevitable development, not a
finality to individualism!... Fertilisation, gestation, the hatching,
growth, the episodic deliverance from encasing matter which is
called death, seem to me only the first few basic steps in the
sequences of an endless metamorphosis.... My father thought so.
His was a very fine mind&mdash;<em>is</em> a finer mind still.... Will
you understand me if I say that we often communicate with each
other&mdash;my father and I?"</p>

<p>"Communicate?" repeated Hamil.</p>

<p>"Often."</p>

<p>Hamil said slowly: "I don't think I understand."</p>

<p>Malcourt looked at him, the ever-latent mockery flickering in
his eyes; then, by degrees, his head bent forward in the old half-cunning,
half-wistful attitude as though listening. A vague smile touched
the pallor of his face, and he presently looked up with something
of his old debonair impudence.</p>

<p>"The truly good are always so interested in creating hell for
the wicked," he said, "that sometimes the good get into the pit
themselves just to see how hot it really is. And find the wicked
have never been there.... Hamil, the hopelessly wicked&mdash;and there
are few of them who are not mentally irresponsible&mdash;never go to
hell because they wouldn't mind it if they did. It's the good
who are hell's architects and often its tenants.... I'm speaking
of all prisoners of conscience. The wicked have none."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"There's always an exit from one of these temporary little pits
of torment," he said; "when one finds it too oppressive in the
shade.... When one obtains a proper perspective, and retains one's
sense of humour, and enough of conscience to understand the crime
of losing time.... And when, in correct perspective, one realises
the fictitious value of that temporary phase called the human
unit, and when one cuts free from the absurd dogma concerning
the dignity and the sanctity of that human unit.... I'm keeping
you from your cigar and arm-chair and from Portlaw.... A good,
kindly gossip, who fed my belly and filled my purse and loved
me for the cards I played. I'm a yellow pup to mock him. I'm a
pup anyhow.... But, Hamil, there is, in the worst pup, one streak
not all yellow. And the very worst are capable of one friendship.
You may not believe this some day. But it is true.... Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Is there anything, Malcourt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing you can do for me. Perhaps something I can do for you&mdash;"
And, laughing, "I'll consult my father; he's not very definite
on that point yet."</p>

<p>So Malcourt swung aboard the wagon, nodded again to Hamil, waved
a pleasant adieu to Portlaw at the window, and was gone in a shower
of wet gravel and mud.</p>

<p>And all that day Portlaw fussed and fumed and pouted about the
house, tormenting Hamil with questions and speculations concerning
the going of Malcourt, which for a while struck Hamil merely as
selfish ebullitions; but later it came to him by degrees that
this rich, selfish, over-fed, over-pampered, and revoltingly idle
landowner, whose sole mental and physical resources were confined
to the dinner and card tables, had been capable of a genuine friendship
for Malcourt. Self-centred, cautious to the verge of meanness
in everything which did not directly concern his own comfort and
well-being, he, nevertheless, was totally dependent upon his friends
for a full enjoyment of his two amusements; for he hated to dine
alone and he loathed solitaire.</p>

<p>Therefore, in spending money to make his house and grounds attractive
to his friends, he was ministering, as always, to himself; and
when he first took Malcourt for his superintendent he did so from
purely selfish motives and at a beggarly stipend.</p>

<p>And now, in the two years of his official tenure, Malcourt already
completely dominated him, often bullied him, criticised him to
his face, betrayed no illusions concerning the absolute self-interest
which dictated Portlaw's policy in all things, coolly fixed and
regulated all salaries, including his own, and, in short, matched
Portlaw's undisguised selfishness with a cynicism so sparkling
and so frankly ruthless that Portlaw gradually formed for him
a real attachment.</p>

<p>There was no indiscriminate generosity in that attachment; he
never voluntarily increased Malcourt's salary or decreased his
responsibilities; he got out of his superintendent every bit of
labour and every bit of amusement he could at the lowest price
Malcourt would take; yet, in spite of that he really cared for
Malcourt; he secretly admired his intellectual equipment; feared
it, too; and the younger man's capacity for dissipation made him
an invaluable companion when Portlaw emerged from his camp in
November and waddled forth upon his annual hunt for happiness.</p>

<p>Something of this Hamil learned through the indiscriminate volubility
of his host who, when his feelings had been injured, was amusingly
naive for such a self-centred person.</p>

<p>"That damn Louis," he confided to Hamil over their after-dinner
cigars, "has kept me guessing ever since he took command here.
Half the time I don't understand what he's talking about even
when I know he's making fun of me; but, Hamil, you have no idea
how I miss him."</p>

<p>And on another occasion a week later, while laboriously poring
over some rough plans laid out for him by Hamil:</p>

<p>"Louis agrees with you about this improvement business. He's
dead against my building Rhine-castle ruins on the crags, and
he had the impudence to inform me that I had a cheap mind. By
God, Hamil, I can't see anything cheap in trying to spend a quarter
of a million in decorating this infernal monotony of trees; can
you?"</p>

<p>And Hamil, for the first time in many a day, lay back in his
arm-chair and laughed with all his heart.</p>

<p>He had hard work in weaning Portlaw from his Rhine castles, for
the other invariably met his objections by quoting in awful German:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Hast du das Schloss gesehen&mdash;<br/>
Das hohe Schloss am Meer?"

</p>
</div>
<p>&mdash;pronounced precisely as though the words were English. Which
laudable effort toward intellectual and artistic uplift Hamil
never laughed at; and there ensued always the most astonishing
<em>causerie</em> concerning art that two men in a wilderness
ever engaged in.</p>

<p>Young Hastings, a Yale academic and forestry graduate, did fairly
well in Malcourt's place, and was doing better every day. For
one thing he knew much more about practical forestry and the fish
and game problems than did Malcourt, who was a better organiser
than executive.</p>

<p>He began by dumping out into a worthless and landlocked bass-pond
every brown trout in the hatchery. He then drew off the water
in the brown-trout ponds, sent in men with seines and shotguns,
and finally, with dynamite, purged the free waters of the brown
danger for good and all.</p>

<p>"When Malcourt comes back," observed Portlaw, "you'll have to
answer for all this."</p>

<p>"I won't be questioned," said Hastings, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh! And what do you propose to do next?"</p>

<p>"If I had the money you think of spending on ruined castles "&mdash;very
respectfully&mdash;"I'd build a wall in place of that mesh-wire fence."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Portlaw.</p>

<p>"The wire deceives the grouse when they come driving headlong
through the woods. My men pick up dozens of dead grouse and woodcock
along the fence. If it were a wall they'd go over it. As it is,
if I had my way, I'd restock with Western ruffed-grouse; cut out
that pheasantry altogether, and try to breed our own native game-bird&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! You can't breed ruffed-grouse in captivity!"</p>

<p>"I've done it, sir," said young Hastings modestly.</p>

<p>That night, over the plans, Portlaw voiced his distrust of Hastings
and mourned aloud for Malcourt.</p>

<p>"That infernal Louis," he complained, waving his fat cigar, "hasn't
written one line to me in a week! What the deuce is he doing down
there in town? I won't stand it! The ice is out and Wayward and
Cuyp and Vetchen are coming up for the fishing; and Mrs. Ascott,
perhaps, is coming, and Miss Palliser, and, I hope, Miss Suydam;
that makes our eight for Bridge, you see, with you and me. If
Louis were here I'd have three others&mdash;but I can't ask anybody
else until I know."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll get a telegram when the buckboard returns from
Pride's Fall," said Hamil quietly. He, too, had been waiting for
a letter that had not come. Days were lengthening into weeks since
his departure from the South; and the letter he taught himself
to expect had never come.</p>

<p>That she would write sooner or later he had dared believe at
first; and then, as day after day passed, belief faded into hope;
and now the colours of hope were fading into the gray tension
of suspense.</p>

<p>He had written her every day, cheerful, amusing letters of current
commonplaces which now made up his life. In them was not one hint
of love&mdash;no echo of former intimacy, nothing of sadness, or regret,
only a friendly sequence of messages, of inquiries, of details
recounting the events of the days as they dawned and faded through
the silvery promise of spring in the chill of the Northern hills.</p>

<p>Every morning and evening the fleet little Morgans came tearing
in from Pride's Fall with the big leather mail-bag, which bore
Portlaw's initials in metal, bulging with letters, newspapers,
magazines for Portlaw; and now and then a slim envelope for him
from his aunt, or letters, bearing the Palm Beach post-mark, from
contractors on the Cardross estate, or from his own superintendent.
But that was all.</p>

<p>His days were passed afoot in the forested hills, along lonely
little lakes, following dashing trout-brooks or studying the United
States Geological Survey maps which were not always accurate in
minor details of contour, and sometimes made a mockery of the
lesser water-courses, involving him and his surveyors in endless
complications.</p>

<p>Sometimes, toward evening, if the weather was mild, he and Portlaw
took their rods for a cast on Painted Creek&mdash;a noble trout stream
which took its name from the dropping autumn glory of the sugar-bush
where the water passed close to the house. There lithe, wild trout
struck tigerishly at the flies and fought like demons, boring
Portlaw intensely, who preferred to haul in a prospective dinner
without waste of energy, and be about the matter of a new sauce
with his cook.</p>
