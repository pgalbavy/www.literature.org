<P>
SHARON'S news was not of an encouraging character. He had met
with serious difficulties, and had spent the last farthing of
Moody's money in attempting to overcome them.
<P>
One discovery of importance he had certainly made. A horse
withdrawn from the sale was the only horse that had met with
Hardyman's approval. He had secured the animal at the high
reserved price of twelve thousand francs--being four hundred and
eighty pounds in English money; and he had paid with an English
bank-note. The seller (a French horse-dealer resident in
Brussels) had returned to Belgium immediately on completing the
negotiations. Sharon had ascertained his address, and had written
to him at Brussels, inclosing the number of the lost banknote. In
two days he had received an answer, informing him that the
horse-dealer had been called to England by the illness of a
relative, and that he had hitherto failed to send any address to
which his letters could be forwarded. Hearing this, and having
exhausted his funds, Sharon had returned to London. It now rested
with Moody to decide whether the course of the inquiry should
follow the horse-dealer next. Here was the cash account, showing
how the money had been spent. And there was Sharon, with his pipe
in his mouth and his dog on his lap, waiting for orders.
<P>
Moody wisely took time to consider before he committed himself to
a decision. In the meanwhile, he ventured to recommend a new
course of proceeding which Sharon's report had suggested to his
mind.
<P>
"It seems to me," he said, "that we have taken the roundabout way
of getting to our end in view, when the straight road lay before
us. If Mr. Hardyman has passed the stolen note, you know, as well
as I do, that he has passed it innocently. Instead of wasting
time and money in trying to trace a stranger, why not tell Mr.
Hardyman what has happened, and ask him to give us the number of
the note? You can't think of everything, I know; but it does seem
strange that this idea didn't occur to you before you went to
France."
<P>
"Mr. Moody," said Old Sharon, "I shall have to cut your
acquaintance. You are a man without faith; I don't like you. As
if I hadn't thought of Hardyman weeks since!" he exclaimed
contemptuously. "Are you really soft enough to suppose that a
gentleman in his position would talk about his money affairs to
me? You know mighty little of him if you do. A fortnight since I
sent one of my men (most respectably dressed) to hang about his
farm, and see what information he could pick up. My man became
painfully acquainted with the toe of a boot. It was thick, sir;
and it was Hardyman's."
<P>
"I will run the risk of the boot," Moody replied, in his quiet
way.
<P>
"And put the question to Hardyman?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Very good," said Sharon. "If you get your answer from his
tongue, instead of his boot, the case is cleared up--unless I
have made a complete mess of it. Look here, Moody! If you want to
do me a good turn, tell the lawyer that the guinea-opinion was
the right one. Let him know that _he_ was the fool, not you, when
he buttoned up his pockets and refused to trust me. And, I say,"
pursued Old Sharon, relapsing into his customary impudence,
"you're in love, you know, with that nice girl. I like her
myself. When you marry her invite me to the wedding. I'll make a
sacrifice; I'll brush my hair and wash my face in honor of the
occasion."
<P>
Returning to his lodgings, Moody found two letters waiting on the
table. One of them bore the South Morden postmark. He opened that
letter first.
<P>
It was written by Miss Pink. The first lines contained an urgent
entreaty to keep the circumstances connected with the loss of the
five hundred pounds the strictest secret from everyone in
general, and from Hardyman in particular. The reasons assigned
for making the strange request were next expressed in these
terms: "My niece Isabel is, I am happy to inform you, engaged to
be married to Mr. Hardyman. If the slightest hint reached him of
her having been associated, no matter how cruelly and unjustly,
with a suspicion of theft, the marriage would be broken off, and
the result to herself and to everybody connected with her, would
be disgrace for the rest of our lives."
<P>
On the blank space at the foot of the page a few words were added
in Isabel's writing: "Whatever changes there may be in my life,
your place in my heart is one that no other person can fill: it
is the place of my dearest friend. Pray write and d tell me that
you are not distressed and not angry. My one anxiety is that you
should remember what I have always told you about the state of my
own feelings. My one wish is that you will still let me love you
and value you, as I might have loved and valued a brother."
<P>
The letter dropped from Moody's hand. Not a word--not even a
sigh--passed his lips. In tearless silence he submitted to the
pang that wrung him. In tearless silence he contemplated the
wreck of his life.
