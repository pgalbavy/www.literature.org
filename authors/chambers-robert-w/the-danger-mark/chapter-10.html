<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The Masked Dance was to begin at ten that evening; for that reason
dinner had been served early at scores of small tables on the
terrace, a hilarious and topsy-turvy, but somewhat rapid affair,
because everybody required time for dressing, and already throughout
the house maids and valets were scurrying around, unpacking masks
and wigs and dainty costumes for the adorning of the guests at
Roya-Neh.</p>

<p>Toward nine o'clock the bustle and confusion became distracting;
corridors were haunted by graceful flitting figures in various
stages of deshabille, in quest of paraphernalia feminine and maids
to adjust the same. A continual chatter filled the halls, punctuated
by smothered laughter and subdued but insistent appeals for aid
in the devious complications of intimate attire.</p>

<p>On the men's side of the house there was less hubbub and some
quiet swearing; much splashing in tubs, much cigarette smoke.
Men entered each other's rooms, half-clad in satin breeches, silk
stockings, and ruffled shirts, asking a helping hand in tying
queue ribbons or adjusting stocks, and lingered to smoke and jest
and gossip, and jeer at one another's finery, or to listen to
the town news from those week-enders recently arrived from the
city.</p>

<p>The talk was money, summer shows, and club gossip, but financial
rumours ruled.</p>

<p>Young Ellis, in pale blue silk and wig, perched airily, on a
table, became gloomily prophetic concerning the steady retirement
of capital from philanthropic enterprises hatched in Wall Street;
Peter Tappan saw in the endlessly sagging market dire disaster
for the future digestions of wealthy owners of undistributed securities.</p>

<p>"Marble columns and gold ceilings don't make a trust company,"
he sneered. "There are a few billionaire gamblers from the West
who seem to think Wall Street is Coney Island. There'll be a shindy,
don't make any mistake; we're going to have one hell of a time;
but when it's over the corpses will all be shipped&mdash;ahem!&mdash;west."</p>

<p>Several men laughed uneasily; one or two old line trust companies
were mentioned; then somebody spoke of the Minnisink, lately taken
over by the Algonquin.</p>

<p>Duane lighted a cigarette and, watching the match still burning,
said:</p>

<p>"Dysart is a director. You can't ask for any more conservative
citizen than Dysart, can you?"</p>

<p>Several men looked around for Dysart, but he had stepped out
of the room.</p>

<p>Ellis said, after a silence:</p>

<p>"That gambling outfit from the West has bedevilled one or two
good citizens in Gotham town."</p>

<p>Dr. Bailey shrugged his big, fat shoulders.</p>

<p>"It's no secret, I suppose, that the Minnisink crowd is being
talked about," he grunted.</p>

<p>Ellis said in a low but perfectly distinct voice:</p>

<p>"Neither is it any secret that Jack Dysart has been hit hard
in National Ice."</p>

<p>Peter Tappan slipped from his seat on the table and threw away
his cigarette:</p>

<p>"One thing is sure as soubrettes," he observed; "the Clearing
House means to get rid of certain false prophets. The game law
is off prophets&mdash;in the fall. There'll be some good gunning&mdash;under
the laws of New Jersey."</p>

<p>"I hope they'll be careful not to injure any marble columns or
ruin the gold-leaf on the ceilings," sneered Ellis. "Come on,
some of you fellows, and fix the buckle in this cursed stock of
mine."</p>

<p>"I thought fixing stocks was rather in your own line," said Duane
to the foxy-visaged and celebrated manipulator, who joined very
heartily in the general and unscrupulous laugh.</p>

<p>A moment later, Dysart, who had heard every word from the doorway,
walked silently back to his own room and sat down, resting his
temples between his closed fists.</p>

<p>The well-cut head was already silvery gray at the temples; one
month had done it. When animated, his features still appeared
firm and of good colour; relaxed, they were loose and pallid,
and around the mouth fine lines appeared. Often a man's hands
indicate his age, and his betrayed him, giving the lie to his
lithe, straight, graceful figure. The man had aged amazingly in
a month or two.</p>

<p>Matters were not going very well with him. For one thing, the
Half-Moon Trust Company had finally terminated all dealings with
the gorgeous marble-pillared temple of high finance of which he
was a director. For another, he had met the men of the West, and
for them he had done things which he did not always care to think
about. For another, money was becoming disturbingly scarce, and
the time was already past for selling securities.</p>

<p>During the last year he had been vaguely aware of some occult
hostility to himself and his enterprises&mdash;not the normal hostility
of business aggression&mdash;but something indefinable&mdash;merely negative
at first, then more disturbing, sinister, foreboding; something
in the very air to which he was growing more sensitive every day.</p>

<p>By all laws of finance, by all signs and omens, a serious reaction
from the saturnalia of the last few years was already over-due.
He had felt it, without alarm at first, for the men of the West
laughed him to scorn and refused to shorten sail. They still refused.
Perhaps they could not. One thing was certain: he could scarcely
manage to take in a single reef on his own account. He was beginning
to realise that the men with whom rumour was busy were men marked
down by their letters; and they either would not or could not
aid him in shortening sail.</p>

<p>For a month, now, under his bland and graceful learning among
the intimates of his set, Dysart had been slowly but steadily
going to pieces. At such moments as this it showed on the surface.
It showed now in his loose jaw and flaccid cheeks; in the stare
of the quenched eyes.</p>

<p>He was going to pieces, and he was aware of it. For one thing,
he recognised the physical change setting in; for another, his
cool, selfish, self-centred equanimity was being broken down;
the rigorous bodily régime from which he had never heretofore
swerved and which alone enabled him to perform the exacting social
duties expected of him, he had recently neglected. He felt the
impending bodily demoralisation, the threatened mental disintegration;
he suspected its symptoms in a new nervous irritability, in lapses
of self-command, in unaccountable excesses utterly foreign to
his habitual self-control.</p>

<p>Dissolute heretofore only in the negative form, whatever it was
that impended threatening him, seemed also to be driving him into
an utter and monstrous lack of caution, and &mdash;God alone knew
how&mdash;he had at last done the one thing that he never dreamed of
doing. And the knowledge of it, and the fear of it, bit deeper
into his shallow soul every hour of the day and night. And over
all, vague, indefinite, hung something that menaced all that he
cared for most on earth, held most sacred&mdash;his social position
in the Borough of Manhattan and his father's pride in him and
it.</p>

<p>After a while he stood up in his pale blue silken costume of
that mincing, smirking century which valued a straight back and
a well-turned leg, and very slowly, as though tired, he walked
to the door separating his wife's dressing-room from his own.</p>

<p>"May I come in?" he asked.</p>

<p>A maid opened the door, saying that Mrs. Dysart had gone to Miss
Quest's room to have her hair powdered. He seated himself; the
maid retired.</p>

<p>For a while he sat there, absently playing with his gilt-hilted
sword, sombre-eyed, preoccupied, listening to the distant joyous
tumult in the house, until quick, light steps and a breezy flurry
of satin at the door announced his wife's return.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said coolly; "you?"</p>

<p>That was her greeting; his was a briefer nod.</p>

<p>She went to her mirror and studied her face, trying a patch here,
a hint of vermilion there, touching up brow and lashes and the
sweet, curling corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>"Well?" she inquired, over her shoulder, insolently.</p>

<p>He got up out of the chair, shut the door, and returned to his
seat again.</p>

<p>"Have you made up your mind about the <em>D</em> and <em>P</em>
securities?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I told you I'd let you know when I came to any conclusion,"
she replied drily.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what you said, Rosalie. But the time is shortening.
I've got to meet certain awkward obligations&#11834;"</p>

<p>"So you intimated before."</p>

<p>He nodded and went on amiably: "All I ask of you is to deposit
those securities with us for a few months. They are as safe with
us as they are with the Half-Moon. Do you think I'd let you do
it if I were not certain?"</p>

<p>She turned and scrutinised him insultingly:</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, "how many kinds of treachery you are
capable of."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What I say. Frankly, I don't know what you are capable of doing
with my money. If I can judge by what you've done with my married
life, I scarcely feel inclined to confide in you financially."</p>

<p>"There is no use in going over that again," he said patiently.
"We differ little from ordinary people, I fancy. I think our house
is as united as the usual New York domicile. The main thing is
to keep it so. And in a time of some slight apprehension and financial
uneasiness&mdash;perhaps even of possible future stress&mdash;you and I,
for our own sakes, should stand firmly together to weather any
possible gale."</p>

<p>"I think I am able to weather whatever I am responsible for,"
she said. "If you do the same, we can get on as well as we ever
have."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you understand," he persisted, forcing a patient
smile. "All business in the world is conducted upon borrowed capital.
I merely&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you need more capital?" she inquired, so bluntly that he
winced.</p>

<p>"Yes, for a few months. I may require a little additional collateral&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Why don't you borrow it, then?"</p>

<p>"There is no necessity if you will temporarily transfer&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Can</em> you borrow it? Or is the ice in your trust company
too rotten to stand the strain?"</p>

<p>He flushed darkly and the temper began to escape in his voice:</p>

<p>"Has anybody hinted that I couldn't? Have you been discussing
my personal business affairs with any of the pups whom you drag
about at your heels? No matter what your personal attitude toward
me may be, only a fool would undermine the very house that&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I don't believe you understand, Jack," she said quietly; "I
care absolutely nothing about your house."</p>

<p>"Well, you care about your own social status, I suppose!" he
retorted sharply.</p>

<p>"Not very much."</p>

<p>"That's an imbecile thing to say!"</p>

<p>"Is it?" She turned to the mirror and touched her powdered hair
lightly with both hands, and continued speaking with her back
turned toward him:</p>

<p>"I married you for love. Remember that. There was even something
of it alive in the roots, I think, until within a few days&mdash;in
spite of what you are, what you have done to me. Now the thing
is dead. I can tell you when it died, if you like."</p>

<p>And as he said nothing:</p>

<p>"It died when I came in late one evening, and, passing my corridor
and a certain locked door, I heard a young girl sobbing. Then
it died."</p>

<p>She turned on him, contemptuously indifferent, and surveyed him
at her leisure:</p>

<p>"Your conduct to me has been such as to deliberately incite me
to evil. Your attitude has been a constant occult force, driving
me toward it. By the life you have led, and compelled me to lead,
you have virtually set a premium upon my infidelity. What you
may have done, I don't know; what you have done, even recently,
I am not sure of. But I know this: you took my life and made a
parody of it. I never lived; I have been tempted to. If the opportunity
comes, I will."</p>

<p>Dysart rose, his face red and distorted:</p>

<p>"I thought young Mallett had taught you to live pretty rapidly!"
he said.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "you only thought other people thought so.
That is why you resented it. Your jealousy is of that sort&mdash;you
don't care what I am, but you do care what the world thinks I
am. And that is all there ever was to you&mdash;all there ever will
be: desperate devotion to your wretched little social status,
which includes sufficient money and a chaste wife to make it secure."</p>

<p>She laughed; fastened a gardenia in her hair:</p>

<p>"I don't know about your money, and I don't care. As for your
wife, she will remain chaste as long as it suits her, and not
one fraction of a second longer."</p>

<p>"Are you crazy?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Why, it does seem crazy to you, I suppose&mdash;that a woman should
have no regard for the sacredness of your social status. I have
no regard for it. As for your honour"&mdash;she laughed unpleasantly&mdash;"I've
never had it to guard, Jack. And I'll be responsible for my own,
and the tarnishing of it. I think that is all I have to say."</p>

<p>She walked leisurely toward the door, passing him with a civil
nod of dismissal, and left him standing there in his flower-embroidered
court-dress, the electric light shining full on the thin gray
hair at his temples.</p>

<p>In the corridor she met Naïda, charming in her blossom-embroidered
panniers; and she took both her hands and kissed her, saying:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you won't care to have me caress you some day, so I'll
take this opportunity, dear. Where is your brother?"</p>

<p>"Duane is dressing," she said. "What did you mean by my not wishing
to kiss you some day?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, silly." And she passed on, turned to the right, and
met Sylvia Quest, looking very frail and delicate in her bath-robe
and powdered hair. The girl passed her with the same timid, almost
embarrassed little inclination with which she now invariably greeted
her, and Rosalie turned and caught her, turning her around with
a laugh. "What is the matter, dear?"</p>

<p>"M-matter?" stammered Sylvia, trembling under the reaction.</p>

<p>"Yes. You are not very friendly, and I've always liked you. Have
I offended you, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>She was looking smilingly straight into the blue eyes.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh, no!" said the girl hastily. "How can you think that,
Mrs. Dysart?"</p>

<p>"Then I don't think it," replied Rosalie, laughing. "You are
a trifle pale, dear. Touch up your lips a bit. It's very Louis
<em>XVI. </em>See mine?... Will you kiss me, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>Again a strange look flickered in the girl's eyes; Rosalie kissed
her gently; she had turned very white.</p>

<p>"What is your costume?" asked Mrs. Dysart.</p>

<p>"Flame colour and gold."</p>

<p>"Hell's own combination, dear," laughed Rosalie. "You will make
an exquisite little demon shepherdess."</p>

<p>And she went on, smiling back at the girl in friendly fashion,
then turned and lightly descended the stairway, snapping on her
loup-mask before the jolly crowd below could identify her.</p>

<p>Masked figures here and there detained her, addressing her in
disguised voices, but she eluded them, slipped through the throngs
on terrace and lawn, ran down the western slope and entered the
rose-garden. A man in mask and violet-gray court costume rose
from a marble seat under the pergola and advanced toward her,
the palm of his left hand carelessly balanced on his gilded hilt.</p>

<p>"So you did get my note, Duane?" she said, laying her pretty
hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"I certainly did. What can I do for you, Rosalie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Shall we sit here a moment?"</p>

<p>He laughed, but continued standing after she was seated.</p>

<p>The air was heavy with the scent of rockets and phlox and ragged
pinks and candy-tuft. Through the sweet-scented dusky silence
some small and very wakeful bird was trilling. Great misty-winged
moths came whirring and hovering among the blossoms, pale blurs
in the darkness, and everywhere the drifting lamps of fireflies
lighted and died out against the foliage.</p>

<p>The woman beside him sat with masked head bent and slightly turned
from him; her restless hands worried her fan; her satin-shod feet
were crossed and recrossed.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Life. It's all so very wrong."</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, smiling, "so it's life that is amiss, not we!"</p>

<p>"I suppose we are.... I suppose I am. But, Duane"&mdash;she turned
and looked at him&mdash;"I haven't had much of a chance yet&mdash;to go
very right or very wrong."</p>

<p>"You've had chances enough for the latter," he said with an unpleasant
laugh. "In this sweet coterie we inhabit, there's always that
chance."</p>

<p>"There are good women in it, good wives. Your sister is in it."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I mean to take her out," said Duane grimly. "Do you
think I want Naïda to marry some money-fattened pup in this set?"</p>

<p>"Where can you take her?"</p>

<p>"Where I'm going in future myself&mdash;among people whose brains
are not as obsolete as my appendix; where there still exist standards
and old-fashioned things like principles and religion, and a healthy
terror of the Decalogue!"</p>

<p>"Is anybody really still afraid of the Decalogue?" she asked
curiously.</p>

<p>"Even we are, but some of us are more afraid of ennui. Fire and
fear are the greatest purifiers in the world; it's fear of some
sort or other, and only fear, that keeps the world as decent as
it is."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," she said, playing with her fan. "I'm only afraid
of dying before I have lived at all."</p>

<p>"What do you call living?"</p>

<p>"Being loved," she said, and looked up at him.</p>

<p>"You poor little thing!" he said, only partly in earnest.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sorry for the girl I was.... I was rather a nice girl,
Duane. You remember me before I married."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. You were a corker. You are still."</p>

<p>She nodded: "Yes, outwardly. Within is&mdash;nothing. I am very, very
old; very tired."</p>

<p>He said no more. She sat listlessly watching the dusk-moths hovering
among the pinks. Far away in the darkness rockets were rising,
spraying the sky with fire; faint strains of music came from the
forest.</p>

<p>"Their Fête Galante has begun," she said. "Am I detaining you
too long, Duane?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She smiled: "It is rather amusing," she observed, "my coming
to you for my morals&mdash;to you, Duane, who were once supposed to
possess so few."</p>

<p>"Never mind what I possess," he said, irritated. "What sort of
advice do you expect?"</p>

<p>"Why, moral advice, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh! Are you on the verge of demoralisation?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Am I?... There is a man&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, coming as near a sneer as he was capable.
"I know what you've done. You've nearly twisted poor Grandcourt's
head off his honest neck. If you want to know what I think of
it, it's an abominable thing to do. Why, anybody can see that
the man is in love with you, and desperately unhappy already,
I told you to let him alone. You promised, too."</p>

<p>He spoke rapidly, sharply; she bent her fair head in silence
until he ended.</p>

<p>"May I defend myself?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Then &mdash;I did not mean to make him care for me."</p>

<p>"You all say that."</p>

<p>"Yes; we are not always as innocent as I happen to be this time.
I really did not try, did not think, that he was taking a little
unaccustomed kindness on my part so seriously ... I overdid it;
I'd been beastly to him&mdash;most women are rude to Delancy Grandcourt,
somehow or other. I always was. And one day&mdash;that day in the forest&mdash;somehow
something he said opened my eyes&mdash;hurt me.... And women are fools
to believe him one. Why, Duane, he's every inch a man&mdash;high-minded,
sensitive, proud, generous, forbearing."</p>

<p>Duane turned and stared at her; and to her annoyance the blood
mounted to her cheeks, but she went on:</p>

<p>"Of course he has affected me. I don't know how it might have
been with me if I were not so&mdash;so utterly starved."</p>

<p>"You mean to say you are beginning to care for Delancy Grandcourt?"</p>

<p>"Care? Yes&mdash;in a perfectly nice way&#11834;"</p>

<p>"And otherwise?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't know. I am honest with you, Duane; I don't
know. <em>A&mdash;</em>a little devotion of that kind"&mdash;she tried to
laugh&mdash;"goes to my head, perhaps. I've been so long without it....
I don't know. And I came here to tell you. I came here to ask
you what I ought to do."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" said Duane, "do you already care enough for him
to worry about your effect on him?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>do not wish him to be unhappy."</p>

<p>"Oh. But you are willing to be unhappy in order to save him any
uneasiness. See here, Rosalie, you'd better pull up sharp."</p>

<p>"Had I?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said brutally. "Not many days ago you were adrift.
Don't cut your cable again."</p>

<p>A vivid colour mounted to her temples:</p>

<p>"That is all over," she said. "Have I not come to you again in
spite of the folly that sent me drifting to you before? And can
I pay you a truer compliment, Duane, than to ask the hospitality
of your forbearance and the shelter of your friendship?"</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> a trump, Rosalie," he said, after a moment's
scowling. "You're all right.... I don't know what to say.... If
it's going to give you a little happiness to care for this man&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But what will it do to him, Duane?"</p>

<p>"It ought to do him good if such a girl as you gives him all
of herself that she decently can. I don't know whether I'm right
or wrong!" he added almost angrily. "Confound it! there seems
no end to conjugal infelicity around us these days. I don't know
where the line is&mdash;how close to the danger mark an unhappy woman
may drift and do no harm to anybody. All I know is that I'm sorry&mdash;terribly
sorry for you. You're a corker."</p>

<p>"Thanks," she said with a faint smile. "Do you think Delancy
may safely agree with you without danger to his peace of mind?"</p>

<p>"Why not? After all, you're entitled to lawful happiness. So
is he.... Only&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Only&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"I've never seen it succeed."</p>

<p>"Seen what succeed?"</p>

<p>"What is popularly known as the platonic."</p>

<p>"Oh, this isn't <em>that</em>," she said naïvely. "He's rather
in love already, and I'm quite sure I could be if I &mdash;I let
myself."</p>

<p>Duane groaned.</p>

<p>"Don't come to me asking what to do, then," he said impatiently,
"because I know what you ought to do and I don't know what I'd
do under the circumstances. You know as well as I do where the
danger mark is. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>suspect."</p>

<p>"Well, then&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, we haven't reached it yet," she said innocently.</p>

<p>Her honesty appalled him, and he got up and began to pace the
gravel walk.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to cross it?" he asked, halting abruptly.</p>

<p>"No, I don't.... I don't want to.... Do you think there is any
fear of it?"</p>

<p>"My Lord!" he said in despair, "you talk like a child. I'm trying
to realise that you women&mdash;some of you who appear so primed with
doubtful, worldly wisdom&mdash;are practically as innocent as the day
you married."</p>

<p>"I don't know very much about some things, Duane."</p>

<p>"I notice that," he said grimly.</p>

<p>She said very gravely: "This is the first time I have ever come
very near caring for a man.... I mean since I married." And she
rose and glanced toward the forest.</p>

<p>They stood together for a moment, listening to the distant music,
then, without speaking, turned and walked toward the distant flare
of light which threw great trees into tangled and grotesque silhouette.</p>

<p>"Tales of the Geneii," she murmured, fastening her loup; "Fate
is the Sultan. Pray God nobody cuts my head off."</p>

<p>"You are much too amusing," he said as, side by side, they moved
silently on through the pale starlight, like errant phantoms of
a vanished age, and no further word was said between them, nor
did they look at each other again until, ahead, the road turned
silvery under the rays of the Lodge acetylenes, and beyond, the
first cluster of brilliant lanterns gleamed among the trees.</p>

<p>"And here we separate," she said. "Good-bye," holding out her
hand. "It is my first rendezvous. Wish me a little happiness,
please."</p>

<p>"Happiness and&mdash;good sense," he said, smiling. He retained her
hand for a second, let it go and, stepping back, saluted her gaily
as she passed before him into the blaze of light.</p>
