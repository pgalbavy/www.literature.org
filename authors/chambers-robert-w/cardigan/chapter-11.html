<p>The rain fell thickly until midnight, and kept me listening to
the double roll of the drops along the shingles. I lay in my blanket
under the roof, and slept when the rain ceased, but awoke before
dawn, listening to the wind roaring around the eaves. Pale clouds,
scudding low, alternately hid and revealed the purple roof of
sky on which stars hung trembling like drops of dew.</p>

<p>My landlord, Timothy Boyd, was already astir below, and presently
he came up the ladder with a dish of porridge for me&mdash;a kindness,
indeed, for I had thought to set out for the Cayuga castle on
an empty stomach. He also brought me a bowl of coffee, the berries
of which he said had been sent for my use by Colonel Cresap. I
drank the coffee thankfully, sitting on my mattress of balsam
tips. Then, by lanthorn-light, I dressed me, taking only bullet-pouch,
powder-horn, and rifle, and bearing the six belts in the bosom
of my shirt. I left my pack with Boyd, commending it to his care;
and the rugged old man nodded placidly, bidding me rest assured
of its safety.</p>

<p>"There is foul company at the 'Greathouse Inn,'" he said, as
we descended the ladder to the tap-room below. "Greathouse received
four guests an hour ago. Mount bade me warn you, sir. He said
you would understand."</p>

<p>I understood at once. Butler, Wraxall, Toby Tice, and the fourth
member of the band had arrived in Cresap's camp. But I cared not;
I was about to accomplish my mission under their four noses, and
live to balance my account with them later.</p>

<p>"Is Mount sleeping?" I asked.</p>

<p>The old man laughed.</p>

<p>"I have never seen him sleep," he said. "I know him well, but
I have never seen him asleep. He is out yonder, somewhere, prowling."</p>

<p>"And Shemuel?&mdash;and Cade Renard?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Shemuel is on his way to Pittsburg; Renard mouses with Mount.
Is your rifle loaded, sir? There be foul company at the other
inn. This night, too, did Greathouse make nine savages drunk with
spirits. Have a care that they cross not your path, young man;
for, drunk, your Indians go blind like rattlesnakes in September,
and like those serpents, too, they strike without warning. Have
a care, sir!"</p>

<p>"I wish you knew the Indians as well as I do," said I, smiling.
"I fear none of them, save the Lenni-Lenape, and these I fear
only because I have never known them. I think the whole world
can be tamed with kindness."</p>

<p>Boyd shook his gray head, watching me in silence.</p>

<p>A brisk southwest wind was singing through the pines as I stepped
out-of-doors and peered cautiously about. There was nothing stirring
save the wind and the unseen leaves in the forest. I primed my
rifle and sheltered the pan under the hollow of my arm, then stole
forth into the starlit road.</p>

<p>To gain the river, whence the trail ran northward to the Cayuga
camp, I was obliged to pass the fort, and consequently the "Greathouse
Inn." But I had no fear at this hour o' morning, and I trotted
on along the stump fence like a cub-fox in his proper runway,
until the first curve in the road brought me to Greathouse's inn.</p>

<p>Shutters were drawn and bolted over every window, but candle-light
streamed through loopholes in the tap-room, and I could hear men
singing within and tapping on bowls with spoons:</p>

"My true love is old Brown Bess."

</p>
</div>
<p>Nosing the house delicately, I perceived odours of cooking, of
rum toddy, and of tobacco smoke. Clearly Butler's company were
supping after their long jog on the back trail from Fortress Pitt.</p>

<p>Satisfied that all was safe, I had silently begun skirting the
road ditch shadowed by the fence, when a dark heap, which I had
taken for a stump in the road, moved, rolled over, and moaned.</p>

<p>I stopped, frozen motionless. After a moment's wary reconnoitring,
I crept forward again along the ditch, eyes fastened on the dim
shape ahead, a human form lying in the black shadows of the road.</p>

<p>When I came closer I understood. At my feet, in a drunken stupor,
sprawled a young Cayuga girl, limbs plastered with mud, body saturated
and reeking with the stench of spirits. Her black hair floated
in a pool of rain which spread out reflecting stars. One helpless
hand clutched the mud.</p>

<p>I lifted the little thing and bore her to the shadow of the fence;
but here, to my amazement, lay a drunken squaw, doubtless her
mother, still clinging to an empty bottle; and, along the ditch
and fence, flung in beastly, breathing heaps, I counted seven
more barbarians, old and young, from the infant of ten to the
young buck of twenty, all apparently of the same family, and all
in a sodden swoon.</p>

<p>This was the work, then, done by a single agent of my Lord Dunmore,
Royal Governor of Virginia!</p>

<p>Like torpid snakes they lay there, glistening in the grass, the
children naked, the mother in rags, breathing out poison under
the stars. The very air of morn sweated rum; candle-light from
the loopholes fell across the bodies, flung limply on the grass.</p>

<p>There was nothing I could do for these victims of Greathouse;
no aid within my power to give them. Heartsick, I turned away,
and, quickening my steps, passed swiftly down the muddy trail,
hastening to mend my pace ere dawn should find me missing at the
council-fires burning for me on the dark Ohio.</p>

<p>There were no lights in the fort as I passed; the flag-staff
stood out bare against the stars. On the epaulement above the
outer trench something moved, probably a sentry.</p>

<p>But ere I reached the Ohio the eastern sky had turned saffron,
through which stars still twinkled; and the drifted mist-banks
lay heaped far out across the river, so I could not see the water,
and must follow its course along the edge of this phantom stream,
whose current was vapour and whose waves of piled-up clouds rolled
noiselessly under the stars.</p>

<p>No birds fluted from the mist; even the winds had blown far away
somewhere into the gray morning. But the Cayuga trail was broad
and plain, and I took it at a wolf-trot, thoughtfully reading
its countless signs by the yellow dawn as I went along, marks
of white men, marks of moccasins, imprint of deer and cattle,
trail of rabbit and following fox, and the hand-like traces of
rambling raccoons. On, on, north upon the broad Cayuga trail,
while through the brightening woods sleep fled with the mist and
the world awoke around me. Land and river roused with breathing
and sigh and scarce-heard stir; through earth and water the pulse
of life fluttered and beat on, timed for the moment by the swift
rhythm of my flying feet.</p>

<p>And now a thread of blue smoke, drawn far down the trail, set
my nostrils wide and quivering; a flare of blinding yellow turned
the world into gold; I had met the sun at the Cayuga camp; the
tryst had been kept, thanks to the Lord!</p>

<p>Dark, uncertain forms loomed up in the eye of the sun, tall groups
that never moved as I drew nigh; men who stood motionless as the
pines where the council-fire smoked and flashed like a dull jewel
in the sun.</p>

<p>"Peace!" I said, halting, with upraised hand. "Peace, you wise
men and sachems!"</p>

<p>"Peace!" repeated a low voice. "Peace, bearer of belts!"</p>

<p>I moved nearer, head high, yet seeing in a blur, for the rising
sun blinded me. And when I came to the edge of the fire, I drew
a white belt of wampum from my bosom, and, passing it through
the smoke, held it aloft, flashing in the sun, until every chief
and sachem had sunk down into their blankets, forming a half-circle
before me.</p>

<p>A miracle of speech came to me like the breath of my body; easy,
sober, flowing words followed. I spoke as I had never dared hope
I might speak. Forgotten phrases, caressing idioms, words long
lost flew to aid me, yet not so fast that they crowded, stumbling
and choking speech.</p>

<p>As I spoke, sight slowly returned to my dazzled eyes. I saw the
sachems' painted masks, the totems of three tribes repeated on
blanket and lodge, the Cayuga pipe-symbol hanging from the lodge
posts, the witch-drum swinging under a bush, where ten stems had
been peeled ivory white. Behind all this I saw the green amphitheatre
of trees, blue films of smoke floating from unseen lodges, and
over all the radiance of sunrise painting earth and sky with pale
fire.</p>

<p>Belt after belt I passed through the fragrant birch-smoke; I
spoke to them as Sir William had spoken to Quider with three belts,
and my words were earnest and pitiful, for my heart was full of
tenderness for Sir William and for these patient children of his,
these lost ones, so far from the doors of the Long House.</p>

<p>The ceremony of condolence was more than a ceremony for me; with
eager sympathy I raised up the three stricken tribes; I sweetened
the ashes of the eternal fires; I cleared evil from the Cayuga
trail, and laid the ghastly ghosts of those who stood in forest
highways to confront the fifth nation of the great confederacy.</p>

<p>"Oonah! Oonah!" whimpered the wind in the pines, but I stilled
the winds and purified them, and I cleansed the million needles
of the pines with a belt and an enchanted word.</p>

<p>The last belt was passed, flashing through the smoke; the chief
sachem of the Cayugas rose to receive it, a tall, withered man
of the Wolf tribe, painted and draped in scarlet. His dim, wrinkled
eyes peered at me through the smoke.</p>

<p>For a long time the silence was broken only by the rustling flames
between us; then the old man placed the belt at his feet, straightened
up, and spoke feebly:</p>

<p>"<em>Brother</em>: It is to be known that the Six Nations never
meet in council when mourning, until some brother speaks as you
have spoken.</p>

<p>"<em>Brother</em>: We mourn great men dead. Our Father, through
you, our Elder Brother, has purified our fires, our throats, our
eyes. Where the dead sat among us, three tribes have you raised
up.</p>

<p>"<em>Brother</em>: Listen attentively!"</p>

<p>Behind him from the great painted lodge nine Indian boys entered
the fire-circle and stood proudly with folded arms and heads erect.
And the old sachem, in his scarlet robes, laid his shaking hand
on each youth as he passed, always turning his aged eyes to peer
at me as he repeated in his feeble, cracked voice of a child:</p>

<p>"We acquaint you that one of our sachems, called Quider, is dead;
we raise up this boy in his place and give him the same name."</p>

<p>And, after each boy had been named from one of the dead Cayugas,
he gave me a string of wampum to confirm it, while the chant of
condolence rose from the seated chiefs and sachems, a never-ending
repetition of brave histories, and prophecy of brave deeds from
the beginning of all things through the stilled centuries into
the far future locked in silence.</p>

<p>Hour after hour I stood with bent head and arms folded on my
breast. Sometimes I prayed as I stood, that evil be averted from
these wards of our King; sometimes I grew hot with anger at the
men who could so vilely misuse them.</p>

<p>Dreaming there amid the scented birch-smoke, the chant intoning
with the mourning pines, sombre visions took shape within my brain.
I could not lay these ghosts, awful spectres of ruin and death
crowding around a pallid, flabby, toothless creature of silks
and laces, my Lord Dunmore, smirking at Terror wearing the merciless
mask of Butler.</p>

<p>Around me the ceremony of condolence seemed to change to the
sinister and grotesque Honnonouaroria or Dream Feast, with its
naked demons hurling fire-brands; I swayed where I stood, then
stumbled back out of the scented smoke which had nigh stupefied
me. I opened my eyes dizzily. My ears were ringing with the interminable
chant:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Sah-e-ho-na,<br/>
Sah-e-ho-na."

</p>
</div>
<p>I crossed my arms and waited, careful to keep out of the sweet
smoke which had stolen away my senses and set me dreaming of horrors.</p>

<p>The sun hung above the pines; a slender purple cloud belted it,
a celestial belt in pledge of promised storms, gathering somewhere
beyond the world's green rim.</p>

<p>I watched the cloud growing; the sun died out through a golden
smother from which plumes of vapour swept over the heavens, thickening
till all the sky was covered with painted fleece. And, as I watched
the storm's banners hanging from midheaven, the chant ended, and,
in silence, three chiefs arose and moved towards me through the
smoke. One by one they spoke to me, naming themselves: Yellow
Hand, Tamarack, the ancient sachem robed in scarlet, and lastly
the war-chief, Sowanowane.</p>

<p>It was Tamarack who continued:</p>

<p>"<em>Brother</em>: We have heard. The Three Ensigns of our nation
have heard."</p>

<p>"<em>Brother</em>: We all bear patiently this great wrong done
us by Colonel Cresap. We are patient because Sir William asks

deep among the pine-trees' roots. See, brother! Our hands are
clean. We have not dug in the earth for hatchets."</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>"<em>Brother</em>: Depart in health and honour, bearing these
sacred belts of peace&mdash;"</p>

<p>A frightful scream cut him short; scream after scream arose from
the hidden lodges.</p>

<p>The assembly, gathered at the sanctuary of the council-fire,
rose in a body, blankets falling to the ground, paralyzed, silent,
while the horrid screaming rose to an awful, long-drawn shriek.</p>

<p>Somebody was coming&mdash;somebody plodding heavily, shrieking at
every step, nearer, nearer&mdash;an old woman who staggered out into
the circle of the council, dragging the limp body of a young girl.</p>

<p>"Nine!" she gasped. "Nine slain at dawn by Greathouse! Nine of
the family of Logan! Look, you wise men and sachems! Look at Logan's
child! Dead! Slain by Greathouse! Nine! Mother and children lie
by the road, slain as they slept; slain, sleeping the poisoned
sleep of Greathouse! Dead! Dead! Dead!"</p>

<p>Stupidly the sachems stared at the naked corpse, flung on the
blankets at their feet. The scented smoke curled over the murdered
child, blowing east and south.</p>

<p>Dry-eyed, sick with horror, I moved forward, and the stir seemed
to arouse the sachems. One by one they looked down at the dead,
then turned their flashing eyes on me. I strove to speak; I could
not utter a sound.</p>

<p>The old sachem bent slowly and took a handful of ashes from the
cold embers. Then, rubbing them on his face, he flung down every
belt I had given him and signed to me to do the same with the
belts delivered to me.</p>

<p>When I had dropped the last belt, Yellow Hand made a sign, and
every chief, save Sowanowane, the war-chief, covered his head
with his blanket. I fixed my eyes on the war-chief, dreading lest
he hurl a red belt at my feet. But he only bent his head, bidding
me depart with a gesture. And I went, stunned by the calamity
that had come as lightning to blast the work I had done.</p>

<p>As I dragged myself back, heart-broken, leaden-footed, behind
me I heard the death-wail rising in the forest, the horrid screaming
of women, the fierce yelps of the young men, the thump! thump!
thump! of the drum, dry and sharp as a squirrel's barking.</p>

<p>Utterly overwhelmed by the catastrophe, I wandered aimlessly
into the forest and sat down. Hour after hour I sat there, and
my shocked senses strove only to find some way to avert the consequences
of the deed wrought by Greathouse. But the awful work had been
done; the Gordian knot cut; my Lord Dunmore's war had begun at
last, in deference to my Lord Dunmore's desires, and in accordance
with his plans. Now, Cresap must fight; now, the Six Nations would
rise to avenge the Cayugas on the colonies; now, the King of England
would have the savage allies he desired so ardently, and the foul
pact would be sealed with the blood of Logan's children!</p>

<p>"Never, by God's grace!" I cried out, in my agony; and I stumbled
to my feet, my head burning and throbbing as though it would burst.
The woods had grown dim; the day was already near its end&mdash;this
bloody day! this sad day which had dawned so hopefully for all!
Suddenly I began running through the forest, gnashing my teeth
and cursing the King whom such servants as Dunmore served.</p>

<p>"Faster, oh, faster," I muttered, as I ran; "faster to slay this
devil, Butler, who has counselled Greathouse to this deed!"</p>

<p>Again and again I stumbled and fell, but rose, not feeling the
bruises, crazed to do vengeance on the wicked men who outraged
God by living. But truly, vengeance is the Lord's, and He alone
may repay, nor was I the instrument He chose for His wrath. Swiftly
I ran, swifter ran His purpose; for, behold! a man rose up in
my path and held me fast, a soldier, who shook me and shouted
at me until my senses, which had sped before me with my vengeance,
halted and returned. Presently I began to understand his words,
and listened.</p>

<p>"Are ye mad?" he repeated. "Can't ye see the savages across the
river following? The Cayugas are loose on the Ohio! It is war!"</p>

<p>Other men crept up and dropped into cover behind the trees around
me; some were colonial soldiers, some farmers from the camp, some
hunters in wool shirts and caps. All at once I saw Colonel Cresap
come out into the trail close by, and, when he perceived me, he
cried: "Logan's children have been murdered by Greathouse! The
Cayugas are swarming on the Ohio!"</p>

<p>I hastened to his side and begged him to let me carry his promise
to the Cayugas that Greathouse should be punished, and that his
colonists would retire. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Greathouse has fled to Pittsburg," he said. "I cannot retire
with my people because they would not follow me. It is too late,
Mr. Cardigan; Dunmore has sprung his trap. Ha! Look at that!"
And he turned and shouted out an order to the soldiers around.</p>

<p>A dozen savages, naked to the waist, were fording the Ohio between
us and the settlement. Already the soldiers were running through
the woods along the river to head them off, and Cresap started
after them, calling back for those who remained to guard the trail
in the rear. Then a rifle went bang! among the trees; another
report rang out, followed instantly by twenty more in a volley.</p>

<p>Down a low oak ridge, close by, I saw an Indian tumbling like
a stone till he fell with a splash into a mossy hollow full of
rain-water and dead leaves. After him bounded a hunter in buckskins,
long knife flashing.</p>

<p>"Cresap!" I panted, "don't let him take that scalp! Have your
men gone mad? You can stop this war! It is not too late yet, but
a scalp taken means war &mdash;God in heaven! a scalp means war
to the death!"</p>

<p>"Don't touch that scalp!" roared Cresap, hurrying towards the
ranger, who was kneeling on one knee beside the dead Cayuga. "Nathan
Giles! Do you hear me? Let that scalp alone, you bloody fool!"</p>

<p>It was too late; the ranger squatted, wrenching the scalp free
with a ripping sound, just as Cresap ran up in a towering rage.</p>

<p>"They take ours," remonstrated the ranger, tying the ghastly
trophy to his belt by its braided lock of hair; "I guess I have
a right to scalp my own game!" he added, sullenly.</p>

<p>Cresap turned to me with a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>"You see," he said; and walked slowly away towards the river,
where the rifles were ringing out shot on shot across the shoals
below the shallow camp-ford on the edge of the roaring riffles.</p>

<p>So now, at last, Lord Dunmore's war had begun without hope of
mediation. Too late now for embassy of peace, too late for truce
or promises or the arbitration of fair speech. There is nothing
on earth to compensate for a scalp taken, save a scalp taken in
return. I had failed&mdash;failed totally, and without hope of retrieving
failure. The first attempt must be the last. A scalp had been
taken. My mission was at an end.</p>

<p>Ay, ended irrevocably now, for all around me firelocks and rifles
were banging; the woods swam in smoke; the war-yelp sounded nearer
and nearer; the white cross-belts of the soldiers glimmered through
the trees.</p>

<p>Too miserable to shun danger, I sat down on a stone in the trail,
my head in my hands, rifle across my knees. Presently a soldier
who had been standing near me, firing across the river, fell down
with a grunt and lay there flat on his back.</p>

<p>I stared at him stupidly, not realizing that the man was dead,
though out of his head crawled a sluggish, dark red stream, dropping
steadily onto the withered leaves. It was only when a swift, dusky
shape came creeping out of the brush towards the dead man that
I came to my senses and dropped behind the stone I had been resting
on, barely in time, too, for a bullet came smack! against my rock,
and after it, bounding and yelping, flew an Indian. He was on
me ere I could fire, one sinewy fist twisted in my hair, but his
knife snapped off short on my rifle-stock, and together, over
and over we rolled, down a ravine among the willows, clawing,
clutching, strangling each other, till of a sudden my head struck
a tree, crack! And I knew nothing after that until the cool rain
beating in my face awoke me. I lay very still, listening.</p>

<p>Somebody near by was trying to light a fire; I smelled the flint
and the glowing tinder. Another odour hung heavily in the moist
night air, the wild, rank scent of savage men, strong and unmistakable
as the odour of a dog-fox in March.</p>

<p>I began to move noiselessly, working my head around so that I
might see. My head was aching heavily; I could scarce stir it.
At length I raised myself on my hands, and saw the spark from
a flint fly into a ball of dry moss and hang there like a fire-fly
until the tiny circle of light spread slowly into a glow, ringed
with little flames that ate their way through the tinder-moss.</p>

<p>A tufted head bobbed down beside the flame; unseen lips blew
the fire into a sudden blaze which brightened and flashed up,
throwing ruddy shadows over bush and earth.</p>

<p>Then I saw that I lay on a hill-top in the rain, with dark, shaggy
bushes hedging me. And under every bush crouched an Indian, whose
dusky, half-naked body glistened with paint, over which rain-drops
stood in brilliant beads.</p>

<p>Leggings, clouts, sporrans, and moccasins were soaked; the slippery,
wet buckskins glistened like the hides of serpents; fringes, beaded
belts, and sheaths shone as tinted frost sparkles at sunrise.</p>

<p>In the luminous shadow of the bushes I saw brilliant eyes watching
me as I dragged myself nearer the fire. The red embers' glow fell
on steel blades of hatchets, bathing them with blood-colour to
the hilts.</p>

<p>Once, when I attempted to sit up, an arm shot out of the shadow,
making the sign for silence; and mechanically I repeated the signal
and laid my head down again on the cool, wet ground.</p>

<p>All night I lay, perfectly conscious, beside the Cayuga fire,
yet not alarmed, although a prisoner.</p>

<p>The Cayugas knew me as a belt-bearer from Sir William; they could
not ill-treat me. Tamarack, Yellow Hand, and Sowanowane would
vouch for me to this party of young men who had taken me. I had
harmed none of them; I had barely defended my life when attacked.</p>

<p>As I lay there on the windy hill-top, through the rain across
the dim valley I could see the battle-lanthorns hanging on Cresap's
fort, and I could hear the preparations for a siege, the hammering
and chopping and cries of teamsters, the rumble of wagons over
the drawbridge, the distant challenge of guards, the murmur and
dulled tumult of many people hastening urgent business.</p>

<p>Beside me, on their haunches, crouched my captors, alert and
curious, dressing their ears to the distant noises. There were
eleven of them, young men with all their lives before them in
which to win the eagle's plume; eleven lithe, muscular young savages,
stripped to the belt, well oiled, crowns shaved save for the lock,
and every man freshly painted for war. All wore the Wolf.</p>

<p>He who had taken me, now carried my pouch and powder-horn and
bore my rifle. A scalp hung at his yellow girdle, doubtless the
scalp of the soldier who had been shot beside me in the trail.
I could smell the pomatum on the queue.</p>

<p>I spoke to them calmly, and at first they seemed inclined to
listen, appearing surprised at my knowledge of their tongue. But
they would reply to none of my questions, and finally they silenced
me with sullen threats, which, however, did not disturb me, as
I knew their sachems must set me free.</p>

<p>My head ached a great deal from the blow I had suffered; I was
willing enough to lie quietly and watch the lights in the fort
through the slow veil of falling rain; and presently I fell asleep.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>The hot glare of a torch awoke me. All around me crowded masses
of savages, young and old, women and youths and children. The
woods vomited barbarians; they came in packs, moving swiftly,
muttering to each other, and hastening as though on some pressing
affair.</p>

<p>Women near me were digging a hole, and presently came a strong
young girl, bearing a post of buckeye, and set it heavily in the
hole, fitting it while the others stamped in the mud around it
with naked feet.</p>

<p>The main crowd, however, had surged down into a hollow to the
left, and, as I lay on the ground, watching the shadowy, retreating
throng, of a sudden came three Indians driving before them a white
man, arms tied, bloodless face stamped with horror indescribable.</p>

<p>As he passed the fire where I lay, I thought his starting eyes
met mine, but he staggered on without speaking, down into the
darkness of the hollow. I knew him. He was Nathan Giles, who had
taken the first scalp in Lord Dunmore's war.</p>

<p>Shuddering, I sat up, turning my head towards the gloom below.
There was not a sound. I waited, straining eyes and ears. My heart
drummed on my ribs. I caught my breath and clinched my hands.</p>

<p>Without the slightest warning, the black pit below burst out
in a sheet of light, shining on a thousand motionless savages;
and in the centre of the glare I saw a naked figure, bound to
a tree, twisting through smoke-shot flames.</p>

<p>For a second only the scene wavered before me; then I gripped
my temples and pressed my face down into the cool, wet grass.
Awful cries rang in my ears; the garrison at the fort heard them,
too, for they fired a cannon, and I heard distant drums beating
to arms.</p>

<p>"Thus you are to die," repeated the Indians beside me. "Thus
you will die here on this hill at dawn. Thus you will suffer in
plain view of the fort! This for the death of Logan's children!"</p>

<p>And one to another they said: "He is weeping. He is a woman.
He will weep thus when he burns."</p>

<p>I heard them, but what they said left my mind numbed and cold.
For me there was no meaning in their words; none at all. My ears
shrank from the awful cries, now piercing the very clouds above
me, hell's own solo accompanied by the ceaseless, solemn murmur
of the rain.</p>

<p>Into my nostrils crept the stench of burnt flesh; it grew stronger
and stronger. Silence fell, soothed by the whispering rain; then
out of the night came the dull noise of many people stirring.
They were coming!</p>

<p>As I rose, a Cayuga youth seized me and threw me heavily against
the post I had seen the woman embed in the mud. I fought and strained
and writhed, but they tied me, bracing me up stiff against the
wet stake, trussed like a fowl for basting.</p>

<p>Around me the crowd was thickening; hundreds of tongues loaded
me with insults; thrice a young girl reached out and struck me
in the face.</p>

<p>They had begun piling wood around my feet, and stuffing the spaces
full of dry moss, but before the heap reached my knees they decided
to face me towards the fort, so the work accomplished had to be
undone, my bonds loosened and retied, and my body shifted to breast
the south.</p>

<p>Through the falling rain I saw morning lurking behind the eastern
hills, and I cursed it, for the shock and terror had driven me
out of my senses. I remember hearing a voice calling on God, but
for a long time I did not know the voice was mine. It was only
when the same young girl who had struck me lighted a splinter
of yellow pine and thrust it through my arm that my senses returned.
I opened my eyes as from a swoon, seeing clearly the faces around
me, red under the torches. And foremost among those in front stood
Tamarack in his scarlet robes, just as I had seen him at dawn
through the smoke of the sacred fire. Now my voice came back,
seeking my lips; my parched tongue moved, and I called on Tamarack
to hear me, but he shook his head, though I adjured him by the
belts I had borne and received, by the sanctuary of the council-fire
whose smoke I had sweetened, and by the three tribes I had raised
up.</p>

<p>"Lies," he said; "you come not from Johnstown! Your belts are
lies; your words lie; your tongue is forked! You come from Cresap!
Cresap shall see how you can die for him!"</p>

<p>"I speak the truth!" I cried out, in my agony. "I am a belt-bearer!
I have laid the ghosts of your slain ones! Who dares send my spirit
to teach your dead that you betray their ashes?"</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. Presently somebody in the throng said,
distinctly: "If he speaks the truth, let him go. We honour our
dead." And other voices repeated:</p>

<p>"We honour our dead."</p>

<p>"He lies," said Tamarack.</p>

<p>"I speak truth!" I groaned. "If you honour your dead, if you
honour those whom I have raised up in their places, free me, brothers
of the Cayugas!"</p>

<p>"Free him!" cried many.</p>

<p>For a space the throng was quiet, then a distant movement to
my left made me turn hopefully. The throng wavered, parted, opened,
and a white man came elbowing his way to the stake.</p>

<p>He whispered to Tamarack; the aged sachem stretched out his arm,
making a mystic sign.</p>

<p>Eagerly the white man turned and looked at me, and I cried out
with rage and horror, for I was face to face with Walter Butler.</p>

<p>He spoke, but I scarcely heard him urging my death.</p>

<p>Terror, which had gripped me, gave place to fury, and that in
turn left me faint but calm.</p>

<p>I heard the merciless words in which he delivered me to the savages;
I heard him denounce me as a spy of Cresap and an agent of rebels.
Then I lost his voice.</p>

<p>I was very still for a while, trying to understand that I must
die. The effort tired me; lassitude weighed on me like iron chains.
To my stunned mind death was but a word, repeated vaguely in the
dark chamber of life where my soul sat, listening. Thought was
suspended; sight and hearing failed; there was a void about me,
blank and formless as my mind.</p>

<p>  [Illustration: "'<em>THEY'VE HIT HIM,' SAID MOUNT, RELOADING
HASTILY</em>"]</p>

<p>Presently I became conscious that things were changing around
me. Lights moved, voices struggled into my ears; forms took shape,
pressing closer to me. An undertone, which I had heard at moments
through my stupor, grew, swelling into a steady whisper. It was
the ceaseless rustle of the rain.</p>

<p>A torch blazed up crackling close in front. My eyes opened; a
thrill of purest fear set every sense a-quiver. Amid the dull
roar of voices, I heard women laughing and little children prattling.
Faces became painfully distinct. I saw Sowanowane, the war-chief,
thumb his hatchet; I saw Butler, beside him, catch an old woman
by the arm. He told her to bring dry moss. It rained, rained,
rained.</p>

<p>They were calling to me from the crowd now; everywhere voices
were calling to me: "Show us how Cresap's men die!" Others repeated:
"He is a woman; he will scream out! Logan's children died more
bravely. Oonah! The children of Logan!"</p>

<p>Butler watched me coolly, leaning on his rifle.</p>

<p>"So this ends it," he said, with his deathly grimace. "Well,
it was to be done in one way or another. I had meant to do it
myself, but this will do."</p>

<p>I was too sick with fear, too close to death, to curse him. Pain
often makes me weak; the fear of pain sickens me. It was that
I dreaded, not death. Where my father had gone, I dared follow,
but the flames&mdash;the thought of the fire&mdash;</p>

<p>I said, faintly, "Turn your back to me when I die; I have much
pain to face, Mr. Butler; I may not bear it well."</p>

<p>"No, by God! I will not!" he burst out, ferociously. "I'm here
to see you suffer, damn you!"</p>

<p>I turned my head from him, but he struck me in the face so that
my mouth was bathed in blood; twice he struck me, crying: "Listen!
Listen, I tell you!" And, planting himself before the stake, he
cursed me, vowing that he could tear me with his bared teeth for
hatred.</p>

<p>"Know this before they roast you," he snarled; "I shall possess
your pretty baggage, Mistress Warren, spite of Sir William! I
shall use her to my pleasure; I shall whip her to my feet. I may
wed her, or I may choose to use her otherwise and leave her for
Dunmore. Ah! Ah! Now you rage, eh?"</p>

<p>I had hurled my trussed body forward on the cords, struggling,
convulsed with a fury so frantic that the blood sprayed me where
the bonds cut.</p>

<p>Indians struck me and thrust me back with clubs, for the great
post at my back had been partly dragged out of its socket by my
frenzy, but I did not feel the blows; I fixed my maddened eyes
on Butler and struggled.</p>

<p>But now the sachems were calling him sharply, and he backed away
from me as the circle surged forward. Again the girl came out,
bearing a flaming fagot. She looked up at me, laughed, and thrust
the burning sticks into the moss and tinder which was stacked
around me. A billow of black smoke rolled into my face, choking
and blinding me, and the breath of the flames passed over me.</p>

<p>Twice the rain quenched the fire. They brought fresh heaps of
moss, laughing and jeering. Through the smoke I saw the fort across
the valley, its parapets crowded with people. Jets of flame and
distant reports showed they were firing rifles, hoping perhaps
to kill me ere the torture began. It was too far. The last glimpse
of the fort faded through the downpour; a new pile of moss and
birch-bark was heaped at my feet.</p>

<p>This time the girl was thrust aside and a young Indian advanced,
waving a crackling branch of pitch-pine, roaring with flames.
As he knelt to push it between my feet, a terrific shout burst
from the throng&mdash;a yell of terror and amazement. Through the tumult
I heard women screaming; in front of me the crowd shrank away,
huddling in groups. Some backed into me, stumbling among the fagots;
the young Indian let his blazing pine-branch fall hissing on the
wet ground and stood trembling.</p>

<p>And now into the circle stalked a tall figure, coming straight
towards me through the sheeted rain&mdash;a spectre so hideous that
the cries of terror drowned his voice, for he was speaking as
he came on, moving what had once been a mouth, this dreadful thing,
all raw and festering to the bone.</p>

<p>Two blazing eyes met mine, then rolled around on the cringing
throng; and a voice like the voice of the dead broke out:</p>

<p>"I am come to the judgment of this man whom you burn!"</p>

<p>"Quider!" moaned the throng. "He returns from the grave! Oonah!
He returns!"</p>

<p>But the unearthly voice went on through the whimper of the crowd:</p>

<p>"From the dead I return. I return from the north. Madness drove
me. I come without belts, though belts were given.</p>

<p>"Peace, you wise men and sachems! Set free this man, my brother!"</p>

<p>"Quider!" I gasped. "Bear witness."</p>

<p>And the dead voice echoed, hollow:</p>

<p>"Brother, I witness."</p>

<p>Trembling fingers picked and plucked and tugged at my cords;
the bonds loosened; the sky spun round; down I fell, face splashing
in the mud.</p>
