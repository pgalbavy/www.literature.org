<p>Only the young have such moments. I don’t mean the very young.
No. The very young have, properly speaking, no moments. It is
the privilege of early youth to live in advance of its days in
all the beautiful continuity of hope which knows no pauses and
no introspection.</p>

<p>One closes behind one the little gate of mere boyishness&mdash;and
enters an enchanted garden. Its very shades glow with promise.
Every turn of the path has its seduction. And it isn’t because
it is an undiscovered country. One knows well enough that all
mankind had streamed that way. It is the charm of universal experience
from which one expects an uncommon or personal sensation&mdash;a bit
of one’s own.</p>

<p>One goes on recognizing the landmarks of the predecessors, excited,
amused, taking the hard luck and the good luck together&mdash;the kicks
and the half-pence, as the saying is&mdash;the picturesque common lot
that holds so many possibilities for the deserving or perhaps
for the lucky. Yes. One goes on. And the time, too, goes on&mdash;till
one perceives ahead a shadow-line warning one that the region
of early youth, too, must be left behind.</p>

<p>This is the period of life in which such moments of which I have
spoken are likely to come. What moments? Why, the moments of boredom,
of weariness, of dissatisfaction. Rash moments. I mean moments
when the still young are inclined to commit rash actions, such
as getting married suddenly or else throwing up a job for no reason.</p>

<p>This is not a marriage story. It wasn’t so bad as that with me.
My action, rash as it was, had more the character of divorce&mdash;almost
of desertion. For no reason on which a sensible person could put
a finger I threw up my job&mdash;chucked my berth&mdash;left the ship of
which the worst that could be said was that she was a steamship
and therefore, perhaps, not entitled to that blind loyalty which.
. . . However, it’s no use trying to put a gloss on what even
at the time I myself half suspected to be a caprice.</p>

<p>It was in an Eastern port. She was an Eastern ship, inasmuch
as then she belonged to that port. She traded among dark islands
on a blue reef-scarred sea, with the Red Ensign over the taffrail
and at her masthead a house-flag, also red, but with a green border
and with a white crescent in it. For an Arab owned her, and a
Syed at that. Hence the green border on the flag. He was the head
of a great House of Straits Arabs, but as loyal a subject of the
complex British Empire as you could find east of the Suez Canal.
World politics did not trouble him at all, but he had a great
occult power amongst his own people.</p>

<p>It was all one to us who owned the ship. He had to employ white
men in the shipping part of his business, and many of those he
so employed had never set eyes on him from the first to the last
day. I myself saw him but once, quite accidentally on a wharf&mdash;an
old, dark little man blind in one eye, in a snowy robe and yellow
slippers. He was having his hand severely kissed by a crowd of
Malay pilgrims to whom he had done some favour, in the way of
food and money. His alms-giving, I have heard, was most extensive,
covering almost the whole Archipelago. For isn’t it said that
"The charitable man is the friend of Allah"?</p>

<p>Excellent (and picturesque) Arab owner, about whom one needed
not to trouble one’s head, a most excellent Scottish ship&mdash;for
she was that from the keep up&mdash;excellent sea-boat, easy to keep
clean, most handy in every way, and if it had not been for her
internal propulsion, worthy of any man’s love, I cherish to this
day a profound respect for her memory. As to the kind of trade
she was engaged in and the character of my shipmates, I could
not have been happier if I had had the life and the men made to
my order by a benevolent Enchanter.</p>

<p>And suddenly I left all this. I left it in that, to us, inconsequential
manner in which a bird flies away from a comfortable branch. It
was as though all unknowing I had heard a whisper or seen something.
Well&mdash;perhaps! One day I was perfectly right and the next everything
was gone&mdash;glamour, flavour, interest, contentment&mdash;everything.
It was one of these moments, you know. The green sickness of late
youth descended on me and carried me off. Carried me off that
ship, I mean.</p>

<p>We were only four white men on board, with a large crew of Kalashes
and two Malay petty officers. The Captain stared hard as if wondering
what ailed me. But he was a sailor, and he, too, had been young
at one time. Presently a smile came to lurk under his thick iron-gray
moustache, and he observed that, of course, if I felt I must go
he couldn’t keep me by main force. And it was arranged that I
should be paid off the next morning. As I was going out of his
cabin he added suddenly, in a peculiar wistful tone, that he hoped
I would find what I was so anxious to go and look for. A soft,
cryptic utterance which seemed to reach deeper than any diamond-hard
tool could have done. I do believe he understood my case.</p>

<p>But the second engineer attacked me differently. He was a sturdy
young Scot, with a smooth face and light eyes. His honest red
countenance emerged out of the engine-room companion and then
the whole robust man, with shirt sleeves turned up, wiping slowly
the massive fore-arms with a lump of cotton-waste. And his light
eyes expressed bitter distaste, as though our friendship had turned
to ashes. He said weightily: "Oh! Aye! I’ve been thinking it was
about time for you to run away home and get married to some silly
girl."</p>

<p>It was tacitly understood in the port that John Nieven was a
fierce misogynist; and the absurd character of the sally convinced
me that he meant to be nasty&mdash;very nasty&mdash;had meant to say the
most crushing thing he could think of. My laugh sounded deprecatory.
Nobody but a friend could be so angry as that. I became a little
crestfallen. Our chief engineer also took a characteristic view
of my action, but in a kindlier spirit.</p>

<p>He was young, too, but very thin, and with a mist of fluffy brown
beard all round his haggard face. All day long, at sea or in harbour,
he could be seen walking hastily up and down the after-deck, wearing
an intense, spiritually rapt expression, which was caused by a
perpetual consciousness of unpleasant physical sensations in his
internal economy. For he was a confirmed dyspeptic. His view of
my case was very simple. He said it was nothing but deranged liver.
Of course! He suggested I should stay for another trip and meantime
dose myself with a certain patent medicine in which his own belief
was absolute. "I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll buy you two bottles,
out of my own pocket. There. I can’t say fairer than that, can
I?"</p>

<p>I believe he would have perpetrated the atrocity (or generosity)
at the merest sign of weakening on my part. By that time, however,
I was more discontented, disgusted, and dogged than ever. The
past eighteen months, so full of new and varied experience, appeared
a dreary, prosaic waste of days. I felt&mdash;how shall I express it?&mdash;that
there was no truth to be got out of them.</p>

<p>What truth? I should have been hard put to it to explain. Probably,
if pressed, I would have burst into tears simply. I was young
enough for that.</p>

<p>Next day the Captain and I transacted our business in the Harbour
Office. It was a lofty, big, cool, white room, where the screened
light of day glowed serenely. Everybody in it&mdash;the officials,
the public&mdash;were in white. Only the heavy polished desks gleamed
darkly in a central avenue, and some papers lying on them were
blue. Enormous punkahs sent from on high a gentle draught through
that immaculate interior and upon our perspiring heads.</p>

<p>The official behind the desk we approached grinned amiably and
kept it up till, in answer to his perfunctory question, "Sign
off and on again?"  my Captain answered, "No! Signing off for
good." And then his grin vanished in sudden solemnity. He did
not look at me again till he handed me my papers with a sorrowful
expression, as if they had been my passports for Hades.</p>

<p>While I was putting them away he murmured some question to the
Captain, and I heard the latter answer good-humouredly:</p>

<p>"No. He leaves us to go home."</p>

<p>"Oh!" the other exclaimed, nodding mournfully over my sad condition.</p>

<p>I didn’t know him outside the official building, but he leaned
forward the desk to shake hands with me, compassionately, as one
would with some poor devil going out to be hanged; and I am afraid
I performed my part ungraciously, in the hardened manner of an
impenitent criminal.</p>

<p>No homeward-bound mail-boat was due for three or four days. Being
now a man without a ship, and having for a time broken my connection
with the sea&mdash;become, in fact, a mere potential passenger&mdash;it
would have been more appropriate perhaps if I had gone to stay
at an hotel. There it was, too, within a stone’s throw of the
Harbour Office, low, but somehow palatial, displaying its white,
pillared pavilions surrounded by trim grass plots. I would have
felt a passenger indeed in there! I gave it a hostile glance and
directed my steps toward the Officers’ Sailors’ Home.</p>

<p>I walked in the sunshine, disregarding it, and in the shade of
the big trees on the esplanade without enjoying it. The heat of
the tropical East descended through the leafy boughs, enveloping
my thinly-clad body, clinging to my rebellious discontent, as
if to rob it of its freedom.</p>

<p>The Officers’ Home was a large bungalow with a wide verandah
and a curiously suburban-looking little garden of bushes and a
few trees between it and the street. That institution partook
somewhat of the character of a residential club, but with a slightly
Governmental flavour about it, because it was administered by
the Harbour Office. Its manager was officially styled Chief Steward.
He was an unhappy, wizened little man, who if put into a jockey’s
rig would have looked the part to perfection. But it was obvious
that at some time or other in his life, in some capacity or other,
he had been connected with the sea. Possibly in the comprehensive
capacity of a failure.</p>

<p>I should have thought his employment a very easy one, but he
used to affirm for some reason or other that his job would be
the death of him some day. It was rather mysterious. Perhaps everything
naturally was too much trouble for him. He certainly seemed to
hate having people in the house.</p>

<p>On entering it I thought he must be feeling pleased. It was as
still as a tomb. I could see no one in the living rooms; and the
verandah, too, was empty, except for a man at the far end dozing
prone in a long chair. At the noise of my footsteps he opened
one horribly fish-like eye. He was a stranger to me. I retreated
from there, and crossing the dining room&mdash;a very bare apartment
with a motionless punkah hanging over the centre table &mdash;I
knocked at a door labelled in black letters: "Chief Steward."</p>

<p>The answer to my knock being a vexed and doleful plaint: "Oh,
dear! Oh, dear! What is it now?" I went in at once.</p>

<p>It was a strange room to find in the tropics. Twilight and stuffiness
reigned in there. The fellow had hung enormously ample, dusty,
cheap lace curtains over his windows, which were shut. Piles of
cardboard boxes, such as milliners and dressmakers use in Europe,
cumbered the corners; and by some means he had procured for himself
the sort of furniture that might have come out of a respectable
parlour in the East End of London&mdash;a horsehair sofa, arm-chairs
of the same. I glimpsed grimy antimacassars scattered over that
horrid upholstery, which was awe-inspiring, insomuch that one
could not guess what mysterious accident, need, or fancy had collected
it there. Its owner had taken off his tunic, and in white trousers
and a thin, short-sleeved singlet prowled behind the chair-backs
nursing his meagre elbows.</p>

<p>An exclamation of dismay escaped him when he heard that I had
come for a stay; but he could not deny that there were plenty
of vacant rooms.</p>

<p>"Very well. Can you give me the one I had before?"</p>

<p>He emitted a faint moan from behind a pile of cardboard boxes
on the table, which might have contained gloves or handkerchiefs
or neckties. I wonder what the fellow did keep in them? There
was a smell of decaying coral, or Oriental dust of zoological
speciments in that den of his. I could only see the top of his
head and his unhappy eyes levelled at me over the barrier.</p>

<p>"It’s only for a couple of days," I said, intending to cheer
him up.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to pay in advance?" he suggested eagerly.</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" I burst out directly I could speak. "Never heard
of such a thing! This is the most infernal cheek. . . ."</p>

<p>He had seized his head in both hands&mdash;a gesture of despair which
checked my indignation.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Don’t fly out like this. I am asking everybody."</p>

<p>"I don’t believe it," I said bluntly.</p>

<p>"Well, I am going to. And if you gentlemen all agreed to pay
in advance I could make Hamilton pay up, too. He’s always turning
up ashore dead broke, and even when he has some money he won’t
settle his bills. I don’t know what to do with him. He swears
at me and tells me I can’t chuck a white man out into the street
here. So if you only would. . . ."</p>

<p>I was amazed. Incredulous, too. I suspected the fellow of gratuitous
impertinence. I told him with marked emphasis that I would see
him and Hamilton hanged first, and requested him to conduct me
to my room with no more of his nonsense. He produced then a key
from somewhere and led the way out of his lair, giving me a vicious
sidelong look in passing.</p>

<p>"Any one I know staying here?" I asked him before he left my
room.</p>

<p>He had recovered his usual pained impatient tone, and said that
Captain Giles was there, back from a Solo Sea trip. Two other
guests were staying also. He paused. And, of course, Hamilton,
he added.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Hamilton," I said, and the miserable creature took
himself off with a final groan.</p>

<p>His impudence still rankled when I came into the dining room
at tiffin time. He was there on duty overlooking the Chinamen
servants. The tiffin was laid on one end only of the long table,
and the punkah was stirring the hot air lazily&mdash;mostly above a
barren waste of polished wood.</p>

<p>We were four around the cloth. The dozing stranger from the chair
was one. Both his eyes were partly opened now, but they did not
seem to see anything. He was supine. The dignified person next
him, with short side whiskers and a carefully scraped chin, was,
of course, Hamilton. I have never seen any one so full of dignity
for the station in life Providence had been pleased to place him
in. I had been told that he regarded me as a rank outsider. He
raised not only his eyes, but his eyebrows as well, at the sound
I made pulling back my chair.</p>

<p>Captain Giles was at the head of the table. I exchanged a few
words of greeting with him and sat down on his left. Stout and
pale, with a great shiny dome of a bald forehead and prominent
brown eyes, he might have been anything but a seaman. You would
not have been surprised to learn that he was an architect. To
me (I know how absurd it is) to me he looked like a churchwarden.
He had the appearance of a man from whom you would expect sound
advice, moral sentiments, with perhaps a platitude or two thrown
in on occasion, not from a desire to dazzle, but from honest conviction.</p>

<p>Though very well known and appreciated in the shipping world,
he had no regular employment. He did not want it. He had his own
peculiar position. He was an expert. An expert in&mdash;how shall I
say it?&mdash;in intricate navigation. He was supposed to know more
about remote and imperfectly charted parts of the Archipelago
than any man living. His brain must have been a perfect warehouse
of reefs, positions, bearings, images of headlands, shapes of
obscure coasts, aspects of innumerable islands, desert and otherwise.
Any ship, for instance, bound on a trip to Palawan or somewhere
that way would have Captain Giles on board, either in temporary
command or "to assist the master." It was said that he had a retaining
fee from a wealthy firm of Chinese steamship owners, in view of
such services. Besides, he was always ready to relieve any man
who wished to take a spell ashore for a time. No owner was ever
known to object to an arrangement of that sort. For it seemed
to be the established opinion at the port that Captain Giles was
as good as the best, if not a little better. But in Hamilton’s
view he was an "outsider." I believe that for Hamilton the generalisation
"outsider"  covered the whole lot of us; though I suppose that
he made some distinctions in his mind.</p>

<p>I didn’t try to make conversation with Captain Giles, whom I
had not seen more than twice in my life. But, of course, he knew
who I was. After a while, inclining his big shiny head my way,
he addressed me first in his friendly fashion. He presumed from
seeing me there, he said, that I had come ashore for a couple
of days’ leave.</p>

<p>He was a low-voiced man. I spoke a little louder, saying that:
No &mdash;I had left the ship for good.</p>

<p>"A free man for a bit," was his comment.</p>

<p>"I suppose I may call myself that&mdash;since eleven o’clock," I said.</p>

<p>Hamilton had stopped eating at the sound of our voices. He laid
down his knife and fork gently, got up, and muttering something
about "this infernal heat cutting one’s appetite," went out of
the room. Almost immediately we heard him leave the house down
the verandah steps.</p>

<p>On this Captain Giles remarked easily that the fellow had no
doubt gone off to look after my old job. The Chief Steward, who
had been leaning against the wall, brought his face of an unhappy
goat nearer to the table and addressed us dolefully. His object
was to unburden himself of his eternal grievance against Hamilton.
The man kept him in hot water with the Harbour Office as to the
state of his accounts. He wished to goodness he would get my job,
though in truth what would it be? Temporary relief at best.</p>

<p>I said: "You needn’t worry. He won’t get my job. My successor
is on board already."</p>

<p>He was surprised, and I believe his face fell a little at the
news. Captain Giles gave a soft laugh. We got up and went out
on the verandah, leaving the supine stranger to be dealt with
by the Chinamen. The last thing I saw they had put a plate with
a slice of pine-apple on it before him and stood back to watch
what would happen. But the experiment seemed a failure. He sat
insensible.</p>

<p>It was imparted to me in a low voice by Captain Giles that this
was an officer of some Rajah’s yacht which had come into our port
to be dry-docked. Must have been "seeing life" last night, he
added, wrinkling his nose in an intimate, confidential way which
pleased me vastly. For Captain Giles had prestige. He was credited
with wonderful adventures and with some mysterious tragedy in
his life. And no man had a word to say against him. He continued:</p>

<p>"I remember him first coming ashore here some years ago. Seems
only the other day. He was a nice boy. Oh! these nice boys!"</p>

<p>I could not help laughing aloud. He looked startled, then joined
in the laugh. "No! No! I didn’t mean that," he cried. "What I
meant is that some of them do go soft mighty quick out here."</p>

<p>Jocularly I suggested the beastly heat as the first cause. But
Captain Giles disclosed himself possessed of a deeper philosophy.
Things out East were made easy for white men. That was all right.
The difficulty was to go on keeping white, and some of these nice
boys did not know how. He gave me a searching look, and in a benevolent,
heavy-uncle manner asked point blank:</p>

<p>"Why did you throw up your berth?"</p>

<p>I became angry all of a sudden; for you can understand how exasperating
such a question was to a man who didn’t know. I said to myself
that I ought to shut up that moralist; and to him aloud I said
with challenging politeness:</p>

<p>"Why . . . ? Do you disapprove?"</p>

<p>He was too disconcerted to do more than mutter confusedly: "I!
. . . In a general way. . ." and then gave me up. But he retired
in good order, under the cover of a heavily humorous remark that
he, too, was getting soft, and that this was his time for taking
his little siesta&mdash;when he was on shore. "Very bad habit. Very
bad habit."</p>

<p>There was a simplicity in the man which would have disarmed a
touchiness even more youthful than mine. So when next day at tiffin
he bent his head toward me and said that he had met my late Captain
last evening, adding in an undertone: "He’s very sorry you left.
He had never had a mate that suited him so well," I answered him
earnestly, without any affectation, that I certainly hadn’t been
so comfortable in any ship or with any commander in all my sea-going
days.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;then," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Haven’t you heard, Captain Giles, that I intend to go home?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said benevolently. "I have heard that sort of thing
so often before."</p>

<p>"What of that?" I cried. I thought he was the most dull, unimaginative
man I had ever met. I don’t know what more I would have said,
but the much-belated Hamilton came in just then and took his usual
seat. So I dropped into a mumble.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, you shall see it done this time."</p>

<p>Hamilton, beautifully shaved, gave Captain Giles a curt nod,
but didn’t even condescend to raise his eyebrows at me; and when
he spoke it was only to tell the Chief Steward that the food on
his plate wasn’t fit to be set before a gentleman. The individual
addressed seemed much too unhappy to groan. He cast his eyes up
to the punkah and that was all.</p>

<p>Captain Giles and I got up from the table, and the stranger next
to Hamilton followed our example, manoeuvring himself to his feet
with difficulty. He, poor fellow, not because he was hungry but
I verily believe only to recover his self-respect, had tried to
put some of that unworthy food into his mouth. But after dropping
his fork twice and generally making a failure of it, he had sat
still with an air of intense mortification combined with a ghastly
glazed stare. Both Giles and I had avoided looking his way at
table.</p>

<p>On the verandah he stopped short on purpose to address to us
anxiously a long remark which I failed to understand completely.
It sounded like some horrible unknown language. But when Captain
Giles, after only an instant for reflection, assured him with
homely friendliness, "Aye, to be sure. You are right there," he
appeared very much gratified indeed, and went away (pretty straight,
too) to seek a distant long chair.</p>

<p>"What was he trying to say?" I asked with disgust.</p>

<p>"I don’t know. Mustn’t be down too much on a fellow. He’s feeling
pretty wretched, you may be sure; and to-morrow he’ll feel worse
yet."</p>

<p>Judging by the man’s appearance it seemed impossible. I wondered
what sort of complicated debauch had reduced him to that unspeakable
condition. Captain Giles’ benevolence was spoiled by a curious
air of complacency which I disliked. I said with a little laugh:</p>

<p>"Well, he will have you to look after him." He made a deprecatory
gesture, sat down, and took up a paper. I did the same. The papers
were old and uninteresting, filled up mostly with dreary stereotyped
descriptions of Queen Victoria’s first jubilee celebrations. Probably
we should have quickly fallen into a tropical afternoon doze if
it had not been for Hamilton’s voice raised in the dining room.
He was finishing his tiffin there. The big double doors stood
wide open permanently, and he could not have had any idea how
near to the doorway our chairs were placed. He was heard in a
loud, supercilious tone answering some statement ventured by the
Chief Steward.</p>

<p>"I am not going to be rushed into anything. They will be glad
enough to get a gentleman I imagine. There is no hurry."</p>

<p>A loud whispering from the Steward succeeded and then again Hamilton
was heard with even intenser scorn.</p>

<p>"What? That young ass who fancies himself for having been chief
mate with Kent so long? . . . Preposterous."</p>

<p>Giles and I looked at each other. Kent being the name of my late
commander, Captain Giles’ whisper, "He’s talking of you," seemed
to me sheer waste of breath. The Chief Steward must have stuck
to his point, whatever it was, because Hamilton was heard again
more supercilious if possible, and also very emphatic:</p>

<p>"Rubbish, my good man! One doesn’t <em>compete</em> with a rank
outsider like that. There’s plenty of time."</p>

<p>Then there were pushing of chairs, footsteps in the next room,
and plaintive expostulations from the Steward, who was pursuing
Hamilton, even out of doors through the main entrance.</p>

<p>"That’s a very insulting sort of man," remarked Captain Giles&mdash;superfluously,
I thought. "Very insulting. You haven’t offended him in some way,
have you?"</p>

<p>"Never spoke to him in my life," I said grumpily. "Can’t imagine
what he means by competing. He has been trying for my job after
I left&mdash;and didn’t get it. But that isn’t exactly competition."</p>

<p>Captain Giles balanced his big benevolent head thoughtfully.
"He didn’t get it," he repeated very slowly. "No, not likely either,
with Kent. Kent is no end sorry you left him. He gives you the
name of a good seaman, too."</p>

<p>I flung away the paper I was still holding. I sat up, I slapped
the table with my open palm. I wanted to know why he would keep
harping on that, my absolutely private affair. It was exasperating,
really.</p>

<p>Captain Giles silenced me by the perfect equanimity of his gaze.
"Nothing to be annoyed about," he murmured reasonably, with an
evident desire to soothe the childish irritation he had aroused.
And he was really a man of an appearance so inoffensive that I
tried to explain myself as much as I could. I told him that I
did not want to hear any more about what was past and gone. It
had been very nice while it lasted, but now it was done with I
preferred not to talk about it or even think about it. I had made
up my mind to go home.</p>

<p>He listened to the whole tirade in a particular lending-the-ear
attitude, as if trying to detect a false note in it somewhere;
then straightened himself up and appeared to ponder sagaciously
over the matter.</p>

<p>"Yes. You told me you meant to go home. Anything in view there?"</p>

<p>Instead of telling him that it was none of his business I said
sullenly:</p>

<p>"Nothing that I know of."</p>

<p>I had indeed considered that rather blank side of the situation
I had created for myself by leaving suddenly my very satisfactory
employment. And I was not very pleased with it. I had it on the
tip of my tongue to say that common sense had nothing to do with
my action, and that therefore it didn’t deserve the interest Captain
Giles seemed to be taking in it. But he was puffing at a short
wooden pipe now, and looked so guileless, dense, and commonplace,
that it seemed hardly worth while to puzzle him either with truth
or sarcasm.</p>

<p>He blew a cloud of smoke, then surprised me by a very abrupt:
"Paid your passage money yet?"</p>

<p>Overcome by the shameless pertinacity of a man to whom it was
rather difficult to be rude, I replied with exaggerated meekness
that I had not done so yet. I thought there would be plenty of
time to do that to-morrow.</p>

<p>And I was about to turn away, withdrawing my privacy from his
fatuous, objectless attempts to test what sort of stuff it was
made of, when he laid down his pipe in an extremely significant
manner, you know, as if a critical moment had come, and leaned
sideways over the table between us.</p>

<p>"Oh! You haven’t yet!" He dropped his voice mysteriously. "Well,
then I think you ought to know that there’s something going on
here."</p>

<p>I had never in my life felt more detached from all earthly goings
on. Freed from the sea for a time, I preserved the sailor’s consciousness
of complete independence from all land affairs. How could they
concern me? I gazed at Captain Giles’ animation with scorn rather
than with curiosity.</p>

<p>To his obviously preparatory question whether our Steward had
spoken to me that day I said he hadn’t. And what’s more he would
have had precious little encouragement if he had tried to. I didn’t
want the fellow to speak to me at all.</p>

<p>Unrebuked by my petulance, Captain Giles, with an air of immense
sagacity, began to tell me a minute tale about a Harbour Office
peon. It was absolutely pointless. A peon was seen walking that
morning on the verandah with a letter in his hand. It was in an
official envelope. As the habit of these fellows is, he had shown
it to the first white man he came across. That man was our friend
in the arm-chair. He, as I knew, was not in a state to interest
himself in any sublunary matters. He could only wave the peon
away. The peon then wandered on along the verandah and came upon
Captain Giles, who was there by an extraordinary chance. . . .</p>

<p>At this point he stopped with a profound look. The letter, he
continued, was addressed to the Chief Steward. Now what could
Captain Ellis, the Master Attendant, want to write to the Steward
for? The fellow went every morning, anyhow, to the Harbour Office
with his report, for orders or what not. He hadn’t been back more
than an hour before there was an office peon chasing him with
a note. Now what was that for?</p>

<p>And he began to speculate. It was not for this&mdash;and it could
not be for that. As to that other thing it was unthinkable.</p>

<p>The fatuousness of all this made me stare. If the man had not
been somehow a sympathetic personality I would have resented it
like an insult. As it was, I felt only sorry for him. Something
remarkably earnest in his gaze prevented me from laughing in his
face. Neither did I yawn at him. I just stared.</p>

<p>His tone became a shade more mysterious. Directly the fellow
(meaning the Steward) got that note he rushed for his hat and
bolted out of the house. But it wasn’t because the note called
him to the Harbour Office. He didn’t go there. He was not absent
long enough for that. He came darting back in no time, flung his
hat away, and raced about the dining room moaning and slapping
his forehead. All these exciting facts and manifestations had
been observed by Captain Giles. He had, it seems, been meditating
upon them ever since.</p>

<p>I began to pity him profoundly. And in a tone which I tried to
make as little sarcastic as possible I said that I was glad he
had found something to occupy his morning hours.</p>

<p>With his disarming simplicity he made me observe, as if it were
a matter of some consequence, how strange it was that he should
have spent the morning indoors at all. He generally was out before
tiffin, visiting various offices, seeing his friends in the harbour,
and so on. He had felt out of sorts somewhat on rising. Nothing
much. Just enough to make him feel lazy.</p>

<p>All this with a sustained, holding stare which, in conjunction
with the general inanity of the discourse, conveyed the impression
of mild, dreary lunacy. And when he hitched his chair a little
and dropped his voice to the low note of mystery, it flashed upon
me that high professional reputation was not necessarily a guarantee
of sound mind.</p>

<p>It never occurred to me then that I didn’t know in what soundness
of mind exactly consisted and what a delicate and, upon the whole,
unimportant matter it was. With some idea of not hurting his feelings
I blinked at him in an interested manner. But when he proceeded
to ask me mysteriously whether I remembered what had passed just
now between that Steward of ours and "that man Hamilton," I only
grunted sourly assent and turned away my head.</p>

<p>"Aye. But do you remember every word?" he insisted tactfully.</p>

<p>"I don’t know. It’s none of my business," I snapped out, consigning,
moreover, the Steward and Hamilton aloud to eternal perdition.</p>

<p>I meant to be very energetic and final, but Captain Giles continued
to gaze at me thoughtfully. Nothing could stop him. He went on
to point out that my personality was involved in that conversation.
When I tried to preserve the semblance of unconcern he became
positively cruel. I heard what the man had said? Yes? What did
I think of it then?&mdash;he wanted to know.</p>

<p>Captain Giles’ appearance excluding the suspicion of mere sly
malice, I came to the conclusion that he was simply the most tactless
idiot on earth. I almost despised myself for the weakness of attempting
to enlighten his common understanding. I started to explain that
I did not think anything whatever. Hamilton was not worth a thought.
What such an offensive loafer . . . "Aye! that he is," interjected
Captain Giles . . . thought or said was below any decent man’s
contempt, and I did not propose to take the slightest notice of
it.</p>

<p>This attitude seemed to me so simple and obvious that I was really
astonished at Giles giving no sign of assent. Such perfect stupidity
was almost interesting.</p>

<p>"What would you like me to do?" I asked, laughing. "I can’t start
a row with him because of the opinion he has formed of me. Of
course, I’ve heard of the contemptuous way he alludes to me. But
he doesn’t intrude his contempt on my notice. He has never expressed
it in my hearing. For even just now he didn’t know we could hear
him. I should only make myself ridiculous."</p>

<p>That hopeless Giles went on puffing at his pipe moodily. All
at once his face cleared, and he spoke.</p>

<p>"You missed my point."</p>

<p>"Have I? I am very glad to hear it," I said.</p>

<p>With increasing animation he stated again that I had missed his
point. Entirely. And in a tone of growing self-conscious complacency
he told me that few things escaped his attention, and he was rather
used to think them out, and generally from his experience of life
and men arrived at the right conclusion.</p>

<p>This bit of self-praise, of course, fitted excellently the laborious
inanity of the whole conversation. The whole thing strengthened
in me that obscure feeling of life being but a waste of days,
which, half-unconsciously, had driven me out of a comfortable
berth, away from men I liked, to flee from the menace of emptiness
. . . and to find inanity at the first turn. Here was a man of
recognized character and achievement disclosed as an absurd and
dreary chatterer. And it was probably like this everywhere&mdash;from
east to west, from the bottom to the top of the social scale.</p>

<p>A great discouragement fell on me. A spiritual drowsiness. Giles’
voice was going on complacently; the very voice of the universal
hollow conceit. And I was no longer angry with it. There was nothing
original, nothing new, startling, informing, to expect from the
world; no opportunities to find out something about oneself, no
wisdom to acquire, no fun to enjoy. Everything was stupid and
overrated, even as Captain Giles was. So be it.</p>

<p>The name of Hamilton suddenly caught my ear and roused me up.</p>

<p>"I thought we had done with him," I said, with the greatest possible
distaste.</p>

<p>"Yes. But considering what we happened to hear just now I think
you ought to do it."</p>

<p>"Ought to do it?" I sat up bewildered. "Do what?"</p>

<p>Captain Giles confronted me very much surprised.</p>

<p>"Why! Do what I have been advising you to try. You go and ask
the Steward what was there in that letter from the Harbour Office.
Ask him straight out."</p>

<p>I remained speechless for a time. Here was something unexpected
and original enough to be altogether incomprehensible. I murmured,
astounded:</p>

<p>"But I thought it was Hamilton that you . . ."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Don’t you let him. You do what I tell you. You tackle
that Steward. You’ll make him jump, I bet," insisted Captain Giles,
waving his smouldering pipe impressively at me. Then he took three
rapid puffs at it.</p>

<p>His aspect of triumphant acuteness was indescribable. Yet the
man remained a strangely sympathetic creature. Benevolence radiated
from him ridiculously, mildly, impressively. It was irritating,
too. But I pointed out coldly, as one who deals with the incomprehensible,
that I didn’t see any reason to expose myself to a snub from the
fellow. He was a very unsatisfactory steward and a miserable wretch
besides, but I would just as soon think of tweaking his nose.</p>

<p>"Tweaking his nose," said Captain Giles in a scandalized tone.
"Much use it would be to you."</p>

<p>That remark was so irrelevant that one could make no answer to
it. But the sense of the absurdity was beginning at last to exercise
its well-known fascination. I felt I must not let the man talk
to me any more. I got up, observing curtly that he was too much
for me&mdash;that I couldn’t make him out.</p>

<p>Before I had time to move away he spoke again in a changed tone
of obstinacy and puffing nervously at his pipe.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;he’s a&mdash;no account cuss&mdash;anyhow. You just&mdash;ask him. That’s
all."</p>

<p>That new manner impressed me&mdash;or rather made me pause. But sanity
asserting its sway at once I left the verandah after giving him
a mirthless smile. In a few strides I found myself in the dining
room, now cleared and empty. But during that short time various
thoughts occurred to me, such as: that Giles had been making fun
of me, expecting some amusement at my expense; that I probably
looked silly and gullible; that I knew very little of life. .
. .</p>

<p>The door facing me across the dining room flew open to my extreme
surprise. It was the door inscribed with the word "Steward" and
the man himself ran out of his stuffy, Philistinish lair in his
absurd, hunted-animal manner, making for the garden door.</p>

<p>To this day I don’t know what made me call after him. "I say!
Wait a minute." Perhaps it was the sidelong glance he gave me;
or possibly I was yet under the influence of Captain Giles’ mysterious
earnestness. Well, it was an impulse of some sort; an effect of
that force somewhere within our lives which shapes them this way
or that. For if these words had not escaped from my lips (my will
had nothing to do with that) my existence would, to be sure, have
been still a seaman’s existence, but directed on now to me utterly
inconceivable lines.</p>

<p>No. My will had nothing to do with it. Indeed, no sooner had
I made that fateful noise than I became extremely sorry for it.
Had the man stopped and faced me I would have had to retire in
disorder. For I had no notion to carry out Captain Giles’ idiotic
joke, either at my own expense or at the expense of the Steward.</p>

<p>But here the old human instinct of the chase came into play.
He pretended to be deaf, and I, without thinking a second about
it, dashed along my own side of the dining table and cut him off
at the very door.</p>

<p>"Why can’t you answer when you are spoken to?" I asked roughly.</p>

<p>He leaned against the lintel of the door. He looked extremely
wretched. Human nature is, I fear, not very nice right through.
There are ugly spots in it. I found myself growing angry, and
that, I believe, only because my quarry looked so woe-begone.
Miserable beggar!</p>

<p>I went for him without more ado. "I understand there was an official
communication to the Home from the Harbour Office this morning.
Is that so?"</p>

<p>Instead of telling me to mind my own business, as he might have
done, he began to whine with an undertone of impudence. He couldn’t
see me anywhere this morning. He couldn’t be expected to run all
over the town after me.</p>

<p>"Who wants you to?" I cried. And then my eyes became opened to
the inwardness of things and speeches the triviality of which
had been so baffling and tiresome.</p>

<p>I told him I wanted to know what was in that letter. My sternness
of tone and behaviour was only half assumed. Curiosity can be
a very fierce sentiment&mdash;at times.</p>

<p>He took refuge in a silly, muttering sulkiness. It was nothing
to me, he mumbled. I had told him I was going home. And since
I was going home he didn’t see why he should. . . .</p>

<p>That was the line of his argument, and it was irrelevant enough
to be almost insulting. Insulting to one’s intelligence, I mean.</p>

<p>In that twilight region between youth and maturity, in which
I had my being then, one is peculiarly sensitive to that kind
of insult. I am afraid my behaviour to the Steward became very
rough indeed. But it wasn’t in him to face out anything or anybody.
Drug habit or solitary tippling, perhaps. And when I forgot myself
so far as to swear at him he broke down and began to shriek.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to say that he made a great outcry. It was a cynical
shrieking confession, only faint&mdash;piteously faint. It wasn’t very
coherent either, but sufficiently so to strike me dumb at first.
I turned my eyes from him in righteous indignation, and perceived
Captain Giles in the verandah doorway surveying quietly the scene,
his own handiwork, if I may express it in that way. His smouldering
black pipe was very noticeable in his big, paternal fist. So,
too, was the glitter of his heavy gold watch-chain across the
breast of his white tunic. He exhaled an atmosphere of virtuous
sagacity serene enough for any innocent soul to fly to confidently.
I flew to him.</p>

<p>"You would never believe it," I cried. "It was a notification
that a master is wanted for some ship. There’s a command apparently
going about and this fellow puts the thing in his pocket."</p>

<p>The Steward screamed out in accents of loud despair: "You will
be the death of me!"</p>

<p>The mighty slap he gave his wretched forehead was very loud,
too. But when I turned to look at him he was no longer there.
He had rushed away somewhere out of sight. This sudden disappearance
made me laugh.</p>

<p>This was the end of the incident&mdash;for me. Captain Giles, however,
staring at the place where the Steward had been, began to haul
at his gorgeous gold chain till at last the watch came up from
the deep pocket like solid truth from a well. Solemnly he lowered
it down again and only then said:</p>

<p>"Just three o’clock. You will be in time&mdash;if you don’t lose any,
that is."</p>

<p>"In time for what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! For the Harbour Office. This must be looked into."</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, he was right. But I’ve never had much taste
for investigation, for showing people up and all that no doubt
ethically meritorious kind of work. And my view of the episode
was purely ethical. If any one had to be the death of the Steward
I didn’t see why it shouldn’t be Captain Giles himself, a man
of age and standing, and a permanent resident. Whereas, I in comparison,
felt myself a mere bird of passage in that port. In fact, it might
have been said that I had already broken off my connection. I
muttered that I didn’t think&mdash;it was nothing to me. . . .</p>

<p>"Nothing!" repeated Captain Giles, giving some signs of quiet,
deliberate indignation. "Kent warned me you were a peculiar young
fellow. You will tell me next that a command is nothing to you&mdash;and
after all the trouble I’ve taken, too!"</p>

<p>"The trouble!" I murmured, uncomprehending. What trouble? All
I could remember was being mystified and bored by his conversation
for a solid hour after tiffin. And he called that taking a lot
of trouble.</p>

<p>He was looking at me with a self-complacency which would have
been odious in any other man. All at once, as if a page of a book
had been turned over disclosing a word which made plain all that
had gone before, I perceived that this matter had also another
than an ethical aspect.</p>

<p>And still I did not move. Captain Giles lost his patience a little.
With an angry puff at his pipe he turned his back on my hesitation.</p>

<p>But it was not hesitation on my part. I had been, if I may express
myself so, put out of gear mentally. But as soon as I had convinced
myself that this stale, unprofitable world of my discontent contained
such a thing as a command to be seized, I recovered my powers
of locomotion.</p>

<p>It’s a good step from the Officers’ Home to the Harbour Office;
but with the magic word "Command" in my head I found myself suddenly
on the quay as if transported there in the twinkling of an eye,
before a portal of dressed white stone above a flight of shallow
white steps.</p>

<p>All this seemed to glide toward me swiftly. The whole great roadstead
to the right was just a mere flicker of blue, and the dim cool
hall swallowed me up out of the heat and glare of which I had
not been aware till the very moment I passed in from it.</p>

<p>The broad inner staircase insinuated itself under my feet somehow.
Command is a strong magic. The first human beings I perceived
distinctly since I had parted with the indignant back of Captain
Giles were the crew of the harbour steam-launch lounging on the
spacious landing about the curtained archway of the shipping office.</p>

<p>It was there that my buoyancy abandoned me. The atmosphere of
officialdom would kill anything that breathes the air of human
endeavour, would extinguish hope and fear alike in the supremacy
of paper and ink. I passed heavily under the curtain which the
Malay coxswain of the harbour launch raised for me. There was
nobody in the office except the clerks, writing in two industrious
rows. But the head Shipping-Master hopped down from his elevation
and hurried along on the thick mats to meet me in the broad central
passage.</p>

<p>He had a Scottish name, but his complexion was of a rich olive
hue, his short beard was jet black, and his eyes, also black,
had a languishing expression. He asked confidentially:</p>

<p>"You want to see Him?"</p>

<p>All lightness of spirit and body having departed from me at the
touch of officialdom, I looked at the scribe without animation
and asked in my turn wearily:</p>

<p>"What do you think? Is it any use?"</p>

<p>"My goodness! He has asked for you twice today."</p>

<p>This emphatic He was the supreme authority, the Marine Superintendent,
the Harbour-Master&mdash;a very great person in the eyes of every single
quill-driver in the room. But that was nothing to the opinion
he had of his own greatness.</p>

<p>Captain Ellis looked upon himself as a sort of divine (pagan)
emanation, the deputy-Neptune for the circumambient seas. If he
did not actually rule the waves, he pretended to rule the fate
of the mortals whose lives were cast upon the waters.</p>

<p>This uplifting illusion made him inquisitorial and peremptory.
And as his temperament was choleric there were fellows who were
actually afraid of him. He was redoubtable, not in virtue of his
office, but because of his unwarrantable assumptions. I had never
had anything to do with him before.</p>

<p>I said: "Oh! He has asked for me twice. Then perhaps I had better
go in."</p>

<p>"You must! You must!"</p>

<p>The Shipping-Master led the way with a mincing gait around the
whole system of desks to a tall and important-looking door, which
he opened with a deferential action of the arm.</p>

<p>He stepped right in (but without letting go of the handle) and,
after gazing reverently down the room for a while, beckoned me
in by a silent jerk of the head. Then he slipped out at once and
shut the door after me most delicately.</p>

<p>Three lofty windows gave on the harbour. There was nothing in
them but the dark-blue sparkling sea and the paler luminous blue
of the sky. My eye caught in the depths and distances of these
blue tones the white speck of some big ship just arrived and about
to anchor in the outer roadstead. A ship from home&mdash;after perhaps
ninety days at sea. There is something touching about a ship coming
in from sea and folding her white wings for a rest.</p>

<p>The next thing I saw was the top-knot of silver hair surmounting
Captain Ellis’ smooth red face, which would have been apoplectic
if it hadn’t had such a fresh appearance.</p>

<p>Our deputy-Neptune had no beard on his chin, and there was no
trident to be seen standing in a corner anywhere, like an umbrella.
But his hand was holding a pen&mdash;the official pen, far mightier
than the sword in making or marring the fortune of simple toiling
men. He was looking over his shoulder at my advance.</p>

<p>When I had come well within range he saluted me by a nerve-shattering:
"Where have you been all this time?"</p>

<p>As it was no concern of his I did not take the slightest notice
of the shot. I said simply that I had heard there was a master
needed for some vessel, and being a sailing-ship man I thought
I would apply. . . .</p>

<p>He interrupted me. "Why! Hang it! <em>You</em> are the right
man for that job&mdash;if there had been twenty others after it. But
no fear of that. They are all afraid to catch hold. That’s what’s
the matter."</p>

<p>He was very irritated. I said innocently: "Are they, sir. I wonder
why?"</p>

<p>"Why!" he fumed. "Afraid of the sails. Afraid of a white crew.
Too much trouble. Too much work. Too long out here. Easy life
and deck-chairs more their mark. Here I sit with the Consul-General’s
cable before me, and the only man fit for the job not to be found
anywhere. I began to think you were funking it, too. . . ."</p>

<p>"I haven’t been long getting to the office," I remarked calmly.</p>

<p>"You have a good name out here, though," he growled savagely
without looking at me.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear it from you, sir," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes. But you are not on the spot when you are wanted. You know
you weren’t. That steward of yours wouldn’t dare to neglect a
message from this office. Where the devil did you hide yourself
for the best part of the day?"</p>

<p>I only smiled kindly down on him, and he seemed to recollect
himself, and asked me to take a seat. He explained that the master
of a British ship having died in Bangkok the Consul-General had
cabled to him a request for a competent man to be sent out to
take command.</p>

<p>Apparently, in his mind, I was the man from the first, though
for the looks of the thing the notification addressed to the Sailors’
Home was general. An agreement had already been prepared. He gave
it to me to read, and when I handed it back to him with the remark
that I accepted its terms, the deputy-Neptune signed it, stamped
it with his own exalted hand, folded it in four (it was a sheet
of blue foolscap) and presented it to me&mdash;a gift of extraordinary
potency, for, as I put it in my pocket, my head swam a little.</p>

<p>"This is your appointment to the command," he said with a certain
gravity. "An official appointment binding the owners to conditions
which you have accepted. Now&mdash;when will you be ready to go?"</p>

<p>I said I would be ready that very day if necessary. He caught
me at my word with great alacrity. The steamer Melita was leaving
for Bangkok that evening about seven. He would request her captain
officially to give me a passage and wait for me till ten o’clock.</p>

<p>Then he rose from his office chair, and I got up, too. My head
swam, there was no doubt about it, and I felt a certain heaviness
of limbs as if they had grown bigger since I had sat down on that
chair. I made my bow.</p>

<p>A subtle change in Captain Ellis’ manner became perceptible as
though he had laid aside the trident of deputy-Neptune. In reality,
it was only his official pen that he had dropped on getting up.</p>
