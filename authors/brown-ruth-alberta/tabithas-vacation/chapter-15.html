<p>"Well, vacation is over, and we had just begun having a good
time," sighed Tabitha mournfully, drawing back the curtains and
peering out of the window that September morning into the gray
fog of early dawn.  "It doesn't seem possible that we are back
in Los Angeles again.  I 'most wish we had stayed at Catalina
for this last day."</p>

<p>The Catalina campers, after a delightful two weeks' outing on
the Island, had returned to mainland the day before; but as Ivy
Hall had not yet opened its doors to its pupils, and most of the
girls lived in neighboring towns, Myra Haskell had invited them
to spend the night with her at her aunt's house.  The aunt, Mrs.
Cummings, was herself away on a brief vacation, but had given
her harum-scarum niece permission to take possession of her pretty
bungalow for the two nights the party would be in Los Angeles
before school commenced.  So, as the gray day dawned, it found
a dozen mummy-like figures stretched about the floor of the great
living-room, wrapped in blankets and quilts, and snoring blissfully.</p>

<p>This was the audience which Tabitha addressed, but she did not
realize that she had spoken her thoughts aloud, and was startled
when Myra, without opening her eyes, grunted, "Huh!  You'll sing
another tune before night.  This is to be <em>the</em> gala day
of your life.  You will never forget it.  When Dad starts out
to do a thing, he never stops half way.  The only trouble is to
get him started."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to grumble, truly," cried Tabitha, dismayed at
having had her ungracious complaint overheard by her young hostess. 
"It is just grand of your family to invite all of us out to your
ranch for the day, but I believe it's going to rain.  It certainly
looks like it. You could cut the fog with a knife."</p>

<p>"Whist! my young friend," murmured Gwynne, wakened from her slumbers
by the sound of voices in the room.  "Don't be so pessimistic. 
Don't you know it never rains in California?  At least not in
the summer time." For from the opposite corner of the room someone
had sleepily murmured, "What about the ostriches?" and the whole
company laughed reminiscently, recalling that Thanksgiving night
when the storm had frightened the ostriches at the Park until
they broke loose and created a panic among the returning theatre-goers.</p>

<p>"Who said rain?" demanded Grace, lifting a tousled head from
the pillow to survey the hilarious group scattered about the floor
of the spacious room.</p>

<p>"Go back to sleep,&mdash;you dreamed it!" teased Bessie, who had begun
to slip on her clothes.  "'Twas snow we were talking about.  Feels
like it, anyway."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> pretty chilly," admitted Tabitha, shivering under
the thin folds of her borrowed dressing-gown, as she turned away
from the window and prepared to follow Bessie's example.  "Wake
up, thou sluggards, 'tis time you were dressed.  Remember we have
a long and arduous day ahead of us."</p>

<p>"Kitty must be tired," said Julia in mock sympathy, crawling
out of her warm nest and jerking the blanket off her nearest neighbor
with ruthless hand.  "Is that it, Kitty?  First you want it to
rain, and then when you can't make it do that, you begin to moan
about the length of the day before us."</p>

<p>"All wrong," Vera spoke up suddenly.  "She is merely thinking
of that dear, cross-eyed boatman at Avalon.  You know he promised
to give us a free ride to the Marine Gardens this morning, and
here we all came away and dragged Tabitha with us.  Shame on us! 
What could we be thinking about!"</p>

<p>Tabitha wisely joined in the laugh which followed this sally,
and sent a pillow flying after her tormentor, who had made a wild
dash for the hall.  "No, sir, I'm not bemoaning my fate," she
vigorously denied, with her mouth full of pins.  "I know we shall
have a splendid time at the ranch.  Only it seems as if vacation
had only just begun, instead of being nearly ended; and the day
looks so cloudy and gray that it doesn't seem like a fitting climax
for our lovely two weeks at Catalina."</p>

<p>"It is too bad that you got cheated out of all the fun this summer,"
Myra sympathized heartily.  "But just you wait until the day is
done before you say it is not a fitting climax&mdash;  Gracious Caesar! 
Here's one of the autos already!  Surely they can't be coming
so soon!  What time is it, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Half-past six," Gloriana answered, glancing at an open watch
that lay on the library table.</p>

<p>"Half-past nothing!" cried Vera, tumbling hastily into the room
with her eyes as big as saucers.  "It is almost eight o'clock!"</p>

<p>"You are joking!" cried the rest of the group in wild alarm.</p>

<p>"Am not!  True as you're alive, the kitchen clock says a quarter
of eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"Oho!" murmured Myra guilty.  "I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>really, I
forgot<hr>"</p>

<p>"Forgot what?" they demanded, as she doubled up and shrieked
with laughter.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I must have set all the watches in the crowd behind
time," she managed to explain at length.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Last night."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Just a joke."</p>

<p>"A joke?  I can't see any joke about that!" spluttered Jessie
indignantly.  "Did you think we wanted to go for a forty-mile
auto ride on empty stomachs?  I'm as hungry as a bear this minute."</p>

<p>"I am awfully sorry," cried Myra penitently, sobering at the
realization of just what would be the outcome of her joke.  "I
meant to set them two hours ahead, so you would all get up at
daybreak and be ready long before the autos came."</p>

<p>"Just like you!" they exclaimed, half amused, half provoked. 
"What are you going to do about it now?"</p>

<p>"What can we do?  The autos are here already with the rest of
the people.  There are the Carsons and here comes Miss Pomeroy."</p>

<p>"And there is Tabitha's father in his new machine."</p>

<p>"Yes, and mine," said Myra.  "My! won't he be mad to think we
aren't even dressed?  If there is one thing above another that
he abominates, it is having to wait for a woman to get ready to
go somewhere.  Well, I suppose I'll have to break the news to
him.  Then after you have all gone home again, won't I get the
dickens?"</p>

<p>"Hold on!" cried Tabitha, as Myra started for the door.  "There
is no need of that, is there?  I've got a brilliant inspiration. 
Didn't you say when you investigated the larder last night that
your aunt must have baked just a-purpose for our visit?"</p>

<p>"Yes, words to that effect.  There is a whole crock full of doughnuts
and another of cookies.  She must have had baking day just before
she decided to take her little trip.  But why?"</p>

<p>"We'll just fill our pockets<hr>"</p>

<p>"Haven't any!"</p>

<p>"Well, our hands, then, and eat our breakfast on the sly."</p>

<p>"On the <em>fly</em> you mean," said Gwynne, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"To be exact, yes.  Or perhaps it would be better to pretend
that we just found the supplies as we were about to leave the
house.  That will be the truth, so far as the most of us are concerned. 
Won't it?"</p>

<p>"But cookies and doughnuts are pretty slim fare for hungry bodies,"
grumbled Vera, tugging at an unruly collar.</p>

<p>"Better than nothing," said Bessie cheerfully.  "Dinner will
taste all the better."</p>

<p>"But we aren't ready," objected Julia, slipping the last hairpin
in the heavy coil at the back of her head.  "My shoes aren't buttoned
yet, and I can't scare up a hook in the whole outfit."</p>

<p>"Bring 'em in your hand, then," suggested Gwynne.  "I'm ready
now, and I elect myself commissary general to distribute the rations
as you pass out.  Who'll be first in line?  Gather up your bedding,
Jessie, and stack it in the corner, else Myra's aunt will think
tramps camped here instead of civilized human beings.  Now, are
you all clothed and in your right minds?  Then, Grace, poke your
head out of the window and announce to the audience that we will
be out in a minute.  Where are your hats and coats?  Yes, Kate,
there'll be time for you to wash your face if you haven't been
able to do so before.  Look pleasant, please! No one must suspect
that we've had no breakfast; but in my mind's eye, I can see this
bunch stowing away their dinner three or four hours from now. 
Hope they serve it as soon as we get there.  Do you suppose there
will be enough to go around?  How far did you say it was, Myra? 
Forty miles?"</p>

<p>Laughing and joking, the dozen hungry, breakfastless girls hurried
into their coats and veils, seized their pitifully small allotment
of doughnuts and cookies, and boisterously climbed aboard the
autos waiting for them.</p>

<p>"Only ten minutes late by actual count," Mr. Haskell complimented
them, as the merry crowd poured out of the door.</p>

<p>"Well, well, that's doing fine!  How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"It's all Myra's fault," began Vera plaintively, but Myra, fearful
that she was about to be betrayed, hastily asked, "Where is the
dinner, Dad? Didn't mother tell you to bring<hr>"</p>

<p>"Some stuffed squabs, fruit and cake?  Yes, she did; and it's
packed in that trunk hitched onto the step there.  You'll have
to sit on it, I guess.  There doesn't seem to be quite room enough
to accommodate all the crowd."</p>

<p>This arrangement just suited Myra, who loved to romp like her
brothers; so she gleefully perched on top of the long, flat chest
strapped on one side of the auto, and the procession slowly set
out on its long journey.</p>

<p>"My! but it's a beautiful day," sighed Tabitha at length, her
eyes wandering from the fog-wet landscape below to the sky above,
where the blue was already chasing away the gray, as the sun struggled
up behind the eastern hills.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you so?" crowed Gwynne, regretfully studying the
last bite of a doughnut before popping it into her mouth.  "It
doesn't rain in California.  Is this the river we cross eighteen
times, Myra, in order to reach your ranch?"</p>

<p>"Only eight," mumbled Myra, with her mouth full of cookie crumbs.
"This is it.  Allow me to introduce you to the great<hr>"</p>

<p>"Great!" echoed Tabitha, looking down at the shallow, sluggish
stream with critical eyes.  "Is it <em>really</em> a river?  Looks
to me like the little puddles we used to sail boats in after a
heavy rain-storm back home when I was a little tot."</p>

<p>"It isn't very awe-inspiring now, is it?  But you should see
it in the spring after the rains.  It certainly can play havoc
then.  Changes its channel every two or three years, and causes
all sorts of damage.  What is the matter ahead there?"  Their
auto had slowed down suddenly, and now came to an abrupt halt
in the middle of the road.  "What has happened, Dad?"</p>

<p>"Carson's auto is stuck in the mud."</p>

<p>"Mud?"</p>

<p>"Well, the river-bed, if that suits you any better.  I'll get
out and see if I can help them<hr>"</p>

<p>"No need; they've started up again," said Tabitha, waving her
hand at Carrie and wishing that she had been fortunate enough
to get a seat in Mr. Carson's machine.</p>

<p>The delayed procession started onward again, and without further
difficulty crossed the muddy river-bed and sped swiftly away down
the smooth road on the other side.  But that same river had to
be reckoned with seven more times, and each time at least one
of the cars sank in the treacherous mud and had to be dug out.</p>

<p>"Well, thank fortune, this is the last time we cross!" breathed
Myra, as they approached the winding river for the eighth time. 
"Ours is the only auto that hasn't stuck fast so far.  Let her
out, Dad, and we'll be on the other bank in a jiffy.  I never
knew the river to be so high at this season of the year."</p>

<p>"Knock on wood, Myra, knock on wood!" cried Gwynne in mock alarm. 
"Too late, we've stuck fast!  Why on earth couldn't you wait until
we had safely reached the other side before you commenced bragging?"</p>

<p>"Huh!  You superstitious duck, did you think we could escape? 
Oh, pshaw, we're out!  Not even the fun of having to be helped
across like the others were!  Well, never mind, Mr. Catt's machine
is sure to stick again.  It has every time so far.  There, didn't
I tell you?  Hurrah! Watch your father puff, Kitty.  Ain't he
a sight?  Get out your shovel, Mr. Catt!"</p>

<p>Myra was excitedly dancing on the lid of the luncheon-filled
chest, as she hung precariously over the back of the tonneau,
and bawled her remarks at the unfortunate occupants of the auto
behind them, which seemed to sink deeper and deeper in the mire
with every effort to dig her out.</p>

<p>"Fasten this rope to your car and we'll try dragging you out,"
finally suggested the ponderous Mr. Haskell, clambering heavily
down from his seat at the wheel and going to the aid of his unlucky
neighbor, who was not yet much skilled in the art of running an
automobile.  So they tied the two cars together with a heavy rope,
and tried to drag the captive machine loose, but without success.</p>

<p>"Let me drive," suggested Myra, after they had tugged in vain
for several minutes, "and you get out and pull on the rope, too."</p>

<p>"What good will that do?" growled her father crossly.  "If sixty
horse power won't budge the thing, do you suppose man's puny strength
will?"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he crawled out of his seat once more, and seized
the great rope dangling between the two cars.  Mr. Catt, resigning
his wheel to the driver of the next machine in line, followed
Mr. Haskell's example, and with three or four of the other men
of the party, they added their strength to that of the machine,
and pulled with all their might.  Myra, at the wheel, was in her
element, and putting on full power, she gave the lever a vicious
jerk.  The car leaped forward like a thing alive, and bounded
up the opposite bank at break-neck speed.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she cried in triumph, "I knew I could get her started. 
I'm a bird!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddy," shrieked Tabitha's voice from the rear seat.  "Let
go, oh, let go!  Mr. Haskell, you'll be killed!"</p>

<p>"Myra, you chump!" hissed Gwynne in her ear.  "Shut that thing
off! The rope's bu'sted and you are dragging our precious men
folks uphill."</p>

<p>Myra glanced hastily behind her, reversed the wheel, and as the
car came to a standstill, she sprawled across the seat, doubled
up with merriment, half hysterical.  "Oh, didn't they look funny
hanging onto that rope?  What fools some mortals be!  Why didn't
they let go?  Bet Dad's got his nose skinned good, for when I
looked back, he was plowing up the road on his head.  Is he hurt? 
I don't dast to ask!  Mr. Catt, your clothes are pretty dusty."</p>

<p>"Dusty I'll admit, but not very pretty," he smiled grimly, as
he wiped the perspiration from his grimy face.  "However, you
got the car out of the rut, so perhaps we can proceed on our way
now."</p>

<p>"Then it might be wise if I resigned my seat to the chauffeur
before I am requested," chuckled Myra, still laughing immoderately
at thought of her father's undignified attitude as he was dragged
through the dust, clinging desperately to the frayed end of the
broken rope.  So she scrambled nimbly to her place on the running
board, and there Mr. Haskell found her sitting prim and decorous
when he had finally recovered his breath and made himself sufficiently
presentable to face the rest of the party.</p>

<p>"Your nose is a little&mdash;soiled," she told him, as he climbed
stiffly into his seat, "and somewhat scrubbed, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Her voice shook a little in spite of her efforts to control her
mirth, and he scowled darkly at his irrepressible daughter, though
he only said, "Are you all ready?"</p>

<p>So again the procession of autos took up their journey, and with
no further accident finally reached the great walnut ranch where
the Haskell family lived during the summer.  The rosy, smiling
mother greeted them from the veranda as the cars rolled up the
smooth driveway and unloaded at the door.  "You are late," she
said cheerily.  "Did you have any mishaps?  I knew you would be
hungry after your long ride, so we are serving dinner early. 
Dave, did you get the squabs all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did," Myra answered.  "I sat on them all the way out
here. Dad, bring on the 'eats'.  Why, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>Mr. Haskell stood in the driveway frowning heavily at the car,
much as he might have done at a naughty little boy.  At Myra's
boisterous call, he raised his eyes and inquired, "Where <em>are</em>
the 'eats'?"</p>

<p>"In the chest, of course.  What do you&mdash;"  Her voice died away
in a husky, bewildered squeak.  The rest of the party came closer,
followed the direction of her glance, and gasped.  The hamper
full of stuffed squabs was gone!</p>

<p>"Well, of all things!" cried Gwynne, when the silence was becoming
oppressive.  "How could it have happened?"</p>

<p>"With Myra sitting on it!" chorused the girls.</p>

<p>"Didn't you miss it?"</p>

<p>"N-o."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, that's one on you, Miss Haskell," laughed Mr. Carson.
"<em>Sitting</em> on the lunch box and never missed it when it
tumbled overboard.  How did <em>you</em> manage to stick on?"</p>

<p>"How did the other machines manage to come along behind us and
never find it?" retorted Myra, nettled at the hilarity of her
companions. "<em>That</em> is the question!"</p>

<p>"We must have lost it in the river," suggested Tabitha.</p>

<p>"Of course!  When we were trying to pull out the other machine
and I shaved Dad's nose.  Didn't I do a good job, Mumsie?  Must
we go hungry now because I lost all your little stuffed scrubs,
&mdash;I mean squabs?" Anxiously she turned toward her mother
and scanned that sober face, for her eighteen hour fast had left
her half famished, and there were at least eleven other girls
in the same boat, all because of her stupid attempt at joking.</p>

<p>"We-ll, I have cooked a kettle of new potatoes and another of
green corn,&mdash;plenty of both.  But it looks as if you must go without
meat."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can get along nicely, I know.  Vegetables are better
than meat anyway, you know.  Come on, let's eat!"  At that moment
she felt hungry enough to swallow the dishes themselves, and anything
sounded appetizing to her.  As the rest of the party were equally
as hungry, they were not slow to respond to her invitation, and
in a very short time the tables were stripped; but the ravenous
appetites were appeased, and the little company scattered in groups
about the ranch to enjoy the few brief hours of their stay.</p>

<p>The return trip was as tame as the first part of the journey
had been exciting, for not a single car stuck once, and just as
the city clocks were striking nine, the tired, sunburned, but
blissfully happy girls again found themselves entering Mrs. Cummings'
deserted house, where they were to spend this last night before
Ivy Hall opened its doors to receive them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Kit, your father gave me a letter for you, hours ago," suddenly
exclaimed Myra in dismay, as they were unrolling their blankets
ready for bed, and she dragged forth a crumpled envelope from
her blouse and presented it to her surprised companion.  "I'm
so sorry I forgot it. Really, it's inexcusable in me."</p>

<p>"It's of little consequence," Tabitha assured her, scanning the
unfamiliar handwriting with puzzled eyes.  "I don't know anyone
in Boston.  Oh, it's from Billiard and Toady, I reckon.  They
live at Jamaica Plains, and&mdash;why, there's money in it!  One hundred
dollars. What in the world&mdash;  Will you listen to this, girls? 
You know I told you about their getting part of the reward for
helping capture the bank robbers in Silver Bow?  Well, they are
sending it back and want to know if it's enough to give Mercedes
another year at Ivy Hall."</p>

<p>A deep hush fell upon the group of tired, sleepy girls preparing
for the night.  Each maid recalled with a twinge of conscience
the picture of quiet, sober-faced Mercedes McKittrick, as she
had said good-bye to them that last day of school.  "I can never
forget any of you," she had said shyly, "and I'm glad of that,
for it's nice to remember pleasant times when you can't have any
more."  They had not understood then, but now they knew it was
her way of renouncing the happy school days which she must give
up because of her father's illness; and they were ashamed of their
indifference.</p>

<p>"I'll add fifty dollars of the check Uncle Jerry gave me," whispered
Gloriana, breaking the painful silence at last.</p>

<p>"And there's my birthday money in the bank," said Tabitha.  "That's
another fifty."</p>

<p>"Oh, if only I hadn't spent my allowance for clothes that I didn't
need!" groaned Myra.  "But I still have nine dollars and ninety-nine
cents left.  Can anyone make it an even ten?  Ivy Hall will be
open to us to-morrow, and school begins Monday.  I can get along
nicely on my nerve until my next allowance comes in.  Here, let's
pass the hat."</p>

<p>"Me, first!" cried Bessie enthusiastically, reaching for her
purse. "I'll give ten dollars."</p>

<p>"My money is <em>all</em> gone," mourned Grace, "but I'll <em>promise</em>
ten dollars if you will take pledges."</p>

<p>In utter amazement Tabitha sat curled up on her pile of blankets,
watching the shower of gold and silver which poured into her lap. 
"Oh, girls," she gasped, when she could find her tongue.  "How
can I ever thank you?  Mercy will be transported with joy.  Here's
more than enough to pay all her expenses, and Carrie will want
a share in it, too.  Aren't friends splendid!"  Her voice was
husky and tremulous, and two bright drops glistened in her black
eyes.  What a beautiful world this is to live in!  Somehow, the
spontaneous gift to little Mercedes seemed a gift to her also,
and she thoroughly appreciated the loving act of her classmates. 
What a beautiful climax to her summer vacation!</p>

<p>Jessie sniffed audibly, and Vera surreptitiously wiped a big
tear off the end of her nose.  Myra, who hated scenes, brought
the group back to the earth with a thump, saying briskly, "Come,
let's to bed!  I'm half dead already, and my face is smarting
like sin.  I don't like your cold cream, Kitty."</p>

<p>"Cold cream?" repeated Tabitha in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, I helped myself to the contents of the jar I found in your
suitcase.  No one else had any, and my face was burned to a frazzle."</p>

<p>"Did you put that stuff on your face?" screamed Tabitha, holding
up a tiny white jar of creamy paste.</p>

<p>"Sure.  Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it's corn salve.  No wonder it smarts.  Go wash<hr>"</p>

<p>But Myra waited to hear no more.  There was a wild scamper of
bare feet on the hall floor, the bath-room door banged noisily,
water splashed vigorously, and just as the girls were drifting
off to sleep, they heard Myra, snuggling down in her blankets,
murmur sadly, "It's lucky the Hall opens to-morrow.  Otherwise
these girls would soon be the death of me."</p>
