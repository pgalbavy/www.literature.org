<p>Beginning at the beginning and learning from the ground up was
a long course for Bibbs at the sanitarium, with milk and "zwieback"
as the basis of instruction; and the months were many and tiresome
before he was considered near enough graduation to go for a walk
leaning on a nurse and a cane. These and subsequent months saw
the planning, the building, and the completion of the New House;
and it was to that abode of Bigness that Bibbs was brought when
the cane, without the nurse, was found sufficient to his support.</p>

<p>Edith met him at the station. "Well, well, Bibbs!" she said,
as he came slowly through the gates, the last of all the travelers
from that train. She gave his hand a brisk little shake, averting
her eyes after a quick glance at him, and turning at once toward
the passage to the street. "Do you think they ought to've let
you come? You certainly don't look well!"</p>

<p>"But I certainly do look better," he returned, in a voice as
slow as his gait; a drawl that was a necessity, for when Bibbs
tried to speak quickly he stammered. "Up to about a month ago
it took two people to see me. They had to get me in a line between
'em!"</p>

<p>Edith did not turn her eyes directly toward him again, after
her first quick glance; and her expression, in spite of her, showed
a faint, troubled distaste, the look of a healthy person pressed
by some obligation of business to visit a "bad" ward in a hospital.
She was nineteen, fair and slim, with small, unequal features,
but a prettiness of color and a brilliancy of eyes that created
a total impression close upon beauty. Her movements were eager
and restless: there was something about her, as kind old ladies
say, that was very sweet; and there was something that was hurried
and breathless. This was new to Bibbs; it was a perceptible change
since he had last seen her, and he bent upon her a steady, whimsical
scrutiny as they stood at the curb, waiting for an automobile
across the street to disengage itself from the traffic.</p>

<p>"That's the new car," she said. "Everything's new. We've got
four now, besides Jim's. Roscoe's got two."</p>

<p>"Edith, you look&mdash;" he began, and paused.</p>

<p>"Oh, WE're all well," she said, briskly; and then, as if something
in his tone had caught her as significant, "Well, <em>HOW </em>do
I look, Bibbs?"</p>

<p>"You look&mdash;" He paused again, taking in the full length of her&mdash;her
trim brown shoes, her scant, tapering, rough skirt, and her coat
of brown and green, her long green tippet and her mad little rough
hat in the mad mode&mdash;all suited to the October day.</p>

<p>"How do I look?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"You look," he answered, as his examination ended upon an incrusted
watch of platinum and enamel at her wrist, "you look&mdash;expensive!"
That was a substitute for what he intended to say, for her constraint
and preoccupation, manifested particularly in her keeping her
direct glance away from him, did not seem to grant the privilege
of impulsive intimacies.</p>

<p>"I expect I am!" she laughed, and sidelong caught the direction
of his glance. "Of course I oughtn't to wear it in the daytime&mdash;it's
an evening thing, for the theater&mdash;but my day wrist-watch is out
of gear. Bobby Lamhorn broke it yesterday; he's a regular rowdy
sometimes. Do you want Claus to help you in?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Bibbs. "I'm alive." And after a fit of panting
subsequent to his climbing into the car unaided, he added, "Of
course, I have to <em>TELL </em>people!"</p>

<p>"We only got your telegram this morning," she said, as they began
to move rapidly through the "wholesale district" neighboring the
station. "Mother said she'd hardly expected you this month."</p>

<p>"They seemed to be through with me up there in the country,"
he explained, gently. "At least they said they were, and they
wouldn't keep me any longer, because so many really sick people
wanted to get in. They told me to go home&mdash;and I didn't have any
place else to go. It'll be all right, Edith; I'll sit in the woodshed
until after dark every day."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" She laughed nervously. "Of course we're all of us glad
to have you back."</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said. "Father?"</p>

<p>"Of course! Didn't he write and tell you to come home?" She did
not turn to him with the question. All the while she rode with
her face directly forward.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "father hasn't written."</p>

<p>She flushed a little. "I expect I ought to've written sometime,
or one of the boys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no; that was all right."</p>

<p>"You can't think how busy we've all been this year, Bibbs. I
often planned to write&mdash;and then, just as I was going to, something
would turn up. And I'm sure it's been just the same way with Jim
and Roscoe. Of course we knew mamma was writing often and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course!" he said, readily. "There's a chunk of coal fallen
on your glove, Edith. Better flick it off before it smears. My
word! I'd almost forgotten how sooty it is here."</p>

<p>"We've been having very bright weather this month&mdash;for us." She
blew the flake of soot into the air, seeming relieved.</p>

<p>He looked up at the dingy sky, wherein hung the disconsolate
sun like a cold tin pan nailed up in a smoke-house by some lunatic,
for a decoration. "Yes," said Bibbs. "It's very gay." A few moments
later, as they passed a corner, "Aren't we going home?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, yes! Did you want to go somewhere else first?"</p>

<p>"No. Your new driver's taking us out of the way, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"No. This is right. We're going straight home."</p>

<p>"But we've passed the corner. We always turned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" she cried. "Didn't you know we'd moved? Didn't
you know we were in the New House?"</p>

<p>"Why, no!" said Bibbs. "Are you?"</p>

<p>"We've been there a month! Good gracious! Didn't you know&mdash;"
She broke off, flushing again, and then went on hastily: "Of course,
mamma's never been so busy in her life; we <em>ALL </em>haven't
had time to do anything but keep on the hop. Mamma couldn't even
come to the station to-day. Papa's got some of his business friends
and people from around the <em>OLD-</em>house neighborhood coming
to-night for a big dinner and 'house-warming'&mdash;dreadful kind of
people&mdash;but mamma's got it all on her hands. She's never sat down
a <em>MINUTE; </em>and if she did, papa would have her up again
before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Bibbs. "Do you like the new place, Edith?"</p>

<p>"I don't like some of the things father <em>WOULD </em>have in
it, but it's the finest house in town, and that ought to be good
enough for me! Papa bought one thing I like&mdash;a view of the Bay
of Naples in oil that's perfectly beautiful; it's the first thing
you see as you come in the front hall, and it's eleven feet long.
But he would have that old fruit picture we had in the Murphy
Street house hung up in the new dining-room. You remember it&mdash;a
table and a watermelon sliced open, and a lot of rouged-looking
apples and some shiny lemons, with two dead prairie-chickens on
a chair? He bought it at a furniture-store years and years ago,
and he claims it's a finer picture than any they saw in the museums,
that time he took mamma to Europe. But it's horribly out of date
to have those things in dining-rooms, and I caught Bobby Lamhorn
giggling at it; and Sibyl made fun of it, too, with Bobby, and
then told papa she agreed with him about its being such a fine
thing, and said he did just right to insist on having it where
he wanted it. She makes me tired! Sibyl!"</p>

<p>Edith's first constraint with her brother, amounting almost to
awkwardness, vanished with this theme, though she still kept her
full gaze always to the front, even in the extreme ardor of her
denunciation of her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>"<em>SIBYL!" </em>she repeated, with such heat and vigor that
the name seemed to strike fire on her lips. "I'd like to know
why Roscoe couldn't have married somebody from <em>HERE </em>that
would have done us some good! He could have got in with Bobby
Lamhorn years ago just as well as now, and Bobby'd have introduced
him to the nicest girls in town, but instead of that he had to
go and pick up this Sibyl Rink! I met some awfully nice people
from her town when mamma and I were at Atlantic City, last spring,
and not one had ever heard of the Rinks! Not even <em>HEARD </em>of
'em!"</p>

<p>"I thought you were great friends with Sibyl," Bibbs said.</p>

<p>"Up to the time I found her out!" the sister returned, with continuing
vehemence. "I've found out some things about Mrs. Roscoe Sheridan
lately&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's only lately?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" Edith hesitated, her lips setting primly. "Of course,
I always did see that she never cared the snap of her little finger
about <em>ROSCOE</em>!"</p>

<p>"It seems," said Bibbs, in laconic protest, "that she married
him."</p>

<p>The sister emitted a shrill cry, to be interpreted as contemptuous
laughter, and, in her emotion, spoke too impulsively: "Why, she'd
have married <em>YOU</em>!"</p>

<p>"No, no," he said; "she couldn't be that bad!"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean&mdash;" she began, distressed. "I only meant &mdash;I
didn't mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Edith," he consoled her. "You see, she couldn't
have married me, because I didn't know her; and besides, if she's
as mercenary as all that she'd have been too clever. The head
doctor even had to lend me the money for my ticket home."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean anything unpleasant about <em>YOU," </em>Edith
babbled. "I only meant I thought she was the kind of girl who
was so simply crazy to marry somebody she'd have married anybody
that asked her."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Bibbs, "it's all straight." And, perceiving
that his sister's expression was that of a person whose adroitness
has set matters perfectly to rights, he chuckled silently.</p>

<p>"Roscoe's perfectly lovely to her," she continued, a moment later.
"Too lovely! If he'd wake up a little and lay down the law, some
day, like a <em>MAN, I </em>guess she'd respect him more and learn
to behave herself!"</p>

<p>"'Behave'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I mean she's so insincere," said Edith, characteristically
evasive when it came to stating the very point to which she had
led, and in this not unique of her sex.</p>

<p>Bibbs contented himself with a non-committal gesture. "Business
is crawling up the old streets," he said, his long, tremulous
hand indicating a vasty structure in course of erection. "The
boarding-houses come first and then the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That isn't for shops," she informed him. "That's a new investment
of papa's&mdash;the 'Sheridan Apartments.'"</p>

<p>"Well, well," he murmured. "I supposed 'Sheridan' was almost
well enough known here already."</p>

<p>"Oh, we're well enough known <em>ABOUT!" </em>she said, impatiently.
"I guess there isn't a man, woman, child, or nigger baby in town
that doesn't know who we are. But we aren't in with the right
people."</p>

<p>"No!" he exclaimed. "Who's all that?"</p>

<p>"Who's all what?"</p>

<p>"The 'right people.'"</p>

<p>"You know what I mean: the best people, the old families&mdash;the
people that have the real social position in this town and that
know they've got it."</p>

<p>Bibbs indulged in his silent chuckle again; he seemed greatly
amused. "I thought that the people who actually had the real what-you-may-call-it
didn't know it," he said. "I've always understood that it was
very unsatisfactory, because if you thought about it you didn't
have it, and if you had it you didn't know it."</p>

<p>"That's just bosh," she retorted. "They know it in this town,
all right! I found out a lot of things, long before we began to
think of building out in this direction. The right people in this
town aren't always the society-column ones, and they mix around
with outsiders, and they don't all belong to any one club&mdash;they're
taken in all sorts into all their clubs&mdash;but they're a clan, just
the same; and they have the clan feeling and they're just as much
We, Us and Company as any crowd you read about anywhere in the
world. Most of 'em were here long before papa came, and the grandfathers
of the girls of my age knew each other, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see," Bibbs interrupted, gravely. "Their ancestors fled together
from many a stricken field, and Crusaders' blood flows in their
veins. I always understood the first house was built by an old
party of the name of Vertrees who couldn't get along with Dan'l
Boone, and hurried away to these parts because Dan'l wanted him
to give back a gun he'd lent him."</p>

<p>Edith gave a little ejaculation of alarm. "You mustn't repeat
that story, Bibbs, even if it's true. The Vertreeses are <em>THE
</em>best family, and of course the very oldest here; they were
an old family even before Mary Vertrees's great-great-grandfather
came west and founded this settlement. He came from Lynn, Massachusetts,
and they have relatives there <em>YET&mdash;</em>some of the best people
in Lynn!"</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed Bibbs, incredulously.</p>

<p>"And there are other old families like the Vertreeses," she went
on, not heeding him; "the Lamhorns and the Kittersbys and the
J. Palmerston Smiths&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Strange names to me," he interrupted. "Poor things! None of
them have my acquaintance."</p>

<p>"No, that's just it!" she cried. "And papa had never even heard
the name of Vertrees! Mrs. Vertrees went with some anti-smoke
committee to see him, and he told her that smoke was what made
her husband bring home his wages from the pay-roll on Saturday
night! HE told us about it, and I thought I just couldn't live
through the night, I was so ashamed! Mr. Vertrees has always lived
on his income, and papa didn't know him, of course. They're the
stiffist, most elegant people in the whole town. And to crown
it all, papa went and bought the next lot to the old Vertrees
country mansion&mdash;it's in the very heart of the best new residence
district now, and that's where the New House is, right next door
to them&mdash;and I must say it makes their place look rather shabby!
I met Mary Vertrees when I joined the Mission Service Helpers,
but she never did any more than just barely bow to me, and since
papa's break I doubt if she'll do that! They haven't called."</p>

<p>"And you think if I spread this gossip about Vertrees the First
stealing Dan'l Boone's gun, the chances that they <em>WILL </em>call&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Papa knows what a break he made with Mrs. Vertrees. I made him
understand that," said Edith, demurely, "and he's promised to
try and meet Mr. Vertrees and be nice to him. It's just this way:
if we don't know <em>THEM, </em>it's practically no use in our
having build the New House; and if we DO know them and they're
decent to us, we're right with the right people. They can do the
whole thing for us. Bobby Lamhorn told Sibyl he was going to bring
his mother to call on her and on mamma, but it was weeks ago,
and I notice he hasn't done it; and if Mrs. Vertrees decides not
to know us, I'm darn sure Mrs Lamhorn'll never come. That's <em>ONE
</em>thing Sibyl didn't manage! She <em>SAID </em>Bobby offered
to bring his mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You say he is a friend of Roscoe's?" Bibbs asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a friend of the whole family," she returned, with a
petulance which she made an effort to disguise. "Roscoe and he
got acquainted somewhere, and they take him to the theater about
every other night. Sibyl has him to lunch, too, and keeps&mdash;" She
broke off with an angry little jerk of the head. "We can see the
New House from the second corner ahead. Roscoe has built straight
across the street from us, you know. Honestly, Sibyl makes me
think of a snake, sometimes&mdash;the way she pulls the wool over people's
eyes! She honeys up to papa and gets anything in the world she
wants out of him, and then makes fun of him behind his back&mdash;yes,
and to his face, but HE can't see it! She got him to give her
a twelve-thousand-dollar porch for their house after it was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said Bibbs, staring ahead as they reached the
corner and the car swung to the right, following a bend in the
street. "Is that the New House?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"Well," he drawled, "I'm pretty sure the sanitarium's about half
a size bigger; I can't be certain till I measure."</p>

<p>And a moment later, as they entered the driveway, he added, seriously:
"But it's beautiful!"</p>
