1. THE BIOLOGICAL EQUIVALENT OF SIN
<P>
<P>
If the reader who is unfamiliar with scientific things will obtain 
and read Metchnikoff's "Nature of Man," he will find there an 
interesting summary of the biological facts that bear upon and 
destroy the delusion that there is such a thing as individual 
perfection, that there is even ideal perfection for humanity.  With 
an abundance of convincing instances Professor Metchnikoff 
demonstrates that life is a system of "disharmonies," capable of no 
perfect way, that there is no "perfect" dieting, no "perfect" sexual 
life, no "perfect" happiness, no "perfect" conduct.  He releases one 
from the arbitrary but all too easy assumption that there is even an 
ideal "perfection" in organic life.  He sweeps out of the mind with 
all the confidence and conviction of a physiological specialist, any 
idea that there is a perfect man or a conceivable perfect man.  It 
is in the nature of every man to fall short at every point from 
perfection.  From the biological point of view we are as individuals 
a series of involuntary "tries" on the part of an imperfect species 
towards an unknown end.
<P>
Our spiritual nature follows our bodily as a glove follows a hand.  
We are disharmonious beings and salvation no more makes an end to 
the defects of our souls than it makes an end to the decay of our 
teeth or to those vestigial structures of our body that endanger our 
physical welfare.  Salvation leaves us still disharmonious, and adds 
not an inch to our spiritual and moral stature.
<P>
<P>
<P>
2. WHAT IS DAMNATION?
<P>
<P>
Let us now take up the question of what is Sin? and what we mean by 
the term "damnation," in the light of this view of human reality.  
Most of the great world religions are as clear as Professor 
Metchnikoff that life in the world is a tangle of disharmonies, and 
in most cases they supply a more or less myth-like explanation, they 
declare that evil is one side of the conflict between Ahriman and 
Ormazd, or that it is the punishment of an act of disobedience, of 
the fall of man and world alike from a state of harmony.  Their 
case, like his, is that THIS world is damned.
<P>
We do not find the belief that superposed upon the miseries of this 
world there are the still bitterer miseries of punishments after 
death, so nearly universal.  The endless punishments of hell appear 
to be an exploit of theory; they have a superadded appearance even 
in the Christian system; the same common tendency to superlatives 
and absolutes that makes men ashamed to admit that God is finite, 
makes them seek to enhance the merits of their Saviour by the device 
of everlasting fire.  Conquest over the sorrow of life and the fear 
of death do not seem to them sufficient for Christ's glory.
<P>
Now the turning round of the modern mind from a conception of the 
universe as something derived deductively from the past to a 
conception of it as something gathering itself adventurously towards 
the future, involves a release from the supposed necessity to tell a 
story and explain why.  Instead comes the inquiry, "To what end?"  
We can say without mental discomfort, these disharmonies are here, 
this damnation is here--inexplicably.  We can, without any 
distressful inquiry into ultimate origins, bring our minds to the 
conception of a spontaneous and developing God arising out of those 
stresses in our hearts and in the universe, and arising to overcome 
them.  Salvation for the individual is escape from the individual 
distress at disharmony and the individual defeat by death, into the 
Kingdom of God.  And damnation can be nothing more and nothing less 
than the failure or inability or disinclination to make that escape.
<P>
Something of that idea of damnation as a lack of the will for 
salvation has crept at a number of points into contemporary 
religious thought.  It was the fine fancy of Swedenborg that the 
damned go to their own hells of their own accord.  It underlies a 
queer poem, "Simpson," by that interesting essayist upon modern 
Christianity, Mr. Clutton Brock, which I have recently read.  
Simpson dies and goes to hell--it is rather like the Cromwell Road--
and approves of it very highly, and then and then only is he 
completely damned.  Not to realise that one can be damned is 
certainly to be damned; such is Mr. Brock's idea.  It is his 
definition of damnation.  Satisfaction with existing things is 
damnation.  It is surrender to limitation; it is acquiescence in 
"disharmony"; it is making peace with that enemy against whom God 
fights for ever.
<P>
(But whether there are indeed Simpsons who acquiesce always and for 
ever remains for me, as I have already confessed in the previous 
chapter, a quite open question.  My Arminian temperament turns me 
from the Calvinistic conclusion of Mr. Brock's satire.)
<P>
<P>
<P>
3. SIN IS NOT DAMNATION
<P>
<P>
Now the question of sin will hardly concern those damned and lost by 
nature, if such there be.  Sin is not the same thing as damnation, 
as we have just defined damnation.  Damnation is a state, but sin is 
an incident.  One is an essential and the other an incidental 
separation from God.  It is possible to sin without being damned; 
and to be damned is to be in a state when sin scarcely matters, like 
ink upon a blackamoor.  You cannot have questions of more or less 
among absolute things.
<P>
It is the amazing and distressful discovery of every believer so 
soon as the first exaltation of belief is past, that one does not 
remain always in touch with God.  At first it seems incredible that 
one should ever have any motive again that is not also God's motive.  
Then one finds oneself caught unawares by a base impulse.  We 
discover that discontinuousness of our apparently homogeneous 
selves, the unincorporated and warring elements that seemed at first 
altogether absent from the synthesis of conversion.  We are tripped 
up by forgetfulness, by distraction, by old habits, by tricks of 
appearance.  There come dull patches of existence; those mysterious 
obliterations of one's finer sense that are due at times to the 
little minor poisons one eats or drinks, to phases of fatigue, ill-
health and bodily disorder, or one is betrayed by some unanticipated 
storm of emotion, brewed deep in the animal being and released by 
any trifling accident, such as personal jealousy or lust, or one is 
relaxed by contentment into vanity.  All these rebel forces of our 
ill-coordinated selves, all these "disharmonies," of the inner 
being, snatch us away from our devotion to God's service, carry us 
off to follies, offences, unkindness, waste, and leave us 
compromised, involved, and regretful, perplexed by a hundred 
difficulties we have put in our own way back to God.
<P>
This is the personal problem of Sin.  Here prayer avails; here God 
can help us.  From God comes the strength to repent and make such 
reparation as we can, to begin the battle again further back and 
lower down.  From God comes the power to anticipate the struggle 
with one's rebel self, and to resist and prevail over it.
<P>

4. THE SINS OF THE INSANE
<P>
<P>
An extreme case is very serviceable in such a discussion as this.
<P>
It happens that the author carries on a correspondence with several 
lunatics in asylums.  There is a considerable freedom of notepaper 
in these institutions; the outgoing letters are no doubt censored or 
selected in some way, but a proportion at any rate are allowed to go 
out to their addresses.  As a journalist who signs his articles and 
as the author of various books of fiction, as a frequent NAME, that 
is, to any one much forced back upon reading, the writer is 
particularly accessible to this type of correspondent.  The letters 
come, some manifesting a hopeless disorder that permits of no reply, 
but some being the expression of minds overlaid not at all 
offensively by a web of fantasy, and some (and these are the more 
touching ones and the ones that most concern us now) as sanely 
conceived and expressed as any letters could be.  They are written 
by people living lives very like the lives of us who are called 
"sane," except that they lift to a higher excitement and fall to a 
lower depression, and that these extremer phases of mania or 
melancholia slip the leash of mental consistency altogether and take 
abnormal forms.  They tap deep founts of impulse, such as we of the 
safer ways of mediocrity do but glimpse under the influence of 
drugs, or in dreams and rare moments of controllable extravagance.  
Then the insane become "glorious," or they become murderous, or they 
become suicidal.  All these letter-writers in confinement have 
convinced their fellow-creatures by some extravagance that they are 
a danger to themselves or others.
<P>
The letters that come from such types written during their sane 
intervals, are entirely sane.  Some, who are probably unaware--I 
think they should know--of the offences or possibilities that 
justify their incarceration, write with a certain resentment at 
their position; others are entirely acquiescent, but one or two 
complain of the neglect of friends and relations.  But all are as 
manifestly capable of religion and of the religious life as any 
other intelligent persons during the lucid interludes that make up 
nine-tenths perhaps of their lives. . . .  Suppose now one of these 
cases, and suppose that the infirmity takes the form of some cruel, 
disgusting, or destructive disposition that may become at times 
overwhelming, and you have our universal trouble with sinful 
tendency, as it were magnified for examination.  It is clear that 
the mania which defines his position must be the primary if not the 
cardinal business in the life of a lunatic, but his problem with 
that is different not in kind but merely in degree from the problem 
of lusts, vanities, and weaknesses in what we call normal lives.  It 
is an unconquered tract, a great rebel province in his being, which 
refuses to serve God and tries to prevent him serving God, and 
succeeds at times in wresting his capital out of his control.  But 
his relationship to that is the same relationship as ours to the 
backward and insubordinate parishes, criminal slums, and disorderly 
houses in our own private texture.
<P>
It is clear that the believer who is a lunatic is, as it were, only 
the better part of himself.  He serves God with this unconquered 
disposition in him, like a man who, whatever else he is and does, is 
obliged to be the keeper of an untrustworthy and wicked animal.  His 
beast gets loose.  His only resort is to warn those about him when 
he feels that jangling or excitement of the nerves which precedes 
its escapes, to limit its range, to place weapons beyond its reach.  
And there are plenty of human beings very much in his case, whose 
beasts have never got loose or have got caught back before their 
essential insanity was apparent.  And there are those uncertifiable 
lunatics we call men and women of "impulse" and "strong passions."  
If perhaps they have more self-control than the really mad, yet it 
happens oftener with them that the whole intelligent being falls 
under the dominion of evil.  The passion scarcely less than the 
obsession may darken the whole moral sky.  Repentance and atonement; 
nothing less will avail them after the storm has passed, and the 
sedulous preparation of defences and palliatives against the return 
of the storm.
<P>
This discussion of the lunatic's case gives us indeed, usefully 
coarse and large, the lines for the treatment of every human 
weakness by the servants of God.  A "weakness," just like the 
lunatic's mania, becomes a particular charge under God, a special 
duty for the person it affects.  He has to minimise it, to isolate 
it, to keep it out of mischief.  If he can he must adopt preventive 
measures. . . .
<P>
These passions and weaknesses that get control of us hamper our 
usefulness to God, they are an incessant anxiety and distress to us, 
they wound our self-respect and make us incomprehensible to many who 
would trust us, they discredit the faith we profess.  If they break 
through and break through again it is natural and proper that men 
and women should cease to believe in our faith, cease to work with 
us or to meet us frankly. . . .  Our sins do everything evil to us 
and through us except separate us from God.
<P>
Yet let there be no mistake about one thing.  Here prayer is a 
power.  Here God can indeed work miracles.  A man with the light of 
God in his heart can defeat vicious habits, rise again combative and 
undaunted after a hundred falls, escape from the grip of lusts and 
revenges, make head against despair, thrust back the very onset of 
madness.  He is still the same man he was before he came to God, 
still with his libidinous, vindictive, boastful, or indolent vein; 
but now his will to prevail over those qualities can refer to an 
exterior standard and an external interest, he can draw upon a 
strength, almost boundless, beyond his own.
<P>
<P>
<P>
5. BELIEVE, AND YOU ARE SAVED
<P>
<P>
But be a sin great or small, it cannot damn a man once he has found 
God.  You may kill and hang for it, you may rob or rape; the moment 
you truly repent and set yourself to such atonement and reparation 
as is possible there remains no barrier between you and God.  
Directly you cease to hide or deny or escape, and turn manfully 
towards the consequences and the setting of things right, you take 
hold again of the hand of God.  Though you sin seventy times seven 
times, God will still forgive the poor rest of you.  Nothing but 
utter blindness of the spirit can shut a man off from God.
<P>
There is nothing one can suffer, no situation so unfortunate, that 
it can shut off one who has the thought of God, from God.  If you 
but lift up your head for a moment out of a stormy chaos of madness 
and cry to him, God is there, God will not fail you.  A convicted 
criminal, frankly penitent, and neither obdurate nor abject, 
whatever the evil of his yesterdays, may still die well and bravely 
on the gallows to the glory of God.  He may step straight from that 
death into the immortal being of God.
<P>
This persuasion is the very essence of the religion of the true God.  
There is no sin, no state that, being regretted and repented of, can 
stand between God and man.
