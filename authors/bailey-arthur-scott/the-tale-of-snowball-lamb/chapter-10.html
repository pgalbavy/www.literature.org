<p>In the same pasture with Snowball was a black lamb. He was the black
lamb that Farmer Green once gave to Johnnie for a pet. But he ran away
up the lane the very first time Johnnie tried to hold him in his arms.
</p>
<p>After that the black lamb had always stayed with the flock. He was a
wild, unruly fellow, bigger and older than Snowball. And he was quite
outspoken--and not always careful of his language.
</p><p>This black lamb chanced to be near Snowball when Johnnie Green came into
the pasture on a certain fine morning. And when Johnnie began calling
to Snowball the black lamb said, "Why don't you run the other way?
That's what I always do when boys call me."
</p><p>Snowball made no answer. He stood and looked at Johnnie Green, who was
walking towards him with outstretched hand.
</p><p>"Come on!" cried the black lamb. "I'll run with you."
</p><p>"No!" said Snowball. "Johnnie may have something good for me to eat.
Some salt, maybe!"
</p><p>"Huh!" said the black lamb. "Don't be stupid! What if he has brought you
a little salt? He'll want you to jump through that hoop again for him,
the way he did yesterday." Snowball had told the black lamb about the
strange proceeding of the afternoon before.
</p><p>"Well--" Snowball murmured, as he hesitated, not knowing whether to
obey the black lamb or Johnnie Green.
</p><p>"Well! Are you coming with me?" the black lamb demanded. "<u>I'm</u> not
going to stay here where that boy can grab me. _I_ don't intend to spend
my time jumping through any old hoop. <u>I'm</u> not quite so silly as to do
that."
</p><p>"I believe I'll let Johnnie catch me," Snowball told him. "Johnnie said
something yesterday about our joining the circus. No doubt you've
noticed the circus posters on the side of the barn?"
</p><p>"I have," said the black lamb with something like a sneer. "No doubt
you've noticed the picture of the tiger?"
</p><p>"Yes, I have," Snowball admitted.
</p><p>"My uncle joined a circus once," said the black lamb.
</p><p>"Is that so?" cried Snowball. "Tell me--did he enjoy it?"
</p><p>"I can't say," the black lamb replied. "He never came back again. They
fed him to the tiger--so I have been told."
</p><p>And then the black lamb started to run. And suddenly Snowball whisked
about and followed him.
</p><p>Johnnie Green wondered what had come over Snowball. Was this the pet
that had once followed him all the way to school?
</p><p>"I'll keep him tied up in the barn for a few days--once I catch him,"
thought Johnnie. If he intended to teach circus tricks to Snowball he
certainly didn't want to spend valuable time chasing him all around the
pasture.
</p><p>At last Johnnie Green had Snowball cornered. At last he slipped a rope
about Snowball's neck. And then he led his pet towards the bars.
</p><p>"_Baa-a-a!_" called the black lamb.
</p><p>It sounded so much like a jeer that Johnnie turned around and made a
face at the black rascal.
</p><p>In the barnyard Johnnie brought forth a paper-covered hoop. He held it
up in front of Snowball. "Jump!" he cried.
</p><p>But Snowball drew back.
</p><p>"_Baa-a-a!_" he bleated. "How do I know that there isn't a tiger behind
that thing?"
</p><p>"Come!" Johnnie urged him. "Jump! Jump!"
</p><p>Snowball only moved further away.
</p><p>And then Johnnie Green lowered the paper-covered hoop and stepped
forward to grasp Snowball by his fleece.
</p><p>As Johnnie's hand let the hoop fall Snowball gave a frightened blat.
Staring right at him, and grinning horribly, was a tiger pasted upon the
side of the barn.
</p><p>Snowball turned and ran towards the gate.
