<p>A week or so after Anstruthers’ departure Georgie decided that her
visit must come to an end. Mamma was not so very well, and poor papa
had a touch of his old enemy, the gout; and, really she had been away
from home a long time. Did not Lisbeth think that they had better
return to London, even though Pen’yllan was still as delightful as ever?
</p><p>Then they had a surprise indeed.
</p><p>Lisbeth, who had been listening, in a rather absent manner, aroused
herself to astonish them.
</p><p>“I think,” she said, “that if you do not mind making the journey alone,
Georgie, I should like to stay in Pen’yllan this winter.”
</p><p>“In Pen’yllan?” cried Georgie. “All winter, Lisbeth?”
</p><p>“At Pen’yllan? Here? With us?” cried Miss Millicent, and Miss Hetty,
and Miss Clarissa, in chorus.
</p><p>“Yes,” answered Lisbeth, in her most non-committal fashion. “At
Pen’yllan, Aunt Hetty. Here, Aunt Millicent. With you, Aunt Clarissa.”
</p><p>The Misses Tregarthyn became quite pale. They glanced at each other,
and shook their heads, ominously. This portended something dreadful,
indeed.
</p><p>“My love,” faltered Miss Clarissa.
</p><p>“What?” interposed Lisbeth. “Won’t you let me stay? Are you tired of
me? I told you that you would be, you know, before I came.”
</p><p>“Oh, my dear!” protested Miss Clarissa. “How can you? Tired of you?
Sister Hetty, sister Millicent! Tired of her?”
</p><p>“We only thought, my love, that it would be so dull to one used to--to
the brilliant vortex of London society,” ended Miss Millicent, rather
grandly.
</p><p>“But if I think that it will not,” said Lisbeth. “I am tired of the
‘brilliant vortex of London society.’”
</p><p>She got up from her chair, and went and stood by Georgie, at the
window, looking out.
</p><p>“Yes,” she said, almost as if speaking to herself, “I think I should
like to stay.”
</p><p>The end of it was, that she did stay. She wrote to Mrs. Despard, that
very day, announcing her intention of remaining. Georgie, in packing
her trunks, actually shed a few silent tears among her ruffs and
ribbons. To her mind, this was a sad termination to her happy visit.
She knew that it must mean something serious, that there must be some
powerful motive at the bottom of such a resolution. If Lisbeth would
only not be so reserved. If it was only a little easier to understand
her.
</p><p>“We shall miss you very much, Lisbeth,” she ventured, mournfully.
</p><p>“Not more than I shall miss you,” answered Lisbeth, who at the time
stood near, watching her as she knelt before the box she was packing.
</p><p>Georgie paused in her task, to look up doubtfully.
</p><p>“Then why will you do it?” she said. “You--you must have a reason.”
</p><p>“Yes,” said Lisbeth, “I have a reason.”
</p><p>The girl’s eyes still appealed to her; so she went on, with a rather
melancholy smile:
</p><p>“I have two reasons--perhaps more. Pen’yllan agrees with me, and I do
not want to go back to town yet. I am going to take a rest. I must need
one, or Aunt Clarissa would not find so much fault with my appearance.
I don’t want to ‘go off on my looks,’ before my time, and you know they
are always telling me I am pale and thin. Am I pale and thin, Georgie?”
</p><p>“Yes,” confessed Georgie, “you are,” and she gave her a troubled look.
</p><p>“Then,” returned Lisbeth, “there is all the more reason that I should
rusticate. Perhaps, by the spring, I shall be red and fat, like Miss
Rosamond Puddifoot,” with a little laugh. “And I shall have taken to
tracts, and soup-kitchens, and given up the world, and wear a yellow
bonnet, and call London a ‘vortex of sinful pleasure,’ as she does.
Why, my dear Georgie, what is the matter?”
</p><p>The fact was, that a certain incongruity in her beloved Lisbeth’s
looks and tone, had so frightened Georgie, and touched her susceptible
heart, that the tears had rushed to her eyes, and she was filled with a
dolorous pity.
</p><p>“You are not--you are not happy,” she cried all at once. “You are not,
or you would not speak in that queer, satirical way. I wish you would
be a little--a little more--kind, Lisbeth.”
</p><p>Lisbeth’s look was a positively guilty one.
</p><p>“Kind!” she exclaimed. “Kind, Georgie!”
</p><p>Having gone so far, Georgie could not easily draw back, and was fain
to go on, though she became conscious that she had placed herself in a
very trying position.
</p><p>“It is not kind to keep everything to yourself so closely,” she
said, tremulously. “As if we did not care for you, or could not
comprehend----”
</p><p>She stopped, because Lisbeth frightened her again. She became so pale,
that it was impossible to say anything more. Her great, dark eyes
dilated, as if with a kind of horror, at something.
</p><p>“You--you think I have a secret,” she interrupted her, with a
hollow-sounding laugh. “And you are determined to make a heroine out
of me, instead of allowing me to enjoy my ‘nerves’ in peace. You don’t
comprehend ‘nerves,’ that is clear. You are running at a red rag,
Georgie, my dear. It is astonishing how prone you good, tender-hearted
people are to run at red rags, and toss, and worry them.”
</p><p>It was plain that she would never betray herself. She would hold at
arm’s-length even the creature who loved her best, and was most worthy
of her confidence. It was useless to try to win her to any revelation
of her feelings.
</p><p>Georgie fell to at her packing again, with a very melancholy
consciousness of the fact, that she had done no good by losing control
over her innocent emotions, and might have done harm. It had pained
her inexpressibly to see that quick dread of self-betrayal, which had
announced itself in the sudden loss of color, and the odd expression in
her friend’s eyes.
</p><p>“She does not love me as I love her,” was her pathetic, mental
conclusion. “If she did, she would not be so afraid of me.”
</p><p>When Lisbeth bade her good-by, at the little railway station, the
girl’s heart quite failed her.
</p><p>“What shall I say to mamma and papa?” she asked.
</p><p>“Tell them that Pen’yllan agrees with me so well that I don’t like to
leave it for the present,” was Lisbeth’s answer. “And tell Mrs. Esmond
that I will write to her myself.”
</p><p>“And--” in timid desperation--“and Hector, Lisbeth?”
</p><p>“Hector?” rather sharply. “Why Hector? What has he to do with the
matter? But stay!” shrugging her shoulders. “I suppose it would be only
civil. Tell him--tell him--that Aunt Clarissa sends her love, and hopes
he will take care of his lungs.”
</p><p>And yet, though this irreverent speech was her last, and she made it in
her most malicious manner, the delicate, dark face, and light, small
figure, had a strangely desolate look to Georgie, as, when the train
bore her away, she caught her last farewell glimpse of them on the
platform of the small station.
</p><p>Lisbeth stood before her mirror, that night, slowly brushing up her
hair, and feeling the silence of the small chamber acutely.
</p><p>“It would never have done,” she said to herself. “It would never have
done at all. This is the better way--better, by far.”
</p><p>But it was hard enough to face, and it was fantastic enough to think
that she had really determined to face it. In a minute or so she
sat down, with her brush in her hand, and her hair loose upon her
shoulders, to confront the facts once more. She was going to spend
her winter at Pen’yllan. She had given up the flesh-pots of Egypt.
She was going to breakfast at eight, dine at two when there was no
company, take five o’clock tea, and spend the evening with the Misses
Tregarthyn. She would stroll in the garden, walk on the beach, and take
Miss Clarissa’s medicines meekly. At this point a new view of the case
presented itself to her, and she began to laugh. Mustard baths, and
Dr. Puddifoot’s prescriptions, in incongruous connection with her own
personal knowledge of things, appeared all at once so ludicrous, that
they got the better of her, and she laughed until she found herself
crying; and then, angry as she was at her own weakness, the tears
got the better of her, too, for a short time. If she had never been
emotional before, she was emotional enough in these days. She could
not pride herself upon her immovability now. She felt, constantly,
either passionate anger against herself, or passionate contempt, or a
passionate eagerness to retrieve her lost self-respect. What could she
do? How could she rescue herself? This would not do! This would not
do! She must make some new struggle! This sort of thing she was saying
feverishly from morning until night.
</p><p>Secretly she had almost learned to detest Pen’yllan. Pen’yllan, she
told herself, had been the cause of all her follies; but it was safer
at present than London. If she stayed at Pen’yllan long enough, surely
she could wear herself out, or rather wear out her fancies. A less
resolute young woman would, in all likelihood, have trifled weakly with
her danger; but it was not so with Lisbeth. She had not trifled with it
from the first: she had held herself stubbornly aloof from any little
self-indulgence; and now she was harder upon herself than ever. She
would have died cheerfully, rather than have betrayed herself, and if
she could die, surely she could endure a dull winter.
</p><p>Her moral condition was so far improved, however, that she did not
visit her small miseries upon her aunts, as she would have done
in the olden days. Her behavior was really creditable, under the
circumstances. She played chess with Miss Clarissa in the evening, or
read aloud, or sung for them, and began to take a whimsical pleasure in
their delight at her condescension. They were so easily delighted, that
she felt many a sting of shame at her former delinquencies. She had an
almost morbid longing “to be good,” like Georgie, and she practiced
this being “good” upon the three spinsters, with a persistence at which
she herself both laughed and cried when she was alone. Her first letter
to Georgie puzzled the girl indescribably, and yet touched her somehow.
She, who believed her beloved Lisbeth to be perfect among women, could
not quite understand the psychological crisis through which she was
passing, and yet could not fail to feel that something unusual was
happening.
</p><p>“I take Aunt Clarissa’s medicine with a mild regularity which alarms
her,” the letter announced. “She thinks I must be going into a
consumption, and tearfully consults Dr. Puddifoot in private. The cook
is ordered to prepare particularly nourishing soups for dinner, and if
my appetite is not something startling, everybody turns pale. And yet
all this does not seem to me as good a joke as it would have done years
ago. I see another side to it. I wonder how it is that they can be so
fond of me. For my part, I am sure I could never have been fond of
Lisbeth Crespigny.”
