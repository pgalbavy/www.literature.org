<p>The course of irresponsible amusement which C. Bailey, Jr., continued
to pursue at intervals with the fair scion of the house&mdash;road-house&mdash;of
Greensleeve, did not run as smoothly as it might have, and was
not unmixed with carping reflections and sordid care on his part,
and with an increasing number of interruptions, admonitions, and
warnings on the part of his mother.</p>

<p>That pretty lady, flint-hardened in the igneous social lava-pot,
continued to hear disquieting tales of her son's doings. They
came to her right and left, from dance and card-table, opera-box
and supper party, tea and bazaar and fashionable reception.</p>

<p>One grim-visaged old harridan of whom Manhattan stood in fawning
fear, bluntly informed her that she'd better look out for her
boy if she didn't want to become a grandmother.</p>

<p>Which infuriated and terrified Mrs. Bailey and set her thinking
with all the implacable concentration of which she was capable.</p>

<p>So far in life she had accomplished whatever she set out to do....
And of all things on earth she dreaded most to become a grandmother
of any description whatever.</p>

<p>But between Athalie and Clive, if there had been any doubts concerning
the propriety or expediency of their companionship neither he
nor she had, so far, expressed them.</p>

<p>Their comradeship, in fact, had now become an intimacy&mdash;the sort
that permits long silences without excuse or embarrassment on
either side. She continued to charm and surprise him; and to discover,
daily, in him new traits to admire in a character which perhaps
he did not really possess.</p>

<p>In this girl he seemed to find an infinite variety. Moods, impulsive
or deliberate, and capricious or logical, continued to stimulate
his interest in her every time they met. On no two days was she
exactly the same&mdash;or so he seemed to think. And yet her basic
qualities were, it appeared to him, characteristic and unvarying,&mdash;directness,
loyalty, generosity, freedom from ulterior motive and a gay confidence
in a world which, for the first time in her life, she had begun
to find unexpectedly exciting.</p>

<p>They had been one evening to a musical comedy which by some fortunate
chance was well written, well sung, and well done. And they were
in excellent spirits as they left the theatre and stood waiting
for his small limousine car, she in her pretty furs held close
to her throat, humming under her breath a refrain from the delightful
finale, he smoking a cigarette and watching the numbers being
flashed for the long line of carriages and motors which moved
up continually through the lamp-lit darkness.</p>

<p>"Athalie," he said, "suppose we side-step the Regina and try
Broadway. Are you in the humour for it?"</p>

<p>She laughed and her eyes sparkled in the electric glow: "Are
you, Clive?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. I feel very devilish."</p>

<p>"So do I,&mdash;devilishly hungry."</p>

<p>"That's fine. Where shall we go?"</p>

<p>"The Café Arabesque?... The name sounds exciting."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;" as his car drew up and the gold-capped porter opened
the door;&mdash;so he directed his chauffeur to drive them to the Café
Arabesque.</p>

<p>"If you don't like it," he added to Athalie, drawing the fur
robe over her knees and his, "we can go somewhere else."</p>

<p>"That's very nice of you. I don't have to suffer for my mistakes."</p>

<p>"Nobody ever ought to suffer for mistakes because nobody would
ever make mistakes on purpose," he said, laughing.</p>

<p>"Such a delightful philosophy! Please remind me of it when I'm
in agony over something I'm sorry I did."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll have to remind me too," he said, still laughing.
"Is it a bargain?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>The car stopped; he sprang out and aided her to the icy sidewalk.</p>

<p>"I don't think I ever saw you as pretty as you are to-night,"
he whispered, slipping his arm under hers.</p>

<p>"<em>Are</em> you really growing more beautiful or do I merely
think so?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, happily; "I'll tell you a secret, shall
I?"</p>

<p>He inclined his ear toward her, and she said in a laughing whisper:
"Clive, I <em>feel</em> beautiful to-night. Do you know how it
feels to feel beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Not personally," he admitted; and they separated still laughing
like two children, the focus of sympathetic, amused, or envious
glances from the brilliantly dressed throng clustering at the
two cloak rooms.</p>

<p>She came to him presently where he was waiting, and, instinctively
the groups around the doors made a lane for the fair young girl
who came forward with the ghost of a smile on her lips as though
entirely unconscious of herself and of everybody except the man
who moved out to meet her.</p>

<p>"It's true," he murmured; "you <em>are</em> the most beautiful
thing in this beauty-ridden town."</p>

<p>"You'll spoil me, Clive."</p>

<p>"Is that possible?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Don't try. There is a great deal in me that has
never been disturbed, never been brought out. Maybe much of it
is evil," she added lightly.</p>

<p>He turned; she met his eyes half seriously, half mockingly, and
they laughed. But what she had said so lightly in jest remained
for a few moments in his mind to occupy and slightly trouble it.</p>

<p>From their table beside the bronze-railed gallery, they could
overlook the main floor where a wide lane for dancing had been
cleared and marked out with crimson-tasselled ropes of silk.</p>

<p>A noisy orchestra played imbecile dance music, and a number of
male and female imbeciles took advantage of it to exercise the
only portions of their anatomy in which any trace of intellect
had ever lodged.</p>

<p>Athalie, resting one dimpled elbow on the velvet cushioned rail,
watched the dancers for a while, then her unamused and almost
expressionless gaze swept the tables below with a leisurely absence
of interest which might have been mistaken for insolence&mdash;and
envied as such by a servile world which secretly adores it.</p>

<p>"Well, Lady Greensleeves?" he said, watching her.</p>

<p>"Some remarkable Poiret and Lucille gowns, Clive.... And a great
deal of paint." She remained a moment in the same attitude&mdash;leisurely
inspecting the throng below, then turned to him, her calm preoccupation
changing to a shyly engaging smile.</p>

<p>"Are you still of the same mind concerning my personal attractiveness?"</p>

<p>"I <em>have</em> spoiled you!" he concluded, pretending chagrin.</p>

<p>"Is that spoiling me&mdash;to hear you say you approve of me?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, you dear girl! Nothing could ever spoil you."</p>

<p>She lifted her Clover Club, looking across the frosty glass at
him; and the usual rite was silently completed. They were hungry;
her appetite was always a natural and healthy one, and his sometimes
matched it, as happened that night.</p>

<p>"Now, this is wonderful," he said, lighting a cigarette between
courses and leaning forward, elbows on the cloth, and his hands
clasped under his chin; "a good show, a good dinner, and good
company. What surfeited monarch could ask more?"</p>

<p>"Why mention the company last, Clive?"</p>

<p>"I've certainly spoiled you," he said with a groan; "you've tasted
adulation; you prefer it to your dinner."</p>

<p>"The question is do <em>you</em> prefer my company to the dinner
and the show? <em>Do</em> you! If so why mention me last in the
catalogue of your blessings?"</p>

<p>"I always mention you last in my prayers&mdash;so that whoever listens
will more easily remember," he said gaily.</p>

<p>The laughter still made the dark blue eyes brilliant but they
grew more serious when she said: "You don't really ever <em>pray</em>
for me, Clive. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why not?"</p>

<p>The smile faded in her eyes and in his.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you prayed at all," she remarked, looking down
at her wine glass.</p>

<p>"It's one of those things I happen to do," he said with a slight
shrug.</p>

<p>They mused for a while in silence, her mind pursuing its trend
back to childhood, his idly considering the subject of prayer
and wondering whether the habit had become too mechanical with
him, or whether his less selfish petitions might possibly carry
to the Source of All Things.</p>

<p>Then having drifted clear of this nebulous zone of thought, and
coffee having been served, they came back to earth and to each
other with slight smiles of recognition&mdash;delicate salutes acknowledging
each other's presence and paramount importance in a world which
was going very gaily.</p>

<p>They discussed the play; she hummed snatches of its melodies
below her breath at intervals, her dark blue eyes always fixed
on him and her ears listening to him alone. Particularly now;
for his mood had changed and he was drifting back toward something
she had said earlier in the evening&mdash;something about her own possible
capacity for good and evil. It was a question, only partly serious;
and she responded in the same vein:</p>

<p>"How should I know what capabilities I possess? Of course I have
capabilities. No doubt, dormant within me lies every besetting
sin, every human failing. Perhaps also the cardinal, corresponding,
and antidotic virtues to all of these."</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, "every sin has its antithesis. It's like
a chess board&mdash;the human mind&mdash;with the black men ranged on one
side and the white on the other, ready to move, to advance, skirmish,
threaten, manoeuvre, attack, and check each other, and the intervening
squares represent the checkered battlefield of contending desires."</p>

<p>The simile striking her as original and clever, she made him
a pretty compliment. She was very young in her affections.</p>

<p>"If," she nodded, "a sin, represented by a black piece, dares
to stir or intrude or threaten, then there is always the better
thought, represented by a white piece, ready to block and check
the black one. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," he said, secretly well pleased with himself. And as
for Athalie, she admired his elastic and eloquent imagination
beyond words.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said, "you have never yet told me anything
about your business. Is it all right for me to ask, Clive?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. It's real estate &mdash;Bailey, Reeve, and Willis.
Willis is dead, Reeve out of it, and my father and I are the whole
show."</p>

<p>"Reeve?" she repeated, interested.</p>

<p>"Yes, he lives in Paris, permanently. He has a son here, in the
banking business."</p>

<p>"Cecil Reeve?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"No. My sister Catharine does."</p>

<p>Clive seemed interested and curious: "Cecil Reeve and I were
at Harvard together. I haven't seen much of him since."</p>

<p>"What sort is he, Clive?"</p>

<p>"Nice &mdash;Oh, very nice. A good sport;&mdash;a good deal of a sport....
Which sister did you say?"</p>

<p>"Catharine."</p>

<p>"That's the cunning little one with the baby stare and brown
curls?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Clive sat absently fidgeting with his glass,
and Athalie watched him. Presently without looking up he said:
"Yes, Cecil Reeve is a very decent sport.... Rather gay. Good-looking
chap. Nice sort.... But rather a sport, you know."</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>"Catharine mustn't believe all he says," he added with a laugh.
"Cecil has a way &mdash;I'm not knocking him, you understand&mdash;but
a young&mdash;inexperienced girl&mdash;might take him a little bit too seriously....
Of course your sister wouldn't."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so.... Are <em>you</em> that way, too?"</p>

<p>He raised his eyes: "Do you think I am, Athalie?"</p>

<p>"No.... But I can't help wondering&mdash;a little uneasily at times&mdash;how
you can find me as&mdash;as companionable as you say you do.... I can't
help wondering how long it will last."</p>

<p>"It will last as long as you do."</p>

<p>"But you are sure to find me out sooner or later, Clive."</p>

<p>"Find you out?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;discover my limits, exhaust my capacity for entertaining
you, extract the last atom of amusement out of me. And&mdash;what <em>then</em>?"</p>

<p>"Athalie! What nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly it's nonsense. How can I possibly tire of such a girl
as you? I scarcely even know you yet. I don't begin to know you.
Why you are a perfectly unexplored, undiscovered girl to me, yet!"</p>

<p>"Am I?" she asked, laughing. "I supposed you had discovered about
all there is to me."</p>

<p>He shook his head, looking at her curiously perplexed: "Every
time we meet you are different. You always have interesting views
on any subject. You stimulate my imagination. How could I tire?</p>

<p>"Besides, somehow I am always aware of reserved and hidden forces
in you&mdash;of a character which I only partly know and admire&mdash;capabilities,
capacities of which I am ignorant except that, intuitively, I
seem to know they are part of you."</p>

<p>"Am I as complex as that to you?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," he admitted. "You are just now for example. But
usually you are only a wonderfully interesting and charming girl
who brings out the best side of me and keeps me amused and happy
every moment that I am with you."</p>

<p>"There really is not much more to me than that," she said in
a low voice. "You sum me up&mdash;a gay source of amusement: nothing
more."</p>

<p>"Athalie, you know you are more vital than that to me."</p>

<p>"No, I don't know it."</p>

<p>"You do! You know it in your own heart. You know that it is a
straight, clean, ardent friendship that inspires me and&mdash;" she
looked up, serious, and very quiet.</p>

<p>&mdash;"You know," he continued impulsively, "that it is not only
your beauty, your loveliness and grace and that inexplicable charm
you seem to radiate, that brings me to seek you every time that
I have a moment to do so.</p>

<p>"Why, if it were that alone, it would all have been merely a
matter of sentiment. Have I ever been sentimental with you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Have I ever made love to you?"</p>

<p>She did not reply. Her eyes were fixed on her glass.</p>

<p>"Have I, Athalie?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"No, Clive," she said gently.</p>

<p>"Well then; is there not on my part a very deep, solidly founded,
and vital friendship for you? Is there not a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't let's talk about it," she interrupted in a low voice.
"You always make me very happy; you say I please you&mdash;interest
and amuse you. That is enough&mdash;more than enough&mdash;more than I ever
hoped or asked&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I said you make me happy;&mdash;happier than I have ever been," he
explained with emphasis. "Do you suppose for a moment that your
regard for me is warmer, deeper, more enduring, than is mine for
you? Do you, Athalie?"</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to his. But she had nothing more to say on
the subject.</p>

<p>However, he began to insist,&mdash;a little impatiently,&mdash;on a direct
answer. And finally she said:</p>

<p>"Clive, you came into a rather empty life when you came into
mine. Judge how completely you have filled it.... And what it
would be if you went out of it. Your own life has always been
full. If I should disappear from it&mdash;" she ceased.</p>

<p>The quiet, accentless, almost listless dignity of the words surprised
and impressed him for a moment; then the reaction came in a faint
glow through every vein and a sudden impulse to respond to her
with an assurance of devotion a little out of key with the somewhat
stately and reserved measure of their duet called friendship.</p>

<p>"You also fill my life," he said. "You give me what I never had&mdash;an
intimacy and an understanding that satisfies. Had I my way I would
be with you all the time. No other woman interests me as you do.
There <em>is</em> no other woman."</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive! And all the charming people you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know many. None like you, Athalie."</p>

<p>"That is very sweet of you.... I'm trying to believe it.... I
want to.... There are many days to fill in when I am not with
you. To fill them with such a belief would be to shorten them....
I don't know. I often wonder where you are; what you are doing;
with what stately and beautiful creature you are talking, laughing,
walking, dancing." &mdash;She shrugged her shoulders and gazed
down at the dancers below. "The days are very long, sometimes,"
she added, half to herself.</p>

<p>When again, calmly, she turned to him there was an odd expression
on his face, and the next second he reddened and shifted his gaze.
Neither spoke for a few moments.</p>

<p>Presently she began to draw on her gloves, but he continued staring
into space, not noticing her, and finally she bent forward and
rested her slim gloved fingers on his hand, lightly, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Yes; all right," he muttered.</p>

<p>"I have to go to business in the morning," she pleaded. He turned
almost impatiently:</p>

<p>"If I had my way you wouldn't go to business at all."</p>

<p>"If I had my way I wouldn't either," she rejoined, smilingly.
But his youthful visage remained sober and flushed. And when they
were seated in the limousine and the fur rug enveloped them both,
he said abruptly:</p>

<p>"I'm getting tired of this business."</p>

<p>"What business, Clive?"</p>

<p>"Everything&mdash;the way you live&mdash;your inadequate quarters&mdash;your
having to work all day long in that stuffy office, day after day,
year after year!"</p>

<p>She said, surprised and perplexed: "But it can't be helped, Clive!
I have to work."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;what good am I to you&mdash;what's the use of me, if I can't
make things easier for you?"</p>

<p>"The <em>use</em> of you? Did you think I ever had any idea of
using you?"</p>

<p>"But I want you to."</p>

<p>"How?" she asked, still uneasily perplexed, her eyes fixed on
him.</p>

<p>But he had no definite idea, no plan fixed, nothing further to
say on a subject that had so suddenly taken shape within his mind.</p>

<p>She asked him again for an explanation, but, receiving none,
settled back thoughtfully in her furs. Only once did he break
the silence.</p>

<p>"You know," he said indifferently, "that row of houses, of which
yours is one, belongs to me. I mean to me, personally."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't know it."</p>

<p>"Well it does. It's my own investment.... I've reduced rents&mdash;pending
improvements."</p>

<p>She looked up at him.</p>

<p>"The rent of your apartment has been reduced fifty per cent.,"
he said carelessly; "so your rent is now paid until the new term
begins next October."</p>

<p>"Clive! That is perfectly ridiculous!" she began, hotly; but
he swung around, silencing her:</p>

<p>"Are you criticising my business methods?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"But that is too silly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you mind your business!" he exclaimed, turning and taking
her by both shoulders. She looked into his eyes, searching them
in silence. Then:</p>

<p>"You're such a dear," she sighed; "why do you want to do a thing
like that when my sisters and I can afford to pay the present
rent. You are always doing such things, Clive; you have simply
covered my dressing-table with silver; my bureau is full of pretty
things, all gifts from you; you've given me the loveliest furniture
of my own, and books and desk-set and&mdash;and everything. And now
you are asking me to live rent-free.... And what have I to offer
you in return?"</p>

<p>"The happiness of being with you now and then."</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive! You know that isn't very much to offer you. You know
that our being together is far more to me than it is to you! I
dare not even consider what I'd do without you, now. You mould
me, alter my thoughts, make me such a delightfully different girl,
take entire charge and possession of me.... I don't want you to
give me anything more&mdash;do anything more for me.... When you first
began to give me beautiful things I didn't want to take them.
Do you remember how awkward and shy I was&mdash;how I blushed. But
I always end by doing everything you wish.... And it seems to
give us both so much pleasure&mdash;all you do for me.... But please
<em>don't</em> ask me to live without paying rent&mdash;"</p>

<p>The limousine drew up by the curb; Clive jumped out, aided Athalie
to descend; and started for the grilled door where a light glimmered.</p>

<p>"This is not the house!" exclaimed Athalie, stopping short. "Where
are you taking me, Clive?"</p>

<p>"Come on," he said, "I merely want to show you how I've had the
new apartment house built&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;it's too late! What an odd idea, taking me to inspect a
new apartment house at two in the morning! Are you really serious?"</p>

<p>He nodded and rang. A sleepy night porter opened, recognised
Clive, and touched his hat.</p>

<p>"Take us to the top, Mike," he said.</p>

<p>"Have you the keys, sorr?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>They entered the cage and it shot up to the top floor.</p>

<p>"Wait for us, Mike."... And to Athalie: "This is Michael Daly
who will do anything you ask of him&mdash;won't you, Mike?"</p>

<p>"I will that, sorr," said the big Irishman, tipping his hat to
Athalie.</p>

<p>"But, Clive," she persisted, bewildered, still clinging to his
arm, "I don't understand why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Little goose, hush!" he replied, subduing the excitement in
his voice and fitting the key into the door.</p>

<p>"One moment, Athalie," he added, "until I light up. Now!"</p>

<p>She entered the lighted hallway, walking on a soft green carpet,
and turned, obeying the guiding pressure of his arm, into a big
square room which sprang into brilliant illumination as he found
the switch.</p>

<p>Green and gold were the hangings and prevailing colours; there
were rugs, wide, comfortable chairs and lounges, bookcases, a
picture or two in deep glowing colours, a baby-grand piano, and
an open fire loaded for business.</p>

<p>"Is it done in good taste, Athalie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is charming. Is it yours, Clive?"</p>

<p>He laughed, slipped his arm under hers and led her along the
hallway, opening door after door; and first she was invited to
observe a very modern and glistening bathroom, then a bedroom
all done in grey and rose with dainty white furniture and a white-bear
rug beside the bed.</p>

<p>"Why this is a woman's room!" she exclaimed, puzzled.</p>

<p>He only laughed and drew her along the hall, showing her another
bedroom with twin beds, a maid's room, a big clothes press, and
finally, a completely furnished kitchen, very modern with its
porcelain baseboard and tiled walls.</p>

<p>"What do you think of all this, Athalie?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Why it's exquisite, Clive. Whose is it?"</p>

<p>They walked back to the square living-room. He said, teasingly:
"Do you remember, the first time I saw you after those four years,&mdash;that
first evening when I came in to surprise you and found you sitting
by the radiator&mdash;in your nightie, Athalie?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, laughing and blushing as she always did when
he tormented her with that souvenir.</p>

<p>"And I said that you ought to have an open fire. And a cat. Didn't
I?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There's your fire, Athalie;" he drew a match from his tiny flat
gold case, struck it, and lighted the nest of pine shavings under
the logs;&mdash;"and Michael has the cat when you want it."</p>

<p>He drew a big soft arm-chair to the mounting blaze. Athalie stood
motionless, staring at the flames, then with a sudden, nervous
gesture she sank down on the arm-chair and covered her face with
her gloved hands.</p>

<p>He stood waiting, happy and excited, and finally he went over
and touched her; and the girl caught his hand convulsively in
both of hers and looked up at him with wet eyes.</p>

<p>"How can I do this, Clive? How <em>can</em> I?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Any brother would do as much for his sister&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive! You are different! You are <em>more</em> than that.
You know you are. How can I take all this? Will you tell me? How
can I live here&mdash;this way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your sisters will be here. You saw their room just now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what can I <em>tell</em> them? How can I explain? They know
we cannot afford such luxury as this?"</p>

<p>"Tell them the rent is the same."</p>

<p>"They won't believe it. They couldn't. They don't understand
even now how it is with you and me&mdash;that you are so dear and generous
and kind just because you are my friend&mdash;and no more than my friend....
Not that they really believe&mdash;anything&mdash;unpleasant&mdash;of <em>me</em>&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you care&mdash;as long as it isn't so?" he said, coolly.</p>

<p>"I don't care. Except that it weakens my authority over them....
Catharine is very impulsive, and she dearly loves a good time&mdash;and
she is becoming sullen with me when I try to advise her or curb
her.... And it's so with Doris, too.... I'd like to keep my influence....
But if they ever really began to believe that between you and
me there was&mdash;more&mdash;than friendship, I &mdash;I don't know what
they might feel free to think&mdash;or do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're older than you."</p>

<p>"Yes. But I seem to have the authority,&mdash;or I did have."</p>

<p>They looked into the leaping flames; he threw open his fur coat
and seated himself on the padded arm of her chair.</p>

<p>"All I know is," he said, "that it gives me the deepest and most
enduring happiness to do things for you. When the architect planned
this house I had him design a place for you. Ultimately all the
row of old houses are to be torn down and replaced by modern apartments
with moderate rentals. So you will have to move anyway sooner
or later. Why not come here <em>now</em>?"</p>

<p>Half unconsciously she had rested her cheek against the fur lining
of his coat where it fell against his arm. He looked down at her,
touched her hair&mdash;a thing he had never thought of doing before.</p>

<p>"Why not come here, Athalie?" he said caressingly.</p>

<p>"I don't know. It would be heavenly. Do you want me to, Clive?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And I want you to begin to put away part of your salary,
too. You might as well begin, now. You will be free from the burden
of rent, free from&mdash;various burdens&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>can't&mdash;let you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want to!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it gives me pleasure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; because you desire to give <em>me</em> pleasure! <em>That</em>
is the reason!" she exclaimed with partly restrained passion&mdash;"because
you are <em>you</em>&mdash;and there is nobody like you in all the
world&mdash;in all the world, Clive!&mdash;"</p>

<p>To her emotion his own flashed a quick, warm response. He looked
down at her, deeply touched, his pride gratified, his boyish vanity
satisfied. Always had the simplicity and candour of her quick
and ardent gratitude corroborated and satisfied whatever was in
him of youthful self-esteem. Everything about her seemed to minister
to it&mdash;her attention in public places was undisguisedly for him
alone; her beauty, her superb youth and health, the admiring envy
of other people&mdash;all these flattered him.</p>

<p>Why should he not find pleasure in giving to such a girl as this?&mdash;giving
without scruple&mdash;unscrupulous too, perhaps, concerning the effect
his generosity might have on a cynical world which looked on out
of wearied and incredulous eyes; unscrupulous, perhaps, concerning
the effect his too lavish kindness might have on a young girl
unaccustomed to men and the ways of men.</p>

<p>But there was no harm in him; he was very much self-assured of
that. He had been too carefully brought up&mdash;far too carefully
reared. And had people ventured to question him, and had they
escaped alive his righteous violence, they would have learned
that there really was not the remotest chance that his mother
was in danger of becoming what she most dreaded in all the world.</p>

<p>The fire burned lower; they sat watching it together, her flushed
cheek against the fur of his coat, his arm extended along the
back of the chair behind her.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "this has been another happy evening."</p>

<p>She stirred in assent, and he felt the lightest possible pressure
against him.</p>

<p>"Are you contented, Athalie?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>After a moment he glanced at his watch. It was three o'clock.
So he rose, placed the screen over the fireplace, and then came
back to where she now stood, looking very intently at the opposite
wall. And he turned to see what interested her. But there seemed
to be nothing in particular just there.</p>

<p>"What are you staring at, little ghost-seer?" he asked, passing
his hand under her arm; and stepped back, surprised, as she freed
herself with a quick, nervous movement, looked at him, then averted
her head.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Athalie?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Nothing.... Don't touch me, Clive."</p>

<p>"No, of course not.... But what in the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing.... Don't ask me." Presently he saw her very slowly
move her head and look back at the empty corner of the room; and
remain so, motionless for a moment. Then she turned with a sigh,
came quietly to him; and he drew her hand through his arm.</p>

<p>"Of what were you thinking, Athalie?"</p>

<p>"Of nothing."</p>

<p>"Did you think you saw something over there?"</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"What were you looking at?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Nothing.... I don't care to talk just now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me, Athalie!"</p>

<p>"No.... No, I don't want to, Clive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish to know!"</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;there is nothing to tell you&mdash;" she laid one hand on
his coat, almost pleadingly, and looked up at him out of eyes
so dark that only the starry light in them betrayed that they
were blue and not velvet black.</p>

<p>"That same thing has happened before," he said, looking at her,
deeply perplexed. "Several times since I have known you the same
expression has come into your face&mdash;as though you were looking
at something which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't, Clive!&mdash;"</p>

<p>" &mdash;Which," he insisted, "I did not see.... <em>Could</em>
not see!"</p>

<p>"Clive!"</p>

<p>He stared at her rather blankly: "Why don't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>can't!"</p>

<p>"<em>Is</em> there anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't! Don't!" she begged; but he went on, still staring at
her:</p>

<p>"Is there any reason for you to&mdash;not to be frank with me? <em>Is</em>
there, Athalie?"</p>

<p>"No; no reason.... I'll tell you ... if you will understand.
<em>Must</em> I tell you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Her head fell; she stood plucking nervously at his fur coat for
a while in silence. Then:</p>

<p>"Clive, I &mdash;I <em>see clearly</em>."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I see a&mdash;a little more clearly than&mdash;some do. Do
you understand?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She sighed, stood twisting her white-gloved fingers, looking
away from him.</p>

<p>"I am clairvoyant," she breathed.</p>

<p>"Athalie! <em>You?</em>"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>For a second or two he stood silent in his astonishment; then,
taking her hand, he drew her around facing the light, and she
looked up at him in her lovely abashed way, yet so honestly, that
anybody who could recognise truth and candour, could never have
mistaken such eyes as hers.</p>

<p>"Who told you that you are clairvoyant?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My mother."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was not necessary for anybody to tell me that I saw&mdash;more
clearly&mdash;than other people.... Mother knew it.... She merely explained
and gave a name to this&mdash;this&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;this quality&mdash;this
ability to see clearly.... That is all, Clive."</p>

<p>He was evidently trying to comprehend and digest what she had
said. She watched him, saw surprise and incredulity in conflict
with uneasiness and with the belief he could not avoid from lips
that were not fashioned for lies, and from eyes never made to
even look untruths.</p>

<p>"I had never supposed there was such a thing as real clairvoyance,"
he said at last.</p>

<p>She remained silent, her candid gaze on him.</p>

<p>"I believe that <em>you</em> believe it, of course."</p>

<p>She smiled, then sighed:</p>

<p>"There is no pleasure in it to me. I wish it were not so."</p>

<p>"But, if it is so, you ought to find it&mdash;interesting&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not? I should think you would!&mdash;if you can see&mdash;things&mdash;that
other people cannot."</p>

<p>"I don't care to see them."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"They &mdash;I see them so often&mdash;and I seldom know who they
are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They?"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;people &mdash;I see."</p>

<p>"Don't they ever speak to you?"</p>

<p>"Seldom."</p>

<p>"Could you find out who they are?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.... Yes, I think so;&mdash;if I made an effort."</p>

<p>"Don't you ever use any effort to evoke&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive! <em>No!</em> When I tell you I had rather not see
so&mdash;so clearly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You dear girl!" he exclaimed, half smiling, half serious, "why
should it distress you?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't&mdash;except to talk about it."</p>

<p>"Let me ask one more question. May I?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;did you recognise whoever it was you saw a few moments
ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who was it, Athalie?"</p>

<p>"My mother."</p>
