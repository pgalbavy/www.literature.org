The eighth chapter is exceedingly brief, and relates that Gibbins,
the amateur naturalist of the district, while lying out on the
spacious open downs without a soul within a couple of miles of him,
as he thought, and almost dozing, heard close to him the sound as of
a man coughing, sneezing, and then swearing savagely to himself; and
looking, beheld nothing.  Yet the voice was indisputable.  It
continued to swear with that breadth and variety that distinguishes
the swearing of a cultivated man.  It grew to a climax, diminished
again, and died away in the distance, going as it seemed to him in
the direction of Adderdean.  It lifted to a spasmodic sneeze and
ended.  Gibbins had heard nothing of the morning's occurrences, but
the phenomenon was so striking and disturbing that his philosophical
tranquillity vanished; he got up hastily, and hurried down the
steepness of the hill towards the village, as fast as he could go.
