<p>Mickey O'Rooney gave a yell of defiance as he vanished from view,
horse and rider unharmed by the scattering shots which followed
them, even after they were lost to sight. It was well and bravely
done, and yet it would have failed altogether but for the wonderful
cunning and shrewd courage of Simpson, who had kept close to the
heels of the flying horse. It was when the crisis came&mdash;when the
Apaches were closing around the fugitive, and it seemed inevitable
that he should reap the natural reward of his own foolhardiness
that Sut had acted. When the warriors were confident of their
success, he discharged his rifle with marvelous quickness, and
with a more important result than the mere tumbling over of his
man.</p>

<p>There was a momentary check, a sudden stoppage, lasting but a
few seconds, when the foe rallied and made for the fugitive. But
that brief interval of time was precisely what was needed, and
it secured the safety of Mickey and his steed. It mattered not
that Sut Simpson as good as threw away his life by his chivalrous
act. He knew that full well, while awaiting the opportunity, as
much as he did when he raised his faithful weapon and discharged
it into the group.</p>

<p>The moment the piece was fired he knew that his mission was accomplished,
and he began a retreat, moving stealthily and rapidly backward,
for the purpose of getting beyond the range of the redskins before
they should fairly recover from the escape of the horseman. But
events were proceeding rather too rapidly. Before he could cover
any appreciable distance, the baffled wretches turned upon him
and it was flight or fight, or, more likely, both.</p>

<p>The Apaches were brave, they knew the character of the dreaded
scout and they were not desirous of rushing, one after another,
to their doom. Sut was certain that, if he should turn and run,
the howling horde would be at his heels. The instant there should
appear any possibility of his escape, they would all open upon
him, and it was impossible that any such good fortune should attend
him as had marked the flight of Mickey. It was his purpose, therefore,
to keep up his retreat with his face to his foe, forcing all to
maintain their distance, until he could reach the side of the
ravine, where, possibly, a sudden desperate effort might enable
him to outwit the redskins.</p>

<p>The scout had not yet been given time in which to reload his
piece, but the uncertainty whether it contained another charge
prevented them from making an impetuous rush upon him. Besides,
they knew that he carried a formidable knife, and, like every
border character, he was a professor of the art of using it. All
at once it occurred to Sut that he might thin out his assailants
by the use of his revolver. If he could drop three or four, or
more, and then follow it up with a savage onslaught, he believed
he could open the way. He felt for the weapon, and was terribly
disappointed to find it gone.</p>

<p>He recalled that he had given it to Fred Munson when he was left
alone with the mustang. So, as he had nothing but his knife, he
placed his hand upon the haft, glaring defiantly at his enemies,
while he continued walking slowly backward, and gradually edging
toward the side of the grove. But Apaches were plenty in that
latitude, and the business had scarcely opened when three or four
warriors commenced a stealthy approach upon the scout from the
rear. He glanced hastily over his shoulder several times, while
slowly retreating, to guard against this very danger; but the
Indians, seeing the point for which the fugitive was making, ensconced
themselves near it and waited.</p>

<p>At the moment Sut placed his hand upon the knife, he was within
twenty feet of the three Indians crouching in the grass, with
no suspicion of their proximity. One of them arose to his feet,
quietly swung a coiled lasso about his head (the distance being
so slight that no great effort was necessary), and then with great
dexterity dropped it over the head of the unsuspicious scout,
inclosing his arms, when he jerked it taut with the suddenness
of lightning.</p>

<p>A few seconds only were necessary for Sut to free himself, but
ere those seconds could be taken advantage of, he was drawn over
backward. The entire party sprang upon him and seized his gun
and knife.</p>

<p>"Skulp me, if this don't look as though I'd made a slip of it
this time!" muttered Sut, as he bounded like lightning to his
feet. "When yer varmints undertake a job of this kind, yer show
that yer ain't no slouches, but have a good knowledge of the business."</p>

<p>As if anxious to deserve the complimentary opinion of their distinguished
prisoner, they coiled the lasso again and again about him, until
he was fastened by a dozen rounds and was no more able to contend
against his captors then if he were an infant.</p>

<p>As all the warriors recognized the prisoner, their delight was
something extraordinary. They danced about him in the most grotesque
and frantic manner, screeching, yelling, and indulging in all
sorts of tantalizing gestures and signs at Simpson, who was unable
to resist them or help himself.</p>

<p>There was a certain dignity in the carriage of Sut under these
trying circumstances. Instead of replying by taunts to the taunts
of his enemies, he maintained silence, permitting them to wag
on to their heart's content.</p>

<p>It was wonderful how rapidly the tidings of the capture spread.
The hootings and yellings that marked the rejoicings of the party
were heard by those who were further away, and they signaled it
to the warriors beyond. The redskins came from every direction,
and, within half an hour from the time Sut Simpson was lassoed,
there must have been nearly a hundred Apaches gathered around
him. These all continued their frantic rejoicings, while, as before,
the prisoner remained silent.</p>

<p>His eyes were wandering over the company in search of Lone Wolf,
their great leader; but that redoubtable chieftain was nowhere
to be seen. Sut was certain that he was somewhere near at hand,
and must know of all that had happened on this spot.</p>

<p>Did Simpson expect anything like mercy from the Apaches? Not
a whit of it. He had fought them too long, had inflicted too much
injury, and understood them too thoroughly to look for anything
of the kind. Besides, even if he was innocent of having ever harmed
a redskin, he would not have received the slightest indulgence
at their hands. The Apaches are like all the rest of their species,
in their inherent opposition to mercy on general principles.</p>

<p>The afternoon was well spent, and, as a means of occupying his
mind until his case was disposed of, he set himself speculating
as to what their precise intentions were. Being quite familiar
with the Apache tongue, he caught the meaning of many of their
expressions; but for a considerable time these were confined to
mere exultations over his capture. The excitement was too great
for anything like deliberation, or concerted council.</p>

<p>"It may be the skunks are waitin' fur Lone Wolf," he muttered,
as he stood with his arms bound to his side. "They wouldn't dare
to do much without axing him, though I 'spose they might a skulp
any man wharever they got the chance, without stopping to ax questions.
Helloa! thar he comes!"</p>

<p>This exclamation was caused by the sudden turning of heads, and
a sort of hush that fell upon the group for the moment, close
to the approach of someone on horseback. It was already so close
to dusk that he could not be identified until he came closer,
when Sut was surprised to find that it was not the chieftain,
after all. It was a man altogether different in appearance, probably
a subordinate chief, who had performed some daring deed which
had won him the admiration of his comrades. The indications, too,
were that he brought interesting news about something.</p>

<p>"That varmint has been away somewhar," concluded Sut, carefully
noting everything, "and they expect him to tell something worth
hearin', and I guess they're about kerrect, so I'll see what I
kin do in the way of listening myself."</p>

<p>The scout was right in his supposition. The Indian was the <em>avant
courier</em> of a party three or four times as great as that which
had gathered about him in the ravine. His companions had separated
and gone in other directions, while he, learning the course taken
by his chief, Lone Wolf, had hastened to report directly to him.</p>

<p>Sut Simpson suspected what all this meant. He saw a number of
scalps hanging at the girdle of the Apache, and he had not listened
long when his fears where more than confirmed. The embryo town
of New Boston, planted in the valley of the Rio Pecos, was no
more. Repulsed bloodily at the first, Lone Wolf had gathered together
the best of his warriors, placed them under one of his youngest
and most daring chiefs, and sent them forth with orders to clean
out the settlement that had been planted so defiantly in the heart
of their country. And now this chief had returned to say that
the work had been completed, precisely as commanded.</p>

<p>"I knowed it war coming," muttered the scout. "I told that Barnwell
that Lone Wolf would bounce him afore he knowed what the the matter
was, and I urged 'em to make for Fort Severn, which war only fifty
miles away, and save their top-knots. He did not say so, but I
could see he thought I war a big fool, and now he's found out
who the fool was. Wonder whether any of the poor cusses got away?
Thar couldn't have been much chance. 'Twon't do to ax this rooster,
cause he wouldn't be likely to answer me, and, if he did, he would
be sartin' to tell me a lot of lies."</p>

<p>The young chief having communicated his good tidings, and exchanged
congratulations with those about him, started his mustang forward,
heading him directly up the ravine or pass. This brought him within
arm's length of the scout, who was standing mute and motionless.
The redskin drew up his horse and stared fixedly at him, as if,
for the moment, uncertain of his identity.</p>

<p>"I'm Sut Simpson, the man that has slain so many Apache warriors
that he cannot number them," said the scout, with a view of helping
the Indian to recognize him.</p>

<p>There was no real braggadocio about this. As Sut could not hide
his personality, the best plan for him was to make an open avowal,
backed up by a rather high-sounding vaunt. This was more pleasing
to the Indians, who were addicted to the most extravagant kind
of expression.</p>

<p>Rather curiously, the young chief made no reply. The observation
of the prisoner seemed to have settled all doubts that were in
his mind, and perhaps he was desirous of seeing Lone Wolf without
any further delay. His steed struck into a rapid gallop, and speedily
vanished in the gloom, leaving the captive with the howling hundred.</p>

<p>Sut was brave, but there was a certain feeling of disappointment
that began to make itself felt. Although he would not have admitted
it, yet the termination of the recent meeting with Lone Wolf,
had led him to hope, not that the chieftain would liberate him,
but that he would give him some kind of a show for his life&mdash;an
opportunity, no matter how desperate, in which he might make a
fight for his existence. He had spared Lone Wolf when he was at
his mercy, refusing to fight the chief because he was so disabled
that his defeat was assured. It would seem that the chief, in
return, might offer the scout a chance to fight some of the best
warriors; and such probably would have been the case with any
set of people except the American Indians. The absence of Lone
Wolf impressed Sut very unfavorably. He believed the chief meant
to remain away until after his important prisoner was killed.</p>

<p>By the time night was descended, the wild rejoicing in a great
measure ceased. One of the Apaches started a fire, and the others
lent their assistance. A roaring, crackling flame lit up a large
area of the ravine, revealing the figure of every savage, as well
as that of the scout, who, having grown weary of continual standing,
seated himself upon the ground. Had Sut possessed the use of his
arms, he would have made an effort to get away at this time. A
short run would have carried him to the place which he had in
mind at the time he began his retreat. Without the aid of his
hands, however, he was certain to be entrapped again, so he concluded
to remain where he was, with the hope that something more inviting
would present itself.</p>

<p>The frontiersman never despairs; and, although it was difficult
to figure out the basis of much hope in the present case, yet
Sut held on, and determined to do so to the end. He made several
cautious tests of his bonds, but the lariat of buffalo-hide was
wound around his arms so continuously, and tied so well, that
the strength of twenty men could not have broken it. The exploit
of cutting them by abrasion against a sharp stone (which he had
once done), could not be accomplished in the present instance,
for the reason that there was no suitable stone at hand, and he
was under too strict surveillance. And so it only remained for
him to wait and hope, and hold himself in readiness.</p>

<p>When the fire had crackled and flamed for a while, the Apaches
clustered in groups upon the ground, where they smoked and talked
incessantly. They seemed to be paying no attention to their prisoner,
and yet they took pains to group themselves around him in such
a way that if he should attempt flight he would be forced into
collision with some of them. Sut was surprised that as yet no
indignity had been offered him. As the Apaches had every reason
to hate him with the very intensity of hatred, it would have been
in keeping with their character to have made his lot as uncomfortable
as possible.</p>

<p>"It'll come by-and-bye," he sighed, as the cramped position of
his arms pained him. "I don't know what they're waitin' fur. Mebbe
they want to get up such a high old time with me that they're
writin' out a programme, and have sent to New Orleans fur a band
of music. Thar's nothing like doing these things up in style,
and I s'pose Lone Wolf means to honor me in that way."</p>

<p>At a late hour, the moon arose, and the light penetrated the
ravine, where the strange, motley crowd congregated. The fire
still burned, and no one showed any disposition to sleep. By way
of relief, the scout lay over upon his side, and was looking up
at the clear moon-lit sky when he heard the tramp of horses, and
immediately rose up again.</p>

<p>He saw the chieftain, whom he had observed a few hours before,
as he came in with his news of the destruction of New Boston,
accompanied by two others, all mounted. They rode up in such a
position that they surrounded the captive, who was suddenly lifted
by a couple of Apaches, and placed astride of the mustang in front
of the young chief. The next minute the quartette moved off.</p>

<p>"Skulp me! if I know what this means!" muttered Sut, who felt
uneasy over the new turn of affairs. "Things are getting sort
of mixed just now."</p>

<p>He hoped that he would learn something of the purpose of the
three redskins from their conversation as they rode along; but
unfortunately for that hope, they did not exchange a word. When
they had ridden a fourth of a mile, Sut caught the flash of a
knife in the chieftain's hand. The next instant, it moved swiftly
along his back, and the lariat was cut in many pieces. The arms
of the scout were freed, although for some minutes they were so
benumbed that he could scarcely move them.</p>

<p>What did all this mean? Fully another quarter of a mile was ridden
in silence, when the three halted, and Sut felt that the critical
moment had arrived. The chief dismounted from the horse, leaving
the scout seated thereon. One of the others reached over and handed
him his own gun, while the third passed him back his long knife.</p>

<p>"Wall, if I'm to fight all three of yer, sail in!" called out
Sut, gathering himself for a charge from them.</p>

<p>They made no reply. The chief vaulted upon one of the other horses,
behind the warrior, and, as he did so, a fourth figure advanced
and leaped upon the other, so that there were two Indians upon
each mustang. The scout scrutinized the new comer, as well as
he could in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Yes, there was no mistake about his identity. It was Lone Wolf,
who remained as silent as the others.</p>

<p>The heads of the mustangs were turned down the ravine again,
and they struck into a gallop, the sound of their hoofs coming
back fainter and more faintly, until they died in the night. Sut
Simpson was free, and free without a fight, as he realized, when
he gave his horse the word, and he dropped into an easy gait in
a direction opposite to that taken by the Apaches.</p>
