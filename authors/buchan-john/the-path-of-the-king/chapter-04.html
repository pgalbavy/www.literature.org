<p>On the morning of Shrove Tuesday, in the year of our Lord 1249,
Sir Aimery of Beaumanoir, the envoy of the most Christian king,
Louis of France, arrived in the port of Acre, having made the
voyage from Cyprus with a fair wind in a day and a night in a
ship of Genoa flying the red and gold banner of the Temple. Weary
of the palms and sun-baked streets of Limasol and the eternal
wrangling of the Crusading hosts, he looked with favour at the
noble Palestine harbour, and the gilt steeples and carven houses
of the fair city. From the quay he rode to the palace of the Templars
and was admitted straightway to an audience with the Grand Master.
For he had come in a business of some moment.</p>

<p>The taste of Cyprus was still in his mouth; the sweet sticky
air of the coastlands; the smell of endless camps of packed humanity,
set among mountains of barrels and malodorous sprouting forage-stuffs;
the narrow streets lit at night by flares of tarry staves; and
over all that rotting yet acrid flavour which is the token of
the East. The young damoiseau of Beaumanoir had grown very sick
of it all since the royal dromonds first swung into Limasol Bay.
He had seen his friends die like flies of strange maladies, while
the host waited on Hugh of Burgundy. Egypt was but four days off
across the waters, and on its sands Louis had ordained that the
War of the Cross should begin.</p>

<p>... But the King seemed strangely supine. Each day the enemy
was the better forewarned, and each day the quarrels of Templar
and Hospitaller grew more envenomed, and yet he sat patiently
twiddling his thumbs, as if all time lay before him and not a
man's brief life. And now when at long last the laggards of Burgundy
and the Morea were reported on their way, Sir Aimery had to turn
his thoughts from the honest field of war. Not for him to cry
Montjole St. Denis by the Nile. For behold he was now speeding
on a crazy errand to the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>There had been strange councils in the bare little chamber of
the Most Christian King. Those locusts of the dawn whom men called
Tartars, the evil seed of the Three Kings who had once travelled
to Bethlehem, had, it seemed, been vouchsafed a glimpse of grace.
True, they had plundered and eaten the faithful and shed innocent
blood in oceans, but they hated the children of Mahound worse
than the children of Christ. On the eve of Christmas-tide four
envoys had come from their Khakan, monstrous men with big heads
that sprang straight from the shoulder, and arms that hung below
the knee, and short thin legs like gnomes. For forty weeks they
had been on the road, and they brought gifts such as no eye had
seen before&mdash;silks like gossamer woven with wild alphabets, sheeny
jars of jade, and pearls like moons. Their Khakan, they said,
had espoused the grandchild of Prester John, and had been baptized
into the Faith. He marched against Bagdad, and had sworn to root
the heresy of Mahound from the earth. Let the King of France make
a league with him, and between them, pressing from east and west,
they would accomplish the holy task. Let him send teachers to
expound the mysteries of God, and let him send knights who would
treat on mundane things. The letter, written in halting Latin
and sealed with a device like a spider's web, urged instant warfare
with Egypt. "For the present we dwell far apart," wrote the Khakan;
"therefore let us both get to business."</p>

<p>So Aimery had been summoned to the King's chamber, where he found
his good master, the Count of St. Pol, in attendance with others.
After prayer, Louis opened to them his mind. Pale from much fasting
and nightly communing with God, his face was lit again with that
light which had shone in it when on the Friday after Pentecost
the year before he had received at St. Denis the pilgrim's scarf
and the oriflamme of France.</p>

<p>"God's hand is in this, my masters," he said. "Is it not written
that many shall come from the east and from the west to sit down
with Abraham in his kingdom? I have a duty towards those poor
folk, and I dare not fail."</p>

<p>There was no man present bold enough to argue with the white
fire in the King's eyes. One alone cavilled. He was a Scot, Sir
Patrick, the Count of Dunbar, who already shook with the fever
which was to be his death.</p>

<p>"This Khakan is far away, sire," he said. "If it took his envoys
forty weeks to reach us, it will be a good year before his armies
are on the skirts of Egypt. As well make alliance with a star."</p>

<p>But Louis was in missionary mood. "God's ways are not as our
ways. To Him a thousand years are a day, and He can make the weakest
confound a multitude. This far-away King asks for instruction,
and I will send him holy men to fortify his young faith. And this
knight, of whom you, my lord of St. Pol, speak well, shall bear
the greetings of a soldier."</p>

<p>Louis' face, which for usual was grave like a wise child's, broke
into a smile which melted Aimery's heart. He scarcely heard the
Count of St. Pol as that stout friend enlarged on his merits.
"The knight of Beaumanoir," so ran the testimony, "has more learning
than any clerk. In Spain he learned the tongues of the heathen,
and in Paris he read deep in their philosophy. Withal he is a
devout son of Holy Church."</p>

<p>The boy blushed at the praise and the King's kindly regard. But
St. Pol spoke truth, for Aimery, young as he was, had travelled
far both on the material globe and in the kingdom of the spirit.
As a stripling he had made one of the Picardy Nation in the schools
of Paris. He had studied the metaphysics of Aristotle under Aquinas,
and voyaged strange seas of thought piloted by Roger, the white-bearded
Englishman. Thence, by the favour of the Queen-mother, he had
gone as squire to Alphonso's court of Castile, where the Spanish
doctors had opened windows for him into the clear dry wisdom of
the Saracens. He had travelled with an embassy to the Emperor,
and in Sicily had talked with the learned Arabs who clustered
around the fantastic Frederick. In Italy he had met adventurers
of Genoa and Venice who had shown him charts of unknown oceans
and maps of Prester John's country and the desert roads that led
to Cambaluc, that city farther than the moon, and told him tales
of awful and delectable things hidden beyond the dawn. He had
returned to his tower by the springs of Canche, a young man with
a name for uncanny knowledge, a searcher after concealed matters,
negligent of religion and ill at ease in his world.</p>

<p>Then Louis cast his spell over him. He saw the King first at
a great hunting in Avesnes and worshipped from afar the slight
body, royal in every line of it, and the blue eyes which charmed
and compelled, for he divined there a spirit which had the secret
of both earth and heaven. While still under the glamour he was
given knighthood at the royal hands, and presently was weaned
from unwholesome fancies by falling in love. The girl, Alix of
Valery, was slim like a poplar and her eyes were grey and deep
as her northern waters. She had been a maid of Blanche the Queen,
and had a nun's devoutness joined to a merry soul. Under her guiding
Aimery made his peace with the Church, and became notable for
his gifts to God, for he derived great wealth from his Flemish
forbears. Yet the yeast of youth still wrought in him, and by
Alix's side at night he dreamed of other lands than his grey-green
Picardy. So, when the King took the croix d'outre mer and summoned
his knights to the freeing of Jerusalem, Sir Aimery of Beaumanoir
was the first to follow. For to him, as to others like him, the
goal was no perishable city made by mortal hands, but that beata
urbs without foundations which youth builds of its dreams.</p>

<p>He heard mass by the King's side and, trembling with pride, kissed
the royal hands and set out on his journey. His last memory of
Louis was of a boyish figure in a surcoat of blue samite, gazing
tenderly on him as of bidding farewell to a brother.</p>

<p>The Grand Master of the Templars, sitting in a furred robe in
a warm upper chamber, for he had an ague on him, spoke gloomily
of the mission. He would have preferred to make alliance with
the Soldan of Egypt, and by his aid recover the Holy Cities. "What
Khakan is this?" he cried, "to whom it is a journey of a lifetime
to come nigh? What kind of Christian will you make of men that
have blood for drink and the flesh of babes for food, and blow
hither and thither on horses like sandstorms? Yours is a mad venture,
young sir, and I see no good that can come of it."  Nevertheless
he wrote letters of commendation to the Prince of Antioch and
the Constable of Armenia; and he brought together all those about
the place who had travelled far inland to make a chart of the
journey.</p>

<p>Aimery heeded little the Templar's forebodings, for his heart
had grown high again and romance was kindling his fancy. There
was a knuckle of caution in him, for he had the blood of Flemish
traders in his veins, though enriched by many nobler streams.
"The profit is certain," a cynic had whispered to him ere they
left Aigues Mortes. "Should we conquer we shall grow rich, and
if we fail we shall go to heaven." The phrase had fitted some
of his moods, notably the black ones at Limasol, but now he was
all aflame with the quixotry of the Crusader. He neither needed
nor sought wealth, nor was he concerned about death. His feet
trod the sacred soil of his faith, and up in the hills which rimmed
the seaward plain lay all the holiness of Galilee and Nazareth,
the three tabernacles built by St. Peter on the Mount of Transfiguration,
the stone whence Christ ascended into heaven, the hut at Bethlehem
which had been the Most High's cradle, the sanctuary of Jerusalem
whose every stone was precious. Presently his King would win it
all back for God. But for him was the sterner task&mdash;no clean blows
in the mellay among brethren, but a lone pilgrimage beyond the
east wind to the cradle of all marvels. The King had told him
that he carried the hopes of Christendom in his wallet; he knew
that he bore within himself the delirious expectation of a boy.
Youth swelled his breast and steeled his sinews and made a golden
mist for his eyes. The new, the outlandish, the undreamed-of!
&mdash;Surely no one of the Seven Champions had had such fortune!
Scribes long after would write of the deeds of Aimery of Beaumanoir,
and minstrels would sing of him as they sang of Roland and Tristan.</p>

<p>The Count of Jaffa, whose tower stood on the borders and who
was therefore rarely quit of strife, convoyed him a stage or two
on his way. It was a slender company: two Franciscans bearing
the present of Louis to the Khakan&mdash;a chapel-tent of scarlet cloth
embroidered inside with pictures of the Annunciation and the Passion;
two sumpter mules with baggage; Aimery's squire, a lad from the
Boulonnais; and Aimery himself mounted on a Barbary horse warranted
to go far on little fodder. The lord of Jaffa turned back when
the snows of Lebanon were falling behind on their right. He had
nodded towards the mountains.</p>

<p>"There lives the Old Man and his Ishmaelites. Fear nothing, for
his fangs are drawn." And when Aimery asked the cause of the impotence
of the renowned Assassins, he was told&mdash;"That Khakan whom ye seek."</p>

<p>After that they made good speed to the city of Antioch, where
not so long before angels from heaven had appeared as knights
in white armour to do battle for the forlorn Crusaders. There
they were welcomed by the Prince and sent forward into Armenia,
guided by the posts of the Constable of that harassed kingdom.
Everywhere the fame of the Tartars had gone abroad, and with each
mile they journeyed the tales became stranger. Conquerers and
warriors beyond doubt, but grotesque paladins for the Cross. Men
whispered their name with averted faces, and in the eyes of the
travelled ones there was the terror of sights remembered outside
the mortal pale. Aimery's heart was stout, but he brooded much
as the road climbed into the mountains. Far off in Cyprus the
Khakan had seemed a humble devotee at Christ's footstool, asking
only to serve and learn; but now he had grown to some monstrous
Cyclops beyond the stature of man, a portent like a thundercloud
brooding over unnumbered miles. Besides, the young lord was homesick,
and had long thoughts of Alix his wife and the son she had borne
him. As he looked at the stony hills he remembered that it would
now be springtide in Picardy, when the young green of the willows
fringed every watercourse and the plovers were calling on the
windy downs.</p>

<p>The Constable of Armenia dwelt in a castle of hewn stone about
which a little city clustered, with mountains on every side to
darken the sky, He was as swarthy as a Saracen and had a long
nose like a Jew, but he was a good Christian and a wise ruler,
though commonly at odds with his cousin of Antioch. From him Aimery
had more precise news of the Khakan.</p>

<p>There were two, said the Constable. "One who rules all Western
Asia east of the Sultan's principates. Him they call the Ilkhan
for title, and Houlagou for name. His armies have eaten up the
Chorasmians and the Muscovites and will presently bite their way
into Christendom, unless God change their heart. By the Gospels,
they are less and more than men. Swinish drinkers and gluttons,
they rise from their orgies to sweep the earth like a flame. Here
inside our palisade of rock we wait fearfully."</p>

<p>"And the other?" Aimery asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, he is as much the greater as the sun is greater than a star.
Kublai they name him, and he is in some sort the lord of Houlagou.
I have never met the man who has seen him, for he dwells as far
beyond the Ilkhan as the Ilkhan is far from the Pillars of Hercules.
But rumour has it that he is a clement and beneficent prince,
terrible in battle, but a lover of peace and all good men. They
tell wonders about his land of Cathay, where strips of parchment
stamped with the King's name take the place of gold among the
merchants, so strong is that King's honour. But the journey to
Cambaluc, the city of Kublai, would fill a man's lifetime."</p>

<p>One April morning they heard mass after the odd Syrian fashion,
and turned their faces eastward. The Constable's guides led them
through the mountains, up long sword-cuts of valleys and under
frowning snowdrifts, or across stony barrens where wretched beehive
huts huddled by the shores of unquiet lakes. Presently they came
into summer, and found meadows of young grass and green forests
on the hills' skirts, and saw wide plains die into the blueness
of morning. There the guides left them, and the little cavalcade
moved east into unknown anarchies.</p>

<p>The sky grew like brass over their heads, and the land baked
and rutted with the sun's heat. It seemed a country empty of man,
though sometimes they came on derelict ploughlands and towns of
crumbling brick charred and glazed by fire. In sweltering days
they struggled through flats where the grass was often higher
than a horse's withers, and forded the tawny streams which brought
down the snows of the hills. Now and then they would pass wandering
herdsmen, who fled to some earth-burrow at their appearance. The
Constable had bidden them make for the rising sun, saying that
sooner or later they would foregather with the Khakan's scouts.
But days passed into weeks and weeks into months, and still they
moved through a tenantless waste. They husbanded jealously the
food they had brought, but the store ran low, and there were days
of empty stomachs and light heads. Unless, like the King of Babylon,
they were to eat grass in the fashion of beasts, it seemed they
must soon famish.</p>

<p>But late in summertime they saw before them a wall of mountain,
and in three days climbed by its defiles to a pleasant land, where
once more they found the dwellings of man. It appeared that they
were in a country where the Tartars had been for some time settled
and which had for years been free of the ravages of war. The folks
were hunters and shepherds who took the strangers for immortal
beings and offered food on bent knees like oblations to a god.
They knew where the Ilkhan dwelt, and furnished guides for each
day's journey. Aimery, who had been sick of a low fever in the
plains, and had stumbled on in a stupor torn by flashes of homesickness,
found his spirits reviving. He had cursed many times the futility
of his errand. While the Franciscans were busied with their punctual
offices and asked nothing of each fresh day but that it should
be as prayerful as the last, he found a rebellious unbelief rising
in his heart. He was travelling roads no Christian had ever trod,
on a wild-goose errand, while his comrades were winning fame in
the battle-front. Alas! that a bright sword should rust in these
barrens!</p>

<p>But with the uplands peace crept into his soul and some of the
mystery of his journey. It was a brave venture, whether it failed
or no, for he had already gone beyond the pale even of men's dreams.
The face of Louis hovered before him. It needed a great king even
to conceive such a mission.... He had been sent on a king's errand
too. He stood alone for France and the Cross in a dark world.
Alone, as kings should stand, for to take all the burden was the
mark of kingship. His heart bounded at the thought, for he was
young. His father had told him of that old Flanders grandam, who
had sworn that his blood came from proud kings.</p>

<p>But chiefly he thought of Louis with a fresh warmth of love.
Surely the King loved him, or he would not have chosen him out
of many for this fateful work. He had asked of him the ultimate
service, as a friend should. Aimery reconstructed in his inner
vision all his memories of the King: the close fair hair now thinning
about the temples; the small face still contoured like a boy's;
the figure strung like a bow; the quick, eager gestures; the blue
dove's eyes, kindly and humble, as became one whose proudest title
was to be a "sergeant of the Crucified." But those same eyes could
also steel and blaze, for his father had been called the Lion,
his mother Semiramis, and his grandsire Augustus. In these wilds
Aimery was his vicegerent and bore himself proudly as the proxy
of such a monarch.</p>

<p>The hour came when they met the Tartar outposts. A cloud of horse
swept down on them, each man riding loose with his hand on a taut
bowstring. In silence they surrounded the little party, and their
leader made signs to Aimery to dismount. The Constable had procured
for him a letter in Tartar script, setting out the purpose of
his mission. This the outpost could not read, but they recognised
some word among the characters, and pointed it out to each other
with uncouth murmurings. They were strange folk, with eyes like
pebbles and squat frames and short, broad faces, but each horse
and man moved in unison like a centaur.</p>

<p>With gestures of respect the Tartars signalled to the Christians
to follow, and led them for a day and a night southward down a
broad valley, where vines and fruit trees grew and peace dwelt
in villages. They passed encampments of riders like themselves,
and little scurries of horsemen would ride athwart their road
and exchange greetings. On the second morning they reached a city,
populous in men but not in houses. For miles stretched lines of
skin tents, and in the heart of them by the river's edge stood
a great hall of brick, still raw from the builders.</p>

<p>Aimery sat erect on his weary horse with the hum of an outlandish
host about him, himself very weary and very sick at heart. For
the utter folly of it all had come on him like the waking from
a dream. These men were no allies of the West. They were children
of the Blue Wolf, as the Constable had said, a monstrous brood,
swarming from the unknown to blight the gardens of the world.
A Saracen compared to such was a courteous knight.... He thought
of Kublai, the greater Khakan. Perhaps in his court might dwell
gentlehood and reason. But here was but a wolf pack in the faraway
guise of man.</p>

<p>They gave the strangers food and drink&mdash;halfcooked fish and a
porridge of rye and sour spiced milk, and left them to sleep until
sundown. Then the palace guards led them to the presence.</p>

<p>The hall was immense, dim and shapeless like the inside of a
hill, not built according to the proportions of mankind. Flambeaux
and wicks floating in great basins of mutton fat showed a dense
concourse of warriors, and through an aisle of them Aimery approached
the throne. In front stood a tree of silver, springing from a
pedestal of four lions whose mouths poured streams of wine, syrup,
and mead into basins, which were emptied by a host of slaves,
the cup-bearers of the assembly. There were two thrones side by
side, on one of which sat a figure so motionless that it might
have been wrought of jasper. Weighted with a massive head-dress
of pearls and a robe of gold brocade, the little grandchild of
Prester John seemed like a doll on which some princess had lavished
wealth and fancy. The black eyelashes lay quiet on her olive cheeks,
and her breathing did not stir her stiff, jewelled bodice.</p>

<p>"I have seen death in life," thought Aimery as he shivered and
looked aside.</p>

<p>Houlagou, her husband, was a tall man compared with the others.
His face was hairless, and his mouth fine and cruel. His eyes
were hard like agates, with no light in them. A passionless power
lurked in the low broad forehead, and the mighty head sunk deep
between the shoulders; but the power not of a man, but of some
abortion of nature, like storm or earthquake. Again Aimery shivered.
Had not the prophets foretold that one day Antichrist would be
reborn in Babylon?</p>

<p>Among the Ilkhan's scribes was a Greek who spoke a bastard French
and acted as interpreter. King Louis' letter was read, and in
that hall its devout phrases seemed a mockery. The royal gifts
were produced, the tent-chapel with its woven pictures and the
sacred utensils. The half-drunk captains fingered them curiously,
but the eyes from the throne scarcely regarded them.</p>

<p>"These are your priests," said the Khakan "Let them talk with
my priests and then go their own way. I have little concern with
priestcraft."</p>

<p>Then Aimery spoke, and the Greek with many haltings translated.
He reminded Houlagou of the Tartar envoys who had sought from
his King instruction in the Christian faith and had proclaimed
his baptism.</p>

<p>"Of that I know nothing," was the answer. "Maybe 'twas some whim
of my brother Kublai. I have all the gods I need."</p>

<p>With a heavy heart Aimery touched on the proposed alliance, the
advance on Bagdad, and the pinning of the Saracens between two
fires. He spoke as he had been ordered, but with a bitter sense
of futility, for what kind of ally could be looked for in this
proud pagan?</p>

<p>The impassive face showed no flicker of interest.</p>

<p>"I am eating up the Caliphs," he said, "but that food is for
my own table. As for allies, I have need of none. The children
of the Blue Wolf do not make treaties."</p>

<p>Then he spoke aside to his captains, and fixed Aimery with his
agate eyes. It was like listening to a voice from a stone.</p>

<p>"The King of France has sent you to ask for peace. Peace, no
doubt, is good, and I will grant it of my favour. A tribute will
be fixed in gold and silver, and while it is duly paid your King's
lands will be safe from my warriors. Should the tribute fail,
France will be ours. I have heard that it is a pleasant place."</p>

<p>The Ilkhan signed that the audience was over. The fountains of
liquor ceased to play, and the drunken gathering stood up with
a howling like wild beasts to acclaim their King. Aimery went
back to his hut, and sat deep in thought far into the night.</p>

<p>He perceived that the shadows were closing in upon him. He must
get the friars away, and with them a message to his master. For
himself there could be no return, for he could not shame his King
who had trusted him. In the bestial twilight of this barbaric
court the memory of Louis shone like a star. He must attempt to
reach Kublai, of whom men spoke well, though the journey cost
him his youth and his life. It might mean years of wandering,
but there was a spark of hope in it. There, in the bleak hut,
he suffered the extreme of mental anguish. A heavy door seemed
to have closed between him and all that he held dear. He fell
on his knees and prayed to the saints to support his loneliness.
And then he found comfort, for had not God's Son suffered even
as he, and left the bright streets of Paradise for loneliness
among the lost?</p>

<p>Next morning he faced the world with a clearer eye. It was not
difficult to provide for the Franciscans. They, honest men, understood
nothing save that the Tartar king had not the love of holy things
for which they had hoped. They explained the offices of the Church
as well as they could to ribald and uncomprehending auditors,
and continued placidly in their devotions. As it chanced, a convoy
was about to start for Muscovy, whence by ship they might come
to Constantinople. The Tartars made no objection to their journey,
for they had some awe of these pale men and were glad to be quit
of foreign priestcraft. With them Aimery sent a letter in which
he told the King that the immediate errand had been done, but
that no good could be looked for from this western Khakan. "I
go," he said, "to Kublai the Great, in Cathay, who has a heart
more open to God. If I return not, know, Sire, that I am dead
in your most loving service, joyfully and pridefully as a Christian
knight dies for the Cross, his King, and his lady." He added some
prayers on behalf of the little household at Beaumanoir and sealed
it with his ring. It was the ring he had got from his father,
a thick gold thing in which had been cut his cognisance of three
lions' heads.</p>

<p>This done, he sought an audience with the Ilkhan, and told him
of his purpose. Houlagou did not speak for a little, and into
his set face seemed to creep an ill-boding shadow of a smile.
"Who am I," he said at length, "to hinder your going to my brother
Kublai? I will give you an escort to my eastern borders."</p>

<p>Aimery bent his knee and thanked him, but from the courtiers
rose a hubbub of mirth which chilled his gratitude. He was aware
that he sailed on very desperate waters.</p>

<p>Among the Tartars was a recreant Genoese who taught them metal
work and had once lived at the court of Cambaluc. The man had
glimmerings of honesty, and tried hard to dissuade Aimery from
the journey. "It is a matter of years," he told him, "and the
road leads through deserts greater than all Europe and over mountains
so high and icy that birds are frozen in the crossing. And a word
in your ear, my lord. The Ilkhan permits few to cross his eastern
marches. Beware of treason, I say. Your companions are the blood-thirstiest
of the royal guards."</p>

<p>But from the Genoese he obtained a plan of the first stages of
the road, and one morning in autumn he set out from the Tartar
city, his squire from the Boulonnais by his side, and at his back
a wild motley of horsemen, wearing cuirasses of red leather stamped
with the blue wolf of Houlagou's house.</p>

<p>October fell chill and early in those uplands, and on the fourth
day they came into a sprinkling of snow. At night round the fires
the Tartars made merry, for they had strong drink in many skin
bottles, and Aimery was left to his own cold meditations. If he
had had any hope, it was gone now, for the escort made it clear
that he was their prisoner. Judging from the chart of the Genoese,
they were not following any road to Cambaluc, and the sight of
the sky told him that they were circling round to the south. The
few Tartar words he had learned were not enough to communicate
with them, and in any case it was clear that they would take no
orders from him. He was trapped like a bird in the fowler's hands.
Escape was folly, for in an hour their swift horses would have
ridden him down. He had thought he had grown old, but the indignity
woke his youth again, and he fretted passionately. If death was
his portion, he longed for it to come cleanly in soldier fashion.</p>

<p>One night his squire disappeared. The Tartars, when he tried
to question them, only laughed and pointed westward. That was
the last he heard of the lad from the Boulonnais.</p>

<p>And then on a frosty dawn, when the sun rose red-rimmed over
the barrens, he noted a new trimness in his escort. They rode
in line, and they rode before and behind him, so that his captivity
was made patent. On a ridge far to the west he saw a great castle,
and he knew the palace of Houlagou. His guess had been right;
he had been brought back by a circuit to his starting-point.</p>

<p>Presently he was face to face with the Ilkhan, who was hunting.
The Greek scribe was with him, so the meeting had been foreseen.
The King's face was dark with the weather and his stony eyes had
a glow in them.</p>

<p>"O messenger of France," he said, "there is a little custom of
our people that I had forgotten. When a stranger warrior visits
us it is our fashion to pit him in a bout against one of our own
folk, so that if he leaves us alive he may speak well of his entertainment."</p>

<p>"I am willing," said Aimery. "I have but my sword for weapon."</p>

<p>"We have no lack of swordsmen," said the Ilkhan. "I would fain
see the Frankish way of it."</p>

<p>A man stepped out from the ring, a great square fellow shorter
by a head than Aimery, and with a nose that showed there was Saracen
blood in him. He had a heavy German blade, better suited for fighting
on horseback than on foot. He had no buckler, and no armour save
a headpiece, so the combatants were fairly matched.</p>

<p>It was a contest of speed and deftness against a giant's strength,
for a blow from the great weapon would have cut deep into a man's
vitals. Aimery was weary and unpractised, but the clash of steel
gave life to him. He found that he had a formidable foe, but one
who lacked the finer arts of the swordsman. The Tartar wasted
his strength in the air against the new French parries and guards,
though he drew first blood and gashed his opponent's left arm.
Aimery's light blade dazzled his eyes, and presently when breath
had grown short claimed its due. A deft cut on the shoulder paralysed
the Tartar's sword arm, and a breaststroke brought him to his
knees.</p>

<p>"Finish him," said the Ilkhan.</p>

<p>"Nay, sire," said Aimery, "it is not our custom to slay a disabled
foe."</p>

<p>Houlagou nodded to one of his guards, who advanced swinging his
sword. The defeated man seemed to know his fate, and stretched
out his neck. With a single blow his head rolled on the earth.</p>

<p>"You have some skill of the sword, Frenchman," said the Ilkhan.
"Hear, now, what I have decreed concerning you. I will have none
of this journey to my brother Kublai. I had purposed to slay you,
for you have defied my majesty. You sought to travel to Cathay
instead of bearing my commands forthwith to your little King.
But I am loath to kill so stout a warrior. Swear to me allegiance,
and you shall ride with me against the Caliphs."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse?" Aimery asked.</p>

<p>"Then you die ere sundown."</p>

<p>"I am an envoy, sire, from a brother majesty, and of such it
is the custom to respect the persons."</p>

<p>"Tush!" said the Ilkhan, "there is no brother majesty save Kublai.
Between us we rule the world."</p>

<p>"Hear me, then," said Aimery. The duel had swept all cobwebs
from his brain and doubts from his heart. "I am a knight of the
Sire Christ and of the most noble King Louis, and I can own no
other lord. Do your work, King. I am solitary among your myriads,
but you cannot bend me."</p>

<p>"So be it," said Houlagou.</p>

<p>"I ask two boons as one about to die. Let me fall in battle against
your warriors. And let me spend the hours till sundown alone,
for I would prepare myself for my journey."</p>

<p>"So be it," said Houlagou, and turned to his hounds.</p>

<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>The damoiseau of Beaumanoir sat on a ridge commanding for fifty
miles the snow-sprinkled uplands. The hum of the Tartars came
faint from a hollow to the west, but where he sat he was in quiet
and alone.</p>

<p>He had forgotten the ache of loss which had preyed on him....
His youth had not been squandered. The joy of young manhood which
had been always like a tune in his heart had risen to a nobler
song. For now, as it seemed to him, he stood beside his King,
and had found a throne in the desert. Alone among all Christian
men he had carried the Cross to a new world, and had been judged
worthy to walk in the footprints of his captain Christ. A great
gladness and a great humility possessed him.</p>

<p>He had ridden beyond the ken of his own folk, and no tale of
his end would ever be told in that northern hall of his when the
hearth-fire flickered on the rafters. That seemed small loss,
for they would know that he had ridden the King's path, and that
can have but the one ending.... Most clear in his memory now were
the grey towers by Canche, where all day long the slow river made
a singing among the reeds. He saw Alix his wife, the sun on her
hair, playing in the close with his little Philip. Even now in
the pleasant autumn weather that curly-pate would be scrambling
in the orchard for the ripe apples which his mother rolled to
him. He had thought himself born for a high destiny. Well, that
destiny had been accomplished. He would not die, but live in the
son of his body, and his sacrifice would be eternally a spirit
moving in the hearts of his seed. He saw the thing clear and sharp,
as if in a magic glass. There was a long road before the house
of Beaumanoir, and on the extreme horizon a great brightness.</p>

<p>Now he remembered that he had always known it, known it even
when his head had been busy with ardent hopes. He had loved life
and had won life everlasting. He had known it when he sought learning
from wise books. When he kept watch by his armour in the Abbey
church of Corbie and questioned wistfully the darkness, that was
the answer he had got. In the morning, when he had knelt in snow-white
linen and crimson and steel before the high altar and received
back his sword from God, the message had been whispered to his
heart. In the June dawn when, barefoot, he was given the pilgrim's
staff and entered on his southern journey, he had had a premonition
of his goal. But now what had been dim, like a shadow in a mirror,
was as clear as the colours in a painted psaltery. "Jerusalem,
Jerusalem," he sighed, as his King was wont to sigh. For he was
crossing the ramparts of the secret city.</p>

<p>He tried to take the ring from his finger that he might bury
it, for it irked him that his father's jewel should fall to his
enemies. But the wound had swollen his left hand, and he could
not move the ring.</p>

<p>He was looking westward, for that way lay the Holy Places, and
likewise Alix and Picardy. His minutes were few now, for he heard
the bridles of the guards, as they closed in to carry him to his
last fight.... He had with him a fragment of rye-cake and beside
him on the ridge was a little spring. In his helmet he filled
a draught, and ate a morsel. For, by the grace of the Church to
the knight in extremity, he was now sealed of the priesthood,
and partook of the mystic body and blood of his Lord....</p>

<p>Somewhere far off there was a grass fire licking the hills, and
the sun was setting in fierce scarlet and gold. The hollow of
the sky seemed a vast chapel ablaze with lights, like the lifting
of the Host at Candlemas.</p>

<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>The tale is not finished. For, as it chanced, one Maffeo of Venice,
a merchant who had strayed to the court of Cambaluc and found
favour there, was sent by Kublai the next year on a mission to
Europe, and his way lay through the camp of Houlagou. He was received
with honour, and shown the riches of the Tartar armies. Among
other things he heard of a Frankish knight who had fallen in battle
with Houlagou's champions, and won much honour, they said, having
slain three. He was shown the shrivelled arm of this knight, with
a gold ring on the third finger. Maffeo was a man of sentiment,
and begged for and was given the poor fragment, meaning to accord
it burial in consecrated ground when he should arrive in Europe.
He travelled to Bussorah, whence he came by sea to Venice. Now
at Venice there presently arrived the Count of St. Pol with a
company of Frenchmen, bound on a mission to the Emperor. Maffeo,
of whom one may still read in the book of Messer Marco Polo, was
become a famous man in the city, and strangers resorted to his
house to hear his tales and see his treasures. From him St. Pol
learned of the dead knight, and, reading the cognisance on the
ring, knew the fate of his friend. On his return journey he bore
the relic to Louis at Paris, who venerated it as the limb of a
saint; and thereafter took it to Beaumanoir, where the Lady Alix
kissed it with proud tears. The arm in a rich casket she buried
below the chapel altar, and the ring she wore till her death.</p>
