<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Ned Preston read the note to Deerfoot, the Shawanoe, speaking
slowly and distinctly each word, while the young Indian listened
with an expression of intense interest and pleasure.</p>

<p>"If the Colonel sees that, then will he read those words you
have spoken to me?"</p>

<p>"They will be the same."</p>

<p>"Then he shall see them."</p>

<p>As the young warrior spoke, he extended his hand for the missive,
which was given him. He deftly drew an arrow from his quiver and
began tying the letter to the missile, doing it with much care,
for the task he was about to essay seemed an almost impossible
one.</p>

<p>"We are a hundred yards from the block-house," said Ned Preston;
"it is a long shot for the bow and arrow."</p>

<p>"Would my brother like to use his gun?" asked Deerfoot with his
shadowy smile, his question being intended to remind his friend
of the superiority of the primitive weapon over the rifle, at
least in such an emergency as the present.</p>

<p>"The gun is of no use just now," said Preston, "and I mistrust
that your bow will not serve you as well as you think."</p>

<p>"You shall see," was the comment of the owner, who gave his full
attention to the task before him. He used a shred of deer-sinew
and fastened the letter directly behind the iron barb. That done,
the faithful bow was carefully strung, and then the youth bent
himself to the work.</p>

<p>His intention was to send the arrow, if possible, through the
narrow window to the left of the front door of the block-house.
This had no glass, nor screen, but as it was no more than eight
inches wide, although three times as high, and as the shaft was
weighted with a foreign substance, likely to affect its accuracy
of flight, some idea of the difficulty of the feat may be gained.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it was necessary that the shot should be fired secretly.
Deerfoot had no opportunity of standing out on the open ground,
where his limbs would be unimpeded, but he must aim from behind
the bank, so that no vigilant Wyandot would detect him.</p>

<p>He set to work, standing below the bank and pointing between
an intervening bush or two, making sure, however, that an unobstructed
path was open for his arrow. The missile was pointed at an elevation
of fully forty-five degrees; and, with one eye closed, he slowly
drew back the string until the head touched the right hand, which
grasped the middle of the bow.</p>

<p>It was held thus ten seconds, during which the athlete was as
rigid and motionless as if moulded in iron, while his eye rested
on the narrow slit-like window cut in the solid logs, all of a
hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Ned Preston kept his gaze fixed on the Indian, who at that moment
formed a picture worthy of the finest artist that ever touched
brush to canvas.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a faint twang, the bow straightened out like
lightning, and the arrowy messenger started on its path weighted
with the all-important message.</p>

<p>Preston instantly glanced at the block-house, centering his eye
on the straight opening, but with scarcely a hope that Deerfoot
could succeed in what would certainly be a marvelous exploit.</p>

<p>As the arrow was speeding directly away from the lads, it was
impossible to distinguish its course through the air, though it
could have been seen easily, had they been stationed at right
angles to its line of flight.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe, having discharged the weapon, immediately lowered
it, and then peered forward to learn the result of his shot.</p>

<p>But Preston had scarcely time to fix his gaze on the distant
window, when he saw something like the flutter of a shadow&mdash;so
to speak&mdash;directly in the opening itself. It came and went with
the quickness of a flash, and he could not define it.</p>

<p>But where was the arrow?</p>

<p>It vanished from sight the instant it left the bowstring, and
Ned had not seen it since. It should have struck somewhere in
a very few seconds, but had the head buried itself in the ground
between the river and the block-house, the eagle-feather would
have been visible. Had it fallen on the roof, its sharp point
would have held the shaft motionless.</p>

<p>"You must have sent it over the block-house," said Ned, turning
to Deerfoot; "and in that case&#11834;"</p>

<p>He stopped, for the same shadowy smile on the handsome face of
the young Shawanoe told the truth: the arrow had gone directly
through the window, and the curious fluttering shadow which caught
the eye of Preston was the missile with its message.</p>

<p>"That is the most wonderful shot I ever saw!" exclaimed Ned in
a burst of admiration; "if I could use the bow as you do, I never
would touch a gun. But, Deerfoot, is there not danger that some
of the Wyandots saw the arrow in its flight?"</p>

<p>"If they were looking across the clearing, they saw it perhaps;
but Deerfoot hopes they did not."</p>

<p>"Suppose you had missed the window,&mdash;that the arrow had struck
the roof, or the ground, or the logs at the side of the opening,
it would have buried its head and stayed in plain sight, would
it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the Wyandots would be certain to see it."</p>

<p>"And would soon know where it came from?"</p>

<p>"Nothing could have prevented."</p>

<p>"My gracious!" exclaimed Ned; "you ran a great risk."</p>

<p>"We did; there was no way to prevent it."</p>

<p>Ned was almost speechless, when he realized how much had depended
on the success of the shot of the Shawanoe: in fact, had he known
all, he never would have consented that the task should have been
attempted.</p>

<p>Had the arrow gone a few inches to the right or left, or had
it fallen short, or flown too high, the Wyandots would have swooped
down on the archer and his friends, before they could have left
the spot.</p>

<p>Ned Preston regarded the shot as amazing as the mythical one
made by William Tell; and, but for the urgency of the danger,
would have given further expression to his admiration. Deerfoot
himself was somewhat uneasy, and, for several minutes, glanced
right and left, and through the undergrowth for signs of danger;
but nothing appeared, and it looked as though a piece of extremely
good fortune had attended the remarkable exploit.</p>

<p>Such being the case, Preston now devoted his attention to the
window, from which he expected to see the hand of his uncle, Colonel
Preston, waving in friendly signal for them to make the desperate
run across the clearing.</p>

<p>While he was thus employed, the keener vision of the Shawanoe
was roaming over the open space, each side of the stockade, the
woods beyond, and especially did he scrutinize the two deserted
cabins that stood to the right.</p>

<p>The visual search had not continued long, when it was rewarded
by the unwelcome discovery that in the building nearest him were
several Wyandots, who had probably spent the night there. He saw
their heads and shoulders, as they passed the windows where they
were beyond sight of the garrison, but were in plain view of the
Shawanoe.</p>

<p>This cabin was much nearer the block-house than were the boys,
from which the daring nature of the project will be understood.
Deerfoot was hopeful before this that the houses were clear of
Wyandots, in which event his friends would have had a much better
prospect of success.</p>

<p>As it was, it all depended on how complete the surprise could
be made for the red men. If they failed to note the running youths
until the block-house was nearly reached, they would be too late
to head them off, except by a shot from their guns, and this risk
could not be avoided under any circumstances.</p>

<p>"<em>There it is!</em>"</p>

<p>It was Ned Preston who uttered the exclamation in such excitement
that his voice was dangerously high.</p>

<p>"Sh! not so loud!" whispered Deerfoot, scrutinizing the window
through which he sent his arrow a few minutes before.</p>

<p>Ned Preston was right: the hand of a person was thrust through
the opening and waved several times. It swayed back and forth,
and up and down, with much deliberation, as though the owner was
fearful it would not be observed by his friends along the river
bank.</p>

<p>More than that, Deerfoot was sure he saw the face of the one
who signalled them, though the distance was such that nothing
like a recognition took place.</p>

<p>After withdrawing his hand, it was put forth again, and the motion
was repeated. Colonel Preston evidently meant that, if any mistake
was made, it should not be his fault.</p>

<p>Ned Preston now carefully awakened Blossom Brown and explained
what had been done and what was contemplated.</p>

<p>"You have got to run as you never ran before," said his master,
"and when you have once started, there is no turning back."</p>

<p>"What would I want to turn back for?" was the wondering question
of the African.</p>

<p>"You might think it better to stay where we are, and it may be
that it is; but after the Wyandots learn we are here, it is run
or die with us."</p>

<p>"My brother speaks the truth," said Deerfoot, who was looking
across the clearing at the nearest cabin: "there are red men there,
and they will try and hinder you from reaching your friends."</p>

<p>There was no reason to hope the prospect would improve by waiting,
and it was decided to start at once. Deerfoot, it was understood,
was to remain where he was and to make no attempt for the present
to enter the block-house. It was expected that, after Blossom
and Ned were safely within the building, the guide would hasten
to Wild Oaks and bring assistance to the beleaguered garrison.</p>

<p>When the boys were ready, the Shawanoe impressed one fact upon
them: they were not to cease running for an instant, unless stopped
beyond all power to overcome, but, fixing their eyes on the door
of the block-house, strain every nerve to reach the goal.</p>

<p>Each lad was to carry his loaded gun in his right hand, but not
to use it, unless forced to do so: if Colonel Preston should delay
admitting them, they would be lost; but there was no cause to
fear such a miscarriage.</p>

<p>The boys stealthily moved forward and up the bank, and, pausing
near the margin, awaited the word from the Shawanoe. The perilous
point, in the eye of the latter, was the cabin where he knew the
Wyandots to be, and he watched it closely for several minutes.
Nothing was to be seen of them just then, and he said in a low
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go!"</p>

<p>On the instant, Ned Preston and Blossom Brown bounded across
the clearing in the direction of the block-house: it was a straight
run of a hundred yards over a level piece of land, on which only
a few stumps remained to show that it was once covered by the
forest.</p>

<p>The African, it need not be said, strained every nerve and fibre
of his being to reach the goal. His heavy, lumbering build made
him less fleet than Preston, who could have drawn away from the
beginning; but he could not desert his companion in such extremity
and he timed his speed, so as to keep just ahead of Blossom, and
thus urge him to his utmost.</p>

<p>Crouching under the shelter of the river bank, Deerfoot watched
the run for life with the intensest interest. He grasped his strong
bow with his right hand, while one of his arrows was held in the
left, ready to use on the instant it might become necessary for
the safety of either of the fugitives.</p>

<p>Those who knew Deerfoot best, said he was reluctant to employ
his marvelous skill on any person, and would not do so as long
as it was safe to refrain; but it would have required only a single
glance at his glittering eye and compressed lips, to understand
that he considered the emergency was now at hand.</p>

<p>It so happened that the fugitives had gone no more than ten yards
on their swift run, when the Wyandots in the cabin discovered
them and made known the fact in the most alarming manner.</p>

<p>First several whoops broke the stillness within the building,
and then two sharp reports followed. The Wyandots had fired, but
their aim was so hurried that, as it seemed to Deerfoot, neither
of the fugitives was harmed. At least they continued their flight
with unabated speed.</p>

<p>But the efforts of the Wyandots to check the boys was not to
end with the simple discharge of their rifles. The two that had
used their pieces, sprang from the front windows of the cabin
and dashed quartering across the clearing, with the intent to
head off the youths, before they could reach the block-house.</p>

<p>This brought both in range of the terrible bow of Deerfoot who
placed the arrow in position; but it was his intention to hold
the weapon until it should become imperatively necessary to use
it, for it will be seen that, if he took part in the singular
contest, it would be such a complete unveiling of his true character
that his usefulness to the whites would be almost destroyed.</p>

<p>Besides, each boy carried a loaded rifle which he knew how to
use, and it was not to be supposed that either would allow himself
to be tomahawked or taken prisoner without resistance.</p>

<p>The Wyandots who ran forth in the effort to throw themselves
across the path of the fugitives, were as daring warriors as ever
mingled in the fierce fight with settlers or those of their own
race. They had emptied their guns in the futile effort to bring
down the boys, and, throwing the weapons aside, they now sprang
forward with the resolution to make them prisoners, despite the
risk to themselves, for they must have known that the garrison
would endeavor to protect their friends, and they could not help
suspecting that there was one or more along the river bank, who
were likely to take part in the singular struggle.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the red men ran straight from the deserted
cabin across the path of the boys, who found themselves confronted
by the brawny redskins, before they had gone half the distance
to the building.</p>

<p>"Let's sneak 'round ahind de block-house and climb ober de fence
and hide," said Blossom, when he saw the gauntlet he had to run.</p>

<p>"Straight for the door!" commanded Preston: "that is our only
chance!"</p>

<p>But the youth had scarcely spoken the words, when he saw that
a collision with the Wyandots was inevitable: they were between
them and the fort, and there was no possible way of flanking them.</p>

<p>The superior fleetness of Ned held him slightly in advance of
his companion. The former ran until close to the Wyandots, when
he turned to the left. The warriors immediately leaped forward
so that they were still directly in front of the fugitives.</p>

<p>"It must be done!" exclaimed Ned, coming to an instant halt,
raising his rifle and aiming at the nearest Indian, who was in
the very act of poising himself to throw his tomahawk.</p>

<p>Everything passed so swiftly that the spectators could scarcely
follow the movements. At the moment Ned drew his gun to position,
he caught the flash of the implement as it circled with lightning
quickness over the bronzed skull of his enemy.</p>

<p>Young Preston knew what was coming. Pausing only long enough
to catch the gleam of the warrior's eyes, over the sights of his
rifle, he pressed the trigger.</p>

<p>The Indian aimed at the head of the youth and drove the tomahawk
with prodigious force and unerring accuracy; but the blade of
the implement glanced against the barrel of the rifle, sending
out a streak of flame, and, with a tremendous rebound or ricochet,
shot by the shoulder of the lad, touching the ground fifty feet
away, and rolling over and over several times, before it lay still.
When it left the hand of the warrior, it was with a force that
would have cloven the skull of the lad, as though it were cardboard.</p>

<p>The throw and miss were remarkable, but, by a striking coincidence,
the rifle of Ned Preston was discharged at the second the two
weapons collided. The violent shock to the gun turned it aside,
and the ball buried itself harmlessly in the ground, far to the
right of the crouching Wyandot.</p>

<p>The latter saw by what a hair's-breadth he had escaped, and snatching
his hunting-knife from the belt at his waist, he bounded toward
the youth, who, nothing daunted, recoiled a single step, and,
grasping his weapon by its barrel, awaited the attack.</p>

<p>All this took place in a few seconds, during which the other
Wyandot, feeling that the dark-faced fugitive was his own, watched
the extraordinary conflict, with an interest as intense as that
of the other spectators further away.</p>

<p>Had the encounter between young Preston and the sinewy Wyandot
been permitted to go on, there could have been but one result;
but Deerfoot, who was holding his breath, with his eyes riveted
on the combatants, now drew his arrow to its head and aimed at
the assailing warrior.</p>

<p>Although the distance between him and his target was no more
than half way across the clearing, yet the feat was immeasurably
more difficult than that of sending the letter through the narrow
window; for, unfortunately, Ned Preston and the Wyandot were standing
so nearly in a line that the young Shawanoe could only see the
head and shoulders of the powerful savage a few feet beyond.</p>

<p>Beside this, the two were likely to change their respective positions
any instant: they might do so indeed after the launching of the
arrow, which would not only miss the red man at whom it was pointed,
but was liable to strike the boy himself.</p>

<p>Even Deerfoot doubted his own success and he therefore aimed
with the greater care and caution, slowly drawing back the shaft,
and with nerves like iron, looked steadily along the reed and
at the tableau far beyond.</p>

<p>But before the fingers let go the string, the necessity for doing
so vanished. The incidents which we have undertaken to describe,
passed with such swiftness that it would have been hard for a
spectator to follow each phase, few as they were; but it need
not be said that every man within the block-house was watching
the extraordinary scene on the clearing with an interest as intense,
as absorbing and breathless, as that of Deerfoot himself.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston was standing by the door, with one hand on the
cumbersome latch, ready to draw it inward the instant the boys
reached the proper point; while Jo Stinger, Jim Turner and Sam
Megill held their rifles ready to use, the very second it should
become necessary.</p>

<p>There was such bewildering rapidity in the events narrated, that
the spectators within the block-house did not comprehend the extreme
peril of young Preston, until they saw the Wyandot advancing on
him with his drawn knife.</p>

<p>"Boys," said Jo Stinger, "it's the opinion of the undersigned
that this is a good time of day to fire off a gun."</p>

<p>"Quick!" called out Colonel Preston from below, as he peeped
through the door; "shoot that Indian!"</p>

<p>"That's just what is contemplated," replied Stinger, whose rifle
was already thrust through a loophole, while he was looking along
the gleaming barrel.</p>

<p>But, to the consternation of the veteran, the moment he drew
bead on the warrior, he discovered he stood in such exact line
with young Preston that it was impossible to shoot the red man
without the absolute certainty of striking the lad directly beyond.</p>

<p>"I've got to wait," called out Jo, by way of explaining his inaction,
"until they shift their positions."</p>

<p>Had the vengeful Wyandot comprehended the vast advantage he gained
by holding the youth directly in front, he would have continued
to do so; but it was almost impossible that he should have been
subtle enough to make such a discovery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ned Preston, daring, resolute and defiant, grasped
the barrel of his rifle, and with one foot thrown forward, and
with the stock of his gun flung back in the position, and with
the pose of a skilled batsman awaiting the pitching of a ball,
braced himself for the assault.</p>

<p>The Indian, powerful, active and alert, bent his knees and back
slightly, like a panther gathering for a leap, and glared in the
face of the youthful David, who so calmly confronted the fierce
Goliath.</p>

<p>It was a trying position for the boy, who looked dauntlessly
into the hideous countenance daubed with ochre and paint. It was
probably the truth that the Wyandot was testing the power of his
eye, as the rattle-snake does with the bird. If such were the
case, the result could not have been gratifying to the warrior.</p>

<p>All at once, without removing his eyes from those of Ned, the
Indian deftly extended his left foot slightly forward and a brief
distance to one side. Then he gradually shifted the weight of
his body over upon it, until he had transferred himself nearly
a foot out of alignment.</p>

<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe instantly detected this, and pointed his
arrow with full confidence; Jo Stinger was equally on the alert,
and his keen gray eye glanced along the barrel with more certainty;
but, not unnaturally perhaps, the two marksmen, from opposite
standpoints, understood the peculiar maneuvering which the Wyandot
had begun: he intended to circle slowly around the boy, who stood
on the defensive, watching for an opening, which he would seize
with the quickness of lightning.</p>

<p>If such should prove the fact, the spectators had but a short
while to wait: and such did prove to be the fact.</p>

<p>Once more the Wyandot moved his left foot, almost as far as the
limb permitted, and held it motionless, with the toe resting on
the ground. All the time his black eyes were fixed with burning
intensity on the youth, and his right hand grasped the haft of
the knife, as though he would crush it to nothingness.</p>

<p>Ned Preston suspected the purpose of his assailant and he instantly
turned, so as to face him, who had not such an easy task as might
have been supposed.</p>

<p>For a full minute, the left leg of the Wyandot remained extended,
with nothing but the toe of the foot daintily touching, as though
he meant to draw a line upon the earth with it. Then his weight
gracefully glided over upon the limb, the gleaming eyes never
once shifting from the pale face of the boy pioneer.</p>

<p>Scarcely was this movement&mdash;slight as it was&mdash;completed, when
the oppressive stillness was broken by the explosive report of
a rifle, a blue puff of smoke curled upward from one of the loopholes
of the block-house, and those who were looking at the Wyandot,
saw him suddenly throw his hands above his head, walk rapidly
and uncertainly backward several steps, and then, with a faint
cry, fall, with limbs outstretched, stone-dead.</p>

<p>The second warrior became so absorbed in the scene that he fixed
his gaze on the two, paying no heed to the African, who, he must
have believed, was at his mercy, when he chose to give his attention
to him.</p>

<p>With a shrewdness hardly to be expected, the servant was quick
to see that another's extremity was his opportunity.</p>

<p>"Nobody aint tinkin' 'bout Wildblossom Brown jes' now," was the
belief of the lad, "which shows dat it am a good time to tink
'bout hisself."</p>

<p>He immediately began what may be called a flank movement around
the three parties, who took no notice of him, although Deerfoot
and the onlookers in the block-house observed the prudent action
of the lad. They were greatly relieved, inasmuch as he could not
offer the slightest help by staying behind.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that, at the moment the rifle was fired
from the block-house, Blossom was well on his way toward it, and
his subsequent action was like that of a runner who awaited the
report as a signal. At the very instant it broke the stillness,
he made a burst of speed and ran with might and main straight
for shelter. The start that his own foresight had secured, placed
him so far in advance of his enemies that his safety was virtually
obtained.</p>

<p>"Open dat door!" he shouted in a voice that must have been heard
a half mile away; "open her wide, or I'll smash her in!"</p>

<p>He plunged across the clearing like a steam-engine, and the door
was drawn inward, while he was twenty paces distant, so that everything
was in his favor.</p>

<p>Without checking himself in the least he "took a header" through
the entrance and went clean across the lower floor and against
the opposite side of the room, with a force that shook the entire
building.</p>

<p>"My gracious, Blossom, it was a narrow escape!" exclaimed the
Colonel, alluding to the flight of the lad from the warrior who
had marked him for his own.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Blossom; "I like to have knocked my brains out agin
de oder side de ole fort."</p>

<p>"I'm more afraid the block-house has been injured than I am that
you have suffered; but you are safe now, and I can only hope that
Ned may be equally fortunate."</p>

<p>The address and courage displayed by the surviving Wyandot aroused
the admiration of the garrison, for it far surpassed their expectation.</p>

<p>The very instant the first red man was struck, and while he was
staggering backwards, Ned Preston started with might and main
for the sheltering block-house: he was thus quick to adopt the
only course that offered safety, for the other warrior still held
his knife and tomahawk at command, and was more alert, cunning
and brave than the one that had fallen.</p>

<p>Young Preston's promptness gained him considerable start, but
he was no more than fairly under way, when the other made for
him with the speed of a deer. Ned was fleet for his years, but
he was no match for the pursuing warrior, who gained rapidly.</p>

<p>The amazing daring of this pursuit can scarcely be explained:
the Wyandot was straining every nerve to overtake the fugitive,
who was striving with equal desperation to reach the block-house
before him. The red man held his formidable tomahawk in his right
hand, and was running straight toward the building from which
the shot was fired, and from which he must have known others were
certain to come. It was precisely as if a single soldier should
deliberately charge upon a masked battery, of whose precise location
he was well aware.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, the Wyandot had not run half the intervening
distance, when another blue puff, floating aside from the loophole,
accompanied the report of a rifle. Jim Turner had fired at the
approaching Wyandot, but he did it so hastily that he missed him
altogether.</p>

<p>  [Illustration: <em>NED MAKES A NARROW ESCAPE</em>.]</p>

<p>"Is there no way of stopping him?" muttered Sam Megill, hurriedly
bringing his gun to bear and discharging it; but, astonishing
as it may seem, he missed also.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger was hastily reloading his piece, determined that the
daring red man should not escape him, when Ned Preston dashed
through the door and was safe.</p>

<p>As the Colonel quickly shut and fastened the entrance, a heavy
thud was heard. The Wyandot had hurled his tomahawk with such
prodigious force at the vanishing fugitive that the blade was
buried half way to its head, and the handle projecting outward,
would have required a power like that of King Arthur to draw it
forth.</p>
