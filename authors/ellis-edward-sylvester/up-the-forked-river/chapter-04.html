<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>General Fernando De Bambos, President and Dictator of Zalapata,
had summoned one of the most momentous councils of war in the
history of the Republic. Those present were our old friend, Major
Jack Starland, who was a guest of the General, and Captain Alfredo
Guzman, Chief of Staff. The other leaders sulked because they
were not invited to the conference, but General Bambos dared not
trust them with the important matters that were oppressing his
ponderous brain and had troubled him for weeks.</p>

<p>The meeting was held in the upper room of the east wing of the
palace, safely removed from eavesdroppers, two armed guards on
the outside of the door adding to the isolation of the council.
General Bambos, though short of stature, weighed an eighth of
a ton. His uniform gleamed with blue, scarlet and gold, and the
crimson sash around his waist, with its gilt tassels almost touching
the floor, was six inches nearer his head in front than at the
rear. His crimson countenance was set off by a prodigious mustache,
the waxed ends of which, when he grinned, tickled his temples.
He was short-breathed, asthmatic and possessed a tempestuous temper.
The big curved sword at his side flipped the ground when he strode
to and fro, as was his custom while agitated, though during his
calmer moods, the formidable weapon swung fairly clear of the
floor.</p>

<p>Captain Guzman, Aide and Chief of Staff, was swarthy, deliberate
and cool, and of moderate stature. He had proved himself a good
soldier in more than one fight with their neighbors in that breeding-nest
of revolutions.</p>

<p>At the present time, the <em>Warrenia</em> was absent for a few
days at San Luis, down the river, while Jack Starland was the
honored guest of General Bambos, who was eager to secure his valuable
military ability for the republic. He really knew nothing of the
young American's experience in military matters, but he was not
ignorant of the bravery of his people, and had learned how completely
they crushed Spain in the late war. When he heard the youth addressed
as "Major" he was immediately fired with the ambition to gain
him as an ally, in the new revolution that was impending.</p>

<p>"Comrades," said the General, as he heaved ponderously to his
feet, addressing the two who sat at the table, listening expectantly
to him, "you will agree with me that golden opportunities come
to nations as well as to men. Such an opportunity has opened to
the Republic of Zalapata."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he leaned forward with his hands resting on the
table, and the chubby fingers doubled in upon the palms. His huge
mustache twitched, and his little black eyes shone upon the placid
countenance of Captain Guzman, lolling in his chair at the farther
end and languidly smoking a cigarette. The Captain calmly met
the flickering glare and the General shifted it to Major Starland
on his right, who was looking through the open window on the other
side of the apartment, as if the blue sky, with its fleecy clouds,
framed by the opening, was all that interested him. None the less,
he was thinking hard and not a word escaped him.</p>

<p>"I repeat that such an opportunity has now opened to the Republic
of Zalapata."</p>

<p>The thin husky voice climbed several notes of the register, and
the right hand of the speaker thumped so hard on the table that
it shook. The noise would have been considerable, had not the
impact been dulled by the fleshy cushion that smothered the knuckles
of the orator.</p>

<p>Without stirring a muscle, Major Starland glanced sideways at
the face of the General, who swung his head around like a turtle
peeping from his shell and stared again at Captain Guzman. The
latter snatched his cigarette from his lips and nodded quickly
several times.</p>

<p>General Bambos swung back to the upright poise, or rather went
a little beyond it since his bulky protuberance in front gave
him the appearance of leaning backward. The deepening crimson
of his countenance showed the profundity of his anger.</p>

<p>"How much longer shall we submit to the insults of that infamous
tyrant, President Yozarro of the Republic of Atlamalco. Actuated
by my fervent love of peace, my affection for my people, and my
ardent desire for their happiness, I have acquiesced in wrong,
vainly hoping that a sense of justice would restrain the oppressor
from going too far. But he mistakes our calmness for fear, until
every man of intelligence clearly perceives that unless resistance
is made,&mdash;not simple resistance alone, but aggressive protest,
the grand, glorious Republic of Zalapata will become a mere appanage
of Atlamalco. I have remonstrated with General Yozarro, and in
return he treats me with contumely and insult. My nature revolts,
my blood is stirred&mdash;"</p>

<p>To make more emphatic the ebullition of his circulation, General
Bambos abruptly stopped speaking and snatched out his perfumed
silk handkerchief from beneath the partly unbuttoned breast of
his coat, and mopped his lumpy forehead. He had carefully conned
his oration, but his surging emotion would not give him pause.
The climax leaped from him. At the highest reach of his vibrant,
staccato voice, he shouted:</p>

<p>"The time has come to draw the sword!"</p>

<p>Grasping the top of his scabbard with his left hand, and the
handle of his sword with his right, he made a curving swing upward,
while drawing the blade from its nestling place. There was always
difficulty in doing this, since when the arm was extended to its
limit, two or three inches of the point of the weapon remained
in the sheath. The only way to overcome the hitch was to push
downward and backward with the hand which inclosed the upper part
of the scabbard. In his excitement, the General forgot this necessity,
and, with the right arm extended to the highest elevation, the
weapon was not free from the incumbrance at the other end. He
tugged, swore under his breath and grew purple of countenance.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>THE TIME HAS COME TO DRAW THE SWORD</em>."]</p>

<p>Major Starland, without the shadow of a smile, looked at the
lower hand of the General and nodded meaningly. The other recovered
his wits at the same moment, liberated the blade by the method
indicated, and flourished it so far aloft that the keen point
nipped the ceiling.</p>

<p>"The time has come to draw the sword! Liberty, justice, equality
and right is the war cry of the patriots of Zalapata!"</p>

<p>Carefully adjusting his weapon so that it would not interfere,
the General sagged down in his chair, and puffing from his exertion
and excitement, looked into the faces of his friends to signify
that he was now ready to listen to their sentiments. A brief silence
followed, and then Major Starland said in an even voice:</p>

<p>"I have learned of some of the insults received from General
Yozarro, Dictator of the Republic to the west, but I am not clear
as to the last outrage: may I be enlightened?"</p>

<p>He looked invitingly at Captain Guzman, who silently puffed for
a minute or so before speaking:</p>

<p>"A month ago, the single boat which constitutes the navy of President
Yozarro was engaged in target practice; one of the shots passed
over the boundary and struck the dwelling of a citizen of Zalapata,
smashing in a side-wall and scaring the family to that extent
that they are still a-tremble. Complaint was made to President
Yozarro, who treated the complainant with contempt. Then appeal
was had to President Bambos, who despatched a messenger to Yozarro,
demanding damages and an apology, and the salutation of our flag.
What answer did the tyrant send? He kicked the messenger down
the steps of his palace, bidding him to tell our revered President
that if he or anyone else came to him on a similar errand, he
would ram him down the throat of one of his cannon and fire at
the palace of General Bambos."</p>

<p>"But that threat is idle," gravely remarked Major Starland.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded President Bambos.</p>

<p>"Neither he nor you have any ordnance big enough to allow a man
to serve as a charge for it."</p>

<p>"A quibble!" commented the Captain; "it does not lessen the deadly
nature of the insult."</p>

<p>"What is the amount of the claim?"</p>

<p>General Bambos nodded to the Captain to answer.</p>

<p>"Forty-two <em>pesos</em>."</p>

<p>"Ah-um!" mused the American, who picked up a pencil from the
table and made a few figures on a blotting pad; "the present value
of a <em>peso</em> is twenty-eight cents. That would make the
total damage eleven dollars and seventy-six cents in the currency
of my country. Does President Yozarro refuse to pay this claim?"</p>

<p>"He not only refuses to pay the just demand," thundered the President,
"but accompanies his refusal with an unpardonable insult."</p>

<p>"No one can deny that you have cause for indignation, but knowing
how deeply you have the good of your people and country at heart,
General, I would ask whether there is not some way of settling
the dispute without going to war."</p>

<p>"Explain yourself," said the President severely, for, having
set his heart on having war, he did not mean to be bluffed out
of it.</p>

<p>"Why not refer the dispute to The Hague Tribunal of Arbitration?"</p>

<p>"What good could come from that?"</p>

<p>"Suppose it decided in your favor and ordered General Yozarro
to pay the claim?"</p>

<p>"That wouldn't wipe out the insult."</p>

<p>"But, if he was ordered to apologize?"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't do it."</p>

<p>"How do you know he wouldn't?"</p>

<p>"Don't I know the man better than The Hague Tribunal or anyone
else knows him?"</p>

<p>"If you have so clear a case against President Yozarro, the decision
is sure to be in your favor."</p>

<p>"You forget, Sir, that The Hague has insulted the Republic of
Zalapata through its President."</p>

<p>"I was not aware of that."</p>

<p>"When the members assembled a short time ago, I sent a representative
with a request that he be permitted to act as one of them. Do
you know what reply was made? They said they had never heard of
the Republic of Zalapata."</p>

<p>"In other words, they told you to make a reputation first. Quite
natural, under the circumstances. Nevertheless, I would beg to
insist that the proper course is to refer this quarrel to The
Hague Tribunal, unless the President of the United States can
be induced to act as arbitrator. More than likely he will settle
the wrangle by paying the claim out of his own pocket."</p>

<p>"You mistake your man!" roared General Bambos; "you fail to see
that that would relieve General Yozarro from punishment for his
insults and outrages against Zalapata. It would encourage him
to continue his infamous course, since our powerful neighbor on
the north would relieve him from all penalty. Moreover, it would
display a fatal timidity on the part of the United States regarding
their pet idol,&mdash;the Monroe Doctrine. Such a subterfuge cannot
be permitted."</p>

<p>"I had thought of offering to pay the bill myself."</p>

<p>With fine sarcasm, General Bambos said: "I am glad you are provided
with a surfeit of funds. Perhaps you will be willing to float
our last loan?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon its size; if it isn't more than a few hundred
dollars I am quite ready to give you a lift."</p>

<p>"I must decline to permit any more quibbling."</p>

<p>"Will you consent that I shall close the incident by paying this
claim against President Yozarro of the Republic of Atlamalco?"</p>

<p>"I do if you will agree to enforce the other conditions."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"That he shall apologize, salute our flag and pledge himself
never again to turn his gun in the direction of our boundary line."</p>

<p>"You have added impossible terms, General, for you would bind
him to make no resistance in the event of your going to war with
him."</p>

<p>"And don't you perceive on your part that there is nothing to
arbitrate? This talk of arbitration is very fine for the one who
is in the wrong. Suppose a set of employees refuse to work any
longer unless their wages are doubled. The employer, knowing it
means his ruin, refuses, and the strikers demand that the dispute
shall be referred to arbitration. Is that just?&mdash;is it common
sense?"</p>

<p>"Not on the part of the employees. But your supposition is hardly
supposable; the employers would incur no risk in agreeing to arbitration,
since no committee on earth would fail to decide in their favor,
after the whole truth was made clear to them. I have noticed that
it is generally the one who is in the wrong who refuses to arbitrate.
At the same time, I concede that there can be no such thing as
forced arbitration. Every employer or capitalist has the right
to run his own business to suit himself, just as any man, or set
of men, have the right to quit work and to try to persuade their
friends to quit with them; but, your pardon, General; we are wandering
from the question."</p>

<p>"A suggestion I was about to make. When you reflect that a respectful
demand has been made upon President Yozarro for the payment of
a just claim, and that he brutally refuses, what would you advise,
most wise and honored Sir?"</p>

<p>"I have offered to pay the claim myself."</p>

<p>"Your offer is declined, since you cannot enforce all the conditions."</p>

<p>"I have named arbitration."</p>

<p>"And I have pointed out the impossible folly of such a thing."</p>

<p>"Admitting that President Yozarro refuses to comply with the
decision of The Hague Tribunal, you will not only be free to carry
out your original intention, but you will be justified before
the world."</p>

<p>"No more than I shall be justified now, for many of the Atlamalcans
themselves condemn the course of their President."</p>

<p>"Why not make one more appeal to him?"</p>

<p>"How shall I shape my message? Whom shall I send to bear it to
him?"</p>

<p>"I will be the messenger."</p>

<p>"And be returned to me from the throat of a cannon?"</p>

<p>"I will take my chances on that; if they have a gun capacious
enough to expedite matters in that fashion, the journey certainly
will not be a monotonous one. You forget one thing, General."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"My sister is the guest of President Yozarro; I am anxious to
see her; this gives me the opportunity."</p>
