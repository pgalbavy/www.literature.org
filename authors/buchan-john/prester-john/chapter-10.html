<p>For a mile or so I kept the bush, which was open and easy to
ride through, and then turned into the path.  The moon was high,
and the world was all a dim dark green, with the track a golden
ivory band before me.  I had looked at my watch before I started,
and seen that it was just after eight o'clock.  I had a great
horse under me, and less than thirty miles to cover. Midnight
should see me at the cave.  With the password I would gain admittance,
and there would wait for Laputa and Henriques.  Then, if my luck
held, I should see the inner workings of the mystery which had
puzzled me ever since the Kirkcaple shore.  No doubt I should
be roughly treated, tied up prisoner, and carried with the army
when the march began. But till Inanda's Kraal my life was safe,
and before that came the ford of the Letaba.  Colin would carry
my message to Arcoll, and at the Drift the tables would be turned
on Laputa's men.</p>

<p>Looking back in cold blood, it seems the craziest chain of accidents
to count on for preservation.  A dozen possibilities might have
shattered any link of it.  The password might be wrong, or I might
never get the length of those who knew it. The men in the cave
might butcher me out of hand, or Laputa might think my behaviour
a sufficient warrant for the breach of the solemnest vow.  Colin
might never get to Blaauwildebeestefontein, Laputa might change
his route of march, or Arcoll's men might fail to hold the Drift. 
Indeed, the other day at Portincross I was so overcome by the
recollection of the perils I had dared and God's goodness towards
me that I built a new hall for the parish kirk as a token of gratitude.</p>

<p>Fortunately for mankind the brain in a life of action turns more
to the matter in hand than to conjuring up the chances of the
future. Certainly it was in no discomfort of mind that I swung
along the moonlit path to the north.  Truth to tell, I was almost
happy.  The first honours in the game had fallen to me. I knew
more about Laputa than any man living save Henriques; I had my
finger on the central pulse of the rebellion. There was hid treasure
ahead of me&mdash;a great necklace of rubies, Henriques had said. 
Nay, there must be more, I argued.  This cave of the Rooirand
was the headquarters of the rising, and there must be stored their
funds&mdash;diamonds, and the gold they had been bartered for.  I believe
that every man has deep in his soul a passion for treasure-hunting,
which will often drive a coward into prodigies of valour.  I lusted
for that treasure of jewels and gold. Once I had been high-minded,
and thought of my duty to my country, but in that night ride I
fear that what I thought of was my duty to enrich David Crawfurd. 
One other purpose simmered in my head.  I was devoured with wrath
against Henriques.  Indeed, I think that was the strongest motive
for my escapade, for even before I heard Laputa tell of the vows
and the purification, I had it in my mind to go at all costs to
the cave.  I am a peaceable man at most times, but I think I would
rather have had the Portugoose's throat in my hands than the collar
of Prester John.</p>

<p>But behind my thoughts was one master-feeling, that Providence
had given me my chance and I must make the most of it. Perhaps
the Calvinism of my father's preaching had unconsciously taken
grip of my soul.  At any rate I was a fatalist in creed, believing
that what was willed would happen, and that man was but a puppet
in the hands of his Maker.  I looked on the last months as a clear
course which had been mapped out for me.  Not for nothing had
I been given a clue to the strange events which were coming. 
It was foreordained that I should go alone to Umvelos', and in
the promptings of my own fallible heart I believed I saw the workings
of Omnipotence.  Such is our moral arrogance, and yet without
such a belief I think that mankind would have ever been content
to bide sluggishly at home.</p>

<p>I passed the spot where on my former journey I had met the horses,
and knew that I had covered more than half the road. My ear had
been alert for the sound of pursuit, but the bush was quiet as
the grave.  The man who rode my pony would find him a slow traveller,
and I pitied the poor beast bucketed along by an angry rider. 
Gradually a hazy wall of purple began to shimmer before me, apparently
very far off.  I knew the ramparts of the Rooirand, and let my
<em>schimmel</em> feel my knees in his ribs.  Within an hour I
should be at the cliff's foot.</p>

<p>I had trusted for safety to the password, but as it turned out
I owed my life mainly to my horse.  For, a mile or so from the
cliffs, I came to the fringes of a great army.  The bush was teeming
with men, and I saw horses picketed in bunches, and a multitude
of Cape-carts and light wagons.  It was like a colossal gathering
for <em>naachtmaal</em>[1] at a Dutch dorp, but every man was
black.  I saw through a corner of my eye that they were armed
with guns, though many carried in addition their spears and shields. 
Their first impulse was to stop me.  I saw guns fly to shoulders,
and a rush towards the path.  The boldest game was the safest,
so I dug my heels into the <em>schimmel</em> and shouted for a
passage. 'Make way!' I cried in Kaffir.  'I bear a message from
the Inkulu.[2] Clear out, you dogs!'</p>

<p>They recognized the horse, and fell back with a salute.  Had
I but known it, the beast was famed from the Zambesi to the Cape. 
It was their king's own charger I rode, and who dared question
such a warrant? I heard the word pass through the bush, and all
down the road I got the salute.  In that moment I fervently thanked
my stars that I had got away first, for there would have been
no coming second for me.</p>

<p>At the cliff-foot I found a double line of warriors who had the
appearance of a royal guard, for all were tall men with leopard-skin
cloaks.  Their rifle-barrels glinted in the moon-light, and the
sight sent a cold shiver down my back.  Above them, among the
scrub and along the lower slopes of the kranzes, I could see further
lines with the same gleaming weapons.  The Place of the Snake
was in strong hands that night.</p>

<p>I dismounted and called for a man to take my horse.  Two of the
guards stepped forward in silence and took the bridle.  This left
the track to the cave open, and with as stiff a back as I could
command, but a sadly fluttering heart, I marched through the ranks.</p>

<p>The path was lined with guards, all silent and rigid as graven
images. As I stumbled over the stones I felt that my appearance
scarcely fitted the dignity of a royal messenger.  Among those
splendid men-at-arms I shambled along in old breeches and leggings,
hatless, with a dirty face, dishevelled hair, and a torn flannel
shirt.  My mind was no better than my body, for now that I had
arrived I found my courage gone.  Had it been possible I would
have turned tail and fled, but the boats were burned behind me,
and I had no choice.  I cursed my rash folly, and wondered at
my exhilaration of an hour ago.  I was going into the black mysterious
darkness, peopled by ten thousand cruel foes. My knees rubbed
against each other, and I thought that no man had ever been in
more deadly danger.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the gorge the guards ceased and I went on
alone. Here there was no moonlight, and I had to feel my way by
the sides.  I moved very slowly, wondering how soon I should find
the end my folly demanded.  The heat of the ride had gone, and
I remember feeling my shirt hang clammily on my shoulders.</p>

<p>Suddenly a hand was laid on my breast, and a voice demanded,
'The word?'</p>

<p>'Immanuel,' I said hoarsely.</p>

<p>Then unseen hands took both my arms, and I was led farther into
the darkness.  My hopes revived for a second.  The password had
proved true, and at any rate I should enter the cave.</p>

<p>In the darkness I could see nothing, but I judged that we stopped
before the stone slab which, as I remembered, filled the extreme
end of the gorge.  My guide did something with the right-hand
wall, and I felt myself being drawn into a kind of passage.  It
was so narrow that two could not go abreast, and so low that the
creepers above scraped my hair.  Something clicked behind me like
the turnstile at the gate of a show.</p>

<p>Then we began to ascend steps, still in utter darkness, and a
great booming fell on my ear.  It was the falling river which
had scared me on my former visit, and I marvelled that I had not
heard it sooner. Presently we came out into a gleam of moonlight,
and I saw that we were inside the gorge and far above the slab. 
We followed a narrow shelf on its left side (or 'true right',
as mountaineers would call it) until we could go no farther. 
Then we did a terrible thing.  Across the gorge, which here was
at its narrowest, stretched a slab of stone.  Far, far below I
caught the moonlight on a mass of hurrying waters. This was our
bridge, and though I have a good head for crags, I confess I grew
dizzy as we turned to cross it.  Perhaps it was broader than it
looked; at any rate my guides seemed to have no fear, and strode
across it as if it was a highway, while I followed in a sweat
of fright.  Once on the other side, I was handed over to a second
pair of guides, who led me down a high passage running into the
heart of the mountain.</p>

<p>The boom of the river sank and rose as the passage twined. Soon
I saw a gleam of light ahead which was not the moon.  It grew
larger, until suddenly the roof rose and I found myself in a gigantic
chamber.  So high it was that I could not make out anything of
the roof, though the place was brightly lit with torches stuck
round the wall, and a great fire which burned at the farther end. 
But the wonder was on the left side, where the floor ceased in
a chasm.  The left wall was one sheet of water, where the river
fell from the heights into the infinite depth, below.  The torches
and the fire made the sheer stream glow and sparkle like the battlements
of the Heavenly City.  I have never seen any sight so beautiful
or so strange, and for a second my breath stopped in admiration.</p>

<p>There were two hundred men or more in the chamber, but so huge
was the place that they seemed only a little company. They sat
on the ground in a circle, with their eyes fixed on the fire and
on a figure which stood before it.  The glow revealed the old
man I had seen on that morning a month before moving towards the
cave.  He stood as if in a trance, straight as a tree, with his
arms crossed on his breast.  A robe of some shining white stuff
fell from his shoulders, and was clasped round his middle by a
broad circle of gold.  His head was shaven, and on his forehead
was bound a disc of carved gold.  I saw from his gaze that his
old eyes were blind.</p>

<p>'Who comes?' he asked as I entered.</p>

<p>'A messenger from the Inkulu,' I spoke up boldly.  'He follows
soon with the white man, Henriques.'</p>

<p>Then I sat down in the back row of the circle to await events. 
I noticed that my neighbour was the fellow 'Mwanga whom I had
kicked out of the store.  Happily I was so dusty that he could
scarcely recognize me, but I kept my face turned away from him. 
What with the light and the warmth, the drone of the water, the
silence of the folk, and my mental and physical stress, I grew
drowsy and all but slept.</p>
