<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>We left our hero, a short time back, busily engaged on his dinner
commons, and resolved forthwith to make great friends with Hardy.
It never occurred to him that there could be the slightest difficulty
in carrying out this resolve. After such a passage as they two
had had together that afternoon, he felt that the usual outworks
of acquaintanceship had been cleared at a bound, and looked upon
Hardy already as an old friend to whom he could talk out his mind
as freely as he had been used to do to his old tutor at school,
or to Arthur. Moreover, as there were already several things in
his head which he was anxious to ventilate, he was all the more
pleased that chance had thrown him across a man of so much older
standing than himself, and one to whom he instinctively felt that
he could look up.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after grace had been said, and he saw that Hardy
had not finished his dinner, but sat down again when the fellows
had left the hall, he strolled out, meaning to wait for his victim
outside, and seize upon him then and there; so he stopped on the
steps outside the hall-door, and to pass the time, joined himself
to one or two other men with whom he had a speaking acquaintance,
who were also hanging about. While they were talking, Hardy came
out of the hall, and Tom turned and stepped forward, meaning to
speak to him. To his utter discomfiture, Hardy walked quickly
away, looking straight before him, and without showing, by look
or gesture, that he was conscious of our hero's existence, or
had ever seen him before in his life.</p>

<p>Tom was so taken aback that he made no effort to follow. He just
glanced at his companions to see whether they had noticed the
occurrence, and was glad to see that they had not (being deep
in the discussion of the merits of a new hunter of Simmons's,
which one of them had been riding); so he walked away by himself
to consider what it could mean. But the more he puzzled about
it, the less could he understand it. Surely, he thought, Hardy
must have seen me; and yet, if he had, why did he not recognize
me? My cap and gown can't be such a disguise as all that. And
yet common decency must have led him to ask whether I was any
the worse for my ducking, if he knew me.</p>

<p>He scouted the notion, which suggested itself once or twice,
that Hardy meant to cut him; and so, not being able to come to
any reasonable conclusion, suddenly bethought him that he was
asked to a wine-party; and putting his speculations aside for
a moment, with the full intention nevertheless of clearing up
the mystery as soon as possible, he betook himself to the rooms
of his entertainer.</p>

<p>They were fair-sized rooms in the second quadrangle, furnished
plainly but well, so far as Tom could judge, but, as they were
now laid out for the wine-party, they had lost all individual
character for the time. Everyone of us, I suppose, is fond of
studying the rooms, chambers, dens in short, of whatever sort
they may be, of our friends and acquaintances&mdash;at least, I knew
that I myself like to see what sort of a chair a man sits in,
where he puts it, what books lie or stand on the shelves nearest
his hand, what the objects are which he keeps most familiarly
before him, in that particular nook of the earth's surface in
which he is most at home, where he pulls off his coat, collar,
and boots, and gets into an old easy shooting-jacket, and his
broadest slippers. Fine houses and fine rooms have little attraction
for most men, and those who have the finest drawing-rooms are
probably the most bored by them; but the den of the man you like,
or are disposed to like, has the strongest and strangest attraction
for you. However, an Oxford undergraduate's room, set out for
a wine-party, can tell you nothing. All the characteristics are
shoved away into the background, and there is nothing to be seen
but a long mahogany set out with bottles, glasses, and dessert.
In the present instance the preparations for festivity were pretty
much what they ought to be: good sound port and sherry, biscuits,
and a plate or two of nuts and dried fruits. The host, who sat
at the head of the board, was one of the main-stays of the College
boat-club. He was treasurer of the club, and also a kind of a
boating nurse, who looked-up and trained the young oars, and in
this capacity had been in command of the freshmen's four-oar,
in which Tom had been learning his rudiments. He was a heavy,
burly man, naturally awkward in his movements, but gifted with
a steady sort of dogged enthusiasm, and by dint of hard and constant
training, had made himself into a most useful oar, fit for any
place in the middle of the boat. In the two years of his residence,
he had pulled down to Sandford every day except Sundays, and much
farther whenever he could get anybody to accompany him. He was
the most good natured man in the world, very badly dressed, very
short sighted, and called everybody "old fellow." His name was
simple Smith, generally known as Diogenes Smith, from an eccentric
habit which he had of making an easy chair of his hip bath. Malicious
acquaintance declared that when Smith first came up, and, having
paid the valuation for the furniture in his rooms, came to inspect
the same, the tub in question had been left by chance in the sitting-room,
and that Smith, not having the faintest idea of its proper use,
had by the exercise of his natural reason come to the conclusion
that it could only be meant for a man to sit in, and so had kept
it in his sitting-room, and had taken to it as an arm-chair. This
I have reason to believe was a libel. Certain it is, however,
that in his first term he was discovered sitting solemnly in the
tub, by his fire-side, with his spectacles on, playing the flute&mdash;the
only other recreation besides boating in which he indulged; and
no amount of quizzing could get him out of the habit. When alone,
or with only one or two friends in his room, he still occupied
the tub; and declared that it was the most perfect of seats hitherto
invented, and, above all, adapted for the recreation of a boating
man, to whom cushioned seats should be an abomination. He was
naturally a very hospitable man, and on this night was particularly
anxious to make his rooms pleasant to all comers, as it was a
sort of opening for the boating season. This wine of his was a
business matter, in fact, to which Diogenes had invited officially,
as treasurer of the boat-club, every man who had ever shown the
least tendency to pulling,&mdash;many with whom he had scarcely a nodding
acquaintance. For Miller, the coxswain, had come up at last. He
had taken his <em>B.A. </em>degree in the Michaelmas term, and
had been very near starting for a tour in the East. Upon turning
the matter over in his mind, however, Miller had come to the conclusion
that Palestine, and Egypt, and Greece could not run away, but
that, unless he was there to keep matters going, the St. Ambrose
boat would lose the best chance it was ever likely to have of
getting to the head of the river. So he had patriotically resolved
to reside till June, read divinity, and coach the racing crew;
and had written to Diogenes to call together the whole boating
interest of the College, that they might set to work at once in
good earnest. Tom, and the three or four other freshmen present,
were duly presented to Miller as they came in, who looked them
over as the colonel of a crack regiment might look over horses
at Horncastle-fair, with a single eye to their bone and muscle,
and how much work might be got out of them. They then gathered
towards the lower end of the long table, and surveyed the celebrities
at the upper end with much respect. Miller, the coxswain, sat
on the host's right hand,&mdash;a slight, resolute, fiery little man,
with curly black hair. He was peculiarly qualified by nature for
the task which he had set himself; and it takes no mean qualities
to keep a boat's crew well together and in order. Perhaps he erred
a little on the side of over-strictness and severity; and he certainly
would have been more popular had his manners been a thought more
courteous; but the men who rebelled most against his tyranny grumblingly
confessed that he was a first-rate coxswain.</p>

<p>A very different man was the captain of the boat, who sat opposite
to Miller; altogether, a noble specimen of a very noble type of
our countrymen. Tall and strong of body; courageous and even-tempered;
tolerant of all men; sparing of speech, but ready in action; a
thoroughly well balanced, modest, quiet Englishman; one of those
who do a good stroke of the work of the country without getting
much credit for it, or even becoming aware of the fact; for the
last thing such men understand is how to blow their own trumpets.
He was perhaps too easy for the captain of St. Ambrose boat-club;
at any rate, Miller was always telling him so. But, if he was
not strict enough with others, he never spared himself, and was
as good as three men in the boat at a pinch.</p>

<p>But if I venture on more introductions, my readers will get bewildered;
so I must close the list, much as I should like to make them known
to "fortis Gyas fortisque Cloanthus," who sat round the chiefs,
laughing and consulting, and speculating on the chances of the
coming races. No, stay, there is one other man they must make
room for. Here he comes, rather late, in a very glossy hat, the
only man in the room not in cap and gown. He walks up and takes
his place by the side of the host as a matter of course; a handsome,
pale man, with a dark, quick eye, conscious that he draws attention
wherever he goes, and apparently of the opinion that it is right.</p>

<p>"Who is that who has just come in in beaver?" said Tom, touching
the next man to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you know? that's Blake; he's the most wonderful fellow
in Oxford," answered his neighbor.</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"Why, he can do everything better than almost anybody, and without
any trouble at all. Miller was obliged to have him in the boat
last year, though he never trained a bit. Then he's in the eleven,
and is a wonderful rider, and tennis-player, and shot."</p>

<p>"Ay, and he's so awfully clever with it all," joined in the man
on the other side. "He'll be a safe first, though I don't believe
he reads more than you or I. He can write songs, too, as fast
as you can talk nearly, and sings them wonderfully."</p>

<p>"Is he of our College, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, or he couldn't have been in our boat last year."</p>

<p>"But I don't think I ever saw him in chapel or hall"</p>

<p>"No, I daresay not. He hardly ever goes to either, and yet he
manages never to get hauled up much, no one knows how. He never
gets up now till the afternoon, and sits up nearly all night playing
cards with the fastest fellows, or going round singing glees at
three or four in the morning."</p>

<p>Tom sipped his port and looked with great interest at the admirable
Crichton of St. Ambrose's; and, after watching him a few moments
said in a low voice to his neighbor,</p>

<p>"How wretched he looks! I never saw a sadder face."</p>

<p>Poor Blake! one can't help calling him "poor," although he himself
would have winced at it more than any name you could have called
him. You might have admired, feared, or wondered at him, and he
would have been pleased; the object of his life was to raise such
feelings in his neighbors; but pity was the last which he would
like to excite.</p>

<p>He was indeed a wonderfully gifted fellow, full of all sorts
of energy and talent, and power and tenderness; and yet, as his
face told only too truly to anyone who watched him when he was
exerting himself in society, one of the most wretched men in the
College. He had a passion for success&mdash;for beating everybody else
in whatever he took in hand, and that, too, without seeming to
make any great effort himself. The doing a thing well and thoroughly
gave him no satisfaction unless he could feel that he was doing
it better and more easily than A, B, or C, and they felt and acknowledged
this. He had had full swing of success for two years, and now
the Nemesis was coming.</p>

<p>For, although not an extravagant man, many of the pursuits in
which he has eclipsed all rivals were far beyond the means of
any but a rich one, and Blake was not rich. He had a fair allowance,
but by the end of his first year was considerably in debt, and,
at the time we are speaking of, the whole pack of Oxford tradesmen
into whose books he had got (having smelt out the leaness of his
expectations), were upon him, besieging him for payment. This
miserable and constant annoyance was wearing his soul out. This
was the reason why his oak was sported, and he was never seen
till the afternoons, and turned night into day. He was too proud
to come to an understanding with his persecutors, even had it
been possible; and now, at his sorest need, his whole scheme of
life was failing him; his love of success was turning into ashes
in his mouth; he felt much more disgust than pleasure at his triumphs
over other men, and yet the habit of striving for successes, notwithstanding
its irksomeness, was too strong to be resisted.</p>

<p>Poor Blake! he was living on from hand to mouth, flashing out
in his old brilliancy and power, and forcing himself to take the
lead in whatever company he might be; but utterly lonely and depressed
when by himself&mdash;reading feverishly in secret, in a desperate
effort to retrieve all by high honors and a fellowship. As Tom
said to his neighbor, there was no sadder face than his to be
seen in Oxford.</p>

<p>And yet at this very wine party he was the life of everything,
as he sat up there between Diogenes&mdash;whom he kept in a constant
sort of mild epileptic fit, from laughter, and wine going the
wrong way (for whenever Diogenes raised his glass Blake shot him
with some joke)&mdash;and the Captain who watched him with the most
undisguised admiration. A singular contrast, the two men! Miller,
though Blake was the torment of his life, relaxed after the first
quarter of all hour; and our hero, by the same time, gave himself
credit for being a much greater ass than he was, for having ever
thought Blake's face a sad one.</p>

<p>When the room was quite full, and enough wine had been drunk
to open the hearts of the guests, Diogenes rose on a signal from
Miller, and opened the budget. The financial statement was a satisfactory
one; the club was almost free of debt; and, comparing their position
with that of other colleges, Diogenes advised that they might
fairly burden themselves a little more, and then, if they would
stand a whip of ten shillings a man, they might have a new boat,
which he believed they all would agree had become necessary. Miller
supported the new boat in a pungent little speech; and the Captain,
when appealed to, nodded and said he thought they must have one.
So the small supplies and the large addition to the club debt
was voted unanimously, and the Captain, Miller, and Blake, who
had many notions as to the flooring, lines, and keel of a racing
boat, were appointed to order and superintend the building.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, coffee came in and cigars were lighted; a large
section of the party went off to play pool, others to stroll about
the streets, others to whist; a few, let us hope, to their own
rooms to read; but these latter were a sadly small minority even
in the quietest of St. Ambrose parties.</p>

<p>Tom, who was fascinated by the heroes at the head of the table,
sat steadily on, sidling up towards them as the intermediate places
became vacant, and at last attained the next chair but one to
the Captain, where for the time he sat in perfect bliss. Blake
and Miller were telling boating stories of the Henley and Thames
regattas, the latter of which had been lately started with great
<em>eclat</em>; and from these great yearly events, and the deeds
of prowess done thereat, the talk came gradually round to the
next races.</p>

<p>"Now, Captain," said Miller, suddenly, "have you thought yet
what new men we are to try in the crew this year?"</p>

<p>"No, 'pon my honor I haven't," said the Captain, "I'm reading,
and have no time to spare. Besides, after all, there's lots of
time to think about it. Here we're only half through Lent term,
and the races don't begin till the end of Easter term."</p>

<p>"It won't do," said Miller, "we must get the crew together this
term."</p>

<p>"Well, you and Smith put your heads together and manage it,"
said the Captain. "I will go down any day, and as often as you
like, at two o'clock."</p>

<p>"Let's see," said Miller to Smith, "how many of the old crew
have we left?"</p>

<p>"Five, counting Blake," answered Diogenes.</p>

<p>"Counting me! well, that's cool," laughed Blake; "you old tub
haunting flute-player, why am I not to be counted?"</p>

<p>"You never will train, you see," said Diogenes.</p>

<p>"Smith is quite right," said Miller; "there's no counting on
you, Blake. Now, be a good fellow, and promise to be regular this
year."</p>

<p>"I'll promise to do my work in a race, which is more than some
of your best-trained men will do," said Blake, rather piqued.</p>

<p>"Well you know what I think on the subject," said Miller; "but
who have we got for the other three places?"</p>

<p>"There's Drysdale would do," said Diogenes; "I hear he was a
capital oar at Eton; and so, though I don't know him, I managed
to get him once down last term. He would do famously for No.2,
or No.3 if he would pull."</p>

<p>"Do you think he will, Blake? You know him, I suppose," said
Miller.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know him well enough," said Blake; and, shrugging his
shoulders, added, "I don't think you'll get him to train much."</p>

<p>"Well, we must try," said Miller. "Now, who else is there?"</p>

<p>Smith went through four or five names, at each of which Miller
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Any promising freshmen?" said he at last.</p>

<p>"None better than Brown here," said Smith. "I think he'll do
well if he will only work, and stand being coached."</p>

<p>"Have you ever pulled much?" said Miller.</p>

<p>"No," said Tom, "never till this last month&mdash;since I've been
up here."</p>

<p>"All the better," said Miller; "now, Captain, you hear; we may
probably have to go in with three new hands; they must get into
your stroke this term, or we shall be nowhere."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Captain; "I'll give from two till five
any days you like."</p>

<p>"And now let's go and have one pool," said Blake, getting up.
"Come, Captain, just one little pool after all this business."</p>

<p>Diogenes insisted on staying to play his flute; Miller was engaged;
but the Captain, with a little coaxing, was led away by Blake,
and good-naturedly asked Tom to accompany them, when he saw that
he was looking as if he would like it. So the three went off to
the billiard-rooms; Tom in such spirits at the chance of being
tried in the crew, that he hardly noticed the exceedingly bad
exchange which he had involuntarily made of his new cap and gown
for a third-year cap with the board broken into several pieces,
and a fusty old gown which had been about college probably for
ten generations. Under-graduate morality in the matter of caps
and gowns seems to be founded on the celebrated maxim, "<em>Propriete
c'est le vol</em>."</p>

<p>They found the St. Ambrose pool-room full of the fast set; and
Tom enjoyed his game much, though his three lives were soon disposed
of. The Captain and Blake were the last lives on the board, and
divided the pool at Blake's suggestion. He had scarcely nerve
for playing out a single handed match with such an iron-nerved,
steady piece of humanity as the Captain, though he was the more
brilliant player of the two. The party then broke up, and Tom
returned to his rooms; and, when he was by himself again, his
thoughts recurred to Hardy. How odd, he thought, that they never
mentioned him for the boat! Could he have done anything to be
ashamed of? How was it that nobody seemed to know him, and he
to know nobody.</p>

<p>Most readers, I doubt not, will think our hero very green for
being puzzled at so simple a matter; and, no doubt, the steps
in the social scale in England are very clearly marked out, and
we all come to the appreciation of the gradations sooner or later.
But our hero's previous education must be taken into consideration.
He had not been instructed at home to worship mere conventional
distinctions of rank or wealth, and had gone to a school which
was not frequented by persons of rank, and where no one knew whether
a boy was heir to a principality, or would have to fight his own
way in the world. So he was rather taken by surprise at what he
found to be the state of things at St. Ambrose's and didn't easily
realize it.</p>
