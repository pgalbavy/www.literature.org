Perhaps I should admit on the title page that this book is "By L.
Frank Baum and his correspondents," for I have used many suggestions
conveyed to me in letters from children.  Once on a time I really
imagined myself "an author of fairy tales," but now I am merely an
editor or private secretary for a host of youngsters whose ideas I am
requestsed to weave into the thread of my stories.
<P>
These ideas are often clever.  They are also logical and interesting.
So I have used them whenever I could find an opportunity, and it is
but just that I acknowledge my indebtedness to my little friends.
<P>
My, what imaginations these children have developed!  Sometimes I am
fairly astounded by their daring and genius.  There will be no lack of
fairy-tale authors in the future, I am sure.  My readers have told me
what to do with Dorothy, and Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, and I have
obeyed their mandates.  They have also given me a variety of subjects
to write about in the future: enough, in fact, to keep me busy for
some time.  I am very proud of this alliance.  Children love these
stories because children have helped to create them.  My readers know
what they want and realize that I try to please them.  The result is
very satisfactory to the publishers, to me, and (I am quite sure) to
the children.
<P>
I hope, my dears, it will be a long time before we are obliged to
dissolve partnership.
