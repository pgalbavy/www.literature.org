<p>HE <em>MADE </em>this promise with an angrily confident determination
to fulfil it, but the next few days were to teach him that he
had not yet learned all there was to know about his sister. When
he forced his way to an interview with her in her rooms in the
hotel to which she had gone in New York, she laughed at his fury.</p>

<p>"<em>Why</em> haven’t I been a good wife to him?" she asked.
"I’ve spent quite a number of years in purgatory, trying to stick
to what I undertook when he married me! Oh, yes, I know you like
the place, George; and I don’t challenge your viewpoint. But I
have my own, and, whether it’s right or not, it’s mine and I can’t
get rid of it. I suffer by it, and I have to live by it—and to
me the place has always been a purgatory. It’s interesting to
you, but it’s hideous to me. You like the people;—to you they
seem intelligent and friendly. To me they’re intrusive barbarians
with unbearable voices. I stood it at first because I had to;
I didn’t have anywhere else to go, and I did care for Dan. Then
I kept on standing it because I’d got the habit, I suppose, and
because it’s hard to get the courage to break away. Well, thank
Heaven, something’s given me the courage at last. I was always
just on the very verge of it, and the trouble about Henry pushed
me over. I’ve perished for years because I couldn’t get a breath
of art; I haven’t lived——"</p>

<p>"You could have!" he cried. "With such a man——"</p>

<p>"Dan? Good heavens! I might go on living with a man, even after
I’d stopped caring for him, if he still cared for me; but it’s
years since I realized absolutely that neither of us cared for
the other. I knew then I’d have to do this some day."</p>

<p>"And how beautifully you did do it!" her brother exclaimed. "His
mother told me about your screaming and storming at Dan after
he brought that miserable boy home. Do you think I didn’t understand?
You <em>wanted</em> a quarrel to justify your going, so that the
real reason wouldn’t be suspected. You’d seen that singing <em>beef</em>
again, and you meant to see him <em>again</em>—oh, I kept near
you that night, and I read you, every instant! You haven’t fooled
me about what gave you the ‘courage,’ Lena! It was indeed ‘the
breath of art,’ old girl, and not ‘the trouble about Henry!’ You
made that quarrel with Dan deliberately. It was to cover what
you weren’t thoroughbred enough to face. You weren’t honest enough
to——"</p>

<p>"At least I’m honest enough to tell you that you’re wasting your
breath," Lena said coolly. "You want to take Henry home with you,
but he doesn’t care to go. He behaved idiotically there—it <em>isn’t</em>
a good place for him—and of course, under the circumstances, he’s
embarrassed about going back. He wants to stay with me just now,
and he’ll do what I tell him. You can’t take him back with you,
but if you’ll obtain a proper allowance for me, or a settlement,
from my husband, I’ll arrange later for Henry to spend a part
of his time with his father. That’s absolutely the best I’ll do,
and you’d better run back and make it quite clear to Dan. I bear
him no ill will, and I’ll be perfectly fair with him on the terms
I’ve just mentioned."</p>

<p>Her brother’s bitterness with her was not abated; but to effect
his purpose he tried more reasonable persuasions, and when these
were unavailing, raged again. All he did was useless; he could
neither shake her nor exert the slightest influence upon Henry,
though he continued the siege for three days over the four that
he had promised. Then he returned, a defeated but fuming negotiator,
to report his failure. His final instructions from his sister
were to make it quite clear to Dan that she bore him no ill will
and wished him well.</p>

<p>But when George reached the old house of the Oliphants, driving
there directly from the train, he was told that he could not make
her message clear to her husband; that he could not make anything
clear to him.</p>

<p>Harlan took the dismayed traveller into the library. "The doctor
says the trouble is there isn’t anything to build up a resistance,"
Harlan said. "You see Dan’s never taken any care of his health—‘too
busy,’ of course—and he’s exhausted his vitality. He caught a
fearful cold going round in the rain hunting for that precious
boy of his, and instead of staying in bed and nursing himself,
he was hustling all over the place in a drizzle the next morning.
He was all run-down to start with, and his system couldn’t afford
it. At least, that’s what they told us after the consultation
yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Consultation?" McMillan repeated blankly, though Harlan’s manner
had already prepared him for words worse than this.</p>

<p>Harlan sighed audibly, and shook his head. "Both lungs are congested,
they told us early this morning. He can’t——" He went to the bay
window and looked down at the slightly frayed upholstery of the
easy-chair it had once been his wont to occupy there. "Well, at
your age and mine we’ve had experience of sickness enough to know
that nobody can stand <em>that</em> long."</p>

<p>"Yes," McMillan groaned. "I suppose so."</p>

<p>"I think we won’t tell him you’ve got back," Harlan said. "He’s
asked about it every now and then—wants to know if you’ve brought
Henry yet. It’ll be better to let him keep on expecting him than
to tell him you’ve come back alone. I telegraphed you after the
consultation, but by that time you’d already left New York, of
course."</p>

<p>"Yes; it didn’t reach me."</p>

<p>Then, for a time, neither of them found more to say. Harlan,
near the window, stared out into the smoke haze that a cloudy
day held down upon the city; McMillan sat frowning at the floor,
and the room was vaguely noisy with a confusion of sounds from
outdoors: hammerings and clatterings of steel where buildings
were going up; the rending of timbers and crashes and shoutings
where they were going down; the uproar of ponderous trucks grinding
by upon the brick-paved cross street to the south, so that the
strong old house trembled with the subterranean communication
of their vibrations—all to the incessantly rasped accompaniment
of motor signals on the avenue.</p>

<p>"Isn’t this a hell to be sick in?" Harlan asked, turning abruptly
to McMillan. "We couldn’t raise the windows to give him air without
giving him this infernal smoke that makes him cough harder. And
the noise—there’s hardly a respite from it all night long! When
the workmen go home the joy-riders and the taxis keep it up till
daylight. He was too sick to be taken to a hospital or——" He interrupted
himself with a desperate laugh. "We almost had to! Yesterday morning
the servants called me, and I found the house full of men; they’d
brought trucks right across the lawn, and started to work. They’d
come to wreck the house—to tear it down. I told the foreman my
brother was very sick, and he said in that case we’d better take
him to a hospital; he had his orders from the contractor, and
he was going ahead! Some of his men were already on the roof,
making a horrible noise and tearing away the slate—throwing it
down into the yard under Dan’s window. I had hard work to get
rid of them; and they left a great hole in the roof when they
went. My heaven! when such things happen how’s anybody ever to
see any <em>meaning</em> in life?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know!" George groaned. "I don’t see much meaning in
anything—not after what you’ve told me about Dan’s condition."</p>

<p>"McMillan, I don’t see a bit of meaning to the whole miserable
business. Here’s my brother spent all his days and nights—and
all his strength and health—just blindly building up a bigger
confusion and uproar that smashes him; and then when he <em>is</em>
smashed, it keeps on bothering him and disturbing him—yes, and
choking him!—on his very deathbed! I know your theory that it
all means power, and that power may be thought beautiful—but it
can’t last, because nothing can last. So what the deuce is the
good of it?"</p>

<p>And when the other, groaning again, said that he didn’t know,
Harlan groaned, too—then crossed the room to where George sat
in a crumpled attitude, touched him lightly on the shoulder, and
turned away. "You’re a good fellow, McMillan, and you haven’t
anything in the world to reproach yourself with. I don’t think
he’s minded Lena’s going away; he hasn’t spoken of her at all,
and I really believe he doesn’t think of her. Your record with
Dan is all right, but I’ve been realizing that mine isn’t. I could
have made success easier for him long ago; though I don’t reproach
myself so much with that, because he <em>did</em> get his success—for
a while, and that’s all anybody gets—and he enjoyed it all the
more for having got it without help. What I’m thinking about this
morning: I seem to have spent a great part of my life saying,
‘What’s the good of it?’ as I did just now, and it’s my brother’s
work I’ve been saying it about. I’ve always been ‘superior’—and
I’ll never be different. I was born so, I believe, and didn’t
see it in time. The most I’ve ever actually <em>done</em> was
to help organize a dilettante musical club! And Dan—well, I hope
it’s as you intimated the other night on Martha’s porch—I hope
Dan’s been too busy to be much bothered about my ‘judgments!’
I’ve been just nothing; but even if he falls, he’s at least been
a branch of the growing tree, though we don’t know where it’s
growing to, or why."</p>

<p>"No," McMillan said. "We don’t know anything."</p>

<p>Harlan had begun to pace up and down the room. "I didn’t understand
that Dan was in real trouble financially," he said. "He’d been
on the edge so often—I talked about it, but I’d got to thinking
of it as a permanent thing for him to be on the edge. I didn’t
realize he might actually fall <em>off</em>—not until that little
Jew friend of his came to me the other morning and <em>made</em>
me realize it. Well, there’s one thing I can be thankful for:
I can be grateful that all I thought of, for once in my life,
was that I was Dan’s brother!"</p>

<p>"Harlan?" Martha Shelby’s voice called him softly from the stairway.</p>

<p>"Yes?" He turned to the door, explaining, "Dan may want me—he
sends for me to come in sometimes. Perhaps you might——" He paused.</p>

<p>"Yes," George said, rising. "I’ll go and wire her. She might
want to come. At any rate she’ll send Henry. Then I’ll come back
here. I’ll be downstairs in this room, if there’s anything——"</p>

<p>"I’ll let you know," Harlan said, and he went upstairs to Martha.</p>

<p>"Your mother’s been with him," she whispered. "She and the nurse
said he seemed to be trying to ask for somebody, but he was so
weak, and his cough troubled him so much——"</p>

<p>"I’ll go in and see," he said; but he came back to her a few
moments later, and told her it was for her that Dan was asking.</p>

<p>She went into his room, sat by his bed, and put her hand gently
over his on the coverlet. "Why, you’re better, Dan," she said,
as he turned his head and looked at her with eyes that cleared
and grew brighter, for he recognized her.</p>

<p>"Think so?" He spoke distinctly though his voice was weak. "Well,
maybe—maybe. I did hope——"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dan?"</p>

<p>"I did hope I wouldn’t have to be sick very long. I’ve got so
much to do. I’ve done a good deal of work, but I haven’t ever
<em>got</em> anywhere with it, much. There’s a mighty big lot
I’ll have to begin over, Martha. You don’t"—he paused, and laughed
faintly. "You don’t—you don’t suppose God’s used me and now He’s
goin’ to throw me away, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" she said, making her voice cheerful. "You’ve only
got to go ahead with what you began long ago."</p>

<p>"No," he said reflectively. "No; it isn’t exactly like that,
Martha. Not exactly, that is. You see right now I’m a pretty complete
failure—yes, I am. I’m a pretty bad failure."</p>

<p>"You? You’re not!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," he returned feebly. "I better face it, Martha, or
I’ll never get anywhere. They’ve got Ornaby away from me——" His
cough interrupted him; but he patiently let it have its way; and
then, in a tone in which a wondering incredulity seemed to merge
with resignation, he said, "Yes, sir; they did get Ornaby away
from me!"</p>

<p>"But you’ll get it back, Dan?"</p>

<p>"Think so? Well, maybe—maybe," he said indulgently. "But things
do look like it came pretty close to a failure, Martha. It <em>would</em>
have been one, too—it’d have been a bankruptcy, and I believe
I just couldn’t have stood that—but, well, anyhow it wasn’t that
bad, thanks to Harlan."</p>

<p>Martha’s eyes widened. "Do you mean—do you mean Harlan helped
you?"</p>

<p>"It was mighty good of him," Dan said. "My friends went to him
and asked him if he wouldn’t let us have some money on a second
mortgage on the new house. Harlan dug out all the securities he
could sell for ready cash and he brought the money to me down
at Sam Kohn’s office. I must make it up to him some day. If it
hadn’t been for that I’d have gone clean under!" He laughed huskily.
"Everybody’d have known I was a failure for sure, if it hadn’t
been for that, Martha."</p>

<p>"But you’re not!" she insisted. "You mustn’t keep talking such
nonsense, Dan."</p>

<p>"It isn’t—it isn’t exactly nonsense." The cough stopped him again;
but he went on, while it still troubled him: "I’m a failure, Martha.
I’ve been a failure in business—and a failure as a husband—and
a failure as a father. George McMillan hasn’t got here with Henry
yet, has he?"</p>

<p>"No, dear; not yet."</p>

<p>Dan’s hand moved restlessly under hers, and she released it.
With a visible effort he rubbed his forehead, a gesture of perplexity
that hurt her and made it difficult for her to retain her appearance
of cheerfulness, because this characteristic gesture brought his
boyhood so vividly to her memory. "I’ve just <em>got</em> to have
Henry back," he said. "I’ve got to get him back so’s to do right
by him. It isn’t—it isn’t fair to a boy, Martha."</p>

<p>"What isn’t?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember my grandmother Savage?"</p>

<p>"Of course. No one could forget her, Dan."</p>

<p>"No, I guess not. Well, she"—he shook his head, and half coughed,
half laughed—"she was right about some things. My! but wouldn’t
she be sayin’, ‘Didn’t I tell you so?’ if she knew what’s happened
to my poor Henry! I’ve been a terrible failure with Henry, Martha."
He looked patiently at her as she denied this; and then he said
abruptly: "Why, I’ve even been a failure with <em>you</em>, Martha!"</p>

<p>"That’s the absurdest thing you’ve said, dear!"</p>

<p>"No. I’ve been a failure as a friend, too. I let Lena fret me
out of comin’ in to see you when you’d been away that long stretch.
I had no business to pay any attention to her. You see—why, <em>you</em>
always really liked me better than she did, Martha!"</p>

<p>He spoke as if it were a discovery just made; and she assented
to it, taking his hand again. "Yes, Dan. I’ve always liked you
better than anybody."</p>

<p>"Have you?" he said inquiringly. "Well, I’m right glad to hear
it. I’m right glad to hear it, Martha."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. I always have."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, but she felt a faint pressure upon her hand
from his, and sat still for a time, looking at him with fond eyes
that grew frightened as the pressure upon her fingers relaxed.
She was not sure, for the moment, that he was still breathing;
and she looked a terrified inquiry at the grave nurse who sat
on the other side of the bed. The nurse shook her head, forming
with her lips the word, "Sleeping"; but Dan opened his eyes again.</p>

<p>"It’s curious," he said, "the way things are. A fellow goes along,
and everything seems to run all right, year after year—he can
hear a little kind of grindin’ noise, maybe, sometimes, or something
seems to slip, but he patches it up and doesn’t let it scare him—he
keeps goin’ right along and everything seems to be workin’ about
as usual—and then one thing goes wrong—and then another—and then
all of a sudden the whole works pile up on top of him, and he’s
down under the heap!" He took his hand again from Martha’s, and
again passed it tremulously over his forehead in the old familiar
gesture. "Well—maybe I could start in again if I can get over
what ails me. I expect I need a good night’s rest first, though.
Maybe I can sleep now."</p>

<p>Martha went tiptoeing out, and through the hall to the room that
had been Lena’s. Harlan was there, sitting close beside his mother.
"He wants to sleep," Martha told them, but had no sooner spoken
than Dan’s renewed coughing was heard—a sound that racked the
sick man’s mother. She shivered and gasped, and then, as the convulsion
became fainter, went out trembling into the hall.</p>

<p>"Harlan," Martha said, "why didn’t you tell me you tried to help
Dan—at last?"</p>

<p>He rose, looking annoyed. "I didn’t do anything that was in the
slightest degree a sacrifice," he said. "I don’t want you to misunderstand
it. I never helped him when I thought it would be thrown away,
and I didn’t this time. He made over the new house to me, and
I guess Lena’ll sign the deed; she’ll have to. In time it’ll probably
be worth all I gave for it. I wasn’t going to see the name of
Oliphant dragged through all the miserable notoriety of bankruptcy—and
there was something besides."</p>

<p>"Yes?" she said. "What was that?"</p>

<p>"Well, a pack of old money-vultures were after him, and after
all Dan’s my brother."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is!" Martha said. She began to cry bitterly, but silently;
then suddenly she put her arms about him. "He’s still your brother,
Harlan! We can say that yet;—he’s just in that room down the hall
there—he’s not gone away—he’s <em>still</em> your brother, Harlan!"</p>

<p>But even as Martha spoke, Mrs. Oliphant, looking through the
door of the sick room, cried out in terror, then rushed to her
son’s bedside. Dan had unexpectedly lifted himself almost half
upright; he seemed to struggle to rise; and in his eyes, wide-opened,
but seeing neither his mother nor the nurse, there was a look
of startled incredulity—the look of one who suddenly recognizes,
to his utter astonishment, an old acquaintance long since disappeared
but now abruptly returned.</p>

<p>A moment later the uncontrolled sobbing of his mother let Harlan
know that he no longer had a brother in the room down the hall. </p>
