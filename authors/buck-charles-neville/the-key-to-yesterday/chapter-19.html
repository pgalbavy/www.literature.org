<p>Late that afternoon, in Mrs. Horton's drawing-room at the <u>HÃ´tel
Palais d'Orsay</u>, Steele stood at the window, his gaze almost sullen in
the moodiness of his own ineffectual sympathy. The day had grown as
cheerless as himself. Outside, across the <u>Quai d'Orsay</u>, a cold rain
pelted desolately into the gray water of the Seine, and drew a wet
veil across the opposite bank. Through the reeking mist, the remote
gray branches in the Gardens of the <u>Tuileries</u> stood out starkly
naked. Even the vague masses of the <u>Louvre</u> seemed as forbidding as
the shadowy bulk of some buttressed prison. The "taxis" slurred by
through wet streets, and those persons who were abroad went with
streaming umbrellas and hurried steps. The raw chill of Continental
hotels permeated the place. He knew that in the center of the room
Duska sat, her elbows resting on the table top; her eyes,
distressfully wide, fixed on the wet panes of the other window. He
knew that, if he spoke to her, her lips would shape themselves into a
pathetic smile, and her answer would be steady. He knew that she had
given herself no luxury of outburst, but that she had remained there,
in much the same attitude, all afternoon; sometimes, crushing her
small handkerchief into a tight wad of lace and linen; sometimes,
opening it out and smoothing it with infinite care into a tiny square
upon the table. He knew that her feet, with their small shoes and
high-arched, silk-stockinged insteps, twitched nervously from time to
time; that the gallant shoulders drooped forward. These details were
pictured in his mind, and he kept his eyes stolidly pointed toward the
outer gloom so that he might not be forced to see it all again in
actuality.
</p>
<p>At last, he wheeled with a sudden gesture of desperation, and, going
across to the table, dropped his hand over hers.
</p><p>She looked up with the unchanged expression of wide-eyed suffering
that has no outlet.
</p><p>"Duska, dear," he asked, "can I do anything?"
</p><p>She shook her head, and, as she answered, it was in a dead voice.
"There is nothing to do."
</p><p>"If I leave you, will you promise to cry? You must cry," he commanded.
</p><p>"I can't cry," she answered, in the same expressionless flatness of
tone.
</p><p>"Duska, can you forgive me?" He had moved around, and stood leaning
forward with his hands resting upon the table.
</p><p>"Forgive you for what?"
</p><p>"For being the author of all this hideous calamity," he burst out with
self-accusation, "for bringing him there--for introducing you."
</p><p>She reached out suddenly, and seized his hand.
</p><p>"Don't!" she pleaded. "Do you suppose that I would give up a memory
that I have? Why, all my world is memory now! Do you suppose I blame
you--or him?"
</p><p>"You might very well blame us both. We both knew of the possibilities,
and let things go on."
</p><p>She rose, and let her eyes rest on him with directness. Her voice was
not angry, but very earnest.
</p><p>"That is not true," she said. "It couldn't be helped. It was written.
He told me everything. He asked me to forget, and I held him--because
we loved each other. He could no more help it than he could help being
himself, fulfilling his genius when he thought he was following
another man. There are just some things--" she halted a moment, and
shook her head--"some things," she went on quietly, "that are bigger
than we are."
</p><p>"But, now----" He stopped.
</p><p>"But, now--" the quiet of her words hurt the man more than tears could
have done--"now, his real life has claimed him--the life that only
loaned him to me."
</p><p>The telephone jangled suddenly, and Steele, whose nerves were all on
edge, started violently at the sound. Mechanically, he took up the
instrument from its table-rack, and listened.
</p><p>"Yes, this is Mr. Steele. What? Mr. St. John? Tell him I'll see him
down there--to wait for me." Steele was about to replace the receiver,
when Duska's hand caught his wrist.
</p><p>"No," she said quickly, "have him come here."
</p><p>"Wait. Hold the wire." The man turned to the girl.
</p><p>"Duska, you are only putting yourself on the rack," he pleaded. "Let
me see him alone." She shook her head with the old determination.
"Have him come here," she repeated.
</p><p>"Send Mr. St. John up," ordered the Kentuckian.
</p><p>One might have seen from his eyes that, when Mr. St. John arrived, his
reception would be ungracious. The man felt all the stored-up savagery
born of his helpless remonstrance. It must have some vent. Every one
and everything that had contributed to her misery were alike hateful
to him. Had he been able to talk to Saxon just then, his unreasoning
wrath would have poured itself forth as readily and bitterly as on St.
John. The sight of the agent standing in the door a few moments later,
inoffensive, even humble, failed to mollify him.
</p><p>"I shall have the two pictures delivered within the next day,"
ventured the Englishman.
</p><p>Steele turned brutally on the visitor.
</p><p>"Do you mean to risk remaining in Paris now?" he demanded.
</p><p>At the tone, St. John stiffened. He was humble because these people
had been kind. Now, meeting hostility, he threw off his lowly
demeanor.
</p><p>"Why, may I ask, should I leave Paris?" There was a touch of
delicately shaded defiance in the questioning voice.
</p><p>"Because, now, you must reckon with Mr. Saxon for pirating his work!
Because he may choose to make you walk the plank."
</p><p>Steele whipped out his answer in rapid, angry sentences.
</p><p>St. John met the eyes of the Kentuckian insolently.
</p><p>"Pardon the suggestion that you misstate the case," he said, softly.
"I have never sold a picture as a Marston that was not a Marston--it
would appear that unconsciously I was, after all, honest. As for Mr.
Saxon, there is, it seems, no Mr. Saxon. That gentleman was entirely
mythical. It was an alias, if you please."
</p><p>It was Steele who winced now, but his retort was contemptuously cool:
</p><p>"Do you fancy Mr. Marston will accept that explanation?"
</p><p>"Mr. Steele--" the derelict drew back his thin shoulders, and faced
the other with a glint in the pale pupils that was an echo of the days
when he had been able to look men in the face. "Before I became a
scoundrel, sir, I was a gentleman. My daughter is extremely ill. I
must remain with her, and take the chance as to what Mr. Marston may
choose to do. I shall hope that he will make some allowance for a
father's desperate--if unscrupulous--effort to care for his daughter.
I hope so particularly inasmuch as that daughter is also his wife."
</p><p>Steele started forward, his eyes going involuntarily to the girl, but
she sat unflinching, except that a sudden, spasm of pain crossed the
hopelessness of her eyes. Somewhere among Duska Filson's ancestors,
there had been a stoic. Instantly, Steele realized that it was he
himself who had brought about the needless cruelty of that reminder.
St. John had disarmed him, and put him in the wrong.
</p><p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said.
</p><p>"I came here," said St. John slowly, "not only to notify you about
your canvases. There was something else. You were both very
considerate when I was here before. It is strange that a man who will
do dishonest things still clings to the wish that his occasional
honest motives shall not be misconstrued. I don't want you to think
that I intentionally lied to you then. I told you Frederick Marston
was dead. I believed it. Before I began this--this piracy, I
investigated, and satisfied myself on the point. Time corroborated me.
It is as though he had arisen from the grave. That is all."
</p><p>The man paused; then, looking at the girl, he continued:
</p><p>"And Mr. Saxon--" he hesitated a moment upon the name, but went
resolutely on--"Mr. Saxon will recover. When he wakes next, the
doctors believe, he will awake to everything. After his violent
exertion and the shock of his partial realization, he became
delirious. For several days perhaps, he must have absolute quiet, but
he will take up a life in which there are no empty spaces."
</p><p>The girl rose, and, as she spoke, there was a momentary break in her
voice that led Steele to hope for the relief of tears, but her tone
steadied itself, and her eyes remained dry.
</p><p>"Mr. St. John," she said slowly, "may I go and see--your daughter?"
</p><p>For a moment, the Englishman looked at her quietly, then tears flooded
his eyes. He thought of the message of the portrait, and, with no
information except that of his own observing eyes, he read a part at
least of the situation.
</p><p>"Miss Filson," he said with as simple a dignity as though his name had
never been tarnished, as though the gentleman had never decayed into
the derelict, "my daughter would be happy to receive you, but she is
in no condition to hear startling news. By her own wish, we have not
in seven years spoken of Mr. Marston. She does not know that I
believed him dead, she does not know that he has reappeared. To tell
her would endanger her life."
</p><p>"I shall not go as a bearer of news," the girl assured him; "I shall
go only as a friend of her father's, and--because I want to."
</p><p>St. John hesitatingly put out his hand. When the girl gave him hers,
he bent over it with a catch in his voice, but a remnant of the grand
manner, and kissed her fingers in the fashion of the old days.
</p><p>Driving with Steele the next morning to St. John's lodgings, the girl
looked straight ahead steadfastly. The rain of the night had been
forgotten, and the life of Paris glittered with sun and brilliant
abandon. Pleasure-worship and vivacious delight seemed to lie like a
spirit of the departed summer on the boulevards. Along the <u>Champs
ElysÃ©es</u>, from the <u>Place de la Concorde</u> to the <u>Arc de Triomphe</u>,
flowed a swift, continuous parade of motors, bearing in state gaily
dressed women, until the nostrils were filled with a strangely blended
odor of gasoline and flowers. The pavement cafÃ©s and sidewalks flashed
color, and echoed laughter. Nowhere, from the spot where the
guillotine had stood to the circle where Napoleon decreed his arch,
did there seem a niche for sorrow.
</p><p>"Will you wait here to see to what he awakens?" questioned Steele.
</p><p>Duska shook her head.
</p><p>"I have no right to wait. And yet--yet, I can't go home!" She leaned
toward him, impulsively. "I couldn't bear going back to Kentucky now,"
she added, plaintively; "I couldn't bear it."
</p><p>"You will go to Nice for a while," said Steele, firmly. He had fallen
into the position, of arranging their affairs. Mrs. Horton, distressed
in Duska's distress, found herself helpless to act except upon his
direction.
</p><p>The girl nodded, apathetically.
</p><p>"It doesn't matter," she said.
</p><p>Then, she looked up again.
</p><p>"But I want you to stay. I want you to do everything you can for both
of them." She paused, and her next words were spoken with an effort:
"And I don't want--I don't want you to speak of me. I don't want you
to try to remind him."
</p><p>"He will question me," demurred Steele.
</p><p>Duska's head was raised with a little gesture of pride.
</p><p>"I am not afraid," she said, "that he will ask you anything he should
not--anything that he has not the right to ask."
