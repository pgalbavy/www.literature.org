<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

A Torquasian sword smote a glancing blow across the
forehead of Carthoris.  He had a fleeting vision of soft
arms about his neck, and warm lips close to his before
he lost consciousness.
<P>
How long he lay there senseless he could not guess;
but when he opened his eyes again he was alone, except
for the bodies of the dead green men and Dusarians,
and the carcass of a great banth that lay half across his own.
<P>
Thuvia was gone, nor was the body of Kar Komak among the dead.
<P>
Weak from loss of blood, Carthoris made his way
slowly toward Aaanthor, reaching its outskirts at dark.
<P>
He wanted water more than any other thing, and so
he kept on up a broad avenue toward the great central
plaza, where he knew the precious fluid was to be found
in a half-ruined building opposite the great palace of the
ancient jeddak, who once had ruled this mighty city.
<P>
Disheartened and discouraged by the strange sequence
of events that seemed fore-ordained to thwart his every
attempt to serve the Princess of Ptarth, he paid little
or no attention to his surroundings, moving through the
deserted city as though no great white apes lurked in the
black shadows of the mystery-haunted piles that flanked
the broad avenues and the great plaza.
<P>
But if Carthoris was careless of his surroundings, not
so other eyes that watched his entrance into the plaza,
and followed his slow footsteps toward the marble pile
that housed the tiny, half-choked spring whose water one
might gain only by scratching a deep hole in the red
sand that covered it.
<P>
And as the Heliumite entered the small building a dozen mighty,
grotesque figures emerged from the doorway of the palace to
speed noiselessly across the plaza toward him.
<P>
For half an hour Carthoris remained in the building,
digging for water and gaining the few much-needed drops
which were the fruits of his labour.  Then he rose and
slowly left the structure.  Scarce had he stepped beyond the
threshold than twelve Torquasian warriors leaped upon him.
<P>
No time then to draw long-sword; but swift from his
harness flew his long, slim dagger, and as he went down
beneath them more than a single green heart ceased
beating at the bite of that keen point.
<P>
Then they overpowered him and took his weapons away;
but only nine of the twelve warriors who had crossed
the plaza returned with their prize.
<P>
They dragged their prisoner roughly to the palace pits,
where in utter darkness they chained him with rusty links
to the solid masonry of the wall.
<P>
"To-morrow Thar Ban will speak with you," they said.
"Now he sleeps.  But great will be his pleasure when he
learns who has wandered amongst us--and great will
be the pleasure of Hortan Gur when Thar Ban drags
before him the mad fool who dared prick the great
jeddak with his sword."
<P>
Then they left him to the silence and the darkness.
<P>
For what seemed hours Carthoris squatted upon the
stone floor of his prison, his back against the wall in
which was sunk the heavy eye-bolt that secured the
chain which held him.
<P>
Then, from out of the mysterious blackness before him,
there came to his ears the sound of naked feet moving
stealthily upon stone--approaching nearer and nearer to
where he lay, unarmed and defenceless.
<P>
Minutes passed--minutes that seemed hours--during which
time periods of sepulchral silence would be followed
by a repetition of the uncanny scraping of naked
feet slinking warily upon him.
<P>
At last he heard a sudden rush of unshod soles
across the empty blackness, and at a little distance a
scuffling sound, heavy breathing, and once what he
thought the muttered imprecation of a man battling
against great odds.  Then the clanging of a chain, and a
noise as of the snapping back against stone of a broken link.
<P>
Again came silence.  But for a moment only.
Now he heard once more the soft feet approaching him.
He thought that he discerned wicked eyes gleaming
fearfully at him through the darkness.  He knew that he
could hear the heavy breathing of powerful lungs.
<P>
Then came the rush of many feet toward him, and
the THINGS were upon him.
<P>
Hands terminating in manlike fingers clutched at his
throat and arms and legs.  Hairy bodies strained and
struggled against his own smooth hide as he battled in
grim silence against these horrid foemen in the darkness
of the pits of ancient Aaanthor.
<P>
Thewed like some giant god was Carthoris of Helium,
yet in the clutches of these unseen creatures of the pit's
Stygian night he was helpless as a frail woman.
<P>
Yet he battled on, striking futile blows against great,
hispid breasts he could not see; feeling thick, squat
throats beneath his fingers; the drool of saliva upon
his cheek, and hot, foul breath in his nostrils.
<P>
Fangs, too, mighty fangs, he knew were close, and
why they did not sink into his flesh he could not guess.
<P>
At last he became aware of the mighty surging of a
number of his antagonists back and forth upon the great
chain that held him, and presently came the same sound
that he had heard at a little distance from him a short
time before he had been attacked--his chain had parted
and the broken end snapped back against the stone wall.
<P>
Now he was seized upon either side and dragged at
a rapid pace through the dark corridors--toward what
fate he could not even guess.
<P>
At first he had thought his foes might be of the tribe
of Torquas, but their hairy bodies belied that belief.
Now he was at last quite sure of their identity,
though why they had not killed and devoured him at
once he could not imagine.
<P>
After half an hour or more of rapid racing through
the underground passages that are a distinguishing
feature of all Barsoomian cities, modern as well
as ancient, his captors suddenly emerged into the
moonlight of a courtyard, far from the central plaza.
<P>
Immediately Carthoris saw that he was in the
power of a tribe of the great white apes of Barsoom.
All that had caused him doubt before as to the identity
of his attackers was the hairiness of their breasts,
for the white apes are entirely hairless except for
a great shock bristling from their heads.
<P>
Now he saw the cause of that which had deceived him--
across the chest of each of them were strips of hairy hide,
usually of banth, in imitation of the harness of the green
warriors who so often camped at their deserted city.
<P>
Carthoris had read of the existence of tribes of apes that
seemed to be progressing slowly toward higher standards
of intelligence.  Into the hands of such, he realized,
he had fallen; but--what were their intentions toward him?
<P>
As he glanced about the courtyard, he saw fully fifty
of the hideous beasts, squatting on their haunches,
and at a little distance from him another human being,
closely guarded.
<P>
As his eyes met those of his fellow-captive a smile
lit the other's face, and:  "Kaor, red man!" burst from
his lips.  It was Kar Komak, the bowman.
<P>
"Kaor!" cried Carthoris, in response.  "How came you
here, and what befell the princess?"
<P>
"Red men like yourself descended in mighty ships that
sailed the air, even as the great ships of my distant
day sailed the five seas," replied Kar Komak.  "They
fought with the green men of Torquas.  They slew
Komal, god of Lothar.  I thought they were your friends,
and I was glad when finally those of them who survived
the battle carried the red girl to one of the ships and
sailed away with her into the safety of the high air.
<P>
"Then the green men seized me, and carried me to a great,
empty city, where they chained me to a wall in a black pit.
Afterward came these and dragged me hither.
And what of you, red man?"
<P>
Carthoris related all that had befallen him, and as
the two men talked the great apes squatted about them
watching them intently.
<P>
"What are we to do now?" asked the bowman.
<P>
"Our case looks rather hopeless," replied Carthoris ruefully.
"These creatures are born man-eaters.  Why they have not
already devoured us I cannot imagine--there!"
he whispered.  "See?  The end is coming."
<P>
Kar Komak looked in the direction Carthoris indicated
to see a huge ape advancing with a mighty bludgeon.
<P>
"It is thus they like best to kill their prey," said Carthoris.
<P>
"Must we die without a struggle?" asked Kar Komak.
<P>
"Not I," replied Carthoris, "though I know how futile
our best defence must be against these mighty brutes!
Oh, for a long-sword!"
<P>
"Or a good bow," added Kar Komak, "and a utan of bowmen."
<P>
At the words Carthoris half sprang to his feet, only
to be dragged roughly down by his guard.
<P>
"Kar Komak!" he cried.  "Why cannot you do what Tario and
Jav did?  They had no bowmen other than those of their
own creation.  You must know the secret of their power.
Call forth your own utan, Kar Komak!"
<P>
The Lotharian looked at Carthoris in wide-eyed
astonishment as the full purport of the
suggestion bore in upon his understanding.
<P>
"Why not?" he murmured.
<P>
The savage ape bearing the mighty bludgeon was slinking
toward Carthoris.  The Heliumite's fingers were working
as he kept his eyes upon his executioner.  Kar Komak
bent his gaze penetratingly upon the apes.  The effort of
his mind was evidenced in the sweat upon his contracted brows.
<P>
The creature that was to slay the red man was almost
within arm's reach of his prey when Carthoris heard
a hoarse shout from the opposite side of the courtyard.
In common with the squatting apes and the demon with
the club he turned in the direction of the sound,
to see a company of sturdy bowmen rushing from the
doorway of a near-by building.
<P>
With screams of rage the apes leaped to their feet to
meet the charge.  A volley of arrows met them half-way,
sending a dozen rolling lifeless to the ground.  Then the
apes closed with their adversaries.  All their attention was
occupied by the attackers--even the guard had deserted
the prisoners to join in the battle.
<P>
"Come!" whispered Kar Komak.  "Now may we escape
while their attention is diverted from us by my bowmen."
<P>
"And leave those brave fellows leaderless?" cried Carthoris,
whose loyal nature revolted at the merest suggestion
of such a thing.
<P>
Kar Komak laughed.
<P>
"You forget," he said, "that they are but thin air--
figments of my brain.  They will vanish, unscathed, when
we have no further need for them.  Praised be your
first ancestor, redman, that you thought of this chance
in time!  It would never have occurred to me to imagine
that I might wield the same power that brought me into
existence."
<P>
"You are right," said Carthoris.  "Still, I hate to
leave them, though there is naught else to do," and so
the two turned from the courtyard, and making their way
into one of the broad avenues, crept stealthily in the
shadows of the building toward the great central plaza
upon which were the buildings occupied by the green
warriors when they visited the deserted city.
<P>
When they had come to the plaza's edge Carthoris halted.
<P>
"Wait here," he whispered.  "I go to fetch thoats,
since on foot we may never hope to escape the clutches
of these green fiends."
<P>
To reach the courtyard where the thoats were kept
it was necessary for Carthoris to pass through one of
the buildings which surrounded the square.  Which were
occupied and which not he could not even guess, so he
was compelled to take considerable chances to gain the
enclosure in which he could hear the restless beasts
squealing and quarrelling among themselves.
<P>
Chance carried him through a dark doorway into a
large chamber in which lay a score or more green warriors
wrapped in their sleeping silks and furs.  Scarce had
Carthoris passed through the short hallway that connected
the door of the building and the great room beyond it
than he became aware of the presence of something or some
one in the hallway through which he had but just passed.
<P>
He heard a man yawn, and then, behind him, he saw
the figure of a sentry rise from where the fellow had
been dozing, and stretching himself resume his wakeful
watchfulness.
<P>
Carthoris realized that he must have passed within
a foot of the warrior, doubtless rousing him from his
slumber.  To retreat now would be impossible.  Yet to
cross through that roomful of sleeping warriors seemed
almost equally beyond the pale of possibility.
<P>
Carthoris shrugged his broad shoulders and chose the
lesser evil.  Warily he entered the room.  At his right,
against the wall, leaned several swords and rifles and
spears--extra weapons which the warriors had stacked
here ready to their hands should there be a night alarm
calling them suddenly from slumber.  Beside each sleeper
lay his weapon--these were never far from their owners
from childhood to death.
<P>
The sight of the swords made the young man's palm itch.
He stepped quickly to them, selecting two short-swords--
one for Kar Komak, the other for himself; also some
trappings for his naked comrade.
<P>
Then he started directly across the centre of the
apartment among the sleeping Torquasians.
<P>
Not a man of them moved until Carthoris had completed
more than half of the short though dangerous journey.
Then a fellow directly in his path turned restlessly
upon his sleeping silks and furs.
<P>
The Heliumite paused above him, one of the short-swords
in readiness should the warrior awaken.  For what
seemed an eternity to the young prince the green man
continued to move uneasily upon his couch, then, as
though actuated by springs, he leaped to his feet and
faced the red man.
<P>
Instantly Carthoris struck, but not before a savage
grunt escaped the other's lips.  In an instant the room
was in turmoil.  Warriors leaped to their feet, grasping
their weapons as they rose, and shouting to one another
for an explanation of the disturbance.
<P>
To Carthoris all within the room was plainly visible
in the dim light reflected from without, for the further
moon stood directly at zenith; but to the eyes of the
newly-awakened green men objects as yet had not taken
on familiar forms--they but saw vaguely the figures of
warriors moving about their apartment.
<P>
Now one stumbled against the corpse of him whom
Carthoris had slain.  The fellow stooped and his hand
came in contact with the cleft skull.  He saw about him
the giant figures of other green men, and so he jumped
to the only conclusion that was open to him.
<P>
"The Thurds!" he cried.  "The Thurds are upon us!
Rise, warriors of Torquas, and drive home your swords
within the hearts of Torquas' ancient enemies!"
<P>
Instantly the green men began to fall upon one another
with naked swords.  Their savage lust of battle was
aroused.  To fight, to kill, to die with cold steel
buried in their vitals!  Ah, that to them was Nirvana.
<P>
Carthoris was quick to guess their error and take
advantage of it.  He knew that in the pleasure of killing
they might fight on long after they had discovered their
mistake, unless their attention was distracted by sight
of the real cause of the altercation, and so he lost no
time in continuing across the room to the doorway upon
the opposite side, which opened into the inner court,
where the savage thoats were squealing and fighting
among themselves.
<P>
Once here he had no easy task before him.  To catch
and mount one of these habitually rageful and intractable
beasts was no child's play under the best of conditions;
but now, when silence and time were such important
considerations, it might well have seemed quite hopeless
to a less resourceful and optimistic man than the son
of the great warlord.
<P>
From his father he had learned much concerning the
traits of these mighty beasts, and from Tars Tarkas,
also, when he had visited that great green jeddak among
his horde at Thark.  So now he centred upon the work
in hand all that he had ever learned about them from
others and from his own experience, for he, too,
had ridden and handled them many times.
<P>
The temper of the thoats of Torquas appeared even
shorter than their vicious cousins among the Tharks and
Warhoons, and for a time it seemed unlikely that he
should escape a savage charge on the part of a couple
of old bulls that circled, squealing, about him; but at
last he managed to get close enough to one of them
to touch the beast.  With the feel of his hand upon
the sleek hide the creature quieted, and in answer to
the telepathic command of the red man sank to its knees.
<P>
In a moment Carthoris was upon its back, guiding
it toward the great gate that leads from the courtyard
through a large building at one end into an avenue beyond.
<P>
The other bull, still squealing and enraged, followed
after his fellow.  There was no bridle upon either, for
these strange creatures are controlled entirely by
suggestion--when they are controlled at all.
<P>
Even in the hands of the giant green men bridle reins
would be hopelessly futile against the mad savagery and
mastodonic strength of the thoat, and so they are guided
by that strange telepathic power with which the men
of Mars have learned to communicate in a crude way
with the lower orders of their planet.
<P>
With difficulty Carthoris urged the two beasts to the
gate, where, leaning down, he raised the latch.  Then the
thoat that he was riding placed his great shoulder to the
skeel-wood planking, pushed through, and a moment later
the man and the two beasts were swinging silently down
the avenue to the edge of the plaza, where Kar Komak hid.
<P>
Here Carthoris found considerable difficulty in subduing
the second thoat, and as Kar Komak had never before
ridden one of the beasts, it seemed a most hopeless job;
but at last the bowman managed to scramble to the
sleek back, and again the two beasts fled softly
down the moss-grown avenues toward the open sea-
bottom beyond the city.
<P>
All that night and the following day and the second
night they rode toward the north-east.  No indication of
pursuit developed, and at dawn of the second day Carthoris
saw in the distance the waving ribbon of great trees
that marked one of the long Barsoomian water-ways.
<P>
Immediately they abandoned their thoats and approached
the cultivated district on foot.  Carthoris also
discarded the metal from his harness, or such of it as
might serve to identify him as a Heliumite, or of royal
blood, for he did not know to what nation belonged this
waterway, and upon Mars it is always well to assume
every man and nation your enemy until you have
learned the contrary.
<P>
It was mid-forenoon when the two at last entered one
of the roads that cut through the cultivated districts
at regular intervals, joining the arid wastes on either
side with the great, white, central highway that follows
through the centre from end to end of the far-reaching,
threadlike farm lands.
<P>
The high wall surrounding the fields served as a protection
against surprise by raiding green hordes, as well
as keeping the savage banths and other carnivora from
the domestic animals and the human beings upon the farms.
<P>
Carthoris stopped before the first gate he came to,
pounding for admission.  The young man who answered
his summons greeted the two hospitably, though he
looked with considerable wonder upon the white skin
and auburn hair of the bowman.
<P>
After he had listened for a moment to a partial narration
of their escape from the Torquasians, he invited them within,
took them to his house and bade the servants there prepare
food for them.
<P>
As they waited in the low-ceiled, pleasant livingroom
of the farmhouse until the meal should be ready,
Carthoris drew his host into conversation that
he might learn his nationality, and thus the nation
under whose dominion lay the waterway where circumstance
had placed him.
<P>
"I am Hal Vas," said the young man, "son of Vas Kor, of
Dusar, a noble in the retinue of Astok, Prince of Dusar. 
At present I am Dwar of the Road for this district."
<P>
Carthoris was very glad that he had not disclosed his
identity, for though he had no idea of anything that
had transpired since he had left Helium, or that Astok
was at the bottom of all his misfortunes, he well knew
that the Dusarian had no love for him, and that he could
hope for no assistance within the dominions of Dusar.
<P>
"And who are you?" asked Hal Vas.  "By your appearance
I take you for a fighting man, but I see no insignia
upon your harness.  Can it be that you are a panthan?"
<P>
Now, these wandering soldiers of fortune are common
upon Barsoom, where most men love to fight.  They sell
their services wherever war exists, and in the occasional
brief intervals when there is no organized warfare between
the red nations, they join one of the numerous expeditions
that are constantly being dispatched against the green men
in protection of the waterways that traverse the wilder
portions of the globe.
<P>
When their service is over they discard the metal of
the nation they have been serving until they shall have
found a new master.  In the intervals they wear no
insignia, their war-worn harness and grim weapons being
sufficient to attest their calling.
<P>
The suggestion was a happy one, and Carthoris embraced the
chance it afforded to account satisfactorily for himself.
There was, however, a single drawback.  In times of war
such panthans as happened to be within the domain of a
belligerent nation were compelled to don the insignia
of that nation and fight with her warriors.
<P>
As far as Carthoris knew Dusar was not at war with
any other nation, but there was never any telling when
one red nation would be flying at the throat of a neighbour,
even though the great and powerful alliance at the head
of which was his father, John Carter, had managed to
maintain a long peace upon the greater portion of Barsoom.
<P>
A pleasant smile lighted Hal Vas' face as Carthoris
admitted his vocation.
<P>
"It is well," exclaimed the young man, "that you
chanced to come hither, for here you will find the means
of obtaining service in short order.  My father, Vas Kor,
is even now with me, having come hither to recruit
a force for the new war against Helium."
