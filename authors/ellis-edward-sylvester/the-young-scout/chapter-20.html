<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Maurice Freeman was withdrawing from his perilous position, when
without the slightest warning an Apache warrior stepped from behind
a rock a short way ahead and confronted him.</p>

<p>When it is stated that this individual held a Winchester in his
right hand and carried it at his thigh, it will be conceded that
his action was altogether contrary to that of his people under
such circumstances; for it gave the white man a chance to bring
his weapon to his shoulder by a lightning-like movement and to
secure the "drop" on him—one of the most difficult of all feats
to perform. But when it is added further, that the Apache belonged
to the White Mountain branch of the tribe his conduct will be
understood.</p>

<p>No sight could have been more welcome to Freeman, whose face
lit up with pleasure at the discovery that, instead of an enemy,
he had the best of friends at his elbow. He paused a moment, and
then, with the whispered word, "<em>Mendez</em>," on his lips,
moved toward him.</p>

<p>The dusky trailer did not speak, but raised his left hand as
an appeal for caution; and beckoning him to advance, turned away
and resumed his walk with that catlike movement peculiar to his
race and which was absolutely without noise.</p>

<p>Freeman understood what he meant; the situation was too dangerous
for him to hold, and must be changed without delay. He did his
best to follow instructions, though he could not do so with the
perfection of his guide. The latter continued the lead for fully
two hundred yards and then halted, turned around and silently
watched the white man’s approach.</p>

<p>By this time the latter had lost the trepidation he felt, when
the soft, birdlike signal reached him from different points of
the compass. Wherever the Apache camp might be, he was now at
a safe distance from it.</p>

<p>"I didn’t expect to meet you, Mendez," said the settler in a
guarded undertone, "and I needn’t tell you——"</p>

<p>"Be careful; the trees and rocks have ears."</p>

<p>It was Lieutenant Decker who uttered these warning words, as
he stepped into view, very much as the scout had done a short
time before. He smilingly extended his hand to his astonished
friend, adding by way of explanation:</p>

<p>"You didn’t expect either of us, but we are here all the same;
the fight which I looked for this morning was unavoidably postponed,
but I am hopeful that I shan’t be disappointed after all."</p>

<p>"Why, lieutenant, I am pleased beyond expression, but you owe
me an explanation of how this was brought about."</p>

<p>—<em>The Young Scout.</em>]</p>

<p>"It was all due to <em>him</em>," replied the officer, nodding
his head toward the Apache, who did not open his lips, but stood,
looking back over the route he had just traversed, as if watching
for some expected form, or listening for a signal that had not
yet been made.</p>

<p>"I suppose so, but that fact does not explain matters."</p>

<p>"Mendez is not addicted to talking, but I think I learned more
of his thoughts than any one else. When you parted from us this
forenoon, I supposed you meant to go home and wait until night,
before making any move to help your child, but that shrewd fellow
read your intentions in your face and in your manner. He told
me you meant to ride away from the river until out of our sight
and then cross and take up the trail of Maroz and Ceballos. I
would have followed you and protested against such foolhardiness,
but knew it was useless."</p>

<p>"He hit the truth," remarked Freeman, with an admiring glance
at their friend, whose attention seemed still drawn away from
them and who showed no interest in the conversation.</p>

<p>"Instead of attempting to interfere with you, we rode fast to
the fort and reported to the colonel; he had already learned the
truth from the Indian scouts whom he had sent across the river
some hours before. The indications were unmistakable that eight
or ten hostiles were on the war path, and, unless prompt measures
were taken, the number would be increased. The colonel isn’t the
man to hesitate at such times and he moved quickly. A number of
our best men at the post, with three White Mountain Apaches, all
well mounted and under Captain Shindle, who was a veteran at this
business before I entered the Point, set out for the mountains."</p>

<p>"Where are they now?"</p>

<p>"All that I can say is that they are hard at it, but I have no
knowledge of their precise location. The scouts who bore the tidings
to the colonel were certain the rendezvous was fully a mile back
of where we saw the signal smoke, and which was meant to mislead
us more than to guide their allies. The captain will aim to get
to the rear and to approach from the south. This will give him
a chance to prevent the withdrawal of the bucks further into the
mountains. They will not look for a movement of that kind, and
unless their scouts have discovered his purpose, he has a fair
prospect of circumventing them."</p>

<p>"But where are Colgate, Peyser, and Redfield?"</p>

<p>"With the captain; this is a private campaign of Mendez and myself,
but we are willing to let you in as a partner on the ground floor."</p>

<p>"Nothing could suit me better, but, if the Apaches are so far
off, why this extreme caution, and what chance is there of our
doing anything to help my child?"</p>

<p>"I’ll admit that the prospect isn’t dazzling, but, if the theory
on which Mendez is working proves correct, we shall have an opportunity
to effect something."</p>

<p>"What is his theory?"</p>

<p>"That Maroz and Ceballos are not far from this spot, while the
main band is a mile beyond in the mountains. They are watching
the trail, along which they expect the pursuit to be made, and
will telegraph the fact in their own way the moment it is discovered
to the main party. There may be others with the couple, but that
is the game they are playing."</p>

<p>"If Mendez is right, what have they done with my boy?"</p>

<p>"He is with Maroz and Ceballos."</p>

<p>"Would they not be likely to place him in charge of the main
band, so as to lessen the danger of his rescue."</p>

<p>"That would be <em>my</em> theory, but I suspect <em>he</em>
thinks differently."</p>

<p>"I have as much faith as you in the woodcraft of Mendez, but
I can’t accept <em>that</em> theory."</p>

<p>Freeman would have been only too glad to believe as did the guide,
but the doubt he uttered was that which would have come to any
clear-headed man. If Maroz and Ceballos were acting as the rear
guard of the hostiles, they could not afford to handicap themselves
with the care of a prisoner, the possession of whom, it may be
said, was the key to the situation.</p>

<p>If the boy were placed in charge of the stronger party, the two
would be untrammeled in the crisis which they had every reason
to believe was at hand. This was the situation, as it presented
itself to Freeman and Lieutenant Decker, but the latter’s convincing
remark was:</p>

<p>"It strikes me as mighty odd, but Mendez wouldn’t believe what
he does without the best of reasons."</p>

<p>"Have you questioned him?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He told me it was none of my business: not exactly in those
words," added the smiling officer, "but his refusal to enlighten
me amounted to the same thing."</p>

<p>Freeman turned toward the subject of their conversation, but
he was so absorbed in watching a point to his left, and listening
for that which he heard not, that the remarks seemed to be lost
upon him.</p>

<p>"Let me ask how near we are to the spot where Mendez suspects
Maroz and Ceballos to be."</p>

<p>The lieutenant had put the same question to the guide before
coming upon the settler, and he answered:</p>

<p>"Not more than a quarter of a mile."</p>

<p>"A quarter of a mile!" repeated the astonished Freeman, "why
I was sure I was within a dozen rods of it."</p>

<p>"Nothing is easier than to be mistaken."</p>

<p>It is singular how the emotion of mirth will intrude at the most
inopportune times. Maurice Freeman was oppressed by a grief such
as he had never known before, but he now laughed silently and
heartily. He recalled his extreme trepidation, when he believed
he was near the Apache camp, his effort to withdraw and the caution
of Mendez in guiding him away. To him the picture was that of
a big urchin, who has ignorantly approached some danger, and whose
father seeks to coax him back to safety. The figure of himself
playing the part of booby was what caused him to laugh, but his
mirth quickly vanished, and he wondered at himself for having
shown it.</p>

<p>"If such care must be used when we are so far from the camp,
how will it be when we get within sight of it?"</p>

<p>The lieutenant shook his head.</p>

<p>"I’m afraid there isn’t much show for making that test; I have
been pleading with Mendez to take me in as a full partner and
to allow me to be at his elbow when the first squint of the camp
is obtained, but my eloquence was wasted. The fact is," continued
the young officer, becoming serious, "he is right. I don’t believe
the white man lives who can steal up to an Apache camp in the
day-time, or during the early part of the evening, no matter how
dark, without discovery, and I needn’t tell you what <em>that</em>
means for you and me. After midnight, when they are asleep, there
might be a show, but even then Mendez must be in the advance.
He expected to find you somewhere in this neighborhood, and you
have been as much an object of search for the last hour or two
as the hostiles themselves."</p>

<p>"What was his purpose in signaling from different points, when
he located me?"</p>

<p>"I presume to give you a good scare."</p>

<p>"Well, he succeeded! I was never so rattled in all my life. But
I was quite near the place where I expected to find Maroz and
Ceballos."</p>

<p>"That may be, but you were away off in your calculations; you
made a mistake; I have done something of the kind once or twice
during my checkered career."</p>

<p>While the conversation continued in this vein, generally serious,
but now and then lightened by the bubbling humor of the lieutenant,
darkness settled about them. This was most welcome, for it brought
nearer the hour for action. Between the downsetting and uprising
of the sun, the all-important question must be settled as to what
was to be the fate of little Fulton Freeman.</p>

<p>The father and the lieutenant talked several minutes longer,
while their forms grew indistinct in the gloom, until a remark
of the officer caused the other to turn his head toward Mendez.
He had vanished.</p>

<p>"What’s become of him?" whispered Freeman, as if his absence
indicated some new peril at hand.</p>

<p>"He’s gone to take a look at things; he moved away fifteen minutes
ago."</p>

<p>"I didn’t hear him."</p>

<p>"Nor did I, but I saw him, just as you have seen the shadow of
a cloud whisk over the earth. Of course, there is no saying when
he will be back, since that depends on what he learns, but we
can count on his being here before daylight."</p>

<p>"And in the meantime we have nothing to do but to wait."</p>

<p>"You hit it that time, and we can’t find more comfortable quarters
than these."</p>

<p>It would not do to go far from the spot, since it might cause
Mendez trouble in finding them, beside which there was no object
in doing so, since one part of the mountain differed little from
another. Accordingly, they assumed lolling postures on the nearest
rock, which was still warm from the rays of the sun, and continued
their conversation in tones that could not have been heard more
than a dozen feet away.</p>

<p>Freeman had eaten nothing since morning, and the thought of food
had not been with him; but when the lieutenant produced a small,
substantial lunch, which he was thoughtful enough to bring, the
two shared it and were refreshed therefrom.</p>

<p>"Now, if I had a drink of water," said the elder, "I would be
satisfied; it seems to me I never felt more thirsty, but I can
manage to stand it until morning."</p>

<p>"There’s no need of that; a stream is within a hundred feet of
us. It doesn’t amount to much, and is as warm as dishwater, but
it is a thousand per cent. better than thirst."</p>

<p>The lieutenant located the spot for his friend, proposing that
they should go thither separately, in order that one of them might
be sure of being on hand when Mendez returned. But the scout had
been absent so short a time that this precaution seemed useless,
and, when Freeman asked him to show him the way, he complied willingly.</p>

<p>The night had a gibbous moon, and, as the sky was without a cloud,
considerable light reached the earth, where the rays were not
obstructed. The vegetable growth in this portion of the Apache
range is sparse, the small trees being scattered, so that it was
easy to pick their way for the short distance necessary to reach
the water.</p>

<p>As the lieutenant had intimated, the draught was uninviting to
one not very thirsty. The rivulet issued from under the roots
of a tree, where it was to be supposed it would be quite cool,
but it was lukewarm and roiled, as the officer learned when he
quenched his thirst during the afternoon, but the drink was none
the less refreshing on that account.</p>

<p>"Freeman," said the lieutenant, looking around them, as if suspecting
the presence of an enemy in their vicinity, "suppose you wait
here for a few minutes, while I go back to the old spot."</p>

<p>"Why do you propose that?"</p>

<p>"I fancied just now I heard something suspicious. Maybe I was
mistaken, but when you are in this confounded Apache country,
the rule is to believe every man guilty until proved innocent."</p>

<p>"And if you were not mistaken?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied the young officer in his off-hand way, "it’s
likely in that case that there will be music in the air."</p>

<p>"I mean as to what <em>I</em> shall do. Am I to stand here and
take no part in the business? Is that your idea of how one comrade
should stand by another?"</p>

<p>The question may seem trifling, but it perplexed the lieutenant
for the moment. The idea of comradeship with him, as it is with
every true soldier, is that one shall stand by his friend to the
death. The basest crime that a soldier can commit is to desert
a comrade in extremity. Ordinarily, therefore, the answer of Decker
would have been prompt, or rather there would have been no occasion
for asking the question, but while Freeman was a brave man, his
powers of keen, subtle reasoning, of cool-headedness and quick
resources were affected by his mental distress over the peril
and uncertainty about his little boy. It is the rule among physicians
for no member of the profession to attend unaided his own family
(unless the peril make it unavoidable), since affection must weaken
the judgment. The situation of the father was somewhat analogous.</p>

<p>In other words the thought of the lieutenant was that it would
be safer for them to be apart, if danger should come. The elder
not only could not aid the younger, but would increase his own
peril. He must, therefore, stay where he was.</p>

<p>"I wish you would remain here until I signal for you to join
me. It may be that if there is anything of the kind in the air,
it will be best to let it alone, and there is more chance of that
with one of us than with both. If I find myself in need of you
I will call."</p>

<p>Freeman could make no objection to this, and he sat down in the
stunted undergrowth near the spring, reflecting that with the
fervid heat he was likely to feel a renewal of thirst every fifteen
minutes or less, and was favorably located for quenching the same
without any trying delay.</p>

<p>"Listen for the signal," whispered the lieutenant again, "and
don’t join me until you hear it. I will make it as soon as I am
convinced the way is clear."</p>

<p>The space between the spring and the rock where they meant to
await the return of Mendez was but little more than a hundred
yards. It was broken by boulders, a number of depressions, with
here and there a dwarf pine, one of those sturdy trees which seem
to have the power of the moss to extract the needed nourishment
where most plants would die for lack of it. Though the moon was
almost overhead, it was impossible for either of the men to discern
objects for a third of the distance which separated them. The
lieutenant had not taken more than a dozen steps in his guarded
manner, with his body in a crouching posture and all his senses
alert, when the watchful Freeman was as much alone as if the nearest
man were miles distant. The brave young officer was swallowed
up in the gloom and gone.</p>

<p>"Now," thought the elder, finding himself alone, "the Apaches
must know about this spring; those people I suppose understand
what hunger and thirst are, though they have less trouble from
it than any persons I ever met, and it isn’t impossible that some
of them may take a notion to drink from the same spring. That
being the case, the prudent thing for me to do is to imbibe freely
while I have the chance."</p>

<p>Having drank deeply only a few minutes before, Freeman felt as
if he must make excuse to his conscience for his dissipation,
but the water was delicious and the supply all-sufficient. He
quaffed his fill, and then replacing his hat stole softly from
the spot and assumed a crouching posture behind a convenient boulder,
where there was little likelihood of an enemy stealing upon him
unawares.</p>

<p>"The lieutenant is full of pluck," he reflected, "but the pluckiest
man that ever lived sometimes needs the help of a child. There
isn’t anything he wouldn’t do for me, and I will stand by him
to the last extremity."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lieutenant Decker was alert and guarded in every step
he took. His principle that while in the Apache country every
indication of possible danger, no matter how slight, should be
accepted as the reality, was the right principle. Its disregard
has brought death to many a brave soldier on the frontier. Lieutenant
Decker welcomed a lively brush with the hostiles, but he would
have been the idiot which he was not, to disregard the experience
of those that had fought these fierce people before he was born,
while brief as was his own experience, its lesson was too impressive
to be forgotten.</p>

<p>For perhaps a fourth of the distance he advanced almost on his
hands and knees, stealing from boulder to boulder, at times almost
flat on his face, then raising his head, peering here and there,
looking and listening with the utmost keenness at his command.</p>

<p>"There is no wind blowing though I heard a rustle once or twice;
I don’t think there has been enough to move a leaf for the last
half hour. Now and then we meet wild animals in this part of the
world, but that slight noise—if there <em>was</em> a noise—wasn’t
made by any of them. It looks as if some of the Apaches are hereabouts."</p>

<p>Perhaps a veteran scout would have argued that, inasmuch as the
young officer had heard a noise—slight though it was—the fact
was against its having been made by one of the dreaded red men,
since none of them would commit a blunder of that nature, when
in the neighborhood of an enemy, but it might be they did not
think any enemy was near, so it was wise for the lieutenant to
proceed on the theory that some of Geronimo’s followers were prowling
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>For a period of ten minutes the young officer held his place
immovable. During that time the oppressive silence was unbroken
by the slightest disturbance. Everything seemed absolutely "dead"
around him, the atmosphere itself being as pulseless as the warm
rocks and boulders on which he rested his hand, as he glided near
them. Certain that he had not made the least betrayal, the lieutenant
began to ask himself whether he had not been mistaken from the
first in his suspicions.</p>

<p>With his head so near the ground, he lay flat, and pressed his
ear against the earth, as do hunters and scouts when in the vicinity
of enemies. At the moment of resorting to this test, the ear told
something faintly, but it was gone at the moment he composed himself
to listen—a fact which made it seem that the noise was caused
by the first contact of his own ear with the ground.</p>

<p>"Everything seems to be all right," he reflected, finally resuming
his advance to the spot where he and Freeman had settled down
to await the return of their dusky friend.</p>

<p>A rod further and Decker was checked by a rock that must have
weighed several tons. He could pass it by turning to the right
or left or climbing over it. It need not be said that the last
method was to be used only as a final resort. He paused once more
and considered on which side it was best to flank it—a question
which it would seem could not be settled by an hour’s deliberation,
but there is no accounting for the impressions which sometimes
sway persons in perilous emergencies. The lieutenant was cautiously
creeping to the left, and had turned the corner, when he abruptly
retreated and headed to the right.</p>

<p>Advancing in this Apache-like style, he held the Winchester which
he carried with him in his left hand, both hands and knees being
used to aid his progress, while he peered ahead in the gloom and
listened with the intensity he had shown from the first. The configuration
of the rock and the position of the moon (not exactly in the zenith),
threw a line of shadow to the right of the immense boulder just
far enough to enfold his figure. On the other side there was not
a particle of shade, so that his change of advance had brought
that much advantage to him.</p>

<p>From the corner of the rock around which he had just crept, to
the corresponding edge, was little more than twelve feet, and
half the distance was passed, when the very peril against which
he was maneuvering presented itself. Beyond the further corner
appeared the head of an Apache warrior, thrust forward, seemingly
with the slow, noiseless motion of the hand of a clock. He, too,
was in a crouching posture, for the impish face, with its dangling
mass of hair, was no more than a foot above the ground. It was
partly in moonlight and partly in shadow, but shown so plainly
that there could be no possible mistake.</p>

<p>Although the position of the lieutenant was the more favorable,
the action of the hostile proved that he was as quick to detect
him as the other was to observe his dusky foe. Before Decker could
draw his revolver or bring his rifle into play, the head of the
savage whisked from sight. It vanished so suddenly indeed as to
suggest the figurehead of a wooden image that was snapped back
by machinery.</p>

<p>The situation was growing interesting. Here were two deadly enemies
within eight or ten feet of each other, both equally alive to
the fact, both armed and ready to take instant advantage of any
turn that might offer.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Lieutenant Decker felt comfortable. He
knew the cunning of these terrible red men, and would much rather
fight them in the open or on ground where the chances of each
were the same. This savage had been trained in the cunning and
woodcraft of his people, and knew things which could not have
come as yet to the white man. But the latter was quick of perception
and was learning fast in the crucial school of experience.</p>

<p>In one sense, the two were on the same footing. They were within
striking distance, with the rock between them, and he who was
the first to discover the other, even for an instant, must win
in the desperate game. It was, in fact, the question of which
could "get the drop" on the other.</p>

<p>The Apache might come around the corner of the rock in front,
or at the rear, or possibly he would try to steal over the top,
so as to fire down on his enemy. If he could forestall the white
man, by a moment, it would inevitably be fatal to the latter.</p>

<p>There is a stratagem as old as the hills and one with which doubtless
every reader of these pages is familiar. Lieutenant Decker gently
removed his hat and placed it on the muzzle of his rifle. Then
creeping slightly forward, he extended the weapon, intending to
make the hat show around the edge of the boulder. It will be understood
that the idea was to represent himself as peering beyond the edge,
so as to draw the shot of the Apache, and then let fly at him
before he could recover from the blunder.</p>

<p>The young man had almost reached the corner with the extended
Winchester, when he withdrew it and replaced the hat on his head.</p>

<p>"If there were a law against persons making fools of themselves,
I would violate it about every hour of the day," was his thought.
"I’m glad no one saw me."</p>

<p>For, while reaching forward with one arm, he awakened to the
fact that even if the stratagem was successful, it would not help
him. Suppose the Apache sent a bullet through the hat, how could
that aid the officer? The Indian would discover his mistake before
Decker could bring his body to the same spot and fire—an act which
would place him in exactly the same peril that the hat had encountered.
Furthermore, more than likely the warrior owned a repeating Winchester.
If so, the true course for him was to fire at the hat the instant
it showed and give the impression that he had been tricked. That
would encourage the white man to rush to the attack and bring
to his foe the exact chance for which he was maneuvering and waiting.
Consequently, this time-honored and once brilliant strategy would
prove a boomerang that would recoil with disastrous effect upon
the originator.</p>

<p>The momentous question remained as to the Apache’s method of
attack, for, whatever it was, it must be forestalled. The officer
was obliged to watch the front and the rear, and make sure that
his enemy did not glide over the top of the rock like a rattlesnake,
and strike down from above.</p>

<p>Decker leaned his rifle against the face of the boulder and drew
his revolver. The former weapon was too awkward to be used in
the impending encounter. The smaller was equally effective and
tenfold more handy.</p>
