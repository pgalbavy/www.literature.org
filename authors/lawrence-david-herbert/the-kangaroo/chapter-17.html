<p>
Dear Lovat, also Mrs. Lovat: I don't think it is very nice of you that
you don't even call with a tract or a tube-rose, when you know I am so
smitten. Yours, Kangaroo.
P.S. - Bullets in my marsupial pouch.</p>

<p>Of course Richard went up at once: and Harriet sent a little box with
all the different strange shells from the beach. They are curious and
interesting for a sick man.</p>

<p>Somers found Kangaroo in bed, very yellow, and thin, almost
lantern-jawed, with haunted, frightened eyes. The room had many flowers,
and was perfumed with eau-de-cologne, but through the perfume came an
unpleasant, discernable stench. The nurse had asked Richard, please to
be very quiet.</p>

<p>Kangaroo put out a thin yellow hand. His black hair came wispily,
pathetically over his forehead. But he said, with a faint, husky
briskness:</p>

<p>&quot;Hello! Come at last,&quot; and he took Somers' hand in a damp clasp.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know whether you could see visitors,&quot; said Richard.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't. Sit down. Behave yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>Somers sat down, only anxious to behave himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Harriet sent you such a silly present,&quot; he said. &quot;Just shells we have
picked up from the shore. She thought you might like to play with them
on the counterpane - .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like that sloppy Coventry Patmore poem. Let me look.&quot;</p>

<p>The sick man took the little Sorrento box with its inlaid design of
sirens and peered in at the shells.</p>

<p>&quot;I can smell the sea in them,&quot; he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>And very slowly he began to look at the shells, one by one. There were
black ones like buds of coal, and black ones with a white spiral thread,
and funny knobbly black and white ones, and tiny purple ones, and a
bright sea-orange, semi-transparent clamp shell, and little pink ones
with long, sharp points, and glass ones, and lovely pearly ones, and
then those that Richard had put in, worn shells like sea-ivory,
marvellous substance, with all the structure showing; spirals like fairy
stair-cases, and long, pure phallic pieces that were the centres of big
shells, from which the whorl was all washed away: also curious flat,
oval discs, with a lovely whorl traced on them, and an eye in the
centre. Richard liked these especially.</p>

<p>Kangaroo looked at them briefly, one by one, as if they were bits of
uninteresting printed paper.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, take them away,&quot; he said, pushing the box aside. And his face had
a faint spot of pink in the cheeks.</p>

<p>&quot;They may amuse you some time when you are alone,&quot; said Richard,
apologetically.</p>

<p>&quot;They make me know I have never been born,&quot; said Kangaroo, huskily.</p>

<p>Richard was startled, and he didn't know what to answer. So he sat
still, and Kangaroo lay still, staring blankly in front of him. Somers
could not detach his mind from the slight, yet pervading sickening
smell.</p>

<p>&quot;My sewers leak,&quot; said Kangaroo, bitterly, as if divining the other's
thought.</p>

<p>&quot;But they will get better,&quot; said Richard.</p>

<p>The sick man did not answer, and Somers just sat still.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you forgiven me?&quot; asked Kangaroo, looking at Somers.</p>

<p>&quot;There was nothing to forgive,&quot; said Richard, his face grave and still.</p>

<p>&quot;I knew you hadn't,&quot; said Kangaroo. Richard knitted his brows. He looked
at the long, yellow face. It was so strange and so frightening to him.</p>

<p>&quot;You bark at me as if I were Little Red Riding-hood,&quot; he said, smiling.
Kangaroo turned dark, inscrutable eyes on him.</p>

<p>&quot;Help me!&quot; he said, almost in a whisper. &quot;Help me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Richard.</p>

<p>Kangaroo held out his hand: and Richard took it. But not without a
slight sense of repugnance. Then he listened to the faint, far-off
noises of the town, and looked at the beautiful flowers in the room:
violets, orchids, tube-roses, delicate yellow and red roses, iceland
poppies, orange like transmitted light, lilies. It was like a tomb, like
a mortuary, all the flowers, and that other faint, sickening odour.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not wrong, you know,&quot; said Kangaroo.</p>

<p>&quot;No one says you are,&quot; laughed Richard gently.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not wrong. Love is still the greatest.&quot; His voice sank in its
huskiness to a low resonance. Richard's heart stood still. Kangaroo lay
quite motionless, but with some of the changeless pride which had lent
him beauty, at times, when he was himself. The Lamb of God grown into a
sheep. Yes, the nobility.</p>

<p>&quot;You heard Willie Struthers' speech?&quot; said Kangaroo, his face changing
as he looked up at Somers.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seemed to me logical,&quot; said Richard, not knowing how to answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Logical!&quot; Even Kangaroo flickered with surprise. &quot;You and logic!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You see,&quot; said Richard very gently, &quot;the educated world has preached
the divinity of work at the lower classes. They broke them in, like
draught-horses, put them all in the collar and set them all between the
shafts. There they are, all broken in, WORKERS. They are conscious of
nothing save that they are workers. They accept the fact that nothing is
divine but work: work being service, and service being love. The highest
is work. Very well then, accept the conclusion if you accept the
premises. The working classes are the highest, it is for them to inherit
the earth. You can't deny that, if you assert the sacredness of work.&quot;</p>

<p>He spoke quietly, gently. But he spoke because he felt it was kinder,
even to the sick man, than to avoid discussion altogether.</p>

<p>&quot;But I don't believe in the sacredness of work, Lovat,&quot; said Kangaroo.</p>

<p>&quot;No, but they believe it themselves. And it follows from the sacredness
of love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want them to be men, men, men - not implements at a job.&quot; The voice
was weak now, and took queer, high notes.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know. But men inspired by love. And love has only service as its
means of expression.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know? You never love,&quot; said Kangaroo in a faint, sharp
voice. &quot;The joy of love is in being with the beloved - as near as you can
get - 'And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.' - For life,
for life's sake, Lovat, not for work. Lift them up, that they may live.&quot;</p>

<p>Richard was silent. He knew it was no good arguing.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think it can't be done?&quot; asked Kangaroo, his voice growing
fuller. &quot;I hope I may live to show you. The working men have not
realised yet what love is. The perfect love that men may have for one
another, passing the love of women. Oh, Lovat, they still have that to
experience. Don't harden your heart. Don't stiffen your neck before your
old Jewish Kangaroo. You know it is true. Perfect love casteth out fear,
Lovat. Teach a man how to love his mate, with a pure and fearless love.
Oh, Lovat, think what can be done that way!&quot;</p>

<p>Somers was very pale, his face set.</p>

<p>&quot;Say you believe me. Say you believe me. And let us bring it to pass
together. If I have you with me I know we can do it. If you had been
with me this would never have happened to me.&quot;</p>

<p>His face changed again as if touched with acid at the thought. Somers
sat still, remote. He was distressed, but it made him feel more remote.</p>

<p>&quot;What class do you feel that you belong to, as far as you belong to any
class?&quot; asked Kangaroo, his eyes on Richard's face.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't feel I belong to any class. But as far as I DO belong - it is to
the working-classes. I know that. I can't change.&quot;</p>

<p>Kangaroo watched him eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish I did,&quot; he said, eagerly. Then, after a pause, he added: &quot;They
have never known the full beauty of love, the working classes. They have
never admitted it. Work, bread has always stood first. But we can take
away that obstacle. Teach them the beauty of love between men, Richard,
teach them the highest - greater love than this hath no man - teach them
how to love their own mate, and you will solve the problem of work for
ever. Richard, this is true, you know it is true. How beautiful it would
be! How beautiful it would be! It would complete the perfect circle - .&quot;</p>

<p>His voice faded down into a whisper, so that Somers seemed to hear it
from far off. And it seemed like some far off voice of annunciation. Yet
Richard's face was hard and clear and sea-bitter as one of the worn
shells he had brought.</p>

<p>&quot;The faithful, fearless love of man for man,&quot; whispered Kangaroo, as he
lay with his dark eyes on Richard's face, and the wisp of hair on his
forehead. Beautiful, he was beautiful again, like a transfiguration.</p>

<p>&quot;We've got to save the People, we've got to do it. And when shall we
begin, when shall we begin, you and I?&quot; he repeated in a sudden full
voice. &quot;Only when we dare to lead them, Lovat,&quot; he added in a murmur.
&quot;The love of man for wife and children, the love of man for man, so that
each would lay down his life for the other, then the love of man for
beauty, for truth, for the Right. Isn't that so! Destroy no love. Only
open the field for further love.&quot;</p>

<p>He lay still for some moments after this speech, that ended in a whisper
almost. Then he looked with a wonderful smile at Somers, without saying
a word, only smiling from his eyes, strangely, wonderfully. But Richard
was scared.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't that all honest Injun, Lovat!&quot; he whispered playfully.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe it is,&quot; said Richard, though with unchanging face. His eyes,
however, were perplexed and tormented.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course you do. Of course you do,&quot; said Kangaroo softly. &quot;But you are
the most obstinate little devil and child that ever opposed a wise man
like me. For example, don't you love me in your heart of hearts, only
you daren't admit it! I know you do. I know you do. But admit it, man,
admit it, and the world will be a bigger place to you. You are afraid of
love.&quot;</p>

<p>Richard was more and more tormented in himself.</p>

<p>&quot;In a way, I love you, Kangaroo,&quot; he said. &quot;Our souls are alike
somewhere. But it is true I don't WANT to love you.&quot;</p>

<p>And he looked in distress at the other man.</p>

<p>Kangaroo gave a real little laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;Was ever woman so coy and hard to please!&quot; he said, in a warm, soft
voice. &quot;Why don't you want to love me, you stiff-necked and
uncircumcised Philistine! Don't you want to love Harriet, for example?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I don't want to love anybody. Truly. It simply makes me frantic and
murderous to have to feel loving any more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why did you come to me this morning?&quot;</p>

<p>The question was pertinent. Richard was baffled.</p>

<p>&quot;In a way,&quot; he said vaguely, &quot;because I love you. But love makes me feel
I should die.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is your wilful refusal of it,&quot; said Kangaroo, a little wearily. &quot;Put
your hand on my throat, it aches a little.&quot;</p>

<p>He took Richard's hand and laid it over his warm, damp, sick throat,
where the pulse beat so heavy and sick, and the Adam's apple stood out
hard.</p>

<p>&quot;You must be still now,&quot; said Lovat, gentle like a physician.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't let me die!&quot; murmured Kangaroo, almost inaudible, looking into
Richard's muted face. The white, silent face did not change, only the
blue-grey eyes were abstract with thought. He did not answer. And even
Kangaroo dared not ask for an answer.</p>

<p>At last he let go Richard's hand from his throat. Richard withdrew it,
and wanted to wipe it on his handkerchief. But he refrained, knowing the
sick man would notice. He pressed it very silently, quietly, under his
thigh, to wipe it on his trousers.</p>

<p>&quot;You are tired now,&quot; he said softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will tell the nurse to come?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye - be better,&quot; said Richard sadly, touching the man's cheek with
his finger-tips slightly. Kangaroo opened his eyes with a smile that was
dark as death. &quot;Come again,&quot; he whispered, closing his eyes once more.
Richard went blindly to the door. The nurse was there waiting.</p>

<p>Poor Richard, he went away almost blinded with stress and grief and
bewilderment. Was it true what Kangaroo had said? Was it true? Did he,
Richard, love Kangaroo? Did he love Kangaroo, and deny it? And was the
denial just a piece of fear. Was it just fear that made him hold back
from admitting his love for the other man?</p>

<p>Fear? Yes, it was fear. But then, did he not believe also in the God of
fear? There was not only one God. There was not only the God of love. To
insist that there is only one God, and that God the source of Love, is
perhaps as fatal as the complete denial of God, and of all mystery. He
believed in the God of fear, of darkness, of passion, and of silence,
the God that made a man realise his own sacred aloneness. If Kangaroo
could have realised that too then Richard felt he would have loved him,
in a dark, separate, other way of love. But never this all in all thing.</p>

<p>As for politics, there was so little to choose, and choice meant
nothing. Kangaroo and Struthers were both right, both of them. Lords or
doctors or Jewish financiers SHOULD not have more money than a simple
working man, just because they were lords and doctors and financiers. If
service was the all in all it was absolutely wrong. And Willie Struthers
was right.</p>

<p>The same with Kangaroo. If love was the all in all then the great range
of love was complete as he put it: a man's love for wife and children,
his sheer, confessed love for his friend, his mate, and his love for
beauty and truth. Whether love was all in all or not this was the great,
wonderful range of love, and love was not complete short of the whole.</p>

<p>But - but something else was true at the same time. Man's isolation was
always a supreme truth and fact, not to be forsworn. And the mystery of
apartness. And the greater mystery of the dark God beyond a man, the God
that gives a man passion, and the dark, unexplained blood-tenderness
that is deeper than love, but so much more obscure, impersonal, and the
brave, silent blood-pride, knowing his own separateness, and the
sword-strength of his derivation from the dark God. This dark,
passionate religiousness and inward sense of an inwelling magnificence,
direct flow from the unknowable God, this filled Richard's heart first,
and human love seemed such a fighting for candle-light, when the dark is
so much better. To meet another dark worshipper, that would be the best
of human meetings. But strain himself into a feeling of absolute human
love, he just couldn't do it.</p>

<p>Man's ultimate love for man? Yes, yes, but only in the separate darkness
of man's love for the present, unknowable God. Human love, as a god-act,
very well. Human love as a ritual offering to the God who is out of the
light, well and good. But human love as an all in all, ah, no, the
strain and the unreality of it were too great.</p>

<p>He thought of Jack, and the strange, unforgettable uptilted grin on
Jack's face as he spoke of the satisfaction of killing. This was true,
too. As true as love and loving. Nay, Jack was a killer in the name of
Love. That also has come to pass again.</p>

<p>&quot;It is the collapse of the love-ideal,&quot; said Richard to himself. &quot;I
suppose it means chaos and anarchy. Then there will have to be chaos and
anarchy: in the name of love and equality. The only thing one can stick
to is one's own isolate being, and the God in whom it is rooted. And the
only thing to look to is the God who fulfils one from the dark. And the
only thing to wait for is for men to find their aloneness and their God
in the darkness. Then one can meet as worshippers, in a sacred contact
in the dark.&quot;</p>

<p>Which being so, he proceeded, as ever, to try to disentangle himself
from the white octopus of love. Not that even now he dared quite deny
love. Love is perhaps an eternal part of life. But it is only a part.
And when it is treated as if it were a whole, it becomes a disease, a
vast white strangling octopus. All things are relative, and have their
sacredness in their true relation to all other things. And he felt the
light of love dying out of his eyes, in his heart, in his soul, and a
great, healing darkness taking its place, with a sweetness of
everlasting aloneness, and a stirring of dark blood-tenderness, and a
strange, soft iron of ruthlessness.</p>

<p>He fled away to be by himself as much as he could. His great relief was
the shore. Sometimes the dull exploding of the waves was too much for
him, like hammer-strokes on the head. He tried to flee inland. But the
shore was his great solace, for all that. The huge white rollers of the
Pacific breaking in a white, soft, snow-rushing wall, while the thin
spume flew back to sea like a combed mane, combed back by the strong,
cold land-wind.</p>

<p>The thud, the pulse of the waves: that was his nearest throb of emotion.
The other emotions seemed to abandon him. So suddenly, and so
completely, to abandon him. So it was when he got back from Sydney and,
in the night of moonlight, went down the low cliff to the sand.
Immediately the great rhythm and ringing of the breakers obliterated
every other feeling in his breast, and his soul was a moonlit hollow
with the waves striding home. Nothing else.</p>

<p>And in the morning the yellow sea faintly crinkled by the inrushing wind
from the land, and long, straight lines on the lacquered meadow, long,
straight lines that reared at last in green glass, then broke in snow,
and slushed softly up the sand. Sometimes the black skulking fin of a
shark. The water was very clear, very green, like bright green glass.
Another big fish with humpy sort of fins sticking up, and horror, in the
green water a big red mouth wide open. One day the fins of dolphins
near, it seemed almost over the sea edge. And then, suddenly, oh wonder,
they were caught up in the green wall of the rising water, and there for
a second they hung in the watery, bright green pane of the wave, five
big dark dolphins, a little crowd, with their sharp fins, and blunt
heads, a little sea-crowd in the thin, upreared sea. They flashed with a
sharp black motion as the great wave curled to break. They flashed
in-sea, flashed from the foamy horror of the land. And there they were,
black little school, away in the lacquered water, panting, Richard
imagined, with the excitement of the escape. Then one of the bold bucks
came back to try again, and he jumped clean out of the water, above the
wave, and kicked his heels as he dived in again.</p>

<p>The sea-birds were always wheeling: big, dark-backed birds like
mollyhawks and albatrosses with a great spread of wings: and the white
gleaming gannets, silvery as fish in the air. In they went, suddenly,
like bombs into the wave, spitting back the water. Then they slipped out
again, slipped out of the ocean with a sort of sly exultance.</p>

<p>And ships walked on the wall-crest of the sea, shedding black smoke. A
vast, hard, high sea, with tiny clouds like mirage islets away far, far
back, beyond the edge.</p>

<p>So Richard knew it, as he sat and worked on the verandah or sat at table
in the room and watched through the open door. But it was usually in the
afternoons he went down to it.</p>

<p>It was his afternoon occupation to go down to the sea's edge and wander
slowly on the firm sand just at the foam-edge. Sometimes the great waves
were turning like mill-wheels white all down the shore. Sometimes they
were smaller, more confused, as the current shifted. Sometimes his eyes
would be on the sand, watching the wrack, the big bladder-weed thrown
up, the little sponges like short clubs rolling in the wind, and once,
only, those fairy blue wind-bags like bags of rainbow with long blue
strings.</p>

<p>He knew all the places where the different shells were found, the white
shells and the black and the red, the big rainbow scoops and the
innumerable little black snails that lived on the flat rocks in the
little pools. Flat rocks ran out near the coal jetty, and between them
little creeks of black, round, crunchy coal-pebbles: sea-coal. Sometimes
there would be a couple of lazy, beach-combing men picking the biggest
pebbles and putting them into sacks.</p>

<p>On the flat rocks were pools of clear water, that many a time he stepped
into, because it was invisible. The coloured pebbles shone, the red
anemones pursed themselves up. There were hideous stumpy little fish
that darted swift as lightning - grey, with dark stripes. An urchin said
they were called toads. &quot;Yer can't eat 'em. Kill yer if y' do. Yer c'nt
eat black fish. See me catch one o' these toads!&quot; All this in a high
shrill voice above the waves. Richard admired the elfish self-possession
of the urchin, alone on the great shore all day, like a little wild
creature himself. But so the boys were: such wonderful little
self-possessed creatures. It was as if nobody was responsible for them,
so they learned to be responsible for themselves, like young elf
creatures, as soon as they were hatched. They liked Richard, and
patronised him in a friendly, half-shy way. But it was they who were the
responsible party, the grown-up they treated with a gentle, slightly
off-handed indulgence. It always amused friend Richard to see these
Australian children bearing the responsibility of their parents. &quot;He's
only a poor old Dad, you know. Young fellow like me's got to keep an eye
on him, see he's all right.&quot; That seemed to be the tone of the urchins
of ten and eleven. They were charming: much nicer than the older youths,
or the men.</p>

<p>The jetty straddled its huge grey timbers, like a great bridge, across
the sands and the flat rocks. Under the bridge it was rather dark,
between the great trunk-timbers. But here Richard found the best of the
flat, oval disc-shells with the whorl and the blue eye. By the bank hung
curtains of yellowish creeper, and a big, crimson-pink convolvulus
flowered in odd tones. An aloe sent up its tall spike, and died at its
base. A little bare grassy headland came out, and the flat rocks ran out
dark to sea, where the white waves prowled on three sides.</p>

<p>Richard would drift out this way, right into the sea, on a sunny
afternoon. On the flat rocks, all pocketed with limpid pools, the
sea-birds would sit with their backs to him, oblivious. Only an uneasy
black bird with a long neck, squatting among the gulls, would wriggle
his neck as the man approached. The gulls ran a few steps, and forgot
him. They were mostly real gulls, big and pure as grey pearl, suave and
still, with a mat gleam, like eggs of the foam in the sun on the rocks.
Slowly Richard strayed nearer. There were little browner birds huddled
and further, one big, dark-backed bird. There they all remained, like
opalescent whitish bubbles on the dark, flat, ragged wet-rock, in the
sun, in the sea sleep. The black bird rose like a duck, flying with its
neck outstretched, more timid than the rest. But it came back. Richard
drew nearer and nearer, within six yards of the sea-things. Beyond, the
everlasting low white wall of foam, rustling to the flat-rock. Only the
sea.</p>

<p>The black creature rose again, showing the white at his side, and flying
with a stretched-out neck, frightened-looking, like a duck. His mate
rose too. And then all the gulls, flying low in a sort of protest over
the foam-tips. Richard had it all to himself - the ever-unfurling water,
the ragged, flat, square-holed rocks, the fawn sands inland, the soft
sand-bank, the sere flat grass where ponies wandered, the low,
red-painted bungalows squatting under coral trees, the ridge of tall
wire-thin trees holding their plumes in tufts at the tips, the stalky
cabbage-palms beyond in the hollow, clustering, low, whitish zinc roofs
of bungalows, at the edge of the dark trees - then the trees in darkness
swooping up to the wall of the tors, that ran a waving skyline sagging
southwards. Scattered, low, frail-looking bungalows with whitish roofs,
and scattered dark trees among. A plume of smoke beyond, out of the
scarp front of trees. Near the sky, dark, old, aboriginal rocks. Then
again all the yellowish fore-front of the sea, yellow bare grass, the
homestead with leafless coral trees, the ponies above the sands, the
pale fawn foreshore, the sea, the floor of wet rock.</p>

<p>He had it all to himself. And there, with his hands in his pockets, he
drifted into indifference. The far-off, far-off, far-off indifference.
The world revolved and revolved and disappeared. Like a stone that has
fallen into the sea, his old life, the old meaning, fell, and rippled,
and there was vacancy, with the sea and the Australian shore in it.
Far-off, far-off, as if he had landed on another planet, as a man might
land after death. Leaving behind the body of care. Even the body of
desire. Shed. All that had meant so much to him, shed. All the old world
and self of care, the beautiful care as well as the weary care, shed
like a dead body. The landscape? - he cared not a thing about the
landscape. Love? - he was absolved from love, as if by a great pardon.
Humanity? - there was none. Thought? - fallen like a stone into the sea.
The great, the glamorous past? - worn thin, frail, like a frail,
translucent film of shell thrown up on the shore.</p>

<p>To be alone, mindless and memoryless between the sea, under the sombre
wall-front of Australia. To be alone with a long, wide shore and land,
heartless, soulless. As alone and as absent and as present as an
aboriginal dark on the sand in the sun. The strange falling-away of
everything. The cabbage-palms in the sea-wind were sere like old mops.
The jetty straddled motionless from the shore. A pony walked on the sand
snuffing the sea-weed.</p>

<p>The past all gone so frail and thin. &quot;What have I cared about, what have
I cared for? There is nothing to care about.&quot; Absolved from it all. The
soft, blue, humanless sky of Australia, the pale, white unwritten
atmosphere of Australia. Tabula rasa. The world a new leaf. And on the
new leaf, nothing. The white clarity of the Australian, fragile
atmosphere. Without a mark, without a record.</p>

<p>&quot;Why have I cared? I don't care. How strange it is here, to be soulless
and alone.&quot;</p>

<p>That was the perpetual refrain at the back of his mind. To be soulless
and alone, by the Southern Ocean, in Australia.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do I wrestle with my soul? I have no soul.&quot;</p>

<p>Clear as the air about him this truth possessed him.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do I talk of the soul? My soul is shed like a sheath. I am soulless
and alone, soulless and alone. That which is soulless is perforce
alone.&quot;</p>

<p>The sun was curving to the crest of the dark ridge. As soon as the sun
went behind the ridge, shadow fell on the shore, and a cold wind came,
he would go home. But he wanted the sun not to sink - he wanted the sun
to stand still, for fear it might turn back to the soulful world where
love is and the burden of bothering.</p>

<p>He saw something clutch in a pool. Crouching, he saw a horror - a
dark-grey, brown-striped octopus thing with two smallish, white beaks or
eyes living in a cranny of a rock in a pool. It stirred the denser
viscous pool of itself and unfurled a long dark arm through the water,
an arm studded with bright, orange-red studs or suckers. Then it curled
the arm in again, cuddling close. Perhaps a sort of dark shore octopus,
star-fish coloured amid its darkness. It was watching him as he
crouched. He dropped a snail-shell near it. It huddled closer and one of
the beak-like white things disappeared; or were they eyes? Heaven knows.
It eased out again, and from its dense jelly mass another thick arm
swayed out studded with the sea-orange studs. And he crouched and
watched, while the white water hissed nearer to drive him away.
Creatures of the sea! Creatures of the sea! The sea-water was round his
boots, he rose with his hands in his pockets, to wander away.</p>

<p>The sun went behind the coal-dark hill, though the waves still glowed
white-gold, and the sea was dark blue. But the shore had gone into
shadow, and the cold wind came at once, like a creature that was lying
in wait. The upper air seethed, seemed to hiss with light. But here was
shadow, cold like the arm of the dark octopus. And the moon already in
the sky.</p>

<p>Home again. But what was home? The fish has the vast ocean for home. And
man has timelessness and nowhere. &quot;I won't delude myself with the
fallacy of home,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;The four walls are a blanket I
wrap around in, in timelessness and nowhere, to go to sleep.&quot;</p>

<p>Back to Harriet, to tea. Harriet? Another bird like himself. If only she
wouldn't speak, talk, feel. The weary habit of talking and having
feelings. When a man has no soul he has no feelings to talk about. He
wants to be still. And &quot;meaning&quot; is the most meaningless of illusions.
An outworn garment.</p>

<p>Harriet and he? It was time they both agreed that nothing has any
meaning. Meaning is a dead letter when a man has no soul. And speech is
like a volley of dead leaves and dust, stifling the air. Human beings
should learn to make weird, wordless cries, like animals, and cast off
the clutter of words.</p>

<p>Old dust and dirt of corpses: words and feelings. The decomposed body of
the past whirling and choking us, language, love, and meaning. When a
man loses his soul he knows what a small, weary bit of clockwork it was.
Who dares to be soulless finds the new dimension of life.</p>

<p>Home, to tea. The clicking of the clock. Tic-tac! Tic-tac! The clock.
Home to tea. Just for clockwork's sake.</p>

<p>No home, no tea. Insouciant soullessness. Eternal indifference. Perhaps
it is only the great pause between carings. But it is only in this pause
that one finds the meaninglessness of meanings - like old husks which
speak dust. Only in this pause that one finds the meaninglessness of
meanings, and the other dimension, the reality of timelessness and
nowhere. Home to tea! Do you hear the clock tick? And yet there is
timelessness and nowhere. And the clock means nothing with its ticking.
And nothing is so meaningless as meanings.</p>

<p>Yet Richard meandered home to tea. For the sun had set, the sea of
evening light was going pale blue, fair as evening, faintly glazed with
yellow: the eastern sky was a glow of rose and smoke blue, a band beyond
the sea, while from the dark land-ridge under the western sky an
electric fierceness still rushed up past a small but vehement evening
star. Somewhere among it all the moon was lying.</p>

<p>He received another summons to go to Kangaroo. He didn't want to go. He
didn't want any more emotional stress, of any sort. He was sick of
having a soul that suffered or responded. He didn't want to respond any
more, or to suffer any more. Saunter blindly and obstinately through the
days.</p>

<p>But he set off. The wattle-blooms - the whitish, mealy ones - were aflower
in the bush, and at the top of huge poles of stems, big,
blackish-crimson buds and flowers, flowers of some sort, shot up out of
a clump of spear-leaves. The bush was in flower. The sky above was a
tender, virgin blue, the air was pale with clarity, the sun moved
strong, yet with a soft and cat-like motion through the heavens. It was
spring. But still the bush kept its sombreness along all the pellucid
ether: the eternally unlighted bush.</p>

<p>What was the good of caring? What was the point of caring? As he looked
at the silent, morning bush grey-still in the translucency of the day, a
voice spoke quite aloud in him. What was the good of caring, of
straining, of stressing? Not the slightest good. The vast lapse of time
here - and white men thrown in like snow into dusky wine, to melt away
and disappear, but to cool the fever of the dry continent.
Afterwards - afterwards - in the far-off, far-off afterwards, a different
sort of men might arise to a different sort of care. But as for
now - like snow in aboriginal wine one could float and deliciously melt
down, to nothingness, having no choice.</p>

<p>He knew that Kangaroo was worse. But he was startled to find him looking
a dead man. A long, cadaverous-yellow face, exactly the face of a dead
man, but with an animal's dark eyes. He did not move. But he watched
Richard come forward from the door. He did not give him his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;How are you?&quot; said Richard gently.</p>

<p>&quot;Dying.&quot; The one word from the discoloured lips.</p>

<p>Somers was silent, because he knew it was only too true. Kangaroo's dark
eyebrows above his motionless dark eyes were exactly like an animal that
sulks itself to death. His brow was just sulking to death, like an
animal.</p>

<p>Kangaroo glanced up at Somers with a rapid turn of the eyes. His body
was perfectly motionless.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you know I was dying?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;I was afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Afraid! You weren't afraid. You were glad. They're all glad.&quot; The voice
was weak, hissing in its sound. He seemed to speak to himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Nay, don't say that.&quot;</p>

<p>Kangaroo took no notice of the expostulation. He lay silent.</p>

<p>&quot;They don't want me,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;But why bother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm dying! I'm dying! I'm dying!&quot; suddenly shouted Kangaroo, with a
breaking and bellowing voice that nearly startled Richard out of his
skin. The nurse came running in, followed by Jack.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Cooley! Whatever is it?&quot; said the nurse.</p>

<p>He looked at her with long, slow, dark looks.</p>

<p>&quot;Statement of fact,&quot; he said, in his faint, husky voice.</p>

<p>&quot;DON'T excite yourself,&quot; pleaded the nurse. &quot;You KNOW it hurts you.
Don't think about it, don't. Hadn't you perhaps best be left alone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I'd better go,&quot; said Richard, rising.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to say good-bye to you,&quot; said Kangaroo faintly, looking up at
him with strange, beseeching eyes.</p>

<p>Richard, very pale at the gills, sat down again in the chair. Jack
watched them both, scowling.</p>

<p>&quot;Go out, nurse,&quot; whispered Kangaroo, touching her hand with his fingers,
in a loving kind of motion. &quot;I'm all right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Mr. Cooley, DON'T fret, DON'T,&quot; she pleaded.</p>

<p>He watched her with dark, subtle, equivocal eyes, then glanced at the
door. She went, obedient, and Jack followed her.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye, Lovat!&quot; said Kangaroo in a whisper, turning his face to
Somers and reaching out his hand. Richard took the clammy, feeble hand.
He did not speak. His lips were closed firmly, his face pale and proud
looking. He looked back into Kangaroo's eyes, unconscious of what he
saw. He was only isolated again in endurance. Grief, torture, shame,
seethed low down in him. But his breast and shoulders and face were hard
as if turned to rock. He had no choice.</p>

<p>&quot;You've killed me. You've killed me, Lovat!&quot; whispered Kangaroo. &quot;Say
good-bye to me. Say you love me now you've done it, and I won't hate you
for it.&quot; The voice was weak and tense.</p>

<p>&quot;But <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> haven't killed you, Kangaroo. I wouldn't be here holding your
hand if I had. I'm only so sorry some other villain did such a thing.&quot;
Richard spoke very gently, like a woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, you've killed me,&quot; whispered Kangaroo hoarsely.</p>

<p>Richard's face went colder, and he tried to disengage his hand. But the
dying man clasped him with suddenly strong fingers.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; he said fiercely. &quot;Don't leave me now. You must stay with me.
I shan't be long - and I need you to be there.&quot;</p>

<p>There ensued a long silence. The corpse - for such it seemed - lay
immobile and obstinate. Yet it did not relax into death. And Richard
could not go, for it held him. He sat with his wrist clasped by the
clammy thin fingers, and he could not go. Then again the dark,
mysterious, animal eyes turned up to his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Say you love me, Lovat,&quot; came the hoarse, penetrating whisper, seeming
even more audible than a loud sound.</p>

<p>And again Lovat's face tightened with torture.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't understand what you mean,&quot; he said with his lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Say you love me.&quot; The pleading, penetrating whisper seemed to sound
inside Somers' brain. He opened his mouth to say it. The sound 'I - '
came out. Then he turned his face aside and remained open-mouthed,
blank.</p>

<p>Kangaroo's fingers were clutching his wrist, the corpse-face was eagerly
upturned to his. Somers was brought to by a sudden convulsive gripping
of the fingers around his wrist. He looked down. And when he saw the
eager, alert face, yellow, long, Jewish, and somehow ghoulish, he knew
he could not say it. He didn't love Kangaroo.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;I can't say it.&quot;</p>

<p>The sharpened face, that seemed to be leaping up to him, or leaping up
at him, like some snake striking, now seemed to sink back and go
indistinct. Only the eyes smouldered low down out of the vague yellow
mass of the face. The fingers slackened, and Richard managed to withdraw
his wrist. There was an eternity of grey silence. And for a long time
Kangaroo's yellow face seemed sunk half visible under a shadow, as a
dusky cuttle-fish under a pool, deep down. Then slowly, slowly it came
to the surface again, and Richard braced his nerves.</p>

<p>&quot;You are a little man, a little man, to have come and killed me,&quot; came
the terrible, pathetic whisper. But Richard was afraid of the face, so
he turned aside. He thought in his mind: &quot;I haven't killed him at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What shall you do next?&quot; came the whisper. And slowly, like a dying
snake rearing itself, the face reared itself from the bed to look at
Somers, who sat with his face averted.</p>

<p>&quot;I am going away. I am leaving Australia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Next month.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To San Francisco.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;America! America!&quot; came the hissing whisper. &quot;They'll kill you in
America.&quot; And the head sank back on the pillow.</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Going to America! Going to America! After he's killed me here,&quot; came
the whispered moan.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I haven't killed you. I'm only awfully sorry - .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have! You have!&quot; shouted Kangaroo, in the loud, bellowing voice
that frightened Richard nearly out of the window. &quot;Don't lie, you
have - .&quot;</p>

<p>The door opened swiftly and Jack, very stern-faced, entered. He looked
at Somers in anger and contempt, then went to the bedside. The nurse
hovered in the doorway with an anxious face.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, 'Roo?&quot; said Jack, in a voice of infinite tenderness, that
made Somers shiver inside his skin. &quot;What's wrong, Chief, what's wrong,
dear old man?&quot;</p>

<p>Kangaroo turned his face and looked at Somers vindictively.</p>

<p>&quot;That man's killed me,&quot; he said in a distinct voice.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I think you're wrong there, old man,&quot; said Jack. &quot;Mr. Somers has
never done anything like that. Let me give you a morphia injection, to
ease you, won't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Leave me alone.&quot; Then, in a fretful vague voice: &quot;I wanted him to love
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure he loves you, 'Roo - sure he does.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ask him.&quot;</p>

<p>Jack looked at Richard and made him a sharp, angry sign with his brows,
as if bidding him comply.</p>

<p>&quot;You love our one-and-only Kangaroo all right, don't you, Mr. Somers?&quot;
he said in a manly, take-it-for-granted voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I have an immense regard for him,&quot; muttered Richard.</p>

<p>&quot;Regard! I should think so. We've got more than regard. I love the
man - love him - love him I do. Don't I, 'Roo?&quot;</p>

<p>But Kangaroo had sunk down, and his face had gone small, he was
oblivious again.</p>

<p>&quot;I want nurse,&quot; he whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, all right,&quot; said Jack, rising from bending over the sick man.
Somers had already gone to the door. The nurse entered, and the two men
found themselves in the dark passage.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall have to be coming along, Mr. Somers, if you'll wait a minute,&quot;
said Jack.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll wait outside,&quot; said Somers. And he went out and down to the
street, into the sun, where people were moving about. They were like
pasteboard figures shifting on a flat light.</p>

<p>After a few minutes Jack joined him.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor 'Roo, it's a question of days now,&quot; said Jack.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hard lines, you know, when a man's in his prime and just ready to enter
into his own. Bitter hard lines.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's why I think you were a bit hard on him. I DO love him myself, so
I can say so without exaggerating the fact. But if I hated the poor man
like hell, and saw him lying there in that state - why, I'd swear on
red-hot iron I loved him, I would. A man like that - a big, grand man, as
great a hero as ever lived. If a man can't speak two words of pity for a
man in his state, why, I think there's something wrong with that man.
Sorry to have to say it. But if Old Harry himself had lain there like
that and asked me to say I loved him I'd have done it. Heart-breaking,
it was. But I suppose some folks is stingy about sixpence, and others is
stingy about saying two words that would give another poor devil his
peace of mind.&quot;</p>

<p>Richard walked on in angry silence. He hated being condemned in this
free-and-easy, rough-and-ready fashion.</p>

<p>&quot;But I suppose chaps from the old country are more careful of what they
say - might give themselves away or something of that. We're different
over here. Kick yourself over the cliff like an old can if a mate's in
trouble and needs a helping hand, or a bit of sympathy. That's us. But I
suppose being brought up in the old country, where everybody's
frightened that somebody else is going to take advantage of him, makes
you more careful. So you're leaving Australia, are you? Mrs. Somers want
to go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so.&quot; Not very emphatically, perhaps.</p>

<p>&quot;Wouldn't want to if you didn't, so to speak? Oh, Mrs. Somers is all
right. She's a fine woman, she is. I suppose I ought to say lady, but I
prefer a woman, myself, to a lady, any day. And Mrs. Somers is a woman
all over - she is that. I'm sorry for my own sake and Vicky's sake that
she's going. I'm sorry for Australia's sake. A woman like that ought to
stop in a new country like this and breed sons for us. That's what we
want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose if she wanted to stop and breed sons she would,&quot; said Richard
coldly.</p>

<p>&quot;They'd have to be your sons, that's the trouble, old man. And how's she
going to manage that if you're giving us the go-by?&quot;</p>

<p>Richard spent the afternoon going round to the Customs House and to the
American Consulate with his passport, and visiting the shipping office
to get a plan of the boat. He went swiftly from place to place. There
were no difficulties: only both the Customs House and the Consulate
wanted photographs and Harriet's own signature. She would have to come
up personally.</p>

<p>He wanted to go now. He wanted to go quickly. But it was no good, he
could not get off for another month, so he must preserve his soul in
patience.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Richard to himself, thinking of Kangaroo. &quot;I don't love
him - I detest him. He can die. I'm glad he is dying. And I don't like
Jack either. Not a bit. In fact I like nobody. I love nobody and I like
nobody, and there's the end of it, as far as I'm concerned. And if I go
round 'loving' anybody else, or even 'liking' them, I deserve a kick in
the guts like Kangaroo.&quot;</p>

<p>And yet, when he went over to the Zoo, on the other side of the
harbour - and the warm sun shone on the rocks and the mimosa bloom, and
he saw the animals, the tenderness came back. A girl he had met, a
steamer-acquaintance, had given him a packet of little extra-strong
peppermint sweets. The animals liked them. The grizzly bear caught them
and ate them with excitement, panting after the hotness of the strong
peppermint, and opening his mouth wide, wide, for more. And one golden
brown old-man kangaroo, with his great earth-cleaving tail and his
little hanging hands, hopped up to the fence and lifted his sensitive
nose quivering, and gently nibbled the sweet between Richard's fingers.
So gently, so determinedly nibbled the sweet, but never hurting the
fingers that held it. And looking up with the big, prominent Australian
eyes, so aged in consciousness, with a fathomless, dark, fern-age
gentleness and gloom. The female wouldn't come near to eat. She only sat
up and watched, and her little one hung its tiny fawn's head and one
long ear and one fore-leg out of her pouch, in the middle of her soft,
big, grey body.</p>

<p>Such a married couple! Two kangaroos. And the blood in Richard's veins
all gone dark with a sort of sad tenderness. The gentle kangaroos, with
their weight in heavy blood on the ground, in their great tail! It
wasn't love he felt for them, but a dark, animal tenderness, and another
sort of consciousness, deeper than human.</p>

<p>It was a time of full moon. The moon rose about eight. She was so
strong, so exciting, that Richard went out at nine o'clock down to the
shore. The night was full of moonlight as a mother-of-pearl. He imagined
it had a warmth in it towards the moon, a moon-heat. The light on the
waves was like liquid radium swinging and slipping. Like radium, the
mystic virtue of vivid decomposition, liquid-gushing lucidity.</p>

<p>The sea too was very full. It was nearly high tide, the waves were
rolling very tall, with light like a menace on the nape of their necks
as they bent, so brilliant. Then, when they fell, the fore-flush in a
great soft swing with incredible speed up the shore, on the darkness
soft-lighted with moon, like a rush of white serpents, then slipping
back with a hiss that fell into silence for a second, leaving the sand
of granulated silver.</p>

<p>It was the huge rocking of this flat, hollow-foreflush moon - dim in its
hollow, that was the night to Richard. &quot;This is the night and the moon,&quot;
he said to himself. Incredibly swift and far the flat rush flew at him,
with foam like the hissing, open mouths of snakes. In the nearness a
wave broke white and high. Then, ugh! across the intervening gulf the
great lurch and swish, as the snakes rushed forward, in a hollow frost
hissing at his boots. Then failed to bite, fell back hissing softly,
leaving the belly of the sands granulated silver.</p>

<p>A huge but a cold passion swinging back and forth. Great waves of radium
swooping with a down-curve and rushing up the shore. Then calling
themselves back again, retreating to the mass. Then rushing with
venomous radium-burning speed into the body of the land. Then recoiling
with a low swish, leaving the flushed sand naked.</p>

<p>That was the night. Rocking with cold, radium-burning passion, swinging
and flinging itself with venomous desire. That was Richard, too, a bit
of human wispiness in thin overcoat and thick boots. The shore was
deserted all the way. Only, when he came past the creek on the sands,
rough, wild ponies looking at him, dark figures in the moon light
lifting their heads from the invisible grass of the sand, and waiting
for him to come near. When he came and talked to them they were
reassured, and put their noses down to the grass to eat a bit more in
the moon-dusk, glad a man was there.</p>

<p>Richard rocking with the radium-urgent passion of the night: the huge,
desirous swing, the call clamour, the low hiss of retreat. The call,
call! And the answerer. Where was his answerer? There was no living
answerer. No dark-bodied, warm-bodied answerer. He knew that when he had
spoken a word to the night-half-hidden ponies with their fluffy legs. No
animate answer this time. The radium-rocking, wave-knocking night his
call and his answer both. This God without feet or knees or face. This
sluicing, knocking, urging night, heaving like a woman with unspeakable
desire, but no woman, no thighs or breast, no body. The moon, the
concave mother-of-pearl of night, the great radium-swinging, and his
little self. The call and the answer, without intermediary. Non-human
gods, non-human human being.</p>
