<p>Wratislaw left betimes the next morning, and a long day faced
Lewis with every hour clamouring for a decision. George would
be back by noon, and before his return he must seek quiet and
the chances of reflection. He was happy with a miserable fluctuating
happiness. Of a sudden his horizon was enlarged, but as he gazed
it seemed to narrow again. His mind was still unplumbed; somewhere
in its depths might lie the shrinking and unwillingness which
would bind him to the dreary present.</p>

<p>He went out to the autumn hills and sought the ridge which runs
for miles on the lip of the glen. It was a grey day, with snow
waiting in cloud-banks in the north sky and a thin wind whistling
through the pines. The scene matched his humour. He was in love
for the moment with the stony and stormy in life. He hungered
morbidly for ill-fortune, something to stamp out the ease in his
soul, and weld him into the form of a man.</p>

<p>He had got his chance and the rest lay with himself. It was a
chance of high adventure, a great mission, a limitless future.
At the thought the old fever began to rise in his blood. The hot,
clear smell of rock and sand, the brown depths of the waters,
the far white peaks running up among the stars, all spoke to him
with the long-remembered call. Once more he should taste life,
and, alert in mind and body, hold up his chin among his fellows.
It would be a contest of wits, and for all his cowardice this
was not the contest he shrank from.</p>

<p>And then there came back on him, like a flood, the dumb misery
of incompetence which had weighed on heart and brain. The hatred
of the whole struggling, sordid crew, all the cant and ugliness
and ignorance of a mad world, his weakness in the face of it,
his fall from common virtue, his nerveless indolence&mdash;all stung
him like needle points, till he cried out in agony. Anything to
deliver his soul from such a bondage, and in his extreme bitterness
his mind closed with Wratislaw's offer.</p>

<p>He felt&mdash;and it is a proof of his weakness&mdash;a certain nameless
feeling of content when he had once forced himself into the resolution.
Now at least he had found a helm and a port to strain to. As his
fancy dwelt upon the mission and drew airy pictures of the land,
he found to his delight a boyish enthusiasm arising. Old simple
pleasures seemed for the moment dear. There was a zest for toils
and discomforts, a tolerance of failure, which had been aforetime
his chief traveller's heritage.</p>

<p>And then as he came to the ridge where the road passes from Glenavelin
to Glen Adler, he stopped as in duty bound to look at the famous
prospect. You stand at the shedding of two streams; behind, the
green and woodland spaces of the pastoral Avelin; at the feet,
a land of stones and dwarf junipers and naked rifts in the hills,
with white-falling waters and dark shadows even at midday. And
then, beyond and afar, the lines of hill-land crowd upon each
other till the eye is lost in a mystery of grey rock and brown
heather and single bald peaks rising sentinel-like in the waste.
The grey heavens lent a chill eeriness to the dim grey distances;
the sharp winds, the forerunners of snow, blew over the moors
like blasts from a primeval night.</p>

<p>By an odd vagary of temper the love of these bleak hills blazed
up fiercely in his heart. Never before had he felt so keenly the
nameless glamour of his own heritage. He had not been back six
months and yet he had come to accept all things as matters of
course, the beauty of the place, its sport, its memories. Rarely
had he felt that intimate joy in it which lies at the bottom of
all true souls. There is a sentiment which old poets have made
into songs and called the "Lilt of the Heather," and which is
knit closer to man's heart than love of wife or kin or his own
fair fortune. It had not come to him in the time of the hills'
glory, but now on the brink of winter the far-off melancholy of
the place and its infinite fascination seemed to clutch at his
heart-strings. It was his own land, the place of his fathers;
and now he must sever himself from it and carry only a barren
memory.</p>

<p>And yet he felt no melancholy. Rather it was the immortal gaiety
of the wanderer, to whom the homeland is dearest as a memory,
who pitches his camp by waters of Babylon and yet as ever the
old word on his lip, the old song in his ear, and the kindly picture
in his heart. Strange that it is the little races who wander farthest
and yet have the eternal home-sickness! And yet not strange, for
to the little peoples, their land, bare and uncouth and unfriendly
for the needs of life, must be more the ideal, the dream, than
the satisfaction. The lush countries give corn and wine for their
folks, the little bare places afford no more than a spiritual
heritage. Yet spiritual it is, and for two men who in the moment
of their extremity will think on meadow, woodland, or placid village,
a score will figure the windy hill, the grey lochan, and the mournful
sea.</p>

<p>For the moment he felt a self-pity which he cast from him. To
this degradation at least he should never come. But as the thought
of Alice came up ever and again, his longing for her seemed to
be changed from hot pain to a chastened regret. The red hearth-fire
was no more in his fancy. The hunger for domesticity had gone,
and the girl was now less the wife he had desired than the dream
of love he had vainly followed. As he came back across the moors,
for the first time for weeks his jealous love left him at peace.
His had been a fanciful Sylvia, "holy, fair, and wise"; and what
if mortal Sylvia were unkind, there was yet comfort in this elusive
lady of his memories.</p>

<p>He found George at the end of a second breakfast, a very ruddy,
happy young man hunting high and low for a lost tobacco-jar.</p>

<p>"Oh, first-class," he said in answer to Lewis's question. "Out
and out the best day's shooting I've had in my life. You were
an ass not to come, you know. A lot of your friends there, tremendously
disappointed too, and entrusted me with a lot of messages for
you which I have forgotten."</p>

<p>His companion's high spirits infected Lewis and he fell into
cheery gossip. Then he could contain the news no more.</p>

<p>"I had Tommy up last night on a flying visit. He says that Beauregard
wants me to go out to Kashmir again. There has been some threatening
of a row up there, and he thinks that as I know the place I might
be able to get good information."</p>

<p>"Official?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Practically, yes; but in theory it's quite off my own bat, and
they are good enough to tell me that they will not acknowledge
responsibility. However, it's a great chance and I am going."</p>

<p>"Good," said the other, and his face and voice had settled into
gravity. "Pretty fair sport up in those parts, isn't there?"</p>

<p>"Pretty fair? it's about the best in the world. Your ordinary
man who goes the grand tour comes home raving about the sport
in the Himalayan foothills, and it's not to be named with this."</p>

<p>"Good chance too of a first-rate row, isn't there? Natives troublesome,
and Russia near, and that sort of thing?" George's manner showed
a growing enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"A rather good chance. It is about that I'm going, you know."</p>

<p>"Then if you don't mind, I am coming with you."</p>

<p>Lewis stared, incredulous.</p>

<p>"It's quite true. I am serious enough. I am doing nothing at
the Bar, and I want to travel, proper travelling, where you are
not coddled with railways and hotels."</p>

<p>"But it's hideously risky, and probably very arduous and thankless.
You will tire of it in a week."</p>

<p>"I won't," said George, "and in any case I'll make my book for
that. You must let me come, Lewie. I simply couldn't stand your
going off alone."</p>

<p>"But I may have to leave you. There are places where one can
go when two can't."</p>

<p>"When you come to that sort of place I'll stay behind. I'll be
quite under your orders."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate take some time to think over it."</p>

<p>"Bless you, I don't want time to think over it," cried George.
"I know my own mind. It's the chance I've been waiting on for
years."</p>

<p>"Thanks tremendously then, my dear chap," said Lewis, very ill
at ease. "It's very good of you. I must wire at once to Tommy."</p>

<p>"I'll take it down, if you like. I want to try that new mare
of yours in the dog-cart."</p>

<p>When his host had left the room George forgot to light his pipe,
but walked instead to the window and whistled solemnly. "Poor
old man," he said softly to himself, "it had to come to this,
but I'm hanged if he doesn't take it like a Trojan." And he added
certain striking comments on the ways of womankind and the afflictions
of life, which, being expressed in Mr. Winterham's curious phraseology,
need not be set down.</p>

<p>Alice had gone out after lunch to walk to Gledsmuir, seeking
in the bitter cold and the dawning storm the freshness which comes
from conflict. All the way down the glen the north wind had stung
her cheeks to crimson and blown stray curls about her ears; but
when she left the little market-place to return she found a fine
snow powdering the earth, and a haze creeping over the hills which
threatened storm. A mile of the weather delighted her, but after
that she grew weary. When the fall thickened she sought the shelter
of a way-side cottage, with the purpose of either sending to Glenavelin
for a carriage or waiting for the off-chance of a farmer's gig.</p>

<p>By four o'clock the snow showed no sign of clearing, but fell
in the same steady, noiseless drift. The mistress of the place
made the girl tea and dispatched her son to Glenavelin. But the
errand would take time, for the boy was small, and Alice, ever
impatient, stood drumming on the panes, watching the dreary weather
with a dreary heart. The goodwife was standing at the door on
the look-out for a passing gig, and her cry brought the girl to
attention.</p>

<p>"I see a machine comin'! I think it's the Etterick dowg-cairt.
Ye'll get a drive in it."</p>

<p>Alice had gone to the door, and lo! through the thick fall a
dog-cart came into view driven by a tall young man. He recognized
her at once, and drew up.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Miss Wishart! Storm-stayed? Can I help you?"</p>

<p>The girl looked distrustfully at the very restless horse and
he caught her diffidence.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid. 'What I don't know about 'oases ain't worth
knowin','" he quoted with a laugh; and leaning forward he prepared
to assist her to mount.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to accept, and the next minute she
found herself in the high seat beside him. Her wraps, sufficient
for walking, were scarcely sufficient for a snowy drive, and this,
to his credit, the young man saw. He unbuttoned his tweed shooting-cape,
and gravely put it round her. A curious dainty figure she made
with her face all bright with wind, framed in the great grey cloak.</p>

<p>The horse jibbed for a second and then swung along the wild road
with the vigorous ease of good blood skilfully handled. George
was puzzling his brain all the while as to how he should tell
his companion something which she ought to know. The strong drift
and the turns of the road claimed much of his attention, so it
is possible that he blurted out his news somewhat baldly.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Miss Wishart, that Lewis Haystoun and I are going
off next week? Abroad, you know."</p>

<p>The girl, who had been enjoying the ecstasy of swift motion through
the bitter weather, glanced up at him with pain in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Where?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To the Indian frontier. We are going to be special unpaid unofficial
members of the Intelligence Department."</p>

<p>She asked the old, timid woman's question about danger.</p>

<p>"It's where Lewis was before. Only, you see, things have got
into a mess thereabouts, and the Foreign Office has asked him
to go out again. By the by, you mustn't tell any one about this,
for it's in strict confidence."</p>

<p>The words were meaningless, and yet they sent a pang through
her heart. Had he no guess at her inmost feelings? Could he think
that she would talk to Mr. Stocks of a thing which was bound up
for her with all the sorrow and ecstasy of life?</p>

<p>He looked down and saw that her face had paled and that her mouth
was drawn with some emotion. A sudden gleam of light seemed to
break in upon him.</p>

<p>"Are you sorry?" he asked half-unwittingly.</p>

<p>For answer the girl turned her tragic eyes upon him, tried to
speak, and faltered. He cursed himself for a fool and a brute,
and whipped up an already over-active horse, till it was all but
unmanageable. It was a wise move, for it absorbed his attention
and gave the poor child at his side a chance to recover her composure.</p>

<p>They came to Glenavelin gates and George turned in. "I had better
drive you to the door, in this charming weather," he said. The
sight of the pale little face had moved him to deep pity. He cursed
his blindness, the blindness of a whole world of fools, and at
the same time, with the impotence of the honest man, he could
only wait and be silent.</p>

<p>At the door he stopped to unbutton his cape from her neck, and
even in his nervousness he felt the trembling of her body. She
spoke rapidly and painfully.</p>

<p>"I want you to take a message from me to&mdash;to &mdash;Lewis. Tell
him I must see him. Tell him to come to the Midburn foot, to-morrow
in the afternoon. Oh, I am ashamed to ask you, but you must tell
him." And then without thanks or good-bye she fled into the house.</p>
