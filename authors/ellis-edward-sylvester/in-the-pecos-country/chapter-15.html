<p>It seemed that nothing could be more favorable for the attempt
to escape. There was Fred seated upon the back of a mustang. His
copper colored captors were some distance away at the side of
the ravine, while the only Indian in sight was a dozen feet ahead
with his back toward him. True, there was the risk of being shot,
but he felt that he did not deserve safety unless he was willing
to run that or any risk.</p>

<p>There was a loose rein hanging on the neck of the mustang. Fred
gently pulled it and the beast stopped. He was walking so quietly
that his hoofs made scarcely any sound in falling upon the flinty
surface, and the Indian, from some cause or other, failed to notice
the cessation of sound until the distance between them had about
doubled.</p>

<p>At that instant, the redskin turned his head as quick as lightning.
Fred, who had been washing for that identical movement, whirled
the steed about and started him back in the ravine at full gallop,
the brute responding gallantly to the sudden demand made upon
him.</p>

<p>The fugitive was expecting a shot from the rifle in the hand
of the Apache, and he threw himself forward upon the horse, so
as to make the target as difficult to hit as possible. But the
Indian did not fire, not only on account of the risk to his favorite
mustang, but because it would have been certain to disarrange
the reconnoissance upon which Waukko and his companions were engaged.</p>

<p>But the red-skin did not stand in stupid helplessness. A glance
told him everything, and, running with extraordinary swiftness
to the nearest mustang, he vaulted upon his back and started in
pursuit, putting his animal upon the jump from the first. The
few seconds' unavoidable delay gave the young fugitive something
like a hundred yards start, an advantage which he used every effort
to increase, and which, for a brief spell, he succeeded in doing.</p>

<p>Fred's object was to avoid a regular chase, for he dreaded that
in such case the superior knowledge of the country possessed by
the Indian would enable him to outwit him at every turn. Night
was close at hand, and, if he could dodge the red-skin until darkness,
the lad was confident of escaping him altogether.</p>

<p>For a short distance, the ravine continued in almost a straight
line, and then it turned at a sharp angle. Without attempting
to guide the mustang in the least, Fred kept himself thrown forward,
with his arms about his neck, while he hammered his sides with
his heels, spoke sharply to him, and did everything he could to
urge him to the highest possible rate of speed. The animal whirled
about the corner, and, with his neck extended, went down the ravine
with almost incredible swiftness&mdash;a speed which was steadily drawing
him away from his pursuer, and which would have carried him beyond
his reach in a brief time, but for a singular and altogether unexpected
check.</p>

<p>The pursuing red-skin saw his charge quietly slipping from his
grasp, and he must have viewed the wonderful speed of his favorite
mustang, under the circumstances, with mixed emotions. At any
rate, it took him but a short time to see that in a stern chase
he had no chance of coming up with his own animal, and so he commanded
him to halt. This was done by a peculiar, tremulous whooping sound,
which he had used scores of times to summon his animal to him,
and which had never failed. Nor did it fail now.</p>

<p>Fred was careering along at this amazing speed, congratulating
himself meanwhile upon his cleverness, when the brute checked
himself so suddenly that the rider narrowly escaped being pitched
over his head. He jerked the bit, and pounded his heels against
his ribs, but it was of no avail. The horse had pricked up his
ears, neighed, and was looking back, with very much the appearance
of an animal that was in a mental muddle.</p>

<p>The Indian saw it, and repeated the signal. Thereupon the mustang
wheeled and started backward at a gallop, directly toward his
master.</p>

<p>"If that's your idea, I'm not going with you!" gasped the lad,
who slipped off his back, as nimbly as a monkey, and made a dash
for the side of the ravine, without any clear idea of where he
was going.</p>

<p>It seemed that there was no possible escape for the lad, for
the Indian was but a short distance behind him, and was twice
as fleet of foot as he; but one of those fortunate interferences
which seem to be in their nature like special Providences occurred
at this juncture.</p>

<p>The flight and pursuit of Fred Munson took place at a critical
period in the affairs of all parties and so mixed up the business
that it was thrown entirely out of gear and almost into inextricable
confusion. It seemed that there was a party of Kiowas in hiding,
and awaiting the chance to open fire upon the approaching Apaches.
The sly scamps saw every movement of the warriors, and it looked
as if the flies were about walking into their trap when the unexpected
by-play occurred.</p>

<p>There must have been all of half a dozen Kiowas, enough to extinguish
the Apaches, and when Fred Munson started in his flight, two of
the Indians hurried down the ravine for the purpose of taking
a hand in the business. They unavoidably fell behind in such a
trial of speed, but when they saw the Apache about to reach out
his hand to grasp the fugitive, two shots were fired almost simultaneously
at him.</p>

<p>They were intended to kill, too, for the Kiowas, who were actuated
by no love for the despairing white boy, felt that they could
afford to give him this temporary respite. They were certain of
their own ability to step in and pluck the prize at the very moment
it might seem to be beyond their reach. Rather curiously, however,
neither of the shots did what was intended. One of them missed
the Apache altogether, and the other only slightly wounded him.</p>

<p>As it was, however, the pursuing warrior was dumbfounded, and
he stopped as suddenly as if smitten by a bolt from heaven. Leaving
his mustang to look out for himself, he darted to the opposite
side of the ravine from that taken by the lad, for the purpose
of securing cover before a second volley could be fired.</p>

<p>Fred heard the report of the rifle-shots, and sup posed that
he was the target and that they had been fired by Waukko and his
companion. Instead of stopping to ascertain, he continued his
flight with all the desperation of combined hope and despair.</p>

<p>A few seconds sufficed to carry him across the ravine, and among
the rocks, boulders, and stunted growth. The panting fugitive
was rendered almost frantic by the thought that he was about to
elude the red-skin after all. As he bounded into cover, he cast
a terrified glance backward, to see how close to his heels was
his dreaded enemy.</p>

<p>Not an Indian was visible.</p>

<p>But although Fred failed to see anything of his enemies, he could
not but believe that they were somewhere in the immediate neighborhood,
and he did not relax his efforts in the slightest. Such strenuous
efforts speedily exhausted him, and after climbing, clambering,
and stumbling forward and upward for some twenty rods or so, he
tripped and pitched forward upon his face, where he lay panting,
and so weak that he could not rise. He was sure he heard the footsteps
of his pursuer but a short distance away, and the most that he
could do was to raise his head and glance furtively in the direction.
He had not the strength absolutely to rise to his feet and run
away.</p>

<p>Again and again he was confident that the Apache was close to
him, but still he did not become visible, and all this time Fred
was rapidly regaining his strength. In a very short time his rapid
breathing subsided, and he felt his old vigor and vitality creeping
back into his limbs. He was ready to spring to his feet again,
but he did not deem it best. It seemed to him that the warrior
had lost sight of him, and was looking about. If the boy, therefore,
should rise to his feet, he would be the more likely to be seen,
and if he remained where he was he was sure of being found.</p>

<p>He compromised the matter by crawling forward on his hands and
knees, listening and looking, and continually pausing to prevent
creeping into the arms of his enemies. All this time night was
approaching, and with the passage of each minute came a corresponding
rise in the hopes of the fugitive. Fred kept moving forward upon
his hands and knees, climbing higher and further away from the
point of danger.</p>

<p>Everything remained as silent as the tomb.</p>

<p>The Apache that Fred fancied was so close upon him was, in reality,
playing hide and seek with the Kiowas, a business which is generally
conducted in silence, unless the stillness be broken by the occasional
crack of the rifle, or the death-yell of one of the participants.
The footsteps which the boy fancied he heard were all in his imagination.
In fact, he was alone. No human eye saw him, or took cognizance
of his movements. For the present he was left to himself.</p>

<p>There was but One who held him in view and remembrance at this
critical juncture. To Him Fred appealed again and again to lead
him through the labyrinth of peril, and to permit him to return
in safety to his friends.</p>

<p>Still the boy picked his way along as does the frightened animal,
and still he failed to see or hear anything of his enemy. Meanwhile
the gloom deepened, and with the passage of every moment his heart
lightened, until he felt that for the time being, at least, his
safety was assured.</p>
