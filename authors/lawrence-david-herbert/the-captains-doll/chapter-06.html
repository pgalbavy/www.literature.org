<p>Captain Hepburn still called occasionally at the house for his
post.  The maid always put his letters in a certain place in the
hall, so that he should not have to climb the stairs.</p>

<p>Among his letters - that is to say, along with another letter, for
his correspondence was very meagre - he one day found an envelope
with a crest.  Inside this envelope two letters.</p>

<p>Dear Captain Hepburn,</p>

<p>I had the enclosed letter from Mrs Hepburn.  I don't intend her to
have the doll which is your portrait, so I shall not answer this
note.  Also I don't see why she should try to turn us out of the
town.  She talked to me after tea that day, and it seems she
believes that Mitchka is your lover.  I didn't say anything at all - 
except that it wasn't true.  But she needn't be afraid of me.  I
don't want you to trouble yourself.  But you may as well KNOW how
things are.</p>

<p>JOHANNA Z. R.</p>

<p>The other letter was on his wife's well-known heavy paper, and in
her well-known large, 'aristocratic' hand.</p>

<p>My dear Countess,</p>

<p>I wonder if there has been some mistake, or some misunderstanding.
Four days ago you said you would send round that DOLL we spoke of,
but I have seen no sign of it yet.  I thought of calling at the
studio, but did not wish to disturb the Baroness.  I should be very
much obliged if you could send the doll at once, as I do not feel
easy while it is out of my possession.  You may rely on having a
cheque by return.</p>

<p>Our old family friend, Major-General Barlow, called on me
yesterday, and we had a most interesting conversation on our
Tommies, and the protection of their morals here.  It seems we have
full power to send away any person or persons deemed undesirable,
with twenty-four hours' notice to leave.  But of course all this is
done as quietly and with the intention of causing as little scandal
as possible.</p>

<p>Please let me have the doll by tomorrow, and perhaps some hint as
to your future intentions.</p>

<p>With very best wishes from one who only seeks to be your friend.
Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p>EVANGELINE HEPBURN.</p>
