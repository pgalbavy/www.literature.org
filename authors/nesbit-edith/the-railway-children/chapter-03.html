<p>After the adventure of Peter's Coal-mine, it seemed well to the
children to keep away from the station - but they did not, they could
not, keep away from the railway.  They had lived all their lives in
a street where cabs and omnibuses rumbled by at all hours, and the
carts of butchers and bakers and candlestick makers (I never saw a
candlestick-maker's cart; did you?) might occur at any moment.  Here
in the deep silence of the sleeping country the only things that
went by were the trains.  They seemed to be all that was left to
link the children to the old life that had once been theirs.
Straight down the hill in front of Three Chimneys the daily passage
of their six feet began to mark a path across the crisp, short turf.
They began to know the hours when certain trains passed, and they
gave names to them.  The 9.15 up was called the Green Dragon.  The
10.7 down was the Worm of Wantley.  The midnight town express, whose
shrieking rush they sometimes woke from their dreams to hear, was
the Fearsome Fly-by-night.  Peter got up once, in chill starshine,
and, peeping at it through his curtains, named it on the spot.</p>

<p>It was by the Green Dragon that the old gentleman travelled.  He was
a very nice-looking old gentleman, and he looked as if he were nice,
too, which is not at all the same thing.  He had a fresh-coloured,
clean-shaven face and white hair, and he wore rather odd-shaped
collars and a top-hat that wasn't exactly the same kind as other
people's.  Of course the children didn't see all this at first.  In
fact the first thing they noticed about the old gentleman was his
hand.</p>

<p>It was one morning as they sat on the fence waiting for the Green
Dragon, which was three and a quarter minutes late by Peter's
Waterbury watch that he had had given him on his last birthday.</p>

<p>&quot;The Green Dragon's going where Father is,&quot; said Phyllis; &quot;if it
were a really real dragon, we could stop it and ask it to take our
love to Father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dragons don't carry people's love,&quot; said Peter; &quot;they'd be above
it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, they do, if you tame them thoroughly first.  They fetch and
carry like pet spaniels,&quot; said Phyllis, &quot;and feed out of your hand.
I wonder why Father never writes to us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mother says he's been too busy,&quot; said Bobbie; &quot;but he'll write
soon, she says.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I say,&quot; Phyllis suggested, &quot;let's all wave to the Green Dragon as
it goes by.  If it's a magic dragon, it'll understand and take our
loves to Father.  And if it isn't, three waves aren't much.  We
shall never miss them.&quot;</p>

<p>So when the Green Dragon tore shrieking out of the mouth of its dark
lair, which was the tunnel, all three children stood on the railing
and waved their pocket-handkerchiefs without stopping to think
whether they were clean handkerchiefs or the reverse.  They were, as
a matter of fact, very much the reverse.</p>

<p>And out of a first-class carriage a hand waved back.  A quite clean
hand.  It held a newspaper.  It was the old gentleman's hand.</p>

<p>After this it became the custom for waves to be exchanged between
the children and the 9.15.</p>

<p>And the children, especially the girls, liked to think that perhaps
the old gentleman knew Father, and would meet him 'in business,'
wherever that shady retreat might be, and tell him how his three
children stood on a rail far away in the green country and waved
their love to him every morning, wet or fine.</p>

<p>For they were now able to go out in all sorts of weather such as
they would never have been allowed to go out in when they lived in
their villa house.  This was Aunt Emma's doing, and the children
felt more and more that they had not been quite fair to this
unattractive aunt, when they found how useful were the long gaiters
and waterproof coats that they had laughed at her for buying for
them.</p>

<p>Mother, all this time, was very busy with her writing.  She used to
send off a good many long blue envelopes with stories in them - and
large envelopes of different sizes and colours used to come to her.
Sometimes she would sigh when she opened them and say: - </p>

<p>&quot;Another story come home to roost.  Oh, dear, Oh, dear!&quot; and then
the children would be very sorry.</p>

<p>But sometimes she would wave the envelope in the air and say: - 
&quot;Hooray, hooray.  Here's a sensible Editor.  He's taken my story and
this is the proof of it.&quot;</p>

<p>At first the children thought 'the Proof' meant the letter the
sensible Editor had written, but they presently got to know that the
proof was long slips of paper with the story printed on them.</p>

<p>Whenever an Editor was sensible there were buns for tea.</p>

<p>One day Peter was going down to the village to get buns to celebrate
the sensibleness of the Editor of the Children's Globe, when he met
the Station Master.</p>

<p>Peter felt very uncomfortable, for he had now had time to think over
the affair of the coal-mine.  He did not like to say &quot;Good morning&quot;
to the Station Master, as you usually do to anyone you meet on a
lonely road, because he had a hot feeling, which spread even to his
ears, that the Station Master might not care to speak to a person
who had stolen coals.  'Stolen' is a nasty word, but Peter felt it
was the right one.  So he looked down, and said Nothing.</p>

<p>It was the Station Master who said &quot;Good morning&quot; as he passed by.
And Peter answered, &quot;Good morning.&quot;  Then he thought: - </p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps he doesn't know who I am by daylight, or he wouldn't be so
polite.&quot;</p>

<p>And he did not like the feeling which thinking this gave him.  And
then before he knew what he was going to do he ran after the Station
Master, who stopped when he heard Peter's hasty boots crunching the
road, and coming up with him very breathless and with his ears now
quite magenta-coloured, he said: - </p>

<p>&quot;I don't want you to be polite to me if you don't know me when you
see me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?&quot; said the Station Master.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought perhaps you didn't know it was me that took the coals,&quot;
Peter went on, &quot;when you said 'Good morning.'  But it was, and I'm
sorry.  There.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; said the Station Master, &quot;I wasn't thinking anything at all
about the precious coals.  Let bygones be bygones.  And where were
you off to in such a hurry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going to buy buns for tea,&quot; said Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you were all so poor,&quot; said the Station Master.</p>

<p>&quot;So we are,&quot; said Peter, confidentially, &quot;but we always have three
pennyworth of halfpennies for tea whenever Mother sells a story or a
poem or anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said the Station Master, &quot;so your Mother writes stories, does
she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The beautifulest you ever read,&quot; said Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;You ought to be very proud to have such a clever Mother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Peter, &quot;but she used to play with us more before she had
to be so clever.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the Station Master, &quot;I must be getting along.  You give
us a look in at the Station whenever you feel so inclined.  And as
to coals, it's a word that - well - oh, no, we never mention it, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Peter.  &quot;I'm very glad it's all straightened out
between us.&quot;  And he went on across the canal bridge to the village
to get the buns, feeling more comfortable in his mind than he had
felt since the hand of the Station Master had fastened on his collar
that night among the coals.</p>

<p>Next day when they had sent the threefold wave of greeting to Father
by the Green Dragon, and the old gentleman had waved back as usual,
Peter proudly led the way to the station.</p>

<p>&quot;But ought we?&quot; said Bobbie.</p>

<p>&quot;After the coals, she means,&quot; Phyllis explained.</p>

<p>&quot;I met the Station Master yesterday,&quot; said Peter, in an offhand way,
and he pretended not to hear what Phyllis had said; &quot;he
expresspecially invited us to go down any time we liked.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After the coals?&quot; repeated Phyllis.  &quot;Stop a minute - my bootlace is
undone again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It always IS undone again,&quot; said Peter, &quot;and the Station Master was
more of a gentleman than you'll ever be, Phil - throwing coal at a
chap's head like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Phyllis did up her bootlace and went on in silence, but her
shoulders shook, and presently a fat tear fell off her nose and
splashed on the metal of the railway line.  Bobbie saw it.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, what's the matter, darling?&quot; she said, stopping short and
putting her arm round the heaving shoulders.</p>

<p>&quot;He called me un-un-ungentlemanly,&quot; sobbed Phyllis.  &quot;I didn't never
call him unladylike, not even when he tied my Clorinda to the
firewood bundle and burned her at the stake for a martyr.&quot;</p>

<p>Peter had indeed perpetrated this outrage a year or two before.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you began, you know,&quot; said Bobbie, honestly, &quot;about coals and
all that.  Don't you think you'd better both unsay everything since
the wave, and let honour be satisfied?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will if Peter will,&quot; said Phyllis, sniffling.</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Peter; &quot;honour is satisfied.  Here, use my hankie,
Phil, for goodness' sake, if you've lost yours as usual.  I wonder
what you do with them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You had my last one,&quot; said Phyllis, indignantly, &quot;to tie up the
rabbit-hutch door with.  But you're very ungrateful.  It's quite
right what it says in the poetry book about sharper than a serpent
it is to have a toothless child - but it means ungrateful when it
says toothless.  Miss Lowe told me so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Peter, impatiently, &quot;I'm sorry.  THERE!  Now will
you come on?&quot;</p>

<p>They reached the station and spent a joyous two hours with the
Porter.  He was a worthy man and seemed never tired of answering the
questions that begin with &quot;Why - &quot; which many people in higher ranks
of life often seem weary of.</p>

<p>He told them many things that they had not known before - as, for
instance, that the things that hook carriages together are called
couplings, and that the pipes like great serpents that hang over the
couplings are meant to stop the train with.</p>

<p>&quot;If you could get a holt of one o' them when the train is going and
pull 'em apart,&quot; said he, &quot;she'd stop dead off with a jerk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who's she?&quot; said Phyllis.</p>

<p>&quot;The train, of course,&quot; said the Porter.  After that the train was
never again 'It' to the children.</p>

<p>&quot;And you know the thing in the carriages where it says on it, 'Five
pounds' fine for improper use.'  If you was to improperly use that,
the train 'ud stop.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if you used it properly?&quot; said Roberta.</p>

<p>&quot;It 'ud stop just the same, I suppose,&quot; said he, &quot;but it isn't
proper use unless you're being murdered.  There was an old lady
once - someone kidded her on it was a refreshment-room bell, and she
used it improper, not being in danger of her life, though hungry,
and when the train stopped and the guard came along expecting to
find someone weltering in their last moments, she says, &quot;Oh, please,
Mister, I'll take a glass of stout and a bath bun,&quot; she says.  And
the train was seven minutes behind her time as it was.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did the guard say to the old lady?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> dunno,&quot; replied the Porter, &quot;but I lay she didn't forget it in
a hurry, whatever it was.&quot;</p>

<p>In such delightful conversation the time went by all too quickly.</p>

<p>The Station Master came out once or twice from that sacred inner
temple behind the place where the hole is that they sell you tickets
through, and was most jolly with them all.</p>

<p>&quot;Just as if coal had never been discovered,&quot; Phyllis whispered to
her sister.</p>

<p>He gave them each an orange, and promised to take them up into the
signal-box one of these days, when he wasn't so busy.</p>

<p>Several trains went through the station, and Peter noticed for the
first time that engines have numbers on them, like cabs.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the Porter, &quot;I knowed a young gent as used to take down
the numbers of every single one he seed; in a green note-book with
silver corners it was, owing to his father being very well-to-do in
the wholesale stationery.&quot;</p>

<p>Peter felt that he could take down numbers, too, even if he was not
the son of a wholesale stationer.  As he did not happen to have a
green leather note-book with silver corners, the Porter gave him a
yellow envelope and on it he noted: - </p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>379<br />
663<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>and felt that this was the beginning of what would be a most
interesting collection.</p>

<p>That night at tea he asked Mother if she had a green leather note-
book with silver corners.  She had not; but when she heard what he
wanted it for she gave him a little black one.</p>

<p>&quot;It has a few pages torn out,&quot; said she; &quot;but it will hold quite a
lot of numbers, and when it's full I'll give you another.  I'm so
glad you like the railway.  Only, please, you mustn't walk on the
line.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not if we face the way the train's coming?&quot; asked Peter, after a
gloomy pause, in which glances of despair were exchanged.</p>

<p>&quot;No - really not,&quot; said Mother.</p>

<p>Then Phyllis said, &quot;Mother, didn't YOU ever walk on the railway
lines when you were little?&quot;</p>

<p>Mother was an honest and honourable Mother, so she had to say,
&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; said Phyllis.</p>

<p>&quot;But, darlings, you don't know how fond I am of you.  What should I
do if you got hurt?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you fonder of us than Granny was of you when you were little?&quot;
Phyllis asked.  Bobbie made signs to her to stop, but Phyllis never
did see signs, no matter how plain they might be.</p>

<p>Mother did not answer for a minute.  She got up to put more water in
the teapot.</p>

<p>&quot;No one,&quot; she said at last, &quot;ever loved anyone more than my mother
loved me.&quot;</p>

<p>Then she was quiet again, and Bobbie kicked Phyllis hard under the
table, because Bobbie understood a little bit the thoughts that were
making Mother so quiet - the thoughts of the time when Mother was a
little girl and was all the world to HER mother.  It seems so easy
and natural to run to Mother when one is in trouble.  Bobbie
understood a little how people do not leave off running to their
mothers when they are in trouble even when they are grown up, and
she thought she knew a little what it must be to be sad, and have no
mother to run to any more.</p>

<p>So she kicked Phyllis, who said: - </p>

<p>&quot;What are you kicking me like that for, Bob?&quot;</p>

<p>And then Mother laughed a little and sighed and said: - </p>

<p>&quot;Very well, then.  Only let me be sure you do know which way the
trains come - and don't walk on the line near the tunnel or near
corners.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trains keep to the left like carriages,&quot; said Peter, &quot;so if we keep
to the right, we're bound to see them coming.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Mother, and I dare say you think that she ought
not to have said it.  But she remembered about when she was a little
girl herself, and she did say it - and neither her own children nor
you nor any other children in the world could ever understand
exactly what it cost her to do it.  Only some few of you, like
Bobbie, may understand a very little bit.</p>

<p>It was the very next day that Mother had to stay in bed because her
head ached so.  Her hands were burning hot, and she would not eat
anything, and her throat was very sore.</p>

<p>&quot;If I was you, Mum,&quot; said Mrs. Viney, &quot;I should take and send for
the doctor.  There's a lot of catchy complaints a-going about just
now.  My sister's eldest - she took a chill and it went to her
inside, two years ago come Christmas, and she's never been the same
gell since.&quot;</p>

<p>Mother wouldn't at first, but in the evening she felt so much worse
that Peter was sent to the house in the village that had three
laburnum trees by the gate, and on the gate a brass plate with W. W.
Forrest, M.D., on it.</p>

<p>W. W. Forrest, M.D., came at once.  He talked to Peter on the way
back.  He seemed a most charming and sensible man, interested in
railways, and rabbits, and really important things.</p>

<p>When he had seen Mother, he said it was influenza.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Lady Grave-airs,&quot; he said in the hall to Bobbie, &quot;I suppose
you'll want to be head-nurse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said she.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, I'll send down some medicine.  Keep up a good fire.
Have some strong beef tea made ready to give her as soon as the
fever goes down.  She can have grapes now, and beef essence - and
soda-water and milk, and you'd better get in a bottle of brandy.
The best brandy.  Cheap brandy is worse than poison.&quot;</p>

<p>She asked him to write it all down, and he did.</p>

<p>When Bobbie showed Mother the list he had written, Mother laughed.
It WAS a laugh, Bobbie decided, though it was rather odd and feeble.</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said Mother, laying in bed with eyes as bright as beads.
&quot;I can't afford all that rubbish.  Tell Mrs. Viney to boil two
pounds of scrag-end of the neck for your dinners to-morrow, and I
can have some of the broth.  Yes, I should like some more water now,
love.  And will you get a basin and sponge my hands?&quot;</p>

<p>Roberta obeyed.  When she had done everything she could to make
Mother less uncomfortable, she went down to the others.  Her cheeks
were very red, her lips set tight, and her eyes almost as bright as
Mother's.</p>

<p>She told them what the Doctor had said, and what Mother had said.</p>

<p>&quot;And now,&quot; said she, when she had told all, &quot;there's no one but us
to do anything, and we've got to do it.  I've got the shilling for
the mutton.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We can do without the beastly mutton,&quot; said Peter; &quot;bread and
butter will support life.  People have lived on less on desert
islands many a time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said his sister.  And Mrs. Viney was sent to the
village to get as much brandy and soda-water and beef tea as she
could buy for a shilling.</p>

<p>&quot;But even if we never have anything to eat at all,&quot; said Phyllis,
&quot;you can't get all those other things with our dinner money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Bobbie, frowning, &quot;we must find out some other way.  Now
THINK, everybody, just as hard as ever you can.&quot;</p>

<p>They did think.  And presently they talked.  And later, when Bobbie
had gone up to sit with Mother in case she wanted anything, the
other two were very busy with scissors and a white sheet, and a
paint brush, and the pot of Brunswick black that Mrs. Viney used for
grates and fenders.  They did not manage to do what they wished,
exactly, with the first sheet, so they took another out of the linen
cupboard.  It did not occur to them that they were spoiling good
sheets which cost good money.  They only knew that they were making
a good - but what they were making comes later.</p>

<p>Bobbie's bed had been moved into Mother's room, and several times in
the night she got up to mend the fire, and to give her mother milk
and soda-water.  Mother talked to herself a good deal, but it did
not seem to mean anything.  And once she woke up suddenly and called
out:  &quot;Mamma, mamma!&quot; and Bobbie knew she was calling for Granny,
and that she had forgotten that it was no use calling, because
Granny was dead.</p>

<p>In the early morning Bobbie heard her name and jumped out of bed and
ran to Mother's bedside.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh - ah, yes - I think I was asleep,&quot; said Mother.  &quot;My poor little
duck, how tired you'll be - I do hate to give you all this trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trouble!&quot; said Bobbie.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, don't cry, sweet,&quot; Mother said; &quot;I shall be all right in a day
or two.&quot;</p>

<p>And Bobbie said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and tried to smile.</p>

<p>When you are used to ten hours of solid sleep, to get up three or
four times in your sleep-time makes you feel as though you had been
up all night.  Bobbie felt quite stupid and her eyes were sore and
stiff, but she tidied the room, and arranged everything neatly
before the Doctor came.</p>

<p>This was at half-past eight.</p>

<p>&quot;Everything going on all right, little Nurse?&quot; he said at the front
door.  &quot;Did you get the brandy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've got the brandy,&quot; said Bobbie, &quot;in a little flat bottle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't see the grapes or the beef tea, though,&quot; said he.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Bobbie, firmly, &quot;but you will to-morrow.  And there's
some beef stewing in the oven for beef tea.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who told you to do that?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I noticed what Mother did when Phil had mumps.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right,&quot; said the Doctor.  &quot;Now you get your old woman to sit with
your mother, and then you eat a good breakfast, and go straight to
bed and sleep till dinner-time.  We can't afford to have the head-
nurse ill.&quot;</p>

<p>He was really quite a nice doctor.</p>

<p>When the 9.15 came out of the tunnel that morning the old gentleman
in the first-class carriage put down his newspaper, and got ready to
wave his hand to the three children on the fence.  But this morning
there were not three.  There was only one.  And that was Peter.</p>

<p>Peter was not on the railings either, as usual.  He was standing in
front of them in an attitude like that of a show-man showing off the
animals in a menagerie, or of the kind clergyman when he points with
a wand at the 'Scenes from Palestine,' when there is a magic-lantern
and he is explaining it.</p>

<p>Peter was pointing, too.  And what he was pointing at was a large
white sheet nailed against the fence.  On the sheet there were thick
black letters more than a foot long.</p>

<p>Some of them had run a little, because of Phyllis having put the
Brunswick black on too eagerly, but the words were quite easy to
read.</p>

<p>And this what the old gentleman and several other people in the
train read in the large black letters on the white sheet: - </p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>LOOK OUT AT THE STATION.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>A good many people did look out at the station and were
disappointed, for they saw nothing unusual.  The old gentleman
looked out, too, and at first he too saw nothing more unusual than
the gravelled platform and the sunshine and the wallflowers and
forget-me-nots in the station borders.  It was only just as the
train was beginning to puff and pull itself together to start again
that he saw Phyllis.  She was quite out of breath with running.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, &quot;I thought I'd missed you.  My bootlaces would keep
coming down and I fell over them twice.  Here, take it.&quot;</p>

<p>She thrust a warm, dampish letter into his hand as the train moved.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his corner and opened the letter.  This is what he
read: - </p>

<p>&quot;Dear Mr.  We do not know your name.</p>

<p>Mother is ill and the doctor says to give her the things at the end
of the letter, but she says she can't aford it, and to get mutton
for us and she will have the broth.  We do not know anybody here but
you, because Father is away and we do not know the address.  Father
will pay you, or if he has lost all his money, or anything, Peter
will pay you when he is a man.  We promise it on our honer.  I.O.U.
for all the things Mother wants.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;sined Peter.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>&quot;Will you give the parsel to the Station Master, because of us not
knowing what train you come down by?  Say it is for Peter that was
sorry about the coals and he will know all right.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;Roberta.<br />
&quot;Phyllis.<br />
&quot;Peter.&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Then came the list of things the Doctor had ordered.</p>

<p>The old gentleman read it through once, and his eyebrows went up.
He read it twice and smiled a little.  When he had read it thrice,
he put it in his pocket and went on reading The Times.</p>

<p>At about six that evening there was a knock at the back door.  The
three children rushed to open it, and there stood the friendly
Porter, who had told them so many interesting things about railways.
He dumped down a big hamper on the kitchen flags.</p>

<p>&quot;Old gent,&quot; he said; &quot;he asked me to fetch it up straight away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; said Peter, and then, as the Porter lingered,
he added: - </p>

<p>&quot;I'm most awfully sorry I haven't got twopence to give you like
Father does, but - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You drop it if you please,&quot; said the Porter, indignantly.  &quot;I
wasn't thinking about no tuppences.  I only wanted to say I was
sorry your Mamma wasn't so well, and to ask how she finds herself
this evening - and I've fetched her along a bit of sweetbrier, very
sweet to smell it is.  Twopence indeed,&quot; said he, and produced a
bunch of sweetbrier from his hat, &quot;just like a conjurer,&quot; as Phyllis
remarked afterwards.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; said Peter, &quot;and I beg your pardon about the
twopence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No offence,&quot; said the Porter, untruly but politely, and went.</p>

<p>Then the children undid the hamper.  First there was straw, and then
there were fine shavings, and then came all the things they had
asked for, and plenty of them, and then a good many things they had
not asked for; among others peaches and port wine and two chickens,
a cardboard box of big red roses with long stalks, and a tall thin
green bottle of lavender water, and three smaller fatter bottles of
eau-de-Cologne.  There was a letter, too.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Roberta and Phyllis and Peter,&quot; it said; &quot;here are the things
you want.  Your mother will want to know where they came from.  Tell
her they were sent by a friend who heard she was ill.  When she is
well again you must tell her all about it, of course.  And if she
says you ought not to have asked for the things, tell her that I say
you were quite right, and that I hope she will forgive me for taking
the liberty of allowing myself a very great pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p>The letter was signed G. P. something that the children couldn't
