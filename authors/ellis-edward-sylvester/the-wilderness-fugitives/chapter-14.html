<p>All that could be done for a time by the fugitives was to maintain
their position and remain as quiet as the grave until the Indians
moved from their immediate vicinity. The prowling Iroquois were
keen-witted, and although they may have been careless at first,
yet they were on the lookout for the slightest indication of their
enemies. Consequently, the least movement at that time would have
been pretty sure to tell them that the whites, whom they would
suppose were hiding somewhere in the woods, were really close
at hand, and within their power. Every one of the fugitives realized
this, and did not stir while the consultation was going on.</p>

<p>By some means or other &mdash;Ned could never explain how&mdash;he
had reached out his hand, at the moment they took these positions,
and grasped that of Rosa Minturn. It seemed to have been one of
those instinctive actions that are natural under certain peculiar
circumstances. And so, during the better part of an hour, he enjoyed
the sweet pleasure of feeling that delicate little hand nestling
within his own.</p>

<p>At last, when the council of war was finished, the soft rustling
among the leaves and undergrowth showed that the Iroquois were
engaged in carrying out the programme they had just arranged among
themselves. They were separating, and the danger now was that
in leaving the spot they would stumble upon the whites themselves
who were so near them. Nothing could be done to lessen this danger
on the part of the fugitives, the only thing remaining for them
being to continue the deathlike stillness until the peril was
gone. Lena-Wingo was well satisfied that the Iroquois did not
suspect the proximity of the whites, for the act of taking refuge
so near their enemies was scarcely to be expected. They would
not look, therefore, for them in such a place, and it was a matter
of accident or providential interference that would carry the
Iroquois beyond without learning of the presence of the fugitives.
All the latter&mdash;even Rosa herself&mdash;understood this danger, and
the succeeding few minutes were exceedingly trying.</p>

<p>The faint, catlike motion of the redskins proved they were very
close, and likely to come closer any second; and if they happened
to turn to the left but a few feet, it was sure to precipitate
the collision that must be disastrous to the patriots. More than
once Ned Clinton was certain a warrior was crouching so near him
that he could touch him by reaching out his hand. The young scout
was possibly correct in his surmise, for Rosa, who was next to
him, was equally sure of the presence of an enemy, the supposition,
in her case, extending even further. Her eyes were fixed upon
the spot where she believed she could detect a dark form stealing
along on the ground, so near that she fancied he must touch her
dress. If she could see the Indian, she knew the eyes of the warrior
were keen enough to discover her presence, from which some idea
of the painful nature of her situation may be ascertained.</p>

<p>The senses of the girl were preternaturally acute, and still
more, she was no less convinced that she could hear the breathing
of the savage as he crept slowly forward. Fortunately for her,
this fearful strain upon her nerves could last but a few minutes.
If the Indian should come to a halt, she would take it as evidence
that he had discovered the presence of the fugitives, and she
would give the alarm to her friends, but so long as he kept moving,
ever so slowly, there was cause to hope he was unaware of how
close he was to the prize for which they were hunting. The dark
form gradually passed from view, and a few minutes later the straining
vision of Rosa was unable to discover anything to excite alarm,
although her ears, for several minutes after, apprised her that
some of the dreaded figures were still making their way through
the undergrowth dangerously near to her and her friends.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, a half hour more from the conclusion of the
conference of the Iroquois that they got so far away from the
spot that the fugitives felt as though the peril had lifted so
that they could venture to draw a deep breath and move a cramped
limb. However, all waited a while longer before they dared speak
in the most cautious whisper, it being considered the duty of
the whites to wait until Lena-Wingo took the initiative. Suddenly,
in the gloom, it was noticed that the tall Mohawk was standing
perfectly erect, as though looking at something in the direction
of the river. He held this singular position a few minutes, and
then knelt to the earth and applied his ear to the ground. This
was one of his favorite methods when in the immediate vicinity
of a foe, and it rarely failed to add to his knowledge of the
movements of his enemies. While he was thus occupied, his friends
patiently waited until he should be through and ready to direct
them what to do. It did not take him long; for, according to the
plans he had heard agreed upon, every minute only added to the
difficulty of the task he had taken upon himself.</p>

<p>"Stay here," he whispered, his words being the first uttered
since they crouched down in this spot. "Lena-Wingo go way&mdash;soon
come back&mdash;don't make noise."</p>

<p>Every one wondered what the errand could be that should take
the Mohawk away at this critical moment, and Rosa ventured to
ask him.</p>

<p>"Why do you leave us, Lena-Wingo, when there is danger all around?"</p>

<p>"Won't go far &mdash;Lena-Wingo soon be back&mdash;stay right here."</p>

<p>"We've been staying now till we're tired of it, and if you can
find other quarters, I'm sure I will be better satisfied, for
one."</p>

<p>"Soon do so," responded the scout, and without any more explanation
he began a cautious withdrawal from their presence. All were desirous
of knowing what he was after, and they watched him as well as
they could. This, of course, was only for an instant, but it was
long enough to see that he was going in the direction of the river,
from which they had retreated in so much haste. This fact led
Clinton to suspect the true errand of the Mohawk the instant he
started. He said nothing of his belief to his friends, however,
as he had no wish to make a blunder, and the truth would soon
become apparent. All were so impressed with the gravity of the
situation, that only a few syllables passed between them during
the absence of their leader.</p>

<p>As the Indian was not to be seen the three listened with the
keenest attention, hoping to gain something of the purpose of
the Indian. But the silence could not have been more profound
had they been the only living creatures within a thousand miles.
They could detect the soft flow of the Susquehanna, only a few
yards from where they were hiding in the undergrowth. Once, too,
the sound of a rifle broke upon their ears, but it seemed to be
a full mile away, in the depths of the forest, and gave them no
alarm, its only effect being to make the solemn stillness more
solemn and impressive, and to inspire a feeling of loneliness
that was almost painful. Once or twice a ripple of the water was
heard, such as might be supposed to come from the movement of
an enemy stealing through the current, but each of the three knew
it was not caused by friend or foe. They had noticed the same
thing many a time before, and knew it was caused by a drooping
branch or projecting root, acted upon by the sluggish current
which caused it to dip in and out of the stream.</p>

<p>And so that which might have excited apprehension in another
caused no alarm on the part of those whose experience in the woods
had taught them better. At the end of ten minutes, perhaps, Ned
Clinton detected a slight rustle at his side, and turning his
head to learn the cause, found that Lena-Wingo had returned.</p>
