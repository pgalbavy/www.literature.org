<p>When Mrs. Greensleeve first laid eyes on her baby she knew it
was different from the other children.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with it?" she asked.</p>

<p>The preoccupied physician replied that there was nothing the
matter. In point of fact he had been admiring the newly born little
girl when her mother asked the question.</p>

<p>"She's about as perfect as they make 'em," he concluded, placing
the baby beside her mother.</p>

<p>The mother said nothing. From moment to moment she turned her
head on the pillow and gazed down at her new daughter with a curious,
questioning expression. She had never gazed at any of her other
children so uneasily. Even after she fell asleep the slightly
puzzled expression remained as a faint crease between her brows.</p>

<p>Her husband, who had been wandering about from the bar to the
office, from the office to the veranda, and occasionally entirely
around the exterior of the road-house, came in on tiptoe and looked
rather vacantly at them both.</p>

<p>Then he went out again as though he was not sure where he might
be going. He was a little man and mild, and he did not look as
though he had been created for anything in particular, not even
for the purpose of procreation.</p>

<p>It was one of those early April days when birds make a great
fuss over their vocal accomplishments, and the brown earth grows
green over night&mdash;when the hot spring sun draws vapours from the
soil, and the characteristic Long Island odour of manure is far
too prevalent to please anybody but a native.</p>

<p>Peter Greensleeve, wandering at hazard around the corner of the
tavern, came upon his business partner, Archer B. Ledlie leisurely
digging for bait in the barn-yard. The latter was in his shirt-sleeves&mdash;always
a good sign for continued fair weather.</p>

<p>"Boy?" inquired Ledlie, resting one soil-incrusted boot on his
spade.</p>

<p>"Another girl," admitted Greensleeve.</p>

<p>"Gawsh!" After a moment's rumination he picked up a squirming
angle-worm from the edge of the shallow excavation and dropped
it into the empty tomato can.</p>

<p>"Going fishing?" inquired Greensleeve without interest.</p>

<p>"I dunno. Mebbe. Your boy Jack seen a trout into Spring Pond."</p>

<p>Ledlie, who was a large, heavy, red-faced man with a noticeably
small mouth, faded blue eyes, and grey chin whiskers, picked a
budding sprig from a bush, nibbled it, and gravely seated himself
on the edge of the horse-trough. He was wearing a cigar behind
his ear which he presently extracted, gazed at, then reconsidering
the extravagance, replaced.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Boy?' inquired Ledlie, resting one soil-incrusted
boot on his spade."]</p>

<p>"Three gals, Pete&mdash;that's your record," he remarked, gazing reproachfully
out across the salt meadows beyond the causeway. "They won't bring
you in nothin'," he added, shutting his thin lips.</p>

<p>"I kind of like them," said Greensleeve with a sigh.</p>

<p>"They'll eat their heads off," retorted Ledlie; "then they'll
git married an' go off some'rs. There ain't nothin' to gals nohow.
You oughtn't to have went an' done it."</p>

<p>There seemed to be no further defence for Greensleeve. Ledlie
continued to chew a sprig of something green and tender, revolving
it and rolling it from one side of his small, thin-lipped mouth
to the other. His thin little partner brooded in the sunshine.
Once he glanced up at the sign which swung in front of the road-house:
"Hotel Greensleeve: Greensleeve and Ledlie, proprietors."</p>

<p>"Needs painting, Archie," he volunteered mildly.</p>

<p>"I dunno," said the other. "Since the gunnin' season closed there
ain't been no business except them sports from New York. The bar
done good; that's all."</p>

<p>"There were two commercial men Wednesday week."</p>

<p>"Yes, an' they found fault with their vittles. They can go to
the other place next time," which was as near as Ledlie ever came
to profanity.</p>

<p>After a silence Ledlie said: "Here come your kids, Pete. I guess
I'll let 'em dig a little bait for me."</p>

<p>Down the road they came dancing, and across the causeway over
Spring Pond &mdash;Jack, aged four, Doris, three, and Catharine,
two; and they broke into a run when they caught sight of their
father, travelling as fast as their fat little legs could carry
them.</p>

<p>"Is there a new baby? Is there a new baby?" shouted Jack, while
still at a distance.</p>

<p>"Is it a boy? I want another brother! Is it a boy?" shrilled
Doris as she and baby Catharine came panting up with flushed and
excited faces.</p>

<p>"It's a girl," said Greensleeve mildly. "You'd better go into
the kitchen and wash your faces."</p>

<p>"A girl!" cried Jack contemptuously. "What did mamma do that
for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, goodness!" pouted Doris, "I didn't want any more girls around.
What are you going to name her, papa?"</p>

<p>"Athalie, I believe," he said absently.</p>

<p>"Athalie! What kind of name is that?" demanded Jack.</p>

<p>"I dunno. Your mamma wanted it in case the baby was a girl."</p>

<p>The children, breathing hard and rapidly, stood in a silent cluster
looking up at their father. Ledlie yawned frightfully, and they
all instantly turned their eyes on him to discover if possible
the solitary tooth with which rumour credited him. They always
gazed intently into his mouth when he yawned, which irritated
him.</p>

<p>"Go on in and wash yourselves!" he said as soon as speech became
possible. "Ain't you heard what your papa told you!"</p>

<p>They were not afraid of Mr. Ledlie; they merely found him unsympathetic,
and therefore concerned themselves with him not at all.</p>

<p>Ignoring him, Jack said, addressing his father: "I nearly caught
a snake up the road. Gee! But he was a dandy."</p>

<p>"He had stripes," said Doris solemnly.</p>

<p>"He wiggled," asserted little Catharine, and her eyes became
very round.</p>

<p>"What kind was he, papa?" inquired Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, just a snake," replied Greensleeve vaguely.</p>

<p>The eager faces of the children clouded with disappointment;
dawning expectancy faded; it was the old, old tragedy of bread
desired, of the stone offered.</p>

<p>"I liked that snake," muttered Jack. "I wanted to keep him for
a pet. I wanted to know what kind he was. He seemed very friendly."</p>

<p>"Next time," suggested Ledlie, "you pet him on the head with
a rock."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Snakes is no good. There's pizen into 'em. You kill every one
you see an' don't ask questions."</p>

<p>In the boy's face intelligence faded. Impulse lay stunned after
its headlong collision with apathy, and died out in the clutch
of ignorance.</p>

<p>"Is that so, papa?" he asked, dully.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess so," nodded Greensleeve. "Mr. Ledlie knows all
about snakes and things."</p>

<p>"Go on in an' wash!" repeated Ledlie. "You don't git no supper
if you ain't cleaned up for table. Your papa says so, don't you,
Pete?"</p>

<p>Greensleeve usually said what anybody told him to say.</p>

<p>"Walk quietly," he added; "your poor mamma's asleep."</p>

<p>Reluctantly the children turned toward the house, gazing inquiringly
up at the curtained window of their mother's room as they trooped
toward the veranda.</p>

<p>Jack swung around on the lower step:</p>

<p>"Papa!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I forget what her name is!"</p>

<p>"Athalie."</p>
