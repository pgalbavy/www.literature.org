<p>Nothing was more natural than that Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes
should be concerned for the safety of the motor launch <em>Deerfoot</em>.
It had been stolen from them once in simple wantonness by two
young men who had nothing to do with the post office robberies.
The motive for a similar theft was now much stronger. It was evident
that the criminals had come to Beartown, or as near to it as they
could come, by water, and their boat was somewhere in the neighborhood.
They were likely to discover the <em>Deerfoot</em>, if they had
not already done so, and knowing its superior speed, would either
make use of or disable it so it could not be employed for pursuit.</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester kept to the road which connected the landing
with the village, for it was much easier thus to advance than
to pick their way through the pines and firs. They did not meet
a solitary person, for the night was well along and daybreak near.
When the rickety frame work loomed up in the moonlight, they turned
off into the shadow of the wood and moved with the utmost care.
All the time they kept within sight of the gleam of water. Alvin
was in advance, with his comrade close upon his heels.</p>

<p>"Hello! here she is!" was the pleased exclamation of the Captain
a few minutes later.</p>

<p>"Has she had any visitors while we were away?" asked Chester,
as the two stepped down to the margin of the river.</p>

<p>"I see no signs of it, but we shall have to examine further."</p>

<p>The launch lay as close to shore as it had been possible to bring
her&mdash;so close indeed that the two stepped aboard without use of
a plank. The position of the moon in the sky was such that the
shadow of the trees was cast several feet beyond the boat, which,
as a consequence, was wrapped in obscurity. Peering here and there,
the youths began a visual search for the evidence they did not
wish to find. Alvin tried the covering, which had been drawn over
the cockpit, preliminary to taking the bunch of keys from his
pocket. It slid back easily.</p>

<p>"I thought I locked that," he said in surprise.</p>

<p>"I remember you went through the motions, but you must have missed
it."</p>

<p>"So it seems."</p>

<p>He stepped over, seated himself and grasped the steering wheel.</p>

<p>"Nothing is wrong here&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Hark!" whispered Chester.</p>

<p>The two listened and heard the muffled exhaust of a launch not
far off.</p>

<p>"It comes from down stream," said Chester.</p>

<p>"It's their boat!" exclaimed the excited Alvin. "They are hurrying
off."</p>

<p>"Let's chase them!" added Chester, catching the glow of his chum.</p>

<p>"All right! Light up and cast off."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>LIKE A SWALLOW SKIMMING CLOSE TO THE SURFACE</em>.]</p>

<p>Chester quickly fixed the lights, sprang from the taffrail to
shore, untied the loop of rope, flung it on deck and leaped after
it. Alvin had opened the forward deck, which covered the engine,
climbed down and around to the front and started it. Then throwing
in the clutch the boat quickly caught the impulse, and the Captain
steered away from shore. While lying against the bank the nose
of the launch was pointed up the river, and since the noise showed
that the other boat was speeding down stream, it was necessary
to head in that direction. The sweeping circle carried the craft
far out into the moon glow and the Captain turned on full power,
sending the boat southward like a swallow skimming close to the
surface.</p>

<p>"They got the idea yesterday that the <em>Water Witch</em> is
faster than the <em>Deerfoot</em>. That was a cute idea of Calvert,
but they will soon learn their mistake. Do you see anything of
her lights?"</p>

<p>Chester stood beside him in the cockpit, with one hand grasping
the top of the wind-shield, while he peered into the sea of illumination
through which they were plunging.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he answered "but we must be gaining fast."</p>

<p>The water curled over in a graceful half circle as it was split
apart by the sharp prow. Some of the spray was scattered over
him, though otherwise the river was as calm as a millpond. The
tide was at its turn, so there was no current. Alvin held to the
middle of the river, where he knew it was very deep, and he would
have timely notice of every obstruction that could appear.</p>

<p>Now that the two were fairly started upon the singular chase,
they had time to speculate as to its probable result. They had
not a firearm on the boat nor had they ever had one aboard. They
were chasing a party of criminals who were sure to be well armed.
Suppose our young friends overtook them, what could they do?</p>

<p>Alvin had a dim idea that having drawn near enough to discover
the <em>Water Witch</em>, he would keep in sight until others
could intervene. His boat would follow whereever the fugitive
dare lead, and would never give up. If our young friends could
not attack, they could point out the way for others. Should the
criminals run into shore, where there was a chance of landing
without being observed, the pursuers could be at their heels,
and through the nearest telegraph station raise the hue and cry
that would quickly end in their overthrow.</p>

<p>"It is strange," reflected Alvin, "that while we have not meant
to have anything to do with those scamps we are continually running
into them, while Detective Calvert, who is in this part of the
world for that purpose, can't put his hand on them. If he and
his friend, whom we saw at Wiscasset, and who is an officer of
the law also, were here, we should be sure of doing the right
thing. As it is, it's all guesswork."</p>

<p>"Light ahead!" suddenly called Chester beside him.</p>

<p>"Where away?"</p>

<p>"Right ahead, but closer in shore on the left."</p>

<p>Alvin leaned forward and gazed intently.</p>

<p>"You are right," he added as he saw a white light low down on
the water. "Now we'll show those fellows what the <em>Deerfoot</em>
can do when she tries."</p>

<p>He flirted over the little lever controlling the power, and instantly
the engine responded so fiercely that the launch shivered from
stem to stern. It bounded forward like a hound freed from the
leash, the bow rising from the impulse, as if it would leap clear
of the water, and seemingly shooting over it, like an iceboat
driven in a hurricane.</p>

<p>But the launch in front was no laggard. Whether she increased
her speed at sight of the light which was seemingly hustling down
the river after her, or whether she simply held her former rate,
she was going at a tremendous pace. Soon leaving Long Ledge on
their right, the pursuer shot into the broader waters of Montsweag
Bay, only to find the white light seemingly as far off as ever.
Possibly the pursuers had gained something, but not enough to
be perceptible.</p>

<p>"They have seen us," said Chester, from his station at the front,
"and are putting in their best licks. We must be going the limit."</p>

<p>"That is twenty-four miles, but we're not making it, Chester."</p>

<p>The second mate pulled down his cap more snugly, for the motionless
air was turned into a gale, and looked back.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? The <em>Deerfoot</em> is eating up water."</p>

<p>"That may be, but she isn't getting there as she ought to," insisted
Alvin, who, of course, was more familiar with his boat. "Something
is the matter with her. She seems to be doing her best, and yet
she lags."</p>

<p>"Do you think it because of her trouble yesterday?"</p>

<p>"It must be, but I was sure she was shipshape when we left her
last night. See whether we are gaining."</p>

<p>Chester spent several minutes in studying the position and progress
of that white light, which was gliding with swift smoothness over
the water, and hugging the bank all the while. When he spoke it
was doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we have gained a little, say about six inches."</p>

<p>Alvin groped about him for the binoculars, which he had left
on the seat at his side. By turning the glass over when in use,
one could avail himself of the night lens, which was helpful in
the gloom. But he did not find it.</p>

<p>"That's queer," he muttered; "I am sure I laid it there. I wonder
if anyone visited the boat while we were away."</p>

<p>"By gracious!" called Chester from his station; "I believe she
has stopped!"</p>

<p>"Make sure of it. I should think they would put out their stern
light if they wanted to elude us."</p>

<p>"Likely they don't care. Yes; she has run into shore, where there
seems to be some sort of landing."</p>

<p>Alvin swung over the wheel so as to approach directly from the
rear. Since the other boat had become motionless, he slackened
speed to save the strain upon his own.</p>

<p>Everything was now in the vivid moonlight. The launch drew steadily
up to the landing where the other boat had halted. Two men were
observed moving about as if making ready to tie up for the remainder
of the night. They showed no interest in their pursuers, and Alvin
sheered off slightly so as to pass at a distance of several rods,
and while doing so he made an exasperating discovery.</p>

<p>The craft which he had been pursuing with so much zest was not
the <em>Water Witch</em>, but a small runabout capable of high
speed. The couple on board gave no attention to the larger craft,
and the chagrined Alvin turned farther out into the bay and gradually
headed up stream again. Chester came back from the front and chuckled:</p>

<p>"What a wild goose chase! The next thing to do is to make after
the <em>Nahanada</em> or the <em>Gardiner</em>. There will be
as much sense in the one as the other."</p>

<p>Observing the change of course, Chester inquired:</p>

<p>"Where to now?"</p>

<p>"We may as well go back and pick up Mike. It seems to be growing
light in the east."</p>

<p>"So it is; a memorable night in our experience is drawing to
a close."</p>

<p>"I say, Chester," called the Captain, "I am sure someone was
on this boat while we were away at Beartown."</p>

<p>A sudden suspicion took form in his mind.</p>

<p>"Is there enough light for you to see the name on the bow?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Take a look and tell me what it is."</p>

<p>Chester carefully leaned over and studied the gilt letters painted
on the right of the prow corresponding to those on the left. Then
he straightened up with a gasp:</p>

<p>"As sure as I'm a living sinner it's the <em>Water Witch</em>!"</p>
