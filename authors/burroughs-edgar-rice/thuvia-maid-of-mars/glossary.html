<DT>Apt.
<DD>An Arctic monster.  A huge, white-furred creature with six
limbs, four of which, short and heavy, carry it over the snow and
ice; the other two, which grow forward from its shoulders on either
side of its long, powerful neck, terminate in white, hairless hands
with which it seizes and holds its prey.  Its head and mouth are
similar in appearance to those of a hippopotamus, except that from
the sides of the lower jawbone two mighty horns curve slightly
downward toward the front.  Its two huge eyes extend in two vast
oval patches from the centre of the top of the cranium down either
side of the head to below the roots of the horns, so that these
weapons really grow out from the lower part of the eyes, which are
composed of several thousand ocelli each.  Each ocellus is furnished
with its own lid, and the apt can, at will, close as many of the
facets of his huge eyes as he chooses. (See THE WARLORD OF MARS.)

jaws are equipped with several rows of long needle-like fangs, and

<DD>A race inhabiting the Valley Dor.  They are ten or twelve
feet in height when standing erect; their arms are very short and
fashioned after the manner of an elephant's trunk, being sinuous;
the body is hairless and ghoulish blue except for a broad band of
white which encircles the protruding, single eye, the pupil, iris
and ball of which are dead white.  The nose is a ragged, inflamed,
circular hole in the centre of the blank face, resembling a fresh
bullet wound which has not yet commenced to bleed.  There is no
mouth in the head.  With the exception of the face, the head is
covered by a tangled mass of jet-black hair some eight or ten inches
in length.  Each hair is about the thickness of a large angleworm.
The body, legs and feet are of human shape but of monstrous
proportions, the feet being fully three feet long and very flat
and broad.  The method of feeding consists in running their odd
hands over the surface of the turf, cropping off the tender vegetation
with razor-like talons and sucking it up from two mouths, which
lie one in the palm of each hand.  They are equipped with a massive
tail about six feet long, quite round where it joins the body, but
tapering to a flat, thin blade toward the end, which trails at
right angles to the ground.  (See THE GODS OF MARS.)
