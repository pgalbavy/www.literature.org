<P>The road was long, but the horses upon which D'Artagnan and
Planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied
stables of the Lord of Bracieux; the master and servant rode
side by side, conversing as they went, for D'Artagnan had by
degrees thrown off the master and Planchet had entirely
ceased to assume the manners of a servant. He had been
raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his
master. It was many years since D'Artagnan had opened his
heart to any one; it happened, however, that these two men,
on meeting again, assimilated perfectly. Planchet was in
truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures; he was a
man of uncommonly sound sense. Without courting danger he
never shrank from an encounter; in short, he had been a
soldier and arms ennoble a man; it was, therefore, on the
footing of friends that D'Artagnan and Planchet arrived in
the neighborhood of Blois.</P>
<P>Going along, D'Artagnan, shaking his head, said:</P>
<P>&quot;I know that my going to Athos is useless and absurd; but
still I owe this courtesy to my old friend, a man who had in
him material for the most noble and generous of characters.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Monsieur Athos was a noble gentleman,&quot; said Planchet,
&quot;was he not? Scattering money round about him as Heaven
sprinkles rain. Do you remember, sir, that duel with the
Englishman in the inclosure des Carmes? Ah! how lofty, how
magnificent Monsieur Athos was that day, when he said to his
adversary: `You have insisted on knowing my name, sir; so
much the worse for you, since I shall be obliged to kill
you.' I was near him, those were his exact words, when he
stabbed his foe as he said he would, and his adversary fell
without saying, `Oh!' 'Tis a noble gentleman  -  Monsieur
Athos.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, true as Gospel,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;but one single
fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I remember well,&quot; said Planchet, &quot;he was fond of drinking
 -  in truth, he drank, but not as other men drink. One
seemed, as he raised the wine to his lips, to hear him say,
`Come, juice of the grape, and chase away my sorrows.' And
how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a
bottle! There was no one like him for that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And now,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;behold the sad spectacle
that awaits us. This noble gentleman with his lofty glance,
this handsome cavalier, so brilliant in feats of arms that
every one was surprised that he held in his hand a sword
only instead of a baton of command! Alas! we shall find him
changed into a broken down old man, with garnet nose and
eyes that slobber; we shall find him extended on some lawn,
whence he will look at us with a languid eye and
peradventure will not recognize us. God knows, Planchet,
that I should fly from a sight so sad if I did not wish to
show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once
the Comte de la Fere, whom we loved so much.&quot;</P>
<P>Planchet shook his head and said nothing. It was evident
that he shared his master's apprehensions.</P>
<P>&quot;And then,&quot; resumed D'Artagnan, &quot;to this decrepitude is
probably added poverty, for he must have neglected the
little that he had, and the dirty scoundrel, Grimaud, more
taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master  - 
stay, Planchet, it breaks my heart to merely think of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I fancy myself there and that I see him staggering and hear
him stammering,&quot; said Planchet, in a piteous tone, &quot;but at
all events we shall soon know the real state of things, for
I imagine that those lofty walls, now turning ruby in the
setting sun, are the walls of Blois.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Probably; and those steeples, pointed and sculptured, that
we catch a glimpse of yonder, are similar to those that I
have heard described at Chambord.&quot;</P>
<P>At this moment one of those heavy wagons, drawn by bullocks,
which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country
to the ports of the Loire, came out of a byroad full of ruts
and turned on that which the two horsemen were following. A
man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it,
with which he urged on his slow team, was walking with the
cart.</P>
<P>&quot;Ho! friend,&quot; cried Planchet.</P>
<P>&quot;What's your pleasure, gentlemen?&quot; replied the peasant, with
a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district
and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of
the Sorbonne and the Rue de l'Universite.</P>
<P>&quot;We are looking for the house of Monsieur de la Fere,&quot; said
D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>The peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name.</P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said, &quot;the wood that I am carting is his; I
cut it in his copse and I am taking it to the chateau.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan determined not to question this man; he did not
wish to hear from another what he had himself said to
Planchet.</P>
<P>&quot;The chateau!&quot; he said to himself, &quot;what chateau? Ah, I
understand! Athos is not a man to be thwarted; he, like
Porthos, has obliged his peasantry to call him `my lord,'
and to dignify his pettifogging place by the name of
chateau. He had a heavy hand  -  dear old Athos  -  after
drinking.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan, after asking the man the right way, continued
his route, agitated in spite of himself at the idea of
seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly
loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example
to his education as a gentleman. He checked by degrees the
speed of his horse and went on, his head drooping as if in
deep thought.</P>
<P>Soon, as the road turned, the Chateau de la Valliere
appeared in view; then, a quarter of a mile beyond, a white
house, encircled in sycamores, was visible at the farther
end of a group of trees, which spring had powdered with a
snow of flowers.</P>
<P>On beholding this house, D'Artagnan, calm as he was in
general, felt an unusual disturbance within his heart  -  so
powerful during the whole course of life are the
recollections of youth. He proceeded, nevertheless, and came
opposite to an iron gate, ornamented in the taste of the
period.</P>
<P>Through the gate was seen kitchen-gardens, carefully
attended to, a spacious courtyard, in which neighed several
horses held by valets in various liveries, and a carriage,
drawn by two horses of the country.</P>
<P>&quot;We are mistaken,&quot; said D'Artagnan. &quot;This cannot be the
establishment of Athos. Good heavens! suppose he is dead and
that this property now belongs to some one who bears his
name. Alight, Planchet, and inquire, for I confess that I
have scarcely courage so to do.&quot;</P>
<P>Planchet alighted.</P>
<P>&quot;Thou must add,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;that a gentleman who is
passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects
to the Comte de la Fere, and if thou art satisfied with what
thou hearest, then mention my name!&quot;</P>
<P>Planchet, leading his horse by the bridle, drew near to the
gate and rang the bell, and immediately a servant-man with
white hair and of erect stature, notwithstanding his age,
presented himself.</P>
<P>&quot;Does Monsieur le Comte de la Fere live here?&quot; asked
Planchet.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur, it is here he lives,&quot; the servant replied to
Planchet, who was not in livery.</P>
<P>&quot;A nobleman retired from service, is he not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And who had a lackey named Grimaud?&quot; persisted Planchet,
who had prudently considered that he couldn't have too much
information.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur Grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time
being,&quot; said the servitor, who, little used as he was to
such inquiries, began to examine Planchet from head to foot.</P>
<P>&quot;Then,&quot; cried Planchet joyously, &quot;I see well that it is the
same Comte de la Fere whom we seek. Be good enough to open
to me, for I wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my
master, one of his friends, is here, and wishes to greet
him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why didn't you say so?&quot; said the servitor, opening the
gate. &quot;But where is your master?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He is following me.&quot;</P>
<P>The servitor opened the gate and walked before Planchet, who
made a sign to D'Artagnan. The latter, his heart palpitating
more than ever, entered the courtyard without dismounting.</P>
<P>Whilst Planchet was standing on the steps before the house
he heard a voice say:</P>
<P>&quot;Well, where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him
here?&quot;</P>
<P>This voice, the sound of which reached D'Artagnan,
reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments, a thousand
recollections that he had forgotten. He vaulted hastily from
his horse, whilst Planchet, with a smile on his lips,
advanced toward the master of the house.</P>
<P>&quot;But I know you, my lad,&quot; said Athos, appearing on the
threshold.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yes, monsieur le comte, you know me and I know you. I
am Planchet  -  Planchet, whom you know well.&quot; But the honest
servant could say no more, so much was he overcome by this
unexpected interview.</P>
<P>&quot;What, Planchet, is Monsieur d'Artagnan here?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Here I am, my friend, dear Athos!&quot; cried D'Artagnan, in a
faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation.</P>
<P>At these words a visible emotion was expressed on the
beautiful countenance and calm features of Athos. He rushed
toward D'Artagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him
in his arms. D'Artagnan, equally moved, pressed him also
closely to him, whilst tears stood in his eyes. Athos then
took him by the hand and led him into the drawing-room,
where there were several people. Every one arose.</P>
<P>&quot;I present to you,&quot; he said, &quot;Monsieur le Chevalier
D'Artagnan, lieutenant of his majesty's musketeers, a
devoted friend and one of the most excellent, brave
gentlemen that I have ever known.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan received the compliments of those who were
present in his own way, and whilst the conversation became
general he looked earnestly at Athos.</P>
<P>Strange! Athos was scarcely aged at all! His fine eyes, no
longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of
dissipation pencil too infallibly, seemed larger, more
liquid than ever. His face, a little elongated, had gained
in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement. His
hand, always wonderfully beautiful and strong, was set off
by a ruffle of lace, like certain hands by Titian and
Vandyck. He was less stiff than formerly. His long, dark
hair, softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils,
fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls; his voice
was still youthful, as if belonging to a Hercules of
twenty-five, and his magnificent teeth, which he had
preserved white and sound, gave an indescribable charm to
his smile.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the guests, seeing that the two friends were
longing to be alone, prepared to depart, when a noise of
dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many
persons said at the same moment:</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! 'tis Raoul, who is come home.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos, as the name of Raoul was pronounced, looked
inquisitively at D'Artagnan, in order to see if any
curiosity was painted on his face. But D'Artagnan was still
in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a
fine young man of fifteen years of age, dressed simply, but
in perfect taste, entered the room, raising, as he came, his
hat, adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, D'Artagnan was struck by the appearance of
this new personage. It seemed to explain to him the change
in Athos; a resemblance between the boy and the man
explained the mystery of this regenerated existence. He
remained listening and gazing.</P>
<P>&quot;Here you are, home again, Raoul,&quot; said the comte.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied the youth, with deep respect, &quot;and I
have performed the commission that you gave me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But what's the matter, Raoul?&quot; said Athos, very anxiously.
&quot;You are pale and agitated.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sir,&quot; replied the young man, &quot;it is on account of an
accident which has happened to our little neighbor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To Mademoiselle de la Valliere?&quot; asked Athos, quickly.</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot; cried many persons present.</P>
<P>&quot;She was walking with her nurse Marceline, in the place
where the woodmen cut the wood, when, passing on horseback,
I stopped. She saw me also and in trying to jump from the
end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted, the poor
child fell and was not able to rise again. I fear that she
has badly sprained her ankle.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, heavens!&quot; cried Athos. &quot;And her mother, Madame de
Saint-Remy, have they yet told her of it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, sir, Madame de Saint-Remy is at Blois with the Duchess
of Orleans. I am afraid that what was first done was
unskillful, if not worse than useless. I am come, sir, to
ask your advice.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Send directly to Blois, Raoul; or, rather, take horse and
ride immediately yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul bowed.</P>
<P>&quot;But where is Louise?&quot; asked the comte.</P>
<P>&quot;I have brought her here, sir, and I have deposited her in
charge of Charlotte, who, till better advice comes, has
bathed the foot in cold well-water.&quot;</P>
<P>The guests now all took leave of Athos, excepting the old
Duc de Barbe, who, as an old friend of the family of La
Valliere, went to see little Louise and offered to take her
to Blois in his carriage.</P>
<P>&quot;You are right, sir,&quot; said Athos. &quot;She will be the sooner
with her mother. As for you, Raoul, I am sure it is your
fault, some giddiness or folly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, sir, I assure you,&quot; muttered Raoul, &quot;it is not.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, no, no, I declare it is not!&quot; cried the young girl,
while Raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the
cause of her disaster.</P>
<P>&quot;Nevertheless, Raoul, you must go to Blois and you must make
your excuses and mine to Madame de Saint-Remy.&quot;</P>
<P>The youth looked pleased. He again took in his strong arms
the little girl, whose pretty golden head and smiling face
rested on his shoulder, and placed her gently in the
carriage; then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a
first-rate esquire, after bowing to Athos and D'Artagnan, he
went off close by the door of the carriage, on somebody
inside of which his eyes were riveted.</P></div>
