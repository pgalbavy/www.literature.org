<p>Henry Wimbush’s long cigar burned aromatically. The "History
of Crome"  lay on his knee; slowly he turned over the pages.</p>

<p>"I can’t decide what episode to read you to-night," he said thoughtfully.
"Sir Ferdinando’s voyages are not without interest. Then, of course,
there’s his son, Sir Julius. It was he who suffered from the delusion
that his perspiration engendered flies; it drove him finally to
suicide. Or there’s Sir Cyprian." He turned the pages more rapidly.
"Or Sir Henry. Or Sir George...No, I’m inclined to think I won’t
read about any of these."</p>

<p>"But you must read something," insisted Mr. Scogan, taking his
pipe out of his mouth.</p>

<p>"I think I shall read about my grandfather," said Henry Wimbush,
"and the events that led up to his marriage with the eldest daughter
of the last Sir Ferdinando."</p>

<p>"Good," said Mr. Scogan. "We are listening."</p>

<p>"Before I begin reading," said Henry Wimbush, looking up from
the book and taking off the pince-nez which he had just fitted
to his nose&mdash;"before I begin, I must say a few preliminary words
about Sir Ferdinando, the last of the Lapiths. At the death of
the virtuous and unfortunate Sir Hercules, Ferdinando found himself
in possession of the family fortune, not a little increased by
his father’s temperance and thrift; he applied himself forthwith
to the task of spending it, which he did in an ample and jovial
fashion. By the time he was forty he had eaten and, above all,
drunk and loved away about half his capital, and would infallibly
have soon got rid of the rest in the same manner, if he had not
had the good fortune to become so madly enamoured of the Rector’s
daughter as to make a proposal of marriage. The young lady accepted
him, and in less than a year had become the absolute mistress
of Crome and her husband. An extraordinary reformation made itself
apparent in Sir Ferdinando’s character. He grew regular and economical
in his habits; he even became temperate, rarely drinking more
than a bottle and a half of port at a sitting. The waning fortune
of the Lapiths began once more to wax, and that in despite of
the hard times (for Sir Ferdinando married in 1809 in the height
of the Napoleonic Wars). A prosperous and dignified old age, cheered
by the spectacle of his children’s growth and happiness&mdash;for Lady
Lapith had already borne him three daughters, and there seemed
no good reason why she should not bear many more of them, and
sons as well&mdash;a patriarchal decline into the family vault, seemed
now to be Sir Ferdinando’s enviable destiny. But Providence willed
otherwise. To Napoleon, cause already of such infinite mischief,
was due, though perhaps indirectly, the untimely and violent death
which put a period to this reformed existence.</p>

<p>"Sir Ferdinando, who was above all things a patriot, had adopted,
from the earliest days of the conflict with the French, his own
peculiar method of celebrating our victories. When the happy news
reached London, it was his custom to purchase immediately a large
store of liquor and, taking a place on whichever of the outgoing
coaches he happened to light on first, to drive through the country
proclaiming the good news to all he met on the road and dispensing
it, along with the liquor, at every stopping-place to all who
cared to listen or drink. Thus, after the Nile, he had driven
as far as Edinburgh; and later, when the coaches, wreathed with
laurel for triumph, with cypress for mourning, were setting out
with the news of Nelson’s victory and death, he sat through all
a chilly October night on the box of the Norwich ‘Meteor’ with
a nautical keg of rum on his knees and two cases of old brandy
under the seat. This genial custom was one of the many habits
which he abandoned on his marriage. The victories in the Peninsula,
the retreat from Moscow, Leipzig, and the abdication of the tyrant
all went uncelebrated. It so happened, however, that in the summer
of 1815 Sir Ferdinando was staying for a few weeks in the capital.
There had been a succession of anxious, doubtful days; then came
the glorious news of Waterloo. It was too much for Sir Ferdinando;
his joyous youth awoke again within him. He hurried to his wine
merchant and bought a dozen bottles of 1760 brandy. The Bath coach
was on the point of starting; he bribed his way on to the box
and, seated in glory beside the driver, proclaimed aloud the downfall
of the Corsican bandit and passed about the warm liquid joy. They
clattered through Uxbridge, Slough, Maidenhead. Sleeping Reading
was awakened by the great news. At Didcot one of the ostlers was
so much overcome by patriotic emotions and the 1760 brandy that
he found it impossible to do up the buckles of the harness. The
night began to grow chilly, and Sir Ferdinando found that it was
not enough to take a nip at every stage: to keep up his vital
warmth he was compelled to drink between the stages as well. They
were approaching Swindon. The coach was travelling at a dizzy
speed&mdash;six miles in the last half-hour&mdash;when, without having manifested
the slightest premonitory symptom of unsteadiness, Sir Ferdinando
suddenly toppled sideways off his seat and fell, head foremost,
into the road. An unpleasant jolt awakened the slumbering passengers.
The coach was brought to a standstill; the guard ran back with
a light. He found Sir Ferdinando still alive, but unconscious;
blood was oozing from his mouth. The back wheels of the coach
had passed over his body, breaking most of his ribs and both arms.
His skull was fractured in two places. They picked him up, but
he was dead before they reached the next stage. So perished Sir
Ferdinando, a victim to his own patriotism. Lady Lapith did not
marry again, but determined to devote the rest of her life to
the well-being of her three children &mdash;Georgiana, now five
years old, and Emmeline and Caroline, twins of two."</p>

<p>Henry Wimbush paused, and once more put on his pince-nez. "So
much by way of introduction," he said. "Now I can begin to read
about my grandfather."</p>

<p>"One moment," said Mr. Scogan, "till I’ve refilled my pipe."</p>

<p>Mr. Wimbush waited. Seated apart in a corner of the room, Ivor
was showing Mary his sketches of Spirit Life. They spoke together
in whispers.</p>

<p>Mr. Scogan had lighted his pipe again. "Fire away," he said.</p>

<p>Henry Wimbush fired away.</p>

<p>"It was in the spring of 1833 that my grandfather, George Wimbush,
first made the acquaintance of the ‘three lovely Lapiths,’ as
they were always called. He was then a young man of twenty-two,
with curly yellow hair and a smooth pink face that was the mirror
of his youthful and ingenuous mind. He had been educated at Harrow
and Christ Church, he enjoyed hunting and all other field sports,
and, though his circumstances were comfortable to the verge of
affluence, his pleasures were temperate and innocent. His father,
an East Indian merchant, had destined him for a political career,
and had gone to considerable expense in acquiring a pleasant little
Cornish borough as a twenty-first birthday gift for his son. He
was justly indignant when, on the very eve of George’s majority,
the Reform Bill of 1832 swept the borough out of existence. The
inauguration of George’s political career had to be postponed.
At the time he got to know the lovely Lapiths he was waiting;
he was not at all impatient.</p>

<p>"The lovely Lapiths did not fail to impress him. Georgiana, the
eldest, with her black ringlets, her flashing eyes, her noble
aquiline profile, her swan-like neck, and sloping shoulders, was
orientally dazzling; and the twins, with their delicately turned-up
noses, their blue eyes, and chestnut hair, were an identical pair
of ravishingly English charmers.</p>

<p>"Their conversation at this first meeting proved, however, to
be so forbidding that, but for the invincible attraction exercised
by their beauty, George would never have had the courage to follow
up the acquaintance. The twins, looking up their noses at him
with an air of languid superiority, asked him what he thought
of the latest French poetry and whether he liked the ‘Indiana’
of George Sand. But what was almost worse was the question with
which Georgiana opened her conversation with him. ‘In music,’
she asked, leaning forward and fixing him with her large dark
eyes, ‘are you a classicist or a transcendentalist?’ George did
not lose his presence of mind. He had enough appreciation of music
to know that he hated anything classical, and so, with a promptitude
which did him credit, he replied, ‘I am a transcendentalist.’
Georgiana smiled bewitchingly. ‘I am glad,’ she said; ‘so am I.
You went to hear Paganini last week, of course. "The prayer of
Moses"&mdash;ah!’ She closed her eyes. ‘Do you know anything more transcendental
than that?’ ‘No,’ said George, ‘I don’t.’ He hesitated, was about
to go on speaking, and then decided that after all it would be
wiser not to say&mdash;what was in fact true&mdash;that he had enjoyed above
all Paganini’s Farmyard Imitations. The man had made his fiddle
bray like an ass, cluck like a hen, grunt, squeal, bark, neigh,
quack, bellow, and growl; that last item, in George’s estimation,
had almost compensated for the tediousness of the rest of the
concert. He smiled with pleasure at the thought of it. Yes, decidedly,
he was no classicist in music; he was a thoroughgoing transcendentalist.</p>

<p>"George followed up this first introduction by paying a call
on the young ladies and their mother, who occupied, during the
season, a small but elegant house in the neighbourhood of Berkeley
Square. Lady Lapith made a few discreet inquiries, and having
found that George’s financial position, character, and family
were all passably good, she asked him to dine. She hoped and expected
that her daughters would all marry into the peerage; but, being
a prudent woman, she knew it was advisable to prepare for all
contingencies. George Wimbush, she thought, would make an excellent
second string for one of the twins.</p>

<p>"At this first dinner, George’s partner was Emmeline. They talked
of Nature. Emmeline protested that to her high mountains were
a feeling and the hum of human cities torture. George agreed that
the country was very agreeable, but held that London during the
season also had its charms. He noticed with surprise and a certain
solicitous distress that Miss Emmeline’s appetite was poor, that
it didn’t, in fact, exist. Two spoonfuls of soup, a morsel of
fish, no bird, no meat, and three grapes&mdash;that was her whole dinner.
He looked from time to time at her two sisters; Georgiana and
Caroline seemed to be quite as abstemious. They waved away whatever
was offered them with an expression of delicate disgust, shutting
their eyes and averting their faces from the proffered dish, as
though the lemon sole, the duck, the loin of veal, the trifle,
were objects revolting to the sight and smell. George, who thought
the dinner capital, ventured to comment on the sisters’ lack of
appetite.</p>

<p>"‘Pray, don’t talk to me of eating,’ said Emmeline, drooping
like a sensitive plant. ‘We find it so coarse, so unspiritual,
my sisters and I. One can’t think of one’s soul while one is eating.’</p>

<p>"George agreed; one couldn’t. ‘But one must live,’ he said.</p>

<p>"‘Alas!’ Emmeline sighed. ‘One must. Death is very beautiful,
don’t you think?’ She broke a corner off a piece of toast and
began to nibble at it languidly. ‘But since, as you say, one must
live...’ She made a little gesture of resignation. ‘Luckily a
very little suffices to keep one alive.’ She put down her corner
of toast half eaten.</p>

<p>"George regarded her with some surprise. She was pale, but she
looked extraordinarily healthy, he thought; so did her sisters.
Perhaps if you were really spiritual you needed less food. He,
clearly, was not spiritual.</p>

<p>"After this he saw them frequently. They all liked him, from
Lady Lapith downwards. True, he was not very romantic or poetical;
but he was such a pleasant, unpretentious, kind-hearted young
man, that one couldn’t help liking him. For his part, he thought
them wonderful, wonderful, especially Georgiana. He enveloped
them all in a warm, protective affection. For they needed protection;
they were altogether too frail, too spiritual for this world.
They never ate, they were always pale, they often complained of
fever, they talked much and lovingly of death, they frequently
swooned. Georgiana was the most ethereal of all; of the three
she ate least, swooned most often, talked most of death, and was
the palest&mdash;with a pallor that was so startling as to appear positively
artificial. At any moment, it seemed, she might loose her precarious
hold on this material world and become all spirit. To George the
thought was a continual agony. If she were to die...</p>

<p>"She contrived, however, to live through the season, and that
in spite of the numerous balls, routs, and other parties of pleasure
which, in company with the rest of the lovely trio, she never
failed to attend. In the middle of July the whole household moved
down to the country. George was invited to spend the month of
August at Crome.</p>

<p>"The house-party was distinguished; in the list of visitors figured
the names of two marriageable young men of title. George had hoped
that country air, repose, and natural surroundings might have
restored to the three sisters their appetites and the roses of
their cheeks. He was mistaken. For dinner, the first evening,
Georgiana ate only an olive, two or three salted almonds, and
half a peach. She was as pale as ever. During the meal she spoke
of love.</p>

<p>"‘True love,’ she said, ‘being infinite and eternal, can only
be consummated in eternity. Indiana and Sir Rodolphe celebrated
the mystic wedding of their souls by jumping into Niagara. Love
is incompatible with life. The wish of two people who truly love
one another is not to live together but to die together.’</p>

<p>"‘Come, come, my dear,’ said Lady Lapith, stout and practical.
‘What would become of the next generation, pray, if all the world
acted on your principles?’</p>

<p>"‘Mamma!...’ Georgiana protested, and dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>"‘In my young days,’ Lady Lapith went on, ‘I should have been
laughed out of countenance if I’d said a thing like that. But
then in my young days souls weren’t as fashionable as they are
now and we didn’t think death was at all poetical. It was just
unpleasant.’</p>

<p>"‘Mamma!...’ Emmeline and Caroline implored in unison.</p>

<p>"‘In my young days&mdash;’ Lady Lapith was launched into her subject;
nothing, it seemed, could stop her now. ‘In my young days, if
you didn’t eat, people told you you needed a dose of rhubarb.
Nowadays...’</p>

<p>"There was a cry; Georgiana had swooned sideways on to Lord Timpany’s
shoulder. It was a desperate expedient; but it was successful.
Lady Lapith was stopped.</p>

<p>"The days passed in an uneventful round of pleasures. Of all
the gay party George alone was unhappy. Lord Timpany was paying
his court to Georgiana, and it was clear that he was not unfavourably
received. George looked on, and his soul was a hell of jealousy
and despair. The boisterous company of the young men became intolerable
to him; he shrank from them, seeking gloom and solitude. One morning,
having broken away from them on some vague pretext, he returned
to the house alone. The young men were bathing in the pool below;
their cries and laughter floated up to him, making the quiet house
seem lonelier and more silent. The lovely sisters and their mamma
still kept their chambers; they did not customarily make their
appearance till luncheon, so that the male guests had the morning
to themselves. George sat down in the hall and abandoned himself
to thought.</p>

<p>"At any moment she might die; at any moment she might become
Lady Timpany. It was terrible, terrible. If she died, then he
would die too; he would go to seek her beyond the grave. If she
became Lady Timpany...ah, then! The solution of the problem would
not be so simple. If she became Lady Timpany: it was a horrible
thought. But then suppose she were in love with Timpany&mdash;though
it seemed incredible that anyone could be in love with Timpany&mdash;suppose
her life depended on Timpany, suppose she couldn’t live without
him? He was fumbling his way along this clueless labyrinth of
suppositions when the clock struck twelve. On the last stroke,
like an automaton released by the turning clockwork, a little
maid, holding a large covered tray, popped out of the door that
led from the kitchen regions into the hall. From his deep arm-chair
George watched her (himself, it was evident, unobserved) with
an idle curiosity. She pattered across the room and came to a
halt in front of what seemed a blank expense of panelling. She
reached out her hand and, to George’s extreme astonishment, a
little door swung open, revealing the foot of a winding staircase.
Turning sideways in order to get her tray through the narrow opening,
the little maid darted in with a rapid crab-like motion. The door
closed behind her with a click. A minute later it opened again
and the maid, without her tray, hurried back across the hall and
disappeared in the direction of the kitchen. George tried to recompose
his thoughts, but an invincible curiosity drew his mind towards
the hidden door, the staircase, the little maid. It was in vain
he told himself that the matter was none of his business, that
to explore the secrets of that surprising door, that mysterious
staircase within, would be a piece of unforgivable rudeness and
indiscretion. It was in vain; for five minutes he struggled heroically
with his curiosity, but at the end of that time he found himself
standing in front of the innocent sheet of panelling through which
the little maid had disappeared. A glance sufficed to show him
the position of the secret door&mdash;secret, he perceived, only to
those who looked with a careless eye. It was just an ordinary
door let in flush with the panelling. No latch nor handle betrayed
its position, but an unobtrusive catch sunk in the wood invited
the thumb. George was astonished that he had not noticed it before;
now he had seen it, it was so obvious, almost as obvious as the
cupboard door in the library with its lines of imitation shelves
and its dummy books. He pulled back the catch and peeped inside.
The staircase, of which the degrees were made not of stone but
of blocks of ancient oak, wound up and out of sight. A slit-like
window admitted the daylight; he was at the foot of the central
tower, and the little window looked out over the terrace; they
were still shouting and splashing in the pool below.</p>

<p>"George closed the door and went back to his seat. But his curiosity
was not satisfied. Indeed, this partial satisfaction had but whetted
its appetite. Where did the staircase lead? What was the errand
of the little maid? It was no business of his, he kept repeating&mdash;no
business of his. He tried to read, but his attention wandered.
A quarter-past twelve sounded on the harmonious clock. Suddenly
determined, George rose, crossed the room, opened the hidden door,
and began to ascend the stairs. He passed the first window, corkscrewed
round, and came to another. He paused for a moment to look out;
his heart beat uncomfortably, as though he were affronting some
unknown danger. What he was doing, he told himself, was extremely
ungentlemanly, horribly underbred. He tiptoed onward and upward.
One turn more, then half a turn, and a door confronted him. He
halted before it, listened; he could hear no sound. Putting his
eye to the keyhole, he saw nothing but a stretch of white sunlit
wall. Emboldened, he turned the handle and stepped across the
threshold. There he halted, petrified by what he saw, mutely gaping.</p>

<p>"In the middle of a pleasantly sunny little room&mdash;‘it is now
Priscilla’s boudoir,’ Mr. Wimbush remarked parenthetically&mdash;stood
a small circular table of mahogany. Crystal, porcelain, and silver,&mdash;all
the shining apparatus of an elegant meal&mdash;were mirrored in its
polished depths. The carcase of a cold chicken, a bowl of fruit,
a great ham, deeply gashed to its heart of tenderest white and
pink, the brown cannon ball of a cold plum-pudding, a slender
Hock bottle, and a decanter of claret jostled one another for
a place on this festive board. And round the table sat the three
sisters, the three lovely Lapiths&mdash;eating!</p>

<p>"At George’s sudden entrance they had all looked towards the
door, and now they sat, petrified by the same astonishment which
kept George fixed and staring. Georgiana, who sat immediately
facing the door, gazed at him with dark, enormous eyes. Between
the thumb and forefinger of her right hand she was holding a drumstick
of the dismembered chicken; her little finger, elegantly crooked,
stood apart from the rest of her hand. Her mouth was open, but
the drumstick had never reached its destination; it remained,
suspended, frozen, in mid-air. The other two sisters had turned
round to look at the intruder. Caroline still grasped her knife
and fork; Emmeline’s fingers were round the stem of her claret
glass. For what seemed a very long time, George and the three
sisters stared at one another in silence. They were a group of
statues. Then suddenly there was movement. Georgiana dropped her
chicken bone, Caroline’s knife and fork clattered on her plate.
The movement propagated itself, grew more decisive; Emmeline sprang
to her feet, uttering a cry. The wave of panic reached George;
he turned and, mumbling something unintelligible as he went, rushed
out of the room and down the winding stairs. He came to a standstill
in the hall, and there, all by himself in the quiet house, he
began to laugh.</p>

<p>"At luncheon it was noticed that the sisters ate a little more
than usual. Georgiana toyed with some French beans and a spoonful
of calves’-foot jelly. ‘I feel a little stronger to-day,’ she
said to Lord Timpany, when he congratulated her on this increase
of appetite; ‘a little more material,’ she added, with a nervous
laugh. Looking up, she caught George’s eye; a blush suffused her
cheeks and she looked hastily away.</p>

<p>"In the garden that afternoon they found themselves for a moment
alone.</p>

<p>"You won’t tell anyone, George? Promise you won’t tell anyone,’
she implored. ‘It would make us look so ridiculous. And besides,
eating IS unspiritual, isn’t it? Say you won’t tell anyone.’</p>

<p>"‘I will,’ said George brutally. ‘I’ll tell everyone, unless...’</p>

<p>"‘It’s blackmail.’</p>

<p>"‘I don’t care, said George. ‘I’ll give you twenty-four hours
to decide.’</p>

<p>"Lady Lapith was disappointed, of course; she had hoped for better
things&mdash;for Timpany and a coronet. But George, after all, wasn’t
so bad. They were married at the New Year.</p>

<p>"My poor grandfather!" Mr. Wimbush added, as he closed his book
and put away his pince-nez. "Whenever I read in the papers about
oppressed nationalities, I think of him." He relighted his cigar.
"It was a maternal government, highly centralised, and there were
no representative institutions."</p>

<p>Henry Wimbush ceased speaking. In the silence that ensued Ivor’s
whispered commentary on the spirit sketches once more became audible.
Priscilla, who had been dozing, suddenly woke up.</p>

<p>"What?" she said in the startled tones of one newly returned
to consciousness; "what?"</p>

<p>Jenny caught the words. She looked up, smiled, nodded reassuringly.
"It’s about a ham," she said.</p>

<p>"What’s about a ham?"</p>

<p>"What Henry has been reading." She closed the red notebook lying
on her knees and slipped a rubber band round it. "I’m going to
bed," she announced, and got up.</p>

<p>"So am I," said Anne, yawning. But she lacked the energy to rise
from her arm-chair.</p>

<p>The night was hot and oppressive. Round the open windows the
curtains hung unmoving. Ivor, fanning himself with the portrait
of an Astral Being, looked out into the darkness and drew a breath.</p>

<p>"The air’s like wool," he declared.</p>

<p>"It will get cooler after midnight," said Henry Wimbush, and
cautiously added, "perhaps."</p>

<p>"I shan’t sleep, I know."</p>

<p>Priscilla turned her head in his direction; the monumental coiffure
nodded exorbitantly at her slightest movement. "You must make
an effort," she said. "When I can’t sleep, I concentrate my will:
I say, ‘I will sleep, I am asleep!’ And pop! off I go. That’s
the power of thought."</p>

<p>"But does it work on stuffy nights?" Ivor inquired. "I simply
cannot sleep on a stuffy night."</p>

<p>"Nor can I," said Mary, "except out of doors."</p>

<p>"Out of doors! What a wonderful idea!" In the end they decided
to sleep on the towers &mdash;Mary on the western tower, Ivor
on the eastern. There was a flat expanse of leads on each of the
towers, and you could get a mattress through the trap doors that
opened on to them. Under the stars, under the gibbous moon, assuredly
they would sleep. The mattresses were hauled up, sheets and blankets
were spread, and an hour later the two insomniasts, each on his
separate tower, were crying their good-nights across the dividing
gulf.</p>

<p>On Mary the sleep-compelling charm of the open air did not work
with its expected magic. Even through the mattress one could not
fail to be aware that the leads were extremely hard. Then there
were noises: the owls screeched tirelessly, and once, roused by
some unknown terror, all the geese of the farmyard burst into
a sudden frenzy of cackling. The stars and the gibbous moon demanded
to be looked at, and when one meteorite had streaked across the
sky, you could not help waiting, open-eyed and alert, for the
next. Time passed; the moon climbed higher and higher in the sky.
Mary felt less sleepy than she had when she first came out. She
sat up and looked over the parapet. Had Ivor been able to sleep?
she wondered. And as though in answer to her mental question,
from behind the chimney-stack at the farther end of the roof a
white form noiselessly emerged&mdash;a form that, in the moonlight,
was recognisably Ivor’s. Spreading his arms to right and left,
like a tight-rope dancer, he began to walk forward along the roof-tree
of the house. He swayed terrifyingly as he advanced. Mary looked
on speechlessly; perhaps he was walking in his sleep! Suppose
he were to wake up suddenly, now! If she spoke or moved it might
mean his death. She dared look no more, but sank back on her pillows.
She listened intently. For what seemed an immensely long time
there was no sound. Then there was a patter of feet on the tiles,
followed by a scrabbling noise and a whispered "Damn!" And suddenly
Ivor’s head and shoulders appeared above the parapet. One leg
followed, then the other. He was on the leads. Mary pretended
to wake up with a start.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I couldn’t sleep," he explained, "so I came along to see if
you couldn’t. One gets bored by oneself on a tower. Don’t you
find it so?"</p>

<p>It was light before five. Long, narrow clouds barred the east,
their edges bright with orange fire. The sky was pale and watery.
With the mournful scream of a soul in pain, a monstrous peacock,
flying heavily up from below, alighted on the parapet of the tower.
Ivor and Mary started broad awake.</p>

<p>"Catch him!" cried Ivor, jumping up. "We’ll have a feather."
The frightened peacock ran up and down the parapet in an absurd
distress, curtseying and bobbing and clucking; his long tail swung
ponderously back and forth as he turned and turned again. Then
with a flap and swish he launched himself upon the air and sailed
magnificently earthward, with a recovered dignity. But he had
left a trophy. Ivor had his feather, a long-lashed eye of purple
and green, of blue and gold. He handed it to his companion.</p>

<p>"An angel’s feather," he said.</p>

<p>Mary looked at it for a moment, gravely and intently. Her purple
pyjamas clothed her with an ampleness that hid the lines of her
body; she looked like some large, comfortable, unjointed toy,
a sort of Teddy-bear&mdash;but a Teddy bear with an angel’s head, pink
cheeks, and hair like a bell of gold. An angel’s face, the feather
of an angel’s wing...Somehow the whole atmosphere of this sunrise
was rather angelic.</p>

<p>"It’s extraordinary to think of sexual selection," she said at
last, looking up from her contemplation of the miraculous feather.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary!" Ivor echoed. "I select you, you select me. What
luck!"</p>

<p>He put his arm round her shoulders and they stood looking eastward.
The first sunlight had begun to warm and colour the pale light
of the dawn. Mauve pyjamas and white pyjamas; they were a young
and charming couple. The rising sun touched their faces. It was
all extremely symbolic; but then, if you choose to think so, nothing
in this world is not symbolical. Profound and beautiful truth!</p>

<p>"I must be getting back to my tower," said Ivor at last.</p>

<p>"Already?"</p>

<p>"I’m afraid so. The varletry will soon be up and about."</p>

<p>"Ivor..." There was a prolonged and silent farewell.</p>

<p>"And now," said Ivor, "I repeat my tight-rope stunt."</p>

<p>Mary threw her arms round his neck. "You mustn’t, Ivor. It’s
dangerous. Please."</p>

<p>He had to yield at last to her entreaties. "All right," he said,
"I’ll go down through the house and up at the other end."</p>

<p>He vanished through the trap door into the darkness that still
lurked within the shuttered house. A minute later he had reappeared
on the farther tower; he waved his hand, and then sank down, out
of sight, behind the parapet. From below, in the house, came the
thin wasp-like buzzing of an alarum-clock. He had gone back just
in time.</p>
