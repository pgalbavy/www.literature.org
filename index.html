				<h3>New Site Update - May 2020</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>This site fell off the Internet a few years ago after some embarrassing oversights and confusion
					around backups. Don't let this happen to you! Be more careful than we were.</p>
				<p>The original site contents have now been mostly rescued with the wonderful help of
					<a href="https://archive.org/web/">The Wayback Machine</a> and this
					<a href="https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader">Wayback Machine Downloader</a>.
					Thanks to all those who provide these great tools for free.</p>

				<p>After some work and lots of learning about how web technologies have evolved we can
					present this new version of the site. The aim has been to update the look of the site to
					give it a more modern feel, to make it work well on different device types and to improve navigation
					through the library.</p>

				<p>For those interested all the changes are on the client side and based on
					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp">W3.CSS</a>. We have tried to keep the
					client-side
					scripting as simple as possible and to avoid large frameworks. We hope that the behind the scenes
					changes
					will also make it more straightforward to update and add new books.</p>

				<p>There will be continual improvements where possible to your experience and any suggestions are more
					than welcome, even if we cannot promise to act on them.</p>
