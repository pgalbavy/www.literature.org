<p>The instant Lightfoot saw Paddy the Beaver he knew that for the
time being, at least, there was no danger. He knew that Paddy
is one of the shyest of all the little people of the Green Forest
and that when he is found working in the daytime it means that
he has been undisturbed for a long time; otherwise he would work
only at night.</p>

<p>Paddy saw Lightfoot almost as soon as he stepped out on the bank.
He kept right on swimming with the branch of a poplar-tree until
he reached his food pile, which, you know, is in the water. There
he forced the branch down until it was held by other branches
already sunken in the pond. This done, he swam over to where Lightfoot
was watching. "Hello, Lightfoot!" he exclaimed. "You are looking
handsomer than ever. How are you feeling these fine autumn days?"</p>

<p>"Anxious," replied Lightfoot. "I am feeling terribly anxious.
Do you know what day this is?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Paddy, "I don't know what day it is, and I don't
particularly care. It is enough for me that it is one of the finest
days we've had for a long time."</p>

<p>"I wish I could feel that way," said Lightfoot wistfully. "I
wish I could feel that way, Paddy, but I can't. No, Sir, I can't.
You see, this is the first of the most dreadful days in all the
year for me. The hunters started looking for me before Mr. Sun
was really out of bed. At least one hunter did, and I don't doubt
there are others. I fooled that one, but from now to the end of
the hunting season there will not be a single moment of daylight
when I will feel absolutely safe."</p>

<p>Paddy crept out on the bank and chewed a little twig of poplar
thoughtfully. Paddy says he can always think better if he is chewing
something. "That's bad news, Lightfoot. I'm sorry to hear it.
I certainly am sorry to hear it," said Paddy. "Why anybody wants
to hunt such a handsome fellow as you are, I cannot understand.
My, but that's a beautiful set of antlers you have!"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "My, but that's a beautiful set of antlers you
have!"]</p>

<p>"They are the best I've ever had; but do you know, Paddy, I suspect
that they may be one of the reasons I am hunted so," replied Lightfoot
a little sadly. "Good looks are not always to be desired. Have
you seen any hunters around here lately?"</p>

<p>Paddy shook his head. "Not a single hunter," he replied. "I tell
you what it is, Lightfoot, let's be partners for a while. You
stay right around my pond. If I see or hear or smell anything
suspicious, I'll warn you. You do the same for me. Two sets of
eyes, ears and noses are better than one. What do you say, Lightfoot?"</p>

<p>"I'll do it," replied Lightfoot.</p>
