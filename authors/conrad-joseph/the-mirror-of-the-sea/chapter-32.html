<p> The view of ships lying moored in some of the older docks of
London has always suggested to my mind the image of a flock of
swans kept in the flooded backyard of grim tenement houses.  The
flatness of the walls surrounding the dark pool on which they
float brings out wonderfully the flowing grace of the lines on
which a ship’s hull is built.  The lightness of these forms, devised
to meet the winds and the seas, makes, by contrast with the great
piles of bricks, the chains and cables of their moorings appear
very necessary, as if nothing less could prevent them from soaring
upwards and over the roofs.  The least puff of wind stealing round
the corners of the dock buildings stirs these captives fettered
to rigid shores.  It is as if the soul of a ship were impatient
of confinement.  Those masted hulls, relieved of their cargo,
become restless at the slightest hint of the wind’s freedom. 
However tightly moored, they range a little at their berths, swaying
imperceptibly the spire-like assemblages of cordage and spars. 
You can detect their impatience by watching the sway of the mastheads
against the motionless, the soulless gravity of mortar and stones. 
As you pass alongside each hopeless prisoner chained to the quay,
the slight grinding noise of the wooden fenders makes a sound
of angry muttering.  But, after all, it may be good for ships
to go through a period of restraint and repose, as the restraint
and self-communion of inactivity may be good for an unruly soul—not,
indeed, that I mean to say that ships are unruly; on the contrary,
they are faithful creatures, as so many men can testify.  And
faithfulness is a great restraint, the strongest bond laid upon
the self-will of men and ships on this globe of land and sea.</p>

<p>This interval of bondage in the docks rounds each period of a
ship’s life with the sense of accomplished duty, of an effectively
played part in the work of the world.  The dock is the scene of
what the world would think the most serious part in the light,
bounding, swaying life of a ship. But there are docks and docks. 
The ugliness of some docks is appalling. Wild horses would not
drag from me the name of a certain river in the north whose narrow
estuary is inhospitable and dangerous, and whose docks are like
a nightmare of dreariness and misery.  Their dismal shores are
studded thickly with scaffold-like, enormous timber structures,
whose lofty heads are veiled periodically by the infernal gritty
night of a cloud of coal-dust.  The most important ingredient
for getting the world’s work along is distributed there under
the circumstances of the greatest cruelty meted out to helpless
ships.  Shut up in the desolate circuit of these basins, you would
think a free ship would droop and die like a wild bird put into
a dirty cage.  But a ship, perhaps because of her faithfulness
to men, will endure an extraordinary lot of ill-usage. Still,
I have seen ships issue from certain docks like half-dead prisoners
from a dungeon, bedraggled, overcome, wholly disguised in dirt,
and with their men rolling white eyeballs in black and worried
faces raised to a heaven which, in its smoky and soiled aspect,
seemed to reflect the sordidness of the earth below.  One thing,
however, may be said for the docks of the Port of London on both
sides of the river: for all the complaints of their insufficient
equipment, of their obsolete rules, of failure (they say) in the
matter of quick despatch, no ship need ever issue from their gates
in a half-fainting condition.  London is a general cargo port,
as is only proper for the greatest capital of the world to be. 
General cargo ports belong to the aristocracy of the earth’s trading
places, and in that aristocracy London, as it is its way, has
a unique physiognomy.</p>

<p>The absence of picturesqueness cannot be laid to the charge of
the docks opening into the Thames.  For all my unkind comparisons
to swans and backyards, it cannot be denied that each dock or
group of docks along the north side of the river has its own individual
attractiveness.  Beginning with the cosy little St. Katherine’s
Dock, lying overshadowed and black like a quiet pool amongst rocky
crags, through the venerable and sympathetic London Docks, with
not a single line of rails in the whole of their area and the
aroma of spices lingering between its warehouses, with their far-famed
wine-cellars—down through the interesting group of West India
Docks, the fine docks at Blackwall, on past the Galleons Reach
entrance of the Victoria and Albert Docks, right down to the vast
gloom of the great basins in Tilbury, each of those places of
restraint for ships has its own peculiar physiognomy, its own
expression.  And what makes them unique and attractive is their
common trait of being romantic in their usefulness.</p>

<p>In their way they are as romantic as the river they serve is
unlike all the other commercial streams of the world.  The cosiness
of the St. Katherine’s Dock, the old-world air of the London Docks,
remain impressed upon the memory.  The docks down the river, abreast
of Woolwich, are imposing by their proportions and the vast scale
of the ugliness that forms their surroundings—ugliness so picturesque
as to become a delight to the eye.  When one talks of the Thames
docks, "beauty" is a vain word, but romance has lived too long
upon this river not to have thrown a mantle of glamour upon its
banks.</p>

<p>The antiquity of the port appeals to the imagination by the long
chain of adventurous enterprises that had their inception in the
town and floated out into the world on the waters of the river. 
Even the newest of the docks, the Tilbury Dock, shares in the
glamour conferred by historical associations.  Queen Elizabeth
has made one of her progresses down there, not one of her journeys
of pomp and ceremony, but an anxious business progress at a crisis
of national history.  The menace of that time has passed away,
and now Tilbury is known by its docks.  These are very modern,
but their remoteness and isolation upon the Essex marsh, the days
of failure attending their creation, invested them with a romantic
air. Nothing in those days could have been more striking than
the vast, empty basins, surrounded by miles of bare quays and
the ranges of cargo-sheds, where two or three ships seemed lost
like bewitched children in a forest of gaunt, hydraulic cranes. 
One received a wonderful impression of utter abandonment, of wasted
efficiency.  From the first the Tilbury Docks were very efficient
and ready for their task, but they had come, perhaps, too soon
into the field.  A great future lies before Tilbury Docks.  They
shall never fill a long-felt want (in the sacramental phrase that
is applied to railways, tunnels, newspapers, and new editions
of books). They were too early in the field.  The want shall never
be felt because, free of the trammels of the tide, easy of access,
magnificent and desolate, they are already there, prepared to
take and keep the biggest ships that float upon the sea.  They
are worthy of the oldest river port in the world.</p>

<p>And, truth to say, for all the criticisms flung upon the heads
of the dock companies, the other docks of the Thames are no disgrace
to the town with a population greater than that of some commonwealths. 
The growth of London as a well-equipped port has been slow, while
not unworthy of a great capital, of a great centre of distribution. 
It must not be forgotten that London has not the backing of great
industrial districts or great fields of natural exploitation. 
In this it differs from Liverpool, from Cardiff, from Newcastle,
from Glasgow; and therein the Thames differs from the Mersey,
from the Tyne, from the Clyde.  It is an historical river; it
is a romantic stream flowing through the centre of great affairs,
and for all the criticism of the river’s administration, my contention
is that its development has been worthy of its dignity. For a
long time the stream itself could accommodate quite easily the
oversea and coasting traffic.  That was in the days when, in the
part called the Pool, just below London Bridge, the vessels moored
stem and stern in the very strength of the tide formed one solid
mass like an island covered with a forest of gaunt, leafless trees;
and when the trade had grown too big for the river there came
the St. Katherine’s Docks and the London Docks, magnificent undertakings
answering to the need of their time.  The same may be said of
the other artificial lakes full of ships that go in and out upon
this high road to all parts of the world.  The labour of the imperial
waterway goes on from generation to generation, goes on day and
night.  Nothing ever arrests its sleepless industry but the coming
of a heavy fog, which clothes the teeming stream in a mantle of
impenetrable stillness.</p>

<p>After the gradual cessation of all sound and movement on the
faithful river, only the ringing of ships’ bells is heard, mysterious
and muffled in the white vapour from London Bridge right down
to the Nore, for miles and miles in a decrescendo tinkling, to
where the estuary broadens out into the North Sea, and the anchored
ships lie scattered thinly in the shrouded channels between the
sand-banks of the Thames’ mouth.  Through the long and glorious
tale of years of the river’s strenuous service to its people these
are its only breathing times.</p>
