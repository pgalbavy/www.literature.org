<p>It isn't often Sammy Jay worries about anybody but himself. Truth
to tell, he doesn't worry about himself very often. You see, Sammy
is smart, and he knows he is smart. Under that pointed cap of
his are some of the cleverest wits in all the Green Forest. Sammy
seldom worries about himself because he feels quite able to take
care of himself.</p>

<p>But Sammy Jay was worrying now. He was worrying about Lightfoot
the Deer. Yes, Sir, Sammy Jay was worrying about Lightfoot the
Deer. For two days he had been unable to find Lightfoot or any
trace of Lightfoot. But he did find plenty of hunters with terrible
guns. It seemed to him that they were everywhere in the Green
Forest. Sammy began to suspect that one of them must have succeeded
in killing Lightfoot the Deer.</p>

<p>Sammy knew all of Lightfoot's hiding-places. He visited every
one of them. Lightfoot wasn't to be found, and no one whom Sammy
met had seen Lightfoot for two days.</p>

<p>Sammy felt badly. You see, he was very fond of Lightfoot. You
remember it was Sammy who warned Lightfoot of the coming of the
hunter on the morning when the dreadful hunting season began.
Ever since the hunting season had opened, Sammy had done his best
to make trouble for the hunters. Whenever he had found one of
them he had screamed at the top of his voice to warn every one
within hearing just where that hunter was. Once a hunter had lost
his temper and shot at Sammy, but Sammy had suspected that something
of the kind might happen, and he had taken care to keep just out
of reach.</p>

<p>Sammy had known all about the chasing of Lightfoot by the hounds.
Everybody in the Green Forest had known about it. You see, everybody
had heard the voices of those hounds. Once, Lightfoot had passed
right under the tree in which Sammy was sitting, and a few moments
later the two hounds had passed with their noses to the ground
as they followed Lightfoot's trail. That was the last Sammy had
seen of Lightfoot. He had been able to save Lightfoot from the
hunters, but he couldn't save him from the hounds.</p>

<p>The more Sammy thought things over, the more he worried. "I am
afraid those hounds drove him out where a hunter could get a shot
and kill him, or else that they tired him out and killed him themselves,"
thought Sammy. "If he were alive, somebody certainly would have
seen him and nobody has, since the day those hounds chased him.
I declare, I have quite lost my appetite worrying about him. If
Lightfoot is dead, and I am almost sure he is, the Green Forest
will never seem the same."</p>
