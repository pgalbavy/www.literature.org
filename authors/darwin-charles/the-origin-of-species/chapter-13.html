<P>

From the first dawn of
life, all organic beings are found to resemble each other in
descending degrees, so that they can be classed in groups under
groups. This classification is evidently not arbitrary like the
grouping of the stars in constellations. The existence of groups would
have been of simple signification, if one group had been exclusively
fitted to inhabit the land, and another the water; one to feed on
flesh, another on vegetable matter, and so on; but the case is widely
different in nature; for it is notorious how commonly members of even
the same subgroup have different habits. In our second and fourth
chapters, on Variation and on Natural Selection, I have attempted to
show that it is the widely ranging, the much diffused and common, that
is the dominant species belonging to the larger genera, which vary
most. The varieties, or incipient species, thus produced ultimately
become converted, as I believe, into new and distinct species; and
these, on the principle of inheritance, tend to produce other new and
dominant species.  Consequently the groups which are now large, and
which generally include many dominant species, tend to go
on increasing indefinitely in size. I further attempted to show that
from the varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many
and as different places as possible in the economy of nature, there is
a constant tendency in their characters to diverge. This conclusion
was supported by looking at the great diversity of the forms of life
which, in any small area, come into the closest competition, and by
looking to certain facts in naturalisation.
<P>
I attempted also to show that there is a constant tendency in the
forms which are increasing in number and diverging in character, to
supplant and exterminate the less divergent, the less improved, and
preceding forms. I request the reader to turn to the diagram
illustrating the action, as formerly explained, of these several
principles; and he will see that the inevitable result is that the
modified descendants proceeding from one progenitor become broken up
into groups subordinate to groups. In the diagram each letter on the
uppermost line may represent a genus including several species; and
all the genera on this line form together one class, for all have
descended from one ancient but unseen parent, and, consequently, have
inherited something in common. But the three genera on the left hand
have, on this same principle, much in common, and form a sub-family,
distinct from that including the next two genera on the right hand,
which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent.
These five genera have also much, though less, in common; and they
form a family distinct from that including the three genera still
further to the right hand, which diverged at a still earlier period.
And all these genera, descended from (A), form an order distinct from
the genera descended from (I). So that we here have many species
descended from a single progenitor grouped into genera; and the genera
are included in, or subordinate to, sub-families, families, and
orders, all united into one class. Thus, the grand fact in natural
history of the subordination of group under group, which, from its
familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my
judgement fully explained.
<P>
Naturalists try to arrange the species, genera, and families in
each class, on what is called the Natural System. But what is
meant by this system? Some authors look at it merely as a
scheme for arranging together those living objects which are most
alike, and for separating those which are most unlike; or as an
artificial means for enunciating, as briefly as possible, general
propositions,   that is, by one sentence to give the characters
common, for instance, to all mammals, by another those common to all
carnivora, by another those common to the dog-genus, and then by
adding a single sentence, a full description is given of each kind of
dog.  The ingenuity and utility of this system are indisputable.  But
many naturalists think that something more is meant by the Natural
System; they believe that it reveals the plan of the Creator; but
unless it be specified whether order in time or space, or what else is
meant by the plan of the Creator, it seems to me that nothing is thus
added to our knowledge. Such expressions as that famous one of
Linnaeus, and which we often meet with in a more or less concealed
form, that the characters do not make the genus, but that the genus
gives the characters, seem to imply that something more is included in
our classification, than mere resemblance. I believe that something
more is included; and that propinquity of descent,   the only
known cause of the similarity of organic beings,   is the bond,
hidden as it is by various degrees of modification, which is partially
revealed to us by our classifications.
<P>
Let us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the
difficulties which are encountered on the view that classification
either gives some unknown plan of creation, or is simply a scheme for
enunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms
most like each other. It might have been thought (and was in ancient
times thought) that those parts of the structure which determined the
habits of life, and the general place of each being in the economy of
nature, would be of very high importance in classification. Nothing
can be more false. No one regards the external similarity of a mouse
to a shrew, of a dugong to a whale, of a whale to a fish, as of any
importance.  These resemblances, though so intimately connected with
the whole life of the being, are ranked as merely `adaptive or
analogical characters;' but to the consideration of these resemblances
we shall have to recur. It may even be given as a general rule, that
the less any part of the organisation is concerned with
special habits, the more important it becomes for classification. As
an instance: Owen, in speaking of the dugong, says, `The generative
organs being those which are most remotely related to the habits and
food of an animal, I have always regarded as affording very clear
indications of its true affinities. We are least likely in the
modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an
essential character.' So with plants, how remarkable it is that the
organs of vegetation, on which their whole life depends, are of little
signification, excepting in the first main divisions; whereas the
organs of reproduction, with their product the seed, are of paramount
importance!
<P>
We must not, therefore, in classifying, trust to resemblances in
parts of the organisation, however important they may be for the
welfare of the being in relation to the outer world. Perhaps from this
cause it has partly arisen, that almost all naturalists lay the
greatest stress on resemblances in organs of high vital or
physiological importance. No doubt this view of the classificatory
importance of organs which are important is generally, but by no means
always, true. But their importance for classification, I believe,
depends on their greater constancy throughout large groups of species;
and this constancy depends on such organs having generally been
subjected to less change in the adaptation of the species to their
conditions of life. That the mere physiological importance of an organ
does not determine the classificatory value, is almost shown by the
one fact, that in allied groups, in which the same organ, as we have
every reason to suppose, has nearly the same physiological value, its
classificatory value is widely different. No naturalist can have
worked at any group without being struck with this fact; and it has
been most fully acknowledged in the writings of almost every author.
It will suffice to quote the highest authority, Robert Brown, who in
speaking of certain organs in the Proteaceae, says their generic
importance, `like that of all their parts, not only in this but, as I
apprehend, in every natural family, is very unequal, and in some cases
seems to be entirely lost.' Again in another work he says, the genera
of the Connaraceae `differ in having one or more ovaria, in the
existence or absence of albumen, in the imbricate or
valvular aestivation. Any one of these characters singly is frequently
of more than generic importance, though here even when all taken
together they appear insufficient to separate Cnestis from Connarus.'
To give an example amongst insects, in one great division of the
Hymenoptera, the antennae, as Westwood has remarked, are most constant
in structure; in another division they differ much, and the
differences are of quite subordinate value in classification; yet no
one probably will say that the antennae in these two divisions of the
same order are of unequal physiological importance.  Any number of
instances could be given of the varying importance for classification
of the same important organ within the same group of beings.
<P>
Again, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of
high physiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in
this condition are often of high value in classification. No one will
dispute that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young
ruminants, and certain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly
serviceable in exhibiting the close affinity between Ruminants and
Pachyderms. Robert Brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the
rudimentary florets are of the highest importance in the
classification of the Grasses.
<P>
Numerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts
which must be considered of very trifling physiological importance,
but which are universally admitted as highly serviceable in the
definition of whole groups. For instance, whether or not there is an
open passage from the nostrils to the mouth, the only character,
according to Owen, which absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles
  the inflection of the angle of the jaws in Marsupials --
the manner in which the wings of insects are folded   mere
colour in certain Algae   mere pubescence on parts of the flower
in grasses   the nature of the dermal covering, as hair or
feathers, in the Vertebrata. If the Ornithorhynchus had been covered
with feathers instead of hair, this external and trifling character
would, I think, have been considered by naturalists as important an
aid in determining the degree of affinity of this strange creature to
birds and reptiles, as an approach in structure in any one internal
and important organ.
<P>
The importance, for classification, of trifling characters, mainly
depends on their being correlated with several other
characters of more or less importance. The value indeed of an
aggregate of characters is very evident in natural history. Hence, as
has often been remarked, a species may depart from its allies in
several characters, both of high physiological importance and of
almost universal prevalence, and yet leave us in no doubt where it
should be ranked. Hence, also, it has been found, that a
classification founded on any single character, however important that
may be, has always failed; for no part of the organisation is
universally constant. The importance of an aggregate of characters,
even when none are important, alone explains, I think, that saying of
Linnaeus, that the characters do not give the genus, but the genus
gives the characters; for this saying seems founded on an appreciation
of many trifling points of resemblance, too slight to be defined.
Certain plants, belonging to the Malpighiaceae, bear perfect and
degraded flowers; in the latter, as A. de Jussieu has remarked, `the
greater number of the characters proper to the species, to the genus,
to the family, to the class, disappear, and thus laugh at our
classification.'  But when Aspicarpa produced in France, during
several years, only degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a
number of the most important points of structure from the proper type
of the order, yet M. Richard sagaciously saw, as Jussieu observes,
that this genus should still be retained amongst the Malpighiaceae.
This case seems to me well to illustrate the spirit with which our
classifications are sometimes necessarily founded.
<P>
Practically when naturalists are at work, they do not trouble
themselves about the physiological value of the characters which they
use in defining a group, or in allocating any particular species. If
they find a character nearly uniform, and common to a great number of
forms, and not common to others, they use it as one of high value; if
common to some lesser number, they use it as of subordinate value.
This principle has been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be
the true one; and by none more clearly than by that excellent
botanist, Aug. St. Hilaire. If certain characters are always found
correlated with others, though no apparent bond of connexion can be
discovered between them, especial value is set on them. As in most
groups of animals, important organs, such as those for
propelling the blood, or for a&euml;rating it, or those for propagating the
race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as highly
serviceable in classification; but in some groups of animals all
these, the most important vital organs, are found to offer characters
of quite subordinate value.
<P>
We can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of
equal importance with those derived from the adult, for our
classifications of course include all ages of each species. But it is
by no means obvious, on the ordinary view, why the structure of the
embryo should be more important for this purpose than that of the
adult, which alone plays its full part in the economy of nature. Yet
it has been strongly urged by those great naturalists, Milne Edwards
and Agassiz, that embryonic characters are the most important of any
in the classification of animals; and this doctrine has very generally
been admitted as true. The same fact holds good with flowering plants,
of which the two main divisions have been founded on characters
derived from the embryo,   on the number and position of the
embryonic leaves or cotyledons, and on the mode of development of the
plumule and radicle. In our discussion on embryology, we shall see why
such characters are so valuable, on the view of classification tacitly
including the idea of descent.
<P>
Our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of
affinities. Nothing can be easier than to define a number of
characters common to all birds; but in the case of crustaceans, such
definition has hitherto been found impossible. There are crustaceans
at the opposite ends of the series, which have hardly a character in
common; yet the species at both ends, from being plainly allied to
others, and these to others, and so onwards, can be recognised as
unequivocally belonging to this, and to no other class of the
Articulata.
<P>
Geographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps not
quite logically, in classification, more especially in very large
groups of closely allied forms.  Temminck insists on the utility or
even necessity of this practice in certain groups of birds; and it has
been followed by several entomologists and botanists.
<P>
Finally, with respect to the comparative value of the
various groups of species, such as orders, sub-orders, families,
sub-families, and genera, they seem to be, at least at present, almost
arbitrary. Several of the best botanists, such as Mr Bentham and
others, have strongly insisted on their arbitrary value. Instances
could be given amongst plants and insects, of a group of forms, first
ranked by practised naturalists as only a genus, and then raised to
the rank of a sub-family or family; and this has been done, not
because further research has detected important structural
differences, at first overlooked, but because numerous allied species,
with slightly different grades of difference, have been subsequently
discovered.
<P>
All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification
are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that
the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the
characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between
any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a
common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is
genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which
naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan
of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, and the mere
putting together and separating objects more or less alike.
<P>
But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe that the
<I>arrangement</I> of the groups within each class, in due subordination and
relation to the other groups, must be strictly genealogical in order
to be natural; but that the <I>amount</I> of difference in the several
branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their
common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different
degrees of modification which they have undergone; and this is
expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera, families,
sections, or orders. The reader will best understand what is meant, if
he will take the trouble of referring to the diagram in the fourth
chapter. We will suppose the letters A to L to represent allied
genera, which lived during the Silurian epoch, and these have
descended from a species which existed at an unknown anterior period.
Species of three of these genera (A, F, and I) have transmitted
modified descendants to the present day, represented by
the fifteen genera (a14 to z14)
on the uppermost horizontal line. Now all these modified descendants
from a single species, are represented as related in blood or descent
to the same degree; they may metaphorically be called cousins to the
same millionth degree; yet they differ widely and in different degrees
from each other. The forms descended from A, now broken up into two or
three families, constitute a distinct order from those descended from
I, also broken up into two families.  Nor can the existing species,
descended from A, be ranked in the same genus with the parent A; or
those from I, with the parent I. But the existing genus F14 may be supposed to have been but slightly modified;
and it will then rank with the parent-genus F; just as some few still
living organic beings belong to Silurian genera. So that the amount or
value of the differences between organic beings all related to each
other in the same degree in blood, has come to be widely different.
Nevertheless their genealogical <I>arrangement</I> 
remains strictly true, not
only at the present time, but at each successive period of descent.
All the modified descendants from A will have inherited something in
common from their common parent, as will all the descendants from I;
so will it be with each subordinate branch of descendants, at each
successive period. If, however, we choose to suppose that any of the
descendants of A or of I have been so much modified as to have more or
less completely lost traces of their parentage, in this case, their
places in a natural classification will have been more or less
completely lost,   as sometimes seems to have occurred with
existing organisms. All the descendants of the genus F, along its
whole line of descent, are supposed to have been but little modified,
and they yet form a single genus. But this genus, though much
isolated, will still occupy its proper intermediate position; for F
originally was intermediate in character between A and I, and the
several genera descended from these two genera will have inherited to
a certain extent their characters. This natural arrangement is shown,
as far as is possible on paper, in the diagram, but in much too simple
a manner. If a branching diagram had not been used, and only the names
of the groups had been written in a linear series, it would have been
still less possible to have given a natural arrangement;
and it is notoriously not possible to represent in a series, on a flat
surface, the affinities which we discover in nature amongst the beings
of the same group.  Thus, on the view which I hold, the natural system
is genealogical in its arrangement, like a pedigree; but the degrees
of modification which the different groups have undergone, have to be
expressed by ranking them under different so-called genera,
sub-families, families, sections, orders, and classes.
<P>
It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by
taking the case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree of
mankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford
the best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout
the world; and if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and
slowly changing dialects, had to be included, such an arrangement
would, I think, be the only possible one. Yet it might be that some
very ancient language had altered little, and had given rise to few
new languages, whilst others (owing to the spreading and subsequent
isolation and states of civilisation of the several races, descended
from a common race) had altered much, and had given rise to many new
languages and dialects.  The various degrees of difference in the
languages from the same stock, would have to be expressed by groups
subordinate to groups; but the proper or even only possible
arrangement would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly
natural, as it would connect together all languages, extinct and
modern, by the closest affinities, and would give the filiation and
origin of each tongue.
<P>
In confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification
of varieties, which are believed or known to have descended from one
species. These are grouped under species, with sub-varieties under
varieties; and with our domestic productions, several other grades of
difference are requisite, as we have seen with pigeons. The origin of
the existence of groups subordinate to groups, is the same with
varieties as with species, namely, closeness of descent with various
degrees of modification. Nearly the same rules are followed in
classifying varieties, as with species. Authors have insisted on the
necessity of classing varieties on a natural instead of an artificial
system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two
varieties of the pine-apple together, merely because their fruit,
though the most important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one
puts the swedish and common turnips together, though the esculent and
thickened stems are so similar. Whatever part is found to be most
constant, is used in classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist
Marshall says the horns are very useful for this purpose with cattle,
because they are less variable than the shape or colour of the body,
&amp;c.; whereas with sheep the horns are much less serviceable,
because less constant. In classing varieties, I apprehend if we had a
real pedigree, a genealogical classification would be universally
preferred; and it has been attempted by some authors. For we might
feel sure, whether there had been more or less modification, the
principle of inheritance would keep the forms together which were
allied in the greatest number of points. In tumbler pigeons, though
some sub-varieties differ from the others in the important character
of having a longer beak, yet all are kept together from having the
common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has nearly or
quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any reasoning or thinking
on the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because
allied in blood and alike in some other respects. If it could be
proved that the Hottentot had descended from the Negro, I think he
would be classed under the Negro group, however much he might differ
in colour and other important characters from negroes.
<P>
With species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact
brought descent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest
grade, or that of a species, the two sexes; and how enormously these
sometimes differ in the most important characters, is known to every
naturalist: scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the
males and hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes, when adult, and yet no
one dreams of separating them. The naturalist includes as one species
the several larval stages of the same individual, however much they
may differ from each other and from the adult; as he likewise includes
the so-called alternate generations of Steenstrup, which can only in a
technical sense be considered as the same individual. He includes
monsters; he includes varieties, not solely because they
closely resemble the parent-form, but because they are descended from
it. He who believes that the cowslip is descended from the primrose,
or conversely, ranks them together as a single species, and gives a
single definition. As soon as three Orchidean forms (Monochanthus,
Myanthus, and Catasetum), which had previously been ranked as three
distinct genera, were known to be sometimes produced on the same
spike, they were immediately included as a single species. But it may
be asked, what ought we to do, if it could be proved that one species
of kangaroo had been produced, by a long course of modification, from
a bear? Ought we to rank this one species with bears, and what should
we do with the other species?  The supposition is of course
preposterous; and I might answer by the <I>argumentum ad hominem</I>, and ask
what should be done if a perfect kangaroo were seen to come out of the
womb of a bear? According to all analogy, it would be ranked with
bears; but then assuredly all the other species of the kangaroo family
would have to be classed under the bear genus. The whole case is
preposterous; for where there has been close descent in common, there
will certainly be close resemblance or affinity.
<P>
As descent has universally been used in classing together the
individuals of the same species, though the males and females and
larvae are sometimes extremely different; and as it has been used in
classing varieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes a
considerable amount of modification, may not this same element of
descent have been unconsciously used in grouping species under genera,
and genera under higher groups, though in these cases the modification
has been greater in degree, and has taken a longer time to complete? I
believe it has thus been unconsciously used; and only thus can I
understand the several rules and guides which have been followed by
our best systematists. We have no written pedigrees; we have to make
out community of descent by resemblances of any kind.  Therefore we
choose those characters which, as far as we can judge, are the least
likely to have been modified in relation to the conditions of life to
which each species has been recently exposed. Rudimentary structures
on this view are as good as, or even sometimes better than, other
parts of the organisation. We care not how trifling a
character may be   let it be the mere inflection of the angle of
the jaw, the manner in which an insect's wing is folded, whether the
skin be covered by hair or feathers   if it prevail throughout
many and different species, especially those having very different
habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for its
presence in so many forms with such different habits, only by its
inheritance from a common parent. We may err in this respect in regard
to single points of structure, but when several characters, let them
be ever so trifling, occur together throughout a large group of beings
having different habits, we may feel almost sure, on the theory of
descent, that these characters have been inherited from a common
ancestor.  And we know that such correlated or aggregated characters
have especial value in classification.
<P>
We can understand why a species or a group of species may depart,
in several of its most important characteristics, from its allies, and
yet be safely classed with them. This may be safely done, and is often
done, as long as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever
so unimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community of descent. Let
two forms have not a single character in common, yet if these extreme
forms are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups, we may
at once infer their community of descent, and we put them all into the
same class. As we find organs of high physiological importance  
those which serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions
of existence   are generally the most constant, we attach
especial value to them; but if these same organs, in another group or
section of a group, are found to differ much, we at once value them
less in our classification. We shall hereafter, I think, clearly see
why embryological characters are of such high classificatory
importance.  Geographical distribution may sometimes be brought
usefully into play in classing large and widely-distributed genera,
because all the species of the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and
isolated region, have in all probability descended from the same
parents.
<P>
We can understand, on these views, the very important distinction
between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances.
Lamarck first called attention to this distinction, and
he has been ably followed by Macleay and others. The resemblance, in
the shape of the body and in the fin-like anterior limbs, between the
dugong, which is a pachydermatous animal, and the whale, and between
both these mammals and fishes, is analogical. Amongst insects there
are innumerable instances: thus Linnaeus, misled by external
appearances, actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth. We see
something of the same kind even in our domestic varieties, as in the
thickened stems of the common and swedish turnip. The resemblance of
the greyhound and racehorse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies
which have been drawn by some authors between very distinct animals.
On my view of characters being of real importance for classification,
only in so far as they reveal descent, we can clearly understand why
analogical or adaptive character, although of the utmost importance to
the welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the systematist. For
animals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent, may readily
become adapted to similar conditions, and thus assume a close external
resemblance; but such resemblances will not reveal   will rather
tend to conceal their blood-relationship to their proper lines of
descent. We can also understand the apparent paradox, that the very
same characters are analogical when one class or order is compared
with another, but give true affinities when the members of the same
class or order are compared one with another: thus the shape of the
body and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared
with fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through
the water; but the shape of the body and fin-like limbs serve as
characters exhibiting true affinity between the several members of the
whale family; for these cetaceans agree in so many characters, great
and small, that we cannot doubt that they have inherited their general
shape of body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor. So it is
with fishes.
<P>
As members of distinct classes have often been adapted by
successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar
circumstances,   to inhabit for instance the three elements of
land, air, and water,   we can perhaps understand how it is that
a numerical parallelism has sometimes been observed between the
sub-groups in distinct classes. A naturalist, struck by a parallelism
of this nature in any one class, by arbitrarily raising
or sinking the value of the groups in other classes (and all our
experience shows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary),
could easily extend the parallelism over a wide range; and thus the
septenary, quinary, quaternary, and ternary classifications have
probably arisen.
<P>
As the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the
larger genera, tend to inherit the advantages, which made the groups
to which they belong large and their parents dominant, they are almost
sure to spread widely, and to seize on more and more places in the
economy of nature. The larger and more dominant groups thus tend to go
on increasing in size; and they consequently supplant many smaller and
feebler groups. Thus we can account for the fact that all organisms,
recent and extinct, are included under a few great orders, under still
fewer classes, and all in one great natural system. As showing how few
the higher groups are in number, and how widely spread they are
throughout the world, the fact is striking, that the discovery of
Australia has not added a single insect belonging to a new order; and
that in the vegetable kingdom, as I learn from Dr. Hooker, it has added
only two or three orders of small size.
<P>
In the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on the
principle of each group having generally diverged much in character
during the long-continued process of modification, how it is that the
more ancient forms of life often present characters in some slight
degree intermediate between existing groups.  A few old and
intermediate parent-forms having occasionally transmitted to the
present day descendants but little modified, will give to us our
so-called osculant or aberrant groups. The more aberrant any form is,
the greater must be the number of connecting forms which on my theory
have been exterminated and utterly lost. And we have some evidence of
aberrant forms having suffered severely from extinction, for they are
generally represented by extremely few species; and such species as do
occur are generally very distinct from each other, which again implies
extinction. The genera Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, for example,
would not have been less aberrant had each been represented by a dozen
species instead of by a single one; but such richness in
species, as I find after some investigation, does not commonly fall to
the lot of aberrant genera. We can, I think, account for this fact
only by looking at aberrant forms as failing groups conquered by more
successful competitors, with a few members preserved by some unusual
coincidence of favourable circumstances.
<P>
Mr. Waterhouse has remarked that, when a member belonging to one
group of animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group, this
affinity in most cases is general and not special: thus, according to
Mr. Waterhouse, of all Rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to
Marsupials; but in the points in which it approaches this order, its
relations are general, and not to any one marsupial species more than
to another. As the points of affinity of the bizcacha to Marsupials
are believed to be real and not merely adaptive, they are due on my
theory to inheritance in common. Therefore we must suppose either that
all Rodents, including the bizcacha, branched off from some very
ancient Marsupial, which will have had a character in some degree
intermediate with respect to all existing Marsupials; or that both
Rodents and Marsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and that
both groups have since undergone much modification in divergent
directions. On either view we may suppose that the bizcacha has
retained, by inheritance, more of the character of its ancient
progenitor than have other Rodents; and therefore it will not be
specially related to any one existing Marsupial, but indirectly to all
or nearly all Marsupials, from having partially retained the character
of their common progenitor, or of an early member of the group. On the
other hand, of all Marsupials, as Mr. Waterhouse has remarked, the
phascolomys resembles most nearly, not any one species, but the
general order of Rodents. In this case, however, it may be strongly
suspected that the resemblance is only analogical, owing to the
phascolomys having become adapted to habits like those of a Rodent.
The elder De Candolle has made nearly similar observations on the
general nature of the affinities of distinct orders of plants.
<P>
On the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in
character of the species descended from a common parent,
together with their retention by inheritance of some characters in
common, we can understand the excessively complex and radiating
affinities by which all the members of the same family or higher group
are connected together. For the common parent of a whole family of
species, now broken up by extinction into distinct groups and
sub-groups, will have transmitted some of its characters, modified in
various ways and degrees, to all; and the several species will
consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of affinity
of various lengths (as may be seen in the diagram so often referred
to), mounting up through many predecessors. As it is difficult to show
the blood-relationship between the numerous kindred of any ancient and
noble family, even by the aid of a genealogical tree, and almost
impossible to do this without this aid, we can understand the
extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in
describing, without the aid of a diagram, the various affinities which
they perceive between the many living and extinct members of the same
great natural class.
<P>
Extinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an
important part in defining and widening the intervals between the
several groups in each class. We may thus account even for the
distinctness of whole classes from each other   for instance, of
birds from all other vertebrate animals   by the belief that
many ancient forms of life have been utterly lost, through which the
early progenitors of birds were formerly connected with the early
progenitors of the other vertebrate classes. There has been less
entire extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes
with batrachians. There has been still less in some other classes, as
in that of the Crustacea, for here the most wonderfully diverse forms
are still tied together by a long, but broken, chain of affinities.
Extinction has only separated groups: it has by no means made them;
for if every form which has ever lived on this earth were suddenly to
reappear, though it would be quite impossible to give definitions by
which each group could be distinguished from other groups, as all
would blend together by steps as fine as those between the finest
existing varieties, nevertheless a natural classification, or at least
a natural arrangement, would be possible. We shall see this by turning
to the diagram: the letters, A to L, may represent eleven
Silurian genera, some of which have produced large groups of modified
descendants. Every intermediate link between these eleven genera and
their primordial parent, and every intermediate link in each branch
and sub-branch of their descendants, may be supposed to be still
alive; and the links to be as fine as those between the finest
varieties. In this case it would be quite impossible to give any
definition by which the several members of the several groups could be
distinguished from their more immediate parents; or these parents from
their ancient and unknown progenitor. Yet the natural arrangement in
the diagram would still hold good; and, on the principle of
inheritance, all the forms descended from A, or from I, would have
something in common. In a tree we can specify this or that branch,
though at the actual fork the two unite and blend together. We could
not, as I have said, define the several groups; but we could pick out
types, or forms, representing most of the characters of each group,
whether large or small, and thus give a general idea of the value of
the differences between them. This is what we should be driven to, if
we were ever to succeed in collecting all the forms in any class which
have lived throughout all time and space. We shall certainly never
succeed in making so perfect a collection: nevertheless, in certain
classes, we are tending in this direction; and Milne Edwards has
lately insisted, in an able paper, on the high importance of looking
to types, whether or not we can separate and define the groups to
which such types belong.
<P>
Finally, we have seen that natural selection, which results from
the struggle for existence, and which almost inevitably induces
extinction and divergence of character in the many descendants from
one dominant parent-species, explains that great and universal feature
in the affinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination
in group under group. We use the element of descent in classing the
individuals of both sexes and of all ages, although having few
characters in common, under one species; we use descent in classing
acknowledged varieties, however different they may be from their
parent; and I believe this element of descent is the hidden bond of
connexion which naturalists have sought under the term of the Natural
System.  On this idea of the natural system being, in so
far as it has been perfected, genealogical in its arrangement, with
the grades of difference between the descendants from a common parent,
expressed by the terms genera, families, orders, &amp;c., we can
understand the rules which we are compelled to follow in our
classification. We can understand why we value certain resemblances
far more than others; why we are permitted to use rudimentary and
useless organs, or others of trifling physiological importance; why,
in comparing one group with a distinct group, we summarily reject
analogical or adaptive characters, and yet use these same characters
within the limits of the same group. We can clearly see how it is that
all living and extinct forms can be grouped together in one great
system; and how the several members of each class are connected
together by the most complex and radiating lines of affinities. We
shall never, probably, disentangle the inextricable web of affinities
between the members of any one class; but when we have a distinct
object in view, and do not look to some unknown plan of creation, we
may hope to make sure but slow progress.
<P>
<H4>Morphology</H4>
<P>
We have seen that the
members of the same class, independently of their habits of life,
resemble each other in the general plan of their organisation. This
resemblance is often expressed by the term `unity of type;' or by
saying that the several parts and organs in the different species of
the class are homologous. The whole subject is included under the
general name of Morphology.  This is the most interesting department
of natural history, and may be said to be its very soul. What can be
more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of
a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise,
and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same
pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative
positions? Geoffroy St Hilaire has insisted strongly on the high
importance of relative connexion in homologous organs: the parts may
change to almost any extent in form and size, and yet they always
remain connected together in the same order. We never find, for
instance, the bones of the arm and forearm, or of the thigh and leg,
transposed. Hence the same names can be given to the
homologous bones in widely different animals.  We see the same great
law in the construction of the mouths of insects: what can be more
different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a sphinx-moth,
the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws of a
beetle?   yet all these organs, serving for such different
purposes, are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper
lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae. Analogous laws govern the
construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans. So it is with the
flowers of plants.
<P>
Nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this
similarity of pattern in members of the same class, by utility or by
the doctrine of final causes. The hopelessness of the attempt has been
expressly admitted by Owen in his most interesting work on the `Nature
of Limbs.' On the ordinary view of the independent creation of each
being, we can only say that so it is;   that it has so pleased
the Creator to construct each animal and plant.
<P>
The explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection
of successive slight modifications,   each modification being
profitable in some way to the modified form, but often affecting by
correlation of growth other parts of the organisation. In changes of
this nature, there will be little or no tendency to modify the
original pattern, or to transpose parts. The bones of a limb might be
shortened and widened to any extent, and become gradually enveloped in
thick membrane, so as to serve as a fin; or a webbed foot might have
all its bones, or certain bones, lengthened to any extent, and the
membrane connecting them increased to any extent, so as to serve as a
wing: yet in all this great amount of modification there will be no
tendency to alter the framework of bones or the relative connexion of
the several parts. If we suppose that the ancient progenitor, the
archetype as it may be called, of all mammals, had its limbs
constructed on the existing general pattern, for whatever purpose they
served, we can at once perceive the plain signification of the
homologous construction of the limbs throughout the whole class. So
with the mouths of insects, we have only to suppose that their common
progenitor had an upper lip, mandibles, and two pair of
maxillae, these parts being perhaps very simple in form; and then
natural selection will account for the infinite diversity in structure
and function of the mouths of insects. Nevertheless, it is conceivable
that the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as
to be finally lost, by the atrophy and ultimately by the complete
abortion of certain parts, by the soldering together of other parts,
and by the doubling or multiplication of others,   variations
which we know to be within the limits of possibility. In the paddles
of the extinct gigantic sea-lizards, and in the mouths of certain
suctorial crustaceans, the general pattern seems to have been thus to
a certain extent obscured.
<P>
There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject;
namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a
class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual.
Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous
with   that is correspond in number and in relative connexion
with   the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The
anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and
articulate classes are plainly homologous. We see the same law in
comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It is
familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position
of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate
structure, are intelligible in the view that they consist of
metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we
often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being
transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic
crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs
which when mature become extremely different, are at an early stage of
growth exactly alike.
<P>
How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation!
Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous
and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? As Owen has remarked,
the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the
act of parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same
construction in the skulls of birds. Why should similar bones have
been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a
bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? Why should
one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many
parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with
many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens,
and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely
different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern ?
<P>
On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer
these questions. In the vertebrata, we see a series of internal
vertebrae bearing certain processes and appendages; in the articulata,
we see the body divided into a series of segments, bearing external
appendages; and in flowering plants, we see a series of successive
spiral whorls of leaves. An indefinite repetition of the same part or
organ is the common characteristic (as Owen has observed) of all low
or little-modified forms; therefore we may readily believe that the
unknown progenitor of the vertebrata possessed many vertebrae; the
unknown progenitor of the articulata, many segments; and the unknown
progenitor of flowering plants, many spiral whorls of leaves. We have
formerly seen that parts many times repeated are eminently liable to
vary in number and structure; consequently it is quite probable that
natural selection, during a long-continued course of modification,
should have seized on a certain number of the primordially similar
elements, many times repeated, and have adapted them to the most
diverse purposes. And as the whole amount of modification will have
been effected by slight successive steps, we need not wonder at
discovering in such parts or organs, a certain degree of fundamental
resemblance, retained by the strong principle of inheritance.
<P>
In the great class of molluscs, though we can homologise the parts
of one species with those of another and distinct species, we can
indicate but few serial homologies; that is, we are seldom enabled to
say that one part or organ is homologous with another in the same
individual. And we can understand this fact; for in molluscs, even in
the lowest members of the class, we do not find nearly so much
indefinite repetition of any one part, as we find in the other great
classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
<P>
Naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of
metamorphosed vertebrae: the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the
stamens and pistils of flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would
in these cases probably be more correct, as Professor Huxley has
remarked, to speak of both skull and vertebrae, both jaws and legs,
&amp;c.,   as having been metamorphosed, not one from the other,
but from some common element. Naturalists, however, use such language
only in a metaphorical sense: they are far from meaning that during a
long course of descent, primordial organs of any kind  
vertebrae in the one case and legs in the other   have actually
been modified into skulls or jaws. Yet so strong is the appearance of
a modification of this nature having occurred, that naturalists can
hardly avoid employing language having this plain signification. On my
view these terms may be used literally; and the wonderful fact of the
jaws, for instance, of a crab retaining numerous characters, which
they would probably have retained through inheritance, if they had
really been metamorphosed during a long course of descent from true
legs, or from some simple appendage, is explained.
</P>
<H4>Embryology</H4> 
<P>
It has already been
casually remarked that certain organs in the individual, which when
mature become widely different and serve for different purposes, are
in the embryo exactly alike. The embryos, also, of distinct animals
within the same class are often strikingly similar: a better proof of
this cannot be given, than a circumstance mentioned by Agassiz,
namely, that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of some vertebrate
animal, he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal, bird, or
reptile. The vermiform larvae of moths, flies, beetles, &amp;c.,
resemble each other much more closely than do the mature insects; but
in the case of larvae, the embryos are active, and have been adapted
for special lines of life.  A trace of the law of embryonic
resemblance, sometimes lasts till a rather late age: thus birds of the
same genus, and of closely allied genera, often resemble each other in
their first and second plumage; as we see in the spotted feathers in
the thrush group. In the cat tribe, most of the species are striped or
spotted in lines; and stripes can be plainly distinguished in the
whelp of the lion. We occasionally though rarely see something of this
kind in plants: thus the embryonic leaves of the ulex or
furze, and the first leaves of the phyllodineous acaceas, are pinnate
or divided like the ordinary leaves of the leguminosae.
<P>
The points of structure, in which the embryos of widely different
animals of the same class resemble each other, often have no direct
relation to their conditions of existence. We cannot, for instance,
suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like
course of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar
conditions,   in the young mammal which is nourished in the womb
of its mother, in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest, and
in the spawn of a frog under water. We have no more reason to believe
in such a relation, than we have to believe that the same bones in the
hand of a man, wing of a bat, and fin of a porpoise, are related to
similar conditions of life. No one will suppose that the stripes on
the whelp of a lion, or the spots on the young blackbird, are of any
use to these animals, or are related to the conditions to which they
are exposed.
<P>
The case, however, is different when an animal during any part of
its embryonic career is active, and has to provide for itself. The
period of activity may come on earlier or later in life; but whenever
it comes on, the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is
just as perfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal. From such
special adaptations, the similarity of the larvae or active embryos of
allied animals is sometimes much obscured; and cases could be given of
the larvae of two species, or of two groups of species, differing
quite as much, or even more, from each other than do their adult
parents. In most cases, however, the larvae, though active, still obey
more or less closely the law of common embryonic resemblance.
Cirripedes afford a good instance of this: even the illustrious Cuvier
did not perceive that a barnacle was, as it certainly is, a
crustacean; but a glance at the larva shows this to be the case in an
unmistakeable manner. So again the two main divisions of cirripedes,
the pedunculated and sessile, which differ widely in external
appearance, have larvae in all their several stages barely
distinguishable.
<P>
The embryo in the course of development generally rises in
organisation: I use this expression, though I am aware that it
is hardly possible to define clearly what is meant by the
organisation being higher or lower. But no one probably will dispute
that the butterfly is higher than the caterpillar. In some cases,
however, the mature animal is generally considered as lower in the
scale than the larva, as with certain parasitic crustaceans. To refer
once again to cirripedes: the larvae in the first stage have three
pairs of legs, a very simple single eye, and a probosciformed mouth,
with which they feed largely, for they increase much in size. In the
second stage, answering to the chrysalis stage of butterflies, they
have six pairs of beautifully constructed natatory legs, a pair of
magnificent compound eyes, and extremely complex antennae; but they
have a closed and imperfect mouth, and cannot feed: their function at
this stage is, to search by their well-developed organs of sense, and
to reach by their active powers of swimming, a proper place on which
to become attached and to undergo their final metamorphosis. When this
is completed they are fixed for life: their legs are now converted
into prehensile organs; they again obtain a well-constructed mouth;
but they have no antennae, and their two eyes are now reconverted into
a minute, single, and very simple eye-spot. In this last and complete
state, cirripedes may be considered as either more highly or more
lowly organised than they were in the larval condition. But in some
genera the larvae become developed either into hermaphrodites having
the ordinary structure, or into what I have called complemental males:
and in the latter, the development has assuredly been retrograde; for
the male is a mere sack, which lives for a short time, and is
destitute of mouth, stomach, or other organ of importance, excepting
for reproduction.
<P>
We are so much accustomed to see differences in structure between
the embryo and the adult, and likewise a close similarity in the
embryos of widely different animals within the same class, that we
might be led to look at these facts as necessarily contingent in some
manner on growth. But there is no obvious reason why, for instance,
the wing of a bat, or the fin of a porpoise, should not have been
sketched out with all the parts in proper proportion, as soon as any
structure became visible in the embryo. And in some whole groups of
animals and in certain members of other groups, the
embryo does not at any period differ widely from the adult: thus Owen
has remarked in regard to cuttle-fish, `there is no metamorphosis; the
cephalopodic character is manifested long before the parts of the
embryo are completed;' and again in spiders, `there is nothing worthy
to be called a metamorphosis.' The larvae of insects, whether adapted
to the most diverse and active habits, or quite inactive, being fed by
their parents or placed in the midst of proper nutriment, yet nearly
all pass through a similar worm-like stage of development; but in some
few cases, as in that of Aphis, if we look to the admirable drawings
by Professor Huxley of the development of this insect, we see no trace
of the vermiform stage.
<P>
How, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology,
  namely the very general, but not universal difference in
structure between the embryo and the adult;   of parts in the
same individual embryo, which ultimately become very unlike and serve
for diverse purposes, being at this early period of growth alike;
  of embryos of different species within the same class,
generally, but not universally, resembling each other;   of the
structure of the embryo not being closely related to its conditions of
existence, except when the embryo becomes at any period of life active
and has to provide for itself;   of the embryo apparently having
sometimes a higher organisation than the mature animal, into which it
is developed. I believe that all these facts can be explained, as
follows, on the view of descent with modification.
<P>
It is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities often affecting
the embryo at a very early period, that slight variations necessarily
appear at an equally early period.  But we have little evidence on
this head   indeed the evidence rather points the other way; for
it is notorious that breeders of cattle, horses, and various fancy
animals, cannot positively tell, until some time after the animal has
been born, what its merits or form will ultimately turn out.  We see
this plainly in our own children; we cannot always tell whether the
child will be tall or short, or what its precise features will be. The
question is not, at what period of life any variation has been caused,
but at what period it is fully displayed. The cause may
have acted, and I believe generally has acted, even before the embryo
is formed; and the variation may be due to the male and female sexual
elements having been affected by the conditions to which either
parent, or their ancestors, have been exposed. Nevertheless an effect
thus caused at a very early period, even before the formation of the
embryo, may appear late in life; as when an hereditary disease, which
appears in old age alone, has been communicated to the offspring from
the reproductive element of one parent. Or again, as when the horns of
cross-bred cattle have been affected by the shape of the horns of
either parent. For the welfare of a very young animal, as long as it
remains in its mother's womb, or in the egg, or as long as it is
nourished and protected by its parent, it must be quite unimportant
whether most of its characters are fully acquired a little earlier or
later in life. It would not signify, for instance, to a bird which
obtained its food best by having a long beak, whether or not it
assumed a beak of this particular length, as long as it was fed by its
parents. Hence, I conclude, that it is quite possible, that each of
the many successive modifications, by which each species has acquired
its present structure, may have supervened at a not very early period
of life; and some direct evidence from our domestic animals supports
this view. But in other cases it is quite possible that each
successive modification, or most of them, may have appeared at an
extremely early period.
<P>
I have stated in the first chapter, that there is some evidence to
render it probable, that at whatever age any variation first appears
in the parent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the
offspring. Certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages,
for instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago
states of the silk-moth; or, again, in the horns of almost full-grown
cattle. But further than this, variations which, for all that we can
see, might have appeared earlier or later in life, tend to appear at a
corresponding age in the offspring and parent. I am far from meaning
that this is invariably the case; and I could give a good many cases
of variations (taking the word in the largest sense) which have
supervened at an earlier age in the child than in the parent. 
<P>
These two principles, if their truth be admitted, will, I believe,
explain all the above specified leading facts in embryology. But first
let us look at a few analogous cases in domestic varieties. Some
authors who have written on Dogs, maintain that the greyhound and
bulldog, though appearing so different, are really varieties most
closely allied, and have probably descended from the same wild stock;
hence I was curious to see how far their puppies differed from each
other: I was told by breeders that they differed just as much as their
parents, and this, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case;
but on actually measuring the old dogs and their six-days old puppies,
I found that the puppies had not nearly acquired their full amount of
proportional difference. So, again, I was told that the foals of cart
and race-horses differed as much as the full-grown animals; and this
surprised me greatly, as I think it probable that the difference
between these two breeds has been wholly caused by selection under
domestication; but having had careful measurements made of the dam and
of a three-days old colt of a race and heavy cart-horse, I find that
the colts have by no means acquired their full amount of proportional
difference.
<P>
As the evidence appears to me conclusive, that the several domestic
breeds of pigeon have descended from one wild species, I compared
young pigeons of various breeds, within twelve hours after being
hatched; I carefully measured the proportions (but will not here give
details) of the beak, width of mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid,
size of feet and length of leg, in the wild stock, in pouters,
fantails, runts, barbs, dragons, carriers, and tumblers. Now some of
these birds, when mature, differ so extraordinarily in length and form
of beak, that they would, I cannot doubt, be ranked in distinct
genera, had they been natural productions. But when the nestling birds
of these several breeds were placed in a row, though most of them
could be distinguished from each other, yet their proportional
differences in the above specified several points were incomparably
less than in the full-grown birds.  Some characteristic points of
difference   for instance, that of the width of mouth --
could hardly be detected in the young. But there was one remarkable
exception to this rule, for the young of the short-faced tumbler
differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon and of the
other breeds, in all its proportions, almost exactly as much as in the
adult state.
<P>
The two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts in
regard to the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties.
Fanciers select their horses, dogs, and pigeons, for breeding, when
they are nearly grown up: they are indifferent whether the desired
qualities and structures have been acquired earlier or later in life,
if the full-grown animal possesses them. And the cases just given,
more especially that of pigeons, seem to show that the characteristic
differences which give value to each breed, and which have been
accumulated by man's selection, have not generally first appeared at
an early period of life, and have been inherited by the offspring at a
corresponding not early period. But the case of the short-faced
tumbler, which when twelve hours old had acquired its proper
proportions, proves that this is not the universal rule; for here the
characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier
period than usual, or, if not so, the differences must have been
inherited, not at the corresponding, but at an earlier age.
<P>
Now let us apply these facts and the above two principles  
which latter, though not proved true, can be shown to be in some
degree probable   to species in a state of nature.  Let us take
a genus of birds, descended on my theory from some one parent-species,
and of which the several new species have become modified through
natural selection in accordance with their diverse habits. Then, from
the many slight successive steps of variation having supervened at a
rather late age, and having been inherited at a corresponding age, the
young of the new species of our supposed genus will manifestly tend to
resemble each other much more closely than do the adults, just as we
have seen in the case of pigeons. We may extend this view to whole
families or even classes. The fore-limbs, for instance, which served
as legs in the parent-species, may become, by a long course of
modification, adapted in one descendant to act as hands, in another as
paddles, in another as wings; and on the above two principles  
namely of each successive modification supervening at a rather late
age, and being inherited at a corresponding late age
  the fore-limbs in the embryos of the several descendants of
the parent-species will still resemble each other closely, for they
will not have been modified. But in each individual new species, the
embryonic fore-limbs will differ greatly from the fore-limbs in the
mature animal; the limbs in the latter having undergone much
modification at a rather late period of life, and having thus been
converted into hands, or paddles, or wings. Whatever influence
long-continued exercise or use on the one hand, and disuse on the
other, may have in modifying an organ, such influence will mainly
affect the mature animal, which has come to its full powers of
activity and has to gain its own living; and the effects thus produced
will be inherited at a corresponding mature age. Whereas the young
will remain unmodified, or be modified in a lesser degree, by the
effects of use and disuse.
<P>
In certain cases the successive steps of variation might supervene,
from causes of which we are wholly ignorant, at a very early period of
life, or each step might be inherited at an earlier period than that
at which it first appeared.  In either case (as with the short-faced
tumbler) the young or embryo would closely resemble the mature
parent-form. We have seen that this is the rule of development in
certain whole groups of animals, as with cuttle-fish and spiders, and
with a few members of the great class of insects, as with Aphis. With
respect to the final cause of the young in these cases not undergoing
any metamorphosis, or closely resembling their parents from their
earliest age, we can see that this would result from the two following
contingencies; firstly, from the young, during a course of
modification carried on for many generations, having to provide for
their own wants at a very early stage of development, and secondly,
from their following exactly the same habits of life with their
parents; for in this case, it would be indispensable for the existence
of the species, that the child should be modified at a very early age
in the same manner with its parents, in accordance with their similar
habits. Some further explanation, however, of the embryo not
undergoing any metamorphosis is perhaps requisite. If, on the other
hand, it profited the young to follow habits of life in any degree
different from those of their parent, and consequently to be
constructed in a slightly different manner, then, on the
principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, the active young or
larvae might easily be rendered by natural selection different to any
conceivable extent from their parents. Such differences might, also,
become correlated with successive stages of development; so that the
larvae, in the first stage, might differ greatly from the larvae in
the second stage, as we have seen to be the case with cirripedes. The
adult might become fitted for sites or habits, in which organs of
locomotion or of the senses, &amp;c., would be useless; and in this
case the final metamorphosis would be said to be retrograde.
<P>
As all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever
lived on this earth have to be classed together, and as all have been
connected by the finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our
collections were nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would
be genealogical. Descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion
which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural
system. On this view we can understand how it is that, in the eyes of
most naturalists, the structure of the embryo is even more important
for classification than that of the adult. For the embryo is the
animal in its less modified state; and in so far it reveals the
structure of its progenitor. In two groups of animal, however much
they may at present differ from each other in structure and habits, if
they pass through the same or similar embryonic stages, we may feel
assured that they have both descended from the same or nearly similar
parents, and are therefore in that degree closely related. Thus,
community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent. It will
reveal this community of descent, however much the structure of the
adult may have been modified and obscured; we have seen, for instance,
that cirripedes can at once be recognised by their larvae as belonging
to the great class of crustaceans. As the embryonic state of each
species and group of species partially shows us the structure of their
less modified ancient progenitors, we can clearly see why ancient and
extinct forms of life should resemble the embryos of their
descendants,   our existing species. Agassiz believes this to be
a law of nature; but I am bound to confess that I only hope to see the
law hereafter proved true. It can be proved true in those cases alone
in which the ancient state, now supposed to be
represented in many embryos, has not been obliterated, either by the
successive variations in a long course of modification having
supervened at a very early age, or by the variations having been
inherited at an earlier period than that at which they first appeared.
It should also be borne in mind, that the supposed law of resemblance
of ancient forms of life to the embryonic stages of recent forms, may
be true, but yet, owing to the geological record not extending far
enough back in time, may remain for a long period, or for ever,
incapable of demonstration.
<P>
Thus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which are
second in importance to none in natural history, are explained on the
principle of slight modifications not appearing, in the many
descendants from some one ancient progenitor, at a very early period
in the life of each, though perhaps caused at the earliest, and being
inherited at a corresponding not early period. Embryology rises
greatly in interest, when we thus look at the embryo as a picture,
more or less obscured, of the common parent-form of each great class
of animals.
</P>
<H4>Rudimentary, atrophied, or aborted organs</H4>
<P>
Organs or parts in this strange condition, bearing the stamp
of inutility, are extremely common throughout nature. For instance,
rudimentary mammae are very general in the males of mammals: I presume
that the `bastard-wing' in birds may be safely considered as a digit
in a rudimentary state: in very many snakes one lobe of the lungs is
rudimentary; in other snakes there are rudiments of the pelvis and
hind limbs. Some of the cases of rudimentary organs are extremely
curious; for instance, the presence of teeth in foetal whales, which
when grown up have not a tooth in their heads; and the presence of
teeth, which never cut through the gums, in the upper jaws of our
unborn calves. It has even been stated on good authority that
rudiments of teeth can be detected in the beaks of certain embryonic
birds. Nothing can be plainer than that wings are formed for flight,
yet in how many insects do we see wings so reduced in size as to be
utterly incapable of flight, and not rarely lying under wing-cases,
firmly soldered together!
<P>
The meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite
unmistakeable: for instance there are beetles of the same genus (and
even of the same species) resembling each other most closely in all
respects, one of which will have full-sized wings, and another mere
rudiments of membrane; and here it is impossible to doubt, that the
rudiments represent wings. Rudimentary organs sometimes retain their
potentiality, and are merely not developed: this seems to be the case
with the mammae of male mammals, for many instances are on record of
these organs having become well developed in full-grown males, and
having secreted milk. So again there are normally four developed and
two rudimentary teats in the udders of the genus Bos, but in our
domestic cows the two sometimes become developed and give milk. In
individual plants of the same species the petals sometimes occur as
mere rudiments, and sometimes in a well-developed state. In plants
with separated sexes, the male flowers often have a rudiment of a
pistil; and K&ouml;lreuter found that by crossing such male plants with an
hermaphrodite species, the rudiment of the pistil in the hybrid
offspring was much increased in size; and this shows that the rudiment
and the perfect pistil are essentially alike in nature.
<P>
An organ serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or
utterly aborted for one, even the more important purpose;, and remain
perfectly efficient for the other. Thus in plants, the office of the
pistil is to allow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules protected in
the ovarium at its base. The pistil consists of a stigma supported on
the style; but in some Compositae, the male florets, which of course
cannot be fecundated, have a pistil, which is in a rudimentary state,
for it is not crowned with a stigma; but the style remains well
developed, and is clothed with hairs as in other compositae, for the
purpose of brushing the pollen out of the surrounding anthers. Again,
an organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose, and be used
for a distinct object: in certain fish the swim-bladder seems to be
rudimentary for its proper function of giving buoyancy, but has become
converted into a nascent breathing organ or lung. Other similar
instances could be given.
<P>
Rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are
very liable to vary in degree of development and in other
respects. Moreover, in closely allied species, the degree to which the
same organ has been rendered rudimentary occasionally differs much.
This latter fact is well exemplified in the state of the wings of the
female moths in certain groups. Rudimentary organs may be utterly
aborted; and this implies, that we find in an animal or plant no trace
of an organ, which analogy would lead us to expect to find, and which
is occasionally found in monstrous individuals of the species. Thus in
the snapdragon (antirrhinum) we generally do not find a rudiment of a
fifth stamen; but this may sometimes be seen. In tracing the
homologies of the same part in different members of a class, nothing
is more common, or more necessary, than the use and discovery of
rudiments. This is well shown in the drawings given by Owen of the
bones of the leg of the horse, ox, and rhinoceros.
<P>
It is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in
the upper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the
embryo, but afterwards wholly disappear.  It is also, I believe, a
universal rule, that a rudimentary part or organ is of greater size
relatively to the adjoining parts in the embryo, than in the adult; so
that the organ at this early age is less rudimentary, or even cannot
be said to be in any degree rudimentary. Hence, also, a rudimentary
organ in the adult, is often said to have retained its embryonic
condition.
<P>
I have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary
organs. In reflecting on them, every one must be struck with
astonishment: for the same reasoning power which tells us plainly that
most parts and organs are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes,
tells us with equal plainness that these rudimentary or atrophied
organs, are imperfect and useless. In works on natural history
rudimentary organs are generally said to have been created `for the
sake of symmetry,' or in order `to complete the scheme of nature;' but
this seems to me no explanation, merely a restatement of the fact.
Would it be thought sufficient to say that because planets revolve in
elliptic courses round the sun, satellites follow the same course
round the planets, for the sake of symmetry, and to complete the
scheme of nature? An eminent physiologist accounts for the presence of
rudimentary organs, by supposing that they serve to
excrete matter in excess, or injurious to the system; but can we
suppose that the minute papilla, which often represents the pistil in
male flowers, and which is formed merely of cellular tissue, can thus
act? Can we suppose that the formation of rudimentary teeth which are
subsequently absorbed, can be of any service to the rapidly growing
embryonic calf by the excretion of precious phosphate of lime? When a
man's fingers have been amputated, imperfect nails sometimes appear on
the stumps: I could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails have
appeared, not from unknown laws of growth, but in order to excrete
horny matter, as that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee
were formed for this purpose.
<P>
On my view of descent with modification, the origin of rudimentary
organs is simple. We have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our
domestic productions,   as the stump of a tail in tailless
breeds,   the vestige of an ear in earless breeds, -- the
reappearance of minute dangling horns in hornless breeds of cattle,
more especially, according to Youatt, in young animals,   and
the state of the whole flower in the cauliflower. We often see
rudiments of various parts in monsters. But I doubt whether any of
these cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state
of nature, further than by showing that rudiments can be produced; for
I doubt whether species under nature ever undergo abrupt changes. I
believe that disuse has been the main agency; that it has led in
successive generations to the gradual reduction of various organs,
until they have become rudimentary,   as in the case of the eyes
of animals inhabiting dark caverns, and of the wings of birds
inhabiting oceanic islands, which have seldom been forced to take
flight, and have ultimately lost the power of flying.  Again, an organ
useful under certain conditions, might become injurious under others,
as with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands; and
in this case natural selection would continue slowly to reduce the
organ, until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary.
<P>
Any change in function, which can be effected by insensibly small
steps, is within the power of natural selection; so that an organ
rendered, during changed habits of life, useless or injurious
for one purpose, might easily be modified and used for
another purpose. Or an organ might be retained for one alone of its
former functions. An organ, when rendered useless, may well be
variable, for its variations cannot be checked by natural selection.
At whatever period of life disuse or selection reduces an organ, and
this will generally be when the being has come to maturity and to its
full powers of action, the principle of inheritance at corresponding
ages will reproduce the organ in its reduced state at the same age,
and consequently will seldom affect or reduce it in the embryo. Thus
we can understand the greater relative size of rudimentary organs in
the embryo, and their lesser relative size in the adult. But if each
step of the process of reduction were to be inherited, not at the
corresponding age, but at an extremely early period of life (as we
have good reason to believe to be possible) the rudimentary part would
tend to be wholly lost, and we should have a case of complete
abortion. The principle, also, of economy, explained in a former
chapter, by which the materials forming any part or structure, if not
useful to the possessor, will be saved as far as is possible, will
probably often come into play; and this will tend to cause the entire
obliteration of a rudimentary organ.
<P>
As the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency
in every part of the organisation, which has long existed, to be
inherited   we can understand, on the genealogical view of
classification, how it is that systematists have found rudimentary
parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high
physiological importance. Rudimentary organs may be compared with the
letters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless
in the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue in seeking for its
derivation. On the view of descent with modification, we may conclude
that the existence of organs in a rudimentary, imperfect, and useless
condition, or quite aborted, far from presenting a strange difficulty,
as they assuredly do on the ordinary doctrine of creation, might even
have been anticipated, and can be accounted for by the laws of
inheritance.
</P>
<H4>Summary</H4> 
<P>
In this chapter I have
attempted to show, that the subordination of group to
group in all organisms throughout all time; that the nature of the
relationship, by which all living and extinct beings are united by
complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand
system; the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by
naturalists in their classifications; the value set upon characters,
if constant and prevalent, whether of high vital importance, or of the
most trifling importance, or, as in rudimentary organs, of no
importance; the wide opposition in value between analogical or
adaptive characters, and characters of true affinity; and other such
rules;   all naturally follow on the view of the common
parentage of those forms which are considered by naturalists as
allied, together with their modification through natural selection,
with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of character. In
considering this view of classification, it should be borne in mind
that the element of descent has been universally used in ranking
together the sexes, ages, and acknowledged varieties of the same
species, however different they may be in structure. If we extend the
use of this element of descent,   the only certainly known cause
of similarity in organic beings,   we shall understand what is
meant by the natural system: it is genealogical in its attempted
arrangement, with the grades of acquired difference marked by the
terms varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and classes.
<P>
On this same view of descent with modification, all the great facts
in Morphology become intelligible,   whether we look to the same
pattern displayed in the homologous organs, to whatever purpose
applied, of the different species of a class; or to the homologous
parts constructed on the same pattern in each individual animal and
plant.
<P>
On the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily
or generally supervening at a very early period of life, and being
inherited at a corresponding period, we can understand the great
leading facts in Embryology; namely, the resemblance in an individual
embryo of the homologous parts, which when matured will become widely
different from each other in structure and function; and the
resemblance in different species of a class of the homologous parts or
organs, though fitted in the adult members for purposes
as different as possible. Larvae are active embryos, which have become
specially modified in relation to their habits of life, through the
principle of modifications being inherited at corresponding ages. On
this same principle   and bearing in mind, that when organs are
reduced in size, either from disuse or selection, it will generally be
at that period of life when the being has to provide for its own
wants, and bearing in mind how strong is the principle of inheritance
  the occurrence of rudimentary organs and their final abortion,
present to us no inexplicable difficulties; on the contrary, their
presence might have been even anticipated. The importance of
embryological characters and of rudimentary organs in classification
is intelligible, on the view that an arrangement is only so far
natural as it is genealogical.
<P>
Finally, the several classes of facts which have been considered in
this chapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable
species, genera, and families of organic beings, with which this world
is peopled, have all descended, each within its own class or group,
from common parents, and have all been modified in the course of
descent, that I should without hesitation adopt this view, even if it
were unsupported by other facts or arguments.
