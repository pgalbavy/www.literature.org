<p>It was near six in the May morning when Dick began to ride down into the
fen upon his homeward way. The sky was all blue; the jolly wind blew
loud and steady; the windmill sails were spinning; and the willows over
all the fen rippling and whitening like a field of corn. He had been all
night in the saddle, but his heart was good and his body sound, and he
rode right merrily.
</p><p>The path went down and down into the marsh, till he lost sight of all
the neighbouring landmarks but Kettley windmill on the knoll behind him,
and the extreme top of Tunstall Forest far before. On either hand there
were great fields of blowing reeds and willows, pools of water shaking
in the wind, and treacherous bogs, as green as emerald, to tempt and to
betray the traveller. The path lay almost straight through the morass.
It was already very ancient; its foundation had been laid by Roman
soldiery; in the lapse of ages much of it had sunk, and every here and
there, for a few hundred yards, it lay submerged below the stagnant
waters of the fen.
</p><p>About a mile from Kettley, Dick came to one such break in the plain line
of causeway, where the reeds and willows grew dispersedly like little
islands and confused the eye. The gap, besides, was more than usually
long; it was a place where any stranger might come readily to mischief;
and Dick bethought him, with something like a pang, of the lad whom he
had so imperfectly directed. As for himself, one look backward to where
the windmill sails were turning black against the blue of heaven--one
look forward to the high ground of Tunstall Forest, and he was
sufficiently directed and held straight on, the water washing to his
horse's knees, as safe as on a highway.
</p><p>Half-way across, and when he had already sighted the path rising high
and dry upon the farther side, he was aware of a great splashing on his
right, and saw a grey horse, sunk to its belly in the mud, and still
spasmodically struggling. Instantly, as though it had divined the
neighbourhood of help, the poor beast began to neigh most piercingly. It
rolled, meanwhile, a bloodshot eye, insane with terror; and as it
sprawled wallowing in the quag, clouds of stinging insects rose and
buzzed about it in the air.
</p><p>"Alack!" thought Dick, "can the poor lad have perished? There is his
horse, for certain--a brave grey! Nay, comrade, if thou criest to me so
piteously, I will do all man can to help thee. Shalt not lie there to
drown by inches!"
</p><p>And he made ready his cross-bow, and put a quarrel through the
creature's head.
</p><p>Dick rode on after this act of rugged mercy, somewhat sobered in spirit,
and looking closely about him for any sign of his less happy predecessor
in the way.
</p><p>"I would I had dared to tell him further," he thought; "for I fear he
has miscarried in the slough."
</p><p>And just as he was so thinking, a voice cried upon his name from the
causeway-side, and, looking over his shoulder, he saw the lad's face
peering from a clump of reeds.
</p><p>"Are ye there?" he said, reining in. "Ye lay so close among the reeds
that I had passed you by. I saw your horse bemired, and put him from his
agony; which, by my sooth! an ye had been a more merciful rider, ye had
done yourself. But come forth out of your hiding. Here be none to
trouble you."
</p><p>"Nay, good boy, I have no arms, nor skill to use them if I had," replied
the other, stepping forth upon the pathway.
</p><p>"Why call me 'boy'?" cried Dick. "Y'are not, I trow, the elder of us
twain."
</p><p>"Good Master Shelton," said the other, "prithee forgive me. I have none
the least intention to offend. Rather I would in every way beseech your
gentleness and favour, for I am now worse bested than ever, having lost
my way, my cloak, and my poor horse. To have a riding-rod and spurs, and
never a horse to sit upon! And before all," he added, looking ruefully
upon his clothes--"before all, to be so sorrily besmirched!"
</p><p>"Tut!" cried Dick. "Would ye mind a ducking? Blood of wound or dust of
travel--that's a man's adornment."
</p><p>"Nay, then, I like him better plain," observed the lad. "But, prithee,
how shall I do? Prithee, good Master Richard, help me with your good
counsel. If I come not safe to Holywood, I am undone."
</p><p>"Nay," said Dick, dismounting, "I will give more than counsel. Take my
horse, and I will run awhile, and when I am weary we shall change
again, that so, riding and running, both may go the speedier."
</p><p>So the change was made, and they went forward as briskly as they durst
on the uneven causeway, Dick with his hand upon the other's knee.
</p><p>"How call ye your name?" asked Dick.
</p><p>"Call me John Matcham," replied the lad.
</p><p>"And what make ye to Holywood?" Dick continued.
</p><p>"I seek sanctuary from a man that would oppress me," was the answer.
"The good Abbot of Holywood is a strong pillar to the weak."
</p><p>"And how came ye with Sir Daniel, Master Matcham?" pursued Dick.
</p><p>"Nay," cried the other, "by the abuse of force! He hath taken me by
violence from my own place; dressed me in these weeds; ridden with me
till my heart was sick; gibed me till I could 'a' wept; and when certain
of my friends pursued, thinking to have me back, claps me in the rear to
stand their shot! I was even grazed in the right foot, and walk but
lamely. Nay, there shall come a day between us; he shall smart for all!"
</p><p>"Would ye shoot at the moon with a hand-gun?" said Dick. "'Tis a valiant
knight, and hath a hand of iron. An he guessed I had made or meddled
with your flight, it would go sore with me."
</p><p>"Ay, poor boy," returned the other, "y'are his ward, I know it. By the
same token, so am I, or so he saith; or else he hath bought my
marriage--I wot not rightly which; but it is some handle to oppress me
by."
</p><p>"Boy again!" said Dick.
</p><p>"Nay, then, shall I call you girl, good Richard?" asked Matcham.
</p><p>"Never a girl for me," returned Dick. "I do abjure the crew of them!"
</p><p>"Ye speak boyishly," said the other. "Ye think more of them than ye
pretend."
</p><p>"Not I," said Dick, stoutly. "They come not in my mind. A plague of
them, say I! Give me to hunt and to fight and to feast, and to live with
jolly foresters. I never heard of a maid yet that was for any service,
save one only; and she, poor shrew, was burned for a witch and the
wearing of men's clothes in spite of nature."
</p><p>Master Matcham crossed himself with fervour, and appeared to pray.
</p><p>"What make ye?" Dick inquired.
</p><p>"I pray for her spirit," answered the other, with a somewhat troubled
voice.
</p><p>"For a witch's spirit?" Dick cried. "But pray for her, an ye list; she
was the best wench in Europe, was this Joan of Arc. Old Appleyard the
archer ran from her, he said, as if she had been Mahoun. Nay, she was a
brave wench."
</p><p>"Well, but, good Master Richard," resumed Matcham, "an ye like maids so
little, y'are no true natural man; for God made them twain by intention,
and brought true love into the world, to be man's hope and woman's
comfort."
</p><p>"Faugh!" said Dick. "Y'are a milk-sopping baby, so to harp on women. An
ye think I be no true man, get down upon the path, and whether at
fists, backsword, or bow and arrow, I will prove my manhood on your
body."
</p><p>"Nay, I am no fighter," said Matcham, eagerly. "I mean no tittle of
offence. I meant but pleasantry. And if I talk of women, it is because I
heard ye were to marry."
</p><p>"I to marry!" Dick exclaimed. "Well, it is the first I hear of it. And
with whom was I to marry?"
</p><p>"One Joan Sedley," replied Matcham, colouring. "It was Sir Daniel's
doing; he hath money to gain upon both sides; and, indeed, I have heard
the poor wench bemoaning herself pitifully of the match. It seems she is
of your mind, or else distasted to the bridegroom."
</p><p>"Well! marriage is like death, it comes to all," said Dick, with
resignation. "And she bemoaned herself? I pray ye now, see there how
shuttle-witted are these girls: to bemoan herself before that she had
seen me! Do I bemoan myself? Not I. An I be to marry, I will marry
dry-eyed! But if ye know her, prithee, of what favour is she? fair or
foul? And is she shrewish or pleasant?"
</p><p>"Nay, what matters it?" said Matcham. "An y'are to marry, ye can but
marry. What matters foul or fair? These be but toys. Y'are no milksop,
Master Richard; ye will wed with dry eyes, anyhow."
</p><p>"It is well said," replied Shelton. "Little I reck."
</p><p>"Your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord," said Matcham.
</p><p>"She shall have the lord Heaven made her for," returned Dick. "I trow
there be worse as well as better."
</p><p>"Ah, the poor wench!" cried the other.
</p><p>"And why so poor?" asked Dick.
</p><p>"To wed a man of wood," replied his companion. "O me, for a wooden
husband!"
</p><p>"I think I be a man of wood, indeed," said Dick, "to trudge afoot the
while you ride my horse; but it is good wood, I trow."
</p><p>"Good Dick, forgive me," cried the other. "Nay, y'are the best heart in
England; I but laughed. Forgive me now, sweet Dick."
</p><p>"Nay, no fool words," returned Dick, a little embarrassed by his
companion's warmth. "No harm is done. I am not touchy, praise the
saints."
</p><p>And at that moment the wind, which was blowing straight behind them as
they went, brought them the rough flourish of Sir Daniel's trumpeter.
</p><p>"Hark!" said Dick, "the tucket soundeth."
</p><p>"Ay," said Matcham, "they have found my flight, and now I am unhorsed!"
and he became pale as death.
</p><p>"Nay, what cheer!" returned Dick. "Y' have a long start, and we are near
the ferry. And it is I, methinks, that am unhorsed."
</p><p>"Alack, I shall be taken!" cried the fugitive. "Dick, kind Dick, beseech
ye help me but a little!"
</p><p>"Why, now, what aileth thee?" said Dick. "Methinks I help you very
patently. But my heart is sorry for so spiritless a fellow! And see ye
here, John Matcham--sith John Matcham is your name--I, Richard Shelton,
tide what betideth, come what may, will see you safe in Holywood. The
saints so do to me again if I default you. Come, pick me up a good
heart, Sir Whiteface. The way betters here; spur me the horse. Go
faster! faster! Nay, mind not for me; I can run like a deer."
</p><p>So, with the horse trotting hard, and Dick running easily alongside,
they crossed the remainer of the fen, and came out upon the banks of the
river by the ferryman's hut.
