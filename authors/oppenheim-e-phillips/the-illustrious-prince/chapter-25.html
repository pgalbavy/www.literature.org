<P>
There were some days when the absence of patients seemed to Dr.
Spencer Whiles a thing almost insupportable. Too late he began to
realize that he had set up in the wrong neighborhood. In years to
come, he reflected gloomily, when the great building estate which
was to have been developed more than a year ago was really opened
up, there might be an opportunity where he was, a very excellent
opportunity, too, for a young doctor of ability. Just now,
however, the outlook was almost hopeless. He found himself even
looking eagerly forward every day for another visit from Mr.
Inspector Jacks. Another trip to town would mean a peep into the
world of luxury, whose doors were so closely barred against him,
and, what was more important still, it would mean a fee which
would keep the wolf from the door for another week. It had come
to that with Dr. Whiles. His little stock of savings was
exhausted. Unless something turned up within the course of the
next few weeks, he knew very well that there was nothing left for
him to do but to slip away quietly into the embrace of the more
shady parts of the great city, to find a situation somewhere,
somehow, beyond the ken of the disappointed creditors whom he
would leave behind.
<P>
Mr. Inspector Jacks, however, had apparently no further use, for
the present at any rate, for his medical friend. On the other
hand, Dr. Spencer Whiles was not left wholly to himself. On the
fourth day after his visit to London a motor car drew up outside
his modest surgery door, and with an excitement which he found it
almost impossible to conceal, he saw a plainly dressed young man,
evidently a foreigner and, he believed, a Japanese, descend and
ring the patients' bell. The doctor had dismissed his boy a week
ago, from sheer inability to pay his modest wages, and he did not
hesitate for a moment about opening the door himself. The man
outside raised his hat and made him a sweeping bow.
<P>
"It is Dr. Spencer Whiles?" he asked.
<P>
The doctor admitted the fact and invited his visitor to enter.
<P>
"It is here, perhaps," the latter continued, "that a gentleman
who was riding a bicycle and was run into by a motor car, was
brought after the accident and treated so skilfully?"
<P>
"That is so," Dr. Whiles admitted. "There was nothing much the
matter with him. He had rather a narrow escape."
<P>
"I am that gentleman's servant," the visitor continued with a
bland smile. "He has sent me down here to see you. The leg which
was injured is perfectly well, but there was a pain in the side
of which he spoke to you, which has not disappeared. This
morning, in fact, it is worse,--much worse. My master, therefore,
has sent me to you. He begs that if it is not inconvenient you
will return with me at once and examine him."
<P>
The doctor drew a little breath. This might mean another week or
so of respite!
<P>
"Where does your master live?" he asked the man.
<P>
"In the West end of London, sir," was the reply. "The Square of
St. James it is called."
<P>
Dr. Whiles glanced at his watch.
<P>
"It will take me some time to go there with you," he said, "and I
shall have to arrange with a friend to treat any other patients.
Do you think your master will understand that I shall need an
increased fee?"
<P>
"My master desired me to say," the other answered, "that he would
be prepared to pay any fee you cared to mention. Money is not of
account with him. He has not had occasion to seek medical advice
in London, and as he is leaving very soon, he did not wish to
send for a strange physician. He remembered with gratitude your
care of him, and he sends for you"
<P>
"That's all right," Dr. Whiles declared, "so long as it's
understood. You'll excuse me for a moment while I write a note,
and I'll come along."
<P>
Dr. Whiles had no note to write, but he made a few changes in his
toilet which somewhat improved his appearance. In due course he
reappeared and was rapidly whirled up to London, the sole
passenger in the magnificent car. The man who had brought him the
message from his quondam patient was sitting in front, next the
chauffeur, so Dr. Whiles had no opportunity of asking him for any
information concerning his master. Nor did the car itself slacken
speed until it drew up before the door of the large corner house
in St. James' Square. A footman in dark livery came running out;
a butler bowed upon the steps. Dr. Spencer Whiles was immensely
impressed. The servants were all Japanese, but their livery and
manners were faultless. He made his way into the hall and
followed the butler up the broad stairs.
<P>
"My master," the latter explained, "will receive you very
shortly. He is but party dressed at present."
<P>
Dr. Spencer Whiles came of a family of successful tradespeople,
and he was not used to such quiet magnificence as was everywhere
displayed. Yet, with it all, there seemed to him to be an air of
gloom about the place, something almost mysterious in the silence
of the thick carpets, the subdued voices, and the absence of
maidservants. The house itself was apparently an old one. He
noticed that the doors were very heavy and thick, the corridors
roomy, the absence of light almost remarkable. The apartment into
which he was shown, however, came as a pleasant surprise. It was
small, but delightfully furnished in the most modern fashion. Its
only drawback was that it looked out upon a blank wall.
<P>
"My master will come to you in a few minutes," the butler
announced. "What refreshments may I have the honor of serving?"
<P>
Dr. Whiles waved aside the invitation,--he would at any rate
remain professional. The man withdrew, and almost immediately
afterwards Prince Maiyo entered the room. The doctor rose to his
feet with a little thrill of excitement. The Prince held out his
hand.
<P>
"I am very pleased to see you again, doctor," he said. "You
looked after me so well last time that I was afraid I should have
no excuse for sending for you."
<P>
"I am glad to find that you are not suffering," the doctor
answered. "I understood from your servant that you were feeling a
good deal of pain in the side."
<P>
"It troubles me at times," the Prince admitted, drawing a chair
up towards his visitor,--"just sufficiently, perhaps, to give me
the excuse of seeking a little conversation with you. You must
let me offer you something after your ride."
<P>
"You are very good," the doctor answered. "Perhaps I had better
examine you first."
<P>
The Prince rang the bell and waved aside the suggestion.
<P>
"That," he said, "can wait. In my country, you know, we do not
consider that a guest is properly treated unless he partakes of
our hospitality the moment he crosses the threshold. The whiskey
and soda water," he ordered of the butler who appeared at the
door. "We will talk of my ailments," the Prince continued, "in a
moment or two. Tell me what you thought of that marvellous
restaurant where I saw you the other morning?"
<P>
The doctor drew a little breath.
<P>
"It was you, then!" he exclaimed.
<P>
"But naturally," the Prince murmured. "I took it for granted that
you would recognize me."
<P>
The doctor found some difficulty in proceeding. He was trying to
imagine the cousin of an Emperor riding a bicycle along a country
road, staggering into his surgery at midnight, covered with dust,
inarticulate, pointing only to the wounds beneath his cheap
clothes!
<P>
"Nothing," the Prince continued easily, "has impressed me more in
your country than the splendor of your restaurants. You see, that
side of your life represents something we are altogether ignorant
of in Japan."
<P>
"It is a very wonderful place," the doctor admitted. "We had
luncheon, my friend and I, in the grillroom, but we came for a
few minutes into the foyer to watch the people from the
restaurant."
<P>
The Prince nodded genially.
<P>
"By the bye," he remarked, "it is strange that my very good
friend--Mr. Inspector Jacks--should also be a friend of yours."
<P>
"He is scarcely that," the doctor objected. "I have known him for
a very short time."
<P>
The Prince raised his eyebrows. The whiskey and soda were
brought, and the doctor helped himself. How curiously deficient
these Westerners were, the Prince thought, in every instinct of
duplicity! As clearly as possible the doctor had revealed the
fact that his acquaintance with Inspector Jacks was of precisely
that nature which might have been expected.
<P>
The Prince sighed. There was but one course open to him.
<P>
"Now, Dr. Whiles," he said, "I will tell you something. You must
listen to me very carefully, please. I sent for you not so much
on account of any immediate pain but because my general health
has been giving me a little trouble lately. I have come to the
conclusion that I require the services of a medical attendant
always at hand."
<P>
The doctor looked at his prospective patient skeptically.
<P>
"You have not the appearance," he remarked, "of being in ill
health."
<P>
"Perhaps not," the Prince answered. "Perhaps even, there is not
for the moment very much the matter with me. One has humors, you
know, my dear doctor. I have a somewhat large suite here with me
in England, but I do not number amongst them a physician. I
wanted to ask you to accept that position in my household for two
months."
<P>
"Do you mean come and live here?" the doctor asked.
<P>
"That is exactly what I do mean," the Prince answered. "I am
thankful to observe that your apprehensions are so acute. I warn
you that I am going to make some very curious conditions. I do
not know whether money is an object to you. If not, I am
powerless. If it is, I propose to make it worth your while."
<P>
The doctor did not hesitate.
<P>
"Money," he said, "is the greatest object in life to me. I have
none, and I want some very badly."
<P>
The Prince smiled.
<P>
"I find your candor delightful," he declared. "Now tell me, Dr.
Whiles, how many patients have you in your neighborhood
absolutely dependent upon your services?"
<P>
The doctor hesitated, opened his mouth and closed it again.
<P>
"Not one!" he declared.
<P>
Once more the Prince's lips parted. His smile this time was
definite, transfiguring.
<P>
"I find you, Dr. Whiles," he announced, "a most charmingly
reasonable person. I make you my offer, then, with every
confidence, although I warn you that there will be some strange
conditions attached to it. I ask you to accept the post of
private physician to this household for the space of one--it may
be two months, and I offer you also, as an honorarium, the fee of
one thousand guineas."
<P>
The doctor sat quite still for a moment. He was in a condition
when speech was difficult. Then his eyes fell upon his tumbler of
whiskey and soda still half filled. He emptied it at a draught.
<P>
"A thousand guineas!" he repeated hoarsely.
<P>
"I trust that you will find the sum attractive," the Prince said
smoothly, "because, as I have warned you before, there are one or
two curious conditions coupled with the post."
<P>
"I don't care what the conditions are," the doctor said slowly.
"I accept!"
<P>
The Prince nodded.
<P>
"You are the man I thought you were, doctor," he said. "The first
condition, then, is this. You see the sitting room we are now
in--a pleasant little apartment, I think,--books, you see,
papers, a smoking cabinet in which I can assure you that you will
find the finest Havana cigars and the best cigarettes to be
procured in London. Through here"--the Prince threw open an inner
door--"is a small sleeping apartment. It has, as you see, the
same outlook. It is comfortable if not luxurious."
<P>
The doctor sighed.
<P>
"I am not used to luxury," he said.
<P>
"These two rooms will be yours," the Prince announced, "and the
first condition of our arrangement is that until two months are
up, or our engagement is finished, you do not leave them."
<P>
The doctor stared at him blankly.
<P>
"Are you in earnest, sir?" he asked.
<P>
"In absolute earnest," the Prince assured him. "Not only that,
but I require you to keep your whereabouts, until after the
period of time I have mentioned, an entire secret from every one.
I gather that you are not married, and that there is no one
living in your house to whom it would seem necessary to disclose
your movements. In any case, this is another of my conditions.
You are neither to write nor receive any letters whilst here. You
are to figure in the neighborhood from which you came as a man
who has disappeared,--as a man, in short, who has found it
impossible to pay his way and has preferred simply to slip out of
his place. At the end of two months you can reappear or not, as
you choose. That rests with yourself."
<P>
The doctor smiled faintly. To make some sort of disappearance had
been his precise intention, but to disappear in this fashion and
make his return to the world with a thousand guineas in his
pocket, had not exactly come within the scope of his imagination.
It was a situation full of allurements. Nevertheless he was
bewildered.
<P>
"I am to live in these two rooms?" he demanded. "I am to let no
one know where I am, to write no letters, to receive none? My
duties are to be simply to treat you?"
<P>
"When required," the Prince remarked dryly.
<P>
"I suppose," the doctor asked, "my friend Mr. Jacks was speaking
the truth when he told me your name?"
<P>
"My name is Prince Maiyo," the Prince said.
<P>
Mechanically the doctor helped himself to another whiskey and
soda.
<P>
"You are to be my only patient," he said thoughtfully. "May I
take the liberty of feeling your pulse, Prince?"
<P>
The Prince extended his hand. The doctor felt it and resumed his
seat.
<P>
"There is, of course, nothing whatever the matter with you," he
declared. "You are, I should say, in absolutely perfect health.
You have no need of a physician."
<P>
"On the contrary," the Prince protested, smiling, "I need you,
Dr. Whiles, so much that I am paying you a thousand guineas--"
<P>
"To remain in these two rooms," the doctor remarked quietly.
<P>
"It is not your business to think that or to know that," the
Prince said. "Do you accept my offer?"
<P>
"If I should refuse?" the doctor asked.
<P>
The Prince hesitated.
<P>
"Do not let us suppose that," he said. "It is not a pleasant
suggestion. I do not think that you mean to refuse."
<P>
"Frankly, I do not," the doctor answered. "And yet treat it as a
whim of mine and answer my question. Supposing I should?"
<P>
"The matter would arrange itself in precisely the same way," the
Prince answered. "You would not leave these rooms for two
months."
<P>
The doctor leaned back in his chair and laughed shortly.
<P>
"This is rather hard luck on Inspector Jacks," he said. "He paid
me ten guineas the other day to lunch with him."
<P>
"Mr. Inspector Jacks," the Prince remarked, "is scarcely in a
position to bid you an adequate sum for your services."
<P>
"It appears to me," the doctor continued, "that I am kidnapped."
<P>
"An admirable word," the Prince declared. "At what time do you
usually lunch?"
<P>
The doctor smiled.
<P>
"I am not used to motoring," he said, "or interviews of this
exciting character. I lunch, as a rule, when I can get anything
to eat. The present seems to me to be a most suitable hour."
<P>
The Prince nodded, and rose to his feet.
<P>
"I will send my servant," he said, "to take your orders. My cook
is very highly esteemed here, and I can assure you that you will
not be starved. Please also make out a list of the newspapers,
magazines, and books with which you would like to be supplied. I
fear that, for obvious reasons, my people would hardly be able to
anticipate your wants."
<P>
"And about that examination?" the doctor remarked.
<P>
"I shall do myself the pleasure of seeing you every day," the
Prince answered. "There will be time enough for that."
<P>
With an amiable word of farewell the Prince departed. The doctor
threw himself into an easy chair. His single exclamation was
laconic but forcible.
