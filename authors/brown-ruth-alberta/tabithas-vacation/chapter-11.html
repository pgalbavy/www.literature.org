<p>The next day was Saturday, and the morning dawned so hot and
sultry that almost before the old kitchen clock struck five, the
restless eaglets were stirring once more.</p>

<p>"Now's the time I wish we didn't live so far up the mountain,"
sighed Mercedes, mopping her perspiring face on her sleeve as
she struggled to button the dress she had just donned.</p>

<p>"Yes, summer's an awful trial here in this house," agreed Susie,
trying to decide whether to put on her shoes and stockings and
suffer from the heat in that manner, or to go bare-footed and
burn her tender soles on the hot sands.</p>

<p>"Le's do down to the river to-day," lisped Janie, lifting eager
eyes to scan the dark face bending over, as Tabitha patiently
brushed the tangled curls into smooth ringlets.</p>

<p>"Oh, let's!" seconded the twins.</p>

<p>"You know we had to stay at home yesterday when the rest of you
went," wheedled Inez.</p>

<p>"And 'twould have been awful lonesome," began Irene, "if it hadn't
been for that<hr>"</p>

<p>"Ice-cream," hastily interposed Susie, giving the little blunderbus
a warning glance.  "Can't we go, Tabitha?  It would be so much
cooler there."</p>

<p>"I don't see how we can manage it," answered the flushed housekeeper,
glancing longingly out of the window down the yellow ribbon of
a road which wound its way in and out among the rocks and yuccas
on its way to the muddy Colorado, seven miles away.  "The assayer
will be wanting his horses to-day and it's too far to walk."</p>

<p>"Can't we hire a team from the stables?" proposed Inez.</p>

<p>"And pay ten dollars a day for it?" scoffed Mercedes.  "Where
are you going to get your money to foot the bill?"</p>

<p>"Then let's catch enough burros to lug us all," suggested the
resourceful Susie.  "No one would care.  They run loose on the
desert all the time."</p>

<p>Tabitha shook her head slowly, although her eyes gleamed appreciatively
at the plan.  If only Rosslyn and Janie were older!  How she would
enjoy such a frolic as Susie's suggestion would mean.</p>

<p>Only Gloriana remained discreetly silent.</p>

<p>She shuddered whenever she recalled her first and only ride on
one of the wicked little beasts,&mdash;that wild New Years Even when
she and Tabitha had tried to keep Mr. McKittrick's claims from
being jumped,&mdash;and she drew an audible sigh of relief at Tabitha's
decision. But the next instant her heart sank within her, for
with a scurry of feet in the narrow hallway, the door of the room
was unceremoniously flung open, and two eager, boyish faces peered
in.</p>

<p>"I say, Tab," began Billiard, so excited he could hardly refrain
from shouting his news, "your Uncle Decker is out here<hr>"</p>

<p>"And he's brung a whole&mdash;flock&mdash;of burros," broke in Toady, so
anxious to tell part of the good news that he could not stop for
choice of words.</p>

<p>"Saddled," Billiard hurried on, trying to beat Toady to the climax.</p>

<p>"For us!" cried the smaller boy.</p>

<p>"To ride to the canyon on!" bellowed the two as with one voice.</p>

<p>"Really?" gasped Tabitha.</p>

<p>"How perfectly scrumptious!" squealed the tribe of McKittrick.</p>

<p>"But Janie and Rosslyn," faltered Gloriana faintly.  "Aren't
they too small<hr>"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's got a buckboard, too," grinned Billiard, who had recently
discovered the red-haired maid's poor little secret; but forbore
to make unkind remarks about it because he himself stood somewhat
in awe of the sleepy-eyed demons of the desert, since one had
unexpectedly kicked him when he was trying to mount.  "He drove
in for some provisions, and your father told him to bring us all
back with him, and we're to <em>camp</em> at the mines until Monday. 
Won't that be great? Whoop-ee!"  He leaped into the air, cracked
his heels together and came down with a resounding thump which
shook the whole house and made the dishes in the pantry rattle.</p>

<p>But no word of reproof was uttered, for Tabitha had seized the
half-dressed, half-combed Janie in her arms, and rushed from the
room. It seemed impossible that anyone could have come up that
narrow, rocky trail to the Eagles' Nest with a half dozen or more
burros and a buckboard without her having heard them, but there
they were lined up by the kitchen steps,&mdash;seven sleepy-eyed, wicked
little burros, saddled and bridled, and a pair of small, wiry
mustangs hitched to a light wagon, and driven by Decker Simmons,
Mr. Catt's partner.</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Decker!" Tabitha began.</p>

<p>"Didn't we tell you he was here?" exulted the two boys who had
followed her.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" she stammered.</p>

<p>"But she didn't b'lieve us," crowed Toady.</p>

<p>"I thought you must be mistaken," she confessed, "for I could
not imagine anyone so crazy as to want <em>ten</em> children under
foot at a mine. Whatever possessed Dad, Uncle Decker?"</p>

<p>The man laughed good-naturedly.  "Thought we all needed a vacation,
I reckon," he answered.  "Are you anywhere near ready?  Better
hurry. Sun will soon be unmercifully hot, and the canyon isn't
exactly within walking distance.  Can't I help?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks.  It won't take us long<hr>"</p>

<p>"We're ready now," announced the procession of girls crowded
around her.</p>

<p>"Mercy finished Janie's hair while you stood here gabbing.  Glory
packed up what duds we'd need, and Billiard's got the house all
locked up.  Who's to take which burro?"</p>

<p>"Makes no difference," answered the man, chuckling at the despatch
with which preparations for the outing were made.  "Put the little
tikes in here with me, and any of the rest of you who perfer the
buckboard can pile in.  That red&mdash;the girl with the game hip&mdash;you
better ride with us, too."</p>

<p>This suited Gloriana perfectly, and she lost no time in making
herself comfortable among the leather cushions with Rosslyn and
Janie beside her; but the rest of the party declined that method
of transportation, and mounted the animals standing patiently
in the scant shade of the porch.  In less time than it takes to
tell, the hilarious procession was on its way to the canyon, and
the baking town was left behind.</p>

<p>"Let's race," cried Billiard, who was mounted on an innocent-looking,
lazy beast.</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Susie, giving her animal a prod with a sharp
stick she had snatched from the woodpile as they clattered out
of the yard; and away they flew, shouting and flapping reins,
urging the stolid little burros out of their poky gait into a
surprised run.</p>

<p>But the race came to an abrupt and unexpected end.  Susie's mount
seemed more ambitious than its mates, or else the youthful rider
goaded it to desperation; for, with a mighty spurt, it took the
lead, and shot three lengths ahead of the rest, cantering off
across the desert as if racing were its daily delight.  Rosy-cheeked
Susie glanced back over her shoulder, waved the sharp stick triumphantly
in the air, and jeered, "Yah, yah!  Why don't you come along? 
Has you burro gone to sleep?"</p>

<p>This was too much for Billiard, and grabbing a needle-pointed
Spanish bayonet frond from the hands of his brother, he gave the
brown-coated beast beneath him a vicious stab, as he yelled in
disgust, "Giddap, you old demon!  Wake up and stretch your legs
a lit<hr>"</p>

<p>Brownie awoke into surprising activity, leaped forward with unseating
suddenness, planted his forefeet firmly among the rocks, and with
one deliberate, energetic kick, sent Billiard flying through the
air.  The watchers behind held their breath in terror.  Would
the boy be killed for his folly?  Then a wild shout of laughter
rose from eight throats. But who could have resisted it?  For
the luckless Billiard, after turning a summersault high in the
air, fell astraddle the neck of Toady's burro, and slipped to
the ground in a sprawling heap, while the second startled beast
bolted across the desert with its plucky rider still clinging
to its back.</p>

<p>The dazed Billiard picked himself up from the ground considerably
shaken but not hurt, and gazing ruefully first after his own fleeing
burro, and then after Toady's, now far in advance of Susie's little
animal, remarked, "Well, the old thing has got <em>some</em> ginger
in him after all!  Do you suppose I can ever catch him?"</p>

<p>"I'll help," quickly volunteered Tabitha, trying hard to suppress
her mirth, so meek and woebegone was the tumbled figure standing
in the roadway; and with a nimble spring she landed beside him,
tethering her burro to a yucca, growing close at hand.  Mercedes
and the twins followed her example, but it was a lively chase
they had before the unruly animal was finally captured, and the
party continued its journey, reaching their destination without
further mishap.</p>

<p>Gloriana was disappointed at first, as she looked about her while
her companions were dismounting, for she had expected to see a
canyon like those lovely spots hidden among the San Bernardino
hills; but this place was no different from the rocky, barren
mountains surrounding Silver Bow.  However, there was little time
for lamentations, for with surprising ingenuity, Mr. Catt had
arranged a delightful program for the two days the young folks
were in camp, and not a moment of the brief holiday was dull even
for Rosslyn and Janie.  So it was with reluctant hearts that the
party mounted their burros Monday morning for their return trip.</p>

<p>"Where are the boys?" inquired Mercedes curiously, as she sprang
nimbly into her saddle and gathered up the reins ready to start.</p>

<p>"Susie isn't here, either," said Tabitha, pausing in her task
of packing to count noses.  "They must be in the tent.  I saw
them not very long ago.  Dad, are the boys ready?"</p>

<p>"Haven't seen them," he answered emerging from one of the tents
with a light grip and dumping it into the back of the buckboard.</p>

<p>"I saw Billiard and Toady whispering something to Susie just
as the wagon drove up," tattled Inez, provoked to think she had
not been included in the secret, "and they all ran off that way." 
She pointed up the mountainside, where the mesquite and cacti
grew thickest, and huge boulders made climbing difficult.</p>

<p>"What in the world possessed them to go off like that?" fretted
Tabitha, impatient at the unexpected delay.</p>

<p>"Bet I know," Irene piped up.  "They prob'ly went for a last
look at the puppies."</p>

<p>"Puppies!" cried the others in amazement.  "Where are there any
puppies about here?"</p>

<p>"Quite a piece up there on the other side,&mdash;they weren't going
to tell the rest of us, but I happened to find them myself."</p>

<p>"Here they come now," Rosslyn excitedly interrupted; and sure
enough, the trio had appeared on the hillcrest, each tugging something
which squirmed and twisted, and snarled and yapped until their
flushed, panting owners could scarcely hold them.</p>

<p>"Holy snakes!" ejaculated Decker Simmons.</p>

<p>Mr. Catt whistled.  The rest of the party stared.</p>

<p>"What in creation have you got, Susie McKittrick?" demanded Mercedes,
with all the severity her gentle nature could muster, as the three
children came within speaking distance, Susie in advance.</p>

<p>"A pup," gasped the red-faced girl, taking a fresh grip on the
wriggling, sharp-nosed little animal, half hidden in the torn
skirt of her dress.  "Isn't he cute?  See what bright eyes he's
got."</p>

<p>"And see how you've snagged your clothes," said Irene reprovingly.</p>

<p>"And scratched your face," added Inez, glad now that she had
not been a party in the expedition.</p>

<p>"That's nothing to what Billiard's did to him," Susie retorted
sharply, nettled at her reception.  "He picked out the prettiest
of the bunch for Tabitha.  We told him how much you used to want
a dog all your own, Kitty.  But it's the wildest thing I ever
saw.  Here he comes now. Billiard, didn't you choose your pup
for Tabitha?"</p>

<p>"Would you accept it?" he panted somewhat shyly, embarrassed
and a little provoked that Susie should have announced his intentions
the first thing.  "I &mdash;I got the handsomest fellow of them
all, but I pretty near had to club it to death before it would
come along peaceably."</p>

<p>"But Billiard," gasped Tabitha, finding her tongue at last, "that
isn't a pup!"</p>

<p>"What is it then?"  Susie bristled so aggressively that she forgot
to keep a tight hold on her unwilling prisoner, and with a final
scratch and yap of exultation, it freed itself from her arms,
and darted away among the sagebrush.</p>

<p>"A coyote."</p>

<p>"No!"  Toady dropped his as if it were poison, and lifted startled
eyes to Tabitha's face.</p>

<p>"You're fooling!" cried Susie in exasperation over her loss.</p>

<p>"Dad, Uncle Decker, isn't that a baby coyote?"</p>

<p>Both men nodded silently, a look of amusement flickering about
their lips.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" spluttered Billiard, still hugging his half-smothered
treasure to his bosom.  "It&mdash;they <em>look</em> like pups."</p>

<p>"Yes, they do, but you found them pretty frisky for pups, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"They <em>were</em> pretty lively," admitted the older boy slowly.</p>

<p>"And as scratchy as&mdash;" began Toady.</p>

<p>"As <em>cats</em>," finished Susie, angry at Tabitha for calling
the animals coyotes, angry at her sisters for laughing, and angry
at herself for not knowing the truth of the matter without being
told.</p>

<p>"That's so, too," agreed Mr. Catt amiably.  "It beats me how
you ever managed to catch them."</p>

<p>"It was a job," sighed Billiard regretfully, freeing the pretty
little ball wrapped so snugly in his coat, and watching it skulk
away after its two brothers.  "We had some empty sacks<hr>"</p>

<p>"But they weren't much good," Susie broke in contemptuously. 
"If it hadn't been for that can of meat we swiped, we'd never
have caught 'em. They bite like everything, as well as scratch."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Billiard mournfully, taking the reins from Tabitha's
hands and mounting his burro, "and we had all our pains for nothing."</p>

<p>"Not quite," whispered Tabitha sympathetically.  "I understand,
and I'm glad you took such trouble for me.  But hurry.  It's late
already, and will be terribly hot before we reach home."</p>

<p>So the party said good-bye to the canyon and set out briskly
on their long ride back to Silver Bow, but Tabitha was exultant,
for Billiard, unruly, rebellious Billiard was at last completely
won.</p>
