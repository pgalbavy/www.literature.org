<p>Perhaps my young readers have wondered over the same fact that
used to puzzle me when a boy. While the civilized world was interested,
as it has been for hundreds of years, in trying to reach the Pole,
and the nations were constantly sending expeditions to search
for it, to be followed by others to hunt for the expeditions and
then by others to look up those that were hunting for the others
and so on, all these efforts were confined to the North Pole.
Everybody seemed to have forgotten that there is also a South
Pole, which is not a mile further from the equator than the North
Pole.</p>

<p>Of course there was good reason for all this. There is a great
deal of land in the north, while the unbroken ocean seas stretch
away from the South Pole for hundreds and thousands of miles in
every direction and the prodigious masses and mountains of ice
make it impossible to get anywhere near it. Our daring explorers
are continually edging further north, and doubtless within a few
years the Pole will be reached, but there appears no prospect
of the South Pole being seen for many a year to come.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>CAPTAIN CHARLES WILKES</em>.]</p>

<p>Lieutenant Charles Wilkes was born in 1798 and died in 1877.
He entered the American navy at an early age and in 1838 was made
commander of the squadron which spent four years in sailing through
the Pacific, along its American coasts and in the Antarctic regions.</p>

<p>Before giving an account of this memorable scientific expedition,
let me add a little more information concerning this distinguished
naval officer, since this is the only chapter which contains any
reference to him. He was made a captain in 1855. In the month
of November, 1861, while in command of the steamer <em>San Jacinto</em>,
he stopped the British ship <em>Trent</em> and forcibly took off
the two Confederate commissioners, Mason and Slidell, who were
on their way respectively to England and France to secure their
aid for the Southern Confederacy.</p>

<p>Captain Wilkes was highly applauded for his act by his countrymen,
but England was very indignant. It was an illegal proceeding on
his part, since the deck of a ship is the same as the soil of
the country whose flag she flies. Our Government was compelled
to disavow his action and restore the commissioners to English
custody.</p>

<p>In the War for the Union Captain Wilkes commanded the James River
squadron, was made commodore in 1862 and was retired in 1864 and
made rear-admiral on the retired list.</p>

<p>The scientific expedition of which Lieutenant Wilkes was given
command was intended, to quote the words of Congress, "for the
purpose of exploring and surveying the southern ocean, as well
to determine the existence of all doubtful islands and shoals
as to discover and accurately fix the position of those which
lie in or near the track of our vessels in that quarter and may
have escaped the observation of scientific navigators."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wilkes sailed from Hampton Roads on the 19th of August,
1838, his flagship being the 18-gun sloop-of-war <em>Vincennes</em>,
the 18-gun sloop-of-war <em>Peacock</em>, the 12-gun brig-of-war
<em>Porpoise</em>, the storeship <em>Relief</em>, the tender <em>Sea
Gull</em> and the tender <em>Flying Fish</em>. Since one of the
main objects was scientific research, the expedition was provided
with a philologist, naturalists, conchologists, mineralogist,
botanist, draughtsmen and a horticulturist.</p>

<p>A halt for a week was made at the Madeira Islands, when the ships
headed southward, reaching Rio Janeiro late in November. In January,
1839, they halted at Orange Harbor, Terra del Fuego, and made
it their base of operations. On the 25th of February Lieutenant
Wilkes, in the <em>Porpoise</em>, accompanied by the <em>Sea Gull</em>,
started for the South Pole. On the 1st of March considerable ice
and snow were encountered and an island sighted, but the men could
not land because of the surf. The next day the Ashland Islands
were discovered and soon after the two vessels reached Palmersland.
The following is the account of Lieutenant Wilkes:</p>

<p>"It was a day of great excitement to all, for we had ice of all
kinds to encounter, from the iceberg of huge quadrangular shape,
with its stratified appearance, to the sunken and deceptive masses
that were difficult to perceive before they were under the bow.
I have rarely seen a finer sight. The sea was literally studded
with these beautiful masses, some of pure white, others showing
all shades of the opal, others emerald green and occasionally,
here and there, some of deep black. Our situation was critical,
but the weather favored us for a few hours. On clearing these
dangers we kept off to the south and west under all sail, and
at 9 <em>P.M. </em>we counted eight large islands. Afterward the
weather became so thick with mist and fog as to render it necessary
to lie to till daylight, before which time we had a heavy snowstorm.
A strong gale now set in from the southwest; the deck of the brig
was covered with ice and snow and the weather became exceedingly
damp and cold. The men were suffering not only from want of sufficient
room but from the inadequacy of the clothing."</p>

<p>Naturally the further south they penetrated the greater became
their danger from the increasing fields of ice and icebergs. The
<em>Peacock</em> and <em>Flying Fish</em> left Orange Harbor on
the same day with the <em>Porpoise</em> and <em>Sea Gull</em>.
They were separated by a gale and the <em>Peacock</em> was continually
beset by icebergs. Every rope and the deck, spars and rigging
were thickly coated with ice. Some days later the <em>Flying Fish</em>
was met and she reported that she had penetrated to the parallel
of 70 degrees. There was imminent danger of being frozen in, and,
as they were short of provisions, they sailed northward. The <em>Flying
Fish</em> reached Orange Harbor in April, while the <em>Peacock</em>
continued on to Valparaiso, where the storeship <em>Relief</em>
was found. In May the other members of the squadron arrived at
the port, with the exception of the <em>Sea Gull</em>, which was
never heard of again.</p>

<p>The squadron now crossed the Pacific, reaching Sydney, New South
Wales, in the latter part of November. There, after consulting
with his officers, Lieutenant Wilkes decided to make another Antarctic
cruise. The <em>Flying Fish</em> proved so unseaworthy that, after
passing through a violent storm, she was obliged to return to
port and took no further part in the enterprise.</p>

<p>Once more among the ice fields, the ships were menaced by danger
from every side. Some of the escapes were of the most thrilling
nature. One of the ships barely missed being crushed by hundreds
of tons of ice which fell from the top of an overhanging iceberg.
The weather was intensely cold and the snow and fine sleet which
were whirled horizontally through the air cut the face like bird
shot.</p>

<p>The <em>Vincennes</em> prowled along the edge of the Antarctic
Continent as far as 97 degrees east, when Lieutenant Wilkes headed
northward and arrived at Sydney in March, 1840, and found the
<em>Peacock</em> at anchor. The <em>Porpoise</em> reached 100
degrees east and 64 degrees 65 minutes south when she turned her
prow away from the inhospitable solitude and in March arrived
at Auckland Isle.</p>

<p>The following summer was spent in exploring the islands of the
Southern Archipelago. A party was engaged in a launch and cutter,
when a tempest compelled them to run into a bay of the Fiji group
for shelter. While working its way back the cutter ran upon a
reef and was attacked by the natives. The ammunition of the Americans
was wet and they abandoned the cutter and returned to the <em>Vincennes</em>.</p>

<p>Since these natives needed a lesson, Lieutenant Wilkes landed
a force and burned the native village. A few days later an exploring
party was again attacked while trying to trade with the natives.
The men were forced to retreat to their boats, under a hot fire,
many of the savages using muskets with no little skill. Reinforcements
were landed and the savages put to flight, but in the fighting
Midshipman Underwood and Henry Wilkes were mortally hurt and a
seaman dangerously wounded.</p>

<p>Matters had now assumed so serious a shape that a detachment
of seventy officers and men landed at another point on the island
and marched upon the nearest village, laying waste the crops as
they advanced. When the village was reached it was found to be
defended by a strong stockade, with a trench inside, from which
the crouching natives could fire through loopholes, while outside
of the stockade was a deep ditch of water. Feeling their position
impregnable, the savages flourished their weapons and uttered
tantalizing whoops at the white men. The whoops quickly changed
when the cabins within the stockade were set on fire by a rocket.
The natives fled, leaving the village to be burned to ashes. The
Americans pushed hostilities so aggressively that on the following
day the islanders sued for peace.</p>

<p>The squadron next sailed to the Hawaiian Islands, where several
months were spent in exploration. Then the coast of Oregon was
visited and the <em>Peacock</em> suffered wreck at the mouth of
the Columbia. Doubling the Cape of Good Hope, the expedition reached
New York in June, 1842, having been gone nearly four years and
having sailed more than 30,000 miles.</p>
