<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>With the escapade that landed me in the Tolbooth there came an
end to the nightmare years of my first youth. A week later I got
word that my father was dead of an ague in the Low Countries,
and I had to be off post-haste to Auchencairn to see to the ordering
of our little estate. We were destined to be bitter poor, what
with dues and regalities incident on the passing of the ownership,
and I thought it best to leave my mother to farm it, with the
help of Robin Gilfillan the grieve, and seek employment which
would bring me an honest penny. Her one brother, Andrew Sempill,
from whom I was named, was a merchant in Glasgow, the owner of
three ships that traded to the Western Seas, and by repute a man
of a shrewd and venturesome temper. He was single, too, and I
might reasonably look to be his heir; so when a letter came from
him offering me a hand in his business, my mother was instant
for my going. I was little loath myself, for I saw nothing now
to draw me to the profession of the law, which had been my first
notion. "Hame's hame," runs the proverb, "as the devil said when
he found himself in the Court of Session," and I had lost any
desire for that sinister company. Besides, I liked the notion
of having to do with ships and far lands; for I was at the age
when youth burns fiercely in a lad, and his fancy is as riotous
as a poet's.</p>

<p>Yet the events I have just related had worked a change in my
life. They had driven the unthinking child out of me and forced
me to reflect on my future. Two things rankled in my soul&mdash;a wench's
mocking laughter and the treatment I had got from the dragoon.
It was not that I was in love with the black-haired girl; indeed,
I think I hated her; but I could not get her face out of my head
or her voice out of my ears. She had mocked me, treated me as
if I was no more than a foolish servant, and my vanity was raw.
I longed to beat down her pride, to make her creep humbly to me,
Andrew Garvald, as her only deliverer; and how that should be
compassed was the subject of many hot fantasies in my brain. The
dragoon, too, had tossed me about like a silly sheep, and my manhood
cried out at the recollection. What sort of man was I if any lubberly
soldier could venture on such liberties?</p>

<p>I went into the business with the monstrous solemnity of youth,
and took stock of my equipment as if I were casting up an account.
Many a time in those days I studied my appearance in the glass
like a foolish maid. I was not well featured, having a freckled,
square face, a biggish head, a blunt nose, grey, colourless eyes,
and a sandy thatch of hair, I had great square shoulders, but
my arms were too short for my stature, and&mdash;from an accident in
my nursing days&mdash;of indifferent strength. All this stood on the
debit side of my account. On the credit side I set down that I
had unshaken good health and an uncommon power of endurance, especially
in the legs. There was no runner in the Upper Ward of Lanark who
was my match, and I had travelled the hills so constantly in all
weathers that I had acquired a gipsy lore in the matter of beasts
and birds and wild things, I had long, clear, unerring eyesight,
which had often stood me in good stead in the time of my father's
troubles. Of moral qualities, Heaven forgive me, I fear I thought
less; but I believed, though I had been little proved, that I
was as courageous as the common run of men.</p>

<p>All this looks babyish in the writing, but there was a method
in this self-examination. I believed that I was fated to engage
in strange ventures, and I wanted to equip myself for the future.
The pressing business was that of self-defence, and I turned first
to a gentleman's proper weapon, the sword. Here, alas! I was doomed
to a bitter disappointment. My father had given me a lesson now
and then, but never enough to test me, and when I came into the
hands of a Glasgow master my unfitness was soon manifest. Neither
with broadsword nor small sword could I acquire any skill. My
short arm lacked reach and vigour, and there seemed to be some
stiffness in wrist and elbow and shoulder which compelled me to
yield to smaller men. Here was a pretty business, for though gentleman
born I was as loutish with a gentleman's weapon as any country
hind.</p>

<p>This discovery gave me some melancholy weeks, but I plucked up
heart and set to reasoning. If my hand were to guard my head it
must find some other way of it. My thoughts turned to powder and
shot, to the musket and the pistol. Here was a weapon which needed
only a stout nerve, a good eye, and a steady hand; one of these
I possessed to the full, and the others were not beyond my attainment.
There lived an armourer in the Gallowgate, one Weir, with whom
I began to spend my leisure. There was an alley by the Molendinar
Burn, close to the archery butts, where he would let me practise
at a mark with guns from his store. Soon to my delight I found
that here was a weapon with which I need fear few rivals. I had
a natural genius for the thing, as some men have for sword-play,
and Weir was a zealous teacher, for he loved his flint-locks.</p>

<p>"See, Andrew," he would cry, "this is the true leveller of mankind.
It will make the man his master's equal, for though your gentleman
may cock on a horse and wave his Andrew Ferrara, this will bring
him off it. Brains, my lad, will tell in coming days, for it takes
a head to shoot well, though any flesher may swing a sword."</p>

<p>The better marksman I grew the less I liked the common make of
guns, and I cast about to work an improvement. I was especially
fond of the short gun or pistol, not the bell-mouthed thing which
shot a handful of slugs, and was as little precise in its aim
as a hailstorm, but the light foreign pistol which, shot as true
as a musket. Weir had learned his trade in Italy, and was a neat
craftsman, so I employed him to make me a pistol after my own
pattern. The butt was of light, tough wood, and brass-bound, for
I did not care to waste money on ornament. The barrel was shorter
than the usual, and of the best Spanish metal, and the pan and
the lock were set after my own device. Nor was that all, for I
became an epicure in the matter of bullets, and made my own with
the care of a goldsmith. I would weigh out the powder charges
as nicely as an apothecary weighs his drugs, for I had discovered
that with the pistol the weight of bullet and charge meant much
for good marksmanship. From Weir I got the notion of putting up
ball and powder in cartouches, and I devised a method of priming
much quicker and surer than the ordinary. In one way and another
I believe I acquired more skill in the business than anybody then
living in Scotland. I cherished my toy like a lover; I christened
it "Elspeth "; it lay by my bed at night, and lived by day in
a box of sweet-scented foreign wood given me by one of my uncle's
skippers. I doubt I thought more of it than of my duty to my Maker.</p>

<p>All the time I was very busy at Uncle Andrew's counting-house
in the Candleriggs, and down by the river-side among the sailors.
It was the day when Glasgow was rising from a cluster of streets
round the High Kirk and College to be the chief merchants' resort
in Scotland. Standing near the Western Seas, she turned her eyes
naturally to the Americas, and a great trade was beginning in
tobacco and raw silk from Virginia, rich woods and dye stuffs
from the Main, and rice and fruits from the Summer Islands. The
river was too shallow for ships of heavy burthen, so it was the
custom to unload in the neighbourhood of Greenock and bring the
goods upstream in barges to the quay at the Broomielaw. There
my uncle, in company with other merchants, had his warehouse,
but his counting-house was up in the town, near by the College,
and I spent my time equally between the two places. I became furiously
interested in the work, for it has ever been my happy fortune
to be intent on whatever I might be doing at the moment. I think
I served my uncle well, for I had much of the merchant's aptitude,
and the eye to discern far-away profits. He liked my boldness,
for I was impatient of the rule-of-thumb ways of some of our fellow-traders.
"We are dealing with new lands," I would say, "and there is need
of new plans. It pays to think in trading as much as in statecraft,"
There were plenty that looked askance at us, and cursed us as
troublers of the peace, and there were some who prophesied speedy
ruin. But we discomforted our neighbours by prospering mightily,
so that there was talk of Uncle Andrew for the Provost's chair
at the next vacancy.</p>

<p>They were happy years, the four I spent in Glasgow, for I was
young and ardent, and had not yet suffered the grave miscarriage
of hope which is our human lot. My uncle was a busy merchant,
but he was also something of a scholar, and was never happier
than when disputing some learned point with a college professor
over a bowl of punch. He was a great fisherman, too, and many
a salmon I have seen him kill between the town and Rutherglen
in the autumn afternoons. He treated me like a son, and by his
aid I completed my education by much reading of books and a frequent
attendance at college lectures. Such leisure as I had I spent
by the river-side talking with the ship captains and getting news
of far lands. In this way I learned something of the handling
of a ship, and especially how to sail a sloop alone in rough weather,
I have ventured, myself the only crew, far down the river to the
beginning of the sealocks, and more than once escaped drowning
by a miracle. Of a Saturday I would sometimes ride out to Auchencairn
to see my mother and assist with my advice the work of Robin Gilfillan.
Once I remember I rode to Carnwath, and looked again on the bleak
house where the girl Elspeth had sung to me in the rain. I found
it locked and deserted, and heard from a countrywoman that the
folk had gone. "And a guid riddance," said the woman. "The Blairs
was aye a cauld and oppressive race, and they were black Prelatists
forbye. But I whiles miss yon hellicat lassie. She had a cheery
word for a'body, and she keepit the place frae languor."</p>

<p>But I cannot linger over the tale of those peaceful years when
I have so much that is strange and stirring to set down. Presently
came the Revolution, when King James fled overseas, and the Dutch
King William reigned in his stead. The event was a godsend to
our trade, for with Scotland in a bicker with Covenants and dragoonings,
and new taxes threatened with each new Parliament, a merchant's
credit was apt to be a brittle thing. The change brought a measure
of security, and as we prospered I soon began to see that something
must be done in our Virginian trade. Years before, my uncle had
sent out a man, Lambie by name, who watched his interests in that
country. But we had to face such fierce rivalry from the Bristol
merchants that I had small confidence in Mr. Lambie, who from
his letters was a sleepy soul. I broached the matter to my uncle,
and offered to go myself and put things in order. At first he
was unwilling to listen. I think he was sorry to part with me,
for we had become close friends, and there was also the difficulty
of my mother, to whom I was the natural protector. But his opposition
died down when I won my mother to my side, and when I promised
that I would duly return. I pointed out that Glasgow and Virginia
were not so far apart. Planters from the colony would dwell with
us for a season, and their sons often come to Glasgow for their
schooling. You could see the proud fellows walking the streets
in brave clothes, and marching into the kirk on Sabbath with a
couple of servants carrying cushions and Bibles. In the better
class of tavern one could always meet with a Virginian or two
compounding their curious drinks, and swearing their outlandish
oaths. Most of them had gone afield from Scotland, and it was
a fine incentive to us young men to see how mightily they had
prospered. My uncle yielded, and it was arranged that I should
sail with the first convoy of the New Year. From the moment of
the decision I walked the earth in a delirium of expectation.
That February, I remember, was blue and mild, with soft airs blowing
up the river. Down by the Broomielaw I found a new rapture in
the smell of tar and cordage, and the queer foreign scents in
my uncle's warehouse. Every skipper and greasy sailor became for
me a figure of romance. I scanned every outland face, wondering
if I should meet it again in the New World. A negro in cotton
drawers, shivering in our northern dune, had more attraction for
me than the fairest maid, and I was eager to speak with all and
every one who had crossed the ocean. One bronzed mariner with
silver earrings I entertained to three stoups of usquebaugh, hoping
for strange tales, but the little I had from him before he grew
drunk was that he had once voyaged to the Canaries. You may imagine
that I kept my fancies to myself, and was outwardly only the sober
merchant with a mind set on freights and hogsheads. But whoever
remembers his youth will know that such terms to me were not the
common parlance of trade. The very names of the tobaccos Negro's
Head, Sweet-scented, Oronoke, Carolina Red, Gloucester Glory,
Golden Rod sang in my head like a tune, that told of green forests
and magic islands.</p>

<p>But an incident befell ere I left which was to have unforeseen
effects on my future. One afternoon I was in the shooting alley
I have spoken of, making trial of a new size of bullet I had moulded.
The place was just behind Parlane's tavern, and some gentlemen,
who had been drinking there, came out to cool their heads and
see the sport. Most of them were cock-lairds from the Lennox,
and, after the Highland fashion, had in their belts heavy pistols
of the old kind which folk called "dags." They were cumbrous,
ill-made things, gaudily ornamented with silver and Damascus work,
fit ornaments for a savage Highland chief, but little good for
serious business, unless a man were only a pace or two from his
opponent. One of them, who had drunk less than the others, came
up to me and very civilly proposed a match. I was nothing loath,
so a course was fixed, and a mutchkin of French <em>eau de vie</em>
named as the prize. I borrowed an old hat from the landlord which
had stuck in its side a small red cockade. The thing was hung
as a target in a leafless cherry tree at twenty paces, and the
cockade was to be the centre mark. Each man was to fire three
shots apiece.</p>

<p>Barshalloch&mdash;for so his companions called my opponent after his
lairdship&mdash;made a great to-do about the loading, and would not
be content till he had drawn the charge two&mdash;three times. The
spin of a coin gave him first shot, and he missed the mark and
cut the bole of the tree.</p>

<p>"See," I said, "I will put my ball within a finger's-breadth
of his." Sure enough, when they looked, the two bullets were all
but in the same hole.</p>

<p>His second shot took the hat low down on its right side, and
clipped away a bit of the brim. I saw by this time that the man
could shoot, though he had a poor weapon and understood little
about it. So I told the company that I would trim the hat by slicing
a bit from the other side. This I achieved, though by little,
for my shot removed only half as much cloth as its predecessor.
But the performance amazed the onlookers. "Ye've found a fair
provost at the job, Barshalloch," one of them hiccupped. "Better
quit and pay for the mutchkin."</p>

<p>My antagonist took every care with his last shot, and, just missing
the cockade, hit the hat about the middle, cut the branch on which
it rested, and brought it fluttering to the ground a pace or two
farther on. It lay there, dimly seen through a low branch of the
cherry tree, with the cockade on the side nearest me. It was a
difficult mark, but the light was good and my hand steady. I walked
forward and brought back the hat with a hole drilled clean through
the cockade.</p>

<p>At that there was a great laughter, and much jocosity from the
cock-lairds at their friend's expense. Barshalloch very handsomely
complimented me, and sent for the mutchkin. His words made me
warm towards him, and I told him that half the business was not
my skill of shooting but the weapon I carried.</p>

<p>He begged for a look at it, and examined it long and carefully.</p>

<p>"Will ye sell, friend?" he asked. "I'll give ye ten golden guineas
and the best filly that ever came out o' Strathendrick for that
pistol."</p>

<p>But I told him that the offer of Strathendrick itself would not
buy it.</p>

<p>"No?" said he. "Well, I won't say ye're wrong. A man should cherish
his weapon like his wife, for it carries his honour."</p>

<p>Presently, having drunk the wager, they went indoors again, all
but a tall fellow who had been a looker-on, but had not been of
the Lennox company. I had remarked him during the contest, a long,
lean man with a bright, humorous blue eye and a fiery red head.
He was maybe ten years older than me, and though he was finely
dressed in town clothes, there was about his whole appearance
a smack of the sea. He came forward, and, in a very Highland voice,
asked my name.</p>

<p>"Why should I tell you?" I said, a little nettled.</p>

<p>"Just that I might carry it in my head. I have seen some pretty
shooting in my day, but none like yours, young one. What's your
trade that ye've learned the pistol game so cleverly?"</p>

<p>Now I was flushed with pride, and in no mood for a stranger's
patronage. So I told him roundly that it was none of his business,
and pushed by him to Parlane's back-door. But my brusqueness gave
no offence to this odd being. He only laughed and cried after
me that, if my manners were the equal of my marksmanship, I would
be the best lad he had seen since his home-coming.</p>

<p>I had dinner with my uncle in the Candleriggs, and sat with him
late afterwards casting up accounts, so it was not till nine o'clock
that I set out on my way to my lodgings. These were in the Saltmarket,
close on the river front, and to reach them I went by the short
road through the Friar's Vennel. It was an ill-reputed quarter
of the town, and not long before had been noted as a haunt of
coiners; but I had gone through it often, and met with no hindrance.</p>

<p>In the vennel stood a tall dark bit of masonry called Gilmour's
Lordship, which was pierced by long closes from which twisting
stairways led to the upper landings. I was noting its gloomy aspect
under the dim February moon, when a man came towards me and turned
into one of the closes. He swung along with a free, careless gait
that marked him as no townsman, and ere he plunged into the darkness
I had a glimpse of fiery hair. It was the stranger who had accosted
me in Parlane's alley, and he was either drunk or in wild spirits,
for he was singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"We're a' dry wi' the drinkin' o't,<br/>
&nbsp;We're a' dry wi' the drinkin' o't.<br/>
&nbsp;The minister kissed the fiddler's wife,<br/>
&nbsp;And he couldna preach for thinkin' o't."

</p>
</div>
<p>The ribald chorus echoed from the close mouth.</p>

<p>Then I saw that he was followed by three others, bent, slinking
fellows, who slipped across the patches of moonlight, and eagerly
scanned the empty vennel. They could not see me, for I was in
shadow, and presently they too entered the close.</p>

<p>The thing looked ugly, and, while I had no love for the red-haired
man, I did not wish to see murder or robbery committed and stand
idly by. The match of the afternoon had given me a fine notion
of my prowess, though. Had I reflected, my pistol was in its case
at home, and I had no weapon but a hazel staff. Happily in youth
the blood is quicker than the brain, and without a thought I ran
into the close and up the long stairway.</p>

<p>The chorus was still being sung ahead of me, and then it suddenly
ceased. In dead silence and in pitchy darkness I struggled up
the stone steps, wondering what I should find at the next turning.
The place was black as night, the steps were uneven, and the stairs
corkscrewed most wonderfully. I wished with all my heart that
I had not come, as I groped upwards hugging the wall.</p>

<p>Then a cry came and a noise of hard breathing. At the same moment
a door opened somewhere above my head, and a faint glow came down
the stairs. Presently with a great rumble a heavy man came rolling
past me, butting with his head at the stair-side. He came to anchor
on a landing below me, and finding his feet plunged downwards
as if the devil were at his heels. He left behind him a short
Highland knife, which I picked up and put in my pocket.</p>

<p>On his heels came another with his hand clapped to his side,
and he moaned as he slithered past me. Something dripped from
him on the stone steps.</p>

<p>The light grew stronger, and as I rounded the last turning a
third came bounding down, stumbling from wall to wall like a drunk
man. I saw his face clearly, and if ever mortal eyes held baffled
murder it was that fellow's. There was a dark mark on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Above me as I blinked stood my red-haired friend on the top landing.
He had his sword drawn, and was whistling softly through his teeth,
while on the right hand was an open door and an old man holding
a lamp.</p>

<p>"Ho!" he cried. "Here comes a fourth. God's help, it's my friend
the marksman!"</p>

<p>I did not like that naked bit of steel, but there was nothing
for it but to see the thing through. When he saw that I was unarmed
he returned his weapon to its sheath, and smiled broadly down
on me.</p>

<p>"What brings my proud gentleman up these long stairs?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I saw you entering the close and three men following you. It
looked bad, so I came up to see fair play."</p>

<p>"Did ye so? And a very pretty intention, Mr. What's-your-name.
But ye needna have fashed yourself. Did ye see any of our friends
on the stairs?"</p>

<p>"I met a big man rolling down like a football," I said.</p>

<p>"Ay, that would be Angus. He's a clumsy stot, and never had much
sense."</p>

<p>"And I met another with his hand on his side," I said.</p>

<p>"That would be little James. He's a fine lad with a skean-dhu
on a dark night, but there was maybe too much light here for his
trade."</p>

<p>"And I met a third who reeled like a drunk man," I said.</p>

<p>"Ay," said he meditatively, "that was Long Colin. He's the flower
o' the flock, and I had to pink him. At another time and in a
better place I would have liked a bout with him, for he has some
notion of sword-play."</p>

<p>"Who were the men?" I asked, in much confusion, for this laughing
warrior perplexed me.</p>

<p>"Who but just my cousins from Glengyle. There has long been a
sort of bicker between us, and they thought they had got a fine
chance of ending it."</p>

<p>"And who, in Heaven's name, are you," I said, "that treats murder
so lightly?"</p>

<p>"Me?" he repeated. "Well, I might give ye the answer you gave
me this very day when I speired the same question. But I am frank
by nature, and I see you wish me well. Come in bye, and we'll
discuss the matter."</p>

<p>He led me into a room where a cheerful fire crackled, and got
out from a press a bottle and glasses. He produced tobacco from
a brass box and filled a long pipe.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "we'll understand each other better. Ye see before
you a poor gentleman of fortune, whom poverty and a roving spirit
have driven to outland bits o' the earth to ply his lawful trade
of sea-captain. They call me by different names. I have passed
for a Dutch skipper, and a Maryland planter, and a French trader,
and, in spite of my colour, I have been a Spanish don in the Main.
At Tortuga you will hear one name, and another at Port o' Spain,
and a third at Cartagena. But, seeing we are in the city o' Glasgow
in the kindly kingdom o' Scotland, I'll be honest with you. My
father called me Ninian Campbell, and there's no better blood
in Breadalbane."</p>

<p>What could I do after that but make him a present of the trivial
facts about myself and my doings? There was a look of friendly
humour about this dare-devil which captured my fancy. I saw in
him the stuff of which adventurers are made, and though I was
a sober merchant, I was also young. For days I had been dreaming
of foreign parts and an Odyssey of strange fortunes, and here
on a Glasgow stairhead I had found Ulysses himself.</p>

<p>"Is it not the pity," he cried, "that such talents as yours should
rust in a dark room in the Candleriggs? Believe me, Mr. Garvald,
I have seen some pretty shots, but I have never seen your better."</p>

<p>Then I told him that I was sailing within a month for Virginia,
and he suddenly grew solemn.</p>

<p>"It looks like Providence," he said, "that we two should come
together. I, too, will soon be back in the Western Seas, and belike
we'll meet. I'm something of a rover, and I never bide long in
the same place, but I whiles pay a visit to James Town, and they
ken me well on the Eastern Shore and the Accomac beaches."</p>

<p>He fell to giving me such advice as a traveller gives to a novice.
It was strange hearing for an honest merchant, for much of it
was concerned with divers ways of outwitting the law. By and by
he was determined to convoy me to my lodgings, for he pointed
out that I was unarmed; and I think, too, he had still hopes of
another meeting with Long Colin, his cousin.</p>

<p>"I leave Glasgow the morrow's morn," he said, "and it's no likely
we'll meet again in Scotland. Out in Virginia, no doubt, you'll
soon be a great man, and sit in Council, and hob-nob with the
Governor. But a midge can help an elephant, and I would gladly
help you, for you had the goodwill to help me. If ye need aid
you will go to Mercer's Tavern at James Town down on the water
front, and you will ask news of Ninian Campbell. The man will
say that he never heard tell of the name, and then you will speak
these words to him. You will say 'The lymphads are on the loch,
and the horn of Diarmaid has sounded.' Keep them well in mind,
for some way or other they will bring you and me together."</p>

<p>Without another word he was off, and as I committed the gibberish
to memory I could hear his song going up the Saltmarket:&mdash;</p>
