<p>You will recall that when Red Feather wedged himself in the narrow
window he said, in answer to the sharp questioning of Melville
Clarendon, that the Muddy Creek band of Sioux were so far off
that nothing was to be feared from them.</p>

<p>The original band of marauders numbered over a score, and were
under the joint leadership of Tall Bear and Red Feather, both
of whom were eager to sweep along the thin line of settlements
like a cyclone, scattering death and destruction in their path.
It may strike you that so small a force was hardly equal to the
task of such a raid; but I have only to remind you that the famous
Geronimo and his Apaches, who made their home among the alkali
deserts and mountain fastnesses of Arizona and New Mexico, numbered
few warriors at times, and yet they baffled for years a regiment
of United States cavalry. It was only when the chieftain chose
to come in and surrender himself under the pledge of good treatment
that hostilities ended.</p>

<p>The twenty-odd horsemen under the leadership of Red Feather and
Tall Bear were fitting types of that savage horde which in the
early summer of 1876 blotted out General Custer and his troops.
It so happened, however, with the smaller party that they found
no such favoring circumstances to help them. At the first settler's
cabin assailed they discovered the inmates ready for them. In
some way or other, several families had learned of their danger
in time to prepare for their assailants.</p>

<p>It was clear to the Indians that the settlers in that section
had taken the alarm, and Red Feather proposed they should abandon
their first plan and push northward towards Barwell, attacking
the isolated homes to the south of that settlement. Tall Bear
opposed so warmly, and with such slurs on his rival, that a personal
conflict was narrowly averted.</p>

<p>The end of the quarrel was that Red Feather, with five of his
followers, drew off from the rest and rode northward. The result
of this separation was unsatisfactory to both parties.</p>

<p>The friendly Indian who had hastened toward Barwell to warn the
pioneers of their danger did his work so well that hardly one
was neglected. The inmates of the first cabin attacked by Red
Feather were awaiting him. Only a few shots were exchanged, when
the wrathful chieftain withdrew, and, pushing to the northward,
next swooped down on the dwelling of Archibald Clarendon.</p>

<p>No resistance was encountered there, for, as you know, the inmates
had left some time before. For some reason never fully explained,
Red Feather did not fire the buildings at once. Shortly after,
Melville Clarendon and his sister appeared on the scene, and the
incidents which followed have already been told.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tall Bear and his warriors met with no better success
than the smaller party. The proof became so strong that the whole
district was on the alert that he abruptly changed his mind and
led his warriors at a sweeping gallop to the northward over the
trail of Red Feather and his warriors.</p>

<p>When he arrived on the scene he heard the curious story the five
warriors had to tell. A dwelling at last had been found in which
the occupants were not fully prepared, or rather, were so insignificant
in strength that no company of Sioux, however small, could consent
to a repulse.</p>

<p>But there stood the cabin defying them. Red Feather had forced
his way partly through the window and then was caught so fast
that, but for the mercy of the sturdy youth within, he would have
been killed without being able to use a finger to defend himself.</p>

<p>Among the whole party who heard the remarkable narrative, there
was not one who would have thought of keeping a promise made under
such circumstances as was that of the chief. No pledge could have
been more solemn, and yet those are the very ones that are first
repudiated by the red man.</p>

<p>To Tall Bear and his band the action of Red Feather in descending
the chimney was natural. The bitterest enemy of the chieftain
never questioned his courage, and, knowing how chagrined he must
feel over his mishap, they could understand the desperate feeling
that prompted the deed, the like of which was seldom if ever known
before.</p>

<p>There was little said about Red Feather's wish to keep his agreement
with Melville, for the reason I have already hinted&mdash;his proposal
to do so was not earnest enough to mislead them.</p>

<p>But to the Sioux outside it looked very much as if the descent
of the chimney by the chief had marked the end of his career.
Among all the warriors there was not one who believed the truth&mdash;that
he had been changed from the fiercest enemy into the most beloved
friend of the boy and girl.</p>

<p>The tantalizing shout of Melville from the window was proof to
the warriors that Red Feather had been slain by the boy, though,
as I have said, no report of a gun was heard from within the building.</p>

<p>The chieftain's course, after proving himself a friend of the
brother and sister, showed his desire to keep his presence in
the house unsuspected by his own people. He took care that no
glimpse of him was caught through the windows, and he refrained
from firing when he had any number of chances to bring down an
Indian.</p>

<p>Doubtless there were several reasons for this forbearance. Such
a shot would be credited to Melville, and might excite the Sioux
to an attack too furious to be resisted. At the same time, it
is hardly to be supposed that Red Feather's feelings had so changed,
because of his wish to save Dot and her brother, that he was ready
to turn about and begin shooting at the very ones whom he had
led on this raid.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Tall Bear grieved any more over the loss
of his rival leader than did most of the warriors. He prudently
uttered some words of sympathy, but they hardly deceived those
who heard them. They agreed with him, however, in declaring that
his fall must be avenged, and that the boy who had caused his
death, as well as his little sister, must suffer torture-punishment
for the deed.</p>

<p>Several circuits around the building proved that it could hardly
be carried by the most determined assault in their power. All
the windows were too narrow to be used as a means of entrance,
even if any one was brave enough to repeat the disastrous experiment
of the other chief. The single door had already resisted the strongest
shock they could give it, and no weak point was visible.</p>

<p>True, the path used by Red Feather when he finally succeeded
in gaining the interior was open to the rest; but it is no reflection
on their courage to say that among the whole party there was not
one willing to head the procession down the chimney, even though
but a solitary boy and a single rifle stood in the way.</p>

<p>Clearly there was one means at the command of Tall Bear and his
Sioux which was not only terrible, but effective. They could set
fire to the building and reduce it to ashes.</p>

<p>The lookout on the hill reported the horizon clear in every direction;
and, since his wide sweep of vision extended toward every point
of the compass, he was able to discover the approach of hostile
horsemen a good while before they could reach the spot. He knew
that if help came it would be from the northward, where Barwell
lay, whither Mr. Clarendon and his wife had hurried on the first
alarm. The prairie for a couple of miles was under a scrutiny
that would let nothing escape.</p>

<p>The circumstances were so favorable that Tall Bear and his party
decided to indulge in a feast. Enough poultry were wandering about
the premises to afford a fine meal for a larger band than he had
with him, and it took only a short time to wring the necks of
more than a score of ducks and chickens.</p>

<p>The Sioux gathered to the westward of the barn and ate like so
many wild animals until all were satisfied. The meal finished,
they gave their attention to the serious business before them.
Had the incidents I am relating taken place half a century ago,
the red men would have been obliged to resort to the old-fashioned
flint and steel with which our forefathers used to start a fire;
but they were abreast of these modern times to that extent that
nearly every one carried more or less lucifer-matches.</p>

<p>The favoring wind led to the barn being fired, under the belief
that the flames would quickly communicate with the house but a
short distance off; but, as you have learned, Providence favored
the threatened ones to that extent that the breeze changed its
course, and for a time Dot and Melville were saved.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "His attention was drawn to the sentinel on the
hill." &mdash;Page 86]</p>

<p>Tall Bear and the Sioux waited till, to their disappointment
and surprise, they saw the barn sink into blazing ruins and leave
the house intact.</p>

<p>The next proceeding was to gather what embers they could and
pile them against the dwelling, where they speedily burst into
flames. It now looked certain that the structure was doomed; but
the heavy logs, although dry on the outside, were damp within.
It takes such timber a long time to part with its natural moisture,
and, fortunately for our friends, a driving rain-storm less than
a week previous had so soaked the wood that only an intense and
long-continued heat could set it aflame. The logs were charred
and scorched, and more than once appeared to be on the point of
breaking into a roaring blaze; but the brands piled against the
end of the house finally sank down to embers and ashes, and though
considerable smoke arose, the house stood really as firm and as
strong as at the first.</p>

<p>This was a keener disappointment than Tall Bear had yet met,
for it looked as though the most potent if not the only means
at his command was powerless to bring the boy to terms.</p>

<p>The chieftain himself examined the logs which had been subjected
to the fire. He dug his hunting-knife into them, and soon discovered
why they resisted the fire so effectually. Then he tested other
parts of the house in the same manner and with the same result.</p>

<p>For the first time since his arrival on the spot he was forced
to see the probability of another failure. His career from the
hour he bounded upon his pony and entered so eagerly on the raid
had been a continual disappointment. He was angered and resentful
toward the supposed dead Red Feather, because he allowed himself
to be baffled at the beginning by a solitary boy.</p>

<p>Tall Bear's pride was stirred, and he was unwilling to confess
himself beaten after openly blaming his predecessor for failing
to capture the place with less than one-third of his force.</p>

<p>But there seemed to be no help for it, unless he should persevere
with the fire until the logs of the house were forced into combustion.
They must yield in time, if the effort was kept up; and he was
on the point of renewing the attempt on a larger scale than before
when his attention was drawn to the sentinel on the hill, who
uttered the startling cry that horsemen were in sight to the northward.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "More Sioux comin'&mdash;open door quick." &mdash;Page
90]</p>

<p>The chief and the warriors who were not already on the spot hurried
thither to learn what it meant.</p>

<p>As I have explained elsewhere, this discovery did not take place
until near nightfall, when darkness was beginning to render surrounding
objects indistinct. The long delay in the arrival of help for
the children of the pioneer led Tall Bear to believe it was not
likely to come before morning; but once more it looked as if Providence
was about to interfere to bring his wicked schemes to naught.</p>

<p>The gloom overspreading stream and prairie prevented the Sioux
from seeing the horsemen clearly enough to identify them. The
forms were so shadowy and vague that nothing more could be learned
than that there were about a dozen men mounted on horses, and
riding toward the cabin on a slow walk, as if not without some
misgiving.</p>

<p>It was certain that while the sentinel on the hill commanded
an unusually wide sweep of vision, he himself was conspicuous,
and the others had been as quick to discover him as he was to
detect them. Both parties, therefore, were aware of the presence
of the other, and neither was likely to make a mistake at this
critical juncture.</p>

<p>But neither Tall Bear nor any of his warriors could tell of a
surety whether the approaching horsemen were white or red men.
The Sioux grouped around the house were not the only ones by any
means that were engaged on this memorable raid in Southern Minnesota,
and it was not impossible that a party of friends were in sight.</p>

<p>It was somewhat curious that the majority of the Sioux believed
a party of their own people at hand. Tall Bear himself was inclined
to think the same; but to guard against any fatal mistake, he
directed his warriors to ride down the hill on the east, so as
to interpose between them and the strangers, who could now be
barely distinguished.</p>

<p>Two other Sioux were to wait until the horsemen came near enough
to settle the question, when they would make it known by signal,
after which the course of the band would be open. If the new-comers
proved to be enemies, a sharp fight was likely to follow, in which
serious damage was certain to be inflicted on both sides.</p>

<p>The directions of the leader were promptly followed, the warriors
galloping off and quickly disappearing in the direction of the
upper trail, along which Melville and Dot had ridden on their
way from the settlement.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "The door swung inward."]</p>

<p>While they were thus engaged, Tall Bear cantered to the front
of the cabin and leaped to the ground. He had determined to attempt
a trick.</p>

<p>Striking his fist against the door, he called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"More Sioux comin'&mdash;open door quick &mdash;Tall Bear won't hurt&mdash;don't
wait."</p>

<p>He hoped the actions of himself and warriors had made known the
former fact before he announced it in words. He counted upon a
panic that would show the lad his situation was hopeless, and
induce him to surrender while there was hope of mercy.</p>

<p>There was no reply to his summons, and he raised his fist to
strike the door again, when he discovered the latch-string on
the outside. With no suspicion of what it meant, he gave it a
twitch.</p>

<p>To his amazement, the door swung inward of its own weight, and,
before he could check himself, he had to take a step within to
escape falling.</p>

<p>With a vague suspicion of the truth, he called to the lad again,
and groped about the lower room.</p>

<p>He quickly discovered that it was empty, and then, with little
personal fear, he hurried up the stairs.</p>

<p>Two minutes were enough to make clear the truth.</p>

<p>He was the only living person in the cabin!</p>
