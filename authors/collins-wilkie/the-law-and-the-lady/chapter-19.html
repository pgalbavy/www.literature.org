<P>
 THE feeling of interest excited by the Trial was prodigiously
increased on the fourth day. The witnesses for the defense were
now to be heard, and first and foremost among them appeared the
prisoner's mother. She looked at her son as she lifted her veil
to take the oath. He burst into tears. At that moment the
sympathy felt for the mother was generally extended to the
unhappy son.
<P>
Examined by the Dean of Faculty, Mrs. Macallan the elder gave her
answers with remarkable dignity and self-control.
<P>
Questioned as to certain private conversations which had passed
between her late daughter-in-law and herself, she declared that
Mrs. Eustace Macallan was morbidly sensitive on the subject of
her personal appearance. She was devotedly attached to her
husband; the great anxiety of her life was to make herself as
attractive to him as possible. The imperfections in her personal
appearance--and especially in her complexion--were subjects to
her of the bitterest regret. The witness had heard her say, over
and over again (referring to her complexion), that there was no
risk she would not run, and no pain she would not suffer, to
improve it. "Men" (she had said) "are all caught by outward
appearances: my husband might love me better if I had a better
color."
<P>
Being asked next if the passages from her son's Diary were to be
depended on as evidence--that is to say, if they fairly
represented the peculiarities in his character, and his true
sentiments toward his wife--Mrs. Macallan denied it in the
plainest and strongest terms.
<P>
"The extracts from my son's Diary are a libel on his character,"
she said. "And not the less a libel because they happen to be
written by himself. Speaking from a mother's experience of him, I
know that he must have written the passages produced in moments
of uncontrollable depression and despair. No just person judges
hastily of a man by the rash words which may escape him in his
moody and miserable moments. Is my son to be so judged because he
happens to have written _his_ rash words, instead of speaking
them? His pen has been his most deadly enemy, in this case--it
has presented him at his very worst. He was not happy in his
marriage--I admit that. But I say at the same time that he was
invariably considerate toward his wife. I was implicitly trusted
by both of them; I saw them in their most private moments. I
declare--in the face of what she appears to have written to her
friends and correspondents--that my son never gave his wife any
just cause to assert that he treated her with cruelty or
neglect."
<P>
The words, firmly and clearly spoken, produced a strong
impression. The Lord Advocate--evidently perceiving that any
attempt to weaken that impression would not be likely to
succeed--confined himself, in cross-examination, to two
significant questions.
<P>
"In speaking to you of the defects in her complexion," he said,
"did your daughter-in-law refer in any way to the use of arsenic
as a remedy?"
<P>
The answer to this was, "No."
<P>
The Lord Advocate proceeded:
<P>
"Did you yourself ever recommend arsenic, or mention it casually,
in the course of the private conversations which you have
described?"
<P>
The answer to this was, "Never."
<P>
The Lord Advocate resumed his seat. Mrs. Macallan the elder
withdrew.
<P>
An interest of a new kind was excited by the appearance of the
next witness. This was no less a person than Mrs. Beauly herself.
The Report describes her as a remarkably attractive person;
modest and lady-like in her manner, and, to all appearance,
feeling sensitively the public position in which she was placed.
<P>
The first portion of her evidence was almost a recapitulation of
the evidence given by the prisoner's mother--with this
difference, that Mrs. Beauly had been actually questioned by the
deceased lady on the subject of cosmetic applications to the
complexion. Mrs. Eustace Macallan had complimented her on the
beauty of her complexion, and had asked what artificial means she
used to keep it in such good order. Using no artificial means,
and knowing nothing whatever of cosmetics, Mrs. Beauly had
resented the question, and a temporary coolness between the two
ladies had been the result.
<P>
Interrogated as to her relations with the prisoner, Mrs. Beauly
indignantly denied that she or Mr. Macallan had ever given the
deceased lady the slightest cause for jealousy. It was impossible
for Mrs. Beauly to leave Scotland, after visiting at the houses
of her cousin's neighbors, without also visiting at her cousin's
house. To take any other course would have been an act of
downright rudeness, and would have excited remark. She did not
deny that Mr. Macallan had admired her in the days when they were
both single people. But there was no further expression of that
feeling when she had married another man, and when he had married
another woman. From that time their intercourse was the innocent
intercourse of a brother and sister. Mr. Macallan was a
gentleman: he knew what was due to his wife and to Mrs.
Beauly--she would not have entered the house if experience had
not satisfied her of that. As for the evidence of the
under-gardener, it was little better than pure invention. The
greater part of the conversation which he had described himself
as overhearing had never taken place. The little that was really
said (as the man reported it) was said jestingly; and she had
checked it immediately--as the witness had himself confessed. For
the rest, Mr. Macallan's behavior toward his wife was invariably
kind and considerate. He was constantly devising means to
alleviate her sufferings from the rheumatic affection which
confined her to her bed; he had spoken of her, not once but many
times, in terms of the sincerest sympathy. When she ordered her
husband and witness to leave the room, on the day of her death,
Mr. Macallan said to witness afterward, "We must bear with her
jealousy, poor soul: we know that we don't deserve it." In that
patient manner he submitted to her infirmities of temper from
first to last.
<P>
The main interest in the cross-examination of Mrs. Beauly
centered in a question which was put at the end. After reminding
her that she had given her name, on being sworn, as "Helena
Beauly," the Lord Advocate said:
<P>
"A letter addressed to the prisoner, and signed 'Helena,' has
been read in Court. Look at it, if you please. Are you the writer
of that letter?"
<P>
Before the witness could reply the Dean of Faculty protested
against the question. The Judges allowed the protest, and refused
to permit the question to be put. Mrs. Beauly thereupon withdrew.
She had betrayed a very perceptible agitation on hearing the
letter referred to, and on having it placed in her hands. This
exhibition of feeling was variously interpreted among the
audience. Upon the whole, however, Mrs. Beauly's evidence was
considered to have aided the impression which the mother's
evidence had produced in the prisoner's favor.
<P>
The next witnesses--both ladies, and both school friends of Mrs.
Eustace Macallan--created a new feeling of interest in Court.
They supplied the missing link in the evidence for the defense.
<P>
The first of the ladies declared that she had mentioned arsenic
as a means of improving the complexion in conversation with Mrs.
Eustace Macallan. She had never used it herself, but she had read
of the practice of eating arsenic among the Styrian peasantry for
the purpose of clearing the color, and of producing a general
appearance of plumpness and good health. She positively swore
that she had related this result of her reading to the deceased
lady exactly as she now related it in Court.
<P>
The second witness, present at the conversation already
mentioned, corroborated the first witness in every particular;
and added that she had procured the book relating to the
arsenic-eating practices of the Styrian peasantry, and their
results, at Mrs. Eustace Macallan's own request. This book she
had herself dispatched by post to Mrs. Eustace Macallan at
Gleninch.
<P>
There was but one assailable p oint in this otherwise conclusive
evidence. The cross-examination discovered it.
<P>
Both the ladies were asked, in turn, if Mrs. Eustace Macallan had
expressed to them, directly or indirectly, any intention of
obtaining arsenic, with a view to the improvement of her
complexion. In each case the answer to that all-important
question was, No. Mrs. Eustace Macallan had heard of the remedy,
and had received the book. But of her own intentions in the
future she had not said one word. She had begged both the ladies
to consider the conversation as strictly private--and there it
had ended.
<P>
It required no lawyer's eye to discern the fatal defect which was
now revealed in the evidence for the defense. Every intelligent
person present could see that the prisoner's chance of an
honorable acquittal depended on tracing the poison to the
possession of his wife--or at least on proving her expressed
intention to obtain it. In either of these cases the prisoner's
Declaration of his innocence would claim the support of
testimony, which, however indirect it might be, no honest and
intelligent men would be likely to resist. Was that testimony
forthcoming? Was the counsel for the defense not at the end of
his resources yet?
<P>
The crowded audience waited in breathless expectation for the
appearance of the next witness. A whisper went round among
certain well-instructed persons that the Court was now to see and
hear the prisoner's old friend--already often referred to in the
course of the Trial as "Mr. Dexter."
<P>
After a brief interval of delay there was a sudden commotion
among the audience, accompanied by suppressed exclamations of
curiosity and surprise. At the same moment the crier summoned the
new witness by the extraordinary name of
<P>
"MISERRIMUS DEXTER"
