<p>
There were soldiers riding down the road, on horses two and two. 
That is the horses were two and two, and the men not.  Because each
man was riding one horse and leading another.  To exercise them. 
They came from Chatham Barracks.  We all drew up in a line outside
the churchyard wall, and saluted as they went by, though we had not
read Toady Lion then.  We have since.  It is the only decent book
I have ever read written by Toady Lion's author.  The others are
mere piffle.  But many people like them.  In Sir Toady Lion the
officer salutes the child.</p>

<p>There was only a lieutenant with those soldiers, and he did not
salute me.  He kissed his hand to the girls; and a lot of the
soldiers behind kissed theirs too.  We waved ours back.</p>

<p>Next day we made a Union Jack out of pocket-handkerchiefs and part
of a red flannel petticoat of the White Mouse's, which she did not
want just then, and some blue ribbon we got at the village shop.</p>

<p>Then we watched for the soldiers, and after three days they went by
again, by twos and twos as before.  It was A1.</p>

<p>We waved our flag, and we shouted.  We gave them three cheers. 
Oswald can shout loudest.  So as soon as the first man was level
with us (not the advance guard, but the first of the battery) - he
shouted - </p>

<p>'Three cheers for the Queen and the British Army!' And then we
waved the flag, and bellowed.  Oswald stood on the wall to bellow
better, and Denny waved the flag because he was a visitor, and so
politeness made us let him enjoy the fat of whatever there was
going.</p>

<p>The soldiers did not cheer that day; they only grinned and kissed
their hands.</p>

<p>The next day we all got up as much like soldiers as we could.  H.
O. and Noel had tin swords, and we asked Albert's uncle to let us
wear some of the real arms that are on the wall in the dining-room.</p>

<p>And he said, 'Yes', if we would clean them up afterwards.  But we
jolly well cleaned them up first with Brooke's soap and brick dust
and vinegar, and the knife polish (invented by the great and
immortal Duke of Wellington in his spare time when he was not
conquering Napoleon.  Three cheers for our Iron Duke!), and with
emery paper and wash leather and whitening.  Oswald wore a cavalry
sabre in its sheath.  Alice and the Mouse had pistols in their
belts, large old flint-locks, with bits of red flannel behind the
flints.  Denny had a naval cutlass, a very beautiful blade, and old
enough to have been at Trafalgar.  I hope it was.  The others had
French sword-bayonets that were used in the Franco-German war. 
They are very bright when you get them bright, but the sheaths are
hard to polish.  Each sword-bayonet has the name on the blade of
the warrior who once wielded it.  I wonder where they are now. 
Perhaps some of them died in the war.  Poor chaps!  But it is a
very long time ago.</p>

<p>I should like to be a soldier.  It is better than going to the best
schools, and to Oxford afterwards, even if it is Balliol you go to.
Oswald wanted to go to South Africa for a bugler, but father would
not let him.  And it is true that Oswald does not yet know how to
bugle, though he can play the infantry 'advance', and the 'charge'
and the 'halt' on a penny whistle.  Alice taught them to him with
the piano, out of the red book Father's cousin had when he was in
the Fighting Fifth.  Oswald cannot play the 'retire', and he would
scorn to do so.  But I suppose a bugler has to play what he is
told, no matter how galling to the young boy's proud spirit.</p>

<p>The next day, being thoroughly armed, we put on everything red,
white and blue that we could think of -  night-shirts are good for
white, and you don't know what you can do with red socks and blue
jerseys till you try - and we waited by the churchyard wall for the
soldiers.  When the advance guard (or whatever you call it of
artillery - it's that for infantry, I know) came by, we got ready,
and when the first man of the first battery was level with us
Oswald played on his penny whistle the 'advance' and the
'charge' - and then shouted - </p>

<p>'Three cheers for the Queen and the British Army!' This time they
had the guns with them.  And every man of the battery cheered too. 
It was glorious.  It made you tremble all over.  The girls said it
made them want to cry - but no boy would own to this, even if it
were true.  It is babyish to cry.  But it was glorious, and Oswald
felt differently to what he ever did before.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the officer in front said, 'Battery!  Halt!' and all
the soldiers pulled their horses up, and the great guns stopped
too.  Then the officer said, 'Sit at ease,' and something else, and
the sergeant repeated it, and some of the men got off their horses
and lit their pipes, and some sat down on the grass edge of the
road, holding their horses' bridles.</p>

<p>We could see all the arms and accoutrements as plain as plain.</p>

<p>Then the officer came up to us.  We were all standing on the wall
that day, except Dora, who had to sit, because her foot was bad,
but we let her have the three-edged rapier to wear, and the
blunderbuss to hold as well - it has a brass mouth and is like in Mr
Caldecott's pictures.</p>

<p>He was a beautiful man the officer.  Like a Viking.  Very tall and
fair, with moustaches very long, and bright blue eyes.  He said - </p>

<p>'Good morning.'</p>

<p>So did we.</p>

<p>Then he said - </p>

<p>'You seem to be a military lot.'</p>

<p>We said we wished we were.</p>

<p>'And patriotic,' said he.</p>

<p>Alice said she should jolly well think so.</p>

<p>Then he said he had noticed us there for several days, and he had
halted the battery because he thought we might like to look at the
guns.</p>

<p>Alas! there are but too few grown-up people so far- seeing and
thoughtful as this brave and distinguished officer.</p>

<p>We said, 'Oh, yes', and then we got off the wall, and that good and
noble man showed us the string that moves the detonator and the
breech-block (when you take it out and carry it away the gun is in
vain to the enemy, even if he takes it); and he let us look down
the gun to see the rifling, all clean and shiny - and he showed us
the ammunition boxes, but there was nothing in them.  He also told
us how the gun was unlimbered (this means separating the gun from
the ammunition carriage), and how quick it could be done - but he
did not make the men do this then, because they were resting. 
There were six guns.  Each had painted on the carriage, in white
letters, 15 Pr., which the captain told us meant fifteen-pounder.</p>

<p>'I should have thought the gun weighed more than fifteen pounds,'
Dora said.  'It would if it was beef, but I suppose wood and gun
are lighter.'</p>

<p>And the officer explained to her very kindly and patiently that 15
Pr.  meant the gun could throw a SHELL weighing fifteen pounds.</p>

<p>When we had told him how jolly it was to see the soldiers go by so
often, he said - </p>

<p>'You won't see us many more times.  We're ordered to the front; and
we sail on Tuesday week; and the guns will be painted mud-colour,
and the men will wear mud-colour too, and so shall I.'</p>

<p>The men looked very nice, though they were not wearing their
busbies, but only Tommy caps, put on all sorts of ways.</p>

<p>We were very sorry they were going, but Oswald, as well as others,
looked with envy on those who would soon be allowed - being grown
up, and no nonsense about your education - to go and fight for their
Queen and country.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Alice whispered to Oswald, and he said - </p>

<p>'All right; but tell him yourself.'</p>

<p>So Alice said to the captain - </p>

<p>'Will you stop next time you pass?'</p>

<p>He said, 'I'm afraid I can't promise that.'</p>

<p>Alice said, 'You might; there's a particular reason.'</p>

<p>He said, 'What?' which was a natural remark; not rude, as it is
with children.  Alice said - </p>

<p>'We want to give the soldiers a keepsake and will write to ask my
father.  He is very well off just now.  Look here - if we're not on
the wall when you come by, don't stop; but if we are, please,
PLEASE do!'</p>

<p>The officer pulled his moustache and looked as if he did not know;
but at last he said 'Yes', and we were very glad, though but Alice
and Oswald knew the dark but pleasant scheme at present fermenting
in their youthful nuts.</p>

<p>The captain talked a lot to us.  At last Noel said - </p>

<p>'I think you are like Diarmid of the Golden Collar.  But I should
like to see your sword out, and shining in the sun like burnished
silver.'</p>

<p>The captain laughed and grasped the hilt of his good blade.  But
Oswald said hurriedly - </p>

<p>'Don't.  Not yet.  We shan't ever have a chance like this.  If
you'd only show us the pursuing practice!  Albert's uncle knows it;
but he only does it on an armchair, because he hasn't a horse.'</p>

<p>And that brave and swagger captain did really do it.  He rode his
horse right into our gate when we opened it, and showed us all the
cuts, thrusts, and guards.  There are four of each kind.  It was
splendid.  The morning sun shone on his flashing blade, and his
good steed stood with all its legs far apart and stiff on the lawn.</p>

<p>Then we opened the paddock gate, and he did it again, while the
horse galloped as if upon the bloody battlefield among the fierce
foes of his native land, and this was far more ripping still.</p>

<p>Then we thanked him very much, and he went away, taking his men
with him.  And the guns of course.</p>

<p>Then we wrote to my father, and he said 'Yes', as we knew he would,
and next time the soldiers came by  - but they had no guns this
time, only the captive Arabs of the desert - we had the keepsakes
ready in a wheelbarrow, and we were on the churchyard wall.</p>

<p>And the bold captain called an immediate halt.</p>

<p>Then the girls had the splendid honour and pleasure of giving a
pipe and four whole ounces of tobacco to each soldier.</p>

<p>Then we shook hands with the captain, and the sergeant and the
corporals, and the girls kissed the captain - I can't think why
girls will kiss everybody -  and we all cheered for the Queen.
It was grand.  And I wish my father had been there to see how much
you can do with L12 if you order the things from the Stores.</p>

<p>We have never seen those brave soldiers again.</p>

<p>I have told you all this to show you how we got so keen about
soldiers, and why we sought to aid and abet the poor widow at the
white cottage in her desolate and oppressedness.</p>

<p>Her name was Simpkins, and her cottage was just beyond the
churchyard, on the other side from our house.  On the different
military occasions which I have remarked upon this widow woman
stood at her garden gate and looked on.  And after the cheering she
rubbed her eyes with her apron.  Alice noticed this slight but
signifying action.</p>

<p>We feel quite sure Mrs Simpkins liked soldiers, and so we felt
friendly to her.  But when we tried to talk to her she would not. 
She told us to go along with us, do, and not bother her.  And
Oswald, with his usual delicacy and good breeding, made the others
do as she said.</p>

<p>But we were not to be thus repulsed with impunity.  We made
complete but cautious inquiries, and found out that the reason she
cried when she saw soldiers was that she had only one son, a boy. 
He was twenty-two, and he had gone to the War last April.  So that
she thought of him when she saw the soldiers, and that was why she
cried.  Because when your son is at the wars you always think he is
being killed.  I don't know why.  A great many of them are not.  If
I had a son at the wars I should never think he was dead till I
heard he was, and perhaps not then, considering everything.  After
we had found this out we held a council.</p>

<p>Dora said, 'We must do something for the soldier's widowed mother.'</p>

<p>We all agreed, but added 'What?'</p>

<p>Alice said, 'The gift of money might be deemed an insult by that
proud, patriotic spirit.  Besides, we haven't more than
eighteenpence among us.'</p>

<p>We had put what we had to father's L12 to buy the baccy and pipes.</p>

<p>The Mouse then said, 'Couldn't we make her a flannel petticoat and
leave it without a word upon her doorstep?'</p>

<p>But everyone said, 'Flannel petticoats in this weather?' so that
was no go.</p>

<p>Noel said he would write her a poem, but Oswald had a deep, inward
feeling that Mrs Simpkins would not understand poetry.  Many people
do not.</p>

<p>H. O. said, 'Why not sing &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; under her window after
she had gone to bed, like waits,' but no one else thought so.</p>

<p>Denny thought we might get up a subscription for her among the
wealthy and affluent, but we said again that we knew money would be
no balm to the haughty mother of a brave British soldier.</p>

<p>'What we want,' Alice said, 'is something that will be a good deal
of trouble to us and some good to her.'</p>

<p>'A little help is worth a deal of poetry,' said Denny.</p>

<p>I should not have said that myself.  Noel did look sick.</p>

<p>' What DOES she do that we can help in?' Dora asked.  'Besides, she
won't let us help.'</p>

<p>H. O. said, 'She does nothing but work in the garden.  At least if
she does anything inside you can't see it, because she keeps the
door shut.'</p>

<p>Then at once we saw.  And we agreed to get up the very next day,
ere yet the rosy dawn had flushed the east, and have a go at Mrs
Simpkins's garden.</p>

<p>We got up.  We really did.  But too often when you mean to,
overnight, it seems so silly to do it when you come to waking in
the dewy morn.  We crept downstairs with our boots in our hands. 
Denny is rather unlucky, though a most careful boy.  It was he who
dropped his boot, and it went blundering down the stairs, echoing
like thunderbolts, and waking up Albert's uncle.  But when we
explained to him that we were going to do some gardening he let us,
and went back to bed.</p>

<p>Everything is very pretty and different in the early morning,
before people are up.  I have been told this is because the shadows
go a different way from what they do in the awake part of the day. 
But I don't know.  Noel says the fairies have just finished tidying
up then.  Anyhow it all feels quite otherwise.</p>

<p>We put on our boots in the porch, and we got our gardening tools
and we went down to the white cottage.  It is a nice cottage, with
a thatched roof, like in the drawing copies you get at girls'
schools, and you do the thatch - if you can - with a B.B. pencil.  If
you cannot, you just leave it.  It looks just as well, somehow,
when it is mounted and framed.</p>

<p>We looked at the garden.  It was very neat.  Only one patch was
coming up thick with weeds.  I could see groundsel and chickweed,
and others that I did not know.  We set to work with a will.  We
used all our tools - spades, forks, hoes, and rakes - and Dora worked
with the trowel, sitting down, because her foot was hurt.  We
cleared the weedy patch beautifully, scraping off all the nasty
weeds and leaving the nice clean brown dirt.  We worked as hard as
ever we could.  And we were happy, because it was unselfish toil,
and no one thought then of putting it in the Book of Golden Deeds,
where we had agreed to write down our virtuous actions and the good
doings of each other, when we happen to notice them.</p>

<p>We had just done, and we were looking at the beautiful production
of our honest labour, when the cottage door burst open, and the
soldier's widowed mother came out like a wild tornado, and her eyes
looked like upas trees - death to the beholder.</p>

<p>'You wicked, meddlesome, nasty children!' she said, ain't you got
enough of your own good ground to runch up and spoil, but you must
come into MY little lot?'</p>

<p>Some of us were deeply alarmed, but we stood firm.</p>

<p>'We have only been weeding your garden,' Dora said; 'we wanted to
do something to help you.'</p>

<p>'Dratted little busybodies,' she said.  It was indeed hard, but
everyone in Kent says 'dratted' when they are cross.  'It's my
turnips,' she went on, 'you've hoed up, and my cabbages.  My
turnips that my boy sowed afore he went.  There, get along with you
do, afore I come at you with my broom-handle.'</p>

<p>She did come at us with her broom-handle as she spoke, and even the
boldest turned and fled.  Oswald was even the boldest.  'They
looked like weeds right enough,' he said.</p>

<p>And Dicky said, 'It all comes of trying to do golden deeds.'  This
was when we were out in the road.</p>

<p>As we went along, in a silence full of gloomy remorse, we met the
postman.  He said - </p>

<p>'Here's the letters for the Moat,' and passed on hastily.  He was
a bit late.</p>

<p>When we came to look through the letters, which were nearly all for
Albert's uncle, we found there was a postcard that had got stuck in
a magazine wrapper.  Alice pulled it out.  It was addressed to Mrs
Simpkins.  We honourably only looked at the address, although it is
allowed by the rules of honourableness to read postcards that come
to your house if you like, even if they are not for you.</p>

<p>After a heated discussion, Alice and Oswald said they were not
afraid, whoever was, and they retraced their steps, Alice holding
the postcard right way up, so that we should not look at the
lettery part of it, but only the address.</p>

<p>With quickly-beating heart, but outwardly unmoved, they walked up
to the white cottage door.</p>

<p>It opened with a bang when we knocked.</p>

<p>'Well?' Mrs Simpkins said, and I think she said it what people in
books call 'sourly'.</p>

<p>Oswald said, 'We are very, very sorry we spoiled your turnips, and
we will ask my father to try and make it up to you some other way.'</p>

<p>She muttered something about not wanting to be beholden to anybody.</p>

<p>'We came back,' Oswald went on, with his always unruffled
politeness, 'because the postman gave us a postcard in mistake with
our letters, and it is addressed to you.'</p>

<p>'We haven't read it,' Alice said quickly.  I think she needn't have
said that.  Of course we hadn't.  But perhaps girls know better
than we do what women are likely to think you capable of.</p>

<p>The soldier's mother took the postcard (she snatched it really, but
'took' is a kinder word, considering everything) and she looked at
the address a long time.  Then she turned it over and read what was
on the back.  Then she drew her breath in as far as it would go,
and caught hold of the door-post.  Her face got awful.  It was like
the wax face of a dead king I saw once at Madame Tussaud's.</p>

<p>Alice understood.  She caught hold of the soldier's mother's hand
and said - </p>

<p>'Oh, NO - it's NOT your boy Bill!'</p>

<p>And the woman said nothing, but shoved the postcard into Alice's
hand, and we both read it - and it WAS her boy Bill.</p>

<p>Alice gave her back the card.  She had held on to the woman's hand
all the time, and now she squeezed the hand, and held it against
her face.  But she could not say a word because she was crying so. 
The soldier's mother took the card again and she pushed Alice away,
but it was not an unkind push, and she went in and shut the door;
and as Alice and Oswald went down the road Oswald looked back, and
one of the windows of the cottage had a white blind.  Afterwards
the other windows had too.  There were no blinds really to the
cottage.  It was aprons and things she had pinned up.</p>

<p>Alice cried most of the morning, and so did the other girls.  We
wanted to do something for the soldier's mother, but you can do
nothing when people's sons are shot.  It is the most dreadful thing
to want to do something for people who are unhappy, and not to know
what to do.</p>

<p>It was Noel who thought of what we COIULD do at last.</p>

<p>He said, 'I suppose they don't put up tombstones to soldiers when
they die in war.  But there - I mean Oswald said, 'Of course not.'</p>

<p>Noel said, 'I daresay you'll think it's silly, but I don't care. 
Don't you think she'd like it, if we put one up to HIM?  Not in the
churchyard, of course, because we shouldn't be let, but in our
garden, just where it joins on to the churchyard?' </p>

<p>And we all thought it was a first-rate idea.</p>

<p>This is what we meant to put on the tombstone:</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'Here lies<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>BILL SIMPKINS<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>Who died fighting for Queen<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>and Country.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'A faithful son,<br />
A son so dear,<br />
A soldier brave<br />
Lies buried here.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Then we remembered that poor brave Bill was really buried far away
in the Southern hemisphere, if at all.  So we altered it to - </p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'A soldier brave<br />
We weep for here.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Then we looked out a nice flagstone in the stable-yard, and we got
a cold chisel out of the Dentist's toolbox, and began.</p>

<p>But stone-cutting is difficult and dangerous work.</p>

<p>Oswald went at it a bit, but he chipped his thumb, and it bled so
he had to chuck it.  Then Dicky tried, and then Denny, but Dicky
hammered his finger, and Denny took all day over every stroke, so
that by tea-time we had only done the H, and about half the E - and
the E was awfully crooked.  Oswald chipped his thumb over the H.</p>

<p>We looked at it the next morning, and even the most sanguinary of
us saw that it was a hopeless task.</p>

<p>Then Denny said, 'Why not wood and paint?' and he showed us how. 
We got a board and two stumps from the carpenter's in the village,
and we painted it all white, and when that was dry Denny did the
words on it.</p>

<p>It was something like this:</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'IN MEMORY OF<br />
BILL SIMPKINS<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>DEAD FOR QUEEN AND COUNTRY.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>HONOUR TO HIS NAME AND ALL<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>OTHER BRAVE SOLDIERS.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>We could not get in what we meant to at first, so we had to give up
the poetry.</p>

<p>We fixed it up when it was dry.  We had to dig jolly deep to get
the posts to stand up, but the gardener helped us.</p>

<p>Then the girls made wreaths of white flowers, roses and Canterbury
bells, and lilies and pinks, and sweet-peas and daisies, and put
them over the posts.  And I think if Bill Simpkins had known how
sorry we were, he would have been glad.  Oswald only hopes if he
falls on the wild battlefield, which is his highest ambition, that
somebody will be as sorry about him as he was about Bill, that's
all!</p>

<p>When all was done, and what flowers there were over from the
wreaths scattered under the tombstone between the posts, we wrote
a letter to Mrs Simpkins, and said - </p>

<p>DEAR MRS SIMPKINS - </p>

<p>We are very, very sorry about the turnips and things, and we beg
your pardon humbly.  We have put up a tombstone to your brave son.</p>

<p>And we signed our names.  Alice took the letter.</p>

<p>The soldier's mother read it, and said something about our oughting
to know better than to make fun of people's troubles with our
tombstones and tomfoolery.</p>

<p>Alice told me she could not help crying.</p>

<p>She said - </p>

<p>'It's not! it's NOT!  Dear, DEAR Mrs Simpkins, do come with me and
see!  You don't know how sorry we are about Bill.  Do come and see.</p>

<p>We can go through the churchyard, and the others have all gone in,
so as to leave it quiet for you.  Do come.'</p>

<p>And Mrs Simpkins did.  And when she read what we had put up, and
Alice told her the verse we had not had room for, she leant against
the wall by the grave -  I mean the tombstone - and Alice hugged her,
and they both cried bitterly.  The poor soldier's mother was very,
very pleased, and she forgave us about the turnips, and we were
friends after that, but she always liked Alice the best.  A great
many people do, somehow.</p>

<p>After that we used to put fresh flowers every day on Bill's
tombstone, and I do believe his mother was pleased, though she got
us to move it away from the churchyard edge and put it in a corner
of our garden under a laburnum, where people could not see it from
the church.  But you could from the road, though I think she
thought you couldn't.  She came every day to look at the new
wreaths.  When the white flowers gave out we put coloured, and she
liked it just as well.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after the erecting of the tombstone the girls
were putting fresh wreaths on it when a soldier in a red coat came
down the road, and he stopped and looked at us.  He walked with a
stick, and he had a bundle in a blue cotton handkerchief, and one
arm in a sling.</p>

<p>And he looked again, and he came nearer, and he leaned on the wall,
so that he could read the black printing on the white paint.</p>

<p>And he grinned all over his face, and he said - </p>

<p>'Well, I AM blessed!'</p>

<p>And he read it all out in a sort of half whisper, and when he came
to the end, where it says, 'and all such brave soldiers', he said - </p>

<p>'Well, I really AM!'  I suppose he meant he really was blessed. 
Oswald thought it was like the soldier's cheek, so he said - </p>

<p>'I daresay you aren't so very blessed as you think.  What's it to
do with you, anyway, eh, Tommy?'</p>

<p>Of course Oswald knew from Kipling that an infantry soldier is
called that.  The soldier said - </p>

<p>'Tommy yourself, young man.  That's ME!' and he pointed to the
tombstone.</p>

<p>We stood rooted to the spot.  Alice spoke first.</p>

<p>'Then you're Bill, and you're not dead,' she said.  'Oh, Bill, I am
so glad!  Do let ME tell your mother.'</p>

<p>She started running, and so did we all.  Bill had to go slowly
because of his leg, but I tell you he went as fast as ever he
could.</p>

<p>We all hammered at the soldier's mother's door, and shouted - </p>

<p>'Come out! come out!' and when she opened the door we were going to
speak, but she pushed us away, and went tearing down the garden
path like winking.  I never saw a grown-up woman run like it,
because she saw Bill coming.</p>

<p>She met him at the gate, running right into him, and caught hold of
him, and she cried much more than when she thought he was dead.</p>

<p>And we all shook his hand and said how glad we were.</p>

<p>The soldier's mother kept hold of him with both hands, and I
couldn't help looking at her face.  It was like wax that had been
painted on both pink cheeks, and the eyes shining like candles. 
And when we had all said how glad we were, she said - </p>

<p>'Thank the dear Lord for His mercies,' and she took her boy Bill
into the cottage and shut the door.</p>

<p>We went home and chopped up the tombstone with the wood-axe and had
a blazing big bonfire, and cheered till we could hardly speak.</p>

<p>The postcard was a mistake; he was only missing.  There was a pipe
and a whole pound of tobacco left over from our keepsake to the

lame, so he cannot fight any more.</p>
