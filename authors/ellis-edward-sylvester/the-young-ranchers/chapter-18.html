<p>By this time the snow lay to the depth of several inches on the
earth. It was still falling, and the cold was increasing. The
flakes were slighter, and there were fewer of them. His knowledge
of the weather told the rancher that the fall would cease after
a while, with a still further lowering of the temperature. Thanks,
however, to the thoughtfulness of his wife more than himself,
they were so plentifully provided with blankets and extra garments
that they were not likely to suffer any inconvenience from that
cause.</p>

<p>Fortunately for them and greatly to their relief, the stretch
of prairie which they had struck continued comparatively level.
Occasionally they ascended a slight elevation or rode down a declivity,
but in no case for more than two hours was either so steep that
the ponies changed their gait from the easy swinging canter to
a walk.</p>

<p>Once, after riding down a slight decline, they struck another
stream, but it was little more than a brook, so strait that a
dozen steps brought them out on the other side with little more
than the wetting of their animals' hoofs.</p>

<p>They rode side by side, for the mare was as fleet and enduring
as the horse. Now and then they glanced back, but saw nothing
to cause alarm, and hope became stronger than before.</p>

<p>"We are doing remarkably well," said the husband, breaking the
silence for the first time in a half hour.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the thoughtful reply; "we must have travelled a good
many miles since the last start, and there is only one danger
that troubles me."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"The probability&mdash;nay, the almost certainty&mdash;that we are not
journeying toward the fort."</p>

<p>"I have thought much of that," replied the husband, giving voice
to a misgiving that had disturbed him more than he was willing
to admit; "it is as you say, that the chances are against our
proceeding in a direct line, but it is equally true that the general
course is right."</p>

<p>"How can you know that?"</p>

<p>"Because we have crossed two streams that were in our path, and
they remain behind us."</p>

<p>"But," reminded the thoughtful wife, "you forget that those same
streams are very winding in their course. If they followed a direct
line, we could ask no more proof that we are on the right track."</p>

<p>"True, but it cannot be that they take such a course that we
are travelling toward the ranch again."</p>

<p>"Hardly as bad as that, but if we are riding at right angles
in either direction, we shall be in a sad plight when the morning
comes. The sun will take from us all chance of dodging the Sioux
so narrowly as we have done more than once since leaving home."</p>

<p>"We must not forget the peril of which you speak; at such times
I trust much to the instinct of the animals."</p>

<p>"And would not that, in the present case, lead them to go toward
rather than from home?"</p>

<p>"I'm blessed if I thought of that!"</p>

<p>The rancher was filled with dismay for the moment, and brought
Dick down to a walk.</p>

<p>"No," he added the next moment, striking him into a gallop again,
"if they were left to themselves they would try to make their
way to the ranch, but they have been under too much guidance,
and have been forced to do too many disagreeable things, for them
to attempt that. I am sure we are nearing Fort Meade."</p>

<p>"I trust so," was the response of the wife; which remark did
anything but add to the hopefulness of her husband.</p>

<p>The animals now began to show signs of fatigue. The snow balled
under their hoofs, causing a peculiar jolting to the riders, when
it became so big that the weight broke it or made their feet slip
off, when new gatherings commenced immediately to form.</p>

<p>After being forced to a canter the horses would drop of their
own accord to a walk, and soon they were left to continue at their
own gait.</p>

<p>"How far, Molly, do you think we have come?" asked the rancher.</p>

<p>"It must be fifteen miles, and possibly more; if it were in a
direct line, adding what we made before crossing the last stream,
it would be safe to wait until morning."</p>

<p>Again the wife gave expression to the thought that was in her
husband's mind. He had been asking himself for the last half hour
whether it would not be wise to come to a halt for daylight. The
rest thus secured to the animals would enable them to do much
better, when the right course could be determined with absolute
certainty, and a few hours' brisk riding ought to take them beyond
all fear of their harassing enemies.</p>

<p>There remained the haunting fear of their being on the wrong
course. If daylight found them little nearer the fort than when
at the ranch, their situation would be most critical. But all
speculation on that important matter must remain such until the
truth could be learned.</p>

<p>One reason why the rancher did not propose a halt before it was
hinted at by his wife, was that no suitable place presented itself.
It would not do to camp in the open plain, where there was no
shelter for them or their animals; they must keep on until the
ground changed.</p>

<p>That change came sooner than they anticipated. The ponies were
plodding forward with their loads, when, before either of the
riders suspected it, they were on the edge of another growth of
timber, which promised the very thing they sought.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" said Mr. Starr, "and I think we can say that the
journey will be suspended until daylight."</p>

<p>"If there is another stream, George, I shall feel safer if we
place ourselves on the other side before we halt for the rest
of the night."</p>

<p>"I don't view another fording with much pleasure, but we can
soon find out how it is."</p>

<p>The character of this timber differed from that which they had
already passed, in that it abounded with so many bowlders and
rocks that, after penetrating it a short way, it became too dangerous
for the ponies to persevere. They were liable at any moment to
break a limb.</p>

<p>"Remain here a few minutes while I investigate," said the rancher,
passing the sleeping Dot to his wife.</p>

<p>He penetrated more than a hundred yards, without coming upon
any water. He did not go farther, for he was satisfied there was
none near them. The ground not only grew more rocky and precipitous
as he advanced, but steadily rose, so as to show that he was at
the base of a ridge over which it was a difficult matter to make
their way. It would have been folly to try it in the darkness,
and on his return he sought some spot favorable for going into
camp.</p>

<p>He was more successful than he expected. A mass of rocks was
found, whose tops projected sufficiently to afford a fair shelter.
The snow, slanting from the other direction, left a comparatively
large surface bare. Here the ponies were drawn to one side and
their trappings removed. There were not enough spare blankets
to cover them as the fugitives wished to do, but they were too
tough to suffer much.</p>

<p>Then the blankets were distributed, and so placed that when the
husband and wife huddled together against the base of the rocks,
they, as well as Dot, were quite comfortable. The rancher might
have gathered wood and started a fire, but it was not needed,
and they feared the consequences of such a proceeding. They were
so worn out with the trials and toil of the night, that they soon
sank into a deep slumber which lasted till morning. Then, upon
awaking, the first act of the rancher was to ascertain his bearings,
so far as it was possible to do so.</p>

<p>The result was the disheartening conviction that they were no
nearer Fort Meade than when they forded the last stream early
on the preceding night.</p>
