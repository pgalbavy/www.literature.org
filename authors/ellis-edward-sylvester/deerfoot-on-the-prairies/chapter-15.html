<p><em>THE </em>situation had taken on a most singular phase. The
Shelton brothers were waiting on the crest of the ridge for the
return of their Blackfoot friend, when in a brief time they were
called upon to enter into a brief struggle with two Shoshone or
Snake Indians for the possession of their own property.</p>

<p>Withal, the paleface youths were eager for the contest. This
was especially true of Victor, who, as he expressed it, was aching
for a set-to with the broad, strongly built youth, toward whom
he had taken an intense dislike from the first.</p>

<p>The arrangements were made by the chief Black Elk and Mul-tal-la,
the two warriors standing as immobile as if hundreds of miles
removed from the spot, though it is not to be supposed they were
not interested. Their leader and the Blackfoot talked again for
two or three minutes, while George and Victor stood side by side,
awaiting the test. The rifle of one was still held by a Shoshone,
while Victor clung to his own weapon.</p>

<p>"I don’t give it up till I have to," grimly remarked the lad.
"One of them has yours, and Mul-tal-la shall take charge of mine;
he’ll act fair, but I don’t believe any of the others will. George,
if you don’t throw that copper-colored scamp you’re no brother
of mine, and you’ll have to settle with <em>me</em>."</p>

<p>"I’ll do my best—I promise you that. Don’t forget that <em>you</em>
have a tough job before you."</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la addressed the brothers:</p>

<p>"My brother George will wrestle with Antelope first; then my
brother Victor will see whether Young Elk is stronger than he."</p>

<p>"How many falls are we to have?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Only one. If he lays you on your back you must give up your
gun to the Antelope. You will not have another chance, but will
have to go without a rifle till you can get one somewhere else."</p>

<p>"In all the wrestling matches I ever saw it was the best two
out of three falls. The fellow may play some trick on me."</p>

<p>"You mustn’t let him," said Victor, impatiently; "you know as
many tricks as he. Remember I’ve got my eye on you, and if he
beats you, you’ll have to take a turn with me."</p>

<p>"Save your strength for yourself," replied George. "Well, I’m
ready," he added, addressing his dusky friend.</p>

<p>The spectators formed a sort of ring, and the youths advanced
to the middle, each warily watching the other and on the alert
for the first advantage.</p>

<p>The wrestling bouts of the early days were not conducted as in
these times. The rule was for the contestants to take their places
with their sides touching, and each with his arm around the waist
or neck of the other. The same style still prevails in many places
remote from towns. When thus interlocked the contestants began
the struggle, twisting, bending, straining and tugging with might
and main and with all the skill the two could bring to their aid.
The spectacle of wrestlers standing face to face and using their
toes to feint and tap each other, most of the motions being simultaneous,
like two fighting chickens, while watching a chance to catch the
other unawares, was formerly unknown in this country.</p>

<p>It will be noted that in the old style, provided both were right
or left-handed, one of the wrestlers had a manifest advantage,
since his stronger side was turned toward the weaker side of the
other. Among boys this advantage was often decided by lot, or
by the first shout of his claim by one of the contestants. The
handicap served also to even matters when there was a marked superiority
of strength or skill on the part of one youth.</p>

<p>George Shelton was right-handed, like most boys, and he determined
not to yield that point to the other. It speedily developed, however,
that the Antelope was left-handed, for he voluntarily placed his
left arm over the shoulders of George—something he would not have
done had his right side been the stronger.</p>

<p>Instead of placing his arm under that of his foe, George Shelton
slipped it on top, though not much was gained thereby. He made
up his mind that if there was to be any strangling done he would
do his share. Thus they stood, with every nerve braced and every
sense alert, waiting for the first test.</p>

<p>The grip of the Antelope, who, it will be remembered, was taller
than George, suddenly tightened and he bore our young friend backward.
But the latter kept his feet and braced for the struggle to fling
the other forward on his face, which was made the next instant.
Then the seesawing went on for several seconds and with the same
alternating abruptness as before, when the young Indian put forth
his utmost power to lift the other off his feet. Had he succeeded,
he would have had no trouble in flinging him forward on his back
or face, for a person can do little when kicking in the air with
his feet clear of the earth.</p>

<p>George defeated his enemy by also lifting. With both straining
in the same manner neither could succeed, and the weight of both
remained on the ground. Then the Antelope ceased his effort, with
the intention of trying some "lock" of which the white boy knew
nothing. [Illustration: The Anglo-Saxon Every Time.]</p>

<p>But this was the opportunity for which George Shelton was waiting.
In the instant of the cessation by his antagonist, the watchful
lad suddenly put forth every ounce of strength and lifted the
young Indian clear. He strove desperately to regain his footing,
but his shabby moccasins vainly trod the air, and before he could
recover his grip George hurled him violently forward on his side.
He struck the ground with a shock that made it tremble. George
lay across his body, from which the breath was driven.</p>

<p>Never was fairer fall seen. The young Shoshone was defeated so
decisively that, had there been an official umpire or referee,
no appeal could have been made to him.</p>

<p>"Good! Good!" exclaimed the delighted Victor, dancing with delight
and clapping his hands. "I’ll own you for my brother, George.
<em>I</em> couldn’t have done better."</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la grinned, for he could not conceal his pleasure. The
spectators, including Young Elk, looked savage, and the brow of
Black Elk was like a thundercloud. No one spoke, but all must
have thought volumes.</p>

<p>Having thrown his rival, George Shelton lay across him for a
few moments, then leaped up, sprang back several paces, and turning
to Mul-tal-la, said:</p>

<p>"Tell him, if he wants it, I’ll give him another chance."</p>

<p>"No; my brother has won his gun."</p>

<p>At the same moment Black Elk reached to the warrior holding the
rifle, and, taking it from him, strode to where George Shelton
was standing and handed it back without a word. Thus far the chief
was certainly disposed to act fairly.</p>

<p>"Thank you for giving me what is mine," said the exultant youth,
bowing so low and smiling so broadly that the chief must have
understood he was receiving thanks, even though none of the words
was intelligible.</p>

<p>"Now, Victor," added George, turning to his brother as he stepped
beside him, "I’ll say to you what you said to me—that is, that
if you don’t get the best of that grinning imp, who is eager to
pummel you, you’re no brother of mine."</p>

<p>While the discomfited wrestler slouched back beside his father,
who acted as if he was ashamed of him, the other son fairly bounded
into the arena. He stood grinning, with fists doubled, and manifestly
impatient for the sport to begin. To hurry his foe he twisted
his face into an insulting grimace.</p>

<p>No one knew Victor’s quick temper better than his brother. It
was that which caused him his only misgiving.</p>

<p>"Victor," said he, with much earnestness, "if you don’t keep
cool and have all your wits about you, you’ll get whipped. He’s
stronger than his brother, and you have a harder job before you
than I did. Remember—<em>KEEP COOL</em>!"</p>

<p>Now, Victor himself was fully aware of his infirmity, but, like
many thus afflicted, he often yielded to it. At the very opening
of the bout he came within a hair of falling a victim to his own
impetuous temper. Neither he nor the Shoshone displayed any of
the scientific points which are seen to-day when two professionals
face each other in the ring, for they had not had any instruction.
You would have said the pose of both was wrong, for, instead of
holding the right hand across and in front of the chest for purposes
of parrying, while the "leading" was done with the left, they
stood with fists thrust out and side by side, but both balanced
themselves well on their feet, and were on the watch for an opening.</p>

<p>Victor looked straight into the dusky face and felt a thrill
of anger when the Shoshone indulged in another tantalizing grimace.
Young Elk made several quick feints, and then, with surprising
quickness, smote the cheek of Victor with the flat of his hand,
and leaped back and grinned at him.</p>

<p>The blow set Victor’s blood aflame, and, forgetting caution,
he rushed upon the other, only, however, to receive a second blow
which almost carried him off his feet. It was directly on the
mouth and started the blood. But it undid the mischief of the
slap given a moment before. Our young friend suddenly realized
that he had no slight task before him, and he heeded the words
of his brother, who again called to him to keep cool. He mastered
his temper and did a clever thing by pretending to be scared.
When Young Elk carefully advanced he retreated, and hurriedly
glanced over his shoulder, as if looking for a place of refuge.</p>

<p>The Indian was deceived and grew confident. He came forward and
drew back his right fist ready to strike, while Victor continued
cautiously to give ground. Finally he braced and awaited the attack.
The closed hand of the Shoshone shot forward, but the blow was
eluded by an instant recoil of the head for an inch or two. Victor
felt the wind of the blow on his nose, so close came the fist
of his foe.</p>

<p>Then with astonishing quickness he concentrated his strength
in his good right arm and landed straight and true upon the cheek
of the other, who was sent backward and reeled to one knee, but
was up again in a flash.</p>

<p>It became clear that Young Elk was afflicted with as quick a
temper as vexed the white youth, for he made a blind, headlong
rush, as if to carry everything before him. As he dashed on, his
arms sawed the air like a windmill. Victor, never more cool and
self-possessed, parried for a moment or two until another opening
offered, when he drove his fist again into the flaming countenance
with a force that sent his antagonist flat upon his back. He had
scored a clean knockdown.</p>

<p>But the Shoshone was not yet vanquished. He bounded to his feet
as if made of rubber, and with more coolness than before advanced
again upon his antagonist. Each was now in a mental state to do
full justice to his own prowess. Several minutes were spent in
"sparring for an opening," but Victor Shelton quickly proved he
was superior in skill. He dodged and parried several blows, and,
when he landed again, it was the most effective stroke yet done.
He delivered his fist accurately upon the jaw of the grinning
youth, who again went down.</p>

<p>Victor sprang forward and stood over him, waiting for the Shoshone
to rise that he might give him the finishing blow. Young Elk lay
as if "taking the count." He was dazed for the moment by the terrific
blows he had received, and all the fight was knocked out of him.
He looked up at the young gladiator, then rose, and, instead of
facing him, turned and ran at full speed down the ridge.</p>

<p>The amazed Victor took two or three steps in pursuit, but immediately
saw that he was not the equal of the other in fleetness, and drew
back. The exasperated chief shouted to his son to return, but
he was too panic-stricken to obey, and continued running.</p>

<p>Victor was thrown into wild rage by his disappointment. He was
not yet through with his foe—though it would seem that he ought
to have been—and he wheeled around, panting, and looking for some
one upon whom to vent his wrath.</p>

<p>"What are you gaping at?"</p>

<p>The question was addressed to the Antelope, standing bewildered
and mystified by the whirlwind rush of events. Before he could
answer, if he had been disposed to do so, Victor drove his fist
into the partly painted face and toppled the owner over on his
back. He was heard to grunt as he struck the ground, and, hastily
clambering to his feet, he too turned and fled after his still
running brother as if death were at his heels.</p>

<p>"I’ll fight <em>you</em>, if you want it," called Victor, striding
in front of the chief, who probably did not understand his meaning.
"Fetch on all the Shoshones in the country, and I’ll tumble them
on top of one another."</p>

<p>But George Shelton and Mul-tal-la saw the moment had come to
interfere. The latter hastily stepped up to the lad and laid a
restraining hand on his shoulder. George did the same.</p>

<p>"Come, Victor," he said, "you have done enough; you have won
your gun, and now don’t spoil everything by your foolishness."</p>
