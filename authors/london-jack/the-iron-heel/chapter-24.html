I had not closed my eyes the night before on the Twentieth Century,
and what of that and of my exhaustion I slept soundly.  When I
first awoke, it was night.  Garthwaite had not returned.  I had
lost my watch and had no idea of the time.  As I lay with my eyes
closed, I heard the same dull sound of distant explosions.  The
inferno was still raging.  I crept through the store to the front.
The reflection from the sky of vast conflagrations made the street
almost as light as day.  One could have read the finest print with
ease.  From several blocks away came the crackle of small hand-
bombs and the churning of machine-guns, and from a long way off
came a long series of heavy explosions.  I crept back to my horse
blankets and slept again.
<P>
When next I awoke, a sickly yellow light was filtering in on me.
It was dawn of the second day.  I crept to the front of the store.
A smoke pall, shot through with lurid gleams, filled the sky.  Down
the opposite side of the street tottered a wretched slave.  One
hand he held tightly against his side, and behind him he left a
bloody trail.  His eyes roved everywhere, and they were filled with
apprehension and dread.  Once he looked straight across at me, and
in his face was all the dumb pathos of the wounded and hunted
animal.  He saw me, but there was no kinship between us, and with
him, at least, no sympathy of understanding; for he cowered
perceptibly and dragged himself on.  He could expect no aid in all
God's world.  He was a helot in the great hunt of helots that the
masters were making.  All he could hope for, all he sought, was
some hole to crawl away in and hide like any animal.  The sharp
clang of a passing ambulance at the corner gave him a start.
Ambulances were not for such as he.  With a groan of pain he threw
himself into a doorway.  A minute later he was out again and
desperately hobbling on.
<P>
I went back to my horse blankets and waited an hour for Garthwaite.
My headache had not gone away.  On the contrary, it was increasing.
It was by an effort of will only that I was able to open my eyes
and look at objects.  And with the opening of my eyes and the
looking came intolerable torment.  Also, a great pulse was beating
in my brain.  Weak and reeling, I went out through the broken
window and down the street, seeking to escape, instinctively and
gropingly, from the awful shambles.  And thereafter I lived
nightmare.  My memory of what happened in the succeeding hours is
the memory one would have of nightmare.  Many events are focussed
sharply on my brain, but between these indelible pictures I retain
are intervals of unconsciousness.  What occurred in those intervals
I know not, and never shall know.
<P>
I remember stumbling at the corner over the legs of a man.  It was
the poor hunted wretch that had dragged himself past my hiding-
place.  How distinctly do I remember his poor, pitiful, gnarled
hands as he lay there on the pavement--hands that were more hoof
and claw than hands, all twisted and distorted by the toil of all
his days, with on the palms a horny growth of callous a half inch
thick.  And as I picked myself up and started on, I looked into the
face of the thing and saw that it still lived; for the eyes, dimly
intelligent, were looking at me and seeing me.
<P>
After that came a kindly blank.  I knew nothing, saw nothing,
merely tottered on in my quest for safety.  My next nightmare
vision was a quiet street of the dead.  I came upon it abruptly, as
a wanderer in the country would come upon a flowing stream.  Only
this stream I gazed upon did not flow.  It was congealed in death.
From pavement to pavement, and covering the sidewalks, it lay
there, spread out quite evenly, with only here and there a lump or
mound of bodies to break the surface.  Poor driven people of the
abyss, hunted helots--they lay there as the rabbits in California
after a drive.*  Up the street and down I looked.  There was no
movement, no sound.  The quiet buildings looked down upon the scene
from their many windows.  And once, and once only, I saw an arm
that moved in that dead stream.  I swear I saw it move, with a
strange writhing gesture of agony, and with it lifted a head, gory
with nameless horror, that gibbered at me and then lay down again
and moved no more.
<P>
<P>
* In those days, so sparsely populated was the land that wild
animals often became pests.  In California the custom of rabbit-
driving obtained.  On a given day all the farmers in a locality
would assemble and sweep across the country in converging lines,
driving the rabbits by scores of thousands into a prepared
enclosure, where they were clubbed to death by men and boys.
<P>
<P>
I remember another street, with quiet buildings on either side, and
the panic that smote me into consciousness as again I saw the
people of the abyss, but this time in a stream that flowed and came
on.  And then I saw there was nothing to fear.  The stream moved
slowly, while from it arose groans and lamentations, cursings,
babblings of senility, hysteria, and insanity; for these were the
very young and the very old, the feeble and the sick, the helpless
and the hopeless, all the wreckage of the ghetto.  The burning of
the great ghetto on the South Side had driven them forth into the
inferno of the street-fighting, and whither they wended and
whatever became of them I did not know and never learned.*
<P>
<P>
* It was long a question of debate, whether the burning of the
South Side ghetto was accidental, or whether it was done by the
Mercenaries; but it is definitely settled now that the ghetto was
fired by the Mercenaries under orders from their chiefs.
<P>
<P>
I have faint memories of breaking a window and hiding in some shop
to escape a street mob that was pursued by soldiers.  Also, a bomb
burst near me, once, in some still street, where, look as I would,
up and down, I could see no human being.  But my next sharp
recollection begins with the crack of a rifle and an abrupt
becoming aware that I am being fired at by a soldier in an
automobile.  The shot missed, and the next moment I was screaming
and motioning the signals.  My memory of riding in the automobile
is very hazy, though this ride, in turn, is broken by one vivid
picture.  The crack of the rifle of the soldier sitting beside me
made me open my eyes, and I saw George Milford, whom I had known in
the Pell Street days, sinking slowly down to the sidewalk.  Even as
he sank the soldier fired again, and Milford doubled in, then flung
his body out, and fell sprawling.  The soldier chuckled, and the
automobile sped on.
<P>
The next I knew after that I was awakened out of a sound sleep by a
man who walked up and down close beside me.  His face was drawn and
strained, and the sweat rolled down his nose from his forehead.
One hand was clutched tightly against his chest by the other hand,
and blood dripped down upon the floor as he walked.  He wore the
uniform of the Mercenaries.  From without, as through thick walls,
came the muffled roar of bursting bombs.  I was in some building
that was locked in combat with some other building.
<P>
A surgeon came in to dress the wounded soldier, and I learned that
it was two in the afternoon.  My headache was no better, and the
surgeon paused from his work long enough to give me a powerful drug
that would depress the heart and bring relief.  I slept again, and
the next I knew I was on top of the building.  The immediate
fighting had ceased, and I was watching the balloon attack on the
fortresses.  Some one had an arm around me and I was leaning close
against him.  It came to me quite as a matter of course that this
was Ernest, and I found myself wondering how he had got his hair
and eyebrows so badly singed.
<P>
It was by the merest chance that we had found each other in that
terrible city.  He had had no idea that I had left New York, and,
coming through the room where I lay asleep, could not at first
believe that it was I.  Little more I saw of the Chicago Commune.
After watching the balloon attack, Ernest took me down into the
heart of the building, where I slept the afternoon out and the
night.  The third day we spent in the building, and on the fourth,
Ernest having got permission and an automobile from the
authorities, we left Chicago.
<P>
My headache was gone, but, body and soul, I was very tired.  I lay
back against Ernest in the automobile, and with apathetic eyes
watched the soldiers trying to get the machine out of the city.
Fighting was still going on, but only in isolated localities.  Here
and there whole districts were still in possession of the comrades,
but such districts were surrounded and guarded by heavy bodies of
troops.  In a hundred segregated traps were the comrades thus held
while the work of subjugating them went on.  Subjugation meant
death, for no quarter was given, and they fought heroically to the
last man.*
<P>
<P>
* Numbers of the buildings held out over a week, while one held out
eleven days.  Each building had to be stormed like a fort, and the
Mercenaries fought their way upward floor by floor.  It was deadly
fighting.  Quarter was neither given nor taken, and in the fighting
the revolutionists had the advantage of being above.  While the
revolutionists were wiped out, the loss was not one-sided.  The
proud Chicago proletariat lived up to its ancient boast.  For as
many of itself as were killed, it killed that many of the enemy.
<P>
<P>
Whenever we approached such localities, the guards turned us back
and sent us around.  Once, the only way past two strong positions
of the comrades was through a burnt section that lay between.  From
either side we could hear the rattle and roar of war, while the
automobile picked its way through smoking ruins and tottering
walls.  Often the streets were blocked by mountains of debris that
compelled us to go around.  We were in a labyrinth of ruin, and our
progress was slow.
<P>
The stockyards (ghetto, plant, and everything) were smouldering
ruins.  Far off to the right a wide smoke haze dimmed the sky,--the
town of Pullman, the soldier chauffeur told us, or what had been
the town of Pullman, for it was utterly destroyed.  He had driven
the machine out there, with despatches, on the afternoon of the
third day.  Some of the heaviest fighting had occurred there, he
said, many of the streets being rendered impassable by the heaps of
the dead.
<P>
Swinging around the shattered walls of a building, in the
stockyards district, the automobile was stopped by a wave of dead.
It was for all the world like a wave tossed up by the sea.  It was
patent to us what had happened.  As the mob charged past the
corner, it had been swept, at right angles and point-blank range,
by the machine-guns drawn up on the cross street.  But disaster had
come to the soldiers.  A chance bomb must have exploded among them,
for the mob, checked until its dead and dying formed the wave, had
white-capped and flung forward its foam of living, fighting slaves.
Soldiers and slaves lay together, torn and mangled, around and over
the wreckage of the automobiles and guns.
<P>
Ernest sprang out.  A familiar pair of shoulders in a cotton shirt
and a familiar fringe of white hair had caught his eye.  I did not
watch him, and it was not until he was back beside me and we were
speeding on that he said:
<P>
"It was Bishop Morehouse."
<P>
Soon we were in the green country, and I took one last glance back
at the smoke-filled sky.  Faint and far came the low thud of an
explosion.  Then I turned my face against Ernest's breast and wept
softly for the Cause that was lost.  Ernest's arm about me was
eloquent with love.
<P>
"For this time lost, dear heart," he said, "but not forever.  We
have learned.  To-morrow the Cause will rise again, strong with
wisdom and discipline."
<P>
The automobile drew up at a railroad station.  Here we would catch
a train to New York.  As we waited on the platform, three trains
thundered past, bound west to Chicago.  They were crowded with
ragged, unskilled laborers, people of the abyss.
<P>
"Slave-levies for the rebuilding of Chicago," Ernest said.  "You
see, the Chicago slaves are all killed."
