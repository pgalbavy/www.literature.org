<p>IT was but too plain. The unfortunate bailiff must have opened
the door before the spell had faded, while yet the Ugly-Wuglies
were something more than mere coats and hats and sticks. They
had rushed out upon him, and had done this. He lay there insensible&mdash;was
it a golf-club or a hockey-stick that had made that horrible cut
on his forehead? Gerald wondered. The girls had rushed to the
sufferer; already his head was in Mabel's lap. Kathleen had tried
to get it on to hers, but Mabel was too quick for her.</p>

<p>Jimmy and Gerald both knew what was the first thing needed by
the unconscious, even before Mabel impatiently said: "Water! water!"</p>

<p>"What in?" Jimmy asked, looking doubtfully at his hands, and
then down the green slope to the marble-bordered pool where the
water-lilies were.</p>

<p>"Your hat&mdash;anything," said Mabel.</p>

<p>The two boys turned away.</p>

<p>"Suppose they come after us," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> come after us?" Gerald snapped rather than asked.</p>

<p>"The Ugly-Wuglies," Jimmy whispered.</p>

<p>"Who's afraid?" Gerald inquired.</p>

<p>But he looked to right and left very carefully, and chose the
way that did not lead near the bushes. He scooped water up in
his straw hat and returned to Flora's Temple, carrying it carefully
in both hands. When he saw how quickly it ran through the straw
he pulled his handkerchief from his breast pocket with his teeth
and dropped it into the hat. It was with this that the girls wiped
the blood from the bailiff's brow.</p>

<p>"We ought to have smelling salts," said Kathleen, half in tears.
"I know we ought."</p>

<p>"They would be good," Mabel owned.</p>

<p>"Hasn't your aunt any?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but<hr>"</p>

<p>"Don't be a coward," said Gerald; "think of last night. <em>They</em>
wouldn't hurt you. He must have insulted them or something. Look
here, you run. We'll see that nothing runs after you."</p>

<p>There was no choice but to relinquish the head of the interesting
invalid to Kathleen; so Mabel did it, cast one glaring glance
round the rhododendron bordered slope, and fled towards the castle.</p>

<p>The other three bent over the still unconscious bailiff.</p>

<p>"He's not dead, is he?" asked Jimmy anxiously.</p>

<p>"No," Kathleen reassured him, "his heart's beating. Mabel and
I felt it in his wrist, where doctors do. How frightfully good-looking
he is!"</p>

<p>"Not so dusty," Gerald admitted.</p>

<p>"I never know what you mean by good-looking," said Jimmy, and
suddenly a shadow fell on the marble beside them and a fourth
voice spoke&mdash;not Mabel's; her hurrying figure, though still in
sight, was far away.</p>

<p>"Quite a personable young man," it said.</p>

<p>The children looked up&mdash;into the face of the eldest of the Ugly-Wuglies,
the respectable one. Jimmy and Kathleen screamed. I am sorry,
but they did.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Gerald savagely: he was still wearing the ring.
"Hold your tongues! I'll get him away," he added in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Very sad affair this," said the respectable Ugly-Wugly. He spoke
with a curious accent; there was something odd about his r's,
and his m's and n's were those of a person labouring under an
almost intolerable cold in the head. But it was not the dreadful
"oo" and "ah" voice of the night before. Kathleen and Jimmy stooped
over the bailiff. Even that prostrate form, being human, seemed
some little protection. But Gerald, strong in the fearlessness
that the ring gave to its wearer, looked full into the face of
the Ugly-Wugly&mdash;and started. For though the face was almost the
same as the face he had himself painted on the school drawing-paper,
it was not the same. For it was no longer paper. It was a real
face, and the hands, lean and almost transparent as they were,
were real hands. As it moved a little to get a better view of
the bailiff it was plain that it had legs, arms&mdash;live legs and
arms, and a self-supporting backbone. It was alive indeed&mdash;with
a vengeance.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" Gerald asked with an effort at calmness&mdash;a
successful effort.</p>

<p>"Most regrettable," said the Ugly-Wugly. "The others must have
missed the way last night in the passage. They never found the
hotel."</p>

<p>"Did <em>you</em>?" asked Gerald blankly.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the Ugly-Wugly. "Most respectable, exactly
as you said. Then when I came away &mdash;I didn't come the front
way because I wanted to revisit this sylvan scene by daylight,
and the hotel people didn't seem to know how to direct me to it
&mdash;I found the others all at this door, very angry. They'd
been here all night, trying to get out. Then the door opened&mdash;this
gentleman must have opened it&mdash;and before I could protect him,
that underbred man in the high hat&mdash;you remember<hr>"</p>

<p>Gerald remembered.</p>

<p>"Hit him on the head, and he fell where you see him. The others
dispersed, and I myself was just going for assistance when I saw
you."</p>

<p>Here Jimmy was discovered to be in tears and Kathleen white as
any drawing-paper.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, my little man?" said the respectable Ugly-Wugly
kindly. Jimmy passed instantly from tears to yells.</p>

<p>"Here, take the ring!" said Gerald in a furious whisper, and
thrust it on to Jimmy's hot, damp, resisting finger. Jimmy's voice
stopped short in the middle of a howl. And Gerald in a cold flash
realised what it was that Mabel had gone through the night before.
But it was daylight, and Gerald was not a coward.</p>

<p>"We must find the others," he said.</p>

<p>"I imagine," said the elderly Ugly-Wugly, "that they have gone
to bathe. Their clothes are in the wood."</p>

<p>He pointed stiffly.</p>

<p>"You two go and see," said Gerald. "I'll go on dabbing this chap's
head."</p>

<p>In the wood Jimmy, now fearless as any lion, discovered four
heaps of clothing, with broomsticks, hockey-sticks, and masks
complete, all that had gone to make up the gentlemen Ugly-Wuglies
of the night before. On a stone seat well in the sun sat the two
lady Ugly-Wuglies, and Kathleen approached them gingerly. Valour
is easier in the sunshine than at night, as we all know. When
she and Jimmy came close to the bench, they saw that the Ugly-Wuglies
were only Ugly-Wuglies such as they had often made. There was
no life in them. Jimmy shook them to pieces, and a sigh of relief
burst from Kathleen.</p>

<p>"The spell's broken, you see," she said; "and that old gentleman,
he's real. He only happens to be like the Ugly-Wugly we made."</p>

<p>"He's got the coat that hung in the hall on, anyway," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>JIMMY SHOOK THEM TO PIECES</em>.]</p>

<p>"No, it's only like it. Let's get back to the unconscious stranger."</p>

<p>They did, and Gerald begged the elderly Ugly-Wugly to retire
among the bushes with Jimmy; "because," said he, "I think the
poor bailiff's coming round, and it might upset him to see strangers&mdash;and
Jimmy'll keep you company. He's the best one of us to go with
you," he added hastily.</p>

<p>And this, since Jimmy had the ring, was certainly true.</p>

<p>So the two disappeared behind the rhododendrons. Mabel came back
with the salts just as the bailiff opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"It's just like life," she said; "I might just as well not have
gone. However<hr>" She knelt down at once and held the bottle
under the sufferer's nose till he sneezed and feebly pushed her
hand away with the faint question:</p>

<p>"What's up now?"</p>

<p>"You've hurt your head," said Gerald. "Lie still."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;more&mdash;smelling-bottle," he said weakly, and lay.</p>

<p>Quite soon he sat up and looked round him. There was an anxious
silence. Here was a grown-up who knew last night's secret, and
none of the children were at all sure what the utmost rigour of
the law might be in a case where people, no matter how young,
made Ugly-Wuglies, and brought them to life&mdash;dangerous, fighting,
angry life. What would he say&mdash;what would he do? He said: "What
an odd thing! Have I been insensible long?"</p>

<p>"Hours," said Mabel earnestly.</p>

<p>"Not long," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"We don't know. We found you like it," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"I'm all right now," said the bailiff, and his eye fell on the
blood-stained handkerchief. "I say, I did give my head a bang.
And you've been giving me first aid. Thank you most awfully. But
it is rum."</p>

<p>"What's rum?" politeness obliged Gerald to ask.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose it isn't really rum &mdash;I expect I saw you
just before I fainted, or whatever it was&mdash;but I've dreamed the
most extraordinary dream while I've been insensible, and you were
in it."</p>

<p>"Nothing but us?" asked Mabel breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, lots of things&mdash;impossible things&mdash;but <em>you</em> were
real enough."</p>

<p>Every one breathed deeply in relief. It was indeed, as they agreed
later, a lucky let-off.</p>

<p>"Are you <em>sure</em> you're all right?" they all asked, as
he got on his feet.</p>

<p>"Perfectly, thank you." He glanced behind Flora's statue as he
spoke. "Do you know, I dreamed there was a door there, but of
course there isn't. I don't know how to thank you," he added,
looking at them with what the girls called his beautiful, kind
eyes; "it's lucky for me you came along. You come here whenever
you like, you know," he added. "I give you the freedom of the
place."</p>

<p>"You're the new bailiff, aren't you?" said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Yes. How did you know?" he asked quickly; but they did not tell
him how they knew. Instead, they found out which way he was going,
and went the other way after warm hand-shakes and hopes on both
sides that they would meet again soon.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," said Gerald, as they watched the tall,
broad figure of the bailiff grow smaller across the hot green
of the grass slope, "have you got any idea of how we're going
to spend the day? Because I have."</p>

<p>The others hadn't.</p>

<p>"We'll get rid of that Ugly-Wugly&mdash;oh, we'll find a way right
enough&mdash;and directly we've done it we'll go home and seal up the
ring in an envelope so that its teeth'll be drawn and it'll be
powerless to have unforeseen larks with us. Then we'll get out
on the roof, and have a quiet day&mdash;books and apples. I'm about
fed up with adventures, so I tell you."</p>

<p>The others told him the same thing.</p>

<p>"Now, <em>think</em>," said he&mdash;"think as you never thought before&mdash;how
to get rid of that Ugly-Wugly."</p>

<p>Every one thought, but their brains were tired with anxiety and
distress, and the thoughts they thought were, as Mabel said, not
worth thinking, let alone saying.</p>

<p>"I suppose Jimmy's all right," said Kathleen anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>he's</em> all right: he's got the ring," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"I hope he won't go wishing anything rotten," said Mabel, but
Gerald urged her to shut up and let him think.</p>

<p>"I think I think best sitting down," he said, and sat; "and sometimes
you can think best aloud. The Ugly-Wugly's <em>real</em>&mdash;don't
make any mistake about that. And he got made real inside that
passage. If we could get him back there he might get changed again,
and then we could take the coats and things back."</p>

<p>"Isn't there any other way?" Kathleen asked; and Mabel, more
candid, said bluntly: "I'm not going into that passage, so there!"</p>

<p>"Afraid! In broad daylight," Gerald sneered.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be broad daylight in there," said Mabel, and Kathleen
shivered.</p>

<p>"If we went to him and suddenly tore his coat off," said she&mdash;"he
<em>is</em> only coats&mdash;he couldn't go on being real then."</p>

<p>"<em>Couldn't</em> he!" said Gerald. "You don't know what he's
like under the coat."</p>

<p>Kathleen shivered again. And all this time the sun was shining
gaily and the white statues and the green trees and the fountains
and terraces looked as cheerfully romantic as a scene in a play.</p>

<p>"Any way," said Gerald, "we'll try to get him back, and shut
the door. That's the most we can hope for. And then apples, and
'Robinson Crusoe' or the 'Swiss Family,' or any book you like
that's got no magic in it. Now, we've just got to do it. And he's
not horrid now; <em>really</em> he isn't. He's real, you see."</p>

<p>"I suppose that makes all the difference," said Mabel, and tried
to feel that perhaps it did.</p>

<p>"And it's broad daylight&mdash;just look at the sun," Gerald insisted.
"Come on!"</p>

<p>He took a hand of each, and they walked resolutely towards the
bank of rhododendrons behind which Jimmy and the Ugly-Wugly had
been told to wait, and as they went Gerald said: "He's real"&mdash;"The
sun's shining"&mdash;"It'll all be over in a minute." And he said these
things again and again, so that there should be no mistake about
them.</p>

<p>As they neared the bushes the shining leaves rustled, shivered,
and parted, and before the girls had time to begin to hang back
Jimmy came blinking out into the sunlight. The boughs closed behind
him, and they did not stir or rustle for the appearance of any
one else. Jimmy was alone.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" asked the girls in one breath.</p>

<p>"Walking up and down in a fir-walk," said Jimmy, "doing sums
in a book. He says he's most frightfully rich, and he's got to
get up to town to the Stocks or something&mdash;where they change papers
into gold if you're clever, he says. I should like to go to the
Stocks-change, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"I don't seem to care very much about changes," said Gerald.
"I've had enough. Show us where he is&mdash;we must get rid of him."</p>

<p>"He's got a motor-car," Jimmy went on, parting the warm varnished-looking
rhododendron leaves, "and a garden with a tennis-court and a lake
and a carriage and pair, and he goes to Athens for his holiday
sometimes, just like other people go to Margate."</p>

<p>"The best thing," said Gerald, following through the bushes,
"will be to tell him the shortest way out is through that hotel
that he thinks he found last night. Then we get him into the passage,
give him a push, fly back, and shut the door."</p>

<p>"He'll starve to death in there," said Kathleen, "if he's really
real."</p>

<p>"I expect it doesn't last long, the ring magics don't&mdash;anyway,
it's the only thing I can think of."</p>

<p>"He's frightfully rich," Jimmy went on unheeding amid the cracking
of the bushes; "he's building a public library for the people
where he lives, and having his portrait painted to put in it.
He thinks they'll like that."</p>

<p>The belt of rhododendrons was passed, and the children had reached
a smooth grass walk bordered by tall pines and firs of strange
different kinds. "He's just round that corner," said Jimmy. "He's
simply rolling in money. He doesn't know what to do with it. He's
been building a horse-trough and drinking fountain with a bust
of himself on top. Why doesn't he build a private swimming-bath
close to his bed, so that he can just roll off into it of a morning?
I wish <em>I</em> was rich; I'd soon show him<hr>"</p>

<p>"That's a sensible wish," said Gerald. "I wonder we didn't think
of doing that. Oh, criky!" he added, and with reason. For there,
in the green shadows of the pine-walk, in the woodland silence,
broken only by rustling leaves and the agitated breathing of the
three unhappy others, Jimmy got his wish. By quick but perfectly
plain-to-be-seen degrees Jimmy became rich. And the horrible thing
was that though they could see it happening they did not know
what was happening, and could not have stopped it if they had.
All they could see was Jimmy, their own Jimmy, whom they had larked
with and quarrelled with and made it up with ever since they could
remember, Jimmy continuously and horribly growing old. The whole
thing was over in a few seconds. Yet in those few seconds they
saw him grow to a youth, a young man, a middle-aged man; and then,
with a sort of shivering shock, unspeakably horrible and definite,
he seemed to settle down into an elderly gentleman, handsomely
but rather dowdily dressed, who was looking down at them through
spectacles and asking them the nearest way to the railway-station.
If they had not seen the change take place, in all its awful details,
they would never have guessed that this stout, prosperous, elderly
gentleman with the high hat, the frock-coat, and the large red
seal dangling from the curve of a portly waistcoat, was their
own Jimmy. But, as they <em>had</em> seen it, they knew the dreadful
truth.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmy, <em>don't</em>!" cried Mabel desperately.</p>

<p>Gerald said: "This is perfectly beastly," and Kathleen broke
into wild weeping.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, little girl!" said That-which-had-been-Jimmy; "and
you, boy, can't you give a civil answer to a civil question?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't know us!" wailed Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Who doesn't know you?" said That-which-had-been impatiently.</p>

<p>"<em>Y&mdash;</em>y&mdash;<em>you</em> don't!" Kathleen sobbed.</p>

<p>"I certainly don't," returned That-which<hr>"but surely that
need not distress you so deeply."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy!" Kathleen sobbed louder than before.</p>

<p>"He <em>doesn't</em> know us," Gerald owned, "or&mdash;look here,
Jimmy, y&mdash;you aren't kidding, are you? Because if you are it's
simply abject rot<hr>"</p>

<p>"My name is Mr. <hr>," said That-which-had-been-Jimmy, and gave
the name correctly. By the way, it will perhaps be shorter to
call this elderly stout person who was Jimmy grown rich by some
simpler name than I have just used. Let us call him "That"&mdash;short
for "That-which-had-been-Jimmy."</p>

<p>"What <em>are</em> we to do?" whispered Mabel, awestruck; and
aloud she said: "Oh, Mr. James, or whatever you call yourself,
<em>do</em> give me the ring." For on That's finger the fatal
ring showed plain.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said That firmly. "You appear to be a very grasping
child."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to <em>do</em>?" Gerald asked in the
flat tones of complete hopelessness.</p>

<p>"Your interest is very flattering," said That. "Will you tell
me, or won't you, the way to the nearest railway-station?"</p>

<p>"No," said Gerald, "we won't."</p>

<p>"Then," said That, still politely, though quite plainly furious,
"perhaps you'll tell me the way to the nearest lunatic asylum?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no!" cried Kathleen. "You're not so bad as that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But <em>you</em> are," That retorted; "if you're
not lunatics you're idiots. However, I see a gentleman ahead who
is perhaps sane. In fact, I seem to recognise him." A gentleman,
indeed, was now to be seen approaching. It was the elderly Ugly-Wugly.</p>

<p>"Oh! don't you remember Jerry?" Kathleen cried, "and Cathy, your
own Cathy Puss Cat? Dear, dear Jimmy, <em>don't</em> be so silly!"</p>

<p>"Little girl," said That, looking at her crossly through his
spectacles, "I am sorry you have not been better brought up."
And he walked stiffly towards the Ugly-Wugly. Two hats were raised,
a few words were exchanged, and two elderly figures walked side
by side down the green pine-walk, followed by three miserable
children, horrified, bewildered, alarmed, and, what is really
worse than anything, quite at their wits' end.</p>

<p>"He wished to be rich, so of course he is," said Gerald; "he'll
have money for tickets and everything."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>TWO HATS WERE RAISED</em>.]</p>

<p>"And when the spell breaks&mdash;it's sure to break, isn't it?&mdash;he'll
find himself somewhere awful&mdash;perhaps in a really good hotel&mdash;and
not know how he got there."</p>

<p>"I wonder how long the Ugly-Wuglies lasted," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Yes," Gerald answered, "that reminds me. You two <em>must</em>
collect the coats and things. Hide them, anywhere you like, and
we'll carry them home to-morrow&mdash;if there <em>is</em> any to-morrow,"
he added darkly.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" said Kathleen, once more breathing heavily on the
verge of tears: "you wouldn't think everything <em>could</em>
be so awful, and the sun shining like it does."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Gerald, "of course I must stick to Jimmy. You
two must go home to Mademoiselle and tell her Jimmy and I have
gone off in the train with a gentleman&mdash;say he looked like an
uncle. He does&mdash;some kinds of uncle. There'll be a beastly row
afterwards, but it's got to be done."</p>

<p>"It all seems thick with lies," said Kathleen; "you don't seem
to be able to get a word of truth in edgewise hardly."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry," said her brother; "they aren't lies&mdash;they're
as true as anything else in this magic rot we've got mixed up
in. It's like telling lies in a dream; you can't help it."</p>

<p>"Well, all I know is I wish it would stop."</p>

<p>"Lot of use your wishing <em>that</em> is," said Gerald, exasperated.
"So long. I've <em>got</em> to go, and you've <em>got</em> to
stay. If it's any comfort to you, I don't believe <em>any</em>
of it's real: it can't be; it's too thick. Tell Mademoiselle Jimmy
and I will be back to tea. If we don't happen to be I can't help
it. I can't help <em>anything</em>, except perhaps Jimmy." He
started to run, for the girls had lagged, and the Ugly-Wugly and
That (late Jimmy) had quickened their pace.</p>

<p>The girls were left looking after them.</p>

<p>"We've <em>got</em> to find these clothes," said Mabel, "simply
got to. I used to want to be a heroine. It's different when it
really comes to being, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very," said Kathleen. "Where shall we hide the clothes
when we've got them? Not&mdash;not that passage?"</p>

<p>"Never!" said Mabel firmly: "we'll hide them inside the great
stone dinosaurus. He's hollow."</p>

<p>"He comes alive&mdash;in his stone," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Not in the sunshine he doesn't," Mabel told her confidently,
"and not without the ring."</p>

<p>"There won't be any apples and books to-day," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"No, but we'll do the babiest thing we <em>can</em> do the minute
we get home. We'll have a dolls' tea-party. That'll make us feel
as if there wasn't really any magic."</p>

<p>"It'll have to be a very strong tea party, then," said Kathleen
doubtfully.</p>

<p>And now we see Gerald, a small but quite determined figure, paddling
along in the soft white dust of the sunny road, in the wake of
two elderly gentlemen. His hand, in his trousers pocket, buries
itself with a feeling of satisfaction in the heavy mixed coinage
that is his share of the profits of his conjuring at the fair.
His noiseless tennis-shoes bear him to the station, where, unobserved,
he listens at the ticket office to the voice of That-which-was-James.
"One first London," it says; and Gerald, waiting till That and
the Ugly-Wugly have strolled on to the platform, politely conversing
of politics and the Kaffir market, takes a third return to London.
The train strides in, squeaking and puffing. The watched take
their seats in a carriage blue-lined. The watcher springs into
a yellow wooden compartment. A whistle sounds, a flag is waved.
The train pulls itself together, strains, jerks, and starts.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>MABEL HANDS UP THE CLOTHES AND THE STICKS</em>.]</p>

<p>"I don't understand," says Gerald, alone in his third-class carriage,
"how railway trains and magic <em>can</em> go on at the same time."</p>

<p>And yet they do.</p>

<p>Mabel and Kathleen, nervously peering among the rhododendron
bushes and the bracken and the fancy fir-trees, find six several
heaps of coats, hats, skirts, gloves, golf-clubs, hockey-sticks,
broom-handles. They carry them, panting and damp, for the mid-day
sun is pitiless, up the hill to where the stone dinosaurus looms
immense among a forest of larches. The dinosaurus has a hole in
his stomach. Kathleen shows Mabel how to "make a back" and climbs
up on it into the cold, stony inside of the monster. Mabel hands
up the clothes and the sticks.</p>

<p>"There's lots of room," says Kathleen; "its tail goes down into
the ground. It's like a secret passage."</p>

<p>"Suppose something comes out of it and jumps out at you," says
Mabel, and Kathleen hurriedly descends.</p>

<p>The explanations to Mademoiselle promise to be difficult, but,
as Kathleen said afterwards, any little thing is enough to take
a grown-up's attention off. A figure passes the window just as
they are explaining that it really did look exactly like an uncle
that the boys have gone to London with.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" says Mademoiselle suddenly, pointing, too, which
every one knows is not manners.</p>

<p>It is the bailiff coming back from the doctor's with antiseptic
plaster on that nasty cut that took so long a-bathing this morning.
They tell her it is the bailiff at Yalding Towers, and she says,
"Sky!" (<em>Ciel!</em>) and asks no more awkward questions about
the boys. Lunch&mdash;very late&mdash;is a silent meal. After lunch Mademoiselle
goes out, in a hat with many pink roses, carrying a rose-lined
parasol. The girls, in dead silence, organise a dolls' tea-party,
with real tea. At the second cup Kathleen bursts into tears. Mabel,
also weeping, embraces her.</p>

<p>"I wish," sobs Kathleen, "oh, I <em>do</em> wish I knew where
the boys were! It <em>would</em> be such a comfort."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>Gerald knew where the boys were, and it was no comfort to him
at all. If you come to think of it, he was the only person who
could know where they were, because Jimmy didn't know that he
was a boy&mdash;and indeed he wasn't really&mdash;and the Ugly-Wugly couldn't
be expected to know anything real, such as where boys were. At
the moment when the second cup of dolls' tea&mdash;very strong, but
not strong enough to drown care in&mdash;was being poured out by the
trembling hand of Kathleen, Gerald was lurking&mdash;there really is
no other word for it&mdash;on the staircase of Aldermanbury Buildings,
Old Broad Street. On the floor below him was a door bearing the
legend "Mr. U. W. Ugli, Stock and Share Broker. And at the Stock
Exchange," and on the floor above was another door, on which was
the name of Gerald's little brother, now grown suddenly rich in
so magic and tragic a way. There were no explaining words under
Jimmy's name. Gerald could not guess what walk in life it was
to which That (which had been Jimmy) owed its affluence. He had
seen, when the door opened to admit his brother, a tangle of clerks
and mahogany desks. Evidently That had a large business.</p>

<p>What was Gerald to do? What <em>could</em> he do?</p>

<p>It is almost impossible, especially for one so young as Gerald,
to enter a large London office and explain that the elderly and
respected head of it is not what he seems, but is really your
little brother, who has been suddenly advanced to age and wealth
by a tricky wishing ring. If you think it's a possible thing,
try it, that's all. Nor could he knock at the door of Mr. U. W.
Ugli, Stock and Share Broker (and at the Stock Exchange), and
inform <em>his</em> clerks that their chief was really nothing
but old clothes that had accidentally come alive, and by some
magic, which he couldn't attempt to explain, become real during
a night spent at a really good hotel which had no existence.</p>

<p>The situation bristled, as you see, with difficulties. And it
was so long past Gerald's proper dinner-time that his increasing
hunger was rapidly growing to seem the most important difficulty
of all. It is quite possible to starve to death on the staircase
of a London building if the people you are watching for only stay
long enough in their offices. The truth of this came home to Gerald
more and more painfully.</p>

<p>A boy with hair like a new front door mat came whistling up the
stairs. He had a dark blue bag in his hands.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a tanner for yourself if you'll get me a tanner's
worth of buns," said Gerald, with that prompt decision common
to all great commanders.</p>

<p>"Show us yer tanners," the boy rejoined with at least equal promptness.
Gerald showed them. "All right; hand over."</p>

<p>"Payment on delivery," said Gerald, using words from the drapers
which he had never thought to use.</p>

<p>The boy grinned admiringly.</p>

<p>"Knows 'is wy abaht," he said; "ain't no flies on 'im."</p>

<p>"Not many," Gerald owned with modest pride. "Cut along, there's
a good chap. I've <em>got</em> to wait here. I'll take care of
your bag if you like."</p>

<p>"Nor yet there ain't no flies on me neither," remarked the boy,
shouldering it. "I been up to the confidence trick for years&mdash;ever
since I was your age."</p>

<p>With this parting shot he went, and returned in due course bun-laden.
Gerald gave the sixpence and took the buns. When the boy, a minute
later, emerged from the door of Mr. U. W. Ugli, Stock and Share
Broker (and at the Stock Exchange), Gerald stopped him.</p>

<p>"What sort of chap's that?" he asked, pointing the question with
a jerk of an explaining thumb.</p>

<p>"Awful big pot," said the boy; "up to his eyes in oof. Motor
and all that."</p>

<p>"Know anything about the one on the next landing?"</p>

<p>"He's bigger than what this one is. Very old firm&mdash;special cellar
in the Bank of England to put his chink in&mdash;all in bins like against
the wall at the corn-chandler's. Jimminy, I wouldn't mind 'alf
an hour in there, and the doors open and the police away at a
beano. Not much! Neither. You'll bust if you eat all them buns."</p>

<p>"Have one?" Gerald responded, and held out the bag.</p>

<p>"They say in our office," said the boy, paying for the bun honourably
with unasked information, "as these two is all for cutting each
other's throats&mdash;oh, only in the way of business&mdash;been at it for
years."</p>

<p>Gerald wildly wondered what magic and how much had been needed
to give history and a past to these two things of yesterday, the
rich Jimmy and the Ugly-Wugly. If he could get them away would
all memory of them fade&mdash;in this boy's mind, for instance, in
the minds of all the people who did business with them in the
City? Would the mahogany-and-clerk-furnished offices fade away?
Were the clerks real? Was the mahogany? Was he himself real? Was
the boy?</p>

<p>"Can you keep a secret?" he asked the other boy. "Are you on
for a lark?"</p>

<p>"I ought to be getting back to the office," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Get then!" said Gerald.</p>

<p>"Don't you get stuffy," said the boy. "I was just agoing to say
it didn't matter. I know how to make my nose bleed if I'm a bit
late."</p>

<p>Gerald congratulated him on this accomplishment, at once so useful
and so graceful, and then said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here. I'll give you five bob&mdash;honest."</p>

<p>"What for?" was the boy's natural question.</p>

<p>"If you'll help me."</p>

<p>"Fire ahead."</p>

<p>"I'm a private inquiry," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"'Tec? You don't look it."</p>

<p>"What's the good of being one if you look it?" Gerald asked impatiently,
beginning on another bun. "That old chap on the floor above&mdash;he's
<em>wanted</em>."</p>

<p>"Police?" asked the boy with fine carelessness.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;sorrowing relations."</p>

<p>"'Return to,'" said the boy; "'all forgotten and forgiven.' I
see."</p>

<p>"And I've got to get him to them, somehow. Now, if you could
go in and give him a message from some one who wanted to meet
him on business<hr>"</p>

<p>"Hold on!" said the boy. "I know a trick worth two of that. You
go in and see old Ugli. He'd give his ears to have the old boy
out of the way for a day or two. They were saying so in our office
only this morning."</p>

<p>"Let me think," said Gerald, laying down the last bun on his
knee expressly to hold his head in his hands.</p>

<p>"Don't you forget to think about my five bob," said the boy.</p>

<p>Then there was a silence on the stairs, broken only by the cough
of a clerk in That's office, and the clickety-clack of a typewriter
in the office of Mr. U. W. Ugli.</p>

<p>Then Gerald rose up and finished the bun.</p>

<p>"You're right," he said. "I'll chance it. Here's your five bob."</p>

<p>He brushed the bun crumbs from his front, cleared his throat,
and knocked at the door of Mr. U. W. Ugli. It opened and he entered.</p>

<p>The door-mat boy lingered, secure in his power to account for
his long absence by means of his well-trained nose, and his waiting
was rewarded. He went down a few steps, round the bend of the
stairs, and heard the voice of Mr. U. W. Ugli, so well known on
that staircase (and on the Stock Exchange) say in soft, cautious
accents:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then I'll ask him to let me look at the ring&mdash;and I'll drop
it. You pick it up. But remember, it's a pure accident, and you
don't know me. I can't have my name mixed up in a thing like this.
You're <em>sure</em> he's really unhinged?"</p>

<p>"Quite," said Gerald; "he's quite mad about that ring. He'll
follow it anywhere. I know he will. And think of his sorrowing
relations."</p>

<p>"I do &mdash;I do," said Mr. Ugli kindly; "that's all I <em>do</em>
think of, of course."</p>

<p>He went up the stairs to the other office, and Gerald heard the
voice of That telling his clerks that he was going out to lunch.
Then the horrible Ugly-Wugly and Jimmy, hardly less horrible in
the eyes of Gerald, passed down the stairs where, in the dusk
of the lower landing, two boys were making themselves as undistinguishable
as possible, and so out into the street, talking of stocks and
shares, bears and bulls. The two boys followed.</p>

<p>"I say," the door-mat-headed boy whispered admiringly, "whatever
are you up to?"</p>

<p>"You'll see," said Gerald recklessly. "Come on!"</p>

<p>"You tell me. I must be getting back."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you, but you won't believe me. That old gentleman's
not really old at all&mdash;he's my young brother suddenly turned into
what you see. The other's not real at all. He's only just old
clothes and nothing inside."</p>

<p>"He looks it, I must say," the boy admitted; "but I say&mdash;you
do stick it on, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, my brother was turned like that by a magic ring."</p>

<p>"There ain't no such thing as magic," said the boy. "I learnt
that at school."</p>

<p>"All right," said Gerald. "Goodbye."</p>

<p>"Oh, go ahead!" said the boy; "you do stick it on, though."</p>

<p>"Well, that magic ring. If I can get hold of it I shall just
wish we were all in a certain place. And we shall be. And then
I can deal with both of them."</p>

<p>"Deal?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the ring won't <em>unwish</em> anything you've wished.
That undoes itself with time, like a spring uncoiling. But it'll
give you a brand-new wish &mdash;I'm almost certain of it. Anyhow,
I'm going to chance it."</p>

<p>"You are a rotter, aren't you?" said the boy respectfully.</p>

<p>"You wait and see," Gerald repeated.</p>

<p>"I say, you aren't going into this swell place! you <em>can't</em>?"</p>

<p>The boy paused, appalled at the majesty of Pym's.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am&mdash;they can't turn us out as long as we behave. You
come along, too. I'll stand lunch."</p>

<p>I don't know why Gerald clung so to this boy. He wasn't a very
nice boy. Perhaps it was because he was the only person Gerald
knew in London, to speak to&mdash;except That-which-had-been-Jimmy
and the Ugly-Wugly; and he did not want to talk to either of them.</p>

<p>What happened next happened so quickly that, as Gerald said later,
it was "just like magic." The restaurant was crowded&mdash;busy men
were hastily bolting the food hurriedly brought by busy waitresses.
There was a clink of forks and plates, the gurgle of beer from
bottles, the hum of talk, and the smell of many good things to
eat.</p>

<p>"Two chops, please," Gerald had just said, playing with a plainly
shown handful of money, so as to leave no doubt of his honourable
intentions. Then at the next table he heard the words, "Ah, yes,
curious old family heirloom," the ring was drawn off the finger
of That, and Mr. U. W. Ugli, murmuring something about a unique
curio, reached his impossible hand out for it. The door-mat-headed
boy was watching breathlessly.</p>

<p>"There's a ring right enough," he owned. And then the ring slipped
from the hand of Mr. U. W. Ugli and skidded along the floor. Gerald
pounced on it like a greyhound on a hare. He thrust the dull circlet
on his finger and cried out aloud in that crowded place:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish Jimmy and I were inside that door behind the statue of
Flora."</p>

<p>It was the only safe place he could think of.</p>

<p>The lights and sounds and scents of the restaurant died away
as a wax-drop dies in fire&mdash;a rain-drop in water. I don't know,
and Gerald never knew, what happened in that restaurant. There
was nothing about it in the papers, though Gerald looked anxiously
for "Extraordinary Disappearance of well-known City Man." What
the door-mat-headed boy did or thought I don't know either. No
more does Gerald. But he would like to know, whereas I don't care
tuppence. The world went on all right, anyhow, whatever he thought
or did. The lights and the sounds and the scents of Pym's died
out. In place of the light there was darkness; in place of the
sounds there was silence; and in place of the scent of beef, pork,
mutton, fish, veal, cabbage, onions, carrots, beer, and tobacco
there was the musty, damp scent of a place underground that has
been long shut up.</p>

<p>[Illustration: HE <em>CRIED OUT ALOUD IN THAT CROWDED PLACE:
"I WISH JIMMY AND I WERE INSIDE THAT DOOR BEHIND THE STATUE OF
FLORA</em>."]</p>

<p>Gerald felt sick and giddy, and there was something at the back
of his mind that he knew would make him feel sicker and giddier
as soon as he should have the sense to remember what it was. Meantime
it was important to think of proper words to soothe the City man
that had once been Jimmy&mdash;to keep him quiet till Time, like a
spring uncoiling, should bring the reversal of the spell&mdash;make
all things as they were and as they ought to be. But he fought
in vain for words. There were none. Nor were they needed. For
through the deep darkness came a voice&mdash;and it was not the voice
of that City man who had been Jimmy, but the voice of that very
Jimmy who was Gerald's little brother, and who had wished that
unlucky wish for riches that could only be answered by changing
all that was Jimmy, young and poor, to all that Jimmy, rich and
old, would have been. Another voice said: "Jerry, Jerry! Are you
awake? &mdash;I've had such a rum dream."</p>

<p>And then there was a moment when nothing was said or done.</p>

<p>Gerald felt through the thick darkness, and the thick silence,
and the thick scent of old earth shut up, and he got hold of Jimmy's
hand.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Jimmy, old chap," he said; "it's not a dream
now. It's that beastly ring again. I had to wish us here, to get
you back at all out of your dream."</p>

<p>"Wish us where?" Jimmy held on to the hand in a way that in the
daylight of life he would have been the first to call babyish.</p>

<p>"Inside the passage&mdash;behind the Flora statue," said Gerald, adding,
"it's all right, really."</p>

<p>"Oh, I daresay it's all right," Jimmy answered through the dark,
with an irritation not strong enough to make him loosen his hold
of his brother's hand. "<em>But how are we going to get out?</em>"</p>

<p>Then Gerald knew what it was that was waiting to make him feel
more giddy than the lightning flight from Cheapside to Yalding
Towers had been able to make him. But he said stoutly:</p>

<p>"I'll wish us out, of course." Though all the time he knew that
the ring would not undo its given wishes.</p>

<p>It didn't.</p>

<p>Gerald wished. He handed the ring carefully to Jimmy, through
the thick darkness. And Jimmy wished.</p>

<p>And there they still were, in that black passage behind Flora,
that had led&mdash;in the case of one Ugly-Wugly at least&mdash;to "a good
hotel." And the stone door was shut. And they did not know even
which way to turn to it.</p>

<p>"If I only had some matches!" said Gerald.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you leave me in the dream?" Jimmy almost whimpered.
"It was light there, and I was just going to have salmon and cucumber."</p>

<p>"I," rejoined Gerald in gloom, "was just going to have steak
and fried potatoes."</p>

<p>The silence, and the darkness, and the earthy scent were all
they had now.</p>

<p>"I always wondered what it would be like," said Jimmy in low,
even tones, "to be buried alive. And now I know! Oh!" his voice
suddenly rose to a shriek, "it isn't true, it isn't! It's a dream&mdash;that's
what it is!"</p>

<p>There was a pause while you could have counted ten. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gerald bravely, through the scent and the silence
and the darkness, "it's just a dream, Jimmy, old chap. We'll just
hold on, and call out now and then just for the lark of the thing.
But it's really only a dream, of course."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Jimmy in the silence and the darkness and the
scent of old earth.</p>
