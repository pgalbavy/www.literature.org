<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Major Jack Starland carried out his thoughtlessly formed plan.
I fear it must be conceded that his motive was not a wholly chivalrous
one. He saw the chance for humiliating the man for whom he felt
only unmitigated contempt. He had not a whit of respect for the
pompous Bambos, but the ponderous nuisance had not insulted him
and his unpardonably. No doubt had the opportunity come to the
President of the Zalapatan Republic, he would have acted with
similar dishonor, but in the affairs of this world, men are judged
by their deeds instead of their motives. Only One can be unerring
in his judgments.</p>

<p>"General Bambos and I will go aboard the tugboat and steam up
the river till we find Yozarro. We may have to go to Atlamalco,
but it makes no difference; the <em>Warrenia</em> will act as
our escort, and I shall make sure the affair is conducted in the
highest style of the art. I don't wish to involve my government
in the broil."</p>

<p>Accordingly, after everything had been explained to Captain Winton
of the yacht, the American officer and the General walked beside
each other across the gangplank, which bowed threateningly under
the unusual weight, the support was drawn in, and both craft began
moving at moderate speed up the bifurcated river. The <em>Warrenia</em>
dropped a little way to the rear, and held thus while the two
ascended the stream.</p>

<p>Excusing himself for a few minutes, the Major left the General
in the cabin and went forward for a few words with Captain Ortega,
who, cigarette in mouth, smilingly saluted and welcomed him.</p>

<p>"You understand, Captain, the arrangement that has been made?"</p>

<p>"I heard what was said; you have agreed to turn over this boat
in person to General Yozarro."</p>

<p>The American nodded.</p>

<p>"You will permit me to say, Major, that you have done a foolish
thing. When you left the gunboat as you did, I was free to pick
up the General and that should have been the end of the affair."</p>

<p>"True, but I am quite willing to feed his vanity to the extent
demanded by General Bambos; but I wish to say, Captain, that I
am in the dark as to where we shall find your President. He sailed
down the river ahead of us, but the yacht saw nothing of him,
when it seems he should have been met, and we have not observed
him on our way."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Major, you should say 'I,' not 'we.'"</p>

<p>"Do you know where General Yozarro is?"</p>

<p>"I have known for several hours; I believe my status has been
changed by the late occurrences and I may speak freely."</p>

<p>"Unquestionably; no cause remains for further secrets between
us."</p>

<p>"Then I may say that some hours ago, when you stood where you
are now standing, discussing this question with me, my eyes were
resting on General Yozarro."</p>

<p>"You astonish me, Captain; be more explicit."</p>

<p>"I knew when he sailed out of sight around the bend in the river,
that he would not go far. He did not. He ran to the southern bank,
lowered his sail, and pulled the boat so far under the overhanging
vegetation that neither you nor your friends noted it. Knowing
where to look, I was more fortunate. The General signalled to
me to come to land, so that he and his men could attack you."</p>

<p>"Why did you not do so? Yet it would have been your death warrant
to have made the attempt."</p>

<p>"That was not the reason why I did not go to him; I had given
the General one opportunity, and was too impatient with him to
provide a second. But, more than that, you had my parole."</p>

<p>"True; I had forgotten that. May I ask what you think General
Yozarro's plan is?"</p>

<p>"He does not understand why I refused to obey his signal, and
there will be a hot quarrel over it when we meet. He expects me
to return, sooner or later, for he must know that the purpose
of yourself is to reach Zalapata with the Se√±orita, after which
I shall be at liberty to return to Atlamalco. I shall, therefore,
find him not far from where I saw him a few hours ago."</p>

<p>"I beg to renew the assurances of my distinguished consideration,
Captain," said the American, saluting and passing back to the
cabin.</p>

<p>The massive Dictator of the Zalapatan Republic was puffing and
striding to and fro over the short length of the cabin, the point
of his scabbard titillating against the floor, for his steps,
though of moderate length for an ordinary man, were long for a
person of his build. His face was redder than ever, and it was
clear that he was agitated over some great question that was wriggling
through his brain.</p>

<p>When he wheeled and faced the American, he whipped off his plumed
hat and sagged down upon the lounge at the side of the cabin.
It creaked but held.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, General, you seem disturbed in mind," remarked the
young officer, drawing up a stool and seating himself opposite.</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> disturbed, Major; nothing in all the world could
have happened to cause me greater regret."</p>

<p>"You refer to the affair of last night; I cannot see that you
have any concern with that."</p>

<p>"Captain Guzman was involved with you."</p>

<p>"If you are so afraid of offending General Yozarro, you can easily
disavow the act of your officer, though he deserves all praise
for what he did."</p>

<p>"Be assured that I shall disavow his crime in the strongest terms,
and, if General Yozarro demands it, the Captain shall be severely
punished."</p>

<p>"The other day, when you were talking with him and me, you were
hot for war against Atlamalco."</p>

<p>"True, but since then I have received a great light."</p>

<p>The amazed American waited to catch a ray himself, but it came
not and he said:</p>

<p>"I delivered your message to General Yozarro yesterday."</p>

<p>"And he received it graciously?"</p>

<p>"Most graciously; there was no hint about sending me back to
you from the muzzle of one of his cannon; he begged me to assure
you he would have your complaint investigated and would do his
utmost to meet your demands."</p>

<p>"What I might have expected from my noble compatriot!" exclaimed
the Dictator with greasy unctuosity; "I was sure of it."</p>

<p>"But you did not look for such magnanimity, when in council with
Captain Guzman and me. May I ask to what is due this marked change
of sentiment on your part?"</p>

<p>General Bambos lifted himself to his feet and swung across the
cabin several times, finally crashing back to his former seat
on the vexed lounge.</p>

<p>"You have heard of General Simon Bolivar?" was his unexpected
question.</p>

<p>"Who has not? He was the great Liberator, born in Venezuela in
1783, who freed Peru, which then became Bolivia, and was rejected
by Colombia, because she did not know how to appreciate his greatness.
His was the finest character ever produced by South America."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that you appreciate him," said General Bambos,
his small black eyes glowing.</p>

<p>"The greatest compliment ever paid General Bolivar was when he
was called the South American Washington. <em>He</em> is the standard
by which the world's heroes are measured."</p>

<p>"You have many heroes in the United States; I have read of Abraham
Lincoln: how does <em>he</em> compare with Washington?"</p>

<p>"The two stand side by side, and sometimes it is hard to see
which is foremost. One was the creator and the other the preserver
of his nation."</p>

<p>"How do <em>I</em> compare with Washington and Lincoln?"</p>
