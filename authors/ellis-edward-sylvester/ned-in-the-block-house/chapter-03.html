<p>The discharge of the second arrow over the head and shoulders
of Ned Preston and Wildblossom Brown lent wings to their flight;
instead of coming to a standstill, as they did a short time before,
they bent all their energies to escape, and ran with the utmost
speed.</p>

<p>In such an effort the advantage was on the side of Ned as compared
with the negro, for he was much more fleet of foot, and, as a
consequence, within two or three minutes he was almost beyond
sight.</p>

<p>"Hold on dar!" shouted Blossom; "dat aint de fair ting to leave
a chap dat way."</p>

<p>Ned Preston could not desert the lad in this fashion, though
it would not help him to stay behind and share his fate.</p>

<p>But his own disposition and the training received from his father
led him to reproach himself for leaving him even for so short
a time. He therefore stopped, and called back&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hurry, Blossom; every minute counts."</p>

<p>"Dat's jes' what I am a doin'," panted Blossom, struggling forward;
"but I never could run as well as you&#11834;"</p>

<p>At that moment Ned Preston, who was looking toward the African,
caught sight of an Indian close behind him. The warrior was in
close pursuit, though the intervening vegetation for the moment
prevented the young pioneer from seeing him distinctly. Enough
was visible, however, to make his aim sure, and Ned brought his
rifle to his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I hear de Injines! Dey're right behind me!" shouted the terrified
Blossom; "get 'em in range, Ned, and shoot 'em all!"</p>

<p>Such a performance as this was out of the question, as a matter
of course, but the boy was determined to do his utmost to help
his friend.</p>

<p>When Ned raised his gun there was but the single warrior visible,
and the sight of him was indistinct; but it was enough to make
the aim certain, and the youth felt that one red man was certain
to pay for his vindictiveness. At the same time he wondered why
no others were seen.</p>

<p>But at the very moment the finger of Ned was pressing the trigger,
the Indian disappeared as suddenly as if he had dropped through
the mouth of a cavern. The target at which the gun was aimed had
vanished.</p>

<p>Mystified and astounded, Ned Preston lowered his piece and stared
at the point where the red man was last seen, as if he doubted
his own senses. At the same moment a suppressed whoop was heard,
and the warrior stepped to view from behind the sycamore, where
he had leaped to dodge the bullet of the rifle which he saw aimed
at him.</p>

<p>Ned was in the act of raising his gun again, when he almost let
it fall from his grasp, with the exclamation&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>DEERFOOT</em>!"</p>

<p>As the single word fell from his lips, his eyes rested on the
figure of a young Indian of singular grace and beauty, who, without
regarding the bewildered Blossom, walked forward to greet Ned
Preston.</p>

<p>  [Illustration: <em>THE MEETING WITH DEERFOOT</em>.]</p>

<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe, at the most, was no more than a year older
than young Preston. He was about the same height, but of lighter
mould, and with a length of lower limbs and a suppleness of frame
which betokened great natural abilities as a runner: when we add
that these capabilities had been cultivated to the highest point,
it will not seem unreasonable that Deerfoot's unequalled swiftness
of foot was known to several tribes besides his own.</p>

<p>Although a Shawanoe by birth (which tribe at that day had their
hunting-grounds north of the Ohio), Deerfoot roamed through the
forests south, and the exploits of the youth in running were told
in the lodges by the camp-fires of the Shawanoe, the Wyandot,
the Miami, the Delaware, and the Cherokee.</p>

<p>His expertness with the bow and arrow, his bravery in battle,
his skill on the hunt, the fact that his mother was shot by settlers,
and his father was killed in the famous Crawford expedition, caused
Deerfoot to be formally ranked as a warrior when he was only fourteen
years of age.</p>

<p>His deftness with his primitive weapons was no less remarkable
than his fleetness of foot. Had he been living to-day, he would
have taken the prize at the annual archery tournaments, even though
he used a hickory bow instead of the double-backed yew or lancewood,
and his missiles were made of the former material, with a single
feather instead of the three, and were tied instead of being glued
in place.</p>

<p>The bow and arrows of Deerfoot would have made a sorry show among
those of the fair ladies and graceful gentlemen at the archery
contests in these times; but those same shafts of the dusky American,
with the keen flint or iron heads, had been driven by him with
such prodigious force that they had found the heart of the deer
or bear or bison at scarcely less than a hundred yards.</p>

<p>Deerfoot therefore refused to use the rifle, but clung to the
bow, whose use he began studying when he was less than three years
old.</p>

<p>As we have said, the young Shawanoe, now no more than seventeen
years of age, was graceful of figure, with elastic, supple limbs,
and with a perfect symmetry of frame. When he smiled, which happened
now and then, he disclosed two rows of teeth as white, even, and
beautiful, and free from decay, as ever existed. The nose was
slightly aquiline, the eyes as black and piercing as those of
a serpent, the forehead high, the cheek bones slightly prominent,
the whole expression pervaded by that slight tinge of melancholy
which seems to be the characteristic of the American race.</p>

<p>Deerfoot's costume and dress were those of the defiant warrior,
who was the implacable foe of the white man. His hair, as long,
black and coarse as that of a horse's mane, was gathered in a
knot or scalp-lock on the crown, where it was tied and ornamented
with eagle feathers, that were stained several brilliant hues;
his hunting-shirt encased his sinewy arms, chest and waist, the
ornamented skirt descending to his knees. The whole garment, made
of buckskin obtained from the traders, was of a yellow color,
the fringe being a deep crimson. Deerfoot shared the love of his
people for flaring colors, as was shown by his handsomely decorated
moccasins which encased his shapely feet, the various-hued fringes
of his leggings, the string of bright beads around his neck, and
the golden bracelet that he wore on his left wrist.</p>

<p>The red leathern belt, which clasped the waist of the young Shawanoe,
formed a pretty contrast to the pale yellow of the hunting-shirt,
and, a short distance off, would have been taken for the crimson
sash worn by the civilized officer of modern times.</p>

<p>Behind this belt were thrust a tomahawk and hunting-knife, both
keen of edge and terribly effective in the hands of the owner.
The bundle of arrows was supported by a string passing around
the neck, the missiles themselves resting behind the shoulder,
the feathered points plainly seen by any one as they projected
upward in front. In this place they were so accessible that Deerfoot,
in discharging them at a foe or an animal, would have two or three
in the air at the same time, there being what might be called
a procession of arrows from the bow to the target, whatever it
might be.</p>

<p>In the coldest weather, the youthful warrior gathered a heavy
blanket about his shoulders, which hid all his figure, from his
chin down to his twinkling moccasins. During the sultry season
he occasionally threw off his hunting-shirt, except the skirt,
so that arm, chest and neck were covered only by the rude figures
which the mother had tattooed there by a most painful process
during the days when Pa-wa-oo-pa, or Deerfoot, was a stoical papoose,
tied to a flat piece of bark, and swinging in the tree branches,
or lying motionless on the ground with limbs tied, and calmly
watching the torturing operation with the bravery which is a part
of the nature of the dusky hunters of the forest.</p>

<p>The bow of Deerfoot was of seasoned hickory, the string was dried
sinew, and the weapon itself was all of six feet in length; so
that, in discharging it, he did not hold it perpendicular, as
is the rule, but in a slanting position; in short, the young Shawanoe
violated more than one fundamental regulation in archery, but
the fact remained that he could spit the gray squirrel on the
top of the tallest oak; he could bring down the buck when leaping
through the air; he had driven his sharp-pointed shaft through
the shaggy body of the bison, and had brought the eagle flapping
and dying to the ground when circling in the clear air far above
his head.</p>

<p>Two years before, Deerfoot was the most vindictive enemy of the
pioneers, who had slain both his father and mother. While attacking
some settlers' cabins near Maysville, with nearly a score of other
Shawanoes, they were surprised and almost annihilated by a party
of whites led by Macaiah Preston, father of Ned. Deerfoot was
wounded and taken captive. He fought like a young tiger, and the
settlers, who knew his extraordinary skill and the injury he had
done them, insisted on putting him to death.</p>

<p>But Macaiah Preston interposed, and would not permit it. He took
him to his own home, and carefully nursed him back to rugged health
and strength.</p>

<p>On the part of the good Samaritan he was assisted by his wife
and Ned, who formed a strong attachment for the captive Shawanoe.
The young brave more than reciprocated this friendship, the sentiment
of gratitude being the most characteristic trait in his nature.
He became henceforth the unfaltering ally and friend of the white
race; from the bitterest enemy he was transformed into the most
devoted friend, his fervency, like that of Saul of Tarsus, being
as extreme as was his previous hatred.</p>

<p>The better to aid the settlers, Deerfoot returned to his own
people, and kept up the semblance of enmity toward the pioneers.
He even took part in several expeditions against them, but all
proved disastrous failures to the assailants, and the youth did
most effective service for those whom he had fought so fiercely
a short time before.</p>

<p>It was of the utmost importance to Deerfoot that his true sentiments
and real doings should be concealed from his people; for whenever
the truth should become known to them, the most frightful death
that could be conceived would be visited upon him.</p>

<p>The daring warrior believed his secret must be discovered; he
believed he would fall a victim to their terrible vengeance sooner
or later; but he was none the less faithful to the settlers. He
simply resolved that he would never submit tamely to his fate;
but, if the aborigines secured him for torment, it would be done
by superior daring and subtlety.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the youthful Shawanoe was playing a most perilous
and dangerous part; but he had played it so well that not until
to-day had he seen just cause to believe any suspicion was afloat
concerning himself.</p>

<p>The action of the Wyandots indicated that they preferred not
to trust him with their secret. It was the first time anything
of the kind had occurred, and it could not but cause uneasiness
in the mind of Deerfoot.</p>

<p>It did not affect in the least, however, his course of action.
He had set out to befriend Ned Preston and Wildblossom Brown,
and it was his purpose to apprise Colonel Preston at Fort Bridgman
of the danger to which his block-house was exposed.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot!" exclaimed Ned Preston, stepping hastily toward him
and extending his hand; "I never was more glad to see you in all
my life."</p>

<p>The handsome mouth of the Shawanoe expanded just enough to show
the white teeth between the dusky lips, and he took the hand of
Ned and pressed it warmly, immediately allowing the palm to drop
from his own.</p>

<p>Then, without speaking, he turned toward Blossom, who, having
seen how matters stood, was scrambling rapidly forward to greet
the young warrior, whom he knew so well, and who was the most
valuable companion they could have at such a time.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was left-handed by birth, but he had trained himself
until he was ambidextrous, and he could draw the bow, hurl the
tomahawk or wield the scalping-knife with the right as well as
with the left hand.</p>

<p>In no single respect, perhaps, was his mental power more clearly
shown than in the celerity with which he acquired the English
language. When several years younger he was able to hold a conversation
with the traders; and during the short time he remained with Macaiah
Preston, before "escaping" to his people again, he became so proficient
that he could readily act as interpreter.</p>

<p>"War dat you dat fired dat arrer at us?" demanded Wildblossom,
as he caught the hand of Deerfoot, who nodded his head, with just
a shadowy smile.</p>

<p>The American Indian, as a rule, does not like the African race,
and he often shows an unreasonable prejudice against him. There
seemed to be such a distaste on the part of Deerfoot, but he concealed
it so well that Blossom Brown never suspected its existence. He
treated the negro lad kindly because he belonged to the Prestons,
whom the Shawanoe loved above all others.</p>

<p>"I thought you war a better shot dan to miss us," added Blossom,
with the purpose of teasing their dusky friend; "your arrer neber
teched me nor Ned."</p>

<p>"Did it hit the buck?" asked Deerfoot, smiling a little more
decisively.</p>

<p>"Dat war 'cause you war so close to him."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot stood further away than did his white brother, who
harmed him not with his gun."</p>

<p>"That was because my rifle missed fire," Ned hastened to explain;
"if it was not for that, the buck would have fallen in his tracks."</p>

<p>"<em>This</em> gun never misses fire," said the Shawanoe, holding
up the bow with no little pride.</p>

<p>"But it misses folks dat it am p'inted at," remarked Blossom,
reaching out and giving Deerfoot a nudge in the back.</p>

<p>"Will my brother with the face of the night, walk a long ways
in the wood and let Deerfoot send a single arrow toward him?"</p>

<p>There was a gleam in the dark eye of the young Shawanoe as he
made this request, and no doubt it would have proven a dangerous
challenge for Blossom to accept. The negro himself did not notice
the full significance of the question, but Ned Preston did, and
he trembled over the temerity of Blossom, who believed that Deerfoot
felt as strong friendship for him as he himself felt for the matchless
young warrior.</p>

<p>Unsuspicious of the slumbering storm, the African lad fortunately
took the very best course to avert it. Shaking his head with a
laugh, he said:</p>

<p>"Dar aint no better rifle-shots dan masser Ned dar; and I'd radder
stand up afore him a hundred yards off, and let him draw bead
on me, dan hab Deerfoot send one ob dem arrers whizzin' arter
dis chile."</p>
