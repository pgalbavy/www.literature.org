<p>Jack Carleton thought himself warranted in imitating the action
of Hay-uta, though he did not raise his head as high as he. The
result was odd. He was able to look between the bases of the trunks
and smaller bushes, so that he saw a number of moccasins, without
being able to discern the bodies to which they belonged. He observed
three or four pairs, and the fringes of the leggings to the knees.
The Pawnees were walking, but their feet looked as if they were
simply raised and put down again, without advancing or retreating.
Inasmuch, however, as they soon disappeared, it was clear they
were taking the right course&mdash;that is, for the best interests
of our friends.</p>

<p>The Sauk, with the upper half of his body erect, watched the
warriors, until they could be seen no longer, when he uttered
an expression of relief, for both he and Jack realized that their
escape&mdash;if it should prove to be such&mdash;was one of the narrowest
possible. It is difficult to conceive how, in the event of discovery,
they could have saved themselves from the Pawnees.</p>

<p>But the presence of the latter on that side of the river, was
of importance to the Sauk and Jack Carleton, and was likely to
complicate the situation. This would be especially true, if Deerfoot
knew nothing about it. He having set out on some errand of his
own, might have been led to a point which prevented him from discovering
the canoe.</p>

<p>At any rate, the Sauk felt the necessity of keeping an eye on
the hostiles. He motioned to the lad to stay where he was, retaining
his own gun and Deerfoot's bow, while he looked after their enemies.
Jack nodded his head, and the warrior moved away.</p>

<p>From his position, prone on the earth, the youth was able to
follow him with his eyes for some distance. The sight was curious,
as he dodged from tree to tree, his body bent over like a centenarian
under the weight of his multitudinous years.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been done with more exquisite skill, and,
when he too passed from sight, the one left behind knew that the
Pawnees would steal no march upon them.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said he, his spirits rising as the situation improved,
"I've got plenty of ammunition for my rifle, and besides that,
here are Deerfoot's bow and arrows. If I had a fort, like that
which sheltered Otto and me on the other side the Mississippi,
I might stand a siege. There would be one good thing," he added,
as he surveyed the aboriginal weapon; "when I fired this off,
none of the Indians would know which one it was to hit&mdash;it certainly
wouldn't be the one I aimed at, and I couldn't guess for myself."</p>

<p>Rising to his feet, he scrutinized every part of the wood, but
there were no signs of the Pawnees, who, it was more than probable,
had passed down the river shore and away from the vicinity.</p>

<p>"Now we have done a good deal of tramping back and forth," reflected
the youth, "and those redskins are so sharp that the chances are
ten to one they will come upon our footprints. It won't do to
sit here all day until some of them tumble over me."</p>

<p>It was clear to Jack that the hostiles had started out on what
was likely to be an extended reconnoissance, and, therefore, were
sure to be gone a considerable while. As the canoe lay only a
short distance off, he passed through the wood and undergrowth
until he reached the spot where it was drawn only a few inches
up the bank.</p>

<p>He surveyed it with natural curiosity, though he had seen many
similar ones further to the east. It was about fifteen feet long,
made of bark, sewed together, and the cracks filled with gum.
The ends were curved over, so there was no difference between
them, and each was ornamented with paintings which composed a
symphony in black, red and yellow.</p>

<p>Two long paddles lay lengthwise in the boat. They were double&mdash;that
is, the handle was in the middle, the ends being dipped alternately
by whomsoever was propelling the craft. Jack looked behind him
several times, before resting his hand on the gunwale. Something
else which lay at the further end interested him, but he could
not make it out at once. Leaning forward, he reached it with his
bow, and then observed that it was a scalp. The barbarous trophy,
by some unusual accident, had dropped unnoticed from the belt
of one of the Pawnees, for it is not to be believed that he would
have left such a prized souvenir behind him, no matter on what
duty engaged.</p>

<p>The ragged patch of skin that had been torn from the crown of
some vanquished foe was three or four inches in diameter, and
the tuft of hair was long, black and coarse. Whoever had succumbed
and borne the outrage, one thing was certain&mdash;he was not a Caucasian,
but belonged to the same race as his conqueror.</p>

<p>Jack, who had seen such trophies many times, raked this one still
closer and picked it up. The dryness of the skin showed that several
weeks had passed since it was taken. More than likely it was the
accompaniment of some fight that took place while the Pawnees
were pushing their explorations toward the Mississippi.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that be a pretty thing for me to carry?" remarked the
youth, placing the hand which held it against his waist, as though
it were a watch charm which he was holding in place for the admiration
of others. "If I should walk back to Martinsville, and stride
up and down between the houses, wouldn't the folks open their
eyes? and wouldn't mother conclude that her Jack was doing well?"</p>

<p>In order the better to examine the scalp, the lad had laid down
his gun and the quiver and bow within the canoe, where they could
be caught up if wanted. He was too prudent to hold his position,
with the possibility of the Pawnees reappearing, without continually
glancing around in quest of them. Aware, too, that his footprints
were likely to be discovered, he would not have approached the
canoe, had it not been for a well-formed purpose of turning the
boat to his own advantage.</p>

<p>"The Pawnees have come over the river to raise the mischief with
us, so it will only be fair if I do what I can to reciprocate.
I'm sure that when they come back, this canoe will either be missing,
or it will have to run into port for repairs."</p>

<p>A shiver as if from an electric shock darted from the crown of
Jack's head to his feet, for at that instant, he heard a slight
sound as if made by a person clearing his throat. Looking up,
he saw one of the Pawnee warriors, twenty yards distant, walking
toward him. He held his rifle in one hand, and was moving slowly
with his eyes fixed on the ground just in front of him. His manner
left no doubt that he was the owner of the scalp in the canoe,
and that, having missed it, he was walking back over his own trail,
while he searched every foot of ground for the trophy. He had
not seen the young Kentuckian, and had no suspicion that he was
in the vicinity. Discovery, however, must come within the next
few seconds, for the nearest shelter was too far off to be of
avail. The sight of the pale-face skurrying to cover, would be
sure to bring a bullet from the Pawnee's gun, or he would summon
his comrades to the spot, by one of those whoops which were heard
so many times the previous day.</p>

<p>[Illustration: A <em>CRITICAL SITUATION</em>.]</p>

<p>There was but one thing to do&mdash;shoot at the Pawnee and run. Jack
bent over to pick up his gun, but in his panic grasped Deerfoot's
bow by mistake. Fortunately, it was strung, and it took only a
second or two to fit an arrow in place. Pointing it at the approaching
Indian, he put forth his utmost strength to draw it to a head.</p>

<p>Before he could do so the Pawnee was within ten yards&mdash;close
enough for him to discover some movement in his field of vision
even though his gaze still rested on the ground. He stopped as
if on the edge of a precipice, and looking up, saw a pale-face
holding a formidable bow, with the arrow pointing at his breast.</p>

<p>This particular Pawnee was Red Wolf, who had been driven almost
out of his senses when Deerfoot launched the shafts at him and
Lone Bear, as they sat by the deserted fire. The figure on which
he gazed was not the terrible Shawanoe, but the bow and the arm
which slowly drew back the string and arrow were more than enough.
He whirled like a flash and was off, bounding from right to left,
as do the Digger Indians of the west when seeking to disconcert
the aim of an enemy.</p>

<p>"Confound you!" muttered, the archer, "since you are so afraid,
I'll give you cause to be; I'll bury this arrow in your back,
so that you may take it home in place of the scalp."</p>

<p><em>Whiz!</em> went the shaft, with all the power he could throw
into his arm, and with the best possible aim. It is enough to
say that it did not come within ten feet of hitting the fugitive.</p>

<p>The incident showed that it would not be safe for the lad to
stay where he was for another minute. Without stopping to consider
the consequences, he shoved off the canoe, stepped into it, and,
seizing the paddle, began guiding it down the stream. As he did
so, he kept it as close as he could to the shore, where the likelihood
of discovery was much less than further out in the stream.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Red Wolf awoke to the fact that he owned a good voice,
and that one of the enemies for whom he and the rest of the Pawnees
were hunting, was much nearer than was supposed. He emitted a
screeching yell, enough to startle all who heard it, and, looking
around and seeing nothing of the white archer, he stopped and
again signaled for the rest to hasten while it was yet time.</p>

<p>The echoes were heard lingering among the arches of the woods,
when a footfall fell on his ear. Turning his head, he observed
another warrior, but the first glimpse revealed the startling
fact that he belonged to a tribe not only different from that
of the Shawanoe, but from the Pawnees. There could be no mistake
as to his sentiments, for the moment he discerned Red Wolf, he
brought his gun to his shoulder The Pawnee made an attempt to
leap behind the nearest tree, but before he could do so, Hay-uta,
the Sauk, pulled the trigger. There was no miss <em>that</em>
time: the career of Red Wolf ended then and there.</p>

<p>"There's been too much mercy shown the Pawnees," probably thought
Hay-uta, as he ran forward to tear the scalp from the head of
his vanquished foe. Reaching the inanimate body, he caught the
long hair, whipped out his knife, and was pressing the crown with
the point, when he uttered an exclamation, dropped the horsehair-like
locks, shoved his knife back in place, and ran from the spot.</p>

<p>That which upset Hay-uta's balance for the moment, was the sudden
recollection that he was a <em>Christian</em> Indian instead of
a heathen. One of the cardinal truths which Deerfoot had impressed
on him, was that he should use no unnecessary cruelty toward his
enemies; that he should refrain from the barbarous practice of
taking the scalp of a fallen foe.</p>

<p>The Sauk halted a few minutes until he could reload his gun,
for, like all frontiersmen, he appreciated the need of having
a loaded weapon always at command. Then he resumed his flight
toward the point where he had left his young pale-face friend.
This carried him so close to the canoe that he saw it in the act
of moving from the shore, and recognized the figure of Jack within
it. Suspecting what it meant, he hurried thither, and was observed
by the lad at the moment he dipped the paddle in the current.
He reversed the movement, and immediately after, the Sauk stepped
within and took the second paddle.</p>

<p>The youth laid his down, saying: "You understand this business
better than I, and I won't mix things by trying to paddle in one
direction while you work in another."</p>

<p>In turning over to Hay-uta the charge of the canoe. Jack did
the wisest thing he could do, and he pleased his companion, on
whom, it may be said, for the time the welfare of both rested.</p>
