<p>If Hay-uta the Sauk had been astonished by the action of his
youthful conqueror, he was now more astonished by his words; but
the former in a measure prepared him for the latter, and he saw
why it was the remarkable warrior had refused to take his life
when the opportunity had been his, and when too he knew that he
whom he was fighting would show him no mercy.</p>

<p>Hay-uta, like many of his people, had listened to the words of
the missionaries&mdash;those strange people who underwent hunger, thirst,
and suffering that they might preach the Word of Life to those
who had never heard of that wonderful Being that died to save
a lost world, and who taught that forgiveness, kindness, and love
were the duty of every one. Hay-uta, I say, had listened to the
words of those people, but only to turn away with a scornful smile,
for he was sure the creed was one to which the American Indian
could never give his faith.</p>

<p>The red man remembered that those priests and missionaries called
themselves Christians, and lo! the most skillful warrior upon
whom he had ever looked, now stood before him and declared that
he too was a Christian. Not only that, but he proved it by his
works, for he refused to tear the reeking scalp from the head
of his enemy, when that enemy was vanquished!</p>

<p>Once more Deerfoot picked the knife of Hay-uta from the ground
and handed it (the point toward himself) to the Sauk. The latter
accepted it and pushed it back in place behind the girdle that
spanned his waist. Then at a signal from Deerfoot he recovered
his rifle and tomahawk, as Deerfoot did his hatchet and bow and
quiver. Without a word, the two walked the short distance to camp,
Hay-uta slightly in the lead.</p>

<p>The camp was of the simplest character, consisting of a pile
of sticks, leaves, and branches which served as a couch, beside
furnishing fuel for the fire when he cooked his food. A long,
heavy blanket was partly folded and lying on the heap of branches,
where it had served as a pillow for the warrior, who was different
from most of his people in using that artificial help to slumber.</p>

<p>The water, which is such a necessity for parties halting in the
wilderness, was obtained from a tiny stream that trickled down
the rocks just beyond, after which it sank out of sight in the
mountain to reappear at some point far removed. The wood and undergrowth
that surrounded the camp of the Sauk were very close and dense,
so that the view in every direction was shut off, unless one should
climb the tallest tree and take his survey from that perch.</p>

<p>When Hay-uta halted in front of his camp-fire he turned about
and extended his hand to Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"Will Deerfoot tell Hay-uta about the Great Spirit of the white
man?"</p>

<p>"He is the Great Spirit of the red man as well as of the white,"
replied the Shawanoe, seating himself on the ground, where he
was opposite the Sauk, who slowly resumed his seat on the pile
of sticks and branches. "He loves all his children&mdash;him with the
face of the night, the Miami, the Huron, the Shawanoe, the Delaware,
the Sauk and Fox, the white man, and all those who live far beyond
the great water which rolls against the shores of our land. He
loves them all, and He hides his face with grief when he sees
them quarrel and try to kill each other. If His children will
do as He tells them to do, they will be happy in this world and
in the hunting grounds where they shall live forever."</p>

<p>Hay-uta remembered that this agreed with what he had heard the
missionaries say, but he recalled also that there was something
more.</p>

<p>"Where does the Great Spirit that Deerfoot tells me about live?"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe pointed reverently upward.</p>

<p>"Far beyond the clouds, the sun, and the stars; He lives there,
and there all shall go who do His will. A long time ago, before
the white men came across the great water, He sent His Son from
Heaven to earth; the Son went about doing good, and died, to save
those He loved from sorrow and death."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot tells me what the Great Spirit says to him; how does
he hear the Great Spirit speak?"</p>

<p>Without changing his half-reclining posture, the Shawanoe drew
forth his small Bible from the inner pocket of his hunting shirt,
the other watching with amazement the action. Opening the sacred
volume, he read in his low, musical voice:</p>

<p>"'Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</p>

<p>"'Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</p>

<p>"'Blessed are the peace-makers: for they shall be called the
children of God.</p>

<p>"'Ye have heard that it has been said, thou shalt love thy neighbor,
and hate thine enemy:</p>

<p>"'But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse
you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully
use you, and persecute you.'"</p>

<p>Deerfoot read these extracts from the Sermon on the Mount, with
which he was so familiar that he could have repeated it all without
looking at the printed page. Then raising his eyes to the wondering
face of Hay-uta, he added:</p>

<p>"Let my brother listen, for these are the words of the Great
Spirit, which he speaks to all his children; if they will obey,
there shall be no unhappiness in the world:</p>

<p>"'<em>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should
do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the
prophets.</em>'"</p>

<p>The Sauk warrior was never so stirred in all his life. He had
seen white men read from books, and he held a misty idea of how
it was done, but he never knew one of his own race who could interpret
the meaning of the curious figures made by some incomprehensible
means on paper.</p>

<p>It was impossible that he should grasp the height and depth of
that sublime utterance, which is of itself the very essence of
the Christian religion; but they were as clear as sunlight to
Deerfoot, who had pondered them many a time since he sat at the
feet of good Mrs. Preston, who presented him with the Word of
Life.</p>

<p>Closing the Book and putting it away, he proceeded to preach
his sermon to the Sauk warrior. Deerfoot assumed the sitting position,
and used both hands in his frequent gestures. Hay-uta reclined
on his side, supporting himself on one elbow, while he fixed his
eyes on his teacher and drank in every word.</p>

<p>"The Great Spirit made all people&mdash;the white, the red, the black
man, and him whose face is the color of the breast of Deerfoot's
hunting shirtfor there are men whose skins are yellow, and others
who are brown. He wishes them to live like brothers, but they
do not. More of the pale faces are evil than good; they use the
red men ill, and the red man loves to fight his enemies, but they
grieve the Great Spirit. Let Hay-uta pray to the Great Spirit;
let him never lie down or rise without talking to Him; let him
stay his hand when it would strike a blow in anger; let him forgive
his foes; let him seek to do the will of the Great Spirit, and
a sweet peace shall fill his heart, such as he never knew before.
Let my brother do that; let him tell the good news to his friends;
let him listen to the words of the missionaries and talk to his
people.</p>

<p>"The father of Deerfoot was a chief of the Shawanoes, who loved
to fight; Deerfoot when a child was a wildcat in his hate of his
enemies and of the pale faces; but the Great Spirit whispered
in his ear, and he became another being. It was the Great Spirit
who told him just now that danger threatened him. Hay-uta knows
that Deerfoot could have slain him had he wished to do so; but
he never wished him ill; he first showed him he was his master,
that Hay-uta might listen to his words; will my brother forget
what Deerfoot has said to him?"</p>

<p>Every being, whether groping in the night of barbarism or walled
in by the skepticism of an advanced civilization, has felt at
one time or another, an irrestrainable longing to draw aside the
veil which shuts out the great hereafter, and solve the mystery
of the life that is to come. Many a time is the heart stirred
to its uttermost depths by the chastening hand of affliction,
or when gazing on the glories of the stars and firmament, or when
listening to the meanings of the vast deep, the soft sighing of
the winds in the forest, or the lisping prayer of infancy. No
proof of the immortality of the soul can equal that of its very
yearning for immortality, and dim, strange, half-heard whisperings
of the Beyond become voices more convincing than all the scientific
scoffing and brilliant ridicule of those whose learning carries
them beyond the trusting faith of childhood, and stops just short
of the grandeur of the light of perfect knowledge.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot addressed his question to the Sauk warrior, the
latter did not answer, but continued gazing into his face as though
he heard not the words, and his thoughts were far away. The Shawanoe
was wise enough to suspect the truth, and refrained from repeating
the question. He, too, held his peace, and for several minutes
the strange scene lasted. The two Indians looked at each other
without speaking.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the afternoon was drawing to a close, and darkness
was creeping through the forest. The camp-fire had burned so low
that it gave out no light, and the figures of the warriors began
to grow indistinct.</p>

<p>Deerfoot felt that he had sowed the seed, and he had only to
wait for it to bear fruit. He arose, and stepping closer to the
fire, stirred it until it gave forth a flame which lit up the
surrounding gloom. Still Hay-uta remained motionless and silent.</p>

<p>Perhaps it has not escaped the notice of the reader that when
the Sauk stood with folded arms before his conqueror, and asked
him to bury his knife in his heart, he said that the son of the
pale face would point the finger of scorn at him. Deerfoot noticed
the curious words, and he felt that the moment had come when he
should learn their full meaning.</p>

<p>"Where is the village of my brother?" he asked in his gentle
way.</p>

<p>The Sauk aroused himself and slowly rose to his feet. Glancing
through the firelight at his questioner, he pointed to the west.</p>

<p>"Two suns' journey away is the home of Hay-uta. There are his
squaw and pappoose. He left them two suns ago to hunt for the
scalps of his enemies; but he will hunt no more; he will go home,
and on his way will think of the words that Deerfoot has said
to him."</p>

<p>"It is well he should do so; but my brother spoke of the son
of the pale face. Why is he in the village of the Sauks?"</p>

<p>"He was brought there in the last moon; the Sauks found two pale
faces in the woods."</p>

<p>"Where is the other?"</p>

<p>"Some of the Sauks took him by another path; Hay-uta knows not
where he is."</p>

<p>"Was harm done him?"</p>

<p>"Hay-uta cannot answer."</p>

<p>"Tell me of the pale face that is in the village of the Sauks
with my brother."</p>

<p>The warrior, assisted by the questions of Deerfoot, who kept
down the deep interest he felt, told all he knew. When he had
finished, as the reader may well suspect, Deerfoot was sure he
had gained most important knowledge. He was satisfied beyond all
doubt that the prisoner in the village of the Sauks was Jack Carleton,
whom he had set out to find, and for whom he feared he would have
to hunt for many moons before learning whether he was alive or
dead.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Sauk rose to his feet and stood in the attitude
of listening, as though he had caught some signal. Deerfoot knew
he was mistaken, for had it been otherwise, he too would have
noticed it.</p>

<p>"Hay-uta bids his brother good bye," was the abrupt exclamation
of the warrior, who caught up his blanket and, without another
word, passed from sight in the wood, leaving the astonished Deerfoot
alone.</p>
